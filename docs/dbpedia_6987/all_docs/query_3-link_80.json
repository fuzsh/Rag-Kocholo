        "text": "\"Mojana\" is an associative re-imagining of a Colombian myth and traditional song. A mermaid-monster, who is desired and punished: the man-eating, seductive Mojana. Agressions against this free and rare spirit are justified by obsessive love and desire. The film denounces the naturalized violence against this mythical female creature and reappropiates her as a symbol of trans-feminine resilience. Kinematic bodies and animal-human hybrids. An absent body, which returns into representation. A history of dissident bodies who resist dying in a necropolitical system.\n\nSimon(e) Jaikiriuma Paetau is a German-Colombian artist. Their artistic projects are located between film and performance, dealing with queer cultures and decoloniality. Simon(e) studied Media Art at the KHM Cologne and Film at the EICTV Cuba. Simon(e)’s films have premiered at Documenta14, Cannes Directors Fortnight, MoMA, Rotterdam and has been awarded the prize for Best Director at the International Cartagena Film Festival Colombia and won the first prize (MuVi Award) at kurzfilmtage Oberhausen, among others. Simon(e)’s performance works have premiered at Studio ? of Maxim Gorki Theater, Ballhaus Naunynstrasse, Hebbel am Ufer, as well as the 11th Berlin Biennale. Nadia Granados Using my body in combination with multi-media technologies, my artistic practice illuminates the relationships between the representation of state violence in mainstream media, institutionalized machismo, heterosexual pornography, and violence against women. My work is both performative and technological, both art and activism, and a mix of cabaret, public intervention, and video transmission. Five years ago I created La Fulminante, a character who invites her audience into the world of auto-representation and meta-pornography, using internet information strategies to condemn globalized society. La Fulminante dismantles the language used in the discourse of emancipation by bringing together in her body eroticism and social criticism. La Fulminante is a character inspired by sexually provocative stereotypes of Latin American women. She embodies erotic fantasies built by the mass media, using reggaeton and pornography. She uses her body as a tool to disseminate information, as an element of attraction to make visible alternative political strategies, a resistance against mass media and a struggle against imperialism. In 2015, I was awarded the 3rd Visual Arts Biennial Bogotá Prize Acquisition Award as well as a FONCA scholarship to create a political multimedia cabaret laboratory in Mexico. In 2013 I was selected for a Franklin Furnace Fund Award for the performance Your Car Is Clean, Your Conscience is Dirty, which I performed in New York City 2015. In 2013, I participated as an invited performer at the Hemispheric Institute’s annual meeting in Sao Paulo, and in 2012 I was invited to Canada for La Rencontre Internationale D’art Performance De Québec (RIAP), taking place throughout four cities in Canada. Additionally, my work has been presented in Canada?, Venezuela, Spain, Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Germany, Ecuador, Argentina, Peru?, the United States, Mexico, Korea, Brazil, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Estonia, Italy, France, and Colombia.\n\n\"L’odeur des fauves en nous\". L’oeuvre s’inscrit dans la démarche assurément poétique de Julie Chaffort qui imagine et fabrique des situations relevant de l’instant magique. Les ingrédients sont le vivant, le chant, la musique, la visibilisation de corps contraints à une trop grande discrétion. Au coeur de ces situations aussi fascinantes que troublantes, Julie Chaffort filme les relations qui existent entre les terrestres (l’ensemble des êtres vivants, sans hiérarchie), les éléments (eau, terre, air et feu), les voix, les sons et les musiques qui prolongent les corps. Le chant des oiseaux, la voix d’une humaine, la puissance d’une chorale, le râle du vent. Les animaux (humain.es compris.es) interagissent avec ferveur et tendresse avec les arbres, la neige, les rivières, les sols. Pensées comme des scènes refuges où les corps existent librement, exultent et s’expriment, les oeuvres réveillent des émotions et des sentiments profondément inscrits dans nos chairs terrestres : l’attention, l’inquiétude, l’écoute, l’amour, la perte, la sensibilité, l’absence, la jouissance, la vulnérabilité ou encore le réconfort. Un ensemble d’états qui nous attache les un.es aux autres et qui rythme les cycles d’une longue métamorphose commune aux êtres visibles et invisibles qui peuplent le vivant.\n\nPour Julie Chaffort, le cinéma est un médium dominant, naturel, qu’elle choisit très tôt de développer, à l’école des beaux-arts de Bordeaux où elle étudie, puis auprès de Roy Andersson qu’elle assiste, et de Werner Herzog dont elle suit le séminaire à sa Rogue Film School. Les vidéos de Julie Chaffort mirent le paysage, le toisent et le parcourent ; on y croise des hommes au destin tragique et des héros aussi beaux que les chants qui les accompagnent – peut être pour en donner la mesure. Les gestes accomplis sont tout à la fois drôles et absurdes, l’avenir toujours incertain et les paroles s’envolent, attrapées par les branches d’une forêt ou englouties dans les eaux d’un lac. Les récits s’écrivent entre les longs plans-séquence et se devinent dans les détails que la lenteur permet d’observer comme l’on admire une nature morte. L’artiste ouvre des univers parallèles, atemporels et insituables, où le monde se signale à nous par ses infimes déplacements et l’infinité de ses signaux – étrangement menaçants. En 2013, Julie Chaffort expose au Centre International d’Art et du Paysage de Vassivière, le film « Hot-Dog », moyen-métrage qu’elle y a réalisé la même année en résidence. L’année suivante, elle présente sa première exposition personnelle « Jour Blanc » au Centre Clark de Montréal, avec des installations vidéos et sonores créées in situ. En 2015 lors de sa résidence à Pollen à Monflanquin, elle réalise le moyen-métrage « La barque silencieuse » ; ce film, « aussi facétieux qu’émouvant, aussi déroutant que respectueux de tout ce qui s’offre à voir et à entendre » pour Jean-Pierre Rehm, est sélectionné en 2016 en compétition française et premier film au FID Marseille. Il est également projeté à la galerie Thaddaeus Ropac à Paris Pantin lors de l’exposition Jeune création 66ème édition et remporte deux prix indépendants, avec deux expositions à la clé, l’une pour la Progress Gallery, « Entre chiens et loups », et l’autre pour la galerie du Pavillon à Pantin, « Les cowboys », sélectionné également au FID 2017. Julie Chaffort remporte en 2015 le prix Bullukian et crée « Somnambules », une exposition personnelle présentée à la fondation. L’artiste a été lauréate du prix « Talents Contemporains » 2015 de la fondation François Schneider pour l’oeuvre « Montagnes Noires » et obtient la même année, le prix Mezzanine Sud et expose au Musée des Abattoirs de Toulouse. Le film « La barque silencieuse » entre en 2017 dans la collection du FRAC Aquitaine ainsi que la vidéo « Nostalgia » dans celle du FRAC Occitanie Toulouse. En 2018, Julie Chaffort est lauréate du prix Mécènes du Sud Montpellier-Sète et obtient en 2019 la bourse de soutien à la création du CNAP pour l’élaboration de son projet vidéo « PRINTEMPS » dont une exposition monographie du même titre est présentée à l’ancien palais épiscopal des musées de Béziers avec le soutien de Mécènes du Sud Montpellier-Sète en 2020. Son dernier film « Légendes » a fait partie de la compétition officielle française et la compétition CNAP du FIDMarseille 2020.\n\nA human being (the artist himself) lies half-naked on a forest floor, facing the viewer while gently singing. On his body rests a throng of colorful moths whose fluttering wings generate a melody attuned to the song. With its prolonged visual intro and lyrical song, Hour of Moth (Etude no. II) takes the form of a music video where Mejdahl himself is both the singer and songwriter. The work is a love song to the angel of the night—the moth—but also a yearning and sensual hymn to all nature. Mejdahls claims the geometric patterns on moth wings to be hidden warning messages from nature itself, but humans struggle to comprehend them. Hour of Moth (Etude. no II) thus looks upon the current climate crisis in which the human race feel detatched from Nature, while still searching for hope in the dark. This video art piece was made for Mejdal’s solo exhibition Liljegrotten (Lillith Grotto) at Overgaden Institute for Contemporary Art, Copenhagen (2021). The same year Hour of Moth (Etude no. II) was aqcuired by by The Museum of Contemporary Art (Museum for Samtidskunst), and The Danish Arts Foundation.\n\nCopenhagen-based visual artist, filmmaker, and electronic music composer Kim Richard Adler Mejdahl was born in the Danish village Skælskør. With an educational background in fine arts Mejdahl has created a wide range of critically acclaimed artworks that interweave genres and media. In 2018 Mejdahl received The Jury’s Solo Award at Charlottenborg’s Spring Exhibition for his horror-musical documentary ODE - featuring the artist’s entire family that sing about their deceased abusive father. The movie was later aqcuired by The National Gallery of Denmark (Statens Museum for Kunst). Mejdahl’s largest production consists of his debut arthouse feature DAYS OF AL from 2019 - an experimental horror film starring the artist’s cousin and puppy dachshund as leading actors. Both movies come with its own soundtrack released by the artist’s music alias Kim Kim. This summer Mejdahl will release Liljegrotten - a music album and Denmark’s largest collectively produced sound piece made entirely out of audience sound recordings generated at the artist’s latest solo exhibition at Overgaden Institute of Contemporary Art.\n\nChameleon is an experimental visual album inspired by the radical queer feminist genre of the “Biomythography” which refers to Audre Lorde’s foundational work entitled Zami: A New Spelling of My Name published in 1982. It combines history, biography, and myth, and holds a literary perspective that serves as a guiding light for complex narrative storytelling rooted in a queer, Black self-defined, feminist imagination.\n\njaamil olawale kosoko, (they/them) of Yoruba and Natchez descent is an award winning filmmaker, movement artist, poet, and facilitator whose work in embodied poetics and performance has been presented internationally and is rooted in the intergenerational passage of Black feminist knowledge, queer theories of the body, and sacred rituals of intimacy & wellness as a means to craft perpetual modes of freedom, healing, and care where/when/however possible. Their new book, Black Body Amnesia: Poems & Other Speech Acts was released in Feb. 2022. jaamil is the recipient of a MacDowell Fellowship, PEW Fellowship in the Arts, Princeton Arts Fellowship, 2019 Red Bull Writing Fellowship, and a 2017 Cave Canem Poetry Fellowship.

Of Nigerian and Finnish descent, Ima Iduozee is a choreographer, director, dancer and filmmaker based in Helsinki, Finland. His debut solo work, This is the Title, premiered in 2012 and went on to garner international acclaim, touring in 15 countries across Europe, North America and Asia.

Earlier commissions include works for The Finnish National Theatre, Aalto International, Stockholm City Theatre, Helsinki City Theatre, Finnish National Opera and Helsinki International Film Festival. In 2016 Iduozee graduated from the Arts University of Helsinki (Theatre Academy).\n\nA sprawling meditation on the choreography of bodies in Moscow’s urban landscape, Detours depicts a new way of dealing illicit drugs via the Darknet, the layering of the physical and the virtual realities, as well as a poetics, and politics, of space. Taking place in sleepy neighbourhoods, among the concrete walls of high-rises, behind garages and amidst abandoned railroads, the film alternately follows and loses track of Denis, the treasureman who hides stashes of drugs all over the city.\n\nEkaterina Selenkina is a filmmaker, artist and curator born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1992. Her work showed at Venice International Film Critics’ Week, Viennale, Thessaloniki International Film Festival, Garage Museum of Modern Art, Camerimage, Pacific Meridian, Message to Man, New Holland Island International Debut Film Festival, REDCAT arts center, among others. Together with Zaina Bseiso, Luis Gutiérrez Arias and Joie Estrella Horwitz, she is a member of the film collective called Bahía Colectiva and co-curator of Adrift Residency. She received her MFA in Film/Video from California Institute of the Arts and is currently based in Moscow.\n\n‘Agony to Ecstasy’ looks at the scope of the socio-addictive condition within Scottish people. It focuses on the relationship between pain and pleasure, between stress and relief and between entrapment and escape. The film in many ways, is a dissection of two spaces – euphoric clubbing and silent Scottish nature, offering a perspective on our need for salvation within both. Neurologically, there is very little difference between the brain addicted to something, as to when falling in love. As a result, the film fluctuates between these neurological and personal perspectives on addiction and connection – where their conflating and often paradoxical relationship are juxtaposed. The film is made with reflection as its key focus. Made during the middle of the first lockdown, it uses the collective state of withdrawal and loneliness to observe realities within clubs. A slow-motion strobe follows the film throughout, as a visual deconstruction of the joy, yet ghostly inhibition of the people in the shots. Vulnerability was key in Dej’s recollections – his words occupy the emotional worlds of mental health, stigma and the ecstasy of clubbing, without having a particular stance or opinion. Ultimately 'Agony to Ecstasy' looks beyond fixed stereotypes of addicts, and into the dependencies, shame and love between Scottish people.\n\nCal Mac is a visual artist working and living in Glasgow. Working between sculpture print and video, he explores themes of belonging and addiction through sociological, scientific and visual dialogues. His work often looks at clubbing and natural environments, to unravel truths about our current condition and need for connection. His work has been screened at Atlas Arts (skye), The Royal Scottish Academy (Edinburgh), Limerick Institute of Technology, and online for Lift off Festival, and Film and Video Umbrella. Following his first commission from Film and Video Umbrella in 2020, Mac has done residencies at Cove Park and Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop. In 2021 Mac was shortlisted for the Royal Scottish Academy Morton Award.\n\nA voice describes the relationship between two young neighbours and their encounter with a mysterious woman that reveals an augury about future times.\n\nLuciana is an Argentinian born film director and photographer . Her main area of interest has been always the visual language. She started from an early age taking several courses on analogue photography and Super 8 film. She obtained her BA in Image and Sound Design at the University of Buenos Aires and a MA in documentary film directing at ULHT, SZFE and LUCA School of Arts as a scholarship student.

Nowadays, she is based in Brussels working on both personal and commissioned projects.\n\nDust is a story about two women living in an old district earmarked for demolition. Since their building is due to be demolished soon, all the neighbours have already left. Yet, the women decide to stay in their flat. The protagonists spend time in the abandoned multi-storey building and observe through the window bulldozers working around. Four out of five films were made in collaboration with Ms. Zou and Ms. Huang from Daguan in Taipei. When the project was in production, their houses in Daguan were bound for demolition while Ms. Zou, Ms. Huang together with their neighbours kept fighting against the evictions in the district. The first two films are a fictive story staged with Ms. Zou and Ms. Huang in an empty building awaiting demolition in central Taipei. I entered the building, cleaned up and furnished one chosen flat to turn it into a friendly liveable space and used it as a film location. Another two films are a conversation between Ms. Zou and Ms. Huang, Ms. Huang singing a sad song which reminds her of home and an image of a Daguan streets. The last film is a documentation of the demolition of the house where the first two films were made. One month after the films were done, Ms. Zou and Ms. Huang were forced to move away and Daguan was demolished.\n\nKarolina Bregu?a (b. 1979) is a visual artist, a graduate of the National Film School in ?ód?. She creates films, photographs, installations and performance. Her work explores the problems of the status of the artwork and the materiality of art objects. She critically scrutinises contemporary art and its reception. She creates stories about art and architecture, which are a field of her anthropological and sociological observations. She is interested in the connection between art and reality – the favourable and detrimental effect of artists’ work, the remedial and destructive force of artistic activity, rituals connected to art and art’s social role. Many of her works are co-created with their protagonists and participants, blurring the border lines between professional and amateur artistic activity. Her works have been exhibited at institutions such as National Museum in Warsaw, Jewish Museum in New York and MOCA Taipei and at international events such as Venice Art Biennale and Singapore Biennale. She is the winner of the second prize in the Views 2013 Deutsche Bank Foundation Award, the third Samsung Art Master 2007 award and the 2016 Golden Claw at the Gdynia Film Festival. Her works are included in collections such as Tokyo Photographic Art Museum, Zach?ta National Gallery of Art, Wroclaw Contemporary Museum and ING Polish Art Foundation. She is an associate professor at Academy of Art in Szczecin, she collaborates with lokal_30 Gallery. She lives in Warsaw.\n\nParis is not necessarily the first choice as the setting for a ghost story. The excessive romance of the French metropolis’ cultural symbols renders them simply unsuitable as backdrop for horror stories. But that’s not the case in Ella Raidel’s four-minute short film, which arose in the course of her extensive research project Of Haunted Spaces and refers to an upcoming feature film project. In We’ll always have Paris, the Eifel Tower, Champs-Élysées, magnificent fountains, and trimmed hedges stand as faux French in the hazy rain of Tianducheng. The residential complex located in the suburbs of the Chinese megapolis Hangzhou is one of the countless, largely unpopulated pop-up sites that sprung up overnight through high-speed real-estate speculation. In Raidel’s film, the Eifel Tower is the anti-gravity center of a phantom zone furnished with stark high-rises, parking areas, and gardens—an urban proposition that amounts to nothing. As the camera focuses on the building clone and its surroundings from various perspectives, the film suddenly changes tone. A woman who at first is visible only from behind enters the urban planning remake. Through a construction site corridor, she enters a conference space, improvised by partition walls, from which the view of the tower’s base condenses to an image of the uncanny. Like the pastiche in Tianducheng, We’ll always have Paris also contradicts the logics of representation; the film itself becomes a simulation of an architecture film, of a capitalism critique, of a ghost story: as they say in the film classic Casablanca, \"We’ll always have Paris.\" But what do we have here? (Esther Buss)\n\nElla Raidel, is an Austrian filmmaker, artist and researcher who has lived in Taiwan for the past 20 years. In her interdisciplinary works – films, videos, research and discourses – she focuses on the socio-cultural aspects of globalization, urbanization and the representation of images. Her hybrid practice is to create a discursive space for filmmaking, art and research. She is currently Asst. Professor at NTU Singapore, lives and works in Singapore. In recent years, she has been concerned with China’s unprecedented growth and rapid urban changes, in experimenting with new documentary modes, narrations and methods. Raidel’s works has participated in international biennials, exhibitions, conferences, and presented at numerous International film festivals.\n\nOff the coast of a world in reconstruction, a voice whose source is unknown overhangs the city and sounds like an injunction. In resistance to this authoritarian diction, a new voice emerges. Cheikh Morad Djadja makes his way through this universe, he must go to the Taxiphone and leave his own encrypted message. \"Appel masqué\" is a song composed by Cheb Abdou in 1993, during the period of the black decade in Algeria. Like many of his songs, Cheb Abdou wrote and performed them under constant threat. Through his music, he opened a field of identity expression and gender affirmation, the etymology of the word Raï takes all its meaning. By returning to the traces of the birth of raï, Oran, I met Cheikh Morad Djadja a personality of this environment and successor of Cheb Abdou, it was a real immersion in the community of singers and musicians raï.The film was built around the taxi-phone representing this non-place of anonymous telecommunication and the impossibility of maintaining a message, an opinion within a contemporary society. Echoing the lyrics of the song ''Appel masqué'' by Cheb Abdou, \"#31# (Unknown call)\" is an approach somewhere between documentary, fiction and performance, where Cheikh Morad Djadja leads us on an existential quest, in a world in perpetual reconstruction, where this non-place allows him to leave a masked vocal message about his trans-identity.\n\nGhyzlène Boukaïla is a multimedia artist and director born in 1993 in Algiers. She lives and works between Algiers and Lille. Her artistic approach and sensitivity crystallizes in the breasts of a family of Algerian revolutionaries. Exploring certain issues related to post-colonialism, her approach explores new narratives related to socio-political and digital (re)evolutions by situating her practice at the interface of documentary/performance and post-human digital narratives.\n\n‘So Settler, Are You a Pioneer?’ captures the structures of a rapidly changing peripheral neighbourhood: material remains of an obsolete infrastructure, luxury apartments, and piles of bricks that once used to house people. The work re-assembles and digitally preserves sites that are often overlooked in tales of linear progress. The piece is a journey through distorted urban landscapes, an assemblage of partial perspectives. By adapting the cartographic technique of photogrammetry, Wouter aims to question the authorities who decide what is and what is not in focus.\n\nThrough unravelling tales of linear progression I seek to map out the blurriness of our world. By adapting and appropriating modern contemporary cartographic techniques, such as photogrammetry, and the use of aerial and satellite imagery. I aim to question the authority that decides what is and what is not in focus to re-orient and ignite curiosity. Currently I am active as an artist and graphic designer. Besides my individual practice I collobarate in communal projects, one being OUTLINE; a collective and publishing platform consisting of one other graphic designer and two photographers. Another one being Radio Voorwaarts which is a platfom for underground culture in Amsterdam. More recently: Verdedig Noord, an activist group fighting against gentrification in Amsterdam Noord.\n\nA man, inside his kitchen, is preparing his packed lunch. He has decided to visit The Brion Tomb, a monumental funeral complex, designed and built by the Venetian architect Carlo Scarpa, commissioned by Onorina Brion Tomasin, to honour the memory of the deceased and beloved relative Giuseppe Brion, founder and owner of the Brionvega company, located in the small cemetery of San Vito, in the hamlet of Altivole in the province of Treviso. Placed the food inside a polka dot plastic bag, we will find it walking inside the cemetery, observing with meticulous care the details designed by the Venetian architect, while in its silent head will resound the precious words pronounced by the architect in a conference held in the summer of 1978.\n\nLuca Ferri (Bergamo, italy, 1976), self-taught, since 2011 has been dedicating to the writing, photography and direction of films presented to italian and international festivals, such as atlanta film festival, biografilm festival, curta cinema, documenta madrid, fidocs, filmmaker, gent international film festival, indielisboa, queer lisboa, punto de vista, pesaro film festival, cinemambiente, poff, taipei film festival, thessaloniki documentary festival, vilnius short film festival, filmer le travail, videoex and in museums and art galleries, such as spazio forma meravigli (milan), mambo (bologna), macro (rome) and schusev state museum of architecture (moscow). In 2013 the national film library of Rome organizes a restrospetictive of his works. his first feature film abacuc, released in 2015, was presented at torino film festival and mar del plata festival de cine. In 2016 colombi was presented at 73rd venice festival in the orizzonti section. In 2018 his work dulcinea was selected at 71st locarno film festival in competition in the section signs of life while pierino was presented at 61st dok leipzig. In 2020 the house of love is presented at 70th berlinale in section forum, selected to take part in the competition berlinale documentary award and receives the mention to 34th teddy awards; his work sì is presented at 77th venice international film festival, orizzonti section. In 2021 his last work a thousand cypresses was presented at 67th international short film festival Oberhausen and at the 57th mostra internazionale del nuovo cinema di pesaro. won the award for best film at the 46th laceno d'oro in the section \"eyes on the city.\"\n\nCreated in collaboration with IRCAM, « So Blue » represents a false documentary on the trip of Elvis Presley to Minsk, Belarus in the 1960s. The basis and the main element of this video is a song created by me using the sound collage technique. I used a dozen fragments from different Elvis songs, changing the key, working with tempo and harmony to recreate his « unreleased song ». The lyrics were composed by the same method, using archetypal words and phrases, typical for songwriting of the 50 - 60s. The video also presents a collage made from fragments of the fictional film \"I'm 20\" by Marlen Khutsiev and from frames of documentary films about Minsk. This technique allowed me to create a video mystification about Elvis’s fictional travel to my hometown (Minsk). The cross between fictional and documentary cinema, between a sound collage and a false composition generates a hybrid work that provokes feelings of strangeness, deceiving the viewer about credibility of this work. This confusion gives place to the questioning from the part of the viewer concerning the documentary representation.\n\nLina Filipovich is an artist and musician based in Paris, France. Her works explore the relationship between audio and visuals and span a variety of media, including found footage films, experimental electronic music, painting, silkscreening and performance. Working with samples and loops, Lina Filipovich uses techniques of sound collage, musical montage, cut-up and appropriation.\n\nKatja’s generation was an experiment for the new Republic of Estonia. She was born in 1992 in Narva, in the Eastern part of Estonia bordering Russia. Her birth coincides with the creation of the new Republic of Estonia and she received Estonian citizenship. Katja's mother tongue is Russian, but her grandfather was Estonian and taught her the language at home. The film suggests several metaphors to describe the trauma of this generation - from Little Red Riding Hood to the keyword of experiment.\n\nFrench-Estonian, born in 1970 in Paris Eléonore de Montesquiou’s work revolves around the articulation between private and official histories, personal and national identities. It tackles the intricacies and ambiguities of living in the margins, based on her personal experience of up rootedness. Eléonore is primarily working with video, she tapes testimonies, creating prosthetic memories of repressed histories. In her documentary-informed works, her camera becomes the voice of these voiceless people. Her work is based on a documentary approach, translated in films, drawings and texts; it deals mainly with issues of integration/immigration/meaning of a nation in Estonia, giving voice to the Russian community. A few years ago, she started working with asylum seekers from French speaking countries in Estonia.\n\nIt opens in the dark, in a corridor; water is flowing ... Voices echo in these sewer tunnels; it is the abyss of Munich, under the river Isar. The voices tell fragments of stories: about vanished people, violence, memory loss—while the camera is now above ground, scanning the city’s façades, including those of the “Third Reich.” The city appears as a body winding its way through time, past and present. Like a thread through memories, a spiral runs through it: a shell, a whirlpool, the turn of a staircase, the ever-recurring voices of the past. The film is a collage: it jumbles traces of history and forms of nature, bringing images, voices and sounds from different sources to the same level. A story of living beings and living environments, of fossils which challenge our perception of time.\n\nBorn in Paris, she studied art and art history in Aix-en-Provence (1995-1998), moved to Berlin in 1998 and worked for a year as an assistant for artistic projects in Küntlerhaus Bethanien.

How can we see today, the monuments of the NOB (National Liberation War), what they represent to us in the context of the new division of fashion as well as changes in paradigm and ideology in the former Yugoslavia. Is a new reading possible without a nostalgic undertone? How to think about architectural and concrete structures in the 2000s? What is the relationship between monument and human, what is the relationship between monument and unbridled nature. What is the relationship between monuments and contemporary technology and contemporary art today? How much contemporary and how much tech addiction? How to reinterpret the artifacts of the anti-fascist struggle, but so that the monument of the NOB remains at the denotative level of meaning of the monument, that new meanings do not endanger the given basic meaning, the one that is. Creating narratives as a new reading and a new \"seeing\" and seeing of monuments and creating new visual realities.\n\nIgor Bošnjak (b. 1981 in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia) lives and works in Trebinje (Bosnia & Herzegovina).

The film ponders on this occurrence, as well as on the vanishing and forgetfulness of humans.\n\nMarko Tadic (1979) studied painting at the Accademia di Belle Arti, Florence.
