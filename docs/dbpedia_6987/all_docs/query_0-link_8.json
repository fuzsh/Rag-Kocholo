        "text": "1819 Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet is born on June 10 at Ornans, near Besançon, in Franche-Comté. His father, Régis Courbet (1798–1882), is a wealthy landowner; his mother, Sylvie (1794–1871), née Oudot, comes from an old local family. Gustave has four younger sisters: Clarisse (1821–1834), Zoé (1824–1905), Zélie (1828–1875), and Juliette (1831–1915).\n\n1831–37 Courbet attends the seminary in Ornans. In 1833 he begins receiving tuition in art at the seminary from Claude-Antoine Beau, a pupil of Antoine Jean Gros. In 1834 he produces his first painting to have survived, Portrait de jeune garçon.\n\n1837 Courbet attends the Collège Royale in Besançon. He takes courses in drawing given by Charles Antoine Flajoulot, a pupil of Louis David, at the local art academy.\n\n1839–43 In the fall Courbet moves to Paris. Though he probably does so in order to study law, he schools himself as an artist by copying works in the Louvre and receives tuition from Carl von Steuben and Nicolas Auguste Hesse. He also attends the private academies of Charles Suisse and Père Lapin. In 1841 he visits the seaside town of Le Havre for the first time. That year he also begins submitting work to the annual Salon exhibition in Paris.\n\n1844 After failing for three years in succession, he is included in the Salon for the first time, exhibiting the self-portrait Courbet au chien noir.\n\n1847 Courbet makes the acquaintance of philosopher, social theorist, and anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) and of writer Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867).\n\nIn September he travels to Belgium, probably in the company of writer Jules Champfleury (1821–1889). His son, Alfred Émile (1847–1872), is born. The mother, Virginie Binet (1808–1865), sits regularly for Courbet, who does not legally acknowledge his paternity.\n\n1848 Courbet does not participate in the February Revolution, but designs the headpiece of Le Salut public, a newspaper founded by Baudelaire, Champfleury, and Charles Toubin (1820–1891). He is a regular visitor to the Brasserie Andler, which is frequented by Realist writers and artists. The Salon is mounted without selection by jury: all paintings submitted are exhibited, including ten by Courbet.\n\n1849 Courbet receives a gold medal from the reinstituted Salon jury for Une après-dînée à Ornans, which is purchased by the French state.\n\n1850 Courbet submits nine paintings to the 1850–51 Salon. Thanks to the gold medal he was awarded the previous year the jury accepts all nine works, including the “trilogy of Realism”: Un enterrement à Ornans, Les Casseurs de pierre, and Les Paysans de Flagey revenant de la foire.\n\n1852 Virginie Binet leaves Courbet to settle with their son in Dieppe. Minister of the Interior Charles-Auguste, duc de Morny, purchases one of Courbet’s work, which is shown at the Salon.\n\n1853 In the fall Courbet travels in Switzerland, visiting Bern and Fribourg. Alfred Bruyas (1821–1877), the wealthy son of a Montpellier banker, purchases two of the three works by Courbet exhibited at the Salon. Henceforth one of the artist’s most important patrons, Bruyas commissions Tableau-solution from him in June. Two further portrait commissions will follow in 1854.\n\n1854 From May to September Courbet stays with Bruyas in Montpellier, where he paints La Rencontre and Le Bord de mer à Palavas.\n\n1855 The Exposition universelle in Paris includes eleven of the fourteen works submitted by Courbet. Outside the Exposition he mounts a solo exhibition in a specially erected “Pavilion of Realism.” The forty works on show there include L’Atelier du peintre.\n\n1857 He visits Brussels, then travels to Frankfurt am Main. The Salon jury accepts all six paintings submitted by him.\n\n1858–59 Courbet stays in Frankfurt until the spring of 1859 and, while there, hunts in the Taunus mountains.\n\n1860 “Wagner et Courbet” by Champfleury appears in the daily Courrier de Paris.\n\n1861 At the Salon Courbet shows hunting scenes, animal paintings, and landscapes. He receives an award again. He is a member of the committee selecting French contributions to the International Exhibition due to be held in London the following year. Some students ask Courbet to teach them, but the studio he opens for the purpose in December will close again in April 1862.\n\n1862 Courbet is represented at the International Exhibition in London by two paintings. He spends the summer in the Saintonge region. He paints mainly floral still lifes and landscapes.\n\n1864 He spends most of the year at Ornans, where he paints many landscapes.\n\n1865 The artist spends September to November at Trouville, where he meets Claude Monet (1840–1926) and James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834–1903)\n\n1866 Courbet is commissioned by diplomat Khalil-Bey (1831–1879) to paint Le Sommeil. Courbet also paints L’Origine du monde for him.\n\n1867 During the Exposition universelle he again organizes a separate exhibition, featuring more than one hundred of his works; at the Exposition itself he is represented by four.\n\n1869 In August and September Courbet stays at Étretat in Normandy, where he paints coastal landscapes and pictures of the sea. In Munich an entire gallery is set aside for his work at the Internationale Kunstausstellung. King Ludwig II of Bavaria awards him the Knight’s Cross of the Order of St. Michael. In late September the artist paints five pictures in Munich.\n\n1870 Courbet is nominated for the Légion d’honneur, but refuses the honor in an open letter.\n\nJuly 19: France declares war on Prussia.\n\nSeptember 1: Napoleon III is taken captive after the French capitulate at the Battle of Sedan.\n\nSeptember 4: The Third Republic is proclaimed in Paris.\n\nSeptember 6: Courbet is elected President of the Commission des arts. He is to organize the safeguarding of Paris’s art treasures until the end of hostilities.\n\nSeptember 14: He calls for the demolition of the Vendôme Column, erected to celebrate French victories in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nOctober 29: A convinced pacifist, he reads in public his “À l’armée allemande et aux artistes allemandes,” which calls for an end to the war.\n\n1871\n\nMarch 18: The Commune is established in Paris.\n\nApril 16: Courbet is elected to the council of the Paris Commune.\n\nMay 16: The Vendôme Column is dismantled by order of the Commune.\n\nMay 28: The Commune capitulates to the regular French army.\n\nJune 3: Courbet’s mother dies.\n\nJune 7: Courbet is arrested and charged with responsibility for the destruction of the Vendôme Column.\n\nSeptember 2: Found guilty of complicity in the demolition of the Vendôme Column, he is sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of 500 francs.\n\nSeptember 22: He is committed to Sainte-Pélagie prison in Paris. Health problems cause him to be transferred on December 30 to a clinic in Neuilly, where he remains until the following April.\n\n1872\n\nMay 1: On returning to Paris, Courbet finds that his studio has been looted in his absence. He spends May to September in Ornans and its environs. With the help of his assistants Cherubino Pata and Marcel Ordinaire he produces many views of Ornans, along with snow landscapes and seascapes.\n\n1873\n\nCourbet’s court case is reopened.\n\nMay 30: The National Assembly votes to reerect the Vendôme Column. Work is to begin when the sum to be paid by Courbet in restitution has been specified. All his property is confiscated.\n\nJuly 23: Courbet goes into exile in Switzerland, settling at La Tour-de-Peilz, on Lake Geneva, in October. He starts painting views of Chillon Castle and Lake Geneva.\n\nHe shows a selection of paintings, including L’Atelier du peintre, at the Austrian Art Association during the World’s Fair in Vienna.\n\n1874–75\n\nJune 26, 1874: Courbet alone is declared legally responsible for destroying the Vendôme Column. The judgment is confirmed on August 6, 1875.\n\n1876\n\nCourbet vainly attempts to obtain a pardon from the new republican government."
