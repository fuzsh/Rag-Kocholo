        "text": "Pablo Picasso\n\nPablo Ruiz PicassoÂ (25 October 1881 â 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor,Â printmaker,Â ceramicist, andÂ theatre designerÂ who spent most of his adult life inÂ France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding theÂ CubistÂ movement, the invention ofÂ constructed sculpture,Â the co-invention ofÂ collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are theÂ proto-CubistLes Demoiselles d’AvignonÂ (1907) and the anti-war paintingÂ GuernicaÂ (1937), a dramatic portrayal of theÂ bombing of GuernicaÂ by German and Italian air forces during theÂ Spanish Civil War.\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci\n\nLeonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452Â âÂ 2 May 1519) was an ItalianÂ polymathÂ of theÂ High RenaissanceÂ who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known forÂ his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, andÂ paleontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who epitomized theÂ Renaissance humanistÂ ideal,[4]Â and hisÂ collective worksÂ comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporaryÂ Michelangelo\n\nVincent Van Gogh\n\nVincent Willem van GoghÂ (Dutch:Â [ËvÉªnsÉntÂ ËÊÉªlÉÉ±Â vÉÅÂ ËÉ£Éx]Â â;[note 1]Â 30 March 1853Â â 29 July 1890) was a DutchÂ Post-ImpressionistÂ painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created approximately 2100 artworks, including around 860Â oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They includeÂ landscapes,Â still lifes,Â portraitsÂ andÂ self-portraits, and are characterised by bold, symbolic colours, and dramatic, impulsive and highly expressiveÂ brushworkÂ that contributed to the foundations ofÂ modern art. Only one of his paintings was known by name to have been sold during his lifetime. Van Gogh became famous after his suicide at age 37, which followed years of poverty and mental illness."
