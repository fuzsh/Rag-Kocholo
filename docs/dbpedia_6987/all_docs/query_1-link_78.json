        "text": "Investigating the Authenticity and Attributions of works of art believed to be by;\n\nRene Francois Ghislain Magritte\n\nRenÃ© Magritte\n\n(1898-1967)\n\nBELGIAN\n\nI will not venture into a biography of the artists life here as it is perectly well documented by others, Britannica being perfect:\n\n\"RenÃ© Magritte, in full RenÃ©-FranÃ§ois-Ghislain Magritte, (born November 21, 1898, Lessines, Belgiumâdied August 15, 1967, Brussels), Belgian artist, one of the most prominent Surrealist painters, whose bizarre flights of fancy, blended horror, peril, comedy and mystery. His works were characterized by particular symbolsâthe female torso, the bourgeois âlittle man,â the bowler hat, the castle, the rock, the window, and others.\n\nDemands are obviously high today from collectors and institutions for quality paintings and drawings by him and they often well exceed their auction estimates and expectations. But as they increase in value and his works are getting more and more scarce, it is important to be able to distinguish between those works actually executed by an artist, compared to those either 'claiming' to be by the artist, or a work that we are told is by him. And for that, you may need some help.\n\nThere are always going to be those replicated or repeated works made by others to identify and more possible and sometimes much more plausible authors to balance and consider in an artist attribution equation. There will also be paintings created by artists from within an artists direct circle and when you place those issues alongside works mistakenly believed to be by him, painted by one of his followers, artists who produced similarly themed paintings in the artists manner and style which could of course have been painted at any time after him, it can become complicated.\n\nAnd at this level, you have the regular deceptions. Those putting a signature on either an elemental straightforward copy of one of his known works, usually on old paper from a book, claiming it to be a preparatory study, or faking an entire work using comfortable and regular elements, and symbols, entirely created to deceive.\n\n***\n\nAs an international specialist fine art consultancy, with bases in the UK and Europe where we are perfectly placed to undertake our Modern and Old master European research archivally, we have been confidentially serving both private individuals and corporate clients around the world for over 45 years.\n\nIn so doing, we have been investigating both single works of art and complete collections for clients. Conducting in-depth authentication and legitimacy investigations and inquiries, as well as directing full academic and forensic investigations, with multilingual archival research, into the origins of all works of art, from different geographical regions and eras. We also scrutinize and research the provenance and ownership lineage for verification and client satisfaction.\n\nWe are able to assist and advise you in all fine art related matters, particularly issues of the authenticity and attributions of European art, including the works of RenÃ© Magritte and any works of art that you need assistance and advice with.\n\nA few examples of his works and those associated with this name appear below as illustrations.\n\nNote: No inference is made, nor is it intended as to the question of legitimacy here. Moreover these are an across the board representational view of the differing types of works that are and may in the future be offered and advertised for sale at auction internationally that you could need specialist advise on..\n\nStep one in the Art Authentication and Attribution process.\n\nThe Pre-Authentication Assessment\n\nL'Ã©valuation de prÃ©-authentification. La evaluaciÃ³n previa a la autenticaciÃ³n\n\nWe strongly advise clients before embarking on a full investigation of legitimacy or an artist or studio attribution inquiry, that it is wise to have an impartial preliminary assessment conducted first. One made to balance any issues that may be present that could make the longer term exercise unviable.\n\nThis is a professional advisory service that we provide, based upon the images you supply, the full details of work of arts acquisition, its history and provenance as is known to you, along with sight of any documentation, previous research or analysis that you may have had formerly conducted on it. You should then have a far better understanding of both the prospects or any pitfalls we might face, before making a decision.\n\nThis is a logical and cost effective professional review and advisory for which there is a modest set fee.\n\nOur FAQ section covers this in more detail, or:\n\nCONTACT US\n\nCONTACTEZ NOUS\n\nWe will respond to you promptly.\n\nABOUT A WORK OF ARTS DESCRIPTOR AND TERMINOLOGY\n\n*It is very important to clearly understand the auction terms that are commonly used in any published descriptor and to be cautious of works that may just be created in the 'manner of' the artist, or those which could be variants of the artists works of art that 'bear a signature' or monogram. In this case as if they were defining the creations of the Belgian artist; Rene Francois Ghislain Magritte AKA: RenÃ© Magritte (1898-1967)\n\nWhere the name, RenÃ© Magritte (1898-1967), is given with the first name/s and surname of the artist, usually cited as, RenÃ© Magritte (1898-1967), including his dates to be specific, then in their qualified and professional opinion, they are in no doubt. It is a genuine and authentic item and one painted by that artist. This is usually fully qualified by its inclusion in any catalogue raissone, or by the guarantee of the opinion given by the appropriate and internationally recognized expert authority on the artist.\n\nWhen RenÃ© Magritte (1898-1967), is the term used, or it is similarly defined as Attrib. to ' [abbreviated,] or AttribuÃ© Ã , or ascribed to, then in their opinion it is 'probably' a work by the artist, at least in part. But... there is no guarantee. It is only an opinion that it 'possibly' may be by the artist.\n\nBut if the term RenÃ© Magritte (1898-1967) - circle of, entourage, or “Circle of RenÃ© Magritte ” is specifically used, then in their opinion, it is a work only of the period of the artist, but showing their influence. Or by someone closely associated with the artist, BUT not necessarily by their pupil or student.\n\nWhen the name is given thus; Painted in the “Style of RenÃ© Magritte ” or “Follower of RenÃ© Magritte is used, this means that in their opinion it is a work of art executed only in the artist’s way, their 'style', but not necessarily by a pupil. Yet it may be a contemporary, or nearly a contemporary of the artist.\n\nIf the phrase in the “Manner RenÃ© Magritte is used or is defined….” then in their opinion it is also only a work painted in the style of the artist, but of a later date and definitely not by the artist as named.\n\nWhen the term “After….RenÃ© Magritte \"; is the term used, then in their opinion it is a copy (made at any date) of an authentic and original work by the artist. This also applies to prints made 'after' an original work of art either by the artist or another artist/ printmaker.\n\nSigned - RenÃ© Magritte ; “Dated….” or “Inscribed RenÃ© Magritte ” Then in their opinion the work has been signed/dated/or inscribed by that specific artist. The addition of a question mark ? however, indicates a strong element of doubt.\n\nWhen the term 'Bears signature', is used or the name, RenÃ© Magritte is specified followed by the words; \"With signature ….”, or “With date ….” or “With inscription….” or “Bears signature of RenÃ© Magritte /date/or inscription” Then in 'their opinion,' either the signature / date / or inscription is spurious, forged or has been added by someone else other than the artist.\n\nWe can assist and advise you in all fine art related matters."
