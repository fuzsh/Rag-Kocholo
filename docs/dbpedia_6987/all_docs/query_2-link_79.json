        "text": "Gustave Courbet's painting The Origin of the World is a provocative icon of modern art. Painted in 1866 by an artist who shocked contemporaries with his tough depictions of real life, it can still shock today. It portrays a woman's thighs, torso, part of one breast – and, at the centre of attention, her genitals.\n\nArt historians have, quite frankly, gone nuts over this painting. It has been seen as anticipating the erotic humour of Marcel Duchamp, saying all kinds of things about gender, sexuality and voyeurism. The fact that it was once owned by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan has added to its aura of theoretical importance. But now it seems the painting's interpreters may have got carried away.\n\nA summary of the state of the art of understanding this work of art can be read on the website of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, which has owned it since 1995:\n\n\"Courbet regularly painted female nudes, sometimes in a frankly libertine vein. But in The Origin of the World he went to lengths of daring and frankness which gave his painting its peculiar fascination. The almost anatomical description of female sex organs is not attenuated by any historical or literary device …\"\n\nIn other words, the extreme selectivity of Courbet's viewpoint, the ruthless \"cropping\", removes this erotic image from any context that might soften or explain it, any echo of art history. That is what makes it so \"modern\", so much the origin, not merely of the world, but of extreme works of art such as Hans Bellmer's poupées.\n\nBut the picture has suddenly become more complicated. In a truly sensational discovery, the head of this previously faceless woman appears to have turned up. Apparently, French experts are satisfied that a newly found painting of a female head is not only by Courbet but is a fragment of the same canvas from which The Origin of the World was cut.\n\nSo Courbet did not ruthlessly portray just one part of a woman – he painted a full nude. It seems The Origin of the World is part of a painting that may originally have had a lot in common with Courbet's Woman with a Parrot (1866) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City.\n\nClearly the painting that included The Origin of the World was always bolder than Woman with a Parrot. The latter was intended for the official Salon exhibition, where its sprawled nudity was considered quite provocative enough. Courbet set out to be still franker when he painted The Origin in the same year. It was never going to be in any public exhibition. Instead the painting – or part of it – was sold to a Turkish aficionado of erotic art. Was it cut down to please him? Or was that Courbet's subversive idea?"
