        "text": "THE SURREALISTS\n\nThe Surrealist movement developed between the two world wars as a reaction to the horrors the European culture was living.\n\nSigmund Freud’s ideas about the unconscious were spreading. Surrealism became the language to express the unconscious, the worlds of dreams and fantasy through all artistic forms – literature, painting, film making etc.\n\nIn painting, the surreal, illogical dream motives were often painted with a very realistic style. The artists aimed at exploring their own fears, fantasies and dreams through painting, so different artists developed different styles and symbols.\n\nSalvador Dali (1904-1989)\n\nSalvador Dali is the first artist that comes to my mind when thinking of Surrealist art. My first encounter was in the Dali museum in Paris, which left an incredible impression. That is where I discovered not only his paintings, but also that he created sculptures and furniture as well .\n\nA few years later, I visited The Salvador museum in Barcelona , as well as his house in Portlligat by the coast. This is a picture of the museum in Barcelona:\n\n(Barcelonayellowcom. 2018. Barcelonayellowcom. [Online]. [17 May 2018]. Available from: https://www.barcelonayellow.com/day-tours/631-salvador-dali-museum-barcelona)\n\nThe museum building already transport you to a different reality with the iconic eggs all around the walls and towers. The house where Dali lived and painted also has several towers with eggs, some that you can climb into, and a lot of other peculiar objects the artist collected.\n\nEggs – a symbol for fertility, the circle of life or unhatched potential- is just one of the many symbols Dali used in his art. Clocks, ants, crutches, long-legged elephants, and snails appear frequently in all his paintings, photography and films.\n\nMany of the recurring symbols in Dali’s work are explained on the following website https://www.thedaliuniverse.com/en/salvador-dali/symbols. I found understanding the meaning of Dali’s symbols opened up to appreciating his art better.\n\n(Thedaliuniversecom. 2018. Thedaliuniversecom. [Online]. [17 May 2018]. Available from: https://www.thedaliuniverse.com/en/salvador-dali/symbols)\n\n“The sense of speed” from 1931 is one of my favorite paintings by Dali. I like the emptiness, the space and the simplicity of this painting. Time and memory is represented both by the clocks and by the long shadows of the trees, that remind me of a solar clock. There is a dark atmosphere, or something slightly threatening here, despite the openness of the landscape and the sunshine, but it is not so obviously frightening as many other paintings by the artist.\n\n(Image from: Salvador-daliorg. 2018. Salvador-daliorg. [Online]. [17 May 2018]. Available from: https://www.salvador-dali.org/en/artwork/catalogue-raisonne/1930-1939/386/the-sense-of-speed)\n\n“The persistance of memory” from 1931 is probably the most famous panting by Dali, and his melting clocks have practically become a symbol for surrealism. In themselves they of course represent time, and how time has become omnipresent, devouring itself and everything.\n\nThere is an interesting mix of humour and despair, death and decay in this painting. There are ants crawling over one of the clocks- symbolizing death and decay.\n\n(Image from: https://www.salvador-dali.org/en/artwork/catalogue-raisonne/1930-1939/265/the-persistence-of-memory)\n\nMax Ernst (1891-1976)\n\nThe German artist Max Ernst was one of the founders of the Dada group. The Dada movement originated in Switzerland also as a protest to the discrepancy between the horrors of the war and the “slumber” the Modern Art world was in, not reflecting the reality of the times. It was anti- aestetic, nihilistic and designed to be shortlived- a wake up call.\n\nLater Max Ernst became another pioneer of the Surrealist movement.\n\nMax Ernst’s “Elephant Celebes” from 1921 has also become an icon of the Surrealist movement.\n\nI find Max Ernst paintings more difficult to access. They are absurd, but I don’t find the same dreamlike connection as to Dali’s paintings.\n\nThe “Anti pope” from 1941 is said to be biographical, showing Max Ernst relationship to two women. I think there are so many different layers and stories in this painting that everyone can read another relationship into it. The feeling I am left with is unease, the scene and figures are captivating and repulsive at the same time.\n\n(Both images from: Max-ernstcom. 2018. Max-ernstcom. [Online]. [17 May 2018]. Available from: http://www.max-ernst.com/)\n\nGeorgio di Chirico (1888-1978)\n\nThe Italian artist Georgio de Chirico created dreamscapes from traditional piazzas, where he distorted the perspective and tilted the ground. Statues, geometrical shapes and long shadows are recurring elements.\n\n(Images from: Momaorg. 2018. Momaorg. [Online]. [17 May 2018]. Available from: https://www.moma.org/artists/1106)\n\nHere too, there is a threatening, claustrophobical atmosphere, that leaves a sensation of unease. The parts of the paintings are majestic, huge, heavy and I feel vulnerable and small looking at them.\n\nDuring my recent visit to Museu Colecao Berardo in Belem, Portugal, I discovered some other Surrealist painters .\n\nThis is “La Rencontre” by French artist Jacques Herold from 1936.\n\nI am quite fascinated by these flesh like intertwined forms with some remotely human resemblance.\n\nKurt Seligman’s “Magic Mountain” from 1949 is a more chaotic dance of geometric forms and soft creature like shapes , seemingly flowing in space:\n\nAnd I find this painting called “Talking picture” from 1957 absolutely brilliant:\n\nIn many cultures, the deer s antlers are a symbol of devotion or of spiritual authority. There is a loudspeaker attached to the painting with a radio tuned into a local radio station. So Man Ray gave up the authority over what sound is going to come out of the painting- right now it is playing Portuguese pop music!\n\n( The last 3 images my own photos from the museum)\n\nEMOTIONAL and SUBJECTIVE LANDSCAPE\n\nFor emotional and subjective landscape paintings, we are looking at the British modern painters Paul Nash and Graham Sutherland. They had both been official war painters, commissioned to paint not only facts but what the war felt like. Paul Nash worked on very large series of drawings and paintings of the muddy front he had experienced, and the landscape destroyed by war. Graham Sutherland was commissioned to paint heavy industry and coalmines, as well as scenes from London after the bombings.\n\nPaul Nash (1889-1946)\n\nPaul Nash managed to convey a sense of beauty and peace in this totally destroyed landscape. And then let the title “We are making an new world” add ironic humour.\n\n“Dead sea” is a sea of crashed battle planes, where you can also sense the eerie silence and calm after the total destruction:\n\n(Images from: Tate. 2018. Tate. [Online]. [29 May 2018]. Available from: http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/paul-nash/context-comment/articles/paul-nash-war-artist)\n\nI admire how Paul Nash’s view transforms these scenes of horror into beautiful landscapes. I feel the harmony of the forms and the colours, the sense of depth and composition. I realize how learning how to paint myself now, alters my look at these works, which I have not been able to appreciate in the same way before.\n\nGraham Sutherland (1903-1980)\n\nI encountered this interesting short Youtube clip about Graham Sutherland, that I find worth sharing: Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBrsEQsgpME\n\nGraham Sutherland really focused on the emotions of the scenes he painted. I chose these two paintings as beautiful examples how the scene becomes reduced to shapes and colour :\n\n(Images from: Tate. 2018. Tate. [Online]. [21 May 2018]. Available from: http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/graham-sutherland-om-2014)\n\nThis landscape in orange and blue is my favorite painting. I love the reduced shapes and colours, with a few lines indicating the shapes of the land. Another reminder for me to reduce more and focus on form and colour intead of getting lost in details or the wish to be realistic.\n\n(Image from: Artnetcom. 2018. Artnetcom. [Online]. [29 May 2018]. Available from: http://www.artnet.com/artists/graham-sutherland/landscape-orange-and-blue-987Cwy5Tc2-_foj-XCeBEQ2)\n\nI found it interesting to note, that Graham Sutherland used prints and watercolours for the first part of his career and only started painting in oil in the 1940’s.\n\nSutherland was also commissioned to paint several portraits during the 1950s, the most famous that of Winston Churchill, which Churchill really didn’t like and which has mysteriously disappeared.\n\nGERMAN EXPRESSIONISTS\n\nThe German Expressionist movement emphasized intense personal expression, so it is more difficult to describe the style as it varied greatly from artist to artist. Unifying traits were that forms were simplified, limbs distorted and sometimes really bright, bold colours were used. One common aim was to startle the viewer, and to move away from the rules and traditions that prevailed at the turn of the 20 th Century.\n\nEmil Nolde (1867-1956)\n\nI have never really appreciated Emil Nolde’s work before, and now I find myself fascinated! His use of colour is so bold and his skies are wild and explosive.\n\n(Images from :Wikiartorg. 2018. Wwwwikiartorg. [Online]. [17 May 2018]. Available from: https://www.wikiart.org/en/emil-nolde/all-works)\n\nI want to experiment painting this boldly right away!\n\nMax Pechstein (\n\nAnother artist of the German expressionist movement that I am discovering again, is Max Pechstein. He is maybe most known for his woodcuts, and paintings inspired by primitive art, but I have found some inspiring landscapes paintings.\n\nAgain, it is the really bold choice of colour that fascinates me.\n\nHe leaves more details than Emil Nolde. I especially like the composition with the low viewpoint in front of the field in the painting on the right.\n\n(Images from:Wikiartorg. 2018. Wwwwikiartorg. [Online]. [17 May 2018]. Available from: https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-pechstein/all-works)\n\nTHE SYMBOLIST MOVEMENT\n\nFollowing Impressionism, the Symbolist movement developed in the late 19 th century. Totally contrary to the aim of the Impressionists to depict the very essence of what they see, the Symbolists were expressing emotions, spirituality, fantasy, dreams, sexuality, the mystical, the occult.\n\nGustav Klimt (1862-1918)\n\nI believe the most well known painting by Gustav Klimt must be “the Kiss”, which I still really admire, despite having seen it in innumerable prints:\n\nKlimt really has a unique style of patterned details and the use of gold leaf. His figures are often depicted in erotic poses .\n\nThe “Tree of life” is another painting that I have seen so often reproduced. The colourful pieces of patterns and little creatures with eyes are parts recurring in many paintings.\n\nI enjoyed discovering landscape paintings by Klimt that I was less familiar with:\n\nThese are extremely detailed and closer to Impressionism in style, but clearly with an element of imagination and playfulness.\n\n(Images from: Klimtgalleryorg. 2018. Klimtgalleryorg. [Online]. [11 June 2018]. Available from: https://www.klimtgallery.org/biography.html)\n\nGustave Moreau (1826-1898)\n\nGustave Moreau was one of the main figures in the French part of the Symbolist movement. He painted allegories or scenes from mythology but also often in dramatic, dynamic and/or erotic poses. The style is more classical than the other painters I have been writing about here, and I personally find it less interesting. I chose this painting for the gentle background with blending blue greens and browns that I find more interesting than the figures in the center.\n\nThis painting has more of a dream like character and a more modern style, which gives it another freshness that I enjoy:\n\n(Images from: Wikiartorg. 2018. Wwwwikiartorg. [Online]. [11 June 2018]. Available from: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-moreau)\n\nLeon Bakst (1866-1924)\n\nLeon Bakst worked primarily with costumes and stage sets for ballet, originally in his native Russia, but after 1910 in Paris and for some visits in the USA.\n\nHis drawings and paintings of the sets are beautiful and full of action, figures and animals. Like here,\n\n(Image from: Metmuseumorg. 2018. Metmuseumorg. [Online]. [11 June 2018]. Available from: https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2017/leon-bakst-designs-ballets-russes)\n\nMarc Chagall (1887-1985)\n\nMarc Chagall was another artist who created stage sets, already imagining the action and movement in his paintings.\n\nHe explored several styles , so I am not sure he would be called a Symbolist, but his paintings were poetic and dreamlike, telling stories from the Bible, intertwined with his own history.\n\n(My own photos)\n\nI had the beautiful chance to visit the Musee Marc Chagall in Nice, France last year- this is the shortlink to a separate blog post: https://wp.me/p94hP8-yi\n\nFrida Kahlo (1907-1954)\n\nFrida Kahlo is one of my favourite painters. Her visual language touches me deeply and I feel I could have similar visions or dreams. She mixes rather naive Mexican folk painting with realistic elements, like her own body, combined with elements of fantasy, dream, imagination.\n\nThis is the shortlink to a blogpost about self portraits for Part 3, where I looked at Frida Kahlo’s self portraits : https://wp.me/p94hP8-Gw\n\n(Image from: Museofridakahloorgmx. 2018. Museofridakahloorgmx. [Online]. [11 June 2018]. Available from: http://www.museofridakahlo.org.mx/esp/1/frida-kahlo/obras/obras-del-museo).\n\n“Marxism will give health to the ill” from 1954, is another self portrait, with the painful metal corset Frida Kahlo had to wear after an awful accident, but also a divided earth, and a political message from Marx. Her paintings always seem to contain stories within stories within dreams.\n\nThis research has shown so many different expressive ways of painting landscape. I feel a new sense of freedom in the way I can approach the exercises, allowing for more play and personal voice and less reality."
