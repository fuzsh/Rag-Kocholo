        "text": "1921\n\nBorn in Amsterdam, The Netherlands on April 25th.\n\n1939\n\nAs a young artist he is influenced by Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass and later by Comte de Lautréamont's The Songs of Maldoror and the teachings of Krishnamurti.\n\n1942 - 1944\n\nStudies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Amsterdam.\n\n1946\n\nVisits Denmark, where he meets the Danish painters who will later become members of the Cobra group.\n\n1947\n\nAbundant production of works; Appel develops a new style of assemblage using elements of wood and found objects in relief, and introduces elements of narrative representation.\n\n1948\n\nOn July 16, Appel and a group of young Dutch artists set up the Dutch Experimental Group in Amsterdam.\n\nThe Group publishes the periodical Reflex and some months later merges with the Danish and Belgian artists to become the International Cobra group. It is founded on November 8, at the Café de l'Hotel Notre Dame in Paris, by Dotremont and Noiret (Belgium), Jorn (Denmark), Appel, Constant and Corneille (The Netherlands). Later, Alechinsky (Belgium) joins the group.\n\nAt this time, Appel creates his objets poubelles (rubbish objects). These junk and found objects usually centre on a theme, which is openly poignant and characteristically expressionistic. For example, in the Vragende Kinderen (Questioning Children) of 1948-49, the innocence of children's masks confronts an oppressive and hypocritical society.\n\n1949\n\nPublication of the periodical Cobra, edited by Jorn and the Belgian poet Christian Dotremont. Jorn also publishes a series of small monographs under the title Bibliothèque de Cobra.\n\nLike Dubuffet, Appel and the Cobra artists reject the enlightened and rationalist western past, and momentarily shelve their faith in reason, due to the destruction of civilized values in World War II (thus echoing the Dadaist response after World War I). Like Dubuffet, Giacometti, and Bacon as well, the Cobra group pursues astonishingly diverse formal explorations as a comment upon the human condition rather than the abstract pictorial values, which had so oppressively dominated the post-Mondrian, Constructivist era in Europe in the late thirties. The Dutch Cobra painter, Constant, wrote: \"We were aware that we had cut ourselves off from the past and enjoyed unfettered freedom. Only primitive people, children, and psychopaths could reckon on our sympathy\".\n\nIn May, the three Dutch founding artists return to Paris, where the French painter Jacques Doucet introduces them to the Colette Allendy Gallery.\n\nAppel becomes close friends with Dotremont, whom he continues to see until Dotremont's death in 1978.\n\nAppel repeats the theme of Vragende Kinderen in the mural for the cafeteria of the Amsterdam City Hall. After public outcry, the city council orders the mural to be whitewashed. Architect Aldo van Eyck publishes Een appèl aan de verbeelding (An Appeal to the Imagination) in defense of Appel's work. For ten years the mural remains hidden under a layer of wallpaper.\n\n“International Exhibition of Experimental Art”, the first Cobra exhibition in Amsterdam is held at the\n\nStedelijk Museum organized by Willem Sandberg and designed by architect Aldo van Eyck.\n\n1950\n\nThe turning point for the Cobra movement takes place when Michel Ragon becomes their spokesperson. In Paris, Ragon organizes the first exhibition of the Cobra group at the Librairie 73 in February 1951, followed by a show at the Galerie Pierre two months later.\n\nTogether with Constant and Corneille, Appel leaves Holland and settles in Paris, where they meet the Danish painter Jorn.\n\nForemost among Appel's friends during his Parisian period is Hugo Claus, the Flemish poet, novelist and playwright. In 1962, Claus writes an extensive study on Appel's work, published by Harry Abrams Inc., New York.\n\n1951\n\nAppel meets the avant-garde art critic Michel Tapié, who curates a show at the Nina Dausset Gallery in Paris including American artists such as Pollock and DeKooning and other European painters such as Dubuffet, Wols and Hartung. Tapié later introduces Appel to the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York.\n\nAppel participates in the exhibition entitled Significance of the Informal organized by Michel Tapié.\n\nAs compensation for the covered mural in the Amsterdam City Hall, the city counsel commissions Appel to paint the foyer of the auditorium of the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, thereafter known as “Appel-bar”.\n\n1952\n\nIn breaking with his Amsterdam youth, Appel rapidly detaches himself from the Cobra group and becomes part of a group of artists known as Art Informel or Art Autre. Centred on Michel Tapié, the group includes artists such as Henri Michaux, Willem DeKooning, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Jackson Pollock and Sam Francis. Appel is the only artist from the Cobra group.\n\nIn the Art Autre period Appel’s associates are more often poets than painters.\n\n1953\n\nMartha Jackson visits Appel's studio where she buys several of his works. This marks the beginning of a relationship that continues for more than twenty years.\n\nHe spends two summers in Albisola on the Italian Riviera, where he acquires the technique of ceramics. He makes a series of sculptures in terra-cotta, based on the human head.\n\n1954\n\nMichel Tapié organizes a one-man exhibition at Studio Paul Facchetti, Paris.\n\nFirst exhibition in America is held at the Martha Jackson Gallery, New York.\n\n1955\n\nAppel meets the architects Van den Broek and Bakema, who commission him to paint a 100 meter-long brick wall called Wall of Energy for the exhibition entitled “E’55” (Energy ’55) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\n1956\n\nCommissioned by the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam to make a mural for its new restaurant, Appel uses stained glass for the first time.\n\nLater on the architect Bart van Kasteel commissions Appel to make six stained glass windows for the Kruis Church in Geleen, illustrating the Genesis.\n\n1957\n\nTravels to the United States and Mexico. Appel is already aquainted with the work of the Mexican painter Tamayo, whom he befriended in Paris, were they both lived.\n\nMeets the painters of the Abstract Expressionist avant-garde and is inspired by the jazz musicians, whose portraits he paints later that year: Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan.\n\n1958\n\nCommissioned by architects Breuer, Zehrfuss and Nervi, Appel paints Des oiseaux et des animaux, rencontre avec le printemps which is mounted as a mural in the restaurant of the UNESCO building in Paris.\n\n1959\n\nCommissioned by the Italian industrialist Paulo Marinotti, Appel makes a “mural” of cloth for the exhibition Vitalità nell'Arte at the Palazzo Grassi, Venice.\n\nThrough the 60s and the 70s, Appel continues his collaboration with Van den Broek and Bakema and other architects on projects for private and public buildings. Some forty projects are related to architecture for which Appel used different techniques such as painted murals, marble and ceramic tiles, glass-in-concrete-reliefs and stained glass.\n\n1960\n\nWhile spending the summer on the estate of Jean Larcade in Nice, France (Appel's Paris dealer since 1955), Appel executes a series of sculpture from the roots of olive trees. These works are much more gestural than his earlier sculptures. His excited paintmarks make the surface of the exposed wood seem even more raw and are enough to transform the trunks into abstract sculpture.\n\n1961\n\nThe Dutch film director, Jan Vrijman, makes a documentary film about the artist in Paris, The Reality of Karel Appel, with music by Dizzy Gillespie and Karel Appel.\n\n1962\n\nPublication of A Beast-Drawn Man, a portfolio with text by Bert Schierbeek and lithographs by Appel.\n\n1963\n\nAppel divides his time between Rome and Paris.\n\nHe begins engaging in various experiments, such as inserting real objects in his paintings. These experiments with assemblage and mixed media pave the way for the lively and colourful sculptures, which he will later make.\n\nReferences to landscape constitute the second significant theme of his iconography, making folk art central to his imagination.\n\nGraphic elements linked to the technique of collage appear in several other works.\n\nAppel and Hugo Claus collaborate on a larger than life scaled book entitled Love Song published by Harry N. Abrams, New York. The great kinship between Claus's literary work and Appel's pictorial oeuvre is evident in this collaboration.\n\n1964\n\nAcquires and completely renovates the Château of Molesmes near Auxerre in France.\n\n1965\n\nBegins large polychrome reliefs and free-standing figures made from cut-out plywood, which he assembles in layers, padding many with expanded polystyrene.\n\n1969\n\nBetween 1969 and 1971, Appel undertakes a series of cut-out assemblages of painted wood on canvas which he calls \"psychological relief-portraits\".\n\n1970\n\nRecords music compositions in collaboration with Chet Baker, Merrill Sanders and other musicians and singers in San Francisco.\n\n1971\n\nMakes his first large-scale sculptures in polychrome aluminum.\n\n1972\n\nAppel settles again in Paris.\n\nThroughout 1972 and 1973 he travels through South America, Mexico, India, Nepal, Indonesia, and Japan.\n\n1974\n\nBegins regularly employing extra-light materials, such as plastic foam and cubes of polyurethane which he carves, molds and paints, giving it the appearance of wood and the solidity of marble.\n\n1976\n\nLeaves the Château de Molesmes.\n\nCreates murals with the shantytown residents of Villa El Salvador near Lima, Peru. A color film is made of this event.\n\nA collaboration with Pierre Alechinsky results in a series of works on paper which appear to be a complete symbiosis. These works are published together with poems by Hugo Claus in the book entitled Encre à deux pinceaux (Two Brush Paintings).\n\n1977\n\nTakes up residence in the South of France.\n\nBegins a series of paintings using a flat brush in rectangular strokes, rhythmically arranged across the canvas, depicting landscapes, still lifes, trees and later, figures. In these works Appel finds himself working with a new, more disciplined style of controlled, heavily emphatic and patterned brushstrokes.\n\n1980\n\nAppel begins his series of window paintings. In these compositions, he produces the most abstract and contemplative paintings to date.\n\nAt the same time he makes several works using orange crates. These rather discrete and somewhat aesthetic works stem from his thoughts about painting.\n\n1982\n\nHe collaborates with the writer José Arquelles and the poet Allen Ginsberg, in creating a series of paintings and visual poems, which are later exhibited as part of On the Road: The Jack Kerouac Exhibit\" at the Boulder Center for the Visual Arts, Colorado.\n\n1983\n\nBegins a new series of paintings in which color has a vivid life, freedom and potency of its own, establishing a new theater of action; color generates form and subject matter and is liberated from drawing.\n\nThe Gemeentemuseum Den Haag receives a large group of early drawings.\n\n1985\n\nBegins the Nude Series on paper depicting predominantly reclining nudes on a grand scale.\n\n1987\n\nThe Paris Opera commissions Appel to conceive and design the ballet Can We Dance A Landscape?, which is performed in collaboration with the Japanese dancer and choreographer Min Tanaka and the Vietnamese composer Dao.\n\n1988\n\nDuring the summer, Appel visits China.\n\n1989\n\nCan We Dance A Landscape? is performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Next Wave Festival, New York.\n\nCollaborates with the children of Hiroshima to make a mural for their city.\n\n1990\n\nCollaborates with Min Tanaka at the Summer Art Festival in Hakushu, Japan.\n\n1991\n\nCreates Poetry-Painting Series with Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso.\n\nAppel's third period of sculpture production begins in the early nineties. They are a statement of his ideas and imagery, each a kind of \"Gesammtkunstwerk\", that is architecture, painting and sculpture combined. They are constructivist as well as expressionist and reveal a classical sense of dignity in their proportions.\n\n1994\n\nCommissioned by De Nederlandse Opera, Appel creates the scenic concept for the opera Noach by the young Dutch composer Guus Janssen, and the librettist Friso Haverkamp. Again he asks Min Tanaka to collaborate.\n\nCan We Dance a Landscape? is performed at Het Muziek Theater, Amsterdam.\n\nHe takes up the theme of the nude in his paintings, focussing this time on the moving figure, the use of strong color in quick-tempered vigorous strokes, and on a condensed scale.\n\n1995\n\nPaints a series of landscapes from nature in Tuscany.\n\nCommissioned by De Nederlandse Opera, Appel creates the scenic concept for Mozart's The Magic Flute in collaboration with Min Tanaka, the director Pierre Audi and lighting technician Jean Kalman.\n\nA documentary film If I Were a Bird is made of the artist, directed by Mat van Hensbergen.\n\n1997\n\nDivides his time between Toscany, where he paints large scale landscapes and the United States, where he continues to make sculptures.\n\nAppel donates to the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam a group of sculptures from the Cobra period.\n\n2000\n\nPaints The Will to Power of the Planets, a series of paintings in which Appel primarily concerns himself with the luminacity of the light. This series is shown during the summer at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.\n\n2001\n\nThree Dutch museums, the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the Cobra Museum, Amstelveen and the Haags Gemeentemuseum, The Hague celebrate Karel Appel’s 80th birthday with exhibitions.\n\n2002\n\nIn a series of non-figurative paintings Appel continues on the theme of the landscape. At the end of the year he starts with a series of assemblages, by adding objects to the canvas or placing them on the floor. These three-dimensional works are characterized notably by the use of tree branches, or stuffed animals. He continues this theme until 2004.\n\nA second group of drawings has been chosen by the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag for its collection.\n\nAs knowledge centre for Karel Appel’s work on paper , the Gemeentemuseum is keeping the\n\ngreater part of Karel Appel’s own drawing collection as a long-term loan.\n\nAnother group of sculptures (from 1991-1993) is added to the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam\n\n2003\n\nAppel makes a series of paintings, titled Victory of Matter which are later shown at the exhibition at\n\nthe Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. Throughout his career he always occupied himself with the\n\npossibilities of matter. In 1961 he wrote “When I paint, matter is my point of departure, because it\n\nhas been proven that matter is at least as rich in possibilities as the mind, if not richer”.\n\n2004\n\nAppel makes a series of paintings, titled Victory of Matter which are later shown at the exhibition at\n\nthe Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. Throughout his career he always occupied himself with the\n\npossibilities of matter. In 1961 he wrote “When I paint, matter is my point of departure, because it\n\nhas been proven that matter is at least as rich in possibilities as the mind, if not richer”.\n\n2005\n\nAppel returns once more to the theme of Nudes which results in a series of 5 paintings to which he\n\napplies wooden constructions holding fluorescent lamps. This series is shown during the summer\n\nmonths in the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag.\n\n2006\n\nOn May 3rd Appel dies at his home in Zürich.\n\nSolo Exhibitions :\n\n1953\n\nPalais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, Karel Appel, October 31 – November 11, 1953.\n\n1954\n\nMartha Jackson Gallery, New York, First American Exhibition, December 6 – 31, 1954.\n\nStudio Paul Facchetti, Paris, Appel, May 28, 1954.\n\n1955\n\nGalerie Rive Droite, Paris, Karel Appel, October 4 – 31, 1955.\n\nTravelling to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, November 1955.\n\n1957\n\nInstitute of Contemporary Art, London, Paintings Karel Appel, April 5 - May 4, 1957.\n\n1958\n\nPalais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, Appel, November 8 – 19, 1958.\n\n1961\n\nSan Francisco Art Museum, San Francisco, Karel Appel, West Coast Exhibiton, June 23 – July 23, 1961.\n\nTravelling to Pasadena Art Museum, August 1961.
