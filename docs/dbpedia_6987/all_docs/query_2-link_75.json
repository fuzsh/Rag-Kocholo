        "text": "Gustave Courbet, born at 10 June in 1819, named Jean Desire Gustave Courbet, a French plastic artist, is especially known as an innovator of realism.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nI will return to Gustave Courbet again, this time I will refer to one of the most controversial works, \"The Origin of the World\", a work that I had the opportunity to see life.\n\n\"L'Origine du monde\"( the French name of painting) is a picture painted in oil on canvas by the French artist Gustave Courbet in 1866.\n\n\"The Origin The World\" originated in the Orsay Museum only in 1995, being the first time the painting was revealed to the public. From the collection of Turkish diplomat Halil-Bey, who had an impressive collection of paintings that celebrated the woman's body, the painting arrived in the collection of psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, who kept it hanging on the wall, hidden through a slide system of another painting signed by Gustave Courbet, at Blonay Castle\n\nHe presented himself as a \"wild\" trying to fight for the cause of the crowd, trying to transpose this rebellion and artistically, wants to shock and shake the silence of the French society. What he would do in the late 1860s, when he made a series of paintings, including the \"Origin of the World\" (L'Origine du monde) in 1866, the works waking up among the French. Of course he is forbidden to expose them, or even to talk about them, which only increases his notoriety. Become the idol of young rebels, Courbet was likely to become the leader of a generation. It establishes a Federation of Artists, promoting free art and unrestrained censorship, being the best example. Among the members of the group were Andre Gill, Honore Daumier, Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Eugene Pottier, Jules Dalou, Monet."
