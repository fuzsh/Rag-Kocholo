        "text": "What is realism ?\n\nRealism is an art movement emerged in the mid-19th century primarily in Europe, as a reaction to “Romanticism”. It sought to depict naturalistic, almost photographic image onto canvas; often focusing on everyday life and ordinary people. Realist artists aimed to represent the world without any mythological figure or divine character, solely portray the world as it truly appeared.\n\nThe invention of photography in the middle of the 19th century had a profound effect on realism, as painters explored for fresh approaches to depicting reality in reaction to this emerging medium. In response to photography, artists also focused on subjects that were impossible for a camera to capture, like the play of light through leaves or on water, to which Impressionist brushwork provided an illusion of rapid movement and striking colour that was yet beyond the frame of the photograph. But the Impressionism movement is another topic that needs to be discussed.\n\nIf we want to talk about artists, the Gustave Courbet (1819–77), a prominent realist artist accepted as the pioneer of the movement also includes; Jean-François Millet, Honoré Daumier, and Winslow Homer."
