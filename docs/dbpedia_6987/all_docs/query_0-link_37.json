With text and illustrations by the artist Charles Matton, the book is configured as a complex intermedial object composed by all the three categories proposed by Irina Rajewsky: media combination, medial transposition and intermidial references, which happens to be the main focus of this study. The theoretical framework also relies on the studies of Walter Moser about the relations between arts and their medialities. Our goal is to identify these references – especially regarding painting and theater – in order to evaluate their role, through narrative descriptions, in the process of construction of literary tableaux vivants that centrally stage the act of painting\n\nThe painting of the nineteenth socialist \"prophet,\" Jean Journet, by Gustave Courbet had been lost for one hundred years until it was unexpectedly discovered in one of the caches of Hildebrand Gurlitt in November 2015. This paper explores the significance of this work of art as the \"keystone\" to an important series of works for the Salon of 1850, explaining the role of this work in constructing a political meaning for the audience of the post-revolutionary era. Now that the work has been found, it will be possible to discuss the painting and its meanings fully.\n\nA Conference paper. An attempt to understand the avoidance of interpretations in the late art historical works of the two authors. Question: What kind of an ideology is implicated in the demand for an art historical narrative, which would be laying claim to sensual experiences of images but dismissing all iconological practices? Presented in Image=Gesture: the 5th Nomadikon Meeting. Bergen 9.11.2011.\n\nIn November 2015 BBC News presented a brief commentary on the discovery of the hoard of Cornelius Gurlitt, son of a Nazi art dealer, Hildebrand Gurlitt. Among the recovered works of art was a painting by Gustatve Courbet, lost for a hundred years, \"The Portrait of Jean Journet.\" Created for this Salon of 1850, this painting vanished by 1914. This paper explores the ramifications of the return of this work upon art historical interpretations of Courbet as a political artist. For the first time in one hundred years, it is possible to fully reconsider the role the \"Portrait of Jean Journet\" played in the Salon that established Courbet's reputation as a \"Realist\" artist."
