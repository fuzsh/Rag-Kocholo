        "text": "This paper aims to discuss intermedial references in Courbet: L'Atelier du peintre [Courbet: The Painter's Studio], a work published by Marianne Nahon, under the light of intermedial studies. With text and illustrations by the artist Charles Matton, the book is configured as a complex intermedial object composed by all the three categories proposed by Irina Rajewsky: media combination, medial transposition and intermidial references, which happens to be the main focus of this study. The theoretical framework also relies on the studies of Walter Moser about the relations between arts and their medialities. Our goal is to identify these references – especially regarding painting and theater – in order to evaluate their role, through narrative descriptions, in the process of construction of literary tableaux vivants that centrally stage the act of painting\n\nIn November 2015 BBC News presented a brief commentary on the discovery of the hoard of Cornelius Gurlitt, son of a Nazi art dealer, Hildebrand Gurlitt. Among the recovered works of art was a painting by Gustatve Courbet, lost for a hundred years, \"The Portrait of Jean Journet.\" Created for this Salon of 1850, this painting vanished by 1914. This paper explores the ramifications of the return of this work upon art historical interpretations of Courbet as a political artist. For the first time in one hundred years, it is possible to fully reconsider the role the \"Portrait of Jean Journet\" played in the Salon that established Courbet's reputation as a \"Realist\" artist.\n\nMasaccio who frescoed some of the most famous scenes in the early 1400's. The chapel is dedicated to Saint Peter, the patron saint of the Brancacci family who commissioned the paintings, and most of the larger frescoes depict stories from Saint Peter's life. While much is known about St. Peter, Jesus, the disciples, and some of the more major people in the frescos, little is known about the identities of the other figures. Many of these figures wear hats or adornments on their heads and their purpose in the paintings is unknown. This essay argues that these hats signaled the social class or identity of those wearing them. Masaccio painted halos to illustrate the holiness of Jesus and disciples, small caps or no hats on the poor, and extravagant, colored hats on the heads of the political elite. The elite often disliked Jesus and his disciples because their actions disrupted the social order. In the Brancacci chapel frescos, men that are indifferent or oppositional to Saint Peter wear the most fanciful painted hats."
