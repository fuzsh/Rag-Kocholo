        "text": "At the moment the Metropolitan Museum of Art, always a paradise of painting, is more edenic than ever. In less than four weeks it has opened three large exhibitions, each devoted to a master of sublime strangeness. First Jasper Johns, then Nicolas Poussin and now Gustave Courbet.\n\nOf the three, Courbet’s art may be the strangest of all, and in a time when seemingly old-fashioned representational painting is thriving, his work has a striking pertinence. Courbet the man was deeply out of sorts, independent, ambitious, wily, perennially dissatisfied with his lot, in addition to being, as he himself put it, “the most arrogant man in France.” A Republican whose career flourished noisily during the oppressive regime of Napoleon III, he aroused suspicions when he grandly declined the cross of the Legion of Honor.\n\nThis show of around 130 paintings and a smattering of drawings has an appropriate sweep. It was organized by the Musée d’Orsay in Paris; the Musée Fabre in Montpellier, France; and the Met. Its selection and majestic installation at the Met is the work of Gary Tinterow, curator in charge, and Kathryn Calley Galitz, assistant curator, both of the museum’s department of 19th-century, Modern and contemporary art. Running from the early 1840s to the early 1870s, it includes portraits, self-portraits, landscapes, nudes, group scenes, animals and hunting scenes.\n\nThe best of these canvases convert Courbet’s inborn dissonance into a commanding discombobulation. They challenge and seduce with their brusqueness of surface, inconsistencies of space or scale, emotional ambiguities and alternately frank and improbable accounts of the female form. Some paintings barely hold together; others collapse inward into strange, shapeless masses.\n\nOne of the greatest of these masses is Courbet’s drowsy masterpiece  cleaned since it was last seen in New York, 20 years ago  “Young Ladies on the Banks of the Seine” of 1856-57. In it two reclining subjects form a pile of frothy garments, seemingly boneless female flesh, assorted flowers and moral lassitude set on a grassy riverside. The overt, possibly lesbian, eroticism that shocked viewers at the 1857 Salon remains palpable. So does the ebullient, almost taunting, hash of traditions, of public park with boudoir, of still life and figure painting, and most of all the way this hash is crowded from behind by a rough, strangely vertical plane of azure water. The whole lot might almost slide off the canvas, landing in a heap at our feet.\n\nCourbet virtually wrote the definition of the modern artist as a bohemian, narcissistic loner and political radical who shunned the academy, tutoring himself at the Louvre and living by the phrase “épater le bourgeois,” or “shock the bourgeoisie.” He emerged in Paris in the 1840s, when court patronage was long gone, but the modern art market was still in formation. He was quick to grasp the usefulness of three related, also nascent phenomena: newspapers, popular illustration and especially photography, with its new realism. This exhibition is dotted with vintage photographs by the likes of Gustave Le Gray, and others of landscapes, peasants and nudes, similar to those Courbet owned and undoubtedly sometimes used in his work.\n\nThe show also indicates that he was not above painting additional copies of works if demand justified them, and that some of his most beautiful landscapes depict popular tourist spots.\n\nCourbet is hailed as the founder of Realism, who willfully smashed the tidy boundaries separating established painting genres to record life as he saw it. He did this most famously in his murky manifesto, “The Burial at Ornans” (which the d’Orsay does not allow to travel), replacing sentimental stereotypes and strict social hierarchy with a ragged line of individualized villagers depicted on a scale usually reserved for history paintings.\n\nBut Courbet only grudgingly accepted the title of Realist. Even in front of his most realistic work, you often find yourself wrestling not so much with lived reality, as with the sheer  very real  uncanniness of painting itself. Observe the shifting veils of palette-knifed pigment in “The Stream of the Puits-Noir,” from 1855, which almost turn abstract. And Courbet’s is a continually shape-shifting uncanniness that mixes not only genres and styles, but also sexes, proportions and spatial logics with a subtle visual irony that might as well be called postmodern as modern.\n\nCourbet’s life story is a rousing read, with its early fame, recurring controversies and tragic end. In 1873 he fled to Switzerland to avoid reimbursing the French government for the reconstruction of the Place Vendôme Column. (It was destroyed during the short, chaotic rule of the Paris Commune, when he was in charge of protecting all things artistic, public monuments included.) He died there, bitter and broken, four years later.\n\nBut stick with the paintings. No artist before Picasso left so much of himself on canvas. The first large gallery, dominated by Courbet’s tall, dark and handsome self-portraits, provides an almost sickening dose of his high self-regard, dramatic flair and roving attention to the old masters, variously Italian, Spanish and Dutch.\n\nIn the earliest and smallest, he is a long-haired, wan Pontormo prince. In “The Desperate Man” he tears his hair, wide-eyed and wild, like Johnny Depp’s pirate rendered by Caravaggio. And in “Self-Portrait With Pipe” we see an early version of the disengaged gaze, at once dreaming and sardonic, that would characterize many of his images of women.\n\nThis first gallery forms a fascinating if claustrophobic show within the show, which makes it a relief to enter the expanded world of the second. Here Courbet reports on the countryside around Ornans  the eastern town where he was born and to which he frequently returned working his way from “The Château d’Ornans” of around 1850, which verges on the overwrought Rockwellian realism of Ernst Meissonier to “The Valley of Ornans,” from 1858, which has Corot’s gracious ease.\n\nThe second gallery also contains an astounding work of accidental Modernism: the unfinished “Preparation of the Bride/Dead Girl,” one of the big paintings of village life that Courbet tackled in the early 1850s. Here a roomful of women orbits around a young, limp girl being dressed by three of them. Other women make a bed, lay a tablecloth or straighten up.\n\nCourbet left this image of female community incomplete, painting over many of the forms with white, as if to rethink its color scheme. But the white imposes its own unity, coursing through the painting in subtly shifting shades like a common cause or shared feeling, softening its interactions, binding them together.\n\nThis show proceeds more thematically than chronologically, which makes sense because Courbet didn’t really proceed in a linear manner. He hopped around according to shifts in his interests, his attention span and the demands of his clients. His “Reclining Nude” of 1862 is a kind of joke on Titian: a rather loosely painted figure with Kewpie-doll knee socks surrounded by excesses of red velvet drapes and a brownish atmosphere. Next to it, the steamy giantesses of “Sleep,” from 1866, offer a vision of crystalline Rococo pinks and whites.\n\nThis work was a commission for Khalil-Bey, a Turkish-Egyptian diplomat, as was Courbet’s most confrontational work, the infamous “Origin of the World,” an unembellished close-up of a woman’s lower torso and open thighs . (The work is sequestered in a narrow space along with a nearly identical stereographic image by Auguste Belloc and several photograph of nudes. )\n\nThis painting resurfaced only in the 1980s, from the collection of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. More clinical than erotic, and more territorial than acquiescent, it identifies woman as proud possessor, revealing the ultimate object of the male gaze with a forthrightness that can stop the gaze in its tracks.\n\nMore than perhaps any painter of his great painting century, Courbet built elements of rebellion and dissent into the very forms and surfaces of his work. Some were on purpose; others were left for us to discover, to feel in our bones. Even at the end he expressed his defiance in still lifes of fruit that seem impossibly large and overbearing, like him, and in magnificent trout hooked and struggling against the line, even more like him. Since then, generation upon generation of painters have responded to his art and its challenges, but his example of stubborn nonconformity has many uses."
