        "text": "Gustave Courbet, Self-portrait (Man with Pipe), 1848-1849. Oil on canvas, 45 x 37 cm.\n\nWho was Gustave Courbet?\n\nJean Désiré Gustave Courbet was a French painter who led the Realism movement in French painting during the 19th century. He rejected academic tradition and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists, committing himself to painting only what he could see. His unique approach served as an example to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists. Courbet gained recognition in the late 1840s and early 1850s for his paintings that challenged convention by portraying unidealized peasants and workers on a grand scale typically reserved for religious or historical subjects. His subsequent works included landscapes, seascapes, hunting scenes, nudes, and still lifes, with less overt political themes. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Courbet was also involved in French politics as a socialist. He was imprisoned for six months in 1871 due to his involvement with the Paris Commune and lived in exile in Switzerland from 1873 until his death four years later. Courbet's impact on 19th-century French painting was significant, as he was an innovator and an artist who fearlessly made bold social statements through his work.\n\nGustave Courbet, Desperate Man, 1843-1845. Oil on canvas, 45×54 cm. Private collection.\n\nLife\n\nGustave Courbet was born in 1819 in Ornans, a town in the Doubs department of France. His parents, Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet, held anti-monarchical beliefs, likely influenced by his maternal grandfather's involvement in the French Revolution. Courbet's sisters, Zoé, Zélie, and Juliette, served as his early models for painting and drawing. After moving to Paris in 1839, Courbet continued to return to Ornans frequently to engage in hunting, fishing, and draw inspiration for his art. He initially worked at the studio of Steuben and Hesse but soon left to develop his own style. He studied the works of Spanish, Flemish, and French masters in the Louvre and painted copies of their works, displaying a strong independent spirit in his pursuit of artistic excellence. Courbet initially drew inspiration from literature, creating works such as an Odalisque based on the writing of Victor Hugo and a Lélia inspired by George Sand. However, he soon abandoned these literary influences and instead chose to create paintings based on observed reality. In the early 1840s, he created several self-portraits in a Romantic style, depicting himself in various roles. Some notable examples include Self-Portrait with Black Dog (c. 1842–44, exhibited at the 1844 Paris Salon), Desperate Man (c. 1843–45), Lovers in the Countryside (1844, displayed at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Lyon), The Sculptor (1845), The Wounded Man (1844–54, displayed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris), Self-Portrait with a Cello (1847, displayed at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm and exhibited at the 1848 Salon), and Man with a Pipe (1848–49, displayed at the Musée Fabre in Montpellier). Courbet's travels to the Netherlands and Belgium in 1846-1847 reinforced his belief that artists should paint the life that surrounds them, as exemplified by the works of Dutch masters like Rembrandt and Hals. By 1848, Courbet had garnered support among younger critics, particularly the Neo-romantics and Realists, such as Champfleury. In 1849, Courbet achieved his first success at the Salon with his painting, After Dinner at Ornans. The artwork, which was reminiscent of Chardin and Le Nain, won Courbet a gold medal and was purchased by the French government. As a result of this recognition, Courbet's works were no longer subject to jury approval for exhibition at the Salon, a privilege he enjoyed until 1857 when the rules changed. Between 1849 and 1850, Courbet painted The Stone Breakers, which was unfortunately destroyed during the Allied Bombing of Dresden in 1945. The painting was highly regarded by the French philosopher Proudhon, who saw it as an icon of peasant life and a symbol of the working class. The Stone Breakers was inspired by a scene Courbet had witnessed on the roadside, and he later recounted to Champfleury and writer Francis Wey how the painting came to be: \"It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning.\" The Stone Breakers is now considered one of Courbet's most significant works and is recognized as one of the first examples of the Realism movement.\n\nGustave Courbet, Young ladies on the banks of the Seine, 1857. Oil on canvas, 174×200 cm. Paris: Musée du Petit Palais.\n\nWhat does Realism mean?\n\nCourbet's work did not align with the predominant Romantic or Neoclassical schools of art. He did not view history painting, which the Paris Salon considered the highest form of art, as a worthwhile pursuit, believing that artists of one era cannot accurately capture the essence of another time. Instead, Courbet maintained that the only true source for art was the artist's own experiences. Alongside Jean-François Millet, he found inspiration in painting the lives of peasants and workers. Courbet's artistic output included figurative compositions, landscapes, seascapes, and still lifes. He courted controversy by addressing social issues in his work and depicting subjects that were considered vulgar, such as rural bourgeoisie, peasants, and the working conditions of the poor. His work, along with that of Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, came to be known as Realism. For Courbet, Realism was not about perfect line and form but rather about the spontaneous and rough handling of paint, capturing the irregularities of nature through direct observation. He depicted the harsh realities of life and challenged the contemporary academic ideas of art. One of the defining features of Courbet's Realism was his lifelong connection to his native province, Franche-Comté, and his birthplace, Ornans.\n\nGustave Courbet, Woman with parrot, 1866. Oil on canvas, 129.5×195.6 cm. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe end of days\n\nAfter completing his prison sentence on 2 March 1872, Courbet's troubles were far from over. In 1873, the newly elected president of the Republic, Patrice Mac-Mahon, announced plans to rebuild the Vendôme Column, with the cost to be borne by Courbet. Unable to pay, Courbet went into a self-imposed exile in Switzerland to avoid bankruptcy. During this time, he participated in Swiss regional and national exhibitions and became known as the leader of the \"realist school\" in the small Swiss art community. He inspired younger artists such as Auguste Baud-Bovy and Ferdinand Hodler. One of Courbet's important works during this period included several paintings of trout, which were interpreted as allegorical self-portraits of the exiled artist. In his final years, Courbet focused on landscapes, including scenes of water emerging mysteriously from the depths of the earth in the Jura Mountains along the France-Switzerland border. Courbet also worked on sculpture during his exile, having previously produced a few sculptures in the early 1860s. One of his sculptures, The Fisherman of Chavots, had been donated to Ornans for a public fountain but was removed after Courbet's arrest. In May 1877, the state set the final cost of reconstructing the Vendôme Column at 323,000 francs for Courbet to repay in annual installments of 10,000 francs for the next 33 years. However, Courbet died on 31 December 1877, a day before the first installment was due, at the age of 58 in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, due to liver disease worsened by heavy drinking.\n\nThe most famous works\n\nGustave Courbet, Desperate Man, 1843-1845. Oil on canvas, 45×54 cm. Private collection.\n\nThe Desperate Man (1843-1845)\n\nThe Desperate Man is a memorable portrait mainly due to the lighting and the artist's anguished expression. Its dramatic composition may remind some viewers of the works of Caravaggio and Rembrandt.\n\nGustave Courbet, The Wave, 1869-70.\n\nThe Wave (1870)\n\nIt is argued that Courbet was one of the first artists to be influenced by Japanese prints, which later became a significant source of inspiration for many early Modernists. This Eastern aesthetic is evident in Courbet's paintings, which often depicted a slice of water isolated from a larger view of space, possibly inspired by the Japanese prints. This painting style was characterized by broken patches of paint applied in both the dark and light areas, creating a unique texture that was an inspiration to the budding Impressionists. In short, Courbet's landscapes and seascapes, with their painterly treatment, became a significant source of inspiration for later artists.\n\nGustave Courbet, Sleep,1866. Oil on canvas, 135 cm × 200 cm. Paris: Petit Palais.\n\nSleep (1866)\n\nThis particular artwork by Courbet displays his fascination with an erotic Realism, which became a prominent theme in his later works. The painting features a raw and explicit eroticism, without any romantic or mythological justifications, making it unpopular among those who adhered to the conventional tastes of the time. Courbet's unsanctified nudes provoked much discussion about the flaws in his character and art. However, the artist relished the attention and the reputation he gained as a confrontational artist. Despite the criticism, his controversial style helped establish him as an influential figure in the art world.\n\nGustave Courbet, The Painter's Studio, 1855. Oil on canvas, 361 cm × 598 cm. Paris: Musée d'Orsay.\n\nThe Painter's Studio: A Real Allegory Summing Up a Seven-Year Phase of My Artistic Life (1855)\n\nThis 19-foot-long painting is a manifestation of Courbet's self-love and pride in his iron will, hard work, and revolutionary genius. In a similar vein to how he depicted others in his earlier work \"Burial at Ornans,\" Courbet portrays himself as a hero in this painting. He displays a significant amount of egotism and asserts that progress occurs when individuals think independently and challenge the status quo. The painting shows Courbet at full size, with a brush in hand, working on a landscape painting. His friends on the right symbolize kindred spirits and innovation, while the admiring boy represents Courbet's belief that his legacy will endure for generations. The nude model standing behind the artist is a tribute to his greatness and her role as his muse. On the left, the working poor stand, as Courbet acknowledges their right to be included. His opponent, Napoleon III, is depicted as a poacher with a firearm and accompanied by his dogs. Courbet's confident gaze outshines Napoleon's downward head tilt, a symbol of the innovator dominating the authoritarian. In short, this painting is an expression of Courbet's self-confidence and his belief in the importance of individualism and challenging the establishment.\n\nGustave Courbet, The Meeting or Bonjour Monsieur Courbet, 1854. Oil on canvas, 129 cm × 149 cm. Montpellier: Musée Fabre.\n\nThe Meeting or Bonjour Monsieur Courbet (1854)\n\nIn this large painting, Courbet depicts himself meeting with Alfred Bruyas, a significant patron and supporter. The artwork showcases Bruyas' appreciation for Courbet's artistic talent. The servant in the painting is depicted in a gesture of utmost respect, emphasizing the moment of mutual appreciation between the artist and his patron. Courbet's head is slightly tilted back, and he stands directly in unfiltered light, highlighting his importance and intelligence. However, the painting also reveals Courbet's self-importance, evident in the way his beard points toward the patron as if in judgement. Additionally, Courbet carries a stick that is double the size of Bruyas', further emphasizing the artist's strength and power. Overall, the painting captures the relationship between an artist and his patron, showcasing Bruyas' admiration for Courbet and the artist's own sense of self-importance.\n\nGustave Courbet, The Bathers, 1853. Oil on canvas, 227 cm × 193 cm. Montpellier: Musée Fabre.\n\nThe Bathers (1853)\n\nIn this painting, Courbet depicts two women in a natural, non-idealized manner, without any mythological or rhetorical justification for their partial nudity. The painting was controversial and received negative criticism, with even renowned artist Delacroix expressing disapproval. However, this negative attention brought publicity to the work and ultimately helped Courbet sell it. The painting exemplifies Courbet's rejection of classical conventions and his emphasis on portraying reality, even if it was considered vulgar by some.\n\nGustave Courbet, Burial at Ornans, 1849. Oil on canvas, 315 cm × 660 cm. Paris: Musée d'Orsay.\n\nBurial at Ornans (1849)\n\nThis painting, which measures 22 feet in length and is located in a prominent room in the Musée d'Orsay, immerses the viewer in a cave-like atmosphere. The figures depicted in the painting appear unfocused on the ceremony and are arranged in a non-classical composition. As a quintessential example of Realism, the painting adheres closely to the factual details of a real burial and avoids any heightened spiritual connotations. Instead, Courbet emphasizes the transience of life and intentionally does not use the light in the painting to express the eternal. While the sunset could have symbolized the transition of the soul from the temporal to the eternal, Courbet covers the sky with clouds so that the passing of day into night is simply an echo of the coffin passing from light into the darkness of the earth. Some critics saw the painting's adherence to the facts of death as an insult to religion, and criticized its composition as shabby and its depiction of working-class people as having unwarranted importance. Others, such as Proudhon, praised the painting for its suggestion of equality and virtue among all people and recognized its potential to change the course of Western art and politics.\n\nGustave Courbet, Woman among the waves, 1868. Oil on canvas, 65.4×54 cm. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nKey concepts\n\nCourbet's Realism can be viewed as part of the broader investigation into the physical world that was taking place in the 19th century, particularly in the realm of science. However, within the world of art, Courbet was most influenced by his disdain for the rigid constraints of the French Academy. He rejected the traditional approaches of Classical or Romantic art and instead focused on humble scenes of country life, which were typically seen as subjects for minor genre paintings. Despite this, Courbet transformed these subjects into material for significant history paintings, earning him considerable notoriety. During the Paris Commune of 1871, Courbet temporarily put aside his painting to take on a role in the government, which was in line with his left-wing political beliefs. Although Courbet's art was not explicitly political, it was still recognized within the context of the time as he championed the idea of equality by depicting ordinary individuals in heroic ways. He portrayed them on a grand scale, refusing to conceal their imperfections, which was a departure from the idealized depictions that were commonly found in traditional art. As a result, Courbet's work became a symbol of social justice, resonating with those who sought to promote the values of equality and fairness during this tumultuous period of French history. As Courbet rejected the conventions of Academy painting, he often created compositions that were seen as collaged and rough in comparison to prevailing artistic standards. He also sometimes abandoned the traditional technique of careful modeling, instead applying paint thickly and using broken flecks and slabs. These innovative stylistic choices made Courbet highly respected by later modernists who sought to break free from traditional composition techniques and focus on emphasizing surface texture. Courbet broke away from the traditional reliance on the state-run Salon system by pioneering the solo retrospective as a private commercial venture. This approach allowed him to exhibit his works independently and on his own terms, which became a model that many later artists who defied conventions followed.\n\nSummary\n\nGustave Courbet played a pivotal role in the emergence of the Realism movement during the mid-19th century. He rejected the classical and theatrical styles of the French Academy and instead emphasized the physical reality of the objects he observed, even if that reality was plain and imperfect. As a committed Republican, Courbet used his Realism to champion the peasants and country folk from his hometown. Courbet was known for his response to the political turmoil that swept through France during his lifetime, and he ultimately died in exile in Switzerland after being held responsible for the cost of rebuilding Paris' Vendome Column. However, more recent historians have recognized the importance of Courbet's work as a precursor to other artists of early modernism, such as Édouard Manet and Claude Monet. Courbet's contributions to Realism and his dedication to portraying the reality of everyday life continue to make him an important figure in the history of art.\n\nGustave Courbet, The Stone Breakers, 1849. Oil on canvas, 159×259 cm. Work destroyed during the bombing of Dresden (1945).\n\nNotoriety\n\nAt the Salon of 1857, Courbet exhibited six paintings including Young Ladies on the Banks of the Seine (Summer) and hunting scenes. The former painting, which portrayed modern women casually displaying their undergarments, shocked art critics accustomed to conventional nude women in landscapes. Courbet deliberately exhibited sensational works alongside popular hunting scenes to ensure notoriety and sales. During the 1860s, he created increasingly erotic works such as Femme nue couchée, Sleep, and The Origin of the World, which depicted female genitalia and was not publicly exhibited until 1988. In the early 1860s, Napoléon III's regime exhibited authoritarian tendencies, but he later made concessions to his liberal opponents. As a sign of appeasement to Courbet's admirers, Napoleon III nominated him to the Legion of Honour in 1870. However, Courbet's refusal of the cross of the Legion of Honour angered those in power but made him immensely popular with the opposition.\n\nLegacy\n\nGustave Courbet's unique perspective transformed Western Art and laid the foundation for subsequent Modern movements, including Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Other artists, such as Manet, Monet, and Renoir, were influenced by Courbet's work and his approach to painting. Courbet's use of thickly applied paint also served as a precedent for later 20th century artists, such as Willem de Kooning, Lucian Freud, and the Bay Area Figurative Painters. Overall, Courbet's contributions to the art world have had a lasting impact on the development of modern art."
