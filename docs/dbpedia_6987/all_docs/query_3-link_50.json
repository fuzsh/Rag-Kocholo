        "text": "La Prairie de la Rencontre is located near the small town of Laffrey in the region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, about 30 km in the south of Grenoble. This is where the famous French emperor Napoléon Bonaparte faced the Royal Army of Louis XVIII back in 1815 after returning from exile. The yoyal battalion was supposed to arrest him, but he gave an impressive speech telling them not to kill their former own leader. After that, the soldiers laid down their weapons and rejoined him chanting: “Hail to the emperor!“\n\nSince 1930 there has been an equestrian statue depicting Napoléon Bonaparte. Nowadays, Prairie de la Rencontre is among the most popular sites alongside the Route Napoléon, a scenic route of about 200 miles in Southern France."
