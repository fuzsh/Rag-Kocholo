        "text": "Symbolism was a late nineteenth-century art movement of French,Russian and Belgian origin in poetry and other arts In literature,the style had its beginnings with the publication Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil, 1857) by Charles works of Edgar Allan Poe,which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French,were a significant influence and the source of many stock tropes and aesthetic was developed by Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine during the 1860 and 70. In the 1880, the aesthetic was articulated by a series of manifestos and attracted a generation of name “symbolist” itself was first applied by the critic Jean Moréas,who invented the term to distinguish the symbolist from the related decadents of literature and of art.\n\nMikhail Nesterov\n\nOne day his father sent him to seek for a lost his way he met a monk,a venerable elder,a stranger,a priest,with the appearance of an stranger was standing beneath an oak tree,praying devoutly and with much shedding of boy,seeing him,humbly made a low obeisance and awaited the end of his venerable monk,when he had ended his prayers,glanced at the boy and conscious that he beheld the chosen vessel of the Holy Spirit,he called him to his side,blessed him,bestowed on him a kiss in the name of Christ and asked “What art thou seeking or what dost thou want,child?” The boy answered,”My soul desires above all things to understand the Holy Scriptures.I have to study reading and writing and I am sorely vexed that I cannot learn these you,holy Father,pray to God for me,that he will give me understanding of book-learning?” The monk raised his hands and his eyes toward heaven,sighed,prayed to God,then said, “Amen.” Taking out from his satchel,as it were some treasure,with three fingers,he handed to the boy what appeared to be a little bit of white wheaten bread prosphora,saying to him”Take this in thy mouth,child,and eat,this is given thee as a sign of God’s grace and for the understanding of Holy Scriptures.Though the gift appears but small,the taste thereof is very sweet.\n\nSurrealism is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920,and is best known for its visual artworks and aim was to “resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality.” Artists painted unnerving,illogical scenes with photographic precision,created strange creatures from everyday objects and developed painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself and or an idea concept. Surrealist works feature the element of surprise,unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur however,many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost,with the works being an artifact.Leader André Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was,above all,A revolutionary movement.Surrealism developed out of the Dada activities during World War I and the most important center of the movement was the 1920 on ward,the movement spread around the globe,eventually affecting the visual arts,literature,film,and music of many countries and languages,as well as political thought and practice,philosophy and social theory.\n\nThe Elephant Celebes\n\nThe Elephant Celebes is a 1921 painting by the German Dadaist and surrealist Max is among the most famous of Ernst’s early surrealist works and “undoubtedly the first masterpiece of Surrealist painting in the De Chirico combines the vivid dreamlike atmosphere of Surrealism with the collage aspects of Dada.\n\nRealism or naturalism in the arts is the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions,implausible,exotic and supernatural elements.Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods and is in large part a matter of technique and training and the avoidance of stylezationin the visual arts,illusion realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms,perspective,and the details of light and colour.Realist works of art may emphasize the ugly or sordid,such as works of social realism,regionalism or Kitchen sink have been various realism movements in the arts,such as the opera style of verismo,literary realism,theatrical realism and Italian neorealist realism art movement in painting began in France in the 1850,after the 1848 realist painters rejected Romanticism,which had dominated French literature and art since the late 18th century.\n\nLa rencontre,ou “Bonjour Monsieur Courbet\n\nThe Meeting or “Bonjour,Monsieur Courbet” (French:La rencontre,ou “Bonjour Monsieur Courbet”) is an 1854 painting by Gustave painting is traditionally interpreted as Courbet greeted by his patron Bruyas,his servant Calas and his dog while traveling to composition is based on the Wandering Meeting was exhibited in Paris at the 1855 Exhibition Universelle,where critics ridiculed it as “Bonjour,Monsieur Courbet”.Bruyas did not exhibit The Meeting until he donated it to the Musée Fabre in Montpellier in 1868.\n\n(1839–1906)\n\nPaul Cézanne was a French artist and Post-Impressionist painter whose work laid the foundations of the transition from the 19th-century conception of artistic endeavour to a new and radically different world of art in the 20th century.Cézanne’s often repetitive, exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex paintings convey Cézanne’s intense study of his subjectsCézanne can be said to form the bridge between late 19th-century Impressionism and the early 20th century’s new line of artistic enquiry, Matisse and Picasso are said to have remarked that Cézanne “is the father of us all.”\n\nLife and work\n\nThe Cézannes lived in the town of Cesana now in West Piedmont and the surname may be of Italian Cézanne was born on 19 January 1839 in Aix-en-Provence,in Provence in the South of 22 February,Paul was baptized in the Église de la Madeleine, with his grandmother and uncle Louis as father,Louis-Auguste Cézanne (28 July 1798 – 23 October 1886),was the co-founder of a banking firm that prospered throughout the artist’s life,affording him financial security that was unavailable to most of his contemporaries and eventually resulting in a large inheritance.\n\nExhibitions and subjects\n\nCézanne’s paintings were shown in the first exhibition of the Salon des Refusés in 1863, which displayed works not accepted by the jury of the official Paris Salon. The Salon rejected Cézanne’s submissions every year from 1864 to 1869.He continued to submit works to the Salon until 1882. In that year, through the intervention of fellow artist Antoine Guillemet, he exhibited Portrait of Louis-Auguste Cézanne,Father of the Artist,reading ‘l’Evénement’,1866 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.),his first and last successful submission to the Salon.\n\nDeath\n\nThe Overture to Tannhäuser:The Artist’s Mother and Sister,1868,Hermitage Museum,St. Petersburg One day,Cézanne was caught in a storm while working in the after working for two hours under a downpour did he decide to go home,but on the way he was taken home by a passing old housekeeper rubbed his arms and legs to restore the circulation,as a result,he regained the following day, he intended to continue working, but later on he fainted,the model with whom he was working called for help,he was put to bed and he never left died a few days later,on 22 October 1906.He died of pneumonia and was buried at the Saint-Pierre Cemetery in his hometown of Aix-en-Provence.\n\nArt Work\n\nMont Sainte-Victoire1882–1885 L’Estaque1883–1885\n\nThe Bay of Marseilles,view L’Estaque1885 Mont Sainte-Victoire1885–1887\n\nJas de Bouffan1885–1887 Bather1885–1887\n\nFastnacht (Mardi Gras)1888 Boy in a Red Waistcoat1888–1890\n\nThe Black Marble Clock1869–1871 A Modern Olympia1873–1874\n\nImpressionism is a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870 and 1880,in spite of harsh opposition from the conventional art community in name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work,Impression, soleil levant (Impression,Sunrise),which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.Impressionist painting characteristics include relatively small,thin,yet visible brush strokes,open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time),ordinary subject matter,inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience and unusual visual development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.\n\nHaystacks(Monet)\n\nHaystacks is a title of a series of impressionist paintings by Claude primary subjects of all of the paintings in the series are stacks of hay in the field after the harvest title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Number 1266-1290) begun in the end of summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring, using that year’s use a broader definition of the title to refer to other paintings by Monet with this same series is known for its thematic use of repetition to show differences in perception of light across various times of day,seasons, and types of subjects were painted in fields near Monet’s home in Giverny, France.\n\nPOP ART\n\nName:Andrew Warhola\n\nBorn:August 6,1928 at Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania\n\nDied:February 22,1987(aged 58) at New York City,New York,United State\n\nNationality:American\n\nEducation:Carnegie Institute of Technology(Carnegie Mellon University)\n\nCampbell’s Soup Cans\n\nAndy Warhol\n\n(American, 1928–1987)\n\nWhen Warhol first exhibited these Campbell’s Soup Cans in 1962,they were displayed together on shelves,like products in a grocery aisle.At the time,the Campbell’s Soup Company sold 32 soup varieties,each canvas corresponds to a different flavor.Warhol did not indicate how the canvases should be installed.At MoMA,they are arranged in rows that reflect the chronological order in which the soups were introduced.The first flavor introduced by the company was tomato,in 1897.\n\nCampbell’s Soup Cans reproduces an object of mass consumption in the most literal sense. These paintings were silk screened,a printmaking method originally invented for commercial use.In a semi-mechanized process,Warhol repeated the same basic soup can image on dozens of canvases.He then hand-painted or stenciled the names of the individual soup varieties.Warhol said of Campbell’s Soup“I used to drink it.I used to have the same lunch every day,for 20 years,I guess,the same thing over and over again. Someone said my life has dominated me,I liked that idea.”\n\nSURREALISM\n\nName:René François Ghislain Magritte\n\nBorn:21 November 1898 at Lessines,Belgium\n\nDied:15 August 1967(aged 68) at Brussels,Belgium\n\nNationality:Belgian\n\nDali,Magritte and Max Ernst\n\nRene Magritte\n\nThe most representative painters of Very risk Surrealism were Salvador Dali,Rene Magritte and Max Ernst.The Belgian Rene Magritte had a good ability to paint ordinary objects in unusual contexts giving new meanings to familiar things.Max Ernst started as a Dadaist but turned to Surrealism when the Dada movement ended.With his paintings he tried to provoke the viewer to awaken moral.\n\nFauvism is the style of les Fauves (French for “the wild beasts”),a loose group of early twentieth-century Modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong color over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism.While Fauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910,the movement as such lasted only a few years,1904–1908 and had three exhibitions.The leaders of the movement were Henri Matisse and André Derain.\n\nThe Green Stripe\n\nThe Green Stripe (La Raie Verte),also known as Portrait of Madame Matisse.The Green Line, is a portrait by Henri Matisse of his wife,Amélie Noellie Matisse-Parayre.He painted it in 1905,just prior to such works being derisively labeled as the creations of Les Fauves (the wild beasts),along with similar works of André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.The painting hangs in Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen,Denmark.\n\nDefining erotic art is difficult since perceptions of both what is erotic and what is art fluctuate.A sculpture of a phallus in some African cultures may be considered a traditional symbol of potency though not overtly erotic.In addition,a distinction is often made between erotic art and pornography (which also depicts scenes of love-making and is intended to evoke erotic arousal,but is not usually considered art).The distinction may lie in intent and message; erotic art would be items intended as pieces of art,en capturing formal elements of art and drawing on other historical artworks.Pornography may also use these tools,but is primarily intended to arouse one sexually.Nevertheless,these elements of distinction are highly subjective.For instance,Justice Potter Stewart of the Supreme Court of the United States,in attempting to explain “hard-core” pornography or what is obscene,famously wrote,”I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced.I know it when I see it.\n\nAchille Devéria\n\nHis father was a civil employee of the navy Devéria became a student of Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson and Louis Lafitte (1770–1828).In 1822,he began exhibiting at the Paris Salon.At some point,he opened an art school together with his brother Eugène,who was also a painter.\n\nDada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of World War I.This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich.Dada rejected reason and logic,prizing nonsense,irrationality and intuition.The origin of the name Dada is unclear,some believe that it is a nonsensical word.Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara’s and Marcel Janco’s frequent use of the words “da, da,” meaning “yes, yes” in the Romanian language.Another theory says that the name “Dada” came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to ‘dada’,a French word for ‘hobbyhorse’.\n\nFountaine\n\nFountain is a 1917 work widely attributed to Marcel Duchamp.The scandalous work was a porcelain urinal,which was signed “R.Mutt” and titled Fountain.Submitted for the exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in 1917,Fountain was rejected by the committee,even though the rules stated that all works would be accepted from artists who paid the fee.Fountain was displayed and photographed at Alfred Stieglitz’s studio and the photo published in The Blind Man,but the original has been lost.The work is regarded by some art historians and theorists of the avant-garde,such as Peter Burger,as a major landmark in 20th century art.17 replicas commissioned by Duchamp in the 1960s now exist.\n\nCubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement pioneered by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso,joined by Jean Metzinger,Albert Gleizes,Robert Delaunay,Henri Le Fauconnier,Fernand Léger and Juan Gris that revolutionized European painting and sculpture and inspired related movements in music,literature and architecture.Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century.The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre, Montparnasse and Puteaux) during the 1910 and extending through the 1920.Variants such as Futurism and Constructivism developed in other countries.A primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne,which were displayed in a retrospective at the 1907 Salon d’AutomneIn Cubist artwork,objects are analyzed,broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint,the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.\n\nLes Demoiselles d’Avignon\n\nLes Demoiselles d’Avignon(The Young Ladies of Avignon and originally titled The Brothel of Avignon)is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso(1881–1973).The work portrays five nude female prostitutes from a brothel on Carrer d’Avinyó (Avinyó Street) in Barcelona.Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none are conventionally feminine.The women appear as slightly menacing and rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes.Two are shown with African mask-like faces and three more with faces in the Iberian style of Picasso’s native Spain,giving them a savage aura.In this adaptation of Primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat,two-dimensional picture plane,Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting.The proto-cubist work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both cubism and modern art.Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial and led to wide anger and disagreement,even amongst his closest associates and friends."
