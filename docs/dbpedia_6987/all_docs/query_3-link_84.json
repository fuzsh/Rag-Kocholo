        "text": "Realism art has less to do with the photorealistic painting of images and has more to do with the realistic subject matter. Realism is a significant movement within the realm of art that can be connected to the broader understanding of what art is. When discussing art, you can connect realism by highlighting its key aspects and its role in representing the world as it appears to our senses. Photorealism does play a part, but it is not always present in the paintings of Realism art. This article features the most famous 25 realism paintings.\n\nNighthawks\n\nThrough the large glass window, you can see a small group of people seated at a downtown dinner at somewhat a later time of the night.\n\nInspired by a Greenwich Avenue restaurant, Edward Hopper crafts an art gem that induces the viewer into awareness. Like a puzzle, the piece is incomplete and Edward coveys the gloomy aftermath of the Second World War in the streets of Manhattan, where he grew up.\n\nIsolation, depravity, and a dark sadness are all you can see when your eyes feed on its details.\n\nThe art ultimately reflects the hard life, struggle, and hustle of individuals (both men and women) during one of the darkest days in American history and that is why the famous piece has been\n\nrecognized and appreciated throughout the country and beyond.\n\nThe Gross Clinic\n\nMuch like Edward, Thomas Eakins was indeed famed for individuality in his works and that is why The Gross Clinic is termed as “one of the best American paintworks ever created.” Eakins depicts famous and respected American surgeon Samuel D. Gross displaying one of his surgery sessions to a group of Jefferson Medical College students in Philadelphia.\n\nThe surgery happens to be an orthopedic one and Thomas himself can be sighted in the top left corner of the portrait. The painting oozes realism and taut detailing the forming of the most highly regarded artworks by Thomas Eakins.\n\nBurial at Ornans\n\nIn Ornans France, great-uncle Gustave Courbet is dead and all the townspeople are present to witness the burial of one of the most recognized American works in history.\n\nThe realism and shocking narratives of the work are what has made it a classic piece of art not only in America but across the globe.\n\nStanding at a majestic 10 by 22 ft (about 3 t0 6m), Gustave Courbet makes a statement about the Realist movement, thereby almost single-handedly causing public mayhem on Romanticism in 1850 eventually bringing about a turning point in both art and religious movements alike.\n\nDo you know how Gustave Courbet buried Romanticism and gave birth to modern art?\n\nChristina’s World\n\nA little more recently into the 20th century, Christina’s World reached the heights of being one of the most favorite realism paintings just before the turn of the millennium.\n\nAndrew Wyeth grew up in South Cushing in Maine close to a mysterious lady called Christina Olson who was the woman in his 1948 painting who was crawling helplessly across the field in the address. Miss Christina happened to have suffered degenerative muscular disorder which restricted her movement while she wanted to see the world but instead, it was limited to just a plain horizon.\n\nDespite getting a rather sluggish reception, it has eventually grown a reputation for being one of the most important realism artworks.\n\nThe Elder Sister\n\nWilliam –Adolphe Bougeureau created the astonishing 130.2cm x 97.2 cm painting.\n\nThe Elder Sister, one of the famous realism paintings, shows a girl seated comfortably on a rock carrying a little child who was fast asleep. The name of the girl painted was his daughter Henriette and her little brother and the painter’s son, Paul. Behind Henriette, is a beautiful horizon with the greenest landscape to create from the mind.\n\nHis work, however, had a permanent collection and was placed amongst the Arts of Europe sections. According to the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, the painting was first gifted to the institution which has now made it one of the most respected and cherished in European museums.\n\nInterior\n\nIn 1968, Realism artist Edgar Degas came to one of his most intricate and puzzling exhibitions.\n\nThe painting clearly shows what looks like a marital dispute between two couples where the woman is barely dressed with a mischievous man behind her in the shadows. Almost everything about this art is unclear and that has caused a lot of uncertainties amongst scholars over the years.\n\nThese scholars claimed that the painting was inspired by a stage play, confronting its lack of logic if not deeper meaning buried in there.\n\nDespite this, a renowned writer-journalist then reflects on this otherworldly powerful scene by matching the scene in one of his books Therese Raguin.\n\nGustave Courbet, Bonjour Monsieur Courbet\n\nIt is no surprise that Gustave Courbet appears again in this list as he has already proven to be certainly one of the most influential artists of the 19th century with immaculate French Realism.\n\nStanding at an astonishing 129 x 149 cm, the French painting – Gustave Courbet, Bonjour Monsieur Courbet – was one of the first art pieces that contrived the words “Avant” (forward) and “guard” (an English troop). It was a greeting amongst war troops who were advocates of risk, flair, and fearlessness and had the rare ability to push ahead of the enemy lines and conquer battles. Gustave made sure the message was passed; depicting himself as a traveling man meeting two noblemen on a gentle afternoon, &quot;avant-garde&quot; he greets.\n\nThe Frenchman explores the visual expression of an artist in breaking boundaries with their new ideas and setting the pace for the masses.\n\nThe Gleaners by Jean François Millet\n\nThe Gleaners is a painting produced by Jean François Millet in 1857. The Gleaners was a manufacturing company and the name for this painting was inspired by it. In this painting, three women shown are gleaning the grains of wheat. One of the reasons why the Realism art movement has gained a lot of attention is because of the artists who started creating artworks about day-to-day life.\n\n“Beauty does not lie in the face. It lies in the harmony between a person and his or her industry. Beauty is an expression. When I paint a mother I try to render her beautiful by the mere look she gives her child”. – Jean Francois Millet\n\nThe Stone Breakers by Gustave Courbet\n\nThe Stone Breakers is a painting produced by Gustave Courbet between 1849 and 1850.

It is a full-length portrait depicting an alcoholic rag-and-bone man named Collardet who frequented the area around the Louvre in Paris.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe live in a modern world with so many urgent issues including the neglect of true art.\n\nRealism art proves to be what we all need to go back to reflect on these issues given its power to document contemporary culture while transmitting the basic details and consequences of the actions and decisions we make. Realism art strengthens and hones the skills of a true artist and it is what the world needs today."
