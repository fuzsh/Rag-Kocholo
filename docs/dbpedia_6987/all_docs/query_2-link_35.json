        "text": "Gustave Courbet was 20 years old when he arrived in Paris in 1839. The Franc-Comtois joined the faculty of law but his passion for painting quickly diverts him from this path, his inspiration nourished by the great masters he sees at the Louvre (Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Titian...) but also his fellow citizen Géricault and Delacroix, the first artists to use large-scale formats to paint episodes of contemporary history.\n\nA true revolution, as at the time large-scale paintings were reserved for historical, biblical, mythological or allegorical subjects.\n\nGustave Courbet threw himself into the breach that was opened by these two romantic painters, breaking away from the academic tradition.\n\nThe first scandal of his career : the painting \"A Burial at Ornans\" (a the Salon of 1851, a prestigious state-owned exhibition) that depicts a familiar and domestic world without any effect of \"glamorisation\": an artistic break that gave birth to realism and brought the history of Art to a whole new era.\n\nRefused \"due to contempt of religious morality\" or bought and destroyed by indignant contemporaries: the works of Gustave Courbet leave no one indifferent, he was the only painter who had the \"privilege\" of being refused in... the Salon of the Refused!\n\nNote that the painting \"Origin of the World\", that is today censored on social networks, did not make waves at the time (1866): it was destined to a private purchaser and was completely unknown to the public."
