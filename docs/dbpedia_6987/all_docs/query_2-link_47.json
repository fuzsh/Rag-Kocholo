        "text": "Courbet focused on depicting the ordinary existence of daily life, opposing the prevalent idealized and romanticized artistic expressions of his time, advocating that art should reflect the real world. Courbet’s works are renowned for their faithful portrayal of nature and society, believing that an artist’s work should represent the artist’s personal observations. In “Young Ladies of the Village,” Courbet faithfully depicted his three sisters strolling in the daily setting of a small valley near their hometown of Ornans, without any idealization or fictional elements. With a plain brushstroke, Courbet faithfully portrayed the everyday life of rural girls, endowing the scene with a strong sense of realism. However, this portrayal of daily life and the psychological aspect often invited criticism for lacking aesthetic appeal.\n\nYoung Ladies of the Village, 1851-1852\n\nCourbet’s landscape paintings constitute a significant part of his artistic achievement. They broke away from the prevailing romanticism of the time, faithfully depicting nature without pursuing idealized or romanticized landscapes, resulting in a strong sense of realism. He abandoned the ornate techniques and dramatic effects common in traditional art, focusing instead on delicately portraying light, color, and texture to present the true appearance of the natural world. He often employed dark tones, thick impasto, bold brushstrokes, and palette knives to enhance the texture and depth of the paintings, creating the desired effects.\n\nCourbet had a profound interest in the ocean, rivers, and their sources. “The Source of the Loue” depicts the scene of Courbet’s hometown at the source of the Loue River. The painting, with its dark background, creates a dense and somber atmosphere. The composition centers around the river, with the landscape on both sides almost symmetrically distributed, forming a stable triangular composition that gives the painting a solemn atmosphere. In his landscapes, there are no traces of deliberate carving, presenting a rugged and simple beauty of nature as a whole.\n\nThe Source of the Loue, 1864\n\nCourbet is renowned for his profound portrayal of character, with many of his subjects hailing from the lower echelons of society, as seen in works like “The Stone Breakers,” “The Dead Huntsman,” and “Burial at Ornans.” He refrained from idealizing or romanticizing these figures, instead faithfully presenting their life circumstances and inner spirits. In “The Stone Breakers,” for instance, he depicted two ragged laborers toiling at breaking stones, their weary faces betraying exhaustion yet bearing resolute gazes, reflecting the resilience of the working class.\n\nBoth Courbet’s landscape and portrait paintings embody his realism philosophy. He believed that art should faithfully reflect the real world rather than pursuing illusions and idealizations. Thus, he not only portrayed the beauty of nature and the everyday lives of the people but also reflected the societal realities of his time, showcasing significant artistic value and profound social significance.\n\nIn a letter from 1852, Courbet wrote: “When I stop being controversial, I’ll stop being important,” From this passage, it is easy to see that Courbet was such a contradictory and complex figure. His works often sparked controversy, and he himself frequently faced criticism and attacks as a result. He was both a defender of realism and a devotee of romanticism; he was both a critic of society and a pursuer of power. Despite this, his works continued to be admired by many and exerted a profound influence on subsequent art movements. The controversy surrounding Courbet’s paintings mainly revolved around two aspects: artistic paradigms and socio-political themes.\n\nRejecting Traditional Art Norms\n\nCourbet’s paintings challenged the artistic norms prevalent in his time. During that period, the art scene emphasized idealized themes, historical or mythological subjects, and intricate, detailed styles. However, in terms of subject matter, his artworks were rooted in reality, often considered radical and disruptive due to their focus on everyday life, themes of the working class, and the use of realist techniques. In terms of technique, he employed thick, loose brushstrokes, adding texture and immediacy to the overall composition. He embraced the traces of the brush, allowing them to add narrative depth to his works. For instance, “The Burial at Ornans” sparked significant controversy upon its exhibition, with critics deeming it overly realistic and lacking in aesthetic appeal. They criticized its stiff composition, dull colors, and the indifferent expressions of the figures, devoid of any sorrow or piety. However, at the same time, others argued that the painting reflected the realities of society and held significant meaning.\n\nPaintings that Stir Social Equality Awareness\n\nCourbet’s paintings emerged during a tumultuous period in French society and politics, marked by the 1848 Revolution and the rise of realism as a literary and artistic movement. His works often depicted the realities of working-class life, challenging the social and political status quo, which unsettled many viewers. For example, critics found “The Stonebreakers” to have rough figures and desolate backgrounds, lacking in any aesthetic appeal. While his brush portrayed ordinary, common people, the imagery carried implicit support for democratic politics, unsettling many conservative critics. Each stroke in his depiction of the harsh lives of France’s lower-class laborers critiqued the exploitation and oppression they faced in reality. Courbet’s paintings sparked reflections on social inequality, carrying significant social significance.\n\nFurthermore, another highly controversial work by Courbet is “The Origin of the World.” Female figures in art are often shrouded in elegant and idealized beauty. The female nude is frequently depicted in mythological or goddess-like poses. However, Courbet broke these conventions in his female-themed paintings, especially in “The Origin of the World.” This explicit depiction of the female nude presents the raw and unadorned portrayal of the female genitalia, directly showcasing a woman’s lower torso and open thighs. There are no classical artistic techniques to veil the most intimate parts of the female body, allowing viewers to confront them directly. This work naturally sparked intense controversy and accusations of immorality. Despite the controversy, “The Origin of the World” established its landmark status. It represents a more open-minded approach to realism and female body consciousness, challenging the societal constraints on gender prevalent at the time.\n\nInterestingly, in 2024, performance artist Deborah de Robertis sparked public attention again by spray-painting the words “MeToo” onto “The Origin of the World” painting. Her aim was to challenge art history, gender consciousness, and further challenge the traditional understanding of “The Origin of the World.”\n\nOf particular note is the message she brings regarding challenges to art history, gender consciousness, and established notions. This action has reignited public discourse and debate over the varied interpretations and discussions surrounding artworks, prompting a reevaluation of the traditional understanding of “The Origin of the World.” Through such actions, she attempts to convey a provocative message to audiences, inciting reflection on traditional aesthetics and values. Regardless of the controversy, Courbet’s artworks continue to hold significant prominence in the art realm and will continue to spark dialogue and contemplation in the future.\n\nGustave Courbet, the pioneer of Realist painting, elevated the ordinary and overlooked aspects of life into the realm of art through his brushstrokes, challenging the paradigms of idealized beauty, critiquing reality, and reshaping the art world. Courbet’s art served as a mirror of his time, capturing the harshness of working-class life and the stark contrasts between wealth and poverty. Fearlessly, he depicted all the flaws of contemporary society, challenging prevailing notions of beauty and morality.\n\nIn his eyes, beauty was not confined to idealized realms; it was inherent in the structures of reality, awaiting the keen eye of the artist to discover. Courbet’s significance lies not only in his painting techniques and pioneering attitude towards realism but also in his belief in “truth.” He showed the world that beauty could be found in the most ordinary moments. This beauty exists within reality and belongs to the discoverer."
