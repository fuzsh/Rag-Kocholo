        "text": "Right, the exhibition. Well, the subject for this exhibition is Victor Brauner. He was a pretty (very) weird guy. Synchronicities? You bet. Do you remember the exhibition I wrote about very soon after the museums started opening up again in June ? Called ‘Esprit es tu la?’ (Spirit are you there?) Brauner’s connection to Spiritualism started young and lasted a lifetime. Do you remember the portrait that Giorgio de Chirico painted of Apollinaire, with a mark on the forehead which anticipated the wound Apollinaire was to receive some years later during WWI? Brauner did him one better as we shall see (the word ‘see’ foretells). Like Felix Feneon about whom I wrote sometime ago, Brauner collected the arts of Oceania and Central and North America. Unlike Feneon, who was a collector, Brauner, as an artist, incorporated the art of distant lands (to quote Albrecht Durer) into his own work. Do you remember the review of the sculptor Zadkine whose studio/museum is on rue d’Assas. As a Jew, he fled Paris for New York during the Nazi occupation of Paris. His long suffering wife, Valentine Prax didn’t go with him. Instead, she headed south, to their little country cottage. Brauner was Jewish, so he had to leave Paris too, but his visa for New York never came through. He went into hiding in the countryside. Both Prax and Brauner suffered immeasurable privations during the war. Afterwards each said that the time spent in isolation and privation had been their most productive times as artists. Isolation minus the privation should be easier to bear, right?\n\nVictor Brauner was born in Romania in 1903. His father, a timber manufacturer (bought trees, sold lumber?) was described by Victor’s brother as a ‘poet, socialist and theosopher.’ We talked about Theosophy and the usual cast of characters - Madame Blavatsky, Rudolph Steiner and the artist Vassily Kandinsky - when we discussed the ‘Esprit es tu la?’ exhibition. Briefly, Theosophy is a belief system which contends that contact with a deeper spiritual reality is possible through intuition, meditation, revelation and/or some other state transcending normal human consciousness. I don’t know if that is intended to mean drugs, but since I am from San Francisco, I am going to go with yes on that.\n\nBrauner’s father was a passionate devotée of spiritualism, magnetism, and hypnotism. He organized sessions with mediums to communicate with spirits in the beyond. Halley’s Comet was scheduled to appear on May 18, 1910. Brauner’s father anticipated the end of the world. That’s interesting, when the comet appeared before the Battle of Hastings in 1066, it was perceived as a harbinger of good tidings. Well, for William the Conqueror it was, because he won.\n\nFor Harold, not so much since he was killed in battle. He is depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry (embroidery) lying on the ground with an arrow in his eye (note to self, remember the eye). Brauner’s parents dressed their 7 year old son in his Sunday best so he could attend the end of the world appropriately attired.\n\nHere’s my question, if you consider Halley’s Comet as a harbinger of the end of the world, and you wake up the next morning, shouldn’t you reconsider the set of beliefs that led you along that path? Well, apparently not for Brauner père nor for Brauner fils, since he was to add other ‘other worldly’ world views to his repertoire of beliefs over the years. As we will see, these included Tarot and the Kabbalah.\n\nAfter getting kicked out of art school for being an anti-figural non-conformist, he made his first trip to Paris (1925) where he was introduced to Surrealism. He traveled between Paris and Bucharest for much of the 1930s. Finally, because of the deteriorating political situation in Romania, specifically the fascism, the anti-Semitism, and the increasingly difficult art scene, Brauner fled Rumania and settled in France permanently in 1938.\n\nBrauner read a great deal in psychoanalysis; and according to Saul Steinberg, who wasalso born in Rumania and who knew Brauner in Paris, Brauner had an intense interest in extra-sensory perception. Of course he did, he was brought up with it. But there are in Brauner's own biography several incidents that anticipate the future. For example, in 1931, he painted one of his most well-known works - a self portrait with one eye enucleated.(Figure 4)\n\nSome writers have noted other harbingers of this dramatic event. For example, Brauner's painting of a tiger has the large letter \"D,\" the initial of Oscar Dominguez, the artist who threw the glass that broke into shreds that pierced the eye of Brauner. And here’s another, when Brauner first arrived in Paris he took a series of photos for Brancusi. One of the photos is of the house in which Brauner lost his eye 7 years later. I think both of those coincidences are pushing it and don’t achieve ‘objective chance’ status, since Brauner used other letters of the alphabet in other paintings and none of them alluded to anything that happened to him. And about that house, well, artists congregate and it isn’t that unusual that one of the houses he photographed might be significant down the road. And then of course, there is another premonition that Brauner had, that he would lose a hand, for which, in anticipation, he actually pur­chased an artificial wooden hand, au cas ou. Thank goodness that prophesy didn’t pan out and his body remained more or less intact for the rest of his life.\n\nIn the exhibition, in addition to that enucleated self portrait from 1931, Brauer depicted enucleated eyes in De Chiroco-esque deserted cityscapes and an all seeing eye nestling in a woman’s crotch (Figure 10). Have a look at his work, you’ll probably find other eye-xamples.\n\nBrauner considered the loss of his eye as the defining event of his life. He wrote, “The hunter, to aim better, closes his left eye for a while. The soldier, the better to kill, closes his left eye. The player, in games of skill, closes his left eye the better to send the ball or arrow into the center of the target […] . I have forever closed my left eye; I was probably given by chance to see the center of life better” That’s as good a definition of making lemonade out of lemons as I have ever read.\n\nIt could be argued that the war that followed losing his eye had every bit as intense an impact on Brauer’s art, on his life. When the Nazis moved into Paris, Brauner fled to the south of France. But Brauner never got his hoped-for visa to the United States. He spent the entire war in hiding, always worried about being discovered - Jewish and Romanian, he had real reason to worry. He had almost nothing to make art with, so he made art with nothing, like voodoo dolls and ex-votos of pebbles and pieces of string; or paintings using a wax technique he invented himself, applied to a canvas or wooden support, colored with charcoal or walnut stain then scraped or incised - techniques he continued to develop and explore in Paris when he was finally able to return.\n\nBrauner had always been a writer, incorporating words with images in his drawings and paintings. His isolation during the war enabled him to devote more time to writing, and his writings both document and explain his creative process. He also developed a new magical language, a ritornelle (a refrain which uses the same melody and the same words) of words and images. He was looking to discover a unity which would bring alchemy, Kabbalah and tarot together.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth C. Childs, in The Surrealist, 1947, (Figure 11) Victor Brauner borrowed motifs from the tarot (a set of seventy-eight illustrated cards used in fortune telling) to create a portrait of himself as a young man. One tarot card, the Juggler, (Figure 12) provided Brauner with a key prototype: large hat and medieval costume. Both figures stand behind a table on which is a knife, a goblet, and coins. The tarot Juggler refers to the capacity of each individual to create his own personality through intelligence, wit, and initiative, to create his own future."
