        "text": "FREN 330\n\nApproaches to French and Francophone Studies\n\nTuTh 11:00am-12:15pm, Dey Hall 102, Prof. Jessica Tanner (jltanner@email.unc.edu)\n\nFrom the Revolution of 1789 to today, Paris has occupied an outsized place in the history and imaginary of France, both within and outside the hexagon. Deemed “Capital of the 19th Century” (Benjamin), “Capital of Modernity” (Harvey), and even “Capital of the World” (Higonnet), Paris has inspired countless authors, artists, filmmakers, travelers, and urbanists—as an object of admiration, anxiety, ambivalence, or critique. Beneath its harmonious facades and its fabled renown as a “Ville-Lumière,” Paris has a more complicated and tumultuous history marked by revolt, displacement, marginalization, and conflict—a history that is just as foundational to the city’s meaning today as are its art and its monuments. Through the study of novels, films, paintings, comics, poems, and historical and critical texts, this course will explore the contradictory threads that have made Paris capital, attending to how the city and its symbolism have evolved over the past two centuries. We will look at how different figures have imagined, represented, and tried to make sense of Paris, as well as what the city has represented to those who inhabit it. Throughout the course, we will call the centrality of the city into question by exploring its social and geographical margins (e.g., the banlieue) and alternatives or “others” (e.g., the provinces, former colonies and currently occupied territories, Europe, the US, the world), addressing themes such as colonialism and decolonization, immigration and diaspora, racial and social justice, and globalization. *Course taught in French.
