        "text": "The third 12\" outing from these Orange County punk pranksters was a unexpected\n\ncareer move at the time: All remakes of odd songs that they wanted to cover in their\n\nunique pop/punk/metal/pre-grunge style, including a \"heavy\" remake of their own\n\ncomposition 'Linda Blair' from their Smoke Seven label debut album. What seemed\n\nto many like \"treading water\" for the band in 1984 now stands as a manifesto of intent\n\nfor their subsequent career which ran through punk/hard rock/glam/hair metal/proto-\n\ngrunge/psychedelia/bubblegum and pop culture tributes. And everything here is an\n\ninteresting take on the originals, some even improving upon their role models:\n\nside 1\n\nDeuce (Kiss)\n\nThe Citadel (The Rolling Stones)\n\nHeaven Only Knows (The Shangri-Las)\n\nAnn (The Stooges)\n\nside 2\n\nSaviour Machine (David Bowie)\n\nBlow You A Kiss In The Wind (a Boyce/Hart song from the Bewitched TV series)\n\nLinda Blair (Red Cross)\n\nUnfortunately, it was only released on a small defunct label, (Gasatanka) and never commercially\n\nreissued in the U.S. on vinyl or CD. Anybody know why? Did the Monsanto Corporation come\n\nafter them like the Red Cross previously did (necessitating the spelling change of their band name)?\n\nAnybody here ever ask the McDonald brothers why it's never been made available for thirty-one years?\n\nDo you own this? I've wondered if the 'Teen Babes' tracks were from tape or just a needle-drop\n\nfrom the vinyl. It goes for big bucks so I've never taken a chance on it.\n\nMonsanto as in Monsanto, CA, a small town in Contra Costa County, the ritzier part of the East Bay. The Negro Problem wrote a song called \"Monsanto\" about the same place.\n\nAs far as I know, none of the Redd Kross-related Gasatanka releases (the two Tater Totz LPs, the Anarchy 6 records, the Desperate Teenage Lovedolls soundtrack...) have ever been reissued. I'm not sure anything other than the Shonen Knife records have ever been reissued, probably because Bill only had one-time licensing rights from their Japanese label.\n\nGasatanka belonged to Bill Bartell, who also led the band White Flag under the name Pat Fear: he died a couple years ago, but I don't know what that means in terms of reissues."
