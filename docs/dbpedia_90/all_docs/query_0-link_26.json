        "text": "It appears that the previous thread about this is closed. The documentary is out and played in SF a couple of nights ago and it's fantastic! The McDonald brothers and the director were in attendance for a Q & A after the film. It apparently started playing around late last year and there's a showing in Brooklyn on May 9 with the director attending. Haven't seen any full schedule yet.\n\nBorn Innocent makes the case for Redd Kross as the seminal West Coast band of the last half century. Formed in 1978 by brothers Jeff and Steve McDonald, and still actively playing and recording today, Redd Kross are the ultimate rock and roll lifers. They have influenced independent music in ways that beg to be acknowledged. From inventing Beach Punk to influencing the Grunge and Hair Metal movements, Redd Kross have maintained the highest level of musical integrity, originality and quality for over forty years. They are the underappreciated link between countless threads of Los Angeles rock. The band that connects Black Flag to The Partridge Family, The Runaways to The Cowsills Seeds, The Go-Go’s to The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Born Innocent will introduce a wider audience to two of the coolest people alive. The McDonald Brothers embody Southern California, rock and roll, and what it means to be an artist.\n\nThis came under my radar for sure. Hopefully it gets released on a streaming service.\n\nThe one and only time I saw Redd Kross perform was in 1994 for a special 10th anniversary screening of the movie Desperate Teenage Lovedolls at the Nuart Theatre in West LA. Some of the female members of the cast joined the band on stage to sing songs from the movie. Rodney Bingenheimer was the MC, of course. I still have the Redd Kross POG they handed out somewhere...\n\nI can't wait for this! Going to the Brooklyn screening next week. Just got home from work and am about to crank the new single for the first time. And then the tour and the book! Dan Epstein also wrote a few excellent books about '70s baseball, so he's got a good grasp on the kitchiness of the era - regardless, he says the book is absolutely hilarious. Oh, and I messaged the band (or whoever does their FB page) this morning to find out if there was a personnel change and I was glad to hear that Jason Shapiro is still playing guitar; he just couldn't make the video shoot.\n\nI don't recall Bill Bartell but a lot of the talking head interviews are very brief. I found an old post by the director where he mentions interview subjects.\n\nAs 2019 draws to a close, we wanted to give you an update on the progress that your donations have made possible. Since the Kickstarter campaign was successfully funded, we have filmed interviews with 40 people who are important to telling the Redd Kross story. We have talked to members of Pearl Jam, The Go-Go’s, Soundgarden and The Bangles. Those are just the household names. Since many of you are true music fans, here’s the complete list: we have interviewed members of Dinosaur Jr., The Germs, The Presidents of the United States of America, The Muffs, Veruca Salt, The Adolescents, Air, The Pandoras, The Last, Sloan, The Lovedolls, The Young Fresh Fellows, The Three O’ Clock, The Nip Drivers, The Fastbacks, Sin 34, The Side Eyes, and That Dog. And that’s in addition to our earlier interviews with members of Sonic Youth, The Melvins, and The Circle Jerks. In 2020 we have interviews scheduled with members of Black Flag, Mudhoney, L7, ***** Galore, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jellyfish. We have interviewed a total of 10 current and former members of Redd Kross, with more planned in the New Year.\n\nI just saw it tonight - it lives up to the hype and then some. There was a Q&A with the director afterwards and he basically admitted that he forced himself to keep it to a certain length but that there'd be tons of outtakes on the eventual home release - I can't wait for those. I do have my issues with what didn't make the cut but I can also see why some stuff was left out/glossed over.\n\nAnyway, it's the best rock doc I've seen in ages. Bring on the new album and the book!\n\nFor some reason I thought they were still on Merge - but have moved to In The Red Records. I will probably go the lossless-download route this weekend. I would like to think that the LP might have less-compressed mastering (see: Researching The Blues) but at $30+ for double-vinyl, I'm reluctant to roll the dice.\n\nIf you order from In The Red directly it's only $30 for the double lp plus shipping, which I thought was a pretty fair price considering what others charge. I plan on doing some major in store record shopping over the next few weekends, so I'm hoping to score it in person and even if I have to pay more that's OK, won't have to worry about shipping damage, and I support a local shop, win win. It's killing me not hearing this today though. I'm going to see them in August, so I definitely need to hear this multiple times before the show.\n\nI just streamed most of it through Amazon while I was taking my daily walk on my lunch hour. Another winner from the McDonald Brothers! Cant wait to get the CD.\n\nExcept for some of the last album, you can always count on them to put out a solid lp, I can't wait to hear this one. And I really can't wait for my blu ray of the documentary. Oh wait, it's been 4 years, guess I can wait haha, but I have faith they will deliver eventually!\n\nBullmoose shipped my LP & CD (I'm double dipping - I love these guys) today so I managed to track it down last night. I've only given it two full listens but it's pretty damn great and it immedately struck me as a grower, for sure.\n\nFirst off, it rocks a lot harder than the last two. It's also got a lot of psychedelic flair! And a lot more Steve vocals than ever before, including a duet or two with Jeff. Off to give it another whirl but I think it's already my favorite since the hiatus.\n\nFinally grabbed my couple of the double lp at Amoeba yesterday. Just opened to check it out and see it's a black vinyl version, I thought there was only red. Oh well, guess I'll be happy in the notion that it probably sounds better haha.\n\nI agree Beyond the Door was very patchy, had some great songs, but a few duds which isn't the norm for them. But this one sounds up my alley from what I've read, and I'm a huge fan so can't wait to listen and seem them in August as well."
