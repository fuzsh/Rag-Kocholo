        "text": "Steven Shane McDonald (born May 24, 1967) is the bass player in the Los Angeles alternative rock/power pop band Redd Kross. He is also a member of the hardcore punk band OFF!, which formed in late 2009. Other projects included The SMG and Green and Yellow TV - both were Los Angeles-based groups from the 2000s. He was also in the 1984 film Desperate Teenage Lovedolls (film) and its sequel Lovedolls Superstar (film) and the 1990 film Spirit of '76 all with his brother Jeff McDonald.\n\nIn the Summer of 2002 he became so excited about The White Stripes' new album, White Blood Cells, that he recorded bass lines to two songs of the typically bass-less duo's work. The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly and other outlets reported on it and due to overwhelming demand he added bass to all of the songs, posted the new creation online, and allowed people to download the tracks for free. He called it an art project named Redd Blood Cells which reached a peak of 60,000 downloads in a single day, causing the server to crash from the traffic.\n\nSteven is currently married to former That Dog vocalist Anna Waronker. During the summer of 2007 Steven began using the nickname \"Mr. Urbane.\" But during the summer of 2009, Steven insisted on being referred to as \"Dr. Swaddles.\"\n\nCourtesy of Wikipedia"
