He, unfortunately drew the assignment of tabulating the resutffSfiur first questionaire. He did a yeoman's job of it, he did, and while I'm sure we'll miss Maz now that he’s returned home, I'm not so sure he 'll miss this job. So, without further ado, here's \"Maz, Maz, the survey man\" as he's iffectionately been called around here. Well, having had the enviable task of collating and tabu¬ lating \"MRR's First Questionaire\" it now seems I've been alloted to share the results with our esteemed readers! So C date we've received over 300responses and although they continue to trickle in at a steady rate the general consen¬ sus was to cease the count at the 300 barrier, it being evident that the results were fairly consistent. At each hundred mark the raw info was broken down and gathered into some semblance of order. Armed with these three sets of answers a final tally was taken and the averages computed. These, along with a few conclusions, are listed below. 1 hope they're of some interest and provide you with a little insight into MRR's readership... just don't ask me to do it again next year, coz at the first mention of that 'Q' word. I'm outta here! Oh, and it's worth mentioning virtually all the replies came from within the U.S. so by no means is this a view of the world at large (though there seems to be little appreciable statistical difference m the European ones we nave received) . On¬ wards... The average MRR reader is a whopping 22.2 years old, a little surprising at first but under careful scrutiny and the use of a means test most were found to lie below this bracket. Of these, 84% are male and 16% female, a pitiful state of affairs I think you'll agree and one that definitely needs to be rectified. Now sexuality: 85.7% straight; 4.3% gay; 6% bisex¬ ual; 1% asexual; 2% celibate and 1% undecided. This seems to correspond with the national average so yields few sur¬ prises. Tne average length of time reading MRR is 3.4 years, which seems to indicate admirable staying power though yet again is a little misleading as the majority had been reading for a shorter time-scale. Mu sical tastes break down in the following pattern (note that these are not percentages as many people picked more than one category): punk - 73; hardcore - 72; speedmetal - 21; stench - 10; noisy j>ost punk - 29; power pop - 20; '70s- influenced rock -15; neo'60s -12; oi -17; ska - 28; industrial - 20; death rock - 14. It seems stench has yet to catch on, though the ska revival is evidently well under way! Occupations were as follows: white collar - 28; blue collar - 34; student - 51; unemployed - 6. Again these are not reviews - 73; columns - 73; ads - 70; classifieds - 59; letters - 69; scene reports - 59; band interviews - 61; articles { 66; nothing better to read - 29. I was a little surprised bV the lack of interest in classifieds (all scared off by the ubiquitous Misfits collectors no doubt) and the popularity of adverts though some brieht snark sueeesteu consumers tend to be more Many people had objections to pigeon-holing them¬ selves so the question on orientation snows a few inconsis¬ tencies. Punk - 40; skin - 4; post punk - 4; metalhead - 2; mod -1; average joe/jane - 35; skater - 5; hippie - 7; new ager - 2. Good to see the hippy spirit lives on though considering ska scored so highly earlier mods and skins are remarkably thin on the ground. Unsolicited replies ranged from \"college dork\" (now there's honesty for you) to the cryptic \"L.A.M.F\", answers on a post card please! Your fave sections of MRR all run fairly close: news - 63; questionaires. An interesting thought. Political stances were as follows: anarchist - 21; libertar¬ ian -11; social democrat - 20; anarcho communist - 6; commu¬ nist -1; liberal - 34; conservative - 4; fascist - 0; apolitical - 7; undecided - 5. It seems America's fear of communism has permeated eyen the punk community, though not surpris¬ ingly we received little if any response from aspiring fas¬ cists... too busy polishing their jack boots no doubt. Uncate¬ gorized answers ranged from \"social communalist\" to \"whatever Larry Livermore is\"! I know many people were confused by the 'in between' section of the straight edge question. \"You either drink or you don't,\" which is a valid observation, take note question setter... whoever you may be. Anyways, 27% of you were straight and alert, 36% drunk and alert and 33% somewhere 'twixt the two, with 4% refusing to pass comment (party poopers perhaps?!). Record-buying habits were fairly predictable, peaking at the first question and falling away logarithmically. 47% bought 0-5 records/tapes per month; 32% 5-10 per month; 14% 10-20 and 7% 20+. Nothing unusual about gig attendances either, though many were restricted by lack of a 'scene,' the inhibitions of small town life and the falling value of the dollar. 36% attended 0-1 gigs a month, 53% went to 1-5 and 10% made it to over five a month. Good to see people aren't restricting their reading habits too much with 16% struggling through 0-1 tomes a month, 66% reading 1-5 and 18% digesting over 5. Fairly self-explanatory, this one with the religious among you weighing in at 22% and the non-religious 78%. Secular preferences were as follows: 8% Catholic; 3% Chris¬ tian; 2% Methodist; 2% didn't specify; 1% Jewish; 1% Mormon: 1% Presbyterian; 1% Satanist (a joke surely?); 1% Baptist and Evangelists, Buddhists and Episcopalians all drawing negligible votes. It seems two people got entirely the wrong end of the stick citing Yohannanism (obviously an obsessive record collector) ana Amnesty Internationalism as their personal philosophies... better luck next time, guys! Finally comes the dreaded income question. As many of you will have realized there was a major typo in the number¬ ing which invalidated a fair proportion of the responses Though I managed to salvage the following: 30% dependan on parents; 4% welfare recipients; 26% 0-5000 a year; 18% 5- 10000; 14% 10-20000 and 2% 20000+ a year. The high depen dancy on parents is obviously explained by the large numbe of students among you and judging by the wage count many of you live in abject poverty, where does all the money for gigs and records come from I wonder?! A sub-culture of closet crack dealers perhaps? Well, that about wraps it up for this year. I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank all those who took the time to send in responses... and all those who didn't, you made my life considerably easier! Toodle oo. Mat. Dear MRR and; MRR readers, This is an open letter to any MRR reader who might be contemplating suicide, and I hope that it is in time to reach the individual whose letter appeared in M.RR #79. My parents divorced when I was seven, and my mother's second husband was an ex-mili¬ tary lunatic who abused me physically and psy¬ chologically on a daily basis. He inflicted scars on me that I am c ily now recovering from. When I reached junior high, I was branded a fag because I didn’t play football (in West Texas, the words fag end heretic are synonymous, i.e. a male who doesn’t play football.) I was persecuted and brutalized constantly throughout my junior high and high school years. I had few friends and more enemies than I could handle. Needless to say, the thought of suicide hovered in the back of my head like an EXIT sign in the heat-distorted haze of a burning building. It’s been over two years since I’ve thought about killing myself, and I can’t express how grateful I am that I didn’t go through with it. I am happier than I ever would have thought it was possible for me to be. I’m in college now, a math major with a Natl Merit Scholarship, and I’m working toward certification so that I can teach high school math and show kids that being differ¬ ent is worth the price society exacts for it. I was a fat klutz for the first 19 years of my life, but now I’m helping my body catch up with my mind through weight training and martial arts. Although I was raised on a ranch, I overcame my conditioning and am now a vegetarian. I have good friends and a life worth living, and that would not have been possible had I taken my own life. The point I’m trying to make with this ram¬ bling narrative is that there is. hope. Nothing is forever. Your life is what you make of it. It’s a cliche, I know, but it is true, and I literally am living proof. The first thing you have to realize is that no one’s opinion of you matters more than your own. Take a good look look at yourself. What do you like about what you see? Accentuate it. What do you dislike? Change it. I’m not talking about plas¬ tic surgery or anything like that (physical condi¬ tioning will do a lot more for your looks than a nose job). What I’m talking about is leading your life ac¬ cording to what you think you should be rather than what everyone else says you should be, because “what everyone else says\" is 99.44% bullshit. Once you achieve a positive self-image, you’ll be able to look the bastards in the eye and tell them to FUCK OFF!!! “Easy for him to say,” you’re probably think¬ ing, and you’re right. But it wasn’t easy for me to do; nonetheless, I did it. Optimism is not only be¬ lieving that things can change, it is acting on that belief. Start small, but challenge yourself. You can accomplish far more than you think, no matter how much adversity you face. Anyone out there who needs support can write to me at this address: Michael Rankin / 715 Stadium Dr. Box 2445/San Antonio, TX 78212 P.S. Sean of Vegao Reich - You’re an idiot. I don’t think your family tree has an extraordinary number of branches. ^ Dear MRR, This is in response to the Seattle scene report in MRR #79 in which Ron (formerly of Brotherhood, now of Resolution) answered the question as to why SubPop bands aren’t included in the scene report. Well, I have a few questions. First, how is it a “rock star” attitude to want to do something different from the play-as-fast- as-you-can with three chord progressions and vocalists who couldn’t sing if their lives depended on it type of shit that contributes to the musical glut of the ’80s? Those bands are attempting to create a separate scene for a good reason. They too, I suspect, are sick and tired of graniteheads (with or without hair, regardless of race) who are about as close-minded about music (among other things) as their own grandparents are about anything after WWII as well as the presence of Nazis at shows (never have I seen goosesteppers at a SupPop show) and all the brawls that ensue over stupid shit (like when someone who really shouldn’t be in the pit anyways gets crunched and starts swinging wildly at who ever’s closest). Is it the bands who exhibit the poseur attitude or is it their label? Where is your proof and what are your sources of this information and are they credible? Or is it just your own personal prejudice against bands on that label (for whatever reason) that you make so clear in your own critiques of bands in issue #2 of Open Hand? Musically speaking, the Seattle scene is dead. Well, not dead but it’s certainly on a respi¬ rator and all the doctors (bands) can do is keep it alive and pray for a cure. SubPop isn’t a cure, but it’s a progressive step. It’s the best think musically to happen to Seattle since Jimi Hendrix. And it’s uniquely Seattle. Not all SubPop bands are good (my personal favorites are Nirvana, Skin Yard and pre-corporate Soundgarden) but at least they’re different and they attempt to improve and experi¬ ment. I’m still very loyal to the hardcore scone (it changed my life forever — honest!) and I’m active within it with my involvement with Milkbone and Washington Hall. There are some HC bands like G.B.H., Subvert, Coffin Break, and many others that I get into. But in terms of hardcore making music history, it’s just a footnote. I hope someday soon that everyone will leave their egos at home and that the “big three\" metal (as in Metallica, Nuclear Assault, etc.), hardcore and grunge-neo-psychedelia scenes can come together as one unified scene. All this in¬ fighting is just what \"big brother\" wants. Divide and conquer. Anyone who has half a brain cell can clearly see the big picture. Anyways, I’m anxious to see the response in MRR. I’ve confronted Ron on this before via a letter to Open Hand after what I read in issue #2, so issue #3 should be interest¬ ing as well. Spyder Stiletto, Seattle Dear MRR, “The transcendental qualities are condu¬ cive to liberation, whereas the demoniac qualities make for bondage. Bhagavad-Gita, as it is 16:5 “Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”- John 7:24 “Watch yourself‘cause you’re falling down. ” - Ray of Today ,”What Goes Away” It was with great happiness that I immedi¬ ately took notice of the December 1989 issue of Maximum RocknRoll because it featured a really great, spiritually great person on the cover, namely Ray Cappo. You see, Ray is my spiritual friend and godbrother and he alone saved me from this life of materialism and illusion and showed me how to love god and devote myself to him. I, too, am a devotee, a Hare Krsna (and, no, I am not brainwashed) and so I was elated to see Ray on the cover of your zine out of my brotherly love and affection for him, that is, until I say how your rather innocuous questioning degenerated into stabbing (like a knife through the heart) inquisition and all you ended up doing was provoking Ray. Real nice, man! Are you so blinded by your bodily conception of life that you have no spiritual vision? I guess so. Without understanding your true spiri¬ tual nature and love for god or Krsna, your whole life here is a TOTAL WASTE. And as if that were not bad enough, then you put an article on how the Hare Krsna move¬ ment is nothing but a brainwashing outift. How untrue! It’s so sad that your zine had to come under the influence of demonial mentality. So what the reader comes away with is that Ray. Cappo is a Hare Krsna devotee, being a devotee is being brainswashed and so by your twisted logic then Ray is brainwashed. Lies, lies, lies! The Nectar of Devotion by Srila Prabhupaba says that one should act like a “Blazing Fire\" against one who utters blasphemous things against the Lord’s devotee. For your information, sir, Ray is a pure, precious, holy and topmost devotee and I’m tired of people like yourself picking on Ray and uttering caluminous words against him. Stop it! He is so transcendentally beautiful: loving, caring, giving, knowledged, etc. and so I am going to act like a \"blazing fire” against you, except I don’t want to burn YOU up, just your ignorance and speaking like an atheist. You see, Tim, I can hate what you stand for and your ignorance of spiritual matters and yet I really love you and have compassion and mercy upon you. Please, wake up out of your spiri¬ tual slumber and live the way god intended for your to live. Center you life around god, not Tim. And you have to realize that you are not god, you’re not the supreme controller; god is and you're his servant and you have to humble your¬ self and bow down in prostration before him. One other thing. Your article on “Brain¬ washing\" didn’t mention a few things like what about the householder (non-temple living) devo¬ tees or the fact that we do get enough protein from sources like milk, yoghurt, cheese, nuts, etc. And that devotees are not escapists from reality. That article is the height of journalistic irresponsibility, nescience, rascaldom and sinful activity! That last time I had someone tell me that Ray was brainwashed, I just kept quiet about it and ignored it, figuring it was just an isolated case. This time, not so. I have to defend Ray against the demonic-influenced people’s accusations. He’s my spiritual brother and spiritual friend and very, very near and dear to me and I love him very dearly and would do anything for him (no, not immoral acts!) including laying my life on the line for him. (I used to be this way with my \"hardcore” friends way back when.) If you had guts, you’d publicly apologize to Ray and beg his forgiveness. Sincerely, Tom Best/ Chicago, IL Dear Tim, I am writing you because I am very dis¬ turbed the way you handled the interview with Ray Cappo, and how your magazine dealt with the issue of the Krishna faith. I believe people should have the right to choose whatever they want to believe in, no matter how absurd or threatening it may seem to others. If what they believe disturbs you, by all means try to rationally understand why they think this way, and question them about whatever it is you don’t get and give them your doubts on the subject. Your interview was a good example of this technique untill you started cursing and name¬ calling. So Ray has beliefs that he would like others to follow. Wouldn’t Dave MDC or Ian Mackaye like me to follow their beliefs in boycotting some cor¬ poration, protesting some goverment instituted atrocity and basic thoughts on good and bad. Why should I think killing people or greed is bad? If there is no meaning in life except living and dying, why care about good or bad if you only have to answer to the dim-witted fascist law enforcement officials? Why have a concept of good or bad at all? I have a feeling that since the Krishna faith is obscure in the eyes of many, you are so worried about it. If Ray said he became converted to a Christian or an atheist there wouldn’t be such a heated exchange. You first questioned Ray on things you didn’t know, then you regressed to fearing that he might be trying to recruit others. Something I found frightening was MRR siding with the deprogramers and the cult aware¬ ness agencies. On a Morton Downey Jr. show where he also sided with them, they were ex¬ posed as groups that will go to the extreme of kidnaping an person who chose to join an obscure group or cult, from their own free will in this beautiful, free country. That sounds to me like they and possibly MRR are afraid of people making their own choices in what to believe. I haven’t heard of Ray or any Krishna forcing anyone to hear their testimony. In fact, the image of the Krishna faith in this country was grandly parodied as a religion which everyone ignored. Now that people are joining it, naturally there could be some alarm but I never expected MRR, a magazine that expresses the belief that a person’s right to choose 'shouldn’t be repressed, to feel that way. What if the doctrine Ray’s pushing is dan¬ gerous (thus legitimizing concern)? What if Ray’s beliefs could have the same effect as Hitler evil beliefs? I don’t think the answer in these cases is to condone the governmental eradication of these groups that occurs when the Cult awareness agency gets involved, but it might be to challenge intelligently what they say where it could do con¬ structive help to a believer. Insults like Ray’s a “crackpot\" and \"insane” aren’t making your case against Krishna faith look very good. One insult you said to Ray that struck me as significant was “you’re as fucked up as you ever were.\" Why it meant something to me was that, in this punk scene, and in the pages of MRR, Ray is brought up to be sort of a clown, a caricature of a human being, rather a cardboard figure broadly symbolizing stupid ideals. From what I read in the course of the argument, Ray came off as the level¬ headed member of the conversion who was pretty sure of himself and made significant points with¬ out seemingly having to revert to insults and anger. Could it be that Ray’s knack for debate to stick up for for his beliefs threatened the assumed vision people have in the punk community of Ray being a \"stupid straight edge jock easily influ¬ enced by ideas of others.\" I guess it is as important for people to have the image of Ray as dumb as the racists who put an importance of relegating the most intelligent black to a \"stupid nigger.\" I’m sure many active professional debaters would have picked Ray as the winner and you as the disgruntled loser. Collin Barden, 153 Red Pine Loop, Old Bridge NJ 08857 Collin and Tom , Your two letters are among many MRR received complaining about the interview with Ray Cappo and the “Truth About Krishna\"article in #79. They are somewhat representative of the others—some being emotional and scary, others more reasoned. Both deserve response. First, Tom, you may have found my disen¬ chantment with your idol a bit harsh, but I find his fanaticism equally harsh. I owe no apology, nor do I regret my outbursts of incredulity or frustration. But your letter, if anything, makes me all the more uncomfortable with the beliefs Ray has adopted. You make the case for the “brainwashing\" accu¬ sations in the second article. The reason MRR ran that “expose’’ was to counter-balance both Ray’s organizing among young people in the scene at gigs (which is somewhat different than ‘quietly holding personal beliefs’), as well as the Krishnas’ well-documented attempts to seduce and convert lonely and alien¬ ated kids in the subculture. MRR does not neces¬ sarily endorse everything in that piece, or any article, for that matter. Personally, I can say I wholeheartedly agree with about 20% of what’s in MRR, half-heartedly with about 40%, and dis¬ agree with about40%. IfoundmostofAnnabella’s article to be a very interesting and stimulating, despite some differences on the deprogramming issue, but what I find curious about aspects of the responses, as well as Mykel Board’s inferences in this month’s column, is that people assume that everything printed in MRR by outside* writers (or even inside writers) is MRR policy. (I hope Mykel doesn’t think we print him because we see eye-to- eye). Perhaps they are merely projecting what they would do if they were in an editorial position, but I think that belies their basic pose of “anti- authoritarianism\" or “anti-political correctness\". To get to my point, Annabella presented a view that might make some potential converts to Krishna think twice, which I should think is good—no matter what the situation—for people in a vulner¬ able position. I also find it interesting that the Krishnas that wrote in (some identified themselves as such, others did not—but I was told by a Krishna that Ray called the temple, who in turn were organiz¬ ing a campaign of letter-writing) complain of reli¬ gious harrassment and being singled out for per¬ secution, but I don’t remember one of them writing in to complain about the many MRR articles at¬ tacking the Born Again Christians, Moonies, or conservative Catholics. And yes, I do find main- steam organized religions (and insitutions) to be as manipulative and “brainwashing\"as the Krish¬ nas. One thing I learned from the “anti\" letters was that the Krishnas are very uptight about nega¬ tive publicity, and even more upset at former Krishnas who talk about why they got out. The letters accuse them of being “liars\", “weaklings\", “half-steppers”, and “fanatics\"... which has the faint odor of Stalin or Jonestown about it. The controversy surrounding deprogram¬ mers is next. Annabella obviously felt her experi¬ ence was productive. I personally don’t like the idea of strong-arm tactics and intimidation, and am suspicious that some deprogramming is meant to re-program people back into mainstream dog¬ mas. But I wonder why people’s beliefs wouldn’t hold up to some intense scrutiny, unless they’re afraid of being away from their crutch, much like a junkie going cold turkey. I know I wouldn’t become somebody else if I went through something like that—it might actually be interesting. But it’s almost like the word “deprogramming’’ has the same effect on Krishnas as holding a cross up to Drac- ula does in the movies. I even noticed this kind of reaction when Ray did the interview here. After an hour or two of intense conversation, he seemed genuinely rattled, shaky and unhappy. The next day he got up and moved to the local temple, and returned a day later, rejuvenated and rearmed with new arguments, with a new aggressiveness and strength. Based on my own perceptions with him, andAnnabella’s accounting, I am quite glad that MRR ran both pieces. They were not hatchet jobs, but were honest personal reactions and re¬ countings to some scarey changes of personality and thought patterns in friends. Our word is obvi¬ ously not the last word, but at least we’ve hope¬ fully added a healthy noted of scepticism to the debate. Finally, Collin, you feel my attacks on Ray were attempts to denigrate, ridicule and make a caricature of him—not so. I like Ray Cappo. I've respected a lot of his growth, and some of his per¬ formances with YOT have given me very special moments. Which makes it all the more disturbing to me to see him getting locked into a reactive, dogmatic straightjacket, to see his personality change into a more rigid, less humorous and more closed direction—under the guise of being “more open\". I know he has meant well and reaJy be¬ lieves he has sublimated his earthly (and there¬ fore e vil, according to him) ego to a bigger cause — God, but I think the opposite is happening. It takes a really big ego to even imagine that our small consciousness is so important that there must be a God to perpetuate it, or to believe that there is an answer and they have it. And it is a really big lie to one’s self to believe the ego is now sublimated to that God. That kind of self-lie is not only scarey for society at large when it becomes a mass phenom¬ ena, but is tragic to see in somebody you like. Since I’ve known him (YOT stayed at our house 4 or 5 times o ver the years, totalling nearly a month), Ray has simultaneously meant well and been full of shit (hence my remark you quoted). A mere year-and-a-half ago, when YOT stayed here, he was in the midst of his love and unity thing, and at the same time he and his friends were laughing at broken homeless people and calling them “bums”. Yet the very same week, Ray had the courage to confront Nazi skins at a YOT show and turned the crowd against them, driving the racists out. Those contradictions are what he’s trying to work out, which is admirable, but it doesn't mean I have to buy or respect the “true believer”path he’s under¬ taken and the phony, serene defense system he’s erected to pretend the ego is no longer hard at work. Tim MRR: Catherine (#78), Tim, Ian! Why do you talk that much about Ian Mackaye and if Poison Idea sucks or not? Fact is that Ian did a lot for the whole underground scene; and I’m sure he still does a lot (with Dischord, etc.), but another fact is that he IS now a cry-baby- wimp! Personally and being absolutely subjec¬ tive, I evaluate Fugazi as a boring band. I don’t care what Ian does now — if he plays in my area I won’t go there for sure. That’s the way it is: you like a band or you don’t like a band. Ian just tries to make his ideas and music available for a larger audience. There’s nothing bad about it. It’s Ian’s own thing, what he wants to do. The only point which really bothers me is the fuckin’ behavior of the folks who glorify Fugazi! Most of the people hadn’t heard of Fugazi when they toured here in Europe a year ago. But they were kissing their feet just be¬ cause of Ian, Minor Threat and Rites of Spring. If Fugazi wouldn’t have such a history, then no one would give a flyin' shit about them. It’s not Ian’s fault — it's the audience’s fault, 'cuz it’s them who're hailing Fugazi as if they’re gods. And I think the cover artwork of the Poison Idea 12” is just an attack on the people who think that Ian is God. Therefore I love the cover of this 12\"! It’s like kicking the king off his horse. I hope a lot of people feel offended! The Poison Idea brothers are real hooligans. It would be a pleasure for me if I could hang out and get pissed together with them. My weight is just 180 lbs (5’9”), so I’m perhaps under¬ weight and they won’t allow me to share my drinks with them... but that doesn’t matter. Everyone who’s well-known in the scene will be put down sooner or later— mostly for dumb reasons — so we all shouldn’t care too much about this all. I had a good laugh on this 12“ cover, and I’m sure there will be a Tim Yohannan cover if time would release an LP of his band where you can hear some bad boring music. Fortunately Tim’s too old for that. Long live the rudeness! Helge Schreiber, Dudelerstr. 17B, 4200 Ober- hausen 11, W.

Hoode Dearest MRR, My opinion of the GODFLESH \"Streetcleaner” LP differs from Tim Yohannan’s. I would appreciate some space to have my views printed in OUR most gracious rag. You call Streetcleaner “boring\"? Well, to each his own, but to me it’s some of the most powerful and most frightening music ever re¬ corded. Godflesh is so heavy their sound makes me want to hide under the couch. The sound is aware. But, hey, if you prefer boring, generic, straight-off-the-assembly-line hardbore, then cool. At least the Glaser Bros who put the Godflesh masterpiece at the head of their Top 15 have their shit together. They also got the spelling right on the new Butthole EP. It’s Widower Maker, not Widow Maker, like it is called in the review section of issue 79. Love and Peace, Billy Blizzard, Salt Lake City, Utah. P.S. Watch for Slaughter Christ. Dear Sean and Friends, When I read your letter, I didn’t know whether to laugh or be pissed. But I took it with a grain of salt and laughed. In fact, I haven’t had a good laugh in awhile before reading you letter. Uh-oh, I forgot that laughter might be hedonism, and that’s a no-no. So I now repent and rid myself of those nasty hedonistic, bisexual tendencies I have. Also I gave up oral sex, kissing, cunnilingus, and even contraceptives because, as you said, “The only true purpose for sex, as nature intended, is for reproduction.” Scratch masturbation, too; that’s hedonistic. So I now sit here “fondling” tofu. That’s ok, isn’t it? Well, I must go now and fuck my big strong boyfriend and petite girlfriend. After that I think I’ll have a steak. Good-bye, dude! Sincerely yours, A Pathetic Slave To Desire P.S. Homos and bis don’t “like little boys,\" as you claim. I personally like big boys who eat their Wheaties. P.P.S. We are everywhere. Dear Timmy and 'zine reviewers, I greatly enjoy your ‘zine and read it cover to cover in a couple of days. Then I wait impa¬ tiently for next month’s issue. Maybe you should come out weekly. (Wishful thinking.) On to a more serious note. I think it’s great you review the “nasty\" publications in \"Between the Lions” and we basically know what’s shit and what’s not. But, I’ve got one question. Why put their addresses? Yeah, you can review it and all, but why cater to them? After all, you state in the beginning that classifieds shouldn’t be racist, sexist, fascist. Aren’t ‘zines included? Please don’t turn into another Flipside. And for all you Mykel Board types, sure, racists can have free speech, but let them do it elsewhere. Until then, wreak havoc! Pat/ 3413-115th Lane N.W./ Coon Rapids, MN 55433 P.S. Everyone in Minneapolis and surround¬ ing areas who are getting beat up by blacks because of mistaken identity, why don’t you try talking to them? It’s not that hard. Dear Maximum Rock’n’Roll, Thanks for the good review you gave our band “Last Cry” in issue #79. However there are a few corrections I’d like to make. First, contrary to the info in that tape, we never did break up. We just had a hard time finding musicians who wanted to play our style of music (77 punk) and who weren’t prejudiced against our sincerity. Fortu¬ nately, we did find what we were looking for last spring and are looking forward to playing shows and recording. Which brings to mind the second correction. Write to us at the following address, not the one in Philly (and no we don’t live in the fuckin’ suburbs!) for info & better quality tapes to: Last Cry do Roy Grube/ 629 East 5th St./ Bethle¬ hem, PA 18015. Say Eric, how 'bout some royalties? Dear Max R&R. This letter is addressed to Mike Bullshit (what a fitting name) in number 79. Where do you get off referring to the Bad Brains as Jesse Helms, Skrewdriver, Nazis blah, blah, blah. That’s re¬ tailed and its the most stupid thing I've ever read. You haven’t even heard the song! They are simply expressing their feelings and taking a stand in their religious beliefs. I bet if the song advocated buttfucking youre mouth would water. Homosexu¬ ality is an abomination in god’s eyes. Max R&R prints so much discusting and perverted material that its amazing that one band comes along speaking their mind and giving praise to god and the fags shit their pants! To tell you the truth, I’m sick fo anything having to do with homosexuals (the act in itself) but I feel they have the right to print and record their shit just as I have a right not to read or listen to it also. In “dont blow bubbles” the B.B.’s are pleading with gays to give up their vile lifestyle and come to god or reap the con- siquences. Max R&R stands for freedom of ex¬ pression be you a limp wristed fag or a humble servant of god. Everyone has something that offends them and you’re asking Max R&R to censor or put down something you don’t condone. Tough shit. I don’t condone you. How the hell can you even mention the bad Brains with that other shit? One similarity with something bad doesent make it bad. I spank my little cousin sometimes when he’s bad. that doesn’t make me a child molester and murderer! Read the bible and get a life! Tyler Davis/822 Queen Anne Ave. N./Seatde, WA 98109 P.S. Don’t blow bubbles dude! Tyler, Get a brain! Tim Hello, This letter is directed to that little ubermen- schfascist wet-dream, Sean of Vegan Reich (Oooh, triumph of the will, dude!). You seek to deny PLEASURE, which is to deny LIFE, for it is an integral part of human nature. To deny pleasure has nothing to do with \"strength and self-disci¬ pline\", it has to do with SELF-LOATHING (cuttin’ off yer nose to spite yer face, y’know?). You are re¬ ducing the GIFT of LIFE to a self-hating automa¬ ton-like existence. Even though you are contra¬ dicting your whole argument by having a band and creating music (a useless pleasurable [although in the case of Vegan Reich, that’s debatable] FRILL), and smokescreens about promoting your pathetic ethic won’t buy ya out of that. To live is to FUCK (not procreate), to EAT (Meat is tasty!), to get FUCKED UP, just because these serve no constructive purposes is moot. No one should have to live a life that is 100% productive at all times, it’s a disgusting burden no one needs to bear. One other thing-rape has nothing to do with SEX, it has to do with violence and hatred of women (the majority of times, a rapist will not even come), it is a physical expression of subjugation, and nothing else. Sean, you seem like an angry little boy who cannot have fun, and therefore you want to wipe it off the planet (NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, CHUM, as long as this meat-eatin’, drugtakin’, hedonist is armed and ready to blow away idiots like you like ducks inna barrel). Yes, obsession with drugs, sex, etc., can be detrimen¬ tal, but it has nothing to do with weakness, no Sean, you’re weaker from your OBSESSIVE FEAR OF WEAKNESS, which is horse and buggy think¬ ing from a dead era. As far as your views on homosexuality, I myself cannot imagine being attracted to males, but if someone else chooses to do so, it’s none of my goddamn business. And anyone who wants to dictate to others how to live their lives,is sicker, in my opinion, than a homo¬ sexual could ever be. And while we’re at it, three- quarters of the planet’s air comes from underwa¬ ter vegetation (in the sea), and the “final days\" are quite a while off in the distance, but Sean, yours may be sooner. Lastly, without that \"evil” capital¬ istic system, there’d be no HardLine records; are ya gonna be giving 'em out free \"to each according to their own needs\"? Since \"Property is theft\" toss 'em to me, I need to shingle my roof. Oh yeah, what’s a rampant anti-capitalist doing in Laguna Beach? I guess leeching off your parents isn’t a sign of weakness, either. In summary, you’re an idiot. Steve G. To MRR and its readers: In the issue 79, you printed a scene report from Brazil that’s full of shit to say the least. So I’d like to do some questions to the editors of Esounk zine: a) Do you really come to think that COLERA is a commercial band? They have been playing powerful HC for about 10 years whereas most bands who started to play together with them (such as RATOS DE PORAO, INOCENTES, etc.) sold out to major labels (e.g. Roadrunner, RCA — multi-nationals!). Ask any of the people whom COLERA had been involved with in their Euro¬ pean tour (1987) and they can testify about that. If you still think like past bands like that you’re a misinformed idiot. b) Were in the past bands like CAPITAL INICIAL, CAMISA DE VENUS, etc. punk bands? They’ve never been nothing but pop commercial bands with a slight punk influence in their attitude. c) But the worst thing in this report is the highlight the writer gives to nationalist/macho bands such as VIRUS 27 and HISTERIA. One of these days HISTERIA did as interview for a TV network stating they support the attitudes of skin¬ heads from Sao Paulo. Well I can name a few of their actions and among them are rape, drug dealing, armed robbery and I have from good sources they killed over 500 people in street fights. I'm really ashamed that so many people all over the world are going to get such bad impres¬ sions about the scene in Brazil but that’s the sad truth. We’re not going to put our addresses here for obvious reasons. The Hardcore Brigade from Sao Paulo/ Brazil MRR, In MRR #79, the \"What’s The Scoop?\" section should have been called “Here’s The Poop\", I'm refering to three morons inparticular. A guy named Matthew from Chicago, and the idiot twins from Miami, Barbie and Aya. Now if what they said was a joke, then disregard this. But if these three were serious, then they’re delirious. Barbie says that drugs should be legal so that the people who do them can kill themselves and be “washed away\". Matthew wants drug dealers either in prison or sent to Eastern bloc countries so they can be shot. He also thinks users should be jailed. Aya Goober also thinks drugs should be legal, including heroin, but a sec¬ ond later she says the government should come down hard on hard drugs, what the fuck is heroin? Something you buy at a 7-11 ? She ends with the sentence \"everyone in the scene that does drugs should be beaten up by really big str8 edge people”. Well if she’s not joking, I’m recommend¬ ing she be put on GG Allin’s rape list. If I deserve a beating, she deserves a night of heated passion with the love master himself. Matthew, you should be locked up just becuz you're a fucken asshole, you would lock people up for having fun. Fuck you, with your destructive stupidity, if a drug dealer killed you, oh well, you’d like to see them dead for doing what they do regardless of the reason, so if they dfi kill someone, I hope it’s someone like you. Barbie, you sound like a Barbie, ora bunny or some other name that reeks of ignorance. You may think you’re one of the “better people\" cuz you don’t do drugs, but drugs have little to do with somebody being good or bad. The question is are you smart enough to judge people by their values and principles, instead of condemning people for drug use, in your case, no. All three of you wish harm upon dealers and users whether they've done something wrong or not, you three sound like those racists who say “Thank God for AIDS”. Well, I wish serious harm upon you three for being so fuckin' arrogant and ignorant. Now on to other subjects. Did the Process sacrifice the Irish Rocker? Is he being held for LSD experiments? I miss his column very much. To Slapshot’s Choke, why don't you choke on a dildo asshole. Stikky is a far better, cooler, funnier, and smarter band than Slapshot will ever be. One of these days, hopefully soon, someones’ gonna shove that hockey stick up your dumb ass. You could never replace Springa, and for a str8 edge person, you sound like a dumb drunk. Stikky’s brand of geekcore is great, they’re cool people, but it’s you who’s the geek. Why must you always write “Boston\" on everything? It’s idiots like you that give Boston a bad smell. Too bad that 70’s band, Boston, used that name, it would have been perfect for you. Then you wouldn’t have to write “Slapshot-Boston”, you could just write “Boston” instead. Wouldn’t that make you prouder than a teenaged Klansman at his first cross burning? I think so. To Jimmy Doom - FUCK YOU, go mastur¬ bate with your flag and your bible, fool. Stinky Panch, 3594 Plumbago Lane, San Diego, CA 92154. Hey Stinky Panch, are you serious ? You 're a total contradiction, saying thatifAya’s not joking she deserves to be an object of your sexism and raped, not to mention wishing u serious harm\" on all three of them. We don't know you, how do we know you’re not joking ? I was tempted to call you a wiener and leave it at that but I guess I had to explain myself. Stinky u My socks are toxic\" Morf Dear MRR, An Alternative??????????????? There is a lot of talk over what punk is, a D.I.Y. spirit, an alternative, etc. There is also a lot of criticism of where the punk movement is fucked, a ghetto, sexist, consumerist, etc. Most zines you pick up have an article with various views and opinions on it. A lot of bards have good songs and criticisms about this, \"Chickenshit Conformist\" (Dead Ken- nedys), “Leather, Bristles, Studs and Ignorance\" (Anti System); I could go on: \"Piss in the Ocean,\" \"Punk is Dead,\" etc. I’m not going to write a critique of punk, just an attack on the shitty idea of an alternative—I mean who gives a shit? Kylie Min- ogue or Jason Donavon or whoever else the next 15 minutes of fame belongs to is no threat to me, the most an alternative can supply is a bit less dosh for multi-national record labels, but that’s not exactly a big deal is it? Most of the the so called “indie\" record labels are run or owned or distrib¬ uted by very dodgy people anyway. Stuff the idea of being alternative, I think it’s a load of shit. My idea of what a real “alternative\" movement should be about is not play safe middle of the road stance, but an active outward looking movement doing its best to kick in the shit that surrounds us all. The problem is it all too easily becomes rhetoric, chant out your favourite bands, but there is a big gap between the rhetoric and the action. I suppose it depends on what your looking for but if creating change is part of it, forget looking for an alterna¬ tive, put your energies into something that will directly create change, DIRECT ACTION. I would be interested in any comment from any MRR readers. I also put out a zine called Eat Shit if anyone is interested. Dave/ Box 8/ 82 Colston St/ Bristol UK P.S. Nothing will change if you sit there and take it. MRR, How interesting that the BAD BRAINS find it acceptable to sing about how AIDS is “his cure” for homosexuality. How come we don’t hear them also sing about how sickle cell anemia, a fatal disease which strikes only black people, is “His way\" of eliminating the black race? How come we don’t hear them sing about how the shift of AIDs victims is moving, away from the gay population and increasing in the black population? Because they’re stupid bigots, that’s why. Typical short¬ sighted narrow-minded bigots. Dawn Z/ PO Box 22931/ Baltimore, MD 21203 East Bay Eric/Scum Pit: Hello. I enjoy your section in MRR im¬ mensely in the December issue. You forgot to include a record in the Angry Samoans discogra¬ phy. I have a copy of \"Yesterday Started Tomor¬ row\" 12\" on Bad Trip Records, a plain white cover (promo-type). It has the same six songs as the PVC release, but it has no title on it. The music is copyrighted for 1986.1 got it at one of their shows out here in 86,1 believe, or it could have been ’87. I’m pretty sure it was '86. Maybe you should call Metal Mike and check this out. Keep up the great column. Bob Conrad/ PO Box 7952/ West Trenton, NJ 08628 Dear MRR, Yeah, I know no one cares about this kind of stuff, but here’s the corrections to the Novem¬ ber MRR's Scumpit column discography: Yester¬ day Started Tomorrow (Bad Trip), 1000 pressed w/ handstamped; Yesterday Started Tomorrow (PVC) 10,000 pressed (vinyl/ cassette); Back From Samoa (PVC), 10,000 pressed (LP/cas- sette); Inside My Brain (PVC), 10,000 pressed (LP/cassette); 31 Garbage Pit Hits (PVC), 3,000 CDs only. And the only 2,000 CDs pressed of STP Not LSD (on PVC) are locked up forever at Techni- Disc, 2250 Meijer Drive, Troy Michigan, 48084... if anyone wants to get ambitious and own the world’s only copy of a non-issued CD. I wouldn’t, CDs suck. Let your conscience be your guide. Wayne Davis/ Panorama City, CA. MRR, “I’m sick of freaks being in the scene” said Choke of Slapshot in MRR #78. Perhaps Choke should get out of the scene if he doesn’t like it. Since when did punk involve looking normal. Never! It is bands like Slapshot who have turned the US hardcore scene into one that is male dominated, jock-like, and conservative, where looking and acting straight is expected. Perhaps these bands need to be reminded what punk really is. Punk is a counter-culture. A counter culture with its own music, beliefs, and dress. There many beliefs in the punk movement, (anarchism, com¬ munism, nihilism, libertarianism, etc...) but all of them counter main-stream beliefs, nationalism, sexism, fascism, homophobia and other oppres¬ sive ideas and veliefs have no part in punk. Dressing weird is also a part of punk. Purple hair, mohawks, and spike hair are just a few ways of looking deviant. Punk dress is non conforming. Yet, one does not have to dress like the punk stereotype. Dress usually is dirty-looking, shock¬ ing, unkept, unconservative, and different from main-stream fashion. Dressing like a jock is not punk. Of course dressing punk means nothing, if your beliefs are conservative and oppressive. Everyone in the scene has an opinion on this issue. I’d like to hear your opinion. Write to: Alex/ 1977 Highridge/ Ottawa, Ont./ K1H 5H1/ Canada. To MRR, I am writing in response to the hypocrisy and favoritism of one of your contributors, Dave of Sockeve . The first time I noticed the B.S. he was passing off as insight was in his letter in #75. At first I thought his letter was a fair deception of the schism that exists in the Cleveland scene (no “positive unity\" at work here folks). The more I thought about it the more I noticed his extreme bias, though. Confront’s “ambulance\" threat is meant to be, and usually is by anyone with more I.Q. points then goldfish, in the same manner as \"you want a knuckle sandwich? “ and other classic Three Stooges lines. It’s just their brand of violent humor. Your joke about peaceful Nazis was obvi¬ ously in bad taste but then again, you are entitled to your opinion. Your insights on the rest of the show were probobly accurate with a few excep¬ tions. 1.)Dwid, the singer of Die-Hard, wouldn’t be caught dead wearing Adidas. 2.) The skinhead who was the “victim\" of Dwid’s verbal abuse is one of a group of Nazis that go to shows and write shit on the walls but won't admit openly to being Nazi’s. I guess they're peaceful Nazis just like you, eh? But this is not what upset me the most. It was the scene report in the same issue in which your attitude changed. You wrote about this show prior to it happening and your openmindedness just showed through. You said Outface is a putzy S.E. band but you don’t really know do you? And False Hope is a big crappy band? They happen to be one of the most original bands in Cleveland. I don’t see Sockeye opening up for Agnostic Front and Bad brains. Why did you bother sayina shit about them anyway, they aren’t Straight Edge. In the next report you said the last one got you in trouble so now you’ll just cover the bands you can say nice things about. So why not change it from a scene report to a “ these are my friends, their cool and your not “ report. You mostly only write about Sockeye any way. At this point you might say \"If you’re so cool, why don’t you write the scene report.\" Well, for one thing I don't live in Cleveland, I live in Dayton and here there isn’t a scene worth writing about. It seems to me in other scenes the reports do a decent job of covering all types of bands. Those reports usually just cover what a band is doing, not how cool they are. And now something about your band, Sockeye, gods of Ohio if I was to believe your reports . I you are as open minded as you claim to be why songs like “Straight Edge Fag\" (a little homophobic perhaps?) and \"vegetarians are wimps.\" Yep, definitely the most open mind I have ever seen.

We cannot succeed however, without the contributions aad support of a fairly large number of people About ten months ago, I had a letter in an issue of MRR asking whether or not a body of punk literautre existed, and if not, why not. In response, R J. Le8ch of Minneapolis wrote suggesting we start a punk literary maga¬ zine. So, in classic D-l-Y fashion, R.J. and I have put together such a thing, named Jhs. Mothra Effect . A free, eight-page sampler issue is already out, and by the time this is printed, hopefully, the first 32-page full issue will be out. We intend to make this a quarterly if at all possible, but to do so, we will need a steady stream of quality material. We need short stories, essays, poetry, art and graphics, and book and movie reviews with a punk/underground slant to theme We are going so far as to pay cash (Ic/wofd) for short stories, essays, etc. Payments for artwork are negotiable, and poetry will be paid for with free copies. I will make this clear right now: we are dedicated to producing a top-shelf product, so not all submis¬ sions will be used. But dammit, we believe there are huge nembers of talented, creative people out there who are looking for some way to strengthen the whole punk scene, so send us your stuff! All manuscripts should be sent to Larry Howes/ 15 Edwards St #16/ Springfield, MA 01105. Single copies of issue #1 will be on sale for $2.00 postpaid, and yearly subscriptions will fetch you four issues for $7.00. Advertising space will also be sold real cheap (indy record/tape produc¬ ers take note~) To buy #1 or to inquire about advertising, contact R J. Lesch/ Mothra Effect/ P.O. Box 2752/ Minneapolis, MN 55402. #1 fea¬ tures an excellent interview with underground writer Peter Plate. To put it right out on the line: I got into punk about a decade ago, because it seemed to me that finally people with something to say were coming together in a way that we could make ourselves be heard. Today, more than ever, the establishment, mainstream culture reveals its total bankruptcy. No longer does the mainstream pro¬ duce Hemingways, Heilmans, etc. Go to your local bookstore and examine the decay firsthand, the shelves packed with Sidney Sheldon, Judith Krantz, and such garbage. This is the information age? Meanwhile, our own punk culture has slowly eroded its own visionary aspects, quietly decay¬ ing into a few predictable musical, political, and fashion cliches. Punk has proven repeatedly that it can be reborn, but each time it has required that intelligent, dedicated, creative people step for¬ ward and forge a new vision. Are we aiming too high? If we have to do it on our own, of course. But as part of a larger effort, we think Mothr a Effect can help rekindle the energy and creativity that has always characterized punk at its best. Please help us—we know you’re out there! Sincerely, Larry Howes PS Book/record store owners that could take a few copies of Mothra Effect on consign¬ ment should also contact R.J. M.R.R. Readers, Congratulations! Your relentless 1 -800 calls to Hal Lindsey have caused Hal to change his number and cost him thousands of dollars! His new number if you're calling from California is 1- 800-848-8735 . We’re not sure about the number you call if you’re calling from outside the state. Write in if you know it. Focus on the Family, another right wing religious organization working to end a woman’s right to choose, reports a mys¬ terious shortfall in funds and claims to be on the brink of bankruptcy. Help them along - call 1 -800- 232-6459 and order their free magazine, Focus on the Citizen. The Citizen zine reports nationally on the religious rights latest hate campaigns. Last month they advocated boycotting Nintendo games and corporations that donate money to planned parenthood. If nothing else you get a free humor magazine. Call Jerry Falwell at 1-800-538-8585 and 1-800-332-6789. Falwell’s back into politics backing Ollie North. Ollie’s number is 1-800-241- 1600. Falwell’scohortTim LeHay, whoco-founded the moral majority and the Institute for Creation Research can be robbed of a dollar by calling 1- 800-962—1022. Make a list of these numbers and call often. All of these organizations are extremely political; they pay no taxes, hiding behind their tax free religious status they can raise mil¬ lions of dollars to elect right wing candidates, fund censorship campaigns and generally work to dismantle the bill of rights. If enough of us call on a regular basis we can cause a serious drain in their money supply. Anon Dear MRR, I’m living in Austria but my “home country\" is Yugoslavia so that I’m very interested in all that which happens in Eastern Europe. Austria is rather close to Germany so that we’re well informed about the things going on in East Germany. A reunification of the 2 German Countries is impossible. Maybe in 30 or 40 years but surely NOT in the near future. Open minded people in Germany know that.The other ones are anticom¬ munists, conservative, monarchists and nazis who’d like to live in a BIG STRONG GERMANY. The fact is that most of the people in East Germany don’t even want to be a part of capital¬ ism and still believe in their land. All the people who prefer West Germany already left and now live there. The others are at home and want to change their country. One of the slogans of these people is “We’ll stay here\". Another problem is that some of the reuni¬ fication fans would like to have a Germany as big as it was in 1937 or even 1918. That’s impossible! It means that the western part of Poland should be given back to the Germans. Many Polish people still haven’t forgotten all the Nazi crimes in their land and the demands of the reunification fans just lead to more misunderstanding and hate. There is also the question of which bloc the new big Germany should belong. The Soviets would never allow East Germany to become a part of NATO! An independent Germany isn’t possible, it’s too important for the European Community, the States and Soviet Union. Finally I'd like to say that I wish there were one German country but it’s very hard to realize it and I’m not an utopian. Everything takes time to be done and so will this problem. Surely, some day there will be just one Germany but we shouldn’t try to get it as fast as possible for any price. Tiberiju/ Potschnerg. 9/ 2500 Baden/ Austria A PUBLIC LETTER TO ANTI-RACIST SKINS Recently Utne Reader ran an article about skinheads and how various racists were trying to organize them. The story also included informa¬ tion about anti-racist skins who earlier this year got together in Minneapolis and hooked up the \"Syndicate\", as an anti-racist umbrella group. The article went on to say that these anti-racist and revolutionary minded skins are, “attacked by the media and avoided by most other progressives\" and the question was asked, \"where are the allies of the anti-racist skinheads?\" I can’t answer that question fully, but I can and will loudly and strongly say, here is some solid support. Jaan Lauman supports you, Ohio 7 people supportyou, North American anti-imperialist guer¬ rillas support you, the anti-imperialist movement supports you, other captured guerrillas and revo¬ lutionaries white, black, latino, Indians support you! Although I’m not here officially speaking for any specific organizations or groups of people, I am one of the Ohio 7, a captured guerrilla/political prisoner. And I can and do say that the North American anti-imperialist movement and the vari¬ ous organizations both underground and up front groups, stand with and support the fight against white supremacy as a central part of the revolu¬ tionary struggle as a whole. There are many ways to fight racism and support national liberation struggles, but our movement knows and most definitely those of us from the underground know, that this fight has to be waged forcefully and by all means necessary in the streets, to be for real. White supremacy and racism ain’t got noth¬ ing coming and the clear way you anti-racist skins move on it, gets strong support and admiration from people like me. As a white working class man, I have per¬ sonal knowledge of how racism (sexism is used in similar ways) has been and continues to be the main obstacle and weapon used against poor and working people - the old divide and conquer game. In order to achieve the necessary unity to kick the capitalist ruling class out and take this country and land back for us, the people who actually sweat and work to row and make the things of this life, we have to recognize and support the right of oppressed nations to decide their own future. This means colonies of the USA like Puerto Rico and the New African/Black nation within the US, as well as Indian people, have to have the right to freedom. These people and nations are the main allies of the working class and of us white working class north Americans too. Racism has no place in our ranks and the struggle against it is one of the main fights we have to wage in order to win anything. So, I say straight ahead to you anti-racist skins - you know what to do and how to do it. You are not alone and the future is ours to win! FREE¬ DOM IS A CONSTANT STRUGGLE! Jaan Laaman (Ohio 7), Leavenworth prison - 9/ 18/89 P.S. The Ohio 7 are a group of white work¬ ing class women and men, parents, captured with their children in 1984 - 85, after one of the longest and largest police operations in history. They are long time political activists who were part of the revolutionary underground. The government has charged them with being part of the Sam Melville - Jonathan Jackson Unit and the United Freedom Front; clandestine organizations who have claimed responsibility for many armed actions against targets like South African government offices, US military facilities and multinational corporate sites. Most of the Ohio 7 are in prison with large sen¬ tences. Presently some of them are on trial for Se¬ dition rn Springfield Mass. For more information on the 0-7 contact the Sedition Committee. Dear MRR. Hello. Even though it’s a bit late, I wanted to comment on the subject of the “drug war\" involv¬ ing Colombia, discussed in an anonymous letter and Lawrence Livermore’s column in MRR #78.1 am a Colombian-born 18-year-old. I’d lived in the U.S. (Syracuse) from '80 to ’86, when I had to go back to Colombia, and I just came back last March. My hometown is Medeliin and first of all let me tell you, it’s not the hell the media makes it out to be! The violence is pretty awful and the army and politicians that run the country aren’t too great either, but there’s also a lot of good to be found -— a lot of cultural activity, a lot of good people, and the country itself is very beautiful. Anyway, I 1 mostly approve of Lawrence’s assessment of the \"drug war\" — that the U .S. just wants to stamp out the competition in order to have the monopoly on the coke trade. I was very angry and worried when the U.S. decided to send over the couple of hundred soldiers and advisors, because these advisors might just happen to have been training the Colombian military in other “anti-subversion” practices, such as torture and more effective death squads — which is what probably hap¬ pened. Also, the military equipment that the U.S. sent over was not appropriate for what they were supposedly sent for, but was more apt for anti¬ guerrilla tactics...hmm. And if they really expect the peasants to stop planting the coca plants, they’d give them some kind of alternative. \"Just don’t plant” is like “Justt say no’’— it’s totally irra¬ tional! On the other hand, I really do hope the coke kingpins are caught, for they are sick scum. But It’s so incredibly hard, with the enormous amounts of money these people throw around — they can buy anybody. For example, when I was there, they attempted to catch P. Escobar in his townhouse (everybody there knows where it is), but every time they would try, one of his informants in the army would ring him up and let him know before¬ hand, so he always had enough time to fly away in a helicopter or through a tunnel or whatever way he uses to escape. And it’s hard to blame the people who are bought off by these nuts. I mean it’s like anybody who s giving them any sort of trouble, they go and make that person an offer — either you behave and take these millions of pesos or we kill you. Honestly, what would YOU do in that position?! And now I hear Bushman plans to visit Colombia in February? Ha ha — good luck! They’ll have to ship over like a thou¬ sand security agents or something! I really don’t know what’s gonna happen to Colombia — I just hope it doesn’t turn into a total right wing police state or another Vietnam. All I know is there’s gonna be a lot more blood spilt before this mess is over. Legalization would be a good thing but then again the U.S. government, wouldn’t like that. Well, it’s 3 am and I’m getting tired. Thank you for reading, if you did. Any response would be appreciated, especially from the NYC area (I need friends!) And one more thing: when are you grin¬ gos gonna finally learn how to spell Colombia right fer chrissakes? Geez! Keep up the good work, MRR. “Hi!\" to all my pals! Chris Trent from L..A., Ian from Sydney, where the hell are you?! OK,bye. Juan “Valdez\" Duque/ 77-03 24th Ave 2nd floor/ Jackson Hts., NY 11370 To MRR, Some of you might have heard about what happened up here at the university in Montreal. If you didn’t, I think you should. There was a guy who killed 14 women. Just women. He seperated the two genders before shooting. It seemed that he blamed women for his unhappiness in life. Then I read in the newspaper that some anti-femi¬ nist says it regretable that it happened but he can understand why it happened. He says that an anti-feminist backlash was bound to happen because women have been pushing to hard, alienating men and things like that. That made me sick. I couldn't beleive what this guy was saying. In the face of what just happened this guy had the nerve to practicaly justify the violence against the women. Guys make me sick, and I am one. I sit at work and hear jokes against women, at school, anywhere I go I hear them. They are usually told by the guys who are married or have girlfriends. These guys are such stinking hypocrites. I would like to say to all you girls to just dump your boyfriends and your husbands and just not take even the least little bit of shit from anyone. But that’s not a very practical idea. It would probably result in more “anti-feminist backlash\". I realize that it’s going to take more (if this would be possible) than having every woman united and standing up for the equality and respect that they deserve. It’s going to take the guys as well. The males in our society are the only ones who can change the other males attitudes. It’s sad but its true. It’s going to take guys to stand up and show the courage to be alienated from the pack of chauvanist idiots that call themselves male. It’s going to take a lot of time and probably a lot more blood before results start happening. Maybe what happened in Montreal will restart the sexual revolution—it wasn’t just about fucking you know. It seems to hav e stagnated no matter how hard women tried. People just don’t seem to care. Maybe now guys will open they’re eyes and not dismiss Montreal as just one isolated incident, but see it as something thats affecting us all. Steve, in Canada Dear Readers, My name is Eric Astor and I run Stepfor- ward Records. We are closing shop here and wanted to clear up some problems we had during the summer to the present. Wind of Change, which is now defunct and which I was part of, toured last summer, leaving Stepforward with a friend. He could have made some mistakes but did a damn good job for the circumstances. When I got home at the end of July, I had two weeks to catch up with mail and the rest of Stepforward. August 15th I had a major brain sur¬ gery that put me out for a long period of time. I now have caught up for the most part, but if there is anybody that has not received an order or any other mix-up, please contact me. Also, many pen-pals have been broken off due to the time period. If you folks could get ahold of me, that would be really great. One more note: Wind of Change merchan¬ dise and Stepforward were a totally separate operation. If you have had a problem with W.O.C., call the man responsible: Jason Peterson at 602- 820-2792 or write him at 935 W. Olla/ Mesa, AZ 85210. I hope this has cleared this issue up.

Thanx to all that have supported me and all other zines, labels and bands, xxx Dear MRR, Great big hello from Wisconsin. This is Dave from INSPECTOR 12. In the December issue (#79) it was reported in the Minnesota scene report that we were from Mankato, MN. Well just to clear this mistake up, I though I’d write (we’re from Madison, Wisconsin). I’d also like to thank everyone who bought our 7” EP (it’s now sold out, but Blacklist has the last remaining copies). Please look for our upcoming LP. Thanks for your time. Inspector 12 c/o Dave/ 504 Crestview Dr./ Madi¬ son, Wl 53716 P.S. Also a great big thank you/hello to the rocking Libido Boyz. Dear MRR, Soz this letter isn’t being typed, and soz if I spell words the English way (eg. color, UK colour). I'm writing in about John Yates in the guest opinion column. He states that Thatcherism is now'towards an end in England and the last time her popularity was as low as this we had a war with Argentina about the Falkland Islands (a good 10,000 miles away from Britain; dead close to Argentina). He reckoned that Thatcher will start a war in Northern Ireland. What’s all happening there? The next war us stupid British will fight, will be against the 11 other nations on the EEC. She disagrees with everything the other 11 leaders have agreed on and she comes back to Britain thinking she has done a great job for the people of Britain. Fuck you Thatcher. The next time we’ll have an election I shall be old enough (I’m 16 at the moment) and I shall try and vote you out. To Lance Hahn: your opening line of the Wat Tyler LP review: \"I guess Wat Tyler was some important historical figure\", is completely true. He was one of the leaders of the Peasant Revolt movement and was “quartered\" when it failed. This revolt happened because of an unfair tax over 500 years ago. Well, it’s 1989 (soon 1990) and here we have the Poll Tax, another unfair tax. My Mom failed to register for the tax and will be fined heavily by Lewisham Borough Council, supposedly a socialist burough. This Poll Tax is causeing Thatchers umpopularity and that’s why Wat Tyler proberably got their name. While I’m here I would like to get in touch with Bonnie from “North\" who was featured in your \"What’s the Scoop?” (#79) feature. If she thinks I’m a mad eccentric English man, then what can I do about it? Other people can write to me, that’s what. I’m aged 16, I'm a vegetarian and I like all kinds of music such as the Smiths, Inspiral Car¬ pets, the Fall as well as Napalm Death, Fugazi, aMudhoney, and loads others. If Bonnie does decide to write, then please send a photograph so I know it’s you. That’s it MRR. Darren J Maughan/ 2 Beverley House, Brang- bourne Rd/ Bromley, Kent, BR1 4LN/ England Dear MRR, After reading the letter in issue #79 by Todd Denney, I was pretty blown away. I thought, \"Wow, a kind, intelligent human being living so close to me!\" But after staying up to 4:00 am (the night before an exam) writing a reply, I was so disappointed to find my letter returned with \"At¬ tempted, not known\" printed on it. So, Todd, if you’re still alive, please contact me. Call collect even. Peace, Luv, and Anarchy, Kris Contagious/ 2634 Sunnyside Cir/ Palm Har¬ bor, FI. 34684/ (813)-784-3947 Dear Friends, I wonder if you can help me out? Recently I was speaking with a friend about the group Laibach. I’m sure you have heard of them. Re¬ cently they covered Sympathy for the Devil and the Let It Be album. My friend says they are left wing. I saw from what I can tell they are right wing, or some kind of third position - anti-amerikkan, and anti-soviet. Can you set us straight. Many of their Ips and tee shirtsa have nazi stuff on them, also in No KKK Spring/ Summer issue page 19, a read mentions industrial music of which I think Laibach is considered, and two other groups. One is slave state on the Arbeit tape label, and Terre Blanche on AWB. Can you send us the addresses of these groups? We are trying to put together a list of racist musicians for a letter writing cam¬ paign. Myself and some other anti-racist punks and skins rent this box together. Please help us. Send us as much anti¬ racist lit. you can and keepo us up to date on racist groups if possible. We’re a fighting crew and can spread lot of lit. around. Thanks a lot!

George is a manager of sorts for 7 SECONDS — you might remember him as the guy who wrote a letter a few months ago to MKK complaining about unfair treatment of the band. 1 mentioned to him that maybe someone from the band should have written that letter instead of George, which is when he gave me that \"artist\" line. 7 SECONDS are artists, he told me, professional musicians. OK, but in George's letter he gave the im¬ pression that the band was getting their shit straight and getting back to the grassroots, and I had a few questions about that. Like why are they still playing ridiculously ex¬ pensive shows set up by sleazy, shyster promoters? Well, George explained, as far as deal- -that's who their fiy don't they get some members of their \"family tree together and book the tours themselves? Too expensive and time consuming, sez George. Why are their gigs so expensive? Because they need money to eat ana pay the rent and pay the phone bills. So why don't they get jobs? The band is theirjob, Kevin drove a cab for years in Reno and Troy washed dishes at a fucking restaurant (Oh, the horrible injus¬ tice of it all) and they're sick of it, the band is theirjob now. Whatever, if 7 SECONDS wants to be professional musicians, that's their business and I really don't have any problem with that, although I wish they wouldn't try and make it sound like the/re getting back to dealing with things on a grassroots level. And it might be nice if someone in the band had the nuts to come out and confirm that they have no intention of lowering their guarantees at gigs, releasing records on an independently owned record label or other¬ wise getting back to the no bullshit, do it yourself philosophy that got them on Enigma in the first place. Once again it's been proven to me that people who think of themselves as artists and musicians are pompous, self-righteous knuckleheads. One thing that originally at¬ tracted me to underground music was the attitude that anybody can do it. You don't have to have too much in the way of talent, just something to say and a big mouth to say it with. The myth of musicians being some¬ thing special was shattered, any scnmuck could be in a band. Now you tell me, who's going to be more likely to make good music. Four guys doing nothing but touring, mak¬ ing records anadcaling with band things 24 hours a day, or four guys working lousy jobs or going to school and dealing with the bullshit that the rest of the world nas to deal with every day? If you think about it, most bands put out one or two good records (if they're lucky) and then they start churning out poop. They start believing the bullshit everybody's saying about them, \"Gee, eve¬ rybody likes us! We must be important and special, we must be... MUSICIANS!\" Apd as soon as you become a musician, you start writing songs from a musicians point of view. People expect greatness from you, you have to make an even better record than the first one but instead of looking for new material where it originally came from, (i.e. basic, everyday John Q. Public situations) ou start living off your band, which gives / ou that much needed time to create your oh so important songs. Now that people have started taking you seriously, you start taking yourself seriously and \"creating\" songs as if you're actually more than just a catalyst for basic human experiences, as if these experi¬ ences that propelled you into semi- stardom are something that you invented! So you put but a few records that get slagged off, but you can still draw good sized crowds due mainly to nostalgia, and you attribute the are too closed minded to accept anything new or different. You never thinkthat maybe people think you suck because you no longer share a common ground with them. Ypu are no longer an average schmuck, you &*e an above- average schmuck and wno the fuck can identify with that? You have nothing left to write about except being in a band! It isn't just the lyrics though, it's the feeling you get when you listen to a great song. It's hard to really explain it but 1 read something in Lookout fanzine a couple of years ago where the author was describing drivin' down the highway, listening to the RAMONES on the radio, feeling like laugh¬ ing and crying at the same time and feeline like such a spaz he almost drove off the road that's it! A great song makes you wanna jump up ana down and act like a retard, it makes you wanna play air guitar with the cat, it makes you wanna strip to your skiv¬ vies and beat your chest with rhubarb, and lyrics are really just icing on the cake. When I first heard tne BLACK FLAG Damaged album, I felt like that, when I heard theirlast album I felt like vacuuming. Not many bands can write songs that make you feel like that, but the ones wno can almost always lose it. I don't know what it is but when good bands stay together too Ion they lose something, they become jade i and check into Hotel Maturity and become BORING. It happens to every band eventu¬ ally and the oniy solution is to either live under the illusion that you'rea \"professional musician\" and hope you make it big, or break up. I'm glad KYHTHM PIGS, BIG BLACK, OP IV and CRIMPSHRINE broke up when they did, 'cause I can still listen to reat records by great bands and I'll never ave to hear the crap they would've started j putting out once they started taking them¬ selves seriously. Maybe 7 SECONDS should've finished school, or learned how to do something they like that could actually iport them, keeping the band a part-time, temporary thing. Maybe then they wouldn't be farting around the country playing 10- way past their prime, fhe/ve lost their edge, and BAZOOKA jofe, LIBIDO BOYZ and PINK LINCOLNS (to name but a fewlhave ;ot it. The/re young and lean and me4ji and t won't be long before the/re running $rcles iround 7 SECONDS and kicking th^JBAD BRAINS tired old ass around the block. Out with the old, in with the new. Being a Margi nal Cult Person, I'vebeen leaving New York for a boffo series of unim¬ portant, barely playing gigs anywhere that would take me. Sometimes I even tour to a town that doesn't want me there at all, which is much more interesting and more of a challenge than waiting into a hum drum booked gig. I didn't write a column during that time for my one fan in Screeching Wea¬ sel because it's hard to write or even think when you're sleeping on the floor of the Toronto train station or discovering that pints of beer are only 65 cents in Baltimore. Touring for no money is really fun. I didn't resent it in the least that every town whose dirty basement I performed in had like GWAR, CYCLE SLUTS FROM HELL, BUTTHOLE SURFERS, or the LUNA- CH1CKS playing in a nice gig crowded arena for lots of money. I, uh, probably experi¬ enced a lot more on my visit than they did. Like the closeness you can generate with a really small audience. Plus I had no way of knowing just how serious my cat Alleroy was until 1 got to stay in a club that had five of them. My weirdest tour was sort of acciden¬ tal. Tom Diventi asked me to come down and perform at D.C. Space, in Maryland, so the publisher of my chapbook Where's My Wife. Bruce Issacson from Zeigeist Press, rented a car and we drove down. My friend Elmer Lang, a lanky story-telling guy from Missouri, came along too. Bruce is an ex-businessman who drop¬ ped everything to be apoet and he amazed me by pulling out a Credit Card and just getting a rent-a-car right away. I'll never nave a credit card because under my real name which I've forgotten, I owe $24,000 and I never even dream of renting a car, so with a huge stack of books I set out for D.C. with stars in my eyes. When we got there I called my Aunt, but she just asked if I needed somewhere to stay, like that was the only reason I'd call, ana anyway it was 10 pm and the \"show\" hadn't started yet. So except for my cousin Philip who fixes cars and takes karate, only 11 other people were there. Diventi thought 1 was going to bring my musicians. (I like how people become MY drummer. My gui¬ tarist, it's one of the few forms of fascism lget to practice, and all l had was a grubby stack of essays to read from and nobody laughed in the audience, so it was kind of beat. But then this hippy looking guy hopped in our rent-a-car when everyone was driving to Baltimore to sleep somewhere, and we went to a bar called The Tavern and there were young punks, old beatniks, normal people, metal kids, and everybody was just talking and talking, and I fell in love with Baltimore. Elmer and Bruce went back to return the car the next morning, and 1 stayed in Baltimore and went junking (thrift store shopping) for about three days. It seemed like a town of scavengers because it's a doom town. People can still start businesses (Well, my idea of businesses, like tattoo parlours, costume shops, and underground video stores), buy cheap row housing, and invent their own festivals like \"TeachT3ack\" day, and they know one of the basic tenets of cheap living: you can save a few hundred thousand bucks if you don't need to match. Wear what you find, and yes, you too can save useless hours of labour. They roam around and pick through thrift stores like they^re sifting through the ruins of a fallen civilization, and Uiventi runs Apathy press on the investment of a long neck stapler and a copy shop debt. He has \"Apathy Press - Baltimore\" tattooed on his arm witn a human brain over the \"Balti¬ more\", constantly mooches off his friends, and our host had a thrift store house and constantly coaxed. From Baltimore I took a bus to the tattoo convention in Richmond, Virginia where a thrash metal band from Connecticut was supposed to do a couple of my songs with me. My old carny tattoo artist friend Spider Webb told them to and brought them there. But after I got off a five hour bus ride and found the Holiday Inn there were these four thrash metal kids eating off their meal tab in the Holiday Inn Diner and I looked at them and they looked at me and no, there was no way they were doing to do any fuckin song with any Jennifer Blowdryer. I was pissed ... Here they were, using the Holiday Inn room tab Crazy Ace got for Spider Webb's party, drinking pitchers of beer and eating repulsive Holiday Inn food for free, and they were claiming they couldn't \"learn\" my songs. Well, one song has all of three notes in it, and the other one, \"When We Were On Drugs\", is just a blues riff. Surely even a \"Looks Like\" version of Metallica, like this band was capable of that much. I met a 19-year-old gay boy who made leather things and ran a concession stand with two little guys he called \"the Trolls\" for his boss/boy friend with AIDS, and we fell in love and I got all these cool retro 70s glam leather things he made, and then I decided I was having such a good time at the tattoo convention (which is just guys tattooing, tattoo contests, mugs with photos of you and your date on them, and Ivan The Terrible From Texas making chain mail) that I wanted to learn how to pierce so I could do some¬ thing besides sell three books at the conven¬ tions I went to with Spider Webb. I got so fired up on the idea that I even went to a room with the piercing crew to watch a woman get her nipple pierced, practically taking notes. One reason I can tour like this is because I'm so disgustingly adaptable. But the big show nignt came around. Friday on the tattoo convention floor before GWAR and after a couple of rock n roll type bands, and all I got them to do is play some metal song they wrote while I sang \"Girl¬ friend of Metar over it, and one bad power ey played thrash metal, and 1 g; ond of credibi"
