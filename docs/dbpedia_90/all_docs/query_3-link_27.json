        "text": "Spectacle’s month-long Rockuary series is going full force from the start with a David Markey double feature you can’t afford to miss…\n\nThis Friday at 7:30 p.m. catch Desperate Teenage Lovedolls and, at 9:30 p.m., its follow-up, Lovedolls Superstar. Two girls decide to start a band, find a drummer, a manager and battle it out with rival bands, gangs and anyone else who dares to get in the way. The band’s manager Johnny Tremaine is played by Steven Shane McDonald of Red Kross and Off! and the movies feature music by Red Kross, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, Sonic Youth and more. This is a definitive piece of punk rock history! The screenings are only $5 a pop and are back-to-back.\n\nCatch these and other films about possessed cats, mutilated children and Bob Dylan we’re Reel Psyched about this week.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nHallucinatory Horror: House Presented by Hiro Sake\n\nHiro Sake presents this first screening in an ongoing series at Videology dedicated to Asian cinema and culture. This month’s movie is a J-Horror cult classic made in 1977 by director Nobuhiko Obayashi. House is a hallucinatory trip through the surreal and extremely demented, as a group of classmates encounter evil spirits, a demonic piano, and a devilish housecat at an old county home.\n\nVideology, 308 Bedford Ave., Williamsburg; 8:30 p.m.; Free\n\nReturn to Nuke ‘Em High Vol. 1\n\nThe Tromaville nuclear power plant has been demolished to make room for Tromorganic Food Stuffs Inc… and at President Lemmy’s request (yes, that Lemmy is president) Taco Tuesday must be a hit. Oh, and in true Troma style, it’ll be a hit all right.\n\nVillage East Cinema, 189 Second Ave., East Village; $14\n\nIn Bloom\n\nSet in Georgia in the early ‘90s, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Eka and Natia, two very close friends, enter adulthood and come face-to-face with antiquated customs in a male-dominated society they feel is unfit for them.\n\nVillage East Cinema, 189 Second Ave., East Village; $14\n\nFRIDAY-SATURDAY\n\nEraserhead\n\nThe first full-length feature from David Lynch tells the tale of Harry Spencer (Jack Nance) and his deformed/mutilated child. Set in an odd industrial landscape, Spencer experiences dream-like visions and what may, or may not be, nightmarish hallucinations.\n\nSunshine Cinema, 143 E Houston St, Lower East Side; Midnight; $10\n\nSATURDAY\n\nBack to the Future\n\nMichael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the dynamic duo of Marty McFly and mad scientist, Dr. Brown. 1985 just didn’t seem right so Dr. Brown builds a time machine out of a DeLorean and sends Marty on a trip through time. The only problem is that anything Marty does or changes in the past changes the future. What happens when Marty meets his mom before he was even born? We’re going to guess you already know… but why not see it again? And let’s not forget when Marty introduces 1955 to rock n’ roll with a version of “Johnny B. Goode” at Hill Valley High.\n\nVideology, 308 Bedford Ave., Williamsburg; 8:30 p.m.; Free\n\nEvangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo\n\nThe third of a four-film animated series called Rebuild of Evangelion, a remake of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Fourteen years have passed since the Third Impact and Misato has awakened, un-aged, to form a new group in a fight that is far from over.\n\nVillage East Cinema, 189 Second Ave., East Village; 2 p.m.; $14\n\nHard Rock Zombies\n\nA hard rock band’s got a show in the town of Grand Guignol, a town infested with werewolves, perverts, murderous dwarves and Hitler. The lead singer falls in love with a local girl named Cassie, but is murdered with the rest of the band when a bunch of insane Nazis decide to do a number on them. But Cassie raises the band from the dead… you see where this is going, right?\n\nSpectacle Theater, 124 S. 3rd St, Williamsburg; Midnight; $5\n\nSATURDAY-SUNDAY\n\nDon’t Look Back (Nitehawk Brunch Screenings)\n\nD.A. Pennebaker’s documentary follows Bob Dylan on his 1965 tour of England, when he was shifting from acoustic to electric. Pennebaker follows him from the airport to the hotel to the concert to hanging out with friends.\n\nNitehawk Cinema, 136 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg;\n\nSUNDAY\n\nThe Golden Globes\n\nVideology presents The Golden Globes live on their big screen, featuring a red carpet of their own, Golden Globe trivia, prizes, drink specials and nomination voting ballots.
