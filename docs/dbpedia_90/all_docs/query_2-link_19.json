If you’re in either of those categories, consider yourself appreciated; if not, feel free to look and see who is. Before there were “social networks,” there were social networks. Also after. So if I ever agreed or argued with you at Why Music Sucks, Radio On, ilxor .com, or Singles Jukebox; or ever worked with you at the Village Voice or Billboard; or ever spent every noon cst Tuesday for years on a Rhapsody conference call with you, we should probably go out for a beer sometime. Editors who first printed these pieces (and frequently improved them) include but are by no means limited to Milo Miles at the Boston Phoenix; Jim Walsh at City Pages; Rob Kenner at Complex; Dave DiMartino, Bill Holdship, and John Kordosh at Creem; Greg Boyd and Bill Reynolds at Eye Weekly; Chris Chang at Film Comment; Siobhan O’Connor at good; Alastair Sutherland at Graffiti; Maura Johnston at Idolator; John Payne at L.A. Weekly; Jessica Suarez at mtv Hive; Phil Dellio (who also mailed me a Matchbox 20 photo I used in here somewhere, and whose own recent collection Interrupting My Train of Thought belongs on your reading list as well) at Radio On; Keith Moerer at Request; Garrett Kamps, Sam Chennault, Rob Harvilla, and Stephanie Benson at Rhapsody; Nick Catucci at rollingstone.com; William Swygart at Singles Jukebox; Sue Rollinger at the Spectrum; Simon Reynolds, Charles Aaron, and Chris Weingarten at Spin; Will Fulford-­Jones at Time Out London; Doug Simmons and Harvilla at the Village Voice; and J. Edward Keyes and Jayson Greene at Wondering Sound (called eMusic at the time).

The headline “Past Expiry Hard Rock Dollar Bin” was partly swiped from the title of a recurring I Love Music thread initiated in 2009 by George Smith, who I probably borrowed a riff or two from as well. George, Gina Arnold, J. D. Considine, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Tom Ewing, Tim Finney, Joshua Kortbein, Glenn McDonald, David Cooper Moore, Ned Raggett, Mark Richardson, Philip Sherburne, Steve Smith, Jannon Sonja Stein, and Annie Zaleski, among others, provided valuable recollections on a Facebook thread I summarize herein about the origins of music writing on the Internet. Jody Rosen, who also knows more about turn-­of-­the-­20th-­century music than I do, gave “bro-­ country” its name. And it’s impossible to gauge how much my thinking and writing have been inspired over the years, and continue to be, by colleagues like Jacob Alrich, Kevin Bozelka, Dan Brockman, David Cantwell, Jon Caramanica, Robert Christgau, Matt Cibula, Leila Cobo, Anthony Easton, Justin Farrar, Michael Freedberg, Jeanne Fury, Keith Harris, Jewly Hight, Christian Hoard, Charles Hughes, Edd Hurt, Maura Johnston, Josh Langhoff, Greil Marcus, Michaelangelo Matos, Chris Molanphy, Daddy B.

And then there’s Lalena, whose husband I am, who deserves thanks for putting up with me and line-­editing all the chapter intros, and Annika, Cordelia, Sherman, and William, whose dad I am, who deserve thanks for keeping me halfway grounded and teaching me about jiu-­jitsu, terfs, graffiti, and yurts. And Ken Wissoker, Elizabeth Ault, and Danielle Szulczewski Houtz at Duke, who let me do this thing again and walked me through it, tolerating my obsessive-­compulsive logistical questions as if they weren’t the mark of a troubled mind. And finally, whoever buys, reads, or writes about this book. I’m so lucky y’all are out there. Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin. xii Acknowledgments\n\nIntroduction Sold a Decade at a Time When people meet me and find out what I do for a living, they inevitably ask me what kind of music I listen to and write about. I never know how to answer the question—never have—so usually I just kind of fumble and stutter a lot. If I told them how I really felt, they’d probably just think I was weird: namely, that pop music is bigger, more multidimensional, endlessly compelling in more directions, than they ever imagined. So it’s kinda hard to pin the stuff down. If it helps, though, when I used to moonlight as a bar dj late Saturday nights while living in New York City at the start of the 21st century, here’s how I advertised my genre leanings: “dj Edelweiss spins a danceable and drinkable ­all-­vinyl selection of proto-­Eurodisco bongo-­rock, German reggae, danceable prog, hair-­extension metal, Gregorian garage, boogie-­oogied country, stoner glam, industrial bubblegum, popping-­and-­locking Zulu wildstyle space-­cowboy hip hop bommi bop, and drunken frat-­soul with parties going on in the background. Plus zillions of ancient Top 40 songs you’d forgotten— until now.” Okay, maybe that doesn’t help so much. Still, here’s the thing: I see music history repeating itself, revolving again and again in strange, intriguing, disturbing, revealing, often hilarious ways. In the more than three decades during which I wrote the pieces in this book, popular music itself, music criticism, the music industry, communication media, and America have all changed immeasurably. So this book aims to plug into a whole bunch of those changes as they occurred, and somehow tie them together. Though it might look at first like an unnavigable dump, there is rather meticulous method to my madness—a logic, or several overlapping logics. There are trapdoors and secret passages connecting it all; if you want, you can make a game of it. Yet all the material comprises just a fraction of my music writing—or rather, another fraction, after the 100 or so pieces compiled in my\n\nprevious Duke collection, 2011’s Rock and Roll Always Forgets (which followed 1997’s The Accidental Evolution of Rock’n’Roll, which followed my 1991 heavy metal album guide Stairway to Hell, which I updated and expanded in 1998). So yes, I am milking my once-­prolific career as a rock critic for all it’s worth! There’s even a short piece I wrote for my high school newspaper, back in the ’70s. But though I was contributing a decade later to Rolling Stone and still do, I’ve included no pieces from that magazine, unless a Kanye West live review that only ran on their website counts. None of the hundreds of reviews I’ve written over the years for Entertainment Weekly or Blender or Billboard (where I worked as an editor) are in here, either. Even more than its predecessor, Terminated for Reasons of Taste includes plenty of writing I didn’t even get paid for—much of which first appeared in Xeroxed fanzines, on Internet discussion boards, on nebulous websites that came and went. Two full-­length “reviews”—of ’60s folk artist Niela Miller and a 2009 Bruce Springsteen album—are actually pieced together from extended off-­the-­cuff posts on the I Love Music board; for whatever reason, I think they captured more of my voice than most reviews that actually paid my bills. Occasionally, especially with selections from more amateur outlets like that one, I’ve since self-­edited pieces from their original rambling-­off-­the-­top-­of-­ my-­head state or folded adjacent posts together for reasons of clarity, coherency, and accuracy and to avoid redundancy and dumb typos; a few pieces have also been condensed somewhat, so as not to waste precious space, or reverted to pre-­editor-­remixed form when I was convinced they’d lost something in translation. I’ve also retooled certain headlines if the originals weren’t doing their job, or made no sense in retrospect. But throughout, I tried to select work that somehow holds up for me—believe me, a “worst of Chuck Eddy” compilation would be way thicker than this one. I started writing professionally, if you can call it that, in early 1984, and the book divides itself into five chronological sections, revolving around music from the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and—in the first one, facetiously titled “b.c.”—all of history Before I was a Critic. Under each of those umbrellas, I tried to organize pieces like a playlist or mixtape or good radio set, to transition logically into each other—to set each other up, answer each other’s questions, carry on an internal conversation or debate. So pieces on similar genres or by related artists or with intersecting themes or geography tend to be grouped together when feasible, with cusps between genres (rap-­rock, say) sometimes serving as mortar. This allows styles to evolve through the pages. For instance, I trace country music’s mutations from the ’20s all the way to the present, in 2 Introduction\n\npart via five batches of song reviews first published on the mostly hip-­hop-­ oriented website Complex in 2012. In another thread that keeps popping back up, you get to watch me fall in and out of and back in love with heavy metal. Even folk revivals, never my specialty, recur now and then throughout—from Niela Miller and Catholic folk masses all the way to Mumford and Sons. Other serial threads recur as well, including a few from Spin’s post-­print-­ era website: two pieces on country rap; three Sonic Taxonomy columns exploring essential albums in unexplored (and, in the case of “Fake New Wave,” maybe imaginary) genres; three titled with arrows (→ or ←) where I discuss a current artist alongside one from decades before. There are also two assemblages of real-­time single-­song reviews from the ’90s fanzine Radio On, sequeled in subsequent decades by similar collections from the Village Voice and the Singles Jukebox site. Some extramusical threads no doubt run through, too, and I’m not even sure I could name those myself. But I do plenty of explaining, in too much detail maybe, in all five section introductions. So I’ll terminate this now, and hope you find some of what follows to your taste.\n\nSold a Decade at a Time 3\n\n1\n\n.....\n\nB.C.\n\nT H I S S E C T I O N covers more or less a half-­century of music, which is\n\nobviously ridiculous. It’s also nothing: the Ronald L. Davis History of Music in American Life volume I’ve been wading through lately runs 1620 to 1865. And back in the early ’90s, Robert Christgau put together a “Prehistory of Rock ’n’ Roll” timeline for Details that started with courtly loving jongleurs of 1227, jumped to colonialist British explorers praising Gambian drum rhythms in 1623 and then to Viennese waltzers dancing as couples in 1815, and advanced forward from there. Interviewed by Michaelangelo Matos two centuries after those waltzes, Christgau explained that in teaching music history at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, he now reads “one of the oldest pieces of\n\nprose known to exist—4,500-­odd years old,” an order from “the boy-­king named King Pepi to ‘bring a pygmy dancer to the court.’ ” By comparison, my own B.C. begins almost yesterday: in 1930, with a slightly abridged version of one of several “50 Best Songs of Whatever Year” pieces that accompanied playlists I programmed for the streaming website Rhapsody in the past half-­ decade. I dip back into the 19th century here and there on subsequent pages, but only momentarily. So basically, here’s where I put my writing about music made before I wrote about music. Where subsequent sections increasingly go heavy on real-­time criticism, “B.C.” necessarily comprises pieces written almost entirely in hindsight, mostly in a recent era of so-­called Internet “listicles” that had websites trying to maximize page clicks and monetize eyeballs—which was also, as it happens, an era in which downloads and the so-­called cloud theoretically made all of recorded musical history available at will. So editors were increasingly open to critics writing about archival music, if frequently as bite-­size blurbs rather than at length. A disclaimer: I do not in any way consider myself a historian. The oldest baseball card I owned growing up was a 1949 Vernon Bickford on Bowman, so if some music I’m writing about seems like ancient history, you’re not alone. The further back I go, the more of a tenderfoot I am. And while I grow ever more fascinated tracing that backward path, I also realize I’m extremely selective about which route I take. You’ll find nothing here about Jenny Lind or John Philip Sousa, jubilee singers or parlor piano players, trilingual-­at-­the-­ same-­time late 1910s drum-­whistle-­rattle Dada power trios at Zurich’s Cabaret Voltaire or the tragic but titillating whore songs of 1920s Berlin literary cabaret. And though I touch at least a few times on the intriguing if unsavory legacy of 19th-­century minstrel shows, especially as they prefigure southern artists ultimately marketed as hillbilly music, anybody whose curiosity I spike should seriously consider seeking out the work of authors and academics whose expertise on the topic (and concurrent music from before the World Wars) puts mine to shame—a short list might include Amiri Baraka, David Cockrell, Ken Emerson, Karl Hagstrom Miller, Paul Oliver, Nick Tosches, Elijah Wald, David Wondrich, David A. Jasen and Gene Jones, and Yuval Taylor and Jack Austen, for starters. (Fill up your library card—I did!) I know I’m treading on potentially dangerous ground here. I’m a middle-­ aged white guy, and much of what I write about early country music takes into account race—always a lingering issue in a South that, 150 years down the line, still hasn’t gotten over losing the Civil War or let go of its collective amnesia 6 Chapter One\n\nabout slavery, the rollback of Reconstruction, the Ku Klux Klan, or Jim Crow. In 2009 I moved to Texas, where a year later the governor was still arguing for “states’ rights” and where you couldn’t miss the ominous Confederate flags along U.S. Route 290 long before Dylann Roof massacred nine black people in a historic South Carolina church. The Sambo and golliwog caricatures and dialect lampoons fostered by minstrelsy’s “Negro delineators,” nostalgia for antebellum plantation life, and razor-­toting “coon songs” of the 1890s are inextricable from centuries of racial oppression and violence that still make the front page. But paradox or not, remnants of those offensive ancient shticks lent verve and humor to more 20th-­century music than we’ll ever know—examples referenced in pages ahead barely skim the surface. There was, for instance, Jack Benny–­associated midcentury band leader and “The Thing”–­maker (among other things) Phil Harris, whose “singing style is basically a sort of rhythmic talk coated with the glib overtones of the circus barker,” explained the liner notes to 1958’s That’s What I Like About the South—so basically, he rapped— with “an obviously deep admiration for the work of the great Negro comedian Bert Williams, who, like Harris, talked his songs.” On 1974’s Stone Mountain Wobble, Ohio’s Hotmud Family were still passing off chestnuts like “Georgia Camp Meeting” and “Bully of the Town” as “country ragtime,” complete with a Mr. Bones stand-­in known as Mr. Spoons. Even four decades later, you could still go to a Civil War reenactment and observe outfits like the Second South Carolina String Band play Dan Emmett songs about “darkies,” and blackface Otellos were commonplace at opera houses well into the early 21st century. Less blatantly, lines could be drawn through the talking blues, Hoagy Carmichael, and Dean Martin’s 1955 Swingin’ Down Yonder all the way to Old Crow Medicine Show, Pokey LaFarge’s 2011 cover of Fiddlin’ Arthur Smith’s 1936 “Chittlin’ Cooking Time in Cheatham County,” or casually wistful references to fried chicken, watermelon, and the flood-­and-­race-­riot-­prone river juncture town “Cairo, Illinois” on 2015’s Something in the Water, and even today’s hick-­hopping “bro country.” Some aesthetics never go away. So while I don’t want to be insensitive to evils of the era that spawned the stereotyping, and while I acknowledge that exercising entitlement as a person of non-­color means I risk being complicit in the original sin, I also don’t want to deny that a willing misconstruction of African American culture helped give white artists—minstrels to string bands to rockabillies to Kid Rock— a freedom to let their music be loose, raunchy, funky, and funny in ways it clearly wouldn’t have been otherwise. No amount of deserved moral outrage B.C. 7\n\nis going to stop me getting off on it. Much of it remains reprehensible, but at very least you might benefit from knowing it’s out there. Anyway, that’s not all this section is about, and maybe some background is in order. I was born in 1960 in Detroit, and didn’t pay all that much attention to music for the first 18 or so years of my life. I was vaguely aware of Paul-­is-­ Dead clues on Beatles album covers because classmates talked about them, but the most I’ve ever written about the band since was five blurbs on Ringo solo songs for rollingstone.com in 2015. A guy named Jim Tierney, signing my senior yearbook, claimed I quoted Frank Zappa once, which is odd because I don’t remember listening to any Zappa albums until the late ’80s. I learned about the band Styx when some hilarious vandals painted “Welcome to the Grand Illusion” across the front of West Bloomfield High School once, and I’m pretty sure the closest thing I read to rock criticism at the time was when some other graffiti artist and perhaps fellow busboy scrawled a rant on a back kitchen wall at Maple House pancake restaurant about how rock was on the skids now because the New York Dolls were long gone and Kiss weren’t making good albums anymore and something else about Ted Nugent and Aerosmith. Yet more smart-­asses from school had a band called Luke Mucus and the Phlegm that I mainly remember as a talent show parody (other members: Runny Buttz, Lew Putrid, Yid McForeskin, Burrito, har har; songs about “fartin’ in a pool” and sniffin’ Sheila Young’s bicycle seat), and when they finally compiled their 1979–­’80 recordings and those of their more Romantics-­ commercial 1980–­’81 incarnation Luke Warm (local 45 “hit”: “Jesus Chrysler”) on two archival lps in 2013, I was amazed how much the Cracked / Creem / Ron Sweed / Alice Cooper / Dictators / B.T.O.-­riffs-­as-­faux-­punk sound and sensibilities prefigured (even shaped?) the Midwest-­suburban wisenheimer critical stance I not much later made public. Wouldn’t be surprised if those guys were as cynical about John Denver–­ loving “granolas” as I was, or at least pretended to be in the one ancient piece I’ve included that I actually wrote for West Bloomfield’s student newspaper. Or maybe I was just self-­consciously obsessed with taxonomical peer classification in general. I’m not quite sure where I would have categorized myself, clique-­wise, though I was geeky enough to be on the debate team both my freshman and senior years, taking sides on resolutions to overhaul the presidential election system and instigate national health care. One of my favorite books as a teenager was What Really Happened to the Class Of ’65? by David Wallechinsky and Michael Medved, the latter of whom went on to become a hardline Zionist right-­wing talk radio host. The Palisades High student in the 8 Chapter One\n\nbook I most identified with back then was Jamie Kelso, a brainy little neurotic who later resurfaced as a prominent white supremacist. Funny—neither seemed like a budding neo-­fascist at the time. Then again, neither did Ted Nugent. Long before he started palling around with Texas governors, and back before I became fluent in the lingo of genre, I assumed he and Bob Seger epitomized what my classmates meant when they talked about “hard rock”—a kind of music that I also assumed I didn’t like. But you never know with Detroiters. Seger seems fairly progressive politically these days (2014’s Ride Out included protesty global warming and gun control songs), but let’s just say Nugent plugs into a long tradition. As a little kid I collected toy vw Beetles, but assembly-­line mass production and the techno music it ultimately inspired aren’t all that Michigan and Germany have in common. Chip Berlet and Matthew Lyons’s Right-­Wing Populism in America names some names: Henry Ford, Father Coughlin, Charles Lindbergh, plus Joe McCarthy just one state west, where the John Birch Society now has its headquarters. The upper midwest is also where class-­resenting rock fans set disco records on fire in the late ’70s. Sometimes I even wonder how much the suspicion of elitist northeastern intellectuals certain skeptics detected in my early music criticism owed to my hailing from that neck of the Rust Belt. What I didn’t know until recently is that I had ancestors surnamed Steinberg on my dad’s mom’s mom’s side who came to Michigan around 1880 “from someplace near Posen,” which Germany had just taken control of nine years earlier but which belonged to Prussia before that and Poland later. August Steinberg “never revealed his background except to assert he was German, a devout Catholic, and a hard worker,” my great-­aunt Ethel Wooden wrote in the late ’70s, four decades after she’d started a vocational trade school for young women in Toledo. August’s son Frank sang mean ditties at family reunions about not having “one drop of Polish blood,” unlike lots of guys he worked with as a Grand Rapids mason; Frank’s artistically inclined son George designed camouflage during World War I then later got a job at a specialty shop in New York only by showing up with his blonde hair and proving he wasn’t Jewish. Eventually he changed his name to Stonehill, and when a heart attack killed him at 53 his wife trashed all his paintings. Also, according to Aunt Ethel, “one of the men could play the small accordion and all were expert with the polka.” Which seems relevant here, for some reason. So uh . . . where was I? Oh yeah, the ’70s. Halfway through, this section takes a crazy leap forward in time, barely touching on ’50s or ’60s music except for meager helpings of country and folk, completely ignoring mortality-­ B.C. 9\n\nminded late-’60s L.A. jug-­jig-­and-­jive raga-­hoedown tricksters Kaleidoscope even though they’re just about my favorite band ever right now, then diving whole hog into ’70s hard rock that’s been buried by history and hence provides excellent blind alleys to wander down. The tone of my writing maybe switches, too, since I’m perfectly comfortable making fun of white guys rocking hard, seeing how that’s demographically close enough to making fun of myself. From there, I get a bit old-­man-­yells-­at-­cloud about how modern-­day alt-­indie is no match for new wave back in the day (magnet on my refrigerator, dad to son, sorry: “It’s not that I’m old, your music really does suck!”), praise some darts that coked-­up record execs threw at the wall and missed while flush from profits of Frampton Comes Alive and Saturday Night Fever and Rumours, and sneak into the ’80s defending also-­rans who couldn’t decide if they wanted to wear skinny ties or not. Mainstream hard rock was endangered by then—or so some hoped. “Will the marginal fans of boogie and heavy metal decide they’re tired of all that calculated spontaneity and putative self-­expression? Will they turn from those big, thick cushions of loudness and decorative licks of musicianship?,” Robert Christgau wondered in late October 1977, in a long Village Voice essay about the future of a scene he was still calling “Avant-­Punk.” He picked the Stranglers, Dead Boys, and Eddie and the Hot Rods as good bets to make it with loud-­ guitar-­loving American teens, though none of them ever really did. The same special section had Richard Meltzer writing about his new joke-­punk combo Vom and predicting punk would soon “splinter off into Beatnik Rock and College Rock—rockers vs. the mods all over again!” Simon Frith, meanwhile, had just attended a “Music for Socialism” fest in London where all the folkies and avant-­gardists in the workshops dismissed punk as “the most reactionary fascist trend in popular culture today.” A few ads in the Voice section in question: Rick Derringer, Ram Jam, Karla Bonoff, E-­Z Wider rolling papers, Sam Ash, “Korvette Salutes the new wave of music on sire records.” So, yeah—’twas a long time ago. Though not as long ago as the times before that. But how about you step into Mr. Peabody’s wabac machine with me, and see where it takes us?\n\n10 Chapter One\n\nThe Best Songs of 1930\n\n..... Given that the stock market had crashed just two months before New Year’s, it’s maybe no surprise that so many of the most notable songs of 1930—or at least the ones that historians, collectors, collective memory, cinema, and the Anthology of American Folk Music have assisted toward the surface 84 years later—comment on the economy. What’s more surprising is how many of them find dark humor in it: old-­timey North Carolina banjo man Charlie Poole being booted by his landlord for lack of rent payment in “It’s Moving Day” (revived a mere half-­century ago by the Holy Modal Rounders); Gene Autry, still more hillbilly bluesman than Hollywood cowboy, sweeping motel floors in “Dust Pan Blues” just as the Dust Bowl was starting to rev up; string bands the Carolina Tar Heels (“Got the Farm Land Blues”) and Buster Carter and Preston Young (“A Lazy Farmer Boy”) counting corn crops wither away; mysterious proto-­blues-­style medicine-­show hokum songster Lil McClintock losing his bed and frying pan to a debt collector in “Furniture Man”; minstrel-­ throwback country ancestor Uncle Dave Macon watching banks collapse and the infrastructure pork barrel run dry in “Wreck of the Tennessee Gravy Train.” “Of all the times I’ve ever seen, we’re sure up against it now,” Uncle Dave rambles, but on some level, people seem to have been laughing about such misfortune. Cannon’s Jug Stompers in “Bring It with You When You Come” and Jimmie Rodgers, backed by Louis Armstrong’s trumpet and Lil Hardin Armstrong’s piano in “Blue Yodel No. 9,” played the parts of hobos and bums, Rodgers smarting off to a cop that his name could be found on his shirttail. In “High Water Everywhere,” Delta blues founder Charlie Patton was still reeling from a 1927 flood. And guess what? Every performer I’ve named so far came from below the Mason-­Dixon. Uncle Dave Macon had been fathered by a Confederate officer in Tennessee in 1870, five years after the war ended. In 1930, the year Congress established the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, other southerners both black and white sang about coping with Depression (and depression) via illegal substances: “Prohibition has killed more folks than Sherman ever seen,” since boozeless folks were turning to morphine and coke, warned solo Skillet Licker Clayton McMichen’s delirium-­tremens yodeler “Prohibition Blues”; in Memphis Jug Band’s “Cocaine Habit Blues,” Hattie Hart confirmed that she preferred white powder even over whiskey and gin. B.C. 11\n\nUp north and beyond, things were maybe more sophisticated, even optimistic, if not so reliable about it. Think of sons of Russian Jewish immigrants Ben Selvin (leading his orchestra through future FDR campaign song “Happy Days Are Here Again”) and Harry Richman (enraptured by snobs, swells, “lulubelles,” and “high browns” parading through Harlem in top hats and spats in Irving Berlin’s “Puttin’ On the Ritz”). Ruth Etting complained of taxi-­ dancing for dimes with “bowlegged tailors” and “rats from the harbors” in “Ten Cents a Dance.” But even that wasn’t nearly as decadent as Lotte Lenya back in Berlin as the Weimar waned, hunting down the next whiskey bar and little boy in Brecht-­Weill’s newly penned “Alabama Song.” In London’s East End right about then, 78-­year-­old (born 1852!) music hall dinosaur Charles Coborn was slurring about striking it rich in “The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo.” Lots of excellent songs by Johnsons that year: Mississippi Delta blues woman Louise Johnson’s piano-­pumped “All Night Long Blues,” with her alleged boyfriends Charlie Patton and Son House raising hell in the background, barrelhousing like its title promises; Jersey stride-­piano composer James P. Johnson’s post-­ragtime “You’ve Got to Be Modernistic”; Louisiana-­ to-­Missouri jazz / blues guitarist and clear Bob Dylan vocal inspiration Lonnie Johnson’s hilariously nihilistic “Got the Blues for Murder Only” (partly about people in Mexico eating rattlesnakes and drinking gunpowder!); Texas gospel/blues guitarist Blind Willie Johnson’s ferociously gruff and menacing (and much-­covered) biblical prophecy “John the Revelator,” which must rank as one of the greatest songs ever about an author (John the Apostle). Eleja Choir’s proto-­juju “Jubilee Anthem,” performed by an African Methodist choir in Nigeria; Evstratios Kalogeridou’s “Malevitziotikos Horos,” a fiddle-­dance jam from Crete; and King Nawahi’s steel-­guitared Hawaiian train rhythm blues “Honolulu Bound” all make perfect sense in the context of music coming out of Appalachia and America’s Deep South at the time. But “Fatal Flower Garden” by Nelstone’s Hawaiians is just some Alabama guys who’ve learned Hawaiian steel guitar, albeit performing (get this) an American adaptation of a tragic British traditional ballad about ritual child murder that dates back six centuries or so, and originally qualified as blood libel before the Jewish antagonist was changed to a gypsy lady. Welcome to Old Weird America. Tom Darby’s “Frankie Dean,” the Carter Family’s “John Hardy Was a Desperate Little Man,” and Texas cowhand Edward L. Crain’s “Bandit Cole Younger” meanwhile reported on more recent killings, bank robberies, and mishaps of a fugitive nature that begat legends 12 Chapter One\n\non American soil. In New York, D.C.-­born Duke Ellington and Georgia-­born Fletcher Henderson may have been getting ready to ring in swing, but the South was still knee-­deep in barn dances and hoedowns—old times. Not to mention hard times, obviously. But African American string band the Mississippi Sheiks were “Sitting on Top of the World” regardless, or at least their hit said so. And North Carolinans Hendley-­Whitter-­Small insisted “A Pretty Gal’s Love” was all they needed, because “I’d rather be happy than rich.” Wonder if they continued to feel that way, as the Great Depression dragged on. —rhapsody.com, 26 February 2014\n\nDepression Music\n\n..... When American Graffiti, revolving around a 1962 radio station’s “oldies weekend,” hit theaters in 1973, the pop hits of the ’50s—all newer then than the first Beastie Boys album is now—seemed ancient, as if dropped from some alternate universe. But over the past quarter-­century, as songs of the 20th century’s early decades have rematerialized first on vinyl reissues, and then on cd box sets, and have eventually become ubiquitous everywhere from movie soundtracks to Starbucks to mp3s available at split-­second notice, the music has managed to lose its remoteness. Somehow, technology has the effect of compressing time. So maybe it shouldn’t come as a shock that now, as we scarily slump our way into an economic downturn destined to put Carter/Reagan-­era stagflation to shame, music that came out around the Great Depression is feeling curiously current. In 1998, the venerable reissue label Yazoo Records compiled 46 songs of bank failure, credit collapse, rent inflation, joblessness, and panhandling, on a two-­volume set entitled Hard Times Come Again No More; five years later, the Sony/rca imprint Bluebird Jazz gathered up 24 such performances on a disc called Poor Man’s Heaven. When these collections were released, they didn’t receive much media attention, maybe partly because their themes still seemed distant. But since then, history has flipped—and now, it’s impossible to hear these old 78s without thinking about what you read in the business section this morning. What’s weirder still is that it’s hard to think of any new music released in recent years that you can say that about. The best 2008 examples might be mere coincidences of title, like Young Jeezy’s keep-­on-­grinding hip-­hop cycle B.C. 13\n\nThe Recession and Jamey Johnson’s druglife-­recovery country dirge “The High Cost of Living”; “Spend Spend Spend,” a miraculous and universally ignored ’08 track by Brit metal matrons Girlschool, comes closer (“Getting hard to borrow, pay the bills tomorrow”), but it’s technically about England. Shouldn’t working-­class hero Kid Rock have done something on Detroit’s autopocalypse by now? Especially when Poor Man’s Heaven opens with a monologue called “Eddie Cantor’s Tips on the Stock Market” where the old Borscht Belter jokes about everybody getting a bad break but his uncle, who died in September: “Poor fellow had diabetes at 45. That’s nothing, I had Chrysler at 110.” Ba-­dum bum. The Cantor routine is actually one of two Poor’s Man Heaven tracks that aren’t songs; the other, a lilting church sermon from Atlanta Baptist preacher and sometime gospel vocalist Rev. J. M. Gates, is called “President Roosevelt Is Everybody’s Friend”—but this year, when you hear Gates praise “our president,” FDR might not be the one who comes to mind. The rest of the compilation starts at surprisingly swingy vaudeville and Tin Pan Alley, then moves through rawer fiddle hoedowns, jug-­band hokum, calypso, and explicit agit-­ prop from folkies like Woody Guthrie. For the urbane stage-­musical selections toward the beginning, the most successful formula pits upbeat rhythms against downbeat melodies and sets them to darkly comic words about lost prosperity; that’s certainly what’s going on in Leo Reisman’s epochal rendition of “Brother Can You Spare a Dime?” and George Hall’s similarly themed “Remember My Forgotten Man”—the latter recorded for Gold Diggers of 1933 and seemingly referencing World War I vets demonstrating in D.C. in 1932. “Poor Man’s Heaven” itself, credited to country duo Bud Billings and Carson Robison, goes so far as to fantasize violent revolution: “We’ll own all the banks / And shoot all the cranks / And won’t give a durn who we hurt.” Later, a Texan named Joe Pullum does a high-­pitched piano blues about how Roosevelt’s Civil Works Administration helped him not need his woman anymore. The oldest song, and one of the most familiar, is hobo-­turned-­labor-­ organizer Harry “Mac” McClintock’s work-­spurning “Hallelujah, I’m a Bum,” a revamped public-­domain ditty published by the Wobblies in 1908 but revived as the title song of an Al Jolson movie in ’33. Unlike the frequently upper-­class-­slumming Poor Man’s Heaven, the often deliriously raucous “early American rural songs of hard times and hardship” on Yazoo’s Hard Times Come Again No More almost exclusively reside along an as-­yet-­undemarcated crossroads between impending blues and hillbilly music, occasionally reaching back to minstrel shows and Celtic ballads for 14 Chapter One\n\ninspiration. Certain specifics—boll weevils destroying crops, dust storms blowing Okies west, train-­hopping tramps killed on the rails, tenant farmers bleeding sharecroppers dry—are necessarily tied to their time; Jules Allen’s “Little Old Sod Shanty” and Edward L. Crain’s wonderfully titled “Starving to Death on a Government Claim” are both basically cowboy songs about whether homesteading on the open prairie is worth the considerable trouble. But “Wreck of the Tennessee Gravy Train” by Uncle Dave Macon and Sam McGee directly addresses a catastrophic 1930 bank failure, hardly an esoteric situation in this season of bankruptcies and bailouts. And the songs’ overriding preoccupations—middle classes losing their footing, loans and eventually meals getting tougher to come by—are as pertinent now as when the lyrics were written, or soon will be. Several titles actually contain the phrase “Hard Times”; it’s no wonder the late Studs Terkel gave that name to his indispensable 1970 oral history of the Depression. But here’s something just as interesting: a half-­century after the 1929 Wall Street crash, as an oil-­shock recession dragged the ’70s into the ’80s and hip-­hop was first mapping out its place in the world, Kurtis Blow did a “Hard Times” rap, then Run-­D.M.C. kicked off their first album covering it. Country neo-­traditionalist John Anderson opened his 1980 debut lp “Havin’ Hard Times” as well. So where are the hard-­times songs now? —www.GOOD.is, 2 May 2009\n\nCountry Rap Prehistory\n\n..... If you really explore the prehistory of country rap, you will wind up wandering down some unsettling abandoned corridors, leading back to a time long before not only rap, but even country, existed—a time when the racism in American popular music was anything but accidental. To get there, though, you’ll need to start with the talking blues—a rhythmic, rhyming, humorously yarn-­spinning talked vocal style you’ve heard if you’ve heard much early Bob Dylan, or Johnny Cash’s 1969 “A Boy Named Sue,” or C. W. McCall’s pop-­chart-­topping 1975 cb radio novelty “Convoy.” Talking blues were all over country, and frequently crossed over to pop, in the ’60s and ’70s: “Hot Rod Lincoln” for Johnny Bond in 1960 and Commander Cody in 1972; “Big Bad John” for Jimmy Dean in 1961; “Ringo” for Bonanza B.C. 15\n\nactor Lorne Greene in 1964; “My Uncle Used to Love Me but She Died”—as absurdist as anything by Beck—for Roger Miller in 1966. Ex-­Dylan sideman Charlie Daniels made a career of them, though he never sounded rappier than in his first charting single, the uncharacteristically left-­leaning “Uneasy Rider,” which went Top 10 pop in 1973 then seemingly went on to inspire the cadence that southern soul artist turned X-­rated proto-­rapper (and “Convoy” parodist) Blowfly flew with in his 1980 single “Blowfly’s Rapp.” Dylan may have nicked his own rap flow from mid-­’40s Woody Guthrie or early ’50s Arthur “Guitar Boogie” Smith, but talking blues officially date back to 1927, when mandolin-­wielding South Carolina car mechanic Chris Bouchillon was recording in Atlanta, and an a&r director found his singing skills lacking, so he suggested Bouchillon just talk the words instead. Countless “Talking Blues” imitators ensued: usually white (Coley Jones and “Talking” Billy Anderson were rare black exceptions) and generally “not really blues at all, except in name,” Nick Tosches argues in Where Dead Voices Gather, his 2001 book about the hugely influential second-­quarter-­of-­20th-­century blackface minstrel Emmett Miller (who I’ll return to). One of the style’s few blues-­based practitioners, Tosches says, was one Herschel Brown, who followed his own 1928 “New Talking Blues” (which, like Bouchillon’s, confusingly discussed not needing to work hard when one has “a gal in the white folks’ yard”) with two records that added a nasty N-­word to the title. Which might not be surprising, given where talking blues came from: the form had “likely been around, in songster tradition and on the minstrel circuit, longer than could ever be known,” Tosches writes. “Its age might be measured in centuries.” “The impulse to chant with a rhythmic background is probably as old as human culture,” Don Kent’s notes to the 1996 Yazoo Records compilation The Roots of Rap: Classic Recordings from the 1920’s and 30’s reiterate, citing church sermons and work songs as well as vaudeville and medicine shows as relevant in rap’s evolution. But minstrel is key: frequently fast-­talking country guitarist Jerry Reed’s funkiest hit, “Uptown Poker Club” from 1974, was actually a revival of black Bahamas-­born blackface superstar Bert Williams’s atypically razor-­toting 1914 “Darktown Poker Club”; Reed’s Top 10 pop 1971 country rap “When You’re Hot You’re Hot” concludes with offensive muttered asides about welfare checks and Cadillacs, just a year after Guy Drake hit the Hot 100 with a disturbingly stereotyped talking blues called “Welfare Cadillac.” Conversely, African American Memphis funk pioneer and Rabbit Foot Minstrels veteran Rufus Thomas’s #49 pop 1964 rap progenitor “Jump Back” revived rhymes that date back to white blackface originator Thomas “Daddy” Rice’s 1828 16 Chapter One\n\n“Jump Jim Crow,” the opening shot of the minstrel era. And in 1936, Emmett Miller dueted with Gene Cobb in “The Gypsy,” and the way they trade off lines sounds as much like rap music, proper, as nearly anything waxed before 1979. Even decades after America had swept minstrel’s burnt cork under the rug, aging hillbillies like Harmonica Frank and Cowboy Copas were making hay with talk-­rhyme routines that, consciously or not, clearly channeled rhythms and most likely shticks from the Great Depression, if not the 19th century. None of which is to suggest that country rap is inherently racist, just that navigating its origins is a daunting obstacle course. Black precedents are even more elusive, since most white ones were ostensibly mimicking black music in the first place, but maybe these qualify: ska toaster Prince Buster galloping into Dallas in 1964’s “Texas Hold-­Up”; Parliament yodeling and yelling through 1970’s “Little Ole Country Boy”; jazz-­funk bassist Bad Bascomb tossing square dance calls in 1972’s “Black Grass”; Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown bluesifying Jerry Reed’s raging-­Cajun smash “Amos Moses” in 1975; Isaac Hayes and Solomon Burke introducing their respective covers of “By the Time I Get to Phoenix” and “I Can’t Stop Loving You” with soul monologues—in fact, in years leading up to “Rapper’s Delight,” plenty of r&b artists (Shirley Brown, Millie Jackson, Swamp Dogg, Joe Tex, Bobby Womack) dabbled in both soul-­rapping and country, if usually not simultaneously. And those are only the names we know. Back in the ancient unrecorded crevices of time, there are country rappers—black and white—we never will. —spin.com, 30 April 2013\n\nCountry Songs I\n\n..... Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers: “White House Blues” (1926)\n\nCountry music just a few years into its record-­making existence, already fixated on the distant past: a string trio led by the banjo—African instrument, barely used anymore by African Americans—chronicles the news of exactly a quarter-­century before. Namely, a president’s assassination in 1901 by a second-­generation Prussian/Polish anarchist from Alpena, Michigan, and his replacement riding the train from Buffalo, where he took the oath of B.C. 17\n\noffice, to Washington: “Roosevelt’s in the White House, he’s doing his best / McKinley’s in the graveyard, he’s taking his rest.” Then, a threat from an ex–­ First Lady widow with a gun. Poole, in his middle 30s but just five years away from his own death, has what sounds to us like an old man’s voice, but he sings and plays with a young man’s energy—a hard liver, he’d mangled his banjo-­playing hand in a drunken baseball accident. His music is “old-­timey” in the sense of “that’s the way we always done it around these parts,” as David Wondrich put it (in his 2003 book Stomp and Swerve: American Music Gets Hot 1843–1924) about 1870-­born banjo banger Uncle Dave Macon, who had started recording just two years before. Poole’s sound could actually charge more furiously elsewhere, but “White House Blues” is the song that Tom T. Hall harked back to in 1973 on a non-­lp B-­side called “Watergate Blues”; the song John Mellencamp, pissed off about hanging-­chad recounts in Florida, recast as “To Washington” in 2004. Emmett Miller and His Georgia Crackers: “Lovesick Blues” (1928)\n\nA throwback blackface minstrel backed by jazz musicians—including Tommy Dorsey on trombone and Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto sax—starts out with a comedy dialogue, offensively parodying dialect Uncle Remus–­style: “Birds singin’ in de trees and de sun am shinin’, you shouldn’t have no blues.” “I know I shouldn’t have ’em, but, but . . . I got it. Every known indication of bein’ in that condition.” “What’s the matter, did they lock up your bootlegger?” Nope, Emmett explains, it’s his girl—she “done caught air.” Then, to some loud but teary-­eyed brass chords, he starts singing, showing generations of later country singers how it’s done, many of whom mimicked his over-­ the-­top phrasing outright: Jimmie Rodgers; Hank Williams, who theoretically made this song his own in 1940; Bob Wills; Jerry Lee Lewis, who covered it in 1958; Merle Haggard, who paid tribute to Miller on 1973’s I Love Dixie Blues. The secret is in the impossibly crazed and stretched-­out—often “yodeled,” but not the way sheepherders in the Alps yodeled—hangdog high notes, probably not what the Russian-­born Jewish American Irving Mills had in mind when he’d copyrighted the words back in 1922: “I’m in love, ah—hiiiime—in love,” “I got a feeling for the blue—whooo—ooz,” “She calls me sweet da-­aa-­aa-­ dee.” Other notes get lowdown—the “refuse” in “I tried and I tried but she just refuse,” an “Oh Lawd” that all but altered the earth’s axis. And this wasn’t even Miller’s most audacious vocal: check out the insane, almost klezmer-­like 18 Chapter One\n\nAllen Brothers: The Chattanooga Boys (Old Timey, 1973)\n\nprohibition speakeasy tongues of “Anytime,” recorded two months later. Or maybe 1936’s “The Gypsy”—a full-­fledged rap record, 43 years before “Rapper’s Delight.” Allen Brothers: “Maybe Next Week Sometime” (1929)\n\nTwo Chattanooga siblings—Lee on guitar, Austin on banjo, both on vocals— spin wobbly yarns around the pickle barrel, sounding simultaneously lazy, melancholy, comical, maybe even drunk (though not nearly as drunk as they sounded in 1934’s “Drunk and Nutty Blues,” which largely consisted of them laughing and crying hysterically). Also, at least to other white folks of the time, they sounded black—so much so that they once sued their record label for releasing one of their singles as part of its “race” series. Here, though, they might well have assisted that perception, and not just by echoing jug bands: “Y’know, I was goin’ down the street with lowdown blues. Shineboy said look heah nigga, let me shine up them shoes.” That ugly word returns later, too, tossed off in a disturbingly casual way; country music hasn’t learned yet to even try to hide its roots in 19th-­century minstrel shows. Anyway, the Allens decline the shoeshine offer for today, leaving the following week’s engagement B.C. 19\n\ncalendar open—same thing they do later in the song to the looney Birmingham gal who pulls down the shades, the ghost chasing them who suggests they stop to rest, the buddy they’re throwing a “spree” with who requests another drink, and the horny gal in the parlor who turns down the lights: “Ya husband might come home, I’m scared.” Strings provide rhythmic accompaniment for the recitation throughout; between some verses, Lee’s high flatulent kazoo serves the yodel role. Roy Newman and His Boys: “Sadie Green (Vamp of New Orleans)” (1935)\n\nWhen Texans first started western swinging, they were really more western Dixielanding, truth be told. (In 1935, swing had only just begun.) And this Dallas ensemble, numbering up to 10 members revolving around trumpet / guitars / fiddle / standup bass / drums, was certainly on the pre-­swing end of the spectrum. Their most high-­profile vinyl reissue is on a record label called Original Jazz, and the rhythm here—starting with a generous instrumental lead-­in—could almost pass as a smoking Charleston. The words concern a popular young woman named Sadie, who’s “got more beaus than the Navy’s got Marines,” and “big brown eyes and teeth [!?] to match,” and (look out) “when she starts to love, oh gosh / All over my Mackintosh.” Or maybe (as some clearer enunciators than Roy Newman have covered it) “Mama burn my Mackintosh,” but still—how did these guys know about Apple computer sex way back in the ’30s? Unless Roy’s Mackintosh was a British raincoat, and Sadie peep-­show entertainment. Either way, what’s certain is that a group called the Five Harmaniacs had recorded the same title way back in 1926, and the all-­black Memphis Jug Band had done the related “Everybody’s Talking about Sadie Green” in 1930: “Everything about her is tight like that,” “wears her dresses above her knees, lets folks say what they please,” “uses powder, uses paint, it makes her look like what she ain’t,” “lets you ride her . . . in her car.” Must have been quite some lady. Milton Brown and His Brownies: “Texas Hambone Blues” (1936)\n\nAn ex–­cigar salesman from Fort Worth lets his western swing band stomp and swerve: the fiddler, pianist, and guitar player all take hot solos; the latter, Bob Dunn, was electric and amplified before anybody else in his vocation. Who 20 Chapter One\n\nknew an instrument from Hawaii could change the world? Meanwhile, Milton Brown gets dirty. “I’m goin’ down to Cowtown, to get my hambone boiled / ’Cause the New York women done made my hambone spoiled.” (You’ve heard of Cowtown, right? Big balls there, western swingsters always claimed. ac/dc would understand.) He’s got groupies in Houston and San Antone, too (hoes in many area codes!), and a “Dallas gal make a good man leave his home,” not to mention—you figure it out—“a black-­headed gal make a tadpole hug a whale.” At the time, this team was not only better, but also more popular, than the one led by Brown’s former fiddle bandmate Bob Wills. But their reign would end later that year, when Brown was killed in a car crash at 32—possibly asleep at the wheel, legend has it, and with a teenage girl in the passenger seat. Smokey Wood and the Modern Mountaineers: “Everybody’s Truckin’” (1937)\n\nThe Modern Mountaineers were, just maybe, America’s first adolescent punk band. No better way to put it: 17- and 18-­year-­old white boys, big Fats Waller and Count Basie fans, and at least as big marijuana fans—or at least Arkansas-­ born / Oklahoma-­raised pianist Smokey Wood was; according to liner notes of the 1982 reissue The Houston Hipster: Western Swing 1937, he used to raise 20-­ plus stalks between signboards near Houston’s Main Street. Also, they played like adolescent punks: sax and clarinet fart-­honking fully down into the dirt, Smokey and southpaw guitarist Lefty Grove yelling choruses way too loud when the boogie-­woogie piano kicks in. Sensitive souls averse to racist horseshit might want to cover their ears now: “Down in Harlem on the street! You can hear them dancin’ feet! See them darkies everywhere they go! You can hear ’em singin’ hidey-­hidey-­ho!” So yeah, they apparently knew their Cab Calloway too; he’d put out “Minnie the Moocher” in 1931, and another, maybe even higher-­temperature, Modern Mountaineers track, “Keep On Truckin’,” is an homage to gongs being kicked around. And, oh wait, left out the most punk-­ rock part: Everybody’s not just “singin’ and truckin’.” They’re also “swingin’ and fuckin’.” Repeatedly. Moon Mullican: “Pipeline Blues” (1940)\n\nSort of the white rural equivalent of Louis Jordan–­era jump blues, hillbilly boogie was the missing link between western swing and rockabilly. HistoriB.C. 21\n\nMoon Mullican: Sings His All-­Time Hits (King, 1958)\n\nans usually peg 1940 as the year it started, thanks to a record called “Boogie Woogie” by Johnny Barfield, but Moon Mullican was boogie’s main hillbilly, and 1940 was also the year he initially laid down “Pipeline Blues.” He’d record the song again and again well into the ’50s—eventually shaking it up more and more, like Jerry Lee Lewis, who his ivory pounding laid the groundwork for, but also eventually watering down its lyrics. For instance, early on, he’d sing, “I’m an old pipeliner, and I lay my pipe all day / I got four, five women waitin’ to draw my pay,” which sounds a whole lot raunchier than his later “four, five young’uns.” Also, “the meanest gal in town” reforms, in later years, to “the sweetest gal in town.” Didn’t really work, though—by the ’50s, he looked too old for rock’n’roll’s new teenyboppers to care, and to this day, YouTube commenters know what his manual labor was really about: “It’s true: wine dine pipeline,” observes one. Dude was pimpin’, either way. (Also worth hearing: the 1983 cover by usually chaste family bluegrass/gospel group the Whites, sung atypically by patriarch Buck: “Every time I see you, you’re always on the street / You hang around the corner just like a policeman on the beat.” But Buck still swears he’d walk 130 miles—“Dallas clear into Wichita Falls, Texas”—to see her.)\n\n22 Chapter One\n\nBob Wills and His Texas Playboys: “I’m a Ding Dong Daddy” (1946)\n\nThe Texas Playboys were the Beatles of western swing, and Bob Wills was the Bob Marley maybe, in the sense of towering—in terms of sheer historical visibility—over his musical genre. Thing is, compared to lots of western swingsters, if not necessarily compared to nostalgists from Asleep at the Wheel to George Strait to Hot Club of Cowtown who’ve attempted to revive the sound since, there was something too doggone polite about the Playboys. In his 2003 book Southwest Shuffle: Pioneers of Honky-­Tonk, Western Swing, and Country Jazz, Rich Kienzle even dismisses them as “a mediocre band led by an ex–­ Light Crust Doughboy.” Maybe it’s just the price of superstardom—when you’re the record company’s meal ticket, you might have to rein your sound in now and then, if not always. But these guys had a smart way to circumvent that. Wills had been making records for well over a decade when, in 1946 and 1947—­fortunately, right around the time Lester Barnard started letting his electric guitar distort—the band recorded 370 “Tiffany Transcription” tracks onto noncommercial 16-­inch discs for play on a syndicated radio show. These recordings let them get loose in ways that Vocalion/OKeh, mgm, Columbia, and the like wouldn’t. Rhino Records finally issued several collections of them in the ’80s; volume 3, called Basin Street Blues, focused on the Playboys’ “swing, blues, and jazz side,” and is probably the best for it. My pick-­hit from that disc, “I’m a Ding Dong Daddy,” done 16 years after Louis Armstrong did it, bounces all over the dancefloor, with new recruit Roy Honeycut (“that’s that boy, his name is Roy”) taking a sweet steel guitar solo, and Tommy Duncan sounding both slurred and assured on top, boasting about being a “wild Poppa from polecat holler, I don’t wanna get rough,” threatening to shoot some little dame down with his Thompson gun nonetheless, and granting y’all permission to shake it and break it and hang it on the wall—just like Delta blues founder Charley Patton had done in his catchiest song, from 1929. Delmore Brothers: “Freight Train Boogie” (1946)\n\nRespectable tenant farmers’ sons from Alabama, their close family harmonies once reverently rooted in gospel and Appalachian folk music, learn to rock’n’roll—a decade too early, but don’t hold that against them. By 1946, the Delmores had accrued a full band: bass, mandolin, steel guitar, fiddle, guiB.C. 23\n\ntars. Electric guitar and drums wouldn’t be added until a year later, apparently, but they already had the beat down. And that beat sounded like valve gears, high whistles, smokestack lightning: on the 1975 vinyl Gusto set Best of the Delmore Brothers, emphasizing their boogie period, three songs out of 10 are train songs—“Pan American Boogie,” “Tennessee Choo Choo,” and this one, which is the most propulsive, jazzy breakdown and blues harmonica tooting from Wayne Raney on down. Arthur “Guitar Boogie” Smith: “Who Shot Willie” (1951)\n\nEight years before George Jones’s wild rockabilly side “Who Shot Sam,” a comparably cooking wise-­ass murder mystery that’s no mystery at all: pretty Maxine’s groom gets shot on their wedding day, and Smith knows the culprit but he’s pleading the Fifth: “Who could it be? I ain’t gonna tell ’cause they’d hang me.” “I’m a country boy,” he admits, “but I know this much—to keep my eyes wide open and my big mouth shut.” Smith came up playing Dixieland jazz and got his nickname from an early hit; he also allegedly (1) composed “Dueling Banjos”; (2) hosted the first nationally syndicated country music radio show; and (3) ran the North Carolina recording studio where James Brown recorded “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag.” And judging from his vocal cadences and sense of humor in early ’50s ditties like “Just Lookin’” and “Don’t Look for Trouble,” he probably taught Bob Dylan a thing or two, too. Harmonica Frank Floyd: “Rockin’ Chair Daddy” (1954)\n\nBorn in Mississippi in 1908 and showing off his two-­harmonicas-­at-­a-­time (one with his nose!) and singing-­while-­playing-­harmonica-­out-­the-­corner-­ of-­mouth tricks in carnivals and medicine shows for decades thereafter (only competition, maybe: Peg Leg Sam Jackson, who seems to have kept alive a similar vaudeville-­minstrel shtick), traveling hobo Harmonica Frank Floyd didn’t record until well into his 40s. But once he did, holy shit: there was “Swamp Root,” a slobber-­scatted talking blues where you’d best get out of saliva range every time a word starts with b or p (most dangerous, appropriately: “PPPimm-­PPPle”); there was “The Great Medical Menagerist,” an American historical tent-­show tall tale about concoctions that grow hair on doorknobs, among other miracles; decades later there was “Shampoo,” dang 24 Chapter One\n\nnear obscene enough to make Blowfly blush. And there was the slavering, deranged, distorted, and frequently incomprehensible proto-­rockabilly single “Rockin’ Chair Daddy,” which feels downright primitive, and just as mean— the most outrageously nasal white-­man falsettos and asides since Emmett Miller (“awwww shucks—boot it now!”), subversive boasts about being an unschooled fool, lines half-­recalled from old Jimmie Rodgers records (“Told her my name was on the tail of my shirt / Rockin’ chair daddy don’t have to work”), all amid noise that’s an uncanny forecast of Captain Beefheart. If that ain’t country, he’ll kiss your bbbig bbbullfrog. —Complex, 5 June 2012\n\nNiela Miller: Songs of Leaving\n\n..... Got sent this vinyl lp two days ago called Songs of Leaving on a Chicago label called Numerophon by this girl folk singer named Niela Miller, recorded in 1962 in nyc—or, really, by 2009 (even 1981, if not 1962) standards more like a vinyl ep, since it seems to clock in around 20 minutes for about 10 songs. The thing is on 150-­gram vinyl, really thick and heavy; label looks like it would have been plastered on some old 78. Record cover cardboard is also super-­ thick, made to look like some Folkways album from the ’50s. Clever (and actually quite beautiful) marketing concept, I gotta admit—maybe even smart, on an extremely small scale, since the idea I guess is to make physical product collectible in the age of mp3s. (Apparently this album is the first of a series on the label. Though I have no idea what it would cost to put out a record that looks like this one in 2009, with vinyl pressing plants supposedly shutting down and all. Also, though the thing looks real classy on one hand, it’s also obviously kind of ridiculous, which may or may not be part of the point.) Thing is, there’s also music on the thing, and it’s just . . . okay. Niela sings her (apparently mostly if not all original) blues-­folk in a tone that strikes me as really proper and cautious, maybe a precursor of Joan Baez–­type singing (maybe proto–­Janis Ian too?)—basically, it’s how you’d expect those ironed-­ haired private-­girls-­school rich chicks in Animal House (also set in 1962) to sing. Played it back-­to-­back this morning with a couple of New Christy Minstrels lps from around the same period, and Miller sounded completely strained and constrained and unenergetic and humorless in comparison (and B.C. 25\n\nNiela Miller: Songs of Leaving (Numerophon, 2009)\n\nthe New Christy Minstrels didn’t seem as good as the Kingston Trio or Limeliters, all of whom I’m guessing Miller’s milieu would have dismissed as phonies and sellouts). Still, I like the record okay—especially “Goodbye New York,” which has a tune and some bite to it plus a lyric I identify with right now, as my apartment fills up with boxes packed for my move. And (apparently the main justification for the reissue), there’s also this song called “Baby Don’t Go to Town” which the (Folkways-­like) liner notes peg as a prototype of “Hey Joe”—or, at least the song that was allegedly combined with Carl Smith’s 1953 country hit “Hey Joe” to get the song that Hendrix and the Byrds and Leaves and Deep Purple and Cher later did. (Aside: Back at University of Missouri in the early ’80s, I knew a guy—otherwise a major fan of the Jam—who collected on cassette tapes all the versions of “Hey Joe” he could get ahold of.) Supposedly Niela Miller’s “unstable boyfriend” Billy Roberts stole her version and had it copyrighted, and the rest is history. I’m skeptical about all of this, but it’s a good story, either way. And there is a certain proto-­garage-­punk (post-­blues) punch to the guitars in Miller’s song. Or at least I imagine there is, so I can keep her cool-­looking record. Then again, probably the proto-­garage part of how “Baby Don’t Go to Town” sounds is just its guitar progression. And the liner notes zero in on 26 Chapter One\n\nAmaj (not that I’d know). And Niela might be as proto-­“freak-­folk” (or proto–­ the tuneless kind of ’60s folkies that freak-­folkers gravitate toward now) as proto-­Baez. And by “Miller’s milieu,” I guess I basically mean Dylan’s—she supposedly attended his West Village debut. But her backstory doesn’t make her sound “authentic” at all: learned about folk music at summer camp in the Catskills while on vacation from the High School of Music and Art in ’48, became the promoter of folk music at “liberal Antioch College” in ’52, dated a “black, Jewish and Communist folk singer,” wrote “Too Long Blues” after an early boyfriend snubbed her for another gal at a Weavers gig in ’53. I swear, the whole plot reads like a parody to me. I half expect the Beastie Boys to come out and start rapping about beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks. But though I never thought of the folk revival this way before, it also all means that she was learning about the blues around the same time that all the (white) early rock’n’rollers were. Which is kind of cool, even if she wasn’t nearly as good at it (and even if ignoring rock’n’roll then makes her a total geek). Also makes me wonder how much audience crossover there was between early ’60s rock’n’roll and early ’60s folk—there must have been frat bros who bought both Beach Boys and Kingston Trio lps at least, right? Both groups even kinda dressed alike! —I Love Music, 8 February 2009\n\n’60s Catholic Folk Mass\n\n..... To Catholics and lapsed Catholics of a certain age, it might seem like a dream: for a few years starting in the mid-­’60s, maybe while a formal high mass was being celebrated upstairs, church basements filled with fabric fish cutouts and folding chairs provided a habitat for clean-­cut college beatniks—and even pretty young nuns wearing casual clothes!—to strum songs like the Youngbloods’ “Get Together” on acoustic guitars, perhaps with bongo accompaniment. Overnight, a solemn medieval ritual, unchanged for centuries, made way for a hootenanny. Ken Canedo, in his slim 2009 history Keep the Fire Burning, analyzes the “folk mass” as the upshot of a few concurrent events: Pope Paul VI’s late 1963 Second Vatican Council encouragement of vernacular non-­Latin liturgical language; young Catholics’ growing focus on social justice in the wake of JFK’s B.C. 27\n\nassassination; those same young people’s growing Kingston Trio and Joan Baez collections; and the predicament that, when English-­language Catholic hymns were suddenly allowed, not many existed. Which led to the use of certain secular pop hits, and old spirituals like “Kumbaya” and “Michael Row the Boat Ashore” resurrected during the ’50s folk revival, but more importantly led to a cottage industry of original songs—an industry directly anticipating the largely Protestant genre of Contemporary Christian Music. In fact, Ray Repp—whose 1966 Mass for Young Americans, generally considered the first folk mass recording, predated the ’70s Jesus Movement by half a decade—is proclaimed “the earliest of all [ccm] pioneers” in Mark Allan Powell’s encyclopedia of the genre (which Canedo quotes). Paul Quinlan, the Dameans, Joe Wise, John Fischer were prolific composers in their own right, and familiar songs from the Byrds’ “Turn! Turn! Turn!” to “Day by Day” from Godspell snuck into church through the early ’70s, when bishops reined the rebels in. —rhapsody.com, 13 August 2013\n\nCountry Songs II\n\n..... Cowboy Copas: “Alabam” (1960)\n\nA living fossil in the age of rock’n’roll, Cowboy Copas had a career that dated back to ’20s string bands, then had a Top 5 country hit in 1946. “Alabam,” which topped the country chart and got to #63 pop in Billboard when he was 47, partook in a rhythm unmistakably echoing those bygone eras. And it wasn’t even the last of its kind—Guy Drake (1970’s race-­baiting “Welfare Cadillac”), Jerry Reed, obese Hee Haw sideshow Junior Samples, and “Convoy” trucker-­rapper C. W. McCall all made music at times harking back, somehow, to the white talking country blues of the Great Depression, long after most anybody remembered what was being harked back to. “Alabam” itself consists primarily of warmly recited couplets that, for all we know, could’ve survived on stages or in barn dances since Reconstruction days—about people down the street eating like wild geese, tramps in the cornfield, Sal with worn-­down shoes tied onto her feet. Who knows anymore whether it was heard as a novelty, 28 Chapter One\n\nDick Curless: Tombstone Every Mile (Capitol, 1972)\n\nor whether its sound had simply retained backwoods currency over the decades? Not Cowboy Copas, that’s for sure—he died three years later, in the same plane that killed Patsy Cline. Dick Curless: “Tombstone Every Mile” (1965)\n\nFrom a strong silent type who looks as robust as the men he sings about, brass-­ knuckled and burly-­baritoned Country & Northern about truckers navigating an ice-­ribbon stretch of highway in Maine (“Route 2A between Houlton and Macwahoc,” say John Morthland’s liner notes to 1998’s The Drag ’Em off the Interstate Sock It to ’Em Hits of Dick Curless)—about as masculine as music ever gets, with momentum like an 18-­wheeler sliding down the mountainside. Curless, born on Maine’s Canadian border himself in 1932, has an eyepatch over his right eye, and sounds like it. “You’ve got it made if you’re hauling goods any place on earth but those Hainesville Woods”—so the mile-­spaced gravestones come from imagining how the landscape would look if all the truckers lost there had been buried there. A #5 country hit, framed in sub-­ Arctic wind sounds that feel like specters.\n\nB.C. 29\n\nHank Thompson: “Smoky the Bar” (1968)\n\nWhiskey-­smooth, corny-­punned, buy-­another-­round two-­step relaxation honky-­tonk about, well, a smoky bar, from an amiable Texan who mined several decades worth of country hits (from a #2 in 1948 to a #32 in 1980) out of balancing the good times and bad times in drinking establishments after dark, and who managed to keep western swing and hillbilly boogie halfway viable years after their sell-­by date to boot. On the Smoky the Bar album, for instance, “Let’s Get Drunk and Be Somebody” beats Toby Keith to that title by several decades, and has a nifty alliterative part about “a gushing goblet goads my ghostly gloom”; “Drunkard’s Blues” updates “St. James Infirmary Blues” and sounds like a goth jazz dirge; “I See Them Everywhere” jokes about seeing pink elephants and other creatures crawling up walls; “Girl in the Night” considers a sad beauty who soaks in the nightlife every night to kill some past pain the singer hasn’t quite figured out (popular glam rock theme too); “New Records on the Jukebox” hopes somebody will play them because all the old ones choke Hank up too much. Most of the songs are tragic, but hardly any are slow, and most have a beat. Also, Hank’s voice sounds surprisingly gentle, somehow, even when he’s rowdy—a trick Toby Keith managed to pull off decades later, but not many others have. Thompson’s 1966 Six Pack to Go lp with the Brazos Valley Boys (“a program of their biggest beer-­drinkin’ hits!”) actually had two songs with “hangover” in the title—how often does that happen? Smoky the Bar notes cite “the gentleman scholars of Heidelberg [lifting] their steins,” and calls him “the Poet Laureate of beer drinkers.” So . . . thirsty yet? O. C. Smith: “The Son of Hickory Holler’s Tramp” (1968)\n\nMore r&b and less c&w than O. B. McClinton, more c&w and less r&b than O. V. Wright, Louisiana-­born O. C. Smith is one of scores of black singers to make country music in the past half-­century—if that sounds like a contradiction to you, please hunt down Warner Bros.’ 1998 From Where I Stand: The Black Experience in Country Music box set or Trikont Germany’s Dirty Laundry: The Soul of Black Country compilations from a few years later, and school thyself. Anyway, Smith’s biggest hit was 1968’s “Little Green Apples,” which went #2 pop and nowhere on the country chart, then somehow won the 1969\n\n30 Chapter One\n\nBest Country Song Grammy regardless—maybe because it was also covered by Roger Miller, and Glen Campbell dueting with Bobbie Gentry, but it’s hard not to suspect segregation at work. It’s a lovely tribute to middle-­class marital bliss either way, weirded only a little by Smith’s anachronistically minstrel-­like delivery of one line (“when myself is feelin’ low”). Smith did chart a country single earlier in 1968, though—at least if the Canadian country chart, where “The Son of Hickory Holler’s Tramp” got to #4, counts. Now, this is dark stuff: Smith recalls growing up with 13 siblings in a destitute cabin; his drunk dad goes deadbeat, so Mom does what she must to keep them fed. Every night, after they’re in bed, she turns on the red light. John Wesley Ryles: “Kay” (1968)\n\nA Nashville cab driver—or at least a Nashville-­via-­Texas-­via-­Louisiana singer-­ songwriter who plays one—spends a night cruising the streets. He misses the lady singer whose New York success he bankrolled, gives a local teen beauty queen a lift to the hospital so she can have her baby, listens to two Fort Campbell soldiers tell him how bad Vietnam’s going, hears junkyard dogs and police sirens then learns somebody got stabbed out there. At 3 a.m., a clock strikes, and all the night people look so sad. He doesn’t sound rural at all, and neither do his “latest sounds from Music City, U.S.A.,” as he puts it: guitar, horns, piano, violins-­not-­fiddles. But the song went Top 10 country anyway, then charted again a decade later. In 1968, John Wesley Ryles was 18 years old, and though he charted country with 30 songs in the next two decades—hitting the Top 20 as late as 1987—this one was tough to top. Tom T. Hall: “Homecoming” (1969)\n\nA songwriter with as journalistic an eye and pen as any in the past half-­century, Tom T. Hall earned blurbs from Jimmy Carter, Kurt Vonnegut, and bearded academics on the back of his definitive 1988 double-­best-­of The Essential Tom T. Hall. Give or take Creedence Clearwater Revival’s 1969 “Lodi”—or Hall’s own “Last Hard Town,” from five years later—it’s hard to think of a more matter-­of-­fact, less romanticized depiction of a being a journeyman musician than this one-­sided, talk-­sung conversation from a not-­entirely-­reliable nar-\n\nB.C. 31\n\nTom T. Hall: Homecoming (Mercury, 1970)\n\nrator’s compartmentalized life. Basically, a guilt-­ridden fellow shows up at his cattleman dad’s house after missing Mom’s funeral, and as far as we can tell he never gets past the foyer. Almost every line, we learn a new detail, and it just snowballs—he’s only fulfilling a routine family obligation, and it’s up to us whether his awkward excuses (never even knew Dad had a phone!) makes him a selfish narcissist or just a busy guy. Dad heard one of his songs on the radio— not exactly a hit, but the next one will be. He picked up a cheap and shiny ring in Mexico because “in the business that I’m in, the people call it putting up a front.” The road hasn’t helped his health—he’s lost weight, looks pale like he just left prison—but don’t worry, he does his work in “nightclubs,” not “beer joints,” and you can’t get hurt there. Then there’s that lady guitarist sleeping in the car, catching a nap after driving from Nashville to San Antone, since she needs to be alert en route to Cartersville tonight. (Women’s lib!) And so on—mundane small talk across worlds and generations, and Dad’s probably heard most of it before anyway, and real soon it’s time to hit the lonely road out of town again: “By the way, if you see Barbara Walker, tell her I said hello.”\n\n32 Chapter One\n\nAnne Murray: “Snowbird” (1970)\n\nLush, bittersweet, impossibly beautiful music about lost youth and birds migrating south for winter, from a Nova Scotia gym teacher paving the way, in a way, for fellow Canadian divas Shania Twain and k. d. lang. Basically, the music sounds like birds riding brisk air; Gene MacLellan, who wrote it and later, in 1995, committed suicide, came from the Maritimes himself. The beat is a sort of light oompah, the roots of Abba; Murray’s vocal influences were Rosemary Clooney and Brenda Lee, and on the debut U.S. lp this came from—actually a compilation of her first two Canadian albums—she also covered James Taylor, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Canadian Christian liberation theologian folk singer Bruce Cockburn, and the hippie folk-­mass standbys “Get Together” and “Put Your Hand in the Hand.” What all that has to do with country music is anybody’s guess, but who cares? This was a Top 10 country hit regardless, and Murray wound up scoring in the format well into the ’90s, topping the chart 10 times. Barbara Mandrell: “The Midnight Oil” (1973)\n\nNo two ways around it: this song—a #7 country hit at the time—is filthy. Barbara is called back into the office late at night to give the boss “a helping hand,” and tomorrow she’ll feel “kinda dirty ’cause I’ll have that midnight oil all over me”—yowza! Is her shower broke? And if Peter Garrett knew what the midnight oil was, would he have named his band that? Regardless, there’s something refreshing about a female singer falling back on the gotta-­work-­ late-­honey lie (see Isley Brothers, “Work to Do”). This is from early in Mandrell’s career, when she was just 24—four years or so before she really took over the charts, seven before nbc gave her a variety show. Her music wasn’t quite as r&b-­infused as it’d be later, though her 1977 Columbia Best Of already had her interpreting songs by Aretha Franklin, Joe Tex, and Texas boogie-­ man Roy Head. Listening now, you can tell why hip people thought of her covers as squaresville whitewashes; she definitely Pat Boones some of them. But she could be great, too, and she sure did love those cheating songs: side one starts with a great doomed end-­of-­the-­affair one called “Scarlet Water,” where they’re gonna “sip the scarlet water one more time.” Which water may well be midnight oil, too. B.C. 33\n\nStatler Brothers: “Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott” (1974)\n\nEvery year except one between 1972 and 1980, the Statler Brothers were named the cma Vocal Group of the Year—not bad for a crew named after a brand of tissues you blow your nose with. They’d come up during the ’60s folk revival, but to my ears, their harmonies frequently shook out somewhere between gospel jubilee and barbershop, maybe with occasional hints of doo-­wop. They switched voices line-­by-­line/pitch-­to-­pitch a lot, like doo-­woppers (and, later, old-­school rappers) did; the bassman voice often hits me as ridiculous, which is either intentional or a generational thing. What’s definitely a generational thing is that four out of 11 songs on their 1975 Mercury Best Of are list songs, all wondering or bemoaning lost days of yore—early baby-­boom/postwar/ mostly-­early-­’50s pop-­culture fads in “Do You Remember These” (not unlike Robert Klein’s 1973 comedy lp Child of the ’50s, especially since there’s nothing particularly rural about the Statlers’ memories); classmates who went on to do all sorts of things (including one who kills himself and one who winds up institutionalized—see also the 1976 book What Really Happened to the Class of ’65?) in “The Class of ’57”; a couple’s old photo-­album pictures (hence a precursor to Jamey Johnson’s 2008 country hit “In Color”) in “Pictures.” Most interesting, to me, is the lost-­Hollywood lament “Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott,” not so much for its appropriately nostalgia-­kitschy calliope/ukulele-­ish arrangement or even its low-­register-­verse/high-­register-­ chorus schematic as for the fact that I was apparently born too late to recognize almost any of its references beyond, say, Tex Ritter and Gene Autry. But Googling establishes that Johnny Mac Brown, Lash Larue, Smiley Burnette, Allan “Rocky” Lane (who later did Mr. Ed’s horse voice!), and Randolph Scott himself were pretty much all mid-­20th-­century screen cowboys. The Statlers don’t stop there, though—they want to be actual film critics, and they are funny about it! They joke about the ratings code, refer like the insiders they are to “the industry,” say you’ve got to take your analyst along to the movies nowadays. Presumably, they didn’t much appreciate M*A*S*H or Midnight Cowboy or Five Easy Pieces: “Everybody’s trying to make a comment about our doubts and fears / True Grit’s the only movie that I’ve understood in years.” To put this in context: 1974, when this went #22 country, was two years after the Kinks did “Celluloid Heroes,” one year after Elton John’s “Roy Rogers” and American Graffiti, the same year Happy Days went on the air, and six years before Ronald Reagan was elected president. Clearly, something was in the air. 34 Chapter One\n\nLoretta Lynn: “The Pill” (1975)\n\nLink to a clip of this song on Facebook in these war-­on-­women days of theocrats blocking Planned Parenthood funds, and everybody knows what you’re talking about—it’s been decades since “The Pill” sounded so current. When it came out, it was at least somewhat controversial—sat on the shelf for more than two years after being recorded in late 1972. And enough radio stations laid off that it charted lower than Lynn’s previous seven singles—including 1971’s epochal “One’s on the Way,” which its lyrics reference. But “The Pill” still got to #4 when, 37 years of supposed female advancement and empowerment later, it’s hard to imagine country radio touching the song. The birth-­control pill itself had been approved by the fda way back in the early ’60s and made Time’s cover in 1967; among other accomplishments, it led to wider employment for women. But in the song, Loretta’s main concerns are tossing out her maternity dress and enjoying sex more without risking a bigger brood—even if Hubbie apparently used to tomcat on the side when she was pregnant. A couple times, she audibly laughs in his face. Narvel Felts: “I Remember You” (1975)\n\nNarvel Felts, blessed with one of the widest vocal ranges of any country singer ever recorded, is said to have been discovered trying on “Blue Suede Shoes” at his high school talent show in Missouri in 1956; his first chart hit, in 1960, was a Drifters cover. After that, he got no chart action again until well into the ’70s, when he was in his mid-­30s. Guess you could classify him in the pop-­ operatically flamboyant fancy-­pants falsetto tradition of guys like Roy Orbison, Freddie Fender, and Gene Pitney. Maybe some mimicked Mexican mannerisms, too; and probably also some influence of Charlie Rich—whose singing could also work in flouncy Latinate filigree stuff. Plus, soul music: he hit with Jackie Wilson and Dobie Gray covers. Felts’s self-­titled album from 1975 had a few hits (I’ll take its “Funny How Time Slips Away” over Willie Nelson’s), but the most over-­the-­leftfield-­wall vocals on it are in a deep cut called “I Remember You,” where his singing shifts smoothly from low-­and-­manly to almost ridiculously glam-­twee: “I remember you-­hoo!” Seriously, the high parts could be Russell Mael in Sparks. Can’t think of any other country that does that. So: maybe it’s a Lou Christie or Frankie Valli thing? If you don’t hate it, you’ll love it. B.C. 35\n\nStoney Edwards: “Blackbird (Hold Your Head High)” (1975)\n\nA part–­African American, part–­Native American, part-­Irish hard country honky-­tonk singer at a time of soft countrypolitan crossover, Stoney Edwards was an anomaly in more ways than one—according to most sources he was born on Christmas Eve 1929, two months after Wall Street crashed, which puts him in his 40s by the time he made his first records in the early ’70s. He might not have even made any at all, if a carbon monoxide–­induced coma he’d incurred as a forklift operator hadn’t forced him to switch careers. “Blackbird (Hold Your Head High),” a song of fatherly advice about how to turn tables with a positive attitude, was probably his best song and almost definitely his most controversial, for these lines: “Me and you and cousin Jesse gonna ride the train / Just a couple of country niggas, stealin’ the rodeo, from Georgia on up to Bangor, Maine.” A caveat: Those words were written by a white man, Chip Taylor, of “Wild Thing” and “Angel of the Morning” fame. But Edwards—“arguably the only modern black country artist whose blackness did come through in his music,” according to John Morthland’s liner notes to the 1998 best-­of Poor Folks Stick Together—rasps them with untold sadness, then goes on to relate Dad’s words about seeing the good in people and not letting the scarecrows stare you down, even if you were born black and hungry on a little Carolina tobacco farm. It got to #41 on the country chart, but he never ascended that high again. Stella Parton: “Standard Lie Number One” (1977)\n\nDolly Parton’s younger sister Stella was to Dolly as Tommy Cash (big hit: 1969’s “Six White Horses,” about political assassinations of the ’60s) was to Johnny—which is to say, not an icon genius god for the ages worthy of Mount Rushmore, not even close, but in country music of all places perhaps being a regular old human being should count for something sometimes. Stella, who sings like Dolly but less cute, charted country 14 times between 1975 and 1983, but had only four Top 20s (including this one) and one Top 10. Whatever, this is an excellent string-­soaked countrypolitan cheated-­on single, a species that’s either extinct or endangered now, but appears to have been fairly prevalent at the time: Bill Anderson’s similarly themed “Liars One, Cheaters Zero,” for instance, had just gone Top 10 a few months earlier. But that one was score-­ 36 Chapter One\n\nkeeping and this one is a countdown (important difference!), and this one is hookier—even if Stella never seems to reveal what standard lies numbers five, six, seven, or nine are. The Kendalls: “Pittsburgh Stealers” (1978)\n\nOn the one-­of-­a-­kind 20-­track 1981 Warner Special Products country cheating song compilation Motels and Memories, the Kendalls are the only artists to appear twice, a distinguishing trait made even more astounding by the fact that they’re a father and daughter singing to each other—both born in St. Louis, respectively in 1935 and 1954. That should probably weird you out, though when I next explain that they sound like George Jones and Dolly Parton with roots in southern gospel, you might get interested anyway. Fairly traditional sounding for the urban cowboy era, actually—not exactly what you’d expect for a duo who first scored with covers of pop hits by Peter Paul & Mary, the Grass Roots, and Bread. “Pittsburgh Stealers,” wherein Royce works the steel mill day shift and Jeannie’s husband works the night shift, which provides an irresistible opportunity for nature to run its naked course, came right after two big Kendalls country hits with “sin” in their titles. It’s also notable for its northern urban industrial setting, always a country plus (see: Bobby Bare’s “Detroit City”), and for being one of the few Kendalls songs where Royce sings as much as Jeannie does. So naturally, the Steelers wound up winning Super Bowl XIII. But the pair’s inevitable 1982 sequel, “A Dallas Cowboy and a New Orleans Saint,” wasn’t nearly as good. Ronnie Milsap: “Get It Up” (1979)\n\nBlind North Carolina adult-­contemporary schlock-­country piano player Ronnie Milsap has never been especially shy about showing off his roots in soul music—early ’80s hits like “Stranger in My House” and “Any Day Now” can sound downright eerie if you’re in the right mood, and “Somewhere Dry,” off his 2006 album My Life, proved he hadn’t lost his touch decades after. But he probably never pushed the influence as far as on side two of his 1979 Images album, which started and ended with unabashed disco tracks of almost no legit country pedigree, except for the fact that Ronnie was singing them. The side opener was a glitzy cover of Tommy Tucker’s 1964 r&b hit “Hi Heel B.C. 37\n\nSneakers,” and the closer was “Get It Up”—basically, a ’70s-­style full-­band party-­funk number (think Brass Construction or Con Funk Shun maybe) that got to #43 on the pop chart and country radio avoided like the plague. (Something similar happened again to Milsap a few years later, with his slick Cars-­ ish mtv new wave move “She Loves My Car,” a #84 pop hit in ’84.) Anyway, as its title suggests, “Get It Up” isn’t just about dancing; it’s also about screwing: “You gotta get it up, get down, get it on, get on out / That’s the only way to make my baby shout”; he’s gonna “drive it home in 4/4 time” and move her “’til it hits the spot.” Dropping down low at strategic moments between the horn and string breakdowns, Milsap’s singing is rich and lusty enough to convince, too. I’m guessing the song got disco play—wouldn’t be shocked if it crossed over some to black radio. Eddie Rabbitt: “Suspicions” (1979)\n\nWhen you’re a country singer born second-­generation Irish in Brooklyn and raised in suburban Jersey, you take what success you can get, even if you’re the guy who wrote “Kentucky Rain.” But for a while there, Eddie Rabbitt had scads regardless—between “You Don’t Love Me Anymore” in 1978 and “You Can’t Run from Love” in 1983, 11 of the 13 singles he put out topped the country chart, and almost all pushed the genre’s definition in a manner schmaltzy enough to make purists’ heads explode. Which means, in his own way, Rabbitt was an innovator, hearing links between the reverb on pop-­disco and Sun rockabilly records, and figuring out how to squeeze the Eagles and “Subterranean Homesick Blues” into the recipe to boot. “Suspicions,” his most negative-­ spacious hit, about how when you’re in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends, was also his first to cross to the pop 20, and possibly the most quiet-­storming, yacht-­rocking country hit ever, from wafting woodwinds to blue-­eyed soul falsettos on down. Just gorgeous—no wonder Tim McGraw revived it (gorgeously, too) in 2007. —Complex, 5 June 2012\n\n38 Chapter One\n\nAll Ears (Realistic, 1977)\n\nCB Jeebies\n\n..... I somewhat facetiously raised the idea of cb radio songs last year, halfway figuring—without much evidence—that they might’ve been a brief fad in the late ’70s. (“A short list of Citizen Band radio songs, in case anybody needs one: C. W. McCall ‘Convoy’; Cledus Maggard and the Citizen’s Band ‘White Knight’; Rod Hart ‘cb Savage’; Gunter Gabriel ‘Ich Bin cb-­Funker’; mx-­80 Sound ‘pcb’s’; the Fall ‘I’m into cb.’ ”) Well, now I have proof—a compilation, released on Realistic Records and sold exclusively through Radio Shack according to its cover, called All Ears: 10 New and Original Song Hits with a cb Theme; found it for two dollars (a real splurge for me!) at a vintage store in Austin last week. No copyright year anywhere on the cover, but I assume not long post-­ “Convoy” (which topped the pop chart in early 1976). Best cuts, like that smash, are basically talking blues: “The Handles Hall of Fame” by Johnny Hemphill (a list of creative nicknames that makes me think of the one in Kool Moe Dee’s “Wild West West”) and “Listenin’ cb Blues” by Mac Wiseman (about trying to get used to all this newfangled technology). “Everybody’s Somebody (in Our B.C. 39\n\ncb World)” by Ed Bernet is the most American songpoem-­like in its cluelessness, but also the most proto-­Internet in concept—namely, the idea that, no matter how you look or whether you’re a young girl or an old man, you can create a persona and make friends to talk to via the network. “L.J.’s cb Radio” by Oscar Rey is a cornball Hee Haw standup routine; “The Night I Talked to the Lord (. . . on my cb Radio)” has the same concept as Carrie Underwood’s “Jesus Take the Wheel,” seeing as how God saves the driver from a devastating crash. Other songs—including Shirley & Squirrely’s “Hey Shirley (This Is Squirrely),” a Bicentennial Summer Top 50—show an obvious Ray Stevens and David Seville influence. Recurring theme: trying to make sense of all this brand-­new slang. —I Love Music, 31 January 2010\n\nCan’t Fool Mother Nature\n\n..... Dressed in down vests, flannel shirts, and Earth Shoes, “granolas” are often seen stalking the halls of wbhs with a knapsack on one arm, a pack of Real cigarettes in the other. Their sole purpose in life is to convince people that they are completely unaffected by our technological society. They are generally vegetarians, except for the occasional Big Mac. Everything they eat must be free of those modern demons, bha and bht. Their idea of fun is climbing mountains and catching pneumonia—a rather painful way to prove one’s macho. I can’t comprehend how someone could enjoy frozen arteries. Everything in their lives is simplistic and unsophisticated, even the 20-­speed bicycles they waste their life savings on. But actually, the backpacking bunch is a valuable resource in these trying times. In a time when everybody wants everything, it’s refreshing to know that there are still people around who’ll be happy with just a backpack, a pair of Earth Shoes, some hiking boots, a few pairs of flannel socks, some long underwear, a guitar, a cabin up north, a few hundred dollars’ worth of cross-­country ski apparatus, 12 pairs of Levi’s, a couple duck-­hunting rifles, some baking soda toothpaste, a three-­year subscription to Field and Stream, a lifetime supply of granola, a Bill Walton for President poster, a mountain, honorary membership to the Friends of Apple Island, and all of John Denver’s albums. —Spectrum, November 1977\n\n40 Chapter One\n\nProg on the Prairie: Midwestern Bands Roll Over Beethoven\n\n..... On the back of Kansas’s self-­titled first album, which came roaring out of Topeka in 1974, the band looks like six long-­haired farmboys, out standing in their field: blue jeans, Daniel Boone fringe jackets—one big guy even has overalls on. The front cover is a famous portrait of insurrectionary 19th-­ century Bleeding Kansas abolitionist John Brown; the last track, a eulogy for Mother Nature. Though released on a label run by Don Kirshner, the bizzer who’d masterminded the Monkees, the record never got higher than #174 in Billboard. A shame, because “Belexes” had the doom-­ridden punch of early British metal, “Bringing It All Back” was a good-­timey boogie-­woogie about smuggling drugs, and the band had a way of extracting Charlie Daniels–­style hillbilly fiddle hoedowns out of demi-­classical violin bombast, like they instinctively realized that lots of that high-­flown British orchestral foo-­foo started off as jiggy dance music to begin with. Kansas’s second and third albums—Song from America and Masque, which respectively managed to climb chartwise to #57 and #70 in 1975—worked similar pastiches of mean, chunky, even funky redneck rock and 10-­minute-­plus mini-­symphonies overflowing with time changes, crescendos, Moog filigrees, and delusions of grandeur. The heftier harvest mode holds up best: “The Devil Game,” “Mysteries and Mayhem,” another small-­time dope-­pusher tale called “Down the Road,” and the Nazareth-­like vengeance rager “Lonely Street,” which may or may not be about hunting down a “black man.” (Lyric sheet says “bad man,” but your ears might determine otherwise.) But it was the fancy stuff, which lent itself more to ballets than barn dances or bar fights, that most presaged Kansas’s lucrative future. In 1976 and 1977, they scored two huge hit singles off of punfully titled Top 10 albums that generally left their crasser hard rock side behind—“Carry On My Wayward Son” from Leftoverture, and “Dust in the Wind” from Point of Know Return. Complex, windswept, multipart harmonies became a band signature of sorts, but it wasn’t long before the group succumbed to the market-­researched restraint that turned underground fm radio into aor in the Lee Abrams–­consulted late ’70s. Eventually, guitarist Kerry Livgren and bassist Dave Hope were born again, playing music for Christ. “Q: How do you tell American art-­rockers from their European forebears?,” B.C. 41\n\nBob Christgau asked in 1976. “A: They sound dumber, they don’t play as fast, and their fatalism lacks conviction.” Not always true. It’s impossible to imagine cultured Brit conceptualists like Yes or Genesis dirtying their hands with most of the louder numbers on those first few Kansas lps, or for that matter the tougher tracks on early platters by the Illinois bands Head East or Styx— the latter of whom, even more than Kansas, stuck it out through several excellent but barely heard albums before breaking through to a big audience with prissier, more pop-­oriented material. But prog-­rock had initially pranced its way out of England for good reasons, and there’s something innately ridiculous, yet fascinating, about hicks from the American heartland picking up on its virtuoso high-­brow bombast in the mid-­’70s. In the discography at the back of John Rockwell’s “The Emergence of Art Rock” chapter in 1980’s Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock’n’Roll, the only Americans listed are expatriates Sparks and avant comedian Frank Zappa, hardly mainstream acts. “In comparison with the British,” Rockwell theorizes, “Americans tend to be happy cavepeople. Most American rockers wouldn’t know a Beethoven symphony if they were run down by one in the middle of the freeway.” So as often as not, progressive rockers from the midwestern prairie just rolled over Beethoven entirely. In fact, it might be a stretch to call R.E.O. Speedwagon prog at all, if they didn’t temper the riverboat-­pianoed bonfire-­ in-­the-­woods choogle of their first two albums with occasional outrageously ambitious, amp-­cranking, Hammond-­pumping gloom mon"
