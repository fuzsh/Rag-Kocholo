Music in Punk Circles Well, some of you may think it’s pompous to say it’s a “statement,” but I don’t fuckin’ care, I think that sometimes punx have some problems to take a stand. I don’t want to sound like I’m pretending to be above the crowd or anything and I don’t want to be the finger pointing kind of person, but this thing drives me mad. To begin with, my name is Numa. I’m involved in various bands in Brittany, in western France, including Litovsk. We cover Camera Silens and Blitz, so we’re not total strangers to the Oi! revival and we have some kind of responsibility in that phenomena. Mind you, this is my opinion and not the whole band’s opinion; I only speak for myself here. I hate when a type of music is hyped but yeah, sometimes it creates good stuff and some great bands are created so why not...But for fuck's sake , how can some bloody Rock Against Communism, some fascist or racist bands, be accepted and listened to by political punx? Why is it somehow acceptable to have patriotic bands playing in anarchist places or being interviewed in zines, who seemed to be politically not inclined to patriotism? Why? Why? Why? Now I’ll explain myself. In the two last years I saw bands saying in Maximum Rocknroll (for example) or other media that they were influenced by COMBAT 84 or saying, “Yeah man, we love French Oi!, BRUTAL COMBAT, SNIX, blah blah blah blah fucking blah,” and it was totally legit to say that here (well, I ask myself the question!). Well, OK. People may not understand lyrics when it comes to French Oi! But sometimes to publish chronicles in a zine, it demands some research. When I saw a columnist in MRR saying something like, “Yeah, SKINKORPS were nationalist at some point, but dude, their album is a classic!” I wanted to fucking puke. When SYNDROME 81 played in Sweden a young skin asked them, “Why don’t you guys play some BRUTAL COMBAT?” “Coz it’s a fucking nazi band!” “Yes, I know but they rock and they come from the same city! ” What the fuck is happening? I saw also a chronicle of the YESTERDAY’S HEROES LP who are known in Colombia for beeing outright fuckin’ nationalist bastards and who are known for vicious attacks on anarcho-punx and anti-fascist people there...I mean it’s fucking wrong to hype these bands...It’s fucking senseless. I mean, one of my friends was killed by a neo-nazi skinhead so seeing nazi or nationalist skinhead music going legit with MRR or punks worlwide is making me fucking sick! At least people will understand that? Second point, since when is it trendy to like patriotism in political punk circles? I mean I like COCK SPARRER but fuck, I won’t make them play at a gig in an anarchist place...I say that coz I don’t understand why it’s fucking cool to like RIXE and LION’S LAW (who share one member). I really don’t care about them playing in venues like bars or other gig rooms, but in anarchist places ? Like K-Town fest or Gaztexes in Basque Country? I don’t see the point...In a way I understand RIXE when they say in “Hexagone” that the situation is all fucked up and we’re all in a mess, but at the end if their “heart still beats in France,” we’re not on the same side sorry... And don’t try and say I am accusing them of beeing fascists or nazis coz they are not but you can be anti-racist and still be a patriot. I’ll never be on the same side of French patriots coz I’ll never be proud of this country which did so much shit in Africa and in every place we colonized. Even in the place I’m from, Brittany, the French government tried (and nearly succeeded!) in eradicating the Bretton language by force, therefore I’m not on the French patriotic side...And when their drummer does DIGITAL OCTOPUS, remixing some SKREWDRIVER, everyone seems to find it fucking funny. OK, I may not understand that humor or I may lack humor but there’s no fucking way I’m gonna dance to that tune with hundreds of punx at punk festivals or gigs... Last point for American politically dodgy skinheads who like CAMERA SILENS: they were a band with convictions and political lyrics. “Espoir Degus” is a song about Spanish republican and anarchist refugees in france and their singer just came out of the dark, after twenty-eight years on the run from the police, after having commited a bank robbery with some Basque anarchists in the ’80s. And for all non French speaking punks and skins who like old French punk and Oi!, do some research before hyping a band or buying their t-shirts...I may sounded like a PC punk on that, but I don’t really care, I just wanted to state some things and for the punks and skins who read this text to be aware of certain things... Remember no one is perfect, we all fucked up and did shit at some point. I never said I was perfect, never said I didn’t listen some shit bands, but there some things that need to be said. Freedom, peace, unity. —Numa By definition this is a rebuttal, but I'm not interested in changing hearts and minds regarding Oi! Most of Numa’s statement doesn't concern me: 1. I'm not an anarchist, 2. I don't live in France and 3. I don't care if a French anarchist lacks a sense of patriotism (duh)—so I'll keep opinions mercifully short. The hype surrounding modern French Oi! is mutable. People get excited. But inevitably the tourists return home. Remember the first CRIMINAL DAMAGE LP? Big hit. Remember the third CRIM-DAM LP? Not so much. Anyway, the hype has moved onto Bower-Boogie (aka Third Wave Pathetique). As for “nazi or nationalist skinhead music\" being “legit\" in MRR, I'd disagree. Grace Ambrose (Big-Ed as she's known around Gang HQ) has afforded me a wide berth when it comes to my column content but she has held my heels to the fire regarding bands that are too flagrant about their right-wing leanings. And I have attempted to make her life easier by self- censoring bands I would struggle to paint as “acceptable.\" I have never reviewed a white power band in my column. SKINKORPS were not then and are not now a WP band (go look at their crummy Facebook page). They started as a band who opposed the left-wing punk status quo by embracing a perfunctory nationalist stance (like most Oi! bands). SKINKORPS was never a “Party band\" such as LEGION 88 or BUNKER 84 was with the Front National. Their political activities amounted to a few “ anti-red\" songs and gang fights. But if a person's litmus test for enjoying an Oi! band is that one of their members robbed a bank with Basque anarchists then sadly SKINKORPS fail that test. What a high bar! But that doesn't deter me from listening to CAMERA SILENS. Most “politically dodgy skinheads\" (sure, I'll wear that) couldn't care less about CAMERA SILENS being pink. A band's political proclivities are not my own. If I so disagree with a bands political leanings—real or perceived—that it makes me want to stop listening to them and start arguing about them I put on a different record. Ya dig? It's a thoroughly unrighteous solution but it puts the onus on me to change my surroundings. And is it truly trendy to be patriotic and punk in France? If so, the skins over there need to have a little chit-chat about division of labor. Being into punk and embracing the spirit of your country was one of the reasons skinheads came back. Patriotism is our thing! Like Choke sings, “Punks do nuthin', give us a bad name!\" But really real, the topic of what does or does not fit the purview of punk is a boring and puerile exercise that makes me wish HitList was still being published. I do enjoy discussing Oi! though (thanks MRR!). And I'm glad Numa wrote in to share his gripes. See yinz later in the mag. —Turbo This conversation has taken on a renewed relevance with the currently more-visible rise of the white supremacist right worldwide and its close ties with nationalist movements (in many cases, they are synonymous). MRR stands against nationalism , patriotism f and white supremacy. So should there be space for Oi! at all in these pages? Write us a letter. inception, Pelican Pow Wow Records was meant to promote punk and rock n roll, with a focus on New Orleans and Gulf Coast bands. Combining iconic elements that I loved about New Orleans (pelicans and Mardi Gras Indians) made sense at the time. But, I fucked up. People have said that our logo is appropriative and offensive. It no longer makes sense to continue using a name and logo when I cannot defend them, in good conscience, against such claims. If you were offended, I am truly sorry. It is also hard to justify producing petroleum based products for entertainment purposes, when oil wars rage on and most people want their music digitally streaming anyway. But, I still think there is a valuable place in the world for physical media. And, I still feel strongly comitted to promoting bands who are making music that makes life more worth living. So, please wish goodnight and goodbye to PPW and say hello to SPACE TAKER SOUNDS sounds that take up space rCOLUMNSi When I was first getting into metal, the lyrics were one of the most appealing parts of the genre. I’m not talking about the songs dealing with gruesome acts of violence, but rather the ones about real people. When discussing metal lyrics, many people will touch on the problematic elements (such as blatant misogyny and homophobia), the horror themes, or the psychological investigations. I didn’t want anything to do with that. I was an angsty teenager, looking to find my own place in the world and my own way to express myself. I wanted nothing to do with the lifestyles of my family and all their friends. So, continuing a trend among a lot of middle and high schoolers, I turned to metal bands and lyrics for sources of power and inspiration as well as an outlet for my emotions. At their best, metal lyrics can be cathartic and powerful descriptions of defiance in the face of hegemonic systems, which is exactly what I needed as an atheist teen growing up in a strongly authoritarian fundamentalist Christian household. At worst...well...at worst there’s nu-metal lyrics. But I digress. In particular I was enamored with Metallica. James Hetfield has written his fair share of truly awful lyrics (especially as they got more and more famous), but in the early years of the band, his words are incredible statements about the human spirit. Their songs are musically well-written, sure, but I don’t think they would have become such a popular band if they had written solely about horror or the supernatural. One of the strongest examples of the lyrics carrying the weight of a Metallica song is on their 1984 album Ride The Lightning. Many people, including the band themselves, deride “Escape” as the only weak moment on that record, but lyrically it remains one of their most relatable songs. The fines from its chorus can be made relevant to anybody’s fife: “No need to hear the things that they say/Life ’s for my own to live my own way” I found myself revisiting this song after having a negative experience with the Tallahassee incarnation of the national Women’s March that happened in January. Due to the strong likelihood of extreme weather conditions, the organizers of the march made the unpopular decision to reroute the parade from the original endpoint of the state capitol to a large building at Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University. This change was made due to liability and safety concerns; instead of marching for over an hour in a massive storm, the march would now take less than twenty minutes. It was a y thoughtful compromise yet many people were publicly calling the organizers inept for making this change. Two of my friends were among those who were organizing the event and seeing that they were overwhelmed with negative responses, I decided to help them out and encourage people to follow the new plans. One person made a great point about how it was upsetting that the new route would not be as visible, which she viewed as paramount to its success. She correctly stated that marches like the Women’s March can help viewers feel empowered and capable of standing up for their own rights. In my response to her, I agreed with her, and briefly wrote about my background and how important it was to me to discover radical politics and the LGBTQ+ community despite the efforts of my family to keep them away from me. But I also argued that participants can feel just as empowered by marching and then use the feelings of solidarity in their hometowns to work towards creating a meaningful and beneficial change in their fives. Pretty positive, no? Unfortunately, it also led to someone telling me that I had no place to talk like that, nor did I have a place in the march itself given that I am not a “real” woman. I won’t go into further details about that response, but the way that she wrote to me was extremely dehumanizing. It was my first experience with genuine transphobia and it left me sick to my stomach. That’s when I also knew that I had to go to the march. I had to do it in order to spite her. Driving to the march, I was instinctively drawn to put on Ride The Lightning , and in particular “Escape.” I found myself half shouting and half crying along to the first verse: “Fee/ no pain but my life ain ’t easy / I know Tm my best friend / No one cares but I’m so much stronger /Til fight until the end.” And fought I did. Lost in a sea of pussy hats, surrounded by people who probably would not call me a woman, I marched with those words echoing in my mind. I was proud to be there at the march, but I don’t think I could have attended if I didn’t have the fiercely positive affirmation from James Hetfield. Now that I’m done sharing my feelings with you all, here’s some great metal releases that have come out recently: CARNAGE - 34°23”41’N 132°27”17'E CS (self-released): I first heard of this band mostly by accident—I saw that there was a new release on bandcamp from “CARNAGE” and I immediately (and erroneously!!) assumed it was one of the well-known CARNAGES out there. This is a new CARNAGE, and they are from Portugal. When I saw that they fisted their influences as classic British crust punk, I knew that this would be up my alley. I’ve been obsessing with bands like SACRILEGE and the ENGLISH DOGS lately, so I was thrilled to hear another band that would carry on with this sound. Don’t expect any speedy thrash ragers though—these songs are mostly mid-tempo with a lot of emphasis on riffs. The best comparison for their sound doesn’t come from England, but rather from the more crusty direction that DARKTHRONE has been pursuing for the last several years. If you close. your eyes and listen, some of these sound like homages to NOCTURNO CULTO’s riffs. And just like DARKTHRONE, sometimes this demo is a little repetitive, but for the most part this is fun and worth your time. si*** DEATH WORSHIP - Extermination Mass EP (Nuclear War Now! Productions): Holy shit! After what feels like for fucking ever, there’s a new damn record out from R. Forster AKA Deathlord of Abomination and War Apocalypse from CONQUEROR (and currently of BLASPHEMY). I’m a huge fangirl of the Ross Bay Cult scene, so much so that I will willingly listen to almost any band that tries to rip off their general sound. But this... this is the real deal. Who else could get the Nocturnal Grave Desecrator and Black Winds from BLASPHEMY to guest on their album? Yes, that’s right. In a way, this is almost a CONQUEROR reunion, since their drummer J. Read (now of the incredible REVENGE) 9 COLUMNS COLUMNS is the only other musician featured on every track. But unlike CONQUEROR, this is entirely R. Forster’s trip through hell. Each of the six tracks is heavy, heavy, heavy with an overwhelming amount of deep, roaring guitars and gnarly blastbeats. If you like war metal, or you want to check out the sorts of directions that black metal can go in, pick this fucker up. Believe it or not, this is better than CONQUEROR. But if you haven’t heard much extreme metal, give BEHERIT or early SODOM a listen before you listen to this. *** THE OMINOUS CIRCLE - Appalling Ascension 2xLP (20 Buck Spin): Is there a portal to hell in Portugal? If not, the OMINOUS CIRCLE are certainly working on creating their own. Appalling Ascension is their first release so far, but it easily sounds like the work of an accomplished, long- running band. The OMINOUS CIRCLE play a kind of death metal that has been increasingly popular in the last several years, nicknamed “cavemcore” or “cavemdeath.” Silly nickname aside, this subgenre is mostly named for the sort of atmospheric and deep sounds that the bands have. Every time you see that nickname, please think to yourself “inspired by INCANTATION.” Just like INCANTATION and the bands that have followed in their footsteps (such as PORTAL, IRKALLIAN ORACLE, or GRAVE MIASMA), the band is very low-end heavy, with very detuned guitars almost constantly tremolo picking individual notes. This gives it the “cavernous” feeling. I’m afraid that I have made this style and this album sound samey and uninteresting— Appalling Ascension is actually one of the strongest releases I’ve heard in this particular style. The band goes from INCANTATION-style riffs to MORBID ANGEL sludgefests fairly often, and pretty much every single song has highly technical (and also fairly noisy) guitar solos in it. In other words, it rips fucking hard. MISI>YRMING / SINMARA - split 10” (Terratur Possessions): When discussing the genre, critics tend to lump black metal bands together based on the region that they’re from. Sometimes it doesn’t make much sense at all (i.e. lumping all of American black metal into “USBM”), but other times a region has a distinct and tightly formed sound. This can be said of Iceland, and this split between two of their best black metal bands is representative of it. It’s easy to talk about Iceland’s black metal scene as one body of work for two reasons. For one, many of the Icelandic black metal bands share members, and secondly, most of the bands there are influenced by the same band: the fairly dissonant French group DEATHSPELL OMEGA. This split is a continuation in these bands’ exploration in dissonance. Both tracks on are powerful—MISbYRMING’s song features what almost sounds like breakdowns (!?!?), whereas the SINMARA track sounds like lightning streaking across a deep red sky. At one song each, this split EP leaves me desperately wanting more. Check this one out if you haven’t heard any Icelandic black metal before and you want to explore their sound. Please send demos, questions, and comments to deathpoemrecs@gmail.com. Miles of ink have been spilled debating and dissecting the fabled school-to-prison pipeline, a problem endemic to the U.S. education system that almost exclusively affects its most socioeconomically disadvantaged students, students for whom realistic options for survival and resistance were always slim and high-risk. Less commonly discussed, however, are what options exist for these students' educational attainment following their likely incarceration at the hands of an oppressive capitalist state—and what options for survival and resistance remain in this most-restrictive of environments. This month's column features some powerful reflections from Lena Tahmassian, a PhD researcher and teacher living in Oakland, CA, and a perennial MRR reader as well as contributor in more recent years. Her column focuses on the importance of not-for-profit prison higher education and solidarity in the post-reason era. Lena can be reached at lena.tahmassian@gmail.com. On February 1, 2017 inmates took over a wing of the Vaughn Prison in Delaware, protesting Trump and demanding better conditions and “remedies conducive to reform and rehabilitation” with education at the top of their list. A guard who was taken hostage died and there is now, at the time of writing, a civil rights coalition asking for a transparent federal investigation. Little more than that information was made known to the public. While most prisons are public institutions, there is not much common knowledge about what goes on in them. Whether or not there will be a further degradation of prison conditions under Trump (there could easily be), this act holds symbolic weight: members of the most marginalized group in society (most can’t even vote) protest an administration that will more than ever place private profit over people, an administration that has already made explicit that various (disproportionately nonwhite) sectors of the population are essentially disposable. Returning to the prisoners’ demands, this column is in defense of not-for-profit higher education in prisons, not only because I believe that people are not disposable, but also that teaching and learning go both ways. My higher education teaching experience to date has been split between graduate student teaching at an elite university and volunteer teaching for the accredited college program at San Quentin State Prison. I got involved in the latter because there was a need for my particular skills, I wanted to do something less self-serving than just getting a PhD, and to expand my teaching skills. In general, I was up for the challenge of teaching people whose experiences would mostly be very different from my own. While I’ve taught in two radically different learning environments, my basic objectives are fundamentally the same: to teach them to create meaning out of texts and to critically think and rethink the basis of knowledge production. One notable difference of prison higher education, other than the technological lack (only pen and paper are available), is that when your everyday reality is the very definition of confinement, the classroom acquires a new liberating dimension. Students are eager to speak and share their experiences, and the classroom is, unlike their cellblocks, racially integrated. For us as instructors, being a volunteer in a free program is also in itself liberating (provided you can make time for it). This dynamic does seem to partially inform the students’ attitudes which shift more towards “Thanks for teaching us!” rather than the “Hey, I’m paying for this!” vibe of the increasingly neoliberal academy. That said, I’ve had many considerate and inquisitive students at the traditional university, but some do treat education like a product to be consumed. I suppose in defense of the student- as-consumer mindset (from their perspective), one must recognize that the astronomical cost of higher education and the fact that many students will be indebted into the foreseeable future places increasing pressure on them to see learning as a serious financial investment on which they must see a return. In my experience, incarcerated students tend to ask “is this how they do things at... (Stanford, Berkeley, etc.)?” They want to 10 know that they are being challenged and not patronized. It’s also a good practice for me to always question and reflect on my methods by having to explain why we assess learning a certain way. I’ve come to believe strongly however that it’s not just about importing and adapting methodologies from the elite academy for those who in many cases were never afforded the opportunity of higher education, but that prisoners also have a lot to teach us. Bringing all of their diverse life experiences to the table opens up new possibilities for discussion. Also, many of us tend to slide through life avoiding our problems, burying our traumas, making the same mistakes, and never facing our insecurities head on. For those seeking rehabilitation, self-reflection is unavoidable and often involves identifying and extirpating the markers of toxic masculinity. I’ve seen how the various programs offered, including college education, help develop self-awareness, discipline, resolve, and a spirit of cooperation that I have not seen anywhere else. For prisoners it can be a matter of life or existential death. Those who go through the rehabilitation process have accomplished the very difficult task of confronting their issues head on and facing those whose lives they have potentially damaged. To thrive within the walls for the time being, you have to be able to imagine something better beyond them. Perhaps this is something we can all learn from. Upon advocating for prison higher education, I know that on ethical grounds maybe I am mostly preaching to the choir in this column. But for the naysayers (maybe they’ll be at your next family function), it also makes a lot of sense from a utilitarian standpoint. Even though most of us don’t have much of a clue what goes on in prisons, we nevertheless fund them through our taxes. Like it or not, most prisoners are eventually released, and access to education while incarcerated dramatically decreases the rate of recidivism. Yes, there are dangerous people who are probably incapable of not harming others—those who fit this profile are not typically eligible for rehabilitation programs in the first place. Thus higher education in prison is good for both prisoners and society, and those who initiated the Vaughn prison uprising surely- knew that. But the current rise of corporate fascism is indeed a double whammy, as it seeks to designate enemies of the state and profit off of their subjugation, which can take the form of public prison labor and private prison contracts, border walls, armaments, etc. Now more than ever, electoral political discourse is beyond logic and reason, with no longer even a semblance of concern for others (unless you’re white and poor, then there is just a semblance of concern for you, but seriously, wake up people: those industrial jobs are not coming back and its not brown people’s fault). However, on a positive note, there is a whole new generation of resistance cropping up who is questioning what they’ve been told about who the “bad guys” are in the first place. The consensus has fallen out. Let’s hope that sliding back to corporate liberalism is not the best we can do. Specifically, on the topic of issues that impact incarcerated people directly: last year Obama did bring back Pell Grants for prisoners for the first time since 1994 when Bill Clinton pulled the plug on all federal funding for prison higher education by signing the Violent Crime Bill, which was actually written by the then-senator Joe Biden. The Democrats of old may have reversed their stance on that disastrous bill, but the damage is surely done. Also, I can’t say for sure, but my best guess is that Pell Grants for prisoners will be going away again. (Is the incoming Education Secretary seriously a semi-illiterate billionaire and advocate of for-profit education and arming schoolchildren?) These days, a lot of people seem to be asking a variation of the question: “What is our responsibility to people we disagree with?” (“Is it OK to punch a Nazi?”) I don’t claim to have .all the answers (Yes, it’s OK to punch a Nazi). I think there’s actually a simple formula for this: if your worldview is defined by exclusion and denying people’s humanity, then you’re actually the one shutting down the possibility for discussion. Aside from the more extreme examples (unfortunately, I think they’ll be increasing), should we try to change people’s minds? We need to build our resistance, but is there a tool to measure the distance between our ideas, to determine when it’s no longer worth our breath? I think teachers are in a privileged position to promote dialogue, expand minds, and also build empathy bridges in the classroom, but also way beyond. A lot of the students share my worldviews, many don’t. In light of the current reality, I’m all for increasing the possibility of encounters with people you would probably otherwise never engage with. Sometimes I feel like our social media echo chambers will be the death of us. I’ll carry on contemplating the limits of our responsibility. On a final note, I highly encourage grad students, graduate degree holders, and faculty to get involved with prison higher education in your area. There are also organizations that take book donations to send to incarcerated people—I’ve met inmates who have accessed important literature this way! If you live in the Bay Area, I can point you in the right direction. You will talk to a lot of interesting people, learn about the prison system, and subsequently become a prison abolitionist or at least an advocate for the humanity of those who deserve a second chance, or even an actual first chance at a decent life. Compounded by the fact that American reality is now producing marginality at a rapid rate, it has been reassuring to hear the marginal voices growing louder and more plentiful in the last weeks. We must continue to also defend the basic rights of those who have no voice at all. The Teaching Resistance column is designed to provide a platform for radical, subversive teachers / educators to share their ideas and draw attention to important issues around education; particularly compulsory- and community-based education. If you are a teacher (anywhere in the world) for students of primary or secondary school ages (K-12), community colleges , or alternative learning arrangements such as collectivist free schools, and you want to submit an idea for a column, please write an email to teachingresistance@ gmail.com. There is also an archive for this column, which can be found online at teachingresistancearchive.blogspot.com. m m m m m m m m -m m m *■ . . . • * * '• » * f S futures # *erika elizabeth Writing this column every month is becoming more and more of a challenge when the list of legitimately awful things with serious societal repercussions (at least for everyone who isn’t in a position of privilege or power) gets longer with each passing day. Muslims are being ufilawfully detained at airports and banned from entering the country, a wave of deportations are a real and tangible threat, our political leaders are supporting the erasure of Jews from the historical narrative of the Holocaust, environmental regulations are being systematically dismantled while scientists are stonewalled and silenced, reproductive rights are being targeted, and we have literal white supremacists controlling our government in the United States, but c’mon, let me tell you all about some limited-run punk records that came out recently! At the same time, I think there is a very important place for the creative efforts of and pasts SNiAimoo COLUMNS COLUMNS COLUMNS our larger underground community to help support everyday acts of subversion and resistance. My band spent the weekend of the presidential inauguration playing our friends MALL CASTE’s last two shows in some smaller cities that were a quick drive from Portland, but relatively off-the-beaten- path when it comes to the usual Pacific Northwest tour circuit. The plans were made before those specific dates had taken on any real significance, and it was a really strange situation to navigate—encouraging people to “get to the gig” seems kind of self-important when everyone is in the midst of so much deserved anger and mourning and protest. After we got back to Portland, I started mentally processing everything, thinking about how I had just played a bunch of punk songs about alienation and distorted realities in a coffee shop in Corvallis, Oregon (a place Td previously only ever spent maybe an hour tops) with people who I care about and who have always had my back, how other people had chosen to be present and together in that space at that specific point in time, and the conversations that we had about the potential to foster more connections and collaborations with the new friends we had just met in a thriving and tight-knit DIY scene not too far from our own, and how all of that was, at least in a small way, inherently a rejection of so much of what is currently polluting the greater cultural mainstream. Things are really fucked, but we can (and should) collectively use it as an opportunity to be more intentional in supporting the people and groups who have the most to lose right now, which in an explicidy “punk” context could mean something as concrete as organizing benefit shows for truly radical causes, or something more comparatively abstract like making a better effort to book bills that aren’t just made up of straight, white, cis men. Should be common sense, but just in case y’all need a reminder... A few records that I’ve been particularly taken with lately, since that’s what I’m actually here to talk about: Australia is more or less ground zero these days when it comes to producing bands with obvious debts to the FALL (seriously, have you heard that SHIFTERS single from last year yet?), with the new two-song 7” from EXILES FROM CLOWNTOWN only supporting the theory that some copies of Hex Enduction Hour must currently be in heavy circulation Down Under. The EXILES have been kneeling at the altar of Mark E. Smith for longer than most of their peers, though—they’ve been around since at least 2009, quietly putting out a record every couple of years in a stark contrast to the the prolificity of Mr. Smith and company in their prime. For this one, A-side “Oh Well” mines a sparse post-punk drone spiked with dour monotone vocals and trebly guitar for over five minutes, drawing from the FALL at their most nihilistic (see “Smile” from Perverted By Language for one obvious reference point), but also the sprawling and frayed experimental noise conjured by the DEAD C and their late ’80s / early ’90s Xpressway Records cohort over in New Zealand. On the other side of the single, “Contradiction Dance” pares the FALL-isms down to a foundation of lyrics repeated nonchalantly over a lean rhythm of percolating bass and drums, cut with some truly fractured psychedelic organ to make everything just a little more unsettling. Totally wired. (Soft Abuse, softabuse.com) RANK / XEROX were one of my favorite bands of the last decade or so, although I hadn’t really seen or heard anything about them in the years since their killer 2011 LP on Make a Mess and had kind of figured that they were over and done by now. But (amazingly!) they’re back, with a new four-song EP called M.Y.T.H. that bridges the sinister, frantic post¬ punk edge of their previous records and the more introspective and melancholy electronic- accented pop songs of guitarist / vocalist David West’s RAT COLUMNS project. There are some synths in the picture this time around that are alternately new wave-leaning (on the title track) and nearly SCREAMERS- esque (the foreboding “Ingenue”), while “Zero Hour” strips everything to the sort of economical slash-and-burn that dozens of “dark punk” groups have been trying to nail since RANK / XEROX were last in the picture. Even if this is the last that we hear from them, they’ve gone out here with what is probably their best song yet. “Deletion” starts with a brief paranoid buzz of synth before locking into nearly six minutes of needling tension and gradual release, giving off echoes of the WIPERS’s epic “Youth of America” if it were turned inside out. Most welcome surprise of this garbage year so far, for sure. (Adagio830, adagio830.de / rankxerox.bandcamp.com) Snakes and Shapes is the latest LP from the very appropriately named Brisbane trio BENT, channeling the off-kilter sounds of the most warped and wonderful weirdos of the late ’70s / early ’80s DIY milieu without falling into the trap of becoming some paint-by-numbers throwback. Sure, there are some unsubtle parallels to the RAINCOATS that can be traced from the ramshackle, clattering rhythms and fervently chanted vocals on “Bad Beds” and ‘'Semicircles,” and the prickly scrape of songs like “Brick Brick” points to a certain debt owed to No Wave’s femme faction—think UT, or if you really want to dig deep, Boston’s super¬ underrated BOUND AND GAGGED. But the real threads ultimately connecting BENT to their post-punk antecedents are their untamed approach to sidestepping the most linear path from point A to point B and their skill in taking jigsaw parts that have no apparent way of fitting together and devising their own way of piecing them into a joyously askew whole. (Moontown, moontown.bandcamp.com) Say hey! Analog: Erika Elizabeth / 2545 E. Burnside Street #203 / Portland, OR 97214 / USA, digital: ripitupstartagain@gmail.com, more sights and sounds: futuresandpasts.org Right, so if you’re reading this mag you are well aware that we here in the US are well fucked, and are rapidly making things worse for everyone else on the planet at the moment. Things are fucking bad and they’re going to get a lot fucking worse before they get better (if they get better). I’m gonna break format a little bit this month and start out my column with a book recommendation for the the angry and dispirited. Beating the Fascists: the Untold Story of Anti-Fascist Action offers a chilling history lesson, documenting the rise of the hard-right in the UK, from the NF to the BNP (published in 2010, it pre-dates the rise of the UKIP) and the role that the toothless left played in allowing their unchecked rise to power. Perhaps more importantly it documents the efficacy of the direct actions carried out by those who had the courage, both physical and moral, to actually stand up to the far-right. It is beyond appalling that it’s 2017 and the conversation is about “is it OK to punch a Nazi?” and not “how the fuck did we get to this point and how can we chase these fucking fascists back into the holes they crawled out of?” While American “progressives” mewl about Richard “Does human civilization really need the Black race?” Spencer’s (yes, that’s an actual quote) right to free speech, the white racist-dominated government of this country is ensuring that five-year-olds are being handcuffed and detained for the crime of being bom in the wrong country. To quote punk (and Antifa) heros CONFLICT: “This 12 is not enough, stand up and fucking fight!” The time to react ha slong since passed, it’s fucking time to stand up. Ladies and gentiemen, DEFUSE are back! The legendary all-female crasher crust pioneers, who were contemporaries and frequent gig-mates of bands like COLLAPSE SOCIETY, DECEIVING SOCIETY and GLOOM reformed last year after a very long drummer-less hiatus, and while I'd seen them pop up on a few bills here and there, I never got my hopes up that we'd get a new recording to supplement their criminally small discography (two demo tapes, the split EP with POLIKARPA Y SUS VICIOSAS and one measly comp track), but here we are! Even more amazing, the new Cry of Roar EP showcases the band at the very top of their game, more than fifteen years removed from their last recording. The EP starts off with “Conflict,” a short sharp blast of razor fuzz, galloping drums and throat-peeling vocals that will take you right back to the mid-'90s heyday of the “All Crusties...” era. “Cry of Roar” follows, a more developed but no less visceral attack with a memorable riff and truly unhinged shrieking backup vocals. The real surprise is the B-side-spanning “Silence,” a mid-tempo epic that owes as much to KILLING JOKE (especially the almost- tribal drum breaks) as CHAOS UK, all of course buried under fuzz and held down by an implacable driving bass line. I listened to this fucker at least six times in the first twenty- four hours I had it in my hot little hands and if you love crasher crust (you better fucking love crasher crust!), you'll definitely do the same. This is fantastic on every level save the horrible pixelation of the record art, but that's hardly an issue when the contents are so very fucking crucial. Fortunately, this is on MCR and will thus have better than average worldwide distribution, which will in turn make it easier for you the reader to snap it up ASAP! Any other time, the new CONTROL / EXIT HIPPIES split EP would have been the best news of the month, but here it is consigned to co-headliner status. What an embarrassment of riches this month has brought us! Not surprisingly, this record fucking rules. CONTROL show up doing what they do best: vicious, stripped-down CONFUSE-worship executed flawlessly. The perfectly ramshackle recording, the blown-out guitar fuzz, the venom-dripping vocals, the endless fills from the tin pan drums, the bold and melodic bass driving it all, everything here supports and enhances everything else. CONTROL are a group that have fully embraced obscurity, rarely performing live or releasing records, and that's a crying shame because they're a world-class band. EXIT HIPPIES, ceding the hardcore high ground to their split-mates, offer up one long track of noize-drenched techno-industrial chaos, only drifting into guitar-driven noisecore in the last 45 seconds of the piece. It's a perfect complement to the CONTROL side and a very pleasing re¬ affirmation that they are still down with the extreme experimentation that characterized their early work. Please note that the packaging for this record does not include any band names, or even the label name (it's on the massively unheralded and underrated Paank Levytlabel), so you'll have to keep an extra close eye out for it. This is an easy early candidate for the top ten of 2017. Alright, that's enough challenging, confrontational hardcore for now. Let's crack a beer, turn off our brains and talk about the new BEERBELLY EP already! It’s called The Kids Just Wanna Pogo Dance, and you definitely need to know that because they forgot to put the band name anywhere on the record. (I fucking love this band.) Yup, it's ddmb. Uh-huh, it's fast (well, as fast as these goofballs can play anyway). Is it very much like their other records? You fuckin' bet, and that means it's well worth your worthless time and valuable beer money. “Pictures of Lily” is definitely the song of note on the EP, both for it's epic length (over two minutes!), relaxed tempo and straight up '77 punk feel. It's a good 'un. In the nightmare that the world has become, bands like BEERBELLY that offer up nothing but irresponsible fun and chaos are more valuable than ever before. “Love beer, love pogo punk and hate work”? Me fuckin' too. There are three things to really love about the new Headnoise Hardcore compilation tape. The first is that it's a compilation tape, an awesome and seemingly long-forgotten format that allowed countless punx of the '80s relatively cheap and easy access to the best of hardcore from around the world. Second is that, in these trying times, any project that can bring together fifteen bands from across the globe is worth supporting. Third, and most important, the material is fuckin’ great! The big “gets” here are the previously unreleased ABSOLUT track (wow!) and two previously unheard PROXY tracks (double wow!) and a new LIFE track (triple wow!) but there's a ton of great stuff on this comp, much of it from Russian and Finnish bands that may be unfamiliar to most readers. Highlights include the furious, riff-heavy metallic d-beat of ANTIMELODIX, the incredibly catchy metal- punk of DUKE NUKEM and the furious, gritty straightforward hardcore of the female- fronted KOVAA RASVAA. This comp is a great, cost-effective way to check out some new tracks from old favorites and get into some unheralded bands that might have flown 13 under your radar. Seriously, the LIFE track is worth the price of admission alone! Finally, our friends as Desorden Records have offered up the CHARGED SS demo and it is, not surprisingly given how fucking amazing everything out of Mexico is these days, an absolute blazer. This is D-beat done absolutely correctly, raw and unpretentious, driven by frantic drumming and staggering riffs. The BPM is never that high but it feels fast as fuck, with every player in complete control but giving the impression of a car with no* brakes barreling towards doom. The bleak, reverb-heavy vocals offer up a great deal of gravitas, a quality that many if not most modem D-beat bands sorely lack. If you're singing about war and death it’s gotta fucking sound like you care and CHARGED SS leave no doubt that they do. Well-executed '80s throwback art completes an excellent package. Fantastic stuff from a band that I can't wait to hear more from. Fuck it, that's it for now. See you all next month, when things will have somehow gotten even worse than they are right now, I'm sure. Write c/o MRR or email at agunderwood@ gmail.com to commiserate. I don’t think anyone should take advice, but there are probably a lot of things for the punks to talk about, and we might as well do it here. Think of it more as an opinion column though, (...and if we need a tagline for that I hope it can be something as vague as: “A column for people who are intrigued by subtle differences between the 'punks’and the 'punx.’”) How is it that the Misfits are the worst band ever and also the best band ever? If you describe them they sound like a fetid turd, but they're so good! Everyone loves them even though you can prove mathematically that they’re terrible. They're iconic enough that people find them right out of the starting gate, and with not much to compare them to musically yet, they're catchy and accessible, they fit in perfectly with our whole early punk love affair thing. I always assumed that the Misfits's popularity just benefited from this place in a punk’s early discovery timeline, when we’re equipped with SNIAimOO COLUMNS COLUMNS COLUMNS a strong desire to identify with punk tradition, and then it becomes reliant on nostalgia and Hot Topic to fill in the gaps that maintain the standing for the next group. And it’s really not toootally undeserved. Listening to the Misfits feels like when you thought it was your punk birthright to hang out in dingy warehouses that are covered in spray paint and you’d be skateboarding in there cause, I don’t know, there’s probably a ramp, and you have on a super cool jacket or something, and you would just pray that you would run into the state in a dark alley because you were ready to smash it so fucking hard, I swear to god. Like in the kind of places where the Foot Clan hangs out in the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. It’s totally fair that you would love the Misfits from cradle to grave. It’s a pretty common phenomena for a band to be stuck in this kind realm of confusion. It’s also how a lot of people feel about the Ramones and the Dead Kennedys. Do we haaave to keep explaining everything? If your job isn’t to review bands and music specifically, why do you gotta explain the Misfits to anybody? We all already know about them and that they’re a staple and you either hold on or you don’t, blah blah blah. Opinion debates are designed to be un-winnable, and I just can’t trust anyone who claims they can prove their point mathematically, you know? It’s not like you’re trying to defend Henry Rollins as a person, so no big deal! But I want to talk about <( feels like ” as welcome and valid truth experiences for our explanations with each other instead. For example, being allowed to love and experience a band as great when they’re truly awful, i.e. “guilty pleasures” but minus the guilt; that scenario definitely counts as deserving a “feels like ” pass, but, more importantly, so do experiences like “I don’t know why, that person just makes me really uncomfortable,” or “I know that the thing they said was pretty ambiguous, but...” or “I don’t feel like that organization takes women seriously” or whatever else. Not to be confused with alternative facts / lies / prejudices that people have been trying to pass off as genuine, but the real ass things your friends don’t know how to explain, but that they are experiencing as real. It’s important to hear each other and offer to support our different viewpoints as much as it is to diss the crummy music they are into as a buddy bonding activity. Which, don’t get me wrong, is a very fun thing to do, but right now more than ever when people are giving up so much of themselves everyday just paying attention and fighting and being threatened and stalked, let’s just listen to each other without judgment and trust that what they’re feeling is legitimate ass shit. Still fighting, even when you ’re tired. All this strength is so impressive every single day. Thanks so much for everything you do.

It seems like I have been mentioning George Orwell a lot in this column lately. Orwell is a great example of a person who used art to make a point about society whose body of work and views have endured far longer than * any of his contemporaries. We use Orwellian just like we use Kafkaesque as an adjective. While many intellectuals were writing about the trend towards totalitarianism in Orwell’s day, we remember none of them, but 1984 is back at the top of the bestseller list. One thing I touched on last month is the Orwellian nature in which the white supremacist movement has managed to reinvent and legitimize itself under the new radical right wing regime. Yesterday’s Neo- Nazi is now the innocuous White Nationalist. I am not sure where this term White Nationalist came from, but it is a blatant attempt to legitimize discredited terms such as Neo-Nazi or White Supremacist, just another example of the kind of newspeak currently up the flagpole along with “alternative facts.” It’s time to crank up the bullshit detector to eleven because it’s coming hard and fast. I talked to some people about last month’s column and they felt I was being extreme, paranoid, and / or alarmist. First, let me say this: I was talking about the worst-case scenario, not the most likely scenario. Second, I spend a lot of time reading about the regimes of the 20th century, notably those of Stalin and Hitler, and I have a tendency to rely heavily on historic parallels in analysis. Let me use an amusing anecdote to make my point. When I was a toddler I used to watch my mother and grandmother bake cookies.. Like most toddlers I liked cookies. So one day when my mom wasn’t paying attention, I decided to make cookies. I dumped all the canisters of flour, sugar and the like from the kitchen counter onto a tray and put it in the oven. Then sat and watched. I of course succeeded only in making a huge mess until my mom came in and caught me. Our country today is like a toddler trying to bake cookies. We have all the ingredients for a fascist police state, and the will to create one by a sector of the population. But mixing all the ingredients correctly and getting the oven to the right temperature to recreate 1933 is unlikely. However, some of those ingredients might still come off the shelf and get mixed up creating a huge mess, with terrible results. I feel that the coming months will have many tests to see how far the drift to authoritarianism is going to take us. Also, there is still a chance to act to prevent things getting too far out of line. Already the Muslim travel ban sets the precedent of isolating a minority group and placing emphasis on having “the right papers.” I think this is an important psychological primer for the advent of a police state. I would pay close attention to what happens at the next protest that erupts over the killing of an unarmed Black man by police. Here in Minnesota, there have been two police killings recently, both of which resulted in protest. After the shooting of Jamar Clark, protestors were allowed to assemble and protest for some time, but their encampment outside a police station was eventually broken up. Still, few people were arrested or charged. However, some alt-right internet trolls did a drive by shooting on the protesters, wounding five. After the shooting of Philando Castille, which made the national news, the police kept their distance. Protesters blocked the freeway and other major roads. Some were arrested, but I feel like the police were told to keep repressive measures in check rather than provoke more unrest and confrontation. Likewise, the many Dakota access pipeline protests have been fairly peaceful. It would be very telling if the next round of protests is met with major police repression and stiff charges against activists. This would be a clear signal that pressure is coming from above to stifle dissent. We must remember that some of the biggest supporters for this, or any, regime that stresses law and order or authoritarianism are within the police, military, and intelligence services. Racial bias in policing has been under increased scrutiny lately. Personally, I don’t think racial bias or violence has increased of late; more likely it has decreased since the 1960s and 70s. The difference is today the citizen can capture the truth on video and challenge the formerly unquestionable version presented by the police and courts. In theory this should empower citizens to place a check on untrammeled police power and arbitrary use of force. Instead, it challenges the role of the police in preserving public order and Enforcing the status quo, that is to say “keeping the poor and minorities in line.” This results in 14 a backlash from the police and their backers. Expect police and prosecutors to act with zeal if they get the green light to start using more repressive measures against protestors, especially those like Black Lives Matter who have been critical of their methods. If we are perhaps, slowly headed to a fascist police state, what stands in the way? Active resistance, perhaps? Already protests by anarchist and anti-fascist groups have put a damper on the newly empowered radical right. It’s my opinion, that this kind of active resistance is not only justified, it is a moral obligation. If more people had taken a stand against fascism in the '30s it would have never gotten off the ground. And the most effective way I can think of to prevent the radical right from moving to new extremes is to actively resist it. When anti-fascist protests confront the radical right, there is always a chorus of condemnation under the rubric of free speech. I would note that the people who speak up most loudly for free speech when the Nazis are on campus, are rarely to be found when anti-war or civil rights protestors are being tear gassed and arrested. This brings us back to 1977 and the Nazi March in Skokie, Illinois. The Illinois Nazis applied for a permit to hold a march in full Nazi regalia down the main Street of Skokie, a city with a large Jewish population, many of whom were Holocaust survivors. The city tried to deny their permit, and the ACLU famously sued to defend their right to free speech. Unpopular as it was at the time, this was the right thing to do. Historically, these repressive measures have mostly been used against the left, labor, and civil rights movements. It took the Nazi party marching to guarantee free speech for all groups outside the mainstream. A tradition has since emerged of Nazi and Klan groups marching with huge police escorts. In fact, when the Nazis marched in Skokie they were expected to face thousands of angry counterprotesters. Many brought baseball bats and motorcycle helmets and were ready to rumble. The Nazis chickened out and “relocated” their protest to the other side of town at the last minute. This episode was uproariously lampooned in the motion picture Blues Brothers. The other case to remember is the so- called Greensboro Massacre of 1979, where Communist Workers Party and civil rights protesters were gunned down by Klansmen and Nazi party members with police collusion, resulting in five deaths and many wounded. This is where the slogan “cops and Klan, hand in hand” originated, as it was shown that many of the Klansmen and Nazis were either off-duty police or police informants. I would be especially alert for activity of this type where non-state actors are used to intimidate protesters. Indeed, in one of the accomplices in the drive-by shooting against Black Lives Matter protesters here was a suburban police officer, who has since been forced to resign. Does the radical right have the right to free speech? Certainly. They also have the right to face the reaction for their provocative hate speech. When they advocate violence and extermination and give Nazi salutes, they have the right to answer for it in the kind of language they understand. The same methods they would use if the shoe was on the other foot. And I would note, the same methods their protectors in the police use on anti-war and civil rights protestors when they try to exercise the same free speech rights. Since the ’70s most of the domestic terrorism and violence in America has come from the radical right. Some of these groups are very well armed and organized. Many have as their goal provoking a race war that will result in the ethnic cleansing of America. This fantasy domes largely from their cult tome The Turner Diaries which maps out their race war and was a direct inspiration to the Oklahoma City bombers. These groups are working their way into the mainstream and are over represented in the military and law enforcement. They have cleaned up their act from the Skinhead and Klan Robe days and are recruiting internet trolls to their cause at an alarming rate. Keep your eyes and ears open in the coming months to what goes on in your community and be ready to act and resist. NO TREND—FOR THE FUN OF IT ALL There are songs that have lyrics that roll around in your head like a mantra. NO TREND’S “For The Fun Of It All,” off their 1983 Too Many Humans album is one such track. The lyrics are a litany of what I suppose could be considered navel-gazing, pondering life’s journeys, expressed in its most basic form— “What do you do, when you don't want to be alive and you don't want to be dead...What do you do?...What do you do when you're growing old but you want to stay young? What do you do?... What do you do? When you don't know what to do?” Minimalistic but saying so much, especially as I get older and, uh, ponder the meaning of life. 15 Ah, the getting old stuff—trying to stay relevant without coming across as some pathetic old guy. Still grappling with what you want to do with your life, when so many around you seem to have settled such things a long time ago. Or have they? Still, this column isn’t really about me (thank god, right?), but that song was the inspiration to write about a band that doesn’t always get as much mention as the “bigger names” of the era. The fact that their records have been out of print for decades, save for a posthumous release of their final album More might have something to do with that. And it’s unlikely they’ll be reissued anytime soon. In a thread on the Electrical Audio board, someone claims that Mentges “refuses to allow his early albums to be reissued, destroyed the master tapes, smashed all remaining copies of their albums, is a gun- toting conservative, and could give a rat’s ass about his ‘legacy.’” Mentges abandoned all musical pursuits following their demise and has rebuffed all interview requests. NO TREND were nasty and acerbic. The band’s original lineup drew heavily from FLIPPER and early PIL. A combination of loping basslines and barbed guitar that was one part Keith Levene, one part Ted Falconi, with mainly mid-paced, repetitive arrangements. It’s a pretty easy comparison that just about everyone has used when discussing the band, but it’s dead-on accurate. Some accused them of being a bit too derivative but, in some ways, it was more caustic than those bands. The axe-mangling from Frank Price (who sadly committed suicide in the late ’80s) was the key to the band’s sound (besides Mentges, of course). Hailing from Maryland, they were the anti-harDCore band. Steve Blush, who wrote American Hardcore and was the band’s manager for a few years, said, “they hated everyone and everything, their grinding PIL / FLIPPER onslaught constituted a complete fuck you to DC scene conformity. When I met ’em, they were shoving flyers that read ‘No Trend, No Scene, No Movement’ up all the Georgetown Coke machines frequented by the straightedge types.” That attitude was the basis for their demo track “Hanging Out In Georgetown,” which appeared on their Early Months collection of a 1983 demo session and live recordings. And their approach was a counterpoint to the rigid loud-fast-rules aesthetic of the hardcore bands. The thing is they did have a fondness and respect for Dischord and Ian MacKaye, according to Buck Parr, who played in a later lineup of the band. But they liked fucking with the audience. In an interview with Yellow Green Red webzine in 2010, Parr said, “When they came out, they were unapologetic in playing music that went distinctly against the grain of what passed for punk rock at that time in DC. Also, they would SNiAimoo COLUMNS COLUMNS COLUMNS razz and bait audiences present a generally unpleasant vibe; they’d take pokes at punks while operating within the punk rock scene.” It wasn’t just the DC hardcore crew that NO TREND aimed their barbs at, though. They reveled in being iconoclasts and provocateurs. Some people got it, some had a decidedly more negative reaction. The DC zine Truly Needy would have both positive and negative reviews in the same issue. One writer said, “To call them awful would be generous. I don’t think they could have been any worse... as a joke, I did not find NO TREND funny and, as a band, they were offending without being interesting.” Contrast that with another reviewer’s laudatory description of NO TREND as one of Washington’s more relevant bands. The review described Mentges as a combination of Don Rickies and Johnny Rotten and stated, “They are against anything that isn’t real in human emotion. If it’s not real, then it is to be made fun of.” That’s the essence of NO TREND. They called ’em as they saw ’em, viciously lampooning all sorts of conformist behavior— sucking it up, fitting in, knowing your place, without taking the time to ponder the meaningless of it. Work, procreate, consume, die. Songs like “Kiss Ass To Your Peer Group,” “Do As You’re Told,” and “Mindless Little Insects” expressed those sentiments in clipped, lyrical fragments. I was a bit late to the party for my appreciation of NO TREND. I remember hearing “Teen Love,” which got some college airplay on the local college stations—the track features Mentges basically reciting a narrative about two of the cool kids’ doomed relationship, ending in a tragic car accident, never getting a chance to achieve their career dreams. That’s over somber musical accompaniment, save a fifteen-second or so abrasive thrash burst in the middle. I became a fan in the mid-to-late ’80s when I finally decided to spin the copy of Too Many Humans that had been sitting for a few years in the punk section of the record store I worked at. The cacophony and anarchistic spirit were immediately appealing, particularly the tide track. Noisy, feedback¬ laden and, about 40 seconds in, Mentges starts to howl the song’s three lines—“too many FUCKING humans, you breed like rats, and you’re no FUCKING better. ” After having to deal with often-annoying customers, that was something that I and my coworkers felt! The tempo picks up into free-form atonality, then reverts back to the previous creepy-crawl. I used to work one evening shift a week and, when it was time to clear the store for closing, this record usually did the trick in short order. (I should mention that the wanton industrial clatter of the closing, twelve-minute suite on MINISTRY’S Twitch album did the job even more effectively). Of course, the record ended up in my collection and still gets a fair amount of play. I mentioned that some people did get what they were about.. .but then NO TREND would do a 180 and try something different. Mentges cast off the members of the original lineup and then brought in a series of different musicians, expanding the lineup to include keyboards, horns and strings on subsequent recordings, including some done with Lydia Lunch. Instead of punk, it was funkier and jazzier. He was always fucking with people’s conceptions and expectations right up to the end. Their final album More, originally rejected by their label at the time Touch and Go and finally released in 2001, features a seventeen-minute rock opera. It’s quite a way from “Teen Love.” Truth be told, they pretty much lose me after the releases with the original lineup (which also had a change in bassists and drummers during that time), save for the scathing “Two Minutes To Non-Existence,” which ‘ has the punk bile of the OG lineup, adding squawking, abrasive sax. That can be found on the compilation When Death Won’t Solve Your Problem which, of course, is out of print. That disc features a fair chunk of the band’s early output, including the ferocious “Mass Sterilization From Venereal Disease,” which originally appeared on the Teen Love ER It’s a shame NO TREND’S music isn’t readily available. Unless you want to pay crazy money for the originals, you’ll have to depend on often crappy-sounding downloads. That’s a damned shame, because it’s the ones who try to provoke people out of their complacency who encompass punk’s true spirit. NO TREND fell into that category. EVEN MORE FUN When one hears about a band getting back together for the first time in 40 years, it usually sets off alarm bells. They’re louder when the band had never recorded before. Well, you can silence those alarms because Product of America by the EXTERMINATORS is pretty good, for such a long-delayed debut. To make the story short, the band formed in Phoenix in 1977, contemporaries of the great (and also underrated) CONSUMERS but fell apart fairly quickly and members scattered into such units as the GERMS, BAGS, and FEEDERZ— drummer Don Bolles, who wrote the liner notes, was one of the members. Three of them return, with the late Rob Ritter replaced by Cris Kirkwood from the MEAT PUPPETS on bass. So what do you get from four guys in their late fifties? Some damned fine loud, rowdy punk. It may not have the rawness of ’77 and some of the leads are on the metallic side, but the attitude remains intact. That comes out for songs like “I Hate You,” “I Don’t Give A Fuck” and “Bionic Girl” (a song later done by the FEEDERZ). “Sometimes I Don’t Know” delves into thrash a bit. The closing songs for each side provide a change of pace—the brooding “Destruction Unit” and “Serena II,” a poem set to a mass of feedback that really doesn’t work. Otherwise, this is a roaring good time, (sloperecords.com) Three interconnected Pittsburgh (and environs) bands have new releases. CONCEALED BLADE unleash a barrage of throat-grabbing hardcore on their self-tided 12” on Beach Impediment. This wrecking crew were one of the best bands I saw last year. A speedy attack interspersed with some floor-pounding breakdowns. Not chuggy tough-guy hardcore, just a mean sound with guttural vocals and lyrics filled with plenty of rage and negativity. Sounds like fun, huh? BLOOD PRESSURE recendy put out a three-song demo for their Mexican tour with CONCEALED BLADE and it picks up where their album left off. Bruising, no- nonsense hardcore and few bands are doing it as well as they are these days. S.L.I.P., with three of the people from CONCEALED BLADE, offer something different from the other two bands on their Slippy When Wet album on Sorry State. A rockin’n’rollin’ concoction but not cock rock. This is something darker, along the lines of earlier ANNIHILATION TIME, punks scratching their rock itch. Twin-guitar riffing offering an arsenal of edgy, Ginn- inspired squalls. “There’s No Hope For The USA,” offers a bit of protest music for the New Dawn, a comment on “the perfect storm of human trash.” “Trend Setter” packs a whole lot of sarcastic snark for its tongue- in-cheek putdown of every stereotypical punk subgroup you can think of. (Beach Impediment, beachimpedimentrecords.com; Blood Pressure, bloodpressurepgh.bandcamp. com; Sorry State, sorrystaterecords.com) Another new Sorry State release is the first 12” release from DAVIDIANS, City Trends and it continues to expand on the band’s strongest qualities. Nervy, tension and release hardcore with an abundance of rhythmic complexity. There’s also a haunting guitar sound, eschewing power chords for something sinewy and sinister. Once again, a band that could fit into what I’ve been tagging “outsider hardcore”—a frayed ambiance, a sense of foreboding that doesn’t follow standard verse/chorus/verse structures. There’s also the willingness to experiment a bit, as with the minute or so of feedback damage bridging “Lousy With Hagar” and “Track Suit Glasses.” NASA SPACE UNIVERSE and BILL BONDSMEN are two bands that I’ve covered the past few years who bring in that sort of a vibe. Finally, Tom Potter has been kicking 16 around the Michigan music scene for years, having played in BANTAM ROOSTER, DIRTBOMBS and others and he’s put together a new band, BEASTEATER, with guys from BLOWTOPS and FATAL FIGURES, two loud Buffalo bands of note. Got all that? Their self-titled album provides plenty of loud, heavy, fuzzy riff-o-rama. Noisy, buzzy and boisterous and, yes, it’s got a garage rock pulse but it’s under a heavy cloud of distortion. More psycho than psychedelic and, to quote the lyrics on the lengthy \"I Eat Scum,” they really do sound like they’re about to lose their minds. Cool cover choice in SWELL MAPS’ “International Rescue,” which is given a good battering. PO Box 43, Peabody, MA 01960; subvox82@ gmail.com; sonicoverload.net New Year’s Eve 2016. Body stuttering for breath, adrift on a warm high, meters deep in a wikihole brought on by watching Australian network television throwback TV show known as Rage (I think its closest equivalent would be MTV 120 Minutes, except the amazing cultural hall of mirrors policy here means that they will automatically play anything submitted by an Australian band, a challenge I hereby accept.) So anyway, I was looking up stupid bands related to the Prodigy and happened upon a nineties punk-metal band with a bassist listed only as “Shop.” Wheezing, this reminded me I had always meant to collate my favorite punk names—easy proof that it’s no accident that the first three letters of punk are pun! We all need the arcane obtuse silly fucker mentality of punk more than ever, here are eight great punk names and their owners. Tell me yours. Des Truction: Drummer in New Zealand first wavers the Scavengers, who, as pretty much the only Auckland punks besides the Suburban Reptiles in 1977, went pretty hard with the punk names with such little competition, but look, only Des hit silly genius conceptual pay dirt. The rest of the band limply proffered, in reverse order of shitness: Johnny Volume, Ronnie Recent (Brendan Perry who’d go on to be one half of Dead Can Dance, no less) Mai Licious, and finally the drummer...“Mike Lezbian.” Come on mate. Best Scavengers song is “Mysterex.” Lydia Lunch: Just forever perfect, most quotable fuck up, perfect living relic of the old New York, truly true chaos punk, and in today’s context almost repellant and cringeworthy in so many ways, but only in ways that we all are but perhaps better train ourselves to hide. Seeing her speak these days always makes me wonder if these scenes I fetishize and idolize would have actually been absolute punisher hotbeds. Think about it. Still, with lines like this, how can you resist? “I may be putting my cock on the line here, but I think we need to go directly to the source and simply get rid of God. After all, God was the first cop.” Robert Gotobed: This always struck me as a hilarious name choice until I was informed it was not really a punk name but an actual real surname. What?! A medieval English one, apparendy, and thus spaketh the research: “Beds were such rare things in ancient times, that to have one, was a matter of local comment to the point where the person concerned was nhmed from this piece of furniture. Certainly early nicknames were bestowed for much less reason than this. However it also has to be said that the medieval period was renowned for its Chaucerian humor which was almost always direct, and often obscene. The first known nameholder was one John Gotobedde of Barnwell, Cambridge, in 1269.” Being sucked in again. Some years later I looked it up again and found out it technically is a punk name, given that his real name is Robert Grey...moral of the story never listen to your mates, always listen to Wire, ideally the first half of Pink Flag and the last half of Chairs Missing. Poly Styrene: Girl genius, purveyor of plastic future, the braces and the glory. Have you ever tried to do Poly karaoke? Legitimately impossible. Poly had frequent visions and was hospitalized several times, once with a schizophrenia diagnosis. She was hit over the heat with a baseball bat in Brixton as a child. She was run over by a fire engine which shattered her pelvis as an adult. She saw bright pink glowing UFOs in the skies. If there isn’t some Hare Krishna fan-fiction about Poly and Ray Cappo there should be. The ad she posted in Melody Maker (yes she initiated the band, yes it was her vision, yes yes yes) for bandmates read “‘young punx who want to stick it together.” Frank Discussion: The Feederz frontman is probably best known for wearing the corpse of a dead German Shepherd dog on stage at 924 Gilman. Slightly overdetermined situationist- wannabe antics put Frank and co. into a lineage with Crass and the KLF, but let’s be real, they didn’t quite have the tunes. Still, 17 better to go down in punk history for freaking out some squares with animal shelter off-cuts than not at all. Lance D’Boyle: Makes it in because I was touting this as a great unused Punk name until learning that of course, Lance played drums for the late great Vi Sub versa’s Poison Girls! Vi, who I’ll talk about here because I don’t know shit about Lance (other than his real name was Gary, but middle name Lance!) was born in 1935, which I am almost certain makes her the oldest punk from that era, but I would love to hear other contenders for that title: Lux Interior: I swear to god, it hadn’t occurred to me how many levels this name works on until I wrote it down. Quite possibly the apotheosis of punk names? Snake man. Blower of mics. Lux on Poison Ivy: “It’s hard to figure out how we’re different because we’re together all the time and we always do everything together. In a way it’s kind of one thing, me and her, but she’s also very much an individual and very strong. She grows like a tree. She’s faceted like a diamond. There’s a million sides to Ivy and I just love all of them.” Rev Volting: Of Rev Volting and the Backstabbers, a good example of making the most of a good name when you think of one. Sounds extra cool in a Glaswegian accent. British readers will be pleased to know Backstabbers bassist went on to appear in Scotsploitation sitcoms such as Rab C Nesbitt and Gary: Tank Commander. Looking up oP Rev got me on a massive Paisley punk tip (bands like XS Discharge, the Fegs, Defiant Pose) who put out a comp 7” called Ha! Ha! Funny Polis on their label... Groucho Marxist.. It cannot just be me who draws strength from such beautiful wordplay. You’re welcome, friends. *** Ha! Ha! Political Afterthought: So, things are quite...awful right now? A small favor if you will: check in with yourself if you find that you’re punishing people around you for not knowing everything you know, not quite being there yet with a certain specific slant of analysis of our current doom conditions. It’s a very common symptom of the type of pressure we are all under to visit the retribution we wish we could send to the palaces and the mansions onto would- be comrades instead. There is no excuse for scapegoatery in these fractious times, and it weakens me to watch that. The center cannot hold, of course, we figured as much. You, too, must not unravel with the world or there will be nothing left. We must be vigilant, deliberate and intensive about holding all of our selves SNIAimOO COLUMNS COLUMNS COLUMNS together. Use rope, tape, hands. I have installed a panic button on my internet browser when the rising panic in my chest that happens after a few minutes of scrolling starts to bite at my breathing. It’s called intotime.com (a piece by net artist Rafael Rozendaal) and— together with breathing—I highly recommend it. In such an atmosphere, I ponder, scrolling once again, is there anything more ill-founded than locating harm or hatred in places where what you have is a disagreement? Whether for a power kick or a fleeting sense of “own-back,” be wary. See, there’s a certain rhetorical universe-of projected righteousness that caught hold somewhere between the eras of folk punk and woke punk where the path to careful peace and learning got littered with snark grenades. It is not weak to acknowledge an apology even if you feel it to be imperfect. I’m so worried. Enabled by the internet and the ability we all have to rub our hands at public digital floggings, the gnarlier angels of some natures seem to zero in on anyone who can easy be perceived as a witch in our midst, for a slight or a misstep, so the pile on continues, a performance to exorcise the pent up powerlessness we all feel. Trouble is and it’s getting harder and harder to name this horrible reflex without sounding like you’re a shill for the dark side. All this just as the stakes get higher and higher, too. We can all fuck up, just as bullies exist in all walks of life, but scuttling in the corners feeding off another easy target call-out while the world burns? That is inexcusable. Of course, even me suggesting such a thing could have a cut-out response, I’m tone policing and in any case perhaps asking people to be less inexplicably cruel all the time so we can cast our blows more effectively on actual fucking Nazis is just respectability politics. Maybe so, but as someone who spends a stupid amount of time doing actual real talk accountability shit where there is often no clear path, right answer or simple conclusion, I feel kind of qualified to name this horrible sub-phenom for what it is, you know? One thing I am sure of is that we are going to need a bigger life raft, and if you cannot reach your arms out to those who don’t speak your pontificating vocabulary, the new utopia will bum before we even get there. I want to salvage all unintended pain and scoop us out of this weird hard world. Let’s be as critical of social capital as we are the other kind and be wary of easy targets. Nuance, like kindness, is a generative commodity. We need more and not less people on our side. i don't think that i need to sit here with you fucking dildos any more by Imogen Binnie Good news! I’m typing this column from the driver’s seat of my goddamn car on the side of the goddamn road twenty minutes from my goddamn house, all broken down in the winter. I guess the thermostat blew? I dunno, man. What do I know about cars? It feels nice that there is a relatively small scale concrete shitty thing happening in my life as I write this because at this point— winter 2017—what could an American even write that was not, to some degree, about the relatively large scale shitty things that are happening in this country? Gimme something small to worry about. Something I can handle. Something I can fucking do something about. Shit is already at the point where I’m like, what horrible things will have happened in the world between my car breaking down and my getting ahold of someone who has Triple A and can get my car towed? But the good news is that I’m pretty sure that smug irony is finally dead. Or at least in remission. But hopefully dead! Which rules! I was trying to remember whether it felt like this in 2000, the last time us dumb idiots elected a Republican, and I think one of the reasons I can’t remember whether it did or not is that I was a piece of shit back then. Like: even worse. Maybe that’s unfair to me? Probably not. I was in college, ostensibly a straight white cis dude, convinced that I could keep my straight white cis dude status intact by keeping “gender stuff” a secret forever, with “gender stuff” here meaning “staying up all night every night in incapacitating emotional pain (which had also started spilling out into the daytime) staring at a computer trying to figure out how to be trans while also not being trans, a system of self-awarenesses, self-denials and glaring blind spots toward self-awareness so complex that it would have exhausted me completely to maintain it even if I was getting any sleep.” And man, let me tell you: ostensibly being a straight white cis guy in America, believing that’s who you’re gonna be for the rest of your life, it’s awesome. I mean, nothing has to fucking matter to you. You just do whatever and the culture you grew up in gives you a thousand ways to rationalize it so that whether it is successful or not, whether it is self-indulgent or not, you can, frame yourself basically as a hero for doing it. There would be no direct consequences on the election of that fake cowboy idiot on my life. I could care if I wanted—go to protests or whatever—but literally anything I did beyond having a self-righteous opinion was, like, above and beyond. Combine that with a dawning awareness that I wasn’t going to be able to maintain this status forever and its accompanying insecurity eating its way out from my skeleton, and what you get is someone who’s maybe not a reliable narrator about that era. You know? I mean I remember it being scary and I did go to protests and stuff when they announced that we’d be having a war or wars. I was a “don’t” in Vice for having too much anti-Bush / anti¬ war shit on my messenger bag. I remember that things were pretty shitty. But did things feel the same kind of ominously weird as they do now? I don’t know. Maybe. It’s hard to compare. I mean, you know the thing about how the internet is a river of garbage that we all keep dunking our heads into a couple hundred times a day because once or twice a week you find a quarter? The garbage river has become a torrent of damned humans melting disgustingly and yelling “you are going to die really soon.” It’s not fun or helpful. I had to take Twitter off my phone. But did Livejoumal feel like this? I think it didn’t. But it’s frustrating how different a place I was in at the time and therefore how hard it is to compare them. *** We’ve been waiting for irony to die for a long time, right? Cool smug irony is death and a million years ago, when I was read as and struggling to be a cool white cis guy, it was all I had in my veins. No blood. “Fuck blood,” I probably said ironically. And I’m not trying to brag like I’ve divested myself of it completely. I just...I think that I’ve been moving toward something better? And that a lot of us have. I know that me and a bunch of other queer jerks spent a lot of time under Obama— our last Democrat president, maybe you remember him—being cruel to other queers whose politics or analyses weren’t as good as our own? Like vicious mockery and dismissal. I remember Julie Blair talking up some obnoxious queers-baiting-queers thing some homo had written for prettyqueer.com, saying “the only way to win is not to play;” I remember arguing that judgmental disdain was a great way to show people that their thinking was shallow and stupid. I think that what I’m really writing about here, besides a Catalogue Of The Kinds Of Assholes I’ve Been, is the backdrop against which we do our work and what that backdrop does to that work. I mean, I don’t know anything about any of this, I’m just hotboxing a broken car on the side of the road in the 18 snow, hoping that our president doesn't make it illegal for trans people to be trans anymore and talking shit, but I guess my thought is that the stakes were different for doing lefty / progressive / anarchist work under a president who was nominally progressive or on the left (whatever arbitrary value “left” might have in mainstream American politics) from what they are under a blatant authoritarian right-wing puppet of global capital and the American right. You know? I feel like there's been this hard shift toward very earnest modes of communication and protest and action. People going to airports with signs. Teenagers in little towns in New England holding Fuck Trump rallies every Sunday on the traffic circle in the middle of town. (Hi, Brattleboro.) That kind of stuff. I know that it's really different for different people, that a lot of people of color, for example, have been pretty unsurprised that America took this opportunity to make its subtext (white supremacy and its friends) into text. I'm not talking about being surprised or unsurprised by this as much as I’m thinking about what people are doing with this feeling that we've got to do something. You know? Although now that I'm thinking about it, I’m also thinking about the Movement for Black Lives—probably the most important thing that’s happened in America in the last couple years—and how it's not really that big on irony or smugness, either. Maybe, in the end, as happens so often, what I'm talking about really does boil down to the toxicity of whiteness. Maybe I’m just calling out myself here. I feel like maybe I was kind of complacent under Obama. I think I thought I was doing a good job and I think I really couldn’t see how complacent I'd gotten. I mean I did stuff and talked about stuff, but I think in retrospect most stuff (queer stuff, race stuff, critical analysis, the sense we make of class in America) felt to me like it was...if not moving forward, then at least not moving backward. So it felt like we could just chill out and do our thing and stuff wouldn't collapse any worse than it already was. Like a lot of people who worry, I've been reading Rebecca Solnit’s book Hope In The Dark, and a point that she keeps coming back to is that when you look at history, it seems like this static, inevitable thing, but that’s not how it looks from the other side, from before things happen. Nothing is ever inevitable. You do stuff—you commit to things—and you hope they'll work out. People who try to change things are never assured that then will. We spend a lot of time thinking “It might not work.” But the thing that I think we need to remember—which is bolstered by earnestness and hamstrung by irony—is that it might. She also writes about this other thing, which is that you don’t have to be a highly visible reality TV star for your ideas to blow up and take over. Radical ideas start in the margins and make their way into the mainstream and then get retconned, with the passage of time, to look like they’ve always been at the center. And look: our ideas are better. “White people are better than other people?” “Trickle down economics,” or whatever the fuck the 2017 version of that is? These things are demonstrably stupid. Whereas “capitalism produces inequality,” or “patriarchy is bad for everyone”—not only are these things true, but they explain things. They make this mess make sense, whereas racist scapegoating, for example, does the exact fucking opposite. So yeah. Now that Mike Pence wants it to be illegal again, gay marriage suddenly doesn't seem quite so embarrassingly bourge. I’m a social worker who can barely repair her car again. My mom, a nice middle class white lady, is reading about the Zapatistas. Tliis smug irony stuff, I don't want it anymore and it feels like a lot of other people don't want it anymore, either, which is great. Some assholes on the right have definitely picked up the smug irony ball and started running with it, and you know what? Good. Fuck them. They can have it. We've got something better—we've got a lot of things that are way better—and here in Donald Trump's America, I've got the motherfucking optimism. Let's do stuff. And let's mean it.
