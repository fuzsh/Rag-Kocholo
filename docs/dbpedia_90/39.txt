In 1986 Black Flag hit the road for six months promoting their most recent album, In My Head. Along for the ride were two other SST bands, Gone (a Greg Ginn side project) and Painted Willie, a band that had filmmaker David Markey (Desperate Teenage Lovedolls, 1991: The Year Punk Broke, My Career as a Jerk) on drums. Markey’s documentary, Reality 86’d is an interesting chronicle of Black Flag’s dysfunctional last hurrah and, nearly 30 years later, a fascinating look at America’s alternative music scene in the years before Nirvana blew it all out of the water.

For reasons known only to Ginn, he has obstructed every effort Markey has made to show the film. Markey and others have posted it on Youtube a numerous times, but Ginn keeps on having it taken down. At the moment, there seem to be a couple of versions available. Watch it.
