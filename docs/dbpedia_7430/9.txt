Freakazoid!

Spielberg's Role: Executive Producer

US Release Date: 1995

In the tradition of Tiny Toons, Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain, Steven Spielberg has put his name on yet another great animated series. Steven Spielberg Presents Freakazoid is a fast paced animated action comedy. It is done very well and is worth checking out. You will have to watch an episode to understand.

Dexter Douglas is a teen aged computer geek who was absorbed into the Internet by a faulty processor. (I know, it sounds stupid) The result is a barley controllable super hero alter ego.
