        "text": "Aardman Animations\n\nAardman Animations (est. 1972) is a British animation studio that uses claymation (clay animation) in most of its films. Their most famous early characters are Wallace and Gromit, an eccentric British inventor and his dog.\n\nIn addition to their short films about Wallace and Gromit, they have made several famous feature films:\n\nHIT Entertainment / Mattel Creations\n\nHIT Entertainment was formed in 1982 by Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets puppets used in Sesame Street, and two British media producers. It was previously known as Henson International Television (also known as HiT or hit!) but the shorter name HIT was used after Henson left the company. The company was purchased by Mattel in 2011 and became Mattel Creations in 2016. During its tenure, it produced several popular animated children’s shows, including:\n\nDisney\n\nDisney (est. 1923) is one of the Big Five film studios in America. It has changed its name slightly over time, but is always represented by its first popular cartoon character, Mickey Mouse. Mickey and his companions Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, and Goofy continue to appear in Disney comics, TV shows, and movies. Their ongoing popularity shows the longevity of animal characters.\n\nAnimals have played major roles in many Disney films, including:\n\nFor some people, Disney animated movies have become associated with “princess movies” because of the many princess fairy tales that they have adapted, including:\n\nPixar\n\nPixar (est. 1979) started as a part of Lucasfilm after some animators split off from Disney. In 1986, it became a separate corporation when the division was bought by Apple founder Steve Jobs, who became its majority owner. They started producing computer-animated films, which Disney distributed, when the technology became possible in the 1990s. Pixar was purchased by Disney in 2006, so its movies are now part of Disney. During its independent years, it started the following stories:\n\nSullivan Bluth Ltd. / Amblin Entertainment\n\nSullivan Bluth Ltd. started in 1979 as Don Bluth Productions when Don Bluth, John Pomeroy, Gary Goldman, and eight other animators left Disney due to creative differences. After a few difficult years, the studio reformed in 1985 as Sullivan Bluth Studios with the financial support and advice of the businessman Morris Sullivan. The company soon began a creative partnership with Amblin Entertainment (the company of the famous director Steven Spielberg) and produced several successful animated films. For several years, the company worked in the USA and in Ireland. In 1992, the company lost major financial support after poor performance from its latest movies. With new financial support, the company completed the three films that it had already developed substantially, then Bluth and Goldman went to work at Fox Animation Studios.\n\n20th Century Fox Animation / Blue Sky Studios\n\n20th Century Fox Animation (est. 1994) was a part of 20th Century Fox. In 1994, after the success of their first 7 animated films, including FernGully: The Last Rainforest, the Fox studio hired animation expert Don Bluth to work in its new animation department. They produced the movie Anastasia (1998), which was a great success, but their next movie, Titan A.E., was not successful.\n\nHowever, 20th Century Fox had another animation studio, Blue Sky Studios, which produced several successful stories, including:\n\nComcast\n\nDreamworks Animation\n\nDreamworks Animation (est. 1994) is a subsidiary (子会社) of Universal Pictures, which is a subsidiary of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast. It was founded when Disney board member Katzenberg split from Disney in 1994 due to tensions about the choice of new leadership. Co-founder Steven Spielberg brought in Amblimation, which was a London-based subsidiary of Amblin Entertainment that had split from Don Bluth due to “creative differences”. Films produced by DreamWorks Animation were originally distributed by DreamWorks Pictures from 1998 to 2005, then by Paramount Pictures from 2006 to 2012 and 20th Century Fox from 2013 to 2017. Now, they are distributed by Universal Pictures.\n\nScholastic\n\nScholastic Corporation (est. 1920) started as a publisher of youth magazines. It is now a major publishing company in the United States, focusing its brand on youth and education materials. It started a media division in 1995, producing animated films and TV based on some of its popular children’s book series. Popular adaptations include:\n\nWarner Brothers\n\nWarner Brothers (est. 1926) is one of the Big Five film studios in America. It has changed its name slightly over time and now has two divisions of animation (cartoons and animated movies), but it started producing cartoon shorts, called “Looney Tunes” and “Merrie Melodies”, for movie theaters and television in 1930.\n\nHanna-Barbera\n\nHanna-Barbera (est. 1957) produced animated shows that were appropriate for all ages, but designed for children. After the death of one of their founders, the company became part of Warner Brothers. Hanna Barbera’s show titles changed regularly, but their most popular characters appeared in many of their shows. Here are some of their famous shows:\n\nCartoon Network\n\nCartoon Network (est. 1994) started as a part of the Hanna-Barbera production company, but became part of Warner Brothers. Here are some of its famous shows:\n\nAdult Swim\n\nAdult Swim (est. 2001) is a part of the Cartoon Network, but has separate audiences and ratings. Following the standard for more violent, crude, or sexual content on American television, Adult Swim shows are broadcast on TV late at night, when young viewers are not watching television. Adult Swim shows are animated, but not for children. Here are some of its famous shows:\n\nViacom CBS\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nParamount Pictures (est. 1912) is the second-oldest film studio in the USA (after Universal Pictures). It is the only member of the Big Five film studios in America to still be located within the Los Angeles city limits. Most of its productions were live action movies; however, it had several popular animations. In 1928, Paramount began releasing Inkwell Imps, animated cartoons produced by Max and Dave Fleischer’s Fleischer Studios in New York City. The Fleischers were highly experienced in the animation industry; many even saw them as talented competition to Walt Disney. The Fleischers animated several iconic characters, including:\n\nNickelodeon\n\nNickelodeon (est. 1979) is owned by ViacomCBS and is available through cable subscription. It was the first American television channel designed specifically for children. Here are some of its animated shows:\n\nComedy Central\n\nComedy Central (est. 1991) started as a part of WarnerMedia, but is now owned by ViacomCBS. Their programming includes, in their words, “stand-up specials, sketch shows, adult animation, late-night programming and more.” Comedy Central is less focused on animation, but it has some famous and popular animated shows for adults, including:\n\nMTV\n\nAlso part of ViacomCBS, MTV (est. 1981) started as a TV channel for showcasing live musician performances and music videos. (MTV means “music television”.) However, MTV added live and animated television shows in the early 1990s. Some of their popular animated shows include:"
