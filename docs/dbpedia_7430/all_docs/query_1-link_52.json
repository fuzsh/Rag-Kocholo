As they plot new plans and embellish them in their own wacky\n\nway, they unwittingly and continually sabotage their best attempts. But,\n\nboth Pinky and The Brain are serious and dedicated to their cause. They\n\nknow full well that someday their ambitions will be realized. As they\n\nescape from their cage each week and venture forth from ACME Laboratories\n\nit becomes more and more evident just how serious these two really are.\n\nIf The Brain disguises himself as infamous gangster Jimmy Hoffa will he\n\nearn access to the nation's military-industrial complex and, in turn, be\n\nable to finally take over the world? Can The Brain design dentures that\n\ngive him the charismatic smile that leads to a starring role in a\n\ntelevision sitcom enabling him to seduce the mass public into believing\n\neverything he says and does? Will securing all the world's livable space\n\nabove the 39th floor, and then plotting to melt the polar ice caps,\n\nflooding Earth up to the 39th floor, make Pinky & The Brain finally realize\n\ntheir goal? Will all of these new plots actually bring them that much\n\ncloser to making their dream a reality?\n\nWith each and every plan Pinky and The Brain are always out of luck.\n\nSomehow there is always a major piece of logic missing and their schemes\n\nbackfire time and time again, leaving both mice caught in their own trap.\n\nIn the end, they always return to their homebase at ACME labs where they\n\nplot their activity for the next night trying to take over the world.\n\n\"Pinky and The Brain are my personal favorites,\" said executive producer\n\nSteven Spielberg. \"They aspired to have their own television series after\n\nserving in the capacity of 'guest stars' in 'Animaniacs.' So, last year we\n\ngave it a try and to our amazement they were successful. After all, as two\n\nlaboratory mice intent on taking over the world, Pinky and The Brain\n\nbelieve that starring in their own series is their manifest destiny.\"\n\nTwo extremely talented voice-over artists bring life to these inseparable\n\nrodents. Rob Paulsen (\"Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs,\" \"Teenage\n\nMutant Ninja Turtles\") portrays the gangly-toothed, optimistic, though\n\nslightly dimwitted Pinky. Maurice LaMarche (\"Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny\n\nToon Adventures,\" \"Taz-Mania\") plays the monotone, highly intelligent and\n\nunderstated The Brain.\n\n\"Steven Spielberg Presents Pinky & The Brain,\" executive produced by Steven\n\nSpielberg and Amblin Entertainment, is produced and animated by Warner\n\nBros. Television Animation, under the creative supervision of senior\n\nproducer Tom Ruegger and producer Rusty Mills, for Kids' WB!, The WB\n\nTelevision Network's children's programming service.\n\nThe two laboratory mice with what Shakespeare would have termed \"vaulting\n\nambition which o'er leaps itself.\" They are cage mates that have teamed up\n\nin their common pursuit of taking over the world -- if they can only get\n\nout of the lab. No matter how hard they try, success always seems to elude them.\n\nPinky is a gangling guy with funny teeth and an optimistic outlook. He's\n\nboisterous and energetic with a staccato laugh and an inane imagination.\n\nPinky's speech is littered with odd exclamations -- \"Egad!\" \"Narf!\"\n\n\"Clong!\" \"Ppoit\" \"Splonk!\" \"Zort!\" -- kind of emotional sound effects. He\n\nis extremely optimistic and would probably be a victim of spontaneous\n\ncombustion if he didn't have The Brain to bring him back to earth.\n\nThe Brain, on the other hand, has an oversized forehead to fit his\n\noversized cerebellum, pursed mouth, shrouded eyes, and speaks in a somber\n\nwhispered monotone. He often speaks so quietly, in fact, Pinky must lean in\n\nclose, his hand cupped to his ear in order to hear The Brain's latest\n\nscheme. (It's funny how the audience has no problem hearing The Brain.) The\n\nBrain has super intelligence, has the gift of understatement and knows that\n\nhe would accomplish nothing without the enthusiasm of his loyal companion, Pinky.\n\nYes, Pinky and The Brain are a dynamic team that are virtually inseparable!\n\nROB PAULSEN\n\n(The Voice of \"Pinky\")\n\nRob Paulsen can be heard as the voice of several extremely popular cartoon\n\ncharacters. Currently, he serves as the voice of Yakko in \"Steven Spielberg\n\nPresents Animaniacs\" and as Pinky in both \"Steven Spielberg Presents\n\nAnimaniacs\" and the new animated series \"Steven Spielberg Presents Pinky &\n\nThe Brain.\" Additionally, Paulsen is the lead character in the CBS Fall\n\n1995 animated series \"The Mask,\" Arthur in \"The Tick,\" Raphael on the\n\npopular \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" animated strip, Throttle in the\n\nanimated show \"Biker Mice From Mars,\" Antoine on \"Sonic the Hedgehog,\" Max\n\nin the new animated series \"Mighty Max\" and Squishington in the new\n\nstop-motion program \"Bump in the Night.\" He also voices several other\n\nWarner Bros. characters on \"Taz-mania\" and \"Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny\n\nToon Adventures.\"\n\nPaulsen has had on-camera roles in numerous motion pictures, including\n\n\"Body Double,\" \"Eyes of Fire,\" \"The Perfect Match\" and \"Warlock.\" His\n\ntelevision acting credits include guest-starring roles on \"MacGyver\" and \"St. Elsewhere.\"\n\nMAURICE LaMARCHE\n\n(The Voice of \"The Brain\")\n\nVoted \"Most Likely to be Someone Else\" by his Toronto high school classmates,\n\nMaurice LaMarche has been doing comedy and impressions since his childhood.\n\nLaMarche has performed at comedy clubs throughout the country and has\n\nappeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show,\" \"An Evening at the Improv\" and \"Rodney\n\nDangerfield's Young Comedian's Special\" on HBO. Additionally, he has served\n\nas the opening act for performers such as Rodney Dangerfield, George\n\nCarlin, The Temptations and The Four Tops.\n\nAs a cartoon voice-over artist, LaMarche can also be heard in the role of\n\nThe Brain on the already popular \"Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs,\" a\n\npart which he continues to portray on the new half-hour series \"Steven\n\nSpielberg Presents Pinky & The Brain.\" Other series which LaMarche voices\n\nin are: \"The Critic,\" \"The Real Ghostbusters,\" \"The Tick,\" \"Duckman,\"\n\n\"Steven Spielberg Presents Freakazoid!\" and \"Beethoven.\" And, in the\n\ncommercial world, LaMarche is the well-known bird, Toucan Sam, for\n\nKellogg's Fruit Loops.\n\nLaMarche is only the third person in history, and the second in the last 50\n\nyears, to be used as the official voice of Popeye.\n\nThere are some pics from previous episodes below - they shouldn't take long to load\n\nNARF !\n\nhttp://members.aol.com/vopfirsch/yellow.htm\n\nThe official site is located at ... http://www.wbanimation.com/\n\nLegal Notice: \"Pinky and The Brain\" copyright is owned by Steven Spielberg, the artists and their related companies.
