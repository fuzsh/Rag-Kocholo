        "text": "The wacky world of Animaniacs is being unleashed again.\n\nThe wildly popular, award-winning family cartoon, which first debuted in 1993, will return for two new seasons to the streaming network Hulu in 2020 with executive producer Steven Spielberg, Hulu announced Thursday.\n\nThe classic sibling characters — Yakko, Wakko and sister Dot — wreak havoc and mayhem in the lives of everyone they meet. The trio have been locked away in the Warner Bros. Studio water tower for ages, but escape every day, making the world into their personal playground.\n\nMore: While Netflix hikes, Hulu drops price for its entry-level plan\n\nMore: Steven Spielberg on timely 'The Post': 'Sometimes history is best viewed through a lens'\n\nFan-favorite characters Pinky and the Brain will also return to make appearances in each new episode. The series marks the first Hulu original series made for families.\n\nThe deal with Hulu and Warner Bros. also brings the complete libraries of all 99 episodes of the original Animaniacs — as well as Pinky and the Brain, the subsequent Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain and the complete Tiny Toon Adventures collection — to Hulu starting immediately.\n\n“I am so pleased and proud that Animaniacs will have a home at Hulu,” said Spielberg in a statement. \"We look to bring new audiences and longtime fans into this wild world of Yakko, Wakko and Dot.\""
