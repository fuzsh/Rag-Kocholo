        "text": "Freakazoid!\n\nSpielberg's Role: Executive Producer\n\nUS Release Date: 1995\n\nIn the tradition of Tiny Toons, Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain, Steven Spielberg has put his name on yet another great animated series. Steven Spielberg Presents Freakazoid is a fast paced animated action comedy. It is done very well and is worth checking out. You will have to watch an episode to understand.\n\nDexter Douglas is a teen aged computer geek who was absorbed into the Internet by a faulty processor. (I know, it sounds stupid) The result is a barley controllable super hero alter ego."
