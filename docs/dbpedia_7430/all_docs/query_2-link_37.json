        "text": "He’s pretty good, eh?\n\nI mean, I know some people hate his sentimentality, his earnestness, and his (perceived) on the nose emotional manipulation, but there is no other director, living or dead, that has had the success this guy has, and with good reason.\n\nSpielberg is prolific beyond all measure, and has made some of the most popular films of all time. It would be easy for me to fill half a top ten list of favourite films with just his output if I didn’t make a rule for myself that such a list can only include one film from a director. That being said, my favourite is and always has been Raiders of the Lost Ark. But aside from such crowd pleasing popcorn fare as that, Spielberg has tackled multiple genres, and generally works hard to advance and develop his skills. He’s not a man with a light touch, but he doesn’t have to be: his conception of cinema is rooted in the grand, Old Hollywood tradition, with a “swinging for the rafters” kind of commitment to wowing the audience. He was a child that absorbed cinema, and nobody else has ever used that visual language as effectively as him. Spielberg is pure instinct, and more often than not, that instinct is dead-on.\n\nSo, some questions to consider:\n\nWhat is your favourite Spielberg film?\n\nWhat is his best film? (This can be different from your favourite)\n\nWhat type of project do you think he should tackle that he hasn’t already?\n\nWhat is your favourite era of his career?\n\nAlso, if you are so inclined, the mothership has an inventory of his 25 greatest set-pieces.
