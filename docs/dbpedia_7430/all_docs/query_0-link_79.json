        "text": "\"I wanted to be involved with the realization of some new characters, for the '90s and into the next century.\" -Steven Spielberg-\n\nAnimaniacs is a Spin-off of Tiny Toon Adventures. Produced by Warner Brothers this cartoon is about (from top to bottom) Yakko, Wakko and Dot. Together these characters ARE the Warner Brothers (and their sister Dot).\n\nWhat are the Warner Brothers? I don't know either, but they have written a song about it called \"What are We?\", which was released on one of two albums. The Warner Brothers use puns, slap stick and a lot of 1930's humor to keep both young and older audiences tuned in. The only plot to speak of is that they don't like to be locked in the water tower (and who would), so they run from a security guard while driving their shrink insane and drooling over a nurse. (HELLLOOOOO NURSE!)\n\nAlong with Yakko, Wakko and Dot, Animaniacs features several other sets of characters. Pinky and the Brain, two lab mice who try to take over the world, became popular so fast they had to be given their own show. Meanwhile, Little Mindy gets into all kinds of trouble while her baby-sitting dog, Buttons, tries to rescue her. The Goodfeathers are a group of gangster pigeons, who seem to mimic the Godfather movies. Slappy the squirrel shows her young one the ins and outs of being a cartoon hero. And finally there is Rita and Runt, who make up a Laurel and Hardy combination while roaming the streets."
