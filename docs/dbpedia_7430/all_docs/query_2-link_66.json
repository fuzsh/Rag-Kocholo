        "text": "I think Paul Fusco was trying to work that out a good five or so years ago; it would appear nothing came of that.\n\nI never got into the Alf animated series; I think a big part of the character is a Muppet-esque \"in camera\" puppet effect. So if they ever tried to reboot Alf in some fashion, they should stick to live action.\n\nI also think Alf getting much of a reboot isn't likely simply because it hasn't ever hit quite that nostalgic-pop culture-critical mass the way other stuff from certain eras has. For instance, Fusco hasn't merchandised much of anything of Alf in all of these years. You'd think a Funko Pop figure or something like that would be a no-brainer.\n\nI think, in this moment in time, a CGI Alf movie would tank. A live action movie wouldn't do a ton better; but I think if they marketed it right and kept it at a low budget, they could so something really cool either as a film or a short-run Netflix sort of thing. They'd probably, for better or worse, have to go relatively \"meta\" with any Alf project rather than trying to simply make it a continuation of the TV show.\n\nA WB exec told me around 1993-94 that Animaniacs was a financial disaster for the studio: they lost money on every episode they made, because Spielberg often came in at the last minute and requested massive changes. I think the guy told me that Spielberg had them go back and rewrite and (partially) reshoot the first 10 episodes, which cost well over a million bucks alone. I think it's still the most costly TV animated show ever made.\n\nI wonder if Spielberg will take as much of a role in involving himself in the day to day as he did 25 years ago.\n\nI think John Kricfalusi is a very creative guy, but he's known to be temperamental and very difficult. The story on how and why he was fired from Ren & Stimpy is pretty well documented. Howard Stern had him on as a guest about 20 years ago, and he was very bitter and angry about the whole thing -- and also verbally beat-up voice actor Billy West, who had stayed on the show and taken on the voice of Ren (formerly done by Kricfalusi) in addition to the other voices he did. It was a very tense, awkward interview.\n\nI'm very sympathetic to Kricfalusi because I think he's a bright, creative guy, but I also see that TV is a business, and you gotta finish the shows on-time and on-budget. Especially a modest-budget cable show.\n\nI adore this show have it all on dvd I could careless about how much money it lost..\n\nThere is one Episode called Broadcast Nuisance which was reshot and some scenes\n\nwere deleted I seen it youtube it's so funny and mean spirited I love it..\n\nAnimaniacs won 8 day time emmys so cost of that show\n\nreally means very little to fans..\n\nI have the original guide sheets to all characters and some characters not used in the\n\nshow"
