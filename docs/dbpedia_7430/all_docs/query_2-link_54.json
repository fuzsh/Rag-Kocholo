        "text": "Lucky Bob said:\n\nJust as a side note, Histeria poked fun at Mike Tyson, the Spice Girls, and the senior Pres. Bush. And it was the last of the great WBA shows. So, the jokes weren't entirely lost.\n\nCarry on.\n\nHmm...I dunno about it being a \"great\" WBA show, but I definitely missed them poking fun at them, considering H! tended to lose its audience as the weeks went by... By my count, it was the shortest lived WBA show ever. Although EP&tB would be a close 2nd in short lived...but at least they got to make fun of Hanson. Talented trio yes...but Mmmbop was kinda like nails on the chalkboard when played every day, every hour....eesh.\n\nBy the way, does anyone remember the Theme song to the short lived Plucky Duck Show. There was a good idea . Lets take old shorts of Plucky from Tiny Toon's, make it into a new show with only one new episode. Well it did work for Pinky and The Brain, however they had more then one new episode. And they mixed new shorts with the old ones.\n\nFidgitStyles said:\n\nBy the way, does anyone remember the Theme song to the short lived Plucky Duck Show.\n\nHere are the lyrics, courtesy of alt.tv.tinytoon:\n\n[You're lucky, it's Plucky,\n\n\"I'm absolutely ducky,\"\n\nOther shows seem yucky now that Plucky's on the air!\n\n\"I'm wacky, I'm quacky,\"\n\nHe's an egomaniac-y,\n\nHamton plays the lackey of this duck extraordinaire!\n\nWho knows the way to close his endless babbling beak?\n\nDrop an anvil down upon his feathery physique!\n\nToast him, roast him, the show will still be most him,\n\n\"It's THE PLUCKY DUCK SHOW and it's on each week!\"\n\nHis antics are frantic, at times he gets romantic,\n\n\"My talent's so gigantic it'll burst from your TV!\"\n\nThe writers are hackers, the artists all went crackers,\n\nThe actors are yakkers,\n\n\"But don't complain -- it's free!\"\n\nPlucky goes to Acme Loo to learn to be a star,\n\nThere're other toonsters at the school,\n\n\"But who cares who they are ...\"\n\nSo enjoy, don't be coy,\n\nAnd don't fall for a decoy,\n\nIt's THE PLUCKY DUCK SHOW, come and laugh along!\n\n... \"I also wrote this song!\"]\n\nI only saw a couple episodes of the spin-off, but it's sorta like the Wayne Brady Show- without the rest of the Whose Line members, it's a bit much. Same with Plucky; he's great when he's on Tiny Toons, but having his own show... it's a bit too much Plucky. He's my favorite TTA character, but you've GOT to vary it.\n\nIf they didn't want him anymore, then they should have released DVDs of A!, PatB, and Freakazoid![/QUOTE]\n\nFor Real! They really need to release these great classic WB shows on DVD! And I know i'm in the minority here, but I liked \"Histeria!\" Every week was something new, and it was hilarious! I miss this show. And I would LOVE to see \"Freakazoid!\" on DVD!\n\nI still want to know why Spielberg still had the power to yank the shows off of CN and put them back on Nick. I know CN didn't give them good time slots, but it seems neither did Nick when they went back there.\n\nWell, after all, this is one of the people who tried to hold on on DVD in favor of Divx!\n\nEric B said:\n\nI still want to know why Spielberg still had the power to yank the shows off of CN and put them back on Nick. I know CN didn't give them good time slots, but it seems neither did Nick when they went back there.\n\nTrue. Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs Steven \"presented\" were done by\n\nthe crew of Warner Brothers (The company, not Yakko and Wakko) along with\n\nPinky & The Brian (later Pinky, Elmira And The Brian). AOL-Time Warner is the parent company of Cartoon Network, which should be their home. Nick gives them morning time slots prior to kids going to school. So did Cartoon Network. One dissapointment with the ones running on Nick is that they been in that morning time slot (6-7 a.m.) for a year (I Think). And kids are not in school during the summer."
