        "text": "Hulu, Amblin Television and Warner Bros. Animation today announced a new deal to create and premiere a new version of the iconic family-friendly cartoon franchise \"Animaniacs.\"\n\nUnder the two-season straight-to-series order, Steven Spielberg will return as executive producer of the animated series, with Sam Register, president of Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series, and Amblin Television Co-Presidents Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank also serving as executive producers, according to a news release.\n\nThe series marks the first Hulu Original made for families, and with the legacy of these beloved characters, is intended to provide a viewing opportunity and experience for families to enjoy together.\n\nNew episodes are set to premiere on the premium streaming service in 2020, according to the release.\n\n“We cannot wait to work with Steven Spielberg and the entire Amblin and Warner Bros. teams to bring more sketches, catchphrases, songs and laughs from the Animaniacs to kids and adults everywhere,” said Craig Erwich, senior vice president of content for Hulu, in a statement. “Now one of the most beloved, inventive and funny animated franchises in history, 'Animaniacs' and its cast of witty characters can live on, on Hulu. This marks yet another big move for us as we continue our efforts to be the No. 1 streaming destination for premium animated content.”\n\nThe Warner brothers, Yakko and Wakko, and the Warner sister, Dot — three inseparable, irascible siblings — have a great time wreaking havoc and mayhem in the lives of everyone they meet. They have been locked away in the Warner Bros. water tower for a very long time, but they have found a way to escape. And escape they do — every day. Causing chaos and comic confusion, Yakko, Wakko and Dot run loose in the city, turning the world into their personal playground.\n\nFan-favorite characters Pinky and the Brain -- a pair of genetically altered lab mice who plot to take over the world -- will also return to make appearances in each episode, according to the release.\n\n“Yakko, Wakko and Dot have been waiting impatiently inside the water tower, and now their hilarious brand of animated chaos will be unleashed — again! We’re incredibly excited to be partnering with Amblin and Hulu for new episodes of Animaniacs, filled with endless laughs — and ongoing plots for world domination by Pinky and the Brain,” said Register in a statement. “Parents who grew up with the cartoon now have new episodes to share with their own families.”\n\nIn addition to announcing the new series, Hulu and Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution inked a new pact that makes Hulu the exclusive streaming home to the complete library of all 99 episodes of the original \"Animaniacs,\" as well as \"Pinky and the Brain,\" the subsequent \"Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain,\" and the complete \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" collection. As of today, Hulu subscribers can watch, catch up and relive their favorite moments from the original series.\n\n“I am so pleased and proud that 'Animaniacs' will have a home at Hulu,” said Spielberg in a statement. “Together with Warner Bros., we look to bring new audiences and longtime fans into this wild world of Yakko, Wakko, and Dot. I am also excited that the full library of 'Animaniacs' and 'Tiny Toon Adventures' episodes are included in the deal.”\n\nThe original \"Animaniacs\" made its television debut in 1993 and went on to become one of the most popular animated series for children. Since its premiere, the series has launched spin-offs and characters including \"Pinky and the Brain,\" and has set the record for most Daytime Emmy Awards in the field of Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition for any animated series, winning three times.\n\nWith its balance of humor, education and pop culture references, \"Animaniacs\" also garnered a large adult fan following. Award-winning songs including “Yakko’s World” and \"Wakko's America\" continue to educate audiences and remain fan favorites among both adults and children, and the series continues to remain popular among online fan bases.\n\nThe new show will become the first Hulu Original Series for families and will join the Hulu Kids library alongside full libraries of exclusive kids programming including \"Teen Titans Go!,\" \"Curious George,\" \"The Powerpuff Girls,\" \"Doozers,\" \"Adventure Time,\" \"Doc McStuffins,\" \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and more.\n\nRob Paulsen, who provided the voices of Yakko and Pinky on the show, talked to me in a recent interview about what has made \"Animaniacs\" so enduring.\n\n“It was utterly clear that we were doing something really interesting and very good and very funny. Look, anytime you get to work with Steven Spielberg, he’s pretty much the king of Hollywood. He’s also one of the nicest humans that’s ever walked the planet. He’s just a delightful, sweet guy who just happens to have incredible vision and skill and a knack for hiring the right people to do what he needs them to do,” Paulsen said. “We were very aware that we were doing something that was going to be a very high level. Certainly, we had no idea it was going to be as relevant.”\n\nTo read more of my interview with Paulsen, click here.\n\n\"Animaniacs\" is produced by Amblin Television in association with Warner Bros. Animation.\n\n-BAM"
