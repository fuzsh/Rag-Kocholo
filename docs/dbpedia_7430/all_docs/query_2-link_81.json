        "text": "I have heard it said that comic books are the modern version of myths. I am sure there are people out there much smarter than I who can tell me all the reasons that correlation is wrong. But, from my cursory knowledge of myths it seems like a solid comparison. People have told stories of heroes and supernatural foes at least since recorded history. So, if we are still writing myths and legends, why are we not giving the same treatment to other classical forms of storytelling…\n\nHow come we don’t have modern fairy tales?\n\nAnd, no, I do not count modern Disney or Pixar films as such; those are movies that use the sensibilities and storytelling tropes of their medium. I mean real fairy tales: the kind about children lost in the woods, on a journey of self-discovery or teaching and learning morals. Think back to all the tales the Disney classics are based on. There is something about the original stories that is absent from their modern retellings, as well as children’s stories of the past century. The closest I can think of would be “Coraline” by Neil Gaiman.\n\nI think the key element that is missing from all of the new stories is the terrifying monsters and very real sense of danger. Those old stories have extremely creepy elements to them. Hansel and Gretel had a witch who has literally eaten children. Hansel uses the bones of devoured children to fool the witch and said witch has Gretel prepare the oven to cook her brother. That is crazy creepy. And those kinds of creepy bits are present in almost every fairytale, regardless of whether it has a happy ending or not. Those elements are completely gone from most every modern children’s tale.\n\nBut then I watched Over the Garden Wall and found a true modern fairytale. Over the Garden Wall is a 10-part miniseries that aired on Cartoon Network last month. It is about a teenager and his kid brother getting lost in the woods and trying to find their way home. Along the way they fight off evil creatures, solve the problems of people they encounter, and learn and grow from their experiences. The world they explore is wondrous and bizarre and often very frightening.\n\nThe show stars Elijah Wood and many other notable actors. Christopher Lloyd plays the Woodsman, John Cleese plays a couple characters, and even Tim Curry is in it. The animation is simple, yet effective and each character looks interesting and unique. Each episode is only 10 minutes but encompasses a full adventure in the two brothers’ quest.\n\nOne thing each episode has in common is some super-creepy monster that, more often than not, turns out to be completely harmless (or at least a red herring). The thing I love about this is it makes each episode feel like a fable for kids. The world is a big, scary place for a kid. There are lots of things that scare kids (and some adults) that are perfectly harmless. But, each of these episodes show how the things that scare you are often not scary at all once you get to understand it. Or, if it is actually dangerous, the cartoon shows kids that they are not powerless to defeat it. This it does without even ever bringing attention to it. Those are wonderful parables for kids to learn.\n\nAt times it gets a little strange (it is a Cartoon Network show, after all), but the whole series was incredibly charming and really funny at times. This is a show I would love to share with my nieces and nephews, and maybe even their parents. I am also glad it ended when it did. I think this kind of story would not have been well served if it were made into a multi-season show like most cartoons are. It was delightful and perfectly made for its format.\n\nHere is the first episode for those interested in watching.\n\nThere are a couple of guys I want to introduce you all to: Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. This duo is one of my favorite forces in Hollywood. They specialize in my favorite brand of comedy. I do not know how to explain what exactly my comedy brand is, but a perfect example would be this clip from Futurama. Anyway, they only have a handful of works to their names, but those movies/TV shows are some of the funniest productions of the past decade. Below is a list of some of their more notable creations and what I think of them. If you have not yet, I highly recommend checking each of them out, except maybe 21 Jump Street because it is rated R).\n\nTHE LEGO MOVIE\n\nLord Business has concocted a most evil of plans; plans that will make next Tuesday live in infamy… forever! His desire to maintain order and perfection has oppressed the people of Lego for too long. Now, a Special has been chosen to rise up against Lord Businesses’ evilry and bring freedom back to the people of the entire universe.\n\nThe main song of this movie perfectly sums up the movie itself: Everything is Awesome! This movie shows once again how imaginative and wonderfully creative Lord and Miller are. A somewhat frenetic story, it is told as though it were being written by a six-year-old playing with his dad’s Legos. The humor is at once clever, silly, adorable, and completely appropriate for kids and adults. The action can get muddled at times, making it difficult to discern what exactly is going on. Still, the animation is so incredible. It utilizes the medium of Lego pieces in a mock-stop-motion style that is beyond perfect for the style and feel of this movie. All in all, no one should feel anything but childlike joy walking out of this one. A-\n\nCLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS\n\nFlint is a science genius who grows up in a small fishing town. An outcast because of his brilliance and creative, misguided inventions, he grows up alone and friendless until the day he invents a machine that turns weather into food. By exploiting this new machine the town gets a huge tourism boom and everyone has Flint to thank. His newfound popularity goes to his head and he loses focus on the forces that drove his inventing: a love of science a desire to help others. In so doing, he overlooks the impending doom of his malfunctioning machine, resulting in the world getting overrun by cataclysmic food-based super-storms. Typical kid’s movie stuff happens and you already know how this is gonna end. Even so, this is still one of the funniest movies and a must-see.\n\nOne of the most visually stunning movies outside of Pixar, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs’ eye-popping aesthetic is seconded only by its sequel. The character arcs are all familiar kid’s movie tropes but you have never seen it done this way before. The story and characters maintain a child-like wonder that fits perfectly with the humor and visuals. It is surprisingly innocent and without a hint of irony or apology that is included far too often in these kinds of movies. It is also one of the best disaster movies ever made. A\n\n… AND IT’S SEQUEL.\n\nFlint and company return to what was once their hometown to search for his weather machine. Since the last movie ended, the entire area has completely transformed into a food-themed jungle.\n\nAll the imaginative and colorful aesthetic of the first movie gets dialed up to 11 in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. It is unfortunate that the Flint character arc is pretty much a retreading of the first movie, but I loved every minute of this movie—food puns and all. It is too bad that it does not have the same heart as the first part. Still, it is a hilarious parody of monster movies like Jurassic Park. If you liked the first one, you will certainly enjoy its sequel.\n\nLord and Miller were just writers on this movie, but it still noticeably one of their productions.B\n\n21 JUMP STREET\n\nAlthough technically a sequel to the TV series, 21 Jump Street more closely resembles every other buddy cop movie than it does the source material. This is not by accident, though. While being an above-average buddy-cop movie, this film is a fantastic satire of the nostalgia-driven remakes that saturate the current Hollywood scene. Not only that, it also takes shots at how much different high school is in real life as opposed to its portrayal in film. It is hilarious from start to finish with a great twist at the end, though I think most people will not appreciate the semi-cynical humor. Raunchier than I care for and a shocking amount of swearing, this movie is really smart and stupid at the same time. It definitely earns its R rating. B-\n\nCLONE HIGH\n\nA secret government organization, The Board of Shadowy Figures, has a plan to conquer the world. They have hired a mad scientist to create an army of the clones of every famous guy and lady from history. Of course, the clones grow up just like normal humans, so at some point they are all going to be sexy teens in high school (hence the name Clone High). That is where this story takes place. Following Abe Lincoln, JFK, Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, Gandhi, and many, many other familiar folk, we see how dramatic life is for a typically American clone during their adolescent years.\n\nThis is my favorite TV show. Ever. The humor runs pretty risqué, so it is not for everyone. Even so, I still love every second of this show that was cut tragically short—only running 14 episodes total. I talk about this show with every one of my friends and I quote it more than just about anything else. It is the epitome of that style of comedy I love. A+\n\nI am surprised to find out how much Children’s Educational Television there is available on cable networks right now. Every broadcasting network owns at least one cable network dedicated to 24-hour CET. However, due to existing programming on those broadcast channels as well as the difficulty entering the market opposite CET juggernauts like Nick Jr. and PBS, most channels restricted their educational programming blocks to Saturday mornings. Many channels did not exclusively air CET on Saturdays, but would air them on weekdays as well. The main difference was that these were not considered CET blocks. Examples include FOX (and later Kids’ WB) airing shows like Histeria! or The Magic School Bus.\n\nMany of these channels ran syndicated reruns of their programming throughout the week, so finding out exactly how much they were airing was difficult, especially since the networks themselves do not keep very good track of those metrics. The FCC enacted The Children’s Television Act in 1990 that required all broadcast networks to air at least 3 hours of CET a week. This is why those Saturday morning blocks have been around for so long despite cable networks from these same stations existing elsewhere.\n\nBelow is a brief history of these Saturday morning blocks as well as a brief history of the cable channels’ history.\n\nABC showed content from Disney Channel’s own educational block (now dubbed Disney Jr.), but only on Saturdays. Ended in 2011 and replaced by Litton’s Weekend Adventure.\n\nNBC showed programming from Discovery channel’s children’s television blocks on Saturday mornings from 2002-2006, then Qubo from 06-12. NBC also owns the CET channel Sprout, which has been available since 2005.\n\nCBS had Daily programming, mostly old syndicated shows, but only on Saturday mornings. It was first CBS Kidshow (97-99), then Nick Jr. on CBS (99-06), then Cookie Jar TV (06-13) and now is CBS Dream Team.\n\nKids WB, later CW Kids and finally Vortexx. Only on Saturday but with certain syndicated cartoons that ran weekdays as not part of a block.\n\nIn 2003 the DiC Kids Network was syndicated as an educational block for FOX and independent stations to air daily or on Saturday mornings. In 2008, it changed its name to the Cookie Jar Kids Network. It ceased to exist come September 2011\n\nNick Jr. was an educational television block that aired weekday mornings on Nickelodeon starting in 1988 and running until today. The block’s length has changed throughout the years, but has been anywhere from three to five hours of content. Eventually, the programming would become so popular that Nickelodeon would syndicate it on its own cable channel called The Noggin. The Noggin was rebranded as Nick Jr. in September 2009.\n\nDisney Jr., originally Playhouse Disney, started in May of 1997 as part of the Disney Channel relaunch as a commercial-free cable network. I showed hours of children’s educational and entertainment programming every weekday morning and on Saturdays too. It was rebranded Nick Jr. in February of 2011. This coincided with the Disney Jr. cable network that launched at the same time. The television block still runs today on The Disney Channel from 6:00 am to 2:00 pm on weekdays and for three hours on weekends.\n\nDiscovery Family, originally Discovery Kids, is another cable channel of children’s educational television. It has been on air since 1996. In 2010, it joined with Hasbro to become The Hub network, but has been rebranded as Discovery Family this month (October 2014).\n\nIn this fourth and final part of the Animaniacs retrospective I want to talk about the element of this show that, I feel, made it so memorable and incredible: the music. While many people contributed to the music of Animaniacs, there are two individuals who really made it something special. They are Richard Stone and Randy Rogel.\n\nRichard Stone is the man who composed all the music for Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, Freakazoid!, Histeria!, and Tiny Toon Adventures. In each show the music was composed to be in the same vein as music from classic Warner Bros. and MGM cartoons. By many different accounts, there were between 15 and 30 members of the orchestra.\n\nWhat is most noteworthy of the music is how it is used to supplement the sound effects of the cartoon. IN most shows, cartoon and otherwise, music is just this ethereal thing in the background that reflects the emotions of a scene. However, in many classic cartoons, the music also reflected the action of a scene.\n\nHere, watch this skit The Wheel of Morality, and pay attention to how the music is used to reflect the action of the characters and objects.\n\nNotice how they use the woodwinds to imitate the sound of running, orchestra hits for foot stomps, flutes for the spinning wheel, the sound of the paper printing out, etc. etc. etc.? The show's entire score is that detailed. Most of us hardly notice it because it is so seamless, but it gives the whole show and energy and feel that is very \"Warner Bros.\"-sy.\n\nThat is the genius of Richard Stone. For hundreds of episodes he did this time and time again. He did orchestrations for dozens of movies and died in 2001 (which sucks because he wasn't that old and probably would have gone on to do tons of amazing work). In the clips to come, just remember that one guy did all that orchestration.\n\nI am going to be completely honest: the whole reason I did all this stuff the past few weeks was because I wanted to eventually get to talking about Randy Rogel. I cannot think of any one person in Hollywood to whom I am a bigger fan than this man. A huge chunk of my childhood was influenced by this one guy.\n\nA West Point graduate, he started as a writer on Batman: The Animated Series. Around the time that Warner Bros. was looking for writers for Animaniacs he asked to audition. They kind of turned him down because they saw him as a serious writer and they were looking for comedy writers. So, what did Rogel do? He created a song as his audition piece, and this is what he wrote...\n\nYeah, this is the kind of guy we are dealing with here. For a kids show, he writes a song that lists every country in the world (at the time). Not only is it catchy, it rhymes and is also organized by continent since he knew that he could not have a character jumping around a map the whole time because it would be too hard to animate.\n\nTom Ruegger wanted the show to have a semi-academic element to it through the musical shorts and would often task Rogel with writing those pieces. One such song was an attempt to teach kids about the abstract concept of time.\n\nAnother was a song about the planets of the solar system as well as the universe itself.\n\nOf course, not every song was commissioned by Ruegger. Sometimes, Rogel would write songs he himself wanted to write.\n\nIn 1994, there was a giant earthquake in Los Angeles. Rogel's son (who was 6 years old) told his dad that he should write a song about the L. A. quake. Rogel wrestled with writing that song for weeks, unable to find the hook. Then, one day when driving home on the freeway, he starts to think \"A quake... a quake... !!! A Quake, a quake, oh what a mess they make! ...\" He pulls his car over on the freeway and writes the lyrics and melody for the entire song in one sitting.\n\nEventually, Ruegger makes an educational series for Fox and the WB called Histeria!. Of course, he asks Rogel to write for the series. The songs he wrote for it are some of my absolute favorite things ever. They are so wonderfully brilliant I cannot even express in text alone how much I love these songs.\n\nFirst is a song about the assassination of Julius Caesar. (You know, for kids!)\n\nThen, he decides to write a song that could be used by students all the way through college. It not only enumerates all 37 of William Shakespeare's plays but also gives a brief synopsis of each.\n\nThis last song is my absolute favorite. I cannot get over how incredible this song is! Just... just give it a listen.\n\nI heard Rogel once say that he wrote of 70 (I think that was the number) songs for these shows, most of which never got the chance to get into production. Still, we have dozens and dozens of his songs all made and animated. I genuinely have no idea why this guy does not get more work. I wish he was allowed to write for a Disney animated film, because I think he would have done way better than Randy Newman.\n\nLast bit of work on his imdb page is the song \"Poisonous Love\" from Rio 2. Well, that is something, at least.\n\nWell, that is the end of my Animaniacs retrospective. Hopefully I did not ramble too much, but I just love this show so much. I think anyone who watched it as a kid was tremendously influenced by the show's amazing cast of writers, actors, musicians, and directors. It is sad to think such incredible work is merely lightning in a bottle, but maybe some executive in the future will have the clout to try at something like this type of show again. Heck, with all the remakes coming out, maybe we will finally get an Animaniacs movie.\n\nOne can only hope.\n\nLet’s start with the man who voices the most recognizable character from the show: Rob Paulsen. Paulsen has been working in voice-over since 1981 when he did work on The Smurfs. Chances are, if you have been watching television cartoons over the past three decades you have probably heard at least one of his many, many characters. (This also goes for several people on this list, by the way).\n\nOn Animaniacs he was the voice of Yakko Warner, Pinky, Dr. Otto Scratchensniff, and about a dozen background characters. But, I think most boys would recognize him as the voice of Raphael from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Oddly enough, he is now the voice of Donatello in the newest iteration of the TMNT cartoon currently airing on Nickelodeon. But, he also is the voice behind P.J. from Goof Troop as well as A Goofy Movie, Mighty Max, The Mask (the animated series), Carl Wheezer from Jimmy Neutron, and even did the voice of Mr. Opportunity from Honda ads from 2004 to 2011 as well as voices for dozens of other cartoons. (The picture below is a pretty complete collection of his work).\n\nAnd, as talented as the guy is at creating funny characters as well as serious one, he is also a fantastic singer. Just look up any songs from Animaniacs and they will most likely feature Yakko singing. For an international show at Disney’s Epcot Center he provided the singing voices for both Jose Carioca and Panchito (two of the Three Caballeros).\n\nI am going to talk a lot more about the music and, by extension, Paulsen’s songs next week so I won’t post much about it here.\n\nI could spend a month talking about Rob Paulsen alone. His podcast, Talkin’ Toons! - with Rob Paulsen, is a must-listen for anyone interested in voice-over work.\n\nFor now, hopefully you get the idea of the kind of talent behind the voices of Animaniacs, 'cause I'm just getting started.\n\nThe voice behind Dot Warner is the incredible Tress MacNeille. Probably most recognized for her work on The Simpsons and Futurama, MacNeille also has a long list of work that spans the past three decades. On the aforementioned Simpsons and Futurama she provides the voices for pretty much every old-woman characters like Agnes Skinner, Mom, etc. She also provides the voices for Dolph and Jimbo, two of the three bullies who pick on Bart.\n\nShe has done a couple major important roles at Disney as well. For the past 15 years she has been the official voice of Daisy Duck as well as the voices of Chip and Gadget from Chip ‘N’ Dale Rescue Rangers. She did a bit of work at Nickelodeon as well. She was the voice of Angelica’s mom on Rugrats (Charlotte Pickles) as well as the grandma character from Hey Arnold!. Of course, what got her the job on Animaniacs was the incredible work she had already put in over at Tiny Toon Adventures where she played Babs Bunny. Babs Bunny is probably one of the best female characters in animated television and MacNeille brought a unique Robin Williams-esque flair to that character.\n\nMacNeille is also a talented singer, though she was not used nearly as much as Paulsen.\n\nhttp://www.televisiontunes.com/Animaniacs_-_Several_Drops_of_Rain.html\n\nI am gonna be honest with you guys: I have no idea who Jess Harnell is. I feel bad saying that since I am sure he is an awesome guy. I mean, he did do the voice of Wakko Warner. But, I do not recognize him from anything else. I had to look up his imdb page and I saw nothing that I recognized him from. He has had plenty of work, just nothing especially noteworthy.\n\nSorry.\n\nAs mentioned above, Rob Paulsen was the voice of Pinky. But Pinky was merely a sidekick to the genius of The Brain, voiced by Maurice LaMarche. LaMarche was a stand-up comedian who became a voice actor in the 80s. Most of his voice-over work involves doing impersonations of people, though usually not portraying the person he is imitating. Does that make sense? No, probably not. Here let me give you an example.\n\nMaurice LaMarche has been doing the voice of Toucan Sam for a while now. He was cast in the role because he so perfectly imitated Ronald Colman, the voice Toucan Sam is based on. LaMarche is most famous for his Orson Wells impersonation, which he has applied to several roles including The Brain. He has also been cast for his impersonation of Don Adams, Peter Falk, and Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nMissing: Toucan Sam, Inspector Gadget, and Kif Kroker\n\nHe was won several awards for his work on Futurama, Pinky & The Brain, and many others. He is possibly the funniest person on this list and one of the most underrated as well.\n\nIf one other character would be as common as the Warners, it would have to be the guy who is always chasing them, Ralph the Guard. Ralph is voiced by one of the most iconic voice actors in the business, Frank Welker. Along with Mel Blanc, he is probably the voice behind most every famous cartoon character you have ever heard. He also has the specialized talent of making realistic animal noises. He did the voice for Abu from Disney’s Aladdin, Nibbler from Futurama, Monkey from Dexter’s Lab, Santa’s Little Helper from The Simpsons, and tons more. Chances are, if you have heard a dog, cat, horse, chicken, monster, or anything else non-human in a cartoon it was probably voiced by Welker. He and one other actor provide all the animal noises in American animation.\n\nSince the 60s, Frank Welker has been bringing dozens upon dozens of characters to life. This guy has literally been the voice of Fred in every iteration of Scooby-Doo since the original 1969 series. In the past couple decades he has also been the voice of Scooby-Doo.\n\nAside from the Michael Bay films, Welker has also been the voice of Megatron in every English version of Transformers.\n\nEveryone who has worked with Welker talks incessantly about how kind and charitable he is. Constantly self-effacing, he does not have a single bone of arrogance in him.\n\nDid I mention he was also the voice of Runt on Animaniacs? No? Well, he was. So… speaking of Rita & Runt.\n\nI guess the name Steven Spielberg carries some clout because Animaniacs somehow cast the legendary Bernadette Peters as the singing cat, Rita. Peters is one of the most famous actors in the history of Broadway. While not normally known for giving her talent to cartoons, she does amazing work in the Rita & Runt skits. Sometimes the lyrics are a little cheesy, but she sings with such power and beauty that it gives me chills listening to it. Rita & Runt was my favorite Animaniacs skit as a kid just because of her singing.\n\nNow I want to make some honorable mentions at the end of this over-long post.\n\nTom Ruegger’s sons Nathan and Luke also provider some voices, with Nathan as Skippy Squirrel and Luke played a flame in an episode about the writing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nOf course, Sherri Stoner did the voice of Slappy Squirrel, but I think I talked enough about her last time.\n\nNext time, I finish the month of September by talking about the music of Animaniacs and the incredible talented men who wrote and composed the music.\n\nIn last week’s post I touched a bit on some of the writers for Animaniacs. For this week’s entry I want to go more in depth on four of the lead writers for the show. Because of the hands-free approach to writing on Animaniacs, often these people are pretty much single-handedly the reason why each of their respective episodes are funny. It was less of a collaboration and more of an amalgamation of hilarious people.\n\nTom Ruegger is the brains of this operation. A former writer for Tiny Toons Adventures, Ruegger was charged with spear-heading the project that led to the creation of Animaniacs.\n\nTom Ruegger started out as an animator and writer for Hannah-Barbera during the 1980s. There, he worked on shows like A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, Snorks, and Pound Puppies as well as other Scooby-Doo projects of that decade. His remarkable work at Hannah-Barbera got him the job of helping create the four Spielberg-produced Warner Bros. cartoons: Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, Pinky and The Brain, and Freakazoid!. During this time, he also produced another Warner Bros. cartoon called Taz-Mania as well as wrote and produced for Batman: The Animated Series.\n\nAs the series producer, all scripts were sent to him before reaching Steven Spielberg for their final review. Of course, he was also actively writing episodes of Animaniacs. Here is a list of all the episodes of Animaniacs he wrote. My favorite episode from Ruegger is “Hooked on a Ceiling”* where the Warner siblings meet Michelangelo as he paints the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.\n\nThis guy literally has wheelbarrow full of Emmys because of the incredible work he did on these shows.\n\nAlso coming over from Tiny Toons was Sherri Stoner. Before working with Warner Bros. she actually did the live reference modelling for both Ariel and Belle from The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. She got her start in comedy being a part of the prestigious comedy school/group Groundlings Improv. She came on to Tiny Toons and wrote episodes that were centered on the female lead, Babs Bunny.\n\nWhile at Warner Bros she wrote a couple movie scripts, including the 1995 movie remake of Casper, along with fellow Animaniacs-writer Deanna Oliver.\n\nShe is another hugely funny writer for Animaniacs and created and voiced my favorite character, Slappy Squirrel. Stoner also designed the recurring character Mr. Skullhead. She won two Emmys for her work on Animaniacs.\n\nMy favorite episode she wrote would have to be the Slappy Squrrel cartoon “Bumbi’s Mom”*. In it, Slappy’s nephew Skippy is traumatized while watching Bumbi (a thinly veiled parody of Disney’s Bambi) because Bumbi’s mom dies in the movie. Slappy, an old veteran of the cartoon world, takes Skippy to meet the cartoon who played Bumbi’s mom to show him that it was all just a movie.\n\nAnother of the main contributing writers to the show was Paul Rugg. Oddly, he was not working in animation prior to being brought on to work on Animaniacs. Sherri Stoner’s husband had a group called Acme Comedy Theater (some of the alumni include Adam Carolla, Alex Borstein, and Joel McHale as well as another writer for Animaniacs, John McCann). Paul Rugg was one of the performers at Acme and Stoner brought him on board early in development for Animaniacs.\n\nHe is most notable as the voice of the character Mr. Director, a mockery of snooty high-concept directors that devolves into a Jerry Lewis-type oddball whenever he gets excited. Mr Director was featured primarily in Episode 13 “Hello, Nice Warners” and Episode 20 “Hearts of Twilight”. Rugg would also do the voice of Freakazoid, the title character in the third Spielberg-produced WB cartoon.\n\nRugg won three Emmys for his work on the show and has some of the best episodes of the entire series to his credit. One of my personal favorites of his is “Cookies for Einstein”*, where the Warners meet Einstein and inadvertently help him discover the mass-energy equivalence formula.\n\nOther writers for the show include John McCann and Deanna Oliver, but I know very little about either of them and could not find much about them outside of Wikipedia.\n\nNext Week, I will talk about the incredible voice talents who brought these brilliant characters to life.\n\n*every episode of Animaniacs is available on Amazon Prime and the show is currently airing on The Hub Newtork."
