        "text": "Tiny Toon Adventures Intro\n\nIf you grew up in the 90s (like me), then you know it was a great time to be alive in terms of animation. The Disney Renaissance was in full swing and the airwaves were full of amazing cartoons! In this decade television animation experienced a surge of quality and created a host of memorable shows (like Batman: The Animated Series). One of my favorites growing up was Tiny Toon Adventures, a sort-of next generation take on Looney Tunes, just updated to the 90s. Contrary to popular belief, the Tiny Toons characters are NOT the children of the classic stars (except for Gogo Dodo). Rather, they’re young toons who take after particular characters. For example:\n\nBuster Bunny/Babs Bunny: These rabbits are both inspired by Bugs Bunny. Buster represents Bugs playing the “straight man” during the 1950s while Babs represents Bugs’ more wacky side as seen in the 1940s.\n\nPlucky Duck: Plucky is almost a carbon copy of Daffy Duck (except that he’s green), right down to his greed and resentment of Buster and Babs.\n\nHamton Pig: Supposed to be inspired by Porky, but honestly I don’t see it.\n\nElmyra: It might not be clear, but Elmyra (feminine of Elmer) is a take-off on Elmer Fudd. Except instead of hunting animals with a gun, Elmyra “hunts” animals to be her unwilling pets. She LOVES animals, any kind of animal, in fact she’s been known to chase after several of the characters. A running gag is everyone being terrified by the mere mention of her name.\n\nMontana Max: a spoiled millionaire brat inspired by Yosemite Sam (he gets his comeuppance frequently throughout the series).\n\nSweetie Pie: Picture Tweetie Pie as a girl and the instigator of conflict instead of the victim. That’s Sweetie in a nutshell.\n\nFifi: If Pepe le Pew were a girl and could control his scent at will, that’s Fifi.\n\nCalamity Coyote/Little Beeper: The younger versions of Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. Sadly you don’t see these two very often (from what I read, Chuck Jones, who created Coyote and Road Runner in the first place, was not amused by their appearance and made his displeasure known).\n\nGogo Dodo: The only character confirmed to be the son of an original character, Gogo lives in Wackyland and acts just like the original Dodo.\n\nA lot of Tiny Toon episodes were parodies of famous TV show or movies, or whatever happened to be popular at the time. For instance, the 2nd episode “A Quack in the Quarks” is a shameless parody of Star Wars (Duck Vader anyone?). There’s also “The Acme Acre Zone” (The Twilight Zone, where Charlie Adler (voice of Buster) does a pretty good impression of Rod Serling), “Citizen Max” (Citizen Kane) and “Duck Trek” (Star Trek), just to name a few. There are also too many Disney parodies to count, but my particular favorite is the rip-off of Night on Bald Mountain (from Fantasia) in “Stuff That Goes Bump in the Night.” Many episodes also center around Acme Looniversity where the toons learn how to be proper cartoon characters.\n\nThe series is understandably a little dated especially when technology comes up (some of the characters brag about owning a VCR) but most of the humor still works (though there are some quips about Donald Trump (not many but they are in there) that might rub you the wrong way).\n\nTiny Toon Adventures paved the way for several spin-off series, including Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, and the very short-lived Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain. Currently the entire series is available to stream on Hulu (and is also available on DVD if Hulu isn’t an option). I hope you’ve enjoyed reading about this cartoon series. Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!\n\nSee also:\n\nAnimated Film Reviews\n\nBecome a patron of the blog at: patreon.com/musicgamer460\n\nCheck out the YouTube channel (and consider hitting the subscribe button)\n\nDon’t forget to like Film Music Central on Facebook\n\nGiven my well-known aversion to scary films, it often surprises my friends when they find out I enjoy watching Jurassic Park. While it’s true that this film has its own fair share of insanely terrifying moments (including one in particular that still scares me quite a bit), my lifelong love of dinosaurs as well as my appreciation of Spielberg’s storytelling abilities overrides my fear (John William’s excellent score helps as well). I dimly remember seeing advertisements for this film on TV and being super excited that there was a “dinosaur movie” being made.\n\nAnd given I was all of 5 years old when the film came out, I couldn’t understand why my parents wouldn’t let me see the movie with the dinosaurs in it (dinosaurs were my first obsession, I couldn’t read enough about them). Of course now I understand that they kept me far away from this film because it was full of scenes that were not appropriate for a 5 year old kid, but unfortunately for my psyche, I didn’t know that when I was 9 and finally managed to see the movie for the first time at my best friend’s house.\n\n“Welcome to Jurassic Park”\n\nIf you haven’t seen the film, Jurassic Park is adapted from Michael Crichton’s 1990 novel of the same name and follows the development of a theme park being built on (fictional) Isla Nublar off Costa Rica that is filled with genetically engineered dinosaurs resurrected from ancient DNA samples. After a deadly accident, the park’s creator John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) needs a group of experts to sign off on the park before the investors will fully commit to opening the island to the public. To that end, the following group is invited to the island to tour the facility:\n\nDr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil): an archaeologist who focuses on velociraptors and also subscribes to the (then-new) belief that dinosaurs were the direct ancestors of modern birds.\n\nDr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern): a graduate student studying with Dr. Grant (and also his girlfriend). She specializes in paleobotany.\n\nDr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum): a mathematician who specializes in chaos theory. He’s firmly against the entire concept of Jurassic Park, correctly predicting that they will be unable to control the dinosaurs they have created, insisting that “life finds a way.”\n\nDonald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero): a lawyer working on behalf of Jurassic Park’s investors. He’s initially skeptical of the project but quickly changes his mind once he first sees the dinosaurs in person.\n\nThis group is also joined by Lex and Tim Murphy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello respectively), Hammond’s grandchildren. Tim is obsessed with dinosaurs (and is a big fan of Dr. Grant’s work), while Lex is a tomboy and a would-be computer hacker.\n\nThis first part of the film shows the dinosaurs in all of their positive glory: we see a giant herd of dinosaurs gathered around a lake, feeding from the trees, even a triceratops (albeit one that’s in pain). But things start to become menacing almost straight away: we see the velociraptor enclosure and how they have to be fed by lowering whole (Live!!) cows into a brush-filled space, the only sign of their presence being the rustling of the branches. And then there’s the threat of a hurricane moving onto the island that threatens to cut the tour of the park short and oh yes, there’s also the sub-plot of programmer Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) plotting to steal various DNA samples for a rival company.\n\nOne part of this film I like is how Hammond and most of his staff are in complete denial of how completely in-over-their-heads they are in regards to the dinosaurs they’ve created. The more you hear them talk, the more you just know something is going to go terribly wrong and does it ever! Due to a series of events, the power is cut to the electric fences surrounding each enclosure and the T-Rex is among the first to get out (and did I mention the group touring the park is right in front of that area??)\n\n“The T-Rex Attacks”\n\nThe T-Rex is a masterpiece of early-90s CGI that has held up surprisingly well over the last 25 years. Originally, the dinosaurs were going to be realized with traditional stop-motion animation until a computer test demonstrated that the dinosaurs could be almost fully created with CGI. But what really puts the T-Rex over the top is the real-life component of the creature. For the epic sequence where the dinosaur stalks the human characters, a full-size animatronic head, arm and two feet were created. Shots of these components were interspersed with the CGI creation to create a spine-tingling moment.\n\nBut as scary as the T-Rex scene is, it’s nothing compared to the kitchen scene. You know the one I’m talking about: it’s late in the story, most of the surviving characters have made their way back to the main park building…but so have the velociraptors, who begin stalking Tim and Lex as they run and hide in the kitchen. This sequence terrified me as a kid because I was about the same age as Tim and Lex (give or take a few years) so I could completely identify with them as they hid from the velociraptors. Like the earlier T-Rex scene, the footage of the raptors is a combination of animatronics, live-action puppets (with human performers) and CGI. In fact, there were so many wires required to make the puppet and animatronic components work, that Tim and Lex had to repeatedly jump over them to keep from tripping on them (it’s a wonder they filmed that scene without any of that becoming visible). This scene is so well done that, even though I know it’s all part of a movie and no one is in any actual danger, I still feel terrified that the raptors are going to find and eat the kids!\n\nAnd then there’s John William’s beautiful score for this film. When you run through a list of Williams’ most recognized pieces, the main theme form Jurassic Park is almost always included and rightfully so. It was the composer’s intention to create music that embodied the sense of awe a person would feel if they really did see dinosaurs walking in front of them as the characters in the film do and the score definitely succeeds with this.\n\nAnd now for some random thoughts and trivia:\n\nWayne Knight gives an absolutely hysterical performance as Dennis Nedry, it’s almost a shame he gets his comeuppance so early in the story. That being said, his scene with the Dilophosaurus is so funny because he’s talking to a dinosaur and saying “I don’t have any food for you” when it’s patently obvious that the dinosaur considers him to be the food!\n\nThe T-Rex animatronic was the biggest creation of its time (even bigger than the Alien Queen created for Aliens which gives you an idea of its size).\n\nWhen the T-Rex charges through the sunroof of the Jeep, the glass was supposed to come out, but it was NOT supposed to crack (so note carefully how Tim and Lex’s screams jump up about an octave as they suffer a genuine and unexpected scare).\n\nExactly who was going to die or not changed several times throughout filming. At one point, Mr. Albert (Samuel L. Jackson) was going to live, the lawyer was going to live, but Hammond was going to die (as his counterpart in the book does).\n\nWhen the group has sat down for lunch after arriving on the island, watch the images playing in the background carefully. One of the “concept art” images is an exact match for the Mosasaurus enclosure seen in Jurassic World (2015)\n\nAnd those are my thoughts on Jurassic Park! I still like watching it from time to time when I want to have a day to myself (usually during a weekend). What do you think of Jurassic Park?
