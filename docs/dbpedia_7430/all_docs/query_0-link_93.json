Animation announced that they've partnered to create a brand-new version of the cartoon franchise set to premiere in 2020.\n\nThe series has already been confirmed for two seasons, and Steven Spielberg will return as executive producer. “I am so pleased and proud that Animaniacs will have a home at Hulu,” Spielberg said in a press release. “Together with Warner Bros., we look to bring new audiences and longtime fans into this wild world of Yakko, Wakko, and Dot.\"\n\nAs if that isn't enough nostalgia for one day, the press release also confirmed that the world's most beloved maniacal mice, Pinky and the Brain, will also make appearances in the new Animaniacs.\n\nSee ya in 2020.\n\nShare This Article"
