        "text": "Steven Allan Spielberg KBE OMRI (born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era and one of the most popular directors and producers in film history. He is also one of the co-founders of DreamWorks Studios.\n\nIn a career spanning more than four decades, Spielberg's films have encompassed many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science fiction and adventure films, such as Jaws (1975), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing numerous humanistic issues such as the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, civil rights, war, and terrorism in such films as The Color Purple (1985), Empire of the Sun (1987), Schindler's List (1993), Amistad (1997), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Munich (2005), War Horse (2011), Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015), and The Post (2017). His other films include Jurassic Park (1993), A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), and War of the Worlds (2005).\n\nSpielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, as well as receiving five other nominations. Three of Spielberg's films—Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and Jurassic Park—achieved box office records and came to epitomize the blockbuster film; the unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $10 billion worldwide, making him the highest-grossing director in history. His personal net worth is estimated to be more than $3 billion. He is also known for his long-standing associations with several actors, producers, and technicians, such as composer John Williams, who has composed music for all but four of Spielberg's films (Duel, The Color Purple, Bridge of Spies and Ready Player One).\n\nEarly life[]\n\nSpielberg was born on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio.[9][10] His mother, Leah (née Posner, later Adler; January 12, 1920 – February 21, 2017),[11] was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and his father, Arnold Spielberg(born 1917), was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers.[12] His family was Orthodox Jewish.[13][14][15] Spielberg's paternal grandparents were Jewish Ukrainian[16][17] immigrants who settled in Cincinnati in the 1900s; his grandmother was from Sudylkiv, while his grandfather was from Kamianets-Podilskyi.[18][19] In 1950, his family moved to Haddon Township, New Jersey, when his father took a job with RCA. Three years later, the family moved to Phoenix, Arizona.[20][21]:548 Spielberg attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi Albert L. Lewis.[22]\n\nAs a child, Spielberg faced difficulty reconciling being an Orthodox Jew with the perception of him by other children he played with. \"It isn't something I enjoy admitting,\" he once said, \"but when I was seven, eight, nine years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parents' Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times.\"[23][24]Spielberg also said he suffered from acts of anti-Semitic prejudice and bullying: \"In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible.\"[25][26][27] At age 12, he made his first home movie: a train wreck involving his toy Lionel trains.[28] Throughout his early teens, and after entering high school, Spielberg continued to make amateur 8 mm \"adventure\" films.[29]\n\nIn 1958, he became a Boy Scout and fulfilled a requirement for the photography merit badgeby making a nine-minute 8 mm film entitled The Last Gunfight.[30] Years later, Spielberg recalled to a magazine interviewer, \"My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera. He said yes, and I got an idea to do a Western. I made it and got my merit badge. That was how it all started.\"[31] At age 13, while living in Phoenix, Spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled Escape to Nowhere... using a cast composed of other high school friends. That motivated him to make 15 more amateur 8 mm films.[21]:548 In 1963, at age 16, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called Firelight, which would later inspire Close Encounters. The film was made for $500, most of which came from his father, and was shown in a local cinema for one evening, which earned back its cost.[32]\n\nAfter attending Arcadia High School in Phoenix for three years, his family next moved to Saratoga, California, where he later graduated from Saratoga High School in 1965. He attained the rank of Eagle Scout. His parents divorced while he was still in school,[33] and soon after he graduated Spielberg moved to Los Angeles, staying initially with his father. His long-term goal was to become a film director. His three sisters and mother remained in Saratoga. In Los Angeles, he applied to the University of Southern California's film school, but was turned down because of his \"C\" grade average.[21]:548 He then applied and was admitted to California State University, Long Beach, where he became a brother of Theta Chi Fraternity.[34]\n\nWhile still a student, he was offered a small unpaid intern job at Universal Studios with the editing department.[35][36] He was later given the opportunity to make a short film for theatrical release, the 26-minute, 35 mm, Amblin', which he wrote and directed. Studio vice president Sidney Sheinberg was impressed by the film, which had won a number of awards, and offered Spielberg a seven-year directing contract. It made him the youngest director ever to be signed for a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio.[21]:548 He subsequently dropped out of college to begin professionally directing TV productions with Universal.[37][38]Spielberg later returned to California State University, Long Beach and completed his BA degree in Film and Electronic Arts in 2002.[39]\n\nCareer[]\n\n1970s[]\n\nHis first professional TV job came when he was hired to direct one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of Night Gallery, written by Rod Serling and starring Joan Crawford.[40]Crawford, however, was \"speechless, and then horrified\" at the thought of a twenty-one-year-old newcomer directing her, one of Hollywood's leading stars. \"Why was this happening to me?\" she asked the producer.[41] Her attitude changed after they began working on her scenes:\n\nWhen I began to work with Steven, I understood everything. It was immediately obvious to me, and probably everyone else, that here was a young genius. I thought maybe more experience was important, but then I thought of all of those experienced directors who didn't have Steven's intuitive inspiration and who just kept repeating the same old routine performances. That was called \"experience.\" I knew then that Steven Spielberg had a brilliant future ahead of him. Hollywood doesn't always recognize talent, but Steven's was not going to be overlooked. I told him so in a note I wrote him. I wrote to Rod Serling, too. I was so grateful that he had approved Steven as the director. I told him he had been totally right.[41]\n\nShe and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death. The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more \"mature\" films. After this, and an episode of Marcus Welby, M.D., Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of The Name of the Game called \"L.A. 2017\". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on Night Gallery and did some work for shows such as Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law and The Psychiatrist, before landing the first series episode of Columbo (previous episodes were actually TV films).\n\nBased on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a Richard Matheson adaptation called Duel. The film is about a psychotic Peterbilt 281tanker truck driver who chases the terrified driver (Dennis Weaver) of a small Plymouth Valiant and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic Dilys Powell was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (Something Evil) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of The Exorcist, then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called Savage, starring Martin Landau. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was The Sugarland Express, about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and The Hollywood Reporter stated that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\"[9]:223 However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.\n\nStudio producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown offered Spielberg the director's chair for Jaws, a thriller-horror film based on the Peter Benchley novel about an enormous killer shark. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs. But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three Academy Awards (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing more than $470 million worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as \"Jawsmania.\"[9]:248 Jaws made Spielberg a household name and one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, allowing him a great deal of autonomy for his future projects.[9]:250 It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor Richard Dreyfuss.\n\nRejecting offers to direct Jaws 2,[42] King Kongand Superman, Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about UFOs, which became Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, Close Encounters was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other Academy Awardsnominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, Vilmos Zsigmond, and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, 1941, a big-budgeted World War II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4 million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.[43]\n\nSpielberg then revisited his Close Encountersproject and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released Close Encounters: The Special Edition in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.\n\n1980s[]\n\nNext, Spielberg teamed with Star Wars creator and friend George Lucas on an action adventure film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first of the Indiana Jones films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by Harrison Ford (whom Lucas had previously cast in his Star Wars films as Han Solo). The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the Golden Age of Hollywood. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). Raiders is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre. The film also led to Ford's casting in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.[44]\n\nA year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. E.T. went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. It was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director and it won 4 out of them.[45]Between 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: Poltergeist (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of The Twilight Zone (for which he directed the segment \"Kick The Can\"),[46] and The Goonies (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).[47] Spielberg appeared in a cameo on Cyndi Lauper's music video for the movie's theme song, \"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\".[48]\n\nHis next directorial feature was the Raidersprequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced Gremlins led to the creation of the PG-13 rating due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, Temple of Doom is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984. It was on this project that Spielberg also met his future wife, actress Kate Capshaw.[49]\n\nIn 1985, Spielberg released The Color Purple,an adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, about a generation of empowered African-American women during depression-era America. Starring Whoopi Goldberg and future talk-show superstar Oprah Winfrey, the film was a box office smash and critics hailed Spielberg's successful foray into the dramatic genre. Roger Ebert proclaimed it the best film of the year and later entered it into his Great Films archive. The film received eleven Academy Awardnominations, including two for Goldberg and Winfrey. However, Spielberg did not get a Best Director nomination.\n\nIn 1987, as China began opening to Western capital investment, Spielberg shot the first American film in Shanghai since the 1930s, an adaptation of J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel Empire of the Sun, starring John Malkovich and a young Christian Bale. The film garnered much praise from critics and was nominated for several Oscars, but did not yield substantial box office revenues. Reviewer Andrew Sarris called it the best film of the year and later included it among the best films of the decade.[50] Spielberg was also a co-producer of the 1987 film *batteries not included.\n\nAfter two forays into more serious dramatic films, Spielberg then directed the third Indiana Jones film, 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Once again teaming up with Lucas and Ford, Spielberg also cast actor Sean Connery in a supporting role as Indy's father. The film earned generally positive reviews and was another box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film worldwide that year; its total box office receipts even topped those of Tim Burton's much-anticipated film Batman, which had been the bigger hit domestically. Also in 1989, he re-united with actor Richard Dreyfuss for the romantic comedy-drama Always, about a daredevil pilot who extinguishes forest fires. Spielberg's first romantic film, Always was only a moderate success and had mixed reviews.\n\n1990s[]\n\nIn 1991, Spielberg directed Hook, about a middle-aged Peter Pan, played by Robin Williams, who returns to Neverland. Despite innumerable rewrites and creative changes coupled with mixed reviews, the film proved popular with audiences, making over $300 million worldwide (from a $70 million budget).\n\nIn 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with the film version of Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park, about a theme park with genetically engineered dinosaurs. With revolutionary special effects provided by friend George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magiccompany, the film would eventually become the highest-grossing film of all time (at the worldwide box office) with $914.7 million. This would be the third time that one of Spielberg's films became the highest-grossing film ever.\n\nSpielberg's next film, Schindler's List, was based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust.[51] Schindler's List earned Spielberg his first Academy Award for Best Director (it also won Best Picture). With the film a huge success at the box office, Spielberg used the profits to set up the Shoah Foundation, a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors. In 1997, the American Film Institutelisted it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made (#9) which moved up to (#8) when the list was remade in 2007.\n\nIn 1994, Spielberg took a hiatus from directing to spend more time with his family and build his new studio, DreamWorks,[52] with partners Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. In 1996, he directed the sequel to 1993's Jurassic Parkwith The Lost World: Jurassic Park, which generated over $618 million worldwide despite mixed reviews, and was the second biggest film of 1997 behind James Cameron's Titanic(which topped the original Jurassic Park to become the new recordholder for box office receipts).\n\nHis next film, Amistad, was based on a true story (like Schindler's List), specifically about an African slave rebellion. Despite decent reviews from critics, it did not do well at the box office. Spielberg released Amistad under DreamWorks Pictures,[53] which has produced all of his films from Amistad onwards with the exception of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Adventures of Tintin and Ready Player One.[54]\n\nHis 1998 theatrical release was the World War II film Saving Private Ryan, about a group of U.S. soldiers led by Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) sent to bring home a paratrooper whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours, June 5–6, of the Normandy landing. The film was a huge box office success, grossing over $481 million worldwide and was the biggest film of the year at the North American box office (worldwide it made second place after Michael Bay's Armageddon). Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as Black Hawk Down and Enemy at the Gates. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with Paramount Pictures (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the Indiana Jones series). Later, Spielberg and Tom Hanks produced a TV mini-series based on Stephen Ambrose's book Band of Brothers. The ten-part HBO mini-series follows Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a number of awards at the Golden Globes and the Emmys.\n\n2000s[]\n\nIn 2001, Spielberg filmed fellow director and friend Stanley Kubrick's final project, A.I. Artificial Intelligence which Kubrick was unable to begin during his lifetime. A futuristic film about a humanoid android longing for love, A.I.featured groundbreaking visual effects and a multi-layered, allegorical storyline, adapted by Spielberg himself. Though the film's reception in the US was relatively muted, it performed better overseas for a worldwide total box office gross of $236 million.\n\nSpielberg and actor Tom Cruise collaborated for the first time for the futuristic neo-noir Minority Report, based upon the science fiction short story written by Philip K. Dick about a Washington D.C. police captain in the year 2054 who has been foreseen to murder a man he has not yet met. The film received strong reviews with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 92% approval rating, reporting that 206 out of the 225 reviews they tallied were positive.[55] The film earned over $358 million worldwide. Roger Ebert, who named it the best film of 2002, praised its breathtaking vision of the future as well as for the way Spielberg blended CGI with live-action.[56]\n\nSpielberg's 2002 film Catch Me If You Can is about the daring adventures of a youthful con artist (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). It earned Christopher Walken an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The film is known for John Williams's score and its unique title sequence. It was a hit both commercially[57] and critically.[58]\n\nSpielberg collaborated again with Tom Hanks along with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci in 2004's The Terminal, a warm-hearted comedy about a man of Eastern European descent who is stranded in an airport. It received mixed reviews but performed relatively well at the box office. In 2005, Empire magazine ranked Spielberg number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time.\n\nAlso in 2005, Spielberg directed a modern adaptation of War of the Worlds (a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks), based on the H. G. Wells book of the same name (Spielberg had been a huge fan of the book and the original 1953 film). It starred Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, and, as with past Spielberg films, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) provided the visual effects. Unlike E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which depicted friendly alien visitors, War of the Worlds featured violent invaders. The film was another huge box office smash, grossing over $591 million worldwide.\n\nSpielberg's film Munich, about the events following the 1972 Munich Massacre of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games, was his second film essaying Jewish relations in the world (the first being Schindler's List). The film is based on Vengeance, a book by Canadian journalist George Jonas. It was previously adapted into the 1986 made-for-TV film Sword of Gideon. The film received strong critical praise, but underperformed at the U.S. and world box-office; it remains one of Spielberg's most controversial films to date.[59] Munich received five Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture, Film Editing, Original Music Score (by John Williams), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg. It was Spielberg's sixth Best Director nomination and fifth Best Picture nomination.\n\nIn June 2006, Steven Spielberg announced he would direct a scientifically accurate film about \"a group of explorers who travel through a worm hole and into another dimension\",[60] from a treatment by Kip Thorne and producer Lynda Obst.[61] In January 2007, screenwriter Jonathan Nolan met with them to discuss adapting Obst and Thorne's treatment into a narrative screenplay. The screenwriter suggested the addition of a \"time element\" to the treatment's basic idea, which was welcomed by Obst and Thorne.[61] In March of that year, Paramount hired Nolan, as well as scientists from Caltech, forming a workshop to adapt the treatment under the title Interstellar.[62] The following July, Kip Thorne said there was a push by people for him to portray himself in the film.[63] Spielberg later abandoned Interstellar, which was eventually directed by Christopher Nolan.[64]\n\nSpielberg directed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which wrapped filming in October 2007 and was released on May 22, 2008.[65][66] This was his first film not to be released by DreamWorks since 1997. The film received generally positive reviews from critics,[67] and was financially successful, grossing $786 million worldwide.\n\n2010s[]\n\nIn early 2009, Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on The Adventures of Tintin, written by Belgian artist Hergé,[68] with Peter Jackson. The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, was not released until October 2011, due to the complexity of the computer animation involved. The world premiere took place on October 22, 2011 in Brussels, Belgium.[69] The film was released in North American theaters on December 21, 2011, in Digital 3D and IMAX.[70]It received generally positive reviews from critics,[71] and grossed over $373 million worldwide.[72] The Adventures of Tintin won the award for Best Animated Feature Film at the Golden Globe Awards that year.[73] It is the first non-Pixar film to win the award since the category was first introduced.[74][75] Jackson has been announced to direct the second film.[76]\n\nSpielberg followed with War Horse, shot in England in the summer of 2010.[77] It was released just four days after The Adventures of Tintin, on December 25, 2011.

War Horse received generally positive reviews from critics,[78] and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.[79]\n\nSpielberg next directed the historical drama filmLincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as United States President Abraham Lincoln and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln.[80] Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's bestseller Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, the film covered the final four months of Lincoln's life. Written by Tony Kushner, the film was shot in Richmond, Virginia, in late 2011,[81] and was released in the United States in November 2012.[82][83] Upon release, Lincoln received widespread critical acclaim,[84] and was nominated for twelve Academy Awards (the most of any film that year) including Best Picture and Best Director for Spielberg.[85] It won the award for Best Production Design and Day-Lewis won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Lincoln, becoming the first three-time winner in that category as well as the first to win for a performance directed by Spielberg.\n\nIt was announced on May 2, 2013, that Spielberg would direct the film about the story of U.S. sniper Chris Kyle, titled American Sniper.[86] However, on August 5, 2013, it was announced that Spielberg had decided not to direct the film, which was instead directed by Clint Eastwood.[87]\n\nSpielberg promoting Ready Player One (2018) in Japan.\n\nSpielberg directed 2015's Bridge of Spies, a Cold War thriller based on the 1960 U-2 incident, and focusing on James B.

The film stars Tye Sheridan,[97]Olivia Cooke,[98] Ben Mendelsohn, Simon Peggand Mark Rylance.[99] It began production in London in July 2016,[100] a year before The Post, which was filmed, edited and released during the lengthy, effects-heavy post-production period for Ready Player One. Ready Player One was originally slated to be released on December 15, 2017[101] by Warner Bros.,[102]but was pushed back to March 29, 2018, to avoid competition with Star Wars: The Last Jedi.[103] It had its world premiere at the South by Southwest film festival, on March 11, 2018.[104]\n\nUpcoming projects[]\n\nDuring an interview with The Tech in 2015, Spielberg described how he chooses the film projects he would work on:\n\n[Sometimes], a story speaks to me, even if it doesn't speak to any of my collaborators or any of my partners, who look at me and scratch their heads and say, 'Gee, are you sure you wanna get into that trench for a year and a half?' I love people challenging me that way because it's a real test about my own convictions and [whether] I can be the standing man of my own life and take a stand on a subject that may not be popular, but that I would be proud to add to the body of my work. That's pretty much the litmus test that gets me to say, 'Yeah, I'll direct that one.'[105]\n\nSpielberg plans to direct a new film adaptation of the musical West Side Story.[106] Tony Kushner stated in July 2017 that he is adapting the classic show's book for Spielberg, though the musical score will remain unchanged, as will the late-1950s setting.[107] In January 2018, he began an open casting search for the four lead roles, three of the roles being specifically for Latino actors.[108] On October 2, 2018, it was announced that Ansel Elgort will play the lead role of Tony in the film.[109]\n\nSpielberg also plans to film a fifth installment in the Indiana Jones series. The untitled film is set to star Harrison Ford and will be produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. It is being written by David Koepp, who has written numerous other films for Spielberg, including the last Indiana Jones film.[110] It was originally set for release by Disney on July 19, 2019.[111] It was then announced that filming would begin in the UK in April 2019[112] and the film was given a new release date of July 10, 2020.[113] Filming was postponed again in June 2018, when Jonathan Kasdan was announced as the film's new writer.[114] Soon after, a new release date of July 9, 2021 was announced.[115]\n\nSpielberg had planned to film his long-planned adaptation of David Kertzer's The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara in early 2017 for release at the end of that year,[116] but production has been postponed. The book follows the true story of a young Jewish boy in 1858 Italy who was secretly baptized by a family servant and then kidnapped from his family by the Papal States, where he was raised and trained as a priest, causing international outrage and becoming a media sensation. It was first announced in 2014, with Kushner adapting the book for the screen.[117] Mark Rylance, in his fourth consecutive collaboration with Spielberg, was announced to star in the role of Pope Pius IX. Oscar Isaac was set to star as Mortara's father, but eventually dropped out.[118]Spielberg had difficulty casting the title role, though he saw more than 2000 kids.[119]\n\nSpielberg is attached to direct an adaptation of American photojournalist Lynsey Addario's memoir It's What I Do.

After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer Julia Phillips, \"I met a real heartbreaker last night.\"[9]:293 Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his \"bachelor funky\" house.[9]:294They lived together for four years, but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship. Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own: \"I don't want to be known as Steven's girlfriend,\" she said, and chose not to be in any of his films during those years.[9]:295\n\nAs a result, they broke up in 1979, but remained close friends. Then in 1984 they renewed their romance, and in November 1985, they married, already having had a son, Max Samuel. After three and a half years of marriage, however, many of the same competing stresses of their careers caused them to divorce in 1989. They agreed to maintain homes near each other as to facilitate the shared custody and parenting of their son.[9]:403 Their divorce was recorded as the third most costly celebrity divorce in history.[166]\n\nSpielberg subsequently developed a relationship with actress Kate Capshaw, whom he met when he cast her in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. They married on October 12, 1991. Capshaw is a convert to Judaism.[167][168] They currently move among their four homes in Pacific Palisades, California; Quelle Farm, Georgica Pond in East Hampton, New York;[169] New York City; and Naples, Florida.\n\nThere are seven children in the Spielberg-Capshaw family:\n\nJessica Capshaw (born August 9, 1976) – daughter from Kate Capshaw's previous marriage to Robert Capshaw\n\nMax Samuel Spielberg (born June 13, 1985) – son from Spielberg's previous marriage to actress Amy Irving\n\nTheo Spielberg (born August 21, 1988) – son adopted by Capshaw before her marriage to Spielberg, who later also adopted him[170]\n\nSasha Rebecca Spielberg (born May 14, 1990, Los Angeles)\n\nSawyer Avery Spielberg (born March 10, 1992, Los Angeles)[171]\n\nMikaela George (born February 28, 1996) – adopted with Kate Capshaw\n\nDestry Allyn Spielberg (born December 1, 1996)\n\nReligion[]\n\nSpielberg grew up in a Jewish household, including having a bar mitzvah ceremony in Phoenix when he turned 13. He grew away from Judaism after his family moved to various cities during his high school years, where they became the only Jews in the neighborhood.[172]:29 Before those years, his family was involved in the synagogue and had many Jewish friends and nearby relatives.\n\nHe remembers his grandparents telling him about their life in Russia, where they were subjected to religious persecution, causing them to eventually flee to the United States. He was made aware of the Holocaust by his parents, who he says \"talked about it all the time, and so it was always on my mind.\"[172]:30His father had lost between sixteen and twenty relatives during the Holocaust.[9]:21\n\nSpielberg \"rediscovered the honor of being a Jew,\" he says, before he made Schindler's List, when he married Kate Capshaw.[172]:25 Until then, having become a filmmaker, he only felt his connection to Judaism when he visited his parents. He says he made the film partly to create \"something that would confirm my Judaism to my family and myself.\"[173]\n\nKate is Protestant and she insisted on converting to Judaism. She spent a year studying, did the \"mikveh,\" the whole thing. She chose to do a full conversion before we were married in 1991, and she married me after becoming a Jew. I think that, more than anything else, brought me back to Judaism.[172]:25\n\nHe credits her with fueling his family's current level of observance and for keeping the \"momentum flowing\" in their lives, as they now observe Jewish holidays, light candles on Friday nights, and give their children Bar and Bat Mitzvahs.[172]:26 \"This shiksa goddess has made me a better Jew than my own parents.\"[172]:27\n\nProducing Schindler's List in 1993 also renewed his faith, Spielberg says, but \"it really was the fact that my wife took a profound interest in Judaism.\"[172]:25 He waited ten years after being given the story in 1982 to make the film, as he did not yet feel \"mature\" enough.[172]:32 He first wanted to have a family, \"to figure out what my place was in the world... . When my first son, [Max] was born, it greatly affected me... . A spirit began to ignite in me, and I became a Jewish dad...\"[9]:21\n\nHe said that making the film became a \"natural experience\" for him, adding, \"I had to tell the story. I've lived on its outer edges.\"[9] The film, writes biographer Joseph McBride, thereby became the \"culmination\" of Spielberg's long personal struggle with his Jewish identity.[174]:18Some claim the film has made Spielberg \"the one true heir to the great Jewish moguls who created Hollywood,\" most of whom had actively avoided depicting Jews or the Holocaust in their films.[173]\n\nWealth[]\n\nForbes magazine places Spielberg's personal net worth at $3.7 billion.[1]\n\nYachting[]\n\nIn 2013, Spielberg purchased the 282-foot (86 m) mega-yacht Seven Seas for US$182 million.

He has ordered a new 300-foot (91 m) yacht costing a reported US$250 million.[175]\n\nRecognition[]\n\nIn 2002, Spielberg was one of eight flagbearers who carried the Olympic Flag into Rice-Eccles Stadium at the Opening Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City.

The annual list is conducted by E-Poll Market Research and it gave more than 6,600 celebrities on 46 different personality attributes a score representing \"how that person is perceived as influencing the public, their peers, or both.\" Spielberg received a score of 47, meaning 47% of the US believes he is influential. Gerry Philpott, president of E-Poll Market Research, supported Spielberg's score by stating, \"If anyone doubts that Steven Spielberg has greatly influenced the public, think about how many will think for a second before going into the water this summer.\"[178][179][180]\n\nPolitics[]\n\nSpielberg usually supports U.S. Democratic Party candidates. He has donated over $800,000 to the Democratic party and its nominees. He has been a close friend of former President Bill Clinton and worked with the President for the USA Millennium celebrations.

He donated US$1 million to Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton Super PAC.[192]\n\nIn 2018, Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw donated $500,000 to the March for Our Livesstudent demonstration in favor of gun control in the United States.[193]\n\nHobbies[]\n\nA collector of film memorabilia, Spielberg purchased a balsa Rosebud sled from Citizen Kane (1941) in 1982.[194] He bought Orson Welles's own directorial copy of the script for the radio broadcast The War of the Worlds(1938) in 1994.[195] Spielberg has purchased Academy Award statuettes being sold on the open market and donated them to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, to prevent their further commercial exploitation.

Spielberg played many of LucasArts adventure games, including the first Monkey Islandgames.[200][201] He owns a Wii, a PlayStation 3, a PSP, and an Xbox 360, and enjoys playing first-person shooters such as the Medal of Honor series and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. He has also criticized the use of cutscenes in games, calling them intrusive, and feels making story flow naturally into the gameplay is a challenge for future game developers.[202]\n\nStalking[]\n\nIn 2001, Spielberg was stalked by conspiracy theorist and former social worker Diana Napolis. She accused him, along with actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, of controlling her thoughts through \"cybertronic\" technology and being part of a satanic conspiracy against her.
