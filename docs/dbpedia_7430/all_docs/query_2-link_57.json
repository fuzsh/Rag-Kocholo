        "text": "I challenge you to find me someone who has heard the Pinky and the Brain theme song - even once - and can't hum its diabolical tune: \"They're Pinky and the Brain, they're Pinky and the Brain, one is a genius, the other is insane...\" Just like its theme song, there is something about this show that sticks in the mental craw and forces you to pay attention. While not all of the episodes found here are winners, and the pacing may occasionally be tiresome, the episodes in this first volume bring to mind the hilarity behind the show's single-word catchphrases: \"E-gad!\", \"Point!\" and the exclamation for all occasions, \"Narf!\"\n\nWhen you boil it down there are two strengths that the show really sells: its central story mechanic and its diametrically opposed heroes. The show itself has quite an interesting history. It began as one of the segments in Animaniacs and after two short years its popularity afforded Pinky and The Brain a series of their own. Over the course of its four seasons the series would be nominated for several awards - winning a few Emmys to boot - and induct a few of its catchphrases into the pop culture lexicon.\n\nEach and every episode is framed with the same device: at the beginning of the story The Brain will inform us of his latest devious plot to - what else? - take over the world. The bulk of the episode will then have Pinky and The Brain executing their brilliant plan, only to fail at the last moment and be forced to return to their laboratory home (they do live in a cage, after all) to start the whole thing over again the following night. In short: what do they do each night? The same thing they do every night: try to take over the world!\n\nWhile it may seem that the premise would get stale after a few episodes, it's actually the opposite. As one of the producers explains in the documentary found in the extras, the rigid format opened up a world of infinite possibilities. How would they take over the world tonight? With mind controlling dolls (that they would force Santa's workshop to produce) or by scouring the bottom of the ocean for the Titanic, only to use the sea life that lives in its sunken hull in order to enslave the human population?\n\nYou begin at point A and as long as you end at point Z, anything in between is fair game. The more creative the writer, the better the situation. And these guys are nothing if not creative, witty, and hilarious - the entire point was to come up with a plot that was as off the wall as possible. It certainly helps when you've got a creative talent like Steven Spielberg overseeing the proceedings. Unlike most high-profile producers who are involved with TV shows, Spielberg was very hands-on with all of his animated projects. Both his film culture background and his love of classic Warner Bros. animation seeps into the fabric of the show and the series benefits from his influence.\n\nOther than the silly, entertaining plots, the other key to the show was its voice actors: Rob Paulsen is great as Pinky and Maurice LaMarche is endlessly hilarious as The Brain. Originally inspired by LaMarche's Orson Welles impression, The Brain makes a brilliant foil to the always-zany Pinky (in an interesting side-note, LaMarche provided the voice of Orson Welles in Ed Wood's emotional climax).\n\nAnother element of the show that must be addressed is the fantastic music that accompanies each and every episode. I'm not sure, but it feels like when Spielberg sat down with the writers to layout the guidelines for the show (and Animaniacs) an item at the top of the list was \"Must have classic WB cartoon musical cues.\" And it works wonderfully.\n\nEach episode has a full orchestra playing various twings, twangs, and bump-bump-bumps in time with the character's actions. Additionally, you'll find at least one musical theme cue (from a film, TV show, or anywhere else) every five seconds. This ties the show in to the classic Chuck Jones cartoon legends and it adds an extra layer to the episodes that ends up contributing as much to the show as the characters themselves.\n\nThe boxed set does have a few weaknesses: for one, these episodes are great in short viewing sessions, but when you sit down to watch a string of them the extremely sarcastic humor tends to be a bit much. Secondly, not all of the jokes are winners. When you have a dozen gags a minute, the comedic pacing is bound to be uneven. It seems that Warners has chosen to package the first two seasons together (minus the last three episodes of season two), thus the \"Volume 1\" title replaces the typical season-specific designation.\n\nAs with all great animation, this show will appeal to the kids lying on their stomach on the floor in front of the TV as well as the parents watching from the couch. The episodes aren't meant to be watched en masse as the sarcasm becomes annoying, but in short spurts most of these episodes will have you proclaiming \"Narf!\" and \"Yeahssss!\" in no time.\n\n(Kids trying to take over the world are advised to take notes).\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nEach of the episodes are presented in their original 1.33:1 fullscreen broadcast ratio. As with the recently released Animaniacs set, the video here is less than perfect. The main issue is due to aging: colors look faded and dirt and scratches pop up every now and then.\n\nYou'll also pick up some macroblocking in some of the backgrounds and there is some shimmer around certain edges. However, there is little noticeable aliasing. While it is expected that a show from the '90s (i.e. when animation cels were still hand-drawn) will have some rough edges, Pinky and the Brain's first outing has a few more defects than the average release. Not enough to distract the casual viewer, however.\n\nScore: 4 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nIt seems odd that Warners would make sure that the audio comes across better than the video, but it's appreciated nonetheless. Yup, we've got a 5.1 mix for Pinky and the Brain. On the whole, it sounds very good. Instrumental music comes across very nicely from all speakers and sound is crisp and clean. While there aren't that many positional effects, try listening to the stealth fighter sequences in Plan Brain From Outer Space and you'll get a nice immersive experience across the entire soundstage.\n\nBoth 5.1 and regular stereo tracks are available (in English) in addition to a Portuguese language track. While no English subtitles are available, people who speak French, Spanish, or Portuguese can jot down notes on how they can take over the world themselves by reading along with the episodes: \"Ouuuiiii!\"\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nPackaging and Extras\n\nThe twenty-two episodes from the first and second seasons are spread across four discs. The discs are housed in inset plastic pages (two per page) in a cardboard booklet. This is then housed in a cardboard slipcover.\n\nThe packaging is attractive, printed on solid cardboard stock with fine bumpy text. The overall design goes along nicely with the Animaniacs box.\n\nNow we've only got one featurette as the sole extra on this release, but that isn't anything to complain about as this thing is very good. Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering? (25:39) goes above and beyond what is seen on normal \"making of\" featurettes - as an added bonus, it's in anamorphic widescreen. Not only is it nearly half an hour long, but it features interviews with most of the key figures behind the series. You've got a pair of producers and the main voice actors (Maurice LaMarche as \"The Brain\" and Rob Paulsen as \"Pinky\") along with voice director Andrea Romano to guide you down memory lane. It's always a hoot seeing a normal-looking voice actor break out their character voice.\n\nYou'll hear a good deal of interesting facts concerning the show's development. It appears that originally the show didn't have any catchphrases, but after going over the first script the writers decided that they liked certain sayings so much they would bring them back. We've also got the writers talking about Spielberg's involvement with the series and how everything that was sent to him at Amblin (his production company) had to go through several levels of clearance, but the animation stuff went directly to him right away. The only thing missing is some words from Spielberg himself.\n\nWhile one featurette isn't much, it certainly counts for a lot if it is informative and entertaining. Commentaries for a show like this aren't necessary, but getting some more on the animation/writing process or perhaps something on the wonderful musical scores on future sets would be great."
