They recognize several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n\nThe following is a list of awards and nominations received by American filmmaker Steven Spielberg.\n\nSpielberg is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He began his career in the New Hollywood era and is currently the most commercially successful director. Spielberg is the recipient of various awards including three Academy Awards (with two for Best Director), two British Academy Film Awards, twelve Emmy Awards, nine Golden Globe Awards, three Directors Guild of America Awards, and seven Producers Guild of America Awards. He also received a Kennedy Center honor, a Cecil B. DeMille Award, and an AFI Life Achievement Award.\n\nSpielberg is known for such blockbuster films as Jaws (1975), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Jurassic Park (1993) and the Indiana Jones series (1981-present). Spielberg later explored drama in The Color Purple (1985) and Empire of the Sun (1987). Spielberg cemented his status as a serious filmmaker with the holocaust drama Schindler's List (1993), and the World War II epic Saving Private Ryan (1998). Spielberg continued in the 2000s with science fiction, including A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), Minority Report (2002) and War of the Worlds (2005). He has since directed several fantasy films including The Adventures of Tintin (2011), and Ready Player One (2018), the historical dramas War Horse (2011), Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015), The Post (2017), and the musical West Side Story (2021).\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result Ref. 1978 Best Director Close Encounters of the Third Kind Nominated [1] 1982 Best Director Raiders of the Lost Ark Nominated 1983 Best Picture E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Nominated [2] Best Director Nominated 1986 Best Picture The Color Purple Nominated [3] 1994 Schindler's List Won [4] Best Director Won 1999 Best Picture Saving Private Ryan Nominated [5] Best Director Won 2006 Munich Nominated [6] Best Picture Nominated 2007 Letters from Iwo Jima Nominated [7] 2012 War Horse Nominated [8] 2013 Lincoln Nominated [9] Best Director Nominated 2016 Best Picture Bridge of Spies Nominated [10] 2018 The Post Nominated [11] 2022 West Side Story Nominated [12] Best Director Nominated 2023 Best Picture The Fabelmans Nominated [13] Best Director Nominated Best Original Screenplay[a] Nominated 2024 Best Picture Maestro Nominated\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result Ref.
