        "text": "Nearly 20 years after it ended in 1998, Animaniacs is ready to get zany to the max once again. The Warner Bros. animated series is being revived by Hulu and already has a two-season commitment from the streaming service. Based on the art released by Hulu, which you can see below, it looks like the revival will include fan-favorite characters Pinky and the Brain.\n\nWhat's more, the revival also brings the entire libraries of the original series, Pinky & the Brain, Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain, and Tiny Toon Adventures to Hulu. In fact, each of those shows is available right now on the service, if you want to start preparing yourself for the new season. They join a long list of other shows and movies to arrive on Hulu in January. Sadly, new Animaniacs episodes aren't expected to arrive until 2020.\n\nSteven Spielberg, who served as executive producer and namesake on the original series, which was called Steven Spielberg's Animaniacs, will return to that role in the revival. \"I am so pleased and proud that Animaniacs will have a home at Hulu,\" he says in a statement. \"Together with Warner Bros., we look to bring new audiences and longtime fans into this wild world of Yakko, Wakko, and Dot.\"\n\nThere's no word on who from the show's original cast will be returning. However, Maurice LaMarche (The Brain) tweeted a link to the announcement on Twitter, writing, \"Guess I can talk about this now...\""
