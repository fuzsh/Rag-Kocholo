        "text": "I have to give the vote to Freakazoid!, as the first season really set up my sense of humour.\n\nI think I'll do the same. Pinky and the Brain for me is more consistent show but Freakazoid! just goes to very odd places with it's humor and most of the time it works.\n\nedit. I wonder if Animaniacs were big in Europe. Feels like most of the love it gets comes from US, but I could be dead wrong with this assumption.\n\nI never got Animaniacs and I still wonder if the show was more of America thing or if it was popular outside of US as well.\n\nMost people that I know would rank Pinky and Brain as number one by big margin then probably Tiny Toons and then Animaniacs. Before internet I had no idea how popular Animaniacs was.\n\nInteresting! Maybe it was bigger in America than other territories. Never considered that the other shows would appeal more internationally.\n\nWatching some clips, the humor does rely on some more American centric pop-culture references- but I thought the language of being relentless trolls was universal :P\n\nView: https://youtu.be/Hps_NyqEyKk\n\nI think the Countries of the World and States songs gave it extra staying power. I remember these segments airing on their own constantly:\n\nView: https://youtu.be/V1508wboZXk\n\nView: https://youtu.be/bx6c_EefZAQ\n\nedit. I wonder if Animaniacs were big in Europe. Feels like most of the love it gets comes from US, but I could be dead wrong with this assumption.\n\nI'm from the UK, and Animaniacs was popular here at least.\n\nFreakazoid was the one that was hardly ever on over here, or if it was it was on cable or Sky. I only ever caught a handful of episodes of Freakazoid: I didn't mind it, but it was nowhere near as good as the rest for me.\n\nAnimaniacs is my favourite though, closely followed by Pinky and the Brain. I never cared for Tiny Toon Adventures that much, and as I said, I never really watched Freakazoid. I preferred the other two non Spielberg 90s Looney Tunes spin offs, so Taz-Mania and Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, if we're talking about WB animations 90s output in general (but not the superhero stuff).\n\n...\n\nI'm from the UK, and Animaniacs was popular here at least.\n\nFreakazoid was the one that was hardly ever on over here, or if it was it was on cable or Sky.

I really should re-watch Animaniacs. Maybe I have disconnection with the show because back in the day I couldn't understand many of the pop culture reverences.\n\nI never got Animaniacs and I still wonder if the show was more of America thing or if it was popular outside of US as well.\n\nMost people that I know would rank Pinky and Brain as number one by big margin then probably Tiny Toons and then Animaniacs. Before internet I had no idea how popular Animaniacs was.\n\nWasn't Pinky and the Brain part of Animaniacs episodes? If you watched one, you had to watch the other.\n\nAnimaniacs is objectively the best, but I'll always have a soft spot for Freakazoid!. Props to CN in the late 90s for realizing that show had potential and introducing it to a larger audience than could have ever discovered it on Kids WB. (Huggbees!)\n\nAs for an episode of Animaniacs I don't really see discussed that much, but is one I absolutely love... \"This Pun for Hire\" is 7 minutes of rapid-fire writing and gags with a murder mystery motif. Seasons 3 to 5 weren't as consistently good as what came before but that episode is one of my favorites.\n\nI always thought Pink and the Brain was part of the Animaniacs anyway.\n\nFrench here, I watched all of these back then.\n\nTiny toons Adventures was the most popular by far.\n\nI'm pretty sure it stayed in syndication here far longer too.\n\nI really liked Freakazoid but it was like a shooting star, if you missed an episode it was probably gone for good.\n\nI think I preferred Tiny Toons when I was a kid, I would probably prefer Freakazoid now, can't say I'd have much patience for Animaniacs now.\n\nAlso for me they're pretty different from the shows you probably had since everything was dubbed and dubbed competently enough that we wouldn't be able to tell it wasn't meant to be watched in that language."
