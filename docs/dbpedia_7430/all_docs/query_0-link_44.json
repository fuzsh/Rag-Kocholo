        "text": "During a virtual panel this afternoon at New York Comic Con, Warner Bros. Animation presented the first extended look at animation from its Animaniacs reboot.\n\nThe footage shown was the 90-second cold open from the first episode, a riff on Jurassic Park featuring caricatures of the cast as well as director Steven Spielberg, who also happens to be the executive producer of Animaniacs. The footage starts at the 18:40 mark:\n\nLast week we took an in-depth look at how the look of the Animaniacs has evolved for the new series, and the subtle design tweaks that the artists have made while retaining the feel of the original show. Looking at this footage, the characters and animation feel authentic, to a fault, to the original production.\n\nThe series has received a two-season order totalling 26 episodes. New episodes will launch November 20th on Hulu.\n\nShowrunners on the new series are Wellesley Wild (executive producer) and Gabe Swarr (co-executive producer). Additionally, Steven Spielberg returns as executive producer of the series, with Sam Register, president, Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series, and Amblin Television co-presidents Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank also serving as executive producers. The series is produced by Amblin Entertainment in association with Warner Bros. Animation."
