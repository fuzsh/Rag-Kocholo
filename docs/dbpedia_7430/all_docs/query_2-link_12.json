        "text": "American filmmaker Steven Spielberg has been wholeheartedly embraced by both mainstream audiences and critics throughout his long and prolific career. Having made a number of modern classics, going all the way back to 1975's \"Jaws,\" Spielberg is universally regarded by both his peers and film historians as one of the greatest American filmmakers in the history of the medium. Born in Cincinnati and raised primarily in Phoenix, Arizona, Spielberg began making super 8 short films when he was still in his teens. At 16 he made his first feature length film, the science fiction adventure film \"Firelight\" (1963). His 1971 made-for-TV road thriller \"Duel\" proved to be the break he needed to make the leap into movies. After the success of \"Duel,\" Spielberg directed the critically acclaimed crime drama \"Sugarland Express\" (1974), which starred Goldie Hawn. It was his next film about a renegade great white shark off the coast of a New England resort town that would make the phrase \"blockbuster\" practically identical with Spielberg's name. Released in the summer of 1975, \"Jaws,\" which was made for $9 million dollars, grossed over $470 million at the box office, making it one of the most financially successful films ever, up until that point. The film was also nominated for Best Picture and took home three Academy Awards. For Spielberg, the success of \"Jaws\" would prove to be just the start of one of the most charmed filmmaking careers in Hollywood history. Over the next several decades he directed a wide array of universally beloved films that are now considered modern classics. These films include, but are not limited to: \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977), \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), \"ET the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982), \"Schindler's List\" (1993), \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) \"Lincoln\" (2012). In addition to directing, Spielberg was also a prolific producer. Throughout his six decades in show business, Spielberg produced over 150 film and television projects. Furthermore, he's also taken home three Academy Awards, and has received scores of other nominations for his film and television work. In 2018 Spielberg directed his 32nd feature length film, \"Ready Player One.\" The film was an adaptation of a popular 2011 science fiction novel by Ernest Cline, and was well-received by both critics and audiences. Spielberg's films remain benchmarks in terms of special, visual and sound effects, as well as in the public reaction they arouse."
