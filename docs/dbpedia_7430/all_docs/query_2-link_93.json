        "text": "by Wendy Jackson\n\nBabes in Toyland. © 1997 MGM Home Entertainment.\n\n`Tis the season for animated home videos....and plenty of them. From theatrical re-releases and re-packaged television content, to original direct-to-video fare, the relatively young home video market is booming. Distributors increasingly find themselves competing not only with each other, but with other venues of entertainment. With the veritable cornucopia of animated fare currently on cable television and in theaters, it's tough to get kids' attention at this time of year.\n\nThis fall, home video distributors will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on television and newspaper advertising, most of it aimed towards gift-buying parents. Tie-ins, rebates and cross-promotions catch consumers in daily life, with a wave of restaurant, grocery store, shopping mall, airline and even elementary school partnerships. Going for those point-of-purchase sales, many distributors are even offering toys attached to packaging, and elaborate in-store displays with coloring books, buttons and posters.\n\nThis month, we sat down with a crate full of video tapes and a bowl of popcorn to explore this market. Here's a sampling of the latest new animated home video offerings, and a sneak peek at what's coming soon to a video store near you.\n\nWhat's New\n\nBabes in Toyland\n\nThe first feature-length animated musical adaptation of the classic book, Babes in Toyland is a fun and charming twist on classic nursery rhyme tales. Based on the operetta by Victor Herbert and the book by Toby Bluth, Babes in Toyland tells the story of cherubic orphans Jack and Jill (of went-up-the-hill fame), and their adventure to save \"Toyland\" from their own Gargamel-esque, crotchety uncle Barnaby. With its surreal, vividly colorful animation of various anthropomorphic toys, machines, tableware and even a cow jumping over a talking moon, the film is worth watching for the visuals alone. If that's not enough of an incentive, get it to hear the character voices by James Belushi, Jonathan Dern and even Charles Nelson Reilly.\n\nThe film is a remarkable accomplishment, in that it is the first made for home video title from MGM's three year-old animation production division, MGM Animation. Their first two titles, All Dogs Go To Heaven I and II, had theatrical runs before their respective home video releases. Premiering on video last month, Babes in Toyland was co-directed by Charles Grosvernor, Toby Bluth and Paul Sabella (Sabella served as one of four co-producers as well). In addition, Toby Bluth served as production designer, and his book, Babes in Toyland, provided a style guide for the film; and, yes, he is the brother of director Don Bluth whose Anastasia is released theatrically this month.\n\nDistribution Available Price Run Time Rating Tie-Ins MGM Home Entertainment 10/24/93 $19.98 80 min.

Since her mother is an angel, and her father is a rarely-seen seafaring pirate, she lives in her father's house, with her pet horse and monkey, using her super strength, singing and taking what she needs from the overflowing chest of gold in the attic. Pippi's irreverent, creative character shines when her carefree lifestyle is cramped by two bumbling bad guys attempting to steal her gold. Meanwhile a nosy town busybody, Mrs. Prysselius, tries to send her to a \"children's home.\" The first full-length animated musical feature based on the classic children's book by Astrid Lindgren, the film features five original songs which are not very inspired. However, one in particular does really stick in your head, \"Hello, I'm Pippi!\"\n\nPippi Longstocking was released in U.S. movie theaters starting in August, and will be released in video stores on November 25. The film is a co-production between Nelvana (Canada), AB Svensk Filmindustri (Sweden), Iduna Produktiongesellschaft GmbH & Co and TFC Trickompany Filmproduktion GmbH (Germany). It was directed by Clive Smith, co-founder of Nelvana, a company known for masterminding complicated co-productions, and for adapting children's books into animated properties. With three studios, nine producers and the book's original author, who turns 90 years-old this month, involved in the production, keeping Pippi on track was no small task. \"It was very complicated, not just from a production point of view, but also from a creative point of view,\" said director Clive Smith. \"In fact, we had production going on in about 12 different cities. I was literally running around the world for three years!\"\n\nNelvana has recently expanded to include a feature films division, headed by supervising producer Merle Anne Risley. The studio's next project is Babar: King of the Elephants, a direct-to-video title slated for completion in 1998. Several other films are currently in development.\n\nDistribution Available Price Run Time Rating Tie-Ins Warner Bros. Home Video 11/24/93 19.96 75 min.

The sequential releases of The Land Before Time videos can almost serve as a measurement of the passing time. It's hard to believe that a whole year has gone by since the last one was released. In December, the fourth direct-to-video sequel to Steven Spielberg's 1988 animated theatrical feature, The Land Before Time, will be released directly to home video. So far, the six-title franchise (which includes a Sing-Along-Songs title) has amassed consumer sales of over $480 million. The character design in these films is an accomplishment in itself, in that dinosaurs, which are more or less giant prehistoric lizards, can be depicted as so, well, cute and cuddly.\n\nThe Land Before Time: The Mysterious Island takes us on a toddler adventure with the little tyke dinosaurs Chomper, Littlefoot, and friends. After \"swarming leaf gobblers\" devour the food supply, the entire dinosaur clan embarks on a journey in search of food. The animation in this film is quite good, with full movement and expressive characters. Universal's producer/director Charles Grosvernor and Overseas Animation Supervisor Richard Forgues worked with their US staff and Akom Productions in Korea. Additional work was contracted to Galaxy World (Korea), Inventaria (Spain), Funbag Animation Studios (Canada) and Heart of Texas (USA). The film includes three new songs music scored by Michael Tavera, to lyrics by Michele Brourman and Amanda McBroom, who also scored the previous Land Before Time titles.\n\nDistribution Available Price Run Time Rating Tie-Ins Universal Studios Home Video 12/8/93 $24.98 74 min.

Just in theatrical grosses alone, the original animated feature topped $350 million worldwide, and, to date, the film is the only animated feature ever nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. The all new, direct-to-video Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas was directed by Andy Knight and produced at Disney's facilities in Vancouver and Toronto. Disney Australia handled some animation and inbetweening as well as clean-up, checking, and digital ink and paint on Toon Boom software. Wang Film Productions created additional backgrounds, and additional animation was contracted to Chuck Gammage Animation and Character Builders.\n\nFreshness is added to the story with three new characters: Angelique, a treetop ornament (voiced by Bernadette Peters), Forte, an evil pipe organ (Tim Curry) and Fife, an insecure piccolo (Paul Reubens, formerly known as Pee Wee Herman). All the other characters are voiced by the same actors as appeared in the first theatrical film.\n\nDistribution Available Price Run Time Rating Tie-Ins Walt Disney Home Video 11/10/93 $26.99 70 min.

But, as any good marketer will tell you, Annabelle's Wish is likely to sell plenty of units.\n\nAn association with the charitable Make-A-Wish Foundation, and a bevy of promotional tie-ins make Annabelle's Wish the consumer-friendliest title of the season. Based on a short story by Dan Henderson, the film tells the story of a mute, orphaned little farm boy, whose wish is to speak, and a baby cow named Annabelle, whose wish is to be one of Santa's Reindeer. The boy's wicked aunt (vaguely reminiscent of Cruella DeVil) and a handful of local bullies challenge the magic of the Christmas season, but in the end, their wishes do come true.\n\nThis is the first animated film from independent producer Ralph Edwards Films, the newly formed division of Ralph Edwards Productions, producer of television shows such as This is Your Life and The People's Court. The film was animated by Studio City, California-based Baer Animation, a contract studio which does both feature (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, The Lion King) and commercial work.\n\nDistribution Available Price Run Time Rating Tie-Ins Hallmark Home Entertainment 10/20/93 $12.95 54 min not rated Mrs. Fields Cookies Golden Books Novus Credit Cards Previews at 144 shopping mall Santa Claus booths Elementary school activity sheets Make-A-Wish Foundation Float in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Rising Tide/Blue Eye Records Point of purchase promotional plush toy\n\nScooby Doo Goes to Hollywood.\n\n© 1997 Warner Bros. Home Video.\n\nScooby Doo Goes to Hollywood\n\nScooby Doo Goes to Hollywood is an older Hanna-Barbera television production from the studio's doldrum days. Since acquiring the rights from the Turner library, the film is being released on video for the first time through Warner Bros. Home Video division. In the film, Shaggy serves as Scooby's agent, shopping the clumsy dog around Hollywood, with some great parodies such as The Sound of Scooby and Scooby's Angels. Zoinks! If only poor Scooby really did have an agent, maybe Warner Bros. would have kept this film in the vault, where it belongs.\n\nDistribution Available Price Run Time Rating Tie-Ins Warner Bros.

Doug's Secret Christmas will also air on December 13, as part of a special Brand Spanking New Doug matinee program block on ABC.

The script was written by John P. Loy, who has penned numerous scripts for animated television series such as Porchlight Entertainment's The Book of Virtues and Warner Bros.' Pinky and the Brain before entering a multi-year deal with Universal Cartoon Studios to write, develop and produce animated projects. Originally slated for a mid-October release, the film has been pushed back to January, where it will face fewer competitors, but will miss out on holiday sales. \"We want the finished product to be of the finest quality,\" said Louis Feola, President of Universal Home Video. \"As often happens with an animated feature, more time was needed to complete the film.\"\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being made on the film, a Hercules and Xena road tour is now trekking around the U.S., featuring a traveling exhibit of paraphernalia from the live-action show, previews of the interactive games and an inside look at the production of the animated feature.\n\nDistribution Available Price Run Time Rating Tie-Ins Universal Studios Home Video 1/5/94 $19.98 90 min. not rated Sound Source Interactive Universal live-action television series Road tour Universal Consumer Products Tropicana Juices Topps Comics Carl's Jr. Restaurants Hercules & Xena fan conventions\n\nThe King and I\n\nThe first feature-length animated adaptation of the Broadway musical, The King and I, is now in production through Morgan Creek Entertainment.
