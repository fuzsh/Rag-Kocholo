        "text": "Of all the characters from my most favorite show, Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs, only three rank in my most favorite. Those three also inspired me to create my own group of characters, 56 of them, that look like them, but with their own colors and personalities, as well as writing my own script for a sequal to Wakko's Wish, which introduces two of those characters, and one of the two characters' 8 Siberian tiger \"pets.\" You might be able to tell which three because of the picture of one on the right-that's right, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot Warner.\n\nThe Warner Sibs have a personality that makes them loveable and adorable, the true \"Animaniacs,\" and probably the most favorite characters (other than Pinky and the Brain) of any Animaniacs fan, like myself. The Warners also have the personality that gives a true definition of \"insane\" in that they cannot be controlled and will often misunderstand certian phrases and act immature. They drive anyone they come in contact with crazy, which makes those who have to constantly live with the Warners' mayhem every day, such as the CEO Thaddeus Plotz, Hello Nurse, and Dr. Scratchansniff, end up going nuts themselves because they cannot figure out how to control them or \"de-zanytize\" them. But eventually, the Warners' charm can make anyone who hated them start to like them...and they are rarely afraid of anything...except Elmyra, that is (ep. \"Lookit The Cute Fuzzie Heads\").\n\nThe Warners can appear out of nowhere, out of desk drawers, coffee cups, books, water glasses, from the ceiling, pails, trash cans, buckets-anything that makes it easy for them to get around. They also can move from one place to another without being seen or heard, which makes some people go nuts by just that (ex. the episode \"Hearts of Twilight\"). They are always finding new ways to escape from their water tower home and often do run throughs from other cartoon characters' episodes on Animaniacs. As Dot said in Survey Ladies, \"See it's a running gag thing. I think everybody gets the idea now.\""
