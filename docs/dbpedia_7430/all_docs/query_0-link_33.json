        "text": "By JENNIKA INGRAM | Reporter\n\n“The Animaniacs” long-anticipated return is coming to fruition, and it was recently revealed that the trio’s original actors would be returning to their roles.\n\nPalisadian Steven Spielberg is serving as executive producer for a reboot of the popular ’90s animated television series, which is slated to return on Hulu this fall.\n\nThe Daytime Emmy Award-winning series ran from 1993 to 1998, with all 99 of the original episodes now available to watch on Hulu.\n\n“The Animaniacs,” a variety show with short skits, follows three inseparable Warner siblings who cause trouble with everyone they meet.\n\nThe upcoming two new seasons will include the original voice cast for the main characters: Brothers Yakko and Wakko will be voiced by Rob Paulsen and Jess Harnell, and their sister Dot by Tress MacNeille.\n\nTwo other popular characters in the series are Pinky and the Brain, two lab mice seeking world domination. They are back as well, after earning their own spin-off, “Pinky and the Brain,” which aired on The WB.\n\nPinky is also voiced by Paulsen and the Brain by Maurice LaMarche. Terry Crews narrates and voices Ralph the Guard, Bernadette Peters is Rita and Trey Parker (“South Park”) voices seven characters.\n\nAmblin Entertainment’s television division, Warner Bros. Animation and Hulu partnered on the reboot, giving Hulu the exclusive home for the original series, as well as “Pinky and the Brain,” “Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain” and “Tiny Toon Adventures.”\n\n“Tiny Toon Adventures” inspired the spin-off original “Animaniacs” series.\n\nSpielberg is acting as executive producer, along with Sam Register, president of Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series, and Amblin Television Co-Presidents Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank.\n\n“The Animaniacs” original series created by Tom Ruegger aired for two seasons on Fox Kids from 1993 to 1995 before moving to Kids’ Warner Bros. for three seasons from 1995 to 1998. Each episode runs 21 minutes.\n\nSpielberg came up with the concept to feature an original musical score in every episode. The original series used a 35-piece orchestra and seven composers.\n\nSpouses and film score composers Julie and Steven Bernstein, who won Emmy Awards for music in the original series, are also on board for the new project."
