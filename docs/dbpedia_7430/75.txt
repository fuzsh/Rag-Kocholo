Pinky and the Brain is an American animated television series. It was the first animated television series to be presented in Dolby Surround sound and the fourth collaboration of Steven Spielberg with his production company, Amblin Entertainment, and produced by Warner Bros. Animation. The characters first appeared in 1993 as a recurring segment on Animaniacs, but were given their own show due to their popularity. The show was cancelled in 1998 along with Animaniacs and ended with a total of 65 episodes divided along 4 seasons. One year later, they appeared in the series, Steven Spielberg Presents Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain, but that series was cancelled due to low ratings. Despite given their own show, the characters still appeared on segments of Animaniacs, just not as much as they used to.

Pinky and Brain are genetically enhanced laboratory mice who reside in a cage in the Acme Labs research facility. Brain is self-centered and scheming; Pinky is good-natured but feebleminded. In each episode, Brain devises a new plan to take over the world which ultimately ends in failure: usually due to Pinky's idiocy, the impossibility of Brain's plan, Brain's own arrogance, or just circumstances beyond their control.
