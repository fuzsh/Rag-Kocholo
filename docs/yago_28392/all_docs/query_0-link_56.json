        "text": "Iurii Vasilievich (30 Oct 1532-25 Nov 1563), prince ruler of Uglich. He was deaf and mute.\n\nYuri Vasilievich (Юрий Васильевич) (30 October 1532 – 24 June 1563) of the House of Rurik, was Prince of Uglich, and the second son of Vasily III of Russia and Elena Glinskaya, as well as being the younger brother of Ivan the Terrible. He was born deaf mute, and was thus never considered to be a candidate as heir to the Russian throne.\n\nHe was a year and a half old when his father died of a leg abscess, and six when his mother was apparently poisoned. According to letters written by his older brother Ivan, the two children customarily felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the Shuisky and Belsky families. Unlike his brother who spent his spare time in learning theology, Yuri was apparently only interested in food and games. Yuri accompanied his brother during the latters coronation as Tsar, and was later given a private residence with servants. On 16 June 1552, during the Russo-Kazan war, Yuri was given full charge of state affairs while his brother accompanied the army to Kazan. Yuri married in 1558 to Princess Ulyana of Palekh (Paletskaya) and had a son, Vasili, in 1560. The child died 11 months later.\n\nYuri died three years later from natural causes. His wife was sent to the Novodevichy Convent. Yuri's property was inherited by his elder brother."
