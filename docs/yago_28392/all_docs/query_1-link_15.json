        "text": "Background to the Origins of the first Great North War part Three\n\nJohn, King of Denmark\n\nJohn, also known as Hans; né Johannes (2 February 1455 – 20 February 1513) was King of Denmark (1481–1513), Norway (1483–1513) and as John II of Sweden (1497–1501) in the Kalmar Union, and also Duke of Schleswig and Holstein. The three most important political goals of King John seem to have been the restoration of the Kalmar Union, reduction of the dominance of the Hanseatic League and the building of a strong Danish royal power.\n\nDuring the first years of his rule he carried on a balancing policy. By diplomatic means he tried to weaken the position of the Swedish regent Sten Sture, and he also sought new allies – he was the first Danish king to have established a political co-operation with Russia. After the 1493 treaty, Ivan III of Russia imprisoned all Hanseatic merchants trading in Novgorod and instigated the Russo-Swedish War (1496–1499). The Hanseatic cities were also troubled by a secret war by Danish privateers. At that time the position of the Hansabund was also slowly but steadily declining because of the changes in trade routes and the growing opposition against the Hanseatic League in the Northern European naval states.\n\nJohn's domestic politics were marked by an economic support of the Danish merchants and by a widespread use of commoners as officials and even as councillors, something which angered the nobility. The most important of his initiatives was perhaps establishing a permanent Danish navy, one which came to play a role during his later years.\n\nOn 6 October 1497, John conquered Sweden during a short and effective military campaign after in advance having undermined the position of Sten Sture by winning most of the Swedish nobility. Sten surrendered to King John in Stockholm and was reconciled with him. John was crowned King of Sweden, and Sten was given the highest position of authority in Sweden below the King.\n\nIn 1500, John made a fatal attempt at conquering Dithmarschen in Schleswig-Holstein, an area which the kings of Denmark had long viewed as belonging to their realm, but which was in reality an independent peasant republic. Together with his brother Frederick, he carried through a large-scale campaign based upon an army of German mercenaries, but the Ditmarshers caught most of the army in a trap after having opened the dykes of the low-land area and flooded the narrow main road.\n\nThe defeat hurt John’s prestige, and in 1501, Sweden renounced him as king. John fought an increasingly more bitter war against Sten Sture and his successor Svante Nilsson, and this conflict meant frictions with both the Danish nobility and the Hanseatic cities, especially Lübeck. In 1509, with the Netherlands acting as arbiters, Sweden agreed to a declaration which recognised John as king of Sweden in principle, but he was never allowed into Stockholm as long as he lived, nor crowned king of Sweden anew.\n\nThe Hanseatic City of Lübeck\n\nAround 1200 the port became the main point of departure for colonists leaving for the Baltic territories conquered by the Livonian Order and, later, Teutonic Order. In 1226 Emperor Frederick II elevated the town to an Imperial Free City, becoming the Free City of Lübeck. In the 14th century Lübeck became the \"Queen of the Hanseatic League\", being by far the largest and most powerful member of this mediaeval trade organization. In 1375, Emperor Charles IV. named Lübeck one of the five \"Glories of the Empire\", a title shared with Venice, Rome, Pisa and Florence. Several conflicts about trade privileges were fought by Lübeck and the Hanseatic League against Denmark and Norway with varying outcomes.\n\nThe Russo-Swedish War of 1495–1497 was a result of an alliance between Ivan III of Russia and Hans of Denmark, who was waging war against the Sture family of Sweden in the hope of regaining the Swedish throne. It is believed that Hans promised to concede some stretches of Finnish lands to the Russian monarch, although he did not bother to honour the agreement after he had been crowned King of Sweden at the close of the war.\n\nPursuant to the agreement, Ivan III sent Princes Daniil Shchenya and Vasily Shuisky to lay siege to the Swedish castle of Viborg. The siege lasted for three months and ended when a castellan set his supply of powder on fire, thus \"scaring the Muscovites out of their wits\", as the Swedish records say . The following year Russian generals Vasily Kosoy and Andrey Chelyadnin severely devastated Swedish Finland as far as Hämeenlinna (Tavastehus). Another detachment sailed along the shore, forcing the Finns into subservience.\n\nSten Sture the Elder, who was then at Turku (Åbo), was enraged at the news of the Russian expedition and sent Svante Nilsson with 2,000 men to take Ivangorod, a new fortress which Ivan III had built to protect Russian Ingria against Livonian Knights. The fortress was taken without difficulty, but — as it was obviously impossible to defend it for a considerable period of time — Svante Nilsson proposed to hand it over to the Knights, an offer which they declined. Thereupon the Swedes set the fortress ablaze and sailed home.\n\nAfter the Swedish throne fell to Hans of Denmark, hostilities were suspended until 1508, when Sweden and Russia ratified a peace treaty for 60 years.\n\nHanseatic League\n\nThe Hanseatic League (also known as the Hanse or Hansa) was an economic alliance of trading cities and their guilds that dominated trade along the coast of Northern Europe in the later Middle Ages. It stretched from the Baltic to the North Sea and inland during the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (c.13th–17th centuries). The Hanseatic cities had their own legal system and furnished their own protection and mutual aid, and thus established a sort of political autonomy and in some cases created political entities of their own.\n\nAt the start of the 16th century the League found itself in a weaker position than it had known for many years. The rising Swedish Empire had taken control of much of the Baltic. Denmark had regained control over its own trade, the Kontor in Novgorod had closed, and the Kontor in Bruges had become effectively defunct. The individual cities which made up the League had also started to put self-interest before their common Hansa interests. Finally the political authority of the German princes had started to grow—and so constrain the independence of action which the merchants and Hanseatic towns had enjoyed.\n\nBackground to the Origins of the first Great North War final\n\nVasili III of Russia\n\nVasili III Ivanovich (Russian: Василий III Иванович , also Basil) (25 March 1479 – 3 December 1533, Moscow) was the Grand Prince of Moscow from 1505 to 1533. He was the son of Ivan III Vasiliyevich and Sophia Paleologue and was christened with the name Gavriil (Гавриил).\n\nVasili III continued the policies of his father Ivan III and spent most of his reign consolidating Ivan's gains. Vasili annexed the last surviving autonomous provinces: Pskov in 1510, appanage of Volokolamsk in 1513, principalities of Ryazan in 1521 and Novgorod-Seversky in 1522.\n\nVasili like his Predecessor Ivan III\n\nHad welcomed the new trading links with the English moscovy company,English wool clothe and Wepons, had made quite an impact in Moscow. he had even escorted sebastian Cabot back to his ships, over 600 miles away, and was awe struck by the size and coplexity of the English ships.\n\nAnd had been so impressed with the English that he had asked that they also send books and scolars on there return.\n\nThis was Done the following year, When Henry Sent Five scolars from Oxford, and a gift of 100 books and manuscripts. This wold become the foundation of the future University of Moscow Brining Renaissance education\n\nand ideas to Russia.\n\nVasili had been married to Solomonia Saburova for a few years\n\nSolomonia was descended from the Tatar khans. Her father was Yury Konstantinovich Saburov, a nobleman who was elevated to boyar upon his daughter's marriage to the monarch.\n\nYet by 1509 she had not given him any children, Conscious of her husband's disappointment, Solomonia tried to remedy this by consulting sorcerers and going on pilgrimages.\n\nSolomonia would die of an infection picked up on her last pilgrimage.\n\nshe died at midnight, 4 December 1509\n\nVasili was reportadly devastated, and had her interned in lavish style, how much of this was show or a real exspression of grief one will never know.\n\nbut Vasili was determined to find a new wife as soon as he could.\n\nNews of this reached London and the Ear of the King in the spring of 1510.\n\nMuscovite–Lithuanian Wars\n\nThe Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars (also known as Russo-Lithuanian Wars, or just either Muscovite Wars or Lithuanian Wars) were a series of wars between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, allied with the Kingdom of Poland, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In the first series of wars in the 15th century the Lithuanians gained control of a lot of Rus' territories, from Kiev to Mozhaisk, but over the course of the series of wars, particularly in the 16th century, the Russians were able to expand their domain westwards, taking control of much of the lands that were once part of Kievan Rus.\n\nThird war (1507–1508)\n\nIn 1506, Alexander died. Vasili III, who succeeded his father Ivan III in 1505, advanced his bid for the Polish throne, but Polish nobles chose Sigismund I the Old, who was crowned both as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1507, Sigismund I sent envoys to Moscow requesting Moscow to return the territories acquired by the 1503 truce. At the same time, Khan Meñli I Giray broke off his alliance with Moscow due to its campaign against Kazan. Sigismund I received an iarlyk for the Russian territories of Novgorod, Pskov, Ryazan. The war was intertwined with a rebellion of Michael Glinski, Court Marshal of Lithuania, a favorite of Alexander Jagiellon, and a man of opportunity. In 1506, Alexander was succeeded by Sigismund I the Old, who did not show the same favors to Glinski. Jan Jurjewicz Zabrzeziński, Voivode of Trakai and Glinki's old political opponent, accused Glinski of treason, poisoning of Alexander, and ambitions to become king himself. He then organized a rebellion, murdered Zabrzeziński (February 1508), and declared himself defender of the Orthodox faith (even though he was a Catholic of Mongol descent). His followers unsuccessfully attacked the Kaunas Castle in an attempt to liberate prisoner Ahmad, Khan of the Great Horde. Glinski then established himself in Turaŭ and contacted Vasili III. Glinski started retreating towards Moscow and attempted to capture Minsk, Slutsk, Mstsislaw, Krychaw. He only managed to take Mazyr when his relative opened the gates. Near Orsha, he joined with Muscovite forces, but was defeated by Konstanty Ostrogski, Grand Hetman of Lithuania. This series of defeats demonstrated the rebellion, despite its claims to protect the rights of the Orthodox, was not supported by the general population and did not spread. The war eventually ended with the inconclusive 'eternal peace treaty' on October 8, 1508, which maintained the territorial accords of the 1503 truce\n\nAlbert, Duke of Prussia\n\nAlbert of Prussia (German: Albrecht; Latin: Albertus) (16 May 1490 – 20 March 1568) was the 37th Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights and, after converting to Lutheranism, the first duke of the Duchy of Prussia, which was the first state to adopt the Lutheran faith and Protestantism as the official state religion. Albert proved instrumental in the political spread of Protestantism in its early stage.\n\nDuke Frederick of Saxony, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, died in December 1510. Albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle, Sigismund I the Old, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern Prussia, which had been held by the Order under Polish suzerainty since the Second Peace of Thorn (1466).\n\nThe new Grand Master, aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy, refused to submit to the crown of Poland. As war over the Order's existence appeared inevitable, Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nWhen Albert of Prussia became the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights and was unwilling to acknowledge Poland's suzerainty as required by the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). The tension eventually resulted in joining in the First great North war."
