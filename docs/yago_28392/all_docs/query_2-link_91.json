Some of the earliest titles include Kniaz and Velikiy Kniaz, which mean \"Prince\" and \"Great Prince\" respectively but are often rendered as \"Duke\" and \"Grand Duke\" in Western literature; then the title of Tsar, meaning \"Caesar\", which was disputed to be the equal of either a king or emperor; finally culminating in the title of Emperor. The full title of the Russian Emperors, according to Article 59 of the 1906 Russian Constitution, was given as:\n\nEmperor and Autocrat of all the Russias, of Moscow, Kiev, Vladimir, Novgorod, Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan, Tsar of Poland, Tsar of Siberia, Tsar of Tauric Chersonesos, Tsar of Georgia, Lord of Pskov, and Grand Duke of Smolensk, Lithuania, Volhynia, Podolia, and Finland, Prince of Estonia, Livonia, Courland and Semigalia, Samogitia, Belostok, Karelia, Tver, Yugra, Perm, Vyatka, Bulgaria and other territories; Lord and Grand Duke of Nizhni Novgorod, Sovereign of Chernigov,

forth, and so forth, and so forth.\n\nThe Patriarchs of Moscow, who are the head of Russian Orthodox Church, also have acted as the leaders of Russia from time to time, usually in periods of political upheaval as during the Polish occupation and interregnum of 1610–1613.\n\nContents\n\n1 Princes of Novgorod\n\n1.1 Legendary princes of Novgorod\n\n1.2 Novgorod Rus\n\n2 Grand Princes of Kiev (c.
