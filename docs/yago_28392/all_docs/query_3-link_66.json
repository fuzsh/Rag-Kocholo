        "text": "Career\n\nIvan was only twelve years of age when he led an army to abolish his father’s internal enemies. He was eighteen when he was also made to lead a military to fight against Tatars in the southern region. Ivan became fairly successful. After the death of his father Vasily II on 27th of March, 1462, he succeeded the position as the Grand Prince of Moscow.\n\nThere was not much activity undertaken by Ivan during the early reign of his life as the Grand Prince of Moscow. He mostly kept himself busy making and leading successful campaigns against the Tatars of Kazan. During Ivan’s reign, many Great Russian lands were still now part of the Moscow. The Polish and Lithuania Union held over the entire Ukraine and the north part of Oka district. Ivan gave himself the task of getting back his forefather’s land of Ukraine from Poland and Lithuania.\n\nOn the eastern end, through several crusades, Ivan made the Kazan Horde on the eastern side weak. These crusades were performed between 1467 and 1469. Once this was undertaken, he tried to subdue Novgorod and its vast northern empire. His recurring attack over the region forced Novgorod to give up in the year 1478. Ivan snatched their political freedom, captured its colonies and replaced many of the people from his land to his personal domain. In 1489, when it became intolerable for Novgorod, it had completely surrendered. Other Russian lands including Rostov and Yaroslavl were seized by Ivan through a treaty signed in 1474 and 1463 respectively. Of all the lands, only Ryazan and Pskov was able to maintain their independence.\n\nIvan’s next task was to make himself comparable to Khan Ahmed of the Golden Horde. He took up the alliance with Khan Mengli Girei of Crimea to stand against Khan Ahmed and his kin Poland and Lithuania. After a victorious war with Khan Ahmed in 1480, Ivan was able to take over his land and its dominion from Ahmed. He remained good in relationship with Khan Mengli Girei of Crimea which helped him remain secure and this also kept him away from the threat of Kazan. In the same year, Ivan had to put up a battle with his brothers Boris and Andrey.\n\nIvan soon had to make a decision on who would become his heir; his eldest son’s son Dmitry or the eldest son born to him by Sofia Vasily. After seven years of time, in 1497, Ivan designated Dmitry to be his successor. Covered by hatred and vengeance, Sofia planned a deadly plot against her husband but was soon uncovered. Ivan discredited Sofia and Dmitry was made the Grand Prince by Ivan in 1498. In 1500, the eldest son of Sofia revolved again. This was a time when the war with Lithuania was very important. Ivan couldn’t afford to estrange his wife and his son during this time and was forced to give the title to Vasily. Yelena and her son Dmitry were put into prison. Ivan wanted to keep the administration centralized which meant he had to take over the lands and control from young princes. Boyars, who were next in class to the Prince, were made weak by taking over all their authority and power and those suspected of disloyalty were executed.\n\nLast few years of Ivan’s reign did not go well. His war with Lithuania was not working as expected and a large part of Ukraine was still with them. His plans of freeing the church lands were dismissed during a council in 1503 and the Khanate of Kazan was able to free itself from Moscow. Ivan died in 1505 in Moscow. His death was not mourned much after. He was 65 years of age at the time of his death."
