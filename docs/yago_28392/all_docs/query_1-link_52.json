        "text": "Years of life: about 1508 - April 4 (April 13) 1538\n\nReign: 1533-1538\n\nGrand Russian Duchess of Moscow, daughter of the Lithuanian prince. Vasily Lvovich Glinsky and his wife Anna.\n\nShe came from the princely family of the Glinskys, who, according to the genealogical legend, were the descendants of the sons of the deposed Khan Mamai, who fled to Lithuania and received the city of Glinsk as an inheritance.\n\nBiography of Elena Glinskaya\n\nIn 1526, she became the wife of the Grand Duke divorced from his 1st wife, barren Solomonia Saburova. Vasily III took Elena Glinskaya as his wife for several reasons. First, he wanted to have children by her; secondly, because on the maternal side she was descended from the Serbian Orthodox family of Petrovich, which at that time was a magnate Hungarian family that played the first roles under King Janos Zapolya; and thirdly, due to the fact that the uncle was Mikhail Glinsky, a skilled diplomat and an outstanding commander who could better than others protect his relatives if such a need arose.\n\nIn 1530, Elena Glinskaya gave birth to a son, Ivan the Terrible, and later a son, Yuri, who was \"simple in mind\" and deaf and dumb. In 1533, on his deathbed, Vasily III blessed his son Ivan and handed him the \"scepter of great Rus'\", and ordered his wife \"under his son to hold the state until his son matures.\"\n\nRegency of Elena Glinskaya\n\nSo, in 1533 - 1538. Elena Glinskaya- the ruler of Russia under the minor Ivan the Fourth.\n\nHaving become the ruler of the Grand Duchy of Moscow after the death of her husband, she vigorously suppressed the oligarchic aspirations of the boyars and successfully began the fight against real and potential opponents. Using the help and advice of his favorite boyar Prince I.F. Sheepskin-Telepnev-Obolensky, Elena Glinskaya imprisoned her uncle-rival M. Glinsky. She also imprisoned her brother Vasily III, Prince Yuri Ivanovich of Dmitrov and Prince Andrei Ivanovich of Staritsky.\n\nMonetary and other reforms of Elena Glinskaya\n\nThe most important aspect of governance is Elena Glinskaya monetary reform in 1535. A single currency was introduced on the territory of Rus'. This was a silver penny, weighing 0.68 g; one fourth of a penny is a penny. The order was given to transfuse numerous cut and fake silver coins into new ones, which depicted Grand Duke on horseback with a spear in hand. This was a significant step towards stabilizing the Russian economy.\n\nIn 1536, Elena Glinskaya forced the Polish king Sigismund the First to conclude a peace favorable to Russia, and obliged Sweden not to help Lithuania and Livonian Order. In 1537, she concluded a peace treaty with Sweden.\n\nUnder her, the strengthening and construction of cities and fortresses was carried out at the same time, especially on the western borders. So the settlement (Kitay-gorod) was surrounded by a brick wall.\n\nBoard of Elena Glinskaya\n\nThe government of Elena Glinskaya also waged a struggle against the growth of monastic landownership.\n\nElena Glinskaya, as a woman of non-Russian morals and upbringing, did not enjoy the sympathy of either the boyars or the people. Although she was very beautiful woman, cheerful in character, well educated: she knew German and Polish, spoke and wrote Latin.\n\nShe died on April 4, 1538 in Moscow. According to existing rumors, Elena Glinskaya was poisoned by the Shuiskys. These studies of the remains of the princess indicate the cause of death was poisoning with poison - mercury.\n\n1. Death of Elena Glinskaya\n\nWith the death of Prince Andrei Staritsky, the dynastic problem ceased to disturb the guardians of the young Ivan IV: the real contenders for the grand prince's throne in the person of the brothers of the late Vasily III were physically eliminated. But the \"treatment\" turned out to be no better than the \"disease\" itself. As shown in the previous chapter, the repressive measures repeatedly resorted to by the Grand Duchess during the few years of her reign seriously narrowed her support base in the court environment. Numerous relatives of the disgraced and executed could not feed good feelings to the ruler and her favorite. The treacherous reprisal against the staritsa prince - in violation of the kiss of the cross - apparently caused condemnation in society.\n\nMoods of this kind were reflected in the news from Russia, which were recorded in Livonia in the autumn of 1537. The above-mentioned Margrave Wilhelm of Brandenburg, having informed his brother, Duke of Prussia Albrecht, in a letter dated November 6 of that year, about the imprisonment of Prince Andrei in prison after an agreement with the regent of the young Grand Duke sealed with a kiss of the cross, further said that “for this treason (untrew) they paid off the Muscovites of the Tatars - by plundering and devastating many lands, castles (Schlosser) and cities, as well as ... taking away people and property (volk und guttern)\", \"repaid on such a scale (der masenn vorg?ldenn), which no one has been talking about for many years heard.\"\n\nIn the above message, the invasion of the Tatars looks like God's punishment, like a punishment sent down from above to the country for the treachery of its rulers. It is quite possible, however, that such an interpretation of events belongs to the coadjutor of the Archbishop of Riga himself. But the \"true news\" (gewisse zeitungenn) from Muscovy, which he retells in his letter, of course, contained not only facts, but also their assessment. If some chroniclers, as we remember, wrote reproachfully about the ruler’s obvious treachery, then in conversations, it must be assumed, there were much sharper judgments about the actions Grand Duchess and Prince Ivan Ovchina Obolensky, including, perhaps, fears of God's wrath.\n\nThe attitude towards the ruler was even more prominent in the reaction to her death, which occurred on April 3, 1538.\n\nLast event in the life of the Grand Duchess, which is mentioned in the official chronicle - a trip with children on a pilgrimage to the Mozhaisk Nikolsky Cathedral, which, apparently, used special attention rulers: preserved (in the list of the 17th century) a letter of commendation issued on December 16, 1536 on behalf of the Grand Duke to the archpriest of St. Nicholas Cathedral in Mozhaisk Athanasius. Elena Vasilievna with her sons Ivan and Yuri left Moscow on January 24, 1538; “Having listened to the prayer service and divine litorgy and signing herself at the holy image” in St. Nicholas Cathedral, on January 31 she returned to the capital.\n\nFurther, the chronicle speaks of the return of the Grand Duke's envoys from the Crimea and Lithuania, as well as the arrival of the Turkish embassy. Against this everyday background, the following chronicle article, entitled \"On the Repose of the Grand Duchess,\" looks completely unexpected.\n\nNoteworthy is the brevity of the early annalistic news about the death of Elena Glinskaya. So, the Resurrection Chronicle reports: “In the summer of 7046, April 3, on Wednesday, the fifth week of Holy Lent, at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, the blessed Grand Duke Vasily Ivanovich reposed, the right-believing Grand Duchess Elena, Prince Vasiliev’s daughter Lvovich Glinsky; and it was supposed to be in the Church of the Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, near Grand Duchess Sophia of Grand Duke Ivan Vasilyevich.\n\nEven shorter is the message of the Postnikovsky chronicler, who names a different date for the death of the ruler: “In the summer of April 7046, on the 2nd day, Grand Duchess Elena reposed in memory of the reverend father of our confessor Nikita, hegumen of Nicomedia, from Tuesday to Wednesday at 7 o’clock ours. And it was supposed to be in Ascension.\n\nOnly in the 50s. 16th century appears something like an obituary to the Grand Duchess. Taking as a basis the news of the Resurrection Chronicle about the repose on April 3 (it was this date that was confirmed in the annals) of “blessed Grand Duchess Elena”, the compiler of the Chronicler of the beginning of the kingdom supplemented this short message a kind of summing up the four-year reign of the widow of Vasily III: “And after the husband of her Grand Duke Vasily Ivanovich of All Russia with her son with the Grand Duke Ivan Vasilyevich of All Russia, and the power ruled the state of great Russia for four years and four months, for the sake of being young, the Grand Duke To Ivan Vasilyevich, her son, who has come one hundred years from his birth. The chronicler ends his story with a mention of the burial of Elena Vasilievna in the Ascension Monastery, in the tomb of the Grand Duchesses, next to the tomb of Sophia, the wife of Ivan III.\n\nOne gets the impression that the death of the ruler was sudden: in any case, the chroniclers do not mention a word about any illness that preceded the death of the Grand Duchess. True, R. G. Skrynnikov sees indirect evidence of her illness in Elena’s frequent trips on pilgrimage: “From 1537,” the scientist writes, “the Grand Duchess began to diligently visit monasteries for the sake of pilgrimage, which indicated a deterioration in her health.” Indeed, in specified year she twice (in June and at the end of September) went with her sons to the Trinity-Sergius Monastery. But these trips can be given a completely different explanation, without resorting to a dubious version (not supported by any sources) about a long illness from which the Grand Duchess allegedly suffered.\n\nThe fact that in the first years of her reign the young widow did not leave the capital is probably due to her concern for her sons, the youngest of whom, Yuri, was barely a year old by the time of the death of his father, Vasily III. The Grand Duchess obviously did not dare to leave the princes in the care of their mothers (recall the disturbing atmosphere of the summer of 1534 described in the second chapter of this book, rumors about the death of both boys, etc.), and traveling with small children in her arms was a risky business. Only when the sons grew up a little did pilgrimage trips begin: the chronicle specifically notes the first such trip, to the Trinity-Sergius Monastery, on June 20, 1536. It was short: two days later, the grand ducal family, accompanied by the boyars, returned to Moscow.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the monastery of St. Sergius became the object of pilgrimage: here, on September 4, 1530, Vasily III baptized his first-born. From 1537 young Ivan IV with his brother, invariably every year in September he went to the Trinity Monastery - \"to pray to the miraculous memory.\" Often he visited the Trinity twice a year (in this case, usually, in addition to September, also in May - June).\n\nThus, there was nothing unusual in the visit of Elena Glinskaya with her children to the Trinity Monastery in June and September 1537: such trips were already becoming a tradition in the grand ducal family. On the other hand, perhaps, an “unscheduled” trip to Mozhaisk at the end of January 1538 was dictated by concern about health - “to pray to the image of the holy great miracle worker Nikola”. But even if we connect this pilgrimage with the deteriorating health of the empress (and, as already mentioned, we do not have direct evidence of this), then we must admit that the illness of the Grand Duchess was transient: two months later Elena Vasilievna died.\n\nThe death of the ruler, who was not even thirty years old, gave rise to rumors about her poisoning. This version of events is well known to historians in the presentation of Sigismund Herberstein. In his famous “Notes on Muscovy”, an Austrian diplomat, reporting the death of Prince Mikhail Glinsky in prison, adds: “... according to rumors, the widow [Elena. - M. K.] a little later she was put to death with poison, and her sheepskin seducer was cut into pieces. In the Latin edition of the Notes (1549), the poisoning of the Grand Duchess is mentioned twice: first in the chapter on Moscow court ceremonies, and then in almost the same words - in the section \"Chorography\".\n\nR. G. Skrynnikov drew attention to the changes made by Herberstein to the German edition of his book (1557): in particular, the news of the poisoning of Elena Glinskaya was removed there, which, according to the historian, is explained by the fact that the author of the Notes to At that time, \"I became convinced ... of the unfoundedness of the rumor.\" It is doubtful, however, that eighteen years after the death of the ruler, Herberstein could have received any new information that refuted the previous rumors about the poisoning of the Grand Duchess. In addition, the 1557 edition does not completely remove the news that interests us: in the chapter on ceremonies, there is indeed no mention of Elena's death from poison, but it is left unchanged in the Chorografie.\n\nHerberstein traveled to Poland in September 1539 and made numerous visits to that country in subsequent years. It is natural to assume that he learned about the April events of 1538 in Moscow from Polish dignitaries. We can judge from the letter of Stanislav Gursky, secretary of Queen Bona, addressed to Clement Janitsky, a student at the University of Padua, about what information was available on this subject at the court of Sigismund I. This letter, dated June 10, 1538, has come down to us in one of the handwritten volumes of the collection of diplomatic documents compiled by Gursky and later called \"Acta Tomiciana\". Among other news, Gursky told the Padua schoolboy the following news: “The Grand Duke of Moscow is blinded (Dux Moschorum magnus caecus factus est), and his mother, the Grand Duchess, has died (mater vero sua dux etiam magna mortua est). God punished for the treachery of those who villainously killed their uncles and relatives-princes (patruos et consanguineos suos Duces) in order to more easily seize power (per scelus ingularunt).\n\nThe above message is interesting not because of the facts contained in it (the rumor about the blindness of Ivan IV turned out to be false, of course), but by their interpretation: the death of the Grand Duchess and the misfortune that befell her son are considered as God's punishment for the crimes they committed. “Uncles and relatives-princes” are, of course, Andrei Staritsky, Yuri Dmitrovsky, and also Mikhail Glinsky (the uncle of the Grand Duchess).\n\nThe idea of ​​retribution is also present in the story of Herberstein, who lays the blame for the death of the three princes mentioned precisely on Elena Glinskaya; this motif of retribution is especially noticeable in the section \"Chorography\": \"A little later,\" writes an Austrian diplomat, \"the cruel one herself died from poison.\"\n\nThe theme of inevitable retribution for the cruelty and treachery of the Moscow rulers runs like a red thread through the reports of foreign contemporaries discussed above about the events in Russia at the end of the 1530s. This theme is heard in the message of Margrave Wilhelm to Duke Albrecht of Prussia dated November 6, 1537, and in the work of Herberstein, and in the letter of Gursky to K. Janitsky dated June 10, 1538. The key question is, of course, whether the mentioned comments, at least to some extent, on the mood that existed then in Russia itself, or before us are only examples of the moralizing characteristic of educated Europeans of the 16th century.\n\nWe have at our disposal several direct and indirect evidence of domestic origin, which unambiguously speak of the relationship of the court elite to the late ruler. First of all, it is worth quoting the words of Ivan the Terrible from the message to Andrei Kurbsky, in which the tsar, denouncing the wickedness of his opponent’s ancestors, in particular the boyar M.V. Tuchkov, wrote: “... so is your grandfather [Kurbsky. - M. K.], Mikhailo Tuchkov, at the death of our mother, the great Empress Elena, many arrogant words were spoken about her to our deacon Elizar Tsyplyatev.\n\nBut there are also indirect signs of dislike of subjects for the Grand Duchess. It is significant, for example, that Elena's contribution to the Trinity Monastery, made on behalf of her son, Grand Duke Ivan in 1538/39, amounted to only 30 rubles. Of course, the appropriate order on behalf of the eight-year-old boy was made by one of his then guardians. In the same row is the fact noted above of the amazing brevity of the chroniclers, who honored the memory of the deceased ruler with only a few lines (meanwhile, as we remember, a lengthy and skillfully written Tale was devoted to the death of Vasily III).\n\nThus, the hostility towards Elena, at least part of the court elite, is beyond doubt. If you set famous question Roman jurists \"qui prodest?\" - who benefited from the death of the Grand Duchess in the spring of 1538, then in response you can compile a long list of relatives of the disgraced, as well as those whose parochial interests were hurt by the rise of Prince. Ivan Ovchina Obolensky. The choice of the moment for the alleged crime also speaks of the same: after the death in prison of both specific princes, the dynastic problem was removed from the agenda, and with the disappearance of applicants for the Moscow throne, the grand ducal boyars could no longer fear that their places at court would be occupied by the servants of one of \"Princes of the Blood\" On the other hand, at the beginning of 1538, Ivan IV was only seven and a half years old, which meant that the dissatisfied had to endure the ruler and her favorite for a long time, who had already managed to show their decisiveness and promiscuity in means. There are, as we see, all the conditions for the emergence of a conspiracy ...\n\nBut, of course, all these indirect considerations do not allow us to unequivocally assert that the Grand Duchess was poisoned. Historians have different attitudes to the message of Herberstein quoted above. Some prefer to cite it without comment, others consider this news to be quite trustworthy, while others, on the contrary, strongly reject it, insisting on the natural causes of the death of the ruler.\n\nIN Lately in a number of popular science publications, information has appeared that seems to confirm the rumors of almost 500 years ago. We are talking about the results of a pathological and anatomical examination of the remains of the Grand Duchesses from the necropolis of the Kremlin's Resurrection Monastery. According to T.D. Panova and her co-authors, high content arsenic and mercury, found in the bones of Elena Glinskaya, indicates that the ruler was indeed poisoned. Skeptics, however, are slow to agree with this conclusion. So, S. N. Bogatyrev emphasizes the inadequacy of our knowledge about the use of chemistry for medical and cosmetic purposes in Muscovy in the 16th century. Therefore, according to the scientist, relative indicators look more convincing than absolute figures. Meanwhile, the arsenic content in the remains of Elena Glinskaya is significantly lower than in the bones of a child from the family of the old prince Vladimir Andreevich, who is known for sure that he was poisoned by order of the tsar in 1569. At the same time, the poisoning did not affect the level of mercury in the body of the unfortunate victims.\n\nObviously, before the publication of a full scientific report on the results of the examination of the remains of Grand Duchess Elena, it would be premature to draw any final conclusions. But regardless of whether the Grand Duchess was poisoned or fell victim to some transient illness, her death dramatically changed the situation at the Moscow court. Having lost his patroness, the recent favorite lost everything: power, freedom and life itself. For those who spent the years of the reign of Elena Glinskaya in disgrace, there was a chance to re-assert themselves.\n\nIn the five years of her regency, Elena Glinskaya managed to do as much as not every male ruler manages to accomplish in decades.\n\nThe father of the powerful and cruel Tsar Ivan IV (the Terrible), the Grand Duke of Moscow Vasily III, was married twice: for the first time to Solomonia from the Saburov family, chosen from one and a half thousand noble and boyar daughters - brides. This marriage was childless, and after 20 years of marriage, Vasily III imprisoned his wife in a monastery. The Moscow prince chose the second wife \"beautiful for the sake of her face and the goodness of her age.\" She was the young beauty Princess Elena Vasilievna Glinskaya, who was not distinguished by great nobility: her ancestors were descended from Khan Mamai. An alliance with her did not promise the prince any benefits, but Elena knew how to please. Vasily was so carried away by his young wife that he was not afraid to break the custom of antiquity, “putting the lads on the brada” (that is, shaving). Four years after the wedding, Elena and Vasily had an heir, the future Tsar of All Rus' Ivan IV,\n\nHowever, the childhood of the autocratic youth was cloudless only for the first three years: in 1533 the prince's father fell ill and soon died. His last will was to transfer the throne to his son, and Vasily III ordered his “wife Olena” with the boyar council to “keep the state under his son” until he matured.\n\nQuite quickly, Grand Duchess Elena Glinskaya became the sole ruler of Russia as regent under the young Ivan.\n\nGlinskaya managed to uncover several boyar conspiracies aimed at overthrowing her, and she managed, although this required her to repeatedly disregard moral standards, to stay on the throne.\n\nIn the five years of her regency, Elena Glinskaya managed to do as much as not every male ruler manages to accomplish in decades. The Lithuanian king Sigismund was deceived in his calculations on internal unrest and impotence of a state led by a woman: in 1534 he started a war against Russia and lost it. Glinskaya's government was constantly engaged in intricate intrigues in the region. international diplomacy, trying to gain the “top” in rivalry with the Kazan and Crimean khans, who half a century ago felt like masters on Russian soil. Princess Elena Vasilievna herself negotiated and, on the advice of the faithful\n\nboyars made decisions. In 1537, thanks to her far-sighted plans, Russia concluded an agreement with Sweden on free trade and benevolent neutrality,\n\nThe domestic policy of Elena Glinskaya was also very active. Like Princess Olga, who founded in the tenth century. many new settlements, Elena Vasilievna ordered the construction of cities on the Lithuanian borders, the restoration of Ustyug and Yaroslavl, and in Moscow in 1535 Kitay-gorod was founded by the builder Peter Maly Fryazin. During the reign of Glinskaya, an attempt was made to change the system local government, which anticipated the future reforms of Ivan IV.\n\nEmigrants from other countries reached out to wealthy Muscovy; 300 families left Lithuania alone. However, the largest event domestic policy Elena Vasilievna was the monetary reform of 1535, which led to the unification of monetary circulation in the country and overcoming the consequences of fragmentation. All over Russia they began to print money with the image of a horseman with a spear, which is why the coins were called \"kopeks\".\n\nElena Glinskaya opened wide prospects. In 1538 she was only 30. She was young, ambitious, full of ideas... But on April 3 she died suddenly. Many of Glinskaya's contemporaries believed that she was poisoned, but there is no verified information about this.\n\nElena Glinskaya the great work was completed. From small, separate patches of Russian land, a large, mighty Muscovite state was forged. It was not easy for the Moscow collectors of the Russian land to accomplish this task: a lot of untruth and violence were done at the same time; but there were even more of them during specific unrest and strife. But by the beginning of the reign of Elena Glinskaya, the Muscovite state was not afraid of either Lithuania or the Horde; and the people's lives have become calmer than in the specific time.\n\nElena Glinskaya. Skull reconstruction, S. Nikitina\n\nThe power of the Moscow sovereign-autocrat also grew to unprecedented strength and height; but on the other hand, government was a heavy burden on him. The stormy evenings in Novgorod and Pskov fell silent, the people began to wean themselves from the former order, unlearned how to take care of their needs and deeds, and in other places, even earlier, commoners called themselves \"orphans\" and \"little people\" and all their hopes and hopes believed to the sovereign's mercy and protection: the people were greatly oppressed during the time of specific turmoil and Tatar pogroms and requisitions - he did not think about liberties and rights, but about daily bread and protection from violence. The more powerful the autocrat became, the more formidable he was for external enemies and boyars who committed violence to the people, the easier it was for ordinary people. “Where the king is, here is truth, and fear, and a thunderstorm,” the people began to say; but he also developed another proverb: “A king without servants, as without hands!” He needed faithful servants and helpers. The former free warriors, the boyars, without whose advice no business was done, were gone. Instead, there were boyars who tried more to \"please\" and \"strive\" the sovereign than to tell the truth. He had many obsequious servants, but few faithful servants, advisers and helpers. That is why the power of the autocrat often became the heaviest burden for him. A great misfortune threatened the entire state when Vasily III died and left behind only his young son Ivan and his wife Elena Glinskaya, without an adult heir who could take all the burden of government into his own hands. “Without a king, the earth is a widow,” the people used to say.\n\nVasily Ivanovich understood this completely. Before his death, he said to the boyars:\n\n- I order you Princess Elena and my children; serve my princess and my son, Grand Duke Ivan, and protect the Russian state and all Christianity (all the people) from all its enemies: from bermishness (Muslims) and from Latinism and from their strong people...\n\nThe dying autocrat was greatly afraid that after his death strife would begin; that the young heir and his mother Elena Glinskaya will not do well, - and said to his brothers:\n\n- You, my brothers, Prince Yuri and Prince Andrei, would stand firmly in your word, on which you kissed the cross.\n\nBoyar reminds the dying of his origin, recalls that he and his son are born sovereigns. In the event of sedition and strife, a reliable, intelligent, resolute person is needed - one whose benefits would be associated with the benefits of a minor sovereign. Vasily III sees such a support in the uncle of his wife Elena, Mikhail Glinsky.\n\n“And you, Prince Mikhailo,” the dying sovereign says to him, “for my son, Grand Duke Ivan, for my Grand Duchess Elena and for my son, Prince Yuri, shed your blood and gave your body to fragmentation.\n\nGuardianship of the child-sovereign and management of the Grand Duchy were to fall into the hands of the Grand Duchess Elena Glinskaya. Mikhail Glinsky became her closest and main adviser.\n\nVasily's fears were justified: his funeral had just taken place, and the ruler Elena Glinskaya was already informed that some boyars were plotting sedition - they wanted to put Yuri Ivanovich on the throne. By order of the Grand Duchess, he was immediately captured and imprisoned.\n\nTelepnev-Obolensky\n\nNot long and Glinsky dominated the court. In addition to him, there was another person close to the ruler Elena: it was her favorite, Prince Ivan Ovchina-Telepnev-Obolensky. Glinsky and Obolensky could not get along with each other. Elena Glinskaya had to sacrifice one of them - and her uncle Mikhail, accused of ambitious plans, was captured and put in the same ward where he had been sitting before. In prison, he died.\n\nThe reign of Elena Glinskaya and the rule of Obolensky were not at all to their liking. There was great unrest among the boyars. Several of them fled to Lithuania. Others were imprisoned for helping them. And the second uncle of little Ivan, Andrei Ivanovich, Prince Staritsky, got into trouble. He was informed that he was going to flee to Lithuania. He, sensing a thunderstorm, thought it was by force to defend himself, but succumbed to the exhortations of Prince Obolensky and the promises that no harm would be done to him, he came to Moscow to justify himself from the accusations; here, by order of Helena, he was imprisoned.\n\nThe unrest that began in Moscow during the reign of Elena Glinskaya was glad to see the Polish king Sigismund - he thought, taking advantage of the turmoil in Rus', to return again the lands taken from Lithuania under Ivan III and Vasily III. In 1534 the war began; she walked with varying happiness; but did not bring any benefit to Poland - Smolensk remained with Moscow. For a long time, the Polish ambassadors bargained with the Russians - they hoped to gain at least something, but they could not achieve anything; had to conclude a truce in 1537 on the same terms. Elena Glinskaya was glad of this truce: at that time she had to think about Kazan. Here there was a constant internal struggle: a conspiracy was formed, and Khan of Kazan Enalei, Moscow's assistant, was killed. Safa Giray, the Crimean prince, was proclaimed Khan. He began to attack Russian possessions, he was supported by the Crimean Khan.\n\nDeath of Elena Glinskaya\n\nIt was necessary to settle these matters; but in April 1538, the ruler Elena Glinskaya died unexpectedly. (There is news that she was poisoned.) The Grand Duke was only 8 years old. Boyar rule began.\n\nAfter the death of Elena Glinskaya, Telepnev-Obolensky was confused, did not know what to do, he sensed trouble over himself. Seven days have passed since the ruler passed away. Once, when Obolensky was in the room of the Grand Duke with his sister, Ivan's former mother, the soldiers came and in the name of the elder boyar and thought seized Obolensky and his sister. Little Ivan wept bitterly and begged not to be touched by his mother and her brother. No attention was paid to his requests; Obolensky and his sister were imprisoned, where he soon died; they say he was starved to death...\n\nThere is no exact data on the time of birth of Elena Glinskaya. Presumably, this is 1508. Elena's father, Vasily Glinsky, according to legend, descended from Mamai, being a descendant of one of his sons, who fled to the Principality of Lithuania and owned the city of Glinsky and neighboring Poltava and Glinitsa in the Dnieper region.\n\nIn 1526 Glinskaya married Vasily III Ivanovich. Vasily III divorced his previous wife Solomonia Saburova because of her infertility. The new wife fell in love with the prince. Despite the significant difference in age, the prince fell in love. He shaved off his beard, changed into a European dress, and even changed into red morocco boots with turned-up toes. The biography of Elena Glinskaya says that contemporaries left the following data about her: amazingly beautiful, smart, cheerful in disposition and well-educated at that time. She knew German and Polish, and spoke Latin.\n\nElena Glinskaya gave birth to two sons to the Grand Duke: Ivan and Yuri, who was deaf and dumb and \"of a simple mind.\"\n\nIn 1533, Vasily III, dying, blessed his son Ivan, handing him \"the scepter of great Rus'\", and ordered Elena \"under his son to hold the state until his son matures.\" The regency, by the will of the dying prince, was entrusted to the guardians, whom Elena Vasilievna removed from power and became the ruler of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. After Princess Olga, she was the first woman to become the head of the Russian state.\n\nAs regent for a minor heir, Princess Elena Glinskaya successfully began to pursue a policy of active struggle against the boyars and princes who opposed the central government.\n\nThe main assistance in governing the state was provided to her by Prince Ivan Fedorovich Ovchina Telepnev-Obolensky and Metropolitan Danila.\n\nDuring the years of the regency, Elena Glinskaya successfully resisted the policy of separatism of the specific princes and boyars. The monastic landholdings were noticeably curtailed.\n\nIt was under her that changes began in the organization of local self-government (lip reform). By her order, cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the governors and transferred to the labial elders and \"favorite heads\", who were subordinate to the Boyar Duma. According to reports from the field, Glinskaya had information that the governors were \"fierce, like lions.\" It was these actions of Glinskaya that largely prepared the reforms that her son, Ivan the Terrible, began to carry out.\n\nDuring the reign of Glinskaya, a monetary reform was carried out, which streamlined monetary circulation in Russia, new cities were built. Under Elena Vasilievna, a brick wall appeared in Moskovsky Posad (Kitay-Gorod).\n\nturned out to be successful and foreign policy held under the direction of Elena Glinskaya. In 1534 the Lithuanian king Sigismund began new war, but his attempt to seize Smolensk ended in failure. And as a result of the truce of 1536-1537, Chernigov and Starodub lands joined Moscow. Later, an agreement was concluded with Sweden on free trade and its neutrality.\n\nOnly five years of regency were allowed to Elena Glinskaya to carry out significant reforms. And if at the beginning of her reign she was met with caution by the people, then by the end of her reign, people doted on her soul.\n\nIn 1538, Elena died suddenly, leaving her young son Ivan alone with the boyars. There was a rumor that Shuisky had a hand in death. Examination of her remains confirms that poison (mercury) was the cause of death. But this fact is not recognized by historians as indisputable. Ivan IV, who accused the boyars of any sins, did not consider them responsible for the death of his mother.\n\nElena Vasilievna Glinskaya was buried in the Kremlin, in the Ascension Convent."
