        "text": "The Golden Ring is a ring of cities northeast of Moscow, the capital of Russia. They formerly comprised the region known as Zalesye.\n\nThese ancient towns, which also played a significant role in the formation of the Russian Orthodox Church, preserve the memory of the most important and significant events in Russian history. The towns have been called «open-air museums» and feature unique monuments of Russian architecture of the 12th–18th centuries, including kremlins, monasteries, cathedrals, and churches. These towns are among the most picturesque in Russia and prominently feature Russia’s onion domes.\n\nThere is no official list of which cities make up part of the Golden Ring with the exception of the eight principal cities of Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Ivanovo, Suzdal, Vladimir, Sergiev Posad, Pereslavl-Zalessky and Rostov Veliky. In addition to this other old cities in the Ivanovo, Vladimir and Yaroslavl regions also considered themselves as part of the ring, including Palekh, Plyos and Shuya (Ivanovo Region) Gorokhovets, Gus-Khrustalny, Murom, Yuriev-Polsky (Vladimir Region) and Rybinsk, Tutaev and Uglich (Yaroslavl Region).\n\nYou will ride BMW R1200 GS motorcycles during your route (motorcycle operation is possible only as part of the program with a guide).\n\nThe route is thought out in a way that you will have the opportunity to stop in historical places and take photos of picturesque nature.\n\nAll included. You will receive a motorcycle and health insurance. All museums tickets are included in the price.\n\nIt is possible to change the program if only it’s the group wish.\n\nThroughout the route you will be accompanied by a guide, guard and mechanic (we will replace motorcycle in case of serious damage).\n\nThe average length of the route is 900 km."
