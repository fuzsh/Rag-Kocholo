        "text": "JEFF DECKER has been active in the central Virginia music scene for over twenty years. As a member of the University of Virginia's performance faculty, he performs regularly with the Free Bridge Quintet (the faculty jazz ensemble) and the Charlottesville University Symphony Orchestra. He has extensive experience as a professional musician working for parties and receptions, performing for hundreds of such occasions over the last decade. THE JEFF DECKER BAND specializes in swing era dance music and jazz. Accordingly, the THE JEFF DECKER BAND is well equipped to perform specialty dance numbers, such as rumbas, bossa novas, sambas, fox trots, waltzes, etc. The attached song list provides just a sample of what THE JEFF DECKER BAND regularly performs. All the members of the group are experienced professional musicians with the ability to play hundreds of songs. Special songs, such as wedding first dances, can be performed if the music is provided beforehand, although most often the band is quite familiar with tunes that are requested. The demonstration audio provides a sample of the songs and styles that the band performs, ranging from medium tempo swing era fox trots to high energy sambas, as well as bossa novas, shuffles, up tempo jitterbug numbers, and romantic ballads. The Jeff Decker Band was voted as one of the Best Wedding Bands in Virginia by a 2010 survey of Knot.com brides and grooms."
