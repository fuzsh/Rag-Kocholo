He is one of only 15 coaches in NCAA history to lead 4+ schools to the NCAA Tournament and one of only 16 coaches to lead multiple schools to the NCAA Final Four.\n\nIn his career, he has been named a National Coach of the Year six times. Sampson has received seven conference Coach of the Year awards from four different leagues and guided every program he has led to multiple 20-win seasons during his stints.\n\nIn nine seasons at Houston, Sampson has led the Cougars to five consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances – including the 2021 NCAA Final Four – and six American Athletic Conference titles and stands as the only coach in school history to lead the Houston to eight straight 20-win seasons. He became the second-winningest coach in program history during the 2020-21 season and ranks as the school’s career leader with a .758 winning percentage.\n\nDuring his Oklahoma tenure, he guided the Sooners to 10 consecutive 20-win seasons, the 1999 Sweet 16, the 2002 Final Four and an Elite Eight appearance in 2003. From 1994 to 2006, he guided the Sooners to NCAA Tournament appearances in 11 of 12 years.\n\nIn the classroom, numerous student-athletes have received their bachelor’s degrees with one earning his master’s degree under Sampson’s leadership at Houston.\n\nIn the community, the Cougars have been active, passing out Thanksgiving lunches to Star of Hope Mission residents and leading a Texas Special Olympics event inside Hofheinz Pavilion and the Guy V. Lewis Development Facility during Sampson’s tenure.\n\nat HOUSTON\n\nUnder Sampson’s leadership in 2022-23, the Cougars continued to stand among the nation’s best. With 33 victories, Houston recorded its second straight 30-win season and the third under Sampson.\n\nThe Cougars ranked among the nation’s Top-Six leaders in both national polls for the entire season and spent eight weeks at No. 1 for the first time since 1984.\n\nHouston captured the American Athletic Conference regular-season title for the fourth time in a five-year stretch and swept the league’s postseason individual awards with Sampson being named The American Coach of the Year for the fourth time in a six-year stint.\n\nThe Cougars competed as the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1983 and advanced to the NCAA Sweet 16 or farther for the fourth straight season.\n\nFollowing the season, guard Marcus Sasser and forward Jarace Walker were taken in the First Round of the NBA Draft with Walker being selected with the No. 8 overall pick. He became the highest Cougar taken in the NBA Draft since 1984, and it marked the first time since 1984 that a pair of Cougars were chosen in the First Round.\n\nSampson led the Cougars throughout an unforgettable 2021-22 season, which featured numerous twists and turns.\n\nPicked to win the American Athletic Conference for the third straight season in the Coaches’ Preseason poll, Sampson and the team were dealt a pair of heavy blows with the losses of guards Marcus Sasser and Tramon Mark to season-ending injuries in late December 2021.\n\nDespite those losses, Sampson and the Cougars responded and overcame those challenges, posting a 32-6 overall record, sweeping the league’s regular-season and tournament championships and advancing to the NCAA Elite Eight.\n\nIt was only the fourth sweep of the conference championships in school history and the first since 1991-92.\n\nThe Cougars finished the season at No. 15 in the final Associated Press poll and at No. 7 in the Ferris Mowers Coaches’ poll.

It was only the second time in program history that Houston captured back-to-back league crowns and the first time since 1984.\n\nWith 23 victories, Sampson guided Houston to its fifth straight 20-win season, a first in program history. His Cougars also finished No. 22 in the final Associated Press poll and at No. 23 in the last USA TODAY Coaches’ poll, marking the third straight season Houston finished among the nation’s Top 25.\n\nThe Cougars were poised to earn their third straight NCAA Tournament appearance before the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic in March 2019 abruptly canceled collegiate athletics for the remainder of the season.\n\nIn 2018-19, Sampson led Houston to one of the greatest seasons in school history. He guided the Cougars to a 33-4 overall record with a 16-2 mark in American Athletic Conference play, the league’s regular-season title and a berth in the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 for the first time since 1984.\n\nWith Houston’s 69-58 win at SMU on Jan. 16, 2019, Sampson earned the 600th win of his career, becoming the 52nd coach in NCAA history (with 10+ years of Division I experience) to reach that milestone.\n\nHe also collected the 100th win of his Houston career against the Mustangs, setting a school record as the fastest coach to triple-digit victories with the Cougars (149).\n\nSampson’s Cougars rattled off a 33-game home winning streak, which was the nation’s longest mark before it was snapped it late February 2019, and was the fourth-longest home streak in school history.\n\nSampson was recognized as the American Athletic Conference Coach and the National Association of Basketball Coaches District 25 Coach of the Year for the second straight season and received the Clarence “Big House” Gaines National Coach of the Year Award from the National Sports Media Association.\n\nSampson guided the 2017-18 Cougars to one of the most successful seasons in decades. With a 27-8 overall record, the Cougars tied for the sixth-most wins in school single-season history and earned their first NCAA Tournament victory since 1984 when guard Rob Gray banked in a layup with 1.2 seconds remaining in a 67-65 win over rv/rv San Diego State in the First Round in Wichita, Kan.\n\nFor his and his team’s impressive efforts, Sampson was named the Coach of the Year by the American Athletic Conference and the NABC District 25.\n\nHe became the first coach in program history to lead the Cougars to 3+ 20-win seasons during his first four years at Houston.\n\nCompeting in Texas Southern’s H&PE Arena as the Fertitta Center underwent a $60-million renovation, Sampson led the Cougars to a perfect 15-0 home record in 2017-18, the ninth perfect home season in school history.\n\nHouston was one of only six teams to post a perfect home record in 2017-18.\n\nIn 2016-17, Sampson led the Cougars to 21 victories and a third-place finish in the American Athletic Conference. It was the second straight season in which the Cougars finished among the league’s top-three leaders.\n\nThe Cougars also advanced to the NIT for the second straight season, a first in program history since 2005 and 2006.\n\nHouston played in front of two home sellouts for the first time since 2007-08 as the Cougars closed out Hofheinz Pavilion to prepare for the Fertitta Center for the 2018-19 season.\n\nGuards Damyean Dotson and Rob Gray were named to the All-American Athletic Conference First Team, the first Cougar duo to earn All-Conference First-Team accolades in the same season since 1990. Gray also became the Cougars’ first conference scoring champion since Aubrey Coleman led Conference USA and the nation in 2009-10.\n\nThe Cougars enjoyed tremendous success under Sampson’s leadership during the 2015-16 season. Picked to finish seventh in the coaches’ preseason poll, the Cougars tied for third in the American Athletic Conference and played as the No. 2 seed at the American Championship.\n\nSampson led the Cougars to 22 wins for only the 15th time in program history with a win over No. 12 SMU inside Hofheinz Pavilion. After a tremendous regular season, the Cougars earned a bid to the NIT for the first time since 2006.\n\nExcitement about Sampson and his program continued to build throughout the season. In December, the Cougars knocked off LSU 105-98 in overtime in front of 7,918 fans inside Hofheinz Pavilion.\n\nIt was the largest home crowd to watch the Cougars play since 8,918 fans saw Houston fall to No. 1/1 Memphis on Jan. 30, 2008.\n\nForward Devonta Pollard was named to the All-American Athletic Conference Second Team, while Dotson earned Honorable Mention. Point guard Galen Robinson, Jr., was named to the league’s All-Rookie Team.\n\nDuring his first season at Houston in 2014-15, Sampson and his staff were forced to move quickly after joining the program in April. Despite the brief introduction, Sampson guided the Cougars to 13 wins, including a 70-68 victory against defending national champion UConn in Hofheinz Pavilion.\n\nAlthough the Cougars were forced to overcome injuries to multiple players at times, Houston finished the regular season as winners of its last three games and posted the American Athletic Conference Championships’ lone First-Round upset with a 66-60 win against Tulane.\n\nThe Cougars opened the season with wins in five of their first six games and claimed a dominating 82-69 win over Big 12 member Texas Tech during the final day of the Continental Tire Las Vegas Classic Championship Round.\n\nHis student-athletes also enjoyed success off the court.
