        "text": "The Rough Guide To John Coltrane\n\nColtrane created a wealth of landmark recordings that opened up new horizons for both listeners and jazz instrumentalists alike. Now on this carefully crafted Rough Guide, Coltrane's genius is illuminated like never before in top-of-the-range remastered audio quality.\n\nCompiled by jazz devotee Iain Murray, this thoughtfully put together album includes classics such as 'Blue Train' and 'Naima' nestling alongside other great Coltrane tunes such as 'Cousin Mary' and 'Spiral'.\n\nThe music chosen charts Coltrane's influences from his deep-set reverence for the bluesy end of jazz manifest in tracks including, 'The Sleeper' and 'Traneing In', to his connection with free-wheeling avant-garde styles on tracks such as, 'Giant Steps', to his fondness for softly melodic tunes such as 'Syeeda's Song Flute'.\n\nThe full length bonus album included with this Rough Guide is titled, Trane In Session and charts the inimitable saxophonist's recordings with his contemporaries of the day. Hear his legend alongside the stylings of jazz royalty including Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk. The track list features him in a variety of contexts including big band, small group and duo settings.\n\nJohn Coltrane's questing, uncompromising spirit was eventually vanquished when he died in 1967. Now, more than forty years since his passing, this Rough Guide celebrates his playing and composing which continues to resonate throughout contemporary music."
