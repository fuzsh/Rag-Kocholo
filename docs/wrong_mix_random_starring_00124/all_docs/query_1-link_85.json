        "text": "​At the current rate of time passage, factoring in the steady increase in speed once 40 is in the rear view, I expect the next 2 years will feel like a month when 70 arrives. It's simply impossible that only I have noticed this change in our personal space/time continuum. If the unthinkable happens and Tangerine Temper Tantrum, leader of the Self-Love Church of Stupid gets the keys to the kingdom a second time, it can’t get here fast enough. And we will only have ourselves to blame. I am finished with the rise above it playbook, it’s time for everyone to use our voice, just try to avoid using too many big words. The plan going forward around here is to just turn the music up and when I hear a lie, call it out… with a smile. Siriusly, and I don’t like using that word. This episode is designed to lower my blood pressure, and I believe it might do the same for you. New things from Strand of Oaks, Shelby Lynne, Mike Campbell & The Dirty Knobs, Lindsey Buckingham, Kristin Hersh, Little Feat, Mavis Staples, Dennis Schocket & Cliff Hillis and more. Thanks for all the support. Vote.\n\nlink hosted by hearthis.at\n\nlink hosted by mixcloud\n\nA Video Highlight Reel\n\nThe PLAYLIST is HERE\n\nFinally! Everything is restored and safe. Enough of the front end work is finished to a point that allows me to finish this overdue conclusion of FTB #250 and get it posted in May. Sparing you the technical nightmare, lets just say that 20 Terabytes of music files can be a bit unwieldy. I am going to continue to post shows to Mixcloud, if there’s any questions I can answer, reach out at my Yahoo address, which is very easy to find and I will get back. It’s always best to go to http://mikemarrone.com first, if there’s a show a link will always be found there before anywhere else. I would love to dump FB/Mega, as Social Media is becoming less interesting by the day. X is long gone. It's still the best way to get the word out. 34 Counts, all guilty. The next Mixtape is programming itself. New things on this episode include The Third Mind, Okkervil River, Fontaines D.C., June Moss, The Afghan Whigs, Bobby Rush, Aaron Lee Tasjan, Black Pumas, The Sticky Sweethearts and Neil Young & Crazy Horse. They are joined by a host of dignitaries, including Kristin Hersh, The Waterboys, Nirvana, Julian Coryell, Def Leppard, Prince, Julian Cope w/Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, Ben Folds, Translator, The Bad Plus, Peter Gabriel, Mick Hucknall, Allman Brothers Band, The Esquires, J. Geils Band, Herman Brood & His Wild Romance, Morphine, Jeff Buckley, The Beach Boys, Glen Campbell, O Positive and more.\n\nFundraiser ends on June 3rd... click for link\n\nLooking for The Playlist? click me.\n\n​Part 1 Saturday May 5, 2024\n\nJanuary 15, 2011 is just a few months beyond a dozen years ago and marked the first post ever in this so-called Blog. Looking back now it truly feels like a lifetime ago, and in many ways that is exactly what it is. At the time I was a decade into working at my dream job; programming, designing and presenting The Loft, the station I was hired to create for XM Satellite Radio in Washington, DC. The merger of XM and Sirius had already happened. While this web domain had already been personally acquired and was used for a range of things like “Segue Lessons,” it had become clear to me that although I loved my job, it would likely not be the one I remained at until Retirement or death, whichever came first.\n\nThere were not many of the original XM people left in what was our beautiful HQ at Eckington Pl. in DC. and now “The Fuckery” was fully underway. My mantra was to do my job, keep my head down and continue doing what I was born to do and still loved. I managed to do just that for a while, but by the time I turned 60 in 2016 they didn’t realize I was that old and completely removed the gloves. I felt like Casey Stengel in 1960 at the end of his Yankee career, vowing never to turn 60 again! By January 15, 2017 I had already given notice that the end of the year would be my final day. I was feeling terrible and no longer had the strength or resolve to continue to fight them off. I knew I was sick, but not how sick, and the lies and daily abuse had developed into an unnecessary hostile work environment. I gave them a full month notice, made what I felt was an upbeat announcement (https://www.mikemarrone.com/mikes-basement/archives/12-2017) and worked until 10 minutes to Midnight on New Year’s Eve, completing all of the programming for the next week, loading it, perfectly timed out, backed up and ready to go, making sure that Franny, Chris, Meg, David and Larry could take their Holiday breaks. I signed off the SXM server and 10 minutes later, exactly at Midnight my service was shut off by the powers that be. Haven’t even heard a minute of their service since.\n\nAnd then the shit really hit the fan!\n\nI don’t regret a single minute of those 17 years but this is what I want to do now. I hope you enjoy it and continue to offer your support and ears.\n\nPeace and Love or Peas and Loaf,\n\nMike Marrone\n\nAbsecon, NJ\n\nMay 4, 2024\n\nflac mp3\n\nIf you can help with a small donation, we could really use it. click here.\n\nAnd here's The Playlist click\n\nMIXCLOUD LINK\n\n​Hear This Link\n\n​It’s anyone’s guess at this point but if we are really at the Self-immolation stage in our society, especially regarding an individual so clearly on the brink of breakdown at the possibility of finally being held to account, perhaps it’s already over and we just don’t know it. I am completely flummoxed, more about who the object of adoration is more than anything else. All I can do is turn the music up and continue to hope for the best.\n\nEpisode #249 is jam packed with new music from Steve Conte, Andrew Bird Trio, Amy Winehouse, Nick Cave; Warren Ellis, Stanton Moore, Black Country Communion, Will Hoge, James Mastro, Alejandro Escovedo, The Pineapple Thief, Trifecta, Meshell Ndegeocello, Manic Street Preachers, José James, Melody Gardot, Nathaniel Rateliff, T Bone Burnett and The Black Keys. Along with contributions that run the gamut from Duke Ellington and John Coltrane to Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. We lit 80 candles for Dave Edmunds’ cake and offered a fond farewell to Brother Dickie Betts. Once I figure out how Robert E. Lee had an Irish accent, I let you know. Until then, stay safe, thanks for listening and turn the music up. Love to all.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST CAN BE FOUND BY CLICKING THIS\n\n​It is difficult enough as an aging Boomer to accept the inevitable deterioration of our personal skin suit, even with options and upgrades. I can attest that regardless the level of visible decay, the mainframe at the core of my personal CPU can’t compute that June will mark the 68th year since the initial install. I guess that’s a good thing, not that it matters but I do feel fortunate much more often than the inverse. Certainly not in financial terms but that was never a top priority, music was. Dignity, love, happiness and beauty have nothing to do with finance, Barrett Strong and John Lennon taught us that in grade school. The answer has always been music. Regardless the flavor. There are no wrong answers, as long as you can remain honest to yourself. There is no fake news contained in the science that listening to music is the only activity that involves all areas of your brain. Imagine that.\n\nTo paraphrase one of his best songs, Alejandro Escovedo towers above. For over four decades he has done the work, without shortcuts of any kind. I came aboard in the early 90’s, when knowing the backstory my first listen to “She Doesn’t Live here Anymore” completely laid me out. That feeling has never left me, but I can’t put into words anything close to a definition, while certain you know exactly what I’m referring to. Art is confirmed when the ability to inspire that emotion is achieved. Alejandro’s musicality, intellect, emotional depth, integrity, taste and a whole lot of soul never lets me down. Time and again his songs have torn out my heart with their honesty and brilliance, causing a slow exhale and “Thank you, Sir. May I have another?” escaping in a horse whisper.\n\nOther new arrivals include Gary Clark Jr. (with Stevie Wonder), Bartees Strange, Starsailor, T Bone Burnett, Lucius and Crowded House. We say goodbye to Brother Dege and keep wondering if Blitzen Trapper’s single “Cosmic Backseat Education” will break its spell over me, forcing me to play at least once, but usually 3 times a day, every day since March 3. Thanks as always for your ears and heart. Enjoy the show. dl\n\nPLAYLIST CAN BE YOURS BY CLICKING THIS."
