        "text": "Bill Bonifas aims to rock your socks off at the very last performance of this summer’s Jazz in the Park concert series. And he’s brought some of his friends to play with him.\n\nBonifas is a highly experienced guitarist who, according to East Town Association, has supported Grammy Award-Winner Douglas Spotted Eagle, Peter Buffett and the fusion band Random Walk. His work with Douglas Spotted Eagle had him traveling all around the world, from the Catalina JazzTrax Festival on Santa Catalina Island off the coast of Los Angeles, California to the Jazz Yatra Festival in Mumbai, India to the opening of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Bonifas’ work can also be heard in several different recordings, movie soundtracks and commercials.\n\nBonifas released his first album, the Bonifas Quartet, to rave reviews in 2002. He is currently working with producer Steve Rodby, 14-time Grammy- award-winning bassist, for his second album, HeartStrings.\n\nAccording to East Town Association, he has been described by New York Jazz critic (and former Milwaukeean) Bill Milkowski as having a voice that “resounds with a sense of warmth and assuredness” and that he was “a talent deserving wider recognition.”\n\nBonifas is the Executive Vice President of CBRE, a real estate services company. He also was former Chairman of the Board of the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music as well as the current Master of Ceremonies at Jazz in the Park. For his performance on Thursday, he’s bringing many different Milwaukee jazz legends into the mix.\n\n“This is a diverse group of jazz musicians. The night starts with the Bonifas Quintet which will be me on jazz guitar, Mark Davis [on] Piano, Dave Bayles on drums, Jamie Breiwick on trumpet and Jeff Hamann on bass. Then Jamie and friends will finish of the set adding Manty Ellis on guitar and Ada Kola on jazz vocals. Second set is me on jazz guitar, Mark Thierfelder on piano and trumpet, Greg Marcus on vibes and piano, Scott Napoli on drums and John Price on bass. Mark Davis and Jamie may join us to jam.\n\nThe last part of the second set – end of the night – will be the Bonifas Fusion band featuring me on electric guitar (rock type overdrive), Warren Wiegratz (from Streetlife) on sax, Eric Hervey on electric bass, Theo Merriweather on electric piano and Dave Bayles on drums. I emcee the night which I have done all year,” said Bonifas.\n\nYou can hear this compendium of Milwaukee Jazz tonight at 6 p.m. in Cathedral Square Park. Bonifas responded to our questions via email.\n\nHow did you get your start in music?\n\nStarted with rock then fusion now straight ahead jazz. I am first a writer and am working on recording with Mark Davis [on] piano, Jeff Hamann [on] bass and Dave Bayles [on] drums. This is a jazz oriented CD, HeartStrings, due out on Feb 14th 2016.\n\nHow did your band meet/start playing together?\n\nAll [have] been in the scene for many years.\n\nHow did you get involved in Jazz in the Park and what do you like about performing there?\n\nBeen there as artist with my own band, also with Random Walk (jazz fusion) and Douglas Spotted Eagle. I’m now on the board at East Town and emcee the concerts all year – I seem to play every two or three years.\n\nWho are your main musical influences?\n\nGuitarists Daryl Stuermer, Pat Metheny, John Scofield and Peter Bernstein. I consider Daryl and Peter good friends.\n\nHow would you describe your style of music?\n\nJazz – straight ahead\n\nHow do you try to connect to and work the audience?\n\nJust play our hearts out.\n\nWhich famous musicians do you most admire and why?\n\nSee guitarists above plus John Coltrane.\n\nHow would you describe the state of jazz today?\n\nJazz has become an elite music form – sad but true.\n\nHow do you balance your music with other obligations – mate, children, job?\n\nI have been playing for 50 years so that helps and I also use technology. For instance, Mark Davis texted me some ideas on a tune we recorded when Peter Bernstein was in town. Played for Peter – we made a few tweaks and essentially wrote the song on a Thursday – via texts – and recorded Saturday morning. I record at DV and Tanner Mongale.\n\nWhat is your musical background?\n\nGuitar. Started with [Jimi] Hendrix. I studied jazz with George Pritchett, went to the Conservatory (was former chairman of WCM), started Random Walk – produced by Daryl Stuermer for Milwaukee-based Narada, which became Peter Buffett’s backup band and then Spotted Eagle’s – toured with Spotted Eagle, Catalina Jazz Festival, two times at Jazz Festival in Mumbai, India – many others – on recordings with both plus film and commercial work.\n\nWhat do you love the most about performing live?\n\nChemistry\n\nWhere are your favorite places to perform?\n\nJazz in the Park is my favorite."
