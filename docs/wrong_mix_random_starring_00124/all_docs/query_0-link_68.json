        "text": "Note: for previous reviews of titles in this series, check the following pages:\n\nBBE J Jazz compilations:\n\nJ Jazz: Deep Modern Jazz from Japan 1969-1984 [Volume 1] (2018)\n\nJ Jazz: Deep Modern Jazz from Japan 1969-1983 Volume 2 (2019)\n\nBBE J Jazz Masterclass series:\n\nJ Jazz Masterclass vol. 1 (2018): Tohru Aizawa Quartet: Tachibana\n\nJ Jazz Masterclass vols. 2 & 3 (2018): Takeo Moriyama: East Plants / Koichi Matsukaze Trio + Toshiyuki Daitoku: Earth Mother\n\nEver since the release of the first J Jazz compilation in 2018, I have been tracking the BBE label’s archival releases of small-label Japanese jazz. My review of volume 2 of the main series of compilations was one of my last posts before the descent of the COVID-19 pandemic sent me fleeing from writing about jazz for a while. But since then, a third volume has appeared (review forthcoming), as have the individual reissues constituting the BBE “J Jazz Masterclass” series. Individual numbering of the latter titles ceased some time ago (I believe after volume 1, Tohru Aizawa’s Tachibana), but the series has been durable: after an understandably quiet 2020, it resumed early this year with two new discs, and the most recent entry, Kohsuke Mine’s excellent 1970 date First (see below), appeared just a few months ago. The albums featured in the series have been a mixed bag from the start, surprisingly uniform in sound and tone (one does tend to doubt how comprehensive a picture they paint of the diversity of Japanese jazz), but uneven in musical substance. Still, at their best they capture some truly intriguing inflections of jazz by players more than worthy of rediscovery in the west. I’m certainly glad that the series has delivered fascinating players like Mine and Koichi Matsukaze into my collection. And there’s a case to be made that, as of 2021, the series just keeps getting better.\n\nAlthough I last reviewed one of these individual titles almost 3 years ago (!), I have continued to collect them. Let’s get caught up together, shall we? I’ll present these capsule reviews in the order in which the discs were released, over roughly the last 2 years.\n\nMakoto Terashita Meets Harold Land: Topology (1984; reissued 2019)\n\nA late entry in the BBE J Jazz chronology, this one is set apart by a starring role for American West Coast tenor institution Land, then 55. Seemingly enthused by pianist Terashita’s softened Tyneresque postbop concepts, Land nonetheless sounds ragged on this session that basically fails to fulfill the promise of the marvelous opening “Dragon Dance.” Land’s own ballad “World Peace” is an uninspired Coltrane imitation, there are more rote Coltrane figures on “Takeuma,” and the saxophonist is simply absent on Terashita’s bossa, “Dear Friends.” It is disconcerting hearing Land stumble over his feet taking these giant steps. I have given this disc several tries but it always loses me over its 47 minutes, even though the East-meets-West melodic idiom of much of the music — which is much more strongly felt here than on other titles in the series — is so attractive in theory. Certainly the Japan-by-way-of-Brazil-by-way-of-LA fusions of “Dragon Dance” portend a more visionary work than what actually unfolds. In the end, the story of how the little-documented Terashita hooked up with the legendary Land is perhaps more interesting than the music they made together.\n\nMiyasaka +5: Animals Garden (1979; reissued 2019)\n\nThe first of several entries in this series with an “out of time” quality, this is an album of tempestuous and end-stage hard bop grounded fiercely by bandleader “Bear” Miyasaka’s truly thunderous drums. There’s no hint of fusion nor of the more peaceable formulations of the ECM world, though the pace is often stately, and little indication of the more avant vocabularies of its period either. Familiar voices from other titles in the series, including especially saxophonist Koichi Matsukaze, add searching solos to these four long but engrossing tracks, including a rousing “Pecker’s Blues” (!) and a particularly haunting, aptly-titled “Ballad for Mammoth.” The latter is a feature for trombonist Hiroshi Itaya, apparently based on “You Don’t Know What Love Is.” Itaya has some of the dry, acerbic quality of Grachan Moncur III. Matsukaze, here as elsewhere, makes a striking impression in a piercing modification of Eric Dolphy’s late idiom on alto, sounding a bit like the best kind of stomachache. The term “spiritual jazz” is embarrassingly overused, but if you’re lucky, this is the type of shaggy, uninhibited music you get. A worthy rediscovery, though neither completely without lulls nor as compulsively listenable as Matsukaze’s own disc in the series.\n\nSasaki Hideto – Sekine Toshiyuki Quartet + 1: Stop Over (1976; reissued 2020)\n\nAlong with the Terashita/Land title, this one is a good example of the J Jazz compilation series’ tendency to cut the heart out of the albums it excerpts. For the title piece here (like “Dragon Dance” on Topology), a gleaming Latin-tinged hard bop nugget that was a clear highlight of J Jazz vol. 2, quite mops the floor with everything else here. The hardest to love of the series (for me), this is most similar to inaugural entry Tachibana by the Tohru Aizawa Quintet, another young group of what might charitably be called semi-pros who would go on to record scantily if at all. Unusually for this series and for 1976, this group is a Blue Note-style quintet that plays exclusively in a circa-1962 style. Indeed, much of the material is borrowed from old Blue Notes of that era — not obvious ones, to be fair — and only the closing title track is new. There are two ballads, including Tadd Dameron’s “Soultrane” from his well-known 1956 session with Coltrane for Prestige, which boasts a particularly weak trumpet solo from Sasaki. Otherwise, the tempos are aggressive, the solos callow, and though it’s bracing in small doses, it doesn’t sustain interest over its whole running time, let alone over multiple plays. There is, however, some fine drumming, by the otherwise unrecorded Takashi Kurosaki.\n\nShintaro Quintet: Evolution (1984; reissued 2021)\n\nMore echoes of Blue Note: this one was even recorded in New York. Shintaro Nakamura leads the band from the bass chair and composed the tunes, but the real star is trumpeter Shunzo Ohno, who has a rich open tone reminiscent of Freddie Hubbard at his peak. Many will also hear Hubbard’s frequent partner Wayne Shorter in tenorist Bob Kenmotsu, making his recording debut. The impression quite dominates the music: the Quintet plays sleek hard bop, serious and unshowy, apparently untouched by fusion (though, like Hubbard, Ohno apparently specialized in it during the ‘70s). It’s very much in line with the bop revivalism of the time, which after all had started in Japan (with the rapturous reception of the Herbie Hancock-led VSOP groups) and had slowly made its way back to America. The opening piece, “Future on You,” with its abruptly shifting time signatures, is surprisingly similar to a 1980s Wynton Marsalis group — but the rest could be extracts from Hubbard or Lee Morgan albums of 20 years earlier, albeit extracts limited to just the minor waltzes. These are a recurring theme of this series, to be sure — “My Favorite Things” is always nearby — but this one takes it to its logical conclusion, every tune a waltz. The closing dedication, “A Blind Man,” is to Woody Shaw: a highlight of the very first volume of J Jazz back in 2018, it features the leader’s one and only bass solo of the session. Despite some slight rhythmic monotony by the end, this is the glossiest Masterclass title yet, and one of the best — as familiar and unfamiliar at once as an autumn day.\n\nKohsuke Mine: First (1970; reissued 2021)\n\nBy contrast to the other titles here, this one could hardly have been made at any time but in 1970, with its combination of double bass, Rhodes piano, and quartal changes. Chronology aside, it’s thoroughly excellent. Leader Mine plays his fragile, Jackie McLean-touched alto over the velvety bed of electric piano, played with unusual delicacy by Masabumi Kikuchi. Meanwhile, an expatriate American rhythm section — Larry Ridley on bass and Lenny McBrowne on drums — are treated like the honored guests they no doubt were, and Ridley in particular contributes some strikingly ruminative solos and walking lines. (The closing track is a wonderful feature for the under-recorded McBrowne.) Unusually free for a BBE rediscovery, First is still fairly approachable postbop stuff — but dynamic and full of incisive playing by all four members of the group. Ridley even contributes a finger-snapping minor blues to keep things swinging. Alongside Matsukaze’s (similar in some respects) Earth Mother, the aptly-named First is at the front of the pack in this series.\n\nConsumer note: for some reason this last title is scarcer and way more expensive than the others, even on CD (my copy cost $32). I hope this is just a COVID-related blip and doesn’t portend a permanent change for the series, which up to this point has been distinguished by excellent distribution and very reasonable prices.\n\nThirty years after the start of jazz’s digital renaissance, it seems that we have finally found our way back the 1970s. Here is a new collection of hitherto unreleased Coltrane, and instead of it being presented in the scholarly ways that have become customary during the CD era, we instead have the material compiled into a factitious new “album” clearly configured with vinyl presentation in mind. Those who spring for one of the “deluxe” packages (and it’s hard to imagine anyone with an interest in this music who wouldn’t) get an extra disc of takes from the session, likewise programmed to split down the middle, as an LP would and must. Except for the fact that the vinyl package is slightly more elaborate, the CD and LP versions are identical in design and content — another sign the LP came first.\n\nThe re-emergence of this music, perhaps the most significant discovery of unreleased Coltrane material in four decades, has been covered extensively in the press. The story begins with a lot of tape reels put up for auction in 2005 by Antonia Andrews, Coltrane’s stepdaughter by his first wife, Naima — also known as Juanita and, to John, “Nita.” Andrews, then known as Saeeda, was the dedicatee of Coltrane’s delightful tune “Syeeda’s Song Flute.”\n\nIn the ’60s, Coltrane was in the habit of asking his recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder for tapes of his sessions to review at home. (Because Van Gelder’s stereo recordings were always meant to be summed to mono, the tapes are in excellent fidelity.) These home listening sessions are presumably how Coltrane ended up deciding that the first take, not the second, of the 1965 big-band piece Ascension was his preferred version, or that he should go back and overdub some obbligatos on his March 1963 session with the singer Johnny Hartman. In both cases, Coltrane’s second-guessing necessitated a recall of already-released albums.\n\nThe Andrews tapes were from those home reels, and they included the only extant copies of studio sessions long since lost or destroyed by the corporate owners of Coltrane’s label. As such, they are of almost incalculable preciousness for jazz history, because they consist of otherwise unpreserved material by one of the most influential groups in the tradition — the “classic quartet” of Coltrane, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist James Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones — performing in the space in which their leader thought they were at their peak. Although Coltrane and Naima were either in the midst of a separation or were already separated when the sessions took place, he apparently was still in the habit of sharing the tapes with her, or perhaps just storing them at her home.\n\nWhy weren’t these recordings released during Coltrane’s lifetime? Well, Trane was big business. Like the labels he had previously been contracted to, Impulse! recorded him far more than they could possibly schedule for release. From the label’s perspective, Coltrane’s contracts had traced a trajectory from small independents (Prestige, Blue Note) through to a large independent (Atlantic), and finally to a major label, albeit a second-tier major label, ABC’s subsidiary Impulse!. The latter probably reasoned that Coltrane’s next stop was Columbia or Capitol, and wanted to have some material stashed away for when that happened. (It didn’t, of course. Coltrane died in 1967, without yet having fulfilled his final Impulse! re-signing.)\n\nColtrane obviously didn’t mind the arrangement, as the over-documentation was a way of keeping his group paid between gigs. And one way that the Impulse! contract was different from those Coltrane had signed earlier in his career was that he now had artist’s approval over the track selection and packaging of his albums. Although Coltrane was used to the familiar jazz-business hustle of the album produced in a single session, he seemed to prefer cobbling albums together from pieces of different sessions (1962’s Coltrane and Ballads, 1963’s Impressions, 1964’s Crescent), or at least cutting a dry run first (1964’s A Love Supreme, 1965’s Meditations). It is impossible to say whether Coltrane would have revisited these performances had he lived, or whether he really felt that only the soprano performance “Vilia” was worthwhile. Coltrane sometimes doubted the merits of even his greatest work, consigning astonishing pieces like “Song of the Underground Railroad,” “Dear Lord,” and the entire Sun Ship and Interstellar Space sessions to the outtake bin.\n\nBack to 2005. Naima’s tapes were claimed by Universal before they could be auctioned off. Their contents have been slow to trickle out. The Coltrane home archives have so far produced a couple of releases, 2005’s One Down, One Up and 2014’s Offering, but those appear to have come from the home Coltrane shared with his second wife, Alice (a significant figure for jazz in her own right), and their three sons. A recent deluxe edition of A Love Supreme hinted at the promise of Naima’s tape stash, but this is the first time in a very long time that new stuff has emerged that might actually require some adjustments to the historical record.\n\nSo. I’ve written about this period in Coltrane’s career before, subjecting it to almost obsessive scrutiny. I’ve called it a period of uncertainty for Coltrane, of profound self-doubt — notwithstanding that it was also the period that produced my favorite album by anyone, ever, and probably also my favorite song too. The surviving live recordings always complicated my thesis. But the session preserved here, recorded the day before the one with Hartman, puts another crack in it. Now, Coltrane was never an artist who radiated serene self-assurance the way Cannonball Adderley, Zoot Sims, his old employer Johnny Hodges, or even his own bandmates Tyner and Jones, could. The rewards of his art are of a different kind. But this session shows an artist and a group confidently at work, in full command of what they are trying to accomplish, entirely comfortable with trying on the subtle differences of shading that characterize the studio process. (A word for Garrison — always credited as “Jimmy” but always called “James” on the session tapes — arguably the most underrated musician in the history of jazz, whose variations are crucial to differences in the arrangements.)\n\nThe unusually large ratio of soprano to tenor on this record helps pinpoint the session to 1963, just before the classic — and even more soprano-heavy — Live at Birdland. In 1963 Coltrane was still trying to decide whether he was going to concentrate on the tenor — the instrument that had first brought him to notice — or the soprano, the instrument that had brought him his greatest commercial success. The only track from this session that has been heard before, the aforementioned “Vilia” (i.e. “Delia” from The Merry Widow), is attempted first on tenor, but the clearly superior take is the one on soprano, selected for release in 1965 and collected here on disc 2.\n\nThe soprano version is sweet, joyous, and blisteringly confident. The tenor version is undistinguished by comparison. Its presence on the “album” disc is inexplicable, unless there was a directive to make everything on that disc previously unreleased. But it is, nonetheless, interesting to hear Coltrane navigating the changes using similar strategies to those he brought out at around the same time on “Bye Bye Blackbird” and “Dear Old Stockholm,” two standbys from his Miles Davis period with similar chords.\n\nStrictly speaking, there will be few surprises here for the already initiated. The mixture of long blues and vamp-based modal pieces with subtly experimental treatments of popular ballads (like Nat King Cole’s “Nature Boy”) clearly situates the recordings here in the main stream of Coltrane’s work during the 1960-’64 period. (The idiom was even briefly revisited in 1965 for The John Coltrane Quartet Plays, after Trane had largely moved on to other horizons.) Although there are several “new” compositions, all but two are unassuming blues riffs. “Slow Blues” (not to be confused with the 1957 “Trane’s Slo Blues“) has a similar bugle-like theme to a vault discovery from 20 years ago, 1965’s “The Last Blues.”\n\nOf the two other tunes, one, “One Up, One Down” (not to be confused with 1965’s “One Down, One Up”!) is already familiar from a live bootleg, and has been revived memorably by Dave Liebman on his 1992 big-band project Joy: The Music of John Coltrane, which, regrettably, is not on YouTube. The other tune, an untitled piece, is, as Lewis Porter — arguably the world’s foremost Coltrane authority — has proposed, probably not a Coltrane composition at all; my guess is it’s by Coltrane’s friend, the ill-starred trumpeter Cal Massey, based both on historical circumstances and the haunting composition’s similarity to other Massey compositions of the period, with its shifting Latin rhythms and keening soprano melody. An alternate take on the second disc features a striking harmonization of the theme by Tyner.\n\nAnyone following the trajectory of Coltrane’s career up to this point will also not be surprised to find multiple takes of “Impressions.” The simple tune — a spatchcocking of the chords from Miles’s “So What,” a theme from the now-forgotten pop-classical composer Morton Gould, and perhaps a snatch of Debussy by way of the old tune “The Lamp Is Low” — bothered Coltrane for years. He tried it more times in the studio than any other composition, and in the end elected to release none of these performances. The versions here are not likely to replace the authorized 1961 Village Vanguard take as definitive — nor do they compete with the 1963 Newport Festival performance for range of expression and continuity. But they are an impressive compression of the impact of those performances, and are much more powerful than the 1962 takes released a decade and a half ago on the two-CD “Deluxe Edition” of the Coltrane album. It is also strange and exhilarating to hear the tune played entirely without piano.\n\nSo where do these recordings fit in the canon? They’re clearly not in the top echelon of posthumous Coltrane, with the monumental Sun Ship, Om, Transition (all 1965), Interstellar Space (1967), and the 1966 Japan recordings. They are, in other words, not really “a new room in the great pyramid,” as Sonny Rollins calls them in the liner notes. But they are also not deficient in any really meaningful way. Coltrane operated at such a plateau of excellence in his maturity that even documents like this one — or Living Space (1965), or Stellar Regions (1967), or the 1963 and 1965 sessions with Roy Haynes collected on Dear Old Stockholm — where he is clearly feeling his way to some more dramatic revelation that’s just around the corner, are satisfying in themselves.\n\nSo Both Directions at Once may be a fake album, but it happily rubs shoulders with other such concoctions as Coltrane Plays the Blues, Coltrane’s Sound, Lush Life, and live exhumations like the contemporaneous Afro Blue Impressions (1963), all of which have come to be regarded as classics. You may find yourself cherishing this one as much as you do those — maybe more. Marketing aside, that’s what it’s all about.\n\nOne of the touching things for me about postwar Japanese culture is the reverence it accords the American things that don’t always receive that respect at home. It seems clear that the Japanese will be playing baseball and jazz records long after anyone else is. The enthusiasm of the Japanese jazz community has saved quite a number of deserving American musicians from total obscurity: Grant Green, Sonny Clark, and Jutta Hipp are just a few of my favorites (and Jutta, unique among them, actually lived to reap some belated Big In Japan rewards) — but there’s also, more famously, Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, and Tina Brooks, among many others. And now, as the CD era whimpers to a close, more and more significant American catalogue jazz titles beyond the Miles/Blue Note basics are available on disc (or at all) only as costly Japanese imports. It is remarkable to think that albums that were big sellers and major influences at home, such as Michael Brecker’s self-titled 1987 debut on Impulse!, are now much harder to hear (even on streaming services) than old Blue Notes that, in their day, sold scarcely a few hundred copies. Perhaps that’s as it should be. But, of course, in Japan you can also buy perpetually new editions of those old Blue Notes too. Jazz connoisseurship in Japan is a completist’s field.\n\n(Above: American jazz, Japanese obis. In the exotic SHM-CD disc format, which stands for their Supremely Hilariously Minimal sales potential.)\n\nBut what of jazz made in Japan, for the Japanese audience?\n\nJapan has produced its share of mainstream jazz artists of international stature in Toshiko Akiyoshi and Sadao Watanabe, to name a couple, but this new collection on the BBE label honors the Japanese jazz community more intimately than a catalogue of its greatest successes would. That is to say, it takes a crate-digger’s approach.\n\nFor a few reasons, this is a timely release. The title is a slight misnomer: there is nothing from the ’60s, and only a couple of tracks from the ’80s. Indeed, for the most part the focus falls quite narrowly on the ’73-’79 period, a fraught one for the jazz industry in America as it tried to navigate the Coltrane legacy, the attraction to commercial R&B, and the formalist retreat to a consolidation of earlier styles. The conflict was to set up jazz’s last surge of popular awareness in the 1980s, as well as some of the anxieties (if they are anxieties) that afflict the business today. It would seem many of the same dilemmas were being raked over in Japan at the same time. Now that enough years have intervened, the predominant jazz styles of the era — once regarded as symptoms of a crisis of direction in the music — are suddenly in vogue again. (Hey guys, dig Joe Henderson — he’s the original Solange of the tenor saxophone!)\n\nIt is curious that you can play these 40-year-old artifacts from Japan alongside those from the contemporary London scene on We Out Here in 2018 and hear so many echoes. There are the same tinkling Rhodes pianos, the same emphasis on rhythm and groove — though here, the groove is usually Elvin Jones’s rather than Jack DeJohnette’s. And there is the same rather utilitarian deployment of horns, except for a few savored Coltrane licks and a very impressive Woody Shaw imitation (albeit sometimes off-mic) on the Shintaro Quintet’s tribute track “A Blind Man.” And while a few themes do have a vaguely Asian quality owing to their pentatonic tonality, so do the McCoy Tyner and V.S.O.P. albums (several of them recorded in Japan!) that they correspond to.\n\nCertain names, such as tenorist Takao Uematsu, recur in the credits — Uematsu even plays the same theme and the same Coltrane licks on two separate tracks, recorded six years apart. But none are likely to be familiar to anyone outside of Japan, save “J Jazz” aficionados. Similarly, I suspect none of these tracks has been available digitally before, though the sound is pretty crisp and suggests a return to the original session tapes rather than simply to the LPs that once came out on small-to-tiny Japanese imprints such as WhyNot, Johnny’s Disk, and ALM.\n\nA survey of a scene as vibrant as this one, chosen and annotated with care as this disc is, should by rights be a world-beating classic. To my ears, though, J Jazz isn’t quite that. (Jaded listeners might be moved to question the title’s characterization of this music as “deep.”) But it is something, and an important thing at that. It’s a richly enjoyable “Great Day in Tokyo” portrait of an important outpost of jazz too long neglected in the West. And it’s a precious image of a time in jazz’s history that I miss — the last time when players were expected to learn the lore on the job, rather than from a harmony textbook in a university dorm.\n\nIn collecting some thoughts about jazz in Japan for a future post, I got to thinking about other outposts of jazz during its most restless period that have only recently become accessible to outsiders.\n\nUntil just a couple of years ago, Carsten Meinert seems to have been known outside his native Denmark only for a type of saxophone neck strap that bears his name. I gather it’s a leather strap with a soft brass clasp, easy on the neck and easy on the horn — earthy and elegant, an unassuming if enduring legacy.\n\nSo it is with Carsten Meinert the musician. Mainly a tenorist, he jobbed around Europe during the ’60s, gaining some notice and leading his own groups. In the ’70s he played with a couple of Danish acts chiefly notable for terrible cover art, such as Skunk Funk. I have no idea whether they had much success. Afterwards I think he drifted into education, working out of the Royal Danish Academy of Music, though at 73 he is no longer listed among their staff.\n\nBetween his emergence on the scene in the mid-’60s and his later career, Meinert recorded — and self-released, on his own M.S. and Spectator imprints — two albums. The second, CM Musictrain from 1970, still languishes in obscurity, and I’d like to hear it someday. The other, 1968’s To You, is another story.\n\nWith its charmingly naive cover art, variously hand-colored on certain copies by a friend of Meinert’s, and a sweet photo (seemingly taken in a university quadrangle) of a 23-year-old Meinert and the young lady I’d like to think he is still married to, To You received an initial pressing of 500 copies that expanded to perhaps a thousand on a subsequent reissue.\n\nOver the decades, a cult grew around the record, owing partly to its sheer rarity and partly to a reputation among the few who heard it as Denmark’s answer to the post-Coltrane “spiritual jazz” typical of artists on the Impulse! label in the late ’60s and early ’70s. The Coltrane lineage is certainly obvious from the group’s material. The album begins with a storming version of “Naima,” and progresses through “One for Alice” (Coltrane, presumably) and an adaptation of “Spiritual” (“Blues to Someone”); the group also worked on Trane’s “The Promise” during this period, and originals such as “This Time” that are reminiscent of any number of Coltrane compositions. In what might have been an expression of national pride, Meinert and his countrymen also whipped up a version of Denmark’s 1963 Eurovision Song Contest winner, the waltzing “Dansevise,” in an arrangement unmistakably reminiscent of Coltrane’s take on “My Favorite Things.”\n\nSo, to some extent, the project is an early example of a Coltrane tribute; though Archie Shepp’s Four for Trane and (in a more limited way) Elvin Jones’s fine Dear John C. with Charlie Mariano had already seen release in America, To You must have been one of the first posthumous ones. Many, many more would follow, and (as I’ve noted here before), the subgenre gradually acquired its own ceremonial conventions, some of which are present even at this early date.\n\nStill, the first encounter with Meinert and his “Kvartet” is bracing. For one thing, Meinert’s tenor sound — immediately displayed on “Naima” — is nothing like Coltrane’s. Though he borrows Coltrane’s dramatic approach to harmonics, and composes some rubato ballads with folky themes reminiscent of the later Trane, his playing seldom displays the searching vulnerability that I associate with the Coltrane sound. In what I think is a reflection of an older tenor tradition that had a longer tail in Europe than at home, Meinert flaunts a huge tone and massive vibrato perhaps pieced together from components of Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, Lockjaw Davis, Dexter Gordon, and Don Byas. In the process, though, Meinert’s tone ends up lining up nicely with the woolly-mammoth sound of contemporary post-Coltrane standard-bearers such as Pharoah Sanders and Archie Shepp. But still, Carsten was clearly no copyist. His sound is genuinely hard to place. My reconstruction above is speculative and unsatisfactory. His sound is, in other words, and as far as I can tell, original.\n\nThe young group, with pianist Ole Matthiessen working in an adaptation of McCoy Tyner’s idiom and drummer Ole Streenberg clearly trying to outdo his hero Elvin, may have had some limitations as improvisers, since solos are kept brief and only “Naima” and “Dansesvise” are allowed to crack the 4 1/2 minute barrier. But the result of this limitation (if it was one) is a refreshing emphasis on a collective sound that is atypical for jazz records of the era. The Kvartet doesn’t, for the most part, run chords. But they commit themselves to the elaboration of a group sound that had as its foundation the Coltrane quartet, of course, but which is distinguished by Meinert’s rich sound, the occasional pop gesture (such as the title track), and the sheer shattering physical force of Streenberg’s rhythms and accents. All of these elements converge on “Dansevise,” and the effect is ecstatic.\n\nOne might say they play a version of jazz made entirely of climaxes. It’s not really “free jazz,” and it’s not really bop or hard bop, and it’s certainly not soul-jazz or cool jazz or pop-jazz, but — like the hit Impulse discs of the period, such as Pharoah’s Karma — it’s in a sweet spot where those elements can interact joyfully and generously.\n\nStill, hardly anyone outside of the most monastic parts of the jazz record-collecting community would have any idea of the pleasures of this music if not for the efforts of Andreas Vingaard, a Dane based in New York who founded Frederiksberg Records partly in a quest to get Meinert’s work suitably and respectfully reissued. The resultant labor of love, released in 2015, had spotty distribution and I had to send away to Dusty Groove in Chicago to get the CD — that’s my copy above, at the time of the photo still sealed, complete with price tag.\n\nIt is indeed a beautiful reissue, with four interesting bonus tracks (including Meinert’s version of “The Promise” and a live take of “Dansevise”) and many attractive photos of Meinert at work in the ’60s, including at a session (still unreleased) with Coltrane’s rhythm section, Elvin Jones and Jimmy Garrison. There are also liner notes that tell the story of Meinert, and Danish jazz by extension, during the period with enthusiasm and compassion. The only thing that’s missing is the recording dates and personnel for the bonus tracks! (Apparently some of them feature Bjarne Rostvold, a major Danish jazz drummer, rather than Streenberg. This information comes from Andreas himself.)\n\nIn the couple of emails we exchanged in late 2016, Andreas admitted to me that the CD business wasn’t as brisk as he had hoped it would be when he started Frederiksberg in 2013, and that for business reasons he would be focusing on LPs and (more recently) downloads as a business strategy. There are ironies in this strategy that are characteristic of the music business today, but I won’t unpack them. I’ll simply reflect that it’s a pity people like Andreas can’t make money selling CDs, because this last-gasp-of-the-CD-era project is exemplary of the joys of the format.\n\nI’m grateful to Andreas Vingaard, anyway, for bringing this music to my attention. It’s one of my favorite music discoveries of the last several years, the rare case where record-collector hyperbole about the greatness of an obscure album turns out not to be hyperbole at all. Although far removed from the urgency of the post-Coltrane school’s Civil Rights-era social and racial context (notwithstanding Matthiessen’s gentle tribute to MLK), in purely musical terms it really is as great as the best of Shepp, Sanders, and Alice. I can’t recommend the Carsten Meinert Kvartet highly enough to those as addicted to this sound as me. Put it on and dream along.\n\n(In the meantime, this long, charming retrospective interview with Meinert is also worth hearing at least once.)\n\n(There is also this fascinating remix project by Danish DJ Lord Akton, which apparently pulled Meinert out of retirement to contribute some new soprano lines. It’s a testament to the reverence this record has long received at home. I haven’t heard it yet, but I look forward to doing so.)"
