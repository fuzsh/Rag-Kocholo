        "text": "JOHN COLTRANE\n\nOFFICIAL SITE\n\nOFFICIAL STORE\n\nJohn William Coltrane (September 23, 1926 – July 17, 1967) was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. He remains one of the most influential saxophonists in music history.\n\nHis compositions and recordings are now permanent parts of the canon of great American music, recognized by the Library of Congress, with many inducted into The Grammy Hall of Fame; all are now required study for young musicians hoping to unlock the secrets of the jazz tradition. In today’s mainstream media, Coltrane and his seminal 1944 LP A Love Supreme are often name-checked on television shows and referenced in major Hollywood films like Malcolm X, Mo Better Blues, Jerry McGuire, Mr. Holland’s Opus, and many others. There’s even a street named in his honor at Universal Studios Hollywood, close to the Universal Music archives where many of his original reel-to-reel masters are shelved. Posthumous honors persisted in 1995, the United States Postal Service placed Coltrane on a commemorative postage stamp. In 1997, he was bestowed the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2001, the National Endowment for the Arts chose My Favorite Things for its list of 360 Songs of The Century. In 2007, Coltrane was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, as a Special Citation for a lifetime of innovative and influential work."
