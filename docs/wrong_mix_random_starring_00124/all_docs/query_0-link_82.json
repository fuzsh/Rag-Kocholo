        "text": "Bambi\n\nWhen Mike decides it's time to visit the launderette, one of Vyvyan's socks escapes and the machine revolts against their stinking bundle of washing. Neil suddenly remembers they are due to appear on University Challenge. Vyvyan loses his head during the train journey, and it looks like Scumbag will lose to Footlights College, Oxbridge, when a giant eclair stops play.\n\nOil\n\nThe Young Ones move into their new house. As they are allocating bedrooms, Vyvyan locates oil in the basement and instantly forms a coalition with Mike to take command of the house (and oil). Mike discovers Buddy Holly in his new room.\n\nTime\n\nRik wakes up in bed next to a beautiful girl, but his boast of his sexual conquest is quickly dispelled by Helen herself. While Rik and Vyvyan rampage round the house, the radio announces Helen is an escaped murderess, so she tries to kill them all. The house passes through a time warp and the Young Ones are suddenly in the Middle Ages."
