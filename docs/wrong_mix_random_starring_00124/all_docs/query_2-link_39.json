        "text": "Who was John Coltrane?\n\nMerely mention the name John Coltrane and you're likely to evoke a deeply otional, often spiritual response from even the most casual jazz fan. Born September 23, 1926 in Hamlet, North Carolina, John Coltrane was always surrounded by music. His father played several instruments sparking Coltrane's study of E-flat horn and clarinet. While in high school, Coltrane's musical influences shifted to the likes of Lester Young and Johnny Hodges prompting him to switch to alto saxophone. He continued his musical training in Philadelphia at Granoff Studios and the Ornstein School of Music. He was called to military service during WWII, where he performed in the U.S. Navy Band in Hawaii. After the war, Coltrane began playing tenor saxophone with the Eddie \"CleanHead\" Vinson Band, and was later quoted as saying, \"A wider area of listening opened up for me. There were many things that people like Hawk, and Ben and Tab Smith were doing in the 40's that I didn't understand, but that I felt otionally.\" Prior to joining the Dizzy Gillespie band, Coltrane performed with Jimmy Heath where his passion for experimentation began to take shape. However, it was his work with the Miles Davis Quintet in 1958 that would lead to his own musical evolution. \" Miles music gave me plenty of freedom,\" he once said. During thatemperiod, he became known for using the three-on-one chord approach, and what has been called the sheets of sound,' a method of playing multiple notes at one time. By 1960 Coltrane had formed his own quartet which included pianist McCoy Tyner, drummer Elvin Jones, and bassist Jimmy Garrison. Eventually adding players like Eric Dolphy, and Pharoah Sanders. The John Coltrane Quartet created some of the most innovative and expressive music in Jazz history including the hit albums: \"My Favorite Things,\" \"Africa Brass,\" \" Impressions,\" \" Giant Steps,\" and his monumental work \"A Love supreme\" which attests to the power, glory, love, and greatness of God. Coltrane felt we must all make a conscious effort to effect positive change in the world, and that his music was an instrument to create positive thought patterns in the minds of people. In 1967, liver disease took Coltrane's life leaving many to wonder what might have been. Yet decades after his departure his music can be heard in motion pictures, on television and radio.
