        "text": "I could feel the goosebumps rising from the second I stepped through the aging iron gates of Preservation Hall, a decrepit-looking building in the heart of the French Quarter in New Orleans.\n\nI ducked my head to step through the worn wooden door leading into the tiny music hall and as I raised my eyes to take in the scene laid out before me, the impact of the cultural significance I was about to experience almost took my breath away.\n\nInside Preservation Hall New Orleans\n\nSultry jazz music played from overhead speakers as I took in the worn wooden floors and the vintage paintings and photographs of jazz greats from the last 60 years that lined the walls. Two sets of long benches took up the centre of the hall, with several more lining the walls, leaving just enough space at the back for standing room. I was surprised by how intimate the room was.\n\nHow long is a show at Preservation Hall?\n\nThere are three-to-five shows a night, depending on the day. Each set is 45 minutes.\n\nMy friend and I had the great pleasure of sitting in two of the three velvet-lined, antique theatre seats placed just inches from the side of the stage — so close to the drummer I could have reached out and touched him.\n\nWe pride ourselves in writing informative articles with interesting facts.

An evolving mix of younger and older musicians, the band has been carrying the torch of New Orleans music for more than 50 years.\n\nTraditional New Orleans Jazz\n\nAs the band started, the crowd initially sat in silence as, like us, we were all pretty awestruck by the living history unfolding before us. The band then launched into a swinging set of music celebrating the city’s Afro-Cuban roots, the Afrobeats of Fela Kuti, the Fire Music of Pharoah Sanders and John Coltrane, musical legends including Stevie Wonder and Elvis Costello, and modern performers such as Arcade Fire and the Black Keys. You can stream their music here.\n\nSo, it wasn’t long before the crowd has singing along, clapping their hands and stomping their feet. I would have liked to join in, but was too afraid of knocking the drum kit over.\n\nAfter the show, the band stayed around to meet with fans and sign autographs. And, they were super friendly and really looked like they were enjoying themselves, unlike other meet-and-greet events I’ve attended. As we streamed back out of those iron gates, the line up out the door to get into the next show snaked down the block, testament to the hall’s popularity.\n\nTips to plan a visit to Preservation Hall New Orleans\n\nSince this is part of a first-timers guide to the music scene in New Orleans, here are a few more “know before you go,” tips to help you plan.\n\nMake a reservation: Preservation Hall is famous world-wide and no trip to New Orleans would be complete without checking out a show\n\nPlease arrive at least 20 minutes prior to your scheduled performance\n\nEach set is 45 minutes\n\nThere is no alcohol sold at the show\n\nPreservation Hall is all ages, so children are welcome\n\nThere are no public washrooms\n\nYou cannot stay for a second show\n\nBe sure to read our review of Virgin Hotels New Orleans.
