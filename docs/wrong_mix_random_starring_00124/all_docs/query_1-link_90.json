        "text": "Arranged by Jacob Garchik (b. 1976)\n\nJlin, one of the most prominent electronic producers of the current generation, first appeared on Planet Mu’s second Bangs & Works compilation, which had a huge impact on electronic/club music. Though she is known for bringing footwork to a wider audience, Jlin doesn’t consider herself a footwork artist. Hailing from Gary, Indiana, a place close yet distant enough from Chicago to allow her to develop a different perspective on the genre, she has morphed its sounds into something entirely new. Released in 2015, her debut album Dark Energy's innovative sound propelled it to the top of many of the year’s Best Of lists. Jlin’s sophomore album Black Origami was recently released to even greater critical acclaim and attention. In 2017, Jlin also composed the music for a major new dance work by Wayne McGregor, one of the UK’s best known choreographers.\n\nAbout Little Black Book, Jlin writes:\n\n“I chose the name Little Black Book because there is a black notebook that I own that I literally write down every creative idea I have in it. It is my book of absolute freedom. The book is very special to me, as it was given to me on my twenty-first birthday by my eldest cousin. When Kronos approached me about doing this project I was quite ecstatic, and immediately knew I wanted to take this on from a perspective of absolute freedom of sound. I didn't care how crazy it sounded, I just wanted the instruments and choice of instruments to be free. Freedom was my goal no matter how left-field or unconventional. I love that Kronos decided to play this track as they deemed fit versus trying to follow what I did.”\n\nAleksandra Vrebalov, a native of the former Yugoslavia, left Serbia in 1995 and now lives in New York City. She has written more than 80 works, ranging from concert music, to opera and modern dance, to music for film. Her works have been commissioned and/or performed by the Kronos Quartet, Serbian National Theater, Carnegie Hall, Moravian Philharmonic, Belgrade Philharmonic and Providence Festival Ballet. Vrebalov is a fellow of MacDowell Colony, Rockefeller Bellagio Center, New York’s New Dramatists, American Opera Projects, Other Minds Festival, and Tanglewood. Her awards include The Harvard Fromm Commission, The American Academy of Arts and Letters Charles Ives Fellowship, Barlow Endowment Commission, MAP Fund, Vienna Modern Masters, Meet the Composer, and Douglas Moore Fellowship. Her works have been recorded for Nonesuch, Cantaloupe, Innova, Centaur Records, Vienna Modern Masters and Ikarus Films.\n\nVrebalov’s collaborative work with director Bill Morrison, Beyond Zero (1914–1918), was commissioned and premiered by Kronos at U.C. Berkeley’s Cal Performances in April 2014 and had its European premiere at the Edinburgh International Festival that summer. Her string quartet …hold me, neighbor, in this storm… was written for and recorded by Kronos for the album Floodplain. Her string quartet Pannonia Boundless, also for Kronos, was published by Boosey & Hawkes as part of the Kronos Collection, and recorded for the album Kronos Caravan. In 2018, Vrebalov wrote Missa Supratext for Kronos and SF Girls Chorus.\n\nVrebalov’s cross-disciplinary interests led to participation at residencies and fellowships that include the MacDowell Colony, Djerassi, The Hermitage, New York’s New Dramatists, Rockefeller Bellagio Center, American Opera Projects, Other Minds Festival, and Tanglewood. Between 2007 and 2011, Vrebalov created and led Summer in Sombor (Serbia), a weeklong composition workshop with the South Oxford Six composers’ collective that she co-founded in 2002 in NYC. The workshop facilitated the creation of over fifty new works by young composers from Europe and the USA. Most recently, Vrebalov joined Muzikhane (House of Music) founded by composer Sahba Aminikia in Mardin and Nusaybin, towns on Turkish/Syrian border, and made music with young refugees from Syria and Iraq.\n\nAs a Serbian expat Vrebalov is the recipient of the Golden Emblem from the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for lifelong dedication and contribution to her native country’s culture.\n\nAbout My Desert, My Rose, Vrebalov writes:\n\n“My Desert, My Rose consists of a series of patterns open in length, meter, tempo, and dynamics, different for each performer. The unfolding of the piece is almost entirely left to each performer’s sensibility and responsiveness to the parts of other members of the group. Instinct and precision are each equally important in the performance of the piece. The patterns are (notated as) suggested rather than fixed musical lines, so the flow and the length of the piece are unique to each performance. The lines merge and align to separate and then meet again, each time in a more concrete and tighter way. The piece ends in a metric unison, like a seemingly coincidental meeting of the lines predestined to reunite. It is like a journey of four characters that start in distinctly different places, who, after long searching and occasional, brief meeting points, end up in the same space, time, language.\n\n“The writing of this piece, in a form as open and as tightly coordinated at the same time, was possible thanks to 20 years of exposure to rehearsal and performance habits of the Kronos Quartet, a group for which I have written 13 out of 14 of my pieces involving string quartet.”\n\nArranged by Jacob Garchik (b. 1976)\n\nWhen Mahalia Jackson first recorded “God Shall Wipe All Tears Away” in 1937, she was relatively unknown, an aspiring artist who had migrated ten years earlier to Chicago from her New Orleans birthplace. The song—based on Revelation 21:4 in the King James Bible: “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away”—was composed in 1935 by New Orleans native Antonio Haskell. The 25-year-old Jackson recorded her seminal version for the Decca Coral label on May 21, 1937, along with “God’s Gonna Separate the Wheat from the Tares,” “My Lord,” and “Keep Me Everyday.” The session was a commercial failure.\n\nBut seven decades later, well after Jackson became internationally renowned as the Queen of Gospel, and “God Shall Wipe All Tears Away” was ensconced as a gospel masterwork (recorded by Dorothy Love Coates & the Gospel Harmonettes, the Pilgrim Travelers, and many others), Jackson’s performance caught the attention of Kronos Quartet founder and artistic director David Harrington. “The song was on the first CD of a French box set of the complete recordings of Mahalia Jackson,” Harrington recalls, “and it totally jumped out at me—the tempo, the sound of the organ, the emotion in her voice—it was all astounding. I just loved this song.”\n\nJacob Garchik initially arranged “God Shall Wipe All Tears Away” for the quartet’s collaborations with the Malian ensemble Trio Da Kali—in concert and on the 2017 recording Ladilikan. With singer Hawa Kassé Mady Diabaté delivering the vocal in an impassioned contralto akin to that of Jackson, the strings supplied the accompaniment that had been played on organ by Estelle Allen in 1937. Retooling the piece for Kronos’ performance repertoire came naturally. “I looked at the arrangement,” Harrington explains, “and realized that [violinist] John [Sherba] and [cellist] Sunny [Yang] and I could play all the chord notes—most of the time we’re playing double stops—and that Hank [Dutt] could play the melody on viola.”\n\nAll four musicians pored over the 1937 Mahalia Jackson recording. “It became like a score, really,” Harrington says. “Hank, in particular, studied Mahalia’s vocal vocabulary. The biggest challenge was getting the emotional message of the voice.” For Harrington, Sherba, and Yang to sound even more organ-like, Kronos employs a sound design originally developed for their interpretation of the Swedish folk song “Tusen Tankar”, on which, Harrington says, “we needed to approximate a harmonium.” With Dutt filling Mahalia Jackson’s lead role, the other three musicians use heavy, metal practice mutes that dampen the strings, and sound engineer Scott Fraser adds various effects, including an octave divider on the cello.\n\n“It’s an extension of our work,” Harrington notes. “It’s very natural. The more I’ve played with Hank over the years, the more I’ve known that his sound and Mahalia’s deserve mention in the same sentence. The performance brings together something that belongs together.”\n\nProgram note by Derk Richardson\n\nStacy Garrop is a freelance composer whose music is centered on dramatic and lyrical storytelling. Garrop has received the Barlow Prize, a Fromm Music Foundation grant, three Barlow Endowment commissions, and the Sackler Music Composition Prize, along with prizes from competitions sponsored by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Civic Orchestra of Chicago, Omaha Symphony, New England Philharmonic, Boston Choral Ensemble, Utah Arts Festival, and Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble. Theodore Presser Company publishes her chamber and orchestral works; she self-publishes her choral pieces under Inkjar Publishing Company. She is a recording artist with Cedille Records with pieces on nine CDs; her works are also commercially available on ten additional labels.

Studs’ curious, inquisitive nature led him to interview people from all walks of life over the course of his career. For WFMT alone, he conducted over 5,000 interviews. Before he worked for WFMT, Studs had a radio program called ‘The Wax Museum’ on WENR in Chicago. It was on this radio network that Studs first featured the glorious voice of Mahalia Jackson.\n\n“Studs heard Mahalia sing for the first time around 1946. He was in a record store in Chicago when Mahalia’s voice rang out over the store’s speakers. Studs was captivated; he had to meet the woman who possessed that remarkable voice. At that time, Mahalia was gaining fame as a singer of gospels and spirituals in black churches both within Chicago and out of it, as she did a fair amount of touring around the country. Outside of these black communities, however, Mahalia wasn’t yet known. With a little sleuthing, Studs discovered where she regularly sang, at the Greater Salem Baptist Church on the South Side of Chicago. Studs went to the church, introduced himself to Mahalia, and invited her to sing on his radio program. Studs and Mahalia developed a close friendship over the ensuing decades, and they occasionally worked together professionally. As Mahalia rose to international fame and became known as the greatest gospel singer of her time, she and Studs never lost contact.\n\n“In researching WFMT’s Studs Terkel Radio Archive, I found several broadcasts when Studs featured Mahalia Jackson and her recordings on his show. Two broadcasts in particular stood out. The first broadcast occurred in 1963, when the pair sat down for a conversation that covered a wide range of topics, including Mahalia’s experiences of working in the South, the continuing hardships she faces being a woman of color, and the civil rights efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Reverend Ralph Abernathy, and many others (including Mahalia, who was a staunch supporter of Dr. King). The second broadcast dates from 1957; it features Mahalia performing a number of gospels and spirituals for a live audience at a hotel in Chicago. In crafting my composition, I decided to highlight many of the salient points of Studs’ and Mahalia’s 1963 discussion, with a musical performance from the 1957 concert featured prominently in the work.\n\n“Glorious Mahalia consists of five movements. In movement 1, Mahalia discusses the origin and meaning of the spiritual Hold on. In Stave in the ground (movement 2), she and Studs talk about the work she did when living in the South, and the continuing prejudice she faces. This is followed by a more heated discussion between Studs and Mahalia in Are you being treated right (movement 3). The fourth movement features Mahalia’s soulful performance of the spiritual Sometime I feel like a motherless child. The piece concludes with This world will make you think (movement 5), in which Mahalia speaks of her hope that we can unite as one nation.\n\n“Kronos Quartet commissioned Glorious Mahalia for Carnegie Hall’s The 60’s: The Years That Changed America concert series. I wish to thank Kronos Quartet’s violinist David Harrington for suggesting Mahalia Jackson’s interviews with Studs Terkel as the topic for the piece, as well as Tony Macaluso, Director of the WFMT Radio Network and the Studs Terkel Radio Archive, and Allison Schein, Archivist for the Studs Terkel Radio Archive, for their help in locating and securing my chosen broadcasts within the Archive.”\n\n[exact credit language is being confirmed by publisher] Voice of Studs Terkel courtesy of the Estate of Studs Terkel.

While vanguard bandleaders and composers such as Charles Mingus, Max Roach, and Sonny Rollins coupled their creative breakthroughs with powerful statements denouncing white supremacy and supporting the struggle for civil rights, Coltrane channeled his energy into spiritual masterpieces like A Love Supreme and Meditations. But no musician ever responded to an atrocity with more soulful, anguished humanity than Coltrane’s “Alabama,” a piece the saxophonist wrote in the aftermath of the infamous 1963 KKK bombing of Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church that killed four little girls. Released on the 1964 album Live at Birdland (Impulse!), but actually recorded in the studio just weeks after the bombing, the elegy features Coltrane’s classic combo with pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones.\n\nColtrane structured “Alabama” around the speech that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave in the church’s sanctuary three days after the bombing, moving from unfathomable sorrow to steely determination. Kronos commissioned Jacob Garchik to create an arrangement as part of Carnegie Hall’s winter 2018 festival “The ’60s: The Years that Changed America,” with the intention of premiering “Alabama” as an encore for that concert, “but we ran out of time,” David Harrington says. “Now we have this beautiful version, where each one of us gets to pay homage to the sound of John Coltrane.”\n\n“Alabama” isn’t Kronos’ first Trane ride. Working with tenor sax great Joe Henderson, the quartet performed a Jimmy Heath arrangement of Coltrane’s sublime ballad “Naima” back in the ‘80s, a collaboration that went undocumented. But Harrington only discovered “Alabama” recently after Songlines editor Jo Frost wrote about listening to the piece on the same day that white supremacists marched in Charlottesville. Coltrane’s music is timeless, but “Alabama” is infuriatingly timely once again. Harrington quickly sought out the recording and was struck again by Coltrane’s elemental power, “one of the most central sounds in American music,” Harrington says. “Minutes later I was in touch with Jacob.”\n\nFor Garchik, the assignment came as something of a surprise. Though the jazz trombonist is widely respected on the New York scene, his work for Kronos usually involves arranging “all kinds of music I’m not familiar with from faraway places,” he says. “This was close to home. I tried to capture the subtly and simplicity of ‘Alabama’ with an arrangement that lets the quartet concentrate on the beautiful lines that Coltrane created. I kept the melody intact, but focused on the recitation part at the beginning, and accentuated its intensity. It’s a very striking and mysterious piece, unlike anything else that Coltrane wrote.”\n\nProgram note by Andrew Gilbert\n\nThe Sun Rises\n\nVanishing Lines\n\nMy Ruthless Companion\n\nArranged by Sahba Aminikia (b. 1981)\n\nAbout The Sun Rises, Sahba Aminikia writes:\n\n“Mahsa Vahdat is one of the most iconic female singers of contemporary, post-revolutionary Iran. She and her sister Marjan Vahdat have toured around the globe and have held numerous concerts throughout Asia, Europe, North America, and Africa, while maintaining their roles as strong advocates of freedom of expression.\n\n“Since the Islamic revolution in 1979, women have been banned from singing in public, and especially in front of male audiences. Mahsa and Marjan Vahdat’s appearance on a scene from the controversial movie about Tehran’s underground music scene, “No One Knows About Persian Cats” (2009), while singing without Hijab on a rooftop in Tehran presented a monumental image of freedom to the young women of my country for decades to come.\n\n“I am honored that I was able to bring the forces of Mahsa Vahdat and Kronos Quartet together and was able to help with this historic collaboration. This piece embodies three of Mahsa Vahdat’s songs from two of her solo albums, Traces of an Old Vineyard and A Capella - The Sun Will Rise.”\n\nTexts\n\nThe Sun Rises\n\nPoem by Forough Farrokhzad\n\nSee how sorrow melts drop by drop\n\nIn my eyes\n\nHow my mutinous shadow\n\nBecomes prey for the Sun\n\nSee\n\nHow my whole existence is in ruins\n\nAn ember set fire to my being\n\nI am lifted to heights\n\nI am trapped\n\nSee\n\nHow my entire horizon\n\nFills with shooting stars\n\nYou came from afar\n\nFrom the land of perfume and light\n\nYou set me on a Stellar path\n\nYou take me beyond stars\n\nNow that we are treading on heights\n\nWash me with waves of wine\n\nWrap me in the velvet of your kiss\n\nWant me in the lasting nights\n\nLeave me no more\n\nSeparate me not from these stars\n\nSee\n\nHow you shine and the Sun rises\n\nVanishing Lines\n\nPoem by Hafez\n\nEnglish translation: Sohrab Mahdavi\n\nA life ring is my longing for you,\n\ndrowning, as I am, in wine\n\nAdvise the barrel to keep the air locked,\n\nfor the tavern is in ruins\n\nThe beloved is gone and in my tearful eyes\n\nHer image can only be drawn in vanishing lines\n\nWake up my eyes for there is great peril\n\nIn this onslaught of sleep of mine\n\nThe mountains and plains are full and verdant\n\nThis world is but a passing current,\n\nlet us waste no time\n\nMy Ruthless Companion\n\nPoem by Rumi\n\nEnglish translation: Sohrab Mahdavi\n\nOh my companion, my ruthless companion\n\nMy beloved and my treasurer, my ally and my secret bearer\n\nOn earth you are my moon, at midnight you are my morning dawn\n\nOh, my sweet mist, you are my protection in this storm\n\nYou find your way into my soul like a healing worm\n\nYou are my faith and my religion, a sea of gems brimming\n\nYou are a torch to night-farers, a rope to the drowning\n\nYou are a compass to any caravan, you are my guide\n\nYou are my cellmate in this prison, a laughing master at my side\n\nTo be in your presence requires a hundred times my best stride\n\nArranged by Aftab Darvishi (b. 1987)\n\nAbout Where Is Your Voice, Mahsa Vahdat writes:\n\n“Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, solo women’s voice has been restricted in Iran. Women singers can only perform in a choir, or sing solo in the presence of female-only audiences.\n\n“It’s a tremendous sadness that women have been forbidden to freely sing in Iran, and for many talented artists at some point the path became so challenging they had to give it up entirely. To prevent a people from participating in one of their great cultural and human treasures is extremely sorrowful and tragic and act of injustice. However, the fact that this woman vocal tradition has still been preserved in spite of these restrictions is incredibly inspiring; this proves that it’s impossible to keep some artists from pursuing their art, regardless of the consequences. In fact, many have chosen to walk their paths with even stronger conviction and dedication.\n\n“I made this text and melody and I would like to dedicate this song to Women's voices in Iran. The music has been arranged by Aftab Darvishi for Kronos Quartet & Mahsa Vahdat”\n\nMahsa Vahdat’s Where Is Your Voice?, arranged by Aftab Darvishi, was commissioned for Kronos Quartet and Mahsa Vahdat by the Hamid and Christina Moghadam Program in Iranian Studies at Stanford University.\n\nText\n\nWhere is your voice?\n\nWhere is your voice?\n\nWhere is your voice?\n\nIn the throat of the Moon?\n\nIn the red breaths of the thirsty lips of a lover?\n\nIn a free song?\n\nWith thirst for hope a bird is flying\n\nIn the blue tears a song constantly is born\n\nwith a ruby throat she sings till eternity\n\nwith her young lips.\n\nWhere is your voice?\n\nWhere is your voice?\n\nIn the voiceless lament of the mother who shed her tears over nameless graves in the sparks of the love of your glance that illuminated the core of my heart and made the voice fertile with red flames\n\nWhere is your voice?\n\nWhere is your voice?\n\nPlaceless (arr.

We are proud to recognize those who are helping secure the Society’s future with a gift to the Philharmonic Forward Campaign. We are grateful for their support, which will help fuel the Society’s growth and provide a legacy of incomparable music and superb music education programs in perpetuity\n\nDonna L.
