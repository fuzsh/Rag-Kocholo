Previously Sold Videos Now Available Free of Charge to Over a Quarter Million Monthly Visitors

RESTON, Va. - March 4, 2008 - AppDeploy, the Internet's largest free online community of application and computer administrators, announced today it is now offering its entire library of technical video instruction free of charge. The training videos cover a myriad of complex Windows-based application deployment tasks, including repackaging, Windows Installer, and systems deployment functions. Hosted by industry expert and AppDeploy founder Bob Kelly, the downloadable videos, previously sold on DVD, are being offered online at AppDeploy.com.

With over 19,000 registered members, and more than 250,000 visitors per month, AppDeploy has become a proven and respected resource for administrators to share their "in the trenches" advice about complex software deployment issues Â– saving members precious time and money. The exclusive, step-by-step training videos offer instant access to expert, best practices advice on today's most complex software and application deployment challenges, such as:

* MSI repackaging and best practices

* Troubleshooting Windows Installer

* Deployment tips such as how to automatically search for prerequisites during installation

"AppDeploy is about cultivating a unique community of IT professionals who have the same goals in mindÂ—knowledge sharing and education." said Bob Kelly, founder of AppDeploy and senior product manager at KACE. "The IT departments of today are plagued by the challenges associated with application and software deployment complexity. I addition, many of these IT departments are under-staffed and budget-constrained, highlighting the immediate value stemming from free training on how to correctly meet deployment challenges."

"This video library is an excellent contribution not only for packaging guidance but also to show our staff who focus on application management the complexity, flexibility, and benefits of Windows Installer technology," said Kim Bokholm, desktop management consultant at QBranch. "Being an expert in desktop management, Bob Kelly has provided a great resource over the years by offering IT administrators the tools to help each other and the platform to share best practices regarding the IT challenges we face every day."

AppDeploy.com was acquired by KACE, the leading systems management appliance company, in 2007. This relationship has sparked the continuous development of AppDeploy's online community, while integrating its extensive deployment knowledge base directly into the KACE KBOX(tm) family of management appliances in the form of an exclusive feature called "AppDeploy Live".
