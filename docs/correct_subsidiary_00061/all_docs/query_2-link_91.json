To get the best results make sure you read through all material prior to using your Quest Product.\n\nHow to import a job from a CSV file.\n\nHow to remove version 7.x\n\nDoes Secure Copy support use of wildcards for filtering files and folders?\n\nWhile migrating local groups and users to Active Directory, some groups did not migrate correctly. The program was not using the authenticating domain controller.\n\nHow to subscribe to RSS Feeds/Product Notifications to opt into support notifications to receive emails about the latest software patches, version releases, and updates to our Knowledge Base.\n\nWhen excluding subfolders contained within a parent folder using the filter option \"Include / Exclude folders\" | \"Exclude folder names\". The folder location entered is the UNC path of the folder. When the job is executed, Secure Copy does not exclude the folders.Example: \\\\Servername\\Share\\FolderName\n\nHow to migrate and synchronize user folders when the source and target path names are different, but the folder names remain the same.Migrating selected user folders from one file server to another is normally a simple process, however, browsing and manually selecting the desired user from a lengthy folder browser list is less than desirable. In addition, if the source path and target paths names ...\n\nHow to turn off the (SIP) Software Improvement Program option.\n\nBelow is a list of the recommended software along with any documentation that will help with the install process to bring your product to the version referenced.\n\nYes, with the following exception. Once any job(s) has been executed, even if the job is started and stopped, the license may only move if the original source or target device is decommissioned and the same machine name is used for the replacement device. Once used in a job, the license is tied to the device and may only be moved to another source or target device with an identical host name.\n\nNote: It is important to confirm your source and target prior to starting the configured job.\n\nThe Secure Copy latest version is 7.5 In the Download New Releases site, it is displayed as Secure Copy 7.5\n\nTechnical Support has reviewed all the support information and has identified the most popular helpful tips and how to videos or articles to ensure you get the most out of your Quest Product.\n\nWhen trying to open the recent Secure Copy log file on a Job that is completed according to a refreshed Job Status: The selected log file is in use. Please allow the job to complete before accessing.\n\nThe Secure Copy application produces log files with .SCL extension. At times, similar log files are produced in the Logging folder that have the extension .SCLTWhat is the purpose of the .SCLT files?\n\nSecure Copy 4.1.1 and above - File shares are copied to the incorrect cluster group on the target location.\n\nNeed ability to pause a copy job during business hours and then resume it after business hours.\n\nUnable to copy over the “Share Permission” from Admin source share (ex. D$ on NetApp vFiler) to target share.\n\nWould like “Job Status” or a report to include additional columns, such as Date, Job Name/ID, Source Path, Destination Path, Data Size, Number of files, Copy Start Time, Delta Copy Time, and Errors.\n\nSome Network Attached Storage [=(NAS) devices contain configuration (.ini, .cfg, .xml) files or history (.his) files that define operations on the device. Because corresponding files do not exist on the NTFS storage device acting as the Source of the copy job, the files will be purged when sychronization and incremental copy jobs are performed.\n\nWhen running the Test job feature, can the file count be greater than 10000 files?\n\nData Deduplication is a technique for reducing the amount of storage space an organization needs to save its data, which is a new feature in Windows 2012. Does Secure Copy Support Windows 2012 feature Data Deduplication?\n\nThe information below represents the most common issues customers are encountering or recent resolutions to help you trouble shoot your Quest Product.\n\nCopy jobs involving NetAPP devices on Source or Target of the migration have the data on all files and folders copied correctly. However all permissions from the Source are missing.Typically, 'Everyone' credential with Full permissions is left on the Access Control List (ACL) on the target device. 'Everyone' group might not have been present on the Source paths or data.\n\nIn the Secure Copy console, the user may open Help menu | License Status, select the License and click 'Details'. The license details do not include the expiration date of the license.\n\nSecure Copy - 'The security ID structure is invalid' error when copying dataThis error is generated when an attempt to read or write security descriptor information fails because an invalid security identifier (SID) was encountered in the security descriptor information. Alternate Error\"This security ID may not be assigned as the owner of this object.\"This error is generated when...\n\nDuplicate server names appear in the licensed server list. One in upper case and the other in lower case. A copy job returns an error when started:\"You have exceeded your licensed server quantity. Please contact your reseller or Quest Representative in order to purchase additional licenses\"The same copy job with the same server definitions has already run successfully.\n\nAttempting to apply the license after installation produces the following error message on the console of the machine where the application is installed: \"The following error was encountered while attempting to load the license file: The system cannot find the path specified. [3]\"\n\nAfter a migration between shares using Secure Copy 7, a folder is unexpectedly created at the root of the target share. The new folder contains the files to be migrated.At times, a \"$\" symbol is appended to the folder name.This occurs even if the option to 'Create initial source folder under target folder' is not enabled.\n\nCopy jobs enumerate the files system, but errors occur in the Summary page and logs: \"The file size exceeds the limit allowed and cannot be saved\".\n\nJob Reports sent via e-mail are blank or empty.\n\nNo. Term Licenses are designed to work together only with the servers for which they were originally purchased. For this reason it is important to review the total number of servers/devices that will be part of your migration.\n\nNo. Only the number of servers are counted. For NAS and SAN systems, it is only the number of named server(s) that are counted – not the number of storage nodes or disk arrays.\n\nProduct Life Cycle\n\nSoftware\n\nVersion Full Support as of Limited Support as of Support Discontinued 7.6.x 8/4/2020 7.5.1 8/6/2019 1/31/2021 7/31/2021\n\nEarlier product versions not listed are considered discontinued.\n\nThe Product Support Life Cycle table above describes the phase during which products are eligible for product support and new release downloads.\n\nAs a result of Quest's recent divestiture from Dell, Quest acquired a number of products from Dell. Some of these legacy products found on this website may still contain Dell branding. However, these products are now owned and supported solely by Quest and not Dell. Dell is not affiliated with these products or services and any services Quest provides for these products is independent of Dell.\n\nProduct Support Policies\n\nThe Product Support Lifecycle describes the phases during which our products are eligible for patches (fixes), support and downloads from the Support Portal.\n\nIt is our policy to provide support and fixes in current versions of our products when you are under a current support agreement. Fixes to older versions are at our discretion. We strive to put resources behind the most recent product releases in order to continually improve and enhance the value of our products.\n\nWe will attempt to answer questions on older versions of our products provided resources are available; however, if you are using a discontinued version, we encourage you to upgrade to the currently supported version of the product.\n\nOur usual support policy is to provide support on both the current (n) and prior (n-1) versions of our products. Refer to the product lifecycle table on your Product Support Page or Knowledge Base for more information.\n\nFull Support\n\nProduct is fully supported, generally available release/version.\n\nIncludes most current released version of a product and one or more prior releases.\n\nEnhancement requests for this release are accepted and may be considered for future releases.\n\nMaintenance releases and/or hot fixes are periodically made available for this release.\n\nRelease/version is fully supported by both Support and Development.\n\nRelease/version is available for download from Support Portal.\n\nLimited Support\n\nSupport is available for this release/version, and we will use best efforts to provide known workarounds or fixes.\n\nNo new code fixes will be generated except under extreme circumstances and at our discretion.\n\nEnhancement requests are not accepted.\n\nYou are encouraged to plan an upgrade to a release/version on \"Full Support\".\n\nRelease/version is available for download from the Support Portal.\n\nDiscontinued\n\nIncludes release/versions which are retired or discontinued.\n\nNo new patches or fixes will be created for this release.\n\nRelease is not available for download from the Support Portal.\n\nSupport will be provided to assist with upgrading to a supported version.\n\nSupport is not obligated to provide assistance on this version of the product.\n\nContinuing Support\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade or migrate your product prior to its end-of-life, for products that do not offer Long Term Support (LTS) releases, we offer a Continuing Support service to provide you with one year of limited support beyond your software's end-of-life or end-of-support date. Continuing Support is no guaranteed on every product.\n\nAnnual software maintenance contract must be renewed.\n\nIncludes uninterrupted access to technical support via phone, online and chat.\n\nSupport Engineers will provide known workaround solutions and fixes.\n\nFee-based service available on selected products.\n\nProduct Enhancements\n\nIf you are interested in submitting product enhancement requests, you can do so by creating a case with support. When we receive a product enhancement request, the Support Engineer will work to define and clearly document the request. Once documented, the request will be submitted into the enhancement review system, the identification number will be provided to the submitter, and the support case will be closed.\n\nProduct Management will review the open enhancement requests on a periodic basis and consider them for inclusion in a future product release. Product enhancements will not be considered or implemented in current or prior product releases. There is no guarantee that a specific enhancement request will be implemented in a future version of our product. It is at our discretion if a certain enhancement will be offered for an additional charge or as a chargeable option.\n\nProduct Defects\n\nIf your issue is determined to be a defect in the product, it is recorded in our defect tracking system, a unique Defect Identifier (ID) will be provided to you and the support case will be closed. Notifications of new product releases will be emailed to you as long as you who have configured your profile to receive product notifications. Release Notes for new releases of products will contain the list of Defect Identifiers that were addressed in the release. You can review the release notes or search the Knowledge Base on the Support Portal using your Defect Identifier to see if the issue has been addressed. We do not guarantee that all defects identified will be fixed in a future release of the product.\n\nOur products have license keys generated for their use. Some products require a new license key when upgrading to a new release and/or patch. We also recommend that prior to any migration or upgrade of products, new licenses are confirmed as functioning properly as some license keys are machine and machine name specific.\n\nIf you have questions regarding licensing of a product please complete the form available on the Support Portal Licensing Page. A Software Licensing Representative will respond to your query within 24 hours.\n\nYou may also email the Software Licensing team: license@quest.com.\n\nSupport for Trial Users\n\nWe offer software trials on selected products for testing purposes. Support for trial users is limited to 30 days from the registration date. Cases for your trial product may only be submitted during the first 30 days of your testing period. You will still have unlimited access to our Support Portal for accessing the Knowledge Base and Product Pages.\n\nCustomizations policy for Software and Hardware products\n\nA customization indicates functionality and configurations added to a product that are not provided as part of the core product release and, as such, would be outside the scope of normal support and maintenance. Customizations may take the form of new or modified scripts used within or alongside our products, as well as additional functionality such as custom reports, dashboards, rules, automated actions, etc. developed by you, your partners, or our Professional Services Organization.\n\nSupport and Customizations\n\nWe do not perform or maintain customizations. The design and development of customizations to our products is your responsibility. Assistance from Support will be limited to helping ensure that the product's functionality which enables the addition of customizations is functioning as expected. Alternatively, you may obtain guidance through product specific community sites or the Support Knowledge Base.\n\nAdvanced Assistance\n\nIf more thorough and detailed assistance is needed to design and develop customizations, we recommend that you engage our Professional Services Organization or fully certified partners to assist. Their expertise in designing customized solutions will ensure customers receive maximum value and product adoption. In addition to providing post-implementation expert services, Professional Services also offers a variety of pre-packaged customizations for some products which may meet your specific requirements.\n\nTraining & Certification\n\nWe recommend that you obtain the appropriate product training before attempting to design, develop, and implement any customization to our products. Our training courses will equip you with the necessary knowledge and ability to design and implement effective changes to our products. For more detail on the training services available, please refer to Training & Certification Services .\n\nMaintaining Customizations\n\nCareful consideration should be given to all customizations during future migration or upgrade exercises to new product and platform versions. Customizations could inhibit the upgrade itself and may require a level of re-work to continue functioning properly. Support does not take ownership for any customizations. We strongly encourage you to document and maintain records on any implemented customization work. These records can be useful in isolating problems that may be attributable to the customization or a defect in the core product.\n\nSupport Policy on Virtualization\n\nVirtualization is a technique for hiding the physical characteristics of computing resources from the way in which other systems, applications or end users interact with those resources. It is able to make a single physical resource, such as a server, operating system, application or storage device, appear to function as multiple logical devices. It can also make multiple physical resources such as storage devices or servers appear as a single logical resource. As a result virtualization enables IT departments to increase the utilization of resources, increase high availability, and simplify back-up, systems administration and recovery procedures. It also allows IT departments to be more responsive to the dynamic needs of the business. Examples of virtualization technologies include VMware ESX Server, Citrix/XenServer and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V.\n\nOur products leverage the binary compatibility offered through virtualization technologies, which provide complete transparency to the operating systems and applications deployed. As a result, for all casework received where the Software product is being used in a virtual environment, we will assume that the problem is common to both native and virtual operating environments, and that we will only require the customer to recreate the problem in a native environment if and when there is reason to believe that the problem is unique to the virtual environment itself.\n\nFrom a purely functional perspective, our products will operate in exactly the same way, however we can make no guarantees with respect to performance or scalability in a virtualization environment running multiple virtual instances. Configuration aspects such as CPU, memory availability, I/O subsystem and network infrastructure can all influence such a deployment, which should be given careful consideration to ensure the virtual layer has the necessary resources available to provide a satisfactory user experience.\n\nSupport Policy on Third-Party Software\n\nWe are committed to providing products which work on the latest platforms and technologies available in the industry today. We work closely with technology vendors to ensure earliest possible compatibility with our solutions. We provide full details of all systems requirements, together with platform and third-party product versions supported with our products, in the Release Notes published for each product. These include operating system versions, service pack levels, mail clients or server versions, database versions, browsers and other related technology supported and at which particular version level our products have been formally tested and certified to run against. The support of future platform versions, new service packs and other related technologies would be taken into consideration and addressed during the regular product maintenance and release cycles of our products. This provides ongoing upward compatibility of our products as used in customer environments. It should be noted therefore that there could be a delay between the availability of the latest platform technology release or service patch, and the product version certified to operate against this. Please contact Support should you have any questions with regards to the current support status of any product and a particular related platform, patch or third-party product support not explicitly documented in our release notes.\n\nFor more information about the latest third-party platforms and versions supported, please review the System Requirements section of the release notes for your product or search our Knowledge Base on the Support Portal. Please note that while we do not directly or officially support third-party software, we work closely with many other providers to ensure our customers receive the best possible service at all times.\n\nRegional software license agreement applicable to your use of the software is available below (including software preinstalled on hardware or made available to you by download, disk media or otherwise, at no additional cost).\n\nClick here to find your regional agreement.\n\nSee all Support Policies"
