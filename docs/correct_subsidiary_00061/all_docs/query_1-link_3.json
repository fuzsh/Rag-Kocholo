        "text": "Application Deployment Information Center Now Online\n\nEvery network faces the problem of deploying updates, fixes and new applications on a regular basis- now there is a place to view detailed information on all the products that can help. AppDeploy.com is a clearinghouse for installation creation software, deployment tools, and drive imaging utilities.\n\nEven when managing networks of less than 50 computers, it quickly becomes a burden to keep up with the requests and demands for new software, service packs, and hotfixes. Employing any of the dozens of installation creation software on the market can take a valuable step in automating this task by creating an installation “package”. In this way, the steps normally required by the manual installation of an application are instead combined into a single step. This both simplifies the installation process and allows the user receiving the update to have little or (preferably) no involvement in the installation or update. A number of deployment tools are available to satisfy getting these packages out across the network. If asked what tools exist to do this job, most would say SMS or perhaps Tivoli. The problem is, how many people have heard of Cognet, Altiris Express, or any of the other competitive products that can be even more suitable than these more prevalent products?\n\nWhen deploying a whole new workstation or client system, employing drive image technology can save hours and greatly simplify the process. Again, most think of Ghost, but other products like ImageCast IC3, Drive Image Pro and Flash Clone are debatably superior products for the job.\n\nAside from detailed information and links on every known product, a message board to discuss any problems, solutions, or product questions can also be found at AppDeploy.com. Until now there has been no specialized forum to exchange information on this topic.\n\nA script exchange area is provided as a place for visitors to upload and download scripts created to help automate the task of remote deployments. When automating updates and installations scripting becomes an essential skill of the trade.\n\nApplication deployment news, articles, a chat room and a newsletter round off the services that this resource center provides, equipping visitors with everything needed to get the job done right."
