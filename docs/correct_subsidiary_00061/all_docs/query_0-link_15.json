It provided a variety of information with its application knowledge base. There could be little tips like the command line parameters that allow for a silent deployment or where to download the .msi version of the installer. It has become quite the community for IT professionals sharing information to do a better job.\n\nOver this past weekend, AppDeploy.com evolved into ITNinja.com. One reason for the change was to broaden the scope of the community to all IT topics and not just application installation. Along with all the great deployment information (discussions, package KBs, downloads, tips, etc), user accounts were also migrated from AppDeploy to ITNinja.\n\nTo learn more about the changes to the site, check out the Site Tour.\n\nAppDeploy.com was acquired by KACE Networks in 2007 and KACE Networks was acquired by Dell in February 2010."
