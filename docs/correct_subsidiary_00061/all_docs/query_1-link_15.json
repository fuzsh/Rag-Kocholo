In simple terms it simplifies how IT generalists manage their endpoint computers – desktops, laptops, servers. While we compete with the best of features, we don’t emphasize speeds and feeds – it’s about your time… it’s about going home to spend time with your family because your work got done without a hitch – it’s personal. That’s why we have over 5200 customers as of January 2012 and that’s why over 350 customer fanatics gathered in San Francisco for our 2011 annual user conference to celebrate their purchase of a Dell KACE Appliance and learn more about how to use it in their environment. Believe it or not, Dell KACE is the only systems management solution with a cult-like following.\n\n3 Systems management remains difficult\n\nMixed environments, including BYOD Inventory New security threats Remote-site management Patching License compliance Strategic projects Deployment Mobile device management With limited staff and budget it’s difficult to focus on strategic projects Systems management is hard. Systems management has been around for decades and despite the many tools and management suites that are available today, the problems associated with managing disparate desktops and servers persist. There are (name a few prospect pain points) Regulations your organization has to comply with like SOX, PCI, HIPAA Increased need to manage remote or distributed environments Added threats from end points and applications Need to accomplish more without added staff or budget Frequency of multi-OS environments, including Windows, OS X (Mac) and Linux Deployment How do I image new systems? How do I re-image systems? How do I migrate user settings to new systems? Security How do you keep PCs patched and up to date? How do you know users haven’t disabled your security controls? How do you know what is connected to your network? Compliance Would you pass a software license compliance audit today? Are you wasting money on unused software licenses? How do you measure and enforce regulatory compliance? Visibility Which systems are running out of space? Which systems have expired warranties? Which systems are Windows 7 compliant?\n\n4 Today’s endpoint management solutions leave large market needs unaddressed\n\nManagement Suites Have long, services-heavy deployments Require complex, expensive architectures Have high maintenance costs Scalable Low TCO Right-sized Simple to maintain Point Solutions Are not integrated Are diﬃcult to manage Create ineﬃcient processes Oﬀer limited functionality Company size IT budget Functionality KACE fills the need between point solutions and complex, expensive management suites. On the low end are freeware and point solutions such as Spiceworks that just don’t provide the comprehensive tools that IT managers need. They either are not sophisticated enough or just don’t integrate so you have to learn and use different tools with different interfaces for different functions On the high end, there are sophisticated management suites that are very comprehensive, yet require dedicated people to run, require extensive and expensive customization to operate and have high maintenance fees. Examples are LanDesk, Symantec and Microsoft SCCM. KACE is designed to be: comprehensive – scales from 100 to 20,000 manage clients Affordable - a simple pricing plan makes this affordable for most IT departments Easy-to-use – simple to learn and maintain. What all this means is that with KACE management appliances you can free up your time so that the daily mundane administrative tasks that so often consume many IT groups can be minimized giving you the opportunity to focus on higher value tasks and the strategic considerations of your job… and maybe even have some time for yourself.\n\n5 Endpoint systems management\n\nThe Dell KACE Family of Appliances Dell KACE is the leading systems management appliance company. We offer 2 easy-to-use, affordable appliances that meet system management needs from initial computer deployment to ongoing management and retirement.

The K1000 patching function gives administrators the flexibility to implement the patch management process that fits their environment best. Administrators can choose to download only the operating system and application patches relevant to their network, eliminating the need to manage patches that are not applicable. And with integrated inventory and service desk, the time to resolve problems can be greatly decreased.

IT just never fully adopted Vista over XP with reports showing that 50 to 80% of businesses staying with XP. The compelling issue for migration is that support for XP will run out in 2014 and many will want to have completed their migrations far before then. With the typical Windows 7 roll out taking 14 to 18 months and the expected rollout of Office 2010 expected to take just as long, we expect to see the vast majority of companies migrating in 2011 through 2012. In our October 2010 survey of IT managers only 7% of respondents have fully deployed Win7 which is up from 1% in our January survey And 38% have partial rollout vs. 15% in January 2010 4% have fully deployed Office 2010 with a whopping 52% not even deployed to test machines 60% indicated they will roll out Office 2010 in 2011 and 2012.\n\n29 KACE Appliances automate Windows 7 migration\n\nKACE Appliances include the tools you need to ensure a successful migration Inventory Readiness Initial OS Deployment User State Migration Software Distribution Patch Management Asset Management Dell KACE Appliances help optimize the process of migrating to the Windows 7 operating system through easy to deploy and use appliances. The KACE appliance-based approach saves you time and money through a solution that helps facilitate tasks such as user state migration, operating system deployment and application distribution, helping speed the move to Windows 7 and minimizing end-user downtime. Upon successfully completing a Windows 7 migration, KACE appliances can assist to provide PC lifecycle management including patch and configuration management, providing even more potential savings. KACE recommends a 7 step process to methodically migrate to Windows 7. The appliances themselves assist with such tasks as readiness assessment, OS deployment and software distribution, and patch and asset management- system wide. The K1000 is used to assess your systems’ readiness by providing you with a complete inventory of what software and hardware you use. Armed with that information, you can determine which of your applications are compatible and which may need remediation so you can plan for those development tasks long before you purchase new hardware. Once you are ready to migrate, the K2000 simplifies the process of OS imaging and distribution along with user state migration. Finally, once the migration is complete, the K1000 inventory capabilities enable you to audit your systems to ensure that the appropriate software was installed on the desired systems and you can establish a regular schedule of patching and updating.\n\n30 Appendix 2 Other Dell Offerings\n\n31 Dell KACE and Dell AppAssure\n\nUnified Data Protection and Systems Management Reduce amount of backup data Maximize disk space Help cut network costs Identify machines in your environment that are not protected with the K1000 and protect them with AppAssure Push AppAssure software updates automatically\n\n32 Dell KACE and Dell Data Protection and Encryption (DDP|E)\n\nImprove visibility and protection of data assets Centrally manage software patching processes, port controls and encryption policies Achieve software license compliance Manage and protect system configurations DDPE and KACE solution sheet: What does this mean for IT administrators?

If the remote agent is not present the communication channel to the remote system is lost. This can be caused by multiple conditions like system being switched off, system failing to load network driver etc. In this state it is necessary for an engineer to physically be present in order to rectify the issue. If the PC client is geographically remote then this results in high travel costs and longer time to resolution. With Intel vPro support the K1000 can be configured to take full control of the remote PC even in the absence of the management agent. The Intel vPro technology on the remote PC allows the K1000 to take full hardware control of the PC thereby allowing IT administrators to address hardware issues remotely without having to fly out an engineer.\n\n38 Integrated remote collaboration with Bomgar improves customer satisfaction\n\nSupport Organization End-User Initiate support session from within K ticket Initiate support session from ticket confirmation All session transcripts saved within K1000 ticket Survey to measure and track customer satisfaction Remediate from within the K console Bomgar’s integration with Dell KACE allows a support organizations to enage with end-users in a collaborative fashion from within the K1000 console.

The custo,izable surveys allow for measuring and tracking custo,er satisfaction. This improves First Contact Resolution (FCR) and Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) thereby improving IT service quality which in turn result in reduced employee down-time. Results in money savings by avoiding travel costs Also According to Gartner1, labor costs represent 80 to 90% of total support costs. Moreover Level 2 and Level 3 support staff costs are significantly higher than Level 1 support staff. So companies can save significantly by maximizing the number of issues resolved by Level 1 staff. Bomgar integration increases the first contact resoltion percentages resulting in optimization of IT support costs thereby saving money for the organization. And finally Most organizations today have a distributed structure with remote offices spread out across geographies. With Bomgar integration support staff can remotely log into systems to diagnose and remediate issues. IT administrators can trouble shoot remote clients without having to do a desk visit thereby saving them time and money allowing them to spend time on more strategic projects.\n\n40 Appendix 4 Customers\n\n41 Dell KACE in Business Services\n\n“ Now with the KACE Appliance we have our field machines checking in and the installs just run in the background.
