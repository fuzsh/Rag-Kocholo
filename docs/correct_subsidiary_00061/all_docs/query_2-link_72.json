        "text": "The workstation is a member of the source domain and the user that uses the workstation is a member of the target domain. I will assume a one-way trust as that is required to allows target users to login to source joined workstations.\n\nThe migration process is the same as all other migrations. The only difference in your case is there is NOTHING to update for the target user on the workstation as any permissions they have are already tied to their target account.\n\nDeploy agent (discovery task)\n\nResource process task\n\nMove task to join yo the target\n\nClean up task to remove the agent.\n\nall product documentation can be found here. https://support.quest.com/migration-manager-for-ad/8.15/technical-documents\n\nThis section of this document outline a lot in this area, but there is. No single step by step for just the process. The overall topic is larger and documented as such.\n\nHI Jeff,\n\nThanks for your response.\n\nI think the statement your provided that will work for On-premises Workstations.\n\nHow do we proceed for remote workstation migration, because the remote workstations will depends on the vmover.ini where the Target Domain users are not available in the file.\n\nPlease help me to procedure for remote workstations. Thanks in advance"
