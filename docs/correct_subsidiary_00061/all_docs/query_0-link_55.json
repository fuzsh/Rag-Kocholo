        "text": "In version 9.1 the KACE Agent Toolkit (KAT) is now available directly within the webui of the KACE Systems Management Appliance (SMA). To ensure that the most recent version is acquired, obtain the KAT directly from the webui when needed for agent troubleshooting.\n\nThe KACE Agent Toolkit (KAT) is used by KACE Support technicians and DIY customers to diagnose and troubleshoot agents/endpoints.\n\nThe tool is written in Python and built using PyInstaller. Standalone, compiled binaries are available for all supported platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac.\n\nNOTE: The KAT is not avaiable in the webui for versions prior to 9.1. For 9.0 and below, please refer to the previous article.\n\nTo obtain the latest version of the KACE Agent Toolkit, go to Settings | Support | Troubleshooting Tools | KACE Agent Toolkit (KAT) | Download\n\nNOTE: KAT is written in Python and compiled using PyInstaller. As such, it is prone to false positive detection by many antivirus products. KACE submits whitelist requests to antivirus vendors as we are made aware of these false positives. If a false positive is encountered, please contact KACE Support.\n\nThe zip file contains a README.txt file with usage instructions."
