        "text": "Bob Kelly is the founder, manager and product owner of Dell’s ITNinja.com online community. He originally established the community in September of 1999 as AppDeploy.com. It grew to become a top destination for IT Professionals. It was later acquired by KACE in 2007, which was acquired by Dell in 2010 where Bob continues to manage the site, create content, and direct the ongoing development of the custom application on which the community sits. Bob is the author of several books and papers on the topic of Windows administration, deployment and automation. He is a three-time recipient of Microsoft’s Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award and is regularly invited to speak at technical events around the world. Bob began his career as a member of the U.S. Navy where he was ultimately chosen to support the Clinton administration from 1993 to 1997 working at the White House as administrator of its electronic communications systems. Before establishing AppDeploy and authoring technical books, he built his skills as as principal consultant in support of many government networks including the DIA, JWAC, OPM, and U.S. Navy.
