Benchmark Factory Freeware comes with 20 virtual users. Virtual users simulate the load against the system-under-test. Each virtual user is a separate thread, acting independently of the other virtual users, with its own connection to the system-under-test. Each virtual user tracks its own statistics that includes transaction times and the number of times a transaction executes.\n\nBenchmark Factory can scale up to an unlimited number of concurrent load users. Additional virtual users allow you to:\n\nAccurately determine system throughput and capacity for database systems\n\nSimulate thousands of concurrent users with a minimal amount of hardware\n\nFind applications that do not scale well with an increase in the number of users\n\nFind breaking points, weak links, or bottlenecks of a system\n\nQuantify application or server performance with realistic workloads\n\nTo request additional concurrent load users, please contact your Quest Software representative, or visit the Benchmark Factory Web site.\n\nSystem/Upgrade Requirements/Supported Databases\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nBefore installing Benchmark Factory, ensure your system meets the following minimum hardware and software requirements.\n\nRequirement Details\n\nUpgrade Requirements"
