        "text": "Artificial Intelligence has doubtlessly changed the world in recent years. With numerous benefits, it has garnered a path into peoples' daily lives. However, with all this exposure it begs the question - how secure is it? OpenAI was (silently) breached a year ago raising security concerns all around. What are your thoughts on this incredible resource and the potential risks that surround it? https://okt.to/7S6WYK #ArtificialIntellegence #security\n\nIf we were to tell you \"old tech\" might have another moment in history, how would you feel? Would you be thrilled at the prospect of going back to the good old brick Nokia phone? What about the rotary phone? Floppy disks?! Alas, those items may not have a mainstream revival any time soon. However, their building blocks are there! Check out this interesting article by WIRED on how analog chips are being tested for modern tech for their energy efficiency. ðŸ‘‰https://okt.to/BnQsxl #innovation #technology #ITRevolution\n\nAre you a current partner or MSP? Would you like to be? Tune in to our webinar on July 10th to get familiar with or improve your understanding of the KACE solutions portfolio and its many applications. Register below to get in the know! ðŸ‘‡ https://okt.to/wrP4Uc #endpointmanagement #endpointsecurity #ITmanagement\n\nAre you labeling your IT resources in the SMA? Join our support team and service engineers as they tell you why labels are important, and share industry best practices so that you can minimize errors, avoid compromising your security, and take control of your IT resources. ðŸ‘‰https://okt.to/RPmh6u #endpointmanagement #endpointsecurity #ITmanagement\n\nStitch Incoming: Did you know that you can \"Merge\" tickets in the KACE SMA Service Desk? If you do not have ticket archival enabled in the Service Desk, you probably weren't aware that you can actually bulk merge tickets. Ticket merging can be helpful if an end-user submits multiple tickets regarding the same issue or if multiple end-users submit tickets regarding the same issue. In the latter scenario, all users get CC'd to the remaining active ticket so that they are notified regarding updates made to the ticket or when the ticket has been resolved/closed. Not only does this simplify the management of the issue for the technician but it can also save time which in turn increases end-user satisfaction. Please note: The Tickets must belong to the same queue Service, parent or child tickets cannot be merged #endpointmanagement #endpointsecurity #ITmanagement #TipsForSuccess\n\nDo you know about KACE Academy? KACE Academy is a classroom course, which approaches best practices and ideas for using KACE products to their full utilization.
