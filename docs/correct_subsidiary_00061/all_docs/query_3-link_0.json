        "text": "Listen to founder, Bob Kelly, talk about ITNinja during our launch event.\n\nITNinja is a rapidly growing community where IT professionals ask questions, research software and other technical topics, and share information and ideas. Founded by Bob Kelly in September of 1999, ITNinja was previously known as AppDeploy.com. As a leading destination for end point administrators to discuss topics related to setup and deployment, ITNinja expands the scope of AppDeploy adding numerous topics while leveraging its rich application and deployment data.\n\nDesigned to be the largest IT professional collaborative community, ITNinja offers:\n\nAn ever-growing database of over 200,000 software applications serving as topics of discussion for questions, deployment tips, shared links, and blog posts.\n\nAn activity feed to highlight your contributions as well as all software, topics, other users, and blogs that you follow to keep you up-to-date on the content you care about most.\n\nAn engaging user reputation management system that rewards you with points for your contributions and for any site interaction, such as rating content posted by others.\n\nThis increasing set of powerful features integrates the benefits of social networking with your IT professional life giving you access to product summaries, reviews, downloads, answers to questions, feature articles, and more. ITNinjaâ€™s tag-based system merges all content sources on the site to provide robust functionality and behavior that makes it easy to navigate and filter the information you need.\n\nITNinja is sponsored by Quest.
