        "text": "I am underwhelmed with my KACE 1000 box that has been in our environment for 3.5+ years. It primarily serves as a helpdesk ticketing system because that is the only thing that I have been able to setup efficiently. Perhaps if I were a multi-person IT shop, I may have had more luck.\n\nThe appliance interface is cumbersome. The menus are not outlined in a straightforward logical way; thus making changes are tedious. Often the client agent stops reporting back to the device (I’m still not sure of how to correct this behavior). I was able to push the application push out with Off 2007 although I had 5 other apps I tried to get working and quit in frustration. Further, I was told in a Dell sponsored luncheon that the device would be able to manage laptops off network over the Internet without the use of a VPN. This is not the kace (pardon the pun). I believe I was unintentionally mislead, but the sales / engineer staff should have facts on the product that are verified before being released for public consumption. It does not have an SNMP feature so it will not track assets other than computers. I knew this in advance and was okay with it. But one should be aware of this fact. Technical support prefers to send me articles on a fix rather than phone me as I request in the ticket I submit.\n\nWhat is does do well is get a good inventory of my Dell computers and servers. It will track that information for me. In one of the new releases, the reporting was upgraded and is much more user friendly. It also should be noted that I am not on the latest version release (currently 6.0.xx). Overall, I am dissatisfied with the device.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n1 out of 5 stars\n\nI’ve been administering our KACE K1000 appliance for almost 2 years now. I’ve had mixed feelings about it since we started. It does a lot of things that are very helpful for the sysadmin such as a helpdesk, inventory, and asset management. Where it falls short in my opinion is managed installations, scripting, and 3rd party patching. The agent has also been known to throw us problems from time to time as well. Managed installations require research to deploy (rather than having a pool to select from and click “go”). Scripting requires some additional skill to pull off using Kscripts. 3rd party patching is the killer for us. KACE, like many SM tools, uses Lumension as the patch feed provider. On more than one occasion I’ve waited more than 2 weeks for critical security updates. KACE has not and will not consider giving the administrator the option to bypass Lumension for a “real-time” patch feed. Where I work, that kind of wait isn’t an option.\n\nDespite the shortcomings, KACE does have a lot going for it. The trainers and support are as helpful as Dell allows them to be. When it’s working, it saves a lot of man hours trying to perform installations and configurations on segments of our environment. It offers a great deal of flexibility using smart labels (static and dynamic). The helpdesk and asset management modules are very easy to customize to your needs. Pete is right in saying that the K1000 is an IT professional’s swiss army knife, as it does a wide range of things. I’m going to say that it is a master in none of these areas. For the price point, the K1000 outperforms many products in its class.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nI have been a KACE user for a while, since just when Dell acquired them.\n\nI do have a fairly large environment, with about 7000 nodes. In its earlier version, the KBOX was struggling to keep up with that. I stuck with KACE because I saw the potential that this appliance has. Prior to KACE I used one of the larger, and well known desktop management suites, and I ended up leaving it for KACE because I had better control over what was going on.\n\nWith the previous product, I used to spend 70% of my time troubleshooting the product itself, so much so, that in the 3 years I had it, I never even got around to deploying patching. With KACE, it’s easy to follow the trail and troubleshoot issues when needed.\n\nIt took me a couple hours to get a working appliance, but, much longer to setup all the labels to make your appliance functional. (this is what any KACE user should do: if you don’t do due diligence in setting it up correctly, you’re going to have a hard time maximizing productivity with it).\n\nMy patching is consistently anywhere between 95 and 97% complete and compliant. can’t ask for better number in such a large environment.\n\nSoftware distribution, scripting, asset management, inventory and reporting have really saved us, especially in the crunch for being compliant for the CCSS testing.\n\nReporting is great, and is getting better and better, with the 5.5 version especially. It has quite a few canned reports, and the ability to create your own reports via a GUI or MySQL queries makes it completely extensible. This makes it usable for both the novice and the advanced user.\n\nService desk is getting better with newer versions. I have a bit of a problem with custom rules being quite complex to create, but out of the box, it it more than adequate for most organizations.\n\nFrom a support perspective, I have had a very good experience for the most part. If I have to criticize one thing perhaps, it would be that. The good news, is that they have been working on this point actively, and things have been improving quite drastically.\n\nThey have also opened multiple channels to listen to users, whether it’s ITNinja, GetSatisfaction, or Kace Konnect.\n\nOver all, I cannot recommend the KACE product enough, I honestly cannot imagine doing my job right now without the KACE appliance being the center of it.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nOur company went to Dell Kace about 6 months after I started (3 years ago). In fact, it was tossed in my lap as kind of a welcoming project. At that point, I was completely unaware of Kace Forums, IT Ninja, or anything outside of our JumpStart training (Which is good to give you an overall view of what Kace does, but mostly not worth the time, if you can read) to get help. It was a bit like trying to navigate the Amazon river with no goggles and one leg.\n\nHowever, things have greatly improved since then.\n\nThere is plenty of documentation to read prior to deciding if it is the answer you are looking for. There is MORE than enough documentation about how to do the various things that Kace can do. There are about 15 different ways to do each and everything of which Kace K1 and K2 are capable.\n\nIt could stand to be a bit more user friendly at times, but even that is improving leaps and bounds with every update. The engineers are not these distant, Mythological beings that you sometimes have to make sacrifices to in order to get something fixed. That is a big plus. There are times when you can actually pick their brains if you have the need. The Backyard boot camps are available and don’t forget Dell World. They will take all the time in the world to sit and chat or work on an issue you are having. I had a ticket open with support when I went to Dell World in 2015. I spoke with an Engineer during a break about the support ticket. It was addressed within hours.\n\nAll in all, the K1 and K2 are good products with great potential and if you get involved enough, you actually begin to feel like Dell Kace is a collaborated effort between Dell and Us, the Kace users.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nThe K1000 virtual appliance is a IT professionals Swiss Army Knife. I can patch every system in my environment, open helpdesk tickets to multiple help desks, manage licensed software, prevent unlicensed or unwanted software from being used. I can deploy software in minutes to over 25 locations with a few clicks of the mouse. The reporting feature is 100% customizable. It can only do what you want it to do. They give you some canned reports but you can easily customize those to your liking.\n\nOther reviewers speak poorly of MySQL backend database. So I guess they would rather pay the ransom than Oracle or Microsoft wants to use their databases. Those reviewers must be in higher education where “money is no object”. But for us with budgets in the real world, KACE is the saving grace. As far as account renewals, I keep reminders in my calendar when software support is expiring. This may help others in the future as well so that you are not “out of support”.\n\nI’ve had great experiences with my sales team, technical support (1st level all the way up to engineers and product managers). I’ve even on a few occasions spoken with the President of the division. I cannot speak more highly of the product and the sales/support people within the division.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nKACE is, simply put, amazing for managing Windows clients. I’ve been a KACE user for over five years, and in that time, it’s more than paid for itself several times over. We purchased both the K1000 and K2000 appliances, and they’re both fantastic at their respective jobs. In the time that I’ve managed our systems, I’ve learned that KACE really excels at system deployment, inventory, scripting, software installs, and patch management. There are additional components that I feel are value-added, and have used at one time or another, but these core functions are where it shines. I’ve recommended KACE before and I will continue to do so.\n\nThat said, I wish it included better dashboards and a tighter integration with cloud services. As a school district, we’ve invested heavily in Chromebooks, and KACE’s ability to inventory and manage those devices is limited at best.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nMy experience with KACE is with the K1000 HelpDesk/Inventory service.\n\nKACE is a very raw product. Functionally, it handles the Help Desk ticket system adequately. It has all the features one would expect from a Help Desk product. Ticket type, priority, multiple queues, etc. However, the interface falls flat in terms of ergonomics. The inventory system has lots of useful information, but it is presented in such a messy interface that it is almost unusable.\n\nKACE was implemented for our Help Desk, so I have been forced to get used to its idiosyncrasies in the ticket system. I completely abandoned KACE’s inventory service due to its stone age interface. Fortunately, we already had Spiceworks in place, so I just kept using it for my inventory.\n\nI have also been unimpressed with their support. During the evaluation period Dell’s support was quick to respond to our questions and problems. But, as soon as we bought the product, support became a pain to contact.\n\nOverall, KACE feels like a beta product that was rushed to delivery before it could be polished up. It has the necessary core functionality, but the interface is an impediment to usefulness.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nI have been an active user of KACE, before Dell even owned it. I made a switchover at the time from Altiris. One of the features that caught me the most at the time was it essentially came with everything installed and we had to configure for our network. This was a much easier and smoother process than having to build a server from scratch. I did like the Jump Start training that is given with the purchase, the only caveat I would say there is have one set of hours as you get started and then again once you have been using it in your environment for six months to a year so you know what questions to ask, how things work in your own environment. I have both the K1000 and K2000 physical boxes. We are again updating our hardware this Spring. I will be working with our sales rep to get a quote on physical servers for both again. I am currently managing around 1,500 pc computers, use it to inventory Chromebooks, deploy software and updates, create and deploy images. Since Dell has taken over these tools continue to be updated and new features added. They also offer Boot Camp training at locations around the US, and also Dell world/Dell KACE where you can attend a 4 day bootcamp in conjunction with the conference. I have traveled to Austin, TX once so far. I am looking to either try to get to a bootcamp or attend Dell World this year, to update my skill set with these tools. I would recommend this in so many ways, it was easy to get up and running and literally in a day or two, you can start using many parts of it. I still have much to learn and would like to take advantage of the webinars and online tutorials, etc. for KACE. I do think more hands on training in a classroom setting would be more beneficial, plus it would be nice to offer certifications as many businesses want you to be certified in lots of things, a sign that you are continuing to educate yourself in the new and up and coming.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars"
