        "text": "Quest On Demand uses the Role-based Access Control (RBAC) security policy that restricts information system access to authorized users. Subscribers can create specific roles based on job functions, with the permissions to perform needed operations on the assets of the organization. When users are assigned to On Demand roles, they inherit the authorizations or permissions defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies permission administration for subscribers because permissions are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a significant number of individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead acquired through role assignments.\n\nThe following are some key Quest On Demand and tenant roles that you will need to work with On Demand Migration.\n\nOn Demand Administrator\n\nThis role is assigned to users who have full access to the Quest On Demand application. They can manage organizations and tenants, initiate the migration of tenant assets, manage licenses, audit records and perform many other functions through the Quest On Demand application. Some of the key permissions associated with this role are as follows:\n\nPermission Description Service Scope Can Export Data Permission to export data as well as download the premigration report, comparison report and error report. On Demand Migration Create, Rename and Delete projects Required permission to create, rename and delete migration projects from the Projects Dashboard On Demand Migration View projects and manage selected services This permission must be selected to activate the individual permissions to view and manage services. Services selected for this permission will be inherited by all child permissions. On Demand Migration View projects Required permission to be able to view objects tasks and events for the selected services. Only the tiles for the selected services will be shown in the project dashboards.\n\nAlways inherited from parent permission\n\nOn Demand Migration Edit project properties Permission to edit properties associated with project services. For example, this permission enables access to Accounts Configure Connections and SharePoint Configure Project.

On Demand Administrator, Migration Administrator, Audit Administrator, License Management Administrator and Recovery Administrator are some examples.\n\nOn Demand custom roles\n\nYou can create more roles with specific permissions to allow other users to work with On Demand Migration. See the On Demand Global Settings Current User Guide for more information about setting up roles.\n\nTenant Administrator\n\nIn this document the term Tenant Administrator refers to the Azure active directory user account for the source or target tenant that is assigned the Global administrator security role and has full access to the tenant. Each tenant that you add to a project requires the credentials of the Tenant Administrator. The Tenant Administrator may require additional roles to grant the necessary consents to various On Demand service principals that are created in the tenant to access various assets in the tenant during the migration lifecycle. See Consents and Permissions for more details. For more information about user and service principals see the Microsoft article Application and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory.\n\nTenant Administrator accounts must have a mailbox with a valid Microsoft Exchange Online license.\n\nTo use On Demand Migration, the Tenant Administrator for each tenant in a project must grant Azure consents and permissions to the On Demand Migration service principals.\n\nMigration Manager\n\nYou can use a temporary tenant user account to operate on tenant assets. In this document the term Migration Manager refers to the source or target Azure active directory user account that has temporary access to the tenant through the Global administrator security role. Depending on the tenant asset that is being migrated, this temporary user account must grant specific consents. For example, when teams are migrated, the account that is assigned the Migration Manager role is added to the team. This temporary role is required for migrating teams by the by the On Demand Migration service.\n\nIf you choose to work with this temporary account, you must login to the tenant as the Migration Manager and grant the consents and permissions to the On Demand service principal.\n\nWhen you are done with the migration, it is recommended that you delete the temporary account for security reasons. See Finalizing the Migration for more details.\n\nThe ability for On Demand service principals to access and operate with tenant assets requires explicit permissions. The Tenant Administrator grants these permissions through consents. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is supported for tenant administrators when granting consents.\n\nWhen a tenant is added the initial Core - Basic permission set is granted consent to the On Demand service principal. Additional consents are required to work with different features of On Demand Migration\n\nIn this topic:\n\nGranting Consents\n\nConsents for initial tenant setup\n\nConsents for Account Migration\n\nConsents for Mailbox Migration\n\nConsents for OneDrive Migration\n\nConsents for Teams and M365 groups Migration\n\nConsents for SharePoint Migration\n\nGranting Consents\n\nClick Tenants from the navigation pane.\n\nSelect a tenant and click Edit Consents from the tenant tile.\n\nClick Grant Consent or Regrant Consent for the permissions type.

You must verify both source and target tenants.\n\nLog in to the Azure admin portal.\n\nOpen the Microsoft Entra ID service page.\n\nClick Enterprise applications from the navigation panel. Then click All applications.\n\nFilter the list if necessary and verify the list of Quest On Demand service principals. Your list may differ from the image below.\n\nThis section lists the minimum consents and permissions required by the various On Demand Migration service principals for managing tenants, Microsoft 365 objects and other migration services.
