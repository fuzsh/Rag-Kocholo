        "text": "There’s been a lot of buzz over the past year about Dell’s transformation into an end-to-end solutions company. And there have been several milestones that have reinforced this including the recent acquisitions of AppAssure and SonicWALL as well as the formation of Dell’s software group.\n\nToday, marks yet another proof point with the announcement that Dell KACE has completely revamped and expanded our popular online IT community site, AppDeploy.com, under the name, ITNinja. ITNinja is the next generation in product-agnostic online communities geared towards IT professionals and builds off the popular AppDeploy.com site. The community builds on Dell’s established social media success to deliver a valuable hub in which IT professionals can not only share tips and information but also form new connections with their industry colleagues.\n\nThe unveiling of ITNinja is timely as online communities particularly within IT enterprise, have never been stronger. We recently sponsored an online survey of IT professionals which revealed that more and more IT professionals are turning to online communities to help do their jobs more efficiently.\n\nConsider these stats:\n\n80 percent of IT professionals engage in online communities\n\n70 percent of them visiting several times a week\n\n95 percent of front-line professionals say they save time and do their job more efficiently by using these same online IT communities\n\nWe are excited to have the opportunity to build a community that enables members to rapidly share information surrounding common systems management challenges they were facing. By hosting a community in which IT professionals can crowd source issues, we can help IT become more efficient, extend the application of Dell KACE appliances and become a source for ideas that lead to appliance improvements."
