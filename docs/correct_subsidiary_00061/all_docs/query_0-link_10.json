        "text": "DELIVERY APPROACH: 5 day remotely delivered instructor-led live class\n\nThe AdminStudio application packaging training course will teach you to use AdminStudio to repackage traditional setups into Windows Installer packages and customize those packages to meet specific needs. Learn application packaging best practices and much more.\n\nIn this application packaging training course, you will also gain experience in creating transforms for existing third-party MSI packages and improving package quality through identifying and resolving conflicts between packages, validation and automated tests before deploying your applications.\n\nCOURSE OBJECTIVES\n\nIn this class you will learn:\n\nHow to prepare your development systems, test systems and documentation for the application-migration process\n\nHow to use AdminStudio’s Repackager to convert traditional setups to Windows Installer setups and virtual applications\n\nHow to enhance and customize repackaged setups using the InstallShield Editor and to correct validation errors\n\nHow to use AdminStudio’s Test Center to identify and resolve potential issues using automated test cases and Best Practices.\n\nHow to use AdminStudio’s Tuner to customize the installation of existing Windows Installer setups——to meet your company-specific requirements\n\nHow to convert MSI packages to virtual packages\n\nCOURSE PREREQUISITES\n\nPrevious AdminStudio experience is not required; however, you should be comfortable with the following:\n\nUsing Windows Explorer and the command prompt to create and manage files and run executables\n\nBasic Windows terminology (e.g. DLL, Control Panel, etc.)\n\nCOURSE CURRICULUM\n\nThe following course sections and topics will be covered in the class. If you have a specific area that you think might need extra attention, mention it to your instructor on the first day of application packaging training.\n\nDELIVERY APPROACH: 5 day remotely delivered instructor-led live class\n\nThe InstallShield, MSI Projects course provides you with a solid understanding of installation terminology, the tasks an installation program needs to perform, and the InstallShield development environment.\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to customize your installation with custom actions in order to make changes to your end users’ systems. You will also see how to correctly identify, install, and configure special types of files (e.g., COM servers, Windows services, and .NET assemblies). Finally, you will understand how to perform simple to sophisticated changes to your installation’s user interface.\n\nThis course teaches you how to create Basic MSI projects, which use the Windows Installer service (MSI) for the installation’s behavior and appearance. This course does not cover InstallScript MSI projects.\n\nCOURSE OBJECTIVES\n\nIn this class you will learn how to:\n\nCreate and organize an installation project\n\nInstall files and create shortcuts\n\nInstall and configure special types of files and data, such as registry and INI data, COM servers, Windows services, and .NET assemblies\n\nWork with MSI sequences and custom actions\n\nCustomize your installer’s user interface\n\nPackage your installer for Windows Vista, Windows 7, and later\n\nUse the Automation interface to modify your project outside the graphical environment\n\nCOURSE PREREQUISITES\n\nPrevious InstallShield experience is not required; however, you should be comfortable with the following:\n\nUsing Windows Explorer and the command prompt to create and manage files, and run executables\n\nBasic Windows terminology (e.g. DLL, Control Panel, etc.)\n\nLater sections of the course assume familiarity with programming or scripting languages such as VBScript, C or C++, and C#.\n\nDELIVERY APPROACH: 5 day remotely delivered instructor-led live class\n\nThe AdminStudio application packaging training course will teach you to use AdminStudio to repackage traditional setups into Windows Installer packages and customize those packages to meet specific needs.
