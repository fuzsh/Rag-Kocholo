She has been known to mix work with leisure on occasion by sporting her ‘K’ badge headband to show off her KACE Ninja passion – and to wick off the ‘it’s-not-always-dry!!’ heat-derived sweat in her current hometown of Tucson, Arizona.\n\nRon Colson\n\nRon is a Senior Professional Services Consultant at Quest.

He currently resides in Gainesville, FL (Go Gators) to be close to his two children."
