        "text": "Software Distribution\n\nSoftware Distribution*\n\nMSI packages contain all necessary files an application needs in order for it to be installed using Microsoft's Windows Installer. Windows Installer can install and/or uninstall MSI packages for any application regardless of the install package used by the manufacturer. Administrators can customize an MSI package by creating a transform (.MST) file. The transform can provide answers to Windows Installer when the MSI file calls for user input, such as choosing which options to install or the correct installation path. It can also remove unwanted features from the basic installation. MSP files are Microsoft Windows patch files that are updates to applications that have been previously installed with Windows Installer.\n\nThe Desktop Authority Software Distribution object is used to manage a repository of Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI, MST, MSP) packages.\n\nThe Software Distribution object provides the ability to:\n\nimport packages into its repository.\n\nexport packages from its repository.\n\ndelete packages from the repository.\n\npublish packages for deployment using the Desktop Authority MSI Packages object.\n\nunpublish packages, i.e., remove them from use by the MSI Packages object.\n\ndetermine the differences between published and unpublished packages.\n\nFigure 59: Software Distribution process overview\n\nDesktop Authority accesses Windows Installer packages, providing the ability to Import, Export, Modify, Delete and Publish these packages.\n\nMulti-select packages\n\nOne or more packages may be selected in the Software Distribution list by using the Shift or Ctrl key in combination with a mouse click. To select multiple packages, hold down the CTRL key while clicking the individual packages to select. Consecutive packages in the grid can be selected by clicking the first package to select and then, while holding down the SHIFT key, clicking the last package to select. To select the entire list of packages select the checkbox to the left of the column headers. This box will be empty if no packages are selected and will be filled with a square if some packages are selected. A package's selected status may be changed by clicking on it.\n\nImport\n\nClick Import to copy a Windows Installer package into the Desktop Authority repository. The Installer file must be an existing MSI, MST or MSP package.\n\nExport\n\nClick Export to copy a Windows Installer package from the Desktop Authority repository to another defined location.\n\nPublish\n\nClick Publish to make the selected packages available for install by Desktop Authorityâ€™s MSI Packages object. The MSI package file is not initially copied to the server that the update service is installed to. However, when the client machine requests the package, the MSI package is copied to the server that the Update service is installed to. If a package is never requested by a client, it will not exist on the server.\n\nFor configuration information on the Update Service, see What is the Update Service?\n\nUnpublish\n\nClick Unpublish to remove Windows Installer packages from all distribution servers.\n\nDelete\n\nClick Delete to remove a Windows Installer package from the Desktop Authority repository.\n\nRefresh\n\nClick Refresh to freshen the Software Packages list.\n\nSoftware packages list\n\nThe Software Packages list defines all Windows Installer packages that are available for deployment. This includes MSI, MST and MSP files. Packages must be imported into the Desktop Authority repository to show in this list. The following information is available about each package in the list: Product Name, File Name, Published Status, Published Date, Manufacturer, Type, Version, Product Code, and File Size.\n\nShow differences\n\nClick Show Differences between the published and unpublished versions of the selected package, if any differences exist.\n\nThis function is only available if the MSI is published and there are determined to be differences between the published and unpublished version of the package. If it is determined that there are no differences between the published and unpublished version of the package, this button will be disabled."
