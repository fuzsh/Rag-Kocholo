        "text": "Constitutions are foundational documents. They are meant to organize institutions of governance, entrench fundamental rights, and serve as important expressions of national identity. Agreement on these foundational principles is considered crucial among experts in constitutional design. But even in the best of circumstances, when compromise is forthcoming at the time of drafting, any constitutional text will serve as both an object and an instrument in future political struggles. Conflict is inevitable because the aims and objectives of political actors evolve over time, and because constitutional provisions are often left vague or discordant to overcome divergent interests in the constitution-writing process (Lerner Reference Lerner2011). This chapter provides the historical context for understanding the origins of the major provisions in the Federal Constitution concerning religion and liberal rights. I examine the political context of British Malaya with a focus on the key players and the competing interests that became entrenched in the new constitutional order. This “constitutional ethnography” is essential for understanding (a) the legal construction of race and religion in British Malaya, (b) the dual constitutional provisions for liberal rights and Anglo-Muslim law and, (c) the formation of separate jurisdictions for Muslims and non-Muslims in areas of personal status and family law. In subsequent chapters, I examine how each of these legal features fuels the judicialization of religion.\n\nSubstantive Provisions of Anglo-Muslim Law\n\nLeaving aside the contested symbolism of Article 3, more clearly defined arrangements for the administration of Anglo-Muslim law are specified elsewhere in the Constitution. The Ninth Schedule establishes the basic institutional foundation, by delineating the powers of the states vis-à-vis the federal government. The states were granted jurisdiction over:\n\nMuslim law and personal and family law of persons professing the Muslim religion, including the Muslim law relating to succession, testate and intestate, betrothal, marriage, divorce, dower, maintenance, legitimacy, guardianship … mosques or any Muslim public place of worship, creation and punishment of offences by persons professing the Muslim religion against precepts of that religion, except in regard to matters included in the Federal List; the constitution, organization and procedure of Muslim courts, which shall have jurisdiction only over person professing the Muslim religion and in respect only of any of the matters included in this paragraph, but shall not have jurisdiction in respect of offences except in so far as conferred by federal law; the control of propagating doctrines and beliefs among persons professing the Muslim religion; the determination of matters of Muslim law and doctrine and Malay custom …\n\nThe administration of religion is a state-level enterprise because of the separate treaties that the British had forged with local rulers. The Sultans had managed to preserve their role as the heads of religion within the federal structure of the Federation of Malaya Agreement of 1948, and later they managed to entrench those powers in the Independence Constitution. A comparison of these consecutive legal frameworks reveals a high degree of path dependence. The bifurcated legal system that first emerged in the state of Perak in 1874, as a product of the Treaty of Pangkor (later replicated in other Malay protectorates), came to be entrenched in the Federation of Malaya Agreement. Later still, similar wording was carried over into the Independence Constitution (now the Federal Constitution). In this bifurcated legal system, the federal courts came to administer all matters of civil, criminal, and administrative law, whereas state jurisdiction was limited to issues of personal status law within the Muslim community, including such matters as marriage, divorce, child custody, religious status."
