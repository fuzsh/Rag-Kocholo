        "text": "Focus this week has been on the new #Agong Sultan Ibrahim's strongly-worded maiden address to officiate #Malaysia #parliament first sitting in 2024, which he warned MPs against disrupting political stability. Indeed this is a great news for PM Anwar Ibrahim (and investors), who have been fending off veiled attempts by opposition PN coalition (of which key agitators include Bersatu ex-PM Muhyiddin Yasin and PAS Hadi Awang) to topple Anwar's unity government. Now Anwar will likely have better control of the parliament till 2026/2027 to focus on #policymaking , especially with the potential expansion his parliamentary majority (e.g. more defecting opposition from PN MPs). Politics aside, the King's maiden speech also marks a positive signal for Malaysia's #economy and #business environment. The King rightly highlighted several key concerns commercial and economic concerns that he wants Anwar's government to tackle (presumably in return for his critical royal support to provide Anwar with #political #stability and rein for #publicpolicy making), which he himself as a veteran businessman would likely benefit from. They include: üí∞ Improving Malaysia's fiscal position. The King pledge to personally \"vet\" government spending. At 82% national debt of GDP (i.e. RM1.5 trillion/USD 314 billion) caused by longtime unsustainable public subsidies, the country has been running on fiscal deficit and unable to spend on more productive development projects to stimulate growth. PN will now have limited room to criticize Anwar's targeted subsidies reform and Public Finance and Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2023. ‚õî Increasing transparency in public spending. Investors will rejoice at lesser risk of funny business when dealing with GLCs/GLICs. The King hinted and warned off corruption by \"curbing leakages and misappropriation of public funds\". üíπ Improving the country's investment competitiveness. To this end, the King supported Anwar's Madani plan to restructure economic and investment activity, and to cut \"red tape\" that he admittedly dislike. üë©üë©üëßüëß Social cohesion efforts that would contribute positively to local politics and security. The King wants the government to formulate a policy to foster greater national unity and harmony. Few interesting developments left out the King's speech but will c'nue to be under his radar: RCI to review the territorial dispute with SG (refer to my last RCI entry for its impact); SG-KL High Speed Rail; and the (low-profile beyond Malaysia but is religiously/politically explosive, albeit partly addressed in his social cohesion point to avoid 3Rs politicization) Federal Court's Feb ruling to annul 16 Kelantan Shariah laws. Still, Anwar is still not out of the woods yet. Moving forward, his vulnerability will stem from slow PADU central database inception, public acceptance of rising taxes/prices and - particularly - depreciating historic-low Ringgit further affecting cost of living. #governmentaffairs #businessanalysis\n\nIn order to win elections, political parties often need to raise large sums of money. This money can be used to fund campaigns, pay for advertising, and bribe voters. When political parties are not subject to effective regulation, this can lead to corruption, as parties may be more likely to engage in illegal or unethical fundraising activities. The Anwar administration has not yet implemented the long-overdue Political Financing Act, which would regulate how political parties conduct fundraising. This is a missed opportunity to prevent future financial scandals. Without effective institutional oversight, it is likely that political parties in Malaysia will continue to engage in corrupt fundraising activities. In addition to implementing the Political Financing Act, there are a number of other steps that the Anwar administration can take to reduce corruption in Malaysian politics. These include: Strengthening the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and giving it more resources to investigate and prosecute corruption cases. Increasing transparency and accountability in government spending. Enacting reforms to the Malaysian judiciary to make it more independent and impartial. Educating the public about the dangers of corruption and encouraging them to report corruption cases to the authorities. Reducing corruption in Malaysian politics is a complex challenge, but it is essential for ensuring good governance and economic development. The Anwar administration should make it a priority to implement the Political Financing Act and other reforms to reduce corruption in Malaysia. It is also important to note that the problem of astronomical election expenses is not unique to Malaysia. It is a problem that exists in many countries around the world. This is why it is important for countries to work together to develop international standards and regulations for political financing.\n\nVisited Tan Sri Dr Haji Wan Junaidi Bin Tuanku Jaafar, President of the Dewan Negara, in my capacity as the Lead for the Parliament and State Legislative Assembly Reform Cluster of the CSOP4R. We proposed a number of key reforms, including: 1. Increasing the ratio of state-appointed Senators. Currently it is 2, we propose it is increased to 3 to improve check and balance. 2. Lowering the minimum age to become a Senator to 18, in line with the Dewan Rakyat. Current minimum age is 30. 3. 1/3 of Senatorships to be reserved for Sabahans and Sarawakians. To protect East Malaysian rights, without changing the composition of the Dewan Rakyat. We also presented our papers on bringing back the Parliament Services Act dan PSSC reforms. It was a positive conversation and we hope to strengthen the reform agenda. UNDI 18\n\nFollowing from my last post, the decision in The \"Sea Justice\" appeal has just been published and I am glad that the Appeal Judge upheld the 1st instance decision. The key takeaways I posted earlier thus remain. In addition, the Judge also held that the principle laid down in the Eurohope - that the Singapore courts will not order security obtained under an arrest to be retained to satisfy a judgment given in foreign court proceedings - applied to the case so that the Plaintiff was not permitted to retain the Singapore security for the purpose of satisfying any judgment it might obtain in the Chinese proceedings. The full judgment is attached here.\n\nDo I need witnesses to sign my Will? Yes. In order for a Will to be legally binding in Malaysia, there is a requirement for at least two witnesses (who are not beneficiaries and spouse of your beneficiaries) to witness your signing of the Will and for them to sign the Will too. It must be ensured that at the time of signing of the Will that said witnesses must be legal adults over the age of 18 years old (21 years old in Sabah) and are of sound mind. The reason that the witnesses are required to sign your Will is a precautionary measure. It is to prevent any doubt that could arise from the Will actually belonging to you as the witnesses can be there to attest to it. A Will not witnessed is a Will that is not recognized by law despite having your signature on it. Koha places an importance for you to select your witnesses to your Will. Therefore, under the ‚ÄúWitnesses‚Äù section, you can designate up to 2 individuals to validate and confirm your Will validity. https://buff.ly/3OxOued"
