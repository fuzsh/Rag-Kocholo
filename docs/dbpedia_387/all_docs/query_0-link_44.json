        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR – Parliament has received the proclamation of dissolution effective today, and, as such, all proceedings scheduled to take place are now cancelled, Tan Sri Azhar Azizan Harun said.\n\nThe former Dewan Rakyat speaker, in a brief statement, said the proclamation of dissolution of the 14th Parliament had been signed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah.\n\n“Therefore, Dewan Rakyat sittings, Special Chambers sittings, as well as meetings of select committees and special select committees scheduled prior to this are now cancelled in accordance with parliament's dissolution.\n\n“It is now for the Election Commission to implement the process of holding the general election,” Azhar said.\n\nThis follows the dissolution as announced by caretaker Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob earlier this afternoon.\n\nEarlier today, Azhar was quoted by Berita Harian that the Dewan Rakyat would sit tomorrow as usual.\n\nThe House had begun its session on October 3 and had sat through the tabling of Budget 2023 on Friday. – The Vibes, October 10, 2022."
