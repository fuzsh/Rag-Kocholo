        "text": "Explain the 3 components of Malaysian parliament: a. Yang Di-Pertuan Agong (YDPA) The role of the YDPA as legislature is very limited. Article 55 of the FC stipulates that only the YDPA can summon for Parliament to be in session. His Highness also has the special power to end or dissolve the Parliament at his discretion. Additionally, according to Art 60 of the FC, the YDPA may address either House of Parliament or both Houses jointly. Moreover, as stipulated under Art 66 of the FC, the YDPA also plays a role by granting assent to the Bill. b. Senate (Dewan Negara) As provided by Art 45 of the FC, the Senate consists of 70 members and is made up for two categories which is elected and appointed. In the Senate, 26 members elected by the State Legislative Assembly to represent 13 states where each state represented by two members. Another 44 members are appointed by the YDPA on the advice of the PM including 2 from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, and each from the Federal Territory of Labuan and Putrajaya. The people in the Senate are known as Senators. According to Art 45(2), senators are drawn from the ranks of persons who have rendered distinguished public services or have achieved distinction in the professions, commerce, industry, agriculture, cultural activities or social service or are representatives of a racial minority or are capable of representing the interests of aborigines. Additionally, as provided under Art 45(3) of the FC, the term of office of a member of the Senate shall be three years and shall not be affected by the dissolution of Parliament. However, according to Art 45(3A) of the FC, a member of the Senate shall not hold office for more than two terms. c. House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat) A General Election is held every five years to elect members of the Dewan Rakyat. Parties with the most votes can form a government to rule the country. Customarily, a Bill originates in the Dewan Rakyat. Once approved, it is tabled in the Dewan Negara for another debate. After that, the Bill has to be approved before being presented to the YDPA for his consent. The Bill will then be gazetted in the form of ‘Government Gazette’, thus making the Bill a law as stated in the Government Gazette. According to Art 46(1) of the FC, the Dewan Rakyat has 222 elected members. Out of these 222 members, according to Art 46(2)(a) of the FC, 209 members from the States in Malaysia. According to Art 46(2)(b) of the FC, 13 members consists of 11 members from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, 1 member from Federal Territory of Labuan and 1 member from Federal Territory of Putrajaya.\n\nExplain the membership of parliament.

As per Art 48 of the FC, provides for the disqualification for membership of Parliament such as having been declared to be of unsound mind, he is an undischarged bankrupt, or he holds an office of profit, or he has been convicted of an offence by a court of law in the Federation. Art 51 of the FC provides for the resignation of members. It is provided that a member of either House of Parliament may resign his membership by writing under his addressed, he is a member of the Senate, to the President of the Senate, and if a member of the DR, to the Speaker of that House. Lastly, under Art 54 of the FC it is stated that when there is a vacancy, it must be filled within 60 days and a by-election must be held.\n\nExplain the legislative process as follows: a. Pre-Parliamentary Stage It is the proposal [lobby], consultation and drafting stages. These involve delicate and lengthy negotiations among the various interested parties such as the sponsoring government department, NGOs, senior officials of the Ministries concerned, the Minister who will pilot the Bill through Parliament, the Drafting Unit of the Attorney General’s chambers, the Cabinet Committee on Legislation and the Cabinet. It is at this stage, the Bill takes shape and its policies and principles are hammered out. b. Parliamentary Stage. The “readings” in the first House. This is not provided for in the law but is laid down In the Standing Orders of each House. The readings permit a Bill to be scrutinised, debated and if required, amended. The Bill goes through four stages, first of all, it is the first reading. This is a mere formality where the title of the Bill is read. There is no debate and no voting. The Bill is then circulated to all members. The Second Reading is a crucial stage. There will be vigorous debate on the merit and principles of the Bill, but no amendments are allowed.
