        "text": "üì£ EU Directive 2024/1226: Strengthening Enforcement of Union Restrictive Measures üìú On April 29, 2024, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union issued Directive (EU) 2024/1226, defining criminal offenses and penalties for violating Union restrictive measures. üìù The directive aims to establish minimum rules to ensure effective application of Union restrictive measures, safeguarding the internal market and promoting security. It outlines penalties for circumventing such measures, including freezing funds and economic resources, and restrictions on admission (travel bans). ‚úÖ Violations, intentional or through serious negligence, constitute criminal offenses. The directive addresses various measures, including financial services, trading goods, and sectoral economic activities, aiming to strengthen enforcement and prevent circumvention.

So, the Victoria Police members are public officials. #corruptconduct #australia #justice #vicpol #misconduct #corrupt\n\nAfter being talked about *FOREVER*, it's finally here. Despite how it is styled, this new law in my view is not truly about criminalizing omissions. Functionally, it imposes a modified respondeat superior doctrine that will generally attribute an associate's foreign corruption to a corporation unless the corporation has adequate anti-bribery procedures (not merely policies) in place. Corporations now face heightened criminal liability in the absence of a genuine and demonstrable investment in building a strong culture of ethics and compliance.\n\nThe European Commission adopted an amendment on 18 August 2023 to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1675 to add Cameroon and Vietnam to the list of high-risk third countries. The amendment will go through scrutiny by the European Parliament for a month and if there is not objection, will be published after which it enters into force 20 days from publication (so probably around mid-October). And if someone is wondering why Croatia is not added whereas the FATF has added Croatia to its grey list: Croatia as EU member state is not a third country and will therefore not be added to the list of high-risk third countries. https://lnkd.in/eFE3Ra4p\n\nThe European Commission adopted an amendment on 18 August 2023 to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1675 to add Cameroon and Vietnam to the list of high-risk third countries.
