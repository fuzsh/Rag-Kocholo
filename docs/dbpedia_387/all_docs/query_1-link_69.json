        "text": "PETALING JAYA: Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Johari Abdul has expressed his sadness over the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, whom he just met a day prior to his assassination in Iran.\n\nJohari is in Teheran as Malaysia’s representative for the inauguration ceremony of new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday, which Haniyeh also attended.\n\nJohari said he had the opportunity to speak with Haniyeh at the ceremony.\n\n“I had a good conversation with him during the ceremony. I got to know him some time ago when he dropped by in Kuala Lumpur, so we had a personal relationship,” Johari told The Star from Teheran yesterday.\n\nALSO READ: Anwar condemns Israeli hit job\n\n“Haniyeh was a close friend of the Prime Minister (Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim). When he visited the Prime Minister, I had the opportunity to meet him. This is how I got to know Haniyeh,” he said, while expressing his condolences to Haniyeh’s family.\n\nJohari said he met Haniyeh during the ceremony at about 4.30pm local time in Teheran on Tuesday.\n\n“We discussed the time he spent in Kuala Lumpur. I said the Prime Minister (Anwar) sent his salam (greetings).\n\n“Then after that, both of us went to see the newly elected president of Iran, and we spent a few minutes there,” he added.\n\nJohari said he did not see Haniyeh at a reception held on the same night.\n\n“I was surprised to learn that he was assassinated early in the morning,” he added.\n\nJohari described Haniyeh as “very polite and soft-spoken”. He said their conversations were not related to the conflict in Gaza.\n\n“He spoke about his previous trip to Kuala Lumpur and the election of the new president of Iran,” Johari said of their last conversation.\n\nJohari said the Iranian government has increased security in Teheran following the assassination.\n\n“Khairi Omar, our ambassador here, did a good job; we received extra security coverage.\n\n“We were, of course, provided with tight security from day one. When we travelled from the hotel to all functions and venues, we were well protected,” he added.\n\n“Following the incident, I observed an increase in security measures. There is more military and police presence.\n\n“Since morning, I have not walked out of the hotel, and I just stayed inside,” he added.\n\nJohari said the Malaysian delegates are safe and are scheduled to arrive in Kuala Lumpur today."
