        "text": "In the book “Government Transformation Programme Roadmap (GTP Roadmap)” forwarded by YAB Datuk Seri Mohd Najib, the Prime Minister of Malaysia himself, 1Malaysia means fairness to all, and that no particular group of people should be discriminated. This is regardless of race, skin colour, inborn traits or physical attributes, only that equal treatment and opportunities be given to all Malaysians based on merit and need. It hopes to build a Malaysian culture of inclusiveness and mutual respect among the diverse cultures, ethnic groups and religions of the nation. However, some people believes that 1Malaysia is no more then a slogan by the government to gain mere political support. Based on 5 cases, this paper will look on how the politician’s view of 1Malaysia society. The result is believed to be very insightful as to discover politician’s thoughts and will resulted to the Malaysian society’s end product.\n\nThe behavior of Members of Parliament (MPs) in national parliaments is subject to various norms, expectations, and rules that define their jurisdiction and shape their actions. This paper examines the norms and behavior of MPs in the context of national parliaments, focusing on the jurisdiction and reality of their actions. The paper begins by defining key terms and concepts, such as parliamentary sovereignty, representation, and accountability, and explaining their significance for understanding the behavior of MPs. It then analyzes the norms and rules that govern the behavior of MPs in national parliaments, including codes of conduct, parliamentary procedures, and the role of political parties. The paper also considers the reality of MPs' behavior in practice, exploring factors that shape their actions, such as electoral incentives, party loyalty, and public opinion. It concludes by reflecting on the challenges and prospects of regulating the behavior of MPs in national parliaments, and the implications of their actions for democratic governance and representation.\n\nTolerance has been regarded as an essential key element in the modern multi-diversity society culturally, ethnically, religiously and politically. Various empirical evidences confirmed that tolerance has a positive effect towards social stability and harmony. However, when it involves voting behaviour as rational on ethnic and political tolerance, there has not been a sufficient study to explain such phenomenon. This study adds to the existing literature on ethnic tolerance, political tolerance and voting behaviour in Malaysia. This study has been conducted to address these matters, specifically, exploring the factors of voting behaviour in Malaysia. This study scrutinised such phenomena in the context of multi-ethnic Malaysia, with specific reference to the Johor Bahru (P160), Shah Alam (P108) and Bukit Bendera (P48) parliamentary. This quantitative study approach uses survey method with the self-administered set of the questionnaire as a data collection technique. Data were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). 600 respondents were engaged in the survey using multistage cluster and random sampling techniques. The findings revealed that ethnic tolerance had a significant negative relationship with voting behaviour, while political tolerance is not statistically significant. But both, ethnic tolerance and political tolerance had a significant positive correlational relationship. It also discovered that social status that is; level of education, party supported and ethnicity had a significant positive relationship with voting behaviour.Thus, it is evident that ethnic political tolerance has a considerable effect on the rationale of voting behaviour. However, the consequences vary, in which homogeneous and heterogeneous ethnicities act as intervention factors. The present study filled the gap to the current body of knowledge and bears great significance at a situation where ethnic politics are perceived as the most important matter, and tolerance has increasingly become Malaysia's national agenda in managing a multi-cultural society.\n\nWestminster institution of Parliamentary Question Time (PQT) has a special significance in enforcing ministerial responsibility. While PQT focuses mainly on departments and ministries, the Prime Minister's Question Time (PMQT) in the UK Parliament and other Westminster traditions remained more of a theatrical episode than an affective accountability tool. Bangladesh's experience with PMQT also presents a theatrical monologue. PQT and PMQT 1aken together, accountability impact of these in Bangladesh are not uncontested. Purpose of this paper is to assess the accountability inpact of ihe PQT and PMQT in Bangladesh Jatya Sangsad and compare it with the UK House of Commons with reference to the procedural rules governing the sessions, structural issues guiding the speaker's discretion in conducting sessions and the attitudinal issues regulating the individual legislators and ministers approach to the device. While the authors share the view that parliamentary questions in Bangladesh are \"generally not successful in ensuring responsible behaviour\", the current paper seeks to travel beyond this generalised claim and find the deeper reasons contributing to the failure."
