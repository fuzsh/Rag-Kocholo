        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: A total 490 offenders were detained by wlildlife enforcement authorities in operations to protect the nation's biodiversity since 2019, says Datuk Seri Huang Tiong Sii.\n\nThe Deputy Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister said that the operations were part of efforts to conserve the nation's dwindling tiger population in the wild.\n\n\"Among the efforts which have shown positive developments is the 429 cases recorded between 2019 and April 2024 under the Biodiversity Protection and Patrolling Programme involving the arrests of 490 offenders and seizures worth RM258mil,\" he said when answering a question raised by Syerleena Abdul Rashid (PH-Bukit Bendera) in the Dewan Rakyat on Wednesday. (June 26)\n\nHe also noted that punishment against poaching was increased to a maximum fine of RM1mil and maximum jail term of 15 years or both last Feb 1 under the Wildlife Conservation (Amendment) Act 2022.\n\nHe also said that the Cabinet had approved a 10-year plan in 2021 to stabilise and ensure the continued existence of wild tigers in the country by 2030.\n\nBased on the National Tiger Survey between 2016 and 2020, he said there were less than 150 tigers remaining in Peninsula Malaysia.\n\nMeanwhile, Syerleena asked if the government would consider introducing a \"Tiger Diplomacy\" initiative akin to Chinaâ€™s \"Panda Diplomacy\" to create better global awareness to protect and conserve the Malayan Tiger.\n\nHuang said that such a proposal needs a detailed study to ensure that it would be line both national and international laws.\n\nHe also said that any such initiative, if implemented, must include research and development to increase the gene pool of local tigers.\n\nTo a question by Mohd Azizi Abu Naim (PN-Gua Musang), Huang said that special units have been set up to monitor and gather information from online platforms and social media with regard to illegal online wildlife trade.\n\nHe added that wildlife authorities here are also working with non-govermental organisations to keep tabs on the illegal wildlife trade."
