        "text": "THE august House descended into a shouting match after a Perikatan Nasional MP claimed that the government is recognising the struggles of the communists through its upcoming plan to nominate Chinese new villages in Selangor as a Unesco World Heritage Site.\n\nThe heated argument began when Datuk Seri Ismail Abdul Muttalib (PN-Maran) questioned the rationale behind the proposed nomination.\n\n“If we are converting Chinese new villages into a heritage site, it means we agree with and legitimise the communists’ struggle during a dark period in Malaysian history,” he said in his speech on the motion of thanks on the royal address in the Dewan Rakyat yesterday.\n\nRSN Rayer (PH-Jelutong) stood up and raised Standing Order 36(9)c, saying that Ismail had made remarks that could promote hostility among different races.\n\n“How are Chinese new villages related to communists? These words promote ill-will and hostility among races.\n\n“I want Maran to retract his remarks and apologise because he has insulted the Chinese and also Chinese new villages,” said Rayer.\n\nDatuk Ngeh Koo Ham (PH-Beruas) then weighed in, saying that the Chinese were actually detained at these Chinese new villages instead of being placed there for de-radicalisation.\n\n“This is offensive to the Chinese. We were the victims. Don’t spin history,” Ngeh said.\n\nDeputy Speaker Alice Lau, who was chairing the session, urged Rayer and Ngeh to sit down to allow Ismail to explain the matter.\n\nIsmail said the Chinese were placed in these new villages because they were influenced by communism.\n\n“Malay new villages were also involved in communism. That is why I reject the Unesco (heritage sites nomination). It is as though we are recognising communism,” he added.\n\nLau then said there was no need for Ismail to refer to any race as being influenced by communism, adding that the latter should retract his remarks.\n\nMohd Sany Hamzan (PH-Hulu Langat) then stood up and urged Ismail to retract his remarks.\n\n“Don’t (come up with) slander. Malays were also involved in communism,” Mohd Sany said.\n\nSeveral MPs then joined in the shouting match until Lau raised Standing Order 36(9)c, stressing that Ismail should retract his remarks.\n\n“I will not retract historical facts. But if it’s (about) coarse words, I will retract (it),” said the adamant Ismail.\n\nLater at a press conference with other Perikatan MPs, Ismail said new villages were formed to curb the communist influence.\n\nHe said while serving as an internal security officer, he had been involved in efforts to contain communism.“If the new villages receive Unesco recognition, it means we are acknowledging communists’ presence in Malaysia.\n\n“We don’t want this. That is why I brought this up. We love the Chinese too, just like the Malays and Indians,” he added."
