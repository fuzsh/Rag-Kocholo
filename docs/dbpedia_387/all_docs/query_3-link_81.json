Besides advising on finance law, Azman bin Othman Luk regularly advises on regulatory issues in the TMT sector, including telecommunications network licensing requirements, data centre establishment, cloud storage, and electronic contracts. In addition, he has experience in advising financial institutions in relation to IT turnkey projects and service agreements.
