        "text": "Tan Cheng Lock (born April 5, 1883, Malacca, Straits Settlements [now in Malaysia]—died Dec. 8, 1960, Malacca, Malaya) was a Malaysian Chinese community leader, politician, and businessman.\n\nBorn into a wealthy Straits Chinese family with shipping and plantation interests, Tan Cheng Lock was an early beneficiary of the economic growth of Malaya under colonial rule. He invested especially in rubber and banking. He also acquired great familiarity with the classical European philosophers and in later life frequently used his knowledge to enliven his political discourse.\n\nHe first entered public life through the Straits Chinese British Association during World War I and in 1923 was appointed to the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements, emerging there as the most outspoken of local Chinese leaders. Campaigning against the “pro-Malay” policy of the time, he argued for a united (and eventually self-governing) Malayan society in which all ethnic groups, immigrant as well as indigenous, would have equal rights. In 1933 he became the first Asian member of the Straits Settlements Executive Council, in part, perhaps, because of his support of the government’s ban on the Kuomintang the previous year and his strongly expressed view that Malayan Chinese should be loyal only to Malaya."
