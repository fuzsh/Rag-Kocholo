I am here in my capacity as a legislative member, as a Parliament representative.\n\n“I am visiting several countries to meet my counterparts in my capacity as deputy speaker,” he was quoted telling The Vibes.\n\nThe Vibes also quoted Rashid as saying that he was invited for the December 30 dinner by Ikram Mohammad Ibrahim, the ambassador-designate of Malaysia to Austria and Slovak Republic, adding that he had said that he would visit a few countries after Vienna and return to Malaysia on January 8.\n\nThe Iran Embassy in Malaysia had on December 26 posted a tweet regarding Rashid’s meeting with his Iranian counterpart in Tehran, Iran.\n\nYesterday, Johor became the latest state to be hit by floods, with 1,080 persons from 271 families evacuated as of 4pm yesterday to 19 relief centres in the state’s Segamat and Tangkak districts."
