We believe that Prime Minister’s acknowledgment would be a much-needed shot in the arm for business community. ACCCIM lauds this move by the cabinet under the leadership of YAB Prime Minister to broaden the representation in the Dewan Negara.\n\nIt is indeed a proud moment for ACCCIM and also a major recognition of YB Senator Tan Sri Low’s outstanding leadership and enormous contributions to the business community and society.\n\nYB Senator Tan Sri Low Kian Chuan has an impressive track record as reflected in his contributions to the Chambers at the national level and Terengganu as well as other business organisations.
