        "meta_description": "Abstract The Japanese occupation of Malaysia during the Second World War has occupied a significant space in national history textbooks in Malaysia. The period has been associated with nationalist movements and independence from colonial rule. However, narratives of the Japanese occupation in school history textbooks have changed in terms of the importance given to the experiences of the three major ethnic groups in Malaysia (the Malay, Chinese, and Indian ethnic groups). This article presents an analysis of the Japanese occupation as portrayed in Malaysian national history textbooks from 1978 to 2020. It demonstrates a link between ideology and the state curriculum in Malaysia, which shows how cultural and ideological factors (namely, the political ideology of Malay dominance, or ketuanan Melayu) explain the changes made to the narratives in history textbooks.",

        "text": "Throughout former colonial states in Southeast Asia, the representation of the path to decolonization features prominently in national histories. Malaysia is no exception. The contents of national history textbooks have drawn the attention of the public, who have shared their opinions on the changes made to the history curriculum.1 The previous colonial-influenced syllabi, which were mainly focused on world history, were replaced by syllabi that focused on Malaysian history (a notable example of which was the syllabus published in 1978). These new syllabi brought with them drastic shifts in focus in terms of the amount of space given to Malaysian or local history as opposed to world history along with conceptions of what constituted Malaysian history. The year 1978 saw the introduction of a history syllabus that conceived of Malaysian history as having a “Malay base” while paying homage to the multiethnic nature of Malaysian society. The 1988 syllabus reflected a sharper focus on the Malay community, which intensified further in the 2000s before morphing into a more multicultural syllabus (which still maintained the Malay community's dominant status in terms of portrayal) in 2017.\n\nYet what sort of history is being written into these textbooks, and what sort of ideologies permeate these narratives? I have chosen to look at the narrative of the Japanese occupation in Malaysian history textbooks, because in the curriculum the occupation is framed as an event that contributed to the strengthening of political awareness, which eventually led to the movement for independence from colonial rule in Malaysian history. The occupation has been consistently featured in history textbooks published in post-independence Malaysia since 1957 and used as a starting point to segue into the process of decolonization from the United Kingdom. From 1978 to 2020, the narratives of the Japanese occupation changed subtly in their representation of the everyday experiences of the people, most notably their involvement in different nationalist and independence movements during that period. This focus on the fragmented political movements among each of the major ethnic groups in Malaysia (the Malays, Chinese, and Indians) is a microcosm via which we can understand how each of these ethnic groups are perceived to have played certain roles in the nation-building process that led to the creation of Malaysia in 1963.\n\nIn order to understand how these perceptions of each ethnic group came to be included in the narratives of the Japanese occupation, it is necessary to understand the forces that shaped the narratives (namely, the identities of their authors and the context in which they were written). This article draws upon Michael Apple's approach in setting out “the larger social context in which the current politics of official knowledge operates.”2 In the Malaysian context, contestations of the contents of national history textbooks did not arise because of economic factors, as Apple has argued was the case in the United States and the United Kingdom. Nor were the changes made to the narratives of the Japanese occupation the result of a change in international relations between Malaysia and Japan. Rather, the politics of knowledge (and by extension, the knowledge found in the history curriculum in Malaysia) has increasingly brought to the fore questions concerning the ideology of Malay dominance (specifically, the ways in which issues concerning the Malay community, Malaysian national identity, and the historical place of the Malay community in the Malaysian nation have been received by Malaysian historians and academics who led discussions on the national history curriculum in Malaysia).\n\nThe phrase “Malay dominance” (ketuanan Melayu) came into significant use in 1986, when Abdullah Ahmad, a member of parliament, used it to reassert a political system in which ethnic Malay Muslims exercised dominance and lordship in multicultural Malaysia.3 It is worth acknowledging that the ideology of Malay dominance is not monolithic. While it denotes the preeminence of Malay culture, rights, language, and customs, and is bound up with Islam, it has usually been juxtaposed against the concerns of non-Malays. This focus on Malay primacy over the non-Malay ethnic groups of Malaysia is known as Malay ethnonationalism. Tangentially, Malay ethnonationalism has been tied to the anxiety that the Malay would disappear from the world and has been viewed as rooted in civilizational bonds that make the Malay ethnicity (bangsa Melayu) a strong community and identity.4 The notion of Malay ethnicity has also been linked to the status of indigeneity. The historiographical idea is that the Malay indigenous ethnic group constituted a preexisting base society and that the other immigrant groups, such as the Chinese and Indian ethnic groups, came later and interacted with the existing Malay population. However, perhaps what is most pertinent to the study of Malaysian textbooks is the idea that the “Malay base” is the foundation upon which Malaysian society rests.\n\nWhat is indisputable is the gradual entrenchment of the idea of writing Malaysian history over the decades as if the Malay society had been considered the base society, especially since the appearance of the 1978 syllabus. But actual textbook-writing practices in Malaysia still left some latitude to the individual writers’ creativity and propensity to articulate historical narratives when interpreting historical development (as can be seen from the differences found in different textbooks from the same period). Hence, the way in which historical interpretation and narratives are articulated depends on the respective textbook writers, decisions made in relation to curriculum design, and the choice of writers by the curriculum development officials. The latter aspect became particularly relevant from 1988 onward, when only one common textbook series was produced and used at a time.\n\nPortrayals of wars in history textbooks are often intertwined with ideology and the fostering of nationalism.5 These portrayals lend themselves easily to the crafting of a narrative that can be used as part of nation-building efforts in the classroom. For Keith Crawford and Stuart Foster, the impact of war upon society is fundamental, as it destroys established structures of identity and community, and invites societies affected by war to reconstruct “national, ethnic, social, and individual senses of belonging that meet new conditions” and “reflect long-standing cultural attachments.”6 Considering this characterization of war as a disruptor in many textbook narratives, it is no wonder that Japanese imperialism figures prominently in East Asian and Southeast Asian national history textbooks.\n\nMultinational studies of the portrayal of wars in history textbooks assume a link between these war narratives and national identity, whereby the history textbooks have the power to shape national identity and are in turn shaped by the sociopolitical contexts in which they are written.7 In the case of Malaysia, the war narrative is used to set the stage for a heightened political consciousness that would eventually lead to the fall of British colonialism in Malaya, later Malaysia. Sandra Khor Manickam argues that the national history textbooks used in Malaysian secondary schools are wielded explicitly as nation-building tools in order to emphasize the position of each ethnic group relative to the dominant majority ethnic group, the Malays.8\n\nKevin Blackburn and ZongLun Wu point out how this approach was part of a general trend of moving away from the multicultural syllabus instituted during the 1950s to one prioritizing Malay-centric history by 1990.9 These changes are attributed to the increasing Malay dominance in academic historiography, as reflected in the ideas of Malay teachers, historians, and politicians.10 Manickam also points out that this trend took place against a backdrop of government policies that solidified the hold of Malay dominance in national culture and identity, paving the way for a nationalistic narrative along Malay-centric lines.11 In the case of Malaysian history textbooks, a Malay-centric perspective would constitute a narrative that features issues and concerns important to the Malay community at the expense of other ethnic groups.\n\nIn the Malaysian context, the Japanese occupation has become increasingly prominent in citizen education, whereby it is viewed as having intensified some form of Malayan (later, Malaysian) nationalism along the road to independence from British colonial rule. This approach is characterized by a move away from world history (in which the historical event is depicted as unfolding in the wake of government orders in the 1960s) toward a localized historical approach that focuses on the everyday experiences of the people of Malaya, an approach that has remained in force since 1978.\n\nOver the years, the narrative of the Japanese occupation has become increasingly intertwined with the growth of nationalism and increased political participation. While the representation of ethnic groups and their activities changed over time, the presentation of the effects of the Japanese occupation on Malayan society has been stratified according to ethnicity in a way that emphasizes the different experiences of each of the major ethnic groups.\n\nThis trend began with the textbooks published in 1990. Cheah Boon Kheng's commentary on the representation of the Japanese occupation in Malaysian history textbooks also reveals that from 1990 references to the Malay guerrilla forces in Force 136, which was multiethnic in terms of membership, were increased at the expense of references to the Chinese-dominated Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA).12 According to Cheah's characterization, Malaysian history textbooks feature a narrative of the Japanese occupation that prioritizes the exploits of the Malay ethnic group by expanding stories of their roles in the resistance movement at the expense of non-Malay ethnic groups (in this case, the Chinese ethnic group).\n\nHelen Ting's comparative work on the Japanese occupation narratives in government-sanctioned textbooks and textbooks used in independent Chinese secondary schools (which follow a separate curriculum not used in government schools) from the early 2000s also reveals the existence of Malay bias in the textbook that succeeded the one analyzed by Cheah.13 She concludes that the effect of the narrative is to make the Malay war memory the dominant national war memory in Malaysian history textbooks.14 Hence, between the two of them, Ting and Cheah paint a pattern of increasing Malay bias in the narrative of the Japanese occupation in Malaysian history textbooks from 1990 to 2004.\n\nYet the narrative of the Japanese occupation published in the 2020 history textbook reveals that some elements of multiculturalism have recently started to reappear. While this textbook was published after the first regime change in Malaysian history in 2018, even more surprising is the fact that the syllabus for this textbook was prepared before 2017 under the old regime.15 Hence, it is unlikely that the narrative of the Japanese occupation had changed because of the change in regime and the corresponding shift in ideology. This change invites us to consider how national policies regarding the portrayal of various ethnic groups in Malaysia have evolved since the appearance of Malay-centric history textbook narratives in the classrooms.\n\nIn this article, the timeline collectively traced by Cheah and Ting will be extended to include the narrative of the Japanese occupation in the 2020 textbook, which replaced the narrative found in the 2004 textbook. This article will also compare two textbooks used in 1978 (the textbook by Muniandy Thambirajah and the one by Zainal Abidin Abdul Wahid, Khoo Kay Kim, and Muhd Yusof Ibrahim), as opposed to the approach taken by Cheah in which only the former was analyzed. While other textbooks containing narratives of the Japanese occupation existed during this period, I have chosen these two textbooks because of the relative popularity of Thambirajah's textbook in classrooms across Malaysia and Zainal Abidin's and Khoo's status as esteemed Malaysian historians. This article will trace the changes in the narratives of the Japanese occupation in Malaysian history textbooks that were made between 1978 and 2020, paying particular attention to the influence of Malay ethnonationalism on the narratives found therein (in particular, their contents) and the textbook-writing process.\n\nConclusion\n\nStudying the Japanese occupation in Malaysian history textbooks has revealed that the ideologies expressed in nation-building narratives are always in flux. The forms of these ideologies usually change over the decades, giving rise to the existence of contesting narratives. The changing narratives reveal the malleability of war memory and its constant reshaping to suit the agendas of the state at any given point in time. A brief examination of the role of historian-ideologues (to borrow Milner's term) who have participated in the textbook-writing process, such as Zainal Abidin, has revealed a link between discourses on Malaysian historiography and the contents of Malaysian history textbooks. This link indicates a persistent relationship between ethnicity, politics, and history textbook writing, in which Malay ethnonationalism predominates. This finding is similar to those of Cheah who, in his article examining the origins of controversies relating to Malaysian historiography, has pointed out that the specter of Malay dominance produces conflicting views on what the writing of history should be in Malaysia.\n\nAn examination of these links reveals that in the Malaysian context, history textbook narratives are constantly being reshaped by forces outside the text itself, including ethnicity, and in particular by changing notions of Malay ethnonationalism. These textbook ideologies reflect the development of Malay ethnonationalism from its emergence in the 1970s, its rise in the 1990s, and its apex in the early 2000s (as Malay dominance, or ketuanan Melayu) to its coexistence with the idea of a Malay-dominated Malaysian multiculturalism encapsulated in the narrative of the Japanese occupation in textbooks from the 2010s."
