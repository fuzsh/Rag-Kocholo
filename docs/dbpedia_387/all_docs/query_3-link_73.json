TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM 45 sovereignty of law and administration of the country in general. This topic will also explain the functions of the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary bodies. You will explore their respective schedule of duties and the relationship between the three bodies. The administrative machinery generally, is headed by the Prime MinisterÊs Department and supported by the ministries, government agencies, statutory bodies and commissions. Thus, we will examine the functions and responsibilities of all the components of the administrative machinery and observe the links between the entire machinery. You would surely come to understand the necessity for the machinery to operate smoothly to ensure the rapid development of the country. COUNCIL OF RULERS AND THE YANG DIPERTUAN AGONG 3.1 The Council of Rulers is an official body with the highest status in the country. The body comprises all nine Sultans or Kings and the four Governors or Yang di- Pertua Negeri. The Council does not possess legislative and governing powers but has strong influence and plays an important role in the country. The official members of the Council are the Heads of the eleven respective States. Attendance in the Council can be represented by the Raja Muda of a particular state if the stateÊs constitution allows. Among the schedules of duties of the Council of Rulers are: (a) Electing the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and Deputy; (b) Agreeing or disagreeing to issues relating to cultures and customs of Islam for the entire Federation of Malaya, excluding Sabah and Sarawak. (c) Giving consent or not consenting to any legislation passed or giving advice on the election of any position that requires the consent of the Council of Rulers. (d) Proposing national policies and any matters deemed necessary for the development of the country. The Council of Rulers has a special body that functions to preserve the special rights of the Malays. Should any issue occur to bring about changes to the special position held by the Malays, the issue of interest must first be discussed with the Council. Other than that, the Council must also be consulted before the following appointments are made by the Yang Dipertuan Agong, based on Prime MinisterÊs advice: (i) Appointment of Chief Justice, two Chief Judges and Federal Court Judges, as well as two High Court Judges;\n\n3. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM46 (ii) Appointment of Auditor-General; and (iii) Appointment of members to independent commissions such as the Public Service Commission and Elections Commission. In carrying out its duties, the Council of Rulers has, at its discretion, powers to: • Elect or remove the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and Deputy; • Give advice on any appointments; • Consent or not consent to any legislation that would alter the boundaries of a state as well as touch on the special rights, position and the nobility and standing of the Rulers; and • Consent or not consent so that any actions, practices or rituals of the Islam religion encompass the entire Peninsular of Malaysia. You already know that according to the Federal Constitution, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is the Head of State. Though the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is the main component in the Parliament of Malaysia, His Highness does not have to attend all seatings of Parliament, except during the official opening of the new term of Parliament, where His Highness functions to officiate the Parliamentary session. As the Head of State, His Highness enjoys certain privileges. His Highness cannot be prosecuted in any court of law. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong is a Ruler elected according to turn by the Council of Rulers and this is enshrined in the Federal Constitution. The title Yang di-Pertuan Agong is the official title for the Head of State of Malaysia. The full honorific title is Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The post of Yang di-Pertuan Agong was created as a result of the suggestion by the Reid Commission, which drafted the Federal Constitution. Suggestions for the position of Yang Dipertuan Agong arose as a result of opposition to the forming of the Malayan Union, which was seen as an attempt to remove the institution of Malay Rulers. The five-year rotation system for the post of Yang Dipertuan Agong is considered unique. This is because it combines feudal traditions based on lineage with the modern concept based on the constitution. Malaysia is the only country in the world that practises the system of rotation for its Head of State. The system of rotation is a privilege given to Malay rulers from the states formerly known as the Federated States and Unfederated States of Malaya. The Federated States comprised Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor and Pahang. The Unfederated States were Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Johor. Heads of the states not belonging to either group cannot be elected to become the Yang Dipertuan Agong, as the states do not have Rulers.\n\n4. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM 47 On August 1957, after selecting the title Yang di-Pertuan Agong and rejecting the title Yang Dipertuan Besar which had been earlier suggested, the Council of Rulers convened to vote for the first Yang Dipertuan Agong. After the first cycle of nine Yang di-Pertuan Agongs (1957-1994), the order of Rulers to assume the position is according to the rotation used previously, which was: • Negeri Sembilan • Selangor • Perlis • Terengganu • Kedah • Kelantan • Pahang • Johor • Perak Let us now view the selection criteria of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Each Malay Ruler is entitled to be elected as the Yang Dipertuan Agong unless the Ruler: • Does not meet the age requirement; • Rejects being elected Yang di-Pertuan Agong; and • Intends to be exempted due to medical reasons. In the context of the rotation system, the Ruler highest on the list would be offered the post of Yang di-Pertuan Agong. His Highness would hold the position for five years. However, there is an exception, whereby His Highness can step down or be stripped of the position before the term expires. The following are the methods in electing the Yang di-Pertuan Agong: • Only Rulers may be elected. However, selection is done based on seniority; • Only Rulers may vote. Non-royal members of the Council of Rulers, i.e. the Governors, do not attend the meeting to elect the Yang di-Pertuan Agong; • Selection is based on rotation. The Ruler of a state cannot be elected twice in the same rotation; and • A Sultan or Ruler may appoint another party from His HighnessÊ state as a proxy to represent His Highness. You should understand that the monarchy, as well as the related customs and traditions have long existed in Malaya, while the institution of the Yang di- Pertuan Agong has only been in practice since independence.\n\n5.

TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM  49 From the point of administration of the country, there are three bodies that have separate powers. Do you know what those bodies are? The bodies are:  Executive  Legislative  Judiciary The separation of powers between the three bodies is undertaken to ensure there is no accumulation of power in any one body. This is what is meant by the doctrine of Separation of Powers. This idea was put forward by Montesqieu, a French literature and law philosopher in the 18th century. The Doctrine of Separation of Powers is aimed to prevent any party from possessing absolute power, which would lead to abuse (see Figure 3.1). The Yang di-Pertuan Agong, as the Head of State, helms all three bodies. Figure 3.1: Chart representing the Separation of Powers in Malaysia What are the methods used in the selection of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong? Discuss the actions taken should a Ruler reject this position. SELF-CHECK 3.1\n\n7. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM50 EXECUTIVE BODY3.2 The executive body is led by the Prime Minister who is appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The Prime Minister, in turn, leads the government (Cabinet) and also the party that holds the majority in Parliament. From the aspect of the Constitution, the executive power is vested in the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. This means that all government matters are carried out in the name of His Highness. The Constitution makes provision that in carrying out executive duties, His Highness is required to act based on the advice of the Cabinet of Ministers, or on the advice of a Minister empowered by the Cabinet. To refresh your memory, His Highness Âacts on discretionÊ when taking action without the advice of the Cabinet. This issue occurred in 1986 and led to what is known as the Constitutional Crisis. 3.2.1 Cabinet of Ministers The Cabinet of Ministers is a body that carries out the executive duties held by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Cabinet policies are duties exercised by the governmentÊs administrative machinery at the Federal or Central Government levels. The Cabinet is headed by the Prime Minister and consists of Ministers with certain portfolios. They are collectively responsible in all decisions made by the Cabinet. As the Cabinet is the highest authority in the country responsible for forming government policies, hence there are several Permanent Committees which have been set up. These committees are chaired and consist of the relevant Ministers. Apart from the committees, there are various councils formed to streamline the administration of the country, i.e.: (a) National Land Council (b) National Council for Local Governments (c) National Finance Council (d) Armed Forces Council\n\n8. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM 51 All the Councils are chaired by Ministers responsible for the respective portfolios. All the councils above are provided for in the Federal Constitution. There are other councils formed by the government to smoothen the functioning of the administration such as: (i) National Action Council (ii) National Economic Council (iii) National Security Council The National Action Council is the highest administrative council. It was formed to streamline the execution of all government plans and development projects. All Cabinet Ministers are required to attend the Council. The National Economic Council is tasked with specific responsibilities towards the aspect of the national economy, while the National Security Council acts to coordinate duties related to the security of the country. We will further discuss on the Cabinet System and Ministries in Topic 5 later. 3.2.2 Prime Minister The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet. He has the power to nominate whom ever to be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to the Cabinet. Generally, who ever appointed to be part of the Cabinet of Ministers can be, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, cooperative and supportive of the Prime Minister. In conclusion, the actual power of governance lies in the hands of the Prime Minister whose advice must be accepted by His Highness the Yang Di-pertuan Agong. 3.2.3 Legislative Body Legislation refers to laws legislated by the special body responsible from the aspect of the Constitution. The primary function of the legislative is to legislate, amend or repeal laws in accordance with the wishes of the body. The legislative power in Malaysia is determined in the Constitution of the Federation of Malaysia. The legislation of laws in legislative form in carried out by the Parliament of Malaysia at the federal level, and the State Legislative Assembly at the state level. The Federal and State legislative bodies are not supreme. Both the bodies can legislate laws on boundaries which are determined by the Federal Constitution and State Constitution. Legislative matters are divided among the two bodies. Whereas, the Parliament of Malaysia creates laws.\n\n9. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM52 Laws created before Independence continue to be enforced in the country until they are amended or annulled by the respective bodies. To date many amendments and annulments have been made. Article 44 Topic 4, Section 4 of the Federal Constitution make provision for the federal legislative powers to be placed with the Parliament, which comprises the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Dewan Negara and Dewan Rakyat. 3.2.4 Dewan Negara Membership of the Dewan Negara is provided in the Federal Constitution under Section 4, Topic 4 Article 45. This provision states that the Dewan Negara has 70 members known as Senators. Of this number, 44 are appointed by the Yang di- Pertuan Agong and 26 elected by the State Legislative Assemblies of the 13 states (2 representatives per state). The term of a Senator lasts 3 years and a senator cannot hold the post for more than two terms. To qualify as a senator, a candidate has to fulfil the following requirements: (a) Citizen of Malaysia (b) Aged 30 and above (c) Of sound mind (d) No criminal record 3.2.5 Dewan Rakyat Membership of the Dewan Rakyat is provided in the Federal Constitution under Section 4, Topic 4 Article 46. This provision states that the Dewan Rakyat has 222 members known as Members of Parliament. 209 of the members of Parliament are from the states in Malaysia, 11 from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, and one each from the Federal Territories of Labuan and Putrajaya respectively. The age of a member of Parliament must be 21 years and above. Among the requirements to be a member of the Dewan Rakyat are: (a) Citizen of Malaysia (b) Not less than 21 years of age (c) Of sound mind (d) Not bankrupt\n\n10. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM 53 (e) No criminal record (f) To submit expenses statement for Parliamentary elections for a stipulated period of time, which is 33 days from the date of the announcement of election results 3.2.6 Function and Powers of Parliament Legislatively, the Parliament has the power to create laws, as provided in the Federal Constitution under Articles 66-68, Section 4 Topic 5. Among the functions of the Parliament are: (a) Legislative powers, that is, the authority to create, amend or annul laws. (b) Create new or additional taxes, or annul any tax. (c) Approve the national budget for each year. Figure 3.2: The Parliament building The Parliament (Figure 3.2) is a legislative body for the Federal government, and forms laws that can be enforced throughout the country. The Parliament approves federal laws, amends existing federal laws, examines government policies, approves government budget and approves new tax revenues. The Parliament is also a forum for criticism and a focus for public opinions on national issues. To enable the Parliament to carry out its functions fully and\n\n11. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM54 efficiently, the Constitution makes provision for several privileges and immunities termed ÂParliamentary Members PrivilegeÊ in the Dewan. These privileges wholly extend to both chambers, and are for Members of Parliament individually. Both chambers have the authority to legislate their respective procedures, have absolute power on respective proceedings, and these powers cannot be challenged in any court of law. The chambers can penalise any acts that violate the privileges or are in contempt in the Dewan. Members of Parliament are exempt from both criminal and civil legal actions for whatever that is said in the Dewan, and exemption is extended to whomever who acts for the Dewan. SELF-CHECK 3.2 Fill up the table with the relevant information on the requirements to be a member of the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara. Member of Dewan Negara Member of Dewan Rakyat Similarities Differences 3.2.7 Process of Making Laws in Parliament The Parliament has the power to make laws through the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara, approving bills which are consented by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. All draft laws have to be initiated in either Parliamentary chamber, the exception being bills on finance which must be initiated in the Dewan Rakyat. Each bill approved by a chamber of Parliament must undergo four stages before being approved: (a) First Reading (b) Second Reading (c) Discussion at Committee Level (d) Third Reading\n\n12. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM 55 After the bill undergoes the four stages in the Dewan Rakyat, it will be presented to the Dewan Negara. If approved, it is then presented to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The draft law then becomes a law or act after receiving consent from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, and His Highness will use the Great Royal Seal. After that, the draft law will be presented as a law in the Government Gazette. If a bill does not receive the consent of His Highness, it must be debated again in the Dewan Rakyat and presented to His Highness for the second time. If consent is still not given, Article 66 in the Federal Constitution provides that in the subsequent 30 days, the bill will considered as been given consent by His Highness. ACTIVITY 4.1 JUDICIARY3.3 The judiciary is a body of judges in a constitutional system. Judges are given the power to interpret and execute the law with the authority vested in them. This power is enshrined in the Federal Constitution of Malaysia. In the liberal democratic system practised in our country, the judiciary is the third branch of the government in the balance of power. To carry out all the judicial functions, the Federal Constitution makes provision for the creation of a system of courts. Courts wield great power in the executive and legislative bodies because they: (a) Have the power to interpret the constitution of the country; (b) Interpret a certain law; (c) Declare a written law of the Federation or of a state; and (d) Declare the actions of the government to be illegal. Laws made by judges and the executive are interlinked in the philosophy of law. Here, the executive makes or legislates laws and the courts implement these laws, if properly legislated. The courts can interpret certain parts of the law (act, enactment or ordinance) to be illegal for being against its sphere of power. However, the courts cannot amend laws as the power to amend laws is under the jurisdiction of the executive or Parliament only. 3.3.1 Judicial Authority in Malaysia Judicial authority for the judiciary body in Malaysia is provided for in Article 121 (1) of the Federal Constitution. The functions of the judiciary are stated in Articles 121-131 (A). To implement judicial duties in the country, the system of courts was created. The courts also have powers in the legislative and executive matters.\n\n13. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM56 3.3.2 Independence of the Judiciary The independence of the judiciary system can be seen from the following: (a) A judge (Federal Court Judge or High Court Judge), after being appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, cannot be stripped of the post before reaching retirement age, which is 65 years. The exception applies for poor conduct judge, or being unable to carry out duties due to sickness or other reasons that can affect duties. Dismissal from post has to be recommended by a tribunal (on advice by the Prime Minister) which is appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The tribunal contains five or more judges who are either retired or hold positions in Malaysia or other Commonwealth countries. (b) The salary of a judge is provided for by the Parliament and it has to be paid to the Unified Fund. (c) The salary and other conditions of the post cannot be altered. (d) The conduct of a judge cannot be discussed in any chamber of Parliament, unless put forward by not less than one fourth of the Dewan Rakyat or Dewan Negara members. Figure 3.3 illustrates the judicial system in Malaysia. Figure 3.3: Judicial system in Malaysia\n\n14. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM 57 3.3.3 Appointment of Judges Judges are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong upon conferring with the Council of Rulers and with advice from the Prime Minister. Before appointing a judge, the Prime Minister also has to consult the Chief Justice. Regarding the appointment of the Chief Judge of Malaya, the Prime Minister has to consult two Chief Judges of the High Court. When appointing the Chief Judge of Borneo, he has to consult the Chief Ministers of Sabah and Sarawak respectively. He also has to consult two Chief Judges when appointing a Federal Court judge; and for the appointment of a High Court Judge, he has to consult the Chief Judge of the related Court in addition to the Chief Justice. Sessions court judges are appointed by His Highness upon recommendation by the Chief Judges. First Class Magistrates for the Federal Territories are also appointed by His Highness. Meanwhile, for the other states, appointment is done by the respective Rulers or Governors upon recommendations from the Chief Judges. Second Class Magistrates for the Federal Territories are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong while for the states, they are elected by the Rulers or Governors without the involvement of the Chief Judges. ACTIVITY 3.1 Courts have powers in the legislative and executive areas. Explain with examples how the courts can implement those related duties. CABINET SYSTEM AND MINISTRIES3.4 The Federal Government system in Malaysia is generally implemented by the executive known as the Cabinet. Did you know that this body comes under the executive powers of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong? This issue is cemented in Article 39 of the Federal Constitution which explains that the executive powers for the Federation of Malaya lies with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Article 43 also explains that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong has to appoint a Cabinet to advice His Highness in implementing his duties. In the context of Malaysia, the Cabinet is headed by a Prime Minister and consists of the other ministers. The Cabinet is formed by the party that obtains a majority in the Parliamentary general elections. The appointment of the Prime Minister, Ministers and Deputy Ministers has to be consented by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. It should be mentioned that deputy ministers are not members of the Cabinet. Therefore deputy ministers do not attend the weekly ministerial meetings held on every Wednesday, usually in the Prime Minister's Department.\n\n15. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM58 Each minister or cabinet member is collectively responsible for all meeting decisions. Therefore, members who disagree with or disobey a decision must relinquish his or her post. Let us examine the functions of the Malaysian Cabinet. Generally, the functions of the Malaysian Cabinet are to: (a) Determine national policies; (b) Administrate and implement tasks in accordance with the stipulated area of authority; (c) Coordinate the system of administration of the country to be efficient and stable; and (d) Find solutions to issues in the country affecting the peopleÊs interests. The country's administrative machinery receives and implements all directives from the Cabinet. The machinery involves, among others, the Prime Minister's Department, ministries, public corporations, statutory bodies and commissions. Each one has a specific function to ensure the smooth operation of the country's administrative machinery. ACTIVITY 3.2 Do you wish to know the nationÊs cabinet line-up? You can do so by surfing the following website: http://www.pmo.gov.my/ (Retrieved February 19, 2009) Discuss and share your opinions with your classmates. 3.4.1 Government Agencies Government agencies are generally divided into two categories, which are: (a) Central agencies; and (b) Executive agencies.

To date, there are 27 ministries and each ministry is aided by its respective departments, sections, agencies and statutory bodies. The total number of ministries can be increased or decreased according to the needs of the country. The head of administration for a ministry is the Chief Secretary while the administrative authority for the Prime Minister's department is the National Chief Secretary. The National Chief Secretary is also the head of public administration at the federal level. All chief administrators of the Prime Minister's department and ministries are civil servants.\n\n21. TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM64 The functions of a ministry are to: (a) Plan policies, control and coordinate programmes under the MinisterÊs directives; and (b) Control the implementation of programmes by implementation agencies. Under each ministry, there are several departments that assist in implementing the functions above. Examples of important department in ministries of the federal government are shown in Table 3.1.

TOPIC 3 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM68 COMMISSIONS3.6 To ensure the governmentÊs administrative machinery runs smoothly and systematically, the government formed various commissions, both permanent and on ad hoc basis. Permanent commissions are like the Elections Commissions and Public Services Commissions. Ad hoc commissions are formed to investigate or solve problems and current issues. A commission is an independent body, just and impartial. The establishment of a commission, whether permanent or ad hoc, is to ensure that the commission can carry out administrative duties efficiently and fairly, especially in order to form a peaceful and harmonious nation. To guarantee the commission is independent without interference from any parties, the members of the commission are specially appointed. The commission members are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, after consultation with the Council of Rulers. Politicians (Ministers, Members of Parliaments, State Assemblymen) cannot be appointed to any commission. Commission members can only be dismissed via a tribunal. The salary for the members of the commission are determined by Parliament from the Joint Funds. Among the permanent commissions at the Federal level are: (a) Public Services Commission–specifically for civil servants; (b) Education Services Commission specifically for educators and teachers; (c) Police Commission specifically for members of the police force; (d) Commission for Legal and Judicial Services specifically for members of the judiciary and legal profession; and (e) Armed Forces Council- specifically for members of the armed forces. Ad hoc commissions are special and independent commissions established to study or analyse a current issue of interest and to provide suggestions to the government. Examples of ad hoc commissions include: (i) Aziz Salary Commission; and (ii) Harun Salary Commission.\n\n26.
