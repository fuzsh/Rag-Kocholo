The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) is a conservative and Chinese nationalist political party in Malaysia, founded in 1949. The party sought to represent the interests of the sizeable Chinese population in Malaysia, and it held most of the Chinese vote until the 1960s. The party joined the Barisan Nasional coalition to assist in governing Malaysia, but its conservative views would not resonate with progressive Chinese Malaysians; since 2008, most Chinese have voted for the Democratic Action Party instead. In 2017, the MCA held 10/70 Dewan Negara seats, 7/222 Dewan Rakyat seats, and 12/587 Dewan Undangan Negeri seats.
