Prime Minister Jean Chrétien announced today that the Prime Minister of France Jean-Pierre Raffarin, will visit Canada from May 21 to 24, 2003. Prime Minister Raffarin will be accompanied by ministers of foreign trade, industry and cooperation and la Francophonie as well as select business leaders.

"With strong historical, cultural and linguistic ties that unite us, France continues to be an important partner for Canada," said the Prime Minister. "We share similar perspectives and common interests in a number of areas, including sustainable development, the G8 Africa Action Plan and cultural diversity."

In Ottawa, the two leaders will discuss bilateral trade, investment, youth exchanges and the cooperation that has increased considerably in recent years in the areas of justice and public sector management. They will also talk about current international issues, development assistance and cultural diversity, as well as relations between Canada and Europe.

Recognizing that France is the second largest foreign investor in Canada, Prime Minister Raffarin will also meet with Canadian and French business leaders in Ottawa, Montréal and Québec City.

This is Prime Minister Raffarin's first official visit to Canada.
