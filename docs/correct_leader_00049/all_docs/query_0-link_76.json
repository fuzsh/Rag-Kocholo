        "text": "On February 10, 2009, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Hui met in the Foreign Ministry with former French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin.\n\nLi expressed welcome to Raffarin, who headed a France-China friendship delegation to visit China. Li said the Chinese government attaches great importance to bilateral ties and has always been committed to the China-France comprehensive partnership, adding that China has made great efforts for the development of bilateral cooperation in all areas. The establishment and development of comprehensive strategic partnership are hard-won achievements that deserve to be cherished. China hopes that in the face of the current difficult situation, France will take the initiative to show with practical action the importance attached by the country to Chinaâs core concerns and major interests, said Li. The Chinese side also called for Franceâs efforts to start from safeguarding the overall situation of bilateral ties and get bilateral ties back to normal as soon as possible. Li hoped that Mr. Raffarin will play an active role in this regard.\n\nRaffarin said his country attaches great importance to the strategic significance of bilateral ties, which the French side has no doubt about. The French leaders have always deemed China a comprehensive strategic partner and are ready to maintain sound relations with China. France respects Chinaâs sovereignty and territorial integrity and supports Chinaâs reunification and stability. Raffarin said his country will seriously deal with Chinaâs concerns and try to push bilateral ties back to the normal track.\n\nRaffarin and his delegation were here on a visit to China from Feb. 8 to Feb. 14 at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. On February 9, he attended a symposium marking the 45th anniversary of the establishment of China-France diplomatic ties held by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries."
