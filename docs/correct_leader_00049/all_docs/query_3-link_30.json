        "text": "President Jacques Chirac confirmed his popular interim prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, in office yesterday and prepared minor cabinet changes as the final results in the general election made his government one of the strongest in Europe.\n\nHis conservatives and their allies have 399 of the 577 seats in the national assembly, extending the recently re-elected president's unprecedented grip on all the key public institutions, including both houses of parliament.\n\nBut despite its dominance on paper the government can expect anything but a smooth ride in the coming months as it seeks to implement a series of urgent but often controversial reforms.\n\nThe circumstances of the victory could prove as much of a curse as a blessing, analysts said, since the voters' prime concern was to shut out the National Front and avoid another period of uncomfortable power-sharing between a rightwing president and a leftwing government.\n\n\"Chirac has no real mandate for specific policies,\" the political analyst Henri Rey said. \"There was no real debate about his policies, nor about the serious sleaze allegations levelled against him in his first term.\n\n\"The nature of his victory creates an imperative for him to be very, very careful in government.\"\n\nMr Raffarin is expected to announce a bigger but largely unchanged cabinet, with the exception of the European affairs minister, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, who finally bowed to pressure to resign because he is under investigation for alleged fraud and party funding irregularities.\n\nAnalysts say it is too early to be sure that Mr Chirac has learnt from past mistakes, although there are signs that he has toned down the old arrogance. He squandered his first parliamentary majority in 1997 by launching savage public spending cuts, prompting national strikes and social unrest.\n\nHis subsequent decision to call a snap election proved disastrous, resulting in a Socialist-led government for the next five years.\n\nThis time some of Mr Chirac's promised reforms are in danger of proving at least as controversial as his earlier swingeing budget cuts.\n\nThe biggest question marks hangs over the â‚¬30bn in tax cuts he has promised over five years, combined with heavy additional spending on the police and army.\n\nThe cost has drawn warnings from Brussels, Berlin, the OECD and French industry, all of which suspect France is preparing to abandon its EU pledge to balance its budget within the next two years.\n\nThe government has said it remains committed \"in principle\" to the balanced budget deadline, which was restated at the Barcelona EU summit in March. But during his presidential election campaign Mr Chirac said the target was \"not imperative\" and could be shifted to 2007.\n\nGermany and many other EU states fear that if France relaxes its budgetary discipline their own painful efforts to control public finances will be as good as wasted.\n\n\"Hans Eichel, the German finance minister, has said he would \"not lift a single finger\" to help France if it weakened the guidelines for public spending.\n\nOn the domestic stage Mr Chirac may run into serious trouble on another of his main campaign pledges: to overhaul the overburdened state pension system by introducing an element of private provision.\n\nHis critics, including the trade unions, argue that it will divide society between those who can afford to pay extra and those who cannot.\n\nThere is unlikely to be much fuss, however, about his much-publicised determination to crack down on crime.\n\nAn Ipsos poll published yesterday showed that 52% of the voters thought crime should be the government's top priority, followed by poverty: the main concern of 37% of the respondents."
