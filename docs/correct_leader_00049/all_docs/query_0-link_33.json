        "text": "The official holiday portraits showed France's prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, at his family's mountain retreat, studying a book with great seriousness, the French Alps clearly visible on the horizon.\n\nThe photoshoot was nicely staged - documents on the table, a mobile phone within reach - and was meant to send the clear message that France's government would not be slacking this summer.\n\nSo there was embarrassment in his press office when it emerged a few days later that Mr Raffarin had not after all spent his entire break in France, but had slipped away for a clandestine trip to a friend's villa in Portugal.\n\nThe secrecy was necessary because the prime minister, like all his cabinet colleagues, was this year under strict instructions from President Jacques Chirac to keep his holiday \"short and studious\", and, crucially, to stay within two hours of his office in Paris.\n\nAfter rifling through Air France timetables, journalists at the satirical weekly newspaper Le Canard Enchaîné pointed out that Mr Raffarin had clearly flouted the president's order because the Algarve was well beyond the two-hour limit.\n\nMr Raffarin's press office was obliged to retract its initial misleading denials of the trip, and admitted that he had been to stay with Yves Galland, an old friend and head of Boeing France, between July 29 and August 1.\n\nA spokesman insisted that it had been a personal visit and that the prime minister's office \"was not in the business of commenting on private trips\".\n\nBut when a Libération reporter asked why, if that were the case, the prime minister's holiday in the Alps had been the subject of so much media fanfare, the press officer responded with some confusion: \"That's the first time we've been asked that ... This was all decided very quickly.\"\n\nThe indiscretion has become a sensitive issue for the government, still chastened by last summer's political debacle when ministers were pictured basking at the seaside while almost 15,000 citizens were dying in an unprecedented heatwave. Mr Raffarin came in for particularly harsh criticism for his failure to leave his Alpine villa during the crisis.\n\nUnder instructions to prove that the government does not shut down for August, the cabinet's most senior members have now launched a public relations offensive, determined to outdo each other with their hyperactivity during the summer break.\n\nEvery news item - a tragic fire or the desecration of another cemetery - has been accompanied by a chorus of sympathy or condemnation from the ministers, who are falling over each other in their enthusiasm to be filmed breaking off their holiday to respond to an emergency.\n\nNo one knows what Mr Chirac feels about the prime minister's trip: the president slipped away last month to the Indian Ocean island of La Réunion - considerably further than two hours from Paris - for a holiday with his wife and poodle."
