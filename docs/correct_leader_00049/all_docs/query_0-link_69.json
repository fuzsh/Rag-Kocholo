        "text": "Tobacconists are fuming over his new cigarette taxes, due to rise 40% by January. Medical workers are wary of his plans to overhaul France’s health-care system. Actors and stagehands, outraged by his tightening of their unemployment benefits, shut down the summer culture season. Strikes by teachers and transport employees, incensed over his plans to reform pensions, brought the country to halt in May and June. And leading members of his own party are slamming his economic and social policies for being everything from too liberal to insufficiently ambitious. But since this is France, which has so often proved itself impervious to reform, fierce opposition like that means Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin must be doing something right. He certainly thinks so. “What we’ve done is enormous! Enormous!” Raffarin exclaimed in an interview with Time at his office in the Hôtel Matignon in Paris’ seventh arrondissement. But, he added, “We have to be attentive to the nervous nature of French society.”\n\nHow nervous is France? Right now Raffarin’s approval rating is 38%, the lowest point of his 16-month tenure, down from a high of 63% last December. So you might expect the Prime Minister — tasked with running domestic policy while President Jacques Chirac plays diplomatic chess with George W. Bush — to be feeling a little anxious himself. It’s not just his popularity that’s taking a beating. The French government recently announced that the economy shrank by 0.3% in the second quarter, and in August unemployment figures started creeping up again. The government is still reeling from accusations that it bungled the response to the summer’s heat wave, which left nearly 15,000 dead, and it faces condemnation from the European Commission for flouting the E.U.’s ceiling on budget deficits. In the Paris media, all this bad news has been accompanied by a wave of punditry debating whether the country is sliding inexorably into insignificance. Is Raffarin the man to turn the economy around, bring unruly unions and public sector workers into line, and create what he calls “a new France in a new Europe?”\n\nThe Prime Minister, by turns jocular and combative as he juggled a rugby ball during the Time interview, betrays no doubts. The son of a politician himself, the marketing executive-turned-provincial legislator says his grass-roots mentality and everyday tastes — including an unabashed admiration for French rock dinosaur Johnny Hallyday — give him a common touch as Prime Minister. Of course he has an answer for all his problems. His poor ratings? “The economic situation is difficult. In France, there’s always been a correlation between the popularity of the Prime Minister and the economic situation.” The sputtering economy? “We’ll have a pick-up hopefully in early 2004.” The outrage from unions? “This seems normal when you are undertaking an important reform program.” All the talk of decline? The last gasp of an enervated Parisian “nomenklatura” who “have for years been writing things that have all proved to be wrong.”\n\nBut the glum state of France isn’t that easily explained away, and Raffarin’s incremental approach to reform — a 3% income-tax cut instead of the promised 5%; shelving vital health-insurance reform until next year — may not be sufficient to the task ahead. His goals sound radical: pension reform, rationalizing the health care system, loosening labor markets, sweeping decentralization. But Raffarin is wary of risking social upheaval by moving too fast — when Prime Minister Alain Juppé did so in 1995, it triggered the crisis that resulted in his government’s ouster. And Raffarin’s critics ignore some significant achievements. Though economic liberals and some business leaders say it doesn’t go far enough, pension reform at the very least is signed and sealed. Raffarin exempted the vast number of smaller businesses in France from the strictures of the 35-hour week. Even his proposal to remove a public holiday from the national calendar to fund programs for the elderly provoked hardly a whimper of protest.\n\nBut his method of quietly forcing change leaves many longing for a clearer sense of direction. “He manages and manages and manages, but he doesn’t inspire!” moans Bernard Kouchner, the flamboyant former Socialist Minister of Health. That complaint doesn’t just come from the usual suspects, either. “There’s no overarching unity, no clarity, no sense that it’s all part of a single effort with a final goal and reason,” says Jacques Bille, a communications expert and former adviser to conservative Prime Minister Raymond Barre. “There’s no vision that makes people think, ‘Yes, I get it.'”\n\nIt’s a complaint made with particular resonance by political commentator Nicolas Baverez, whose best-selling book France Is Falling has turned national decline into the No. 1 topic among the commentariat. Baverez says the shocking results of the first round of presidential elections in April 2002 — when French voters put far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen into a runoff with Chirac — amounted to “a national cry of distress.” The massive mandate for Chirac in the second round, bolstered by parliamentary elections in June 2002 that gave conservatives a 68% majority in the National Assembly, handed Raffarin “an extraordinary possibility to make enormous changes,” Baverez argues. But he thinks that opportunity has been wasted out of political cowardice. This government, he writes, is “betraying the reforming mandate given by the voters in April 2002.”\n\nMalek Boutih, an outspoken Socialist Party official, says the government’s mandate wasn’t so much for reform as for stopping Le Pen. But that doesn’t mean it can afford to spin its wheels. “If this government sits and waits things out,” he says, “it risks exhausting public patience, and finally convincing a lot of people that mainstream politicians are just a bunch of incapable losers.”\n\nRaffarin is good at reeling off lists of accomplishments: “We’ve battled the crime problem, improved the justice system, streamlined the police and modernized the army.” But he’s pulled a good many punches, too. Not until next autumn will the government tackle a major reform of France’s free-spending health-insurance system, which is bleeding some j10 billion a year. And when it came to repealing the 35-hour week altogether, Raffarin demurred. “We can’t do everything the first year,” explains Raffarin aide Jean-François Cirelli. He acknowledges that the government’s public-pension reform won’t go even halfway to bridging the estimated j43 billion funding chasm that will open between now and 2020. Now, though, both private and public employees will have to work longer to get a full pension, and “it will be an easy matter to raise the contributions down the line if we have to,” he says. That still leaves him hoping unemployment drops by the next national elections in 2007, so that any increase in pension payments is offset by a fall in unemployment benefits.\n\nThe government has made some genuinely popular moves beyond putting more police on the streets. In September, it passed a 3% cut in income tax, which only about half of French households earn enough to pay. But joy was muted — the announcement was swiftly followed by rises in local taxes and taxes on diesel fuel and cigarettes. “People feel it’s just a game: what the government gives with one hand, it takes with the other,” says Elie Cohen, an economist and professor at Sciences Po, a Paris graduate research institute. “That creates a credibility problem.” The government clearly botched the announcement of the new taxes, but Cirelli insists taxpayers still end up ahead. And the government bravely stands by Chirac’s vow to reduce income tax by 30% before 2007 as a way — “a little bit American,” Cirelli confesses — of forcing spending cuts. But cost cutting hasn’t been seriously tackled yet; the 2004 budget holds inflation-adjusted spending level rather than reducing it, which makes getting to a 30% tax cut something of a stretch.\n\nThat leaves a lot of pain still to be administered and endured. Next year’s budget, like this year’s and last year’s, remains out of line with the 3% deficit limit imposed by the E.U.’s Stability and Growth Pact. Raffarin has dismissed the pact as “mathematics,” but smaller states that have done their fiscal homework aren’t amused. Yet making France pay a fine during an economic slump could hurt its neighbors, too. “We’re ready to do what the Commission demands,” Budget Minister Alain Lambert said last week, “as long as it bears no risk of pushing France into recession.”\n\nThe great hope for Raffarin is one that he admits remains largely outside his ken: a return to growth, starting in the U.S. and Japan and hopefully spreading to Europe by the beginning of next year. Once the economy picks up, he vows, he’ll tackle the vision thing with more gusto, focusing on completing his reforms of the pension and health-care systems and pushing power and money from Paris to the regions. To get there, Raffarin will have to confront ornery unions, suspicious voters and the Parisian élite who believe the Prime Minister is a symptom of French decline. “France is too hierarchical, too pyramidal,” he says. All the decline-mongers are “like the cork in a champagne bottle judging the champagne. That cork has to pop so we can taste the champagne.” There’s still a long way to go before the celebrations can begin."
