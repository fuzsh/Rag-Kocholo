        "text": "President Putin said Russia was ready to make advance payments this year on its Soviet-era debt to the Paris Club for previous periods. He said the results of Russia’s economic development were such that Russia was in a position, and under certain circumstances even interested, to do so.\n\nIn general, he said, Russia and France cooperated in many areas. At the same time, the President stressed that Moscow was not yet satisfied with the current level of trade and economic ties with France. But even here there was certain progress, he said, adding that trade had grown by 33% in the first six months of the year.\n\nMr Raffarin said France was behind other European countries in economic cooperation with Russia and that was why a three-year programme of economic exchange had been drawn up between the two countries.\n\nHe also conveyed a message from French President Jacques Chirac to President Putin."
