        "text": "Jean-Pierre Raffarin (born August 3, 1948, Poitiers, France) is a French businessman and politician who served as the prime minister of France (2002–05).\n\nRaffarin’s father was a member of the French National Assembly and a government minister, responsible for agriculture. Raffarin was educated in Poitiers and Paris, with law studies followed by a business school diploma in 1972. He became a product manager for a coffee business but was quickly attracted into centre-right politics by Pres. Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. He entered local politics in Poitiers in the late 1970s and spent five years (1976–81) as a political appointee in the Labour Ministry. After the victory of the Socialist Party in 1981, Raffarin returned to marketing with a group of management consultants, where his speciality was development strategies for towns and local authorities. He remained involved in politics, however, and by 1988 he was president of the regional council for the Poitou-Charentes region.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1995 Raffarin represented France in the European Parliament, where he belonged to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). During 1995–97 he was France’s national minister for small business; in that role he sponsored legislation that made it harder for big supermarkets to expand at the expense of small corner shops. He was elected to the French Senate in 1995 but did not complete his term; he was reelected in 1997 and served until 2002.\n\nRaffarin had placed himself in the middle of the fragmented political world of the French right. He rose through the centre-right Union for French Democracy and later became the deputy leader of the Liberal Democratic Party. After the first round of the 2002 presidential election, he was quick to support incumbent president Jacques Chirac’s new Union for the Presidential Majority (later renamed the Union for a Popular Movement [Union pour un Mouvement Populaire; UMP]). Chirac, following his resounding victory in the presidential runoff, named Raffarin prime minister on May 6, 2002.\n\nAt the time of Raffarin’s appointment, fewer than half the French people knew who he was, but this relative anonymity was one of the main reasons for his selection. After five years of having to share power with the Socialists, Chirac wanted a premier who not only would not eclipse him but also would be as far removed as possible from the traditional arrogant Parisian image of past prime ministers. In short, the president was looking for a modest provincial, and he appeared to find him in Raffarin, a man of rumpled suits and little swagger who had a political base in western France. Indeed, in his first months as prime minister, Raffarin cultivated the image of being open to, and part of, la France d’en bas—the France of ordinary people—and of being guilelessly determined to improve their lot. He drew attention—and sometimes controversy—for his verbal gaffes, which became known as “Raffarinades.”"
