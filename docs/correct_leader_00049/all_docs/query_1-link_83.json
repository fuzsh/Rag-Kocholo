        "text": "The goals of Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to France from May 5 to 7, 2024, are focused on scientific, cultural, sporting, and commercial cooperation as part of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France. In this context, and following an op-ed published by Le Figaro on May 5 titled \"I come to France with three messages from China,\" President Xi Jinping promises to open Chinese markets to Western companies, acknowledges understanding the significance of the Ukrainian crisis for Europeans, and expresses a commitment to mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among nations.\n\nDuring an appearance on April 29 at We Are, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, former Prime Minister and President's Envoy to China in 2018, stated that the success of this 60th anniversary would be measured by the number of projects it generates. He emphasized that cultural cooperation is key to the success of Franco-Chinese relations, which can be further understood through on-site visits.\n\nAs a central theme of the 60th anniversary festivities and the Franco-Chinese Year of Cultural Tourism, culture is at the heart of a major Franco-Chinese cooperation project through the Bpifrance cultur'export China program. This program aims to enable 20 French cultural and creative industries (CCIs) to understand China through exploration missions, allowing them to pitch and then launch their development there. The key sectors of CCIs in China include audiovisual, video games, fashion design, as well as visual arts and crafts. Immersive and interactive elements are increasingly important for Chinese CCIs. Developments such as the AI-driven digital twin in the tourism sector at the wooden pagoda in Yingxian, Shanxi, and the launch of Vidi , a Chinese AI equivalent to the American AI Sora capable of creating videos from text input, reflect this trend.\n\nThe significance of the French delegation to the CIIE in Shanghai led by the president of L'Oréal l, which President Emmanuel Macron n might join in 2024 as he did in 2019, the sector embassy, and the France Pavilion (at the China Beauty Expo of Cosmetic Valley ey in Shanghai), the visit to France by the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade, and the \"China Business Forum\" co-organized by Business France on May 6, are all illustrations of Sino-French economic cooperation.\n\nWhile the reception of tourists, particularly Chinese, during the Olympics is at the heart of the French strategy and Atout France campaigns, the Comité d'Echanges Franco-Chinois (CEFC) wondered whether the Olympics would revive Chinese tourism and whether it is still relevant to use the 2019 tourism figures as a benchmark. Or, as suggested by Linda Ho Cappelle, should the initial recovery figures of 2022 be used, considering how Chinese tourists have changed during the health crisis period?\n\nIn this context, will the Franco-Chinese Year of Cultural Tourism, driven by the CCIs, particularly in the immersive and interactive fields, along with Franco-Chinese economic cooperations, which could resume a normal growth pace after four years of suspension and the multiplying effect of a centennial event, allow France to reclaim its position as the top European tourist destination for Chinese visitors by 2024?\n\nVisit of the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, to France on May 6 and 7 in Paris and at the Col du Tourmalet.\n\nOp-ed in Le Figaro by the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.\n\nIn an op-ed for Le Figaro at the start of his visit to France, the President of the People's Republic of China promises to open Chinese markets to Western companies, affirms understanding the significance of the Ukrainian crisis for Europeans, and expresses his commitment to mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among states.\n\n\"For the Chinese, France has a unique charm. It is the cradle of so many great philosophers, writers, and artists who have inspired humanity. More than 150 years ago, the French participated in the development of shipbuilding in Fujian and the establishment of the Fujian Naval Academy. France was one of the first countries to host Chinese government scholars and, a century ago, welcomed young Chinese students, some of whom have made significant contributions to the founding and development of modern China. Read more of this op-ed (in french).\n\nCommuniqué from the French Presidency\n\nThis visit \"follows the President of the Republic's visit to Beijing and Guangzhou in April 2023.\" \"The discussions will focus on international crises, foremost among them the war in Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East, trade issues, scientific, cultural, and sports cooperations, as well as our joint actions against global challenges, notably the climate emergency, the protection of biodiversity, and the financial situation of the most vulnerable countries.\"\n\nSchedule of this visit\n\nCommuniqué de l'Elysée\n\nMandarin TV , Camille-Yihua Chen\n\n1/ Cultural Cooperation (Creative and Cultural Industries)\n\nDuring an interview with Alexia Borg, as part of the special China Eco series on Eco BFM Business CGTN, former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin highlighted the importance of exchanges between China and France and the usefulness of dialogue with China. He noted that the two countries are \"coming closer in knowledge and understanding.\" He expressed that \"the ideal is to visit China, just as it is for the Chinese to come to France. Because, a trip to China can change one’s perception of the country due to its diversity and aid in understanding it.\" He discussed how the civilizations are different, complex, and the languages difficult. Finally, he mentioned the meeting of two ancient civilizations and the time needed to grasp their structures.\n\nThe former Prime Minister was also a guest at we are_, the circle of stakeholders in the creative and digital industries, on April 29, 2024. During his exchange with the Co-founder and CEO of We Are and We Are School, Éric Newton, he particularly discussed the role that Europe should play amid international tensions, the importance of France's cultural influence, the need for foresight, and the new dangers that democracies must confront.\n\nIn this context, Jean-Pierre Raffarin believed that the success of the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France, as well as the Franco-Chinese year of cultural tourism, would also be measured \"by the number of projects\" implemented between the two countries.\n\nThe program for the 60th anniversary celebrations is certainly not lacking in projects.\n\nIn this context, notable highlights include:\n\n- The announcement of the 60th anniversary program by the President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron , during the \"Croisements\" festival in China in April 2023.\n\n- The opening ceremony in China (Harbin) featuring Olivia Gregoire and centered around an ice sculpture of Notre Dame, the third most visited site in the Paris region by Chinese tourists in 2019 (69%, according to Choose Paris Region data). This was complemented by the exhibition \"Notre-Dame de Paris: The Augmented Exhibition.\"\n\nThe opening concert in France, held on January 31, 2024, at the Royal Opera of Versailles featuring Sun Yeli and Rachida Dati . This event echoed one of the cornerstone themes of the year 2024: the exhibition \"The Palace of Versailles and the Forbidden City.\"\n\n- Tours by the Bordeaux Opera and performances of the plays \"Les Fourberies de Scapin\" and \"Les Misérables.\"\n\n- The \"Révélations China\" fair, organized by the Beijing Design Week in collaboration with Ateliers d'Art de France.\n\n- The Chinese Lantern Festival in France.\n\n- Events at the Chinese Cultural Center in Paris and exhibitions at the National Museum of Asian Arts - Guimet.\n\n- The \"China House\" during the Olympics.\n\nMore information on these celebrations: Chinese Tourism Newsletter #176 et #181\n\nCulture is the epicenter of the celebrations for this 60th anniversary, and the Cultur'Export program is one of its highlights.\n\nFunded by the General Secretariat for Investment, designed in conjunction with the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs, and operated by Bpifrance in partnership with #TeamFranceExport as part of #France2030, the Cultur’Export China program is aimed at 20 French companies from the cultural and creative industries selected to represent French expertise in Asia. The Cultur’Export China program is a training, consulting, and networking initiative for the Cultural Creative Industries #CCI. Its goal is to better understand the Chinese market, build a development strategy in China, and facilitate connections between companies and prospects to begin expanding business activities in China. Inès Ennaifer and Jean Barjon-Sebbag are involved in this initiative.\n\nRegistration deadline: May 15 https://lnkd.in/eVmPW8d4\n\nIn this context, a webinar was held on April 30 on the topic of intellectual property in China. See the link for more details replay\n\nThis webinar highlighted how Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) are at the heart of Sino-French cultural relations.\n\nChinese CCIs include: Audiovisual, video games, fashion design, visual arts, and crafts. As Aurélien Sostaponti from Business France noted, the revenue of major cultural enterprises grew by 8.5% year-on-year to €400 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The urban middle class in China allocates between 10% and 14% of its spending to education, culture, and leisure. In line with China's CCI roadmap, there has been a focus on immersive experiences and smart interactions.\n\nFurthermore, China is the leading market for CCIs in terms of video game revenue (€39 billion in 2023, up 13.95%) and player numbers, with 668 million players. Ubisoft has a significant presence in China, particularly through a partnership with Tencent, as noted in the BPI webinar (details omitted). The second largest CCI sector in China is the audiovisual sector, amounting to €140 billion (22.95%). The webinar also mentioned that live streaming events, like the Fête de la Musique, garnered 60 million views in China. Timothée Favre of Business France also mentioned that the luxury sector has driven CCIs in China.\n\nCampaigns by international brands in China are closely aligned with contemporary Made in China efforts. For example, the Louis Vuitton fashion show on April 18, 2024, in China featured a light collection inspired by POP culture and showcased an emerging Chinese artist, contemporary artist Sun Yitian,, to establish an authentic connection with the Chinese audience.\n\nHe also mentioned the similar positioning of the Monegasque brand APM, which utilized a Chinese Key Opinion Leader (KOL), Yu Yu Zhang Zou.\n\nThis campaign echoes those of two highly successful Western brands in the Chinese market: Lullulemon en Chine in China, \"Be Spring,\" was notable for its successful integration into Chinese culture.\n\nTo welcome the Year of the Dragon, Lululemon partnered with Michelle Yeoh and the theatrical dancers of \"Wing Chun\" to celebrate the arrival of spring—a season that symbolizes rebirth and new beginnings. Through a poetic depiction of the meeting between mind and body, the film explores the concept of wellness, inviting us to find eternal spring in our everyday lives. In the film, Michelle and the \"Wing Chun\" theatrical dancers both pursue spring, with Michelle representing the body and the dancers representing the mind, expressed through a combination of martial arts and dance. The quest for an eternal inner spring serves as a link between them. Michelle stated, \"Wing Chun holds a special place in my heart. In 1994, I starred in the movie 'Wing Chun', and thirty years later, I am honored to have the opportunity to collaborate with these professional dancers to reinterpret Wing Chun through the short film 'Be Spring'. It's a concept that resonates deeply with me. Having our own internal spring all year round is our superpower.\"\n\nLululemon Athletica Inc announced a 53% growth in its revenues on the Chinese market during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, demonstrating its robust performance, driven by store results and strong relationships with local communities. In the recently announced financial results for Q3, Lululemon revealed a 19% increase in net revenue, reaching $2.2 billion, accompanied by a 21% rise in gross profits, which amounted to $1.3 billion.\n\nAurélien Sostaponti highlights the keen Chinese interest in immersive and interactive experiences\n\nthat make an artwork more unique, which helps increase the consumption of cultural content. He discusses the projects in China by the Japanese company Team Lab., known for their innovative use of digital technology to create dynamic and interactive art installations that transform spaces into vivid, immersive environments. These exhibitions often blend art, science, technology, and nature, attracting a wide audience and enhancing engagement with the art through direct interaction.\n\nIn this context, we can mention some major Chinese museums and immersive exhibitions, including notable venues such as the \"Palace above the Water\" in Shanghai, the 4D Space in Hangzhou, the \"Spaceship\" in Changzhou, and the live RPG experience in Nanjing. Thanks to Arnold Ma for highlighting these innovative cultural spaces that showcase the Chinese appetite for immersive and interactive environments. These venues utilize advanced technology to create dynamic and engaging experiences that blend traditional cultural elements with modern digital innovations, appealing to both domestic and international audiences.\n\nVirtually Versailles An augmented reality exhibition will be presented in Hangzhou, China, from May 2 to October 8, 2024, at the Winland Center. Following the success of \"Virtually Versailles\" in Macao and Hong Kong, which attracted nearly 150,000 visitors, the Palace of Versailles continues the touring of this immersive exhibition. It allows visitors to explore the universe of Versailles using innovative technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, connected bicycles, and 360-degree projections. This exhibition showcases how historical and cultural heritage can be rendered through modern technology, offering a unique and engaging way for visitors to experience the grandeur and history of Versailles.\n\n\"Notre-Dame de Paris: The Augmented Exhibition\"\n\nThe exhibition will be presented on the occasion of the reopening of Notre-Dame de Paris to the public in 2024. Combining physical scenography and augmented reality, the exhibition will allow visitors to discover the 850-year history of the eternal cathedral through an immersive journey.\n\nVideo Games (668 million users in China)\n\nVideo games are a significant sector for AI, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), blockchain, and cloud computing, technologies that enable the creation of more immersive and realistic video game experiences. Notable examples include partnerships between Tencent, China's #1 video game company, with Ubisoft and Unreal Engine. These collaborations harness advanced technologies to enhance gameplay and graphics, pushing the boundaries of what video games can offer to players.\n\nUnity Software Inc, the American developer whose software is used in video games like Tencent Games ,' \"Honor of Kings,\" has established a joint venture in China valued at $1 billion, in collaboration with Pinduoduo, Alibaba Group, and G-bits\n\nThe discussion also touches on the successful French model in China, AMI, which boasts 20 stores encouraged by local consumers. AMI recently staged its latest fashion show at the Xiangmen Wall in Suzhou to \"redefine Made in China,\" showcasing its commitment to integrating with and contributing to the local cultural and economic landscape.\n\nIn visual arts,\n\nTimothée Favre discussed how brands are increasingly attempting to establish long-term influence through historical heritage or storytelling capabilities. A brand that can open its doors to Chinese curators or specialists and share its historical archives is in a strong position to attract Chinese consumers. A typical example is Cartier's sponsorship of the \"Versailles and the Forbidden City\" exhibition, which highlights Cartier long-standing presence in China. This approach demonstrates how integrating cultural and historical elements can significantly enhance a brand's appeal in the Chinese market.\n\nPuy du Fou Asia: Joseph Corbo Courtemanche, Eng, MBA showcased another successful example of French Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) in China with Puy du Fou Asia's project, \"Saga : City of lights.\" This immersive show covers 20,000 square meters in an urban setting, utilizing French technologies and long-term partners in China. The project illustrates the effective blending of French cultural entertainment with local partnerships, emphasizing the global appeal and adaptability of French creative expertise in immersive show experiences.\n\nThe current landscape of Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI), immersive experiences, and artificial intelligence (AI) in China is also marked by:\n\nMetaverse-based tourism featuring a digital twin\n\nA digital twin, driven by AI, at the Yingxian Wooden Pagoda in Shanxi, China. This innovative approach utilizes AI to create a virtual replica of the historical site, allowing for virtual tourism experiences that are both immersive and interactive. Thanks to Ashley Dudarenok 艾熙丽 shley Dudarenok for highlighting this development. This technology not only enhances the visitor experience but also opens up new possibilities for preserving and showcasing cultural heritage in the digital age.\n\n熙丽\n\nVidu chinese AI chinoise text to video\n\nShengshu, a company founded in 2023 in Beijing, has unveiled Vidu, a Chinese AI equivalent to the American AI Sora. Vidu is capable of creating realistic videos from simple text input. This advancement reflects significant progress in the field of AI-driven content creation, allowing for efficient and customizable video production. Thanks to @johan digital solutions for sharing this information. This technology represents a transformative step in media production, offering new tools for creators and businesses to engage audiences with high-quality visual content generated from text descriptions.\n\nSince there's significant interest in Sora, here's a demo of how it works:\n\nSora is an advanced AI capable of converting text into realistic video content. To see it in action, you would typically visit the platform's official website or a tech demonstration channel, where they showcase how you can input a piece of text, and the AI processes it to create a corresponding video. The demo might include examples of various scenarios, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the AI in generating diverse and complex video outputs based on textual descriptions. This capability is particularly useful in fields such as education, marketing, and entertainment, where visual content can significantly enhance user engagement and information retention.\n\n2/ Franco-Chinese business cooperation (CIIE, CBE...)\n\n\"The French delegation led by the president of L'Oréal, at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai (CIIE), (which the President of the Republic could attend in 2024 as in 2019) and the presence in China of leading French companies symbolize this economic cooperation between the two countries.\n\nIn this context, Business France is organizing a China 2024 business forum on May 6th in Paris.\"\n\n\"While it was the top destination for French cosmetic brands' exports in 2021, China is now the second-largest export market for French cosmetic products, valued at €1.9 billion, where 25% of lipsticks manufactured in France are exported. \"Export is a considerable asset for the cosmetic industry and for the French economy. China holds a special place for French cosmetics,\" says Emmanuel Guichard, Secretary General of FEBEA. He reiterated this unique position of China for French cosmetics during a recent meeting with Chinese Minister of Commerce, Wang Wentao, organized at the initiative of FEBEA and the France China Committee.\"\n\n\"The French Fragrance & Cosmetics Embassy - @FFCE China\n\n\"France has a very positive international image, and it's important to nurture it, to continue ensuring that France remains the global benchmark when it comes to cosmetics in China or anywhere else,\" Christophe Mass also emphasized.\"\n\nn.\n\n\"Meanwhile, and on the occasion of its 30th anniversary, Cosmetic Valley organized the China Beauty Expo from May 22nd to 24th, 2024, in partnership with Business France, targeting all French companies in the perfume and cosmetics industry as part of the France Export Program in China.\n\nThe 4th Franco-Chinese Cross-Border E-commerce Forum will take place in Paris on May 31st.\"\n\n\"Next Made in France offers French cosmetic SMEs a 'Learning Expedition' to Shanghai, eligible for Bpifrance's Prospecting Insurance: Explore and Pitch.\"\n\nInformation about this mission: Business immersion mission in Chinese beauty tech in Shanghai from May 20th to 25th, 2024, organized by NMIF.\n\nDeadline for response: May 10th.

Emmanuel Macron will indeed welcome his Chinese counterpart in the Hautes-Pyrénées, a department where the French president has strong family ties. It reflects a highly personal diplomacy in the continuity of Franco-Chinese relations.\n\nIndeed, this trip to Occitania is a way for Emmanuel Macron to reciprocate Xi Jinping's personal gesture in official relations back in April 2023. The French president had been invited to a tea ceremony at the governor's palace in Guangdong Province, Canton, where Xi Jinping's father resided. This isn't the first time a \"personal touch\" has colored an official meeting. For instance, in 1999, Jiang Zemin (Chinese president from 1993 to 2003) was welcomed at Château de Bity, owned by Jacques and Bernadette Chirac in Corrèze.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics: A Catalyst for Chinese Tourism in France?\n\nThe Franco-Chinese Exchange Committee (CEFC) organized a conference on April 29th. Amelie LANDMANN, Ada XU, Pascal Gentil, SU-PELLEMELE, and Xiao-Qing were among the speakers.\n\nWhile Fliggy (飞猪) and Choose Paris Region launched the Paris Region Pass and an online Chinese customer service center in 2023 to enhance the travel experience, particularly for Chinese tourists, Ada XU highlighted the importance of welcoming Chinese tourists, especially during the Olympics. Atout France - The France Tourism Development Agency launched a campaign in this context.\n\nIn response to the Chinese affinity for sports such as badminton, basketball, and football, sports tourism holds significant importance in China. An international competition can serve as a trigger for travel, especially for fan clubs of Chinese athletes, such as in badminton. Pascal Gentil discussed sports diplomacy and the patriotism of athletes in promoting sports tourism, citing examples like the French football trophy champions' event in Shenzhen.\n\nAda Xu noted that while outbound tourism from China has resumed for destinations within a 4-hour flight radius, this isn't yet the case for Europe. She emphasized that the Olympics mark the first significant event for Chinese tourism in France since the pandemic.\n\nLinda Ho Capelle from DFS Group Limited Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf highlighted the evolving nature of Chinese tourists, comparing those of 2024 to 2023. She suggested that using 2019 arrival figures (-58% compared to 2019) to forecast visitation isn't relevant and proposed starting from 2022 figures instead.\n\nHo Capelle stressed the importance of adapting to tourists, emphasizing that attitude and hospitality are crucial, regardless of Mandarin proficiency. She highlighted Samaritaine's adeptness in this regard, citing the successful Jay Chou promotion in July 2022, which significantly boosted Samaritaine's visibility in China.\n\nXXX\n\nIn China, the Ministry of Tourism and Culture are merged into one entity.\n\nIf culture is the cornerstone of Sino-French cooperation, as evidenced by the numerous projects implemented or accelerated for the 60th anniversary celebrations, this could have a favorable effect on Chinese tourism in France and accelerate its recovery.\n\nMoreover, the growing interest of Chinese consumers in video games (668 million users) and immersive, interactive tourism aligns with the offerings of ICCs (Cultural and Creative Industries) in immersive and interactive experiences, particularly in the tourism sector. Collaborations such as Ubisoft's partnership with Tencent, the City of Lights saga at Puy du Fou China, or Virtually Shanghai illustrate Sino-French cooperation in digital ICCs applied to tourism.\n\nAt the heart of this cultural and tourism cooperation lies a long-standing presence in China and consideration of contemporary Chinese and French cultural specificities in the post-Covid era. Leveraging its long-standing presence in China, Cartier sponsors the exhibition between the Palace of Versailles and the Forbidden City, while Louis Vuitton continues to choose contemporary Chinese ambassadors. Samaritaine has also increased its visibility in China through its association with Jay Chou.\n\nThis underscores the role of French luxury in promoting and exporting French culture and, consequently, the image of France and its destinations in China.\n\nCould these cultural collaborations around digital and economic ICCs, accelerated by the 60th anniversary and by commercial and sports cooperation during the Olympics, result in France regaining its position as the top European tourist destination for Chinese tourists?\n\nIs 2024 also the Franco-Chinese year of cultural tourism?"
