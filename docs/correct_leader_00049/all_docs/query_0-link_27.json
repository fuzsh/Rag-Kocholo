        "text": "Mr Putin said that political partnership provided a good basis for the development of economic contacts. He stressed that direct inter-regional links were a major reserve for increasing economic cooperation and reassured that Russia would provide them full support. He highlighted positive examples and interesting plans in this sphere—in particular, a visit of French entrepreneurs to the Siberian Federal District, due within the year.\n\nThe meeting at the Hotel de Matignon was followed by a lunch on Mr Raffarin’s behalf, attended by members of the Russian delegation and of the French Cabinet."
