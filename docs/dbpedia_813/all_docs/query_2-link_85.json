        "text": "Miss USA 1988, the 37th Miss USA pageant, was televised live from the El Paso Civic Center in El Paso, Texas on March 1, 1988. At the conclusion of the final competition, Courtney Gibbs of Texas was crowned Miss USA, becoming the fourth consecutive winner from Texas.\n\nThe pageant was hosted by Alan Thicke, and the pageant commentator was Tracy Scoggins fresh after covering the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary which is aired on UBC along with Miss Canada 1981 Dominique Dufour. Bob Barker, an animal rights activist who was supposed to host this year's Miss USA Pageant, refused to be involved because one of the winner's prizes was a fur coat. There had been controversy surrounding the fur coats since the previous year, and Barker claimed he had asked pageant officials not to give away coats for years but that he had been ignored. Other animal rights activists threatened to picket the pageant in protest at its fur policy and disrupted a pre-pageant press conference.\n\nThis was the first time that the pageant was held in Texas and the only time it was ever held in El Paso. El Paso had hosted the Miss Teen USA 1987 pageant the previous year, and it was announced in November 1987 that the city would likely host Miss USA 1988.\n\nResults\n\nPlacements\n\nFinal Results Contestant Miss USA 1988\n\nTexas - Courtney Gibbs\n\n1st runner-up\n\nMiss World USA 1988\n\nCalifornia - Diana Magaña\n\n2nd runner-up\n\nGeorgia - Donna Rampy\n\n3rd runner-up\n\nFlorida - Monica Farrell\n\n4th runner-up\n\nMississippi - Dana Richmond\n\nTop 10\n\nOklahoma - Tamara Walker\n\nIllinois - Gina Zordani\n\nTennessee - Stephanie Potts\n\nMaryland - Rowanne Brewer\n\nSouth Carolina - April Abel\n\nSpecial awards\n\nAward Contestant Miss Congeniality\n\nDistrict of Columbia - Elva Anderson\n\nMiss Photogenic\n\nMaryland - Rowanne Brewer\n\nBest State Costume\n\nNevada - Lagracella Omran\n\nFinal competition\n\nPreliminary swimsuit scores\n\nThe following is the contestants average scores in the Preliminary swimsuit competition.\n\nDelegates and Troupe\n\nThe Miss USA 1988 delegates were:\n\nAlabama - Rhonda Mooney\n\nAlaska - Raun Reaves\n\nArizona - Kris Keim\n\nArkansas - Melissa Staples\n\nCalifornia - Diana Magaña\n\nColorado - Nicola Svaldi\n\nConnecticut - Catherine Calasso\n\nDelaware - Christina lee Angel\n\nDistrict of Columbia - Elva Anderson\n\nFlorida - Monica Farrell\n\nGeorgia - Donna Rampy\n\nHawaii - Paula Prevost\n\nIdaho - Kay Kinsey\n\nIllinois - Gina Zordani\n\nIndiana - Loetta Earnest\n\nIowa - Julie Kemmerling\n\nKansas - Cynthia Decker\n\nKentucky - Suzanne Pitman\n\nLouisiana - Rhonda Vinson\n\nMaine - Suzanne Grenier\n\nMaryland - Rowanne Brewer\n\nMassachusetts - Ania Lovely\n\nMichigan - Anthonia Dotson\n\nMinnesota - Julie Nelson\n\nMississippi - Dana Richmond\n\nMissouri - Alecia Workman\n\nMontana - Kimberly Topp\n\nNebraska - Kellie O'Neil\n\nNevada - Lagracella Omran\n\nNew Hampshire - Diane Wright\n\nNew Jersey - Colleen Carlone\n\nNew Mexico - Stephanie Storrie\n\nNew York - Linnea Mancini\n\nNorth Carolina - Tammy Tolar\n\nNorth Dakota - Kate Sevde\n\nOhio - Gina West\n\nOklahoma - Tamara Walker\n\nOregon - Elaine Rohrer\n\nPennsylvania - Susan Gray\n\nRhode Island - Cindy Geronda\n\nSouth Carolina - April Abel\n\nSouth Dakota - Sandi Fix\n\nTennessee - Stephanie Potts\n\nTexas - Courtney Gibbs\n\nUtah - Suzie Lundell\n\nVermont - Stacy Sisson\n\nVirginia - Denise Smith\n\nWashington - Sandra Kord\n\nWest Virginia - Cathy Fowler\n\nWisconsin - Mary Kay Anderson\n\nWyoming - Kristen Youmans\n\nAs for the Troupe many of the Miss Teen USA Contestants from 1987 including Kristi Addis (who was crowned Miss Teen USA which took place in July of last year in El Paso) were here along with Bobbie Brown (1st Runner Up in that Pageant) as well as Miss Texas Teen USA 1987 Richelle Kesling and several 1988 Miss Teen USA Contestants are involved in the troupe as well including 1988 Miss Texas Teen USA Libby Pelton as well as Miss Texas Teen USA 1985 Konae Wehle in addition a handful of Several Contestants who had competed in State Pageants were involved including some that went on to win their that State Title before Competing at Miss USA which include:\n\nChristina Faust (2nd Runneer Up at Miss California USA 1988, Miss California USA 1989)\n\nLeeAnne Locken (3rd Runner Up at Miss Texas USA 1988, Miss Arizona USA 1989)\n\nGretchen Polhemus (2nd Runner Up at Miss Texas USA 1988, Miss Texas USA 1989, Miss USA 1989)\n\nMelissa Proctor (Non-Finalist at Miss Texas USA 1988, Miss Ohio USA 1990)\n\nMaya Walker (Miss Colorado 1988, 1st Runner Up at Miss America 1989, Miss Oklahoma USA 1992)\n\nHowever a Handful of Dream Girl USA Contestants were apart of the Troupe despite of appearing on Dream Girl USA Finals in 1987 including Walker, Mondana Tehrani, Therese Kablan (who went be a Spokesmodel on Star Search), LeAnna Grant (Miss Nevada USA 1986), Frances Frazier (Miss Georgia 1988) and Desiree Daniels (Miss Tennessee USA 1984, 2nd Runner Up at Miss USA) as well as Dream Girl USA 1987, Ursula Lawson.\n\nContestant notes\n\nTwo contestants had previously competed in the Miss Teen USA pageant.
