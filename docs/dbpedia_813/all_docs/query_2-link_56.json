        "text": "Congratulations to Miss Teen USA 2008, Stevi Perry of Arkansas! I'm quite happy with this win as Stevi is a lovely girl and will do a fine job as the new titleholder. The results were such a tease for me. Arkansas was right at the bottom of my top 15 predictions list strangely enough and my winner and 1st runner up ended up placing 2nd and 3rd. Such a tease!!! Even though I judged based on a few pictures of the delegates, I actually did a decent job with my predictions this year as I got 9 of the 15 semifinalists and 2 alternates. The 4 semifinalists that weren't in my list were Alabama, Idaho, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, although after seeing Pennsylvania's gown, I regretted not including her in my list. There will be more commentary in days to come."
