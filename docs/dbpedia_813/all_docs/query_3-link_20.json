        "text": "The first black Miss USA says she's not a \"stereotypical all-American winner,\" and being raised by a single parent on tough streets is a handicap that can be overcome. \"I had not the happiest of upbringings, but you don't have to become a statistic just because you grew up in a broken home,\" 20-year-old Carole Gist told reporters Monday in New York.\n\nMiss Gist, of Detroit, was chosen Friday from among 51 women competing for $200,000 in cash and prizes and the chance to represent the United States in the 38th annual Miss Universe pageant.\n\nA junior in management and marketing at the Northwood Institute, she said being black helped her \"stand out over all the blond, blue-eyed women there.\"\n\nBut she said it was likely she was much different in other ways, too.\n\nReared by her mother, she moved often and sometimes lived in rough neighborhoods.\n\n\"My home was broken into a lot,\" she said. \"When I was 5, I remember seeing a burglar in my home, and I was frightened to death.\"\n\nHoagy's helper\n\nsurfaces in Indiana\n\nMost people won't recognize her name, but Helen Stearns collaborated on several songs with her brother-in-law.\n\nThe brother-in-law was Hoagy Carmichael,who composed such songs as Star Dust and Georgia on My Mind. He died in 1981.\n\n\"I loved to listen to him play,\" Stearns said. \"He'd be sitting there pecking around on the piano, and he'd come up with a tune and say, \"You're the writer. Give me some words.' So I did sometimes. We wrote a lot of songs together, mostly children's songs.\"\n\nApril in My Heart was one of their best.\n\n\"I didn't think much about it at the time, but I still get small royalty checks for it from time to time,\" she said.\n\nStearns, 82, was in Indianapolis over the weekend in conjunction with a retrospective concert by the Indiana Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAnd the big winner\n\nis ... Bob Hope!\n\nBob Hope was unable to attend a charity event whose host was Jimmy Stewartso he bought five raffle tickets at $1,000 apiece to help out. He pulled the grand prize, including a luxury car.\n\n\"Isn't that amazing? I never win a thing,\" Hope said from his Palm Springs, Calif., home Monday, a day after learning he had won a $50,000 BMW, a set of luggage and a trip to Germany.\n\nIt would seem the globe-trotting entertainer wouldn't need luggage or a free trip to Munich. He's made dozens of overseas trips to entertain U.S. troops.\n\n\"You think you're kidding, don't you? I can use the luggage,\" Hope said.\n\nAsked what he would do with the car, Hope said: \"I don't know.\"\n\nEt cetera ...\n\nJennifer Johnson of Edmond, Okla., was crowned Mrs. America on Monday at Las Vegas, Nev. Johnson, 28, topped 49 other contestants to win the Mrs. America crown and an assortment of prizes. She is the wife of a lawyer and the mother of a 2-year-old and an 8-month-old. First runner-up was Lou Ann Ritchie of Wichita, Kan.\n\nStormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, remained in fair condition Monday two weeks after her second liver transplant. Doctors said the 12-year-old girl's condition was upgraded from serious to fair Sunday at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh."
