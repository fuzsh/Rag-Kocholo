Miss USA and Miss Colombia took runner-up honors.\n\nMona Grudt, affectionately nicknamed the \"beauty queen from Hell\" for the name of her Norwegian hometown, took the top spot over 70 other contestants in the 1990 pageant at the Shubert Theater in Century City.\n\nJudges chose Carole Gist, a 20-year-old student from Detroit representing the United States, as first runner-up and Liseth Mahecha of Colombia second runner-up.\n\nThe global glamour parade featured a first-ever entry from the Soviet Union and a prize package to the winner worth $220,000.\n\nLast year's event was staged in Cancun, Mexico, where Miss Holland, Angela Visser, became Miss Universe 1989.\n\nTwo non-finalists in this year's pageant hail from the same town in the Soviet Union. Miss USSR, Evia Stalbovska, and Miss Israel, Yvonna Krugliak, are from the city of Liepaja on the Baltic Sea.\n\nby CNB"
