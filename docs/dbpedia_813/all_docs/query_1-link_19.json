        "text": "Miss USA 2023 Noelia Voigt and Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava resigned within two days of each other\n\nMiss USA 2023 Noelia Voigt and Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava this week both made surprise resignation announcements within days of each other.\n\nCiting her mental health, Voigt, 24, announced her decision in an Instagram post on Monday, May 6, writing: \"I realize this may come as a large shock to many. Never compromise your physical and mental well-being.\"\n\n\"In life, I strongly value the importance of making decisions that feel best for you and your mental health,\" she wrote. \"My journey as Miss USA has been incredibly meaningful, representing Utah with pride, and later the USA at Miss Universe. Sadly, I have made the very tough decision to resign from the title of Miss USA 2023.\"\n\nMany on social media, including on TikTok, commented on or reacted to Voigt's post to note that the first letter of each sentence in her statement ‚Äî except for the last three sentences ‚Äî appeared to form their own message: \"I AM SILENCED.\"\n\nRelated: Before Miss USA Resignations, Ex-Employee Spoke Out About Alleged 'Toxicity' and 'Bullying' at the Organization\n\nIt remains unclear if that message was on purpose, and Vogt hasn't said.\n\nThe Miss USA organization previously issued a statement thanking Voigt for her service, saying that it respects and supports \"Noelia‚Äôs decision to step down from her duties.\"\n\nNever miss a story ‚Äî sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThen, just two days later, Srivastava announced her own resignation in a post on Instagram, writing that her ‚Äúpersonal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAfter months of grappling with this decision, I have made the choice to resign from the title of Miss Teen USA 2023,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúI am grateful for all the support from my family, my state directors, my sister queens, and the fans who have cheered me on since I won my state title. I will always look back on my time as Miss NJ Teen USA fondly, and the experience of representing my state as a first generation, Mexican-Indian American at the national level was fulfilling in itself.‚Äù\n\nRelated: Why Are Miss USA and Miss Teen USA Stepping Down? Everything to Know About Their Resignations\n\nShortly after Srivastava's post, the Miss Teen USA organization wished the high school junior well in a post on Instagram and noted that a new title-holder would be announced soon.\n\n‚ÄúUmaSofia, we are wishing you all the best.‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you for your service as Miss Teen USA. üëë ,\" the organization wrote. \"We respect and support UmaSofia‚Äôs decision to step down from her duties. The well-being of our titleholders is a top priority. We are currently reviewing plans for the transition of responsibilities to a successor, and we will soon announce the crowning of the new Miss Teen USA.‚Äù\n\nRelated: Gracie Hunt, Daughter of Billionaire KC Chiefs Owner, Competes at Miss USA 28 Years After Her Mom\n\nHours after the teen made her announcement, she appeared at a philanthropic event and told PEOPLE that her resignation was \"definitely not my first choice.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I can't say much more at this time. But I would like to say that it's a decision that took a lot of careful thinking ‚Äî and ultimately, I'm excited to see what's next,\" Srivastava said at the 25th anniversary gala for Smile Train, which supports free cleft palate surgery for millions of children around the world.\n\n\"I'm a junior in high school and I'm gonna be applying to colleges,\" Srivastava told PEOPLE. \"So I'm excited to explore my future and find what makes me [me] again.\"\n\nVoigt was also in attendance at the event on Wednesday and was seen in close conversation with Srivastava and others at one point.\n\nThe 24-year-old woman was among the first to comment on Srivastava‚Äôs resignation post.\n\n‚ÄúI LOVE YOU! So proud of you my angel,‚Äù she wrote.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
