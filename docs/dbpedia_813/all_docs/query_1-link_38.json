        "text": "Preliminaries are on Thursday, May 17 at 5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time being webcast on www.missuniverse.com/missusa through a live YouTube stream when we will see all 51 contestants compete in swimsuit and gown and then the 2018 Miss USA pageant will air on FOX on Monday, May 21 at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time live from the Hirsch Coliseum in Shreveport, Louisiana hosted by Nick and Vanessa Lachey. It's very important to spread the word and get people to watch Miss USA on FOX this year as there is some heavy competition on all the major networks at the same time that Miss USA is airing. ABC is airing finales for 'Dancing With the Stars' and 'American Idol'. NBC is airing the finale of 'The Voice' but CBS is airing repeats of 'The Big Bang Theory' so I'm concerned about the TV ratings for Miss USA this year.\n\nThe number of semifinalists has been increased to a top 15 compared to last year when there was only a top 10. The length of the pageant is still a 2 hour telecast as it was last year. A 3 hour telecast was done for 2014 to 2016. It seems like the IMG era of Miss USA which started in 2016 seems to have more emphasis on interview and unique accomplishments first before body or beauty and a lot of delegates have a background story so like always, surprises are to be expected.\n\nI will be posting my final predictions for Miss USA 2018 on May 20 but in the meantime, I will be posting my present thoughts on each delegate.\n\nAgain, the preliminaries are on the evening of Thursday, May 17, at 5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time webcasted on www.missuniverse.com/missusa via a YouTube stream. I will post my final predictions for Miss USA 2018 on May 20 and then May 21 is the night of the finals airing on FOX at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time so we shall see who will be queen for 2018!\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nFIRST ROUND PRETHOUGHTS (May 7, 2018)\n\nShe blinded us with science and combined the right chemicals to create the reaction resulting in Kára Deidra McCullough winning the Miss USA crown for 2017 and now she will soon be passing on the Miss USA crown to her successor. Who from the class of 2018 is that uniquely accomplished woman of distinction who will impress the judges enough to earn the title of Miss USA 2018? The delegates are arriving in Shreveport, Louisiana. Shreveport last hosted Miss USA 20 years ago in 1998 when Massachusetts Shawnae Jebbia won the crown and Shreveport also hosted Miss Teen USA in the year 2000. The 67th annual Miss USA pageant will once again be held in Shreveports Hirsch Coliseum. Louisiana also hosted the 2014 and the turbulent 2015 Miss USA pageants but in the city of Baton Rouge. Returning to serve as background commentators are Carson Kressley and Lu Sierra returning to perform these positions as they did at Miss Universe 2017. The hosts for this years Miss USA competition will be some familiar faces: Miss Teen USA 1998, Vanessa Lachey (who also won her title in Shreveport) along with her husband, Nick Lachey of 98 Degrees (who also performed at the 2000 Miss Teen USA pageant in Shreveport) so this years pageant is really coming full circle and Vanessa and Nick also recently competed in the 2017 edition of Dancing With the Stars and speaking of Dancing With the Stars, the finale of the current accelerated Athletes edition is airing on the same date of May 21 on ABC as well as the finale of American Idol so there is some major television ratings competition for Miss USA airing on FOX this year and it has me very concerned and really wishing a different date had been chosen because ratings have been dipping in recent years and picking the right date could make a huge difference. By the way, Im rooting for Adam Rippon for Dancing With the Stars and I was rooting for Ada Vox for American Idol but she was eliminated so my next pick would be Jurnee but I dont have much hope seeing how the voting is going. The weekend prior to the pageant will also have a lot of major events like the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on May 19 and the Billboard Music Awards on May 20. Anyway, back to Miss USA, there was a recent social media post asking if they should bring back the opening that was done in 1997 and my answer would be a resounding YES! The 1997 Miss USA pageant was also held in Shreveport and as many of you know, 1997 was easily one of my favorite Miss USA parade of states in history as the music with the choir was awesome and innovative. I don't care if Miss Kansas' earring flew off into the audience! You can't beat that level of energy, excitement and high-fashion glamour!\n\nHowever, bearing in mind that the IMG era is turning Miss USA into more of a Miss America-type pageant, I will be more focused on stories, accomplishments and embracing diversity (in terms of body-types and ethnicities) rather than just physical beauty. Here are the first round prethoughts to give you an idea of who I've got my eye on for this year's Miss USA crown! Also included are some other interesting pageant world tidbits.\n\nWe Go Together\n\nLike rama lama lama ka dinga da dinga dong. Remembered forever  For the first time in history, the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants have become concurrent events as they are being held within days of each other in the same venue. The Miss Teen USA finals will be held on May 18 and Miss USA will be held on May 21. This is reminiscent of the early days of the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants as this was also how it was done from 1952 to 1964 and the two pageants really became separate events in 1965. The 1965 Miss USA pageant won by Ohios Sue Ann Downey was held on June 4 of that year and the 1965 Miss Universe pageant won by Thailands Apasra Hongsakula was held on July 24 of that year whereas the 1964 Miss USA pageant won by DCs Bobbi Johnson was held on July 29 of that year and the 1964 Miss Universe pageant won by Greeces Corinna Tsopei was held a few days later on August 1 of that year. With this amalgamation of the sister pageants, the pattern finder in me makes me equate 2018 to 1964 so if were going in reverse, 2019 is 1963, 2020 is 1962 2030 is 1952 which was the debut year of the official Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants which makes me thinks either the pageants could possibly end after 2030 or could the world even end after the 2030 pageants?? But now that Ive pointed it out, it probably wont happen. I do have to say Im surprised this wasnt done sooner as it seems more efficient to get it all done in the one week on one stage and it saves having to search for different venues and dates for each pageant but it could get a little hectic during that week. However, it is good for the host city that will get double the amount of business from families and friends coming to see their loved ones compete. A lot of Teen and Miss pageants are held at the same time so this actually does make sense given the current climate of pageantry. Miss Teen USA hasnt aired on television since 2007. Miss Teen USA started in 1983 and aired on CBS until 2003 when NBC started airing the pageants. The Miss Teen USA pageant has been a webcast since 2008 and it was held in: the Bahamas from 2008 to 2015; in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2016; and Phoenix, Arizona in 2017. Another recent change came with IMGs decision to amalgamate the social media accounts for Miss USA and Miss Teen USA on some major platforms like Facebook and Instagram and with Miss Teen USA eliminating the swimsuit competition like the Miss World pageant has, one can only wonder if this will happen to Miss USA and Miss Universe. Recent years have shown that there is now less emphasis on the body and the physical and more focus on a compelling story and accomplishments combined with interview skills and stage presence. Even though the date change means the reigning Miss Teen USA (Missouris Sophia Dominguez-Heithoff) will only reign for just short of 10 months, the shortest reign in Miss Teen USA history actually belongs to the very first Miss Teen USA (New Yorks Ruth Zakarian) who reigned a little over 7 months from August 30, 1983 to April 3, 1984. The longest reign in Miss Teen USA history belongs to Miss Teen USA 1986 (Oklahomas Allison Brown) who reigned for 18 months from January 21, 1986 to July 21, 1987. We shall see how this historical change works out! Theyll always be together. Always be together. Ooh-ee-ooh-ah-ah-ting-tang-walla-walla-bing-bang!\n\nIn the Beginning, There Was Genesis!\n\nAnd God said, Let Genesis have a second win of the Miss Florida USA crown. And it was so and God saw that it was good... Perhaps one of the biggest comebacks in state pageant history would have to be that of Floridas representative Genesis Davila. Genesis originally won the 2017 Miss Florida USA pageant but was dethroned shortly after when it was alleged that she had used professional stylists which was against pageant rules. This resulted in a beauty pageant turned ugly and a lawsuit that was later settled but Genesis didnt compete for the 2017 Miss USA crown and runner-up Linette de los Santos competed instead but didnt place at Miss USA. The Gravitt family had been directing the Miss Florida USA literally for decades but the franchise was taken away from them and obtained by the Chrisley family known from the reality show Chrisley Knows Best and patriarch Todd Chrisleys daughter Savannah was Miss Tennessee Teen USA 2016 and a top 15 semifinalist at Miss Teen USA 2016. The Chrisley family recently also obtained the Miss California USA franchise as well. Under the new management, Genesis Davila decided to compete for the 2018 Miss Florida USA crown and she won it again! Now, Genesis is finally getting her chance to fulfill a hard sought after dream to compete at Miss USA. Persistent and perseverant, Genesis Davila has competed in many pageants. Genesis was 1st runner up to Miss Universe Puerto Rico 2013, Monic Perez. Genesis would compete at Miss Intercontinental 2012 and finished as 1st runner up and then she won Miss Puerto Rico World and competed at Miss World 2014 where she went unplaced. Genesis also entered for the Miss 52 USA title which was only held for 2016 but she wasn't selected among the final 10 for that competition and was therefore eliminated. Genesis is also passionate about fundraising for her native Puerto Rico which is still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. I liken Genesis situation to that of Indias Urvashi Rautela who won the Miss India Universe title twice. Urvashis first win was in 2012 but she was found to be shortly underaged so her title was given to runner-up Shilpa Singh who placed among the top 16 of Miss Universe 2012. Urvashi would then return to win the 2015 Miss India Universe title but would go unplaced at Miss Universe 2015. Will something similar happen to Genesis? Will she go unplaced at Miss USA or will she place somewhere among the semifinalists or will Genesis make this comeback even more epic and finally become the first Floridian representative to win the Miss USA crown outright? Floridas only Miss USA crown was obtained in 1967 when the 2nd runner up at the 1967 Miss USA pageant, Floridas Cheryl Ann Patton, inherited the crown after the original winner, Alabamas Sylvia Hitchcock went on to win Miss Universe 1967 and 1st runner up, Californias Susan Bradley declined to take the crown. Even though Florida has hosted multiple Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss Universe pageants, the Sunshine state has never officially won the Miss USA crown so will the Revelation of the Miss USA 2018 be Genesis taking it all? To further add to this intriguing development, there will be two delegates named Genesis competing at Miss USA 2018. New Yorks Genesis Suero was born in the Dominican Republic and with a very similar ethnic background to Floridas Genesis Davila, will this become a showdown of biblical proportions and become like a Sega Genesis video game as the bout to knock the other Genesis out?? New York hasnt won the Miss USA crown since 1999 so is it time for a comeback for the Big Apple?\n\nA Bill of Health From CO-CA CO-LA?\n\nOkay, so obviously this headline needs some decoding so it relates to Californias representative, Kelley Johnson, who should be a familiar face. Kelley first made waves in the pageant world competing as Miss Colorado for Miss America 2016 where she dared to be different. Miss America has a talent competition and traditionally, the contestants perform some form of artistic or athletic talents but Kelley was unique and innovative in simply performing an emotional monologue about her not-so-glamourous profession of being a nurse working with a patient with Alzheimers disease. During the round of judges questions, Kevin OLeary asked that familiar question that made it rounds in pageantry that year which asked which woman should be the first to appear on the American 10 dollar bill. This question was first posed at the 2015 Miss USA pageant and the winner of that pageant, Oklahomas Olivia Jordan responded with what would become the correct response (Harriet Tubman) and later that year at Miss Teen USA, eventual winner, Louisianas Katherine Haik gave Rosa Parks as her answer. At Miss America 2016, Kelley Johnson responded that Ellen Degeneres should be that woman which prompted immediate praise from Ellen and even led to an appearance on her show where she received $10,000 from Shutterfly for nurse anesthetist school. Kelley also made the media rounds appearing on many other talk shows discussing her performance at Miss America and its huge impact. Kelley would finish as 2nd runner up at the 2016 Miss America pageant won by Georgias Betty Cantrell. Kelley would later statehop to California and would go on to win the traditionally competitive Miss California USA pageant and now here we are with Kelley having another shot at winning a major national title, Miss USA. Californias last Miss USA was Alyssa Campanella in 2011 who also statehopped from New Jersey and won the Miss California USA title. So to interpret this headline, A Bill of Health From CO-CA CO-LA. The bill refers to the $10 bill she discussed at Miss America, Health refers to her nursing profession, CO-CA refers to her statehop from Colorado (CO) to California (CA) and CO-LA refers to coming from Colorado (CO) to compete for Miss USA in Louisiana (LA)! Kelley has a very strong chance of winning Miss USA but even if she doesnt, she is expected to have a strong placement. California has won the Miss USA crown six times and places quite frequently also. They longest period that the most populated state didnt place at Miss USA was only a 4 year span from 1994 to 1997.\n\nNevada, Ooh Na Na\n\nHalf of My Heart is in Nevada, Ooh Na Na\n\nAnd although it works with the lyrics, I say half of my heart because Nevadas representative Carolina Urrea also statehopped after competing in California for a few years. Such was also the case of Miss USA 2014, Nevadas Nia Sanchez so will Carolina repeat Nias feat? Carolina was 4th runner up at the 2016 Miss California USA pageant and a semifinalist at the 2017 Miss California USA pageant. A lot of recent success stories have also competed at Miss California USA. As mentioned previously, California won the crown in 2011 thanks to Alyssa Campanella and then in 2012. Marylands Nana Meriwether inherited the Miss USA crown for 2012 after Rhode Islands Olivia Culpo won Miss Universe 2012 and Nana was also 1st runner up at Miss California USA 2010. Of course, Nevadas Nia Sanchez was 2nd runner up at Miss California USA 2010 before winning the 2014 Miss USA title and Oklahomas Olivia Jordan was 1st runner up at Miss California USA 2013 before winning the 2015 Miss USA crown. Carolina fits the diversity bill as she is of Colombian and Mexican descent. Carolina enjoys nature and also has a story of once suffering from homelessness which is why she supports the Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth and hopes to inspire people to achieve the American dream. She also works as a model and raises three rescued animals. Carolina has also competed in past editions of the reality competition Nuestra Belleza Latina. Nevada hasnt placed since 2015 even though they hosted the last two Miss USA pageants so is it time for a return and could Carolina bring them back in a big way?? Another Miss USA 2018 delegate who has competed in California is Oregons Toneata Morgan who was a semifinalist at Miss California USA 2017 and has also competed in Miss California Teen USA 4 times obtaining a 2nd runner up position in 2012. Both Carolina and Toneata have represented Malibu in California pageants. Toneata works as a model and actress and is an entrepreneur who designs for her active-wear company, All Legs. Oregon doesnt place that often and their most recent placement was back in 2004 so will experienced Toneata be able to turn that around?\n\nMothers Be Good To Your Daughters\n\nYou all know how much I love a good legacy story. Well, Tennessees Alexandra Harper is the daughter of Miss Tennessee USA 1981 and semifinalist at Miss USA 1981, Sharon Steakly. This is the first such instance of a dual mother-daughter win in Tennessee but Tucker Perry, Miss Tennessee USA 2010 is the daughter of Kathi Tucker, Miss Washington USA 1983 and both Tucker and Kathi placed in the semifinals of their respective Miss USA pageants. Some other notable mother-daughter duos include: North Carolinas Kristen Dalton, Miss USA 2009 who is the daughter of Jeannine Boger who represented North Carolina at Miss USA 1982 but went unplaced and just last year, Utahs Baylee Jensen competed for Miss USA 2017 but went unplaced and Baylee is the daughter of Texas Gretchen Polhemus, Miss USA 1989. So far, Baylee is the only daughter of a former Miss USA winner to compete at Miss USA. Alexandra stands at 6 feet tall and she has media experience already as she works on the show Music City on CMT and she is a graduate of the University of Tennessee who runs a fashion and beauty website aliandthings.com and her platform involves combatting against hunger with the Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee. The volunteer state traditionally has excellent showings at Miss USA and Alexandra hopes to surpass her mothers achievement and possibly go all the way and get a third Miss USA crown for Tennessee succeeding their previous wins of Lynnette Cole in 2000 and Rachel Smith in 2007 and Tennessee did place in the top 10 last year thanks to Allee-Sutton Hethcoat so lets see if Alexandra can keep it going.\n\nA Capital Hat Trick?\n\nThe nations capital of the District of Columbia has captured the last two Miss USA titles thanks to Deshauna Barber and Kára McCullough. Now, DC is sending Bryce Armstrong who hopes to pull off the elusive three-peat which no state apart from Texas has achieved at Miss USA. Texas did the impossible and won Miss USA 5 years in a row from 1985 to 1989 but no other state has won more than twice in a row. Virginia won in 1969 and 1970 and Illinois won in 1973 and 1974. At Miss America, a three-peat has recently been achieved by New York winning from 2013 to 2015 so can Bryce do it for DC at Miss USA? Will it be thrice for Bryce??? Bryce has her own business which involves baking and decorating desserts for various special events throughout D.C. and it evolved out of her passion for baking. She also volunteers for an organization called SOME (So Others Might Eat) which seeks to combat homelessness in her area. Since Texas has achieved more than three years in a row and is comfortably the most successful state at Miss USA, we should definitely mention this years representative of the Lonestar state, Logan Lester who hopes to make a comeback for Texas after a rare exclusion from the semifinals for the last two years. If you can believe it, Texas has never missed the semifinals for more than two years in a row in the history of Miss USA so if Logan Lester doesnt place, it will be a negative historical achievement for Texas as it would be the first time Texas missed the semifinals three years in a row. Logan is an established realtor at her young age and prides herself in having completed high school in three years and graduating college by the age of 21. Will these accomplishments bring Texas back to the semifinals in a big way?\n\nThe Queen Bee is the Bees Knees\n\nOhio sends us a promising contender that has really caught my attention as she seems to be right in step with the IMG era of pageantry and I've seen some brilliant quotes come from her so she is definitely a crown contender. Deneen Penn is a beekeeper which is unique and visual accomplishment in itself and her beekeeping skills have turned her into a young entrepreneur starting her own company called Queen Bee Honey which allows her to produce and sell organic honey which in turn prompted her to establish an organization called the Worker Bee which helps young entrepreneurs develop the skills to start their own businesses. Ohio has won the Miss USA crown twice in the years of 1965 thanks to Sue Ann Downey and in 1981 thanks to Kim Seelbreede and let us not forget the most popular Buckeye state representative to compete at Miss USA, Academy Award winning actress, Halle Berry, who was 1st runner up at Miss USA in 1986. Deneen is also quite the scholastic as she is an MBA Candidate and also holds a Bachelor of Architecture degree and she also has previous pageant experience as well as she also won the Miss Ohio Collegiate America title for 2017. Will Deneen do as Muhammad Ali said and float like a butterfly and sting like a bee and capture a third Miss USA crown for Ohio?\n\nIm Feeling So Exotic\n\nIn addition to Nevadas delegate, there is another woman of Colombian descent competing for this years Miss USA crown and that would be Georgias Marianny Egurrola. Marianny was born and raised in Colombia and lived there until the age of 15, moving to the United States in 2007. She holds a degree in International Affairs from the University of Georgia. She also works as an international actress and model. Georgia has placed multiple times as a runner-up over the years but they have yet to win the crown. Georgias highest placement was in 1993 when Erin Nance was 1st runner up to Michigans own Kenya Moore. Will Marianny become Georgias sweetest peach?\n\nMississippis Laine Alden Mansour also fits the diversity bill. This 21 year old Lebanese princess from Tupelo studies Integrated Marketing and Communications at the University of Mississippi and plans to obtain her Law Degree to practice Family Law. Her platform, Going the Extra Mile, allows Laine to speak with youth on her belief that true beauty comes from within. Mississippi has never won the Miss USA crown but their highest placement was as 1st runner up in 2008 thanks to Leah Laviano so will Laines exotic flavor give Mississippi that extra edge and that first Miss USA crown for the Magnolia state?\n\nUtahs Narine Ishhanov is of Armenian descent and she has a look similar to that of a Kardashian or even Miss Universe 2012, Olivia Culpo. Narine is yet another entrepreneur who runs a national trucking transportation company. She plans to continue her studies with a goal of becoming a Doctor of Dental Medicine. Like the reigning Miss USA, Kára McCullough, Narine works to promote STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and is an ambassador for STEM Action Center in Utah, which educates school children about these fields. Utah inherited the crown in 1957 but has only one official Miss USA winner and that was Linda Bement in 1960 who went on to win Miss Universe that year.\n\nRest In Peace, Linda Bement-Miss Universe 1960\n\nLinda Jeanne Bement (November 2, 1941-March 19, 2018) passed away of natural causes at her home in Salt Lake City at the age of 76 and Linda has now become the fifth Miss Universe to enter mortality and the 2nd of the 8 Miss Universe winners that represented the USA to pass away. The first four Miss Universes to leave us were: Swedens Hillevi Rombin Schine (1955) who died in a plane crash in 1996, Spains Amparo Munoz Quesada (1974) who succumbed to brain cancer in 2011, USAs Sylvia Hitchcock Carson (1967) also passed away from cancer in 2015 and later that year, Colombias Luz Marina Zuluaga (1958) passed away while the next Colombian Paulina Vega reigned as Miss Universe. Linda Bement is still the only woman from Utah to outright win the Miss USA crown. Utah's Charlotte Sheffield (who passed away in 2016 so both of Utah's Miss USA titleholders are deceased) was originally the 1st runner up in 1957 but Charlotte would inherit the crown when Marylands Leona Gage was found to be married with children. Linda won her Miss USA crown on July 7, 1960 and only a few days later on July 9, 1960, she would become the third Miss USA to win Miss Universe succeeding South Carolinas Miriam Stevenson in 1954 and Iowas Carol Morris in 1956. In 1962, Linda would marry a multi-millionaire U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racing jockey, Manuel Ycaza who was born in Panama. Manuel and Linda had two children named after them before they divorced in November of 1969. Lindas second marriage was to Rob Sharp which also ended in divorce around 1979. In 1994, during an interview on Inside Edition, Linda displayed some of her artwork and said men were often intimidated to talk to her or date her because of her title and that she had been divorced 15 years and wouldnt mind having a partner for life. In 1996, Harry Smith interviewed Linda Bement on CBS This Morning where Linda said she entered the pageants as a business with the goal of getting more money for education and also talked about showcasing more of her artwork of wildlife in the Petersen Art Gallery in Utah. May Linda rest in peace.\n\nOn May 14, I will post a second round of prethoughts with comments on each of the 51 delegates competing for Miss USA 2018 and then after observing the preliminaries (being shown on missusa.com or their social media channels on May 17 at 5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time), I will post my final predictions on May 20 and then the big night is May 21 when the new Miss USA is chosen. Who will be the chosen one?\n\nWatch Miss USA 2018 on Monday, May 21 on FOX!\n\nBACK TO FRONT PAGE"
