        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe Miss USA pageant makes a notable comeback this Sunday after a period of controversy. In May, former Miss USA Noelia Voigt, representing Utah, resigned and accused Laylah Rose, the president and CEO, of fostering a toxic work environment.\n\nThe Miss USA pageant makes a significant return this Sunday, following a tumultuous period marked by controversy. In May, former Miss USA Noelia Voigt, representing Utah, resigned and leveled accusations against Laylah Rose, the president and CEO, alleging a toxic work environment. Despite these allegations, Rose continues to lead the organization. As preparations for one of the nation’s longest-standing beauty pageants end , a new Miss USA will be crowned.\n\nLeadership Under Scrutiny\n\nLaylah Rose, in a statement to Yahoo Entertainment, reaffirmed her commitment to the organization amidst the scandal. \"My mission is to keep this organization/brand elevated and at the forefront of our decision making at all times,\" she stated.\n\nRose emphasized the pageant's role in championing social causes and providing a platform for women to use their voices. Despite the controversy, Rose remains optimistic about the organization's future.\n\nImpact on Miss Teen USA\n\nThe scandal also affected Miss Teen USA, as UmaSofia Srivastava resigned shortly after Voigt. Rose highlighted the organization’s dedication to creating a supportive environment, stating, \"We promote a stand-out culture, believing that all women have unique strengths, goals, and desires.\"\n\nAlso Read: Paris Olympics closing ceremony: Is Tom Cruise planning for a major stunt?\n\nTransition of Titles\n\nFollowing Voigt’s resignation, Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii assumed the title of Miss USA. As the runner-up in the 2023 competition, Gankiewicz has expressed her dedication to the organization. \"I still believe in the Miss USA organization and its future, and my intention is to make positive changes from within and rebuild its legacy,\" she wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe annual pageant will continue as scheduled, with Gankiewicz passing the crown to the new Miss USA 2024. Meanwhile, Addie Carver of Mississippi was recently named Miss Teen USA, filling the vacancy left by Srivastava.\n\nControversy Unveiled\n\nVoigt’s resignation letter, obtained by Yahoo News, painted a grim picture of her experience under Rose’s leadership. Voigt cited \"stress, instability, and lack of support\" as detrimental to her health. Her letter accused Rose of poor management, bullying, and harassment. The accusations were supported by Claudia Engelhardt, former Miss USA social media director, who corroborated several of Voigt’s claims.\n\nAlso Read : Shōgun Season 2: Will the upcoming season have a new story? Producer reveals details\n\nVoigt’s social media announcement included a hidden message, spelling out \"I AM SILENCED,\" further fueling speculation. Srivastava’s resignation followed, as she cited a misalignment of personal values with the organization’s direction.\n\nSunday’s Pageant Expectations\n\nThe upcoming pageant, hosted by Garcelle Beauvais of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and Keltie Knight of E! News, promises an evening of glamour and competition in Los Angeles. The judging panel includes Scheana Shay from Vanderpump Rules, Miss USA 1990 Carole Gist, motivational speaker Natasha Graziano, Anastasia Beverly Hills CEO Anastasia Soare, and APL managing partner NJ Falk.\n\nFifty-one representatives will compete for the Miss USA title, with the winner advancing to represent the United States at the Miss Universe 2024 competition. The 73rd Miss USA pageant will air live on Sunday, August 4, at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on the CW.\n\nAs the pageant approaches, the Miss USA organization aims to move past recent controversies and continue its legacy of empowering women. The spotlight will be on the new contenders as they vie for the prestigious title and the opportunity to become an ambassador for the United States on the global stage.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the difference between Miss USA and Miss America?\n\nToday, Miss America operates as a non-profit organization promoting itself as a scholarship program, whereas the Miss USA franchise is part of the Miss Universe Organization (MUO). Winners of Miss USA automatically advance to represent the United States in the international Miss Universe pageant.\n\nHas any Miss USA won Miss Universe?\n\nNine Miss USA winners have gone on to become Miss Universe, indicated in boldface. Since 1965, a runner-up has been selected to replace any Miss USA titleholder who wins the Miss Universe pageant.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
