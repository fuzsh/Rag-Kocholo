And you have to go to the next one and if you when there you go to the next one, and I kept winning all the way until the Miss USA pageant where I did not win,” Berry said of her pageant journey during a 2016 interview with W Magazine.\n\nShe ended up finishing as first runner-up behind Miss Texas Christy Fichtner in the 1986 Miss USA pageant,\n\n\"That ended my beauty pageant career,\" Berry told W Magazine.\n\nAs for her talent, she quipped, \"I had no talent.\"\n\n\"We didn't have to have the talent. [In] Miss America you need a talent. Miss USA you're talentless. You just show up,\" she said. \"Thank God I didn't have to sing.\"\n\nBerry then began her career as an actress, starring in films like Catwoman, Die Another Day, Cloud Atlas and X-Men: Days of Future Past.

I'm a part of American history,\" Moore, now 53, told Entertainment Tonight earlier this year.\n\n\"A little young Black girl from Detroit, having come from really nothing to being a celebrity overnight and touching people and having people be excited to see you in person and crying over you, that was a lot,\" she added. \"It was a lot to deal with, but I just remember it was the best time of my life.\"\n\nShe went on to place in the top six for the 1993 Miss Universe pageant, which was won by Dayanara Torres of Puerto Rico.\n\nMoore then began her acting career, diving into roles in films and television series like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Waiting to Exhale, Deliver Us From Eva and I Know Who Killed Me.\n\nMoore entered the reality television sphere in 2012, when she joined the Season 5 cast of The Real Housewives of Atlanta on Bravo.
