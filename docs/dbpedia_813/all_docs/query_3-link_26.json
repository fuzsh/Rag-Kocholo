        "text": "The 2024 Miss USA pageant kicked off on Sunday night with hosts Keltie Knight and Garcelle Beauvais taking the stage at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. The “E! News” co-host and “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star wore various outfits for the evening’s competition — including looks for the red carpet and dresses for the pageant.\n\nFor their attire, Knight and Beauvais brought their own signature style to the Miss USA pageant. Knight married two looks that have been popular on the red carpet as of late. The three-time Emmy winner wore a white monochrome dress with an off-the-shoulder neckline and long sleeves.\n\nThe dress featured a column skirt and a sheer bodice with long sleeves. The bodice of Knight’s dress also featured the peekaboo bra trend, which has been styled by such stars this year as Kristen Stewart and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, among others.\n\nFor her red carpet attire, Beauvais opted for a monochrome sleeveless black gown with several feathers. Both Knight and Beauvais changed their looks for the start of the show.\n\nUpon taking the stage, Knight and Beauvais brought Old Hollywood glamour with a hint of modernity. Knight wore a strapless gown with all-over silver sequins that glittered under the lights of flashing cameras. She also wore a statement necklace featuring green stones.\n\nBeauvais merged Old Holywood with the contemporary see-through and sheer dressing trend seen on the red carpet in 2024. Her dress featured a halter neckline with a dramatic, elevated and open element to frame her shoulders. The glittering skirt, complete with silver gemstones, featured the see-through, sheer element of the look.\n\nWhile Beauvais and Knight were the masters of ceremonies for the evening, they were not the only famous faces at the 73rd Annual Miss USA pageant.\n\n“Vanderpump Rules” star Scheana Shay, who also wore a variation on the sheer dressing trend on the red carpet, Anastasia Beverly Hills CEO Anastasia Soare, singer Gavin DeGraw, Miss USA 1990 winner Carole Gist, motivational speaker Natasha Graziano, APL managing partner NJ Falk and Miss USA 1994 Lu Parker served as judges for the evening.\n\nOne/Size Beauty founder and Miss USA 2023 judge Patrick Starrr brought major drama to the Miss USA red carpet, wearing a glittering gold ensemble complete with a shimmering, one-shoulder gown, coordinated headpiece, statement earrings and exaggerated bag all in the same complementary shade of gold.\n\nOther notable guests in attendance included Myrna Hansen, who wore a sash featuring the words Miss USA Hall of Fame 2024. Hansen was crowned Miss USA roughly 71 years ago in 1953.\n\nThe 73rd Miss USA pageant features representatives from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The event is sponsored by fashion designer Sherri Hill, Ricardo Patraca Crowns and Crown Couture Collection and more. Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii, Miss USA 2023, will crown her successor who will go on to represent the United States at the Miss Universe 2024 pageant in Mexico."
