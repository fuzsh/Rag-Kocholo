You and your staff are a pleasure with which to work and are professional in all aspects of the event production.\n\nAs a volunteer during the event, my perspective allows me to see the interaction of the leadership, staff, judges, and contestants.

From community leaders to those visiting our city, I have heard nothing but high marks for the pageant. I want to extend my thanks, appreciation, and congratulations for a fine event.\n\nI just wanted to say thank you so much for allowing me to be a part of the pageant. I had the time of my life. Your show was by far one of the best. I would love to be a part of your organization for years to come.\n\nYou and your organization are a class act. I can see why you received the Director of the Year award.\n\nFirst of all, I just want to say . . . what a wonderful production. This was my first year and I was very impressed with every aspect of the organization. You guys are doing a wonderful job!\n\nThank you for running a beautiful and professional pageant! It was everything we expected and more. What a learning experience for my daughter!!\n\nI would like to take a moment to thank all of the staff for helping all of us girls the pageant weekend. Thank you for all of the time and effort you put into making the pageant happen. I had the time of my life!\n\nI wanted to thank you for the opportunity I had to be in the pageant.

I know they worked very hard and I was grateful for all of their help and support. I learned a lot about myself and will use that in the future! Thank you for this opportunity . . . I can't wait to come back next year!\n\nI have been to quite a few Miss USA preliminaries in other states. None of them have even come close to being as well run or as professional as yours. Kent and Felicia are fantastic and together you all made my first pageant experience the best it could be.\n\nI would have NEVER in a million years thought that I would be up on a stage in front of people in my swimsuit. When I got out on that stage after practicing with everyone, I realized that I did have confidence and I'm so happy that you guys at the pageant helped me to find it. I just wanted to thank you for that.\n\nI just wanted to take some time to thank you and tell you how much I appreciate everything that you do and have done for me. You're the best!

You helped make this past year one I'll never forget.\n\nThank you so much for your hospitality and generosity. I couldn't ask for a more caring State Director.\n\nI can't even begin to thank you for everything! This year has been so incredible, and I had so many memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you for all the time and dedication you put into this program and into me. I will miss you and love you very much!\n\nI am so glad to have this experience and to have met you and gained so many new friends.\n\nI had so much fun at Miss USA! Thank you for all the preparation and for being the best director, but also a friend. I'm so glad God brought you into my life and I'm looking forward to a great rest of the year.\n\nI am so excited to see what the future holds, but no matter what, I will walk away with a new friend!\n\nWhere do I begin? Thank you for everything. Thank you for being the greatest director as well as a friend. You have done more for my life than you'll ever know.\n\nThank you for producing such a well organized pageant. I have thoroughly enjoyed my reign.\n\nThank you so much for all of your love. I couldn't be happier with my year. It's more than I ever dreamed it could be. I will miss being your queen and daughter.\n\nThank you for believing in me. Out of all of the incredible things that you do, that has meant the most. Every woman who has the opportunity to become your titleholder will be forever changed for the better because of it. Thank you.\n\nYou have shared so many meaningful words of advice that have helped me keep my head held high - no matter what the outcome of an event. Your love and support and generosity have been greatly appreciated. Thanks again for everything."
