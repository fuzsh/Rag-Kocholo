Among them was Miss Sally Botsai, a former Pittsburg prom queen who later served as deputy director of the White House Situation Room during the Vietnam War in the Nixon and Ford administrations, according to the agency's archive.\n\nThe NSA Princesses wore their Festival Identification ribbons to work, lunched together for maximum impact, and charmed staff members who selected their Queen by ballot using their assigned numbers 1-15.\n\nOh, Canada! Miss RCMP\n\nIt seems the Canadian beauties may have had a spray-tanned leg up on both NSA and KGB queens, however.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police Security Service (RCMPÂ SS) held its beauty contest in the early 1950s, awarding contestants 10 points each for hair, face, figure, dress, poise, and personality.\n\nThe RCMP pageant was just the warm-up act, however. The winner moved on to the big leagues - Canadaâs Miss Civil Service contest - where Miss RCMP competed with the Department of National Defense and other beauty queen big wigs.\n\nSparing no expense, the Canadian government awarded Miss Civil Service various prizes including an all-expense-paid trip to Bermuda - for one.\n\nIsn't she lovely?Â Miss Atomic Bomb\n\nPerhaps no North American beauty queen was more famous than Las Vegas showgirl Lee Merlin, however. The reign of Americaâs Miss Atomic Bomb - complete with a cotton mushroom cloud on the front of her swimsuit - coincided with Operation Plumbbob, a series of nuclear tests conducted in 1957 at the Nevada Test Site.\n\nIn all, there were at least four Miss Atomics, but were beauty pageants actually held or was it all just a PR stunt? Nobody seemed to care in the heady post-WWII decades. The US was in the grip of Atomic fever. Las Vegas was cashing in with Sin City atomic cocktails and parties. Bars offered complimentary sunglasses for guests at atomic-blast-viewing soirees on rooftops.\n\nNot much is known about what happened to Merlin, a Copa showgirl and the most notorious of the four titleholders. Her fellow queens included Miss Atomic Blast 1952 Candyce King (who âradiated loveliness'); Miss A-Bomb 1953 Paula Harris; and Miss Cue 1955 Linda Lawson (nicknamed after Operation Mis-Cue) with a tiara in the shape of a mushroom cloud reportedly constructed by US military servicemen from the Nevada Test Site.\n\nLike Miss KGB, Miss Atomic Bomb disappeared in a puff of smoke.\n\nIn fact, by 1991, at the end of Katya Mayorovaâs Miss KGB reign in Moscow, all of the international spy agencies seem to have put an end to the pageantry and slipped back into the shadows.\n\nKinda makes us want to hold hands and burst out crying."
