        "text": "The Miss Universe Organization, producers of the MISS UNIVERSE®, MISS USA® and MISS TEEN USA® competitions is an international company that advances and supports today’s women. These women are savvy, goal-oriented and aware. The delegates who become part of the Miss Universe Organization display those characteristics in their everyday lives, both as individuals who participate in the competitions to advance their careers, personal and humanitarian goals, and as women who seek to improve the lives of others.\n\nHundreds of millions of people know the Miss Universe Organization as the producer of three landmark annual television events, but that is only the most public element of this diverse group of dedicated people. Just as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is known for the annual live television event, The Academy Awards, the Miss Universe Organization is most recognized for its three live TV specials. Those popular events, however, are just the beginning.\n\nThe organization has redefined itself, just as it is redefining the world’s views of the women who attain its exclusive titles and as it is communicating women’s views of their own roles.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization provides the opportunities – the mentoring, career training, resources and life experiences – for women to be personally enriched through the organization’s year-round support of all aspects of their lives, from their own personal career goals to social and humanitarian causes and work.\n\nThe titleholders of the Miss Universe Organization personify the combination of beauty and intelligence that defines the 21st Century. In keeping with its global view and position as creator of role models, the Miss Universe Organization has a new corporate structure and enhanced corporate goals.\n\nMISS UNIVERSE\n\nSatellite developments in the 1970’s allowed the Miss Universe competition to travel outside the United States, and in 1972, via satellite, for the first time from Dorado, Puerto Rico. That event inaugurated a series of annual television specials, which presented the culture and attractions of some of the most spectacular regions of the world to an international audience of hundreds of millions of people. From Puerto Rico, the competition traveled to these exciting locations:\n\n• Las Vegas, Nevada (2015)\n\n• Miami, Florida (2014)\n\n• Moscow, Russia (2013)\n\n• Las Vegas, Nevada (2012)\n\n• São Paulo, Brazil (2011)\n\n• Las Vegas, Nevada (2010)\n\n• Atlantis, Paradise Island, Bahamas (2009)\n\n• Nha Trang, Vietnam (2008)\n\n• Mexico City, Mexico (1993, 2007)\n\n• Los Angeles, California (1990, 2006)\n\n• Bangkok, Thailand (1992, 2005)\n\n• Quito, Ecuador (2004)\n\n• Puerto Rico (2001, 2002)\n\n• Cyprus (2000)\n\n• Trinidad & Tobago (1999)\n\n• Honolulu, Hawaii (1998)\n\n• Miami Beach, Florida (1997)\n\n• Las Vegas, Nevada (1996)\n\n• Windhoek, Namibia (1995)\n\n• Manila, Philippines (1994)\n\n• Las Vegas, Nevada (1991)\n\n• Cancun, Mexico (1989)\n\n• Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China (1988)\n\n• Singapore (1987)\n\n• Panama City, Panama (1986, 2003)\n\n• Miami, Florida (1984, 1985)\n\n• St. Louis, Missouri (1983)\n\n• Lima, Peru (1982)\n\n• New York, New York (1981)\n\n• Seoul, South Korea (1980)\n\n• Perth, Australia (1979)\n\n• Acapulco, Mexico (1978)\n\n• The Dominican Republic (1977)\n\n• Hong Kong (1976)\n\n• El Salvador (1975)\n\n• Manila, Philippines (1974)\n\n• Athens, Greece (1973)"
