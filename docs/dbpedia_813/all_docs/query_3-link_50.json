        "text": "Only one can take home the crown when The CW presents the live broadcast presentation of The 73rd Miss USA Pageant Sunday, August 4th at 7pm.\n\nRepresentative titleholders from each state will gather at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles, California to compete in the legendary pageant, including Wisconsin's own Tori Tritton. This marks a return to the organization's city of origin for the first time in almost two decades, and will be Miss USA's first contest under new rules aimed at modernizing the pageant to better reflect the goals of today’s women, breaking away from regulations established more than 70 years ago. Importantly, this year is the first time any adult woman can compete in Miss USA, regardless of age, marital status, or parental status.\n\nAfter a scandalous year for the organization saw Miss USA 2023 Noelia Voight of Utah relinquish the crown in May, First runner-up Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii will be in attendance to pass the prestigious crown down to her successor. This year's winner will go on to represent the United States at the Miss Universe competition at the end of this year. The partnership with The CW Network began last season and marked the pageant's return to broadcast television in nearly a decade. The companion pageant Miss Teen USA aired LIVE Thursday night on The CW, crowning Mississippi's Addie Carver Miss Teen USA 2024.\n\n“The Miss USA and Miss Teen USA Organization is thrilled to partner with The CW Network to bring Miss USA and now the Miss Teen USA to audiences and viewers across the nation,” said Laylah Rose, President and CEO of the Organization. “The Miss USA and Miss Teen USA Pageants have captivated audiences for decades with their unwavering commitment to making a positive impact in their communities. Through our exciting partnership with The CW, a blend of nostalgia and innovation, we are excited to showcase this prestigious competition and remain a beloved staple in family homes everywhere.”\n\nThe affair will be helmed by Emmy award-winning television hosts and multi-hyphenates Keltie Knight and Garcelle Beauvais.This year’s Miss USA pageant will feature a judging panel comprised of seven accomplished women across all arenas of life including Anastasia Beverly Hills Founder, beauty entrepreneur Anastasia Soare, Miss USA 1990 Carole Gist, Miss USA 1994, motivational speaker and news anchor Lu Parker, stand up comedian Iliza Shlesinger, motivational speaker Natasha Graziano, Vanderpump Rules’ star Scheana Shay, and APL Running Shoes’ NJ Falk.\n\nMiss USA is an American beauty pageant that has been held annually since 1952 to select the woman who will represent the United States at the Miss Universe pageant. For over 60 years, Miss USA has been a staple in the pageant industry, providing young women with the platform to showcase their talents, intelligence, and leadership skills. The organization believes in the power of women to make a difference in the world, and Miss USA is proud to have crowned some of the most successful and influential women in the world. They believe that every woman has the potential to achieve great things, and are committed to providing them with the resources and opportunities to do so.\n\nSee who will own the night and walk away as the 2024 titleholder during The 73rd Miss USA Pageant LIVE Sunday, August 4th at 7pm on Milwaukee's CW18!"
