        "text": "History of Miss DC\n\nAfter returning from a newspaper circulation managers’ meeting in Philadelphia, representatives of The Washington Herald decided to join with other East Coast newspapers in holding a “Popularity Contest” in 1921. The winner was to receive a trip to Atlantic City to compete in the “Inter-City Beauty Contest,” an addition to 1920’s “Fall Frolic,” which was an attempt to keep visitors in Atlantic City beyond Labor Day.\n\n​\n\nFollowing the elimination of approximately 1,000 entrants (who sent in their photos), and two weeks of being judged along with the forty finalists at citywide functions in day and formal attire, Margaret Gorman, a sixteen-year-old junior at Western High School (now the Duke Ellington School of the Arts) was selected as “Miss Washington, D.C.” When Washington Herald representatives arrived at her Georgetown home to let her know that she had won the contest, they found her playing marbles nearby with her brothers.\n\nUpon her arrival at Atlantic City, Margaret was entered into the “National Beauty Tournament” (in afternoon attire) with the other “Inter-City Beauties.” She won. The next day, the Inter-City beauties were again entered into the festival’s new “Bathers’ Revue.” Again, she won. With several hundred women entered in three categories (Inter-City, Amateur, and Professional), Margaret Gorman was again chosen the over-all winner.\n\nBy the following September, because another woman, Evelyn C. Lewis, had already been named “Miss Washington, D.C.,” Margaret, who was expected to come back to Atlantic City to defend her title, was given the title of “Miss America.” She was also the only winner to be crowned at the end of her reign.\n\nSubsequent “Miss America” competitions were variously held on the Atlantic City beach and boardwalk, on Steel Pier, in Convention Hall (later “Boardwalk Hall), and, during World War II (when Convention Hall was used for military training), at the Warner Theatre on the boardwalk, where only its façade remains today.\n\nThe Miss Washington, D.C. (later “Miss District of Columbia”) competition was held under the sponsorship of The Washington Herald through 1927, and Washingtonians fared very well in the national competition. Marjorie Joesting nearly became the District of Columbia’s second Miss America. She finished second to Miss America 1926.\n\nDue to charges of a “lack of decorum” placed upon the Atlantic City Pageant from women’s groups and religious leaders, the Miss America Pageant was dormant from 1928 until 1933. That returning year was a financial disaster and the event again went inactive in 1934. The Miss America Pageant was resurrected in 1935 and has remained to this day.\n\nVenus Ramey, a beautiful redhead who sang and danced the rumba, became the second Miss America from the District of Columbia in 1944. Margo Lucey, Miss District of Columbia 1956, and Roseanne Tueller, Miss District of Columbia 1963, both finished as first runner-up to Miss America.\n\nWith a break in the early 1950′s, when the District of Columbia’s pageant was organized by Capital Broadcasting Company, the Miss District of Columbia pageant was sponsored by Radio Station WWDC from 1942 through 1963.\n\nFor many years, the Miss Washington, D.C. pageant was held at the Loew’s Capitol Theater, often cited as the most beautiful and grand of all of Washington’s movie palaces. It was closed in 1963, and demolished in 1964. All that remains today is its famous archway on the building’s façade, which forms the entrance to the National Press Building.\n\nFor some years prior to Station WWDC’s sponsorship, the Miss Washington contest also took place on a cruise liner on the Potomac River.\n\nSince the District of Columbia’s record at Miss America far out-weighed those of neighboring Maryland and Virginia, and since many of the city’s winners did come from the surrounding areas of the city, there was pressure put on WWDC to only allow city residents to compete for the District of Columbia title. With much of its listening audience outside the District, WWDCdropped the franchise in 1964. At about this same time, the Miss America Organization decided to have only states, and not cities, send representatives to Miss America. For these reasons, the pageant was discontinued until 1984 when the District of Columbia was again granted a franchise and Desiree Keating became the first African American to win the title. Financial debt caused the pageant to close its doors once again after the 1989 winner was selected. During these hiatuses, young women who were District residents were permitted to compete in the adjacent states of Maryland and Virginia. In the 1990’s, Miss Maryland local competitions, such as Miss Capital City and Miss Federal City, were open to both Maryland and D.C. residents, with competitions held in the District.\n\nIn 1997, the Miss America Organization agreed to have the District of Columbia franchise back in operation. So now, every area of the continental United States (in addition to Alaska and Hawaii) would have a representative at the Miss America competition. That year, Sonya Gavankar, Miss DC 1997, became the first Indian-American to compete on the Miss America stage.\n\nIn the last two decades, Nicole Messina, Miss District of Columbia 1998, won a Miss America Preliminary Talent Award and was named to the top ten semi-finalists; Marshawn Evans, Miss District of Columbia 2001, won the Miss America Preliminary Talent and Interview Awards and was 3rd runner-up to Miss America; Shannon Schambeau, Miss District of Columbia 2005, won the Miss America Preliminary Swimsuit Award and was selected 4th runner-up to Miss America; Kate Marie Grinold, Miss District of Columbia 2008, and Jennifer Corey, Miss District of Columbia 2009, each were chosen as semi-finalists in their respective Miss America competitions; Cierra Jackson, Miss District of Columbia 2016, took home the Preliminary Swimsuit Award at Miss America; and Briana Kinsey, Miss District of Columbia 2017 was a Quality of Life Scholarship Finalist, a STEM Scholarship winner, and placed 3rd Runner-Up to Miss America. Miss District of Columbia 2018, Allison Farris, was a semi-finalist and a finalist for the Quality of Life Award at the Miss America competition. Miss District of Columbia, Andolyn Medina, placed as a semi-finalist at Miss America.\n\nIn 2006, the Miss America Pageant moved to Las Vegas, where it remained for eight consecutive years, being held in January, instead of the usual September. The competition took place at the Aladdin Hotel and Casino, later replaced by Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. In September 2013, the Miss America competition returned to the place of its birth, Atlantic City, New Jersey, for its 93rd anniversary pageant at historic Boardwalk Hall. It remained there through 2018, when it moved to Mohegan Sun resort in Uncasville, Connecticut, where it celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2021. In 2024, the competition moved to Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in Orlando, Florida.\n\nEach woman who has held the Miss Washington, D.C. or Miss District of Columbia title has brought her own special charm, intelligence, talent and beauty to the crown she has worn. While our country and world have changed since that first Miss Washington, D.C. contest in 1921, the tradition of Miss District of Columbia lives on!\n\nMiss DC: Miss America 1921 & 1944\n\nYear, Name and Placement at the Miss America Pageant"
