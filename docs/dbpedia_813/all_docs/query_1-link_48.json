        "text": "Beauty pageants have occupied a prominent role in popular culture in Latin America and the Spanish Caribbean. In countries like Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, pageants have become not only an opportunity for social mobility but also a space in which the complex layers of identity, such as race, ethnicity, gender, and class, take center stage. In the case of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth of the United States (U.S.) but also a bridge of the Americas, pageants have become a transnational display of cultural nationalism. With the highest number of international beauty queens per square mile, the island's national pageant circuit has historically showcased values of Puerto Rico's unique ethno-national identity. This article explores the figure of Miss Puerto Rico as a case study in how beauty queens, as a symbolic representation of an ethno-nation, have embodied the socio-political and cultural tensions that emerged from the complex colonial relation between Puerto Rico and the U.S. while presenting a unique case to understand nationalism in Latin American.\n\nBeauty is not universally given. In different times and spaces dominant beauty standards can vary. Marginalization can be found within representations of beauty, for example in societies or cultures where lighter skin is more favored than darker skin (Craig, M., 2006). A beauty pageant is one of the platforms where beauty and its visualization are displayed extensively. How do these beauty pageants gain popularity with both a local and a global audience? The appeal and the interpretation of beauty pageants can differ in regards to cultural, social and political meanings given to it (In a more and more globalizing world, visual images are everywhere. Popular and visual culture reaches a worldwide audience and beauty pageants are an example of this global cultural flow (Wilk, R., 1995). They appeal to an audience on an international, a national and a local level and create a stage where identities and cultures can be made public and visible (Mani, B., 2006). Furthermore, also ideals, values and conceptions of beauty are made visible through the framework of a beauty pageant, whereby it is exposed to the reinterpretation and imagination of others (Gilbert, J., 2015). Using beauty pageants as an illustration, this article attempts to explore the concept of visual activism with the Mr. and Mrs. Albinism beauty pageant as a starting point. This article centralizes around 'unlikely' misses and the use of the popular global format that a beauty pageant is to change the dominant narrative on their stigmatized embodied identities (Bloul, 2012). [Keywords: beauty pageants, visual activism, dominant beauty ideals, stigmatized embodied identities]\n\nMiss Dominican Republic U.S. is an exclusive event, which gathers young women from different parts of the country, whose origins are from the Dominican Repub lic, competing to be crowned as the most beautiful ambassador for the Dominican women in the United States. ... As an official franchise of the Miss Dominican Republic Universe organization, the U.S. winner represents the Dominican commu nity in the U.S. as part of Miss Dominican Republic Universe organization, giving her the unique chance to compete for the title that could potentially take her to Miss Universe.-About us section of the website for the Miss Dominican Republic U.S, Organization B eauty pageants have been a visible part of our societies, and more specifically of our cultural discussions on gender and nationalism, since the 1930s and 1940s. Until recently the critical consensus has been to note the inadequacies of these pag eants in accurately representing the realities of women in contemporary societies, and to view them as tools for aligning attitudes towards gender, race, sexuality, national ism, and local and global cultures with the hegemonic norm. Lately, however, more complex views have changed this consensus.' For example, Belinda Edmondson's\n\nBeauty pageants are puzzling events. Beauty pageants are often considered as commercial and degrading to women or even as vulgar spectacular events by their opponents. To the indifferent, beauty pageants seem simple and trivial, “What you see is what you get”. Beauty pageants and popular culture have often been seen as too ‘low’ or too obvious to be taken seriously by academic researchers (for studies on beauty pageants see Banet-Weiser, 1999, Cohen et al, 1996, Giroux, 1998, Lavenda, 1988, Russell, 1997). Cohen et al (1996) point to the fact that researchers have tended to neglect beauty contests as “...trivial, frivolous, or vulgar.” (Cohen et al, p.5) and there is thus a risk of taking for granted the operation of power (cf. Russell, 1997) in these kinds of events."
