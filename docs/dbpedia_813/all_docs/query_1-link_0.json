        "text": "Beauty contest\n\nNot to be confused with Miss America or Miss United States.\n\nFor the most recent competition, see Miss USA 2024.\n\nMiss USA is an American beauty pageant that has been held annually since 1952 to select the entrant from United States in the Miss Universe pageant. The Miss Universe Organization operated both pageants, as well as Miss Teen USA, until 2020, when the organization announced it was licensing operation of the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants to Crystle Stewart, Miss USA for 2008 prior to her suspension in October 2022, thus returning the said pageants to the Miss Universe Organization.[1]\n\nThe pageant was owned by Donald Trump from 1996 to 2015 and was previously broadcast on NBC. In September 2015, WME/IMG purchased the pageant from Trump.[2] In 2020, for the first time, the FYI network broadcast the competition. In October 2022, JKN Global Group acquired the pageant from WME/IMG.[3] It is currently broadcast on The CW.[4]\n\nThe current reigning Miss USA is Alma Cooper of Michigan, who won the title on August 4, 2024 at the Peacock Theater, in Los Angeles, California. She will serve as the country's delegate to the Miss Universe 2024 pageant.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Miss USA pageant was conceived in 1950 when Yolande Betbeze, winner of the Miss America pageant, refused to pose for publicity pictures while wearing a swimsuit. Pageant sponsor Catalina decided to pull their sponsorship of the pageant and create their own competition.[5] Other owners have included a subsidiary of Gulf+Western Industries, ITT Corporation and Donald Trump.[6][7]\n\nThe first Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants were held concurrently in Long Beach, California, in 1952; the first Miss USA winner was Miss New York USA Jackie Loughery.[8] There were 30 delegates in the first year of competition. Many states did not compete every year during the first two decades of the pageant's history. Since the 1970s, each state and the District of Columbia have sent a delegate each year. Alaska first competed in 1959 and Hawaii in 1960. Both had competed at Miss Universe until this time.\n\nThe pageant aired on CBS from 1963 until 2002 and for many years was known for having a CBS game show host as pageant host. The show's highest ratings were in the early 1980s when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings.[9][10][11] Viewership dropped sharply from the 1990s to the 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20 million to an average of 7 million from 2000 to 2001.[12] In 2002, then-owner Donald Trump brokered a deal with NBC, giving it half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe, and Miss Teen USA pageants and moving them to the network on an initial five-year contract.[13] The pageant first aired on NBC in 2003.\n\nThe Miss USA title winner historically represented the U.S. in its sister pageant, Miss Universe. Since its inception, nine Miss USA titleholders have gone on to win Miss Universe. In the mid-1960s, the organization established a rule that when a Miss USA wins the Miss Universe title, the first runner-up assumes the Miss USA title for the remainder of the year. This occurred in 1980, 1995, 1997, 2012, and 2022.[14][15] In 1967, the first runner-up Susan Bradley of California declined the title and the crown went to the second runner-up Cheryl Patton of Florida. The only instance when a first runner-up assumed the title of Miss USA before this period was in 1957, when Mary Leona Gage of Maryland resigned after it was discovered she was married.[16]\n\nThe winner is assigned a one-year contract with the Miss Universe Organization, traveling across the United States and sometimes overseas to spread messages about their chosen causes. Aside from the job, the winner also receives a cash allowance for her entire reign, a modeling portfolio, beauty products, clothes, shoes, styling, healthcare, and fitness services from different pageant sponsors. She also gains exclusive access to events such as fashion shows and opening galas, as well as access to casting calls and modeling opportunities throughout New York City. When Donald Trump owned the pageant, the winner was given the use of a Trump Place apartment in New York City during her reign, which she shared with the Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA titleholders.\n\nIf the winner cannot fulfill her duties as Miss USA for any reason, including if she wins the Miss Universe title, her 1st runner-up takes over.\n\nAfter losing its television partners, it was announced that Miss USA 2015 would be streamed on the pageant's website. Shortly before the pageant, however, Reelz Channel announced that it would broadcast Miss USA 2015.[17][18]\n\nIn September 2015, IMG acquired the Miss Universe Organization for an undisclosed amount. The company had previously been involved in licensing and production for the events. The following month, Fox announced that it had acquired the U.S. television rights to Miss USA and Miss Universe, beginning with Miss Universe 2015 and Miss USA 2016.[19][20]\n\nStarting with the 2023 edition of the pageant, the Miss Universe Organization announced in August 2022 that it would accept divorced, maritally annulled, married, or widowed women and mothers to compete in the pageant.[21] In October, JKN Global Group through JKN Metaverse Inc. acquired the Miss Universe Organization for US$14 million.[3]\n\nLater in September 2023, 2022 winner R'Bonney Gabriel announced that the organization would be forgoing the age limit, even for all its related pageants, not just Miss USA. Accordingly, beginning with Miss USA 2024, adult women 29 years old and above will also be eligible to participate.[22] Also that same month, the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants would move The CW, with Miss USA 2023 airing on the network and Miss Teen USA 2023 streaming on its app.[23] On April 25, 2024, The CW extended its broadcast rights to the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants in a three-year deal; as part of the deal, the Miss Teen USA pageant will air on broadcast television for the first time since 2007.[24]\n\nMiss USA 2015 controversy\n\nSee also: Miss USA 2015 § Controversy\n\nIn late-June 2015, both NBC and Spanish-language network Univision (which was to begin a new five-year contract for Spanish rights) announced that they would cut their ties with Donald Trump and the Miss Universe Organization in response to remarks Trump made relating to undocumented immigrants during the launch of his 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Trump threatened to sue both companies over the decision; on June 30, 2015, Trump sued Univision for defamation and breach of contract.[25][26] In February 2016, Donald Trump and Univision reached a settlement ending the litigation. The terms of the settlement remain confidential but included an agreement for Trump to buy back NBCUniversal's stake in the MUO.[27][20]\n\nResponse to COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe Miss USA 2020 was impacted by scheduling delays, difficulty finding a location, and broadcasting issues amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In August 2020 it was announced that it would be televised at FYI and would be held in November.[28]\n\n2020–2022: Split from MUO\n\nIn the summer of 2020, the Miss Universe organization finalized licensing of future annual operation of the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants to Crystle Stewart, who was Miss USA 2008, until her suspension in October 2022.[1] The first pageant competitions under her directorship as Miss USA Organization were the 2021 productions.\n\n2022–2023: Miss USA 2022 controversy and MUO investigation\n\nShortly after the Miss USA 2022 competition, the Miss Universe Organization suspended the organizers of the Miss USA pageant (headed by Crystle Stewart) after allegations of favoritism toward the eventual winner, R'Bonney Gabriel, while she was still Miss Texas USA.[29][30]\n\nIn August 2023, it was announced that Stewart had stepped down as president of the Miss USA Organization.[31] She was replaced by fashion designer Laylah Rose.[32]\n\n2024–present: Resignation of Both National Titleholders\n\nOn May 6, 2024, the reigning Miss USA 2023, Noelia Voigt, resigned from the title citing a desire to prioritize her mental health.[33] Two days later, the reigning Miss Teen USA 2023, UmaSofia Srivastava, also resigned from her title. Voigt's resignation statement, which she posted to Instagram,[34] seemingly spelled out (with the first letter of the beginning of each sentence): \"I Am Silenced\"; although, the last three sentences did not fit this message, spelling out \"HIP\".[33][35] The New York Times later obtained Voigt's internal resignation letter to the Miss USA organization where she cited \"a toxic work environment\", \"bullying and harassment\", and delayed delivery of her prize winnings as reasons for her resignation.[36] Both Voigt and Srivastava hold contracts with the Miss USA organization which have confidentiality agreements.[37]\n\nVoigt's first runner-up, Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii, assumed the title of Miss USA 2023 on May 9, 2024.[38] Srivastava's first runner-up, Stephanie Skinner of New York, declined to assume the title of Miss Teen USA 2023, and as of May 14, 2024, the Miss Teen USA 2023 title is vacant.[39]\n\nOn May 15, 2024, the mothers of former Miss USA, Noelia Voigt, and Miss Teen USA, UmaSofia Srivastava, came forward to discuss the circumstances surrounding their daughters' unexpected resignations from their titles. Bound by non-disclosure agreements with the Miss USA organization, the young women could not personally address the situation. Their mothers, however, stated in an interview on Good Morning America: \"The job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare\". They claimed that their daughters were exposed to ill-treatment, abuse, bullying, and felt cornered within the organization. UmaSofia Srivastava announced her resignation on Instagram, stating her values “no longer aligned” with those of the organization. Similarly, Noelia Voigt referenced her mental health in her resignation statement. The nature of her cryptic statement hinted at the idea of being silenced, spelled out in the first 11 sentences of her post. Her mother, Jackeline Voigt, responding to queries about the implied message, avoided confirming its deliberate intent but underscored that her daughter felt silenced due to the ongoing provisions of the non-disclosure agreement.[40]\n\nCompetition\n\nThe modern pageant consists of a preliminary competition held a week before the pageant when all contestants are judged in swimsuit, evening gown, and interview competitions.[41]\n\nState competitions\n\nEvery year, applicants must have to choose their delegate for the Miss USA pageant who is at the age of 18 or above on the annual state pageant season.[42][43] Each state holds a preliminary competition.[44] In some states, local pageants are also held to determine delegates for the state competition.[45][46] The state winners hold the title \"Miss (State) USA\" for the year of their reign.\n\nThe most successful state is Texas; ten Texas representatives have gone on to win the Miss USA title, more than any other state, including five consecutive winners from 1985 until 1989.[47] California has the second most wins at six, while the District of Columbia, New York, Hawaii, and Illinois each have four.\n\nMiss USA licenses out the state pageants to pageant directors, who in some cases are responsible for more than one state. As of February 2024, the directorial groups are the following:\n\nBrains and Beauties Productions (District of Columbia)\n\nCasting Crowns Productions (Arizona)\n\nCrown Diva Productions[48] (California)\n\nD&D Productions (Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island)\n\nEmpower2 Productions[49] (Indiana, West Virginia)\n\nEwald Productions (Connecticut)\n\nEye for Style Production[50] (New Hampshire, Vermont)\n\nFuture Productions (Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Wyoming)\n\nGarness Productions (Alaska)\n\nGreenwood Productions (Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee)\n\nHayat Amyra Productions[51] (Florida)\n\nLaura's Productions (New Mexico)\n\nLime Light Enterprises (Montana)\n\nNew Media Productions (Hawaii)\n\nPageants NW Productions (Idaho, Oregon, Washington)\n\nProctor Productions (Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania)\n\nRPM Productions (Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina)\n\nSmoak Productions (Nevada, Utah)\n\nThe Clemente Organization (Maine, Massachusetts)\n\nThe FAV Group, Inc.[50] (Virginia)\n\nThe Pageant Guy Productions (Texas)\n\nV&M Productions (Delaware)\n\nVanbros and Associates (Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma)\n\nWinners\n\nAt the age of 28 years, 6 months and 13 days, Miss USA 2022, R'Bonney Gabriel became the oldest Miss USA winner in the pageant's history. Miss USA 2015, Olivia Jordan, of Oklahoma is the only Miss USA winner to compete in two major international pageants: Miss Universe and Miss World. The tallest Miss USA is Miss USA 2012, Nana Meriwether, of Maryland at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m).[citation needed]\n\nThe first Asian-American woman to win Miss USA was Macel Wilson of Hawaii in 1962; the first Hispanic woman was Laura Martinez-Herring of Texas in 1985; the first African-American winner was Carole Gist of Michigan in 1990;[52] the first Pacific Islander American Miss USA was Brook Lee of Hawaii in 1997;[53] and the first Middle Eastern American Miss USA was Rima Fakih of Michigan in 2010.[54]\n\nThough no woman has ever won both titles outright, Brandi Sherwood of Idaho is the only woman to have held both the Miss Teen USA and Miss USA titles. She was Miss Idaho Teen USA, Miss Teen USA 1989, Miss Idaho USA 1997, first runner-up at Miss USA 1997, and in May 1997 assumed the Miss USA title after Brook Lee of Hawaii won the Miss Universe pageant.[15] Ten other Miss USA titleholders have also previously competed at Miss Teen USA. These include:\n\nShanna Moakler (1995, Miss Rhode Island Teen USA 1992)\n\nAli Landry (1996, Miss Louisiana Teen USA 1990)\n\nKimberly Pressler (1999, Miss New York Teen USA 1994)\n\nLynnette Cole (2000, Miss Tennessee Teen USA 1995)\n\nSusie Castillo (2003, Miss Massachusetts Teen USA 1998)\n\nChelsea Cooley (2005, Miss North Carolina Teen USA 2000)\n\nTara Conner (2006, Miss Kentucky Teen USA 2002)\n\nRachel Smith (2007, Miss Tennessee Teen USA 2002)\n\nAlyssa Campanella (2011, Miss New Jersey Teen USA 2007)\n\nSarah Rose Summers (2018, Miss Nebraska Teen USA 2012)\n\nSix Miss USA titleholders have also competed at Miss America. These include:\n\nMiriam Stevenson (1954, Miss South Carolina 1953)\n\nCarlene King Johnson (1955, Miss Vermont 1953)\n\nCarol Morris (1956, Miss Iowa 1954)\n\nMai Shanley (1984, Miss New Mexico 1983)\n\nShandi Finnessey (2004, Miss Missouri 2002)\n\nAsya Branch (2020, Miss Mississippi 2018)\n\nShandi Finnessey, Miss USA 2004 and Miss Missouri 2002 won a preliminary evening gown award at Miss America 2003. Also, Miriam Stevenson placed in the top 10 at Miss America 1954 as Miss South Carolina 1953.\n\nMany Miss USA winners have gone to pursue careers in the entertainment industry. Those who have been successful in the industry include Summer Bartholomew, Deborah Shelton, Laura Martinez-Herring, Kelli McCarty, Shanna Moakler, Frances Parker, Ali Landry, Kenya Moore, Brandi Sherwood, Kimberly Pressler, Susie Castillo, Shandi Finnessey, Rachel Smith, Crystle Stewart, Olivia Culpo and Cheslie Kryst.\n\nMiss USA titleholders\n\nFor full list and details, see List of Miss USA titleholders.\n\nYear State Miss USA Venue Placement at Miss Universe Special awards 2024 Michigan Alma Cooper Los Angeles, California TBA TBA 2023 Hawaii Savannah Gankiewicz Honolulu, Hawaii Originally 1st runner-up, later assumed title after Voigt resigned[38][55] Utah Noelia Voigt (resigned) Reno, Nevada Top 20 2022 North Carolina Morgan Romano Auburn, Alabama Originally 1st runner-up, later assumed title after Gabriel won Miss Universe Texas R'Bonney Gabriel Reno, Nevada Miss Universe 2022 2021 Kentucky Elle Smith[56] Tulsa, Oklahoma Top 10 2020 Mississippi Asya Branch Memphis, Tennessee Top 21\n\nAwards\n\nThe awards most frequently presented at Miss USA are Miss Amity (also known as Miss Congeniality) and Miss Photogenic.\n\nThe Miss Amity Award is chosen by the delegates, and recognizes those who are the friendliest and make the pageant experience the most enjoyable. From 1952 to 1964, when the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants were concurrent events, the award could be won by a contestant competing either for Miss USA or Miss Universe. In fact, in 1960, there was a tie, with the award going to Miss Universe Burma, Myint Myint May, and Miss Louisiana USA, Rebecca Fletcher. In 2015, Alaska and Delaware tied for the Miss Congeniality award. Vermont and Wyoming have won five Miss Amity/Congeniality awards, two more than any other state.\n\nThe Miss Photogenic prize was first awarded in 1965 and was chosen by journalists until 1996 when it was chosen by an internet vote for the first time. There has been only one tie in this award's history: in 1980, when it was shared between Jineane Ford of Arizona and Elizabeth Kim Thomas of Ohio. The state that has won the most Photogenic awards is Virginia.\n\nLouisiana won both the first Miss Amity and Photogenic awards given to a Miss USA contestant.\n\nOther awards that have been presented include Best State Costume (1962–1993, 2021–present[57]), Style (1995–2001) and Most Beautiful Eyes (1993). In 1998, a special Distinguished Achievement award was given to Halle Berry.[58] Berry was Miss Ohio USA 1986 and placed 1st runner-up to Christy Fichtner of Texas. She later went on to become an acclaimed actress and Oscar winner.\n\nLocations\n\nIn the first eight years of competition (1952–1959), the Miss USA pageant was held in Long Beach, California. The competition moved to Miami Beach, Florida in 1960 and stayed there until 1971. In 1972, the pageant was held in Puerto Rico, the only time the pageant has been held outside the continental United States. That pageant was rocked by an explosion at the host hotel.[59]\n\nFrom 1972 onwards, the pageant has been held in various locations, generally being held in each location for two to three years.\n\nAs of 2022, the pageant has been held in the following states:\n\nReality television\n\nMany Miss USA and Miss Teen USA delegates have participated in reality television shows and other television game shows. Well known delegates who later competed in reality shows are Danni Boatwright, winner of Survivor: Guatemala and contestant of Survivor: Winners at War, Kim Mullen of Survivor: Palau; Amanda Kimmel of Survivor: China, Survivor: Micronesia and Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains; Candace Smith of Survivor: Tocantins; Ashley Underwood of Survivor: Redemption Island, and Desiree Williams of Survivor: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers; Christie Lee Woods of The Amazing Race 5 and The Amazing Race 31, Nicole O'Brian also of The Amazing Race 5, Stephanie Smith of The Amazing Race 17 and Amy Diaz of The Amazing Race 23; Shandi Finnessey, Shanna Moakler and Hannah Brown on Dancing with the Stars; Jennifer Murphy of The Apprentice 4; Tori Fiorenza of The Challenge: Cutthroat; Brown also appeared in The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, other The Bachelor stars include Krisily Kennedy, Catherine Warren, Caroline Lunny, Caelynn Miller-Keyes, Alayah Benavidez, Kelsey Weier, Victoria Paul, Mariela Pepin, and Susie Evans.[60]\n\nIn 2007, Pageant Place, a reality television show featuring Rachel Smith, Riyo Mori, Hilary Cruz, Katie Blair, and Tara Conner aired on MTV.[61]\n\nOn June 19, 2011, Bravo Television's Andy Cohen co-hosted the event's 60th anniversary live in Las Vegas with E!
