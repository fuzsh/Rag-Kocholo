Gist was the first African American woman to win the Miss USA title.[1]\n\nGist first won the title of Miss Michigan USA and went on to win the Miss USA crown on March 2, 1990, in Wichita, Kansas.[1][2] The 1990 pageant had representatives from Georgia (Brenda Leithleiter), Alaska (Karin Elizabeth Meyer), Kentucky (Tiffany Tenfelde), South Carolina (Gina Tolleson, who as first runner-up then went on to represent the country at the Miss World pageant, winning the title) and Karin Hartz of New Jersey making up with Gist the Top 6 finalists. Gist, a 6 ft 0 in (183 cm) Detroit native,[1] 20 years old at the time, eventually became first runner-up to Mona Grudt of Norway in the Miss Universe pageant of that same year. She was also the first contestant from Michigan to win Miss USA, and broke the five-year streak of winners from Texas."
