        "text": "Almost a century of greatness to boast.\n\nMiss America has been a staple in this great nation for almost 100 years. Which means almost 100 women have been given the honor of being crowned with the prestigious title of Miss America. A lot has changed since the pageant first began, but the tradition and legacy still remains the same. Women from all across the country compete annually to see who will be given the great honor.\n\nIn 2019, Nia Franklin was crowned Miss America, a historic honor in it's own right, but made even more special considering that with Nia's win marks the first time three black women are the titleholders of the three major pageants titles: Miss America, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. In fact, the first African-American woman to be crowned Miss America only happened in 1983 when Vanessa Williams was crowned the winner.\n\n\"I'm the 92nd Miss America due to like wars and things like that—throughout the years sometimes Miss Americas will be Miss America longer than just a year because they wouldn't hold the competition—so I'm the 92nd Miss America, but this past year that I won was the 98th anniversary, so that was certainly historical,\" she explained. \"But then six or seven months after that, Cheslie [Kryst] and Kaliegh [Garris] win and then it's like, 'Oh my gosh, this is the first time in history that there have been three women of color holding these titles at the same time', which I was not even aware that that hadn't happened before. It just wasn't something that I hadn't thought of before.\"\n\nClick through our gallery here to see all the winners throughout the years."
