        "text": "When Zozibini Tunzi, a South African public relations professional, was crowned Miss Universe last weekend, black women shouted, stomped and screamed across the world.\n\nIf you missed it and you don’t know what I’m talking about, you don’t know many black women — or you don’t know black women who are connected to popular culture.\n\nI watched one of my sisters sit up straight from a slouch, throw both hands in the air and move her head as she yelped, “Yeah, baby!” I watched black folks on social media cry out as if a black man had been elected president of the United States. There was some genuine disbelief and a sense of welcome reality.\n\nOprah, singer Ciara and South African native Trevor Noah of the Daily Show congratulated Tunzi. “This gives me chills,” tweeted Ciara, noting the historic moment.\n\nThe excitement was palpable because most black folks are sick and tired of being sick and tired. They’re sick of going to work and wondering if someone is going to say good morning and mean it. They’re tired of seeing people who don’t look like them get ahead when they know people who look like them who are just as deserving. Some Louisiana black girls are sick and tired of being denied a spot in a school photo or participation in an activity because they have braids, another special hairstyle or some color in their hair. Working sisters put up with comments and questions about their hair as they see other women with more questionable hair decisions.\n\nThen Tunzi, Miss South Africa, was named Miss Universe, the third South African and the second black woman to hold that title. In major pageants this year, black women are wearing crowns. There’s Tunzi. Chesli Kryst is Miss USA. Kaleigh Garris is Miss Teen USA. Nia Franklin is Miss America.\n\nWe had Vanessa Williams as Miss America in 1984, the first black woman to be selected as Miss America. Carole Gist became Miss USA 1990. Janel Bishop was Miss Teen USA 1991. Miss Angola, Leila Lopes, was Miss Universe in 2011. None of that was the same because it didn’t happen the same year.\n\nThe selection of Miss South Africa meant a lot to her fellow nation sisters. My friend, Kay Pather, 72, said from her Durban home that she was \"filled with immense pride.\" \"Apart from her natural beauty, she represented her country with confidence and elegance,\" said Pather, a retired Montessori directress serving as an Anglican lay minister. \"What really impressed me was how poised she was in the interviews, and the confidence she gave to South Africans in general, and South African women in particular.\"\n\nThe news rocked sisters in Louisiana, too.\n\n“Black people have always known that black is not only beautiful, but also intelligent, talented, highly competent, and civically engaged,” said Sybol Anderson, 56, chief diversity officer at Loyola University New Orleans. The crowning of Tunzi shows that the rest of the world has begun to realize that fact too, she said.\n\nYolanda Campbell, an assistant professor of public relations at Southern University in Baton Rouge, follows such developments more strategically than some. She snapped a photo of Tunzi’s Instagram page, right after she was crowned, when she had 438,000 followers. That’s not a small number. Less than 48 hours later, the new queen of the universe had more than 2.2 million followers — and that number continues to grow.“ I wonder how many of those follows came from a black woman,” said Campbell. “Well, at least we know I was one.”\n\nCampbell, 40, is a native of Water Valley, Mississippi. Her mom was a part of the first integrated class at her high school when her mom was in 10th grade in 1970. Campbell was in high school when there was a Mr. and Ms. Water Valley High School student duo and a white Mr. and Ms. Water Valley High School student twosome. The homecoming queen was almost certainly white. Though she said she didn’t need this moment to confirm her own beauty and the beauty of her black sisters, “I’m glad to see that society is finally catching up to the fact that we are equally as beautiful as our counterparts …” Still, she’s down for the #BlackGirlMagic.\n\nTia Smith, 44, heads the mass communication department at Xavier University, and she’s an affiliate faculty member of the women’s studies and African American Diaspora Studies departments. She teaches “Black Women & Representation in Media.\" In her African American eyes, black women's “beauty lives in our curves, fullness of our lips, diverse hair textures and the cool way our hips sway rhythmically as we 'switch' down the road.” She’s celebrating these Four Queens in part because \"the pageant culture has finally acknowledged what we already knew — we don’t need to look white to be alright.”"
