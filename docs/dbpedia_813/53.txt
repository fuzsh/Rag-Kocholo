The first Black Miss USA was Carole Gist, now Carole Gist Stramler.

Gist first won the title of Miss Michigan USA and went on to win the Miss USA crown on March 2, 1990 in Wichita, Kansas.

Gist, a 5 ft 11 3‚ÅÑ4 in (182 cm) detroit native, 20 years old at the time, eventually became first runner-up to Mona Grudt of Norway in the Miss Universe pageant of that same year.

She is currently married with two children and works as an executive assistant for a construction company.
