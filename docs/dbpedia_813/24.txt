Michigan – three-time Miss USA winner

Michigan has won the Miss USA title three times, with Carole Gist‘s 1990 win making history as the first time an African-American won the title. Carole has stayed involved in the pageant scene and frequently attends Miss Michigan USA and Miss USA. Three years later Kenya Moore became Michigan’s second winner – and the second African-American titleholder. In 2010 Michigan made history yet again when Rima Fakih became the first Arab-American to win Miss USA.

Crossovers

Michigan has had the fewest crossovers (contestants who have held multiple Miss Teen USA, Miss USA, Miss America or Miss America’s Outstanding Teen titles) of any state. Kristen Danyal is the only titleholder to win both Miss Michigan Teen USA and Miss Michigan USA, making the semi-finals at both Miss Teen USA and Miss USA. Wa’Lynda Lou Sipple is the only other Michigan Teen to compete at Miss USA, representing Nebraska at Miss USA 1999. No Miss Michigan USA titleholders have competed at Miss America, and Che’vonne Burton, Miss MI Teen USA 1997 and Miss Michigan 2000, is the only Miss Michigan Teen USA to win a Miss America title.
