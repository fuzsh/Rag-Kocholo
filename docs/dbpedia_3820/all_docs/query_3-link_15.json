        "text": "As a marketer, I often find myself sitting down at my desk with a calculator to do some basic math. What am I calculating, you might ask? Well, I often try to find the total addressable market (TAM) for a topic to see if it’s worth covering in our content.\n\nCalculating TAM, Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) can be helpful beyond the realm of just marketing. Business owners can use these calculations to determine the viability of a business. Product teams can validate new product offerings.\n\nIgnoring these numbers can be detrimental. You could enter a market that doesn’t have a large enough market size to convince investors to back you, or you could set an unrealistic revenue goal for your business and burn your employees out.\n\nTo help you avoid these issues, I’ve put together a guide that’ll teach you exactly how to calculate your industry’s total addressable market, serviceable addressable market, and share of market.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTAM SAM SOM Definitions\n\nWhy TAM SAM SOM Matters\n\nHow to Use a TAM, SAM, and SOM for Your Business\n\nTAM, SAM, and SOM Template\n\nThese metrics are key components of a business plan, particularly as you craft your marketing and sales strategy, set realistic revenue goals, and choose to enter the markets that are worth your time and resources.\n\nBefore I break down how to use these in your business, let’s get clear on what TAM, SAM, and SOM are and their relationship with one another.\n\nTAM SAM SOM Definitions\n\nIf you’re new to TAM SAM SOM, it’s easy to feel like you took a wrong turn somewhere and landed in alphabet soup.\n\nBut, I want you to know that TAM, SAM, and SOM are simply overlapping metrics that make it easier to fine-tune your business plan, identify achievable goals, and understand the potential revenue and operational impacts of certain business decisions.\n\nSo let’s break them down.\n\nTAM (Total Addressable Market)\n\nTAM Definition: The maximum potential demand of a specific market.\n\nI know it can seem like finding this information can feel like a big task, so I’ll show you how to calculate TAM below.\n\nIn the meantime, to simplify it further, total addressable market or TAM refers to the total market demand for a product or service. It’s the maximum amount of revenue a business can generate by selling its product or service in a specific market.\n\nTotal addressable market is most useful for businesses to objectively estimate a specific market’s potential for growth. This data also helps companies figure out product market fit.\n\nSAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)\n\nSAM Definition: The size of the TAM you can reasonably target as you build your audience.\n\nDue to the limitations of your business model, which might include your specialization or geographic limitations, among other variables, you’ll have a tough time servicing your total addressable market.\n\nSAM is a segment of TAM you can use to identify the addressable potential of a market segment, or the amount you can realistically market to, making it easier to estimate revenue and audience targets.\n\nServiceable addressable market is most useful for businesses to objectively estimate the part of the market they can acquire to figure out their targets.\n\nSOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)\n\nSOM Definition: The size of the SAM you can potentially convert.\n\nUnless you're a monopoly, you most likely can’t capture 100% of your serviceable addressable market. Even if you only have one competitor, it would still be extremely difficult to convince an entire market to only buy your product or service.\n\nThat’s why it’s crucial to measure your serviceable obtainable market to estimate how many customers would realistically benefit from buying your product or service.\n\nServiceable obtainable market is most useful for businesses to determine short-term growth targets. It can also help with competitive awareness and strategizing.\n\nWhy TAM SAM SOM Matters\n\nTAM, SAM, and SOM are essential to business strategy and growth planning. This is because these metrics show how much opportunity a particular market holds at every stage of business growth.\n\nTAM SAM SOM is also useful because it’s a simple and succinct way to present the value of an idea. This data gives teams an idea of the target audience and income opportunities for a market or niche.\n\nThese metrics can also help businesses share key insights with investors if they are seeking funding. The process makes it easier to make decisions that impact growth.\n\nFor example, say you don't have a clear picture of the right segment for your SAM. This could make your serviceable addressable market too big, which can then impact your SOM.\n\n“In my experience, these tools are extremely informative when determining how to niche. Take the time, and understand the opportunity or lack thereof with your new target,” says Lori Highby of Keystone Click.\n\nHighby says as her team niches further in their business, they use numbers from market research reports from firms like Gartner, Forrester, etc. as well as government and trade associations to calculate TAM, SAM, and SOM. They can then “find out which niche is the most viable,” says Highby.\n\nHow to Use a TAM, SAM, and SOM for Your Business\n\nI know that all this sounds great, but it can be tough to understand how to actually do TAM, SAM, and SOM calculations and use the data for your business. So, let’s break this down into some steps you can follow.\n\nStep 1. Define your market.\n\nBefore you can do a TAM SAM SOM, you need to figure out what your market is, and what you’re marketing — a service, a specific product, or even a category of products.\n\nTo calculate this, get as clear and specific as you can about your audience, factoring aspects like:\n\nGeographic location(s).\n\nGender.\n\nAge.\n\nCharacteristics.\n\nProblem your offer solves.\n\nStep 2. Use a TAM calculation to find the total market size.\n\nNow, it’s market research time — dig in to find out how many potential customers are out there and the potential revenue value if everyone in that market purchases.\n\nFor example, if I’m looking at women between the ages of 25 and 65, I’d want to find out how many women fit that definition. Then, I’d calculate the potential revenue if all those millions of women bought your product.\n\nStep 3. Use a SAM calculation to find the size of your potential market.\n\nIn the example above, let’s say I work for a high-end luxury women’s professional clothing retailer looking at the U.S. market.\n\nSo, I want to find how many women fit the demographic of ages 25 to 65 in the U.S. and then calculate the potential revenue.\n\nStep 4. Use a SOM calculation to find your potential market share.\n\nPeople living paycheck to paycheck aren’t likely to shop my brand, and women who don’t work in offices or don’t regularly attend professional functions are less likely to be my target market.\n\nSince my SOM calculation is about estimating the portion of the SAM I can realistically market to, I might find it by refining my market by income and/or employment. I can then refine it further by identifying the portion of that market I’m likely to capture, given the competitive landscape.\n\nStep 5. Identify opportunities and challenges.\n\nNow that you have the calculation, it’s time to dig into the data and strategize. I’ll start by asking questions like:\n\nWhat is the market doing now?\n\nWhat do your competitors do well? Poorly?\n\nAny gaps in the market?\n\nAre there any segments of the market that aren’t being served?\n\nThen, when I’m armed with answers, I can think about strategies for standing out from the competition and leaning into my strengths to reach my market.\n\nTAM, SAM, and SOM Template\n\nNow that you know what each of these acronyms is and what they‘re used for, let’s get into the nitty-gritty of how to calculate TAM, SOM, and SAM.\n\nDoing so requires advanced market research ahead of time, but here are the formulas once you're able to get those figures.\n\nTotal Addressable Market (TAM) Calculation\n\nThe best way to calculate total addressable market is by running a bottom-up analysis of an industry:\n\nCount the total number of customers in a market.\n\nIdentify the average annual revenue of each customer in this market.\n\nMultiply the two numbers.\n\nTAM is useful for:\n\nStarting a new business.\n\nLaunching a new product, service, or product category.\n\nReviewing market strategies.\n\nRevising or revisiting your business plan.\n\nIdentifying opportunities to increase market share.\n\nExample TAM Calculation\n\nUsing our sample high-end professional women’s apparel for this calculation, I learned that the global women’s apparel market was US$1.002 trillion in 2023 (IMARC group).\n\nAssuming growth of 3.3% each year, we can estimate that number to be $1.035 trillion in 2024.\n\nServiceable Addressable Market (SAM) Calculation\n\nTo calculate your serviceable addressable market:\n\nCount up all the potential customers that would be a good fit for your business.\n\nFind the average annual revenue of these types of customers in your market.\n\nMultiply the two numbers.\n\nSAM is useful for:\n\nPlanning new marketing strategies and sales tactics.\n\nDoing market research and competitive analysis.\n\nDetermining product viability.\n\nExample SAM Calculation\n\nTo continue using our sample high-end women’s professional apparel brand, the U.S. women’s apparel market is $191.4 billion in 2024.\n\nRemember we were looking at women ages 25-65. Using data from the latest census, there are 86 million women in that range.\n\nLet’s say that each year, those 86 million women spend $2,000 on average every year on apparel.\n\n86 million x $2,000 = $172 billion SAM\n\nAnd looking at the numbers, we’re not too far off. The U.S. women’s apparel market is estimated at $191.4 billion in 2024.\n\nServiceable Obtainable Market (SOM) Calculation\n\nTo calculate your serviceable obtainable market:\n\nDivide your revenue from last year by your industry’s serviceable addressable market from last year.\n\nThis percentage is your market share from last year.\n\nMultiply your market share from last year by your industry’s serviceable addressable market from this year to find your new SOM.\n\nSOM is useful for:\n\nBudgeting for operations and marketing.\n\nCreating achievable, reasonable growth plans.\n\nDeveloping marketing and sales strategies.\n\nExample SOM Calculation\n\nNow here’s where we get more hypothetical. Because the TAM and SAM speak to total markets available, and SOM speaks to more realistic market share, we’re going to make up some numbers.\n\nOur high-end women’s professional apparel brand has a higher price per item but most customers are likely to buy fewer pieces, and we’re likely to have fewer customers than, say, Walmart.\n\nFor the sake of round numbers, let’s say\n\nWe have $500 million in revenue for last year.\n\nThe $172 billion SAM was 2023 numbers.\n\nThe $191.4 billion SAM is the 2024 growth.\n\nNote: I’m aware that these numbers represent unrealistic year-over-year market growth rates — I’m simply providing them for the purposes of showing you the calculations in action.\n\n$500 million / $172 billion 2023 SAM = 0.003% market share\n\n0.003% * $191.4 billion 2024 SAM = $574.2 million\n\nThat means, based on these completely fictional numbers that show drastically increasing demand, my fictional apparel company can reasonably expect 15% growth over last year.\n\nAnd if that’s accurate, it has significant repercussions for budgeting, operations, and production.\n\nBut unless there’s something drastic happening in the big picture that reduced spending in 2023 and increased it in 2024, there’s a good chance these numbers are not realistic, so it’s important to go back to the numbers to make sure we’re factoring in things accurately.\n\nRight Size Your Market Opportunities with TAM, SAM, and SOM\n\nWhen I started my marketing, TAM, SAM, and SOM felt like abbreviation-heavy jargon. It was easier to just nod along and let the numbers go in one ear and out the other.\n\nHowever, today, I know these numbers matter. I even run the calculations myself!\n\nAs you get started, keep in mind that these figures will largely be estimates to inform your strategy. The more market research you do and the more historical data you build up, the more precise your planning will be.\n\nDon't just figure out the opportunities in your market. Use your research to decide who you want to target and how you plan to engage them with your products. Then, use these templates to make your plans clear.\n\nEditor's note: This post was originally published in March 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness."
