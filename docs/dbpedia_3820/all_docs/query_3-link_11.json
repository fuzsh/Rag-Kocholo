        "text": "I have decided I was going to start out mapping the Civ Specific names for East Asia. Starting with Japan. One thing I noticed is that in this map I am using as reference, Sunchon and Kaechon need to be swapped. They are in the wrong places. Kaechon is north of Sunchon and Sunchon is along the river that Kaechon is currently placed on. So I would appreciate it if someone could go in and swap those two names. I know this map isn't 100% to date. But I am assuming all the cities are still used so I am renaming the cities to their Japanese Colonial equivalent.\n\nUsing the top map as reference (with the little edit of switching Kaechon and Sunchon) this is a map of Japan and all its colonies names (Note I also included a rename for Dailan and added the names for Karafuto) https://i.imgur.com/sboBbMz.jpg\n\nEdit: the picture is too low quality to read for some reason (Thanks Imgur)\n\nSo instead I will list all the changes city by city in reference to the previous map I posted\n\nKorea\n\nJeju -> Saishu\n\nBusan -> Fusan\n\nGwangju -> Koshu\n\nJeonju -> Zenshu\n\nSeoul -> Keijo\n\nDaegu -> Taikyu\n\nUlsan -> Urusan\n\nPohang -> Hoko\n\nDaejon -> Taiden\n\nGangneung -> Koryo\n\nIncheon -> Jinsen\n\nPyongyang -> Heijo\n\nSunchon -> Jungawa (Remember that Kaechon is North of Sunchon)\n\nKaechon -> Kaisen\n\nKanggye -> Kokai (It is spelled Kangye on the map but Kanggye is the correct Korean)\n\nHamhung -> Kanko\n\nChongjin -> Seishin\n\nTaiwan\n\nTaipei -> Taihoku\n\nKaohsiung -> Takao\n\nKarafuto (Sakhalin)\n\nName both tiles Toyohara for Japan\n\nChina\n\nDalian -> Dairen\n\nSo these names should be added for the Japanese Civ on those locations please. (I don't know how to do it myself, but I found the names for you guys!)\n\nHello! I will be making my own addition to this project!\n\nAustralian Aboriginal Cities:\n\nIf you play Aztec, Indonesia, Khmer, Kongo or Nubia, instead of seeing the modern city names, you will have the cities in Australia named after the Aboriginal tribe that are the historical custodians of that land. In the case of Aztec, Kongo and Nubia, choosing them to use the Aboriginal tribe names was due to their own tribal qualities, and would have more likely respected the Aboriginal rights to the land if they had settled Australia first. Indonesia and Khmer were chosen due to their proximity to Australia, which in a standard random game would give a good chance for these alternate names to be used. The other races, historically, are less likely to keep the tribal identities of a land they colonize. I am using the AIATSIS map of Indigenous Australia as a reference.\n\nHere is an example with Tasmania\n\nTo change the names for 1 civilization, here is the code format:\n\nOriginal:\n\nCode:\n\n<Replace Area=\"0\" CityLocaleName=\"LOC_CITY_NAME_NICOSIA\" Y=\"19\" X=\"77\" MapName=\"PlayEuropeAgain\"/>\n\nWhere LOC_CITY_NAME_NICOSIA represents the city of Nicosia, the XY values represent its tile, and PlayEuropeAgain is the map. 0 is the radius for which the area of the map is replaced with that city, so in this case it will only affect the 1 tile.\n\nNew:\n\nCode:\n\n<Replace Civilization=\"CIVILIZATION_GREECE\" Area=\"0\" CityLocaleName=\"LOC_CITY_NAME_SALAMIS\" Y=\"19\" X=\"77\" MapName=\"PlayEuropeAgain\"/>\n\nWhere Civilization_Greece represents the civ for affected by the change, 0 is radius of change, and Salamis is the name of the city that is changed.\n\nYou might also want to change adjacent tiles to Salamis, in which case you could continue:\n\nCode:\n\n<Replace Civilization=\"CIVILIZATION_GREECE\" Area=\"0\" CityLocaleName=\"LOC_CITY_NAME_SALAMIS\" Y=\"19\" X=\"78\" MapName=\"PlayEuropeAgain\"/> <Replace Civilization=\"CIVILIZATION_GREECE\" Area=\"0\" CityLocaleName=\"LOC_CITY_NAME_SALAMIS\" Y=\"20\" X=\"79\" MapName=\"PlayEuropeAgain\"/>\n\nAfter you're done, you'll need Game Text files for all the cities. This allows them to display differently depending on what language the player is using.\n\nCode:\n\n<Replace Language=\"en_US\" Text=\"Salamis\" Tag=\"LOC_CITY_NAME_SALAMIS\"/>\n\nwhere en_US is the language for which the tag is replaced with any city assigned LOC_CITY_NAME_SALAMIS is replaced with the name \"Salamis\".\n\nAdditionally, you can bypass the steps I mentioned above using this trick with gametext:\n\nCode:\n\n<Replace Language=\"en_US\" Text=\"Barcelona\" Tag=\"LOC_CITY_NAME_BARCELONA\"/> <Replace Language=\"en_US\" Text=\"Baršalūnâ\" Tag=\"LOC_CITY_NAME_BARCELONA_ARABIA\"/>\n\nwhere Barcelona will be founded as Barcelona for most civs, except for Arabia, which will found Barsaluna. This method is much faster but it is also means you are limited to the map constructed with the previous city names. It would be easier to stick with this, then make any extra edits to add in historic Japanese places/place names whose modern equivalent does not appear on the map you posted using the previous method.\n\nWhile working on the Aboriginal Australian names for cities, I was finding that some cities in the system was not intuitively in a position I would expect. The people who have done the work so far have done an amazing job, but we know that there is some tweaking that can be done.\n\nTo assist in this, I have created a image overlay for google earth that will place a grid that corresponds to the Giant Earth gridding. The North/south gridding limitations were set by using Hammerfest, Norway to the north and Ushuaia, Argentina to the south, ensuring the reference point to edge of map matched in both the Giant Map and the Real World Map. This gives us a range of 75 degrees north to 57.3 degrees south, with the point 56.5 s, 22 w corresponding to point 0,0 on the giant earth map.\n\nDue to inherit differences between the Giant Earth Map and the real world map, you will find discrepancies if you try to use it to relate cities on separate land masses. (look at New Zealand, for example, on the Giant Earth Map it is much lower south than on the real world relative to the edge of the map. This is most likely due to a squashing of south america on the Giant Earth Map, which I used as my southern reference point.\n\nBy using this grid, you can not only plot your cities, but figure out what potential neighboring tiles would be named and keep relative distances intact\n\nNote: I will create a smaller one that keeps proportions intact to the larger one for those that want to have more control over the grid placement\n\nEnjoy\n\nAttachments\n\nGiant Earth Grid.rar\n\nAnother small thing, to prepare for the Expansion and just because its an important city in General, I would trade out Pohang on the map of Korea for Gyeongju. Because it will be the capitol of Silla (And likely where they start) and Gyeongju is much more important than Pohang Historically (Seeing that it was the capitol of Silla, while Pohang is just a city that developed shortly after the occupation of Korea by the Japanese) I highly doubt even for a modern world map scenario that anyone will place a city over Pohang (More likely it will be Seoul and if they add another city, Ulsan/Busan)\n\nEdit: I would also extend the river on Busan to reach Gyeongju/Pohang as well If you look at a geographical map then rivers do go all the way up to the Gyeongju area, even if Gyeongju itself is not directly by a river. I don't want most people to waste a turn settling in Ulsan though because they don't have a river for a Gyeongju start.\n\nEdit2: added the text file with the Japan specific names for Korea if we change Pohang to Gyeongju (Use the Japanese name for Gyeongju instead of the Japanese name for Pohang, Gyeongju was more important than Pohang at the time as well)\n\nAttachments\n\nNewCiv6JapanSpecificNames.txt"
