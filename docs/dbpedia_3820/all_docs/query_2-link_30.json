It also looks for locations searched recently by other Apps running on your device.\r\n\r\nThe App also tries to provide name for a nearby place based on the location found.\r\n\r\nYou have options to:\r\n- tap on latitude or longitude to copy geo-cooridnates to clipboard.\r\n- save the coordinates with an associated place name for easy reference.\r\n- share the map location by message/mail.\r\n- display the online map for your identified location.\r\n- display and share the list of saved locations with friends.\r\n- edit, delete, restore the saved locations.\r\n- export your list of saved locations to a file or as an email attachment.\r\n- import locations from a previously saved file.\r\n\r\nThe app does not upload your searched, saved or current locations to any servers. The information you search is your private information and is meant to be shared by only you, the program does not have any logic to automatically share your information in background.",
