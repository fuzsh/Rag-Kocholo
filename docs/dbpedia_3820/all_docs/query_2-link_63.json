        "text": "We analyzed ionospheric parameters including the critical frequency of the F2 layer (foF2), the peak height of the F2 layer (hmF2), and the scale height at hmF2 (HT) from 2006 to 2012 (ascending phase of solar activity) at Hainan (19.5° N, 109.1° E, MLat. 9.7° N), Irkutsk (52.4° N, 104.3° E, MLat. 42.5° N), and Norilsk (69.2° N, 88.0° E, MLat. 59.8° N) stations (low, middle and high latitudes). We have used manual scaled digisonde ionogram data. Studies of foF2 and hmF2 di-urnal-seasonal variations continue those made earlier for East Asia. Features peculiar for the ascending phase of solar activity are mostly consistent to those for de-scending phase, except for the features of sunset and nighttime hmF2 variations. Features of annual and semi-annual variations recorded by a digisonde agree with those obtained by a satellite occultation and TEC map. We also obtained seasonal, diurnal, annual, and semi-annual variations of the ionospheric parameter HT (scale height at hmF2) from digi...\n\nCorrespondence Eugene O. Onori, Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Lagos State University, Nigeria. Email:onorieugene@gmail.com Abstract: Introduction: The ionosphere displays a wide range of variations ranging from diurnal, seasonal, annual and solar cycle variation. In this paper we present a study of the comparison of diurnal, seasonal and semiannual variation of the variability (VR) of the critical frequency of the F2 layer (foF2) over Ilorin (Lat. 8.47oN, 4.6oE, dip 4.1oS) in the African sector,Jicamarca (Lat. 11.9oS, Long.76.8oW, dip 1oN) in the American sector and Okinawa (26.3oN, 127.8oE, dip 36.8oN) in the Asian sector during solar minimum period. These stations lie within the equatorial anomaly region of the ionosphere. Aims: To compare the diurnal, seasonal and semi-annual variation of the variability (VR) of the critical frequency of the F2 layer (foF2) over Ilorin in the African sector, Jicamarca in the American sector and Okinawa in the Asian sector during sola...\n\nStudying the variabilities from day-today and from hour-to-hour of the ionospheric characteristics f,E, f,F2, M(3000)F2 and MUF(3000)F2 we have determined statistical factors related to the state of the ionospheric plasma in time and space. It is found that the variability from day-today is greater than the variability from hour-to-hour and that an \"intrinsic\" variability of the order of less than 4% remains even if we evaluate variability levels that are not exceeded for the 30% or 20% or 10% of the time for each month and year at each location. It is also found that a different amount of disturbances exists at different geographical zones (continents) and at the same zone it varies with latitude."
