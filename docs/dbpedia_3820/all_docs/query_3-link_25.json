        "text": "Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (referred to as “Samsung Electronics”, “Samsung”, “we”, “us”, or “our” in this policy), headquartered in South Korea, knows how important privacy is to our customers. We want to make sure you understand how we collect and use your personal information across all of our Samsung devices and services, from mobile phones and tablets to TVs, home appliances, online services, and more.\n\nWhile this Privacy Policy applies to all of our services, we will also provide additional information about privacy related to specific services where necessary.\n\nOVERVIEW OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nWe collect personal information that you provide directly, information about how you use our services, and information from third party sources. We use this information to provide you with services, understand how you use our services so we can improve and personalize your experience, and develop the most relevant apps, technologies, and content for our customers. We also use personal information to provide personalized advertising tailored to your interests, in accordance with applicable law.\n\nSHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nWe may share your personal information with affiliate companies of Samsung Electronics, as well as with companies that provide services on behalf of Samsung Electronics. We may also share your personal information with trusted partner companies, such as mobile service providers or insurance companies, that provide you with products and services that you request, as well as information about products and services you may be interested in. We may also share personal information with law enforcement agencies when it is required by law or to protect Samsung Electronics and its users.\n\nSamsung Electronics collects information from you in a variety of ways.\n\nInformation You Provide Directly\n\nSome Services enable you to provide us information directly. For example:\n\nWhen you create an account or profile with us, we ask for information such as your name, date of birth, or contact information such as phone number and email address.\n\nIf you order a product or paid service from us or through our Services, we ask for your name, address, contact information, and shipping and payment information to process your order. You can also choose to save your payment information with us so you can check out more easily next time.\n\nTo provide responses when you contact Customer Service, we ask for certain information to verify your identity and the product you are inquiring about.\n\nWhen you communicate with our Customer Service staff or others, your communications will be transmitted through our systems.\n\nIf you share your contacts, we will collect their phone numbers and other contact information to facilitate file sharing and messaging. You can turn off or restrict these features in the Settings on your devices.\n\nInformation About Your Use of Services\n\nIn addition to the information you provide, we collect information about your use of our Services through software on your devices and by other means. This information includes:\n\nDevice information: Your device hardware (such as the model and manufacturer) and software information (such as the operating system and software versions), IMEI number and other unique device identifiers (such as the mobile country code, mobile network code, MAC address, IP address, serial number, device unique IDs, advertising ID (e.g. for mobile devices, Google AD ID and for Samsung visual display devices, including Samsung Smart TVs, Personalized Service ID (“PSID”) and Tizen Identifier for Advertising (“TIFA”))), phone number, sales code, access recording, cookies, pixels and similar technologies (as described below in “Cookies, beacons and similar technologies”), subscription information, and settings of the devices you use to access the Services.\n\nLog information: Diagnostic, technical, error, and usage information such as the time and duration of your use of the Services, Services installed on your devices, search query terms when you enter search terms into your device in connection with a particular Samsung Service, any information stored in cookies that we have set on your devices, and error reports and dump logs.\n\nLocation information: Information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and, with your separate consent, your device’s GPS signal, may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services. In addition, for certain Services, zip codes or postal codes and inferred locations using IP addresses may be transmitted to us when you use such Services.\n\nVoice information: Recordings of your voice that we make and collect on our servers when you enable this function and use voice commands to control a Service are covered by the separate Bixby privacy policy. We also collect and store recordings of your voice when you contact our Customer Service team. Note that if we work with a third party service provider that provides speech-to-text conversion services or call center services on our behalf, this provider may also receive and store certain voice commands in accordance with the contract concluded between us and the trusted third-party service provider.\n\nSamsung Keyboard information: The words that you type when you enable “Predictive text”. This feature may be offered in connection with your Samsung account to synchronize the data for use on your other Samsung mobile devices. You can clear the data by going to the “Predictive text” settings.\n\nPublicly or Commercially Available or Shared Information\n\nWe sometimes gather publicly or commercially available information, including information from social networks you use, and combine this with other information about you so that we can better understand your needs, interests, and preferences.\n\nOther Information We Collect\n\nWe also collect other information about you, your devices, or your use of Services that you consent to send us. We obtain your consent in accordance with applicable law.\n\nThird Party Analytics\n\nThrough certain Services, we collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps, and other online features and services. We use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services help us to analyze your use of the Services and to improve the Services. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services, help administer the Services, and diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html and https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.\n\nYour Options\n\nYou can choose not to provide us with certain types of information, such as information requested as part of purchasing a product or service. In some cases, this may limit your ability to use some Services. We will do our best to explain these limitations when we ask for your information so that you can make an informed decision.\n\nWe, along with certain third parties such as content providers and advertisers, may also use technologies called cookies, beacons, or pixels, as well as other tools (collectively known as “technologies”) that communicate information from your device to a server. These technologies can be embedded in online content, videos, and advertisements. They allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular advertisement, and determine the time and date on which you viewed the content as well as information about your device, including the IP address of your device. We, and third parties, use these technologies for purposes such as verifying that content and ads have been delivered and viewed correctly.\n\nCookies\n\nCookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other devices. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:\n\nCookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter them each time you log on to a service.\n\nCookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. Studying this information helps us to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.\n\nCookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so you do not get the same ad each time you access a Service.\n\nCookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.\n\nWe may allow carefully selected third parties to place cookies or similar technologies on our Services. For example, and without limitation, we use Google remarketing tags to allow our retail partners to advertise products which you have browsed on our website. You can learn more about how Google remarketing tags work here: https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/. In addition, third parties such as Facebook may place cookies to track you across applicable websites and across other websites.\n\nWe may also work with carefully selected business partners to deliver advertising jointly. This may involve combining cookie data collected from our website with data collected by our business partner. We may also use information collected to understand our customers’ preferences and to influence future advertising campaigns including how we select who we direct our marketing to.\n\nWe, and our carefully selected business partners, may place cookies when we show ads for our products or services on third-party websites and when you click on those ads, so we know which sites and ads our customers have seen and which ads have been interacted with. You may be able to adjust your preferences in relation to these cookies on those third-party sites.\n\nThird party cookies: Our Services may also display content from a third party website or service, which may result in cookies from third parties being stored on your device. You can manage your preferences for these third parties in the same way as for Samsung cookies. Please see below for more details on how to manage your preferences. We do not control the storage and use of these cookies by these third parties, and you should refer to the privacy policies of the relevant third parties for more information.\n\nBeacons and Pixels\n\nWe, along with certain third parties, use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, ads, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, and determine the time and date on which you viewed relevant content as well as the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and, along with other information, to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.\n\nOther Local Storage\n\nWe, along with certain third parties, use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above. They are stored on your devices and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, visit http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.\n\nCookies are retained for no longer than necessary to provide the function for which they are used. This will vary depending on the specific Service. For example, a cookie to authenticate log-in may be kept for a longer period of time than a cookie used to allow you to place items in a shopping basket as a guest on our website.\n\nHow to manage your preferences\n\nWhere we use these technologies on our Services, you can manage your preferences at any time. However, some technologies are essential or necessary to run the Service and cannot be changed. Visit the settings or cookie preference menu on the relevant Services or on your device for more information on how to manage these options."
