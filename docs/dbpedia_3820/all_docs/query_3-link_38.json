        "text": "Many photographic images that are published to particular interests. This makes it more and more copyright piracy of images. In this study will make a tools and methods that can be used to protect the copyright of the digital image. The most important part of the digital image is a color image composition or texture images and EXIF metadata information contained therein. Image color and texture of the image reflects the beauty of the digital image. While reflecting the EXIF data information from digital image. In the science of cryptography many common cryptographic algorithms to secure data or information from copyright piracy. One of them is the eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm (XTEA) which is a cryptographic technique and operates in 64-bit block size and a 128bit key length. EXIF metadata in encrypted with XTEA, then insert it into End of File image, and delete the original EXIF, is expected to secure a digital image of the copyright piracy without changing primary data image. From the results of the encryption-decryption process, EXIF information and pixel digital image can be protected. There is a shrinkage of the size of the file capacity of-25.15% from size of original image, because image have a change in the type of EXIF metadata to JFIF format. This change only in bits header image, so that 74.85% of primary data bits are not changed.\n\nData and information security technique is a way to keep an object confidential. eXchangable Image File Format (EXIF) Metadata is data information about digital image. In the digital forensic investigation, this is very useful for copyright security or safeguarding digital evidence. Steganography and cryptography techniques have been widely used to overcome these problem. However, from the research that has been done in terms of security EXIF of metadata digital image photography, there are still some weaknesses. Among them is the depreciation of the digital image size after decryption. Since the standard EXIF metadata treatmens released by JEIDA and CIPA have different characteristic with JFIF metadata. A null value will be deemed to be the content with a value of 1 in EXIF standard. While in JFIF metadata model, the value of null is considered to be worth 0 (zero). This is make the EXIF metadata security process is shrinking of-25,15% from the original size. With the optimizing null value before encryption, the same metadata will be obtained between original image and after decryption. The null value will be replaced with an empty string (it's worth 1) before encryption. Results from the model obtained an average of-1,51% depreciation of the original digital image size.Therefore, this technique can optimize the digital image copyright protection. I. PENDAHULUAN Citra digital merupakan salah satu jenis barang bukti digital yang memiliki tingkat resiko manipulasi dan kehilangan informasi yang sangat tinggi. Data citra digital (metadata) memiliki informasi yang sangat kompleks, meliputi informasi perangkat pengambilan gambar sampai dengan waktu kapan diambil (Zhou et al., 2016). Sehingga dapat dikatakan metadata citra digital tersebut dapat digunakan sebagai hak cipta. Dalam ranah digital forensik, selain konten citra, metadata dapat digunakan sebagai barang bukti digital di persidangan. Mudahnya manipulasi dari sisi metadata dan konten citra inilah yang menjadi celah untuk melemahkan kedudukan citra digital sebagai alat bukti di persidangan. Banyak sekali cara untuk mengamankan metadata, mulai dari teknik steganografi, kriptografi sampai dengan watermarking. Kombinasi pengamanan eXchangable Image File Format (EXIF) metadata dengan teknik steganografi dan kriptografi juga telah dilakukan penelitian dengan hasil hampir sempurna dalam mengamankan metadata citra digital. Hal ini disebabkan antara citra digital asli, citra digital setelah dienkripsi, dan citra digital setelah dilakukan dekripsi, memiliki nilai histogram sama, serta dapat mengamankan keseluruhan metadata. Akan tetapi dalam penelitian tersebut, ukuran citra digital mengalami penyusutan sebesar-25.15%, sehingga hanya dapat digunakan sebagai perlindungan hak cipta citra digital saja. Untuk dapat digunakan sebagai perlindungan barang bukti digital, nilai hashing citra asli dan citra setelah dekripsi harus sama (Wijayanto et al., 2016). Penyusutan dalam penelitian tersebut dikarenakan perbedaan tipe header metadata citra asli dengan citra setelah dekripsi, yaitu eXchangable Image File Format (EXIF) menjadi JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) (Wijayanto et al., 2016). Ini disebabkan\n\n\"Since manned, airborne aerial reconnaissance for archaeological purposes is often characterised by more-or-less random photographing of archaeological features on the Earth, the exact position and orientation of the camera during image acquisition becomes very important in an effective inventorying and interpretation workflow of these aerial photographs. Although the positioning is generally achieved by simultaneously logging the flight path or directly recording the camera’s position with a GNSS receiver, this approach does not allow to record the necessary roll, pitch and yaw angles of the camera. The latter are essential elements for the complete exterior orientation of the camera, which allows – together with the inner orientation of the camera – to accurately define the portion of the Earth recorded in the photograph. This paper proposes a cost-effective, accurate and precise GNSS/IMU solution (image position: 2.5 m and orientation: 2°, both at 1 ) to record all essential exterior orientation parameters for the direct georeferencing of the images. After the introduction of the utilised hardware, this paper presents the developed software that allows recording and estimating these parameters. Furthermore, this direct georeferencing information can be embedded into the image’s metadata. Subsequently, the first results of the estimation of the mounting calibration (i.e. the misalignment between the camera and GNSS/IMU coordinate frame) are provided. Furthermore, a comparison with a dedicated commercial photographic GNSS/IMU solution will prove the superiority of the introduced solution. Finally, an outlook on future tests and improvements finalises this article.\"\n\nThis work presents a robust analysis of digital images to detect the modifications/ morphing/ editing signs by using the image's exif metadata, thumbnail, camera traces, image markers, Huffman codec and Markers, Compression signatures etc. properties. The details of the whole methodology and findings are described in the present work. The main advantage of the methodology is that the whole analysis has been done by using software/tools which are easily available in open sources.\n\nThe combination of GPS services and information technology is increasing with the use of geotagging now occurring as a default action in many commodity based devices functionality for example mobile phones and cameras. The camera in suitably enabled phones takes the picture and embeds GPS co-ordinates of the location into the metadata of the resulting image file. Furthermore there are now online services such as foursquare that are targeted at the geotagging or geocaching community. In addition to this overtly designed service other social online services such Flickr, Twitter are providing a means of geotagging users. This enablement of technology has significant and profound effects on bpersonal security and also extending into corporate security."
