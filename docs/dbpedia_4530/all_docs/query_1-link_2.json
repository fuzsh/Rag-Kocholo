Another major crime associated with the Italian Years of Lead was the 1980 bombing of the Bologna railway station, which killed 85 people and for which several members of the far-right, neo-fascist terrorist group known as the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari were convicted. Far-right terrorist organizations were also involved in various other bombings that resulted in the killings of multiple civilians, including the Piazza della Loggia bombing in 1974 which killed eight people and wounded 102 others. The terrorist organizations gradually disbanded, and police arrested their members throughout the 1980s. Sporadic political violence continued in Italy until the late 1980s, resurfacing to a lesser extent in the late 1990s and continuing until the mid-2000s.\n\nOrigin of the name\n\n[edit]\n\nThe term's origin possibly came as a reference to the number of shootings during the period,[35] or a popular 1981 German film Marianne and Juliane, released in Italy as Anni di piombo, which centred on the lives of two members of the West German militant far-left group Red Army Faction which had gained notoriety during the same period.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 1968 movement in Italy and Hot autumn\n\nThere was widespread social conflict and unprecedented acts of terrorism carried out by both right- and left-wing groups. An attempt to endorse the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) by the Tambroni Cabinet led to rioting and was short-lived.[36] Widespread labour unrest and the collaboration of countercultural student activist groups with working class factory workers and pro-labour radical leftist organizations such as Potere Operaio and Lotta Continua culminated in the so-called \"Hot Autumn\" of 1969, a massive series of strikes in factories and industrial centres in Northern Italy.[34] Student strikes and labour strikes, often led by workers, leftists, left-sympathizing labourers, or Marxist activists, became increasingly common, often deteriorating into clashes between the police and demonstrators composed largely of workers, students, activists, and often left-wing militants.[34]\n\nThe Christian Democrats (DC) were instrumental in the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) gaining power in the 1960s and they created a coalition. The assassination of the Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978 ended the strategy of historic compromise between the DC and the Italian Communist Party (PCI). The assassination was carried out by the Red Brigades, then led by Mario Moretti. Between 1968 and 1988,[31] 428 murders were attributed to political violence in the form of bombings, assassinations, and street warfare between rival militant factions.\n\nParticipating organizations\n\n[edit]\n\nFar-left terrorists\n\n[edit]\n\nRed Brigades (1970–1988)[N 13]\n\nFront Line (1976–1981)[N 14]\n\nOctober 22 Group (1969–1971)[N 15]\n\nPAC (1976–1979)[N 16]\n\nContinuous Struggle (1969–1976)[N 17]\n\nWorkers' Power (1967–1973)[N 18]\n\nWorkers' Autonomy (1973–1979)[N 19]\n\nSupported by:\n\nRAF[37]\n\nSigurimi (alleged)\n\nPLO (alleged)\n\nKGB (alleged)[38]\n\nStasi (alleged)\n\nMukhabarat el-Jamahiriya (alleged)[39]\n\nUDBA (alleged)\n\nFar-right terrorists\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Order (1957–1973)[N 20]\n\nNational Vanguard (1960–1976)[N 21]\n\nBlack Order (1974–1978)[40]\n\nNAR (1977–1981)[N 22]\n\nThird Position (1978–1982)[N 23]\n\nSupported by:\n\nPropaganda Due[41][42]\n\nSISMI (factions)[43]\n\nMagliana Gang[9]\n\nCIA (alleged)[44][45][46]\n\nGreek Junta[13]\n\nCosa Nostra (alleged)\n\nTimeline of events\n\n[edit]\n\n1969\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic protests\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hot Autumn\n\nPublic protests shook Italy during 1969, with the workers' rights movement and autonomist student movement being particularly active, leading to the occupation of the Fiat Mirafiori automobile factory in Turin.\n\nKilling of Antonio Annarumma\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 19 November 1969, Antonio Annarumma, a Milanese policeman, was killed during a riot by far-left demonstrators.[47][48] He was the first civil servant to die in the wave of violence.\n\nPiazza Fontana bombing\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Piazza Fontana bombing\n\nThe Victor Emmanuel II Monument, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro in Rome and the Banca Commerciale Italiana and the Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura in Milan were bombed in December.\n\nLocal police arrested 80 or so suspects from left-wing groups, including Giuseppe Pinelli, an anarchist initially blamed for the bombing, and Pietro Valpreda. Their guilt was denied by left-wing members, especially by members of the student movement, then prominent in Milan's universities, as they believed that the bombing was carried out by fascists. Following the death of Giuseppe Pinelli, who mysteriously died on 15 December while in police custody, the radical left-wing newspaper Lotta Continua started a campaign accusing police officer Luigi Calabresi of Pinelli's murder.[34][15] In 1975, Calabresi and other police officials were acquitted by judge Gerardo D'Ambrosio who decided that Pinelli's fall from a window had been caused by his being taken ill and losing his balance.[49][50]\n\nMeanwhile, the anarchist Valpreda and five others were convicted and jailed for the bombing. They were later released after three years of preventive detention. Then, two neo-fascists, Franco Freda (resident in Padua) and Giovanni Ventura, were arrested and accused of being the organizers of the massacre; in 1987 they were acquitted by the Supreme Court for lack of evidence.[51]\n\nIn the 1990s, new investigations into the Piazza Fontana bombing, citing new witnesses' testimony, implicated Freda and Ventura again. However, the pair cannot be put on trial again because of double jeopardy, as they were acquitted of the crime in 1987.[52]\n\n1970\n\n[edit]\n\nBirth of the Red Brigades\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Red Brigades were founded in August 1970 by Renato Curcio and Margherita (Mara) Cagol, who had met as students at the University of Trento and later married,[34] and Alberto Franceschini.\n\nWhile the Trento group around Curcio had its main roots in the Sociology Department of the Catholic University, the Reggio Emilia group (around Franceschini) mostly included former members of the FGCI (the Communist youth movement) expelled from the parent party for their extremist views.[34]\n\nAnother group of militants came from the Sit-Siemens factories in Milan; these were Mario Moretti, a union official, Corrado Alunni, who would leave the Red Brigades to found another organization \"fighter\", and Alfredo Buonavita, a blue-collar worker.[34]\n\nThe first action of the RB was burning the car of Giuseppe Leoni (a leader of Sit-Siemens company in Milan) on 17 September 1970, in the context of the labour unrest within the factory.\n\nGolpe Borghese attempted coup\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December, a neo-fascist coup, dubbed the Golpe Borghese, was planned by young far-right fanatics, elderly veterans of Italian Social Republic, and supported by members of the Corpo Forestale dello Stato, along with right-aligned entrepreneurs and industrialists. The \"Black Prince\", Junio Valerio Borghese, took part in it. The coup, called off at the last moment, was discovered by the newspaper Paese Sera, and publicly exposed three months later.[34]\n\n1971\n\n[edit]\n\nAssassination of Alessandro Floris\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 26 March, Alessandro Floris was assassinated in Genoa by a unit of the October 22 Group, a far-left terrorist organization. An amateur photographer had taken a photo of the killer that enabled police to identify the terrorists. The group was investigated, and more members were arrested. Some fled to Milan and joined the Gruppi di Azione Partigiana (GAP) and, later, the Red Brigades.[53]\n\nThe Red Brigades considered Gruppo XXII Ottobre its predecessor and, in April 1974, they kidnapped Judge Mario Sossi in a failed attempt at freeing the jailed members.[54] Years later, the Red Brigades killed judge Francesco Coco on June 8, 1976, along with his two police escorts, Giovanni Saponara and Antioco Deiana, in revenge.[55]\n\n1972\n\n[edit]\n\nAssassination of Luigi Calabresi\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 17 May 1972, police officer Luigi Calabresi, a recipient of the gold medal of the Italian Republic for civil valour, was killed in Milan. Authorities initially focused on suspects in Lotta Continua; then it was assumed that Calabresi had been killed by neo-fascist organizations, bringing about the arrest of two neo-fascist activists, Gianni Nardi and Bruno Stefano, along with German Gudrun Kiess, in 1974. They were ultimately released. Sixteen years later, Adriano Sofri, Giorgio Petrostefani, Ovidio Bompressi, and Leonardo Marino were arrested in Milan following Marino's confession to the murder. Their trial finally established their guilt in organising and carrying out the assassination.[56] Calabresi's assassination opened the chapter of assassinations carried out by armed groups of the far-left.[34]\n\nPeteano bombing\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 31 May 1972, three Italian Carabinieri were killed in Peteano in a bombing, attributed to Lotta Continua. Officers of the Carabinieri were later indicted and convicted for perverting the course of justice.[57] Judge Casson identified Ordine Nuovo member Vincenzo Vinciguerra as the man who had planted the Peteano bomb.\n\nThe neo-fascist terrorist Vinciguerra, arrested in the 1980s for the bombing in Peteano, declared to magistrate Felice Casson that this false flag attack had been intended to force the Italian state to declare a state of emergency and to become more authoritarian. Vinciguerra explained how the SISMI military intelligence agency had protected him, allowing him to escape to Francoist Spain.\n\nCasson's investigation revealed that the right-wing organization Ordine Nuovo had collaborated with the Italian Military Secret Service, SID (Servizio Informazioni Difesa). Together, they had engineered the Peteano attack and then blamed the Red Brigades. He confessed and testified that he had been covered by a network of sympathizers in Italy and abroad who had ensured that he could escape after the attack. \"A whole mechanism came into action\", Vinciguerra recalled, \"that is, the Carabinieri, the Minister of the Interior, the customs services and the military and civilian intelligence services accepted the ideological reasoning behind the attack.\"[13][58]\n\n1973\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimavalle fire\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Primavalle fire\n\nA 16 April 1973 arson attack by members of Potere Operaio on the house of neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) militant Mario Mattei in Primavalle, Rome, resulted in his two sons, aged 22 and 8, being burned alive.[59]\n\nMilan Police command bombing\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Milan police headquarters bombing\n\nDuring a 17 May 1973 ceremony honouring Luigi Calabresi, in which the Interior Minister was present, Gianfranco Bertoli, an anarchist, threw a bomb that killed four and injured 45.\n\nIn 1975, Bertoli was sentenced to life imprisonment: the Milan Court wrote that he was embroiled in connections with the far-right, who was a SID informant and a confidant of the Police.[15]\n\nIn the 1990s it was suspected that Bertoli was a member of Gladio but he denied it in an interview: in the list of 622 Gladio members made public in 1990, his name is missing.[60][61]\n\nA magistrate investigating the assassination attempt of Mariano Rumor found that Bertoli's files were incomplete.[57] General Gianadelio Maletti, head of the SID from 1971 to 1975, was convicted in absentia in 1990 for obstruction of justice in the Mariano Rumor case.\n\n1974\n\n[edit]\n\nPiazza della Loggia bombing\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Piazza della Loggia bombing\n\nIn May 1974, a bomb exploded during an anti-fascist demonstration in Brescia, Lombardy, killing eight and wounding 102. On 16 November 2010, the Court of Brescia acquitted the defendants: Francesco Delfino (a Carabiniere), Carlo Maria Maggi, Pino Rauti, Maurizio Tramonte, and Delfo Zorzi (members of the Ordine Nuovo neo-fascist group). The prosecutor had requested life sentences for Delfino, Maggi, Tramonte, and Zorzi, and acquittal for lack of evidence for Pino Rauti. The four defendants were acquitted again by the appeal court in 2012 but, in 2014, the supreme court ruled that the appeal trial would have to be held again at the appeal court of Milan for Maggi and Tramonte. Delfino and Zorzi were definitively acquitted. On 22 July 2015, the appeal court sentenced Maggi and Tramonte to life imprisonment for ordering and coordinating the massacre.[62]\n\nFirst murder by the Red Brigades\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 17 June 1974, two members of MSI were murdered in Padua. Initially, an internal feud between neo-fascist groups was suspected, since the crime had occurred in the city of Franco Freda. However, the murder was then claimed by the Red Brigades: it was the first murder of the organization,[34] which, until then had only committed robberies, bombings, and kidnappings.[15]\n\nPlanned coup\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: White Coup\n\nCount Edgardo Sogno said in his memoirs that in July 1974, he visited the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station chief in Rome to inform him of preparations for a coup. Asking what the United States (US) government would do in case of such a coup, Sogno wrote that he was told, \"the United States would have supported any initiative tending to keep the communists out of government\". General Maletti declared, in 2001, that he had not known about Sogno's relationship with the CIA and had not been informed about the coup, known as Golpe bianco (White Coup), led by Randolfo Pacciardi.[63]\n\nBombing of Italicus train\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Italicus Express bombing\n\nOn 4 August 1974, 12 people were killed and 48 others injured in the bombing of the Italicus Rome-Brenner express train at San Benedetto Val di Sambro. Responsibility was claimed by the neo-fascist terrorist organization Ordine Nero.[64][65][66][67][68]\n\nArrest of Vito Miceli\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral Vito Miceli, chief of the SIOS military intelligence agency in 1969, and head of the SID from 1970 to 1974, was arrested in 1974 on charges of \"conspiracy against the state\".[15] Following his arrest, the Italian secret services were reorganized by a 24 October 1977 law in an attempt to reassert civilian control over the intelligence agencies. The SID was divided into the current SISMI, the SISDE, and the CESIS, which was to directly coordinate with the Prime Minister of Italy. An Italian Parliamentary Committee on Secret services control (Copaco) was created at the same time.[69] Miceli was acquitted in 1978.[15]\n\nArrest of Red Brigades leaders\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1974, some leaders of the Red Brigades, including Renato Curcio and Alberto Franceschini, were arrested, but new leadership continued the war against the Italian right-wing establishment with increased fervour.[34]\n\nThe Italian government showed reluctance in addressing far-left terrorism. The ruling Christian Democracy party underestimated the threat of the Red Brigades, speaking of \"phantom\" Red Brigades, emphasizing instead the danger of neo-fascist groups. The Italian left wing also was less worried by the existence of an armed communist organization than by the possible abuses by the police against protesters, calling for the disarmament of police during street demonstrations.[34]\n\nThe year before, Potere Operaio had disbanded, although Autonomia Operaia carried on in its wake. Lotta Continua also dissolved in 1976, although their magazine struggled on for several years. From the remnants of Lotta Continua and similar groups, the terror organization Prima Linea emerged.\n\n1975\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 28 February, student and fascist activist Mikis Mantakas was killed by far-leftists during riots in Rome.[15]\n\nOn 13 March, a young militant of Italian Social Movement (MSI) Sergio Ramelli was assaulted in Milan by a group of Avanguardia Operaia and wounded in the head with wrenches (aka Hazet 36). He died on 29 April, after 47 days in the hospital.[34]\n\nOn 25 May, student and left activist Alberto Brasili was stabbed in Milan by neo-fascist militants.[34]\n\nOn 5 June, Giovanni D'Alfonso, a member of the Carabinieri police force, was killed by the Red Brigades.[34]\n\n1976\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 29 April, lawyer and militant of Italian Social Movement (MSI) Enrico Pedenovi was killed in Milan by the organization Prima Linea. This was the first assassination conducted by Prima Linea.[70]\n\nOn 8 July, in Rome, Judge Vittorio Occorsio was killed by neo-fascist Pierluigi Concutelli.[15]\n\nOn 14 December, in Rome, policeman Prisco Palumbo was killed by the Nuclei Armati Proletari.[34]\n\nOn 15 December, in Sesto San Giovanni (a town near Milan), vice chief Vittorio Padovani and Marshal Sergio Bazzega were killed by young extremist Walter Alasia.[34]\n\n1977\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 11 March, Francesco Lorusso was killed by the military police (the Carabinieri) at the university of Bologna.\n\nOn 12 March, a Turin policeman Giuseppe Ciotta was killed by Prima Linea.[71]\n\nOn 22 March, a Rome policeman Claudio Graziosi was killed by Nuclei Armati Proletari.[34]\n\nOn 28 April, in Turin, lawyer Fulvio Croce was killed by the Red Brigades.[15]\n\nOn 12 May, in Rome, 19-year-old student Giorgiana Masi was killed during clashes between police officers and demonstrators.\n\nOn 14 May, in Milan, activists from a far-left organization pulled out their pistols and began to shoot at the police, killing policeman Antonio Custra.[72] A photographer took a photo of an activist shooting at the police. This year was called the time of the \"P38\", referring to the Walther P38 pistol.\n\nOn 16 November, in Turin, Carlo Casalegno, deputy director of the newspaper La Stampa, was seriously wounded in an ambush of the Red Brigades. He died thirteen days later, on November 29.[15]\n\n1978\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 4 January, in Cassino, chief of Fiat security Carmine De Rosa was killed by leftists.[73]\n\nOn 7 January, in Rome young militants of Italian Social Movement (MSI) Franco Bigonzetti and Francesco Ciavatta were killed by far-leftists, another militant (Stefano Recchioni) was killed by the police during a violent demonstration.[73] Some militants left the MSI and founded the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari, which had ties with the Roman criminal organization Banda della Magliana.[15]\n\nOn 20 January, in Florence, policeman Fausto Dionisi was killed by Prima Linea.[73]\n\nOn 7 February, in Prato (a town near Florence), notary Gianfranco Spighi was killed by leftists.[73]\n\nOn 14 February, in Rome, Judge Riccardo Palma was killed by the Red Brigades.[73]\n\nOn 10 March, in Turin, Marshal Rosario Berardi was killed by the Red Brigades.[73]\n\nOn 16 March in Milan, the killing of Fausto and Iaio occurred. Nobody has ever been found responsible for the double murder.[74]\n\nOn 11 April, in Turin, policeman Lorenzo Cutugno was killed by the Red Brigades.[34]\n\nOn 20 April, in Milan, policeman Francesco Di Cataldo was killed by the Red Brigades.[34]\n\nOn 10 October, in Rome, judge Girolamo Tartaglione was killed by the Red Brigades.[15]\n\nOn 11 October, in Naples, university teacher Alfredo Paolella was killed by Prima Linea.[15]\n\nOn 8 November, in Patrica (a town near Frosinone), judge Fedele Calvosa was killed by the Unità Comuniste Combattenti.[15]\n\nKidnapping and assassination of Aldo Moro\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kidnapping of Aldo Moro\n\nOn 16 March 1978, Aldo Moro was kidnapped by the Red Brigades (then led by Mario Moretti) and five of his security detail were killed. Aldo Moro was a left-leaning Christian Democrat who served several times as prime minister; before his murder, he had been trying to include the Italian Communist Party (PCI), headed by Enrico Berlinguer, in the government through a deal called the Historic Compromise. PCI was, at the time, the largest communist party in Western Europe; mainly because of its non-extremist and pragmatic stance, its growing independence from Moscow and its eurocommunist doctrine. The PCI was especially strong in areas such as Emilia Romagna, where it had stable government positions and mature practical experience, which may have contributed to a more pragmatic approach to politics. The Red Brigades were fiercely opposed by the Communist Party and trade unions: some left-wing politicians used the expression \"comrades who do wrong\" (Compagni che sbagliano). Franco Bonisoli [it], one of RB's members who participated in the kidnapping, declared that the decision to kidnap Moro \"was taken a week before, a day was decided, it could have been March 15 or 17\".[34]\n\nOn 9 May 1978, after a summary \"trial of the people\", Moro was murdered by Mario Moretti with, it was also determined, the participation of Germano Maccari [it].[75] The corpse was found that same day in the trunk of a red Renault 4 in via Michelangelo Caetani, in downtown Rome.
