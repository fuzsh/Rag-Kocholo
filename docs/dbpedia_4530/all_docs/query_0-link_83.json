He became canon at Eichstätt in 1472, at Ellwangen in 1486, at Augsburg in 1498 (scholasticus, 1505), and in 1498 praepositus at St. Gertrudis. He was instrumental in obtaining books for Hassenstein and was the recipient of thirty-three letters from Hassenstein – the largest number written by Hassenstein to a single individual. In the letter of 9 June 1505 Hassenstein mentions the rumour current in Bohemia that Adelmann had refused the episcopal seat of Augsburg (on the death of Friedrich von Zollern). Adelmann travelled extensively: to France in 1486, to England in 1492 – when he brought relics to Henry VIII, to Rome in 1497 and to Holland in 1506. He was a member of the humanistic society in Augsburg and friendly with Peutinger and Pirckheimer. He edited works of older writers but was himself not a creative writer.\n\nADB, I, 79; XIII, 792.

This town which lies north and east of Wimpfen (modern Bad Wimpfen) is said to have been built by Poppo von Düren ca. 1298. Apparently members of the family arrived in Alsace in the mid-fifteenth century. According to Schott (#184), the family in Alsace at his time consisted of the brothers Gottfried (Götz), Sr., and Zeisolf, Sr., who married Schott’s sister Ottilia, Gotz’ wife (unidentified) and Gotz’ children, two of whom are named: Zeisolf, Jr., who inherited Götz’ property and Götz, Jr., who entered the Church. Schöpflin names two other sons of Götz: Georgius and Stephanus.\n\nKindler von Knobloch, Buch, 10. Schöpflin, Alsatia, 209. Wuerdtwein, 123.\n\n1. GOTTFRIED VON ADELSHEIM, SR. #184, #196(?)\n\nThe elder Gottfried (Götz) von Adelsheim, eques auratus, is documented in Alsatian records to 1489. No date of death is given, but an approximate date of death in late 1489 or early 1490 can be set, because Schott’s letter of condolence to Adelsheim’s son on his father’s recent death was written during that period (#184).\n\nAdelsheim was Landvogt of Alsace from 1458 until the year 1480. He also served as Hofmeister and councillor to Pfalzgraf Philip and fought in the siege of Geroldseck in 1486. In 1481 at the tourney in Heidelberg he received in fief the castle and villages at Wasselonne (Wasselnheim), situated in the Vosges foothills about mid-way between Strassburg and Zabern, and in 1483 he received in fief the castle of Klein-Arnsberg. Strassburg records contain many notations about quarrels, contracts, etc. concerning Wasselonne. In 1496 it was sold by Götz’ sons to the city of Strassburg.\n\nCastle Stettenfels in Untergruppenbach near Heilbronn was acquired by Adelsheim ca. 1480, and as owner of this castle he did service for Graf Eberhard of Württemberg. The family remained in possession of Stettenfels after the war of succession between Bavaria and the Palatinate in 1509, although for a time they had to share it with Conrad Thumb von Neuberg (the hereditary marshall of Duke Ulrich of Bavaria), Thumb and Zeisolf (Götz’ son) ruling jointly. After Zeisolf’s death, Thumb’s son Hans, who had married Zeisolf’s niece, became sole owner 1525-1527. Then the Hürnheim family owned Stettenfels until 1551 when they sold it to the Fuggers of Augsburg. Today lofty Stettenfels, in excellent repair, is still inhabited.\n\nBouchholtz, 43. J. R.

GOTTFRIED VON ADELSHEIM, JR. #184, #185\n\nFrom Schott we learn that Gottfried, Jr., a younger son of Gottfried, Sr., was doctor of civil and canon law and held the post of praepositus in Wimpfen. He was one of the claimants of Schott’s benefice.\n\nMeister, 151. Santifaller, 623. Dacheux, Réf., 352.\n\n3. ZEISOLF VON ADELSHEIM, SR. (†1503) #111, p. 131; #184, p. 203.\n\nZeisolf, Sr., was the brother (presumably younger) of Gottfried, Sr. Since he and his nephew Zeisolf, Jr., are often confused in records, it is difficult to differentiate between references to the one and to the other. He may be the Zeisolf von Adelsheim who is mentioned as bailiff of Ortenberg. As we know from Schott’s letters, he is the Zeisolf who married Ottilia, the third daughter of Peter Schott, Sr., and Susanna von Cöllen, after the death of Ottilia’s first husband Peter von Cöllen. In 1477 he became through his wife a citizen of Strassburg. After giving up this citizenship in 1479, he bought it again in 1484. In 1493 he had a plaque to himself and his wife erected in the church of St. André.\n\nGrandidier, Mélanges, 400. Inventaire, IV, 12, 37. Straub, 83, 85; Geschichtskalender, 285.

He received his A.M. degree in Louvain and studied in Paris. In the seventies he was in Italy. He spent several years in Ferrara and in 1476 was treated there for dysentery by his friend and compatriot Adolf Occo. By the end of 1480 he had returned to Germany, and it is possible that shortly thereafter he went to Heidelberg for a time (cf. N. 566). In 1482 he was in Antwerp. His letter congratulating Alexander Hegius on becoming rector of the Latin school at Deventer (“ut felix faustumque tibi eveniat”) was written in 1483 – incorrectly dated as 1473 by ter Kuile (11); indeed, his correspondence with Hegius may be responsible for Hegius’ introducing Greek at Deventer. Agricola was called to Heidelberg in 1484 by Johann Dalberg who had become bishop of Worms in 1482 and who had met Agricola at Pavia in 1479. (Adam Wernher* also arrived in Heidelberg in 1484). Here Agricola belonged to the circle of humanists around Dietrich von Pleningen, taught such persons as Celtis and studied Greek with Reuchlin. In 1485, with a delegation headed by Dalberg he went to Rome to greet the newly elected Pope Innocent VIII in the name of Pfalzgraf Philip (Agricola wrote the oration which Dalberg delivered). On the return journey he became ill and arriving at Heidelberg would not be treated by the local physicians but sent for Occo who unfortunately came too late. Others besides Schott wrote eulogies to Agricola, e.g. Occo, Hegius, Erasmus. The epitaph by the Venetian orator and patriarch of Aquileja Hermolaus Barbarus is quoted below:\n\nInvida clauserunt hoc marmore fata Rodolphum\n\nAgricolam Phrysij spemque decusque soli\n\nScilicet hoc uivo meruit Germania laudis\n\nQuicquid habet Latium, Graecia quicquid habet.\n\n(Pantaleon, 449f.)\n\nADB, 1,151-156, 781.

(ca. 1200-1280) #1\n\nAlbertus de Laugingen was born in Lauingen on the Danube, of a knightly family. He is called by Wimpheling “Suevus” from his native principality of Swabia; to his contemporaries he was known by the epithets “Teutonicus,” “Alemmanus,” “Coloniensis” and “doctor universalisa.” The epithet “magnus” occurs from the middle of the fourteenth century. Because of his knowledge of sciences, Greek and Arabic, Albertus (like his pupil Thomas Aquinas) became in folk saga a magician, miracle worker and master of natural forces. A member of the Dominican Order, he was professor of theology at Paris and Cologne and became bishop of Ratisbon (Regensburg). He was frequently in Strassburg.\n\nADB, I, 186ff. NDB, 144ff.

He held canonicates at Augsburg (1452-68), Bamberg (1474-78) and Cologne. In 1464 he was in Rome. In 1478 he became praepositus of the Strassburg cathedral chapter and soon thereafter was elected the seventy-eighth bishop of Strassburg, receiving the episcopal mitre in 1479. To raise money for repairing the episcopal palace at Zabern, badly damaged in the Burgundian wars, he obtained permission from Sixtus IV to allow the use of butter, eggs and fats during Lent to such persons as would pay taxes directly to him for the privilege. That he was interested in reform is shown by his calling in 1482 the first synod of the diocese since that of 1335 – Geiler opened the meeting – and by his sending Geiler, Johann Simmler, Christoph von Uttenheim and Melchior Kungsbach to tour the diocese to investigate the morals of the priests. Albrecht had sons “out of human frailty,” as Wimpheling puts it, but detested the public display of clerical concubines. Although he expelled the Jews from his diocese, he later allowed them to return. Contemporary accounts describe him as a gentle, patient man.\n\nNDB, I, 175. Dacheux, Réf., 33, 38f.

He worked in Venice as a printer, whence his other names Johannes de Venetus and Hans von Venedig von Emrebach. He also worked in Nürnberg under the printer Anton Koburger. In 1477 he came to Basel. He married Barbara Ortenberg, widowed daughter of a Basel councilor, in 1483, and in 1484 became a citizen of Basel. His sons (Bruno, Basilius and Bonifacius) studied at the Latin school in Schlettstadt. He was friendly with Reuchlin, Wimpheling, Leontarius and Pellican. Johann Heynlin who retired to the Carthusian monastery at Basel in 1484 corrected books for him. Amerbach was one of the first printers to use Latin type. His first printing is an almanac for the year 1478; his greatest piece of work is Reuchlin’s Vocabularius breviloquens. He edited Augustine and Jerome.\n\nADB. I, 398. NDB, I, 247. Hartmann, xixff.

BERNARD II (III), “THE BLESSED BERNARD” (1428/30-1458) #122, p. 141; #124, p. 143\n\nBernard was the son of Jacob I (one of the first scientifically educated Baden princes, praised by Piccolomini for his sense of justice and wisdom) and of Katherine, daughter of Charles I, duke of Lorraine. Sources disagree as to whether he was the second or third ruling Markgraf by the name of Bernard. In order to enter the Church and devote himself to religious pursuits, he abdicated in favor of his brother Karl I. Emperor Friedrich III called him to preach the crusade against the Turks at various courts. He died on the way to Rome in 1458. Pope Sixtus IV beatified him in 1481 and Clement XIV re-beatified him in 1769. Apparently there have been and still are moves to have him declared a saint.\n\nADB, II, 416. NDB, II, 109. Stadler, I, 462f.\n\n2. CHRISTOPH I (1453-1508) #20, p. 29; #41, p. 47; #46, p. 51; #56, p. 62; #60, p. 65f.; #62, p. 68; #73, p. 80; #87, p. 95; #101, p. 112; #118, p. 138; #152, p. 165; #175, p. 195f.\n\nChristoph was the son of Karl I († 1475) and Catherine, daughter of Ernst von Hapsburg and sister of Emperor Friedrich III. Until 1488 Christoph and his brother Albrecht (cf. below) ruled jointly. For his services in the rescue of Maximilian from captivity in Bruges, Christoph was made governor of Luxemburg. He married Ottilie of Katzenellenbogen with whom he had 15 children. His name appears among those of the princes attending the coronations of the Strassburg bishops Albrecht (1479) and Wilhelm von Honstein (1506). He was one of the delegation which escorted Maria Sforza from Mals to Innsbruck for her marriage to Maximilian I in 1494. His brother Karl (third son of Karl I) became bishop of Utrecht in 1496, and his brother Friedrich was archbishop of Trier, a position later held by his son Jacob (see below). He is described by Pantaleon as a man of rare piety and humanity and as being most kind to his subjects. At his death he left his principality to be divided among three sons (Bernard, Philipp, Ernst), an unfortunate move which plagued Baden with internal strife until 1515 when the law of primogeniture was passed.\n\nADB, XV, 228-233.

ALBRECHT (†488) #118, p. 138; #121, p. 140\n\nAlbrecht and his brother Christoph I had ruled Baden jointly since 1475, when in 1488 they were commanders of the imperial camp during the siege of Bruges to free Maximilian. In August of that year, at the siege of Damm in Flanders, Albrecht was killed.\n\nCode hist., II, 215.\n\n4. JACOB (1471-1511) #46, p. 51; #54, p. 60; #55, p. 61; #56, p. 62; #60, p. 65f.; #62, p. 68; #63, p. 69; #73, p. 80; #87, p. 95; #92, p. 104; #101, pp. 111f.; #103, p. 113; #175, p. 196.\n\nJacob, the eldest son of Christoph I, was early placed under the tutelage of Johann Müller. At the age of twelve, he travelled in 1483 with Müller to Paris, where – with the exception of a possible stay at Orléans – he studied until the summer of 1486, when he returned to Baden. Late in 1486 he and Müller left for Ferrara and Padua. After a trip home and a sojourn at Paris in 1488, they again went to Italy. From late October 1489 to February 1490 at least, they were in Rome, where Jacob had an audience with Innocent VIII. They returned to Baden in the summer of 1490. By Eastertide 1491 they were back in Rome. After Müller’s death there in August of that year, Jacob remained in Rome and became quite a favorite in Curia circles. His visit to Rome (1489-1490) was chronicled by Müller. Johann Burchard’s famous Diarium also mentions Jacob’s activity in Rome.\n\nWhen he returned to Baden in 1493, Jacob held benefices at Mainz, Trier, Salzburg and Augsburg. In that year he became coadjutor to the archbishop of Trier (his uncle Johann) and in 1496 he was made imperial chamberlain to Maximilian I. Because Maximilian felt that Jacob’s excellent training would be more useful as archbishop-elector than as ruling Markgraf, he persuaded Jacob to renounce his claim to Baden and accept the post of archbishop of Trier in 1500. Jacob was extremely well versed not only in liberal arts (he held the degree of A.M.) but also in jurisprudence, music, business and military affairs. Pantaleon reports how Jacob confounded his audience at the imperial diet in Cologne (1505), as he welcomed delegations in the name of the emperor, by addressing the French legates in French, the pontifical legates in Latin, the Venetian legates in Italian, and the German legates in German.\n\nAuct., III, 679.

When in 1471 Sixtus IV chose five cardinals to travel the various parts of Christendom for the purpose of calling Christians to fight against the Turks, Marcus Barbus was chosen to go to the German empire and to Hungary. He is recorded as being at Augsburg in 1474.\n\nDreher, XX, 39. Eubel, II, 15, 41.\n\nHOUSE OF BAVARIA\n\n1. ALBRECHT III (THE WISE) (†1508) #254, p. 287; #255, p. 291\n\nAlbrecht was the third son of Duke Albrecht II (†1460) of the Bavaria-Munich line and grandson to Duke Ernst of Agnes Bernauer fame. Upon the death of Albrecht II, the two elder sons, Johann and Sigismund ruled jointly. Johann died in 1463 and Albrecht who had been educated for the Church – he resigned as canon of Augsburg in 1468 – joined Sigismund in the rule. When Sigismund abdicated in 1467, Albrecht reigned alone over the objections of his younger brothers Wolfgang and Christoph who apparently were to share in ruling upon coming of age. Albrecht set about enlarging his domain. He regained the city of Regensburg which had been for centuries a free imperial city within Bavarian territory; in so doing, he aroused the anger of his father-in-law Emperor Friedrich III who wished to retain Regensburg as a separate entity in direct fealty to him. By winning the war of succession to the Bavaria-Landshut line in 1504, Albrecht reunited the whole duchy which had been repeatedly segmented since 1253. In 1506 he introduced the law of primogeniture, and on his death his eldest son Wilhelm IV succeeded him without opposition. Albrecht was well educated (proficient in Latin) and proved himself an able ruler.\n\nADB, I, 233ff. NDB, I, 157f. Aventinus, II, 601-60. Hämmerle, 15, 18, 154. Mon.

WOLFGANG AND CHRISTOPH #118, p. 138\n\nThese were younger brothers of Albrecht III. Like Albrecht, they were under age and unable to share in the rule at the time their father died, Wolfgang being but nine years old and Christoph apparently even younger. In 1464 the three brothers were taken to Italy. Wolfgang became a minor canon at Augsburg in 1458, but resigned in 1463. In the siege of Bruges to free Maximilian (1488), Wolfgang and Christoph (along with the Baden princes Albrecht and Christoph) were commanders of the imperial camp. Christoph died in 1493 on the island of Rhodes while on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.\n\nFor bibliography, cf. under Albrecht III above.\n\n3. JOHANN (†1486) #44, p. 49\n\nJohann, brother of Bishop Albrecht of Strassburg, succeeded the latter as praepositus of the Strassburg cathedral chapter in 1478 on Albrecht’s election as bishop.

This person may be identical with Hieronymus Perler/Berlem of Dinckelsbühl, who is recorded as being at the university of Bologna in 1473 and as receiving a doctorate there in 1475, and with Jeronimus Berler of Dinckelsbühl, who is recorded as being at Basel 1477-1478. If all these notations refer to the same person, it would appear that Schott met Berlin as a fellow student at Bologna and that Berlin, on finishing his study in Italy, came to the university of Basel.\n\nActa bonon., 218, 220.

He taught rhetoric and poetry at Pavia, Milan, Paris and Bologna, where he was from 1477 until his death. Most of his published works were dedicated to his German students, some of whom lived in his home.\n\nActa bonon., xxxi. Ellinger, 107ff. Mazzetti, 51.

Orator, poet, writer, preacher and philosopher, he is often called the last exponent of scholasticism. He developed the ideas of Occam and made a concise presentation of scholastic thought from the nominalist point of view; this scholastic writing had considerable influence upon Luther. After preaching for a time in Spires, he went to Mainz and appears to have been preaching there by 1462. At Mainz he held the post of cathedral preacher (established in 1465 by Archbishop Adolf I of Nassau), but it is not certain whether he was the first incumbent. While still at Mainz, he joined the Brethren of the Common Life and lived for a time in the house of the Brethren at Marienthal in the Rheingau. In 1468 he moved to Butzbach, where he became praepositus of the Brethren’s new house of St. Mark and also reorganized the local school. At the request of Graf Eberhard of Württemberg, Biel founded the first house of the Brethren in that principality at Urach in 1477 and became its praepositus in 1479. In 1482 he was invited (along with Reuchlin et al.) to accompany Graf Eberhard to Rome. In 1484 he was appointed the first professor of theology in the theological faculty at Tübingen and served twice as university rector (1485/86 and 1489). After 1489 he seems to have retired from academic life, and from 1492 he devoted his entire attention to the Brethren’s new house of St. Peter at Einsiedel in the Schönbuch (near Tübingen), where he is buried.\n\nADB, II, 622f.; X, 767.

Brusch, however, in his account of monasteries, which is later than Trithemius’ work, claims that Georgius Sperlin was abbot from 1467 to 1489 and was succeeded by Paulus Spreu who ruled 1489-1505. It would seem that Trithemius – himself a Benedictine abbot and a contemporary of Blasius – gives the more reliable information. This conclusion is supported by references in other contemporary material to Blasius, abbot of Hirsau, as one of the presiding abbots at a provincial meeting in Nürnberg (1489) and as active in the reform of the monastery at Schüttern and in the attempt to reform the abbey at Gengenbach.\n\nBrusch, Chronologia, 227.

He had given up his Strassburg citizenship in 1462 but bought it again in 1463. With Peter Schott, Sr., he headed the Strassburg troops fighting against Charles the Bold. At the request of the city council of Strassburg he arbitrated a dispute involving Pfalzgraf Philip and the rights to the town of Türckheim in 1485. In the same year and also in 1486, Bock and Schott. Sr., were delegates from Strassburg to the imperial diet at Frankfurt. Bock, his cousin Ulrich Bock, and Dr. Jacob Merswin fought in the Strassburg contingent before Ghent in 1488, where Ulrich was drowned. Bock held various properties in and around Strassburg, and is frequently mentioned in Strassburg records.\n\nGrandidier, Mélanges, 401. Hatt, Ville, 48. Hertzog, 228.

VLADISLAUS, KING OF BOHEMIA (LADISLAUS, VRATISLAUS, WLADISLAUS) (†1516) #110, p. 122; #171, p. 192\n\nVladislaus, son of Casimir king of Poland, was elected by the Bohemian nobles of the national party as king of Bohemia in 1471, defeating Matthias of Hungary who had already been proclaimed king of Bohemia by the nobles of the party adhering to Rome. Desultory warfare between Vladislaus and Matthias ended with the treaty of Olmütz in 1478. Under Vladislaus’ rule the power of the nobles grew at the expense of the royal prerogative and of the rights both of townspeople and free peasants who for the first time were reduced to serfdom.\n\nAt the death of Matthias in 1490, Vladislaus was elected King Vladislaus II of Hungary. Vladislaus was even less successful as a ruler of Hungary than of Bohemia. “The personification of helpless inertia,” he was a mere puppet of the Magyar oligarchs and was dubbed “King All Right.” During his reign, Matthias’ structure, which had made Hungary the most powerful central European state, crumbled and the country retrogressed several hundreds of years.\n\nEB, IV, 127f.; XIII, 908ff.

(†1510) #54, p. 59; #143, p. 158; #226, p. 254.\n\nA famous and learned preacher of the Franciscan Order, Bondorf came from a noble family in Villingen in the Black Forest. He received his A.M. at Padua in 1482 and before 1484 became doctor of theology (place unknown). The Franciscan school at Strassburg, in which he taught, had a high reputation and Bondorf was one of its finest teachers. Murner, one of his pupils, praises his enthusiasm and his solicitude for his pupils. Bondorf held various posts in his order in Strassburg: baccalaureus, 1479; discretus discretorum, 1482; vicar, 1483; lector, 1489. He served as the twenty-seventh provincial of the Alsace Franciscans 1498-1510. On chapter business he visited Rome in 1479, Brescia in 1482 and Assissi in 1491. At the Strassburg chapter meeting of 1484, he was chairman of the “sollemnis et publica cathedralis disputatio” and preached at a disputation in the university of Freiburg 1484. He is mentioned as “Ehrenrat” of that university in 1492. He left many manuscripts and books to the church library of his native Villingen. Jacob Sprenger, provincial of the Dominicans, reputed to have been the most learned (if misguided) man of his age, had the courage to say about the provincial of the Dominicans’ traditional enemies that he had seen “neminem Conrado de Bondorf doctiorem et subtiliorem.”\n\nBauer, 36, n. 153.

The pope (Innocent VIII) refused to confirm the appointment and insisted that the chapter put aside Brandis in favor of his own candidate Hieronymus (Hoyer) von Barby-Mulingen. The ensuing legal battle between the chapter and the pope ended in the chapter’s capitulation 1491 and the installation of Barby. Brandis was a fellow student of Peter Schott at Bologna. In 1482 he became canon and praepositus of the cathedral of Chur. His name appears on the lists of “Anima” members who participated in papal processions.\n\nActa bonon., 222. Dacheux, Eccl.

An ancestor Diebolt Brant, whom Kindler von Knobloch mentions as knight and founder of the family, gave up his mill at Spires to answer Emperor Sigismund’s call to arms against the Turks (1398); from him stem the epithet “Spirer” (“Brand genannt Spirer”) and the mill-wheel in the Brant coat-of-arms. Brant’s brother Matthias was a printer in Strassburg (Voulliéme, 114f.).\n\nBrant’s name does not occur on the list of famous alumni of the Schlettstadt school; nor, for that matter, does Reuchlin’s, although GGr2 (I, 413) mentions Reuchlin as having studied under Dringenberg at Schlettstadt. Perhaps neither Brant nor Reuchlin completed the course of study at Schlettstadt and were therefore not considered bonafide alumni. Whatever the reasons for such omission, there are strong indications that Brant did attend the school and that he was there at the same time as Peter Schott, who was about two years younger.\n\nReplying in December 1478 to a letter from Brant, Schott (#10, p. 17) quotes Brant’s admonishment to him that he preserve the friendship they began at an early age (“abineunte aetate”). Since Schott from about age six to eleven was at Schlettstadt and then went to Paris and Bologna, he spent scarcely enough time in Strassburg to develop a friendship which could continue through adolescence into young manhood. And since Brant did not go to Paris or Bologna, one must conclude that the only place where the two lads could have associated for a considerable length of time was Schlettstadt.\n\nIn his poem to the chapter members of the principal church at Baden-Baden (Varia carmina, published 1498, folio h. 7), Brant expresses deep affection for one of the chapter’s deans, whom he calls his doctor, his “teacher” and his “first nourisher.” We know that the dean was Johann Müller, and that he became Schott’s tutor when Schott was a small child and accompanied Schott to Schlettstadt, to Paris and to Bologna. The one place where Brant during his formative years could have had close contact with Müller over a longer period was Schlettstadt. In fact, Müller may have become tutor to both lads in Strassburg and gone with them to Schlettstadt.\n\nSchmidt also believes that Brant attended the school at Schlettstadt, but his assumption that Brant went to school to Müller at Baden-Baden has no basis in fact, because Müller did not become dean of Baden-Baden until very late 1478 or early 1479, and by that time Brant had been at the university of Basel for almost four years.\n\nFrom the entry in the university of Basel matriculation records that Brant paid no fees because he was a servitor (“Sebastian Brant de Argentina nichil quia servitor. Solvit 1475/76”) and from the length of time he spent acquiring his education, it is apparent that he – like Müller and Reuchlin – was an impecunious student who could attend university only in the employ of his wealthier fellows and therefore progressed more slowly, often having to interrupt his studies when his employer left. Wackernagel (I, 137) suggests that Brant was employed by Jacob Hugonis.\n\nAs indicated in the quotation from Basel matriculation records above, Brant was studying at Basel by 1475. Here he met Geiler and in 1477 received his A.B. degree. He was at Padua in 1480; then he returned to Basel to take his licentiate in law (1483) and his doctorate in civil and canon law (1489). He was professor of law and poetry at Basel and in 1492 served as dean of the law faculty. In 1494 – at Geiler’s request – he moved to his native Strassburg. He was syndicus to the city of Strassburg 1499-1501 and 1503-1521 secretary to the city council. In 1502 he became imperial councillor to Maximilian I. He had married Elizabeth Burg while still in Basel and had several children. His eldest son Onophrius studied at Basel, Paris and Freiburg and was in service to the city of Strassburg (Wackernagel, I, 221); he also wrote German poetry in the style of his father but never became a poet of note.\n\nBrant’s famous Narrenschiff, on which Geiler preached a series of sermons, appeared at Strassburg in 1494. His many other writings include poems, epigrams, odes to the Virgin, the Annales of Strassburg (in Dacheux, Fragments, IV, part x) and a legal work Titulorum omnium juris tam civilis quam canonici expositiones which was obviously written for his students, as was the Modus studendi. One of the epitaphs to Geiler in the Strassburg cathedral is by Brant. Besides all his other activities, Brant had time for a tremendous amount of editing; Schmidt’s bibliographical index devotes 33 pages to Brant’s editions of other writers’ works (H.L., II, 340-373).\n\nADB, III, 256-259.

He lectured on the Bible at Paris in 1494 and served as receptor of his nation in 1500. In 1499 he left Paris for a short stay in Freiburg, where he is registered as “master of arts.” He must have made a good impression in Freiburg, for he was called there to teach in the faculty of arts in 1502 and by 1504 he was professor and dean of theology.

A Friedrich Büchsner is recorded as repeatedly buying and relinquishing his Strassburg citizenship from 1463 to 1469; he may be the father of our Büchsner.\n\nBüchsner accompanied Schott on the second trip to Bologna in 1479 and was living with Schott when he suddenly left for a visit to Rome in March of 1480. He and Hassenstein became great friends. When Hassenstein, on finishing his studies at Ferrara in 1482, returned to Bohemia via Strassburg, Büchsner seems to have gone with him. At least by 1485 he was in Bohemia and remained there except for visits to Strassburg and the months spent travelling with Hassenstein on the “grand tour” to the Near East. One of his chief interests was birds. He died of a fever in 1492. Hassenstein, deeply grieved, composed the following epitaph to him:\n\nQui mecum Syriam, Lybiaeque calentis arenas\n\nVidisti, et Nilum, palmiferasque Arabas,\n\nHic te, care comes, miserando funere raptum,\n\nHic, Friderice, brevi condidimus tumulo.\n\nActa bonon., 227.

Because of a scandal about his falsifying documents and stealing, Burckard left Strassburg and went to Rome in 1467. Here he soon became a familiar of Cardinals Marcus Barbus (Barbo) and Johannes Arcimboldi. For a time he was in the service of Thomas Vincenzi, general treasurer of the Holy See. He studied law and theology, presumably at the university of Rome, and seems to have acquired the degree of doctor of decretals and to have entered the priesthood. In 1475 he became a favorite of Sixtus IV (to whom he confessed his early sins) and the way to his rapid advancement at the Curia was open: papal acolyte and chaplain; abbreviator of apostolic letters (1478); apostolic protonotary (1481); master of ceremonies to the pope (1483), for which post he paid 450 gold ducats; member of the pope’s immediate family, i.e., taking meals with the papal servants, etc. (1484). Three weeks before his death he paid 2040 ducats to become papal referendar and abbreviator de parco minori.\n\nDuring these years Burckard was busily piling up benefices. In 1478 he was already drawing a small pension from a canonicate and prebend at St. Thomas in Strassburg although he did not hold a canonicate and prebend there until 1479. In 1477 he acquired a prebend at Piacenza; in 1479 he became canon of St. Thomas, as well as canon, provost and dean of St. Florentius at Haslach. In 1482 he received benefices in Basel, Strassburg and Metz. From 1482 to 1489 he was involved in a contest for the deanship of St. Thomas (Strassburg) which he finally acquired with the help of the pope and the resignation of Johann Simmler. In 1484 he received a canonicate and prebend at Old St. Peter (Strassburg) and resigned a similar benefice at St. Thomas (Strassburg). In the same year Innocent VIII gave him a benefice at Bamberg. In 1485 he acquired the office of scholasticus at St. Thomas. In 1490 he gained various posts at the Strassburg cathedral and began his fight for the canonicate at New St. Peter (left vacant by Schott’s death); this benefice he won after six years. In 1503 he was made bishop of Orta and Civita Castellana (i.e., a suffragan bishop).\n\nBurckard became a member of Santa Maria de Anima in 1489 and was made master of ceremonies there in 1494; later he was instrumental in promoting the rebuilding of the “Anima” church. He was often in Strassburg: in 1477, when he bought Strassburg citizenship; in 1481, when Schott sent money by him to Maeler; in 1489; in 1490, when he represented St. Thomas in a lawsuit vs. Johann von Sickingen of the diocese of Worms. As procurator and lawyer at the Curia he was involved in the establishment of the chair at the Strassburg cathedral and represented Thomas Wolf, Jr., in the case vs. Engelhard Funck.\n\nBurckard was also a writer. He carried on correspondence with German humanists, such as Mutianus Rufus; he wrote the ritual of the mass (1502) and helped correct the Liber Pontificalis (1485-97). His most famous – or infamous – work is his Diarium in which he kept a detailed record of all events at the Holy See from 1483 to 1506. For several centuries the contents of the Diarium were considered too scandalous to be published in full and only excerpts were made. An almost complete edition by Thuasne appeared in Paris 1883-1885. Burckard died in 1506, having faithfully served five popes: Sixtus IV, Innocent VIII, Alexander VI, Pius III, and Julius II.\n\nADB, XLVII, 377. NDB, III, 34. Dacheux, Réf., 116, 124.

In the fifteen years of his meteoric reign – cut short by his assassination in 1419 – the Orléans-Burgundian rivalry for control of France came to a head. In 1407 John had Louis, duke of Orléans, murdered; the city of Paris was in turn terrorized by Armagnacs (Orléans’ faction) and Burgundians; the English under Henry V, aided and abetted by John, conquered large portions of French territory; and the principality of Liège came under the protection of Burgundy.\n\n2.

In 1489 he became protector general of the Dominican Order. A theologian, jurist, politician, and a man of great wealth, he was a patron of scholars and himself studied Roman antiquities.\n\nDacheux, Réf., 413. Eubel, II, 14, 41, 44. Pastor, II, 288.

(Notes to these items contain considerable information).\n\nOriginally an Alsatian foundation begun in 1233, the Dominican convent of St. Leonard was moved in 1273 to Klingenthal near Basel and changed its name to Clingenthal. It became one of the richest convents, with holdings in Alsace and in the Breisgau; and it counted among its benefactors nobles, dukes of Austria, kings, emperors and popes. Its inmates were noble ladies of wealth who had not found in the world a place befitting their rank. During the fourteenth century the convent flourished, but in the fifteenth century decadence set in. Attempts to bring Clingenthal to a stricter way of life began before 1429 when Johann Nider of Nürnberg was sent by the master of the Dominican Order, Bartholomeus Texery, to ask the aid of the Basel city council in reforming the convent. Although Pope Martin V wrote to the city council, to the bishops of Basel, Constance and Strassburg, as well as to the Markgraf von Rateln, urging the reform, resistance from the city council and the convent was so strong that the attempt was abandoned. An attempt in 1462 by Johann Kreutzer, at the request of Pius II and the Basel city council, also failed.\n\nIn 1480 Sixtus IV sent Jacob Stubach, the Dominican Provincial to reform Clingenthal. To aid him in his work, Stubach brought to the convent with him thirteen nuns from the reformed convent of Engelspforten at Gebweiler, whom he placed in charge. Only two of the Clingenthal ladies accepted the new order; the other 39 protested, fought and schemed until finally in 1482 they won for their cause (with money) Archduke Sigismund of Austria, despite the plea of Nicolaus von Flüe (q.v.). At a conference attended by Oswald von Dyrstein (representing Sigismund), the Bürgermeister of Zürich and other notables, it was decided that the newcomers had to go, that the convent should be detached from the Dominican Order, and that the Order be recompensed with a payment of 12,500 crowns. The sisters from Engelspforten and their converts were thus after nearly three years of labor forcibly expelled; for a long time they wandered about homeless, living from alms and forgotten by those who had brought them to such straits.\n\nIn 1485 Christoph von Uttenheim bought a retreat, Santa Maria in Obersteigen near Wasselonne, for the ejected nuns. This gift was authorized in 1487 by Innocent VIII who also restored all privileges to the nuns. In 1507, however, as the nuns could not make a living at Obersteigen, they gave the retreat to Bishop Wilhelm von Honstein of Strassburg and went to the convent at Gnadental in the bishopric of Constance.\n\nThe Clingenthal ladies who would not reform became Augustinians. During the years 1525-1555 many became Lutherans; fourteen of them threw away their habits and married apostate priests or men of the lower classes.\n\nBarthelmé, 114f. Barth, Handbuch, 611f.

The first Cöllen mentioned is the founder of the family Rudolfus Coloniensis who came apparently from Cologne and settled in Strassburg in 1202. In the church of St. Thomas there was at one time a plaque with the inscription “Katharina Kölle, uxor Jacobi Mug [the elder] † 1470,” and in the church of the convent St. Nicholas in Undis there was a painting (cf. biography of Peter Schott, Sr.), under two figures of which appeared the names “Susanna von Coin” and “Margrede von Cöln.” The third daughter of the Schotts, Ottilia, married a Cöllen, whose first name Straub gives as Peter and Kindler von Knobloch gives in one account as Peter and in another as Jacob; the daughter of this marriage, Ottilia Cöllen, is the last Cöllen mentioned in documents.\n\nGrandidier, Mélanges, 381.

SUSANNA VON CÖLLEN (†1498) p. xxiv; #1; #6-#193, passim; #297, p. 320\n\nLittle is said of Susanna von Cöllen, but one may imagine that as the mother of five children, as the wife of Strassburg’s foremost citizen and mistress of the Schott home, she led a busy and varied life. To the Schott home came visiting dignitaries like Emerich Kemel, family friends like Johann Widmann and friends of young Peter like Bohuslaus von Hassenstein and Walter Halewin. Even after young Peter became canon, he lived at home and his protégés were part of the family. Susanna von Cöllen was evidently fond of these lads and remembered them after they were sent off to school. The Schott daughters and grandchildren were in and out of the house; some of them seem to have stayed for long periods. To have had time and energy left from the demands of her household for worthwhile contributions to affairs in the church, for herbology and for other interests Susanna von Cöllen must have been indeed an intelligent and capable woman.\n\nDacheux, Réf., 23, 285f.

Until 1461 he had a benefice at St. Agnes in Strassburg. He acquired the post of perpetual chaplain at St. Georg in Ruprechtsau in 1462. Two years later he became a citizen of Strassburg and in 1465 he secured a chaplaincy at St. Thomas. During 1476 he was active in the unification of the convents Sts. Agnes and Margaret, et al. He was praepositus of Surburg when in 1478 he visited Rome as a member of a Strassburg delegation to the Curia.\n\nBarth, Handbuch, 1558. Kindler von Knobloch, Buch, 58. Meister, 111, 120f., 142f.

He taught canon law at Bologna 1475-1506 and was one of Schott’s professors. In 1494 he corresponded with Isabella d’Este. His pupil Nicolaus Burtius writes of him: “Sic Florianus Dulfus, triplici scientiarum gradu jugatus, nec laboribus nec vigiliis parcens, me suis limitationibus consiliisque jura interpretando non desinit illustrare, quinimo et aedificiorum superbia decorare.”\n\nCosenza, II, 1240 (date of death appears erroneously as 1656). “Rotoli” (1471-72, 1475-79). “Liber Secretus iuris pontificii,” f. 148 and passim.

He studied under Thomas à Kempis at the school of the Brethren of the Common Life at Zwolle (also at Deventer?); then he apparently went to Cologne and Paris before matriculating at Heidelberg in 1430, where he received his A.B. degree in 1432. It may be true that students from Schlettstadt who were studying with Dringenberg at Heidelberg were instrumental in bringing him to the school at Schlettstadt as rector. Certainly it cannot be true, as Hammelmann claims, that Rudolf Agricola was responsible for Dringenberg’s coming to Schlettstadt, for – as Röhrich points out – Agricola was not born until 1442 (and this is the earliest possible date for his birth). There can be no question that Dringenberg began his work at Schlettstadt in 1441; according to Hieronymus Gebweiler, himself a later rector at the school, Dringenberg had served 36 years (“so aida Schul gehalten und mit grossem Lob regiert”) when in 1477 he was succeeded by Crato Hoffmann. He died in 1490, probably in the late summer, for on 6 September Peter Schott promised Hoffmann he would write an epitaph for his former master.\n\nADB, V, 411-412. Dacheux, Réf., 443.

Heinz Dunzenheim served in the Strassburg city council 1331. Conrad was mayor of Strassburg in 1484. He had made two visits to the Holy Land and was on his way for a third visit when he died at Venice in 1486. This is the Conrad whom Procurator Rot defamed.\n\nA younger Conrad, perhaps son of the above Conrad, attended the university of Heidelberg in 1483, wrote a chronicle to 1495 and served three times as mayor of Strassburg (1505-1529); he also died in Venice.\n\nBarth, “Pilger”, 176.

Adelberg, founded as a priory in 1173 and made an abbey in 1440, was the last Swabian double convent (that is, its inmates were both monks and nuns) in Württemberg, and it was during Dürr’s term of office that the nuns were sent in 1475 to the convent at Lauffen (on the Neckar), at the insistence of Graf Ulrich “der vielgeliebte” of the Württemberg-Stuttgart line, an ardent reformer. Dürr collected and edited the liturgical books of the Premonstratensians and had them printed at Strassburg; they were used for years in Swabian monasteries. The breviary mentioned by Schott was without doubt one of these liturgical books. A contemporary Premonstratensian calls Dürr: “abbatem boni communis promovendi studiosissimum et ordinis sui zelo plane exaestuentem.”\n\nBackmund, I, 62-63. Gallia Christiana, V (1731), 1109f.

In 1478 he is inscribed in the Acta bonon. as doctor of arts and doctor of both laws, but we have been unable to discover at what university he won these degrees. He is mentioned in Pardi, Titoli, as a witness for others receiving doctorates at Ferrara in 1481 and 1482. He became canon (later scholasticus) at the Bamberg cathedral in 1484. From references to him in Schott’s letters we know that he was in Rome during the years 1485-1486. His name appears in the lists of visitors at the “Anima” for 1485 (?). In 1492 he went to Bologna and spent several years there.\n\nAmrhein mentions another Leonard Egloffstein, canon at the cathedral in Würzburg, who was a cousin or nephew of our Egloffstein and who died in 1514.

He is mentioned as a delegate to various conferences, as a leader of Strassburg troops against Charles the Bold and as an emissary to Emperor Friedrich III in 1473 and to King Louis XI of France in 1475. In 1473 he was appointed one of the secular protectors (tutores) of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, a position open only to the nobility of Strassburg. He was an “Auss-Bürger” in 1484, i.e., he maintained his citizenship of Strassburg although living outside the city limits.\n\nDacheux, “Miünsterchronik,” 16. Grandidier, Chevaliers, 66.

He was a fellow student and close friend of Thomas Wolf, Jr., who dedicated his first three dialogues to him. He died at the age of thirty-one of dropsy.

Schott could have met him or even have taken courses from him at Ferrara.\n\nThe less likely candidate – because he may no longer have been teaching at Bologna during Schott’s time there – is the professor of “Latinitá” in Corradi’s lists for 1452-54 and 1458-59, “Bartolomeo da Faenza.”\n\nCorradi, 416, 417.

XXX; #142, p. 157\n\nAccording to Ritter’s recent history of Alsatian printing, Martin Flach, Sr., was born at Kuttolsheim near Strassburg and became a citizen of Strassburg in 1472 by marriage to Catherine Dammerer; like all printers, he became a member of the Strassburg goldsmith’s guild. He may have been apprenticed to Mentelin and to Rusch, but he did not occupy Mentelin’s press at the death of Rusch in 1489, because by that time he had had his own press for two years. He was active as a printer 1487-1500. His widow married Johann Knoblouch who carried on the Flach press for some months until the son Martin Flach, Jr. (active 1501-1539) took over. Martin Flach, Sr., is not to be confused with the printer Martin Flach of Basel who was a native of that city and began printing in 1477; ADB (VII, 87) has erred in identifying the one with the other.\n\nADB, VII, 87.

He spent his early years in the country, then became a townsman and did military service. At the age of 50 he left his wife and children to become a hermit in Obwalden, near his birthplace. The community built him a cell and chapel. He lived a very strict life, made monthly confessions, went on annual pilgrimages to Einsiedeln and Engelberg and himself received pilgrims. Geiler visited him often (the years 1473-1475 and 1486 appear in records), and Schott with his father visited him in 1482. According to tradition, he is supposed to have lived for 20 years without human food or drink, and Trithemius writes that the personal physician of Archduke Sigismund of Austria – Dr. Burkard von Hornack – examined him and said there was no trace of food in him. His greatest service to Switzerland was his causing the Swiss cantons which had quarreled among themselves for four years to make peace in 1481; so great was the people’s rejoicing that the bells pealed everywhere. At the request of the Basel Dominicans, he tried to intercede (16 January 1482) with Archduke Sigismund so that reform might be brought to the Clingenthal convent, but his efforts were vain. He is the national saint of the Swiss and was beatified in 1947.\n\nADB, VII, 135-139. NDB, V, 260. Baring-Gould, III, 421-434. Barth, “Pilger,” 183. Bernoulli, VI, 305. Cambridge Med.

Royal authority was divided among his paternal uncles until he should come of age, and it was this arrangement along with the feeble mindedness of Charles which led to the struggle for the control of France between the dukes of Orléans and Burgundy.\n\n2.

When he died in 1483, France was united and strong, with all fear of dismemberment a thing of the past. In addition to building France into a leading power, Louis supported the bourgeoisie (hence his appellation “the bourgeois king”) and out of genuine religiosity lavished money upon the Church.\n\nDANIEL FRIESENHEIMER, O.S.A. #208-#209, pp. 216-218\n\nThe Augustinian Daniel Friesenheimer studied in Bologna 1438. He was prior of the Strassburg Augustinians 1468, 1481, 1483, and in 1488 he was principal teacher and director of the monastery school.

Ulrich, Sr., (1425-1501), father of our Ulrich, a councillor of Archduke Sigismund of Austria, came to Swabia in 1467/68 and bought the town of Mingelheim (Mindelheim); in 1488 he became the leader of the Danube circle of the “Foedus Clypei S. Georgij,” an organization of knights working against evildoers. Georg (1473-1528), brother of our Ulrich, was a famous military man under Charles V. Ulrich studied at Bologna, where he is listed in 1468, and at Ferrara, where he is named as a witness for a doctorand in 1481 and where he met Schott, Hassenstein and the Adelmann brothers. He held canonicates at Brixen, Freising and Augsburg. He was called to preach at Trent – according to Khamm in 1473, an obvious misprint, because he would not have been finished with his education at that time. In 1485 he is documented as visiting the “Anima” in Rome. In 1486 he was one of the two Augsburg canons sent from Augsburg to obtain from Innocent VIII confirmation of Friedrich von Zollern’s election as bishop of Augsburg. In the same year he was elected bishop of Trent, but did not take immediate possession of his episcopate, as Friedrich III had selected another candidate for the post and the ensuing strife was not settled until 1488 when Innocent VIII confirmed Ulrich’s election (although Ulrich seems to have carried on the administration of the diocese from 1487). Hassenstein wrote Ulrich a letter of congratulation on his election, and Ulrich in 1490 strongly supported Hassenstein as candidate for the bishop’s seat of Olmütz. Ulrich made a competent bishop: he enriched the episcopal library, had a stone bridge built across the Avisio, revised old city statutes and issued new ones, and rebuilt the episcopal palace.\n\nNDB, V, 670.

From about 1480 to 1500 he was a much sought after procurator at the Curia in Rome; he is listed in the membership of Santa Maria de Anima as “procurator causorum famosus.” In 1500 he obtained the fat benefice of dean at Neumünster in Würzburg and seems to have spent the remainder of his life in that city, active as poet, epigrammatist, editor and member of a literary society. He was a close friend of Trithemius. Well-educated and a student of Greek, he helped to spread Italian humanism. He was also critical of conditions at the Curia.\n\nNDB, V, 732. Bauch, 52, 84-86.

He studied at Basel, where he served as prefect of the “Nova Bursa,” and then went to Heidelberg in 1476. Here he was befriended by the procurator of the Franciscans and studied under Agricola. He received his baccalaureate and licentiate in theology and served often as rector of the university to 1493. Years later he obtained his doctor of arts degree. At Heidelberg he taught philosophy and logic and is said to have given more speeches in Latin than anyone else. He was friendly with the circle around Johann Dalberg and Pleningen. He became curate at Steinach and councilllor to Pfalzgraf Philipp II and acted as mediator for the bishop of Spires in 1511. Succeeding Wimpheling, he was appointed canon and preacher of the cathedral at Spires. He published a great deal in favour of church reform and attacked the faults of his age. One of his Scherzreden (edited by Wimpheling and published 1487/1488), “Monopolium et societas vulgo des liechtschiffs” may have given Brant the first idea for his Narrenschiff. Gallus was the uncle of Conrad Pelican.\n\nADB, VIII, 348; IX, 826. NDB, VI, 55. Eysengrein, 187. Freundgen, 110. GGr2, 435. Grandidier, Nouv. oeuvr., II, 188ff. Knepper, Schulwesen, 78, 324.

Special Index and General Index.\n\nThe Geilers are documented from about 1400 as citizens of the small Alsatian town of Kaysersberg, nestled in the foothills of the Vosges. Johann Geiler, father of our Geiler, moved with his bride Anna Zuber to Schaffhausen to take a post in the town clerk’s office. In Schaffhausen were born a daughter and a son. Shortly after the latter’s birth, Johann Geiler, Sr., accepted the position of notary in Ammersweiler (Ammerschwier), a town in the valley below Kaysersberg, and the young family returned “home.” In the winter of 1448 Johann, Sr., – on a hunt with the men of Ammersweiler for a bear which was devastating the vineyards – was attacked by the cornered beast and so badly lacerated that he died several days later. The widow with her two children then went to live in the home of her father-in-law Burchard (?) Geiler at Kaysersberg, and here the young Geiler spent his childhood, hence his appellation “von Kaysersberg.”\n\nIn June 1460 Geiler enrolled as one of the first students in the arts faculty of the new university of Freiburg which had opened its doors on 27 April of that year. In 1462 he became bachelor of arts, in 1463 licentiate and in 1464 master of arts. He taught in the faculty of arts and 1469-1470 served as its dean. In 1471 he went to the university of Basel to study theology; here he lectured in arts and in 1474 served as dean of the arts faculty. On receiving his doctorate in theology in 1475, he was made professor of theology. In 1476 he was called to his first alma mater, the university of Freiburg, as professor of theology and during the winter semester of 1476/77 served as rector of the university. In the same winter he was offered the chair of cathedral preacher at Würzburg.\n\nAccording to Rathgeber (Gottesmänner, 9), the Würzburg offer came about thus: Geiler’s health falled in 1476 and he went – presumably during the summer months – to the baths at Baden-Baden to recuperate. While there he preached to the crowds frequenting the fashionable spa and was heard by influential Würzburgers who were greatly impressed by him and had him called to Würzburg. Geiler went to Würzburg to preach a trial sermon which Falk (91) claims was such a success that he was then and there offered the post permanently.\n\nOn the way from Würzburg to Freiburg to resign his professorship and to Basel to collect his books, Geiler stopped in Strassburg, where Schott, Sr., a director of the cathedral fabrica, persuaded him to decline the Würzburg chair and to inaugurate the newly conceived cathedral chair at Strassburg (N. 955).\n\nDespite Rathgeber’s claim (loc. cit.) that Geiler stopped in Strassburg to tell his “good friend Schott” of the Würzburg offer, and Wuttke’s claim (NDB, VI, 150f.) that in coming to Strassburg Geiler yielded to the persuasion of “his pupil Peter Schott” to accept a new chair financed by Schott, there is no evidence whatsoever of any personal ties between the Schotts and Geiler before Geiler came to Strassburg. Furthermore neither Schott, Sr., nor Schott, Jr., could have studied under Geiler, the elder Schott being about 18 years Geiler’s senior and the younger Schott not having attended either university where Geiler taught; in fact, at the time Geiler accepted the Strassburg offer, young Schott – then seventeen years old – was in Italy. To be sure, the Schotts and Geiler must have known one another by reputation, because they were all noteworthy residents of the southwestern Rhine area. If Rathgeber is correct about Geiler’s sojourn at Baden-Baden in 1476, it is very possible that Schott, Sr., and Susanna von Cöllen heard and perhaps even met Geiler there. Indeed, both Dacheux and Schmidt credit Susanna with securing Geiler for Strassburg, for it was she who urged her husband and the fabrica members to approach him.\n\nFor 33 years Geiler was cathedral preacher in Strassburg despite opposition to his moves for reform, despite tempting offers from Augsburg and Basel, despite his longing to retire into a life of study and contemplation (plans to retreat to the Black Forest with friends such as Christoph von Uttenheim, Johann Laudenburg and Wimpheling came to naught in 1497, 1498 and 1501). His powerful sermons, spiced with wit and vivid exempla, attracted people from all classes in such flocks as had never been seen at Strassburg. No one escaped his scathing satire – be he bishop, king, pope or emperor. Yet Maximilian I made him imperial chaplain in 1503.\n\nUnfortunately – according to Frenken (Die Exempla, 68) – we do not have Geiler’s sermons in the exact form in which he delivered them. We have only notes taken down by his hearers, his own Latin sketches or German translations of his sketches. The Monita written for Friedrich von Zollern (Appendix H) exemplify Geiler’s completely practical, direct, concise and lucid manner of expression. Schott’s “Imitaciunculae” also give us some idea of Geiler’s picturesque language.\n\nIn addition to the onerous duties as cathedral preacher (N. 955, par. 5), Geiler preached in Strassburg monasteries and convents. He preached weekly to the Magdalenes whom he had reformed. He also preached outside the city of Strassburg for anniversaries of church consecrations, particularly in his homeland of Upper Alsace. He led pilgrimages to holy places, as for instance when he escorted 100 pilgrims to Einsiedeln in 1484. He also wrote, published and participated in disputations. Not only did he help in acquiring materials for the cathedral library, but he also assembled an excellent library of his own which he willed to the cathedral chair with the stipulation that the books remain in the preacher’s home and be moved only if the office were discontinued. The library was used by his successors and by the first Lutheran preachers of the cathedral; then it vanished; perhaps it was sold along with the cathedral library (N. 56).\n\nDuring his holidays Geiler often travelled to Upper Alsace, to Baden and to Switzerland. He repeatedly visited the hermits Sebastian and Nicolaus von Flüe, both of whom he greatly admired. One year – possibly 1484, as Schmidt (H. L., I, 352) believes – he made an extensive tour through France to places of pilgrimage, one of these being the cave at La Sainte Baume near Marseilles, where Mary Magdalene is supposed to have done penance for 30 years. Here Geiler acquired (or himself made) a copy of Petrarch’s 36 Latin hexameters composed at Sainte Baume in 1338 to the saint (“Epistulae Seniles,” XIV, 17, in Petrarch, Opera omnia, Basel, 1581). This poem appeared in the 1506 edition of Schott’s Epithoma and is in the “Wimpheling Codex” (folio 50b f.). On the tour through France, Geiler also visited the grave of Gerson in the monastery church of the Celestines at Lyons. To this monastery and to that of the Carthusians at Avignon Gerson had willed his works. At both these monasteries Geiler had copies of Gerson’s works made for himself.\n\nWith all his zeal and application to work, Geiler was extremely human. He felt for the needy, the hungry, the leper, the poor in wretched hospitals, the stranger. He tells how he once found succor for a sick stranger whom no one in the Strassburg hospitals would help and who was finally deposited at the church door. He enjoyed a good joke and he was not above a bit of vanity. For example, at Freiburg – like many another – he refused to conform to the university rule obliging masters and students to wear ecclesiastical attire. He had enough money to permit himself little extravagances and wore chains, bracelets and ornate shoes. In punishment for his behavior, he was disciplined before his examination for the licentiate by being made to take an oath that he would not wear such attire.\n\nGeiler outlived most of those whom he held dear: Peter Schott and his parents, Friedrich von Zollern, Johann Rot, Andreas Hartmann and Johann Simmler; and during his later years Wimpheling and Christoph von Uttenheim were no longer in Strassburg. A touching anecdote is told by Beatus Rhenanus of Geiler’s last days. He received a letter from a young woman in Augsburg who had heard him preach. Having had strange dreams about him for some weeks, she believed he was soon to die; “Set your house in order” (“Bestelle dein Haus!”), she wrote, and Geiler followed her advice. He preached his final sermon on the first day of the year 1510, a Sunday. On 10 March, as he was resting after lunch, he slipped quietly away.\n\nHe was buried at the foot of the lovely Gothic chancel which Schott, Sr., had put into the cathedral for him; later his body was transferred to the chapel of St. Catherine. Shortly after his death, the Knights of St. John in Strassburg had the first four lines of the 24 line epitaph composed by Brant for Geiler incised on the first pillar of the choir (opposite the great clock) in the cathedral. In their own church the knights placed a second epitaph which was moved in 1633 to the cathedral and put on the same pillar with the first; there both may still be seen today.\n\nMany honors have been paid Geiler through the centuries. One such honor belongs to the early years of our own century when Ammersweiler named a street for Geiler and dedicated a plaque in his memory. On the plaque are quoted Schiller’s words:\n\nWer den besten seiner Zeit genug getan,\n\nDer hat gelebt für alle Zeiten.\n\nADB, VIII, 509-518. NDB, VI, 150f. Adam Theolog., 6-11. Athen. Raur., 3.

He may be identical with the Dominican Georgius von Ungarn, whose manuscript book De ritibus Turcarum in “St. Maria super Minerva” at Rome is mentioned by Jöcher, and just possibly with the Georgius of an undated entry (before 1450?) in the “Anima” register: “Georgius Ungeren. canon Tarbatensis.”\n\nActa bonon., 224, 227, 228.

At age 14 he entered the college le Navarre at Paris and by 1394 was doctor of theology. He became chancellor of Notre Dame and of the university of Paris in 1395. Other posts he acquired were: 1397-1401 dean of St. Donatien at Bruges, 1403 curé of St. Jean-en-Grève at Paris. Sent to the council of Constance in 1414, he became one its leading spirits. After the council, he did not return to his post in Paris because of his opposition to Duke John the Fearless of Burgundy; instead he went to Melk and Vienna. Even when John was assassinated in 1419, Gerson did not go back to Paris, but retired to the monastery of the Celestines in Lyons, where his brother was prior, to spend the remainder of his life in writing and teaching.\n\nTwo contrafaçons of Gerson’s works printed in 1489 (N. 136, par. 7) have the following quatrain to Gerson:\n\nAuct., III, 452, 454, 501, 515, 582, 595, 616, 625; IV, passim.

Minderau (now listed as Weissenau SS Peter and Paul), founded as a priory in 1141, became an abbey in 1257. This same Gesler may very well be the Johann Gosseler, “Pfarrherr und doctor zu sant Jost zu Raffenspurg,” who wrote a poem on St. Ursula’s ship, which was printed with music by Bartolomeus Kistler at Strassburg 1497.\n\nA Johann Gessler from Ulm was matriculated at Erfurt in 1482, and a Johann Gessler was active as a lawyer in Strassburg during the latter part of the fifteenth century; he published precedents and rhetorical writings in German.\n\nBackmund, I, 88f.

St. Peter, because he had learned from Geiler that Goetz was interested in coming to Strassburg, is listed in Heidelberg matriculation records for 12 July 1488: “Johannes Goczs ex Augusta (bacc. in art. Libicensis).” Ca. 1501 he wrote a letter to Johann Amerbach, in which he identifies himself as “Johann Goetzonis Augustensis, plebanus Argentinensis.” According to Schmidt, he was a priest at the cathedral in Augsburg before becoming a priest in Strassburg, a friend of Brant and a member of the Strassburg humanistic society.\n\nHartmann identifies this Johann Goetz with the Goetz who had studied at Ingolstadt and Paris before matriculating at Leipzig in 1482, received a licentiate in the “via moderna” in 1489, matriculated at Basel 1494/95 as “Joh. Goetzonis arcium mag. ex Augusta, pedagogus Melchioris baronis Limperg,” and may have been teaching as “lector biblicus” at Basel in 1497.\n\nHartmann, I, 132. Schmidt, H. L., 197.

He also served his city of Augsburg in various capacities and was mayor in 1458. In 1461 he gave his possessions to his sons and retired to the monastery of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem at Strassburg. In 1468 he bought Strassburg citizenship. A staunch supporter of Piccolomini and the new learning, he reveals his interest in humanism in the letters he wrote to his Viennese professor Konrad Säldner with whom he carried on a long literary debate. In Strassburg he collected a considerable library and was friendly with Johann Rot, Geiler, Dringenberg, Schott, Bohuslaus von Hassenstein, Hartmann Schedel, et al. He encouraged the Benedictine monk Sigismund Meisterlin to write the Augsburg Chronik and was himself urged by Meisterlin to write one of his earliest works, Chronographia Augustana, which has been called “the first humanistic historical work in Germany” (ADB). From Schott’s comment about the cross fashioned for the Schotts, it is apparent that Gossenbrot was a skilled craftsman in wood or metal. Two sons he sent to study at Ferrara; one of these became a priest (†1465), the other (†1502) was an official of Archduke Sigismund of Austria and later in the service of Maximilian I. The third son, Sigismund the Younger, miles auratus, was in the government of Augsburg and served as mayor every even numbered year from 1484 to the year of his death, 1500.\n\nADB, XLIX, 475-477.

He was canon of New St. Peter by 1459 and was involved in the quarrel between the churches and the bishop who claimed that the churches were receiving money rightly belonging to the cathedral. The pope, to whom the churches appealed, referred the matter to Dr. Rudolph von Rudesheim, dean in Worms. From Rudesheim, Hagen obtained permission for a new screen in New St. Peter; whereupon the bishop sought to excommunicate all canons, but was prevented from doing so when the churches again appealed to the pope. Having served as cantor and scholasticus, Hagen became also dean of New St. Peter in 1482 and took possession of the office on 3 November (#38). In that year he resigned, in favor of Thomas Wolf, Jr., the canonicate he had acquired at St. Thomas on the death of Johann Hell, dean of St. Thomas, in 1481.\n\nHorning, Jung-St.-Peter, 51-52.

During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the family supplied many bailiffs and other officials to the service of the counts of Flanders. From Schott’s letters we know that Walter Halewin studied at Bologna, possibly also at Ferrara, and received a doctorate of law. Since he is not listed by Pardi among those obtaining doctorates from Ferrara, he probably took his doctorate at Bologna; his name does not appear in the Acta bonon., because Flemish students were ejected from the German nation at Bologna in 1475 and were not reinstated until 1543 (Acta bonon., xxx). From Schott we also know that Halewin was an eques auratus and that sometime before October 1486 he was married and appointed to the bailiff’s office in Bruges.\n\nMatriculation records of Louvain list a “Walterus Haelwiin, Tornacensis” 18 November 1471 who may be identical with our Halewin; and Gaillard has information about a “Gauthier van Halewyn, pensionnaire du Franc en 1484”, son of Jean van Halewyn, “chevalier, président de la Hollande, de la Zélande,” etc. († 1478) and of Béatrice van den Ryne, “dame de Swevezeele” († 1507). This Gauthier, who could be our Walter, died 31 October 1487. Bruges archives, sparse for the period, do not mention Walter but note that on 11 December 1487 “Charles van Halewyn, chevalier, bailli de Bruges, est nommé hoofman de la gilde de vieux serment;… et Corneille van Halewyn est nommé lieutenant bailli.” Might one of these two have succeeded Walter in office?\n\nBiographie nationale… de Belgique, VIII (1884), 727.

FRIEDRICH III (1415-1493) Roman Emperor 1452-1493 #5, p. 11; #73, pp. 79f.; #80, p. 87; #83, p. 90; #118, p. 138; #121, pp. 139f.; #170, pp. 189f.; #263, p. 295; #264, pp. 296f.; #267, p. 299. Friedrich III was born at Innsbruck, the son of Ernst von Hapsburg, duke of Styria and Carinthia. In 1440 he was chosen King of the Germans and crowned 1442. Under the influence of Aeneas Silvio Piccolomini (later Pope Pius II), Friedrich negotiated the Concordat of Vienna in 1448 with Pope Nicholas V, in which he pledged the allegiance of the German people to Rome in return for the promise of the imperial crown. His marriage to Leonora, daughter of Edward King of Portugal, took place in Rome, as did his coronation as emperor in 1452. On the death of his brother Albrecht in 1463, Friedrich united the Hapsburg dominions of upper and lower Austria, but his claim to those territories was disputed by Matthias Hunyadi of Hungary who drove Friedrich from Vienna. After the election of his son Maximilian as King of the Romans in 1486, Friedrich spent much of his time in retirement at Linz.\n\nADB, VII, 448-452. NDB, V, 484-487. EB, XI, 49f.\n\n2. MAXIMILIAN I (1459-1519) Roman Emperor (1493-1519) p. xxiv; #83, p. 90; #118, pp. 137ff.; #121, pp. 139f.; #128, p. 148; #153, pp. 167f.; #155, pp. 169f.; #263, pp. 295ff; #264, pp. 296f.\n\nBorn in Wiener Neustadt, son of Emperor Friedrich III, Maximilian – through his marriage with Mary of Burgundy in 1477 – brought the Lowlands under Hapsburg dominion. In 1486 he was elected King of the Romans at the diet in Frankfurt and crowned at Aachen a few weeks later. From this time on he virtually led the empire. Captured at Bruges in 1488 by the Flemish who resented his being regent for his young son Philipp the Fair, he was freed by an imperial army under Friedrich III. He became emperor in 1493 but was not crowned until 1508 at Trent. Maximilian was a good ruler and established the supremacy of Roman law throughout the empire. Well-educated and himself a writer of romances, he fostered education and the arts, and is often termed “the last knight.”\n\nEB, XVII, 922f.\n\n3. SIGISMUND, ARCHDUKE OF AUSTRIA (†1496) #76, p. 83; #101, p. 112; #170, p. 190.\n\nSon of Friedrich of Hapsburg and Anna of Brunswick, Sigismund ruled as count – later as duke – of Tyrol from 1440 to 1490. He was also landgrave of Alsace. Until 1474 he was often at war with the Swiss and at one time allied himself with Charles the Bold to get money for campaigning against them. He was apparently originator of the plan that Maximilian should marry Mary of Burgundy. In 1490 he adopted Maximilian as his heir and retired from public life.\n\nBernoulli, VI, 301.

He held the posts of canon at New Saint Peter, of almoner and of vicar at the Strassburg cathedral and became vicar general of Bishop Albrecht by 1479; in that capacity he represented the bishop on a commission to settle the law suit between Nicolaus Jörger and Hans von Sickingen in 1491; in 1491 he was one of the spokesmen for the lay clerics versus the mendicants. He corrected the Apparatus of Innocent IV on the Decretals which was published by Heinrich Eggestan on the press in the monastery of the Strassburg Carthusians in the year 1478. Hartmann belonged to the Hermits of St. William. His seal (of 19 March 1493) is in the archives of the chapter at St. Thomas. A relief of him showing him in a doctor’s robe and holding a book in his hand is in the Zorn chapel at New St. Peter. Straub calls him “vir mirae gravitatis, justitiae, simul et miseri cordiae cultoris.”\n\nBarth, “Florentius,” 121. Dacheux, Réf., 176f. Glöckler, I, 340. Horning, Festschrift, 52f.
