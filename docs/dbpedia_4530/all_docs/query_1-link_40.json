        "text": "The Upper Darby High School's mission is to empower all learners to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve their full potential. The Upper Darby faculty, administrators, and staff are committed to providing an environment that fosters a respectful community of learners and supports our comprehensive and challenging educational program.\n\nUpper Darby High School is the oldest high school in Delaware County and one rich in tradition and history. This year, UDHS celebrates 115 years of educating the youth of Upper Darby, Drexel Hill, Clifton Heights, Millbourne, and East Lansdowne. Upper Darby High School first opened its doors in 1895, and graduated five students under the leadership of the school's lone faculty member, Miss Elisabeth D. Turner, in 1896. In stark contrast, the Class of 2010 graduated over 800 students with the help of nearly 270 faculty members.\n\nThere is a program for every student at UDHS, the largest high school in the county and one of the largest in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Upper Darby High School demonstrates commitment to academic excellence and dedication to improving student achievement.\n\nOur rigorous and rich curriculum features traditional academic courses and the widest variety of elective offerings found in the county. These offerings include courses of study in English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Health and Physical Education, Technology Education, Art, Music, Business Education, Family and Consumer Sciences, Foreign Language, and Vocational and Technical Education.\n\nOur comprehensive program has proven effective in preparation for college, for trade or vocational schools, for the military, and for those going directly into the work force. We pride ourselves in providing a variety of educational experiences to meet the needs of a diverse student population.\n\nA wide variety of extra-curricular offerings enrich the students' experiences. Upper Darby High School takes pride in our athletic excellence while setting the standards of sportsmanship and fair play by sponsoring 25 athletic teams on the freshman, junior varsity, and varsity levels. In 2009, we won the Central League and District One Sportsmanship Awards.\n\nOur music program offers a host of opportunities for both vocal and instrumental performers. Both programs set the standard for excellence as we routinely win local, state, and national competitions. Additionally, we offer over 30 student-run clubs and activities serving all the diverse needs and desires of our student population."
