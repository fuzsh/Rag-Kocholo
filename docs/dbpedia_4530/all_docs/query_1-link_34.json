        "text": "On 3 March 2014, an entirely new Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) came into effect in Hong Kong. The new Companies Ordinance (new CO) is a comprehensive rewrite of the predecessor Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32) aimed at modernising Hong Kongâs company law and further enhancing Hong Kongâs status as a major international business and financial centre. This means that while in some areas the new CO carries forward the requirements of the predecessor CO (Cap. 32), it also introduces important differences to watch out for.\n\nTo assist with understanding the key areas of changes, KPMG has developed a series of briefing notes, each one focusing on a particular topic relevant to financial reporting, and a practical guide designed to assist you in the preparation of a business review that complies with the new Schedule 5 requirements. This topic page provides you with direct access to these materials.\n\nThis practical guide is intended for companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and any other companies who are interested in using this opportunity to improve the way they communicate with stakeholders about their operations. The guide introduces the new requirements in the law and includes tips and examples for each of the topics required to be covered by Schedule 5. It also discusses how a business review can both embrace the HKICPAâs âAccounting Bulletin 5â guidance and meet the Listing Rule requirements and recommendations relating to the management discussion and analysis (MD&A)."
