        "text": "Plan your own family adventure!\n\nACS Family Adventure Guide\n\nACS Brochure\n\nFMWR Rental Facilities\n\nThe mission of ACS is to facilitate the commander's ability to provide comprehensive, standardized, coordinated and responsive services that support Soldiers, Department of the Army civilians, and Families regardless of geographical location and to maximize technology and resources, eliminate duplication in service delivery and measure service effectiveness.\n\nArmy Emergency Relief (AER)\n\nArmy Emergency Relief Overview\n\nArmy Emergency Relief (AER) is a private non-profit organization established to assist Soldiers and their Family members in emergency financial situations due to no fault of their own. Financial assistance is given in the form of an interest-free loan, grant, or combination of the two. Loans are repaid by an allotment.\n\nTo apply for AER assistance, the Soldier should visit the AER Officer at Army Community Service (Bldg. 622) for a consultation. After determining that the Soldier has a valid emergency, then we can proceed with authorized AER assistance.\n\nIf the need for emergency financial assistance arises outside these operating hours, the American Red Cross Armed Forces Emergency Service Center can be contacted toll free at (877) 272-7337. This Center is operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nEducation Programs\n\nAER’s Education Program is a secondary mission to help Army Families with the costs of education. The three separate scholarship programs are:\n\nStateside Spouse Education Assistance Program\n\nApplicant must be the Spouse or widow(er) of an active duty or retired Soldier and reside in the United States.\n\nStateside applicants must be full time students.\n\nFirst undergraduate degrees only.\n\nActive duty military personnel are not eligible.\n\nOverseas Spouse Education Assistance Program\n\nApplicants must be a Spouse of an active duty Soldier assigned in Europe, Korea, Japan, or Okinawa.\n\nApplicants must physically reside with the Soldier at the assigned location.\n\nFirst undergraduate degrees only.\n\nOff post students are not eligible.\n\nSpouses may be part time or full time students.\n\nMajor General James Ursano Scholarship Fund for Dependant Children\n\nDependent children, stepchildren, or legally adopted children of Army Soldiers on active duty, retired or deceased while in active duty or retired status. The children of Grey Area Reservists/National Guard are eligible as well.\n\nScholarship awards will be awarded up to half the cost of tuition. Scholarship awards are based on financial need, as evidenced by income, assets, Family size, and special circumstances.\n\nApplications and instructions are available for all the scholarships on the AER website at www.aerhq.org\n\nAER Resources and Forms\n\nView all forms.\n\nEmployment Readiness Program (ERP)\n\nOperated through Army Community Service (ACS) centers, helps Soldiers, Spouses, surviving Spouses, DoD Civilians, and Family members gain the competitive edge needed for employment by providing employment information in the areas of job search skills, education, training, transition, and volunteer opportunities.\n\nEmployment Readiness Program Brochure PDF\n\nExceptional Family Member Program (EFMP)\n\nThe Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) provides comprehensive support to Family members with special needs. EFMP takes an all-inclusive approach to coordinate military and civilian community, educational, medical, housing, and personnel services to help Soldiers and their Families with special needs.\n\nAn Exceptional Family Member is Family member with any physical, emotional, developmental, or intellectual disorder that requires special treatment, therapy, education, training, or counseling, and meets the eligibility criteria.\n\nIf you’re eligible for EFMP services, Family members must be screened and enrolled when they accompany authorized Soldiers on OCONUS assignments. Screenings include medical records review for all Family members and developmental screening for all children aged 72 months and younger.\n\nEFMP Family Needs Assessment Information Flyer\n\nWhat is the Exceptional Family Member Program?\n\nThe EFMP is a mandatory enrollment program that works with other military and civilian agencies to provide comprehensive and coordinated medical, educational, housing, community support and personnel services to Families with special needs.\n\nWho must enroll in the program?\n\nThe following Soldiers with Exceptional Family Members must enroll in the program:\n\nActive Duty Army\n\nU.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Soldiers in the USAR-Active Guard Reserve (AGR) program and other USAR Soldiers on active duty exceeding 30 days.\n\nArmy National Guard personnel serving under authority of Title 10, United States Code and Title 32, United States Code. Department of the Army civilian employees do not enroll in the program. However, they must identify Family members with special education and medically related service needs each time they process for an assignment to a location outside of the United States where Family member travel is authorized at Government expense.\n\nHow does a soldier enroll in the program?\n\nThe Soldier contacts the nearest medical treatment facility EFMP point of contact to begin the assessment process and to obtain the enrollment forms: DD Form 2792 (Medical),\n\nDD Form 2792-1 (Special Education). Once the forms are completed, they are forwarded to the appropriate regional medical center for coding and on to Army personnel agencies who enroll the Soldier into the program. At West Point, once the EFMP enrollment forms are completed, the Family can call the Keller Army Community Hospital EFMP Coordinator at +1 (845)938-6881 to schedule an appointment for initial enrollment review or for an update review. After the review is complete, the paperwork is forwarded to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for coding and processing.\n\nIf accessing PDF from government computer, \"right click, save as\")\n\nDoes enrollment have any impact on the soldiers career?\n\nEnrollment in EFMP does not adversely affect selection for promotion, schools, or assignment. Information concerning enrollment in EFMP or any of the data used in the program is not made available to selection boards.\n\nWhat are the benefits of enrollment in the program?\n\nEnrollment allows assignment managers at Army personnel agencies to consider the documented medical and special education needs of Exceptional Family Members in the assignment process. When possible, Soldiers are assigned to an area where the medical and special education needs of the Exceptional Family Member can be met. This will depend on the valid personnel requirement for the Soldier’s grade, specialty and eligibility for the tour. All Soldiers are still eligible for worldwide assignments.\n\nAre special education needs considered in military personnel assignments?\n\nSpecial education needs are only considered in assignments outside the United States. Assignments within the United States are not based on the educational needs of children. Every local school system must obey public laws regarding the provision of special education.\n\nRights and Responsibilities\n\nKNOW YOUR RIGHTS!\n\nPublic Law 90-480, Architectural Barriers Acts of 1968\n\nRequires that certain Federally owned, leased or funded buildings and facilities be accessible to individuals with physical disabilities.\n\nPublic Law 93-112, The Rehabilitation Act of 1973\n\nAddresses discrimination against individuals with disabilities\n\nSection 501: Employment of Handicapped\n\nSection 502: Architectural and Transportation Compliance\n\nSection 503: Employment Under Federal contracts\n\nSection 504: Non-Discrimination Under Federal Grants\n\n“No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by any reason of his (or her) handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance”\n\nPublic Law 94-142, The Education for all Handicapped Children Act\n\nMade it possible for states and localities to receive Federal funds to assist in the education of children with disabilities.

Our services are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nOur trained professionals are here for crisis response, information on reporting options, medical treatment options, law enforcement’s response, emergency services, safety planning, obtaining military and civilian protective orders, and accompaniment to medical forensic exams and medical appointments, as well as accompaniment to court for orders of protection hearings and trials. Advocates work closely with their civilian counterparts and ensure a personal and smooth transition for victims who do not qualify for ongoing advocacy services within the military community.\n\nIf you need help or want more information, contact the Victim Advocacy Program Manager at your local Army Community Service Center at +1 (845)938-5658.\n\nReporting Options\n\nThe Army is fully committed to ensuring victims of domestic abuse are protected; treated with dignity and respect; and provided support, advocacy and care. The Army strongly supports effective command awareness and prevention programs, and holding offenders accountable.\n\nThere are two types of reporting options: Restricted Reporting and Unrestricted Reporting. Personnel should report all suspected cases of domestic abuse promptly, which quickly activates victim services and accountability actions. However, we understand things might not always work that way. Victims might need medical attention or victim services without command or a law enforcement response. Therefore, the Army has implemented a Restricted Reporting Option for victims to confidentially disclose allegations of abuse and receive needed medical treatment and services.\n\nRestricted Reporting\n\nAllows someone who meets VAP criteria and who is experiencing violence in his/her relationship to confidentially disclose the abuse to a Victim Advocate, a Victim Advocate Supervisor, or a Healthcare Provider. When an individual chooses a restricted report, law enforcement is not involved and there is no investigation of the abuse. In addition, the Soldier’s Command is not notified of the abuse and is unable to offer assistance and protection.\n\nThe restricted reporting option allows an individual to receive medical treatment, advocacy services and clinical and pastoral counseling. This option allows one to receive needed services, control the release of his/her personal information, and time to consider his/her options.\n\nUnder this reporting option, the offender is not held accountable and the abuse may continue. If an assessment reveals a high risk for future injury, a restricted report may not be granted.\n\nUnrestricted Reporting\n\nVictims of domestic abuse who want to pursue an official investigation of an incident should report the abuse to law enforcement, or the alleged offender’s Commander. The unrestricted reporting option provides a victim with the widest array of services available including but not limited to command involvement, law enforcement involvement, medical treatment, advocacy services, and counseling services.\n\nNot all incidents of domestic abuse are the same, and each person who experiences domestic abuse handles the situation differently.\n\nCommand Response\n\nCommanders play an integral part in ensuring the safety, health, and well being of our Army Families. Commanders who learn of an incident of domestic abuse are required to notify law enforcement.\n\nVictim’s Rights\n\nThe right to be treated with fairness and with respect for your dignity and privacy.\n\nThe right to be reasonably protected from the accused offender.\n\nThe right to be notified of court proceedings.\n\nThe right to be present at all public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that your testimony would be materially affected if you, as the victim, heard other testimony at trial.\n\nThe right to confer with the attorney for the government in the case; the right to available restitution; the right to information about the conviction, sentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender.\n\nSafety Planning\n\nA violent relationship puts you and your children at risk for injury and even death. Developing a safety plan tailored to meet the needs of your family will enable you get out of a potentially dangerous situation. If your children are old enough, mature enough, or even responsible enough to assist you during a violent or potentially violent episode of domestic abuse, you may consider including them in your plan to keep everyone safe. A good safety plan considers which steps to take if you choose to stay in the relationship or if you choose to leave.\n\nHere are some tips during the explosive phase of domestic abuse:\n\nMove to a room with easy access to an exit. Don't go to the kitchen, bathroom or near possible weapons.\n\nKnow the quickest route out of your home. Practice escaping that way.\n\nKnow the quickest route out of your workplace.

They will know to call the police and get you help.\n\nKnow where you are going to go, if you ever have to leave.\n\nUse your instincts.\n\nYou have the right to protect yourself and your children.\n\nDevelop a Safety Plan\n\nSafety Plan (English)\n\nSafety Plan (Spanish)- Plan de seguridad (español)\n\nProtection Orders\n\nMilitary Protection Orders (MPO)\n\nUnit Commanders may issue a Military Protective Order (MPO) to ensure the safety of service members, family members, and other individuals from the threat of domestic violence. An MPO is a written lawful order issued by a commander that orders a Soldier to avoid contact with his or her spouse or children. The commander should provide a written copy of the order within 24 hours of its issuance to the protected person, the Military Police and civilian law enforcement. An individual should report violations of the MPO to law enforcement.\n\nCivilian Protection Orders (CPO)\n\nA Civilian Order of Protection is an order signed by a Judge that directs an individual to stop abusing, stalking, harassing and/or committing acts of sexual violence against an individual. An individual may file a CPO against current or former spouse, someone that an individual shares a child in common, an individual with whom you have shared a residence with, someone related to you by blood or marriage or someone with whom you have dated or had intimate relations.\n\nNational Resources\n\nUnited States Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women\n\nNational Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence\n\nStalking Resource Center\n\nStatewide directory for laws, courts, emergency shelters, orders of protection\n\nBattered Women's Justice Project\n\nThe Family Violence Prevention Fund\n\nWomen's Justice Center– Also is Spanish\n\nMind, Body, Spirit Empowered - Materials translated into many languages\n\nMarriage and Equality – Materials translated into many languages"
