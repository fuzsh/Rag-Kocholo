        "text": "With about one billion members, the Catholic Church is one of the world’s largest religious bodies, and its history is crucially linked to global events. In the Historical Dictionary of Catholicism, author William J. Collinge provides the reader with a comprehensive introduction to the theology, doctrines, and worship of the religion. He covers the entire Catholic tradition from the time of Jesus to the present, including the periods before the present division of Christianity into Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant. Collinge has also included entries on heretical, schismatic, and dissident movements within Catholicism, and he covers the relation of Catholicism to other Christian traditions, to the major non-Christian religions, and to Western cultural and philosophical traditions.\n\nThe second edition of the Historical Dictionary of Catholicism has been updated to reflect recent developments in the Catholic Church, most notably the death of Pope John Paul II and his succession by Pope Benedict XVI. An updated introduction precedes the main body of the dictionary, which contains more than 500 alphabetical, cross-referenced entries covering persons, organizations, places, events, titles, and concepts. The entries are followed by several appendixes on popes, ecumenical councils, the documents of Vatican Council II, major papal encyclicals, and Catholic prayers, and a comprehensive bibliography provides the researcher with further readings. The second edition of the Historical Dictionary of Catholicism is an ideal access point for students, researchers, or anyone interested in the history of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Catholic Church is the only 'the Church'\"--so said comedian Lenny Bruce. The joke, of course, was a reference to the power and influence of Catholicism in the US and around the world. Although the second edition of this dictionary (1st ed., CH, Jul'97, 34-6012) does not include any jokes, interested researchers will find over 500 useful entries on a wide range of topics. Collinge (Mount Saint Mary's Univ.) includes new and revised entries on people, places, concepts, and changes in the church, but some earlier entries were cut from the new edition. The volume continues to include more than 100 pages of appendixes that provide easy access to information on the popes, the ecumenical councils, the documents of the Second Vatican Council, and selected papal encyclicals. Of particular value is an 80-page bibliography that provides an excellent overview of recent research on the major themes covered in the entries. Unquestionably, this volume succeeds all previous historical dictionaries on this topic. Summing Up: Highly recommended.\n\n— Choice Reviews\n\nAny attempt to edit a one-volume reference source on Catholicism is an enormous assignment, and Collinge (theology & philosophy, St. Mary’s Coll.) has succeeded admirably. More than 500 entries cover a broad range of topics: historical (councils, schism, the Renaissance); doctrinal (incarnation, resurrection, trinity); liturgical (lectionary, transubstantiation, the Eucharist); institutional (curia, Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith); and spiritual (religious orders, St. Ignatius Loyola, St. Teresa of Avila). Ample attention is given to specific figures including God, Juliana of Norwich, G.K. Chesterton, Flannery O’Connor, and Karl Rahner. Concise, well-written entries, averaging a page or more, provide even treatments. Collinge’s range of reference begins from the time of Jesus and extends through the various councils, schisms, reformation, and Vatican II before ending with modern-day concerns of the church (the sexual abuse crisis, women’s ordination, etc.). Entries offer in-text cross-references. Adding to the overall appeal is an extensive bibliography organized by topic referencing many of the seminal works in a given subject; a chronology; and five appendixes providing lists of popes, ecumenical councils, summaries of documents from Vatican II, and prayers. This second edition contains an updated and informative introduction reflecting upon the election of Pope Benedict XVI. VERDICT Given the length and breadth of Roman Catholic tradition, Collinge has curated and edited a text that will be informative, accessible, and readable for researchers. Highly recommended for academic, large public, seminary, and parish libraries.\n\n— Library Journal\n\nThis work is a revision of the 1st edition published in 1997 (see ARBA 98, entry 1384). The preface specifies that this volume is not a dictionary of Catholic history but covers the practical, experiential, narrative, doctrinal, ethical, social, and material dimensions of Catholicism. The preface is followed by lists of acronyms and abbreviations, and a chronology of Catholicism beginning with the life of Jesus. The introduction presents a historical overview of Catholicism as it became known today as Roman Catholicism. The main part of the volume is the more than 500 entries arranged alphabetically. At the end, appendixes are found with lists of all popes, ecumenical councils, documents of the Second Vatican Council and papal encyclicals with synopses, and common prayers. The volume is completed with an extensive bibliography and index.\n\n— American Reference Books Annual\n\nGiven the scope of the material and the many controversial topics included, the author has done a fine job of showing the development of doctrine, devotions, and attitudes within the church.\n\nFor someone new or unfamiliar with Catholicism, the entries give enough information to find one’s way.\n\nIt is easy to find subjects and entries, and there is enough information to give a sample of what the discussion about that topic is.\n\n— Theological Librarianship"
