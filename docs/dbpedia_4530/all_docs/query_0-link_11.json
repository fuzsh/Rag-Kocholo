According to him, Dulles, the first chief of the CIA, worked out the original plan to build secret anti-communist guerilla forces across Europe when he was based in Switzerland at the end of the second world war. Dulles, Sir Stewart Menzies (SIS) and the Belgian Premier Paul Henri Spaak codified the plan in a secret pact sometime between 1949 and 1952 under the umbrella of the Clandestine Co-ordinating Committee at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, (SHAPE), which became Nato. \"There was a division of labour between the British and the US,\" he continued, \"with Britain taking responsibility for the operation in France, Belgium, Holland, Portugal and Norway and the Americans looking after Sweden, Finland and the rest of Europe\" (Searchlight, January 1991) 1951 Formation of Clandestine Planning Committee \"In 1951, said the newspaper [Die Welt], Allied intelligence agencies and each participating nation - Germany, Italy and France being among the first - agreed to set up a Committee for planning to oversee the network\" (Associated Press, 13/11/90) 1955-58 CIA control of Italian secret services \"Former defence minister Paulo Taviani [told Magistrate Casson during his 1990 investigation] that during his time in office (1955-1958), the Italian secret services were bossed and financed by the boys in Via Veneto' - ie the CIA agents in the US Embassy in the heart of Rome. (William Scobie, Observer, 18/11/90) 1956 General Giovanni de Lorenzo appointed head of Sifar \"De Lorenzo was...appointed head of the secret services (Sifar) in 1956 by President Granchi, he stayed on as head of Sifar after he was made commander of the carabinieri in 1962.\" (Stuart Christie, \"Stefano de Chiaie\", Anarchy/Refract, 1984) 1956 Formation of Gladio \"US documents declassified in the 1970's show that General Giovanni de Lorenzo, the chief of Sifar (Italian Military Intelligence), joined the US in the 1950's in preparing a plan against a Communist takeover, but did not inform his own government. According to a document released by Mr Andreotti last month the CIA and Sifar sketched a plan in November 1956, codenamed Gladio, to form a force of 1000 men capable of guerilla warfare and espionage. A training base was set-up in Sardinia and 139 weapons and ammunition dumps were hidden in Northern Italy.\" (Wolfgang Achtner, Sunday Independent, 11/11/90) \"Andreotti ... has admitted to parliament that a covert intelligence service was set-up forty years ago, with the help of the CIA and British agents to combat Soviet subversion or aggression. Although no elected representatives save Prime Ministers were told of its existence, it still exists.\" (Wolfgang Achtner, Sunday Independent, 11/11/90) \"The network, run by secret-services of Nato members, was apparently set-up in the 1950's at US instigation to create a guerrilla resistance organisation in the event of a Soviet invasion or communist takeover in Nato countries.\" (John Palmer, Guardian, 10/11/90) \"General sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley, a former commander-in-chief of Nato forces in northern Europe said...that a covert intelligence service was set up in Italy with the help of British agents and the CIA - which also partly funded it. The Italian branch of the network was known as Operation Gladio\" (Richard Norton Taylor, Guardian, 15/11/90) \"Gladio was the name given to the Italian branch of a network with the harmless official name, Allied Co-Ordination Committee, set up with British help in the 1950's, operated by the secret services and partly financed by the United States CIA.\" (Richard Norton-Taylor, Guardian, 16/11/90) Post-1956 Structure of Gladio Gladio was \"Set up to engage in clandestine, non-conventional resistance in the event of invasion. 622 people were recruited and trained by American and British intelligence at the Capo Marrargui base on the northern tip of Sardinia. They were organised in 40 independent cells. Six were responsible for intelligence-gathering, 10 for sabotage, 6 for codes and radio communications, 6 for running escape routes and 12 for guerilla warfare. Five of the guerrilla units were named after flowers such as azalea, rhododendron and broom. Gladio established 139 arms caches, mostly in north-east Italy near the Gorizia gap, through which any Soviet invasion was expected to come. Since then 127 have been recovered, 10 more have been built over, but the last two were probably found by private citizens, but the suspicion remains that they were used by right-wing terrorists.\" (Charles Richards & Simon Jones, Independent, 16/11/90) \"Two Communist MP's [who] got into the [Gladio] secret training base near Alghero, Sardinia, discovered that when the Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti had spoken of 'only 622 units' he had failed to mention that each was a guerrilla chief who would raise 12 to 15 followers to et total of 15,000 men. After training sessions these Gladio chieftains took their 'personal weapons' home to be ready for the Soviet invasion.\" (William Scobie, Observer, 18/11/90) 1/6/59 Gladio Briefing Minute \"A briefing minute of June 1, 1959, reveals Gladio was built around \"internal subversion\". It was to play \"a determining role ...not only on the general policy level of warfare, but also on the politics of emergency. (Ed Vulliamy, Guardian, 5/12/90) \"The Venetian judges [Casson & Mastelloni] came across Gladio when working on a document of 1959 that referred to the militia's \"internal subversion\"... The document, dated June 1, 1959, detailed the \"non-orthodox\" warfare that Gladio would wage against a Warsaw Pact invader, saying the strategy comes from the Nato clandestine planning committee in Paris. But the paper then moves from what it calls \"the Nato level\" to the national level\" - the first dealing with \"invading military forces\" and the second with \"internal subversion,\" both arranged in \"close cooperation between the Italian and American secret services.\" The duty of Gladio is a double one, says the document. The first is objective\" and concerns the \"defence of the Italian territory and population\". The second is defined cryptically as \"subjective\" and is \"concerned with the legitimate authority of the state, and with the eventuality of any serious offences against its integrity.\" Gladio should be ready \"to adopt, with timely readiness, preemptive action to assure the state's prestige, capacity for action and for government\". (Ed Vulliamy, Guardian, 10/12/90) 1959 Gladio joins the Clandestine Planning Committee \"In 1959, Italy was invited to join the Clandestine Planning Committee, the multi-national organ overseen from Belgium by Shape (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe). Sifar began to recruit Italian military personnel and civilians and place them in secret cells. British agents were involved in the training. (Wolgang Achtner, Sunday Independent, 11/11/90) 1960 Founding of Ordine Nuovo Ordine Nuovo was founded by industrialist Pino Rauti. \"It had been strengthened by numerous training courses run by officers of the Italian and Greek armies. It also received financial assistance from the CIA and Belgian neo-nazis.\" (Time Out, 7/4/70) 1964 Operation Solo \"Frightened by the \"opening to the left\" under the Christian Democrat premiership of Aldo Moro and the success at the polls of the Communists who gained 25 per cent of the vote in the 1963 elections, the Italian right began to make plans to pave the way for the installation of a government of \"public safety\" consisting of right-wing Christian Democrats, top managers and military men. General Giovanni de Lorenzo, commander of the paramilitary carabinieri and head of the Italian secret services, together with twenty other senior army officers and allegedly with the knowledge and agreement of president Antonio Segni, drew up a plan for a presidential type coup d'tat. \"Plan Solo\" was to have concluded with the assassination of the premier, Aldo Moro. Executive authority was to have passed to the right wing Christian Democrat Cesare Merzagora. The coup was called off at the final moment by a compromise between the socialists and right wing Christian Democrats. General de Lorenzo and his colleagues were not ones to give in so easily, however, and although their plans were thwarted on this occasion the plotters did not abandon them.\" (S Christie, \"Stefano de Chiaie\", (Anarchy/Refract, 1984)) \"It is not known precisely when Stefano de Chiaie was first recruited as an agent of the Italian secret service, but he was certainly working on behalf of the Interior Ministry as far back as 1960 and he himself has implied knowledge of and involvement with de Lorenzo's \"Plan Solo.\"\" (S Christie, \"Stefano de *Chiaie\", (Anarchy/Refract, 1984)) \"Italians have ]earned that General Giovanni de Lorenzo, as secret services chief, compiled dossiers, including tapes and photographs, on some 150,000 people...De Lorenzo received parliamentary immunity as an MSI (neo-fascist) MP.\" (William Scobie, Observer, 18/11/90) \"By 1964, the plot had thickened. Mr de Lorenzo compiled files on more than 150,000 people, including politicians, priests and unionists. He drew up a plan for the carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary police, to arrest many politicians, take over radio and television networks, and seize the offices and newspapers ()f left-wing parties. After \"Operation Solo\" was leaked, a parliamentary inquiry ruled in 1970 that Mr de Lorenzo had violated the constitution. But he was not preparing his own coup d'tat. He was organising a duplicate of operation Gladio to be activated if the left gained too much power.\" (Wofgang Achtner, Sunday Independent, 11/11/90) 1966-1968 President Cossigas role \"President Francesco Cossiga...had some responsibility for administering Gladio as a junior defence minister from 1966-68.\" (John Wyles, Financial Times, 14/12/90) Late 1960s CIA concern over Gladio \"By the late 1960's the CIA felt Gladio was expensive and out of control, but decided not to close it down because it fostered useful contacts with the Italian security establishment.\" (Edward Lucas, Independent, 16/11/90) 1969-1984 Fascist bomb attacks \"The Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti, sharply denied that there was any link between the group, codenamed Gladio...and a wave of unsolved bombings between 1969 and 1984 in which 143 people were killed...The Communist Party alleged that members of Gladio may have taken part in acts of terrorism nero, or neo-fascist bombings such as that in the waiting room at Bologna Station in August 1980, which killed 85 people in Italy's communist heartland. Four neo-fascists were jailed for life for the crime, and the grand master of the illegal P2 Masonic Lodge, Licio Gelli, was sentenced to 7 years for his involvement in the case. But last July the appeals court overturned the ruling for reasons never clearly explained, causing a national outcry.\" (Fiona Leney & Wolfgang Achtner, Independent, 10/11/90) At the trial of Vincent Vinciguerra (a neo-fascist who took part in a 1972 bomb attack that killed three carabinieri) he told the magistrate; \"that every bombing in Italy after 1969 was linked to one group. \"The orders are given by an apparatus belonging to the state, specifically by a secret parallel structure of the Interior Ministry\" he said.\" (Wolfgang Achtner, Sunday Independent, 11/11/90 \"The most disturbing questions raised by the discovery of \"Gladio\" remain unanswered. How come \"Gladio\" guns and explosives were used in the 1972 Peteano attack in which three policemen were killed...\" (Paddy Agnew, Irish Times, 15/11/90) Early 1970s Meeting between Alexander Haig and Licio Gelli \"In an interview the ex-Nato operative said that Ted Shackley, the CIA's deputy station chief in Rome, \"fixed a meeting between Alexander Haig and Gelli at the US embassy in Rome in the early 1970s, when Haig was President Nixon's Chief of Staff. \"Money\" he said was then filtered to Stay Behind or Gladio with the blessing and knowledge of both Haig and the then head of the US National Security Council, Henry Kissinger. Their aim was to prevent a communist takeover at all costs. 7-8/12/70 Abortive coup attempt by Prince Valesio Borghese \"For four and a half months the whereabouts of Delle Chiaie were to remain a mystery, until the night of 7-8 December 1970, the anniversary of the Japanese surprise attack on the United States fleet at Pearl Harbour in 1941. Then the 'Black prince' Julio Valerio Borghese, ex-commander of Mussolini's Decima MAS (Tenth Light Flotilla) and responsible for a murderous anti-partisan campaign under Mussolini's Salo Republic, gave the order to proceed with the final stages of an attempted coup codenamed \"Tora, Tora\". At 11.15 that evening, Stefano delle Chiaie, commanding 50 neo-nazis, occupied the buildings of the Interior Ministry in Rome. They had gained entrance that morning disguised as workmen and had lain low until Borghese gave the final go ahead for the coup. However at the very last moment the coup was called off. A few minutes before lam on the 8th Borghese received a mysterious telephone call. The identity of the caller is not known, but the name of General Micelli, successor to Admiral Hencke as head of the secret service and commander of the \"Rose of the Winds\" organisation, has been mentioned repeatedly in this connection. What was said during the short conversation was also unknown but speculation has it that Micelli, who was allegedly involved in the shady background of the plot, realised at the last moment that Borghese and his men were being set up by other more powerful factions among the plotters, and decided to warn his friend and advise him to pull out. (S Christie, \"Stefano de Chiaie\", (Anarchy/Refract, 1984)) \"There was [an] abortive coup in December 1970 by Prince Valerio Borghese, a fascist Navy commander. The head of the secret service, General Vito Miceli, was linked to the plotters. At their trial in 1977 he said: \"There has always been a certain top secret organisation, known to the top authorities of the state and operating in the domain of the secret services, that is involved in activities that have nothing to do with intelligence gathering. Likewise, a colonel called Amos Spiazzi, who was investigated for his links with the Borghese coup and the Bologna bombing, talked of an \"organisation operating within the armed forces, that did not have any subversive intention, but was set up to protect the state from the possibility of a Marxist advance.\" A few days ago, Mr Spiazzi, who was acquitted in the trials, said proudly he had been a member of \"Operation Gladio\" since 1960. (Wolfgang Achtner, Sunday Independent, 11/11/90) \"Italians have learned that...General Vito Miceli received an $800,000 handout from the Americans; that Miceli was linked to an abortive coup in 1970 led by Prince Valerio Borghese, a wartime mini-sub commander...Miceli received parliamentary immunity as an MSI (neo-fascist) MP, while Borghese was spirited out of Spain by ex-Nazis.\" (William Scobie, Observer, 18/11/90) \"There are also overlaps between senior Gladio personnel and the committee of military men, Rosi dei Vent; which tried to stage a coup in 1970.\" (Ed Vulliamy, Guardian, 5/12/90) 1971-1974 Head of Gladio \"General Gerardo Serraville [was] head of Gladio from 1971 to 1974.\" (Charles Richards, Independent, 1/12/90) 1972 Gladio meeting \"General Geraldo Serraville, a former head of \"Office R\", told the terrorism commission that at a crucial Gladio meeting in 1972, at least half of the upper echelons \"had the idea of attacking the communists before an invasion.

P2 was a right-wing shadow government, ready to take over Italy, that included four Cabinet Ministers, all three intelligence chiefs, 48 MPs, 160 military officers, bankers, industrialists, top diplomats and the Army Chief of Staff.

The second programme, which showed the gaunt silhouette of \"Agent Zero One\", alleged that P2 was not wound up in the mid-1980s, after the arrest of its leader Licio Gelli. \"It still exists. It calls itself P7,\" he said. According to the agent, the lodge is till functioning with branches in Austria, Switzerland and East Germany. \"Zero One\" has now been revealed by the Italian press to be Dick Brenneke, allegedly a career CIA officer.\" (Richard Bassett, Times, 24/7/90) \"In the programme, Mr Brenneke alleged that, throughout the 1970's the CIA had made large sums of money available to the subversive Masonic Lodge, P2, widely believed to have been involved in the August, 1980 Bologna train station bombing in which 85 people were killed. Furthermore Mr Brenneke claimed that, not only does the CIA continue to secretly finance a revived P2, but that it was involved in the 1986 killing of the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Olaf Palme. According to Mr Brenneke, P2, under the guidance of its Grand master, Mr Licio Gelli, used some of the finance made available by the CIA to set up agencies in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland. These agencies in turn were used by P2 to set up the assassination of Mr Palme, on the orders of the CIA. Finally, and perhaps most sensationally, Mr Brenneke alleged that President Bush, then director of the CIA, not only knew about these CIA activities in Italy (during the late 1970s and early 1980s) but was in fact one of the masterminds behind them. In the 1976 general election, the huge success of the Communist Party...encouraged some to believe that Italy might be close to voting in its first ever Communist government.

He said P2 was also involved in arms and drugs trafficking for the CIA...The programme sparked a political storm in Italy...However a note of caution began to appear after Italian journalists were sent to pour over court records in Oregon. These showed Brenneke had been sued over his business dealings, once by his own brother. An Oregon newspaper turned up evidence that he had been involved in at least three government fraud investigations. Earlier this year he was put on trial in Oregon for allegedly lying under oath about his claims that Bush travelled to Paris in 1980 to make a deal with the Iranians over the American hostages.

The Resistance and Psychological Operations Committee (RPOC) is a covert group within the government-funded Reserve Forces Association (RFA). The RFA is the representative body of British military reservists, and the British component of the NATO-supported Confederation Inter-Allies des Officers de Reserve (CIOR). The RFA-was formed in 1970 and is formally an independent organisation, but its 214 individual and 90 corporate members represent all the reserve units of the armed forces and the government treats it as the spokesman of Britain's reserve forces. Since 1971 the RPOC has been setting up the nucleus of an underground resistance organisation which could rapidly be expanded in the event of a Russian occupation of any part of NATO, including Britain. Close links have been formed with similar units in several European countries, which are actively recruiting 'anti-communist resistance fighters', according to Chapman Pincher. They are also said to have established an intelligence network which NATO chiefs regard as being of great value. The RPOC was set up by a group of World War Two defence chiefs who thought that the need has arisen again for an organisation like the underground wartime Special Operations Executive (SOE), but this time directed against communism. Amongst the group were: General Sir Richard Gale, former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, and founder of the 1st Parachute Brigade; Sir Collin Gubbins, founder of the SOE and the Commandos; Sir John Slessor; Marshal of the Royal Air Force, and former Chief of the Air Staff; and Sir Algernon Willis, Admiral of the Fleet. Under the then Tory government RPOC was given access to Ministry of Defence Departments, including the Joint Warfare Establishment near Salisbury commanded by Maj. Gen. Patrick Ovens, a former Commando. The committee also formed close links with the Special Air Services (SAS), and secured access to the Foreign Office's Information and Research Department, which has historically been used as a cover Department for M16 agents. The MOD gave the RFA a grant to pass on to RPOC. Now, Pincher claims, the Labour government are worried that their supporters will find out that the government has been encouraging a rightwing paramilitary group, and they have therefore been quietly trying to stifle the committee over the past months. RPOC has been deprived of its grant (and thereby its official status), access to Whitehall information has ended, and attendance at NATO meetings forbidden. The committee still exists, however, with General Gale leading the right for its survival.

Condemns the clandestine creation of manipulative and operational networks and Calls for a full investigation into the nature, structure, aims and all other aspects of these clandestine organizations or any splinter groups, their use for illegal interference in the internal political affairs of the countries concerned, the problem of terrorism in Europe and the possible collusion of the secret services of Member States or third countries; 2. Protests vigorously at the assumption by certain US military personnel at SHAPE and in NATO of the right to encourage the establishment in Europe of a clandestine intelligence and operation network; 3. Calls on the governments of the Member States to dismantle all clandestine military and paramilitary networks; 4. Calls on the judiciaries of the countries in which the presence of such military organizations has been ascertained to elucidate fully their composition and modus operandi and to clarify any action they may have taken to destabilize the democratic structures of the Member States; 5. Requests all the Member States to take the necessary measures, if necessary by establishing parliamentary committees of inquiry, to draw up a complete list of organizations active in this field, and at the same time to monitor their links with the respective state intelligence services and their links, if any, with terrorist action groups and/or other illegal practices; 6. Calls on the Council of Ministers to provide full information on the activities of these secret intelligence and operational services; 7. Calls on its competent committee to consider holding a hearing in order to clarify the role and impact of the `GLADIO' organization and any similar bodies; 8. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the Secretary-General of NATO, the governments of the Member States and the United States Government.
