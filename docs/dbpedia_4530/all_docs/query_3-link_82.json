Operation Gladio was a secret network of armed resistance established after WWII by NATO countries in Europe. The network was intended to operate behind enemy lines in the event of a Soviet invasion but later evolved to include acts of terrorism and efforts to influence politics. While originally conceived as anti-communist resistance forces, some groups aligned with extreme right-wing interests and carried out terrorist attacks, falsely attributing them to left-wing groups in a strategy known as \"tension\" to influence politics. The existence and activities of Gladio were denied for decades but have since been acknowledged, raising questions about state sponsorship of terrorism for political goals.",
