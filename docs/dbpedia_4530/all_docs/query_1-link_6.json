A license by endorsement to engage in an occupation or profession in this State issued pursuant to this section may be issued at a meeting of the regulatory body or between its meetings by the presiding member of the regulatory body and the executive head of the regulatory body. Such an action shall be deemed to be an action of the regulatory body.\n\n6. A regulatory body may deny an application for licensure by endorsement if:\n\n(a) An applicant willfully fails to comply with the provisions of paragraph (g) of subsection 2; or\n\n(b) The report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicates that the applicant has been convicted of a crime that would be grounds for taking disciplinary action against the applicant as a licensee and the regulatory body has not previously taken disciplinary action against the licensee based on that conviction.\n\n7. The provisions of this section are intended to supplement other provisions of statute governing licensure by endorsement. If any provision of statute conflicts with this section, the other provision of statute prevails over this section to the extent that the other provisions provide more specific requirements relating to licensure by endorsement."
