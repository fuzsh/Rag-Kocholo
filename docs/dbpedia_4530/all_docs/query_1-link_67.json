Wabanaki translates as “People of the Dawn.” The Wabanaki Nations have stewarded Maine for generations, stretching back to before colonial settlers forcibly occupied the area. NRCM’s office in Augusta is on the unceded territory of the Penobscot Nation, and all of us in Maine are on unceded lands once overseen by Wabanaki people. Let us remember this history and move forward with a commitment to justice and alignment with Wabanaki Nations in Maine. (Read full land acknowledgement.)"
