        "text": "Home\n\nInsights\n\nHong Kong Company Law\n\nKey changes under the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622)\n\nHong Kong company law\n\nINTRODUCTION – Key Changes\n\nThe New Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) (the “New CO”) came into force on 3 March 2014. The previous Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32)(the “Old CO”) has been retitled as the “Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32)”. The core provisions affecting the operation of companies under the Old CO have been repealed, except those provisions relating to winding-up and insolvency of companies and prospectuses.\n\nThis note contains a summary of the key changes affecting directors of Hong Kong companies.\n\nPart Key areas 1 Changes affecting directors of HK companies 2 Changes concerning share capital, transactions involving share capital and registration of share transfers 3 Company administration, procedure and operations 4 Registration of charges 5 Financial reporting 6 Schemes of arrangement, amalgamations and compulsory share acquisitions 7 Abolition of memorandum of association and matters relating to the articles of association\n\nPart 1 – Changes affecting directors of HK companies\n\n1.1. STANDARD OF DIRECTORS’ DUTY OF CARE, SKILL AND DILIGENCE\n\nNew CO references: sections 465 to 466\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nThe Old CO did not contain specific provisions on directors’ duty of care, skill and diligence. General common law and fiduciary duties of directors are based on case law.\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nThe New CO codifies a director’s duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence.\n\nSection 465 of the New CO requires a director to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence, meaning the care, skill and diligence that would be exercised by a reasonably diligent person with:\n\nthe general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the functions carried out by the director in relation to the company (an objective test); and\n\nthe general knowledge, skill and experience that the director has (a subjective test).\n\nThe new statutory duty applies equally to a shadow director of a company, being a person in accordance with whose directions the directors, or a majority of directors, are accustomed to act. Section 466 retains the existing civil consequences of breach of the duty.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nIn carrying out his duties, a director of a Hong Kong company must bring to bear his own general knowledge, skills and experience (the subjective part of the assessment), as well as the knowledge, skills and experience that would reasonably be expected of a director carrying out the same functions (the objective part of the assessment).\n\nIf a director has special knowledge, skill or experience, then such director will be subject to a higher standard of care under the New CO compared to a director without such knowledge. Conversely, a director will be expected to meet an objective reasonable standard of care, even if the director is in fact under-qualified for the role.\n\nThe New CO does not codify common law fiduciary duties, which remain subject to current case law. These fiduciary duties include the duty to act in good faith in the interests of the company, the duty to exercise powers for their proper purpose, and the duty to avoid conflicts of interest (as explained below, directors are also required under the New CO to disclose material interests in significant transactions of the company). A director may have additional duties and obligations under a company’s articles of association, as well as under the director’s individual terms of engagement. The Companies Registry’s Guide on Directors’ Duties has been revised to reflect the new statutory duty.\n\nApplication to Hong Kong listed companies\n\nWhile section 465 of the Companies Ordinance does not apply directly to the directors of non-Hong Kong companies (i.e. companies incorporated outside Hong Kong), the directors of a non-Hong Kong company which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange must comply with it since they are required by Listing Rule 3.08 to exercise duties of skill, care and diligence to the standard set by Hong Kong law. It should also be noted that the Exchange’s Guidance Letter HKEx-GL62-13 was recently revised to state that listed company directors are expected to comply with the Companies Registry’s Guide on Directors’ Duties and that failure to do so may constitute a breach of the Listing Rules (at paragraph 2.8).\n\n1.2. The concept of “responsible person”\n\nA number of offences under the Old CO applied not only to the company but also to officers of the company who were in default. This is also the case under the NCO, but the concept of “responsible person” has replaced that of “officer in default” under the OCO. The effect is to lower the threshold for a breach or contravention of provisions of the ordinance.\n\nUnder the OCO, an officer of a company who is in default, amongst others, is liable to punishment in respect of offences committed by the company. “Officer in default” was defined under section 351(2) of the OCO as:\n\nany officer or any shadow director of the company;\n\nwho knowingly and willfully authorises or permits the default, refusal or contravention of the relevant provisions.\n\nSection 3(2) NCO defines a “responsible person” of a company or non-Hong Kong company as an officer (i.e. a director, manager or company secretary) or shadow director of the company or non-Hong Kong company who “authorises or permits, or participates in, the contravention or failure”.\n\nSection 3(3) extends the scope of a “responsible person” to cover an officer or shadow director of a body corporate that is an officer or shadow director of a company or non-Hong Kong company.\n\nThere are three key differences between the definitions of “officer in default” and “responsible person”:\n\nthe definition of “responsible person” is wider so that if the officer or shadow director is a body corporate (which includes both Hong Kong and non-Hong Kong companies), the officers and shadow directors of that body corporate are also responsible persons;\n\nthe scope of the offence has been expanded to include “participation” in the contravention, such that omissions or assistance to others in committing offences by officers and shadow directors are also included;\n\nthe definition of “responsible person” removes the mental element of “knowingly and willfully” so that reckless acts and omissions by officers will also be covered\n\nThe following are examples of offences under the New Ordinance for which every responsible person of the company is punishable upon conviction:\n\nfailure to provide information to the Companies Registrar;\n\nfailure to notify or register with the Companies Registrar in respect of alteration of the company’s articles, change of the company’s name, return of allotment, alteration of share capital etc.;\n\nreduction of share capital;\n\nacquisition of own shares;\n\nfinancial assistance by the company or its subsidiaries for the purchase of its own shares;\n\nbreach of requirements in relation to financial statements and reporting documents;\n\nbreach of requirements in relation to company’s auditors\n\nFollowing the introduction of the new concept, it is likely that the Companies Registry will institute more prosecution actions against directors, managers and company secretaries for infringements of the New Ordinance.\n\n1.3. RATIFICATION OF DIRECTOR’S CONDUCT\n\nNew CO reference: section 473\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nThere was no specific provision in the Old CO on shareholder ratification of director’s conduct. Under common law, shareholders can ratify breaches by directors of their fiduciary duties. Ratification means that the company is barred from bringing actions against the director for damages arising from the ratified breach (although a dissenting minority shareholder may still be able to pursue an unfair prejudice or statutory derivative claim). Ratification can give rise to potential conflicts of interest where a majority shareholder is also a director, or is otherwise connected to a director.\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nThe New CO requires that any ratification by a company of a director’s (including a shadow director’s) conduct amounting to negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company must be approved by a resolution of disinterested shareholders.\n\nFor the purpose of ratification, votes in favour of the resolution of the following categories of shareholders are to be disregarded:\n\na director of the company whose conduct is to be ratified;\n\nan entity connected with that director; or\n\na holder of any shares in the company in trust for that director or connected entity.\n\nIf none of the shareholders are disinterested, then approval must be by unanimous consent of all shareholders.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nThe independent ratification requirement should provide a more preventative protection for minority shareholders, compared to statutory derivative or unfair prejudice remedies, which would normally be taken by a dissenting minority shareholder after a breach has already occurred. At the same time, the new rule should not impact significantly on small companies that normally take shareholder decisions by way of unanimous written consent.\n\n1.4. LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS\n\nExempting directors from liability to the company\n\nAny provision which purports to exempt a director from liability owed to the company where there has been negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by the director in relation to the company is void under Sections 468(1) & (2) of the New Ordinance.\n\nIndemnifying directors against liability to the company / an associated company\n\nSimilarly, any provision which indemnifies a director of the company, or a director of an associated company of the company, against liability owed to the company or an associated company where there has been negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by the director in relation to the company or associated company is void under Section 468(3) of the New Ordinance.\n\nThe definition of “associated company” in the New CO is identical to that of “related company” in the Old CO, which it replaces, and means a company’s subsidiaries, holding companies and subsidiaries of such holding companies.\n\nIndemnifying directors against liability to third parties\n\nThere were no specific provisions in the Old CO regulating a director’s right to be indemnified against liabilities owes to third parties. The scope of the right of directors to be indemnified against liabilities to third parties, which had developed in case law, was not clear.\n\nThe New CO clarifies the rules on indemnification of directors against liabilities to third parties (i.e. parties other than the company or its associated companies). Section 469 permits a company to indemnify a director against liability incurred by the director to a third party provided that the indemnity does not relate to:\n\ncriminal fines;\n\nregulatory penalties;\n\ndefence costs of criminal proceedings in which the director is convicted;\n\ndefence costs of civil proceedings brought by or on behalf of the company and in which judgment is given against the director.\n\nCommon law continues to govern any potential indemnities that fall outside the statutory prohibitions and exclusions described above.\n\nA company which provides any permitted indemnity to its or its associated company’s directors must disclose the indemnity provision in the directors’ report under section 470 of the New CO. It must also keep a copy of any permitted indemnity at its registered office until one year after its expiry and make it available for inspection by members on request (sections 471 and 472 of the New CO). Failure to retain copies of permitted indemnities at the registered office is an offence for which the company and its responsible persons may be fined.\n\nPurchase of Directors’ Insurance\n\nThe New Ordinance does not prohibit a company from purchasing insurance for directors and the Model Articles envisage that directors can be insured against liability in certain situations. Article 32 of the Model Articles (Article 36 for public companies) provides that a company may, at the expense of the company, purchase insurance for a director of the company against:\n\nprimary liability: a director’s liability to any person in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust (except for fraud) in relation to the company or an associated company;\n\ncosts of proceedings: a director’s liability in defending any proceedings (civil or criminal) for any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust (including fraud) in relation to the company or an associated company.\n\nFor listed companies, paragraph A.1.8 of Appendix 14 (Corporate Governance Code and Corporate Governance Report) of the Hong Kong Listing Rules requires a listed company to arrange appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against its directors. Compliance with this code provision is not mandatory, but a listed company would need to explain the reasons for any non-compliance in its annual report.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nCompanies and their directors should review the scope of any indemnities granted to directors to see if these should now be extended to cover indemnification against third party liabilities.\n\nAlthough the New CO prohibits a company from exempting or indemnifying a director from liability for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by the director in relation to the company, it does not prohibit a company from taking out insurance for directors of the company and/or its associated companies against such liabilities (except for fraud) to the company or an associated company. Therefore, any existing directors’ and officers’ (D&O) insurance policies should also be reviewed to see if coverage should be extended.\n\nPermitted exemptions from liability, indemnities for liability to a third party and any undertaking to take out D&O insurance should be clearly set out in a director’s service contract, even if the company’s articles already include standard exemption, indemnification and insurance wording. The articles are a contract between the company and the shareholders, so a director would have difficulty enforcing an exemption, indemnity or undertaking contained only in the articles. Hong Kong courts have also been reluctant to imply provisions from a company’s articles of association into the terms of appointment of a director, particularly if there is a contract between the director and company that is expressed to constitute the entire agreement between the parties. A director should therefore ensure that any provisions in the articles on which he wishes to rely should be expressly incorporated into the terms of the director’s engagement.\n\nThe scope of any director indemnity should also be considered, in particular whether it covers only liabilities arising from the performance of the director qua director, or in other capacities (for example, as chief financial officer) or in a personal capacity.\n\nCopies of permitted indemnity provisions to directors must be kept at the company’s registered office and made available free of charge upon request by a member of the company.\n\n1.5. LOANS TO DIRECTORS AND SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS\n\nNew CO references: sections 484 to 490, 491 to 515\n\nSection 500 of the New CO prohibits a Hong Kong company from making a loan to, or giving a guarantee or providing security in connection with a loan made by any person to:\n\nits directors;\n\ndirectors of its holding company (“holdco directors”); or\n\ncompanies (whether incorporated in Hong Kong or not) controlled by the company’s directors or holdco directors.\n\nThe New Ordinance is more stringent than the Old Ordinance in that the prohibitions under the Old Ordinance did not extend to non-Hong Kong incorporated companies controlled by directors.\n\nSpecified Companies\n\nMore stringent provisions apply to “specified companies” which are Hong Kong public companies and their subsidiaries (including private companies and companies limited by guarantee). Specified companies are additionally prohibited from:\n\nmaking quasi-loans to, and entering into credit transactions as creditors for, directors of the company or its holding company (or providing security for or guaranteeing such quasi-loans or credit transactions); and\n\nmaking loans or quasi-loans to, and entering into credit transactions as creditors for, certain categories of persons connected with directors of the company or its holding company (or providing security for or guaranteeing such quasi-loans or credit transactions).\n\nThe prohibitions under the New Ordinance are wider than under the Old Ordinance in that:\n\nUnder the Old Ordinance, the prohibitions on quasi-loans and credit transactions only applied to private companies and companies limited by guarantee that are members of a listed group. Under the New Ordinance, the prohibitions apply to subsidiaries of all Hong Kong public companies; and\n\nThe New Ordinance extends the categories of persons connected with company or holdco directors which are covered by the prohibitions.\n\nProhibition on Quasi-loans\n\nSpecified companies are prohibited from:\n\nmaking a quasi-loan to a director of the company or its holding company, or giving a guarantee or providing security in connection with a quasi-loan made by any person to such a director (ss.501(1) and (2)); or\n\nmaking a loan or quasi-loan to an entity connected with a director of the company or its holding company (a “connected entity”), or giving a guarantee or providing security in connection with a loan or quasi-loan made by any person to a connected entity (s.502(1) and (2)).\n\nA company makes a “quasi-loan” to a director or a connected entity if it:\n\npays or agrees to pay a sum for the director or connected entity:\n\non terms that the director or connected entity (or another person on their behalf) will reimburse the company;\n\nin circumstances giving rise to a liability on the director or connected entity to reimburse the company; or\n\nreimburses or agrees to reimburse expenditure incurred by another person for the director or connected entity:\n\non terms that the director or connected entity (or another person on their behalf) will reimburse the company; or\n\nin circumstances giving rise to a liability on the director or connected entity to reimburse the company (section 493(1)).\n\n“Connected entity” is defined in section 486 of the New CO as:\n\na spouse;\n\na child, step-child, illegitimate child or adopted child of any age;\n\na parent;\n\na cohabitee;\n\na minor child, minor step-child, minor illegitimate child or minor adopted child of the cohabitee who lives with the director;\n\na trustee of a trust the beneficiaries of which include the director, his spouse, his minor children (other than employee share schemes or pension schemes)(“connected trustee”);\n\nan associated company, meaning a company in which the director and/or his spouse, minor children or connected trustee control more than 30% of the voting power of the company; and\n\na business partner of the director or his spouse, minor children or connected trustee.\n\nProhibition on Credit transactions\n\nSpecified companies are prohibited by section 503 from:\n\nentering into a credit transaction as creditor for:\n\na director of the company or its holding company; or\n\na connected entity of a director of the company or its holding company; or\n\ngiving a guarantee or providing security in connection with a credit transaction entered into by the company as creditor for:\n\na director of the company or its holding company; or\n\na connected entity of a director of the company or its holding company.\n\n“Credit transaction” is defined under section 494 of the New CO as:\n\nthe supply of goods under a hire-purchase agreement;\n\nthe sale of goods or land under a conditional sale agreement;\n\nthe lease or hire of goods or lease of land to a director or his connected entity in return for periodical payments; and\n\nthe supply of goods or services or disposal of land to a director or his connected entity on the understanding that payment is to be deferred.\n\nProhibition on Arrangements seeking to circumvent sections 500 to 503 (s.504)\n\nThe New CO retains the previous prohibitions on a company seeking to circumvent the prohibitions under sections 500 to 503.\n\nSection 504 prohibits a Hong Kong incorporated company from:\n\ntaking part in any arrangement under which a third party enters into a transaction with a director of the company or its holding company, a company controlled by such a director or a connected entity of such a director which, if entered into by the company, would be prohibited under sections 500 to 503 (a “questionable transaction”) where the third party will obtain a benefit from the company or its associated company; or\n\narranging for an assignment to it, or the assumption by it, of any rights, obligations or liabilities under a questionable transaction entered into by a third party with a director of the company or its holding company, a company controlled by such a director or a connected entity of such a director.\n\nExemptions\n\nShareholder approval\n\nThe Old CO exempted private companies which are not part of a listed group from the prohibition on loans provided that shareholder approval was obtained. The New CO has extended the exemption so that all companies, including public companies, are exempt from the prohibitions on loans, quasi-loans and credit transactions if prior shareholder approval is obtained in accordance with section 496 of the New Ordinance. Arrangements and assignments in respect of questionable transactions are also exempt from the prohibitions under Section 504 if prior shareholder approval is obtained.\n\nSection 496 requires that:\n\nthe approval must be obtained before the transaction is entered into;\n\na memorandum setting out the following matters must be sent to all shareholders together with the notice of general meeting, or if the resolution is to be passed as a written resolution, before or at the same time as the resolution is sent to them:\n\nin the case of a loan or quasi-loan:\n\nthe nature of the transaction to be approved by the resolution;\n\nthe amount of the loan or quasi-loan;\n\nthe purpose for which the loan or quasi-loan is required; and\n\nthe extent of the company’s liability under any transaction connected with the loan or quasi-loan;\n\nin the case of a credit transaction:\n\nthe nature of the transaction to be approved by the resolution;\n\nthe amount and value of the credit transaction\n\nthe purpose for which the goods, land or services supplied, sold, leased, hired or disposed of under the credit transaction are required; and\n\nthe extent of the company’s liability under any transaction connected with credit transaction; and\n\nin the case of a resolution for the purposes of section 504:\n\nthe matters that would have to be disclosed if the company were seeking approval of the transaction to which the arrangement relates;\n\nthe nature of the arrangement to be approved by the resolution; and\n\nthe extent of the company’s liability under the arrangement.\n\nin the case of specified companies (i.e. public companies and their subsidiaries) disinterested shareholder approval is required.\n\nAccordingly, the vote of the following members in favour of the transaction will be disregarded:\n\nthe director of the company or its holding company to whom the loan or quasi-loan is made;\n\na company controlled by a director of the company or its holding company to whom the loan or quasi-loan is made;\n\na person holding shares in the company on trust for a director or controlled company referred to in (i) or (ii) above;\n\na connected entity to whom the loan or quasi-loan is made;\n\na director connected with a connected entity in (iv) above;\n\na person holding shares in the company on trust for a connected entity or director in (v) above;\n\nthe director or connected entity for whom a credit transaction is entered into;\n\nthe director connected with the connected entity in (vii) above;\n\na person holding shares in the company on trust for a connected entity or director in (vii) or (viii) above;\n\na company controlled by, or a connected entity of, a director of the company or its holding company for whom the arrangement is entered into;\n\na director:\n\nwho controls the controlled company or is connected with the connected entity referred to in (x) above ;or\n\nfor whom the arrangement is entered into; and\n\na person holding shares in the company on trust for a controlled company in (x) above or a director in (xi) above.\n\nOther exemptions\n\nThere are certain other exemptions (“other exemptions”) from the prohibition on loans and similar transactions described above which are set out in sections 505 to 512 of the New CO. These include two new exemptions for: (i) transactions with a value below 5% of the net assets of the company or 5% of the called-up share capital; and (ii) expenditure in connection with defending proceedings, investigations or regulatory actions for misconduct (provided the director repays the company if he is found guilty or to have committed the misconduct).\n\nExemptions are available for the following:\n\nLoans, quasi-loans and credit transactions with a value not exceeding 5% of net assets or called-up share capital (s.505)(New)\n\nA loan, quasi-loan or credit transaction, or the provision of a guarantee or security for any of the foregoing is exempt if the aggregate of the value of the transaction in question, and the value of any other relevant transaction or arrangement, does not exceed 5% of the company’s net assets or called-up share capital.\n\nExpenditure on company business (s.506)\n\nA transaction is exempt from the prohibitions under sections 500 to 503 if it is entered into for the purposes of providing the director, a company controlled by the director or a connected entity with funds to meet expenditure (or avoid expenditure) incurred for the purposes of the company or to enable the director, controlled company or connected entity to perform duties as an officer of the company.\n\nExpenditure on defending proceedings (s.507)(New)\n\nA transaction is exempt from the prohibitions under sections 500 to 503 if it provides a director with funds to meet expenditure incurred in defending any criminal or civil proceedings in connection with any alleged negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by the director in relation to the company or an associated company of the company or to avoid incurring such expenditure.\n\nThe exemption applies subject to the condition that the funds must be repaid (or any liability to the company must be discharged) if the director is convicted or judgment is given against him.\n\nExpenditure in connection with investigation or regulatory action (s.508)(New)\n\nA transaction is exempt if it provides a director with funds to put up a defence in an investigation, or against any action taken or proposed to be taken, by a regulatory authority in connection with any alleged misconduct by the director in relation to the company or an associated company. The exemption is subject to the condition that the funds must be repaid (or any liability to the company must be discharged) if the director is found to have committed the misconduct.\n\nHome loan (s.509)\n\nA transaction is exempt if it is entered into for the purposes of:\n\nthe purchase of any residential premises for use as the only or main residence of a director of the company; an employee of the company who is a holdco director or an employee of the company who is a connected entity of a company or holdco director;\n\nimproving any residential premises so used; or\n\nsubstituting any transaction entered into by any other person for a purpose in (i) or (ii) above.\n\nThe following conditions apply:\n\nat the time the transaction is entered into, it must not exceed 10% of the value of the company’s net assets as determined by reference to the company’s relevant financial statements or, if no relevant financial statements have been prepared, 10% of the amount of the company’s called-up share capital;\n\nthe company must ordinarily enter into transactions for the above purposes on terms no less favourable than those on which the transaction in question is entered into;\n\na valuation report on the residential premises must be made and signed by a professionally qualified valuation surveyor within 3 months before the date of the transaction; and\n\nthe transaction in question must be secured by a legal mortgage on the residential premises.\n\nLeasing goods and land (s.510)\n\nLeasing or hiring goods or leasing land to a director, a company controlled by a director or a connected entity of a director is exempt if:\n\nthe transaction does not exceed 10% of the company’s net assets as determined by reference to the company’s relevant financial statements or, if no relevant financial statements have been prepared, 10% of the amount of the company’s called-up share capital; and\n\nthe terms of the transaction are not more favourable than what is reasonable to expect the company to have offered on the open market to a person unconnected with the company.\n\nTransaction entered into in ordinary course of business (s.511)\n\nA loan or quasi-loan, or giving a guarantee or providing security for a loan or quasi-loan, is exempt if:\n\nit is made, given or provided by the company in the ordinary course of its business; and\n\nits amount is not greater than, and its terms are not more favourable, than what it is reasonable to expect the company to have offered to a person of the same financial standing but unconnected with the company (s.511(1).\n\nA credit transaction loan, or giving a guarantee or providing security for a credit transaction, is exempt if:\n\nit is entered into in the ordinary course of the company’s business; and\n\nits amount is not greater than, and its terms are not more favourable, than what it is reasonable to expect the company to have offered to a person of the same financial standing but unconnected with the company (s.511(2).\n\nIntra-group transaction (s.512)\n\nTransactions between members of a group of companies are exempt from the prohibitions under sections 500 to 503.\n\nCivil consequences of contravention (s.513)\n\nUnder the New CO, criminal sanctions no longer apply to breaches of the prohibitions in sections 500 to 504.\n\nIf a company enters into a transaction in contravention of these prohibitions, the transaction is voidable at the company’s instance unless:\n\nrestitution is no longer possible;\n\nthe company has been indemnified for loss resulting from the transaction or arrangement;\n\na third party (other than the director, his controlled body corporates or connected entities) has in good faith acquired rights for value and without actual notice of the contravention, and those rights would be affected by the avoidance; or\n\nthe transaction is affirmed by the shareholders of the company and / or the holding company (as applicable) within a reasonable period after it is entered into in accordance with section 514 of the New Ordinance.\n\nWhether or not the transaction has been avoided, the following persons will be liable to account to the company for any gain made and to indemnify the company for any loss resulting from the transaction or arrangement:\n\na director of the company, or of a holding company of the company, for whom the company entered into the transaction or arrangement;\n\na body corporate controlled by such a director, or a connected entity of such a director, for whom the company entered into the transaction or arrangement;\n\nthe director of the company who controls such a body corporate or with whom such an entity is connected;\n\nthe director of a holding company of the company who controls such a body corporate or with whom such an entity is connected; and\n\nany other director of the company who authorised the transaction or arrangement.\n\nDefences\n\nThe New Ordinance creates the following defences:\n\nFor a controlled body corporate or connected entity of a director\n\nIt is a defence if it establishes that, at the time the transaction or arrangement was entered into, it was not aware of the circumstances constituting the contravention (s513(4)(a)).\n\nFor the director of the company (and its holding company) who controls the body corporate or with whom the entity is connected\n\nIt is a defence if the director establishes that he took all reasonable steps to secure the company’s compliance with the relevant provisions (s513(4)(b)).\n\nFor any other director of the company who authorised the transaction or arrangement\n\nIt is a defence if the director establishes that, at the time the transaction or arrangement was entered into, he was not aware of the circumstances constituting the contravention (s513(4)(c)).\n\nSummary table\n\nThe table below summarises the prohibitions on loans and similar transactions to directors and other parties under the New CO.\n\nTRANSACTION (INCLUDES SECURITY OR GUARANTEE IN CONNECTION WITH TRANSACTION): PRIVATE COMPANIES PUBLIC COMPANIES AND SUBSIDIARIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE COMPANIES AND COMPANIES LIMITED BY GUARANTEE) Loans to directors of Hong Kong company or body corporates controlled by those directors Prohibited unless approved by shareholders, or other exemption applies Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders, or other exemption applies Loans to holdco directors or body corporates controlled by those holdco directors\n\nProhibited unless approved by shareholders and holdco’s shareholders (if holdco is a Hong Kong company)*, or other exemption applies\n\nProhibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders and holdco’s disinterested shareholders (if holdco is a Hong Kong company)*, or other exemption applies Loans to connected entities of directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders, or other exemption applies Loans to connected entities of holdco directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders and holdco’s disinterested shareholders (if holdco is a Hong Kong company)*, or other exemption applies Quasi-loans to directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders, or other exemption applies Quasi-loans to holdco directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders and the holdco’s disinterested shareholders (if holdco is a Hong Kong company)*, or other exemption applies Quasi-loans to connected entities of directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders, or other exemption applies Quasi-loans to connected entities of holdco directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders and holdco’s disinterested shareholders (if holdco is a Hong Kong company)*, or other exemption applies Credit transactions for directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders, or other exemption applies Credit transactions for holdco directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders and holdco’s disinterested shareholders (if holdco is a Hong Kong company)*, or other exemption applies Credit transactions for connected entities of directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders, or other exemption applies Credit transactions for connected entities of holdco directors Not prohibited Prohibited unless approved by disinterested shareholders and holdco’s disinterested shareholders (if holdco is a Hong Kong company)*, or other exemption applies\n\n* Note: Only holdco disinterested shareholder approval required if company is a wholly-owned subsidiary and holdco is a Hong Kong company\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nCompanies should amend their existing policies and internal controls in respect of loans and similar transactions with directors to ensure that they cover the additional categories of entities (such as non-Hong Kong incorporated controlled entities, and new types of connected entities) that fall within the scope of the prohibitions.\n\nAt the same time, some of the new changes are likely to facilitate business for Hong Kong companies, in particular the introduction of new exemptions, and the extension of the shareholder approval exemption to all companies (albeit requiring approval of disinterested shareholders in the case of “specified companies”).\n\nWhere a company is seeking shareholder approval for a particular transaction, it must send shareholders a memorandum containing information on the nature of the transaction, the amount of the loan, quasi-loan or credit transaction, its purpose and the extent of the company’s liability.\n\n1.6. DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS\n\nNew CO references: sections 530 to 535\n\nThe New CO requires a company to obtain shareholder approval before entering into any contract under which the guaranteed term of employment of a director (including a shadow director) with the company exceeds or may exceed three years (whether under the original contract or under a new contract entered into pursuant to it). Where a company enters into a further service contract (not pursuant to a term of the original contract) more than 6 months before the end of the guaranteed term of a director’s contract, the guaranteed term of employment under the further contract is taken to include the unexpired period of the guaranteed term under the original contract.\n\nIf the company is a public company, approval of the company’s disinterested shareholders is required. Accordingly, votes in favour of approving a relevant contract of the following categories of shareholders are to be disregarded:\n\nthe director with whom the service contract is proposed to be entered into; and\n\nany person holding shares in the company on trust for that director.\n\nIn order for the shareholders’ approval to be valid:\n\nit must be given before the company agrees to the relevant provision; and\n\na memorandum setting out the proposed service contract (including the provision in question) must be sent to shareholders with the notice convening the general meeting, or if the resolution is to be passed as a written resolution, either at or before the time at which the proposed resolution is sent to shareholders.\n\nConsequences of Breach (s. 535)\n\nIf a service contract is entered into in breach of these requirements, the provision granting long-term employment will be void and the contract is regarded as containing a term entitling the company to terminate it at any time on reasonable notice. The restrictions also apply to service contracts which relate to services to be provided by a director to a company’s subsidiary.\n\n1.7. PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE\n\nNew CO references: sections 516 to 529\n\nSection 521(1) of the New CO prohibits a Hong Kong company from making any payment by way of compensation for loss of office or as consideration for retirement from office to a director or former director of the company unless the payment has been approved by the company’s shareholders in the manner prescribed in section 518.\n\nSection 521(2) of the New CO additionally prohibits a Hong Kong company from making any payment by way of compensation for loss of office or as consideration for retirement from office to a director or former director of its holding company unless the payment has been approved by the company’s shareholders and the holding company’s shareholders in the manner prescribed in section 518. However, if a company’s holding company is incorporated outside Hong Kong, the payment need only be approved by the company’s shareholders (s.521(3)(a)).\n\nThe New CO extends the prohibition on payments for loss of office to include:\n\na payment to a connected entity (as defined in s486) of a director or former director; and\n\na payment to a person made at the direction, or for the benefit, of a director or former director or a connected entity of such a director (s.516(3))\n\npayments made in connection with a transfer of the undertaking or property of the company or of its subsidiary (s.522); and\n\npayments made in connection with a transfer of shares in the company, or in a subsidiary of the company, resulting from a takeover offer (s.523).\n\nShareholder Approval\n\nWhere shareholder approval is to be obtained, it must be obtained before the payment for loss of office is made and a memorandum setting out particulars of the payment must be sent to shareholders either:\n\ntogether with the notice of general meeting at which the resolution will be passed; or\n\nif the resolution is to be passed as a written resolution, before or at the same time as the resolution is sent to shareholders.\n\nWhere the payment is made by a public company, disinterested shareholder approval is required.\n\nExemptions\n\nThe prohibitions are subject to the following exemptions:\n\nExemption for payments in discharge of a legal obligation\n\nThe following payments are exempt:\n\npayments in discharge of an existing legal obligation;\n\npayments by way of damages for breach of an existing legal obligation;\n\npayments by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a person’s office or employment; and\n\npayments by way of pension for past services; and\n\nExemption for small payment\n\nPayments not exceeding $100,000 when aggregated with all other payments for loss of office made by the company or a subsidiary to the director or former director in connection with the same event are exempt.\n\nConsequences of Breach\n\nThe recipient of a payment for loss of office that breaches section 521 will hold the relevant amount on trust for the company, and any director who authorised the payment will be liable to indemnify the company for any loss resulting from the payment.\n\n1.8. DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS\n\nNew CO references: sections 536 to 542\n\nInterests to be disclosed\n\nThe New CO, like the Old CO, requires a director who has a material interest in a contract or proposed contract with the company that is of significance to the company’s business, to disclose to the board of directors the nature of such interest at the earliest meeting of directors that is practicable.\n\nThe scope of disclosure under the New CO is widened to cover “transactions” and “arrangements” as well as “contracts”, and directors must disclose the “extent” as well as the “nature” of the interest (s536(1)).\n\nDirectors of public companies are additionally required to disclose material interests of their connected entities (but only if they are aware, or ought reasonably to be aware, of the interest or the relevant transaction, arrangement or contract). Section 540 of the New CO also extends the disclosure requirements to shadow directors and sets out the procedures for a shadow director to provide general notice of his interests.\n\nDirectors are not however required to declare their interest in the terms of their service contracts which are to be considered by the board.\n\nIf a declaration proves subsequently to be, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, the director must make a further declaration.\n\nProcedure for declaration of directors’ interests\n\nTiming\n\nWhere a director has an interest in a transaction, arrangement or contract that has already been entered into, his declaration of interest must be made as soon as reasonably practicable. A director’s interest in a proposed transaction, arrangement or contract must be declared before the company enters into the relevant transaction, arrangement or contract.\n\nMethod\n\nA declaration of interest must be made:\n\nat a directors’ meeting;\n\nby notice in writing sent to the other directors; or\n\nby general notice.\n\nWhere a declaration of interest is to be made by notice in writing to the directors:\n\nit must be sent:\n\nin hard copy form by hand or post; or\n\nin electronic form if the recipient has agreed to receive it by electronic means; and\n\nthe making of the declaration will be regarded as forming part of the proceedings at the next directors’ meeting after the notice is given.\n\nA general notice is a notice to the effect that the director:\n\nhas an interest in a body corporate or firm specified in the notice and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction, arrangement or contract that is entered into with that body corporate or firm; or\n\nis connected with an individual specified in the notice and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction, arrangement or contract that is entered into with that individual.\n\nA general notice must state:\n\nthe nature and extent of the director’s interest in the specified body corporate or firm; or\n\nthe nature of the director’s connection with the specified individual.\n\nA general notice given at a directors’ meeting takes effect on the date of the meeting. A general notice may also be given in writing sent to the company in which case it will take effect 21 days after it is sent to the company. The company must send a copy of a director’s written general notice to the other directors of the company within 15 days after it receives the notice (s.541).\n\nConsequences of Contravention\n\nA director or shadow director who fails to disclose a material interest commits an offence and may be liable to a fine of $100,000.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nDirectors and shadow directors should be made aware of the new disclosure requirements. In many cases, directors disclose their interests in particular businesses by way of general notice (to avoid the need for repeated declarations). Directors should consider updating any general disclosures in order to ensure that their disclosures comply with the wider disclosure obligations under the New CO.\n\n1.9. RESTRICTING CORPORATE DIRECTORSHIPS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES\n\nReferences: sections 456 and 457\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nUnder the Old CO, public companies and private companies within the same group as a listed company were prohibited from appointing a body corporate as their director. However, the prohibition did not apply to other private companies.\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nSection 456 of the New CO restates the prohibition on corporate directorships for public companies, private companies within the same group as a listed company and companies limited by guarantee. Section 457 now also requires other private companies (other than those within the same group as a listed company) to have at least one director who is a natural person.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nHong Kong private companies that are engaging corporate secretarial service providers to provide nominee corporate directors need to ensure that at least one natural person is appointed as a director.\n\nPart 2 – Changes concerning share capital, transactions involving share capital and registration of share transfers\n\n2.1. ABOLITION OF PAR VALUE OF SHARES\n\nNew CO references: section 135 and 170; part 4, division 2 of Schedule 11\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nCompanies incorporated in Hong Kong under the Old CO and having a share capital were required to have a par value ascribed to their shares. Generally, par value was the minimum price at which shares could be issued.\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nThe New CO adopts a mandatory system of no-par for all Hong Kong companies with a share capital and abolishes the concept of par (or nominal) value of shares. Since the commencement of the New CO, a Hong Kong company’s shares have no nominal value. This applies to all shares, including shares issued before 3 March 2014. Concepts such as par value, share premium and the requirement for authorised capital have been abolished.\n\nThe New CO provides that the amount of authorised capital set out in an existing company’s constitutional documents is deemed to be deleted.\n\nSchedule 11 to the New CO sets out transitional arrangements and deeming provisions so that existing companies will not need to take steps to change their existing share capital and constitutional documents to reflect the no-par regime, and to ensure that contractual provisions that reference par value and related concepts will not be affected by the abolition of par.\n\nFor contracts, resolutions, trust deeds and other documents executed before the commencement date of the New CO, any express or implied reference to par or nominal value will be deemed to be a reference to nominal value immediately before the commencement date of the New CO.\n\nFrom the commencement date, any amount in the share premium account and any amount in the capital redemption reserve became part of the company’s share capital. The previous permitted uses of share premium are preserved for any such amounts in the share premium account immediately before the commencement date.\n\nThe liability of a shareholder for calls on partly paid shares issued before the commencement date (whether the amounts due are in respect of nominal value or premium) are not affected.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nThe migration to no-par should benefit companies by giving them greater flexibility in structuring their share capital. The nature of a share is the same whether or not it has a par value, in that a share still represents a fraction of ownership in a company. The concepts of paid up capital, issued capital and partly paid shares are also still relevant.\n\nAlteration of share capital\n\nSection 170 of the New CO sets out the various methods by which a company can alter its share capital (other than by redemption or repurchase of shares), including issuing new shares, capitalising profits, issuing bonus shares and effecting a share split or a share consolidation. A company must submit notice of any alteration of share capital to the Registrar of Companies in Hong Kong (the “Registrar”) within one month (s171). The notice must include a statement of capital setting out the number of shares in issue, the amount of the share capital and the amount of the increase in the company’s issued share capital (if any). If the company alters its share capital by allotting new shares, it is not required to file notice of alteration of capital under s171 but must file a return of allotment to the Registrar under section 142.\n\nIssuing new shares for consideration\n\nIf a company issues new shares for consideration, then the full proceeds will be credited to the share capital account.\n\nAs the concept of par value has been abolished, there is now no minimum price at which shares must be issued, or indeed any statutory control over the setting of the issue price of shares. However, directors still have an overriding fiduciary duty to set the price in good faith. It may also be necessary to obtain shareholders’ approval before issuing new shares, if the shares are not allotted under an offer made to all members of the company in proportion to their holdings (i.e. a rights issue).\n\nMaximum number of shares that may be issued\n\nAs the concept of authorised share capital has been abolished, there is no limit on the number of shares that the directors can issue. However, if shareholders so wish, they can amend the articles of association by way of special resolution to specify a maximum number of shares that may be issued. The maximum number of shares that a company may issue can be changed by way of ordinary resolution.\n\nIssuing bonus shares\n\nWhen a company issues bonus shares under the “no-par” regime, such shares will have no nominal value, meaning the company is no longer required to transfer an amount to share capital if it issues shares for no consideration, unless it elects to do so (for example, by capitalising profits). Therefore, a company may allot and issue bonus shares either with or without increasing its share capital. Shareholder approval would not be required for a bonus issue, provided the issue is to members of the company in proportion to their shareholdings.\n\nConsolidation and subdivision of shares\n\nCompanies continue to be able to consolidate and subdivide shares. Although there is no nominal amount to be divided for no-par shares, a similar result to subdivision can be achieved by increasing the number of shares. The process of consolidating shares into a smaller number can be effected by reducing the number of shares with no visible effect on the share capital.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nAmendments to constitutional documents and contracts\n\nNotwithstanding the transitional arrangements described above, companies may wish to review their particular situation to determine if they need to introduce specific changes to company documents (such as the articles of association, contracts and share certificates) to reflect the abolition of the par value regime. Also, while the transitional arrangements provide legal safeguards in respect of contracts that reference par value (and related concepts) under Hong Kong law, they may not necessarily be applied by courts outside Hong Kong, particularly if the governing law of the relevant contract is not Hong Kong law. Such contracts may need to be reviewed to determine whether clarifying amendments should be requested. An example would be a preferential dividend or liquidation preference payable to a holder of preferred shares up to the amount of the nominal value of each share. Such rights are often set out in a subscription or shareholders’ agreement, as well as the constitutional documents of the company.\n\n2.2. SHAREHOLDER CONSENT FOR GRANTS OF OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY LINKED SECURITIES\n\nNew CO references: sections 140 and 141\n\nRequirement for shareholder approval\n\nSections 140 and 141 of the New CO provide that directors may only allot new shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any securities into shares with prior approval of the company in general meeting.\n\nThis is more prohibitive than the Old CO which only required shareholders’ approval for allotments of new shares. The Old CO did not require shareholders’ approval for the grant of an option to subscribe for shares or a right to convert any securities into shares. Only the subsequent exercise of the option or the right of conversion that would result in an allotment required shareholders’ approval.\n\nShareholders’ approval is not however required for:\n\nallotments of shares or grants of rights under a pro rata offer to shareholders;\n\nallotments of shares, or grants of rights on a pro rata bonus issue of shares;\n\nallotments to a founder member of a company of shares that the member, by signing the company’s articles, has agreed to take; and\n\nan allotment of shares made in accordance with a grant of a right to subscribe for, or to convert any security into, shares.\n\nApproval may be given for a particular exercise of the power or for its exercise generally, and may be unconditional or subject to conditions. An approval may also be revoked or varied at any time by ordinary resolution of the company. An approval expires:\n\nif the company is required to hold an annual general meeting (AGM) on the earlier of:\n\nthe conclusion of the next AGM held after the approval is given; or\n\nthe expiry of the period within which the next AGM after the approval is given is required to be held;\n\nif the company is not required to hold an AGM because of section 612(1), on the date on which the requirements of that section are satisfied; or\n\nif the company is not required to hold an AGM for any other reason, on the date specified in the approval which must not be more than 12 months after the approval.\n\nConsequences of Contravention\n\nA director who knowingly contravenes, or authorises or permits a contravention of section 140 commits an offence and is liable to a fine of $50,000 and up to 6 months’ imprisonment. The contravention will not however affect the validity of an allotment or grant of rights.\n\nReturn of allotment (s.142)\n\nA limited company must file a return of allotment with the Registrar within one month after an allotment of shares setting out the information required under section 142(2).\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nIt will be useful for both companies and rights holders to deal upfront with shareholder approval for the granting of rights, rather than dealing with the issue subsequently when the rights are exercised, at a time when the shareholding structure may have changed and / or shareholder approval may not be forthcoming.\n\n2.3. UNIFORM SOLVENCY TEST FOR SHARE CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS\n\nNew CO references: sections 204 to 206\n\nThe New CO establishes a uniform solvency test for share buy-backs, financial assistance and reductions of capital. Under section 205 of the New CO, a company satisfies the solvency test in relation to a particular transaction if:\n\nimmediately after the transaction there will be no ground on which the company could be found to be unable to pay its debts; and\n\neither:\n\nif it is intended to commence the winding up of the company within 12 months after the date of the transaction, the company will be able to pay its debts in full within 12 months after the commencement of the winding up; or\n\nin any other case, the company will be able to pay its debts as they become due during the period of 12 months immediately following the date of the transaction.\n\nSection 206 further requires the directors of a company to make a “solvency statement” to the effect that the directors have formed the opinion that the company satisfies the solvency test in relation to a particular transaction. In forming his or her opinion, a director must inquire into the company’s state of affairs and prospects and take into account all liabilities (including contingent and prospective liabilities) of the company.\n\nA solvency statement must be in the specified form unless it relates to the giving of financial assistance. It must be made and signed by all directors for buy-backs and reductions of capital, and made and signed by the directors who vote in favour of giving the financial assistance.\n\nUnder the New CO, there is no longer any requirement to attach an auditors’ report to the solvency statement.\n\n2.4. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\n\nNew CO references: sections 274 to 289\n\nThe Prohibition (s.275)\n\nThe New CO, like the Old CO, prohibits a company and its subsidiaries from giving financial assistance directly or indirectly to any person for the purpose of acquiring shares in the company, subject to certain exceptions. The prohibition extends both to financial assistance given before or at the same time as the acquisition takes place, and to financial assistance given to reduce or discharge the liability incurred by any person to finance an acquisition which has already occurred.\n\nNon-Hong Kong holding companies\n\nSection 275(3) of the New CO clarifies that a company is not prohibited from giving financial assistance for the purpose of an acquisition of shares in its holding company, if the holding company is incorporated outside Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, there is no clarification that the giving of financial assistance by a non-Hong Kong subsidiary for the purpose of an acquisition of shares in its Hong Kong holding company is not prohibited. As the definition of “subsidiary” in the New CO is not limited to companies formed and registered under the New CO (referring instead to “body corporates”), the prudent view would be that non-Hong Kong subsidiaries are caught by the prohibition.\n\nDefinition of financial assistance (s.274(1))\n\nThe definition of “financial assistance” in the New CO is broadly unchanged. “Financial assistance” can be by way of:\n\ngift;\n\nguarantee, security or indemnity;\n\nrelease or waiver;\n\nloan or any other similar agreements;\n\nthe novation of, or the assignment of rights arising under, a loan or other similar agreements;\n\nany other financial assistance given by a company if:\n\nthe net assets of the company are reduced to a material extent by the giving of the assistance; or\n\nthe company has no net assets\n\nExceptions to the prohibition\n\nThe New Ordinance substantially retains the exceptions to the prohibition as in the Old Ordinance. These include:\n\nGeneral exceptions (s.277)\n\nThe New Ordinance does not prohibit any of the following transactions:\n\nDistribution of a company’s assets by way of dividend or in the course of winding up;\n\nAllotment of bonus shares;\n\nReduction of a company’s share capital;\n\nRedemption or buy-back of a company’s own shares;\n\nAnything done pursuant to a court order for reorganisation of a company’s share capital (Division 2 of Part 13 of the New Ordinance);\n\nAnything done under an arrangement under section 237 of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (power of liquidator to accept shares, etc. as consideration for sale of property of a company on winding up; and\n\nAnything done under an arrangement made between a company and its creditors that is binding on the creditors by virtue of section 254 of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance.\n\nPrincipal purpose exception (s.278)\n\nA company is not prohibited from giving financial assistance for the purpose of the acquisition of a share in the company or its holding company or for the purpose of reducing or discharging a liability incurred for such an acquisition if:\n\neither:\n\nthe principal purpose in giving the assistance is not the acquisition of a share in the company or its holding company or freducing or discharging a liability incurred for such an acquisition; or\n\nthe giving of the assistance is only an incidental part of some larger purpose of the company; and\n\nthe assistance is given in good faith in the interests of the company.\n\nException for money lending businesses (s.279)\n\nIf the lending of money is part of the ordinary business of the company, it is not prohibited from lending money in the ordinary course of such business.\n\nFor listed companies, the exception only applies if the company has net assets that are not reduced by the giving of the financial assistance or, to the extent that the assets are reduced, the assistance is provided by a payment out of distributable profits (s.282).\n\nException for employee share schemes (s.280)\n\nThe exception applies to the company giving financial assistance:\n\nin good faith in the interests of the company for the purposes of an employee share scheme. Employee share scheme is defined as a scheme for encouraging or facilitating the holding of shares in a company by or for the benefit of employees and former employees of the company or another company in the same group of companies or the spouses, widows, widowers and minor children of such employees: or\n\nfor the purposes of enabling or facilitating the acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares in the company or its holding company by employees and former employees of the company or another company in the same group of companies or the spouses, widows, widowers and minor children of such employees.\n\nThe New CO has relaxed the rules on giving financial assistance for the purposes of employee share schemes. While the Old CO only allowed financial assistance for the purchase or subscription of fully paid shares, section 280 of the New CO allows financial assistance for all types of employee share schemes if the assistance is given in good faith in the interests of the company for the purposes of an employee share scheme.\n\nFor listed companies, the exception only applies where the company has net assets that are not reduced by the giving of the financial assistance or, to the extent that the assets are reduced, the assistance is provided by a payment out of distributable profits.\n\nException for loans to employees (s.281)\n\nCompanies are not prohibited from making of loans to their “eligible employees” for the purpose of enabling them to acquire fully paid shares in the company or its holding company. Eligible employees do not include:\n\na director of the company;\n\na director’s spouse;\n\na director’s minor child;\n\na trustee of a trust (other than an employee share scheme):\n\nthe beneficiaries of which include a person referred to in (i) to (iii) above; or\n\nthe terms of which may be exercised for the benefit of a person referred to in (i) to (iii) above; or\n\na partner of a person referred to in (i) to (iii) above or of a trustee referred to in (iv) above.\n\nFor listed companies, the exception only applies where the company has net assets that are not reduced by the giving of the financial assistance or, to the extent that the assets are reduced, the assistance is provided by a payment out of distributable profits.\n\nNew authorisation procedures for financial assistance (s.283 to 285)\n\nThe main change in relation to financial assistance under the New CO is to allow all types of companies (listed or unlisted) to provide financial assistance for the acquisition of shares in the company or its holding company or to reduce or discharge a liability incurred for such acquisition, subject to satisfaction of the solvency test and one of three authorisation procedures. These replace the rather cumbersome whitewash exemption under the Old Ordinance.\n\nEach of the three authorisation procedures requires:\n\na prior board resolution to the effect that:\n\nthe company should give the assistance;\n\ngiving the assistance is in the company’s best interests; and\n\nthe terms and conditions of the assistance are fair and reasonable to the company.\n\nThe board resolution must set out in full the board’s conclusions on the above matters.\n\na solvency statement made on the same day as the board resolution and not more than 12 months before the giving of the assistance. For financial assistance, there is no specified form which must be used (s.206(4)). The solvency statement need only be signed by the directors who vote in favour of giving the financial assistance.\n\nThe new authorisation procedures allow:\n\nfinancial assistance which together with all other financial assistance previously given and not repaid, is less than 5% of the paid up share capital and reserves of the company (s.283);\n\nfinancial assistance approved by prior written resolution of all members of the company (s.284); and\n\nfinancial assistance approved by an ordinary resolution of shareholders. The following additional requirements apply:\n\nat least 14 days before the date of the proposed resolution, the company must send shareholders:\n\na copy of the solvency statement; and\n\na notice setting out:\n\nthe nature and terms of the assistance and the name of the person to whom it will be given;\n\nif it will be given to a nominee for another person, the name of the other person;\n\nthe text of the board resolution; and\n\nany further information necessary to explain the nature of the assistance and the implications of giving it for the company and the shareholders; and\n\nthe assistance must not be given less than 28 days after the date of the ordinary resolution.\n\nWhere financial assistance is approved by ordinary resolution, shareholders holding at least 5% of the total voting rights or, in the case of a company which is not limited by shares, members representing at least 5% of the total members of the company, may apply to the Court for an order restraining the giving of financial assistance (s.286). The application for a restraining order must be made within 28 days of the shareholders’ resolution approving the financial assistance and may only be made on the ground that:\n\nthe giving of the assistance is neither in the best interests of the company nor of benefit to those shareholders of the company not receiving the assistance; or\n\nthe terms and conditions under which the assistance is to be given are not fair and reasonable to the company and those members not receiving the assistance.\n\nA shareholder who voted in favour of the financial assistance cannot apply for a restraining order.\n\nConsequence of breach of the prohibition on financial assistance\n\nWhere financial assistance is given in contravention of the New Ordinance, the financial assistance and contracts connected to that financial assistance remain valid (s276).\n\nContravention of the prohibition on financial assistance is an offence for which the company and every responsible person of the company are each liable to a fine of HK$150,000 and to imprisonment for a maximum period of 12 months.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nThe New CO facilitates transactions involving financial assistance by abolishing the previous complicated whitewash exemption procedure and replacing it with a choice of three approval mechanisms that can be used by both listed and non-listed companies.\n\nDirectors do not need to obtain an auditors’ report or rely on audited accounts when making a solvency statement to support financial assistance in a particular case. However, directors are still expected to have reasonable grounds in forming their opinion as to the company’s solvency. Directors must therefore make due enquiries as to the company’s state of affairs and prospects before signing the solvency statement. In some cases, directors may decide that professional assistance (for example, from auditors or financial advisers) is needed.\n\nHowever, the additional expenses and delays in engaging third party advisers may not be appropriate in all cases. Third party advisers may not be in a better position than the directors in ascertaining the company’s solvency, which involves forward-looking business judgments. In the resolutions approving the financial assistance, the board should clearly set out its bases for forming the opinion that the company satisfies the solvency test in relation to the particular transaction.\n\n2.5. ALTERNATIVE COURT-FREE PROCEDURE FOR REDUCTION OF CAPITAL BASED ON SOLVENCY TEST\n\nNew CO references: sections 215 to 225\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nThe Old CO only allowed a reduction of share capital if approved by way of shareholders’ special resolution and a court approved the reduction (although court approval was not required if the sole purpose of the reduction was to re-designate the nominal value of shares to a lower amount).\n\nCourt-free procedure for capital reductions under the New CO\n\nWhile retaining a court-sanctioned procedure for capital reductions, the New CO introduces an alternative court-free procedure based on a solvency test.\n\nThe requirements under the court free procedure are as follows:\n\nSolvency statement\n\nAll the directors need to sign the solvency statement in support of the proposed reduction;\n\nShareholders’ special resolution\n\nThe company needs to obtain shareholders’ approval by way of special resolution (75%) within 15 days after the date of the solvency statement.\n\nIf the resolution is to be passed as a written special resolution, any shareholder holding shares to which the resolution relates is not eligible to sign the special resolution. If the special resolution is proposed at a meeting, the resolution will not be effective if a shareholder holding shares to which the resolution relates exercises the voting rights carried by those shares and the resolution would not otherwise have been passed.\n\nPublic notice of reduction of share capital (s.218)\n\nIf a special resolution for reduction of share capital is passed, the company must:\n\npublish a notice in the Gazette:\n\nstating that the company has approved a reduction of share capital;\n\nspecifying the amount of share capital to be reduced and the date of the special resolution;\n\nstating where the special resolution and solvency statement are available for inspection; and\n\nstating that a shareholder who did not vote in favour of the special resolution or a creditor of the company may apply to the Court under section 220 within 5 weeks after the date of the special resolution for its cancellation.\n\nThe notice must be published no later than the last working day of the week following the passing of the special resolution (or, if that is less than 4 clear business days after the date of the special resolution, no later than the last working day of the week after that);\n\nbefore the end of the week following the passing of the special resolution, the company must:\n\npublish a notice to the same effect as the notice under paragraph (i) above in at least one specified English newspaper and one specified Chinese newspaper; or\n\ngive written notice to that effect to each of the company’s creditors;\n\nRegistration and inspection of solvency statement\n\nThis note is provided for information purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Specific advice should be sought in relation to any particular situation. This note has been prepared based on the laws and regulations in force at the date of this note which may be subsequently amended, modified, re-enacted, restated or replaced.\n\nThe company must deliver a copy of the solvency statement to the Registrar no later than the day on which the company publishes notice in the Gazette, or if earlier, the day on which it publishes notice in specified newspapers or gives notice to the company’s creditors.\n\nIt must also ensure that the special resolution and the solvency statement are available for inspection by any shareholder or creditor at its registered office or any place prescribed by regulations made under section 657:\n\nfrom the date of publication of notice in the Gazette or, if earlier, the date of publication of notice in specified newspapers or the date on which written notice was given to the company’s creditors\n\nuntil 5 weeks after the date of the special resolution.\n\nPower of Court to confirm or cancel special resolution\n\nAny creditor or non-approving shareholder may, within five weeks after the special resolution is passed, apply to the court for cancellation of the resolution under section 220. If an application is made, the applicant must serve the application on the company and give notice of the application to the Registrar within 7 days of serving the application on the company.\n\nThe Court must make an order either confirming or cancelling the special resolution. The Court order may also:\n\nprovide for the company to buy back the shares of any of its members and for the reduction accordingly of the company’s share capital;\n\nprovide for the protection of the interests of shareholders or creditors of the company;\n\nmake any alteration to the company’s articles that may be required as a consequence;\n\nrequire the company not to alter its articles.\n\nThe company must deliver a copy of the Court order to the Registrar within 15 days.\n\nRegistration of return of reduction of share capital\n\nIf no application to Court is made for cancellation of the special resolution, the company must deliver a return setting out particulars of the reduction of share capital and the share capital of the company to the Registrar no earlier than 5 weeks and no later than 7 weeks after the date of the special resolution.\n\nIf application to Court is made and the Court confirms the special resolution or the proceedings terminate without determination by the Court, the company must deliver the return to the Registrar within 15 days after the making of the Court order or after termination of the proceedings.\n\nThe special resolution and the reduction of share capital take effect when the return is registered by the Registrar.\n\nTreatment of reserves\n\nIt was unclear under the Old CO whether reserves created arising from a reduction of share capital could be regarded as distributable reserves. Section 214 of the New CO clarifies that reserves arising from a reduction of share capital may be regarded as realised profits.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nThe directors are expected to have reasonable grounds in forming their opinion as to the company’s solvency. Directors must therefore make due enquiries as to the company’s state of affairs and prospects before signing the solvency statement. In some cases, directors may decide that professional assistance (for example, from auditors or financial advisers) is needed.\n\n2.6. ALLOWING ALL COMPANIES TO BUY BACK SHARES OUT OF CAPITAL, SUBJECT TO SOLVENCY TEST\n\nNew CO references: sections 257 to 266\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nUnder the Old CO, a company could generally only buy back its shares using distributable profits or using the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares. There was an exception for private companies, which could fund a buy-back by payment out of capital based on a solvency test.\n\nUnder the New CO, all Hong Kong companies are allowed to fund buy-backs out of capital, subject to a solvency requirement. Listed Hong Kong companies are however prohibited from funding an on-market share buy back out of capital (s. 257(3)).\n\nSections 258 to 266 retain most of the Old CO requirements and procedures applicable to buy-backs by a private company out of capital, and extend them to all companies.\n\nThe requirements and procedures are similar to the new court-free procedure for reduction of capital as set out above and include the following key features:\n\nSolvency statement\n\nAll the directors need to sign a solvency statement in support of the proposed payment out of capital (s.259).\n\nSpecial resolution of shareholders\n\nThe company needs to obtain shareholders’ approval by a special resolution passed within 15 days after the date of the solvency statement.\n\nIf the resolution is to be passed as a written special resolution, any shareholder holding shares to which the resolution relates is not eligible to sign the special resolution. If the special resolution is proposed at a meeting, the resolution will not be effective if a shareholder holding shares to which the resolution relates exercises the voting rights carried by those shares and the resolution would not otherwise have been passed.\n\nPublication of notices\n\nThe company must publish notices in the Gazette and in a specified English and Chinese newspaper and must register the solvency statement with the Registrar.\n\nApplication to Court to cancel special resolution\n\nAny creditor or non-approving shareholder may, within five weeks after the special resolution is passed, apply to the court for cancellation of the resolution.\n\nTime Limit\n\nThe payment out of capital and the buy-back must be made no earlier than five weeks and no later than seven weeks after the special resolution is passed (subject to any court application by a creditor or dissenting shareholder).\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nThe New CO removes the requirement for an auditors’ report to be prepared when funding a buy-back out of capital. However, the directors are still expected to have reasonable grounds in forming their opinion as to the company’s solvency. Directors must therefore make due enquiries as to the company’s state of affairs and prospects before signing the solvency statement. In some cases, directors may decide that professional assistance (for example, from auditors or financial advisers) is needed.\n\n2.7. REFUSAL TO REGISTER TRANSFERS OF SHARES OR DEBENTURES\n\nNew CO references: Section 151(3) and (4)\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nThe Old CO required a company which refused to register transfer of shares or debentures to send a notice of such refusal to the transferor and transferee within two months after the transfer was lodged with the company. However, there was no requirement for the notice to be accompanied by the reasons for the refusal.\n\nPosition and key provisions in the New CO\n\nSections 151(3) and (4) of the New CO require companies to give reasons explaining their refusal to register a transfer of shares upon request and within 28 days after receiving the request.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nSection 152 of the New CO retains the provisions of the Old CO that allow a transferee, where a company refuses to register a transfer of shares, to apply to the court to have the transfer registered by the company. A court may, if it is satisfied that the application is well founded, disallow the refusal and order that the transfer be registered forthwith by the company. Generally, however, courts have been reluctant to intervene in the exercise of directors’ discretion without clear evidence of bad faith or an improper motive. The requirement to provide reasons for refusing to register a share transfer under the New CO will enhance transparency and help to ensure that directors only exercise their powers for proper purposes.\n\nOne area where a refusal to register a transfer of shares may be a significant issue is in the case of an equitable charge over shares, where the charged shares are not registered in the name of the security holder. Following enforcement, the board may refuse to register the transfer of shares into the name of the security holder or a third party purchaser. In such case, the requirement to explain the refusal under the New CO may assist the security holder (if it can be shown the refusal is motivated by bad faith). As an extra precaution, the security holder may insist at the outset that the articles of association are amended so as to remove the directors’ discretion to refuse to register a transfer of shares following enforcement of the charge.\n\nPart 3 – Company administration, procedure and operations\n\n3.1. ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (AGM)\n\nNew CO references: sections 430(3), 609 to 614\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nThe Old CO requires every company to hold an AGM in each year, with not more than 15 months between the date of one AGM and the next. There are no rules on shorter accounting periods. In addition, there is no provision to regulate the first accounting period, except that the first AGM has to be held within 18 months of incorporation.\n\nUnder the Old CO, every company is required to hold AGMs, although a company can dispense with holding AGMs if everything that is required or intended to be done at the meeting is done by written resolutions, and a copy of each of the documents (including any accounts or records) which would be required to be laid before the meeting is provided to each member of the company.\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nTime for holding AGM\n\nUnless exempted, companies are required to hold an AGM within six months (for public companies) or nine months (for private companies or companies limited by guarantee) after the end of their accounting reference period.\n\nResolution to dispense with requirement to hold AGM\n\nSection 613 of the New CO allows a company to dispense with the requirement for holding of AGMs by passing a written resolution or a resolution at a general meeting by all members. After passing the resolution, the company will not be required to hold any AGMs for the financial year or for subsequent financial years to which the resolution relates. The financial statements and reports originally required to be laid before an AGM still need to be sent to the members (section 430(3)).\n\nUnder section 613(5) of the New CO, any member may request the company to convene an AGM for a particular year. Such notice must be given no later than three months prior to the last day that the company would otherwise be required to hold an AGM for the relevant financial year.\n\nThe company may also revoke the resolution dispensing with AGMs by passing an ordinary resolution to that effect.\n\nSingle member companies\n\nSingle member companies are not required to hold AGMs (section 612(2)(a) of the New CO). However, a single member company is still required to send financial statements and reports to its member under section 430(3).\n\nWritten resolution procedure\n\nThe written resolution procedure under the Old CO is retained in section 612(1) of the New CO for any company (including a public company or a company limited by guarantee) wishing to dispense with an AGM on a specific occasion by a written resolution.\n\nDormant companies\n\nAs was the case under the Old CO, dormant companies are exempt from the requirement to hold AGMs. Dormant companies are also exempt from the requirements to prepare financial statements and reports.\n\n3.2. ANNUAL RETURN\n\nNew CO references: section 662, schedule 6\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nThe Old CO provides that, except where the company is a private company having a share capital, the annual return is required to be filed within 42 days after the AGM for the year. The Old CO further provides that, except where the company is a private company, the annual return shall include certified copies of the company’s balance sheet and reports laid before the company in general meeting to which the return relates.\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nPublic companies and guarantee companies\n\nThe annual return must to be filed within 42 days after the company’s return date. The return date is six months after the end of the company’s accounting reference period for public companies, or nine months after such period for companies limited by guarantee.\n\nPrivate companies\n\nPrivate companies are still required to file their annual returns within 42 days after the anniversary of their incorporation.\n\nInformation to be included in, and documents to accompany, annual return\n\nSchedule 6 of the New CO sets out the information to be included in an annual return and the documents required to accompany it. The requirement for listed companies to file the details of all members in their annual returns has been relaxed. Section 2 of schedule 6 requires listed companies to include particulars only of members who held 5% or more of the issued shares in any class of the company’s shares as at the date of the annual return.\n\n3.3. WRITTEN RESOLUTIONS\n\nNew CO references: sections 547 to 561\n\nLike the Old CO, the New CO provides that anything which may be done by a company by resolution in a general meeting may be done, without a meeting and without any previous notice, by a resolution signed by all shareholders of a company.\n\nThe New CO establishes procedures for proposing, passing and recording written resolutions of Hong Kong companies.\n\nSection 549 provides that the directors or a shareholder of a company may propose a resolution as a written resolution. A shareholder of the company who proposes the resolution may request the company to circulate with the resolution a statement of not more than 1,000 words on the subject matter of the resolution (section 551).\n\nThe company must circulate a written resolution to every shareholder within 21 days after it receives the proposal if:\n\nthe resolution is proposed by a director of the company; or\n\nif it has been requested to do so by shareholders representing not less than 5% of the total voting rights (or a lower percentage if specified in the company’s articles) (section 552).\n\nThe company must send shareholders together with the proposed resolution guidance as to:\n\nhow to signify agreement to the resolution; and\n\nthe date by which the resolution must be passed if it is not to lapse.\n\nCirculation may be effected by sending copies of the resolution in hard copy form or electronic form or by making the copies available on a website (section 553).\n\nThe company must also send the proposed resolution and any statement which a shareholder has requested to be circulated with the resolution to the company’s auditor on or before the date of circulation of the resolution to shareholders (section 555). Copies may be sent to auditors either in hard copy or electronic form (section 555(2)).\n\nA company or any other person who claims to be aggrieved by a statement which a shareholder has requested by circulated with a proposed written resolution may apply to Court for an order that the company is not required to circulate the statement (section 554). The court will make such an order if it is satisfied that the rights given by section 551(2) are:\n\nbeing abused; or\n\nbeing used to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter.\n\nThe court may also order the shareholders requesting the circulation to pay all or part of the company’s costs.\n\nThe period for agreeing to the proposed written resolution is 28 days or such other period as specified in the company’s articles (section 558). The proposed written resolution will lapse if not passed within 28 days after the circulation date (or such other period as provided for in the articles). Members may signify their agreement to a proposed written resolution and send it back to the company either in hard copy form or electronic form (section 556). A written resolution requires agreement in writing by all eligible shareholders of a company (section 556(1)). If a resolution is passed as a written resolution, the company must send a notice of that fact to every shareholder and the auditor of the company within 15 days (section 559).\n\nNon-compliance with the requirements on circulation of proposed written resolution or notification of the passing of a written resolution is an offence for which the company and every responsible person of the company may be liable to a fine of $10,000.\n\nThe new procedures do not replace the common law doctrine of unanimous consent to the effect that, if all the members of a company actually agree on a particular decision which can be made at a general meeting, the decision is binding and effective without a meeting (section 547(3)). A company’s articles may also set out alternative procedures for passing a resolution without a meeting, provided that the resolution has been agreed by the members unanimously (section 561).\n\n3.4. GENERAL MEETINGS\n\nIn the New CO, all meetings of shareholders are referred to as “general meetings” instead of “extraordinary general meetings”. The exception is AGMs.\n\nUnder the New CO, the notice period for an AGM is at least 21 days. In any other case the notice period is at least 14 days for a limited company, irrespective of whether an ordinary or special resolution will be considered at the meeting, and at least 7 days for an unlimited company (section 571(1)).\n\nIf the Articles require a longer period of notice, the meeting must be called by notice of that longer period (section 571(2)). For resolutions requiring special notice, such as the removal of a director or auditor, notice of the intention to move the resolution must be given to the company at least 28 days before the meeting, as previously section 578). A company may wish to amend its Articles to reduce its notice periods to the new statutory minimum.\n\n3.5. MEETINGS PERMITTED TO BE HELD AT MORE THAN ONE LOCATION\n\nNew CO reference: section 584\n\nSection 584 of the New CO permits a company to hold a general meeting at two or more places using any technology that enables the shareholders of the company who are not together at the same place to listen, speak and vote at the meeting. A company may set out rules and procedures for holding a dispersed meeting in its articles.\n\n3.6. EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS\n\nNew CO references: sections 124 to 125 and 127 to 129\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nThe Old CO required every Hong Kong company to have a common seal. A company had to be authorised by its articles of association to have an official seal for use outside Hong Kong, and have objects which required the transaction of business outside Hong Kong. In addition, under the Old CO, an attorney could only bind a company in respect of deeds executed by him on its behalf outside Hong Kong.\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nCommon seal optional\n\nSection 124 of the New CO makes the keeping and use of a common seal optional. Where a company has a common seal it must be a metallic seal with the company’s name engraved on it.\n\nOverseas seal\n\nSection 125 allows a company with a common seal to have an official seal for use outside Hong Kong, removing the restrictions under the Old CO.\n\nExecution of documents by company\n\nSection 127 provides that a company may execute a document:\n\nunder its common seal in accordance with its articles (section 127(1) and (2));\n\nin the case of a company with only one director, by having the document signed by the director (section 127(3)(a)); or\n\nin the case of a company having two or more directors, by having the document signed by any two directors or by any director and the company secretary (section 127(3)(b)).\n\nIn favour of a good faith purchaser for value, a document is to be regarded as having been executed by a company if the document purports to have been signed in accordance with section 127(3)(a) or (b).\n\nSection 127(5) provides that a document signed in accordance with section 127(3)(a) or (b) and expressed to be executed by the company has effect as if the document had been executed under the company’s common seal.\n\nExecution of deeds by company\n\nSection 128 of the New CO provides that a company may execute a deed by:\n\nexecuting it in accordance with section 127;\n\nhaving it expressed to be executed by the company as a deed; and\n\ndelivering it as a deed.\n\nExecution of documents by attorney\n\nSection 129 of the New CO allows a company to authorise any person as its attorney to execute a deed or any other document on its behalf in Hong Kong or elsewhere. The authorisation must be given by an instrument executed as a deed.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nAlthough a company may continue to employ other methods to execute documents (e.g. passing a board resolution to appoint authorised signatories), the deeming provisions in favour of good faith purchasers for value will only apply to documents executed in accordance with section 127 of the New CO.\n\nIn order to take full advantage of the new flexibility in executing documents (including deeds), a company should review its articles of association and remove any “legacy” limitations regarding use of the seal or execution.\n\nThe New CO is silent on the valid mode(s) of execution of a Hong Kong law deed by a foreign company. Foreign companies should therefore continue to execute deeds in the same way as under existing practice.\n\n3.7. STAUTORY PROTECTION FOR PERSONS DEALING WITH COMPANIES\n\nNew CO references: sections 117 to 118, 120\n\nSections 117 and 118 of the New CO provide statutory protection for persons dealing with a company in addition to the common law “indoor management rule”. The “indoor management rule” provides that a third party dealing in good faith with a company is not bound to inquire whether acts of internal management have been regular and is entitled to presume that acts within the company’s constitution and powers have been properly and duly performed.\n\nSection 117 provides that in favour of a person dealing with a company in good faith, the power of the directors to bind the company will be deemed to be free of any limitation under the articles of association, any resolutions of the company or any agreement between the members of the company. Good faith will be presumed (unless the contrary is proved). A person will not be regarded as acting in bad faith by reason only of the person’s knowing that an act is beyond the directors’ powers. In addition, third parties are not required to inquire as to any limitations on the directors’ power, and will not be regarded as having constructive notice of any matters publicly disclosed in the articles or any return or resolution kept by the Companies Registrar.\n\nSection 118 provides that the protection afforded to a person by section 117 will not apply where the party to a transaction with a company is an “insider” (for example, a director of the company or of a holding company of the company; or an entity connected with such a director).\n\nPart 4 – Registration of charges\n\n4.1. REGISTRABLE CHARGES\n\nNew CO references: section 334\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nIt was not clear whether the following categories of charges were registrable under the Old CO:\n\nmortgages over aircrafts (as bills of sale);\n\ninstalments due, but not paid, on the issue price of shares;\n\nliens on subfreights (either as a charge on book debts or a floating charge);\n\na charge over cash deposits (as a charge over book debts).\n\nIn addition, the Old CO required registration of charges for the purpose of securing any issue of debentures, which overlapped with other categories of registrable charges. Typically, issues of debentures are supported by a floating charge, or a fixed charge that is registrable under other categories of registrable charges.\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nTo remove uncertainty and dispense with redundant items, the following changes have been made under the New CO:\n\na charge on an aircraft or any share in an aircraft is expressly made registrable;\n\na charge on instalments due, but not paid, on the issue price of shares is also expressly made registrable;\n\ncharges for the purpose of securing any issue of debentures are no longer registrable;\n\nit has been clarified that a shipowner’s lien on subfreights shall not be regarded as a charge on book debts or as a floating charge and is therefore not registrable;\n\nit is stipulated that if a company maintains a deposit of money with another person, a charge on the company’s right to repayment is not a charge on book debts of the company.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nThe exclusion of a charge on a company’s right to repayment (where that company maintains a deposit of money with another person), will exclude any bank account charge from the requirement to register, whether or not such charge is given to secure the obligations of the account holder itself or the obligations of a third party. This means that lenders looking to take security over bank accounts will no longer be able to rely on a company search to determine whether there are any existing charges affecting the relevant bank account.\n\n4.2. ACCELERATION OF REPAYMENT OBLIGATION\n\nNew CO references: section 337(6)\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nUnder the Old CO, where a charge became void for not being registered with the Registrar of Companies (“Registrar”) within the specified time limit, the money secured by such charge automatically became immediately payable.\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nSection 337(6) of the New CO replaces the “automatic” acceleration provision with a “discretionary” acceleration provision, giving a choice to the lender as to whether the secured amount is to become immediately payable.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nHong Kong security documents often include a post-signing undertaking on the part of the grantor to register the security, although often the grantee will carry out the registration itself (or through its lawyers). In any event, under the terms of the security document, breach of an undertaking to register will typically constitute an event of default triggering immediate repayment of the secured liabilities (as well as enforcement of the relevant security).\n\n4.3. CERTIFIED COPY OF CHARGE TO BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION\n\nNew CO references: sections 333, 335, 336 and 338 to 340\n\nPosition under the Old CO\n\nThe Old CO required an original of a charge instrument (if any) together with the prescribed particulars of the charge in a specified form to be delivered to the Registrar for registration. Previously only the prescribed particulars were made available for public inspection. The charge instrument itself was not available for public search (and was returned by the Registrar).\n\nKey changes under the New CO\n\nThe New CO provides that both a certified copy of the charge instrument (if any) and the prescribed particulars of the charge are registrable and available for public inspection.\n\nPractical considerations and recommended steps\n\nAs the contents of the charge will be publicly available, parties should consider if and how commercially sensitive information (for example, details of bank accounts) may be excluded from the charge instrument.\n\nThe availability for public inspection of a copy of the charge instrument will give rise to constructive notice of all the "
