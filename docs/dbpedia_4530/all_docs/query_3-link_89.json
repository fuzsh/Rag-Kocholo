        "text": "First of three documentaries exposing the influence of the Gladio, a terrorist network operating throughout Europe.\n\nFor the past 40 years, teams of secret agents have bombed and murdered scores of innocent civilians to keep control of Europe for their political masters. Developed from \"stay behinds\" - Nazis who remained in occupied territories at the end of the Second World War to resist the communist threat - this secret network changed from being defenders of state security into attackers of the established political order.\n\nBut it is only since the Gladio's existence was finally acknowledged in 1990 that the impact of its shadowy role in post-war Europe has emerged. This documentary reveals the crucial role the CIA has played in manipulating the political affairs of post-war Europe through the Gladio."
