I am really into old live recordings. I wish we could figure out how to make music play as soon as the thread is opened.\n\nHere's a studio recording of Ella and Louis Armstrong doing 'Summertime.' So sweet, reminds me of a branch swaying in the breeze\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yKgAEkCKxY&mode=related&search=\n\nBill Russ Walling\n\nSocial climber\n\nOut on the sand.... man.....\n\nMar 29, 2007 - 12:03pm PT\n\none word: They Can't Take That Away From Me\n\ntwo words: My Funny Valentine\n\nthree words: Anything Goes\n\nElla edit:\n\nlook into the Cole Porter Songbook or the Rogers and Hart Songbook for a sampling of some greats.\n\nSatch edit: anyone heard the Satchmo and Ella recordings? They are fantastic. scuffy b\n\nclimber\n\nThe town that Nature forgot to hate\n\nMar 29, 2007 - 12:21pm PT\n\nFirst time I paid (my own) money to see a performance, June '67,\n\nit included Ella Fitzgerald, with a pretty good backup band,\n\nled by a guy called Duke Ellington. Gal could sing, eh?\n\nWord on My Funny Valentine, though.\n\nSarah Vaughn put on some absolute tour de force renditions with\n\npiano accompaniment. Owned the damn thing. Brought tears to my\n\neyes.

LA\n\nDo you really want to add 'racist numbskull' to your already-lengthy ST idiocy resume? Why don't you delete that dumb comment, and then I'll delete this?\n\nDeal? Donny... the OHHH!- Riginal\n\nSport climber\n\nBoald'r Effin See Oh\n\nMar 30, 2007 - 11:59am PT\n\nSo how many of you are REAL fans of Ella Fitzgerald?...I mean serious ones?"
