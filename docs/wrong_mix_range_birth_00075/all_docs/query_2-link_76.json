        "text": "The most complex musical instrument ever created under God's heaven is the human voice, and I have never heard anyone play that instrument more beautifully than Ella. My life has been enriched by the knowledge of this magnificent songstress.\n\nMy twin brother [of blessed memory, Donald L. Tavel (1952-1988), Associate Professor of Music, Indiana University Graduate School of Music, the School of Electronics and Computer Music (which was founded upon his entry into graduate school)] designed a synthesizer in the middle 1970's. He used to explain the computer's tracking abilities by way of reference to \"A Foggy Day\" as sung by Ella because there was no finer example to graphically display the \"reading\" of this input and show that the words were not \"understood\" but that the scat was, just as when the input was a piano or violin.\n\nIn addition to having listened to her recordings for over thirty years, I was graced with the opportunity to see her in concert with the late great Count Basie in Lansing, Michigan in 1976. There was a Republican fund raiser going on (at which Liz Taylor choked on the chicken bone, remember?) and the \"music hall\" that was booked for this performance was a gymnasium. Lord have mercy, but the limitations of the spatial environment were completely transcended by Ella and the Count's perfect projections.\n\nI will always treasure my memories of Ella, and though it is presumptuous to suggest that there is a best set of recordings, my favorites are the 1957 Norman Granz production of \"Porgy and Bess\" with Louis Armstrong (artwork from which can be seen at my homepage that provides a link to this memorial site) and the 1941 \"Birthday (her 40th) Concert\" in Rome.\n\nSweet Sleep Ella, with love...\n\nAs a very little girl in the late 1930s, I remember Ella in a movie - perhaps an Abbott & Costello film. I recall her strolling up and down an aisle on a bus singing in her unique and wonderful style - A TISKET A TASKET. Everybody back then hummed and/or sung these lyrics:\n\n\"A tisket - a tasket, a green and yellow basket,\n\nI wrote a letter to my love and on the way I lost it.\n\nI lost it, I lost it, the green and yellow basket -\n\na little fellow picked it up and put it in his pocket.\n\nWas it red? No, no, no, no.\n\nWas it blue? No, no, no, no.\n\nJust a little yellow basket.\"\n\nThe words are close enough. Perhaps \"golden oldies\" like myself will recall this cherished and nostalgic bit of Ella Fitzgerald's marvelous career."
