        "text": "Ella Fitzgerald is an icon. Named \"The First Lady of Song\" (and rightfully so), Ella is not only an important figure in music, but in history. Over the course of her career, she has accomplished so much, and helped set the stage for many of today's superstars.\n\nFrom working with jazz legends like Duke Ellington and Nat King Cole, to performing at the most prestigious concert venues around the world, and overcoming discrimination, Ella left behind such an exceptional and important legacy.\n\nIn 2017, the world celebrated what would have been Ella's centennial birthday. Ella would have been just over 100 years old today, but we continue to celebrate her impact on music and beyond for the next 100 years to come and so on, especially during this month, Black Music Month. So, here are 10 important facts that you need to know about \"The First Lady of Song\":\n\n1. She was the first African-American woman to win multiple Grammy Awards.\n\nElla was the first African-American woman to win multiple Grammy Awards -- and it happened at the very first Grammy Awards ceremony in 1958. Ella took home two awards for Best Vocal Performance and Female and Best Jazz Performance, Individual. In total, over the course of her career, Ella has won 14 Grammys, and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1967.\n\n2. She became one of the first stars to perform during the Super Bowl Half Time Show.\n\nAs we are heading into the 2019 Super Bowl, and you think about the star power behind each halftime performance over the last 20+ years, it wasn't always like that. It wasn't until Michael Jackson's 1993 performance that halftime became the star-studded affair it is today. BUT, in 1972, Ella Fitzgerald, along with Carol Channing, performed during Super Bowl VI where the Miami Dolphins faced off against the Dallas Cowboys in New Orleans. They performed a tribute to Louis Armstrong (who had passed away the year before). This also made Fitzgerald the first African-American woman to perform during Super Bowl Halftime.\n\n7. Marilyn Monroe helped her to get booked at popular '50s nightclub Mocambo.\n\nMarilyn Monroe personally called the owner of Mocambo and demanded Ella be booked right away. Ella has said, \"I owe Marilyn Monroe a real debt. It was because of her that I played the Mocambo, a very popular nightclub in the '50s. She personally called the owner of the Mocambo, and told him she wanted me booked immediately, and if he would do it, she would take a front table every night. She told him - and it was true, due to Marilyn's superstar status - that the press would go wild. The owner said yes, and Marilyn was there, front table, every night. The press went overboard. After that, I never had to play a small jazz club again. She was an unusual woman - a little ahead of her times. And she didn't know it.\""
