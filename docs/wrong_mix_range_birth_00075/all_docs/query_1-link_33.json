        "text": "Sam Cross — 7/2018\n\nSam Cross, James Madison University professor emeritus and longtime ISB member, died on July 4, 2018. He was 78 years old. Sam was born in\n\nHouston, Texas on August 10, 1939. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, earning a bachelor of applied music degree and master's degree in music literature. He continued his graduate studies at Indiana University. His primary teachers were Mary Bresler, Murray Grodner, Gary Karr and Eugene Levinson. Sam was previously principal double bass with the Austin Symphony, and was active as a soloist and orchestral bassist in Virginia and the Washington DC area. He joined the faculty of the JMU School of Music in 1969, where he taught a range of classes and became a sought-after teacher, publishing a number of articles on bass pedagogy. Sam retired in 2013 as one of JMU's longest tenured professors. He is survived by his niece, Eva Kloostra.\n\nMurray Doc Solomon — 4/2018\n\nMurray \"Doc\" Solomon died on April 5, 2018 from complications of Parkinson's disease. He was 91 years old. Doc was a \"musician's musician,\" with a career spanning over six decades. He played bass in studio orchestras for early films, radio and television, as well as major symphonies. He subsequently performed for 26 years in pit orchestras for some of the most famous Broadway musicals of all time. He toured the Far East on a Presidential Cultural Exchange Concert Tour in the late 1950s, and was a music educator for 28 years. But Doc will perhaps be best remembered by the international double bass community as a pioneering composer of music for our instrument. His solo and ensemble works, both arrangements and original compositions, have been performed around the world. Doc's publications for younger bassists and the classroom remain evergreen at bass camps and festivals. ISB member Jan Jacobs remembers his friend and mentor: \"I first met Doc at an international bass convention. I already knew his name, having conducted his John Denver Meets the String Orchestra series at the Patchogue-Medford High School. He coached me for free, and even flew with me and my bass to a performance in Michigan. I am so glad to have known such a friendly and talented man!\" Doc is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Gary and Mary Solomon, daughter and son in-law Allison and Mike Glassburn, and grandchildren Michael, Erica and Diana Solomon, and Joshua Glassburn.\n\nBuell Neidlinger — 3/2018\n\nBuell Neidlinger, whose long and remarkable career as a bassist, cellist and educator encompassed virtually every musical genre and pursuit, died at home of a heart attack on March 16t, 2018. He was 82 years old. A musical prodigy, he took up the cello at age 7 and the bass at age 13, studying with Walter Page. Buell attended Yale University, but left after a year to pursue a career in jazz. Perhaps best known for his collaboration with pianist Cecil Taylor, he also recorded with saxophonists Steve Lacy, Archie Shepp and Marty Krystall, and trombonist Roswell Rudd. You can hear Buell on Tony Bennett's 1962 hit \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco,\" just one example of his work as principal bass in the Warner Brothers studio orchestra for nearly 30 years. He also explored contemporary classical music with John Cage and Gunther Schuller, receiving a Rockefeller performance grant in 1965. He left New York City for Boston in 1967, where he joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Erich Leinsdorf and became a founding instructor in the jazz department that Gunther Schuller founded at the New England Conservatory. Four years later he was offered a position at California Institute of the Arts and relocated to Los Angeles. There, Buell became principal bass of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and was a busy session musician. He retired from studio and performance work in 2000 and moved\n\nwith his wife of 36 years, Margaret Storer, to Whidbey Island near Seattle. Buell is also survived by his daughter Miranda Neidlinger and son Mike Neidlinger.\n\nLawrence Angell — 12/2017\n\nLawrence Angell died peacefully on December 3, 2017 following a lengthy illness.

He served on the jury of the ASTA National Competition, and presented masterclasses at ISB conventions and for orchestras and conservatories around the world. He was a busy soloist and chamber musician, and performed in various groups with his wife, the pianist Anita Pontremoli. He was a proponent of new music, including Musings On the Black Moon by Marcel Dick, and Bass Piece, a work composed for him by Donald Erb. Throughout his career he participated in nearly 500 recordings. A lover of the early recordings of Frank Sinatra, he was often found playing jazz at Pier W on Cleveland's west coast and elsewhere. He was also a licensed single engine aircraft pilot and flight instructor, an avid tennis player, a motorcycle and racecar enthusiast and sky diver. Following his retirement, he wrote Tales from the Locker Room: An Anecdotal Portrait of George Szell and His Cleveland Orchestra.

His father Morris Bailey, Jr. was a musician and composer, and his uncle, Donald \"Duck\" Bailey, was a jazz drummer who appeared on a number of Blue Note recordings. As a child Victor also played the drums, but switched to bass guitar after the bassist in his neighborhood band walked out of practice. He and the bass clicked, and Victor entered the Berklee College of Music, where he eventually joined the faculty, at age 18. Victor will best be remembered as the bassist for Weather Report from 1982 to 1986. As Christian McBride recalled on National Public Radio, Bailey had his work cut out for him replacing Jaco Pastorius, but \"Not only did he fill those big shoes, he carved those shoes out to fit his own feet. Victor said, 'Hey, I'm here. This is my gig now, and you are going to love me.'\" And the audiences did. Victor launched his successful solo career in 1988 and performed with a wide range of artists, including Sting, Madonna and Lady Gaga.\n\nBob Cranshaw — 11/2016\n\nMelbourne Robert \"Bob\" Cranshaw\n\ndied on November 2, 2016 after a battle with cancer.

He was born December 1, 1920 in St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands. His father, a bandleader, tried teaching him trombone and tuba, but Roy eventually decided that the double bass would be his instrument. Although he was largely self-taught, Roy was soon gigging with friends. In 1944, after military service, Roy arrived in New York City and studied for a time with Milt Hinton, then with NBC symphony bassist Milton Kestenbaum, David Walter and Fred Zimmerman. He quickly became an in-demand player and touring musician, all the while working occasional factory jobs to make ends meet. At age 47, he enrolled in Queens College and graduated in 1982 with a degree in early childhood education, and expanding his bass playing to orchestra work. He moved to Ocala with his wife Mary in 1991, and continued to play professionally. In 2005, Roy and his trio were featured artists at the 12th annual Florida Bass Bash.

He was 90 years old. He had a passion for teaching and an encyclopedic knowledge of repertoire, instruments, bows, luthiers and stories that he shared generously with his students. Bill Blossom, first John's student and later his colleague in the New York Philharmonic, remembers that \"down time with Johnny was rare but not altogether nonexistent, particularly on the off days of tours. His favorite pastime would be to go out on a walk in a foreign city around eleven in the morning, shuffling up and down every street and alleyway, stopping in front of every restaurant, inspecting every posted menu in a feverish search for calamari, his all-time favorite food. The other unspoken goal of these odysseys was to see if he could lose himself. London in particular was one of the few places on earth he would feel that sensation.\" John is survived by his wife, Martha, children Jennie and Joseph, step-children Paul Nowinski, Janice Nowinski, and Deborah Melchor, daughter-in-law Robin Nowinski, and grandchildren, Julie Melchor and Adam Melchor.\n\nJane Little — 5/2016\n\nJane Little, assistant principal bass emeritus with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the longest tenured orchestra musician in the world, died May 15, 2016. She fainted onstage during an encore to the evening's pops concert and never fully regained consciousness. She was 87 years old. A charter member of the Atlanta Youth Symphony, forerunner of the Atlanta Symphony, she made her debut as a bassist at age 16 after two years of studying bass in high school and never stopped. She played under all four of the orchestra's music directors as well as guest conductors including Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland, Pierre Boulez, Leopold Stokowski, Sir John Barbirolli, and James Levine. An Atlanta native, she attended the University of Georgia. She was principal bass with the Theater of the Stars orchestra for 15 years, and played extensively with regional ballet and opera companies, as well as in touring performances of the American Ballet Theatre, Covent Garden Ballet, and the Boris Goldovsky Opera Theatre. While playing in the symphony, she met her future husband, Warren Little, who played the flute. \"I must say that when I met Warren, I was very impressed that he played a small instrument,\" said the elegant, 4-foot, 11-inch, 98 pound musician in an interview, \"so he could carry my bass around!\" \"She seemed to be made of bass resin and barbed wire. She was unstoppable,\" said her section mate Michael Kurth, who was playing next to her when she collapsed. \"I honestly thought I was going to retire before she did,\" he told The Washington Post on Sunday night. The ISB will honor Jane Little and her many achievements by giving first prize in its 2017 orchestral bass competition in her name.\n\nTerri Neubert — 4/2016\n\nTerri Neubert, wife of ISB past president David Neubert and \"first fiddler\" of the ISB, died April 8, 2016 from complications of spinal meningitis. She was 55 years old. Terri was an accomplished professional violinist and educator and former president of the Texas Orchestra Directors Association. She was a joyous presence at our conventions, often gathering fellow folk musicians together for spontaneous performances in public spaces on our host campuses to entertain attendees.

Our hearts are broken for her husband David and their two sons, Josh and B.J.\n\nJohnterryl \"Terry\" Plumeri — 4/2016\n\nWith a collective and very heavy heart, the ISB shares the sad news that the gifted bassist, composer and conductor Johnterryl \"Terry\" Plumeri was found dead in his home on April 1st after neighbors called authorities, worried that he hadn't been seen for several days. Police are speculating that he was the victim in an apparent burglary.\n\nTerry began music study at the age of 10 and went on to attend The Manhattan School of Music in New York City on scholarship. It was here that Terry studied with Robert Brennand, principal bass of the New York Philharmonic. Later, during his period as a bassist with the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington D.C., he studied composition and conducting with Antal Dorati.\n\nHe not only composed for the concert hall and recital stage but also scored 57 feature films, including the award winning crime story \"One False Move,\" which was nominated for Best Score by the IFP Spirit Awards. Acclaimed for his arco solos, Terry played with such jazz greats as Cannonball Adderley, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Quincy Jones, Arthur Prysock, Frank Sinatra, Joe Williams, Les McCann, Yusef Lateef, John Abercrombie and Woody Herman.\n\nHis music for double bass found an admiring champion in ISB past president Diana Gannett, who has frequently programmed his works, and Terry himself was a presenter at the 2015 ISB convention in Fort Collins, where many members were fortunate to meet him.\n\nFrederick Charlton — 9/2015\n\nFrederick Charlton died on September 11, 2015 after a lengthy illness.

Equally well known as a composer and arranger, he received commissions from the Pacific Symphony, Carlos R. Nakai, Chamber Music Sedona, James Pellerite, R'eut Ben Zen, the Amadeus Trio and Saadoun Al'Bayati, and he wrote extensively for the Hutchins Consort.

Born in New York City to a musical family, he studied French horn and performed with the American Ballet Theatre at age 15, followed by positions with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. A self-taught composer, his Third Stream approach stressed improvisation within orchestral settings. Schuller wrote a concerto for double bass and a double bass quartet; the ISB honored him with its 1997 Special Recognition Award for Composition. Schuller moved easily between the worlds of classical and jazz music. He appeared on Miles Davis's landmark recording Birth of the Cool and co-founded the Modern Jazz Society and Lenox School of Jazz with pianist John Lewis, musical director of the Modern Jazz Quartet. Schuller and David Baker also co-founded and Washington, D.C.'s Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra.

The ISB had printed a list of members with addresses and I chose three bass players who lived the furthest away and wrote them a letter. The musician who replied was Wei Bao-Zheng, a member of the China Radio Broadcasting Symphony. He wrote and spoke English and for many years we corresponded once a month. In 1993 he contacted me because he was planning to attend the ISB Convention at Interlochen, Michigan and was very scared of coming to America. I told him I would attend and be there to help. We had the most exciting week. We cried and laughed at bass playing and lectures and the only thing he didn't love was American food. The high point of the week for both of us was a concert by the young Edgar Meyer, who made our jaws drop.\n\nIn the next few years Wei came to tour America with his wife, Jiang, and they stayed with my wife Phyllis and me. He kept inviting us to Beijing as his guest and in 2005, we spent 7 days with them. When you work for the government in China for 30 years, you are given another apartment and that is where Wei let us stay. It was only six blocks from Wei's apartment, so every morning he rode his bike over, put us in a cab or bus and we were shown the best of historical and cultural Beijing. It was amazing and we were treated like royalty.\n\nWei had classical bass students whom he taught in his apartment, and he invited Phyllis and I to watch him teach. I was impressed with the seriousness of his students and how much respect they had for him. Wei died in December, 2012, but I only found out in November, 2014. He was one of the most hardworking, serious bass players anywhere and he played first chair with the China Radio Symphony for years.

In 1987 in Rome, he performed a four-hour non-stop marathon, playing 28 pieces by 25 composers. As a composer, his catalogue includes more than 50 works, principally for strings, including Sei Studi for solo contrabass, Three String Quartets, Concertale for contrabass, strings and percussion and Six Duos.\n\nIn June 2004 Stefano premiered Sequenza XIVb by Luciano Berio in his own version for contrabass, from the original for cello. In 1983 he founded the \"Rassegna di Nuova Musica,\" a new music festival held annually in Macerata, Italy.\n\nBy a lovely coincidence, on Friday, May 25th, 8 PM at The Stone in New York City, Cleveland Symphony bassist Scott Dixon, along with Matteo Cesari (bass flute) and the Del Sol String Quartet, will perform music of Stefano Scodanibbio. Read more about his important and far too-short career. We're so sorry that this voyage had to end, and the ISB extends its deepest sympathies to Stefano Scodanibbio's family, friends, colleagues and fans everywhere.

He was 57 years old. He is remembered as a first-call \"musician's musician,\" equally at home playing in a symphony, for a Broadway show or in the classroom, but his greatest love was jazz. His first professional job was at age 13 performing with the Dorothy Ashby trio. After graduation from Cass Tech, he was a member of the Tommy Saunder traditional band, and toured with drummer J.C. Heard's big band, David Bowie and jazz greats such as Clark Terry. A favorite of vocalists, he toured nationally with Lena Horne, Joe Williams, Diane Schuur, Mel Torme, Rosemary Clooney, Johnny Mathis and Michael Feinstein. He also performed with Dizzy Gillespie and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. A respected classical bassist, he also played with the Detroit and Scandinavian Symphony Orchestras.

He received a scholarship to the University of Iowa (then the State University of Iowa), where he studied composition for both undergraduate and master's degrees and met his wife Maxine. They had four musical daughters, ten grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. After a brief stint with the National Symphony Orchestra, he returned to the University of Iowa to join the faculty and pursue his doctoral degree in 1947. During his tenure, he taught double bass, music appreciation, music theory and composition. He also collaborated with Tom Turner to write a book on musical form and analysis. In 1953 he took over the music appreciation classes at the university, which were broadcast on WSUI radio until 1973. He also served as principal bass with the Quad City Symphony Orchestra. He retired from the university in 1990. As Mario Chiarello noted in his own doctoral thesis: \"As a composer he wrote three symphonies, a concerto, and many other works. As a teacher he launched many students into careers, not all of which ended in music, and taught many non-musicians through his music appreciation classes and their broadcasts. Whatever hat he was wearing, he was always known for his positive attitude.\" Memorial contributions may be made to the Eldon Obrecht Fund at the University of Iowa School of Music, which will be used to fund a scholarship in his name.

A former high school science teacher, she became a violinmaker well known for her body of research into the acoustics of violins, and the creation of a family of eight proportionally-sized violins, The Violin Octet. From 2002 to 2003, Hutchins's octet was the subject of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, \"The New Violin Family: Augmenting the String Section.\" Her greatest innovation, still used by many violinmakers, was a technique known as free-plate tuning. When not attached to a violin, the top and back are called free plates. Her technique gives makers a precise way to refine these plates before a violin is assembled. Hutchins was founder of the New Violin Family Association, authored more than 100 technical publications, and edited two volumes of collected papers in violin acoustics. She was the recipient of four grants from the Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund for Music, two Guggenheim Fellowships, an Honorary Fellowship from the Acoustical Society of America, and four honorary doctorates. In 1963, Hutchins co-founded the Catgut Acoustical Society, which develops scientific insights into the construction of new and conventional instruments of the violin family."
