        "text": "Contact Information:\n\nFaculty Office Telephone: (909) 869-3562\n\nE-mail: jhriveire@cpp.edu\n\nMusic Department Office: (909) 869-3548\n\nFax #: (909) 869-3563\n\nEducation:\n\nDoctor of Musical Arts, University of Southern California\n\nMaster of Arts, California State University, Northridge\n\nBachelor of Music, University of North Texas\n\nSubjects:\n\nMusic Education\n\nStrings\n\nPhilharmonic Orchestra\n\nOpus String Ensemble\n\nBio:\n\nA not-quite-native Texan, Janine Riveire began playing contrabass at age 11. During high school she was chosen to perform with the Texas All-State Orchestra for three years; she earned her Bachelor of Music degree at the University of North Texas in 1983, where she received the Symphony Orchestra Scholarship. After moving to California in 1987, Dr. Riveire earned her M.A. in music with honors at California State University, Northridge. She completed her D.M.A. at the University of Southern California in 1997, with a specialty in music education. At Northridge she was named outstanding music graduate in 1992.\n\nIn her 26 years of teaching she has taught in both public and private K-12 schools, as well as at the college level. Dr. Riveire is a specialist in strings education (ages 8-88), but has also taught general music (music fundamentals) and music history and has conducted both vocal and instrumental ensembles. Dr. Riveire is a tenured Professor in music at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, leading the music education program and acting as liaison to the teacher credentialing program there. A long-time member of the American String Teachers Association, Dr. Riveire has served as secretary and president of the Los Angeles section as well as the general board.\n\nTrained in Rolland’s methodology, she has also studied the pedagogical approach of Kato Havas and connected string movement study to the work in theater and dance by Rudolph Laban. Her research explores the development of bodily understanding of rhythm and movement and how to defeat that famous stereotype that string players can’t count their way out of a paper bag.\n\nAs a contrabassist she enjoys playing with community orchestras, including West Hollywood Orchestra, Burbank Symphony and the Santa Monica College Symphony Orchestra. Her recent sabbatical study with Bert Turetzky yielded an enthusiasm for music for the unaccompanied bass, particularly for talking bassist. She cites her musical influences as being Gary Karr, Bert Turetzky, Kato Havas, and Ella Fitzgerald. As part of her work at Santa Monica College and USC, Dr. Riveire developed a textbook for mixed beginning- and intermediate-level string classes, which she calls A Common Core. The book was used for 10 semesters at Santa Monica. Dr Riveire is a frequent presenter at California Music Educators conferences, and has presented twice before at ASTA national conferences.\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nMotion study in string playing\n\nCurriculum design for K-16 music\n\nMusic for unaccompanied contrabass\n\nMusic for speaking contrabassist\n\nPedagogy for the beginning string class\n\nFavorite Links\n\nArts advocacy resources\n\nwww.americansforthearts.org\n\nwww.artsed411.org\n\nhttp://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/\n\nhttp://www.dana.org/news/artseducationinthenews/\n\nAssessment in music\n\nhttp://www.music.miami.edu/assessment/\n\nhttp://rubistar.4teachers.org/index.php\n\nProfessional organizations\n\nCMEA: www.calmusiced.com\n\nASTA: www.astaweb.com\n\nMENC: www.menc.org\n\nISB: www.isbworldoffice.com\n\nOAKE (Kodaly): www.oake.org\n\nCredentialing and jobs"
