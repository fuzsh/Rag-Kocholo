        "text": "(WEAA) - Known for the rare sweetness in her voice, particularly in her scat singing, Ella Fitzgerald was the most popular American jazz singer in the United States for more than half a century.\n\nThroughout her career, she has performed alongside other influential jazz artists such as Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Nat King Cole, and Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nBefore fame, Fitzgerald went through a rough patch in her life becoming an orphan at the age of 15.\n\nWith difficulty adjusting to new circumstances, her grades dropped in school and she engaged in illegal activities in order to make way for herself.\n\nAfter being taken into police custody, she was sent to reform school where she suffered abuse from her caretakers.\n\nWhile Fitzgerald dealt with a series of challenging events, this did not prevent her from achieving success.\n\nIn 1934, Fitzgerald made her most important debut at the age of 17 at Harlem’s Apollo Theatre.\n\nAlthough she had the intentions of dancing on stage, she made the decision to sing. Fitzgerald performed Connee Boswell’s rendition of “Judy”, resulting in her being awarded with first prize.\n\nLittle did she know, this would lead to her significant career as one of the leading jazz vocalists in history.\n\nFitzgerald suffered from diabetes for several years of her later life which led to numerous complications such as respiratory problems, congestive heart failure, and exhaustion.\n\nDue to the effects of diabetes, she had to have both of her legs amputated below the knees in 1993. She passed away on June 15, 1996, in her Beverly hills home at the age of 79.\n\nIn her lifetime, Fitzgerald won 13 Grammy awards. She was the first African American woman to receive a Grammy Award in 1958.\n\nElla Fitzgerald sold over 40 million albums. Singing sultry ballads and having the ability to imitate every instrument in an orchestra, she was tremendously loved by her audience and those she collaborated with.\n\nInformation gathered from:\n\nhttp://www.ellafitzgerald.com/about/biography"
