        "text": "From the Pitchfork Review: Two Turntables and a Saxophone\n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar walked onstage for his performance at this year’s Grammy Awards, hands cuffed and clinking as part of a chain gang, saxophone player Terrace Martin stood to his left, blowing doleful notes from inside a jail cell. Lamar won five awards that night, including Best Rap Album for To Pimp a Butterfly, a record that heavily features Martin. The prison imagery gave way to pyrotechnics and ended with Lamar’s frame silhouetted against a map of Africa, with his Compton hometown labeled where the Sahara desert would be. Joined by all African-American dancers in front of a largely white Staples Center crowd, the blazing medley of TPAB’s “The Blacker the Berry” and “Alright” carried a sense of history in the making.\n\nThis momentousness was embodied in the music, a heady update of pointillistic astral jazz and hypnotic G-funk. It’s fitting that Martin, who’s producing records for Compton rapper YG and jazz legend Herbie Hancock, later told a reporter the first face he saw from stage that night was the veteran pianist’s. At the 1984 Grammys, Hancock’s keytar-wielding rendition of crossover hit “Rockit” marked another milestone for hip-hop, jazz, and pop culture overall.\n\nFrom the awards-show stage to fellow TPAB collaborator Kamasi Washington’s 2015 saxophone opus The Epic, jazz and hip-hop are colliding in beautiful ways lately. But jazz and rap have long been close relatives. Jazz, in spirit, is actually something of hip-hop’s ancestor, not only because of rap’s frequent use of direct jazz samples, but also in the shared traditions of African-American free expression, avant-garde experimentation, and even solo parts that build upon each other. First the ensemble jam, then the posse cut.\n\nA master of the nexus between these two crucial art forms was the late Detroit producer J Dilla. Indeed, on “The Introduction,” from his long-lost vocal album The Diary, he raps about listening to Q-Tip, “My pops used to say it reminded him of jazz cats/ See, he told me that this game go in cycles.” If Dilla is correct, the cycle has come full circle again.\n\nThe Pitchfork Review reached out to a who’s who of rappers, producers, and jazz musicians working on the borders between the two genres to ask them two questions: What jazz record should every rap lover own? And what rap record should every jazz lover own? Let the cross-pollination of jazz and hip-hop continue.\n\nAnenon\n\nLos Angeles saxophonist, producer, and arranger.\n\nKeith Jarrett, Eyes of the Heart\n\nis one of those ECMs that every hip-hop digger has come across at some point. I remember picking up a 99 cent copy in the early 2000s at Amoeba LA and trying to sample it, but never using it for my early productions. When I started listening to it for its music instead of its sample potential, everything changed for me. I began to take jazz seriously as the next musical frontier that I needed to pursue as both a performer and listener. Keith’s soprano saxophone solo (his recorded soprano saxophone output is rare) on “Part 1” is so raw and emotional on top of Charlie Haden’s pillar-like bass vamps and Paul Motian’s skittering drums. When Dewey Redman finally emerges at the end of “Part 2,” his tenor solo is one of the most heartfelt improvisational musical moments in history. This album is one of the few reasons that I picked up the saxophone in my early 20s. Eyes of the Heart is a great transitional listen for fans of hip-hop seeking more free, yet still not too out there, sounds.\n\nQuasimoto, The Unseen\n\nThe Unseen is to me, Madlib’s masterpiece. Raw, strange, free hip-hop production coupled with Madlib’s helium-induced freeform raps on top. Jazz heads will dig Otis Jackson Jr.’s rapping style, always reminiscent of a twisted jazz solo, and the production is always so swinging to keep anyone interested. My dad would even let me play this in the car during my high school days because of the jazzy beats. This was a huge production influence early on for me, and while I don’t listen to it as much as I used to, whenever I go back I’m transported to simpler, loop-based, hazy days.\n\nIshmael Butler\n\nFrontman for Seattle-based experimental hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces and reunited Brooklyn alternative hip-hop trio Digable Planets\n\nLightnin’ Rod, Hustlers Convention\n\nWhen complexity is the goal of an artist to me it always plays boring. Grown rich-broke-baby-men throwing tantrums or pseudo-intellectual-corporate hood representatives pursuing riches through the mascotization of our struggle make the trill of us smirk. Now, the age of the underwhelming spectacle. Enter the “schoolyard bard” Jalal Mansur Nuriddin. He be never none of this.\n\nMiles Davis, On the Corner\n\nBack when, in NYC, teeming in neighborhoods where the beautifulest survivors dwelt stacked with energy of racing minds and pounding hearts exploring in action the concept they call freedom, a brilliantly colored sound pronounces. Way past meaning, this sound makes path for members to escape into light and for observers to participate with the primordial essences their civilization requires they kill with etiquette. The energies captured in this artifice contain all humanesses forgotten. High music from the neon black cipher.\n\nDJ Premier\n\nBrooklyn hip-hop producer/DJ and formerly one-half of the duo Gang Starr.\n\nJohn Coltrane, A Love Supreme\n\nIt is a four-part LP broken up into a suite. It speaks to you soulfully even if you’ve never heard a jazz album in pure form. It is a must-have period.\n\nPublic Enemy, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back\n\nThis album must be owned by anyone that claims to love rap music. It not only is lyrically vital to life’s survival, but the production and DJ scratching is phenomenal and will not be denied. The Rhyme Animal Chuck D, The Spark Plug Flavor Flav, DJ Terminator X, The S1W’s, Professor Griff & The Bomb Squad on Production is technically an airplane that never crashes.\n\nBenny Cassette\n\nLos Angeles-based producer, singer, and songwriter whose projects have included Kanye West’s Yeezus album.\n\nMiles Davis, Bitches Brew\n\nThis album was revolutionary because it had two bass players and two to three drummers on it, so the rhythms are crazy. It opened my eyes to what you could do with bass and drums and how they could be so melodic and musical. On top of that, everything on here sounds like a crazy sample, which I tried to do over and over but was never successful at, because it all flows, and it’s seamless to the point I could never pick a part to chop.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest, Low End Theory\n\nFor me, great jazz records really feel like everyone in the room is playing together in a zone — and all the musicians are completely in sync with each other. When I discovered this album it really sounded like each part of the beat was made for each other. Every sample had the perfect drums and vocal on it and sonically, it’s like a great jazz album because everything is sitting right where it should be.\n\nDomino\n\nMember of Oakland, California-based underground hip-hop collective Hieroglyphics\n\nDonald Byrd, Places and Spaces\n\nThe jazz record every hip-hop lover should own is Places and Spaces by Donald Byrd but, more importantly, produced by the Mizell Brothers. Although it is more of a soul-jazz fusion album as opposed to straight-ahead jazz (jazz purists will cringe), the Mizell Brothers created a sound that is one of the blueprints of hip-hop jazz and neo-soul. They did many other important albums including Black Byrd and Black and Blues but Places and Spaces is their sound at its very best.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest, Low End Theory\n\nThe hip hop record every jazz lover should own is Low End Theory by A Tribe Called Quest. It is hip-hop incorporating jazz rhythms at its best, in addition, Q-Tip’s attitude and style is very jazz musician centric. I think it’s important that Tip references the connection to jazz of the past and current hip hop immediately on the first song of the album, “Excursions”: “My pops used to say it reminded him of be-bop, I said that daddy don’t you know that things go in cycles…”\n\nJermaine Dupri\n\nProducer, songwriter, and rapper from Atlanta.\n\nBob James, One\n\nDr. Dre, The Chronic\n\nThe Bob James album sounds like a rap album without the raps, and The Chronic for its samples, live instrumentation, and sound quality.\n\nFreddie Gibbs\n\nLos Angeles-via-Gary, Indiana rapper.\n\nMiles Davis, Kind of Blue\n\nKind of Blue is one of the best records of all time. Miles’ use of space is something rap fans can definitely appreciate. Sometimes you have to let the track breathe and throw a melody in here and there. He never did too much on Kind of Blue, it’s the perfect vibe.\n\nFreddie Gibbs and Madlib, Piñata\n\nPiñata is a great rap record for jazz fans. Madlib isn’t a beatmaker, he’s a producer. The way we approached the album was like two jazz musicians, he’s the rhythm section and I used my voice to solo on top. A lot of improvisation and freedom went into Piñata.\n\nRobert Glasper\n\nHouston-born jazz pianist, producer, and leader of the Robert Glasper Experiment, whose 2012 album Black Radio won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Album.\n\nRoy Hargrove Presents the RH Factor, Hard Groove\n\nRoy is the first jazz cat of our generation to really mingle with hip-hop and soul on a high level. He’s on Common’s Like Water for Chocolate and D’Angelo’s Voodoo and went on the tours. So this album had a cool way of making jazz accessible for that particular audience.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest, Midnight Marauders\n\nTribe is the first group to really use jazz samples and bring jazz to the forefront of hip-hop. Even having jazz musicians come and play live in studio!\n\nJ-Zone\n\nNew York City rapper and producer and author of 2011 book Root for the Villain: Rap, Bullshit and a Celebration of Failure\n\nMax Roach, Drums Unlimited\n\nI’ve always felt Max Roach was a master of making rhythms melodic. Rhythms (and drums) make up about 70 percent of hip-hop. Every producer should own and study this album. Even MCs’ cadences are all rhythm. On “The Drum Also Waltzes,” there’s a steady pulse with his bass drum and hi-hat foot and all the lyrics are what he does with his hands. That’s almost like when the Southern cats would keep chanting the chorus while the verse was going. “For Big Sid” — that’s one of Max’s instantly identifiable licks. You hear it and know it’s him, like Big L, and Lord Finesse with those compound punch lines. This album has so much in common with hip-hop and Max was one of the older musicians who actually embraced hip-hop in the ’80s. Me being both a drummer and a hip-hop artist, Drums Unlimited is a treasure trove of ideas.\n\nGang Starr, Step In The Arena\n\nMy dad was probably in the minority as a parent who was really into hip-hop in the early ’90s. He always said this album reminded him of a great jazz album and I see what he means now. These were the days when albums had no guest appearances and Guru had a tone that came across like he was an elder statesman trying to pass on wisdom. It felt like an intimate conversation with no distractions, and jazz is a conversation. The album was considered jazzy compared to other rap albums of the time due to some of the samples and Guru’s eventual association with jazz, but not in the same way US3 or Jazzmatazz were jazzy. Listening to this was almost like you were in a hole-in-the-wall jazz club deep in the hood and it was a trio—Guru, the beats, and DJ Premier’s cuts.\n\nLyrics Born\n\nBerkeley, California rapper and producer who is one-half of the duo Latyrx with Lateef the Truth Speaker.\n\nWeldon Irvine, Sinbad\n\nMost jazz aficionados would not consider this a pure jazz record at all, but for the hip-hop fan, this record is pure nirvana. It’s just jazzy enough, with equal parts funk and soul for the average hip-hop head to grasp, and any person with ears will recognize the A Tribe Called Quest-sampled “Here’s Where I Came In” for their classic “Award Tour.”\n\nFreestyle Fellowship, Innercity Griots\n\nIt’s the most interesting, non-hokey, and successful fusion of experimental jazz principles, aesthetics, and dynamics, and credible, envelope-pushing hip-hop. It incorporates everything from scatting, recorded improvisation, and live instrumentation (rare for that era).\n\nBilly Martin\n\nPercussionist in jazz-funk trio Medeski, Martin & Wood and breakbeat producer under the Illy B alias.\n\nOrnette Coleman, Virgin Beauty\n\nIf you think about the Prime Time stuff [Coleman’s ’80s group], there’s experimenting with grooves and multiple grooves and things like that, which is kind of obvious. But it’s really more about the interplay in how the harmolodic concept of making music is I think really important for the hip-hop musician. Especially the young ones. Because it will open up their ears. There’s an aspect of rhythm and groove to it, but it’s just so open. It kind of blows the whole thing out of the water in a sense. It’s also good for hip-hoppers to hear what jazz musicians that didn’t stop innovating ever, what they were doing with rhythm. It’s not just Kind of Blue or A Love Supreme.\n\nWu-Tang Clan, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\n\nI just focus on the artists that have a really strong style and are innovative in their way. And that’s Wu-Tang Clan. It has a lot to do with individual style, and I think that’s really important. It’s almost in a crisis with upcoming jazz musicians today, young players, that they don’t have a voice. They don’t have a strong individual voice. I think that Wu-Tang nailed it in that way.\n\nGregory Porter\n\nSoulful jazz singer behind the 2013 Blue Note LP Liquid Spirit.\n\nEddie Jefferson, Body and Soul\n\nIf you listen to Eddie Jefferson’s phrasing and his voice, he in a way is the original Ol’ Dirty Bastard. There’s a lot of humor in his delivery and the lyrics that he writes, definitely as an individual character he is very much like a hip-hop performer. And his poetry is very strong throughout all of his records, but a good example of it is Body and Soul. The original Ol’ Dirty Bastard. You’ll hear it in his phrasing, and his voice, and his style.\n\nPharcyde, Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde\n\nWhen I heard that record, there were so many references — so many samples on the entire record, but in particular in “Passin’ Me By.” Almost three-quarters of the way through the song, when the rapper starts to do a vocalese, in the style of Eddie Jefferson. I remember a lot of people at the time becoming more interested in jazz and Blue Note Records based on that record. I was trying to emulate the style of Eddie Jefferson at the time, and I remember people being interested in my version of “Moody’s Mood for Love,” because it reminded them of what they’d heard on a Pharcyde record. I love the way that Pharcyde works as an ensemble, very much in the way that a group of master jazz musicians work, each of them expounding on the style and maybe the timing and the phrasing of each other. The first MC laying down a pattern, a style, a rhythm, and the second one following that style but then switching it up a bit. And that’s something— when I hear Miles come after Coltrane, come after Cannonball Adderley, in a way they all follow the lead of the first soloist, but then expound on the concept. Not in a deeper way, but just in a different way. I hear that on the Pharcyde record and in particular on “Passin’ Me By.” The similarities and commonalities that exist in jazz and hip-hop can be seen in the phrasing, the musical charisma of the individual player, and, in hip-hop, just straight-up using jazz to inspire something new.\n\nRicky Reed\n\nOakland-born, Los Angeles-based producer and member of electronic group Wallpaper.\n\nOrnette Coleman, The Shape of Jazz to Come\n\nCould have been just as easily titled The Shape of Revolution to Come. Largely understood as the beginning of free jazz, it feels more like the start of punk to me. Ornette’s technical credentials were widely disputed, but he pushed forward with calculated abandon and made bold, unhinged music which, although it predates the full boiling over of the civil rights movement, was and still is the best soundtrack for change.\n\nDanny Brown, XXX\n\nThe great instrumentals vary from lush and soulful to dark and glitchy, but they are not what draws the listener in. Danny is an unflinchingly ferocious rapper, but when he strips away the bravado and dives into stories about growing up in Detroit and wrestling with drug addiction, his vulnerability is disarming and intoxicating.\n\nKarriem Riggins\n\nDetroit-born jazz drummer as well as producer for the likes of Common, Slum Village, Talib Kweli, the Roots, and Kanye West.\n\nMiles Davis, Kind of Blue\n\nI was in sixth grade when I discovered this record in my dad’s records. Listening to this record taught me how to listen. I learned all of the melodies and solos on the record. It helped me understand phrasing. Once I learned the solos it was like seeing a “droste effect” [ed.: In the visual arts, this is a technique where the artist creates a picture within a picture, going on to infinity]. This record is a classic and the drummer Jimmy Cobb was all about simplicity and groove.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest, Midnight Marauders\n\nThis is one of the only hip-hop records that I listen where there isn’t a song skipped. The beats on this record inspired me to push the envelope and to also having an open ear to fusing all types of genres with hip-hop. These brothers changed the sound of hip-hop and are the pioneers that I respect and honor.\n\nRJD2\n\nPhiladelphia-based hip-hop producer, whose 2006 instrumental “A Beautiful Mine” was immortalized as the theme from \"Mad Men.\"\n\nBob James, One\n\nThere is the obvious reason for rap fans — the album contains “Nautilus,” which is a staple of rap records going back 30 years — but when one delves deeper into the record, the subsequent layers are equally amazing. The playing, arrangements, and engineering are almost impossibly tight and concise. The grooves are cavernously deep. But this record can also be a perfect gateway to fusion, which, once acclimated to, can pay huge dividends as a musical interest.\n\nOrganized Konfusion, Stress: The Extinction Agenda\n\nI see Pharoahe Monch as rap’s logical heir to Thelonious Monk’s crown. Pharoahe’s command of rhythm is unparalleled to my ears in the realm of rap music. His phrasing is so hyper-tuned, advanced, and still full of character; I can’t help but to be reminded of Monk’s same unique and genius sense of rhythm.\n\nSassyBlack\n\nSeattle-based singer, songwriter, and producer and half of R&B/hip-hop duo THEESatisfaction.\n\nElla Fitzgerald, Pure Ella\n\nFor the hip hop/rap heads, grab the 1998 Pure Ella compilation. Ella Fitzgerald is one of my favorite vocalists of all time. The way she approached her songs was incredibly fearless and fierce. Very percussive with her articulation and scatting, she is definitely one of the many predecessors to rap and hip-hop.\n\nLauryn Hill, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\n\nFor the jazz lovers, get into Lauryn Hill’s Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (also released in '98). Lauryn’s voice is thick, hard and full of life. Deep songs like “Zion” and “I Used to Love Him” will resonate with any Sarah Vaughan or Nancy Wilson fan. The passion encompassed in the performance of each song is genuine and the musicality is spot on.\n\nThis story originally appeared in our print quarterly, The Pitchfork Review*.
