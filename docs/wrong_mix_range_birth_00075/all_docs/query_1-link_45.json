Or just listen and laugh. The theme changes every month.\n\nHOW THE SHOW WORKS:\n\nAnybody can put their name in the hat for a chance to tell their true, personal story on the theme.\n\nStorytellers will be mostly picked at random from the names in the hat. We may have one or two special picked guests. We usually have time for 8 to 10 open-mic storytellers. We also present one or two Featured Storytellers from our wonderful storytelling community. These are people who have won awards at various shows, or just are known to us for their great storytelling style and charisma. The Featured Storytellers tell true, personal stories, but a little longer than the open-mic'ers. This month's featured storyteller is Beau Ryder Davis,\n\nBeau Ryder Davis is an 8-time Moth StorySlam winner and recent Grandslam Champion, telling stories and performing comedy in Oakland, California. He has recently appeared on NPR's Moth Radio Hour and is currently working on a long-form show about growing up in, getting out of, and returning to his hometown of Hazard, Kentucky.\n\nThere is excellent food and drink available from the Sound Room cafe.\n\nThe venue is wheelchair accessible. There will be one intermission.\n\nNo pressure! Just have fun. There is no voting and no judging.\n\nTickets at StorySlam\n\nView Event →\n\nJules Leyhe & The Family Jules Blues Blowout featuring Jimmy Leslie\n\nJoin us for our monthly Blues Blowout. You won't want to miss these!\n\nJules Leyhe might look like your everyday, average, unassuming guy, but he’s one of the world’s foremost blues slide-guitar players—so much so that even Premier Guitar magazine called his music “the best blues slide licks since Derek Trucks, maybe even Duane Allman.” Those might sound like some big boots, but this Oakland native not only fills them, he wears them out and has to order new ones. This year, he is showcasing a new blues series at the Sound Room, where Leyhe and his Family Jules Blues Blowout will be joined by local blues players from around the Bay each month. This month, they’re joined by guitarist and vocalist Jimmy Leslie.\n\nJimmy Leslie, aka \"Trickey Frets\" is a Bay Area based guitar player and vocalist who is Frets Editor at Guitar Player magazine, and leader of Spirit Hustler and the Allmond Brothers. Leslie co-founded the Guitarfish Music Festival and the Star City Music Festival. He authored the eco-musical, Guitarfish Adventures: Blue is the New Green.\n\nTickets at July Blues Showcase\n\nView Event →\n\nMarina Crouse with the Garth Webber Band\n\nMarina Crouse is one of the most notable talents on the San Francisco/Bay Area music scene. Her early classical training is reflected in her powerful and versatile vocal style that creates a genuine excitement in every performance. Blessed with an incredibly expressive voice early in life, Marina Crouse applies her distinctive talents to a wide range of material while delivering an emotional authenticity that consistently cuts deep. “When I sing,” she says, “I feel like I break myself open and let a little piece of myself come out. I’m reaching out to people with hopes to connect on a personal level. And when we do, that to me is better than anything else.\"\n\nGarth Webber has played with Miles Davis, Gregg Allman, Bill Champlin, Bob Weir & Kingfish, Mose Alison, Lydia Pense & Cold Blood, Merl Saunders, Robben Ford, Jan Garrett & JD Martin, The Ford Blues Band, Joe Louis Walker, Volker Strifler, Andy Just, Terry Haggerty, Terry Hiatt, Kaye Bohler & The Blue Meanies.\n\nTickets at Marina Crouse with the Garth Weber Band\n\nView Event →\n\nGrateful Brass with The Jazz Mafia\n\nGrateful Brass reimagines the iconic music of the Grateful Dead with an instrumentation of brass, drums and vocals (no guitar!). The music digs deep into the Grateful Dead discography with creative re-imaginations infused with the ebullient spirit of New Orleans Second Line, trance-like grooves of Afrobeat, brass-driven energy of Balkan music, and energetic Afro-Cuban polyrhythms, all sitting on top of a heavy foundation of funk.\n\nGrateful Brass is led by Adam Theis who is a current member of The Wolf Pack with Bob Weir & Wolf Bros and whose arrangements are featured in their live shows, as well as two Bob Weir albums released in 2022 (“Bobby Weir & Wolf Bros: Live in Colorado” and “Bobby Weir & Wolf Bros: Live in Colorado Vol. 2”).\n\nSome of the ﬁnest musicians on the West Coast have joined Theis in creating this newest offshoot of the Bay Area music collective Jazz Maﬁa; many who have long collaborated with other artists in the Grateful Dead community like Mickey Hart, Joe Russo's Ain't Dead Yet, Peter Rowan, Reed Mathis, Jackie Greene, and Cold Blood.\n\nGrateful Brass embraces the challenge of carrying on a 50+ year tradition of imagination, creativity, and groovy improvisatory adventures. This loving homage will make you fall in love with Grateful Dead's music all over again, or for the ﬁrst time.\n\nFeaturing: Kate Lamont - vocals; Adam Theis - trombone, band leader; Mike Olmos - trumpet; Ross Eustis - trumpet; Tommy Occhiuto - sax; Jonathan Seiberlich - sousaphone; Darian Gray - drums\n\nTickets at Grateful Brass\n\nView Event →\n\nKelyn-Kai-Lorenzo-Martin\n\nCome on out for a great evening of music! Come hear this super talented-tasteful band, where everyone is very busy w/ tours and musicals and this Wednesday date appears to be the magic one.\n\nGuitar focused quartet performing a range of instrumental covers and arrangements of contemporary pop-RnB-Soul-Rock and music from Al Green, Radiohead, Jet, Marvin Gaye, Solange, and more.\n\nFeaturing Kelyn Crapp on guitar: From Dallas, TX and graduated from the University of North Texas in Denton with a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Guitar Performance, Kelyn has played professionally since the age of 16 and has performed with or opened for such luminous musicians as Lucky Peterson, Wynton Marsalis, Archie Shepp, Bernie Worrell, Dolly Parton, Stanley Clarke, Snarky Puppy, Herlin Riley, Robert Randolph, the Skatalites, Emily King.\n\nKai Lyons on guitar: From the Excelsior District of San Francisco and completed his studies at Ruth Asawa School of the Arts in 2012 as the first to graduate from the acclaimed Classical Guitar Program, directed by Scott Cmiel. From 2012-2014, on full scholarship, Kai attended the prestigious jazz program at William Paterson University of New Jersey, directed by Mulgrew Miller. He studied with Vincent Herring, Gene Bertoncini, Harold Mabern, Rich Perry, and Hal Galper. He has performed with Mike Clark and Donald Harrison of Herbie Hancock’s Original Headhunters, Louis Romero, award-winning organist Wil Blades, Larry Vuckovich, Sueños and Illy Bogart.\n\nLorenzo Loera on bass/organ: Formed in the subway systems of Oakland, retro-soul outfit The California Honeydrops are an electrifying group that defy convention at every turn. They’ve become a mainstay at festivals including Byron Bay Bluesfest (Australia), Outside Lands, Monterey Jazz, Lightning In A Bottle, and touring with B.B. King, Dr. John, Bonnie Raitt, Buddy Guy, and Allen Toussaint. The Honeydrops feature Lorenzo Loera on keyboards/guitar, navigating through a vast repertoire of original songs and timeless classics every night.\n\nMartin Diller on drums : Music director and drummer Martin Diller tours internationally and records with acts like Postmodern Jukebox, Yuna, Amber Coffman, Sara Niemietz & Snuffy Walden, Casey Abrams, Haley Reinhart, Gia Woods, Tiffany Stringer, Holychild, GIVERS and as music director for comedians Tom Papa and Todd Glass. He continues to pursue his love for Jazz by writing and recording for small ensemble groups.\n\nTickets at Kelyn-Kai-Lorenzo-Martin\n\nView Event →\n\nHowellDevine\n\nTriple threat talent, Joshua Howell (guitar, harmonica, vocals) and percussion savant, Pete Devine (drums, washboard), plus veteran upright bassist, Joe Kyle Jr. deftly mix Delta/Country Blues with wildly syncopated rhythms to create a rollicking present-day sound rooted in early blues. Their music stands in stark contrast to the typical blues heard in bars these days and would more likely be shaking the floors of a Southern juke joint some 70 years ago.\n\nFrom Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf to Son House and B.B. King, blues artists have claimed some of the most evocative monikers in American music. With its intimations of primal sacred cries, HowellDevine embodies that legacy in word and deed, delivering elemental blues and boogie like juke joint prophets. Featuring Eli’s Mile High Club-honed Joshua Howell on slide guitars, harmonica, and vocals, percussion expert Roll ’Em Pete Devine on drums and washboard, and the relentlessly propulsive Joe Kyle Jr. on bass, the combo taps into red clay Delta roots while embracing fierce grooves that speak to urban realities. While debates about authenticity and the blues often devolve into tiresome stalemates, the fact that HowellDevine was the first blues act signed by Chris Strachwitz to his Arhoolie Records label in a quarter century speaks to the band’s unusual feel for the tradition. The result was 2013’s Jumps, Boogies & Wobbles, which neatly sums up their irresistible sound. ​~ Andrew Gilbert\n\nTickets at HowellDevine\n\nView Event →\n\nRico Jones Quartet\n\nRico Jones is a rising star and one of the most accomplished saxophonists of his generation.

Over the months, they assembled a studio in his fathers aircraft hangar and invited the three other musicians to rehearse new music to livestream and record.\n\nSelf-recorded in an airplane hangar in rural Alaska during a pandemic exile, 2021’s “Second Wave” delivered the story of a group of young musicians using exceptional circumstances to create personal & musical connection, and ultimately, a stirring documentation of time-well-spent.\n\nWith this script in hand, Meridian Odyssey returned to Big Lake in August 2021, settling in for six days of intense rehearsals of nine new originals, with time off for sailing, flying and hiking together.\n\nWith trumpeter Noah Halpern joining the core band of saxophonist Santosh Sharma, bassist Ben Feldman, pianist Dylan Hayes, guitarist Martin Budde, and drummer/producer/engineer Xavier Lecouturier, the group found a new power and focus in their sound, with the expanded front line and the growing conceptual openness the band had developed.\n\nBorn from the perceivably “lost” years of ’20 & ’21, “Earthshine” will speak to the creative read and react of six musicians on the literal threshold of their careers.

It wasn’t a hard choice, she recalled, and now it’s become a large part of my life. She’s been able to connect with new friends and build community. It’s also been easier for her to talk to people who are going through similar experiences.\n\nShe returns to the Sound Room with an amazing band:\n\nRay Obiedo guitar\n\nPeter Horvath keys\n\nDan Feiszli bass\n\nPhil Hawkins drums\n\nJon Bendich percussion\n\nTickets at Chloe Jean\n\nView Event →\n\nNeighborhood Nite: Food, Music, Fun!\n\nDrop in, grab a bite to eat or something to drink and listen to the 12 piece Lucky Devils Band.

He's a force on the microphone with a first rate, church house tenor’, that he was blessed with. He has a sound that will remind you of a young BB King or Buddy Guy, Elmore James and Little Johnny Taylor.\n\nAlabama Mike was born Michael Benjamin in Talladega Alabama in 1964. This was where he spent all of his formative years. Early on, he was musically influenced by his father Joseph Benjamin. Joseph was a very talented quartet, tenor vocalist from whom he inherited that soulful, gospel drenched approach to his vocal style. He sings low down blues or uptown soul with the style and finesse of a vocal master.\n\nHe has been nominated for by the Blues Foundation for Traditional Blues Artist Of The Year 2011 and Traditional Blues Band Of The Year 2014 with The Hound Kings . He won Traditional Blues Artist Of The year 2010 by the Bay Area Blues Society. In addition, he has played major festivals, both domestically and internationally.

Andalusia in southern Spain is the heartland of Flamenco, although it also has roots in regions such as Murcia and Extremadura. Cante is the vocal expression of flamenco, sung by men and women, preferably seated, with no backing singers. The gamut of feelings and states of mind – grief, joy, tragedy, rejoicing and fear – can be expressed through sincere, expressive lyrics characterized by brevity and simplicity.\n\nFlamenco baile is a dance of passion, courtship, expressing a wide range of situations ranging from sadness to joy. The technique is complex, differing depending on whether the performer is male (heavier use of the feet) or female (gentler, more sensual movements). Toque or the art of guitar playing has long surpassed its original role as accompaniment. Other instruments, including castanets, hand-clapping and foot-stamping are also employed.\n\nFlamenco is performed during religious festivals, rituals, church ceremonies and at private celebrations. It is the badge of identity of numerous communities and groups, in particular the Gitano (Roma) ethnic community, which has played an essential role in its development. Transmission occurs through dynasties, families, social groups and Flamenco clubs, all of which play a key role in its preservation and dissemination.\n\nTickets at An Evening of Flamenco\n\nView Event →\n\nHannah Mayer Quartet\n\nHannah Mayer is a 21-year-old pianist and composer from El Cerrito, currently attending Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, MD.

He is highly respectful of blues traditions, yet understands how to interpret it in innovative ways. I think we will look back in 20 years and realize we witnessed something very special in the evolution of the blues.\" Michael Kinsman, San Diego Blues Festival\n\nCharlie Musselwhite-endorsed Aki Kumar proves to traditionalists that singing in Hindi can co-exist with Chicago blues conventions. This Indian-American’s intense sense of musical discovery as an able vocalist and harmonica player drives worry-and-regret makeovers of Bollywood film songs and adds bounce to a reggae version of “Watermelon Man.” Boosted by top West Coast blues personnel and cross-cultural extras, Kumar proves that the integrity of his music marks the difference between novelty and substance.\n\nKumar was born and grew up in Mumbai, where his parents' upbringing and eclectic tastes—his father spoke Kannada, his mother Telugu—exposed him to a broad range of sounds—everything from rock 'n' roll and pop to the more traditional sounds of Bollywood film scores and Indian classical music. In his youth, he studied both keyboards and tabla, and acquired his first harmonica from his father. He listened to \"everything from Bach to John Denver, from Stevie Wonder to the Police\" in addition to music that dominated the Indian subcontinent.\n\nHe moved to the US in 1998 to study computer science, initially in Oklahoma City and then at San Jose State University in Silicon Valley. He was first attracted to American oldies radio, and then discovered the blues by visiting nightclubs and bars in the Bay Area.Soon after completing a degree, he went to work at Adobe. He has now turned to music full-time.\n\nKumar's harmonica playing is rooted in the classical style invented by Little Walter and others, but his blues style is eclectic.He developed his skills by studying with David Barrett, who operates the School of the Blues in San Jose. He played regularly in the band Tip of the Top for several years before forming his own band and launching a solo career.\n\nKumar expresses his pride in his Indian heritage by blending melodies from Hindi movies and Indian classical music with American blues, creating a fusion of East and West that he calls \"Bollywood blues\".\n\nTickets at Aki Kumar\n\nView Event →\n\nErik Jekabson Quintet\n\nErik Jekabson is a trumpet player, composer, arranger and educator who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Schermer’s songs have been covered by blues award recipients Tommy Castro, Billy Price and the late Frank Bey to name just a few.

Smoky vocals are delivered in well-chosen glassware, telling stories that warm from the bottom up and the inside out. You’ll get all you need out of one sitting, but you’ll be back tomorrow for another taste. Like barrel-aged whiskey or fine red wine...leather boots or your favorite jeans.

Her childhood was scored with classic jazz, because her mother kept selections from the tradition on the family turntable. Though singing was a part of her childhood, Aimée first began singing professionally with jazz a cappella groups in college. After graduation, Aimée (pronounced “em-ay” or “M-A”) moved to Paris where she performed regularly in jazz clubs and festivals. The deep relationship between the francophone audiences and Brazilian bossa nova, led Aimée to form Les Bossa Novices, a Paris-based group dedicated to bossa and jazz.\n\nAimée now performs regularly in New York City and frequently tours abroad. Standards and bossa are part of her repertoire, but now an accomplished composer, she also sings her original songs, many of which have become audience favorites. Her original music has been licensed for feature film and network television. She has sung with many renowned jazz musicians including Romero Lubambo, Ron McClure, François Moutin, Roswell Rudd, Ari Hoenig, Joel Frahm, and Yomo Toro. She has also conducted student workshops on songwriting and jazz performance.\n\nReview from The Jazz Word\n\nAimée Allen is a vocalist and songwriter who has been turning many heads in recent years as she grows her substantial creative album catalog. Allen’s latest release, Love & the Catalyst, presents her refined original modern jazz music along with innovative arrangements of selections from the jazz cannon. Allen’s original music is intense musically and compelling lyrically. Her lyric themes include the wisdom of change and the catalytic agents that bring it about. Transformation, large and small, personal and collective, social and scientific. Allen will delight listeners in her lyrics about the alchemy of romance explored through the surprisingly sensual metaphors of science and the cosmos. This social conscience songwriter is a Nominee for the 54th Annual NACCP Outstanding Jazz Album – Vocal category.\n\nTickets at Aimée Allen Jazz Quartet\n\nView Event →\n\nOakland Samba Revue featuring Marcos Silva\n\nOakland Samba Revue is the San Francisco Bay Area’s premiere banda de gafieira.

This is a high spirited cross-cultural meeting of veteran performers from West Africa and America. Together, they weave West African hunters harp, fingerstyle guitar, drums, vocals, and a bounty of improvisation into an ecstatic groove-based dialogue which the heart - and the feet - cannot resist.\n\nMaster kamale ngoni player Mamadou Sidibe is a storied and award-winning West African musician, and a contagious joy. Thirty years ago in Mali, he was the first to break with tradition and take the ancient hunters harp outside the hunters' ceremonies, creating the now widely popular kamale ngoni. He frequently collaborates with West African superstar Oumou Sangare, with whom he recently wrote and recorded the internationally acclaimed CD “Timbuktu”. Mamadou has performed throughout Europe and the US with Malian stars like Coumba Sidibe and Toumani Diabate, and has recorded with American producer Rick Rubin.\n\nGuitarist Walter Strauss' playing is held in high regard in varied corners of the musical world. The great Malian kora player Toumani Diabate calls Walter’s guitar renditions of kora music “inspirational”. British guitar icon Martin Simpson says his playing is “beautiful, fluid, and sophisticated”. His guitar is a rich blend of texture and syncopation, influenced by diverse global stringed instruments, both contemporary and ancient. Walter has collaborated in the US with Grammy-winning Malian kora player Mamadou Diabate, in Havana with violinist Tanmy Lopez Moreno and in Scotland with Old Blind Dogs fiddler Jonny Hardie.\n\nFula Brothers are elevated by the nimble grooves of ace drummer / percussionist Brian Rice - a veteran of multiple styles, known especially for his work in Brazilian and Cuban music. He has been percussionist for numerous touring Brazilian artists, soloist for Felipe Senna’s concerto for pandeiro and orchestra, and percussionist for the Bay Area’s own Wake the Dead. Brian has performed internationally, and at US venues like Lincoln Center, Kennedy Center, and NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts.\n\nTickets at Fula Brothers\n\nView Event →\n\nJules Leyhe & The Family Jules Blues Blowout with Jefferson Bergey\n\nJoin us for our monthly Blues Blowout. You won't want to miss these!\n\nJules Leyhe might look like your everyday, average, unassuming guy, but he’s one of the world’s foremost blues slide-guitar players—so much so that even Premier Guitar magazine called his music “the best blues slide licks since Derek Trucks, maybe even Duane Allman.” Those might sound like some big boots, but this Oakland native not only fills them, he wears them out and has to order new ones. This year, he is showcasing a new blues series at the Sound Room, where Leyhe and his Family Jules Blues Blowout will be joined by local blues players from around the Bay each month. This month, they’re joined by guitarist and vocalist Jefferson Bergey.\n\nOakland based, Chicago native Jefferson Bergey leads a musically schizophrenic life. As a solo act, he has over 500 covers in his arsenal spanning the last 75 years of popular music. He’s musically promiscuous and considers himself genre-fluid which is why you may have seen him at Bawdy Storytelling, Allman Brothers Tribute: Freestone Peaches, Lucky Devils Band, or a Monday night at Scopo Divino. He also teaches privately through his own studio, is a virtual game show host for WEVE.co. , and is the namesake of the Bergey Burger, winner of 48hills’ ‘Best of the Bay’ 2020/2021.\n\nTickets at Blues Blowout\n\nView Event →\n\nBirth of the Cool Reimagined: Miles Davis Tribute\n\nAdam Theis and Jazz Mafia take a completely new look at this legendary 1950s album from a 2024 perspective.

With more than three decades of touring and fourteen previous albums, master blues guitarist and vocalist Chris Cain has earned his reputation as a musician’s musician. Since his first release in 1987, Cain has created his very own blues sound inspired by his heroes—B.B. King, Albert King, Ray Charles, Albert Collins, Grant Green and Wes Montgomery. His jazz-informed blues guitar playing is fiery, emotional and always unpredictable. His vocals—gruff, lived-in and powerful—add fuel to the fire. His indelible original songs keep one foot in the blues tradition and both eyes on the future. The pure joy Cain brings to his playing and singing is palpable, and draws fans even closer in.\n\n\"Hands down my favorite blues player on the scene today. He’s an absolute blinder of a guitarist, with the voice of B.B. King and the chops of Albert King.\" –Joe Bonamassa\n\n\"Chris Cain? Now that boy can PLAY the guitar!\" –B.B. King\n\n\"Chris Cain is a hot-shot guitarist and a singer with the maturity of blues masters like Bobby Bland and B.B. King.\" –The Washington Post\n\nTake some influence from B.B. King, Albert King, Ray Charles, and a pinch of Albert Collins.

It all adds up to the one and only Chris Cain, who has gone from being a newcomer phenomenon bursting onto the blues scene in 1987 with a classic debut release, to being a legend, inspiration and long-established member of the blues pantheon.\n\nTickets at The Chris Cain Band\n\nView Event →\n\nRebecca Kleinmann Quintet with music from Brazil to Venezuela\n\nRebecca Kleinmann, internationally acclaimed flutist and singer returns to the Bay Area to lead a night of Venezuelan music with master musicians Zack Pitt-Smith, winds; Carlos Caminos, guitar; Bil Hager, bass; and Marlon Aldana, percussion\n\nBased in California until 2022, Rebecca Kleinmann has led her Quintet in various formations since 2001, touring internationally with this and other projects to Brazil, Australia, Europe, Africa and within the US.

In addition, she has studied vocal performance with Fabiana Cozza and Jennifer Barnes. Her varied experiences as a vocalist include performances with the Taylor Memorial Gospel Choir and teaching vocal performance to thousands of elementary school children as an Orff-certified music educator in public schools. Both in teaching and in performances with the RKQ, Rebecca often utilizes her fluencies in Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nIn early 2022 Rebecca moved from Oakland to Durham, North Carolina and immediately began planting seeds to continue her musical career on the East Coast. Since the time of her last California concert in 2023, she has become a professor at UNC Chapel Hill, directing the university's \"Charanga Carolina\" ensemble, recorded and performed with Grammy winning pianist Taylor Eigsti, and received a Chamber Music America grant to fund her next album.
