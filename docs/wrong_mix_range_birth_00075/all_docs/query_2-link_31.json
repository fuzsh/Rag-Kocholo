        "text": "I'd like to say that I grew up listening to big band music…\n\n…but, as a kid in Gary, Indiana, like most kids my age, I got caught up in the R&B scene. My hometown heroes were the Jackson 5 and Motown. I first started singing in college, where I was introduced to Joni Mitchell, Carole King, and Joan Baez.\n\nWell, to be honest, I first started singing in the shower (in college). But someone overheard me and encouraged me to sing with the campus church choir.\n\nSparking an unexpected journey, I completed my undergraduate degree and simultaneously advanced my training as a singer.\n\nInspired by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Anita O'Day, and Carmen McRae\n\nIt was an invitation (almost 20-years ago) to audition for and then join Beasley's Big Band that gifted me with friendship and mentoring from jazz artists who were there as jazz took shape. I’ve been with this 18-piece jazz band for more than 18-years. During my days in the corporate world, that meant I was prioritizing my workload and travel to ensure I could make all performances. Singing was the creative balance I needed. And I couldn’t help but marvel at how incredibly blessed I was during each performance. As it is for many artists, arriving at today has been a journey.\n\nCourt's In Session was founded in 2009 to honor three of the senior members of Beasley's Big Band (BBB) Ruben Haugen (saxophone/clarinet), Roger Bartlett (trombone and upright bass), and Mel Carter Sr. (trumpet) who served as mentors and teachers to anyone willing to be under their tutelage.\n\nI watch as the music I was gifted, gifts others.\n\nI am filled with joy when children come right up to the stage, eyes wide and dance their little hearts out. I am humbled when newlyweds start dancing while we are playing a ballad during their cocktail hour. My heart is so touched when a couple who have been together for decades can't help but dance when we play their favorite song. And I love seeing people simply relax with loved ones and friends while we play in the background.\n\nI regularly sing with small and large bands, orchestras and ensembles from across the Twin Cities.\n\nAs Creative Director and lead vocalist for the jazz ensemble Court's In Session, I have the honor of leading an experienced group of Twin Cities musicians, bringing Jazz to Events, Fundraisers, Special Occasions, Corporate Events, Concerts, Weddings, Reunions and more.\n\nWe perform in several configurations, from solo piano to 5 pieces being our preferred option. Our mission is to keep this uniquely American art form alive and relevant by enhancing private and public events, including galas, charity events, conventions, and special occasions through the joy music creates.\n\nIn my free-time, I love hanging out with my family and friends."
