        "text": "How long have you worshiped at Saint Philip’s?\n\nAbout 20 years.\n\nHow’d you find your way to the church?\n\nIn 2001, I was on sabbatical from Washington State University while my wife, Yvonne, was doing a pharmacy residency at University Medical Center. Our daughters were young—in kindergarten and third grade—and we wanted them to be part of a faith community. As a child I attended Trinity Cathedral in Phoenix for a brief time and the memory of that prompted me to visit Saint Philip’s. We liked the people and the environment so we enrolled the girls in the children’s program and Yvonne and I attended services.\n\nWe returned to Washington state after a year but when we returned to Tucson in 2004 I also returned to Saint Philip’s.\n\nWhich service do you typically attend?\n\nThe 9:00am service.\n\nWere you raised in a faith tradition?\n\nNot really. My mother was agnostic. My father identified as Christian but he never attended church for any length of time. My experience at Trinity Cathedral in Phoenix was for a brief period shortly after my parents divorced. My mother was a single parent then and I think she wanted to create some structure for my brother and me.\n\nWhat about Saint Philip’s appeals to you?\n\nI like the people and the ritual of the liturgy.\n\nThe people I’ve met at Saint Philip’s are wonderful. And seeing them be of service in an effort to improve our community gives me hope for our greater society.\n\nI love the hymns we sing. And reciting prayers that go back multiple centuries is pretty profound. Knowing that we come together now and repeat a ritual that is centuries old has real impact on me. It helps me forget the craziness of the world.\n\nHow are you involved in the parish?\n\nI’m on an usher team for the 9 o’clock service, and also serve on the Buildings & Grounds Committee. I was on the Vestry when the parish hired Fr Robert.\n\nYou’re busy professionally. What inspires you to volunteer?\n\nTime is a very precious commodity for me but I am honored when asked to serve. When I can, I say, “yes.” I’m part of the community and participating in it is important.\n\nHas being part of Saint Philip’s supported your relationship with God?\n\nI was once asked when I found Jesus. I admitted that I haven’t found Jesus…yet. The fact that I’m still looking—that I’m still on a journey—is in large part because of Saint Philip’s. The community here maintains my desire to keep searching.\n\nChurches are part of the social fabric that keeps communities together. Which church someone attends isn’t that important. What is important is going to church and belonging to a faith community.\n\nWhat do you do professionally?\n\nMy degree is in Geosciences and these days I mainly do consulting work. I apply my earth sciences degree to help archeologists with their investigations of buried sites. Just yesterday I spent six hours in a deep trench looking at dirt. I’m also an adjunct lecturer at the University of Arizona.\n\nWhat about this subject do you find compelling?\n\nI love that I get to help solve parts of bigger mysteries from the past. Every discovery adds a little bit more to the greater story. And that, in turn, helps us understand our past. If we understand our past, then we can better know who we are now. That’s a big picture reason.\n\nA more practical reason is that I can help people. One of my specialities is studying indigenous water features such as prehistoric reservoirs and canals. Such information can be helpful to tribal communities. For example, I helped the people of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico identify and confirm some of their ancient water features. The results were used to support their claims in a water rights case.\n\nMy area of expertise isn’t the most lucrative—oil and gas or minerals might have made me richer. But I find natural and cultural history so interesting and solving mysteries of the past so fun that I’m very happy and satisfied with my choice of career.\n\nWhat are some of your guiding principles?\n\nFamily and friends are more important than any material possessions. Try to make the earth a better place. Be kind.\n\nWhat’s one of your super powers?\n\nI’m a pretty good teacher in the field. I love taking students outdoors.\n\nWhat makes you a good teacher?\n\nIt’s not enough to know your subject. I think I’m good at knowing my audience and presenting the material in a way that’s relevant. For example, how I present information to a young student in college is different than if I’m teaching a retired adult who is interested in continuing education. The constant, though, is that I’m excited about the subject. That carries over naturally and hopefully sparks an interest in the listener.\n\nGeological history can be boring and dry. But if taught right it’s a fascinating and relevant subject.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you?\n\nI had a brush with greatness when I shared an elevator with Ella Fitzgerald!\n\nI was ten years old and we met in the elevator at the Fairmount Hotel in San Francisco. She was heading to the penthouse restaurant to perform. I had seen a sign about her in the hotel lobby so I had a sense that she was “somebody.” But I had no idea just how big a star she was.\n\nWhat do you do for fun?\n\nI love to be outdoors—mountain biking and hiking. We have a family cabin outside Prescott and that’s our escape.\n\nWhat is something you are proud of?\n\nMy family. All the academic stuff is nice but family and friends are much more important than career and profession.\n\nI’m proud of my two daughters—who they are, the values they hold, and their ethical and moral compasses."
