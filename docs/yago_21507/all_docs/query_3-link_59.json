        "text": "From the August 1967 issue of Esquire..\n\nI was standing on the U.C.L.A. campus, under a sailboat sky, not far from a psychedelicatessen which sells everything from avocado hand cream to Ravi Shankar records, asking college students what they thought of Warren Beatty. Nearby a stunning girl in a leopardskin balaclava helmet was intensely involved in watching the ritual of a campus maintenance man scrubbing the side of a building on which someone had written JESUS WASN'T DRAFTED with green paint. \"What do you think of Warren Beatty?\" I asked. \"Who's that? I never heard of him,\" she said crisply and walked away so fast her spray net crackled in the sunlight.\n\nNext, came a young man with a large button on his car coat proclaiming ORGASMS FOR SALE OR TRADE. \"Oh, yeah. Isn't he the one who used to run around with Natalie Wood? Naw, naw, I never saw any of his movies, but I sure wouldn't mind getting together with Natalie Wood. . . .\"\n\nAnd so on. \"That slug,\" said an Indian girl carrying a small telescope. \"Warren Beatty! G'wan, you're putting me on,\" said a geology student with a slide rule hanging from his belt. \"What are you—some nut from Candid Camera?\" On the fifth try, a Tuesday Weld-type in a Rudi Gernreich mini-coat scratched the knee of her Bonnie Doon panty stockings, applied a fresh coat of pomegranate lipstick, and replied: \"Sure, isn't he the one—let's see—who got arrested not long ago for beating his dog?\" \"That was Tab Hunter.\" \"Well, I mean, same difference.\"\n\nAnd that's what happens when you ask the public. Back in New York, I had skipped the public and asked Those Who Know, and from them I heard that Warren was a draft dodger, a Communist, that he had two illegitimate children living in London, that he had been arrested three times by the Los Angeles vice squad, that he was a sadist who loved to invite ten girls to his hotel room at one time and not show up, that he wore black leather pants and carried a whip when he was not working, and that \"at least fifty women were seduced by him,\" as one man swore. Above all I learned that Those Who Know knew everything but the truth.\n\nThe Truth—as I came to find out—is that nobody knows very much at all about Warren Beatty, including Warren himself. Other than the fact that he had never appeared able to make complete sentences, his old interviews—during the period when he was the hottest thing since Dr Pepper—turned up nothing.\n\nHow would you describe yourself, Warren?\n\n\"Sloppy. That's how I'd describe myself. Sloppy.\"\n\nWhat do you look for in a role?\n\n\"For instance, if I started working. . . . And some of the questions I don't have answers to. . . . Something hits me, it hits me. ... I read something and I say, Oh, I know that moment. You never know what it is you really look for . . . it's like . . . but . . . you a . . . dum . . . generally speaking (he spits something out of his mouth) ... I would think. . . .\"\n\nLike that. Another look at his films—eight of them in seven years —proved that he was not untalented. Three, in fact—Splendor in the Grass, All Fall Down and Mickey One—showed that he just might be one of the few young actors in films who have more on the ball than a forty-six-inch chest. Still, Warren's relatively brief fling at trampling out the vintage where all those Hollywood grapes of wrath are stored has earned him a reputation for being the most enfant of the enfants terribles since Baby LeRoy hit W.C. Fields over the head with a bottle. Most actors despise him for his unconventional behavior on movie sets (people who worked on Lilith still talk about the way he used to pick his nose and fling the contents at Jean Seberg when it was her turn to face the camera). The women in his life—-perhaps the only people to know him well— refuse to talk. Once, in a New Orleans hotel room, I asked Natalie Wood about him and she walked out of the room. His directors? Except for Arthur Penn, no director has worked with him twice.\n\nWarren's every waking hour is spent trying to convince people he is a responsible guy. His major interest in life today is to change that old image.\n\nAnd yet. . . and yet. Warren's every waking hour is spent trying to convince people he is a responsible guy. His major interest in life today is to change that old image. He has just produced a film in Texas called Bonnie and Clyde, about Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, who conducted a crime spree through the Southwest in the Thirties. Warren financed the project, with aid from Warner Brothers, and press releases out of Hollywood these days proclaim \"Warren's grown up.\"\n\n\"Denise Minnelli threw a party at the Bistro last month and Warren didn't even go! He's really changed!\" That, from a friend. And from Warren: \"Now that I am in my late twenties, I find there are other things in life than just having a ball.\"\n\nEstelle Parsons, an actress in Bonnie and Clyde, says, \"He had a great respect for the other actors, he ran everything himself, made all the decisions, contributed very important comments, and we all got paid on time. It's a game out there in Hollywood. The people who make the crazy demands and do the bizarre things are the ones who don't get kicked around. Maybe that's what Warren had to do in the beginning to get ahead.\" Diana Michaelis, who works for V.I.S.T.A.—a volunteer arm of the War Against Poverty—phoned from Washington to tell me she thinks so much of Warren she has asked him to make a recruiting pitch to the young people of America to stir up interest in national welfare. \"He went out and talked to our volunteers on the edge of the Watts area and we found him to be a very genuine person sensitive to the problems of the times. Besides, in America people are much more likely to listen to a celebrity.\"\n\nAt the King Cole Bar I talked to Robert Benton and David Newman, two men good and true, who wrote the script for Bonnie and Clyde. \"You won't get Warren's story in an interview. It's all movement, motion, girls. He drives up and down the Sunset Strip with one hand on the wheel, waving at everybody. He's very now, with his own vocabulary, his own way of doing things. He was a terrificproducer. We went into a meeting at Warner's and Warren said, 'This is what they're gonna ask, this is what we're gonna say,' and he was right. He's a great wheeler-dealer. Get him in a car. One time we were looking over locations in some little town in Texas—they all look alike—and some girl spotted him. 'Hey, mister, you Warren Beatty?' she said, backing up four times in an old Buick. Warren did ten minutes of shtick.\"\n\nThen they described a scene, typical of the kind of thing that happens every day to Warren the Hipster:\n\nThey are stopped for a red light. Warren is hanging out of the window. \"Hey, man,\" says a man in the next car.\n\n\"Hey, man,\" says Warren.\n\n\"What's happenin'?\"\n\n\"Nothin' much happenin'.\"\n\n\"Hey, my place, man. Eight o'clock. A freaky scene.\"\n\n\"What kinda freaky scene?\"\n\n\"A few girls, man. Real freaky.\"\n\n\"Well, it wouldn't be much fun without at least eight girls, man.\"\n\n\"Oh. Okay. Later, man.\"\n\n\"Later.\"\n\n\"Who was that character,\" asks Newman.\n\n\"I never saw him before in my life,\" says Warren, giggling and stepping on the gas.\n\nThe best evaluation came from a famous actress who appeared with Warren in a film. Over cheeseburgers at The Ginger Man she whispered confidentially: \"Warren is really two people. You see him on the screen and that's one thing. He's no actor and never has been. His working habits are unorthodox and difficult to understand, but that's mainly because he doesn't know what he's doing. He has always gotten by on the screen by faking it. It's almost as though the moon has to be in just the right quarter and the winds have to blow just the right number of miles per hour from the East before he can even function. The other side of Warren is more interesting. He can be youthful, charming, debonair. Every eye at the table is on him. He is musical—plays wonderful piano—and he's very interesting when he isn't hung up acting. But of course this is the side he has never shown to any writer to my knowledge. He is always too busy playing roles. That seems to be necessary to his own kind of survival. So I think it would be impossible to write about him, because you will never see what he's really like. You will only see all the roles he wants you to see him play.\"\n\nThe Hollywood sun rose like a big pink seedless grapefruit over the date palm trees out by the Beverly Wilshire pool. I was up early, waiting for a call from Guy McElwaine, Warren's Hollywood press agent. Warren has gone through just about every press agent on the West Coast (\"He's something of a kook, that boy,\" says one), finally settled on McElwaine, who has promised to phone at ten a.m. I sat around the hotel, sharpened my pencil, and got my questions ready for Warren.\n\nAt eleven, McElwaine phoned. \"Meet me for lunch at the Brown Derby in one hour,\" he said briskly. The beginning. Will the real Warren Beatty stand up and sign in, please. \"Will Warren be there?\" I asked. \"Your parrrty is disssconnnected,\" purred the operator.\n\nTwo hours and several Bloody Marys later, McElwaine sauntered elegantly into the Beverly Hills Brown Derby, called \"the Veda Ann Borg of restaurants\" by people who know it well. McElwaine settles into the booth and orders a chopped sirloin steak. \"No French fries,\" he says, fondling a waistline that is threatening to get out of hand. \"You don't look so tough,\" he says, peering over his wraparound sunglasses.\n\nGuy McElwaine sounds like the inscription on a tombstone in the King of Cornwall's graveyard at Tintagel. Actually he is a boyish, thirty-one-year-old ex-ballplayer who has been blasted by almost every writer in Hollywood for protecting his clients from exposure to the indignity of the printed page. (Mention almost any writer of any reputation and he'll sneer, \"Yeah, he took a swipe at me in print.\") A swinger. Checked tweeds, striped pink shirts, paisley ties, a regular face at The Daisy. It is clear almost instantly (and from the way he later nudges up to Warren) that he is quite confused about his own relation to the stars he handles. As one of his acquaintances says, \"He wants so badly to be a celebrity himself that he goes around drenched in cologne, wearing loud clothes and living in the spotlights of his clients. He has a pretty tough ego to feed.\" There are two kinds of press agents—the no-nonsense guys who expose their clients to the proper media because that is what they get paid for, and the professional hand holders. McElwaine fits into the second category. Warren needs him. Like most of the young successes in show business, Warren is smart enough and rich enough to get anything he wants, but he's not stable enough yet to provide his own built-in reassurance.\n\nMcElwaine talks a lot about his current wife, Pamela Austin, and loves to tell how she made $100,000 last year for a few days' work. She's the petunia-eyed blonde who nearly drove the World Series off the air by announcing repeatedly, at disturbingly regular intervals, \"The Dodge Rebellion wants yeeewww!\"\n\nThere is still no sign of Warren. Will he show up for lunch? McElwaine's conversation avoids any pinning down of exact times and dates, but there is a casual mention of, \"Well, I guess we'd better try to get some kind of schedule going between you and Warren.\" Mostly it's just peppered and salted with exclamations like, \"Who needs writers? All they want to do is make movie stars look like asses!\" And \"Richard Warren Lewis can't get a job in Hollywood because of all those vicious pieces he writes for TV Guide.\" And \"Joe Hyams is another writer who has nothing but contempt for Hollywood press agents.\" And \"Bill Davidson used to be very good, but he can't get people to see him anymore.\" Etc. Putting on the scare. But never quite making it, because with each new horror story about each new big-name writer he doesn't like, it becomes increasingly more obvious that what he's really afraid of is a hatchet job on Warren Beatty.\n\n\"I have the names of a group of people here who told me not to let you do this story at all,\" he said suddenly in his best Edward G. Robinson imitation, pulling out of his vest pocket a crumpled piece of memo paper. \"Whaddya think of that?\" I told him I didn't think much about his list and when could I see Warren?\n\n\"I wouldn't blame you if you went back to New York and sued us for a million dollars and you'd probably win the case,\" he said. I told him I didn't come three thousand miles to sue anybody and when could I see Warren?\n\nHe started to grin, realizing the corniness of the situation. \"There's nothing you could write about him anyway that could harm him professionally. He could walk down the street naked and it wouldn't hurt him. Did you know he's the Number-one film star in Cambodia? In Iran they released three of his films in one week—a regular Warren Beatty film festival.\" I asked if it would be possible to maybe follow Warren around for a few days, see him in action. McElwaine blanched. \"Probably not. That's up to Warren. You have to win his confidence first.\" I asked him what he could tell me about Warren. What time does he wake up? \"Whenever I call him. Sometime in the afternoon, usually. Listen, I know there are a lot of people in this business who don't like Warren, but that's because a lot of people want to be like him. They're jealous. Hell, he's good-looking, he's successful, he could have just about any woman he wants in the whole world. He knows everybody. All the foreign directors like him. Truffaut. Karel Reisz wants to do a film with him. He's very intelligent. He has total recall. He can remember every phone number of mine for years. And women! He can look at a girl and say, 'Her number is Oleander---and she used to have a London exchange that was GROsvenor----. Fantastic! Let's go see Nancy Sinatra.\"\n\nWe're heading out Santa Monica Boulevard in McElwaine's '67 chocolate-colored Mercedes-Benz convertible toward PJ's where Nancy Sinatra (another client) is rehearsing a rock-and-roll act to take to Vietnam and I'm wondering what Nancy Sinatra has to do with Warren Beatty, and McElwaine is answering: \"Why don't you do a story on Nancy?\" He plunges through the traffic, pushing his sunglasses up on his nose, telling wild inside stories about Hollywood, all prefaced with, \"This is not for publication, but. . . .\"\n\nPJ's swarmed with rock-and-rollers. McElwaine hugged Nancy Sinatra. Nancy hugged McElwaine. They both wore dark glasses. He produced the cover of her new album, which showed her in a pale bikini photographed, in a Roger Vadim effect, by a camera that looked like it had Vaseline smeared across the lens. \"I hear we sold twenty-thousand copies already on the cover alone.\" Nancy blushed and went on with her song. . . . (\"Shh-Shh-Shhugar Town . . .\") And that's how we frittered away the afternoon, consumed in a roar of over-amplified dissonance. The beat. Gets ya where ya live. The incrowd. \"Is Warren coming here?\" I asked over the noise. \"Warren's meeting us for drinks later,\" was the reply. \"Why don't you do a story on Nancy?\"\n\nBack in the safety of pink sunlight, bouncing off the windshields of all the Hollywood sports cars like sequins, we headed for McElwaine's office. \"That's Nancy's fiancé,\" said McElwaine, driving past a photographer pulling into the parking lot at PJ's. \"Does her father ever say anything about her life?\" I asked. \"Only when he's asked, otherwise Frank stays out of it. Listen, this is no kid. She's been married and divorced once. She's a grown woman!\" It still didn't seem like a very good reason to do a story.\n\nBack at McElwaine's office (pink everything, with teeny-boppers to answer the phone and plastic plants and a super-intercom system which allows everyone in the office to listen in on calls whenever he flips a switch), he handed me a book by Roddy McDowall. \"Why don't you do a story on Roddy?\" Finally, after leafing through six magazines, all featuring stories on his clients, I was told Warren was on the phone. \"Yes, Warren, he's here now.\" Cupping his hand over the receiver: \"Warren wants to know if everything's okay. He has lots of contacts at the hotel and he can get you anything you need.\"\n\n\"Ask him when I can see him,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, sure, everything's fine. I'll talk to you later,\" he said, hanging up. \"Well, I gotta get some work done.\"\n\nHe promised to phone me at five o'clock for cocktails with the star. One of the teeny-boppers drove me back to the hotel, with a running narrative on her life and a complete rundown on her qualifications for pictures. At eight p.m. I dialed McElwaine. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I was just going to call you. Warren can't make it; he's tied up at the studio. I'll phone you first thing in the morning.\"\n\nAt three p.m. on my third day in California, the call came through, like a voice singing hosannas from on high: \"Warren will see you now.\"\n\nAn orange sun was collapsing under the weight of a sky full of smog as the car pulled through the gates at Warner Brothers. The studio in late afternoon looked like an old deserted air base I lived near as a small child ; the hangars had long since been closed down, the aircraft dismantled and hauled away for scrap, and all that was left were memories for the calendar to smirk at. Production was crawling. The sound stages—where Bette Davis went blind in the flower beds, where Bogart fired at endless hoodlums in Chicago alleys, where Doris Day pinched S.Z. Sakall's cheeks into colorless hamburger and Joan Crawford had once slapped the faces of countless admirers on her way to the governor's mansion—were inactive and closed to the public. Warehouses filled with Busby Berkeley tap shoes and Cary Grant drawing rooms—padlocked. In one of the labs Bonnie and Clyde was in the editing stage and somewhere, behind those massive bolted doors down one of those concrete alleys, Camelot was shooting. Otherwise, a fine pink dust settled crazily over the lot and the ear was assaulted by the sound of silence.\n\nWarren was in his office—a tiny pink room at the end of an empty corridor in a tiny pink stucco building that looked like a temporary wartime army hut for training-center personnel. He was sitting on top of his desk, talking animatedly on the phone to a music publisher about the score for Bonnie and Clyde. \"Let's go with a hillbilly sound. No, I do not want bossa nova.\" He was playing the role of busy executive, with McElwaine beaming nearby, but there was something wrong with the scene: he was wearing a wrinkled white shirt with two buttons missing, so that his navel showed, and across his face was a cut, where he had slashed himself shaving.\n\nWhen he looks he stares and when he talks he does so in a voice which is not immaculately precise, like most movie stars who dabble a bit in phonetics, but rather slow and cumbersome, wrapping his vowels around his tongue like bacon around a fork.\n\nUp close, without the makeup and the lights, he looks like the well-bred right guard on some winning high-school football team; one of the guys from the right side of town hanging around with the moths on a lightning bug-sticky small-town evening in summer: sea-spray eyes, slanted like pecans, constantly squinting because he is nearsighted and too vain to wear his glasses when he first meets strangers, footsteps shuffling and slightly unsure, hair healthy and unruly, hands trim, fingers long—not masculine-accepted stubby, but rather delicate and sensitive, like a pianist's (which he once was). When he looks he stares and when he talks he does so in a voice which is not immaculately precise, like most movie stars who dabble a bit in phonetics, but rather slow and cumbersome, wrapping his vowels around his tongue like bacon around a fork. Warren, in fact, does not look or sound like a star. It is not until later, when you have known him, that you begin to notice the desperation to be liked, approved of, the fear (the greatest terror of his life, to be exact) of being considered unintelligent. At least four or five times during our talks, he would turn to me defiantly and say, as if in self-assurance, \"I am intelligent; I know I am intelligent.\"\n\nHe led the way, past crumbling, vine-covered tennis courts once used by Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler, now sorry reminders of the past, with cracks in their floors, down palm-lined walks where Judy Garland had cavorted as Mrs. Norman Maine in A Star is Born, across parking spaces marked \"Reserved—for Richard Harris\" or \"Reserved—for Jack Warner,\" to his dressing room. He slammed the door. \"Now-uh, let's see,\" he stammered, trying to be polite, still not trusting me. \"There is, far as I can see, no reason to do a story on me. Most of what I have to say you couldn't print anyway. Most movie stars are not interesting, so to sell papers and magazines in the fading publications field a writer has to end up writing his ass off to make somebody look more interesting than he really is, right? What it all boils down to is publicity because somebody's got some movie to sell, right? What do I need with publicity? You want to see me driving up and down the Sunset Strip in my car picking up girls, right? Well, you don't think I'd be stupid enough to let you see that side of me, do you?\"\n\n\"Gay Talese came out here and got hot under the collar because it took him three weeks to see Frank Sinatra,\" McElwaine echoed.\n\n\"Hell, Mia Farrow doesn't even see Sinatra until the lights go out.\"\n\n\"You've got a reputation for being an enfant terrible,\" snarled Warren. \"Let me give you some advice. If you're gonna knock the Establishment, don't make any mistakes. I know, because I used to be an enfant terrible myself. You write a story mentioning Natalie Wood's hairdresser and it turns out he was really her makeup man. People don't like that sort of thing.\"\n\nThese boys play a pretty mean game of war, I told myself. Three days under the coconut trees and I was already getting my third lecture—in fractured French—and I hadn't even done the interview. I listened to about an hour of diatribes against various \"goddam writers,\" including a juicy description of one who should have his \"ass filled with buckshot\" for writing a story which made Joshua Logan sound effete and another particularly boring attack on the old standbys—the McGuire Sisters of journalism—Richard Warren Lewis, Joe Hyams and Bill Davidson. \"Joe Hyams used to write a bitchy article putting down every blonde starlet who set foot in Hollywood and he ended up marrying one,\" said Warren, who had once been treated to one of Hyams' ace profiles. Warren leaped to his feet, remembering a doctor's appointment.\n\nWe drove back to Beverly Hills in his panther-like black Continental with black leather upholstery. Why not a Jag or even a Firebird with a regular gas overhead cam six? \"I like big cars, it's as simple as that.\" He rents them in whatever city he happens to be in, turns them in when the ashtrays get full. We avoided the freeways, stuck to the boulevards. Warren was careful not to answer any questions, since McElwaine had gone to great lengths to insure the use of a tape recorder, which he insisted he would supply. Warren ripped through the traffic, like a professional cabdriver, his face clouded with surly pain. A beautiful girl with skin the color of buttered cocoa pulled alongside the car in a confetti-colored sports car. Nobody said anything. The two drivers just looked at each other and grinned. That was the first glimpse of something I had heard about, and would see again: the Beatty charm, quickly blossoming and just as quickly dismantled. (\"Warren wants the entire world to want to go to bed with him,\" a friend of his told me earlier. \"And what he really is unable to take more than anything else in life is rejection.\") The girl in the other car knew him. She flashed her teeth in a Gardol glow. \"Warren, can I pass you?\"\n\nShe did. \"That would be one of the most beautiful girls in Hollywood, but she's carrying the weight of the entire civil-rights movement on her shoulders,\" said Warren. Then he went back into his Charlotte Brontë mood. I was losing him.\n\n\"You must know half the girls in Hollywood.\" I couldn't believe I had said it, but I was clutching at straws. \"That is such a stupid question I don't even know how to answer it,\" he sneered. He was right, but it produced a laugh from both of us and that, at the moment, seemed better than nothing.\n\nHe never did tell me why he was going to a doctor, but he was inside the clinic half an hour. I waited in the car. When he came out, he seemed cheerier and invited me up to his pad. We parked in the basement of the Beverly Wilshire and waited for the elevator. He was still harping on the hazards of the interview, concentrating with deadly precision on Barbara Walters of the Today show, who had recently called him one of the most impossible interviews of her career in front of millions of viewers on Johnny Carson's Tonight show. Warren seemed particularly insulted by her, blaming the failure of the interview on her questions, and was deep in some kind of analysis of female interviewers in general when an elderly lady in a uniform stepped off the service elevator.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said, beaming his wall-to-wall grin.\n\n\"Oh, hello,\" beamed the woman, who only a moment before had been doubled over in pain.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" asks Warren.\n\n\"Oh, so-so,\" she answers, remembering, rubbing her back.\n\n\"I'll have several shirts and some suits for you tomorrow,\" he says, flashing such a smile that the lady forgot all her aches and grinned girlishly back at him.\n\n\"That's the cleaning lady,\" he says, after she hobbled away. Charm. The boy's got it. (\"You should see him at a party,\" says a female friend of his. \"He can walk into a room full of people like Merle Oberon and Myrna Loy—you know, the older beauties—and be so debonair, so wolfish, he has them purring and eating out of his hand in minutes. He's like honey in a beehive.\")\n\nWarren lives on top of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Most of the suites there have Spanish names; Warren's is called La Escondida. It is only the size of a two-room New York apartment, with Pablum-colored decor and few closets, but it is considered the \"hotel penthouse,\" probably because it has one outstanding feature: a magnificent terrace with a CinemaScope view of Los Angeles that looks like the opening credits of A Star is Born. There is, before you see the terrace, an immediate sense of transitory impermanence about the pad: what looks like four days of room-service trays piled against the door, a week's phone messages crumpled on the floor and on the tops of bureaus, stacks of books (he was halfway through Kazan's The Arrangement). We step over a pile of LP's, movie scripts, unanswered mail with month-old postmarks, a typewriter, typing paper. \"I'm writing a movie, but I can't tell you about it yet. It's hard work—keeps me up till six a.m. Come on, I'll show you where I live.\"\n\nWe go out to the terrace, where Maya Plisetskaya reportedly sunbathes when she's in town from Russia, with its deck chairs, umbrellas and view of Mount Baldy in the distance. There is a building which looms above and hovers over this terrace, guarding it like a sentinel. It used to have a name but when the owners of the building moved their business, they took down the name and left just the word BUILDING. It makes Warren furious when anyone notices. Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, once visited his pad and, noticing the sign instantly, made a comment to the effect that only a capitalist society would find it necessary to remind the world that a building was a building. Warren has never quite forgiven him for that and when I remarked that I thought it quite funny he seemed doubly annoyed. \"These New York guys come to Hollywood and see all the lights and say, 'It's phony.' I hate to tell you but the cultural swing is to the West. I love Los Angeles—the temperance, the weather, the girls. I have no family, though, so I'm really a commuter, though. I have no family, no kids that necessitate my being in any one particular place for a very long period of time. Three years ago I had a big Hollywood house with two pools and a tennis court, but I gave it up. I only had it so when Leslie's kids were in town they'd have room to play.\"\n\n\"I can remember the way rooms smell, and anything of a sexual nature— all the sexual encounters in detail—and the phone numbers of people I knew five years ago. Ask me a phone number in New York.\"\n\nWe talk about the growth of Los Angeles. \"Nothing's old out here. You want old, go back to New York.\" Then he springs his memory game. \"I'm learning a lot about myself—like I have a photographic memory. Name me a dinner party I was at years ago and I can recite the menu, tell you what everything tasted like. I can remember the way rooms smell, and anything of a sexual nature— all the sexual encounters in detail—and the phone numbers of people I knew five years ago. Ask me a phone number in New York.\"\n\nThis was the part of the story called Gaining the Star's Confidence. \"What's Sardi's?\" I asked, playing along.\n\n\"LAckawanna 4-0707,\" he answered correctly. \"Now give me a number.\"\n\n\"CIrcle 6-1000.\" He thinks, cups his hands over his eyes. He doesn't know. \"Warner Brothers—your own studio,\" I tell him.\n\n\"Well, it always works better with people's numbers and it always fails when you're trying to show off. People are the things I care most about in life. One of the things that has begun to mean a great deal to me is to keep relationships with people fertilized and up-to-date. That's probably why I remember every phone number—because when it answers I know there'll be a person on the other end.\" He looked sad and a little lonely, like a rag doll thrown in a corner by a bored child. I went home, with a date to see him at eleven the next morning, convinced that Warren Beatty was one helluva misunderstood nice guy.\n\nThe next morning I phoned him to let him know I was on my way. He was asleep. \"What're you doing today?\" he asked, yawning, then dropping the phone. \"I'm supposed to be seeing you . . . the interview, remember?\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah? Well, let's see . . . Christ, what a night . . . there's not much ... you could if you wanted to ... come on up . . . we'll have lunch at two. Is that all right? You're sure. . . .\"\n\nInterviewing Warren is like asking a hemophiliac for a pint of blood. We sat out on the terrace with the palm trees blowing down below and the phonograph playing Kurt Weill music as loud as the volume would go. \"It's Morton Gould. Do you think that's square? Maybe I'm a square.\" The idea seemed to worry him. He was wearing the same wrinkled clothes from the night before and looked exhausted. By his own admission, he is a physical wreck. He gets very little rest, eats hot dogs and pizza and whatever happens to jangle his taste buds at the moment, and exists between spurts of exhaustion brought on by anxiety and tension. Mostly he is exhausted by boredom and he is almost always bored if he stays in one city, one room, one situation too long. Once, when he was telling me about an unknown actor he hired for Bonnie and Clyde, I asked if that was dangerous for box-office. \"The only thing that is dangerous,\" he said, looking me straight in the eye, \"is boredom. I want to get out and do things that are different—not sit around and dwell on my own excrement.\"\n\nThere were two tape recorders, a special requirement for the interview, a tiny Norelco that operated on cartridges and a larger Wollensak which had been borrowed from a girl friend. Warren puttered around a few minutes, shaking them, holding them up to his ear. They were both broken. \"Forget the tape recorder. I'll trust you.\" The day before he had seemed angry because I had once written about Natalie Wood eating eggs Benedict. \"I'd never let you catch me off guard like that,\" he said. Now he picked up the phone and called room service. \"Hello, room service? This is Warren Beatty. BEATTY! In the penthouse. I'd like some food. Two orders of eggs Benedict, please. Uh—let's see—listen—don't let this be a disaster, but I'm changing my mind. Make that one order of eggs Benedict and one Western omelet—and, dear, make the Western soft. You got that? Yeah, soft. Every time I order them they come hard and I am going to have to start sending them back.\"\n\n\"The only thing that is dangerous is boredom. I want to get out and do things that are different—not sit around and dwell on my own excrement.\"\n\nI asked him why he lived in hotels. \"I guess because it prevents stagnation, settling down. I get a certain amount of amusement out of knowing I can pack up and move tomorrow. I used to be fairly squirrel-like about keeping things but I've stopped that. I don't want things. I usually have a piano but I stopped that too, because when I have an anxiety I go to the piano and then I don't work out the anxieties on the other work I should be doing. I don't want houses or cars. I rent everything. I have four suits and a dinner jacket. The rest of my things are stored in warehouses. There have been other times when I've been deeply involved with a woman—if it was not what it should be, all creative impulses came to a standstill. That doesn't mean I won't get involved anymore, because you never know what you're gonna do, do you? I wouldn't want to think of myself as cautious, but I guess I am becoming more cautious. I think a very short relationship where you tell the truth to somebody is in many ways more satisfying than a longer relationship where truth becomes more painful.\"\n\nI asked him if, now that he had become a producer of films as well as an actor, he had fewer anxieties about life? \"Yes, but more anxieties about death. I'm afraid to die, aren't you?\" He was pacing, arms folded like Napoleon, occasionally reaching inside his shirt to scratch himself. \"Hey!\" he said suddenly, turning around and pointing at me. \"I didn't do any interviews during the movie and now I'm doing a few and it's sounding corny. Does that sound like I'm putting you down? One thing is sure—every time I talk to someone I say to myself after, 'Why did I pontificate like that?' I feel very foolish. It's a struggle to determine just why or if you should be interested in me, but you're here so I guess you are or somebody is or somebody wants to sell a movie. I don't know . . . it's all so trivial.\"\n\nI asked him if money was important. \"It's becoming less important. It's very important when you have a very small amount of it, but when you're comfortable, money ceases to be a remedy for much. For me, anyway. I don't know how sensible I am about currency. I don't even know how much I have. I trust the man who handles my money. On the other hand, when I was producing Bonnie and Clyde, it was important to know where the money went, what it went for. Money is chips. It's all tokens. I don't know what it's all about. One day a dollar is worth X, the next day it's worth Y.\"\n\nWarren was trying. He was really trying to give an intelligent interview, and he was saying all the things he considered important to escape the old cornball labels. \"Audiences don't give a damn about statistics. I don't give a damn. We're endowing our imaginary audience with the same tastes, same likes and dislikes we have ourselves. I get the feeling that even with the inflationary costs it's become an almost economic necessity in theatrical motion pictures as opposed to TV to move into unsafe areas statistically.\" I didn't have the slightest idea what he was talking about, but I was writing like heck. \"I want to do more comedies. I've only made two. I guess it's two. Was Kaleidoscope a comedy? I never knew what that picture was, not that you had to know what it was, because it was what it was.\"\n\nThe food arrived. Warren nearly burst into tears explaining to the Spanish waiter, who spoke no English, why he would have to send him back to the kitchen. \"The toast is not buttered and I . . . like . . . well . . . what can I do? What would you do? So you see . . . if I don't send you back you'll never learn anything . . . and that's why. . . .\" The waiter left, muttering something in Spanish. Warren devoured his omelet in seconds, then continued pacing, occasionally swooping down like an enormous sea gull to nibble on the uneaten portion of my cold eggs Benedict. \"Don't you eat these?\" he asked, pointing at the truffles on top. \"That's the best part,\" he said, swallowing them.\n\nIt seemed like a good time to ease him into a discussion of the past. He was born in Richmond, Virginia, in March, 1937. He grew up in a red brick Colonial house in Arlington, the son of Ira 0. Beaty (Warren later added an extra \"t\"), an educational psychology professor turned real-estate man, and Kathlyn MacLean Beaty, who taught acting. His sister Shirley (who later turned her mother's maiden name into MacLaine for professional use) was three years older and as children they used to dress up in top hats and parade around the house. (\"By the time he was five he was a wow imitating Boyer, then he went through a Milton Berle stage,\" says his Mom.) But Warren was no sissy. He was president of his class and a star center on the Washington and Lee High football team. At seventeen, he went from Arlington to Washington and got a job with the National Theatre as a rat watcher. \"The manager was a nice man who could see he had a kid here who loved the theatre. I asked for a job in the alley—doing anything. They were doing a revival of The Skin Of Our Teeth with Helen Hayes. There were several entrances through the alley, and since there had been an incident where a rat bit an actor, Equity required they hire someone to stand in the alley and make sure no more rats ran into the theatre. It probably relates to my behavior around the doors of studio executives now.\"\n\nHe graduated from high school to ten offers of football scholarships, but he turned them all down to study drama at Northwestern. I asked him if he ever wondered what his life would have been like if he had played college football. \"No. I haven't seriously given that more than [cupping his head in his hands, rubbing his eyes] twelve minutes thought. At first, the football field seemed a good place to do something. A guy actually became an all-American. He was big and he was tough.\" The story becomes very important to him. His eyes narrow. He sees it, like a scene from a movie. \"He was from Ohio. I rather liked him. One night I came home late to the freshman dorm and they said, 'So-and-so is really sick, got drunk tonight, and he's been asking for you. He vomited in the men's room.' 'How sick was he?' I asked. 'Go in and see.' I saw, for one second, a whole cabbage, a carrot, an unchewed lamb chop—I said, 'Man, I'm too sensitive for this! and I quit.\" Instead, he sang a song about an Indian in a varsity show and became a hot campus item with a pretty co-ed named Ellie Wood, who is now married to Robert Walker, Jr.\n\nWarren quit after a year and never went back to college. He counted his savings and went to New York, where he lived in a $24-a-month room on West Sixty-eighth Street, occasionally played the piano at night in a little place called Clavin's Bar—gone now—on East Fifty-eighth Street, and supplemented his income by working as a bricklayer's assistant, construction worker and sandhog on the third tube of the Lincoln Tunnel. He also studied acting with Stella Adler who \"equipped me with a certain amount of arrogance—arrogant self-confidence, I should say—which enabled me to bluff my way through a few sidescrapers.\" Most of the time, though, he lived on peanut butter, stalked girls on the streets of Manhattan and lay in bed with a case of hepatitis. I mentioned the hepatitis and he turned crimson. \"How did you know about that? What else do you know?\"\n\nSomewhere during this period—between Northwestern and his first break on Broadway—Warren had a serious rift with his family. Today he still refuses to discuss his parents or his sister Shirley, who by that time had already been discovered in Pajama Game and featured in an Alfred Hitchcock film. \"Did you communicate with them during this period?\" I asked. \"There's communication and there's communication,\" he replied, freezing up. Then, \"It's been traumatic for my mother and father to have raised two kids who have become successful in a way-out profession.\" And Shirley? \"I think I learned to talk to my sister later than anyone else. Little things build up—you build up a little head of steam—and pretty soon you have to go into a conference on disarmaments. Just in the last two years we've become able to communicate.\"\n\nWhen he recovered from the hepatitis, Warren landed a job in a religious early-morning TV show, which led to a part in a winter stock production of Compulsion in New Jersey. William Inge and Joshua Logan were in the audience. Zip! A star is born, etc. Logan wanted him instantly for Parrish (the part later went to Troy Donahue). Inge wanted him to play a stud in his play, A Loss of Roses. That was the beginning of Warren's reputation, less than enviable, for being difficult, arrogant, moody, hostile, uncooperative. From the beginning the show was plagued with troubles, not the least of which was Warren himself. Shirley Booth was the star and Warren was nobody, but as the rehearsals wore on it became obvious to everyone in the cast that Inge had made a mistake. Warren refused to cooperate with Director Daniel Mann. By this time he had met Joan Collins, the first in a long line of amours, and she was traveling with him, to the rest of the company's annoyance. He'd arrive twenty to thirty minutes late for rehearsals, hold up the cast in private directorial conferences, change the lines. Dennis Cooney, Warren's understudy, was kept on call to replace him on a moment's notice. Mann said, \"Warren won't listen to me, he's going to do nothing until opening night and then he'll play on the sex appeal and charm and all the crap and do something onstage we don't even know about.\"\n\nAccording to people who worked on the show, Mann wanted to fire Warren, but Inge defended him as merely an insecure actor who would be great in the part if given a chance. Gradually Warren began to take over the show while the leading lady's role shifted in perspective. At the end of the first tryout week in Washington, Shirley Booth walked out of the show, and the emphasis changed to the role played by Carole Haney, making her debut in a drama. Says a cast member: \"On opening night in New York, with Booth gone, replaced by Betty Field in what had become a tertiary part, Warren changed lines, business, blocking, and completely screwed up Carol Haney so badly that she ran into her dressing room in tears.\" The play was a disaster, but Warren got good reviews. Twenty-five performances later, he was off to Hollywood. He now says he doesn't want to return to the stage because \"I don't want to go through the mess of doing a play just to win the approval of four critics who decide whether you're going to be allowed to keep doing the play. That's a bore.\" But one of the Loss of Roses actors says: \"If he ever did come back, there'd be fifty people with guns waiting for him.\"\n\nBeatty and Natalie Wood at Cannes in 1962\n\nIn 1960, through William Inge's help, Warren was cast in his screenplay of Splendor in the Grass, directed by Elia Kazan. By now he was engaged to Joan Collins. When she left for Europe to film Esther and the King, Warren went to New York to film Splendor and met Natalie Wood, whose husband Robert Wagner spent the Summer of 1960 watching the co-stars fall in love. Joan Collins smelled more than splendor in the grass, flew back three times, but by August, 1960, Beatty and Natalie were going everywhere together saying, \"We're just friends,\" and collapsing in fits of laughter. While Wagner was selling Natalie's Hollywood mansion with its his-and-hers saltwater swimming pools, Warren (who nobody had ever heard of a year before) and Natalie (who nobody cared about a year before) became an item. The columns exploded with the news: suddenly Natalie, who was separated from Bob, was dating Warren, who used to be engaged to Joan, and Joan was dating Bob, who used to be Warren's best friend. And if you think that was confusing, it was, because Bob used to date Joan before he married Natalie. A Time correspondent on the scene at the time filed this dispatch from Hollywood: \"Last time I saw them they were all sitting in a screening room watching Splendor in the Grass. Joan laughed a lot in the picture. Natalie wept.\"\n\nWarren insists Splendor made money, but I have never been able to find a Warner Brothers executive who will support him. What it did do was establish him as a cause célebre: he got on a few covers and the ladies of the Hollywood press awarded him the much-despised \"Sour Apple\" award for \"Most uncooperative actor in movies.\" His price went up overnight to $200,000 a film. Through the help of William Inge again, Warren landed the role of an Italian gigolo who seduces Vivien Leigh in Tennessee Williams' The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone. Lotte Lenya, who won an Oscar nomination for that fiasco, says: \"I owe him a lot. Like most women, Vivien had a tremendous crush on Warren. He kept her so occupied that she allowed me to steal our most important scenes together. One night we were watching the day's rushes together and Vivien gasped, 'Oh, how could I let you do that to me?' and I said, 'But dalink, you were very busy this afternoon and had no time to rehearse.'\"\n\nIn 1962, William Inge maneuvered him into his third film, All Fall Down. That was the end of their professional relationship. Inge wouldn't discuss Warren, but Warren still calls him \"a nice man.\"\n\nAll Fall Down was a surprisingly sensitive film, but some of the critics flew up the wall over Warren. \"Beatty's acting consists largely of picking his nose and mumbling one-sentence speeches,\" said The National Observer, and Bosley Crowther summed it all up in The New York Times: \"There is one fatal flaw in the arrangement of elements in this film that makes it implausible, unnatural and extremely hard to take. It is the essential arrangement that everyone in the story is madly in love with a disgusting young man who is virtually a cretin. At least, Warren Beatty plays him so he seems like one. . . . Surly, sloppy, slow-witted, given to scratching himself, picking his nose, being rude beyond reason.\" \"Bosley Crowther has never liked me,\" says Warren, \"but I don't like him either, and I told him so once in Sardi's.\"\n\nWarren became so upset over his disastrous box office that he turned down seventy-five scripts and didn't work for two years. When he refused to play John F. Kennedy (the President had suggested him) in PT-109, the papers had a field day roasting him in effigy. \"Unbelievable!\" yelled Producer Bryan Foy. \"Actors today will drive you crazy if you pay any attention to them. The kid has got a mop of hair like the President but if all I needed was a mop of hair for this part, I could get Jack Benny to play it.\"\n\nPT-109 was a lousy picture and so were the others Warren turned down. He knew what he was doing. \"Success was very difficult to adjust to in the beginning,\" he says. \"I became stimulated by the gravy of being a movie star, but I didn't want to work just for the sake of working. So I dabbled in this and that. I became unnerved by the anarchy that seemed to exist in the movie establishment—all of which blended into a series of very good times, good food, a lot of good-looking girls, and a lot of aimless fun. I worked with Clifford Odets on a script. I drank wine. I sat in a lot of easy chairs and I listened. I met people like Jean Renoir, people I had only heard about before, in Paris and London. I was becoming an adult. I didn't want to pass up really tasting my early twenties in order to churn up momentum. I just didn't do anything until finally I was flat broke and I had to go back to work.\"\n\nThe film he chose was Lilith, the last film directed by the late Robert (The Hustler) Rossen. Everyone had high hopes for it, but Lilith was in trouble from the first day's shooting. A Gothic story of life in a mental institution, it was shot mainly in an abandoned airplane hangar at Roosevelt Field on Long Island, where Lindbergh took off for Paris in 1927, and in an old mansion on Oyster Bay owned by an executive of the Dime Savings Bank. To this day the cast and crew of Lilith mention Warren's name as though they have just bitten down on a strange green bug. According to them, he was impossible. He exasperated Rossen fighting over lines—once delayed a scene for three days demanding the line, \"I've read Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov,\" be changed to, \"I've read Crime and Punishment and half of The Brothers Karamazov.\" He sulked, refused interviews, annoyed the crew by holding up scenes to have his hair cut, angered the other actors by wearing four undershirts under his shirt to make himself look big-chested.\n\nAt the end of the picture, at the wrap party, the word got out that Peter Fonda and several of his friends were going to beat up Warren and throw him in the lake. Hortense Schorr, a kindly woman who was the picture's publicity consultant, says: \"We were terrified. We had to keep Peter and Warren on opposite sides of the room. The Columbia executives got very nervous and the word was out—'Get Warren out of here!'\" One of the guests was elected to drive Warren back to New York. He remembers: \"They didn't get Warren, but the next day I discovered that the house had almost been demolished. The door to Warren's dressing room was ripped off the hinges, glasses and candles were smashed, wigs were missing, the lawn wrecked.\"\n\nWarren diplomatically refuses to discuss Lilith, but it is clear that he blames everything on Rossen. \"He had diabetes, a bad heart, a drinking problem, and boils inside his skin which later ruptured and killed him. He was dying during the picture and didn't know it. His family didn't even know it. He was a sick man and the picture suffered as a result. I don't want to talk about it because it would sound like I was kicking a dead man.\" When it was finally released, Jean Seberg got rave reviews and Warren once again was roundly panned. Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times: \"A muddy performance by Warren Beatty doesn't help. . . . [He] has a sodden way of moving and a monotonous expression that suggests his character should be getting treatment.\"\n\nWord of Warren's behavior on Lilith spread through the industry, but Arthur Penn went to see it anyway, and hired Warren for Mickey One, a low-budget film with a sixty-day shooting schedule made in Chicago in such bizarre locations as the New Republic Cafeteria and Hugh Hefner's swimming pool. Something magical happened to Warren under Penn's baton. He shaped up. He took direction. He worked twelve to fifteen hours a day and never complained. And he turned in the best performance of his career, proving that he was not untalented when he cared enough about a project to work for his living instead of merely posing in front of a camera with a pocket comb.\n\nOffscreen, Warren was still in there pitching with the glamour girls. Natalie Wood, who had followed him to the set in Miami for All Fall Down, had long left the scene; Joan Collins, who had followed him around in Washington years before, had married Anthony Newley; and Warren, at the age of twenty-seven, had begun his most serious romantic entanglement to date with thirty-three-year-old Leslie Caron, who was very much on the scene in Chicago. In February, 1965, Peter Hall, the director of the Royal Shakespeare Company in London, divorced Miss Caron, charging adultery with Warren in Chicago, Jamaica and Beverly Hills. Warren paid all the court costs.\n\nHe moved to London for a while, where he made two films—Promise Her Anything with Caron, and Kaleidoscope. Both were colossal bombs, like all the others, but the former was particularly notable for its mediocrity. (PROMISE HER ANYTHING—BUT DON'T TAKE HER TO THIS, screamed Judith Crist's headline in the Herald Tribune and, in tiny letters usually reserved for B pictures in Forty-second Street grind houses, the portly New York Times announced: Promise Her Anything Has Dual Opening With Baby as Star.)\n\nMeanwhile the parties went on, at the rate of one every week, in Miss Caron's five-story Georgian town house on Montpelier Square in Kensington. Warren had five chauffeurs in London. All of them quit. \"Sometimes he goes into a house and says he'll be out in five minutes—it's sometimes five hours,\" moaned one of them. Warren's birthday party in March, 1966, made all the society columns. James Fox and Charlie Feldman and John Huston and Vanessa Redgrave and Anjanette Comer and Christina Ford and simply everybody had a super time talking about skiing and the British elections, wore pants suits and flowered ties and danced till dawn when they all ended up at breakfast and you could hear the shrieks of \"Dahling\" all the way to Chelsea. It ended, like all the Beatty idylls before it, in flames.\n\nSomething strange had happened to Warren's California sunshine and crazy-bleak winter breeze was blowing across the terrace. We moved inside, where he turned over the Kurt Weill record and played the flip side. Warren doesn't smoke and doesn't drink (I've known him to sit in Arthur and sip six ginger ales in a row), but he was cold and felt like a little nip. He picked up a brightly wrapped package left over from Christmas, and began to tear it open. \"This was a thirty-year-old bottle of bourbon made in 1936, which I bought as a gift for practically nothing. I wondered why it was so cheap. Then I found out it's only good if it's kept in a keg, so now I'm giving it to myself.\"\n\nHe opened the bottle and we drank it straight from room-service glasses. He noticed me glancing around the room, and immediately shifted to a new role—the tour guide. \"Here is my poetry of Yevtushenko, here on this table is my jar of 5,000 super protein concentrate vitamin pills. I get The New York Times every day— an eccentric thing to do in a Beverly Hills hotel, don't you think? Here is another book I'm reading—Khrushchev: A Career by Edward Crankshaw. Have you read it? You really should. I've learned to speak Russian without a teacher — from pocket books. When I don't understand a rule in one book I just go to another.\" There was no mention of Maya Plisetskaya, the Russian ballerina he had been linked with in the columns, and, one suspected, the real reason for his interest in linguistics.\n\n\"These,\" he continued, \"are colored sheets of paper. On the white sheets I write the crap and then when it gets better it goes to the pink sheets. By the time it gets to yellow it's an idea.\" He scooped up the papers scattered across the rug and hid them under a stack of folders on the coffee table. \"Here is an article on the economic situation in England, which I clipped from a weekly newsmagazine purchased in the hotel drugstore . . .\" he was really letting me have it now . . . \"and this is an article I wrote on Mabel Mercer. That is an empty bottle of Jack Daniels. I have here fifty pages of a screenplay I'm writing in longhand. This is Sea & Ski suntan lotion. And here—\" he strokes it with affection—\"is my leather-bound producer's case on Bonnie and Clyde . . . shooting schedules, the script, legal files, contracts, budgets, actors' salaries. . . .\"\n\nI asked him if he'd like to talk about how he became a producer, what kind of money he expected to make on the film. \"Talk to my agent.\"\n\n\"Well, then, would you say—\"\n\n\"No! I wouldn't say that. Whatever you say I wouldn't say. I only say what I say.\"\n\nI asked him if he'd care to talk about the women in his life. He seemed stunned, as though I had hit him suddenly in the locker room with a wet towel. \"What women?\" \"Well, all the women you've been seen with since you became an actor. The list reads like Who's Who.\" \"You said it, man, I didn't. I never discuss money or personalities. It's nobody's business but mine.\"\n\n\"You mean you deny the affair with Leslie Caron?\"\n\n\"We move in a time when tranquilizers, polygamy, so many alternatives are offered to working out the difficulties of a marriage.\"\n\nHe looked very tired. \"I look back on that with enormous, overwhelming sadness.\" Why had he never taken any of his relationships as far as marriage? \"We move in a time when tranquilizers, polygamy, so many alternatives are offered to working out the difficulties of a marriage. This business of you go with a person, you live with a person, you marry a person, you divorce a person, you marry another person—there is no substitute for the particular depth that is provided by time. Why don't you ask about the value of monogamy and the genius it requires?\" He was showing those wide, Pepsodent molars again.\n\n\"Do you feel you don't really know yourself well enough yet to take on the responsibility of marriage?\"\n\n\"I don't want to say that. I just want to be able to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the truth?\"\n\n\"A man tells the truth to a woman. A woman tells the truth to a man.\" Oh!\n\nHe was bored. He was lying down now, his head tilted to a 45-degree angle on the sofa, looking up sideways. I asked him why, if he wanted so desperately to project a new image as a responsible film maker instead of just another actor, interviews were so detestable to him? \"They embarrass me. I have a pretty good antenna for when somebody is bored, and then I get the feeling some gigantic economic machine is forcing us to sit down and talk to each other. I've been badly burned by interviews. They usually take the enfant terrible approach, anyway. If someone wants to attack me, my sensitivity has long since evacuated that scene.\"\n\nWarren was also beginning to evacuate the scene. And that's how I left him. A kid from Virginia, restless from having everything too soon, bored with himself, desperate to become a pillar of the movie world, not really sure if he was or was not a super-star, with no easily obtainable public to insure him of the right answer, listening to his Kurt Weill records, howling at the moon rising over his terrace like a slice of lemon peel in the California night, and falling, warmly and bearishly, asleep.\n\nIf you had, at some point in your life, been swooned over by Vanessa Redgrave, Natalie Wood, Joan Collins, Faye Dunaway, Leslie Caron, Inger Stevens, Princess Margaret, Maya Plisetskaya, Lee Radziwill, Candy Bergen and God knows who else, wouldn't you be full of it?\n\nA few weeks later, I saw Warren once more. He had just been to a party thrown by Lynda Bird Johnson at the White House. He met me in a bar. He was sipping orange juice and I was drinking a Whiskey Sour on the rocks. He was being very surly with the waiter. (\"Whaddya want, you want money?\") The waiter fled. He was very nervous about the story. \"I want to make a valuable contribution to this business, to produce worthwhile motion pictures!\" he kept saying. I told him about the students at U.C.L.A., and he became furious. \"Anybody can get five jerks to say anything!\"\n\nMaybe so, but I already knew what Warren thought about Warren. What about the public? We left the bar and walked for five blocks along Eighth Avenue, elbowing our way through the theatre crowds. Not one person showed any sign of recognizing Warren. We paused in the onslaught of normal, everyday subway-riding Joes on their way to a hockey match at Madison Square Garden. Nobody yelled, \"There's Warren Beatty!\" Nobody came near him.\n\nI went home frankly worried. Maybe I wasn't being fair. So what if Warren Beatty acts like a jerk? When he's far from the maddening Hollywood hysteria, shut off from the bleach-blonde starlets busily buying baby sharks for their swimming pools, out of touch with the phonies filling his head with how they're spending $3900 on totem poles for their front yards featuring hand-carved faces of all the members of their families—away from all the silliness, Warren seems like a nice guy. He doesn't own a Maserati or a sixty-eight-foot yacht or a twin-engine Cessna or an Andrew Wyeth original or a projection room with his own 35mm print of Potemkin or a Cardin blue pinstripe suit or a beach cabana on the isle of Sylt. I like him for that. And so what if he comes on strong? If you had, at some point in your life, been swooned over by Vanessa Redgrave, Natalie Wood, Joan Collins, Faye Dunaway, Leslie Caron, Inger Stevens, Princess Margaret, Maya Plisetskaya, Lee Radziwill, Candy Bergen and God knows who else, wouldn't you be full of it?\n\nI reached for my notes, ready to tear them into eight hundred little pieces and eat them for Sunday brunch, when I heard a knock at the door. It was my upstairs neighbor —a stereo addict, film buff, sports-car driver, Playboy reader—who had dropped by to borrow a bottle of Scotch. One last chance.\n\n\"What do you think of Warren Beatty?\" I asked suddenly.\n\n\"Is he still alive? I used to see him in the circus.\"\n\n\"That's Clyde Beatty!\" And that's when I covered the typewriter and went to bed."
