        "text": "From PatrickMcMullan.com.\n\nIt was announced this week that Paramount had signed Warren Beatty to direct and star in his first film since 1998’s Bulworth. Deadline Hollywood further reported that the project would be a Howard Hughes biopic—a project Beatty, a notorious perfectionist and/or obsessive-compulsive noodler, has been known to be toying with for years.\n\nVF Daily spoke with Vanity Fair contributing editor Peter Biskind, author of Star: How Warren Beatty Seduced America, about the backstory to this project. VF Daily: How long has Beatty been fooling around with this Hughes project?Peter Biskind: At least since the 80s, maybe earlier. He’s commissioned several scripts in the course of the history of the project. I read one of them, written by Bo Goldman [Oscar winner for One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest], but there were probably scripts before then. There were rumors that Robert Towne [Chinatown] had written a script. God knows how many there are, or have been.\n\nWhat was the Goldman script like?\n\nGoldman had already written the script for that Jonathan Demme movie (Melvin and Howard). He also had another Hughes script that was never produced. He was sort of an expert on Hughes. It covered the latter part of Hughes’s life, when he was losing his mind. It was a very good script and it emphasized the extent to which Hughes had cut himself off from everybody else—he was a lonely old man. It seemed to have some appeal to Beatty. Or as Goldman put it, Beatty was interested in “the fucking and the flying and the films.” Hughes owned RKO, he was a big player in the movie business and was also known for his womanizing.\n\nIn the 30s and 40s, Hughes had as many big-name actresses as Beatty did in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.\n\nExactly. And Hughes was a control freak, even more than Beatty. Goldman says stuff like “Warren Beatty is Howard Hughes.” You can understand why Beatty was interested in Hughes as a figure, and was attracted to Hughes as a subject for a movie.\n\nBut the script was focusing on the latter part of his life rather than the juicier, Beatty-ish part that Scorsese covered in The Aviator.\n\nPart of it is that as this project dragged on and on, Beatty was getting older, and it would have been hard for him to play the younger Hughes. The older Hughes is just as interesting as the younger Hughes. He was smart to do that. He’s been talking for years about casting the movie and looking for appropriate actors. I would have lunch with him and he would say, “What do you think of X, Y, and Z ?” and I would say, “This has been going on for a long time.” He has a reputation for making expensive movies that go way over budget, and he’s now in his mid-70s, so the question of who’s going to do it, who’s going to finance it, was a big one. But it looks like he’s found a home with Paramount.\n\nThe odd thing about the two articles that appeared on Deadline Hollywood is that the first one says he’s going to do a comedy and the second one announces that the project is going to be a Howard Hughes film. I never imagined the Hughes picture as a comedy, nor did Beatty ever indicate that it’s going to be a comedy.\n\nI wonder if there was some misunderstanding.\n\nThen you start thinking, “Are there two movies he’s doing simultaneously?” It seems like the usual Beatty smoke screen, but I don’t know. I would imagine it’s Howard Hughes, but he’s also been talking about doing a sequel to Dick Tracy, which seems like a crazy idea to me. I hope it is a Howard Hughes movie because from what I understand, he’s got a good script. He’s too proud to go out on Town and Country [Beatty’s last starring role, a notoriously over-budget 2001 flop]. Bulworth [1998] I thought was terrific, but he hasn’t had a hit in many, many years. I think he wants to go out on a big movie, both a commercial and a critical success, and I suspect that he’s going to do this. The other thing is that he has been talking about this Hughes picture for so long, you know, it would be an embarrassment if he didn’t make it. So I do believe it’s going to be made.\n\nThat’s always a question with Beatty projects. He can be the slowest-moving filmmaker in Hollywood.\n\nHe took forever to do Reds [Beatty’s 1981 drama, for which he won an Oscar as best director]. Diane Keaton [Beatty’s co-star and then girlfriend] said to me, “I never thought it was going to happen. I didn’t even think about it until we were actually on the set.” He went through several leading ladies: Julie Christie [a former girlfriend] was supposed to play the role at one point. But he did it. So I think the Hughes movie will eventually happen too, like I said, but how long it’ll take—who knows?\n\nRead more from contributing editor Peter Biskind right here and at PeterBiskind.com."
