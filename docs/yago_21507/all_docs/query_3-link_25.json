        "text": "Warren Beatty is a movie star of the sort they don't make any more . He is famous for being famous . He is famous for going to bed with the famous . His sexual liasisons have brought him more publicity that his movies and his list of conquests reads like a who's of women in Hollywood, spanning three decades and including up-to-the-minute stars like Madonna and Annette Bening-who co-started in Bugsy and finally coaxed Beatty into marriage and fatherhood. That is the media image of Beatty, the sexual playboy who cruised Los Angeles with fellow boulevardier Jack Nicholson looking for girls,girls,girls.But behind this facade is a man of dark and mysterious qualities whose life has been, in reality , anything but an open book . Warren Beatty has created his own image of an elusive, narcissistic intellectual who overshadows any of his silver screen creations . Professionally, he has been a reluctant star, making only twenty films so far, compared with Nicholson's forty-nine in an identical period. He became a multi-millionaire before he was thirty as the producer of the wildly successful Bonnie and Clyde, and has never had to accept work that did not appeal to him. He attracts controversy . Many feel that the films on political, economic and social issues represent a small but important body of work but his critics consider him a lightweight whose movies will not last .Either way he is larger than life . Actor, writer, director, producer, he has become one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. With the help of frank reminiscences from friends, colleagues and associates, bestselling author John Parker has written a riveting and richly colurful portrait of one of Hollywood's most compelling enigmatic stars . John Parker is the author of numerous books focusing on his alternating interests in royalty and Hollywood . His best-selling biography of Jack Nicholson was published in seven languages and his Five for Hollywood , a study of the movie industry in the fifties, was a U.S Book of the Month Club selection. Other subjects in John Parker's list of successufl biographies include Rock Hudson, Elvis Presley and Sean Connery.His royal subjects include the Duke of Windsor, the Princess Royal, Prince Philip and the Queen . 'This book is a great read... Parker puts his finger firmly on Nicholson's pulse and no punches are pulled' Mail on SundayJohn Parker... confirms truth can be stranger than fiction....this book is a constant source of amazement It works remarkably well...an enjoyable , gossipy account Areveting study...the revelations of the truth behind the lives of public figures and the presentational skills of the writer combine to make it a compelling and fascinating read ."
