        "text": "In November 2016, a few weeks after the devastating election results, I wrote this piece. It collected my thoughts on recent current events as only I can truly understand them: through the beautiful, distorted lens of the cinema. The film that came back to mind the most —again and again and again — last year was Bulworth, a dark political satire written, directed, produced and lead by Warren Beatty. Due to recent Oscar-related events and, obviously, Trump’s continued relevance, I decided to finally submit it into the public. Enjoy.\n\nIn light of recent events, my mind travels to two different places.\n\nThe first is high school freshman year, when my class voted on our student body president. On the one corner was a smart, diligent, well-rounded, straight-A woman, with clear objectives and affirmative thinking. On the other corner was one of our most notoriously outlandish class clowns, an absolute goofball with poor grades, infrequent class attendance and no clear long-term goals. He ran as a lark, an opportunity to shake things up by making a mockery of the whole ordeal. Based on recent events, you can probably guess who won. It only took a year before our official class president found himself in night school, away from his appointed duties. Our class funds were sufficiently limited, to put it mildly. In fact, we barely had a senior prom. We basically had to beg others for money by that point.\n\nI’ll admit: I was part of the problem. If I remember correctly, I voted for the class clown too. Because why not? He was the funny one, the interesting one. He was the one that would really stick it to the man and prove just how little high school politics mattered. In fact, maybe I didn’t vote at all? If that’s true, knowing that I helped dismantle our class — purely on a whim —is a decision I’ve come to regret, especially today. I imagine the same feeling will occur for several Americans these next four years. We, the American people, let Donald J. Trump become the President of the United States, directly or otherwise. If that doesn’t send a chill down your spin, or cause you to stop and think for even a brief moment, then we’ve truly crossed the line between common decency and politically-charged surrealism.\n\nWith this so forthright and present, my mind also travels back to Bulworth, 1998’s Oscar-nominated dark political satire, which serves as Warren Beatty’s fourth superfecta effort as a writer, director, producer and lead actor.\n\nBulworth centers on Sen. Jay Billington Bulworth, played by Beatty, a nullified California politician well beyond the ledge of existential dismay. Numbed by the blank political promises he bestows upon his state —all while in the midst of his political re-election campaign — he hires an assassin to shoot him dead before the weekend expires. He hasn’t eaten in three days, nor has he slept. He’s left crying in his office, revisiting his political ads in endless loops which promise to restore people on the verge of a new millennium. He’s an absolute wreck. His wife is cheating on him. His words no longer hold meaning. He sees little value in the political system.\n\nDuring my first viewing of Bulworth, notably during my high school years, I saw the film strictly as a morally-skewed comedy. The second time, however, it played like a pained tragedy. Bulworth is a man with little regard for anything and anyone. His personal life is a lie. His political opinions hold little water. He’s merely going through the motions appointed by his office staff, namely his straight-laced chief of staff Dennis Murphy (Oliver Platt). He’s fed scripts and told to spew lies he doesn’t believe —or want to believe— in anymore. So, in the midst of political sabotage, Bulworth suffers from an epiphany. Or a mental breakdown. It depends on how you look at it.\n\nRather than hold dear to all the chivalry, tight-lipped empty promises and corporate back-rubbing that brought him to where is, he opts to speak the truth as he sees it. He also goes to a hip-hop nightclub to drink and smoke all night, and later freestyle rap about the government’s hypocrisy to some of his once-trusted investors — much to the everyone’s befuddlement, including fellow politicians, the media and the state-at-large. Through my teenage eyes, I celebrated the film’s tenacity. I praised its titular central character for his unapologetic attitude —particularly in the face of personal struggle and social outcasting. As you might have guessed, I was a moody, entitled kid who wanted the big wigs thrown. Viewed today, it’s still the silly, spunky, surreal-but-mostly-lighthearted satire it was once before. But this past election also reveals just how bitter, impactful, judgmental and appropriately edgy Beatty was with his stark, uncompromising message.\n\nIn his review, Roger Ebert wrote “Warren Beatty’s Bulworth made me laugh — and wince. You realize that if all politicians were as outspoken as Bulworth, the fragile structure of our system would collapse, and we would have to start all over again.” From an outsider perspective, Bulworth is a funny, inspired and deftly uncompromising social commentary. But when given more relevance nearly two decades later, it’s a firmly pessimistic, startling and cutting piece of work, studying the ramifications that come from throwing anarchy into the once-honored tradition of U.S. politics.\n\nYes, Bulworth has become an outspoken rebel and a voice for the people. While that was effective and sometimes touching in Bulworth, since the Senator wants to speak for the under-appreciated minorities and undervalued low-class citizens in the LA area, it’s easy to see how Trump could use that same logic to rally those who viewed themselves as lesser, outcasted, unvalued “white rejects,” particularly in middle America, by seemingly giving them a voice of reason, respect and authority.\n\nTrump promised he’d look out for their best interests and fight for their close-minded vision of the future. For (nearly) everyone else, however, Trump was a one percenter, a snake-oil salesman and a con man, a trickster who made people believe in his predisposed, mostly empty lies, but it’s evident that many saw in Trump what many liberals likely saw in Beatty’s Bulworth. Notably, they saw a radical disgusted with the injustice and the political mistrust, one that — through foul language and politically incorrect terms — became an unfiltered wildman, ready to loosen up his tie, roll up his sleeves and give the Washington insiders a taste of their own medicine.\n\nLet me be clear: Jay Bulworth and Donald Trump are not the same exact person. Not at all. I doubt Trump, for instance, would ever be woke enough to ask, “Everybody got to keep fucking each other until they’re the same color?” But their journeys share some odd, unsettlingly similar progressions.\n\nBulworth is called “old liberal wine trying to pour himself into a new conservative bottle,” and it’s no secret that Donald Trump was a Democrat before he became a Republican in 2009. Political parties hold little relevance in the world of Bulworth. Everyone has their dirty pockets thick in funding pockets, whether it be the insurance companies, the banks, the influencing paychecks, what-have-you. Everyone is looking out for their own personal interests —or, at least, those that best serve their individual political parties.\n\nOne of Bulworth’s most enjoyable aspects is how Platt’s performance grows delightfully more unhinged with every single scene. When Bulworth first went off-the-rails, he was an absolute trainwreck, snorting coke out the wazoo, smoking like a chimney and sweating like a wildebeest in fear of what Bulworth will do to his longstanding career. But as Bulworth grows more support from the marginalized local communities, his tune begins to change. He’s suddenly in love with Bulworth’s crazed antics, and tells him to keep up the insanity, so long as the polls agree. It’s not hard to replace Platt’s Murphy with Trump’s Kellyanne Conway in that specific sense.\n\nAgainst all odds and political reasoning, Bulworth wins the election in a near landslide. Some, in fact, believe he should be president of the United States. These are not the only parallels found between the film and real life. Perhaps the most apparent — and certainly the most uncomfortable — comes when Bulworth raps the following at a well-dressed political lunch banquet:\n\nNow the women in the world is mistreated and abused\n\nBut when we try to fix it, we tend to get confused\n\nI got respect for all the sisters\n\nThey will tell you that’s my style\n\nBut there’s one thing in politics that always makes me smile:\n\nI like the pussy, the pussy\n\nI like it really fine\n\nAnd when you be a senator, you get it all the time\n\nThe young ones, the old ones, I really like them all\n\nAnd when you be in Washington, you hardly have to call\n\nThe women, they love the power, and if you don’t pull that rug out\n\nNo matter what you say or do, they give you that nappy dugout\n\nIn a post-”Grab ’Em By the Pussy” world, those lines read rather differently. So does Bulworth, especially on the eve of Donald J. Trump becoming the president of the free world. In my early life, I’ve seen two strong, smart, well-educated, experienced women get short-sighted by their demeaning, demoralizing, inexperienced, weak-minded male counterparts. It’s troubling and tremendously heartbreaking to endure. History has a funny habit of repeating itself, especially when it’s not really funny. But it also makes us re-examine what we once found hilarious, and see that what was once a heightened reality is now merely a glimpse at the world of old —one that likely couldn’t image what could happen in the near future. Sometimes, you have to look at the past to understand where we stand today. Hopefully, we learn from your mistakes and pick yourself up again. Because we’re not going to be the same, but we can be better. And I believe we will be better.\n\nEventually."
