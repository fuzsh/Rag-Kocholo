        "text": "The 1998 political satire, Bulworth, was a passion project of Warren Beatty, who starred in, directed, and co-wrote the film. It was also a movie that genuinely grabbed me in high school. It’s hip-hop soundtrack and affect was my bridge to a fledgling political consciousness.\n\nBut it was also funny as hell. And if you haven’t already seen it, ***spoiler alert***—the protagonist, Senator Jay Bulworth, gets assassinated at the end of the movie.\n\nThe Trump shooting made me recall a conversation I had a while back on the pod, with Matt Duss and Colette Shade (buy her book, available for pre-order!). We dissected Bulworth every which way. It was probably my favorite all-time episode of the pod.\n\nYou can still listen to it wherever you get podcasts, and you can watch the whole thing here:\n\nI wanted to pull out one section of that conversation though, because it has greater resonance now that mainstream media suddenly can’t stop using the phrase “political violence.” Here’s me from the episode:\n\nThe quote [from Bulworth] that hit me when they were at Halle Berry’s family’s house—which is in South Central—and Senator Bulworth decides to go out at night and just leave. Halle Berry was asking her parents like “You just let him leave!?” And then one of the guys is like “A U.S senator ought to be okay among his own constituents!”\n\nIt’s logically true to me that, you know, in a healthy democracy, a politician ought to be safe among the people he represents. But in context it’s obviously not true that like a rich, old, white guy in gang-banging-ass ‘90s South Central is going to be okay.\n\nBut that’s also an indictment…not of South Central—it’s an indictment of the kind of society that we have, which is very much not at peace. It’s laughable to us! It’s a laugh line that a politician would be safe among the people. And how fucked up is that? I mean, isn’t that what we should be striving toward? A society where politicians would be at peace with their constituents? We’re so far from that, you know.\n\nThat reflection hits differently now. American society is sick, and its politics broken—the tragic ingredients that give rise to “political violence.” Ironically, the politics of Bulworth actually does suggest a pathway out of tragedy…"
