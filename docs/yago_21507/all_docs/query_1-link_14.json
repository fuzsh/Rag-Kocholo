        "text": "Starring: Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, Oliver Platt, Paul Sorvino, Jack Warden\n\n35mm print in I.B. Technicolor courtesy of the Chicago Film Society\n\nJay Bulworth (Warren Beatty), a financially ruined senator, is now disillusioned with politics. The forlorn statesman orders a contract killing — the target himself — so his family will be able to collect a fortune from his insurance policy. Facing imminent death, a devil-may-care Bulworth speaks his mind in public, forsaking platitudes for honest but controversial observations. But when he falls in love with a hip young woman (Halle Berry), Bulworth urgently rethinks his impending murder.\n\nBe the first to know as soon as we announce new screenings and special events at Nitehawk Cinema!\n\nSign Up"
