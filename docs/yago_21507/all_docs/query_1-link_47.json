        "text": "Join a Discussion on Movies\n\nBy JANET MASLIN\n\nt's great to see a grown man cry when the man has as many good reasons as Sen. Jay Bulworth, the formerly viable American politician. He has a campaign speech (\"We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium ... \") that bores even him to tears. He has a wife (Christine Baranski), but she shows up only for ceremonial occasions. He has a staff best suited to snaring campaign contributions (\"Will the Sultan be in Beverly Hills?\"). He has enemies who pronounce him \"an old liberal wine trying to pour itself into a new conservative bottle.\"\n\nCredit:Sidney Baldwin/20th Century Fox Warren Beatty stars as metamorphosing Senator Jay Bulworth, the title character in the film he directed.\n\nSo Bulworth, played by a magically revitalized Warren Beatty, who has directed this political satire with jubilant wit and energy, sits blubbering amid his Kennedy-era mementoes, realizing that he's come to the end of the line. And then lightning strikes, to raucously funny and liberating effect. On the eve of the 1996 California primary, though \"the populace is unaroused\" (as an opening title announces), Bulworth goes bonkers enough to take desperate measures. He does something that works here almost as galvanizingly as it did in \"Network\": he speaks the unspeakable truth.\n\nIn a potentially cheap high-concept gimmick, \"Bulworth\" lets its button-down white politician turn homeboy, rapping excitedly to the same electorate he once put to sleep. This is not a trick every 60ish matinee idol should try. But Beatty (despite the recent evidence of \"Love Affair\") well knows how to avoid making a fool of himself, and how to treat sheepish naivete as a fine comic advantage. And he turns this into the kind of imaginative, anything-goes escapade that movie audiences, in the days before the pre-sold, pre-fab blockbuster, had the luxury of taking in stride.\n\nThough the tradition of 1970s dropout comedy has not entirely vanished, today's movie dropouts don't often find much worth dropping back into. Not so Bulworth: he plunges headlong into black urban culture and political advocacy as if no white Democratic senator could ever dream of such a thing. Though Beatty is obviously dedicated to the passionately liberal agenda that is espoused here, it's not his particular convictions that make the film fly. \"Bulworth\" works, with both urbanity and chutzpah, on viewing political puppeteering with an all-purpose jaundiced eye.\n\nWhile Beatty's changeable Bulworth dominates virtually every scene, the film gets a hilarious boost from Oliver Platt as the senator's frazzled aide. Murphy, Platt's long-suffering character, defines the film's idea of the electoral process with a string of euphemisms meant to cover for his boss. \"Senator, if you're having some sort of problem, now would be a good time to talk about it, sir,\" he offers, as the Bulworth meltdown begins. Murphy uses the term \"the young supporters\" for the three black female fans who wind up in Bulworth's limousine.\n\nThere could have been many ways for \"Bulworth,\" written by Beatty and Jeremy Pikser, to explain the sea change in their title character. But the mere presence of Halle Berry provides enough of a shorthand explanation. In an otherwise sketchy and ambiguous role, Ms. Berry's Nina catches the senator's eye when he pays a campaign visit to a black church, and he needs no further invitation to leap headlong into Nina's world. The film does show more bravado about attacking relatively safe targets (like big insurance companies) than venturing into an interracial May-November romance.\n\nMuch of the film's fun comes from watching Bulworth exult in his newfound freedom. Having taken on lots of life insurance and hired his own assassin, he delights in saying and doing anything that comes to mind. He begins to bop jovially, wearing a silly grin; he stays till dawn at an after-hours club, playing disc jockey and scratching out his favorite dirty words from a couple of rap records. And he scares Murphy when he makes up raps that actually have something senatorial to say. (\"One man, one vote, now is that really real? The name of our game is let's make a deal.\") Beatty's greenhorn ghettoese, in a film also hugely bolstered by its all-star, bona fide rap soundtrack, is to this film what his haircutting was to \"Shampoo.\"\n\nOnce Bulworth scandalizes everyone around him (\"Now would we be eligible for an Emmy or a Peabody?\" asks the C-SPAN crew member filming one of his more unprintable monologues) and takes on the inevitable hip-hop wardrobe, the film does lose some steam. Its best moments come from witnessing the Senator's inspired unraveling, not from watching where it will end. Indeed, the grandiose last moments are outrageously risky, though Amiri Baraka leaves the audience with a haunting epitaph for the film's own form of freedom ride. \"You got to be a SPIRIT,\" he exhorts. \"You can't be no ghost.\"\n\n\"Bulworth,\" a crystal-clear reminder of what that statement means to American politics, has been made with the visual elegance of earlier Beatty films. Shot handsomely by Vittorio Storaro, with costumes by Milena Canonero and production design by Dean Tavoularis (who goes back with Beatty to \"Bonnie and Clyde\"), it has both polish and pizazz. In the ensemble cast, Don Cheadle, Jack Warden, Isaiah Washington, Paul Sorvino and Laurie Metcalf provide comparable touches of class.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES\n\nBULWORTH\n\nRating: \"Bulworth\" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).
