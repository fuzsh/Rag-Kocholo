        "text": "Imagine how nice it would be if you only had to work once every 15 years. That’s the path Hollywood icon Warren Beatty is on, so for his new movie, he wore a lot of hats — writer, director, producer and star. Deco’s Chris Van Vliet brought his hat collection when he sat down for a chat with Mr. Beatty.\n\nI’d be wearing a hat right now, but I’m afraid it would mess my hair up. And I spent a full 30 seconds on it today.\n\nAlden Ehrenreich (as Frank Forbes): “You’re an exception. The rules don’t apply to you.”\n\n“Rules Don’t Apply” takes us back to the Golden Era of Hollywood — we follow a driver played by Alden Ehrenreich and an actress, Lily Collins, who just arrived in Tinseltown, trying to make it big.\n\nMatthew Broderick (as Levar Mathis): “Remember any driver that tries any hanky panky with any contract actress is fired.”\n\nBoth of them are working for Howard Hughes, played by Warren Beatty in his first movie role in 15 years.\n\nChris Van Vliet: “In Hollywood, there is this great fear of not working and you’re in this great position where you can choose whether you want to work.”\n\nWarren Beatty: “I started to try to be funny and say, ‘No, I have a fear of working,’ but I decided not to say that. I’ve never had to do picture after picture after picture, and I have been able to see kind of early that I’d like to make my own movies.”\n\nAnd that’s what Warren does here. He doesn’t just star in “Rules Don’t Apply,” he also wrote and directed the film that often parallels his own life.\n\nChris Van Vliet: “Warren said that he cast you because you reminded him of himself, so is there an added pressure then?”\n\nAlden Ehrenreich: “I guess so, in a sense. I found that those parallels, I guess on his end, were only informative. In that time, he really helped Lily and I understand these young people coming to Hollywood at that time.”\n\nLily Collins (as Marla Mabrey): “Mr. Hughes, I’d like to thank you for the chance to become a star.”\n\nWarren Beatty (as Howard Hughes): “You’ve never had a drink in your life?”\n\nMr. Beatty also directs his wife Annette Bening for the first time.\n\nChris Van Vliet: “Annette, you’ve been directed by so many great directors throughout your career — what was it like being directed by your husband?”\n\nAnnette Bening: “Super fun for me. I was happy just watching him because he was so in his element, running around, bossing everyone around.”\n\nWarren Beatty (as Howard Hughes): “Have you heard from people that I’m crazy?”\n\nLily Collins (as Marla Mabrey): “If what you are is crazy, then give me more crazy.”\n\nChris Van Vliet: “I love the title of this film, and I want to know for you, when did the rules stop applying for Warren Beatty?”\n\nWarren Beatty: “I don’t think they have.”\n\nChris Van Vliet: “Come on!”\n\nWarren Beatty: “No, no, no, no, no — I have rules that I follow.”\n\n“Rules Don’t Apply” is in theaters Wednesday, Nov. 23.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.
