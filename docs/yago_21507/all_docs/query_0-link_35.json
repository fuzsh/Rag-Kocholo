        "text": "WASHINGTON -- OK, I was suckered into renting the video of ''Bulworth'' to see if Warren Beatty has a chance of becoming president.\n\nNope. Not one. Not even if Bush, Gore, Bradley, McCain, Dole, Quayle, Forbes, Buchanan, Bauer, Keyes and Hatch are all discovered to be cross-dressing aliens who have escaped from a home for the psychologically disturbed.\n\nBeatty would have a better chance if ''Dick Tracy'' had been his newest movie.\n\nBut it says a lot of depressing things about America that an actor involved in such a dreadful movie as the cynical, exploitative, foul-mouthed ''Bulworth'' (through which Beatty hoped to make a statement about campaign finance reform) would even spend two seconds considering that he could be president.\n\nOnce again, the vapidity of America's ''Love Affair'' (yes, the flat 1994 remake by Beatty and Annette Bening of the Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr movie ''An Affair to Remember'') with celebrities is proving ridiculous. The presidential race so far may not be captivating, but the star of ''Shampoo'' and ''Ishtar'' and ''Promise Her Anything'' as an alternative?\n\nBeatty's ''message'' movie, ''Bulworth,'' is about a corrupt California senator who sells his votes to the highest bidders. (''Yes, we did get the check, and the senator would love to have drinks with the sultan.'')\n\nIn the middle of a nervous breakdown, the senator takes out a contract on his own life. Suddenly ''liberated,'' he begins telling the ''truth'' about his miserable life and speaks only in rhyming hip-hop. Curse words sprout from his mouth faster than normal people could rattle off the alphabet.\n\nThe movie then becomes an alphabet soup of cliched people, hackneyed dialogue and trite moments. It careens from madcap comedy to ''serious'' diatribe to a horrific ending. Are we supposed to laugh? To cry? To become outraged? To sign a petition? To send in a contribution?\n\nOn second thought, maybe the movie does mirror politics at its basest.\n\nBut it is still a really bad movie. At one point Beatty, who portrays with gusto ''Sen. Jay Billington Bulworth,'' tells Hollywood moguls that they make violent movies, dirty movies and bad movies. He should talk.\n\nWe are told that the serious issue of a possible Beatty challenge to Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic nomination was cooked up at a dinner party hosted by conservative pundit Arianna Huffington, whose ex-husband spent $30 million in a failed bid to become a California senator.\n\nThe only two ''messages'' of ''Bulworth'' are that big money in politics is bad and that blacks and whites don't get along. But John McCain already has become the champion of campaign finance reform and Bradley has made better race relations his big crusade. So where would Beatty fit?\n\nHe could be the airhead candidate for the non-thinking voter. The '60s liberal dreamer who no longer fits in a non-welfare state because today's solutions aren't sophisticated enough for tomorrow but who wants to make liberalism the new cause celebre. The goofy fin-de-siecle answer to ''Bedtime for Bonzo.'' The hollow, shallow celebrity whose pretty wife played the president's girlfriend in ''An American President.''\n\nThe calorically empty ''wisdom'' proffered in ''Bulworth'' comes in droppings such as: ''Never make life or death decisions when you're feeling suicidal.'' And ''You got to be a spirit. You can't be no ghost.'' And ''Old liberal wine trying to pour himself into a new conservative bottle.''\n\nBeatty himself is not a good speaker and has a strange thought process. When dealing with the obvious question of why anyone would cast a vote for him for the most important job in the world, the multimillionaire actor/producer/writer who contributes big money to politicians answers in capital letters: ''WE MUST HAVE PUBLIC FINANCING OF ALL FEDERAL CAMPAIGNS.''\n\nOne can just ponder a future executive order: ''WE MUST GO TO WAR BECAUSE I SAID SO.''\n\nThe more Bulworth rants and raves, snorts and curses, lusts and lisps, the more appalling and unlikable he is until he reverts to his old self (one knows because the tie comes back and the rhyming stops). Then we miss the rapper.\n\nA 15-year-old watching the movie groaned, ''Please tell me he doesn't win in the end.''\n\nI want my rental fee back.\n\nAnn McFeatters is Washington bureau chief of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Toledo Blade.\n\nHer e-mail address is amcfeatters@nationalpress.com"
