        "text": "FILM: Director seasons his political, sociological ideas with\n\nlight comedy\n\nBy Lonnie Harris\n\nDaily Bruin Contributor\n\nLike a true politician, Warren Beatty insists on shaking the\n\nhand of every new person he meets. While this is customary on a\n\npolitical campaign, like the one Beatty is running in his pet\n\nproject \"Bulworth,\" it’s a bit unexpected in a cramped suite in\n\nBeverly Hills filled with anxious journalists. Beatty is certainly\n\nan imposing figure as he strides around the room, not looking a day\n\nof his 61 years (most of which were spent in some capacity in\n\nHollywood).\n\nAll of this experience has given Beatty a lot to think about,\n\nand \"Bulworth,\" which he wrote, directed, stars in and produced, is\n\nin many ways a sounding board for some of his controversial\n\npolitical ideas. The film follows the final days of the senatorial\n\ncampaign of Jay Billington Bulworth, a Democratic incumbent for the\n\nState of California.\n\nBulworth has decided that his life is so meaningless he wishes\n\nto end it, so he arranges his own assassination after making sure\n\nhis daughter will receive a huge insurance settlement. His new life\n\nsentence allows Bulworth to finally let loose and express his real\n\nfeelings about politics, society and just about any other topic he\n\nencounters.\n\nUnfortunately, after meeting an attractive young woman from\n\nSouth Central (Halle Berry), Bulworth realizes that he wants to\n\nkeep on living and spends the rest of the film trying to call off\n\nthe assassination.\n\nWhile much of the film works as a comedy (or, as Norman Mailer\n\ncalled it, a \"tragic farce\"), underneath the surface is a scathing\n\nsatire of American politics, lampooning the way special-interest\n\ngroups exploit public servants through hefty donations and\n\ninfluence.\n\n\"Eventually, you have to do a movie about something you feel\n\nabout, instead of something you think about,\" Beatty says. \"If you\n\nwant anybody to be amused, or entertained or even to stay in their\n\nseat, you have to feel something.\"\n\nWhat Beatty feels, however, is not a traditional political\n\nviewpoint. Much of \"Bulworth\" concerns race relations, and the film\n\nfinds Beatty making many trips to South Central Los Angeles and\n\neven adopting elements of African American culture. One of\n\nBulworth’s most effective techniques in his campaign becomes the\n\nuse of rap music to push ideas about the corruption within the\n\nSenate.\n\nThe film also has a rap soundtrack featuring Ice Cube, Mack 10,\n\nCappadonna, Method Man, Dr. Dre, L.L. Cool J and others. Beatty\n\npersonally chose many of the songs that would be featured in the\n\nfilm, and felt that the rap was essential for expressing much of\n\nthe movie’s message about the condition of the African American\n\ncommunity.\n\n\"The energy that came out of certain political figures in the\n\n’60s and ’70s went into this rap community,\" Beatty says. \"Some of\n\nthem are saying articulate stuff, some of it is political, some of\n\nit is just dumb. It’s white kids that are buying this, so what you\n\nhave to realize is that there is much less of a racial divide among\n\nyoung people. This thing is moving toward class more than\n\nrace.\"\n\nAll of these intense political and sociological messages might\n\nnormally weigh a movie down and make it preachy. It was important,\n\nthen, to include light comedy in order to temper the intellectual\n\ndiscussions. Beatty attempted to deal with these two opposing\n\nthemes by focusing on entertaining the audience instead of forcing\n\nhis opinions on them.\n\n\"I just want to have a good time,\" Beatty says. \"I want to be\n\nentertaining. If you want to send a message, call Western Union. I\n\ncould sit down and say my message, but it would bore most people,\n\nbecause it would be like something you’d see on C-SPAN. In order\n\nfor me to be entertaining through this, I go to a heightened\n\ncharacterization. We use a stereotypical politician, a\n\nstereotypical cop and a stereotypical black man. It’s what I call\n\nfunny.\"\n\nHowever, is any movie as politically charged as \"Bulworth\" made\n\nonly to be funny? It is a cagey proposition considering that the\n\nfilm is written and directed by one of Hollywood’s more\n\ncontroversial filmmakers, known for his left-wing manifestos\n\n(including \"Reds\" and \"Bonnie and Clyde\").\n\nBeatty insists, however, that people can get any message they\n\nwant out of his story of a senator having a nervous breakdown.\n\n\"I don’t make movies to effect change, although they may very\n\nwell effect some change,\" Beatty says. \"You make movies to express\n\nyourself, to release some feeling or some joke. Very often those\n\nthings do effect change. But, I never thought I could make this\n\nmovie and not have it be marginalized.\"\n\nThe final product is certainly not marginalized, despite the\n\nfact that \"Bulworth\" was produced by Newscorp, a major corporation\n\nof exactly the type that Bulworth complains about in the film. (The\n\ncompany is even run by billionaire Rupert Murdoch, whom Beatty\n\ninsists has political views antithetical to his own.) Beatty is\n\nactually so pleased with the final film as to call it the best work\n\nhe’s ever done. Considering his prolific career, this statement\n\nsays a great deal.\n\n\"I think it’s the best picture I’ve made, because I didn’t give\n\na fuck how much money it would make,\" Beatty says.\n\n\"Even when I made ‘Reds,’ I still felt an obligation to have it\n\ndo well. I made this movie way in advance and had complete artistic\n\nautonomy on it, and I had none of the marketing rights. I’m just\n\nlucky as hell to be able to do it.\"\n\nFILM: \"Bulworth\" opens in Los Angeles on Friday.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nWarren Beatty wrote, directed and stars in ‘Bulworth.’\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nHalle Berry and Warren Beatty star in \"Bulworth.\""
