        "text": "The book, just released on Tuesday, has already gained media attention because of a specific number Biskind mentions in his book. The number — 12,775 — refers to how many women Beatty has allegedly slept with.\n\nBiskind, who has been an East Chatham resident for 20 years (10 full time), explains in his book that if Beatty was with no more than one partner a night between the mid-1950s and 1991, including stretches with the same woman, more or less, it would add up to 12,775, “give or take.”\n\nThis large figure is what the media is focusing on, but Biskind, in an interview with the Chatham Courier, was very clear on what the book is mostly about — Beatty’s career.\n\nBiskind knows there have been other books written on Beatty, but commented that they never really captured his personality.\n\nNot only does Biskind capture Beatty’s personality, but he fortifies the notion that Beatty is “one of the foremost filmmakers of his generation,” is a “people collector” because he knows “absolutely everyone,” is passionate about and active in politics and was a ladies man for a good part of his life.\n\nAs an author of five other books on Hollywood cinema and with a 20-year working relationship with Beatty, why wouldn’t Biskind feel his book would be the book on Beatty?\n\nBiskind “always liked movies growing up.” He said he wanted to be a documentary filmmaker, but found it cost too much to make documentaries, so he started writing film journals. “It was cheaper to write,” he said.\n\nBorn and raised in New York City, Biskind started working for magazines and not just about films, but also politics. “In the 1960s, I was interested in politics,” he said.\n\nHe became editor-in-chief of American Film magazine in 1981 and was there until 1987. From there he went to Premiere magazine, where for the next decade, he was executive editor.\n\nWith his foot firmly planted in Hollywood’s door, Biskind published his first book on life in Hollywood in 1983, “Seeing Is Believing: How Hollywood Taught Us to Stop Worrying and Love the Fifties.” The description of the book states that there are thousands of subtle ways movies of the 50s reflect the political tensions of that decade.\n\nIn 1990, he published another book, “The Godfather Companion: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About All Three Godfather Films.” The title speaks for itself.\n\nAfter his job at Premiere, Biskind published a third book, “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock-’n’-Roll Generation Saved Hollywood” (1998). A book about 1970s Hollywood, he was able to get Hollywood bigwigs to “spill the beans.”\n\nBeatty was one of those bigwigs Biskind often interviewed. He first interviewed Beatty in 1989, when he visited the set of “Dick Tracy” for Premiere. Biskind said Beatty threw him off the set, but later agreed to be interviewed and they talked until 3 a.m. one morning. So for the next 20 years, Beatty and Biskind developed a friendly relationship.\n\nBiskind yearned to write a biography on Beatty. “I’ve wanted to do this forever,” he said. But Beatty wouldn’t budge. Biskind states in his introduction that Beatty had planned to write his own book.\n\nIn 2001, Beatty called Biskind and finally said, “I think it’s time to write that book [about me] you were talking about.” But Biskind couldn’t quite start a book on Beatty until he finished the book he was working on at the time.\n\nThat book was “Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film,” released in January 2004. In November of the same year, he published “Gods and Monsters: Thirty Years of Writing on Film and Culture From One of America’s Most Incisive Writers.”\n\n“Down and Dirty Pictures” “chronicles the growth and eventual mainstreaming of independent films,” while “Gods and Monsters” is a compilation of Biskind’s magazine articles, from his years at American Film up to his current post as contributing editor for Vanity Fair magazine (an excerpt of his book has been published in February’s issue).\n\nFinally, Biskind started writing his long-awaited Beatty biography and it seems like he spoke to every Hollywood actor, director, etc. under the sun for this book. Asking him to name names, he threw out Dustin Hoffman, Michelle Phillips, Peter Fonda, Diane Keaton, Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson — and of course, Beatty — to name a few.\n\nBiskind did stress that the biography is unauthorized. Beatty’s lawyer, Bertram Fields, has repeatedly told news establishments that the book was not authorized by Beatty and contains several false assertions and misquotes. Biskind did say that Beatty “cooperated” for the book.\n\nBiskind states in his introduction that he “always had certain guidelines in my head. I decided that anything of a personal nature that occurred after [Beatty] and Annette Bening married was off limits.”\n\nWhen asked who would be interested in this book or why, Biskind simply stated, “it depends on how much you [already] know about him.”\n\nHe was the “biggest star in Hollywood for 15 years,” stated Biskind, the “quintessential star.” He was charming, smart, a good actor, but he became more controlling, he said.\n\nBeatty produced, directed and/or acted in several acclaimed films: “Bonnie & Clyde,” “Shampoo,” “Heaven Can Wait,” “Reds,” “Dick Tracy,” “Bulworth,” to name a few, but as Biskind chronicles one film to the next, he claims that Beatty’s reputation as “difficult to work with” followed him.\n\nDespite this reputation, Beatty has garnered several prominent awards, including four Golden Globes and an Academy Award. As a filmmaker, he was nominated in four Oscar categories — the only one aside from Orson Welles to do so — and he did it twice — for “Heaven Can Wait” in 1978 and “Reds” in 1981.\n\nBeatty’s career slowed down in the 90s, but his 1998 film “Bulworth” did receive several nominations and an award. His most recent acting gig was “Town & Country” in 2001, but it was reported that the film cost more to produce than it took in at the box office and received poor reviews.\n\nBiskind said that Beatty has long wanted to make a biopic film on Howard Hughes, which he wants to produce, direct and act in. Biskind said it would be “perfect for Beatty” because Hughes and Beatty have similar personality traits. Biskind writes in his book that “Beatty’s friends speculated about his fascination with Hughes, and it didn’t take Freud to notice the affinity between the two men.” Beatty has yet to make a film on Hughes.\n\nWhen asked why he thinks Beatty finally settled down, Biskind said it was because of his relationship with Madonna. While filming “Dick Tracy” together, Beatty noticed their relationship “dramatized what it meant to be old,” said Biskind. Beatty was 53, Madonna 32.\n\nIn 1992, Beatty married Bening, with whom he co-starred in the film “Bugsy” in 1991, and they have four children together ranging from 18 to 9 years old.\n\nBiskind’s publisher, Simon & Schuster, describes his book as “compulsively readable and constantly surprising” and that Biskind has written the “most intimate, revealing, and balanced biography ever of Hollywood legend Warren Beatty.”\n\nWhen asked if he thinks this book will affect his relationship with Beatty, Biskind chuckled. He said he’s not sure, but did say he’s heard that Beatty often doesn’t read the books written about him. This one he just might.\n\nBiskind’s “unauthorized” but very revealing and entertaining book “Star” ($30 hardcover) is available at the Chatham Bookstore, where he will be signing copies from 5:30 to 8 p.m. Saturday, with an excerpt reading around 6:45 p.m."
