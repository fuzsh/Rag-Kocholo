Warren Beatty co-wrote, directs, and stars in this cracked political fairy tale about the eponymous Bulworth, an incumbent California senator running to keep his seat in Congress. An old-school 1960s liberal, Bulworth has tacked to the right on everything from affirmative action to health insurance for the poor to secure high-powered conservative campaign contributors. In this world, the Democratic Party lacks a soul. So Bulworth goes out and gets some soul -- black soul. Alternately rapping, swearing, and hitting on young Nina (Halle Berry), Bulworth lays out the facts of his political life. "I've got to raise $10,000 a day every day I'm in Washington. I ain't gettin' it in South Central," he says in strained ghetto cadence. "I'm gettin' it in Beverly Hills. So I'm votin' in the Senate the way they want me to and I'm sendin' them my bills. But we've got babies in South Central dying as young as they do in Peru. We've got public schools that are nightmares. We've got a Congress that ain't got a clue!"
