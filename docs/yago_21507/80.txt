Bulworth

Warren Beatty / US, 1998 / 108 min.

Surprisingly sharp political comedy by and with Warren Beatty, who bitingly satirises the American election circus. Senator Bulworth decides that from now on, he’s going to speak straight from the heart – as a rapper. Much to the dismay of his spin doctors. Chosen by Albert Serra.

In Bulworth, Warren Beatty, the renowned New Hollywood icon (Shampoo, The Parallax View, Bonnie and Clyde), provides a biting satire on the devolution of American politics.

Bulworth was Beatty’s fourth film as a director. It was released the same year as Wag the Dog and Primary Colors, two other political comedies, yet was almost instantly forgotten even though two absolute legends worked on it, film composer Ennio Morricone and director of photography Vittorio Storaro.

Why in Eye

In his political satire Beatty makes fun of everyone and everything, yet primarily his ‘own’ Democratic Party. Bulworth sometimes loses the plot, but has lost nothing of its contemporaneity. Straight-talking fiction films like this are hardly made anymore.
