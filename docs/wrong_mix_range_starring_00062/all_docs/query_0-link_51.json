This week, we are talking about Dogma, written and directed by Kevin Smith, and starring an all-star roster of Smith favorites, A-listers, Shakespearean actors, and stand-up comedians. And because we couldn't do it along, we brought along the Godfather of Filmspotting Madness and host of the Filmjitsu podcast Mike Merrigan to talk about the film with us.\nAlong the way, we not only discuss the layers of theology Smith is dealing with in the film, but also our own personal journeys with Smith and his collaborators, George Carlin's career, the Matt and Ben phenomenon, bizarre horror movies, our favorite small-town film Mumford, 1990s erotic thrillers, Die Hard, and much much more. Oh, and we recommend 4 films this week.\nAnd, in a moment of pure joy, Mike describes Tripp's taste in movies perfectly!\nPowered by Riverside.fm.\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\n\"Die Hard\" with Kevin Smith on Blank Check.\n\n\"Erotic 90s\" on You Must Remember This.",

This week, we are talking about High Fidelity, based on the Nick Hornby novel and directed by Stephen Frears. And, we have picked up a passenger for the episode, friend of the show and quizmaster extraordinaire Taylor Cole!\n\nAlong the way, Taylor becomes the first person to ever compare High Fidelity to Taxi Driver, Ross uses the word \"myopic\" way too much, and we discuss the rise of Jack Black, John Cusack as romantic lead, the benefits of talking directly to the camera, Stevie Wonder, the musical and TV adaptations of High Fidelity, and what some actors will do for a great wig.\n\nPlus, Taylor brings a fun game to stump Tripp and Ross!\n\nThememusic by Jonworthymusic.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nThe Great American Pop Culture Quiz Show, hosted by Taylor Cole.\n\nG & T with Greta & Taylor.\n\nCFF Films with Ross and friends.\n\nMovies We've Covered on the Show on Letterboxd.

Today, we are talking about Whatever It Takes, a teenage \"adaptation\" of Cyrano de Bergerac in the vein of 10 Things I Hate About You and She's All That.\n\nAlong the way, we discuss the many other ways this story has been told, the uncomfortable sexual politics of early 2000s high school, body hair, sex education, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, and a bevy of TV Shows: Once and Again, One Tree Hill, Freaks and Geeks, The Practice, The West Wing, and Breaking Bad!\n\nTheme Music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nOur exit today has us looking at two immensely accomplished and talented directors producing work that does not live up to their reputations. First we will talk about The Next Best Thing directed by John Schlesinger. Next, we will discuss What Planet Are You From? directed by Mike Nichols. Both are relationship comedies of sorts and both seemed to be misfires from legendary directors who won Best Director Oscars in the 1960s. Along the way, we discuss how dated these films probably felt in 2000, our love of Garry Shandling and Rupert Everett, a Madonna musical misfire, film critic Lou Leminick, another Michael Vartan questionable character, and Ross discovers a movie that may be \"too arty\" for Tripp!\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nOur exit today has us trying to figure out who killed the most hated woman in town. This week, we are talking about Drowning Mona, reuniting Bette Midler and Danny DeVito, written by Peter Steinfeld and directed by Nick Gomez.\n\nAlong the way, Tripp and Ross manage to touch on the brilliance of Danny DeVito, Agatha Christie, Gilmore Girls, various Batman movies, and rehash their never-ending Drop Dead Gorgeous battle.\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nOur exit today has us trying to finish up our follow up novel that we have been working on for the past 7 years. This week, we are discussing Wonder Boys, written by Steve Kloves based on the book by Michael Chabon and directed by Curtis Hanson. It also happens to be one of Tripp's favorite movies of all time.\n\nAlong the way, Tripp and Ross get to discuss Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Robert Downey Jr., Gilmore Girls, 70s dad rock, lots of bizarre Spider-Man connections, and why people keep releasing Christmas movies in March.\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nOur exit today has us avoiding a hit on our heads. This week we are discussing The Whole Nine Yards, written by Mitchell Kapner and directed by Jonathan Lynn. It gives us another chance to praise the physical comedy of Matthew Perry, talk for the first time about Bruce Willis, and praise newcomer Amanda Peet.\n\nAlong the way, Tripp and Ross also discuss Robert De Niro, David Fincher's The Killer, the nature of farce, nude scenes that work and don't work, the late great Michael Clarke Duncan, Montreal films, and Tripp previews next week's film, a favorite of his that Ross has never seen.\n\nPlus, Ross has finally seen a film in a foreign language!\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nOur exit today has us learning way too much about John Wayne’s…manhood. This week, we are discussing Hanging Up, written by Nora and Delia Ephron and directed by Diane Keaton, and featuring one of the worst posters we have seen so far.\n\nAlong the way, we wrestle with a lot of careers we haven't talked about yet: Keaton, Meg Ryan, the Ephrons, and National Treasure Walter Matthau. Plus, talk of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, cult comedies, soap operas, and watching a film that mirrors your own life in different ways. Plus, Ross blows Tripp away with this film's placement on a worst of the year list!\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nOur exit today has us wondering if we should get serious with our college girlfriend. This week, we are talking about Down To You, written and directed by Kris Isacsson, and starring the ever popular (at least in 2000) Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles.\n\nAlong the way, we can't help talk about 10 Things I Hate About You and She's All That, along with romantic comedies with honest endings, Central Park, the legacy of Woody Allen films, and one of our favorite talking points, Forces of Nature's mummy erotica.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nOur exit today has us examining two sports comedies centered around trying to get back in the ring. First, there is Play It To The Bone, written and directed by Ron Shelton. It stars Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas and centers around the boxing world. Second, there is Ready to Rumble, written by Steven Brill and directed by Brian Robbins. This stars Scott Caan and David Arquette and takes place in the world of professional wrestling. Along the way, Tripp and Ross talk about some podcast favorites (Oliver Platt and Martin Landau), professional wrestling, a lot of underwritten female characters, some uncomfortable violence, and Tripp almost creates marital strife in his life.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nOur exit today has us finally coming into the new millennium and we start with a sequel to a ‘90s classic.

Since Ross has made Tripp try and examine the comedy films of 1999, it only seemed right for Tripp to finish off our first season by making him examine a film from 1999 that he would have watched that Ross had never seen. And there seemed to really be only one logical pick, a film that from the very beginning of this podcast Tripp mentioned as a film that he absolutely would have been watching instead of these films: The Red Violin by Francois Girard.\n\nAlong the way, Tripp and Ross talk about lesser Steven Spielberg films, Masterpiece Theatre, the Genie awards, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and, of course, the coolest man in show business (Samuel L. Jackson). Theme music by Jonworthymusic. Powered by Riverside.FM\n\nToday we taking a detour from our normal programming and looking back at the films we have watched from 1999! It is the first annual Stapler Awards, where Tripp and Ross award the films, performers, scenes, and surprises of the year they just watched.\n\nPlus, Tripp quizzes Ross on the films they just watched, lots of talk of The West Wing and Scream, disappointment in the other awards shows of 1999 (like the Oscars and the Razzies), why Ross hates subtitles, and a look ahead at what is in store for the year 2000 (not said in a Conan O'Brien voice).\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM\n\nOur exit today has us traveling the final frontier of space and vaguely feel like we are part of a certain sci-fi series. This week, in our season finale (!), we are talking about Galaxy Quest, starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and podcast-favorite Alan Rickman.\n\nAlong the way, we talk science fiction tropes, alternate casting, the young actors who show up in the film (Rainn Wilson! Justin Kirk! Sam Rockwell!), Black Mirror, 60s science fiction, Andrew Sarris, 1999 Oscar bait, and a preview of how we are wrapping up 1999 in the next few weeks.\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nOur exit today has us trying to find some creative ways to make some extra cash. This week, we are talking about the first ever film from Happy Madison, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, starring Rob Schneider.\n\nAlong the way, Tripp pulls out another laundry list of complaints about a movie (including the world's worst Dr. Seuss title) as both Tripp and Ross try to figure out where this falls in our 1999 trifecta of chauvinistic comedies.\n\nPlus, Tripp and Ross discuss early 90s Saturday Night Live, a forgotten late 2000s HBO show, male nudity, and of course, Character Actress Margo Martindale.\n\nPowered by RiversideFM.\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\nOur exit today has us packing up to Beverly Hills to begin our new lives. No we aren’t talking about the Beverly Hillbillies. This week, we are discussing Anywhere But Here, written Alvin Sargent, based on Mona Simpson’s book and directed by Wayne Wang. And there is lots of talk of the two stars, 90s favorites Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman.\n\nPlus, Tripp and Ross talk about the long career of the great Alvin Sargent, other parent-child movies, the rough history of this movie, Mona Simpson's surprising family connections, 90s weepy movies, CSI, and, of course, some great character actors.\n\nTripp's recent episode of The Great American Pop Culture Quiz Show.

This week, we are talking about Dogma, written and directed by Kevin Smith, and starring an all-star roster of Smith favorites, A-listers, Shakespearean actors, and stand-up comedians. And because we couldn't do it along, we brought along the Godfather of Filmspotting Madness and host of the Filmjitsu podcast Mike Merrigan to talk about the film with us.\n\nAlong the way, we not only discuss the layers of theology Smith is dealing with in the film, but also our own personal journeys with Smith and his collaborators, George Carlin's career, the Matt and Ben phenomenon, bizarre horror movies, our favorite small-town film Mumford, 1990s erotic thrillers, Die Hard, and much much more. Oh, and we recommend 4 films this week.\n\nAnd, in a moment of pure joy, Mike describes Tripp's taste in movies perfectly!\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm.\n\nTheme music by Jonworthymusic.\n\n\"Die Hard\" with Kevin Smith on Blank Check.\n\n\"Erotic 90s\" on You Must Remember This.\n\nOur exit today has us searching for love and trying to commit. This week, we are looking at two romantic comedies with some notable names in front of the camera, but did not do well at the box office. The first is Three to Tango, and the second is The Bachelor. Both films are trying to make movie stars of their leading men: Matthew Perry and Chris O’Donnell. Along the way, there is lots of talk of Buster Keaton (whose film Seven Chances inspired The Bachelor), sitcom plots, wonderful character actors, bad depictions of Chicago, golden-age screwball comedies, and Tripp keeps trying to recast these movies.\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm\n\nTheme Music by Jonworthymusic\n\nOur exit today has us maybe regretting that veiled autobiographical novel. This week, we are discussing The Best Man, written and directed by Malcolm D. Lee and starring an ensemble of wonderful up-and-coming young actors. Of course, we spend a lot of time discussing Taye Diggs, Morris Chestnut, Nia Long, Harold Perrineau, Terrence Howard, and of course, podcast favorite Regina Hall.\n\nPlus, we talk about Lee's famous cousin Spike, some wedding dos and don'ts, strippers with a heart of gold, Space Jam: A New Legacy, what makes a great ensemble, and then Ross drops the bomb about the origin of one of next week's films...spoiler alert: Tripp is shocked!\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm\n\nTheme Music by Jonworthymusic\n\nOur exit today has us trying to win a trip to Hollywood to become an extra in a film with positive moral values. This week’s film is Superstar, based on Molly Shannon’s Saturday Night Live character, Mary Katherine Gallagher. While the two hosts might start the episode with very different opinions on the movie, one of them actually manages to change the others mind a bit! Plus, some very odd findings in the IMDB keywords, lots of Todd Solondz talk, more Will Ferrell, a history of SNL movies, and creepy armpit smelling. And of course, Tripp manages to somehow bring Steven Sondheim into the conversation.\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm\n\nTheme Music by Jonworthymusic\n\nOur exit today has us looking at two small town comedies that take place in the northwest part of the United States. First is Mumford, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan and starring Loren Dean and a cast of lovely character actors. The second is Mystery, Alaska, written by David E. Kelly and Sean O’Byrne and directed by Jay Roach, with Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, and even more lovely character actors. Along the way, Tripp and Ross discover that one of these is charming and the other is maybe the weirdest movie we have covered yet.\n\nPlus, discussions of Hannibal Lecter, obscure documentaries, why sports movies don't always get the respect they deserve, two very different impressions of Burt Reynolds' career, what makes a good small town lawyer, and Tripp picks on comedy stars randomly appearing in more serious-minded ensembles. Oh, and there are sex robots.\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm\n\nTheme Music by Jonworthymusic\n\nOur exit today has us searching for stolen gold at the end of the Gulf War. This week, we are discussing Three Kings, written and directed by David O. Russell with a story by John Ridley, and starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze, and a strong ensemble cast.

First, there is Chill Factor, starring recent Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich. Second, there is Blue Streak, starring Martin Lawrence. Both films try to walk that fine line between providing us great action set pieces and quippy one liners. Chill Factor puts its action stylings ahead of its comedic aspirations while Blue Streak leans much heavier into the comedy realm thanks in large part to its star. Along the way, Tripp and Ross touch on the use of some unfunny actors in these films, a wacky Roger Ebert contest, the timeliness of the films, and Tripp manages to recommend a random French film Ross has never heard of!\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm\n\nTheme Music by Jonworthymusic\n\nOur exit today finds us in the mind of Full House creator Jeff Franklin and his directorial debut Love Stinks, starring French Stewart and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras. Along the way, Tripp struggles to find a word other than \"baffling\" to describe the film, but is driven to tangents about A Light in the Piazza and a very long list he complied in his notes while Ross tries to rewrite the ending of the film with inspiration from a surprising place.\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm\n\nTheme Music by Jonworthymusic\n\nThis week, our exit has us looking at two high school coming of age films that take place in two different decades. First, we have Outside Providence, written by the Farrelly brothers. Second, we have Drive Me Crazy. Both films show seniors in high school trying to navigate their social lives while also balancing complicated romantic entanglements. Outside Providence, taking place in the 1970s, looks at a working class guy who ends up at a Connecticut boarding school. Drive Me Crazy takes place in the present as two teenagers prepare for their high school’s centennial.\n\nAlong the way, Tripp and Ross are distracted by the baffling nature of both films, along with discussions of TGIF TV, James Dean, Connecticut, accent work, Siskel & Ebert, and an ending so confounding that they have to dissect it beat by beat. All of it adds up to one of the longest episodes yet, but they couldn't stop talking about these films like a deer in headlights!\n\nThis week, Tripp and Ross get revenge on all their horrible teachers in the horror-comedy Teaching Mrs. Tingle. Of course, they can't help but compare it to the Kevin Williamson ouevre (and Scream especially), but also have plenty of time to talk about dames, odd school projects, and TWO Ross-certified National Treasures. Plus, Tripp refuses to answer one of the Ross' prompts about the film.\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm\n\nTheme Music by Jonworthymusic\n\nThis week, Tripp and Ross get in over their heads with the mob comedy Mickey Blue Eyes. Of course, they can't help but compare it to several movies they have already seen this year, as well as talk The Godfather, The Sopranos, Hugh Grant, and James Caan. And to ring in the new year, both Tripp and Ross share their favorite movie of 2023. Oh, and in a shocking twist, Tripp recommends a movie with an 11% Rotten Tomatoes!\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm Theme Music by Jonworthymusic\n\nThis week, Ross introduces Tripp to another Trip, this one on his way to a KISS concert in Detroit Rock City. Along the way, Tripp and Ross look at all the ways the movie intersects with other films they have already discussed, their views on 70s rock, how the film portrays Tripp's hometown of Detroit, and Tripp drops a surprising Muppet opinion at the very end of the episode!\n\nPowered by Riverside.fm\n\nTheme Music by Jonworthymusic\n\nThis week, Tripp and Ross go to Hollywood and try making their own low-budget science fiction epic while they discuss Bowfinger. Along the way, they discuss the purpose of art, alternate casting choices, some pre-#metoo jokes that might not work too well, and what the qualifications are to be \"Certifiably Fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes. Plus, a little bit of Muppet-talk and lots of love for another Ross-anointed National Treasure.\n\nTheme Song: Jonworthymusic\n\nPowered by Riverside.FM\n\nAnother episode, another high school adventure. This time, Tripp and Ross are in Englewood with The Wood. While time hopping between flashbacks to the 80s and a 1999 wedding, they manage to discuss not only the film, but also RENT, accent work, Tripp's 17th birthday celebration, and a lot of unplanned comparisons to last week's film, American Pie. Plus, Tripp gives Ross a hard time for his extended introductions to games, and Ross gives Tripp a hard time for his embarrassing preview of next week's episode!\n\nTheme Song: Jonworthymusic\n\nPowered by Riverside.FM\n\nOnce again, Tripp and Ross are back in high school. This time, though, it is with the almost-X-rated American Pie, a film that Tripp said last week he had fond memories of. Do they hold up two decades later?\n\nAlong the way, they discuss the all-star cast of up-and-comers, the films frankness, and a few other podcasts you might hear them on soon.\n\nThe Great American Pop Culture Quiz Show, Season 10, Episode 1 (with Tripp \"Pooh Bear\" Burton)\n\nTheme Song: Jonworthymusic\n\nPowered by Riverside.FM\n\nThis week, Tripp and Ross adopt/babysit/kidnap a child as they talk about Big Daddy and the work of Adam Sandler. And because Ross needed help convincing Tripp of the genius of the Sandman, they welcome their first guest: the much more eloquent Mitchell Beaupre (Letterboxd). Along the way, they talk New York apartments, Hooters, Happy Madison productions, some very uncomfortable jokes, and then try to top each other with some high falutin' recommendations. The true suspense of the episode, however: will Ross ever be able to pronounce the last name of screenwriter Tim Herlihy.\n\nMitchell's essay on 4:44: The Last Day on Earth.\n\nIntro and Outro Music: So Alive (Instrumental) by Jon Worthy\n\nPowered by Riverside.FM\n\nThis week, Tripp and Ross battle through some late summer colds (sorry for the stuffy voices) and come face to face with Dr. Evil, Mini-Me, and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. And along with some mini-tangents about obscure Broadway musicals and HBO movies, they have finally found the movie that makes Tripp really angry!\n\nIntro and Outro Music: So Alive (Instrumental) by Jon Worthy\n\nPowered by Riverside.FM\n\nThis week, Tripp and Ross share their anti-dognapping sentiments in regards to David Spade's \"Lost and Found.\" Somehow, this movie also brings out Tripp's love of both Nick-at-Nite and French cinema, the size of dressing rooms at strip clubs, and the question of how low you can fate a film on Letterboxd.\n\nIntro and Outro Music: So Alive (Instrumental) by Jon Worthy\n\nTripp and Ross go to prison for the Eddie Murphy/Martin Lawrence comedy \"Life.\" They are both shocked by the poignancy and drama of the film, but also have time to also discuss the amazing Rick Baker, a slew of great character actors, and the ups and downs of Eddie Murphy's 1990s output. Plus, Tripp's first documentary recommendation!\n\nIntro and Outro Music: So Alive (Instrumental) by Jon Worthy\n\nThis week, Ross takes Tripp back to his high school dating life and Never Been Kissed. Along the way, they discuss the authenticity of high school movies, Drew Barrymore's ever changing career, the Barbie movie, late 70s Robert Altman, the Scream franchise, and Tripp's most unhinged double feature suggestion yet. Plus, a shocking confession from Ross as to a seminal movie that he has never seen!\n\nDrew Barrymore CRIES After Finding Hidden Window Video.\n\nIntro and Outro Music: So Alive (Instrumental) by Jon Worthy\n\nThis week, Tripp and Ross head to New York City with Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin with The Out-of-Towners. Was Tripp's 25 year wait to see his first movie set come to life worth it? Along the way, they also discuss Broadway composers, Monty Python, the Disneyfication of New York City, legendary character actors, and whether this movie would have been better with Kermit and Miss Piggy instead of the two leads.\n\nIntro and Outro Music: So Alive (Instrumental) by Jon Worthy\n\nIn another double-header, Ross and Tripp tackle two largely forgotten 1999 high concept comedies. Spoiler alert: it is also the most contentious episode yet, and some of their opinions might be surprising! They also touch on the recent Brendan Fraser renaissance, late career Christopher Walken, the Jersey Shore, misogyny, and Tripp's high school choir tour. Plus, a new feature where Tripp tries to figure out what he was seeing instead of these films in 1999.\n\nIntro and Outro Music: So Alive (Instrumental) by Jon Worthy\n\nTripp and Ross set sail on the journey that is Forces of Nature and very young Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck.
