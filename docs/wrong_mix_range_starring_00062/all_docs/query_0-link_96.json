        "text": "1989 was unquestionably the Summer of the Bat as Tim Burton’s take on the Caped Crusader broke records. For 1992, it’s a bit more murky but we could call it The Summer of the Cat based on the sequel being the season’s biggest blockbuster.\n\nAs I have every season on the blog, I’m recounting the top 10 hits as well as some notable pics and failures from the summers of 30, 20, and 10 years ago. For 1992, it was a time of no crying in baseball, a Best Picture winner being discovered, and audiences refusing a biopic about a discoverer of America.\n\nWe begin with the moneymakers from #10 on up before moving to additional hits, misses, and those somewhere in between.\n\n10. Housesitter\n\nDomestic Gross: $58 million\n\nWhile not the blockbuster he’d had just six months prior with Father of the Bride, Steve Martin had a midsize performer with this rom com costarring Goldie Hawn.\n\n9. Honey, I Blew Up the Kid\n\nDomestic Gross: $58 million\n\nThe return of Rick Moranis and plenty of special effects had shrunken grosses compared to the predecessor. The $58 million tally is less than half of what Honey, I Shrunk the Kids made. Nevertheless a direct to video sequel and TV series followed.\n\n8. Far and Away\n\nDomestic Gross: $58 million\n\nTom Cruise is ruling summer 2022 with Top Gun: Maverick. It was a different story 30 years ago with this rare misfire. Ron Howard directed the epic Western costarring Tom’s ex Nicole Kidman. The domestic take was less than the reported $60 million budget. Cruise would quickly get back in the good graces of moviegoers later in 1992 with A Few Good Men.\n\n7. Boomerang\n\nDomestic Gross: $70 million\n\nWhile not approaching the earnings of his largest hits, Eddie Murphy’s first foray into romantic leading man territory did decent business. A string of flops would follow before a plus sized comeback four years later in The Nutty Professor.\n\n6. Patriot Games\n\nDomestic Gross: $83 million\n\nHarrison Ford stepped into the role of Jack Ryan after Alec Baldwin (who played the role in The Hunt for Red October) didn’t return. The result didn’t quite reach the financial or critical levels of its predecessor, but it easily made enough to warrant Clear and Present Danger two summers later.\n\n5. Unforgiven\n\nDomestic Gross: $101 million\n\nClint Eastwood’s tale of an aging cowboy out for revenge took the August box office by storm and eventually was an awards favorite – winning Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor for the villainous Gene Hackman. Unforgiven is the rare BP winner to release in the summer season and kickstarted an impressive second act for the legendary filmmaker.\n\n4. A League of Their Own\n\nDomestic Gross: $107 million\n\nPenny Marshall’s World War II era baseball comedy was celebrated for its interplay between players like Geena Davis, Madonna, and Rosie O’Donnell in addition to one of cinema’s longest urination sequences from Tom Hanks.\n\n3. Sister Act\n\nDomestic Gross: $139 million\n\nComing on the heels of her Ghost Oscar, Whoopi Goldberg hit the jackpot with this fish out of water pic putting the comedienne in a convent. A less regarded sequel would follow in December 1993 as well as a Broadway musical.\n\n2. Lethal Weapon 3\n\nDomestic Gross: $144 million\n\nMel Gibson and Danny Glover’s third go-round in their buddy cop franchise didn’t generate the reviews of its two predecessors, but it had no trouble raking in the bucks. Rene Russo joined the party this time as Gibson’s love interest and fellow officer. Part 4 would come six years later and a fifth is in development right now.\n\n1. Batman Returns\n\nDomestic Gross: $162 million\n\nBreathlessly anticipated and then received with mixed reaction due to its dark tone, Batman Returns is now seen by many as an improvement over the 1989 original. One thing that’s generally agreed upon is Michelle Pfeiffer nailing the role of Catwoman. This would be Burton’s last time helming the series with Joel Schumacher taking the franchise in a far more cartoonish direction for 1995’s Batman Forever.\n\nAnd now for some other noteworthy selections outside of the top ten:\n\nUnlawful Entry\n\nDomestic Gross: $57 million\n\nComing on the heels of the Rodney King verdict and the L.A. Riots, this thriller starring the late Ray Liotta as a dirty cop tormenting Kurt Russell felt timely.\n\nSingle White Female\n\nDomestic Gross: $48 million\n\nLiotta was the Cop From Hell while Jennifer Jason Leigh was the Roommate From Hell terrorizing Bridget Fonda in this memorable psychological thriller.\n\nEncino Man\n\nDomestic Gross: $40 million\n\nThe cinematic era of MTV personality Pauly Shore (as well as Brendan Fraser) began with this caveman comedy that grossed several times its meager $7 million budget.\n\nUniversal Soldier\n\nDomestic Gross: $36 million\n\nAction lunkheads Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren teamed up for this futuristic sci-fi pic that turned a nifty profit and spawned numerous sequels. Four summers later, director Roland Emmerich would dominate the season with Independence Day.\n\nHoneymoon in Vegas\n\nDomestic Gross: $35 million\n\nWith a plot similar to Indecent Proposal that would follow a few months later, Honeymoon in Vegas took the more comedic route and earned decent grosses in the cast led by Nicolas Cage, Sarah Jessica Parker, and the just departed James Caan. Plus… Flying Elvis impersonators!\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nDomestic Gross: $16 million\n\nIt did manage to double its meager budget, but this vampire comedy likely wouldn’t be remembered had it not led to a critically acclaimed WB series starring Sarah Michelle Gellar. The title role in the film version belonged to Kristy Swanson with a supporting cast including Luke Perry, Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman), and pre double Oscar winner Hilary Swank.\n\nMy final section of the summer 1992 recap gets to the under performers and downright flops…\n\nDeath Becomes Her\n\nDomestic Gross: $58 million\n\nThis star studded satire from Robert Zemeckis boasted Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, and Bruce Willis above the title and some innovative special effects. While it just missed the top ten, the $58 million take barely surpassed the $55 million budget. Audiences and critics were mixed though Death has become a cult favorite in subsequent years.\n\nAlien 3\n\nDomestic Gross: $55 million\n\nDespite marking the directorial debut of David Fincher and featuring a memorably bald Sigourney Weaver, Alien 3 is considered to be a step-down from its iconic predecessors Alien and Aliens. In spite of the backlash, the franchise has continued and, of course, Fincher went onto brighter (albeit even darker) pastures.\n\nCool World\n\nDomestic Gross: $14 million\n\nAnimator Ralph Bakshi is best known for his X-rated 1972 feature Fritz the Cat. After Cool World, he was still mostly known for Fritz the Cat. This hybrid of live-action and cartoon fantasy starred Kim Basinger and Brad Pitt. Yet it bombed with reviewers and crowds alike and only earned half its budget back stateside.\n\nChristopher Columbus: The Discovery\n\nDomestic Gross: $8 million\n\nNo one had interest in discovering this critically drubbed Columbus biopic that had Marlon Brando and Tom Selleck in the cast. Later in the fall, Ridley Scott’s 1492: Conquest of Paradise about the title character would also bomb.\n\nTwin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\n\nDomestic Gross: $4 million\n\nIn 1990, David Lynch’s bizarre TV series was a cultural phenomenon… at least for a season. The movie version arrived after the second and final season and audiences had tuned out.\n\nAnd that’s your look at the cinematic summer from 30 years ago! My recap of 2002 will be available in short order…\n\nRate this:\n\nIt is officially summertime 2021 and that brings my annual seasonal three-part series where I take a look back at the top ten pics, flops, and other notable selections from 30, 20, and 10 years ago. That means I’ll begin with 1991 at a time where Arnold Schwarzenegger said hasta la vista to all competitors.\n\nLet’s count down from #10 to numero Ah-nuld along with other entries worthy of discussion (both good and bad).\n\n10. Doc Hollywood\n\nDomestic Gross: $54 million\n\nMichael J. Fox had a midsize hit with this fish out of water comedy about an uppity surgeon stuck in the rural south. It marks the star’s last solid performer that he headlined.\n\n9. Boyz n the Hood\n\nDomestic Gross: $57 million\n\nJohn Singleton had one of cinema’s most memorable directorial debuts with this coming-of-age drama set in South Central. He would become the youngest filmmaker ever to be nominated at the Oscars and the critically hailed pic kickstarted the careers of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ice Cube.\n\n8. One Hundred and One Dalmatians\n\nDomestic Gross: $60 million\n\nDisney re-released their 1961 classic three decades after its release and picked up a cool $60 million for it. Later in 1991, the studio would begin another renaissance with Beauty and the Beast becoming the first animated film to nab a Best Picture nomination. Five years later, Glenn Close would headline the live-action version and another reboot, Cruella with Emma Stone, is currently in the top five.\n\n7. What About Bob?\n\nDomestic Gross: $63 million\n\nBill Murray had one of his signature roles as the multi-phobic patient tormenting shrink Richard Dreyfuss on his vacation. Apparently this comedy was a bit dramatic behind the scenes with the two leads having an actual antagonistic relationship.\n\n6. Hot Shots!\n\nDomestic Gross: $69 million\n\nSpoofs were a hot commodity in the early 90s following the success of 1988’s The Naked Gun. Jim Abrahams, one of that film’s writers, created this sendup of Top Gun and many others that starred Charlie Sheen. A sequel would follow two years later.\n\n5. Backdraft\n\nDomestic Gross: $77 million\n\nRon Howard directed this firefighting drama that heated up the box office with Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Robert De Niro, and a creepy Donald Sutherland as a pyromaniac. There was even a sequel released in 2019 with Baldwin and Sutherland that went direct to streaming and that I frankly forgot existed.\n\n4. The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear\n\nDomestic Gross: $86 million\n\nThe spoofing love continued as Leslie Nielsen reprised his role as doofus detective Frank Drebin in this sequel to the 1988 classic. It couldn’t hold up the original, but it was better than part 3 which followed in 1994. And, needless to say, this was a simpler time for costar O.J. Simpson.\n\n3. City Slickers\n\nDomestic Gross: $124 million\n\nAs New Yorkers learning life lessons on a cattle drive, Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Bruno Kirby starred in the comedy smash of the summer and costar Jack Palance even ended up with a Best Supporting Actor victory. A less regarded follow-up would come in 1994.\n\n2. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\n\nDomestic Gross: $165 million\n\nWhile his accent was spotty at best, Kevin Costner parlayed his Oscar success from the previous year’s Dances with Wolves into this blockbuster about the robbing from the rich and giving to the poor hero. The highlight was Alan Rickman’s sublime work as the Sheriff of Nottingham while critics mostly turned up their noses.\n\n1. Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n\nDomestic Gross: $204 million\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s android went from being the bad guy in the 1984 original to the good robot in James Cameron’s sequel that gave us eye popping and revolutionary special effects and a dynamite Linda Hamilton returning as a buffed up Sarah Connor. There’s been four more entries in the franchise and none have matched the potency of this one.\n\nNow let’s turn the focus to some other notable releases:\n\nThelma & Louise\n\nDomestic Gross: $45 million\n\nSusan Sarandon and Geena Davis both scored lead actress Academy nods for Ridley Scott’s now iconic tale of feminism and revenge with an unforgettable ending. This also marked audiences falling in love with a then unknown actor by the name of Brad Pitt.\n\nPoint Break\n\nDomestic Gross: $43 million\n\nPatrick Swayze starred in the previous summer’s high earner with Ghost. This surfing action pic from director Kathryn Bigelow paired the actor with Keanu Reeves and has amassed a deserved cult following. An unnecessary remake wiped out in 2015.\n\nDead Again\n\nDomestic Gross: $38 million\n\nKenneth Branagh’s sophomore effort after the acclaim of his Shakespearian Henry V was this Hitchcock homage costarring his then wife Emma Thompson, Andy Garcia, and Robin Williams. As tributes to the Master of Suspense go, this is one of the best.\n\nSoapdish\n\nDomestic Gross: $38 million\n\nSally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey, Jr., and Whoopi Goldberg are part of the ensemble in this comedy set in the world of the afternoon melodramas that populate the airwaves. Not a big hit at the time, its reception has since grown.\n\nJungle Fever\n\nDomestic Gross: $32 million\n\nSpike Lee’s tale of an interracial couple played by Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra received critical kudos. The two most memorable performances come from Samuel L. Jackson as a crack addict and Halle Berry (in her feature debut) as his girlfriend.\n\nMadonna: Truth or Dare\n\nDomestic Gross: $15 million\n\nAs she often is, Madonna was ahead of the cultural curve with this documentary set during her 1990 Blond Ambition Tour. This was reality programming before it exploded.\n\nBarton Fink\n\nDomestic Gross: $6 million\n\nThe Coen Brothers pitch black comedy was the darling of the Cannes Film Festival, winning Picture, Director, and Actor for John Turturro. It would land three Academy nominations including Michael Lerner in Supporting Actor.\n\nNow it’s time for the pictures that either didn’t land with audiences or critics (or both):\n\nThe Rocketeer\n\nDomestic Gross: $46 million\n\nDisney was hoping for a new franchise with this comic book based property. Yet the period adventure underwhelmed at the box office. This was a different era for the genre before the MCU changed everything. Director Joe Johnston, coincidentally, would go on to make Captain America: The First Avenger 20 years later.\n\nDying Young\n\nDomestic Gross: $33 million\n\nThis seems hard to believe now, but Premiere magazine predicted this romance would be the largest grossing feature of the summer. Not so much. However, Julia Roberts was just coming off her smash breakthrough Pretty Woman. This didn’t land with audiences in the same way.\n\nOnly the Lonely\n\nDomestic Gross: $25 million\n\nChris Columbus was basking in the box office bonanza that was Home Alone. This rom com with John Candy and Ally Sheedy that followed six months later didn’t cause many filmgoers to leave their homes.\n\nMobsters\n\nDomestic Gross: $20 million\n\n1990 was gave us lots of mobster fare such as GoodFellas, The Godfather Part III, and Miller’s Crossing. Crowds and critics didn’t take to the Christian Slater and Patrick Dempsey versions of Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky, respectively.\n\nHudson Hawk\n\nDomestic Gross: $17 million\n\nBruce Willis’s vanity project is considered one of the gargantuan flops in history. Grossing only about a fourth of its $65 million budget, it was awarded the Golden Raspberry for Worst Picture of the year.\n\nV.I. Warshawski\n\nDomestic Gross: $11 million\n\nBased on a series of successful novels, audiences didn’t take to Kathleen Turner in the title role for this detective action comedy. It made less than half its budget.\n\nDelirious\n\nDomestic Gross: $5 million\n\nAlso set in the world of soap operas, this marked another dud for John Candy in the same season.\n\nAnother You\n\nDomestic Gross: $2 million\n\nRichard Pryor and Gene Wilder are a classic combo with well-regarded comedies like Silver Streak and Stir Crazy. Even See No Evil, Hear No Evil in 1989, despite critical scorn, performed well. That’s not the case with their last collaboration (which reviewers also drubbed).\n\nAnd that concludes my look back at summer 1991. Next up is the sweltering season of 2001!\n\nRate this:\n\nFriends: The Reunion premieres today on HBO Max and millions of the show’s fans can rejoice in seeing the six main characters from the NBC sitcom together on the couch once again. Running from 1994 to 2004, the show was an instant smash that continues to gain new followers through streaming services.\n\nI was a viewer going back to the mid 90s. Due to Friends becoming so gigantic at the outset, Hollywood studios quickly tried make the main cast immediate movie stars. This resulted in varying degrees of success.\n\nSo in honor of the reunion, let’s take a look back in movie history at this iconic sextet and I’ll rank each actor from 1-6 on their cinematic output!\n\nJennifer Aniston (Rachel Green)\n\nThe Friends Zone Cinematic Ranking: 1\n\nBefore her casting as Rachel, Aniston’s only significant big screen credit was as a lead in the cult slasher Leprechaun. Yet her filmography during and after Friends easily puts her atop these rankings. She garnered critical raves in the indie dramas The Good Girl and Cake, was the love interest in the now beloved Office Space, and has plenty of comedic hits like Bruce Almighty, Horrible Bosses, We’re the Millers, and Murder Mystery.\n\nCourteney Cox (Monica Geller)\n\nThe Friends Zone Cinematic Ranking: 3\n\nCox is really the only Friendster with notable movie appearances before the show. Just a few months before the Friends premiere, she starred alongside Jim Carrey in the surprise hit Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Years before that, she acted alongside He-Man and Skeletor in Masters of the Universe. During Friends, she appeared in the horror blockbuster Scream and she’s about to turn up early next year in its fourth sequel. The rest of her filmography is pretty scant, but she’s the only one with a well established franchise.\n\nLisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay)\n\nThe Friends Zone Cinematic Ranking: 2\n\nMany might call 1997’s cult favorite Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion her finest contribution to the silver screen. Kudrow has also appeared in several supporting roles over the years from The Opposite of Sex to Analyze This and its sequel to Easy A to Booksmart. There’s certainly been some clunkers (Hanging Up and Lucky Numbers), but the voluminous output is enough to rank Kudrow in second.\n\nMatt LeBlanc (Joey Tribbiani)\n\nThe Friends Zone Cinematic Ranking: 6\n\nHe found further TV success post Friends (though it took some time after the ill-fated spin-off Joey). LeBlanc’s big screen career never really launched. The 1996 starring vehicle Ed paired him with a primate and was a critical and commercial disaster. To put it another way, the monkey business with Marcel on the TV show was far more profitable. Two years later, his participation in the Lost in Space pic was met with shrugs.\n\nMatthew Perry (Chandler Bing)\n\nThe Friends Zone Cinematic Ranking: 4\n\nPerry ranks first among the boys as he had solid performers alongside Bruce Willis in The Whole Nine Yards and Zac Efron in 17 Again. There were, on the other hand, some duds like his pairing with Chris Farley in Almost Heroes and in the Yards sequel. He’s about to appear in his most high profile entry in years with Don’t Look Up from Adam McKay which stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence.\n\nDavid Schwimmer (Ross Geller)\n\nThe Friends Zone Cinematic Ranking: 5\n\nThe Pallbearer found Schwimmer in a rom com with Gwyneth Paltrow in 1996. It wasn’t quite the loud flop that Ed was, but it certainly came and went with little fanfare. His filmography is rather low-key with supporting appearances in Six Days, Seven Nights and Apt Pupil. His greatest successes can be found in voiceover work as Melman in the Madagascar franchise and on the small screen in the heralded limited series The People v. O.J. Simpson.\n\nAnd there’s your trip down Friends memory lane, folks! For the real thing, watch the team reunion on HBO Max.\n\nRate this:\n\nToday on the blog, we come to the third and final replay of the cinematic summers from 30, 20, and 10 years ago. If you missed my posts covering 1990 and 2000, you may find them right here:\n\nhttps://toddmthatcher.com/2020/07/18/summer-1990-the-top-10-hits-and-more/\n\nhttps://toddmthatcher.com/2020/07/25/summer-2000-the-top-10-hits-and-more/\n\nThis brings us to 2010 where sequels ruled the top 3 slots and a couple of other significant franchises were born. We also all had our collective minds blown by Christopher Nolan’s brand of time shifting sci-fi action.\n\nAs I have with previous entries, I’ll recount the top ten hits, some other notable titles, and the flops of the season. Let’s get at it!\n\n10. The Other Guys\n\nDomestic Gross: $119 million\n\nThe buddy cop comedy marked the fourth collaboration in six years between director Adam McKay and his lead Will Ferrell after Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, and Step Brothers. It also marks Ferrell’s first teaming with Mark Wahlberg and the pair would go on to make two successful and family friendlier Daddy’s Home pics.\n\n9. The Last Airbender\n\nDomestic Gross: $131 million\n\nBased on the Nickelodeon animated series, the fantasy adventure marked a departure from M. Night Shyamalan’s twisty suspense thrillers. It did, however, maintain the filmmaker’s recent trend of critically savaged titles (arriving two years behind the lambasted The Happening). It couldn’t match its reported $150 million budget stateside.\n\n8. Grown Ups\n\nDomestic Gross: $162 million\n\nAdam Sandler continued to prove himself review proof with this comedy where he recruited buddies Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider for another sizable hit. A sequel followed three years later.\n\n7. The Karate Kid\n\nDomestic Gross: $176 million\n\nProduced by his parents Will and Jada, this retooling of the 1984 blockbuster starred Jaden Smith with Jackie Chan as his mentor. Shot for just about $40 million, it grossed over $300 million worldwide. Surprisingly, a planned sequel never materialized.\n\n6. Shrek Forever After\n\nDomestic Gross: $238 million\n\nTypically a gross of $238 million is quite an achievement, but not necessarily in this case for the Dreamworks animated franchise. Forever grossed less than its three predecessors and generated mixed critical reaction.\n\n5. Despicable Me\n\nDomestic Gross: $251 million\n\nAt the start of summer 2010, not many would have have projected this original Illumination Entertainment animated tale would outdo Shrek. Yet that’s exactly what occurred and two sequels and the Minions spin-off franchise have followed.\n\n4. Inception\n\nDomestic Gross: $292 million\n\nComing hot off the heels of 2008’s The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan had another huge earner in his collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio. It might have been a challenge to follow the plot, but audiences gave it their best and a worldwide take over $800 million occurred. Multiple Oscar nominations, including Best Picture (though not Nolan’s direction), resulted.\n\n3. The Twilight Saga: Eclipse\n\nDomestic Gross: $300 million\n\n2010 found audiences still enraptured by the Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner vampire romance. The third entry in the series set a midnight earnings ($30 million) opening record that stood for a year before Harry Potter swept it away.\n\n2. Iron Man 2\n\nDomestic Gross: $312 million\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe was still in its infancy a decade ago as this was the third pic of the bunch. Part 2 posted fine numbers, but was considered a bit of a letdown compared to the first edition. It did mark the first appearance of Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow and a buff and whip cracking Mickey Rourke as the main villain.\n\n1. Toy Story 3\n\nDomestic Gross: $415 million\n\nPixar easily ruled the season with the third flick in the studio’s startup series. Arriving 15 years after the original, the return of Woody and Buzz was a critical darling that earned a Best Picture nomination and lots of love from all ages. Part 4 would follow in 2019.\n\nAnd now for some other noteworthy pictures from the time frame:\n\nSalt\n\nDomestic Gross: $118 million\n\nArriving two years after her action hit Wanted, this spy thriller hovered just outside the top 10 and managed to just outgross its $110 million budget in North America.\n\nThe Expendables\n\nDomestic Gross: $105 million\n\nSylvester Stallone led a band of action heroes in this early August title that tapped the nostalgia of moviegoers. A pair of sequels followed that would bring in more genre heavy hitters like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, Wesley Snipes, Chuck Norris, and Harrison Ford.\n\nEat Pray Love\n\nDomestic Gross: $80 million\n\nThis adaptation of a 2006 bestseller starring Julia Roberts brought in a sizable female audience and hit just over $200 million worldwide against a $60 million budget.\n\nDinner for Schmucks\n\nDomestic Gross: $73 million\n\nSteve Carell and Paul Rudd headlined this midsize hit that got mixed reviews. It has since turned into a bit of a cult favorite in subsequent years.\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World\n\nDomestic Gross: $31 million\n\nThere’s no question that I could have put this teen action romance in the misfires column as it made just a fraction of its $85 million price tag. However, the Edgar Wright title has since achieved significant status as an impressive original work with a major following.\n\nThe Kids Are All Right\n\nDomestic Gross: $20 million\n\nThis domestic dramedy became a major awards player and was nominated for Best Picture with acting nods going to Annette Bening, Julianne Moore, and Mark Ruffalo.\n\nMacGruber\n\nDomestic Gross: $8 million\n\nJust as with Pilgrim, this SNL spin-off with Will Forte was a financial bomb. Yet it has also turned into a cult classic and there’s a rumored sequel or TV spin-off in the making.\n\nWinter’s Bone\n\nDomestic Gross: $6 million\n\nThis indie mystery is notable for introducing Jennifer Lawrence to critics, if not a wide audience. Bone would earn the star her first Oscar nomination in addition to a Best Picture nod. Of course, Ms. Lawrence would break out in the next two years with the X-Men and Hunger Games series and her Oscar victory happened in 2012 with Silver Linings Playbook.\n\nAnd now for some movies that didn’t match their expectations:\n\nRobin Hood\n\nDomestic Gross: $105 million\n\nWith a budget that may have been as high as $200 million, Robin Hood reunited Russell Crowe with Ridley Scott. A decade earlier, they made Gladiator which was a giant hit that won Best Picture. As for this version of the oft told saga, it’s largely forgotten.\n\nSex and the City 2\n\nDomestic Gross: $95 million\n\nThe second installment cinematically of the beloved HBO series, part 2 made more than $50 million below its predecessor from 2008. Critics also savaged it.\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time\n\nDomestic Gross: $90 million\n\nA hoped for franchise for Disney, the $150 million fantasy pic couldn’t hit the century mark in North America. Lead Jake Gyllenhaal has since expressed his regret for doing it.\n\nThe A-Team\n\nDomestic Gross: $77 million\n\nA year after his breakthrough in The Hangover, this action pic based on the 1980s TV series didn’t quite turn Bradley Cooper (alongside Liam Neeson) into an action star. Audience mostly found it, well, expendable.\n\nKnight and Day\n\nDomestic Gross: $76 million\n\nTom Cruise and Cameron Diaz couldn’t provide enough star power for this action comedy to get near its budget north of $100 million.\n\nCats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\n\nDomestic Gross: $43 million\n\nPerhaps nine years was too long a break between sequels. The original family tale was an unexpected hit at $93 million in 2001, but the long gestating sequel didn’t gross half that number.\n\nJonah Hex\n\nDomestic Gross: $10 million\n\nThis DC Comics based title with Josh Brolin in the title role and Megan Fox was an instant flop, barely making eight figures against a $47 million budget. It also held a sad 12% Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n\nAnd that wraps up my looks at the summers of decades past, folks! I’ll have 1991, 2001, and 2011 recaps up in a year’s time…\n\nRate this:\n\nIn what has become tradition on this here blog, I use the summertime months to reflect on the cinematic seasons that came 30, 20, and 10 years prior. So while we wait for features to hit theaters in the summer of 2020 (something that is looking less and less certain), let’s take a gander at the hits, misses, and other significant product from the past.\n\nThe format is as follows: a rundown of the top ten hits as well as other noteworthy titles and some of the flops. We begin with 1990… a summer where we all got ghosted.\n\n10. Flatliners\n\nDomestic Gross: $61 million\n\nFresh off her star making role that spring in Pretty Woman, Julia Roberts teamed with then boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland in this psychological thriller from the late director Joel Schumacher. A far less successful 2017 remake would follow.\n\n9. Bird on a Wire\n\nDomestic Gross: $70 million\n\nDespite mostly poor reviews, the drawing power of Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn compelled this action comedy to a #1 debut and solid returns. Mr. Gibson wouldn’t fare as well later that summer when Air America with Robert Downey Jr. grossed less than half of Bird‘s earnings.\n\n8. Another 48 Hrs.\n\nDomestic Gross: $80 million\n\nThe re-teaming of Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte from their 1982 hit might have earned more than the predecessor, but $80 million was considered a bit of a letdown compared to expectations. The quality left a bit to be desired as well.\n\n7. Days of Thunder\n\nDomestic Gross: $82 million\n\nAnother high profile reunification is this racing pic with Tom Cruise and his Top Gun maker Tony Scott back together. While it wasn’t as successful as that blockbuster, it did just fine and it cast a mostly unknown actress named Nicole Kidman alongside her future (and eventually former) husband.\n\n6. Presumed Innocent\n\nDomestic Gross: $86 million\n\nHarrison Ford has had plenty of summer hits, but this adaptation of Scott Turow’s novel was a considerably more adult project that earned mostly rave reviews. The courtroom drama was a sizable earner considering its meager $20 million budget.\n\n5. Back to the Future Part III\n\nDomestic Gross: $87 million\n\nThe Western themed threequel arrived just six months after Part II. While it received better critical reaction, its gross of $87 million couldn’t match the $118 million of what preceded it.\n\n4. Dick Tracy\n\nDomestic Gross: $103 million\n\nWarren Beatty’s long in development version of the 1930s comic strip was a visual sight to behold. However, critical reaction was mixed. It managed to just outdo its reported $100 million budget stateside. Tracy provided a showcase for Beatty’s then flame Madonna and earned Al Pacino a Best Supporting Actor nod.\n\n3. Die Hard 2\n\nDomestic Gross: $117 million\n\nThe goodwill brought forth by the 1988 original allowed this decent sequel to outgross its predecessor and permit Bruce Willis to return in his signature role three more times. This would be the last Die Hard pic with the Christmas Eve theme as it scorched the summer charts.\n\n2. Total Recall\n\nDomestic Gross: $119 million\n\nOne year before he would rule the summer of 1991, Arnold Schwarzenegger had a massive hit with this sci-fi rendering of the Philip K. Dick short story. Recall also provided the first juicy role for Sharon Stone, who would become a sensation two years later in Basic Instinct.\n\n1. Ghost\n\nDomestic Gross: $217 million\n\nAt the start of the new decade, no one would have pegged Ghost to rule the summer frame. Made for $22 million, the supernatural romance ended up making over half a billion worldwide. A pottery themed love scene between stars Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore would become iconic, Whoopi Goldberg would win Best Supporting Actress for her psychic role, and it was nominated for Best Picture.\n\nAnd now for some noteworthy titles from the season:\n\nProblem Child\n\nDomestic Gross: $53 million\n\nJust outside the top 10 at 11, John Ritter headlined this tale of a rambunctious kid who just needs a family. Budgeted at a measly $10 million, it was a surprise performer that spawned two sequels.\n\nArachnophobia\n\nDomestic Gross: $53 million\n\nDoubling its budget, this black comedy about deadly black spiders received mostly praise from critics and had a nice showcase role for John Goodman as an exterminator.\n\nDarkman\n\nDomestic Gross: $33 million\n\nSam Raimi would eventually direct Spider-Man over a decade later and break box office records. Yet this original story (made for only $16 million) was a cult hit that introduced a lot of filmgoers to Liam Neeson. Two direct to video sequels would follow (minus Raimi behind the camera and Neeson in front of it).\n\nMo’ Better Blues\n\nDomestic Gross: $16 million\n\nThis jazz infused dramedy was Spike Lee’s follow-up to his groundbreaking Do the Right Thing one year prior. Blues received solid reviews, but is best remembered as the director’s first collaboration with Denzel Washington.\n\nAnd now for some pictures that didn’t match expectations either financially or critically or both (including a host of underwhelming sequels):\n\nRobocop 2\n\nDomestic Gross: $45 million\n\nIrvin Kerschner made one of the greatest part two’s ever with The Empire Strikes Back. He wasn’t so lucky here. It made slightly less than its 1987 predecessor and reviews weren’t nearly as positive.\n\nGremlins 2: The New Batch\n\nDomestic Gross: $41 million\n\nIt’s become a cult favorite since its release, but The New Batch grossed over $100 million less than the 1984 smash success.\n\nThe Exorcist III\n\nDomestic Gross: $26 million\n\nFollowing 17 years after the phenomenon that was the original, part 3 simply didn’t land with audiences or critics. This is another example of a sequel that would pick up more fans in subsequent years.\n\nGhost Dad\n\nDomestic Gross: $24 million\n\nSidney Poitier directed this supernatural comedy starring Bill Cosby. At the time, he had a smash TV comedy named after him. Yet audiences didn’t follow him to the multiplex for this critically drubbed effort.\n\nThe Freshman\n\nDomestic Gross: $21 million\n\nMarlon Brando seemed to have a fun time parodying his iconic Godfather role here alongside Matthew Broderick. It wasn’t a hit, but its reputation has grown since.\n\nThe Adventures of Ford Fairlane\n\nDomestic Gross: $21 million\n\nAndrew Dice Clay was one of the most popular and controversial stand up comics of this era, but his anticipated breakout to the silver screen landed with a thud.\n\nWild at Heart\n\nDomestic Gross: $14 million\n\nDavid Lynch’s follow-up to his heralded Blue Velvet starred Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. It garnered decidedly more mixed reaction from critics.\n\nThe Two Jakes\n\nDomestic Gross: $10 million\n\nJack Nicholson went behind the camera and reprised his acclaimed role as Jake Gittes from 1974’s Chinatown. This was a year following the star’s turn as The Joker in Batman, which dominated that summer. Audiences (and many critics) simply turned a blind eye to this long gestating sequel.\n\nAnd that’ll do it for now folks! I’ll have the summer of 2000 up shortly.\n\nRate this:\n\nMy recap of the summer seasons from 30, 20, and 10 years ago continues with 1999. It was a banner year for film in general with many acclaimed features hitting theaters at the turn of the century.\n\nIf you missed my previous post recounting 1989, you can find it here:\n\nhttps://toddmthatcher.com/2019/07/10/summer-1989-the-top-10-hits-and-more/\n\nAs with other look backs, I’ll give the top 10 highest earners along with other notable pics and some flops. Interestingly, the list begins at #10 with probably the most high profile misfire:\n\n10. Wild Wild West\n\nDomestic Gross: $113 million\n\nThe July 4th holiday weekend had literally become reserved space for Will Smith. Independence Day in 1996 and Men in Black the following year both came out in that frame and ended up as their summer’s biggest blockbusters. This update of a 1960s TV series cast the Fresh Prince with Kevin Kline and reunited him with MIB director Barry Sonnenfeld. Critics and audiences weren’t impressed.\n\n9. Notting Hill\n\nDomestic Gross: $116 million\n\nJulia Roberts and Hugh Grant were a rom com match in heaven with this well reviewed pic from the writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral. Our lead actress isn’t finished yet…\n\n8. The Blair Witch Project\n\nDomestic Gross: $140 million\n\nTruly a phenomenon upon release, this handheld camera indie supernatural horror tale was made for a reported $60,000. Many audience members thought it was a real documentary and it scared up nearly $250 million worldwide and spawned two lesser regarded follow-ups.\n\n7. Runaway Bride\n\nDomestic Gross: $152 million\n\nI told you we weren’t done with Julia Roberts. This rom com reunited her with her Pretty Woman director Garry Marshall and costar Richard Gere. It might not have captured the acclaim of that flick, but it made plenty of cash.\n\n6. The Mummy\n\nDomestic Gross: $155 million\n\nLoosely updating the 1932 classic, The Mummy managed to turn Brendan Fraser into a temporary action star. Two sequels followed and a spin-off (The Scorpion King) that turned Dwayne Johnson into an action hero.\n\n5. Big Daddy\n\nDomestic Gross: $163 million\n\n20 summers ago marked the height of Adam Sandler’s box office potency. Big Daddy remains his biggest live action grosser of all time.\n\n4. Tarzan\n\nDomestic Gross: $171 million\n\nDisney was still knocking traditional animated hits out summer after summer. Tarzan managed to nab Phil Collins an Oscar for a song contribution.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FajOWorHwZg\n\n3. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\n\nDomestic Gross: $206 million\n\nThe original Powers came out two summers prior. While it performed decently in theaters, it became a massive hit with its home video release. Due to that, this sequel made more in its opening weekend than part 1 achieved in its entire theatrical run. A third edition arrived in 2002.\n\n2. The Sixth Sense\n\nDomestic Gross: $293 million\n\nAn unexpected smash, this is the movie that introduced the world to M. Night Shyamalan and the line “I see dead people”. Bruce Willis didn’t get an Oscar nod, but the picture itself did. So too did Shyamalan’s direction, screenplay, and the supporting performances of Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.\n\n1. Star Wars: Episode 1 – The Phantom Menace\n\nDomestic Gross: $431 million\n\nIts reputation certainly hasn’t grown through the years, but George Lucas’s return to the cherished franchise after 16 years easily ruled the summer. We’re still haunted by Jar Jar two decades later.\n\nAnd now more some other notable titles from the ‘99 season:\n\nAmerican Pie\n\nDomestic Gross: $102 million\n\nThe raunchy teen comedy was a surprise smash that introduced us to a new group of young actors and spawned three theatrical sequels and four direct to DVD sequels.\n\nThe Haunting\n\nDomestic Gross: $91 million\n\nJan de Bont followed up mega hits Speed and Twister with this critically unappreciated remake of The Haunting of Hill House. It didn’t reach the heights of those blockbusters, but came close to the century mark domestically.\n\nDeep Blue Sea\n\nDomestic Gross: $73 million\n\nRenny Harlin’s tale involving sharks that could potentially cure Alzheimer’s (yes it’s absurd), Sea is best known for a killer death scene involving Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nThe Thomas Crown Affair\n\nDomestic Gross: $69 million\n\nArriving smack dab in the middle of his Bond run, this remake of Steve McQueen’s heist film was a solid midsize performer.\n\nBowfinger\n\nDomestic Gross: $66 million\n\nThe box office grosses were decent, but Bowfinger gave us a satisfying pairing of two comedic legends in Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin.\n\nEyes Wide Shut\n\nDomestic Gross: $55 million\n\nThe swan song of Stanley Kubrick (who died shortly before release), this dreamlike sexual drama with then married Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman polarized audiences and critics.\n\nSouth Park – Bigger, Longer and Uncut\n\nDomestic Gross: $52 million\n\nThe landmark Comedy Central show from Trey Parker and Matt Stone got the big screen treatment and translated well to the multiplex, even nabbing an Oscar nod for Best Original Song (“Blame Canada”).\n\nThe Iron Giant\n\nDomestic Gross: $23 million\n\nA commercial failure at the time, this animated pic marked the debut of Brad Bird who went onto helm Pixar classics. Its reputation has grown significantly in time.\n\nNow… let’s recount some flops:\n\nMickey Blue Eyes\n\nDomestic Gross: $33 million\n\nHugh Grant had a $100 million plus earner with Notting Hill, but this mob themed comedy was not a hit.\n\nMystery Men\n\nDomestic Gross: $29 million\n\nBen Stiller had the previous summer’s largest comedy with There’s Something About Mary. This failed superhero spoof didn’t even make half its budget back stateside.\n\nThe Astronaut’s Wife\n\nDomestic Gross: $10 million\n\nThis Johnny Depp sci fi thriller is not a title discussed often in his filmography or Charlize Theron’s. There’s a reason.\n\nDudley Do–Right\n\nDomestic Gross: $9 million\n\nThe Mummy provided Brendan Fraser with a franchise. This cartoon remake couldn’t hit double digits.\n\nAnd that wraps my recap! Look for 2009 on the blog shortly…\n\nRate this:\n\nIf nothing else, M. Night Shyamalan is audacious and I have always admired that. He likes to swing away at the cinematic fences and in Glass, he melds two of his pictures into a new universe. It’s ultimately not a very satisfying one, but the guy tries hard.\n\nAt the end of 2017’s Split, which returned the filmmaker to box office prominence, it was revealed that what we watched existed in the same realm of 2000’s Unbreakable. It did so by bringing in David Dunn (Bruce Willis). As you may recall, Dunn was the lone survivor of a train derailment who came to realize he was impervious to pain. Comic book store owner Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), suffering from a disease that cause his bones to break easily, surmised that David was a superhero. And Elijah was the arch nemesis as the 2000 flick revealed he was the evil mastermind behind the train going off the track.\n\nIn Split, we were introduced to James McAvoy’s Kevin and almost two dozen other characters that lived inside his head while he tormented teen girls that he kidnapped. From an annoying nine-year old boy to a OCD monster to a proper British dame, his personalities culminated with The Beast, who also possessed super human strength. The surprise ending suggested David will battle The Beast and low and behold – Split made more than enough money for that to occur.\n\nThis brings us to Glass. The first act allows this trio of characters to end up in the same mental institution with a psychiatrist (Sarah Paulson) attempting to dissuade them of their perceived powers. Dunn is sensitive to the possibility. The many voices of Kevin has his moments of doubt. Elijah, aka Mr. Glass, is so doped up that we’re not sure he knows what’s going on. However, fans of Unbreakable know the dude is a mastermind.\n\nGlass brings back other characters from its double source material. Charlayne Woodard returns as Elijah’s supportive to a troubling degree mother. Spencer Treat Clark is back as David’s now grown son (Robin Wright skipped out as his wife). And Anya-Taylor Joy reprises her Split role as Kevin’s surviving kidnap victim. Her story arch here is easily the most inexplicable one in a movie filled with often strange choices.\n\nMy feelings with Unbreakable and Split are a bit against the grain from many others. I actually dug the former 19 years ago while many found out it to be a disappointing follow-up to The Sixth Sense. As for the latter, I enjoyed McAvoy’s bonkers performance greatly but found it as a whole to be a mixed bag. The melding of the two worlds also fits that description. It’s got everything we expect from Shyamalan, including a twist ending or two. This time around, they land with less impact than earlier efforts.\n\nMcAvoy is still impressive, but we’ve seen this show before. Unbreakable set itself up perfectly for a world building sequel. Quite frankly, Glass made me realize I wish it hadn’t taken Split for us to get it. More of the Dunn/Elijah dynamic could have been rewarding without these other personalities in the way. Shyamalan’s personality shines through as always as he tries to overwhelm us with style and suspense. Like Split, the result is some memorable sequences amid numerous questionable ones and not the more cohesive whole that I found Unbreakable to be.\n\n**1/2 (out of four)\n\nRate this:"
