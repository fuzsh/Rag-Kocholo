        "text": "The Lighthouse is about to begin a season of 1999 films leading off with a fittingly offbeat tribute to Donald Sutherland by screening one of his finest 1970s film performances.\n\nA good deal of digital ink has been spilled valorising the year 1999 in cinema, even before we reached its 25th anniversary year. Sadly a lot of that copy conveniently overlooks the fact that many of the films being mentioned as a crucial part of the fabric of 1999 didn’t actually get released outside of America until the year 2000. Also, there is the truth that whenever we valorise a year we have to ignore most of it. As George Orwell said, from his time as a literary critic, most novels are not worth reading. The same is true for other cultural fields. Look at the year 1967 in music and you will find a lot of dross topping the charts at the same time as the classic hits that you suppose the year to have been, wall to wall.\n\nSuch curation is at work here, but curiously. There is something determinedly odd about this line-up, if you think back to the actual experience of film-going in that year. There is the absence of big hit after big hit; whether it is Austin Powers 2 and American Pie or The Sixth Sense and Fight Club or (eventually arriving in February 2000 trailing clouds of glory) Three Kings and American Beauty. The Phantom Menace, the biggest missing hit of all, recently got its own re-release, but even the critically acclaimed Sweet & Lowdown is in disgrace as well as Cronenberg’s eXistenZ. The choices are obscurantist, with a side of idiosyncratic. It’s all a bit akin to celebrating 1984 with a season of movies, and then leaving off Ghostbusters, Gremlins, Beverly Hills Cop, and Amadeus. People might doubt your commitment to sparkle motion.\n\nMeanwhile Loyalty+ members will not only get a wistful trip down memory lane onscreen, their wallets will also enjoy nostalgic ticket prices with season events at 1999 pricing (€4.99). Ah the good old days, when you could see a movie and get a burger afterwards – all from a tenner.\n\nThese are the films:\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (Monday 1st July 20:30)\n\nCruel Intentions (Saturday 6th July 21:00)\n\nEyes Wide Shut (Thursday 11th July 20:25)\n\nThe Talented Mr Ripley (Saturday 13th July 20:30)\n\nAll About My Mother (Wednesday 17th July 20:30)\n\nAudition (Thursday 18th July 20:30)\n\nBringing out the Dead (Friday 19th July 20:45)\n\nDrop Dead Gorgeous (Saturday 20th July 18:30)\n\nThe Straight Story (Sunday 21st July 18:00)\n\nBeing John Malkovich (Tuesday 23rd July 20:30)\n\nSummer of Sam (Wednesday 24th July 20:30)\n\nBut I’m a Cheerleader (Thursday 25th July 18:30)\n\nThe Mummy (Saturday 27th July 17:45)\n\nThe Iron Giant (Sunday 28th July 13:00)\n\nMagnolia (Sunday 28th July 16:45)\n\nGalaxy Quest (Tuesday 30th July 18:30)\n\nElection (Thursday 1st August 20:30)\n\nOffice Space (Friday 2nd August 18:30)\n\n10 Things I Hate About You (Sunday 4th August 18:15)\n\nThe Matrix (Saturday 10th August 21:00)\n\nBeau Travail (Tuesday 13th August 18:30)\n\nThe Virgin Suicides (Sunday 18th August 18:15)\n\nSleepy Hollow (Saturday 24th August 18:30)\n\nThe Blair Witch Project (Saturday 24th August 21:00)\n\nRatcatcher (Thursday 29th August 18:30)"
