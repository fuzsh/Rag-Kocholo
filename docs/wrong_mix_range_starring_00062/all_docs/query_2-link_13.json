        "text": "Who knew Jerry Springer could be that funny!\n\nWritten By: Michael McCullers & Mike Myers\n\nDirected By: Jay Roach\n\nI liked Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery, but Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is even better. It’s still not a great movie, but it is a very good movie that is really funny. I know I say it all the time, but if a movie is funny then I am happy, and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me was a lot of funny. Some of the jokes were recycled, they were the weakest aspect of the film, and there were still a couple of scenes that tried for emotional resonance and fell flat. But, overall it was a very funny movie and it worked on a different level than the first.\n\nAustin Powers: International Man Of Mystery wanted you to laugh at the jokes, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me doesn’t mind if you laugh at the jokes, but it’s more interested in getting you to laugh at the reactions of the characters. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is at its best when it presents an awkward joke or situation, creates a pause and waits for the reaction of the cast. Dr. Evil is the best at this, his character is full of terrific and off beat reactions that are funny every single time.\n\nReactions aren’t always the goal however, there are still scenes that are designed solely for easy laughs. The best sequence in the entire movie is in the beginning when Scott and Dr. Evil are on The Jerry Springer Show. If you don’t laugh at Dr. Evil losing it and going after a KKK member then I don’t know what’s wrong with you. The bleeped out swear words make that scene even funnier.\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me starts off and finishes strong. There are some jokes that fall flat and there is a fifteen minute stretch near the hour mark where it does drag for a bit. But, it is a very funny movie and is more consistently funny than Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery. This isn’t a movie that is going to revolutionize comedy, but Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is hilarious at times and funny throughout, that’s what comedies are supposed to be and it delivers.\n\nRating:\n\n***"
