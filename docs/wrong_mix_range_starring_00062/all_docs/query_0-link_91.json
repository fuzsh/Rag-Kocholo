        "text": "Sam Worthington on the red carpet in 2010 for \"The Debt\" at TIFF will be back this year for \"Cake\"\n\nThe 2014 Toronto International Film Festival is almost upon us, and I am putting the final touches on my trip there as we speak (or in this case, as you read... or if you are reading this after I have completed it.... a while ago).\n\nAlthough this years roster is widely regarded as the worst in a long time, perhaps ever, there are still names to be found this year, and as usual, I have compiled my list of MY Top 25 (not always the top 25 names...but the top 25 I am hopeful to get).\n\nThis years list consists of a bit of everything. From comedy icons like Bill Murray & Adam Sandler, to super hero action stars like Chris Evans, Andrew Garfield & Robert Downey Jr. There is even some true legends like Denzel Washington, Al Pacino & Morgan Freeman. Of course, a bunch of up & comers like Hailee Steinfeld, Chloe Grace Moretz & Ansel Elgort will be there as well. As well fan favorites like Robert Pattinson, musical icon Roger Waters, TV stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Jon Stewart and almost every variation in between. There is also a tonne of names you likely have never even heard of yet, and even I haven't...but in 2 or 3 or 5 years, you will know them.\n\nHere is MY top 25 list.\n\nYou can tell me in the poll below, or in my comments who you hope I will find there.\n\nTHE TOP 25\n\n1 JON STEWART - I have a 4 year streak of getting my top choice in tact. So there will be a lot of pressure on me to track down the host of The Daily Show for me. I have got Stephen Colbert & Conon O'Brien in the past few years. They are my 2nd & 3rd favorite active talk show hosts. Jon Stewart is my 1st, so this was a really exciting addition to the fest for me.\n\n2 BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH - Although I got Sherlock last year, after the original joy of getting him wore off some, and I looked at the \"autograph\" he gave me, I realized, it was not a very good one. So I am going back this year hoping to upgrade on the dreadful \"B.C. 2013\" he handed out to me last year.\n\n3 PETER SARSGAARD - Plain & simple. He was AMAZING in The Killing season 3 (if you have never watched it, do it), and the fact he didn't win, or was even nominated for the Emmy this year is still 1 of the largest crimes the Emmy Awards have had in the last few years.\n\n4 JANE FONDA - Went to a premiere for the 2X Oscar Winner a couple years ago, but she didn't show. Since then, I have become a big fan of her work on The Newsroom. So eager to get her this time... please don't no show again Jane.\n\n5 DENZEL WASHINGTON - His resume speaks for its self. If you don't consider him in your top 10, your doing it wrong.\n\n6 ADAM SANDLER - I have not seen Mr. Sandler since we were in a movie together almost 20 years ago. Cant wait to see my Happy Gilmore co-star again (I was in it for less than 2 seconds.. don't blink or you'll miss me both times)\n\n7 ANDREW SCOTT - Cant pass on a chance to get probably the best Sherlock nemesis there's been, Jim Moriarty.\n\n8 LAURA HARRIS - She would be in m6y top 2 if I knew for sure she was coming. One of 2 people on my list who is not confirmed yet. Fingers crossed on this one. Have still only ever managed 1 of the main 5 cast from Dead Like Me.\n\n9 KATE WINSLET - One of the very few female audience heavy movies I really liked was Titanic. An Oscar, 3 Golden Globes and even a Primetime Emmy for good measure. She is more than just Rose Dewitt Bukater.\n\n10 ANDREW GARFIELD - Spider Man, Spider Man hopefully will sign my stuff better than a spider can. Like his version of the character far more than Tobey Maguires.\n\n11 AMANDA SEYFRIED - This will be a redemption get if I get her. Missed her while she was in Vancouver for several weeks filming.\n\n12 CHLOE GRACE MORETZ - Only celeb I can think of that I have gotten in 3 different cities, and in 3 different situations. Too bad I already crossed off Toronto as a place.\n\n13 ROSARIO DAWSON - It saddens me that I somehow still only have autographs from 3 people from Grindhouse. Gotta nab a 4th hopefully.\n\n14 SAM WORTHINGTON - The nicest celeb I have ever met (if you are familiar with my Best & Worst Celebs list you know this). Haven't seen him in 4 years. Hoping to see he still holds that honour.\n\n15 CHRIS EVANS - Captain America has to be on a top 20 list for everyone. Met him briefly in Vancouver last year. As well in Toronto for TIFF a couple years ago. Will be happy to get him again though.\n\n16 ROBERT DOWNEY JR. - Iron Man. Sort of all I should have to say really.\n\n17 MORGAN FREEMAN - Pretty hard to imagine making a top 25 list for this year and it doesn't have Morgan Freeman on it.\n\n18 JOHN TRAVOLTA - Got his autograph about 20 years ago in a random encounter. Sadly it was on the back of a hockey poster because I had nothing of his. This time, I'll be prepared to see him.\n\n19 TOM HARDY - Since I got him while he was here shooting This Means War, his star has risen sharply. Excited to finally get a chance to get him again.\n\n20 ANTHONY MICHAEL HALL - All his 80s movies roles aside, its his work in 3 episodes of Psych last season that really put him on my list.\n\n21 VIGGO MORTENSEN - Got him at my 1st ever TIFF. At the time I didn't really know him from a lot of things. Now, I do and am actually looking forward to getting him now.\n\n22 HAILEE STEINFELD - A redemption get hopefully for not getting her last TIFF when she no showed.\n\n23 JENNIFER ANISTON - I opted to not go to her premiere last year. Hopefully I will get a 2nd chance this year.\n\n24 ROBERT DUVALL - I got him a couple years ago for a friend at a TIFF premiere. This time around, I will have my own stuff to get done.\n\n25 ROGER WATERS - Despite getting him multiple times in the past few years here in Vancouver, and no joke, passing on him the last time he was in Toronto while I was there, its hard to not put him on my top 25 list.\n\nHonourable mention - Ansel Elgort, Tobey Maguire, Robert Pattinson, Bill Nighy, Dustin Hoffman, Faye Marsay, Sam Claflin, Holliday Grainger, Simon Pegg, Christopher Plummer, Rosamund Pike, Tina Fey, Rose Byrne, John Cusack, Anna Kendrick., Mark Ruffalo, Steve Carell, Gael Garcia Bernal, Keira Knightley, Hayden Christiansen & Alan Rickman\n\nOf course there are even more that I HOPE will go that are so far, unconfirmed besides Mr. Hardy & Ms. Harris from my top 25 list.\n\nStanley Tucci, Josh Hutcherson, Steve Buscemi, Martin Scorsese, Natalie Dormer, Seth Rogen, Cary Elwes, Neil Young, Ray Liotta, Gillian Jacobs, Carrie Fisher, Zoe Saldana, Tuppence Middleton, Marion Cotillard, Moly Ringwald, Dolph Lundrgren, Kate Beckinsale, Thomas Sadoski, Bo Derek, Sienna Miller, Alec Baldwin, Melissa McCarthy, Adam Driver, Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell, Liam Neeson, Naomi Watts, James Caan, Danny Trejo, Kathy Bates, James Marsden, Will Ferrell, Linda Cardellini, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Tudyk.\n\nThe Toronto International Film Festival will take place from September 4-14, 2014 this year & includes films like\n\nTHE EQUALIZER (Antoine Fuqua) Denzel Washington, Chloe Moretz, Marton Csokas\n\nTHE JUDGE (director - David Dubkin) starring Al Pacino & Robert Downey Jr.\n\nA LITTLE CHAOS (Alan Rickman) Alan Rickman, Kate Winslet, Stanley Tucci\n\nMAPS TO THE STARS (David Cronenberg) Robert Pattinson, Julianne Moore, John Cusack, Sarah Gadon\n\nTHIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU (Shawn Levy) Tina Fey, Jason Bateman, jane Fonda\n\nFOXCATCHER (Bennett Miller) Anthony Michael Hall, Mark Ruffalo, Steve Carell, Channing Tatum\n\nROSEWATER (Jon Stewart) Gael Garcia Bernal, Jason Jones\n\nPlus 100s more. I will try to have blogs on each days adventures like I did past years. But due to the intense schedule of the event, they likely will not go up every day.\n\nMy 2013 TIFF saw me go 14/25 (got my technical #1 Benedict Cumberbatch... my original #1 Melissa Rauch did not come)\n\nMy 2012 TIFF saw me go 10/25 (got my #1 Johnny Depp)\n\nMy 2011 TIFF saw me go 9/30 (got my #1 Chloe Moretz though)\n\nMy 2010 TIFF saw me go 8/20 (got my #1 Michael C. Hall)\n\nWho do YOU hope I will get at TIFF? Vote here, leave comments below if your choice is not there.\n\nDay 2 started for me at the previously impossible Princess Of Wales Theatre. A venue everyone loathed, dreaded & hated with an utter passion for its lack of space for people to stand. Well, shocker of the festival.\n\nThe 1 thing TIFF seemed to do better this year than previously... they closed down Kings St & made the whole street an area to stand. This made it MUCH MUCH MUCH better. I'll someday have to thank Tom Hanks, who the rumour goes, is the one who complained about the old POW set up & said it was not fan friendly.\n\nThe 1st premiere of the day for me was a a film with Kristen Wiig, Sami Gayle & unfortunate no-show Hailee Steinfeld.\n\n\"Hateship Loveship\" The new set up was appealing to the stars, both of whom walked over & signed for a good portion of the crowd. I got 1 from each of them\n\nAfter an extended lunch break, my friends & I went back to POW to stake out a good spot for the next premiere. \"12 Years A Slave\" had lots of name appeal with Benedict Cumberbatch & Michael Fassbender starring in it. But it was 1 of the people who had a very small role in the film, and was a producer on it that drew the crowds out. Brad Pitt.\n\nI will say it right now. Brad was a champ. He got out of his car about 100 feet before the planned drop off area the TIFF personnel had set up so he could get out of his car & start signing. He signed for almost everyone that was in the 1st or 2nd row who could get an item near him.... of course, problem was, you couldnt move to save your life, as the street was at times, 10 people deep. So the hope of getting him & quickly moving to another spot was a fruitless venture. I managed 1, after he skipped me & I told him \"c'mon I've been here 2 & 1/2 hours\" which he stopped what he was doing, and said \"wheres the guy whos been here 2 & 1/2 hrs\" at the sae time I was saying to him \"Brad, please\" he clearly recognized the voice, and happily signed for me before going back to his stroll down the line. He must have signed for 20+ minutes.\n\nMichael Fassbender was also a champ on the carpet. Maybe not to the extent of Brad, but everyone that wanted 1 from him seemingly got him..\n\nOddly, the movies star Chiwetel Ejiofor not only didnt come over, but didnt even acknowledge the 1000s of people waiting.\n\nFrom there, I rushed over to the Nicole Kidman premiere just as she was working her way down the carpet. I chose a spot that had a nice 3-4 foot space between two morons on ladders in row 2 (yes, row 2.). The photogretards cried \"hes pushing\" to the security, then the 2 or 3 people in the row infront of him (you know, 2-3 feet away from him...enough room for 5 people to squeeze in, parroted his whining) & before I knew it, the security people were all standing around that area looking thru the crowd to see what was going on. Of course, there was going to be no time to explain why the 2 guys standing 4 feet from the carpet on 3+ ft ladders were in the wrong, so I just moved 3 feet over, but it was too late, as that space filled quickly with others & I never got near Kidman.\n\nFrom there I went & checked out the back of the POW for the Pitt movie leaving.\n\nI managed another Fassbender, but was disappointed when Benedict Cumberbatch, who must have arrived super late showed, and signed on 1 side, but didnt come over to our side. I, like several fans followed him. Great thing about T.O. downtown is, traffic doesnt go too fast sometimes. My friend & I caught up to him at a light 2 blocks away, he asked him if he could sign while they waited for the very long light. he declined saying \"not on the street\". We then attempted to find where he was going, but eventually our foot speed couldnt keep up with his SUV speed.\n\nWalking back, we stumbled across Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal having dinner before their film \"Prisoners\".\n\nA good crowd was already there, but with no one on high alert I found myself a nice row 2 spot behind a photographer right near the rear SUV door. In front was a little girl with just a notepad, so I asked her mom if she wanted a photo instead & gave them a photo of Hugh & Jake to get signed.\n\nJake did his best Jake Gyllenhaal impression & left without even lifting his head. But Hugh came out, and while the autographs were nothing even close to what I got 15 years ago, he signed a good 10-15 autographs on both sides of the exit.\n\nOn my side, he of course stopped, signed for the little girl which made her & her moms night. Then signed for me. Before he was about to get into the car I yelled at him about a girl standing behind me who was literally on her moms shoulders trying to get him. He turned, looked up & signed her magazine, then bent down, trying to look thru the crowd to say hi to the girls mom. Classy thing to do for someone who had a premiere to get to.\n\nI had a string of not so much luck for awhile. Getting to the Parkland premiere too late to find a good spot for Tom Welling and then got a spot for Zac Efron, but he skipped over me & stopped signing shortly afterwards.\n\nI ended my night going all the way up to Isabelle Bader theatre for the \"Last Robin Hood\" premiere with Susan Sarandon, Kevin Kline & Dakota Fanning. I missed Dakota & Susan going in, but saw Kevin. The Oscar award winner happily signed for those who asked. On the way out, Susan, another Oscar Winner came over to the whole TWO of us that were there & signed. However, the diva Dakota Fanning, who USED TO BE nice, snubbed us. Two people, and she didnt even muster a \"no\" or even a turn of her head to acknowledge someone was there. Well, guess whose film I WONT be going to see. Wonder how the production companies Big Indie Pictures & Killer Films would feel knowing her ONLY job there, promote their film, alienated people instead of promoted it.\n\nDakota Fanning should really take lessons from the two Academy Award Winning castmates she had in this film. Her turn to the dark side was 1 of the larger shocks to me of the festival.\n\nDay 2 - 7 autographs, 27 total\n\nA+ Brad Pitt\n\nA Michael Fassbender\n\nA Hugh Jackman\n\nA Susan Sarandon\n\nB+ Sami Gayle\n\nB Kristen Wiig\n\nB- Nicole Kidman\n\nC+ Benedict Cumberbatch\n\nF Jake Gyllenhaal\n\nF- Dakota Fanning\n\nYou can find my \"day 0\" report HERE\n\nYou can find my \"day 1\" report HERE"
