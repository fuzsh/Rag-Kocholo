The following 35 listed below, that were released in 2017, were the ones that stood out the most after several trips to the movie theater (or streams on Netflix and Amazon).\n\n35. The Meyerowitz Stories\n\nBen Stiller, Adam Sandler, Elizabeth Marvel and Dustin Hoffman\n\nIt’s very rare, in recent years, for me to even consider checking out an Adam Sandler. His team-up with director Noah Baumbach and Ben Stiller on Netflix changed that trend and reminded me, “Oh yeah. Sandler DOES have some actual acting chops.”\n\n34. The Hero\n\nSam Elliott, Nick Offerman, Laura Prepon and Krysten Ritter\n\nThe film starts with Sam Elliott (as a veteran Cowboy/Western actor) doing voice-overs for products that feel all too familiar to things he has actually been a spokesperson for. His chemistry with his on-screen pot dealer, Nick Offerman, is also well worth the ticket.\n\n33. The Greatest Showman\n\nHugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams and Zendaya\n\nWhile the story is lacking and some lip-synching can be cringe worthy, the music and Hugh Jackman’s enthusiasm were too good to deny The Greatest Showman from this list.\n\n32. Kong: Skull Island\n\nTom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly\n\nYes, Kong was entertaining as hell. John C. Reilly steals the show, the music is excellent, and the references to the future World Champion Chicago Cubs were a fine example of some fun writing.\n\n31. American Made\n\nTom Cruise, Domhnall Gleason and Jesse Plemons\n\nSign me up for any iteration and telling of the Pablo Escobar story. Narcos on Netflix set the standard, Bryan Cranston’s The Infiltrator was extremely underrated and now this perspective of the American drug smuggling effort was too riveting to not enjoy.\n\n30. Beauty and the Beast\n\nEmma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans and Ewan McGregor\n\nDisney hasn’t messed with their recent live-action remakes (i.e. The Jungle Book from last year). They didn’t miss a step with the new Beauty and the Beast and now all the songs from the original animated film are stuck in my head again.\n\n29. The LEGO Batman Movie\n\nWill Arnett, Rosario Dawson and Zach Galifianakis\n\nWill Arnett in LEGO form > Ben Affleck as Batman.\n\n28. The Lost City of Z\n\nCharlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland and Sienna Miller\n\nThis story of exploration is only enhanced by the gritty “Jax Teller” voice storytelling by Charlie Hunnam, and the constant worry that anyone could be hit with a blow-dart or arrow from their canoes.\n\n27. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n\nChris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista\n\nIt wasn’t the best Marvel movie this year (as you’ll see by scrolling down) but Guardians 2 didn’t disappoint with humor, music and over-the-top action.\n\n26. John Wick: Chapter 2\n\nKeanu Reeves, Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne\n\nThe John Wick series pretty much blows the one-man-wrecking crew genre away (Taken, The Equalizer, or any other Liam Neeson film).\n\n25. Good Time\n\nRobert Pattinson, Benny Safdie and Jennifer Jason Leigh\n\nThe mood of Good Time is like a horror film, and Robert Pattinson keeps viewers on a non-stop ride of suspense.\n\n24. Molly’s Game\n\nJessica Chastain, Idris Elba and Kevin Costner\n\nWatch for Jessica Chastain’s performance, Aaron Sorkin’s writing and the unbelievably intriguing sports story…and try not to let Michael Cera bother you too much.\n\n23. Free Fire\n\nBrie Larson, Armie Hammer, Cillian Murphy and Sharlto Copley\n\nFree Fire had one of my absolute favorite casts, ridiculously entertaining banter and action, and the surprise ending I didn’t realize I hoped for.\n\n22. Phantom Thread\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis, Leslie Manville and Vicky Krieps\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis’ last film isn’t necessarily his best, but his acting and the force that he and Leslie Manville his bring to the screen made Phantom Thread a very worthwhile watch.\n\n21. Call Me By Your Name\n\nTimothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer and Michael Stuhlbarg\n\nThe Best Picture nominee is a beautiful and heartbreaking love story, which leaves you wanting to instantly book one-way trip to Italy.\n\n20. Split\n\nJames McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy and Haley Lu Richardson\n\nThe 2nd installment of the Unbreakable series is a great comeback thriller for M. Night Shyamalan. If you check Split‘s IMDB page, James McAvoy has 9 characters listed and he probably plays more.\n\n19. Wind River\n\nJeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen and Jon Bernthal\n\nA great murder mystery with intense moments that come out of nowhere. I’m not sure Jeremy Renner makes bad movies anymore.\n\n18. Blade Runner 2049\n\nRyan Gosling, Harrison Ford and Jared Leto\n\nThis long awaited sequel was one of the best movie theater experiences of the year. Sound, visuals and suspense made the wait worth it.\n\n17. Darkest Hour\n\nGary Oldman, Ben Mendelsohn and Lily James\n\nGary Oldman should and will win Best Actor at the Oscars, but the film’s marketing doesn’t give enough credit to the performances by the rest of the cast. Lily James pulls the heart strings and Ben Mendelsohn is powerful when he needed to be as King George.\n\n16. Logan Lucky\n\nChanning Tatum, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig\n\nI refers to itself as Oceans 7-11, but it was vastly more entertaining than 12 and 13 combined. I’ll take any and all NASCAR-heist sequels with this cast that Steven Soderbergh wants to make.\n\n15. The Post\n\nTom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Bob Odenkirk and Michael Stuhlbarg\n\nTom Hanks and Meryl Streep were good, but Bob Odenkirk, Carrie Coon and the rest of the supporting cast were great. It’s just hard difficult to follow newspaper films like Spotlight and All The President’s Men.\n\n14. Spider-Man: Homecoming\n\nTom Holland, Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr. and Zendaya\n\nHot Take Alert: Tom Holland is a better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Michael Keaton was an excellent Marvel villain. And this was an excellent YA genre movie.\n\n13. Dunkirk\n\nTom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branaugh and Cillian Murphy\n\nIt’s surprising that Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan’s first Oscar nominated film, but it’s worthy of it. It’s hard to breathe the entire film, for multiple reasons, but feels great when you finally come up for air at the end…Also, try watching this and Darkest Hour back-to-back. History Channel wishes they could pull that off.\n\n12. Wonder Woman\n\nGal Gadot, Chris Pine and David Thewlis\n\nWonder Woman is what happens when DC finally lets a great director (like Patty Jenkins) tell a great Superhero story. Gal Gadot’s innocence and genuine approach to the hero made it even better…I still try to picture how much better it could have been with Alan Rickman (skypoint) could have starred as the villain.\n\n11. Coco\n\nAnthony Gonzalez, Gael Garcia Bernal and Benjamin Bratt\n\nVisually, one of the most stunning PIXAR films to date and an incredible original story, that gives a voice to an underrepresented culture in the genre. The music is great as well.\n\n10. Star Wars: The Last Jedi\n\nDaisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Mark Hamil\n\nI don’t care if this film ruined Star Wars for you. That’s on you and your weird expectations. It was funny, emotional, uplifting and full of the fist-pump moments I ask for from these films.\n\n9. Logan\n\nHugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen\n\nYou guys…a Wolverine movie got an Academy Award nomination…That’s how good this movie is, and it was a perfect exit for Hugh Jackman from the franchise.\n\n8. The Florida Project\n\nWillem Dafoe, Brooklynn Prince and Bria Vinaite\n\nWillem Dafoe deserves all the accolades he gets for The Florida Project, but the kids (led by Brooklynn Prince) made the curiosity, imagination and nostalgia feel so incredibly natural…set in the motels outside Disney World.\n\n7. Thor: Ragnarok\n\nChris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Tessa Thompson\n\nThor: Ragnorak was a great payoff for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans that have watched this long, ginormous series since the beginning in 2008. The clash (and eventual team-up) with The Hulk was perfect, Cate Blanchett was an excellent villain, Tom Hiddleston reminded us why we can’t quit Loki, and it was the funniest movie of the year.\n\n6. Lady Bird\n\nSaoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Beanie Feldstein and Timothee Chalamet\n\nIf it weren’t for Frances McDormand, Saoirse Ronan would be cleaning up the Lead Actress awards, but Laurie Metcalf deserves to take home Best Supporting Actress. The mother-daughter dynamic is moving, Beanie Feldstein is a breakout star, and Sacramento has never seemed so interesting.\n\n5. The Big Sick\n\nKumail Nanjiani, Zoe Kazan, Holly Hunter and Ray Romano\n\nRomComs are really going to need to step their game up after The Big Sick. The story of Kumail Nanjiani and his actual wife (Emily V. Gordon) will make you feel every emotion, Holly Hunter reminds everyone of how their mom handles any illness they have, and Ray Romano…well, Ray’s got some great moments.\n\n4. Baby Driver\n\nAnsel Elgort, Lily James, Jamie Fox and Jon Hamm\n\nThis was the most entertaining movie I had seen, from start to finish. I own the soundtrack on vinyl, it was that good. And Jon Hamm needs to play more villains. The third act was like another movie, and excellent because of him.\n\n3. Get Out\n\nDaniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams and Bradley Whitford\n\nI applaud Jordan Peele after every accolade this film is recognized for. It took horror to a new stratosphere, practically creating the “social thriller” genre. And I’ll never forget how the theater I watched it in gave a standing ovation for that ending.\n\n2. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\nFrances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell\n\nA year ago, Manchester by the Sea was my favorite film for many of the reasons Three Billboards is this high up for me now. It makes you laugh, then rips your heart out, puts it back in, lets you laugh again, then repeat. In the end, you’re not sure how to feel about any of the characters, but they are all worth investing in.\n\n1. The Shape of Water\n\nSally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer\n\nIt was so difficult to choose a favorite, but at the end of the day The Shape of Water stood above the rest. It’s an amazing love story. It’s imaginative, strange, heartfelt, beautiful and weird. It pays its respects to films of old, and makes a case for similar treatment years ahead. Also, it’s another nominated film with Michael Stuhlbarg…who stars in 3 this year.\n\nWhat was your favorite film this year? Let me know on Twitter at @Mike_PiFF03.\n\nIt took until 2016 to get this list done, but that’s the price of being thorough…and loving movies.\n\nI released a list at the end of the summer and another before the holidays. Of course, studios waited till Christmas and after to release some of the most anticipated films of the year. Just in time for the announcement of this year’s Oscar nominees, here are my Top 25 – The films I liked, really liked, and loved.\n\n25. Carol\n\nIt’s elegant and shot beautifully. Cate Blanchett has the title character but Rooney Mara is the one you’re invested in. I would have loved to see this film shot decades ago with Audrey Hepburn in Mara’s role. Kyle Chandler’s classic look would have fit in nicely. Also enjoyed the appearance from Cory Michael Smith who is currently The Riddler on FOX’s Gotham. It’s fitting.\n\n24. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation\n\nIt was a strong year for blockbuster franchises. There are two more represented further down this list. The Mission Impossible series seems to get better as time goes on and fortunately for them, Rogue Nation hit theaters before Spectre did with a similar plot and much better execution.\n\n23. Beasts of No Nation\n\nIdris Elba seems to show us in everything he does that he is one of the best actors of our time, and this Netflix Original film gets him closer to the acclaim he properly deserves. Beasts of No Nation is also a milestone for Netflix that shows they should be taken seriously as a film studio and not just for television…Just try to avoid the string of unfortunate Adam Sandler flicks they will be putting out for a while.\n\n22. Creed\n\nCreed is a very good sports movie. It reminded me a lot of the first Rocky film. I love how they filmed the fights and Sylvester Stallone deserves every “best supporting actor” nomination he gets. We’re reminded how great an actor he is, and how awesome a character Rocky Balboa is in this film. Michael B. Jordan is certainly in store for big things and this film is a clear sign of that. I just wished they held back on the cheese factor of a certain training scene and that his “big opponent” was a much more memorable character.\n\n21. Trumbo\n\nThe acting in Trumbo is outstanding. The hype was real regarding Bryan Cranston’s performance. Both Helen Mirren and John Goodman play their parts very well. The correlation between how members of the American communist party were treated and some of our society’s current issues today strikes a chord. I just wish I hadn’t seen so many of the big scenes in the trailer already and that the directing was better.\n\n20. The Big Short\n\nThe more I think about The Big Short, the more I think I liked it. Christian Bale, Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling are all awesome in the film and it’s incredibly smart. Hamish Linklater is also an excellent complement, similar to his role in The Crazy Ones with Robin Williams. The constant explaining of every economic term (which might have been necessary) gets distracting and the comedic approach takes away some of the necessary emotional investment. Had I not seen 99 Homes, I probably would have appreciated this film a lot more while watching it.\n\n19. 99 Homes\n\nLike The Big Short, 99 Homes takes place during the financial and housing crisis but it’s way much more of a punch to the gut. You get the perspective of people who lost their homes from the crisis, and it’s even more of a thriller because you have no idea how these people will react to those who have to break the news to them. Michael Shannon is also as good as anyone in supporting actor categories from this film.\n\n18. Straight Outta Compton\n\nThe music, the acting, the “Bye Felicia” scene…\n\nStraight Outta Compton was an awesome biopic and it told a story that I think a lot of younger hip hop fans needed to hear, considering how influential members of NWA really are to the genre. The only reason I don’t have it ranked higher is because it did feel long by the end.\n\n17. Love & Mercy\n\nLove and Mercy was another biopic (also with Paul Giamatti as a jerk manager) that I enjoyed, but this one stuck with me a lot longer after. Paul Dano is great as young Brian Wilson and for once John Cusack is a lot less “John Cusack”-ish than he is in most of his roles. Elizabeth Banks also gives one of the more underrated performances in film from this year. If you’re like me, you probably listened to “Pet Sounds” for a week after seeing it.\n\n16. The Walk\n\nI’m a little disappointed The Walk isn’t getting more chatter during awards season. Obviously I think there are better films, but Robert Zemeckis did a brilliant job utilizing 3D, especially for the climax of the film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ben Kinglsey were both remarkably charming as well.\n\n15. The Hateful Eight\n\nIt’s not Quentin Tarantino’s best, but “Not Tarantino’s Best” is still better than most. The second half of the film was up there with some of his most entertaining…and bloodiest. For me, this was Walton Goggins’s coming out party on the big screen. Loved him in Justified and The Shield. I think it’s obvious Tarantino did too.\n\n14. Mississippi Grind\n\nIt was too appropriate that I watched this film while waiting to hear my lottery numbers called. Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn has the All-American Asshole role down between this and Bloodline, yet knows just how to make you feel for him. Sure, Ryan Reynolds plays another good-looking fast talker, but his whole “who, what, and why” deal keeps you as intrigued as the constant gambling…which is enough drama by itself.\n\n13. Ex Machina\n\nThis was a big year for all 3 stars of Ex Machina. Oscar Isaac continued his path to Pacino-status with his roles in Show Me A Hero and Star Wars, which Domhnall Gleeson also stars in (as well as Brooklyn and The Revenant). Alicia Vikander has a good chance of getting both Best Actress and Supporting Oscar nominations for her roles in The Danish Girl and Ex Machina. Her character, Ava, still haunts my dreams as well. It’s an unreal suspense film.\n\n12. The End of the Tour\n\nI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again…I can’t recall a time where I’ve seen two actors be so natural interacting with each other for a film. That’s all this film is…a long weekend conversation from Bloomington-Normal to Minnesota and back, with honest thoughts and feelings. I’m happy to see Jason Segel is getting some acclaim as well for his portrayal of David Foster Wallace.\n\n11. Steve Jobs\n\nYes, I’m a HUGE Sorkin fan, but I found the approach to this biopic to be incredibly original. It wasn’t your typical “start-to-end” story, but just 3 different periods in time and how each person has evolved in that time. It also helps that everyone involved nails it with their parts, especially Michael Fassbender.\n\n10. Brooklyn\n\nIf anyone is challenging Brie Larson for Best Actress, it’s Saoirse Ronan. She and Brooklyn do an amazing job of making you feel all the emotions you can muster. It also helps that two of my TV crushes, Emily Bett Rickards (Felicity Smoak, Arrow) and Jessica Paré (Megan Draper, Mad Men), have solid roles in the film. The contrast in two worlds during the 1950s and how Eilis (Ronan) evolves is what makes the film.\n\n09. Inside Out\n\nA movie about feelings makes you feel feelings…and even more than the typical Pixar feelings (which is saying a lot, considering the first 3 minutes to Up). It also helps that they casted all the right people for all the right feelings.\n\n08. The Martian\n\nI came across a Facebook friend listing his “Top 10” and he said he hadn’t seen The Martian because “It looked like Castaway in space.” He is very wrong…unless he values Jeff Daniels, Donald Glover, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Michael Pena, Jessica Chastain, and Kate Mara to all be a volleyball named Wilson. There’s also a Lord of the Rings reference that probably won the film “Best Comedy” at the Golden Globes by itself.\n\n07. The Revenant\n\nI have a very difficult time seeing anyone other than Leonardo DiCaprio winning Best Actor at the Oscars. Maybe Bryan Cranston, but Leo will be SO pissed if he doesn’t because of everything he went through for this film…It’s pretty evident.\n\n06. Room\n\nThe Best Actress category at any awards show is Brie Larson’s to lose because of Room. Jacob Tremblay is amazing as well…just be prepared to have your heart strings pulled hard.\n\n05. Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is a 2 hour long roller coaster of action, explosions, and rock’n’roll. I don’t recall taking a breath between the start and end. The twisted and beautiful mind of George Miller is on full awesome display.\n\n04. Me and Earl and The Dying Girl\n\nI think we all have our personal movies that connect with us in more ways than most and matches our personalities. Me and Earl and The Dying Girl was that movie for me, my favorite from the summer. There’s also something about Nick Offerman as a sociology professor, robe-wearing, cat-obsessed dad that still tickles me funny.\n\n03. Bridge of Spies\n\nBridge of Spies is about as good a film as you could ask for from a combination of Steven Spielberg and the Coen Brothers…I was pleasantly surprised to see that the latter wrote the movie once the closing credits rolled. It was all meant for someone like Tom Hanks to lead in. There is one scene toward the end that I found to be as powerful as any in 2015.\n\n02. Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nThe best way I’ve heard The Force Awakens described is that it hit all the right spots in all the right ways…It really did. Nostalgia and newness brilliantly combined. Fantastic well-timed humor that the past films lacked. If you waited for something to disappoint you, you’d only be disappointed by the fact that you’re still waiting. It’s also the only other film, besides #1, that I went back to see in the theater again and appreciated more for it.\n\n01. Spotlight\n\nI really don’t think there was a better performance by an ensemble this year. It was a refreshing take on journalism, not over-glorifying the industry but simply presenting how a paper goes about getting a story. All the comparisons to All The President’s Men are warranted. I will also stump hard for Mark Ruffalo getting Best Supporting Actor recognition, even when the category is heavy enough as is.\n\nWhat does your list look like? Let me know on Facebook or Twitter!\n\nIt’s hard to put together a “Top 10” when we’re 7 and a half months into the year and Oscars season hasn’t hit. I’m also not the one handing out any Golden Globes or Academy Awards, so that’s why I prefer saying “Favorite” when putting this list together.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nTomorrowland\n\nTomorrowland was a refreshing original from Disney that we hadn’t seen in a while that doesn’t have “PIXAR” all over it. In a world (voice-over guy voice) when franchises and sequels rule all, director and writer Brad Bird told a story that combined a mixture of our fascination with the future and a deep seeded love many of us may have from our very first visit to Epcot at Disney World. George Clooney and Britt Robertson play characters who shine for their innovative minds, while Hugh Laurie antagonizes with some of the bleakest/best lines of the movie:\n\n“There are simultaneous epidemics of obesity and starving – how is that even possible?!”\n\nI also enjoyed the hat-tip to old animated Disney character names with Keegan-Michael Key as “Hugo” (Hunchback of Notre Dame) and Kathryn Hahn as “Ursula” (The Little Mermaid).\n\nChild 44\n\nNot too many people liked this movie, but I did. Tom Hardy reunites with Gary Oldman for the first time since Dark Knight Rises and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. They are two of the better actors in the business and it shows in this film. The story is incredible. The film opens with a line that is repeated throughout, “The is no murder in paradise.” Russia banned this film because of how it portrayed its citizens who live in fear of their government. I won’t get into real global politics, but imagine a world where a serial killer can roam free because law enforcement isn’t allowed to admit there is a problem. This film frustrates the viewer because of that, but the dodging and weaving Hardy must execute is what makes the movie fascinating to me.\n\nPeople Places Things\n\nYou know how awkward and painful The-Breakup is? People Places Things took the subject of breaking up and made it suck WAY LESS. When Jermaine Clement isn’t voicing over super annoying horses on a beach with Hannah Davis, he’s a terrific indie comedy actor. On top of being “Weekend Fun” Dad of the year, Clement’s character is a graphic novelist whose art serves as interludes for the story. Regina Hall (Scary Movie) and Jessica Williams (The Daily Show) give excellent supporting performances and so do the kids, Aundrea and Gia Gadsby.\n\nThe List\n\n10. Avengers: Age of Ultron\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron wasn’t great and wasn’t even the best Marvel film of this year…but it didn’t have to be. I understand Joss Whedon really beat himself up over the pressures of making a follow up to the first Avengers flick, but his final product was exactly what I wanted. James Spader NAILED IT as Ultron, and it was so creepy how the robot featured his mannerisms. The Marvel Cinematic Universe and its timeline of films are basically a long TV series of epic 2 hour episodes. The ongoing story evolved well in Age of Ultron, and we got all the action, witty banter, and intros to new characters that we needed…before things get really hairy in Captain America: Civil War.\n\n9. Ant-Man\n\nI had some personal investment in Ant-Man, because I wanted it to surprise people for how good it could be. After opening weekend, there was much chest-pounding and “Told ya!” from me and I am totally shameless about it. The Ant-Man story in the MCU has been rearranged, as Hank Pym was the one who originally assembled The Avengers in the comics and also created Ultron. The film was also more of a “changing of the guard” than an origin story, as Hank (Michael Douglas) was passing the suit on to Scott Lang (Paul Rudd).\n\nRather than be an action film with some comedy, Ant-Man was a comedy with plenty of action. I LOVED that about the film. I died laughing every time Michael Pena was on screen and I appreciated the fact Paul Rudd didn’t have to try being someone else (like Chris Pratt had to for Jurassic World ). It was a fun one-off movie that still moved the Marvel story along and concluded with an awesome scene after the credits.\n\n8. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation\n\nThe latest in the Ethan Hunt/IMF saga did not disappoint. Rogue Nation continued the fun-spy-stunt vibe that many of us loved in Ghost Protocol, but established itself as its own film more than a sequel. Tom Cruise may be a crazy person in real life, but on the screen he is good an action star as any. This installment didn’t really force a love story on you either but more of a mutual respect between Hunt and MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), that may or may not have led to some natural attraction. Faust was a badass character in this film too.\n\n07. Straight Outta Compton\n\nI walked out of the theater with one thought: “Helluva story.” The NWA biopic directed by Friday director F. Gary Gray grabs a hold of the viewer, gets the head bobbing/toe tapping, and reminds many of us (who grew up or lived in the era that revolutionized hip-hop) of what was going on in the streets. It’s a long film, but it’s almost like 3 different stories mashed into one following Eric “Eazy-E” Wright, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube. I do feel that the stories regarding Ice Cube and Dr. Dre were cleaned up a little because they were producers on the film, but that was expected.\n\nOshea Jackson Jr. playing his father felt perfect and both Corey Hawkins (Dr. Dre) and Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E) gave excellent performances. You really do get chills when both Snoop Dogg and Tupac are introduced. And of course Paul Giamatti settles in fine as his now typical a-hole manager role.\n\n6. Love & Mercy\n\nSpeaking of Giamatti a-hole manager roles…Love & Mercy edges out Straight Outta Compton for me because Paul Dano gives one of the definite Oscar-worthy performances from this summer as a young Brian Wilson. I do recommend listening to Pet Sounds before watching the movie, and then become amazed at how wrong Wilson’s father and Mike Love were about the album when the Beach Boys originally recorded it. The process Wilson goes through composing his music makes you say “Wow” out loud.\n\nMy one fear going into the theater was John Cusack mailing in another gig where he seems like “John Cusack as John Cusack…as (insert historical figure)”. Nope. I actually forgot at times that it was Cusack as the older version of Wilson. I also have to say that Elizabeth Banks pulls off one of the more powerful scenes as someone standing up to a threatening jackass bully like Giamatti’s character. I may have slow clapped as it happened.\n\n5. Ex Machina\n\nEx Machina is one of the great surprises of 2015. Throughout the entire film, you are so unsure as to when something is going to go wrong and who is really in control. The robot, Ava (played by Alicia Vikander), has you on a string and you can’t do anything about it. Oscar Isaac’s performance adds to the suspense like a time bomb waiting to explode. Then, when the credits roll at the end, you have no idea if you should be afraid of the technology you rely so much on (i.e. cell phones, Google, EVERYTHING). A movie that makes you question such things, because they are sort of plausible, is undeniable as a great thriller.\n\n4. Inside Out\n\nDammit, Pixar…You made us feel feelings again, which I guess is expected in a film LITERALLY about feelings. Inside Out really is the emotional roller coaster that it’s advertised as. It is casted masterfully for each of the different character “feelings” in young Riley’s (Kaitlyn Dias) head. The two characters that felt dead on to their real-life counterparts were Sadness (Phyllis Smith) and of course Anger (Lewis Black). What made the film this good though, was how it reminded the viewer how important and natural each of your feelings can be, no matter your age. High five for deep overall messages, Pixar.\n\n3. The End of the Tour\n\nThe film is based on a 5-day interview between Rolling Stone writer David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) and author David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel) following the release of ‘Infinite Jest’ in 1996. The reason I hold this film in such high regard is because it felt like the most honest interaction between two people given their statuses and positions. Their humor, insecurities, competitiveness, and self awareness hit home with me, and Segel captured that the best as Wallace. It’s also funny now that movies taking place in the 90’s can now be considered period pieces and I giggled every time Segel asked for a Diet-Rite.\n\n2. Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is the fastest 2 hours you’ll ever experience in a movie theater. Once the vehicles, spawned from the sick and beautiful mind of George Miller, hit the desert road, your breath is held for the remainder of the ride. Visually, it was like nothing I had seen before. It was pure action, adventure, and horror. You also didn’t have to see any of the other films to pick up on Fury Road. Charlize Theron kicked everybody’s ass as Furiosa. And who doesn’t love an army of hell-bred maniacs being led by a Heavy Metal guitarist whose axe shoots real flames out of it?\n\n1. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\n\nNaming something #1 says a lot about whatever it is you are actually ranking. When you you make the proclamation though, you stand by it (like when you rank 40 different pizza places and everybody loses their minds in the comments section).\n\nAs of August 15th at 5:34 PM CDT, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is my favorite movie of 2015. I laughed, I connected, I cried, I laughed again, and repeat. I wanted Earl (RJ Cyler) to be my “coworker”. I wanted to hangout with Rachel (Olivia Cooke) and talk about how awesome Hugh Jackman ALWAYS is as Wolverine. I was Greg (Thomas Mann) in high school, to an extent, and I wanted to tell him things don’t turn out so bad. The supporting cast is incredible in this film as well with Nick Offerman, Connie Britton, Jon Bernthal, Molly Shannon, and the dude who plays Earl’s brother (Bobb’e J. Thompson).\n\nIt’s also a film about kids who love movies. I love movies. Weird how someone would relate with something like that, right?\n\nHave a favorite film that didn’t make the list? What does your “Favorite 10” look like? Let me know on Facebook or Twitter."
