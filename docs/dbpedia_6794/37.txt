One evening in 1954, Marylin Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and Senator Joseph McCarthy gathered in Albert Einstein’s New York City hotel room to excitedly monologue at one another about subjects like fame, sex, motherhood, baseball, communism, and the precise shape of the universe. Or at least that’s what happens in Nicolas Roeg’s 1985 Insignificance. It’s basically the film adaptation of a stage play adaptation of one of those corny posters that imagines Marylin Monroe, Elvis Presley, Humphrey Bogart, and James Dean hanging out at a Soda Shop and being all, you know, iconic and stuff. But it is Roeg, and it is based on a play, it might just be...kind of deep? Join us for a listen and find out the film fulfills that implied promise.

If you’d like to watch ahead for next week’s film, we will be discussing and reviewing Shohei Imamura’s Vengeance Is Mine (1979).
