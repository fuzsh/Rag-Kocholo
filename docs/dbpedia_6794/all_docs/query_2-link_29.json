        "text": "New York Shorts International Film Festival is one of the largest showcases of short films in North America. Featuring a wide spectrum of film genres from emerging to established filmmakers around the world. New York Shorts has become a career stepping stone, establishing a tradition of discovering and promoting filmmakers who have gone on to be Academy Awards Nominees. NY Shorts offers short-form filmmakers an ideal platform to screen their film and gain recognition in the heart of New York City. In 2012 NY Shorts premiered Ricky Gervais ‘Derek”, which became a popular British television show picked up by Netflix. NY Shorts events include receptions, as well as workshops with industry experts and top filmmaking professionals sharing their practical advice to attending filmmakers. The heart of the festival is the quality and scope of extraordinary film programming to enthusiastic audiences in the vibrant filmmaking enclave of New York City. NY Shorts feels that short-form cinema and its creators should have their own premiere film festival in New York deserving similar recognition given to the feature film and its creators.\n\nFounded by two independent filmmakers who learned first-hand how hard it can be to find an independent film an audience, Manhattan Film Festival has become one of the largest, truly independent film festivals in the world. MFF has a seventeen-year history of fearless programming. Hosted in the media capital of the world, they have never backed down, and will always defend and promote the creative freedom of independent filmmakers. The festival will again be hosted at Cinema Village just steps from Union Square. The famous Cinema Village marquee has been featured in film and television productions including Martin Scorsese’s “The Departed” and David Chase’s “The Sopranos.” MFF has been named by MovieMaker Magazine as one of the “Coolest Film Festivals in the World,” “25 Film Festivals Worth the Entry Fee,\" and \"Top 100 Best Reviewed\" on FilmFreeway!"
