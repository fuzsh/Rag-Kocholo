        "text": "Luca Guadagnino‘s “Queer” has been selected for New York Film Festival‘s spotlight gala. The romantic drama, starring Daniel Craig as an American expat in Mexico City who becomes infatuated with a younger man, will make its U.S. premiere at Alice Tully Hall on Oct. 6.\n\n“Luca Guadagnino is one of contemporary cinema’s most versatile filmmakers, and one of its biggest risk-takers,” said Dennis Lim, artistic director of New York Film Festival. “’Queer’ is his most fearless, inventive, and surprising film, one that brings its subcultural world to brilliant life and creates the role of a lifetime for a tremendous Daniel Craig.”\n\n“Queer,” adapted from William S. Burrough’s novel, was written by Justin Kuritzkes and co-stars Drew Starkey, Jason Schwartzman, Lesley Manville, Michael Borremans, Andra Ursuta and David Lowery. It will have its world premiere at Venice Film Festival.\n\n“Queer” marks Guadagnino’s third film to play at NYFF following “Call Me by Your Name” and “Bones and All.” He recently directed “Challengers,” a tennis love-triangle drama starring Zendaya, Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist. Guadagnino is also directing “Separate Rooms,” a wistful story about an Italian writer who mourns the loss of his boyfriend.\n\n“I am so privileged and elated to present a movie of mine for the third time at NYFF, ‘Queer’ in particular,” said Guadagnino. “It is a very personal movie about the inescapable quest for being recognized in the gaze of another through the lens of the great William Burroughs.”"
