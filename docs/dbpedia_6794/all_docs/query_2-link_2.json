        "text": "Over the years, both the interior and the exterior of the Humanities and Social Sciences Library have been featured in many famous (and some not so famous) film projects. In Francis Ford Coppola’s madcap farce, You’re a Big Boy Now (1966), the Library itself is practically a character in the movie, whereas in 1999’s remake of The Thomas Crown Affair, the Beaux-Art landmark serves as an elegant stand-in for The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Occasionally, what you see on the screen is virtual: The New York Public Library featured in The Day After Tomorrow (2004) is entirely the product of Hollywood technical wizardly.
