        "text": "Home of the Original World-Famous Singing Waitstaff!\n\nEllen's Stardust Diner is a retro 1950s theme restaurant located at 1650 Broadway on the southeast corner of 51st Street in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City. The diner is regarded as one of the best theme restaurants in New York. The diner also contains retro-themed memorabilia such as photos of many past Miss Subways on the walls, an indoor train, a 1956 Predicta television, and a “drive-in theater” screen that showcases performances from the 1950s. It is popular among children and adults.\n\nHistory\n\nEllen's Stardust Diner was opened in 1987. It was the first 1950s themed restaurant in New York City and had waitresses in poodle skirts. In the late 1990s, a sister restaurant operated near Times Square under the name Stardust Dine-O-Mat.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n\nEllen's Stardust Diner was the site in the movie New Year's Eve where Sarah Jessica Parker’s character and her 15-year-old daughter's friends stopped for a bite after the ball dropped. It was also featured in American Idol when a former employee, Devyn Rush, became a contestant on the show. Reports subsequently followed regarding Devyn's employment status at Ellen's Stardust Diner. Ellen's Diner was also featured on a Today Show episode.\n\nAlumni on Broadway\n\nSeveral alums of Ellen's Stardust Diner singing waitstaff have gone on to have successful careers on Broadway and American Idol. Many current staffers have received critical acclaim with original musicals at the NY Musical Theater Festival. Brandon Ellis, Eric Michael Krop, Stephen Tyler Davis, and Alysha Umphress (Shirley) are some of the successful singers who started their careers as singing wait-staffers at Ellen's Stardust Diner.
