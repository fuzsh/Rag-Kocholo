It's gorgeous, recognizable, and—of course—synonymous with New York City. Here are five of the Park's most popular filming locations and their cinematic significance. And the award for Best Supporting Actor goes to...\n\nBethesda Terrace\n\nConsidered the heart of Central Park, Bethesda Terrace provides an iconic New York City backdrop with the beauty of Bethesda Fountain and a striking arcade with a Minton tile ceiling. To keep as much of Bethesda Terrace open as possible during its busiest times of day, film shoots often occur here early in the morning or late in the evening.\n\nYou may have seen it in:\n\nHair (1979): A song and dance sequence for \"Ain't Got No\" features several shots of Bethesda Terrace's intricate carvings, which represent the four seasons and, on the side facing the Mall, the times of day.\n\nHome Alone 2 (1992): Kevin is chased by the Wet Bandits and jumps into a horse carriage in front of Bethesda Fountain. You won't be able to recreate that scene—horse carriages don't actually cross in front of the fountain as shown in the movie.\n\nThe Mall"
