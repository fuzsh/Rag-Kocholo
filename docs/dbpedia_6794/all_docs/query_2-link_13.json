With unemployment looming, he reluctantly takes on a job as night watchman at New York City's Museum of Natural History. On his initial evening there, Larry receives an unexpected surprise when all of the exhibits in the museum suddenly spring to life and chaos ensues throughout the building.\n\nNight at the Museum was a tremendous financial success, grossing $250.9 million in the US and Canada and $323.6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $574.5 million.

The American Museum of Natural History, a legendary New York City landmark on Central Park West, plays a major role in the movie.\n\nBut despite its significance to the movie, most of the filming did not take place at this iconic museumâit would have been impossible to shoot an action-filled movie at such a renowned public attraction filled with precious historical, cultural, and scientific artifacts. Instead, the majority of Night at the Museum was filmed in a purpose-built studio in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nTo capture the majestic atmosphere of the museum itself, outdoor scenes were shot by taking exterior shots from New York City's American Museum of Natural History.\n\nA trip to the iconic New York locations for Night at the Museum would be a worthwhile experience for any fan or traveler looking to be immersed in some beautiful scenery. There are various guided tours available near the American Museum of Natural History which take visitors around filming locations used in Night at the Museum. A tour like this offers an interesting perspective on both cityâs architecture and history while allowing visitors to observe how it was beautifully captured in a beloved family classic.\n\nBrooklyn-based Larry Daley struggles to succeed as an inventor, hopping from one job and apartment to the next. His ex-wife Erica (Kim Raver) is compassionate but sees him as a negative influence on their ten-year old son, Nick.

After the game they walk around the pond and Larry tells son that his play is fantastic and he should think about the NHL. Nick replies that he doesnât want to be a hockey player, but he wants to trade bonds like Don . Larry tries to explain son that he should do what he likes the most and not to be like some robot in costume, who does only what he is told.\n\nCentral Park is a stunning landmark in the heart of Manhattan.
