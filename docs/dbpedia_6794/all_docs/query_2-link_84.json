        "text": "Jenny is back on the block!\n\nJennifer Lopez is in New York filming her latest movie, Page Six has learned.\n\nShe was also seen upstate on Friday with hubby Ben Affleck, 51, sources exclusively told us, and also has been hitting a number of Broadway musicals.\n\nJLo is “loving being back in New York,” an insider told us.\n\nLopez, 54, is shooting a feature adaptation of the 1993 Broadway musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman.”\n\nThe movie is written and directed by Bill Condon — who was behind the 2006 movie “Dreamgirls,” starring Jennifer Hudson, Beyoncé and Jamie Foxx.\n\nThe film is set in an Argentinian prison in 1981, and centers on a fantasy woman (played by Lopez) who is created by an inmate serving an eight-year sentence.\n\nJLo has also been hitting some musicals while in town herself.\n\nShe was spotted in the audience and backstage at Daniel Radcliffe’s show, “Merrily We Roll Along.” And we also hear that she and Affleck were seeing “The Outsiders,” which started preview this month, on Friday night.\n\nSpies saw the couple boarding a helicopter on Friday to head to the show after they were at the Copake Country Club in Columbia County, New York, for lunch — about 125 miles from the city.\n\nSpies said, “Ben and Jennifer were at the country club, where a golf car drove them to their waiting helicopter that flew them to Manhattan.”\n\nLopez was seen shooting her new film in Hoboken, New Jersey, at Elysian Café.\n\nLopez previously posted images on Instagram of herself and her child Emme at “Merrily We Roll Along” at the Hudson Theater. The Grammy winner is also mom to Emme’s twin, Max, and stepmom to Affleck’s three kids."
