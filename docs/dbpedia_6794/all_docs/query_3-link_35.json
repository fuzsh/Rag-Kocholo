        "text": "Whether or not we admit it, I think most girls have a favorite romantic comedy. Mine is, without a doubt, You‚Äôve Got Mail, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. It makes me smile every time I catch it on TV and I‚Äôm a sucker for the love-conquers-all message of the sweet film. But mostly, I love the incredible on-location filming that shows all four seasons of the best and most picturesque spots in my home city. The entire movie is like a scenic sightseeing tour of the beauty of New York.\n\nBirthday wishes are in order for this beautiful film, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year! You‚Äôve Got Mail was released in 1998 as a modernized take on the 1940 classic The Shop Around the Corner, and suggests that the love of your life may be right under your nose.\n\nJoe Fox (Tom Hanks) is the big business enemy of Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) as his huge book chain is about to put Kathleen‚Äôs neighborhood bookstore out of business. Joe and Kathleen squabble and rival each other in real life, all the while unknowingly falling in love with each other in an anonymous online relationship. The excitement of Joe and Kathleen‚Äôs anonymous communication adds to the giddiness of this classic rom-com. ‚ÄúWhat will NY152 say today, I wonder. I turn on my computer. I wait impatiently as it connects. I go online, and my breath catches in my chest until I hear three little words: You‚Äôve got mail. I hear nothing. Not even a sound on the streets of New York, just the beating of my own heart. I have mail. From you.‚Äù\n\nThe beautifully written emails and poetic instant messaging between Joe and Kathleen are part of the romantic charm, and result in some very memorable lines from this film. ‚ÄúThe odd thing about this form of communication is that you‚Äôre more likely to talk about nothing than something,‚Äù ShopGirl writes to NY152. ‚ÄúBut I just want to say that all this nothing has meant more to me than so many somethings.‚Äù\n\nYou‚Äôve Got Mail takes place on Manhattan‚Äôs Upper West Side. Since I went to Columbia University, I love that the film highlights some of my favorite spots in New York.\n\nIn honor of Mail‚Äôs 20th birthday, I want all you New Yorkers and New York tourists to look at Manhattan a little more carefully the next time you‚Äôre in Joe and Kathleen‚Äôs neighborhood. I‚Äôve put together a sightseeing tour of all the memorable spots on the Upper West Side. Now go grab a Gray‚Äôs Papaya and enjoy the tour!!\n\nThe Shop Around The Corner ‚Äì 106 West 69th St., Between Broadway and Columbus Avenue\n\nThis quaint little shop was so special to Kathleen, and it‚Äôs where she dishes to her coworkers everyday about the romantic words she shared with her online mystery man the evening before.\n\nThe actual store was never a bookstore and today it‚Äôs an organic dry cleaners. But the store was supposedly based on the real Books of Wonder located at 18 West 18th Street, in case you want to check out the inspiration.\n\nFox Books ‚Äì 150 West 17th St. at 7th Avenue\n\nJoe Fox and his family were building their mega-bookstore while he was getting to know Kathleen‚Ä¶ and the real construction going on for this movie (in the abandoned Barney‚Äôs) was so realistic that local New Yorkers actually thought a new bookstore was going up! You can check out the location but it‚Äôs actually in the Chelsea neighborhood.\n\nZabar‚Äôs ‚Äì 2245 Broadway, Between 80th and 81st Streets\n\nThis famous New York deli/grocery store was the neighborhood shop for both Joe and Kathleen, who ran into each other there when shopping around the holidays. And if you‚Äôre like me and always use your debit or credit card, you‚Äôll appreciate the moment where the stern cashier won‚Äôt accept Kathleen‚Äôs credit card‚Ä¶ until Joe charms her into doing so. Seriously, everyone needs to take credit cards! And ApplePay‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs 1998 so I guess I‚Äôm asking a bit much üòâ\n\n79th Street Boat Basin ‚Äì 79th Street on the Hudson River\n\nThis is a simple on. It‚Äôs the place where you need to look across the water and shout like the Foxes, ‚ÄúHelloooooo New Jersey!‚Äù\n\nCafe Lalo ‚Äì 201 West 83rd Street, Between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue\n\nThis cute cafe is one of the most authentic spots on your tour, as the actual interior and exterior were both used in the film and it still looks the same today. It‚Äôs the infamous place where Joe learned that the mystery love he was about to meet was actually Kathleen. Try to snag the same table where these two exchanged jabs and bring a red rose with you for effect.\n\nVerdi Square Farmers Market ‚Äì Intersection of Broadway/Amsterdam Avenue and West 73rd Street\n\nThat excited little look these two budding lovebirds get as they suggest meeting again for lunch is the epitome of new-love flirtation. Have a seat on their bench and be sure your farmers market mango is ripe üòâ\n\nOcean Grill ‚Äì 382 Columbus Avenue Between 78th and 79th Streets\n\nKathleen and Joe began enjoying each other‚Äôs company more and met for lunch at Ocean Grill‚Ä¶where she almost guessed his home address and made him squirm a bit!\n\nJoe‚Äôs Apartment ‚Äì 152 Riverside Drive, Between 87th and 88th Streets\n\nJoe‚Äôs infamous address/username is not actually a real apartment building on Riverside Drive, so for the interior scenes of his building (including the stuck elevator) they filmed inside 210 Riverside Drive at 93rd Street. Have a peek inside and see if Patricia is still there ‚Äúmaking coffee nervous‚Äù (one of my favorite lines!)\n\nKathleen‚Äôs Apartment ‚Äì 328 West 89th St., Between Riverside Drive and West End Avenue\n\nKathleen‚Äôs absolutely adorable apartment is in this brownstone where we see her skipping in and out throughout the movie. Of course, the inside of her unusually-large-for-NYC apartment was filmed on a set in New Jersey. But the best moment in front of this iconic stoop has to be when Joe ‚Äî who by this time knows she‚Äôs ‚ÄúShopgirl‚Äù ‚Äî finally suggests he has feelings for her. ‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt been Fox Books and you hadn‚Äôt been The Shop Around the Corner, and you and I had just, well, met‚Ä¶ I would have asked for your number, and I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to wait twenty-four hours before calling you and saying, ‚ÄòHey, how about‚Ä¶ oh, how about some coffee or, you know, drinks or dinner or a movie‚Ä¶ for as long as we both shall live?‚Äô ‚Äù And I swoon. Every. Single. Time.\n\nThe 91st Street Garden ‚Äì Riverside Park on Riverside Drive at 91st Street\n\nThis small but picturesque garden is exactly where it suggests ‚Äî at 91st Street in Riverside Park. NY152 asks ShopGirl to meet him there, and Kathleen leaves Joe to go meet her mystery man. When she finally learns it‚Äôs really Joe (thanks to a little help from Brinkley,) her emotions get the best of her. ‚ÄúI wanted it to be you‚Ä¶I wanted it to be you so badly,‚Äù she whispers before they lock lips in the long overdue kiss."
