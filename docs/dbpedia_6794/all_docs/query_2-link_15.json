        "text": "When you want to capture the energy of NYC’s subway system for your movie, television series, or commercial, you don’t want to fake it—you want the real thing. The MTA can make your vision a reality.\n\nSince it opened in 1904, films have been shot in the subway system. In fact, the man behind the camera in much of that early subway footage was legendary inventor Thomas Edison. Since then, it’s been featured in many television shows, feature films—including Ghostbusters, The Americans, Russian Doll, and The Joker, and even in music videos.\n\nThe MTA’s bridges, tunnels, railroads, and various other properties also are no stranger to the screen. Take Grand Central Terminal, for example, a cinematic dream that’s been featured in Hollywood classics like Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest. Hitchcock also shot scenes there for his 1945 movie Spellbound. You’ll spot this iconic location in The Avengers, The Fisher King, Midnight Run, and John Wick 3, too... to name just a few.\n\nWant to add your project to this impressive list? The MTA has the key to unlocking its vast system for your production. We’ve worked with TV and film crews for decades, and have met every kind of demanding technical, logistical, and scheduling requirement.\n\nMTA Film Locations\n\nThe MTA has a look that fits any era you are trying to replicate on film. We’re a location manager’s dream. Some of the locations we offer:\n\nHistoric bridges, such as the Throgs Neck and the Verrazzano-Narrows\n\nUnderground locations isolated from public view\n\nBuses\n\nCommuter trains and suburban stations\n\nExteriors that showcase a range of residential and city views\n\nIf you're looking for authenticity, the MTA has you covered.\n\nImportant things to know\n\nWe need a letter of intent, script, and storyboard.\n\nWe require insurance minimums for general liability, automotive liability, and workmen’s compensation.\n\nIf your request includes a platform or a train, we also require proof of a railroad protective liability insurance binder. (Note: Insurance requirements may differ by agency.)\n\nFee and lead time\n\nOur fee depends upon the scope of your project, the number of transit workers required to assist your production company, the type of equipment appropriate for your production, and the duration of filming.\n\nPlease provide a minimum of three weeks lead time.\n\nSafety\n\nOn the platform: All equipment and personnel must remain behind the yellow tiles.\n\nOn the tracks: Everyone in your production group who may have to work on or near the tracks must take a track safety course. This ensures that the crew and actors will learn proper procedures to protect themselves against possible track dangers, as well as about being next to moving trains.\n\nWe look forward to working with you to make the best New York movie possible.\n\nNew York City Transit\n\n(NYC subways & buses)\n\nRuthie Jones\n\nDirector, Film & Special Events\n\nruthie.jones@mtacd.org\n\n646-252-5842\n\nHugo Pazmino\n\nManager, Filming & Events\n\nHugo.pazmino@mtacd.org\n\n646-796-7831\n\nMetro-North Railroad\n\nLong Island Rail Road\n\nGrand Central Terminal\n\nMTA Bridges & Tunnels\n\nMeredith Conti\n\nSenior Manager, Filming & Events\n\nmeredith.conti@mtacd.org\n\n212-340-4825\n\nMelissa Cunillera\n\nManager, Filming & Events\n\nMelissa.cunillera@mtacd.org\n\n646-584-1728\n\nPress access\n\nIf this is a press request, please contact the MTA Press Office at (212) 878-7440 or by form."
