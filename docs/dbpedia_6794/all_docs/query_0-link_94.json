        "text": "The Jan Karski Educational Foundation is proud to serve as the fiscal sponsor for\n\nA Karski Feature Film\n\nREMEMBER THIS\n\nA Cinematic Adaptation of the Original Stage Production Remember This: The Lesson of Jan Karski,\n\nProduced by Sobremesa Media in association with The Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics at Georgetown University\n\nBased on a True Story\n\nDavid Strathairn in REMEMBER THIS (Photo: Jeff Hutchens)\n\nABOUT THE FILM\n\n“All I can say is that I saw it, and it is the truth.”\n\nIn a virtuoso solo performance, Academy Award nominee David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck, Lincoln, Nomadland) portrays Jan Karski in this genre-defying true story of a World War II hero and Holocaust witness. After surviving the devastation of the Blitzkrieg, Karski swears allegiance to the Polish Underground and risks his life to carry the first eyewitness reports of the Holocaust to the Western world, and ultimately, the White House.\n\nAfter escaping a Gestapo prison, where he was subjected to horrific physical torture, Karski endures unspeakable mental anguish, bearing witness to the despair of the Warsaw ghetto and the inhumanity of a death camp. Yet, he stands tall in the halls of power and speaks the truth. Strathairn captures the complexity and legacy of this self-described “insignificant, little man” whose timely story of moral courage and individual responsibility can still shake the conscience of the world.\n\nREMEMBER THIS takes a distinctive approach to filmmaking with a minimalist visual aesthetic designed to profoundly immerse and transport its audience. The elegant simplicity of the space—a table and two chairs, shot in black-and-white—captures Strathairn’s dynamic solo performance in all of its nuance and power, as he not only becomes Jan Karski, but channels over thirty characters from Karski’s extraordinary life. This rich cinematic landscape intensifies an intimate audience experience that makes it seem as though Professor Karski is speaking directly to all of us across time, space, and history.\n\nThe dramatic trailer for the film speaks to the quality of both the story and the acting:\n\nIn late 2023, the film became available on Kinema, an easy-to-use streaming platform which supports both virtual and in-person screenings. For more information, please visit the Kinema website.\n\nREMEMBER THIS premiered at the prestigious San Francisco Jewish Film Festival on July 24, 2022. It will have its official theatrical release on January 27, 2023, at Landmark’s Quad Cinema in New York, and then at Laemmle’s Monica Film Center in Santa Monica, CA, on February 3. The PBS broadcast is scheduled for March 13, 2023. The work will also serve as the centerpiece for a larger, multi-platform experience for universities, museums, and cultural institutions. The film's website includes additional information.\n\nMAKE A DONATION TO SUPPORT THE FILM\n\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, the production team led by Eva Anisko is continuing a fundraising campaign where all donations are tax-deductible and will go directly towards the movie’s global distribution, and educational outreach initiatives, including a college course curriculum.\n\nThe fundraising goal is $750,000. To donate directly for the film using a credit card or through Paypal, please click here.\n\nAlternatively, you can mail a check to:\n\nThe Jan Karski Educational Foundation\n\nP.O.
