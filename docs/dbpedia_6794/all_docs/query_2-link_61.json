        "text": "Posted by Ra Moon\n\nWithout making a lot of noise, the first John Wick film became a semi-cult movie, well-received by the public and critics alike.\n\nOn top of the charisma of the badass kill-em' all hitman, the legendary Continental Hotel is a character too, full of secrets and rooms that we explore in every new installment.\n\nJohn Wick was filmed in New York, although a very short scene was also shot in Los Angeles.\n\nThe success of this introductory symphony of violence turned the blockbuster into a franchise, expanding the saga beyond the boundaries of Keanu Reeves' character: Chapter 4 is set for release in March 2023, and two new spin-offs are in the pipeline: the film Ballerina and the TV series The Continental.\n\nReleased in 2014, the location report of the film was already covered by other outlets and websites, although with many key locations missing.\n\nSo here is the Atlas of Wonders team to bring you the ultimate guide to the John Wick: Chapter 1 filming locations.\n\nIn addition, you can find all the information about John Wick's Continental Hotel through all the movies by following this link, and here are our comprehensive reports of Chapter 2, Chapter 3 - Parabellum, and Chapter 4.\n\nThe scene with John and his wife in New York was filmed at Schaefer Landing, a small park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\n\nThe bridge in the background is the Williamsburg Bridge across the East River connecting with the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The last scene of the movie was also recorded here.\n\nHave you noticed that the brief flashback in the restaurant is the only scene where John smiles in the Wick movies?\n\n(You can open all the locations on Google Maps by clicking on the links below in the captions ↴)\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate and The Mike Bot - Map\n\nAccording to IMDb, the funeral scene was recorded at Calvary Cemetery in Maspeth and Woodside, Queens.\n\nEstablished in 1848, this historical burial ground features cinematographic views of New York's skyline.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nJohn Wick's house is a high-end glass villa located at 121 Mill Neck in Long Island, NY.\n\nBuilt in 1971, this 7,251 square feet single-family house on a five-acre site has six bedrooms, spectacular water views, and an estimated market value of about four million dollars.\n\nImage by courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nThe gas station where Iosef Tarasov insists on buying the Ford Mustang Boss 429 is the Gulf Gas Station at the corner of Route 9W and Christian Herald Road in Nyack, Rockland County.\n\nIosef is played by Alfie Allen, known for his role as Theon Greyjoy in Game of Thrones.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nNewsday reported that the sequence where John is venting his rage by driving through an airport’s runways with cool vintage hangars was filmed at John Republic Airport in Farmingdale, Long Island.\n\nOpened in 1927 as a flying field, many TV and film productions are shot in this facility every year.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nThe exterior of Aurelio's Garage (John Leguizamo) was filmed at Pine Non Ferrous, a scrap metal dealer located at 3440 Laurel Hill Boulevard in Flushing, Queens.\n\nThe location doesn't look the same as in the movie since the new Kosciuszko Bridge, which opened in April 2017, replaced the old 1939 bridge.\n\nThis spot is right next to York Studios, the headquarters of the movie.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nThe capo of the Tarasov syndicate and Iosef's father, Viggo, is played by Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist.\n\nThe rooftop scene with the pool at the Tarasov's tower was filmed at ModernHaus SoHo, previously known as The James New York Hotel, at 27 Grand Street.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nThe exterior of the Tarasov's lair is the Maritime Exchange Building, an imposing 36-story skyscraper at 80 Broad Street in the Financial District of NYC.\n\nCompleted in 1931, this Art Deco-style office building features four distinctive sea horses above the main entrance.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nThe John Wick Continental Hotel\n\nAfter driving through Manhattan Bridge, John arrives at the legendary Continental Hotel, appearing for the first time in the whole saga.\n\nThe exterior of the underworld institution is the flatiron-shaped Beaver Building in Manhattan.\n\nIn the real world, if you visited the building before 2020, instead of Charon, the concierge (played by Lance Reddick), you'd have found the Japanese restaurant Haru Sushi.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nHowever, the interior lobby with vaulted ceilings was actually filmed at the Great Hall of the Cunard Building.\n\nLocated at 25 Broadway in the Financial District, the facade and the vestibule were designated as a New York City Landmark in 1995.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nThe location of The Continental's basement club was quite hard to find, as in the movie there is not a single full shot of the venue.\n\nOur sleuthing revealed that this scene was filmed at the ballroom and dining room of the magnificent Hotel Wolcott, located a 3-min walk from the Empire State Building at 4 W 31st Street.\n\nDesigned in 1904, this section of this glamorous landmark, that has seen so many celebrities, remains unrestored.\n\nUnfortunately, at the moment the historical rooms of the Wolcott, are not in service anymore, as the hotel direction is waiting for better times to reopen.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate and Google Maps\n\nThe grand facade of the Surrogate's Courthouse doubled as the exterior of the Red Circle club, where Viggo has Iosef under guard.\n\nCompleted in 1907, this Beaux-Arts style historical landmark with opulent interior halls occupies an entire city block.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate and Timessquare 42 - Map\n\nThe Red Circle interior was filmed at the Edison Ballroom adjacent to the Edison Hotel, located at West 47th Street, in the heart of Times Square.\n\nThis elegant Art-deco event space of the 1930s reopened in 2008 after being restored to preserve its original style.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate and Google Maps\n\nThe private area with several pools, where Iosef is having fun awaiting his destiny with a bunch of acolytes, is located somewhere else.\n\nAtlas of Wonders has tracked down the location of this awesome spot: the AIRE Ancient Baths is a luxury spa hosted in a former 1883 textile factory in the Tribeca neighborhood.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nAs some local media reported, the interior scene at the Orthodox temple in Little Russia was filmed at St. Francis Xavier Church, located at 225 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nHowever, someone decided that the facade of this neo-gothic building was not good enough to make it to the final cut.\n\nThe exterior shot with John standing in front of the church was filmed very far away from New York, at the Immanuel Presbyterian Church at 3300 Wilshire Boulevard in Koreatown, Los Angeles.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate and Google Maps\n\nBut there is still a third location for the Russian temple: The sequence where John is waiting for Viggo and his henchmen to arrive was filmed at the old Williamsburgh Savings Bank at 175 Broadway.\n\nThis impressive neoclassical building, which opened in 1875, was designed like a temple to finance.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nThe scene pictured was filmed nearby under the Williamsburg Bridge on Wythe Avenue.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nIosef's safe house is located in a warehouse at Brooklyn Navy Yard.\n\nThe sniper is on guard duty in one of the harbor's cranes. The warehouse is the Agger Fish Building.\n\nThe twin chimneys in the background are from the shipyard's cogeneration plant.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nJohn and Marcus (played by Willem Dafoe) meet under the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn at Main Street Park.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nAccording to IMDb, Marcus' house is located at 160 E 83rd Street, on Upper East Side.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nMs. Perkins (played by Adrianne Palicki) meets Winston (Ian McShane) and his men at the famous Minton Tiles at Bethesda Terrace Arcade in Central Park.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nThe final boss car chase and fight was filmed at the Dry Dock 6 in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\n\nEstablished in 1801, this waterfront complex is an ex-shipbuilding facility that was used until 1966.\n\nToday, this industrial area has been redeveloped as a 'center of urban manufacturing', hosting offices and hip cafes.\n\nImage courtesy of Lionsgate - Map\n\nCan you help to improve this article about the filming locations of John Wick?
