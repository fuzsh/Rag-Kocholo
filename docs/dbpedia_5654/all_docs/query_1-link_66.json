        "text": "October 13, 2023\n\n3/5 ‚≠ê\n\nFull review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf üê∫\n\nOkay so. Romanian here.\n\n99% sure I‚Äôm not a vampire, but some of y‚Äôall seem to believe that everyone in Romania is from Transylvania and we all have fangs and hate garlic with a passion so you make me question my initial statement with your fairytale determination.\n\nI still haven‚Äôt discovered my fangs though, but now if I think on it I might have put them into a glass of water somewhere in my mountain castle and forgot about them. Whoops.\n\nNow, moving to the actual review, I have to say it: I didn‚Äôt really like this (because I am biased af), but it wasn‚Äôt entirely that bad.\n\nI didn‚Äôt know exactly how to grasp the general atmosphere of the book from the first few chapters. Because this book‚Äôs action was supposed to be set so close to where I actually live in Romania, I kind of know the geography of the place. I kind of got lost at some point while reading this‚Ä¶\n\nThey were talking about Bucharest and the snow-capped Carpathian Mountains in the same sentence and just try to imagine my confusion because, let me tell you, Bucharest is nowhere near any mountain. It‚Äôs a meadow all the way. Not to be rude or offend my friends from Bucharest (hello there, frumo»ôilor üëã), but people there have no idea how a snow-capped mountain is supposed to look like as seen from the window of their flat. Trust me, I lived there for three years, haven‚Äôt seen a hint of mountain.\n\nAnother super confusing thing for me ‚Äì Audrey Rose and Thomas were planning on taking a carriage from Bucharest to the Bran Castle (which btw has nothing to do with Dracula but I will just let the rumour fly around anyway) after the Orient Express arrived at its destination. Again, how? In 1880-ish Romania, such a trip with a carriage was supposed to be at least a week long. It is a freaky almost-four-hour-trip-depending how-fast-you-drive now, in modern times, highways and all.\n\nI am definitely being too judgemental here, it is only fiction after all, but this is the first time something like this really bothered me. Bear with me, a sister is trying to cut back on judgement and it is hard.\n\n(Don‚Äôt do like me people. It‚Äôs just fiction and in fiction, people can write whatever the hell they want if they feel like it. This is just me being a total bitch).\n\nWhat I thought was quite all right was the fact that the book was seasoned with various Romanian words and phrases that were, in fact, correct. And it was somehow kind of accurate because us Romanians (I‚Äôm going to generalise now, don‚Äôt kill me) tend to throw in a word in Romanian or two when we‚Äôre speaking just because sometimes we don‚Äôt really know how to find its best equivalent in English. We don‚Äôt really give a shit if the other people do not understand it, we just throw it in there and move on.\n\nThe plot was easy to follow and the mystery was definitely super easy to solve (at least for me). I still haven‚Äôt decided if I am glad that I knew who the criminal was here from the first chapter I met them or I am kind of annoyed that it was so obvious and I wasn‚Äôt surprised at all when everything unravelled.\n\nWhat is beton though (aka concrete aka Romanian for super cool) is that there is some interesting Romanian cultural insight in here ‚Äì there are some passages that are not really the typical facts everyone seems to know about Dracula and they are quite accurate actually (historically speaking) and there are also these little legends and mythological stories that are so damn great like, for example, Thomas‚Äôs story about the strigoi.\n\nOh, and, talking about strigoi here and Thomas‚Äôs story ‚Äì the story is quite real.\n\nThe strigoi are the Romanian equivalent of what the rest of the world calls vampires. In Romanian mythology (which is coming straight from the Dacian) they are the unrested souls of the undead that wake up from their own graves and roam around the villages torturing the living.\n\nI am telling you now and I am not even joking, there have been at least two cases confirmed in modern-times Romania about rituals of killing strigoi. The traditional rituals may vary from region to region though, but people (especially those from villages who seem to still be anchored in their hundreds-of-years-old customs) still perform them. For instance, in my region when there is a strigoi case, people open the coffin of the supposed strigoi, read to them something from the Holy Bible and then they impale the strigoi‚Äôs heart with a thick wooden stake.\n\nThomas‚Äôs version of the story is actually something that happened some time in the ‚Äò90s in the region of Romania called Oltenia. If you‚Äôre curious about this macabre thing, be my guest and read this book ;)\n\nThis is actually a good read, but I honestly think that the problem is with me. I cannot read something that might imply my culture and be totally, 100% okay with it. I am a true Romanian, we question and dissect everything because we know everything.\n\nIt is worth a try though. Simply because the cultural insight is kind of mi»ôto.\n\nJanuary 20, 2019\n\nShoutout to me for making it through this book!\n\nSeriously. If you‚Äôre looking for a better substitute for humor, mystery and general fulfillment, look no further than: Buzzfeed Unsolved.\n\nSeptember 23, 2017\n\nDelightfully morbid.\n\nI loved Stalking Jack the Ripper. It was a book I will always hold dear, mainly because I was enchanted by the gloomy Victorian London ambience and disturbingly fascinated by the gruesome murders and their riddles. Yet Hunting Prince Dracula, with its mystifying touch, with lores whispered by supersticious villagers and seemingly crazy professors, medieval orders and forests covered in white snow yet somehow tainted by crimson blood and chilling howls, is the reason I bowed to Kerri Maniscalco's exquisite pen.\n\n‚ÄúHas the Immortal Prince returned?‚Äù\n\nAfter the tragic events of Stalking Jack the Ripper, Wadsworth and Cresswell head to Romania, to attend the Academy of Forensic Medicine and Science. But the prestigious Academy hides many secrets, from dark corridors and chambers to brutally murdered corpses that indicate one thing; the Impaler Lord has returned, seeking blood. Whose blood though and why, that's a different story. Trying to reason with evidence of the supernatural while fighting the nightmares that haunt her, Audrey Rose must find some answers and give justice to those who have already perished, before her time comes to join them in the eversleeping realms of Death.\n\n‚ÄúThere's nothing quite like the aroma of a bloaded corpse to get one in the mood for adventure.‚Äù\n\nMy dear Mr. Thomas Cresswell cound not be more right. From the grey streets of Victorian London, Kerri Maniscalco transferred us to Romania, and painted with her colourful palette Dracula's castle and picturesque villages, blending red with white. White for the blinding snow. For the innocence lost. For the shroud that covered the victims of a villain utterly terrifying, that made your stomach churn with disgust and terror. Red for Wadsworth's lips, lips that craved to taste Cresswell's with a searing need. Red for the Prince of Blood, and his horrendous domain. For the autopsies performed by brilliant students who could not shut down their humanity. The atmosphere was eerie. Foreboding. Danger lingered in every corner. Everyone was a suspect, and everyone a potential victim. There were many times I wished for Ms. Harvey's traveling tonic to help me steel my nerves and keep reading. But in this deadly and macabre puzzle that gave you gooseflesh and toyed with Wadsworth's (and your very own) sanity, between the constant suspense and the legends of warrior societies and a brutal Prince worshipped by his countrymen, Kerri Maniscalco managed to ease the tension and make your lips curl up with mirth.\n\nI suspect you already know the reason.\n\n‚ÄúI have a feeling you haven't invited me here for kissing. Though it never hurts to ask. You're dressed for sneaking about Dracula's castle. Be still my thawing, dark heart. You certainly know how to make a young man feel alive, Wadsworth.‚Äù\n\nAnd along this witty and charming duo, you also felt alive. Belly rumbled with laughter, heart that pounded rapidly with the snarky dialogues that oozed sarcarm yet tenderness and affection at the same time, lungs that ran out of air when tension was too much to handle, Cresswell and Wadsworth are a couple the likes of which you haven't encountered so far. Wadsworth struggled with her demons, and the wounds the events of the previous book were raw and fresh, depicted in a powerful and devastating way. I won't lie and say that I was on board with every decision Wadsworth made. I think that she could become so fixated on her independence that she misinterpreted the attempts to protect her as actions to cage her, and she could be really unfair towards Cresswell. But she came a long way overcoming her emotional trauma, and her development was evident. Her sharp mind and equally sharp tongue make her a remarkable heroine.\n\nNow let's talk about Cresswell.\n\n‚ÄúYou've stared fear in its nasty face and made it tremble. You will make it through this, Wasdworth. We will make it through this. That is a fact more tangible than any dream or nightmare. I promised I'd never lie to you. I intend to honor my word.‚Äù\n\nAs my dear friend Nastassja once said, Mr. Thomas Cresswell turns bloody and creepy into sexy so, so easily. While his social skills are still rusty, and his good intentions don't always work out as planned, his arrogant and (completely) inappropriate remarks, his flirtatious ways and the intensity of his feelings towards Wadsworth make him utterly delectable. Their scenes crackled with pent-up tension, and you couldn't help but pant a little even when there was no touching involved. Only heated stares. Innuendos. Sinful thoughts. And a love deep and powerful. From every challenge, they emerged stronger. Together and as individuals. I think I'm in love with them both.\n\nAll in all, a delicious and macabre tale, with the perfect blend of suspense, horror, Romanian folklore and sparking romance, Hunting Prince Dracula surpassed its predecessor and established Wadsworth and Cresswell as the new hot duet of crime solvers!\n\n*ARC generously provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review*\n\nYou can find this review and more over on BookNest.eu!\n\nBEFORE\n\nDelightfully morbid, with the perfect blend of suspense, horror, Romanian folklore and sparking romance, Hunting Prince Dracula surpassed its predecessor and established Wadsworth and Cresswell as the new hot duet of crime solvers!\n\nFull review to come!\n\nAugust 13, 2018\n\nAs I was not a huge fan of Stalking Jack The Ripper, I was unsure if I would continue with the series until hearing rave reviews of book two, especially from people who also did not enjoy the first installment. I did enjoy Hunting Prince Dracula more than book one, but it still just wasn‚Äôt for me.\n\nCW: murder/gore, sexism, ptsd\n\nMy absolute favorite part of this series is the characters and romance. I wasn‚Äôt the BIGGEST fan of Audrey Rose in book one, but I actually loved her in book two. I adore her independence, her intelligence, her passion, her determination ‚Äì she just has so many loveable qualities! I also love Thomas even more than I did in book one (which I didn‚Äôt think was possible.) He is analytical, witty, flirtatious, respectful and all around wonderful. I adored the development of their relationship in this installment. It is so refreshing to see a YA couple that view each other as equals. Thomas and Audrey have a fulfilling, healthy relationship and they complement each other in the best way. Their growth as a couple is the perfect slow-burn and I would honestly read anything where they are together, even if this series is definitely not one of my favorites.\n\nI really enjoyed the setting of this story. I‚Äôve always loved vampire folklore so the added exploration into how these legends play into Romanian culture was fascinating. I also loved the choice to transform Bran Castle, a place of great mystery and history, as the primary location of the novel. It was equal parts enchanting and creepy.\n\nTruthfully, there are not many distinctive critiques I have for this novel ‚Äì It‚Äôs just not a favorite of mine. I do not frequently reach for historical fiction, but the plot of this series is too intriguing for me to pass up. The prose is fine, but nothing profound in my opinion. Similarly, the mystery was ‚Äúokay.‚Äù I will admit I was bored for some of the story as I feel it was extremely slow-paced up until an intense ending. I just was not as engaged as other mysteries I have read.\n\nWhile this series is overall not for me, I am glad I read book two and I definitely plan to read book three. I don‚Äôt feel it is within my capacity to love this series as much as others, but I really love the premise of each story and hope to be surprised even more by the next installment.\n\nI received a free copy of this book from Little Brown at Book Expo 2017. I had no obligation to review this book and all opinions are my own.\n\nOctober 29, 2023\n\n#1: Stalking Jack the Ripper ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\n#2: Hunting Prince Dracula ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\n#3: Escaping From Houdini ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\n#3.5: Becoming the Dark Prince ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\n#4: Capturing the Devil ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\nAre you guys ready for some serious fangirling?! This series has utterly bewitched me.\n\nPerhaps it was time for fathers to teach their sons how to behave around young women. They were not born superior, no matter how society falsely conditioned them. We were all equals here.\n\nWhile we got to see Audrey's feminist snark come into play a little in SJTR, she is loud, proud, and feminist as hell in this sequel. I am so here for this! Despite struggling with PTSD from the ending of the first book (and her PTSD is represented really solidly!), when she arrives at Bran Castle, Audrey refuses to let the headmaster or any of her male colleagues look down upon her. True to her nature, she claws her way to the top despite her trauma and the scorn of the men around her.\n\n\"Mr. Thomas Cresswell would descend into each circle of Hell if you needed him to. You are the beating heart inside his ribcage.\"\n\nReally, though, my favorite thing about this book was how much time we get to spend with Thomas and how much his character develops. He is shamelessly head-over-heels for Audrey, and while he occasionally slips up, his intentions are always good. He learns from each mistake along the way and views her as his equal in all ways. In a genre filled with unhealthy and/or unrealistic relationships, Kerri has written a romance that feels authentic, legitimate, exciting, and so sweet.\n\nHis eyes were my favorite constellations to gaze at; each fleck of gold surrounding his pupils were new galaxies begging to be discovered.\n\nAudrey develops tremendously as well, and opens her heart to the possibilities of a life filled with more than just cutting open cadavers and chasing down villains. I found it really delightful to watch her come to terms with the idea that she could be a strong, feminist woman without sacrificing her emotions or blossoming romance.\n\n\"Society at large is staggeringly obtuse. If one simply looks to others for their opinions, they lose the ability to think critically for themselves. Progress would never be made if everyone all appeared and thought and loved in the same manner.\"\n\nDid I mention there's a queer romance in this book? Because there's totally a super precious and adorable f/f relationship between a couple of side characters. ‚ù§\n\nIf you couldn't tell already, I loved every freakin' moment of Hunting Prince Dracula. The setting is incredible - a creepy old castle, what more could I ask for? - and the suspense is on point. I know there were some complaints that SJTR threw out too many red herrings, but I don't feel that was the case at all with this sequel. I found myself legitimately considering every possible avenue for the culprit, and while the ending didn't shock me, I loved how everything played out. Plus, we learned some delicious secrets about Mr. Cresswell, which I really hope will come into play in the next book!\n\nIf you enjoy YA suspense/thrillers, mysteries, gothic horror, and/or an adorable romance in bloom, I highly encourage you to pick this series up ASAP! You won't regret it.\n\nThank you to Jimmy Patterson Books/Little, Brown and Company for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest review!\n\nNovember 7, 2020\n\n‚ÄúMonsters are only as real as the stories that grant them life. And they only live for as long as we tell those tales.‚Äù\n\nThis book has really advanced from Stalking Jack the Ripper in terms of character development and plot twists.\n\nThe story begins with Audrey and Thomas on a train to Romania, to attend one of Europe's best forensic institutes. But as people start turning up dead with their bodies completely drained of blood, students of the Institute are on high alert and suspect that Dracula himself is going about on his vampiric murder spree. With a murderer on the loose, Thomas Creswell and Audrey Rose Wadsworth must work together to investigate and put a stop to him/her.\n\nThe romance in this book was nothing less than sheer delight. Yes, it felt slow and regressive at times, but unlike the first book, I loved how Thomas manoeuvres his way through the castle just so he could meet Audrey furtively and how they both sneak away to eerie and creepy places, risking their lives for the sake of investigation. Their loyalty towards each other touched the heavy pieces of my heart and made me want to fangirl. I love Thomas with all my heart and I don't think any amount of words will do him justice. Just when I thought I couldn't love him anymore than I already do!\n\nAudrey Rose comes out stronger than before. The events in Stalking Jack the Ripper threw her off balance, tampering with her focus and nagging at her with delusional thoughts. But despite her better judgement, she is confident of who she is and is not afraid to persist on following her dreams and passion. Being a female in an institution dominated by males, she faces harsh criticism and sneers from her fellow classmates and the Headmaster but she just brushes them off and proves them wrong. I also admire how she stands up to Thomas and saves him on countless occasions. Her ability to stand up for what is right, make her own decisions and her desire to be treated as an equal is amazing.\n\nThe story gives us an insight on Vlad The Impaler\n\nknown to be one of the most important rulers of the Wallachian history, also infamous for his acts of cruelty, notably impaling his enemies.\n\nThe main plot was unpredictable as the focus kept drifting between different suspects, rendering it difficult to deduce the killer. Despite the aforementioned point, the twist isn't all that jaw-dropping. The only reaction it drew from me was \"Meh.... okay\". The story was moderately paced but the investigation felt slow and dragged because of Audrey and Thomas' inability to make headway in the investigation.\n\nOverall, it was an intriguing read that had me second-guessing various interactions and the central mystery. 3.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nMarch 1, 2020\n\nwow, i love how informative this series is. its obvious KM has put in some serious medical and historical research when writing these books. i feel like i learned so much whilst reading that i probably could go and become a coroner/medical examiner. if only it were currently the 1890s. lol.\n\nim still a big fan of audrey roses character and what she stands for. i like that she continues to act upon her curiosity, even when it is perceived as unladylike. but, i mean, if i had my own thomas cresswell, im pretty sure i would be doing all kinds of improper things just to be near him, too. amirite, ladies? :P\n\nthe only reason im not rounding up my rating is because i didnt quite enjoy this as much as the first book. its probably due to the subject - ive never been interested dracula/vlad the impaler - so the frequent and extensive history given throughout the story didnt really capture my attention.\n\nthat being said, the next installment sounds absolutely delightful, so i am more than willing to continue the series. and also because i cant get enough of my boy, thomas.\n\n‚Ü† 3.5 stars\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\n\"Lead the way, Wadsworth. I'm simply along for the brute strength and charm.\"\n\nOmgah. This was FANTASTIC. I loved the first book, but this one blew it out of the water. Kerri Maniscalco can WRITE. (Thank you to the publishers for sending me a gorgeous arc!)\n\nEvery page was brilliant. The prose was gorgeous. I loved loved loved it. (Mind you, I had to skim some of the bloody parts-weak stomach eek!) But seriously you guys, don't miss this.\n\n\"Flowers need plenty of water to grow. Love, too, needs attention and affection or else it slowly withers away from neglect.\"\n\nLet's start with the most important matter.\n\nThomas. Freaking. Creswell.\n\nJust when you think you have him figured out, well... trust me. You have no idea. He was the highlight of this book. The banter and chemistry was OFF THE CHARTS. I mean, he was pretty freaking great in the first book, but the heat between him and Aubrey Rose was multiplied ten times over here. Just because they ended on a happy note in the last does NOT mean anything loses its steam. Like wow.\n\n\"Do you want to know what I think? The Truth?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He gazed unabashedly into my eyes. \"Make it scandalous too. This is bit too serious for my tastes.\"\n\nNot to mention, Thomas is hiding one little detail that makes him EVEN MORE LEGIT OH MY LORD. Ugh I can't spoil but like...ermergersh. (Seriously can someone freak out with me please?)\n\nAubrey Rose and Thomas are off to attend an academy set in the Brahn Castle in Romania (Dracula's castle- yes it exists.) The setting was so flipping cool. Creepy castle with secret passageways? Check. Enchanting forest and medieval village? Check. Bits of history and rumors woven throughout? Check.\n\nI'll admit the story was a bit on the creepy side and I'm not really a fan of horror or macabre, but I was able to skip the bits that disturbed me easily enough. Sorry Kerri, you're brilliant with the whole cadaver scenes but ahhh I had to skim that. Either way though, the story was brilliant (have I said brilliant enough? I'm going to say it more.) I don't want to give anything other clues about the plot, but just enjoy the ride.\n\nBut even aside from the cool-as-crap setting and the edge of your toes storyline, the character development was phenomenal. Aubrey Rose is suffering from PTSD throughout the book, and it wasn't dealt with lightly. I was a little unsure of how everything played out in the end of the last book, but I was impressed with how well it was written in this one. Thomas, on the other hand, has his own dealings that broke my heart. But even amidst it all, they find little ways to move forward. I also loved the addition of Thomas's sister who is BAMF omg. But most of all? I loved discovering everyone's secrets ahhh!\n\n\"For there are no limits to the stars, their numbers infinite. Which is precisely why I measure my love for you by the stars. An amount too boundless to count.\"\n\nSo all in all, this gets a glowing review from me.\n\nMy Blog ~ Instagram ~ Twitter ~ Etsy\n\nSeptember 19, 2017\n\n9/18/17 PUBLICATION EVE UPDATE!\n\ndon't forget to submit screenshots of your preorders to receive the MEETING THOMAS CRESSWELL novella! ends TONIGHT at midnight!

I can't wait!\n\nHappy Reading!\n\nMel ‚ô•\n\nMY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List\n\nJune 27, 2018\n\nAudrey Rose is not here for anyones misogynistic bullshit\n\nOctober 23, 2017\n\nHello everyone, I would really love it if you all start addressing me as Sherlock Holmes because your girl right here, solved it. I mean I had my theories and ideas and screamed when I was right oh em gee.\n\nI really didn't like the first book because it was just so dull and focusing a lot on the forensics, leaving me uninterested and bored, but this book??? was so much more intriguing and interesting.\n\n!!!!!!Spoilers from the previous book from here on!!!!!\n\nSo what is this book about?\n\nAfter finding out who Jack the Ripper was and facing very disturbing events, Audrey's father let's her go to Romania to study at one of the best forensic schools with Thomas Creswell!!! Somebody is murdered on the train she's traveling on and a killer is on the loose murdering people the way Dracula did.\n\n‚óèThis book is honestly so great!! Audrey Rose is the perfectly, flawed and strong character. She's bullied and made fun of because of her sex. No one thinks she's capable of doing anything because she's a fucking female!! But she speaks up and doesn't back down. She proves to them that's she's just as capable as males and can do whatever the fuck they can. And it's fabulous.\n\n‚ÄúOh? Where in a medical dictionary does it say a woman cannot handle such things? What is a man‚Äôs soul made of that a woman‚Äôs is not? I had no idea my innards were composed of cotton and kittens, while yours were filled with steel and steam-driven parts.‚Äù\n\n‚óèShe's so strong and badass!!! She wears dresses and cuts open dead bodies. She shows, that as a woman she can do anything anyone else could. I honestly don't understand why it's so hard for people to just understand the fact that a woman should be treated equally as anyone else and she can do ANYTHING!!!\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps it was time for fathers to teach their sons how to behave around young women. They were not born superior, no matter how society falsely conditioned them. We were all equals here.‚Äù\n\n‚óèShe has anxiety, hallucination and flashbacks of what happened in the previous book. She's dealing with the loss of her brother and mother. And tbh, that makes her so so perfect.\n\n‚óèThomas Creswell is the best person to exist. He's always teasing Audrey with dirty jokes, trying to get a kiss from her, always there to support her, HE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!, but so does everyone because we're all humans. He goes through some incredible character development and learns so much about himself. He's a little closed off and mysterious. And he's always there to support Audrey and respects her.\n\n‚Äú'You are not mine to take.' He brushed his lips against mine. Softly, so softly I might have imagined them there. My eyes fluttered shut. He could persuade me to build a steamship to the moon when he kissed me. We could orbit the stars together. 'You are yours to give.'‚Äù\n\nI need this boy in my life. I just love how he's not portrayed as the perfect, heroic guy. Audrey here takes her own lead while he helps her. He isn't the main hero and more of a sidekick type when solving the mystery and it's perfect. She saves him multiple times and he's totally fine with that. I mean, it should be fine with everyone.\n\n‚óèThis book is so much more intriguing and complicated from the previous. I, personally, LOVE Romania, Vlad Tepes and the whole Vampire, Dracula thing. I remember watching this one show about the whole history of Vlad, his castle and how he was imprisoned and the gore and murder. So the mystery and plot were much more interesting.\n\n‚óèRomania is beautiful and I just loved it.\n\n‚óèthere's!!! a!!! F/f!!!! Couple!!!! And!!!! I!!!! Love!! Them!!!!!!\n\nSpoiler about who dunnit and how ya girl solved this case!!!\n\n/////////////\n\nI knew for a fact it was going to be a female because of how Maniscalco portrays woman empowerment and I realized the murderer was definitely going to be a woman. Then Anastasia's giddy, cheery behavior, taking Audrey out to the woods at night and giving her the warning of being careful, her being the headmasters daughter and also talking about how she has to prove she's good enough as a woman in their eyes. I realized she was trying to appear innocent by trying to \"help\" out Audrey with the case. Then when we find out she's the headmasters niece or something, we all go, nahhh she can't be it, BUT I KNEW IT WAS HERRRRRR because it's all too suspicious!!!\n\nI got hints that she was the murderer because of all that, but then when she \"died\" I was like, \"aw shit, it's not her\" and thought it was thomas's sister. BUT THEN AT THE END THIS BITCH IS BACK AND I WAS LIKE AW YEAH FUCKERS, I WAS RIGHT EAT ALL OF MY DUST HOLMEYYYY\n\nSPOILER ENDS\n\n////\n\nSo like, overall, you guys should really read it because this book gives amazing messages about feminism, equality and it's such an intriguing read!!!\n\nAlso, I'm opening my own detective school where y'all can learn from me because I'm fabulous at this ;pp\n\nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n3 1/2 stars, rounded up because‚Ä¶ well, it was really entertaining, and also overall of much higher quality than book one. And wow, I suddenly love the two leads?\n\nI‚Äôm going to be talking about this a lot in relation to Stalking Jack the Ripper. So here‚Äôs that review.\n\nFirst let‚Äôs talk about the mystery, because that was something I didn‚Äôt like in book one and‚Ä¶ wow, I love him. The cleverness of the solution here has really stepped it up. I didn't guess the solution at all.\n\nOkay, for the most important part, let‚Äôs talk about characters, because that is the real success of this book. I really really really like Thomas - I only liked him in the last book - and I never like love interests in books like these. He‚Äôs such a good man. There‚Äôs a scene in this book where he totally fucks up, and I was expecting it to be glossed over completely, but he immediately apologizes and doesn‚Äôt blame Audrey Rose at all. Speaking of such, I love Audrey Rose. Audrey Rose is suffering from severe ptsd and I think the way she is written here is so clever, so beautiful, so stunning. I love her. And I also love their relationship. Just‚Ä¶ every scene between them is so tense. I love it.\n\nK, let‚Äôs talk about Same issue with the lack of discussion of colonialism in Audrey Rose‚Äôs backstory - she‚Äôs biracial and Indian and that‚Äôs really awesome but colonialism is like‚Ä¶ not discussed at all. BUT I will say the feminism thing has improved a lot - so many of the major characters in this book are ladies and it's great. There are even side sapphics and it's what I deserved. But perhaps more in the vein of feminism, I adored the narrative around Audrey not wanting to be protected and Thomas having to learn not to violate that but being totally willing to work on his own privilege. I felt like the takedown of that was missing from book one?\n\nUnfortunately, I did think this one could've used some editing down - it's a hundred pages longer than the first book and it really drags in the middle. Part of that is the fact that the plot points feel less convoluted and weird and thrown-in, which is good, but Kerri Maniscalco hasn't quite gotten a handle on how to make plot points that aren‚Äôt convoluted but are still interesting, which means there are just fewer interesting plot points.\n\nI think my slump ruined my enjoyment of this book a lot but also... it was good. I‚Äôm so invested in the two leads.\n\nBlog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube\n\nOctober 3, 2017\n\nFull review posted\n\nI was going to forgive 2017 for all the crap it gave us if this book didn‚Äôt disappoint and THANK GOODNESS 2017 GETS ANOTHER CHANCE\n\nAntique pages were a scent that should be bottled up and sold to those who adored the aroma.\n\n(s)\n\nReasons why this book saved 2017\n\n- Anxiety/hallucination rep from one of the most badass woman to ever walk\n\n- So much fem power bois this is a good one\n\n- Thomas Cresswell, my husband\n\n- In book 1, Audrey was so impassive to gross things and I totally get it but seeing how they impacted her more in this book MADE ME RELATE TO HER SO MUCH\n\n- Thomas and Audrey go on lots of adventures together\n\n- And their banter is epic as always\n\n- BASICALLY YOU‚ÄôRE JUST SCREAMING AT THEM TO BLOODY KISS BC THEYRE SO PERFECT AND YOU JUST NEED TO SEE THIS SHIP SAIL DAMMIT\n\n- The twists, man\n\n- The revelation of the killer got me good\n\n- I didn‚Äôt guess right ÔÅå\n\n- Cresswell is a shameless flirt\n\n- I want to marry him, im so done with the world why does he have to be fictional\n\n- Lots of science-y things\n\n- I LOVE HISTORIC ANYTHING AND HISTORIC ROMANIA WAS AWESOME\n\n- Audrey basically gives a middle finger to gender roles and social conducts, its great\n\n- Lots of unchaperoned adventures üòè üòè üòè\n\n- THOMAS‚ÄôS SISTER IS SO PRECIOUS\n\n- Everytime Thomas opens his mouth you‚Äôre just bracing yourself for the adorableness that will pour out of him\n\n- The teacher guy was creepy tho, not a fan\n\n- If you want a mystery set in historic Romania with two darling characters that you will be screaming at THEN PICK THIS BOOK UP ITS SO GOOD WORTH IT WORTH IT WORTH IT\n\n(s)\n\n5 stars!! gimme book 3 right now please\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n*screams in the general direction of the sun* I AM READY FOR SOME AUDREY AND THOMAS BANTER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n3/13/2017 update\n\nTHE\n\nCOVER\n\nHAS\n\nBEEN\n\nREVEALED\n\nlooks hella creepy and mysterious\n\nI'M IN\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n*touches cheek*\n\nwhere did these tears come from????!!!????\n\nBOOK\n\nTWO\n\nIN\n\nROMANIA\n\nWITH\n\nAUDREY\n\nROSE\n\nAND\n\nTHOMAS\n\nCRESSWELL\n\ncan i have now?????\n\nAugust 13, 2024\n\nMonsters were in the eye of the beholder.

Audrey Rose and Thomas are on their way to Romania to enroll at their elite forensic medicine school. Audrey Rose is still trying to deal with the aftermath of the tragedy that took place a few weeks prior, and she is clearly suffering from PTSD (or high-level anxiety). She has trouble deciphering what is real and what is not, she uses her brother in the face of strangers and she imagines the dead bodies she's working on moving and coming back to life, among other things. Honestly, I liked that she is struggling to cope with everything that she recently went through. She remains a strong character, but she is definitely not okay, and it made her feel more real.\n\nI did not believe there was any line one wouldn‚Äôt cross when it came to those one loved. Morals crumpled when faced with heartache. Some fissure within us would forever remain irreparable.\n\nOf course, Audrey Rose is not welcomed with open arms when she arrives because... drumrolls... she is a woman! even though she struggles with her inner turmoils, she does not hesitate to shut the boys down and to show them that she is just as good as them when it comes to reading dead bodies.\n\n\"I would not be treated as if my mind were inferior because I'd been blessed with ability to bear children.\"\n\nThere is a series of murders happening at the castle and near it, and it doesn't take long for Thomas and Audrey Rose to get involved and to decide to track down the killer (or killers) on their own. The folklore has an important part in this book as people are convinced that strigois (Romanian equivalent of what we call vampires) are behind it all. According to Romanian mythology souls of the undead can't find rest, and wake up from their graves to torture the living around them.\n\nI have to say that I liked Thomas more in this book than in the previous one, and I understand now why he is a favorite among the readers. Audrey Rose and he are fighting some heavy attraction to one another and it was GREAT. I wasn't into Thomas that much in the last book, but not anymore! I am smitten by Thomas Cresswell. I love how he sees Audrey Rose as an equal and a partner, even though he's obviously in love with her and wishes to protect her. I also LOVE the gentlemen vibe mixed with the sarcastic vibe. It's two things that I adore, so the result can't be bad!\n\n‚ÄúBody heat is scientifically the best way to stay warm. In fact, there are studies that suggest removing your clothes entirely and pressing skin to skin is the surest mean of avoiding hypothermia. Should you fall prey to that, I‚Äôll use every weapon necessary to save you. It‚Äôs what any decent young gentleman would do. Seems terribly valiant, if you ask me.‚Äù\n\nThe two of them are an awesome duo for solving murders, and I love how the author managed to mix some funny moments in the story, even among the darker and sinister moments.\n\nOn a side note, I did see the end coming a little bit (the same happened in the first book with Jack's true identity), I was not 100% sure about the murderer's identity, but I was not really surprised when it was revealed. Also, I am not sure that I am a fan of the whole \"secret society\" thing that was also present in the book, but not that well developed. I felt that it could have been an interesting aspect, but the way it was presented made me more confused sometimes, and I am just not convinced by it... But I still enjoyed the book very much, and I will definitely read the next one very soon!\n\n1. Stalking Jack the Ripper ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\n1.5 Meeting Thomas Cresswell ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nFollow me on Instagram üôÇ\n\nMarch 18, 2023\n\nCute, funny and extra creepy.\n\nA little juvenile and the plot a tad predictable, but overall very enjoyable.\n\nI'm sorry, Kerri Maniscalco who brought Prince Wrath into our lives, for underestimating your power when I refused to read this series.\n\nHoudini, here I come!\n\nSeptember 19, 2017\n\nI loved SJTR, so I was 10000000% on board with this being a series and as soon as I got this book in my greedy hands, I dropped everything.\n\nI love Audrey Rose. She's smart and sassy and doesn't back down. It's so much fun being in her head. And don't get me started on Thomas because I wouldn't know where to start. I live for the banter between them and it's even better when they're flirting at the same time.\n\nPlot wise, it's a big bundle of mystery. There are creepy castles and late night searches and oh yeah, bodies. There are some new characters introduced that I hope we get to see in the next book and a few revelations at the end that had me practically screaming.\n\nOverall, it was a fun read that had me captivated from the first page. I can't wait to get my hands on book 3.\n\n**Huge thanks to Kerri for spoiling me rotten and sending me to the book**\n\nMay 25, 2018\n\nSo, since I've never actually figured out the art of writing reviews for sequels I'm just gonna direct you to my review of Stalking Jack the Ripper for any coherent thoughts on this series you might be interested in while I gush here about how much I loved this book.\n\n1. I am in actual love with Audrey Rose and her genius self and will never not be and if this book series turns one more person she trusts into a murderer I will riot. She needs a break - someone buy her a bath bomb\n\n2. I also love Thomas and his stupid, emotionally stunted ass hole self and if he ever makes the ill-advised decision to play dead and make me ugly cry again I will kill him for real myself.\n\n3. The school setting was perfect.\n\n4. Audrey Rose's aversion to marriage is so damn relatable to me and it's so interesting to read about because it is never explored in YA\n\n5. The audiobook voice actor is so talented it's insane\n\n6. GIVE ME THE NEXT BOOK IMMEDIATELY\n\n7. I don't give a shit about romance but if Audrey Rose and Thomas don't end up together by the end of the fourth book I will no longer believe in love\n\nJune 21, 2020\n\n‚ûµ Stalking Jack the Ripper (#1) - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\n‚ûµ Hunting Prince Dracula (#2) - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\n‚ûµ Escaping from Houdini (#3) - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\n‚ûµ Capturing the Devil (#4) - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\n-------------\n\n[9/15/2019] -\n\n[Credit: Kerri Maniscalco]\n\nI don't know who the girl in the picture is but she is perfect as Audrey Rose!!\n\n--------------\n\n[9/10/2019] - [9/10/2019] - POP QUIZ! Anybody recognize this voice?\n\n--------------\n\nI really don't know what to say. Partly because this book is so amazing but mainly because, as you can see below, I've already review this. Instead, I'll just note the things I noticed this time around.\n\n1) My crush on Thomas is much strong this time. - I think this is because when I last read this, I was still holding back my inner gay-ness but this time, I'm out of sh*ts to give about what people think of my sexuality so Thomas has gained a spot on my fictional crushes list! Yay!\n\n2) Audrey Rose is ironically sexist - I love Audrey Rose but she is so tightly forced into the \"Empowered Young Woman\" role that it literally feels stale and she ends up being sexist. If any word, action, etc. that a man did rubbed her the wrong way, she instantly thought it's because I'm a girl\n\nNO IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A B*TCH! Again, I love this series and AR but she needs to curb her pride. goodness.\n\n3) This book is f**king scary - Not terrifying but definitely unsettling. Especially that spider scene... *Shudders*\n\n***************\n\nIt was just as great the second time around\n\n***************\n\nWHY YES! I AM READING THIS AGAIN!\n\n***************\n\nThis book puts all sequels to shame. Usually, sequels are boring or cheesy (*cough* Insugrent *cough*). This wasn't. In fact, it might be even better than the first one.\n\nIt took me about one chapter to fall back in love with these characters. Thomas is his usual annoyingly charming self and Audrey Rose is her usual brave and dying spirited self. Throughout, the book Audrey Rose deals with what I think is PTSD after the events of book one. (Don't sorry I won't spoil).\n\nThe romance between Thomas and Audrey rose....\n\nIt was so cute! They are such an amazing couple and they deserve happiness!!! Hopefully they'll have a happily ever after unlike some book. *cough* allegiant *cough*\n\nThe mystery was not as good as book one but probably because this book focused more on the romance. It didn't have as much build up and the creepiness factor wasn't as chilling. The ending was honestly a little disappointing but then again book one was just so amazing.\n\n|blog|\n\nBottom Line:\n\n4.5 Stars: Great romance, lacking in creepiness.\n\nAge Recommendation: 14+ (Brief kiss, gore)\n\nTW: arachnophobia, homophobia\n\n| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram\n\nMarch 9, 2023\n\n2.5-3 stars\n\nI liked this book more than the first one but also this was soooo boring. Not in the sense that nothing was happening but because everything was dragged out soooo much. At some point I was just wondering why this feels like adventures from Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and Monster high we‚Äôre thrown together.\n\nI still like monster high more than this bc THAT PLOT TWIST ABOUT THE MCS WAS SOOO STUPID. Ugh\n\nOctober 6, 2017\n\nMonsters were in the eye of the beholder. And no one wanted to discover their hero was the true villain of the story.\n\nWadsworth and Cresswell are back and this time they are hunting Dracula himself! Before starting this review I should probably mention that Stalking Jack the Ripper was one of my favorite books last year. I had an absolutely illogical crush on Thomas Cresswell, which was pretty obvious from my review (note: fangirling rumblings without stop is a better way to describe that review), and I cannot express with words how excited I was to read Hunting Prince Dracula. Of course, I preordered the book as soon as possible and the waiting began. Months of anticipation and teasers from the author and finally the book was in my hands! But than something unexplainable happened: I absolutely loved the gothic atmosphere of book two, I loved the mystery, which I didn't guess as soon as i did in book 1, but my dear Cresswell didn't make my heart jump out of my chest and didn't turn my breathing erratic as it was before. What happened, I asked myself? Was it due to the stress I am having at the moment in real life that everything feels less bright to me? But no, the answer was buried much deeper than the influence of the outside factors. Simply, Cresswell stopped to intrigue me as a character, because he lost the spark he had in book 1. What I mean is we have the same problem as many YA books before: a hero turns into obedient, character-less puppy in the presence of a strong independent feminist heroine. Sigh. I get that Audrey Rose is all modern and amazing, but why Cresswell's character must suffer because of it? What about strong male characters that could be equals to strong female characters? Everyone remember Rhett Butler. Huh? I don't remember him turning into a goo in the presence of a very strong Scarlett. Moreover, it seems that Cresswell lost his genius mind along with his temper. It literally explained to us because of his love for the heroine he couldn't deduct simplest of things. Well, if things has turn this way than I demand this couple to break up! If Cresswell was with me he wouldn't've lost a ounce of his geniality, that's it! Sorry for my rumble, but I was extremely disappointed with Cresswell in this book. I still hope book 3 will bring me back my snarky dashing hero with his geniality intact.\n\nApart from some out-of-character behavior I enjoyed the story a lot. I mean: Europe, Dracula's castle, secret passages, monstrous creatures and everything dashed with mystery and romance - a perfect mix to take one's mind from everyday problems. I felt myself fully engaged by the storytelling and couldn't wait to find out who the main culprit was. And in the case of Hunting Prince Dracula I didn't guess the murderer as soon as I did in book 1, and it added to the level of enjoyment I received from this story.\n\nI am extremely curious as how the story will evolve in book 3, what will be the main theme; what legend or real life murder case the author will choose for the story. Plus, you know, the story takes place in America and it's interesting to see our beloved characters in new surroundings testing their minds and relationship.\n\nThe writing was as perfect as in book one: the words were coming alive and flying from the pages in a cadence of perfect symmetry, and images were born before my eyes with a perfect clarity and a dash of morbid anticipation tickling my nerves in the best way possible (I love to test my nerves like that). I noticed more than once that I was reading some lines aloud, enjoying the way words were built into sentences and pictures in my head. Kerri Maniscalco once again proved to be a queen of storytelling. Bravo!\n\nIf you haven't read the book yet, I don't want to give extra details about the plot. Better dive into the story without knowing much about the storyline and enjoy every revelation waiting for you on book's pages. As for me, I am mostly satisfied with everything, but still waiting for some improvement for my dearest Cresswell. So hopefully my fangirling over his awesomeness will be back in book 3. And for those who haven't started this series yet: just give it a chance and maybe you will find the world of Thomas Cresswell and Audrey Rose Wadsworth to your liking, and, who knows, maybe even to you adoration *wink*.\n\n\"If you were guilty and wanted to hide, where might you go first?\"\n\n\"Depends on what I'm guilty of. Dirty thoughts or wanton follies, I'd send myself straight to your quarters to be punished.\"\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\n5 freaking stars!!!\n\nIf Nancy Drew and National Treasure had a book baby it would probably this book (just add gory murders).\n\nIf I had some issues with Stalking Jack the Ripper, this book managed to wipe all of it. It was phenomenally awesome!!!\n\nThe suspense, mystery, horror, adventure, and romance was superb! In the first book I had a problem with the identity of the culprit because it was too obvious, but with this book? My brain totally failed to guess the culprit. It was that surprising and good. The setting was more exciting because I love everything about Transylvania. This place is rarely featured in books and even movies, which made me more thrilled and happy to read this book.\n\nI still love Audrey Rose and Thomas Cresswell in this book. Audrey was somewhat different from the girl she was on the first book. She experiences extreme sadness because what happened in the first book. Well. There is no doubt that Thomas Cresswell managed to wipe me off my feet. I really wish this dude is a real person so I can make him mine. I love him so much. I love how smart, observant, brilliant, charming, flirty, and absolutely adorable he is.\n\nI'm glad how the sexual frustration was solved in this book. I was half-swooning, half-frustrated with their flirting because THEY ARE A TEASE. A FREAKING TEASE.\n\nI can't wait to read Escaping from Houdini!\n\nOctober 14, 2017\n\nThe Short\n\nActual rating: 4.5*\n\nPerfect for fans of: Stalking Jack the Ripper by Kerri Maniscalco (obviously as this is the sequel), And I Darken by Kiersten White (I haven't finished this one but it reminded me a bit of what I have read of it, mostly due to the setting)\n\nWriting: 4.5 stars\n\nCharacters: 4.5 stars\n\nPlot: 4.5 stars\n\nOriginality: 4.5 stars\n\n(All out of 5 stars)\n\nThe Long\n\nThis series is soooo good ahhhh. I listened to the audiobook for this one, which is what I did with the first book, and it was a great decision. The audiobooks are awesome, I highly recommend them.\n\nThe romance is this book was excellent. I've become very low tolerance in terms of romance in YA and its tendency to highlight very unhealthy relationships (possessive language, particularly). Before I read the first book, I expected to see a relationship I would hate, but I was pleasantly surprised to find quite the opposite. In this sequel, the relationship is really unpacked. Audrey Rose's position as a proper Victorian girl is brought even further into the spotlight as she and Thomas try to find a balance in their relationship. I loved that the power balance and her autonomy became a central focus of the book. It showed how a real relationship should work, IMO. Also Thomas is the first love interest I've found incredibly swoon worthy in a LONG time. But I love him. A lot. Although when he pretended to be dead to try and talk to her I was LIVID.\n\nAudrey Rose is an independent, intelligent young lady that calls Thomas out on his bullshit. It's amazing. She's super headstrong and driven and you see her developing even more into the precious scholar that she is in this sequel. Watching her learn and grow as this series goes on is an absolute pleasure. She is such a great heroine. The author writes the story in a way that gives you a true sense of how her mind works, with its tendency to favour logic and analysis (very left brained). It felt like I was watching the gears turn on a well oiled machine watching her to try and piece together the mystery. She's also a very authentic character. She went through a lot in the first book and you don't see her just brushing that aside. She has to work through her newfound fears in order to do what she loves again.\n\nThe setting in this book is where it stood out against SJTR. While SJTR did a wonderful job of immersing me in Victorian London, that's a place I've been many times (though I really do LOVE revisiting it). But this book is set in Romania and o h m y g o d THE CASTLES. I love castles and boy did this book ever have beautiful castles and just an overall enchanting setting. It was described wonderfully and it just felt like you were in a fairy tale. I loved it!\n\nThe mystery in this was jam packed with twists and turns and I loved how it pulled from the tale of Dracula. I've yet to read Bram Stoker's Dracula (I'm hoping to before the end of the month), but I am familiar with the legend, as I feel most are. It was a delightfully spooky Halloween read with this looming question of the supernatural hanging over the whole book. Just SO good.\n\nOverall, this series is excellent. Fantastically written (the descriptions are ON POINT), you follow characters that steal your heart (terrible joke if you've read the first one) as they trapeze around eerie locales trying to solve murder mysteries. It is great. If you're looking for the perfect Halloween read, look no further than this series!\n\nI'm so sad I have to wait a whole year for the next book.\n\nThis book ends with the characters heading off to America, I'm so curious what mystery the next book will tackle!\n\n*Thank you to Indigo for the ARC! All opinions expressed are my own, as per usual.*\n\nOctober 4, 2019\n\n‚ù• 5 / 5 stars\n\nOh my godddd. I‚Äôm so in love with this book. I already like Stalking Jack the Ripper but I think this one is much better and I love it even more. The location of ACADEMY OF FORENSIC MEDICINE AND SCIENCE in Romania is perfect. I also like when the characters discuss in the class. It‚Äôs so interesting for me because I don‚Äôt know about these things before and I‚Äôm always excited when it comes to their discussions.\n\nOh! And I‚Äôve got my new favorite characters from this series too which are Daciana Cresswell and Ileana ! I don‚Äôt know whether they will appear in the third book or not but I have high hope that they will appear at least just a little.üíï\n\nLast but not least, for Thomas and Audrey Rose, your SLOW BURN romance is KILLING me!! At first, I thought you would kiss only one time but thank god, you didn‚Äôt.ü§£\n\nFinally, Thomas Cresswell, you are officially my new book boyfriend. I‚Äôm so in love with you that sometimes I imagine I‚Äôm Audrey Rose!\n\nStalking Jack the Ripper (#1) : review\n\nHunting Prince Dracula (#2) : review\n\nJuly 18, 2024\n\n3.5‚≠êÔ∏è (rounded up)\n\nI know this is said to be others favorite in the series, but it just didn't hit for me like the first one did. What I really liked about this book was it was deeper and spent more time developing and setting up the scene rather than a crazy plot like the first book. Don't get me wrong! This book was still amazing and I had a lot of fun. It just didn't fully measure up to the first one.\n\nI loved the development of Audrey Rose and Thomas in this book. We don't see them together as much but their relationship still blossomed beautifully. I was still drawn to the characters, and I did like the fact that we got a lot more background on Thomas! Also, the introduction to Thomas's sister and her lover was beautiful.\n\nThe plot itself seemed to drag a bit for me in this one. Like I previously stated, it was deeper plot wise. The twists and turns didn't have that shock factor and the person behind the \"Prince Dracula\" murders was interesting, but not unique.\n\nI in no way think that this is a bad series. Of course there are going to be books that some people prefer over others, and this one just didn't hit the same for me. I will absolutely continue this series, though! I am so invested in this \"who dun it?\" plot and reading about all the clues and shocking events.\n\nMY FAVORITE SCENES AND QUOTES\n\n\"The world is neither kind nor is it cruel. It simply exists. We have the ability to view it however we choose.\"\n\nMonsters could wear the smiles of friends while secreting away the rotten soul of the Devil in the darkest crevices of themselves.\n\nHis eyes were my favorite constellations to gaze at; each fleck of gold surrounding his pupils were new galaxies begging to be discovered. I'd never been fascinated by astronomy before, but now found myself an eager student.\n\n\"For there are no limits to the stars; their numbers are infinite. Which is precisely why I measure my love for you by them. An amount too boundless to count.\"\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSlowly but surely I am knocking down my ever-growing TBR üò≠\n\nKerri do not disappoint me üò©\n\nAugust 25, 2019\n\nDefinitely enjoyed this one more than the first book, which gives me hope that perhaps I'll continue enjoying each sequel more than the previous one?\n\nJanuary 11, 2024\n\nÔΩ•:*:ÔΩ•Ôæü‚ÅÄ‚û∑ 4/5 ‚òÖ\n\nThis was sm fun!! ü§≠ü§≠ This book reminded me how much i love historical murder mysteries & the gothic atmosphere was *chefs kiss*.

An amount too boundless to count.‚Äù ~ ü•πü•π\n\nHunting Prince Dracula is the second book in the Stalking Jack the Ripper series, a historical murder mystery series. In this book, Audrey Rose and Thomas travel to a prestigious academy of forensic science in Romania, to recover after the horror of the Ripper case. But when they arrive, bodies start turning up and their deaths point to the return of legendary killer, Vlad the Impaler (Dracula). Are these rumors of the vampire prince's return false, or are their darker forces at play here?\n\n‚ÄúCatch me if I fall, all right?‚Äù\n\nA smile curved his lips in a most delightful manner. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already fallen hard, Wadsworth. Perhaps you should have warned me sooner.‚Äù\n\nI read the first book a while ago, but i just had sm fun with that one that i wanted to continue the series. And this sequel did not disappoint! It was honestly even better than the first book ü´∂ü´∂\n\nOne of my fav things about Kerri Maniscalco books is the atmosphere and setting. I absolutely loved the creepy castle this one was set in, and it made the whole vibe of the book gothic and a little creepy ‚ú®Ô∏è Kerri Maniscalco's writing can just develop an atmosphere so well üñ§üñ§\n\nPlus the plot of this one was so fun! ü´∂ü´∂ I haven't read a murder mystery in a while, so i just loved seeing the characters investigate the murders. And the way dracula and the creepy history of the place was incorporated into the mystery was really smart.\n\n‚ÄúI will gladly accept any and all books, however. A person can never have too much reading material. Especially on a fall or winter evening. If you‚Äôre feeling extra generous, you may include tea. I love a unique blend.‚Äù ~ she's literally me ‚úãÔ∏è\n\nThe characters were also pretty good! i like how all of the books follow the same characters, so i can really connect to them ü•∞\n\n‚ûµ Audrey Rose: not my fav mc ever (she can be annoying at times) but i do love how she's such a strong, independent woman even with the societal expectations of the time. YES QUEEN üíÖ\n\n‚ûµ Thomas: he's the star of the show FOR SURE ü§≠ü§≠ even tho he made some stupid decisions in here, but i still love him sm ü•πüíò His incessant flirting and sarcasm is literally the most entertaining thing ever ü´∂ü´∂\n\nThe romance was also fun! ‚ú®Ô∏è Isn't flirting while solving gruesome murders just the perfect way to fall in love?! üòçüòç the tension between audrey rose and thomas was so strong the whole book and the fact that we only got a few kisses? CRIMINAL üò©‚úãÔ∏è But i think they're a great couple üíì\n\n‚ÄúWe were all here to learn. He was the one who had a problem, not I. Perhaps it was time for fathers to teach their sons how to behave around young women. They were not born superior, no matter how society falsely conditioned them. We were all equals here.‚Äù ~ PREACH\n\n‚ÄúYou are not mine to take.‚Äù He brushed his lips against mine. Softly, so softly I might have imagined them there. My eyes fluttered shut. He could persuade me to build a steamship to the moon when he kissed me. We could orbit the stars together. ‚ÄúYou are yours to give.‚Äù\n\nThe reason i didn't absolutely love it was that i think the mystery was a little drawn out and the plot twist wasn't absolutely amazing. it wasn't bad, but it was a tad predictable- i did guess it and i'm TERRIBLE at guessing plot twists ü´£\n\n‚ÄúMr. Thomas Cresswell might not truly hold the title of prince, but the was perfectly fine. To me, he'd always be the king of my heart.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI refuse to believe you've misinterpreted my affections. I am wholly in love with you. And it is permanent.‚Äù\n\nOverall, a super fun read!! ü§≠ü§≠ I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Historical murder mystery\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Fun romance\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Gothic atmosphere‚ú®Ô∏è\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Fast-paced\n\nI'm very excited to get to the next book in the series üñ§üñ§\n\n„Ää 2024 Challenge: Book 7 of 115 „Äã\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAhhh I had such a good time with this book!! ü§≠ü§≠ a really fun historical murder mystery with an interesting story & stunning gothic atmosphere üñ§üñ§\n\nRtc! ü´∂\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\nI think I'm in for the ride with this series strictly because they're fun to listen to, but the characters both got on my nerves in this book and I still think Audrey Rose is hypocritical and her feminism is often blunt and overly modern for the time period. The plot in this one wasn't as interesting as it seemed from the description, but I still love the atmosphere that Maniscalco makes with the creepiness of the basement tunnels and the dead bodies and stuff.\n\nNot a huge fan of the romance because the angst is really choppy but i'm interested to see where it goes."
