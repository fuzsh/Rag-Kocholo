        "text": "Date of Award: November 10, 1879\n\nOn 4 April 1879 the three-masted schooner Sarah J. Fort of Tuckerton, NJ bound from Hoboken to Boston with a cargo of coal, wrecked about 1.5 miles west of Station No. 7, Second District, Cape Cod. A thick snowstorm was raging with a strong northerly gale and a heavy sea. Due to a navigational error, the vessel struck on one of the outer Peaked Hill bars at one o’clock in the morning, a quarter of a mile from the shore. The darkness, the snow, and her distance from land prevented her being discovered by the patrolman then on the beach. An hour later, two fresh patrolmen from Station No. 7, going in opposite directions, encountered small pieces of wreckage thrown up by the surf at their feet. They believed this had come from a vessel sunk near Scituate some days before and returned to the station to report. They then resumed their respective patrols. One of them arrived about a mile beyond the point where he had seen the wreckage and found pieces of a boat and deck-plank. He also dimly saw the outlines of the vessel. Hurrying back to the station, he roused the crew, who at once loaded the cart with the Lyle gun and appurtenances and started, under the lead of Keeper D. H. Atkins for the wreck.\n\nThe sand, converted by the snow and surf into a species of slush, was in a terrible condition for hauling and the progress of the men was greatly slowed. After getting on nearly a mile, Keeper Atkins hastened ahead of his men for observation. Upon sighting the wreck he judged her to be too distant to be reached by the Lyle gun and hurried back, taking a portion of his crew to fetch the Parrott gun, a heavier piece of ordnance, from the station. This was a grievous error because the Lyle gun, only recently supplied to the station, was superior. On his way back the keeper came upon a horse and cart. He immediately engaged the driver to convey the surfboat on its carriage, together with extra shot-lines, to the wreck while he and his detail took the Parrott gun on a hand-barrow. Making the most violent exertions, the advanced portion of the crew contrived to come abreast of the wreck about daybreak and the remainder with the heavy gun and the surfboat arrived within an hour later. Shortly afterward Keeper Young of Station No.6 joined them with three of his men. This was subsequently followed by Keeper Worthen and two men of Station No. 8. All lent energetic assistance to the operations.\n\nPreparations were immediately made for firing a line to the wreck. The tide was full and the magnitude and violence of the surf precluded boat service. The schooner’s hull was almost buried in the water which rushed over her and her crew of six men who were up in the fore-rigging, clinging for life. She lay nearly broadside to her main and mizzen masts. Masses of wreck-stuff continually flung from her already disintegrating frame. About seven o’clock, while the life-saving crew were using the ordnance, the main and mizzen masts fell.\n\nWith the Parrott gun and the shot-lines speedily brought into position by the crews, the firing began. From this time until nearly noon, nine shots were fired. None, however, succeeded in reaching the vessel. The firing was directly in the wind’s eye and the lines either fell short or were snapped by the heavy charges of powder employed to strain the gun’s carrying power. Before the firing ceased, the foremast fell. Still attached to the vessel, it thrashed and plunged about her hull. Fortunately, the tide had ebbed enabling the men to leave the rigging of the fallen spar and huddle together in the port bow. Although ebb tide, this small portion of the wreck to which the men clung, was the only part not submerged by the tremendous sea. During all the time of the firing the vessel steadily continued to break up. About ten o’clock the cook and the mate fell into the sea from exhaustion and perished. There were four survivors in the port bow.\n\nAt low tide conditions improved and an attempt with the boat became possible. The keeper, therefore, discontinued further effort with the gun and made up a selected crew of four men from No. 7 and three from No. 6. To these were added Captain Isaac F. Mayo, of Provincetown, a surfman of great experience and bravery, who had come upon the beach with a number of volunteers from the town.\n\nThe boat was launched. Keeper and crew sprang to their places, but at the same instant the surf boarded her and filled her half-full. She was immediately dragged back upon the beach, emptied, and made ready for a second trial. An interval of twenty minutes was allowed in the hope that the continuing ebb would diminish the surf and the effort was again renewed with the same crew. The launch was made and the boat cleared the first breaker. The second, however, combed over and filled her. A moment after, full to her gunwales, she rose on the summit of an enormous sea which cast her and her crew back upon the beach with a heavy shock, springing five of her timbers and splitting her garboard. The hardy men spilled from her, scrambling up, and hauling her out of reach of the surf. Examining the boat, they found her disabled and unfit for service.\n\nIt is probable that in the intense excitement and confusion following this failure, the injuries to the boat were magnified and that she might soon have been repaired and got ready for another trial. Another boat, however, was approaching. During the firing of the forenoon, Captain Harvey S. Cook of Provincetown came down to the beach in a buggy. He had driven back again to town, with the assent of Keeper Atkins, to send a whaleboat to the scene for service. This had had started Captain Mayo to the beach with a considerable number of townspeople. They arrived by a short cut in advance of the team.\n\nThe boat brought proved to be a different and smaller model than that originally proposed. This happened to be favorable given the conditions. She arrived upon the beach a short time after the failed surfboat launching and Captain Mayo assumed command. He chose a crew of fresh men, declining to receive on board Keeper Atkins and several members of his crew who pleaded to be allowed to go. In taking this course, Captain Mayo was undoubtedly justified for several reasons. The keeper and his men had eaten nothing since the evening before were much spent by their exertions since about three o’clock in the morning. Also their long exposure upon the wintry beach, could not reasonably be preferred to an unworn crew.\n\nAs soon as the preliminaries were settled, the launch was made. The life-saving crews assisted, but the boat instantly filled and had to be hauled up on the beach and emptied. Upon a second trial, the boat became half-full, but was pulled through the breakers. The crew bailed in the comparatively unbroken water outside. The most difficult and dangerous part of the exploit was then entered upon. The unstable sea was encumbered with masses of wreck debris--snarls of cordage, wefts of canvas, broken planks, and timbers convulsively driving and tumbling on every side. To pilot the boat through this obstructing and perilous drift required as much skill and patience as courage. The obstacles and dangers thickened as the wreck was gained and fresh difficulties were added by the helplessness of the exhausted men on board. The captain was especially exhausted. By taking time, and exercising great skill and perseverance, the remaining crewmen were finally taken off the wreck one by one. The boat being small, their number crowded her very much. Her management on the return to land was no easy matter. The hazard of the surf in a following sea was, of course, always great. Notwithstanding the precautions taken, a heavy wave swept up under the stern as the boat reached the last breaker and threw her end over end. This tossed every one on board into the surf and undertow. An instantaneous rush was made by all on shore and the people were seized by scores of hands and dragged from the water. Some were under the boat and all were in imminent danger of being swept away and drowned. It is fortunate that the great crowd of spectators provided much needed assistance. Otherwise, loss of life would probably have ensued.\n\nThe rescued men from the vessel were nearly insensible with cold and exhaustion when brought ashore. Their hands were badly frostbitten. They were at once conveyed to Station No. 7, where the life-saving crew, faint with hunger and fatigue, were gladdened to find that food had been prepared for all hands by the keeper’s wife and a mother of one of the station members. These ladies were also of great service in dressing the frostbitten hands of the rescued sailors, relieving the weary surfmen of this duty.\n\nIn recognition of the services he rendered in this rescue, Captain Mayo received the Gold Lifesaving Medal. It was to be regretted that Keeper Atkins’s success was not equal to his efforts on this occasion. He had always been regarded as an efficient keeper and his record for fidelity, courage, and energy at scenes of shipwreck was well-known to the officers of the USLSS.\n\nDate of Award: June 18, 1880\n\nAbout an hour after midnight on 3 February 1880, Patrolman Van Brunt, of Station No. 4, Fourth District, New Jersey came upon the schooner E.C. Babcock, of Somers’ Point, NJ. Driven near the shore by a storm, she was laden with cordwood and bound from Virginia to New York. Van Brunt caught sight of her red port running light and fired his Coston signal. The warning came late however, the schooner having got too near the beach to wear or tack. Ten minutes later, she struck within a hundred yards of the shore. Patrolman Van Brunt immediately went running to the station, a quarter of a mile to the south, and roused the crew. The keeper, Charles H. Valentine, was quite sick at the time, but he and his men turned out with the mortar-cart and traveled to the wreck with all speed. At times the wheels sank in the hollows of the beach and had to be lifted out. The hard journey was accomplished in a very short time. They determined the position of the vessel by the dull red spot of her port lantern. With this to guide his aim, the keeper attempted to fire a shot-line across the deck of the schooner, beneath her rigging.\n\nThe first attempt failed because the frozen line broke. The second shot had better fortune, carrying the line between the fore-stay and jib halyards. The men on board seized and hauled in the line. A few minutes sufficed to bend on the hauling-lines and the hawser was soon dragged out to the vessel. The first person that came ashore was a black man, who told, the crew that the captain’s wife and two children were on board. After the breeches buoy was sent back, it was quickly hauled ashore again, bearing the captain’s wife. The next to come was the captain with his six year-old. The mate soon followed with the captain’s other girl, ten years old. Then, one by one, three sailors were drawn to land, being all on board.\n\nHaste characterized this energetic rescue. Within one hour and fifty minutes after the vessel struck, the eight people on board the crumb­ling schooner were safe on land. They were taken to a nearby cottage where the custodian cared for them properly. By ten o’clock the next morning, the deserted vessel had broken into fragments and her cargo rolled and tumbled about the surf.\n\nTheir work at the wreck of the E.C. Babcock over, Captain Valentine and the crew of Station No. 4 reloaded the cart with the apparatus and lines, arrived at the station by five o’clock in the morning. After taking breakfast they fell to work, with the exception of two men who went out on patrol, cleaning and arranging the lines and getting the apparatus in working order. At 10:00 AM they were still busy in the boat-room, when a patrolman bounded in with the news that a brig was coming dead for the shore. The keeper, however, held them at their tasks, commanding them to hurry. He realized nothing could be done until the apparatus was ready. A few minutes later, the keeper went to the door and looked out over the swollen surf. Able to see for a great distance, he saw the Spanish brig, Augustina, rushing toward the station. Bound from Havana to New York, she had a crew of 8 and a cargo of cedar and hides. Though several of the crew could be seen huddled up against the house, the man at the wheel steered with composure despite being soaked by a massive wave. Within minutes the vessel struck head on with a tremendous shock and she swung around broadside to the sea, heeled down upon her side.\n\nAbout 200 men and women had gathered upon the sand dunes. Within ten minutes after the vessel struck, the crew was on site with the apparatus. The Lyle gun was hastily prepared and the shot fired. The line, however, broke shortly after fired. Another shot had the same result. The brig, in the meantime, had been driven further into the shore. Surfman Garrett H. White, running into the surf as far as possible, succeeded in casting the heaving-stick and line on board, forward of the main rigging. The sailors seized the cord and hauled the whip-line on board. An ugly mishap now occurred. The sailors getting the tail-block on the end of the whip, pulled it on deck, but did not appear to know what to do with it. They paid no attention to the instructions in two languages. The E.C. Babcock, meanwhile, had broken up and while the sailors were dallying with the whip-line, its slack became entangled with the debris.\n\nThis current was interrupted by Augustina’s hull. This caused an eddying swirl that held the great mass of the wreckage between the beach and the vessel. The whip-line thus fouled was carried by the eddy towards the bow of the brig, where it was caught and held by the port anchor. The life-saving men vainly tried to direct the sailors to arrange the line properly. Spaniards failed to comprehend the warning gestures of the men on the beach and they hurriedly used the line as they supposed and tried to ashore hand over hand. This would have been a hazardous venture in such a sea under the most fav­orable circumstances, but the debris made it all the more dangerous. The course the sailors took could only have been adopted in the temerity of ex­treme fear. The life-saving crew tried vainly to stop them.\n\nIn a few moments one of the half-naked group was hanging on the line and pulling himself along through the sea. He had made about half the distance when the surf flung him over the whip-line. He held on, but the two parts of the line crossed and caught him by the neck, almost strangling him. Surfman Garrett H. White rushed waist deep into the breakers, holding to the line, and disentangled him. At that moment a rush of the driftwood threw both men off their feet and they were swept from the line. Surfman White, by a desperate effort, regained a foothold in the undertow and succeeded in landing him. Meanwhile, two more of the sailors were swinging along the line. Surfman John Van Brunt tried to get to one, but the driftwood knocked him off his feet. Thrown into peril, a number of fishermen on the beach rescued him.\n\nIn the mean time Surfman White and an outsider had dragged in the sailor. The third sailor from the wreck was on his way when the sea tore him from his hold. For a few moments he was struggling in the water, then fell upon some driftwood. Surfman Potter sprang for him, but was thrown from his feet on to the driftwood. Upon his back, Potter was held down by the whip-line, which was tautened by the current across his chest. He managed to extricate himself from the line, and was washed seaward. He fortuitously got a spar on the next incoming breaker and made out to struggle to the beach. During these efforts Surfman Ferguson had reached the imperiled sailor and dragged him to the land. Surfman Lockwood went for the fourth sailor and was hurled from his feet into the surf like his comrades, but kept hold of his man and brought him in. In this way, five sailors of the Augustina were saved. It is as wonderful as fortunate that the crew accomplished this gallant rescue without loss of life. The risks run by the life-saving crew, and those who aided them, were extreme. “Three of my men,” Captain Valentine afterwards remarked, “I never expected to see again.” The Augustina was soon completely demolished by the sea. Her mainmast, which was about 120 feet long, was ultimately placed as a flagstaff on an elevation over­looking the ocean where she was destroyed.\n\nThe inspector who shortly after its occurrence visited the scene of disaster and ascertained the facts connected with it, closed his account with the following comment and recommendations:\n\nThe services of the crew of Station 4 during the gale in successfully rescuing the crews of the two vessels, one of them in the darkness of night, and the other under the most unpromising circumstances for success, were of an extraordinary character, and their efforts deserve something more than honorable mention; for in addition to their prompt performance of the important duty for which they are employed, they dis­played the most indomitable courage in braving the dangers to life and limb with which the lumber-laden surf was fraught, to rescue their fellow beings from almost certain destruction.\n\nIn my opinion, no man could have undertaken to encounter the perils of a surf thick with cord-wood and floating spars and timbers without imminent risk of life and that these men nobly carried their lives in the hands which they extended to the imperiled Spanish sailors, Is beyond all question.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that Surfmen Garrett H. White, B. C. Potter, Nelson Lockwood, William H. Ferguson, and John Van Brunt be rewarded by medals of the first class, and that Keeper Charles H. Valentine be similarly rewarded for his gallant and conspicuous devotion to the service and the cause of humanity in his conduct of the operations of his station during the stirring events of the morning, as well as for actually venturing his life in exposing himself to the fury of such a storm while in impaired health.\n\nDate of Award: June 10, 1881\n\nOn 3 February 1880 the schooner George Taulane of Camden, NJ, with a crew of eight, was bound from Virginia to New York with a cargo of cordwood when it wrecked on the Jersey shore. This wreck produced the most protracted suffering for those on board and involved loss of life. It also became an occasion for perseverance so noble and loyal under the most discouraging hardships and trials for the lifesaving crews engaged. In this they displayed the highest level of heroism without taking into account the dauntless courage which accompanied it. The evening before the vessel was off the Highlands of Navesink in 11 fathoms of water, with every prospect of soon reaching her destination, when a snowstorm began. The weather so thick it became dangerous to attempt a run for Sandy Hook.\n\nThe captain, therefore, stood off shore, getting the vessel into 15 fathoms of water. Gradually the storm grew into a furious gale. The schooner labored heavily. At two o’clock in the morning, the deck-load started plunging and staggering vessel. To make matters worse, the schooner was soon on fire communicated from the forecastle stove. The flames spread to her deckload and it was thought that she would have to be abandoned. At length, however, the fire was quenched with great difficulty. During all these troubles the vessel drifted toward the beach. Hoping still to save her, the captain let go both anchors when about a mile from land. This step proved disastrous and made the rescue of those on board a task of stupendous difficulty.\n\nThe anchors at first clawed the bottom and brought the vessel head to the wind; but immediately after, the strong current setting to the southward, and the force of the storm, made them drag without holding. The vessel, broadside to the gale, swung helplessly in the trough of the tremendous sea. The water swept everything off her deck and did not give the men time to slip the cables. They could only scramble aloft for their lives. The result was three of them in the fore rigging and four in the main. The violent swaying of the hull almost jerked them from their hold. Going along with the current, they plowed through the breakers. Drawing nearer to the beach they saw the life-saving crew of Station No. 11, Fourth District (NJ).\n\nThe crew followed along the shore with lines and heaving-sticks in their hands intent to render assistance. The captain afterwards said that the very fact of seeing this determined squad gave new life to his despairing men. The life-saving crew had seen the vessel nearing the beach. When she dropped her anchors and began to drag along the coast, over two miles south of Station No. 11, they followed joined by a few fishermen who were on the beach. Knowing that no boat could get out in such a sea, they took only heaving-sticks and lines. Furthermore, they wisely calculated that the vessel would ground near Station No.12.\n\nThe patrolman of No. 12 had, meanwhile, seen the vessel something over a mile north of that station when she dropped her anchors and hurried back to notify the keeper, Captain. William P. Chadwick. At once he ordered out the mortar-cart with the apparatus and started for the wreck with the crew. The tide was unusually full, being four feet higher on the beach than at ordinary high tides. The beach consequently was covered with a frothing flood and the only road to the wreck was across the skirting beach hills of sand. A number of these hills had been split by the sea and sluices had formed. The water rushed into these every minute under the pressure of the surf and poured back again. In these rushing streams debris soon increased and menaced the adventurous crewmen .who often had to wade hip-deep across these ugly fords.\n\nSoon a man from No. 11 joined the crew of No.12. The conditions of travel over the inundated waste made hauling by hand necessary for at least portions of the distance, but a team of horses, taken along by Chadwick, followed the cart. It was half-past eight when the journey began. The wind was then blowing hard and the sleet came down furiously. On every other side was a dismal stretch of interlocked knolls of sand. The loaded cart thus plodded on for about a quarter of a mile. The horses were then hitched to the cart and got half a mile further. When they reached a deep sluiceway, they refused to pull. The men again took hold and hauled the load across the beach, waist-deep in water. The team was again used until another sluiceway intervened. Once more the men dragged the mortar-cart. The horses were then put on again, but the water got so deep that they could no longer draw. The men took the burden in hand and tugged until they came abreast the wreck between nine and ten o’clock. There they met and were reinforced by Keeper Britton C. Miller and the crew of No. 11. With six additional volunteers the rescue party now numbered nineteen men.\n\nA singular and memorable struggle was now entered upon. The vessel drifted and rolled fearfully. Her hull almost submerged in the foaming seas which fled across it. She was about 400 yards from shore. The crewmen were in her rigging. One of them hung by his arms over a ratline with one leg through below and Keeper Chadwick at once remarked, \"There is one man gone; we will never save him.\" Without delay the Lyle gun was planted on the summit of a sand hill and fired. The line leapt from the muzzle across the flying jib-stay. It could not, unfortunately, be used by the men on board and it had to be hauled back. The vessel continued to drag her anchors to the south and the heroic march along her flank and through the floods and sluices began.\n\nThe clefts in the hills had increased and the way was trenched with tide-filled runnels of various depths and breadths. The men splashed and staggered through these with their load. With great labor and difficulty 200 yards were made and a sand hill was reached. From here they fired another shot. The line, however, was now heavier and the firing point was further from the vessel. This shot fell short. The cart was reloaded and the men got on about 400 yards to another unflooded hillock, from whence a third shot was fired. The line parted. The vessel was still reeling along shore in a southerly direction.\n\nThe devoted crews again loaded up the cart and resumed their mission. From first to last their difficulties and the perils that beset them never slackened. The wheels of the cart \"sanded down\" so rapidly that the conveyance had to be constantly kept on the move lest it should be lost. Often, in order to lighten it, the cart had to be partially unloaded and portions of the apparatus carried by the crews. At other times the men would have to fling themselves upon the wheels and hold them with all their strength to prevent the cart from being capsized by the overwhelming rushes of the sea over the axles. All the time, moreover, the ocean tore off and smashed the upper works of the vessel, scattering the pieces. This continued and the surf was full of debris that constantly hurled over the sand hills in the paths of the advancing lifesavers.\n\nOn the less inundated ground several men were knocked down by flying pieces of wood. Others suffered bruises and contusions. Four months afterward, Keeper Chadwick’s .right arm was still lame from one of the blows. The escapes were numerous. It was with great difficulty that the men could keep their feet in these conditions. But not a man fell away nor flinched from the work. The volunteers, like the crews, bore the labor with indomitable courage and composure and obediently followed the direction of the leader.\n\nThe care and patience observed by the men in their operations were no less remarkable. Not the least difficult of their tasks was keeping the lines and the powder dry. Aside from the number of actual firings, at least a dozen times the cart was hurriedly unloaded on the nearest eminence, the gun planted, and the shot-line arranged for the effort when the wreck would suddenly roll away upon her course. The men would then have to reload the cart and toil on again after her. In this way they worked down along the beach to No. 12 and a quarter of a mile beyond it. When chance offered another shot, the line parted. The crew again moved on stubbornly.\n\nIt was now noon, suddenly the man long seen hanging in the rigging, fell into the sea and was gone. The crew still followed the vessel. Half an hour later, they saw another man drop lifeless from the ratlines. Laboring forward now for the rescue of the remaining five, they suffered a misfortune. In staggering and floundering through one of the worst sluiceways with the cart, the gun toppled off into the flood and was lost. A desperate search was at once made, and finally the gun was found in four or five feet of water. Fished up and wiped dry it was, thenceforth, carried by the stout keeper on his shoulder.\n\nA man was dispatched back to No. 12 for a dry shot-line, while the crew moved on to a point three-quarters of a mile below the station. Here they got another chance to fire a shot that fell short. The tide had forced the firing party farther and farther back on the hills and the line was too wet and heavy. The cart was again reloaded and the march resumed. A mile below the station, the man overtook them with the dry shot-line and chance for a sixth shot was offered. This time it was a success. The line flew between the foremast and the jib-stay. The sailors got hold of it and fastened it to the fore and main rigging.\n\nAs the schooner still continued to drift and roll nothing could be done, but while crewmen loaded the cart, three or four kept fast hold of the shore end of the shot-line and kept pace with the wreck. At the end of another quarter of a mile, the vessel suddenly stopped and the time had come at last. The whip line, with its appurtenances, was bent on to the shot line, hauled aboard, and made fast by the tail of the block to the mainmast head. The wreck now rolled frightfully. The hawser followed the whip-line on board and the breeches buoy was rigged on. The vessel, however, rolled so that it was impossible to set the hawser up on shore in the usual manner. So it was hove through the bull’s-eye in the sand-anchor, while several men held on to the end to give and take with each roll of the vessel. The work of hauling the sailors from the wreck was now begun with electric energy.\n\nAfter two men were landed the vessel took the ground, but the circumstance increased her rolling. In fact the breeches buoy with a man in it, swung in the offshore roll fifty feet in the air. The strain and friction upon the hawser were so great that the lignum-vitae bullseye, through which it ran at the sand anchor was worn fully half an inch deep during thirty minutes of use. Within those thirty minutes, however, the five men were safely landed, the last man getting out of the buoy at 2:30.\n\nThe distance the life-saving crews followed the vessel with the loaded cart appears to have been over three miles. The time rescue also occupied no less than six hours. When the various conditions of the enterprise are considered, it is nothing less than marvelous that the heroic courage and the lofty endurance of these men were not fruitless, but resulted in a successful rescue. The most experienced beachman said that he never saw a time when the chances of rescue seemed so improbable. That those chances were outweighed is due to the noble pulses that beat so strongly that wild February day in the generous blood of nineteen men, of whom their country have reason to be proud. No commentary can add to the plain record of what they did and suffered for the five men they saved.\n\nThe names of the six gallant volunteers assisted with this rescue were William L. Chadwick, Isaac Osborn, David B, Fisher, David B. Clayton, Abner R. Clayton, and Abner Herbert. The crew of No. 11 included Keeper Britton C. Miller and Surfmen William H. Brower, Louis Truex, Abram J. Jones, Charles W. Flemming, and Demerest T. Herbert. Those of No.12 included Keeper William P. Chadwick and Surfmen Peter Sutfin, Benjamin Truex, Tyler C. Pearce, William Vannote, Charles Seaman, James Numan, and John Flemming. The vessel was a total wreck.\n\nDate of Award: November 8, 1880\n\nThe gratifying record of so many human lives preserved also has the sad obverse of loss. On 23 April 1880 the crew of Station No. 2, Tenth District (Point-aux-Barques, MI), one of the most gallant and skillful crews in the service, lost six of seven members. It is the second time in its history that the establishment had had to mourn the loss of a life-saving crew. The first instance was at the wreck of the Italian bark Nuova Ottavia on the coast of North Carolina in 1876. This latter tragedy, however, had a great degree of uncertainty regarding what caused the deaths of the crewmen. The Point aux Barques disaster, on the other hand, is fully known through the evidence of a single survivor, and the calamity in all its details can be recounted. Nothing could be sadder than the story of this sacrifice. It is here given in the report of the district superintendent, who immediately visited the locality and investigated the circumstances.\n\n\"I arrived at Sand Beach the evening of the 24th, and learned there that the life-saving crew were lost in their attempt to reach a vessel in distress off their station, and that the vessel had afterwards got out of trouble and was then lying at the breakwater at Sand Beach. As the steamer on which I was going up was to remain there a little while, I went out and saw the master of the vessel and got his statement, which is substantially as follows:\n\n\"‘I am the master and owner of the scow J.H. Magruder, of Port Huron. Her tonnage is 136.71. The crew consists of myself and four men, namely, Frank Cox, Thomas Purvis, Eddy Hendricks, and Thomas Stewart. I have my wife and two little children aboard. I left Alcona with a load of 187,000 feet of lumber for Detroit at noon the 22nd instant, wind north, fresh. Sighted Point aux Barques light at ten o’clock that night, wind east, light, but breezing up. Took gaff-topsails in at eleven o’clock. When abreast of light we commenced listing bad to starboard. Saw we were making great leeway and the lee rail under water. Discovered here, for the first time, that the vessel was leaking badly, with two feet of water in the hold. About midnight was laboring very heavy, with high wind and heavy sea. I feared we would roll over, and was satisfied we could not weather the reef. Got both anchors ready and let go about 2 AM the 23rd, when she immediately righted. Had fourteen feet of water under the stern, and at every heavy surge on the chains she would drag anchor, the seas breaking over her bows. Hung a red light in main rigging, as a signal of distress to the life-saving station. I certainly feared the vessel would be lost, and that our lives were in great danger, if assistance was not rendered. The vessel would strike bottom between every heavy sea. At daybreak I displayed my ensign at half-mast, union down, and about 7:30 AM observed the answering signal from the station. About eight o’clock saw the surfboat coming out. We were about three miles southeast from the station. Lost sight of surfboat in a few moments; thought the sea was too heavy for her, and that she had gone back, but in about 1.5 hours (9:30) saw her again about one mile north of us, pulling to the eastward, to get out of the breakers on the reef. In a short time I saw her go down in the troughs of a heavy sea, and when she came up we saw she had capsized. We saw them right her and bail out, when she again started to pull for us. In about twenty minutes she again capsized. Saw several men clinging to her, for some time, but finally saw only one. Our boat was in good condition. She is 16 feet long. Did not think of launching her. No ordinary yawl-boat could live in such a sea. I thought the life-saving crew used good judgment in crossing the reef where they did. I then commenced throwing my deck-load overboard, and at noon, the wind shifting to the northeast, we made all sail and started, cleared the reef, and arrived in Sand Beach all safe, but leaking badly. The weather was piercing cold, and all that day the spray would freeze as it came aboard of us.’\"\n\nThe superintendent continues:\n\n\"I arrived at Huron City at one o’clock Sunday morning (25th). The two dead bodies of surfmen Petherbridge and Nantau were put aboard of the steamer here, and sent down to Detroit, by direction of their friends. I arrived at the station at 3 AM, and found Keeper Kiah in a very bad condition, both mentally and physically. The sad story of his experience, and the loss of his brave crew, is as follows:\n\n\"‘A little before sunrise on the morning of the 23d, James Nantau, on watch on the lookout, reported a vessel showing signal. I got up, and saw a small vessel about three miles from the station, bearing about east and by south. She was flying signal-of-distress flag at half-mast. I saw that she was at anchor close outside the reef. All hands were immediately called; ran the boat out on the dock; and, when ready to launch, Surfman Deegan, on patrol north, came running to the station, having discovered the vessel from McGuire’s Point, 1.5 miles north from the station. At this time a warm cup of coffee was ready, of which we all hastily partook, and a little after sunrise (5:15 by our time) we launched the boat. Wind east, fresh, sea running northeast, surf moderately heavy. We pulled out northeast until clear of the shore surf, and then I headed to cross the reef where I knew there was sufficient water on it to cross without striking bottom. ‘We crossed the reef handsomely, and found the sea outside heavier than we had expected, but still not so heavy as we had experienced on other occasions. After getting clear from the breakers of the reef, the boys were in excellent spirits, and we were all congratulating ourselves how nicely we got over. I then bore down towards the vessel, heading her up whenever I saw a heavy sea coming. When heading direct for the vessel, the sea was about two points of the compass forward of our port beam, and for the heaviest seas I had frequently to head the boat directly for, or dodge them. When about a quarter of a mile from the vessel, and half a mile outside the reef, and very nearly one mile from the nearest point of land, I saw a tremendous breaker coming for us. I had barely time to head her for it, when it broke over our stern and filled us. I ordered the boys to bail her out before the sea had got clear of her stern, but it became apparent at once that we could not free her from water, as the gunwales were considerably under water amidships, and two or three minutes after she was capsized. We then righted her, and again were as quickly capsized. We righted her a second time, but with the same result. I believe she several times capsized and righted herself after that, but I cannot distinctly remember. As near as I can judge, we filled about one hour after leaving the station. For about three-quarters of an hour we all clung to the boat, the seas occasionally washing us away, but having our cork jackets on, we easily got back again. At this time Pottenger gave out, perished from cold, dropped his face in the water, let go his hold, and we drifted slowly away from him. We were all either holding on the lifelines or upon the bottom of the boat, the latter position difficult to maintain owing to the seas washing us off. Had it been possible for us to remain on the bottom of the boat, we would all have been saved, for in this position she was buoyant enough to float us all clear from the water. My hope was that we would all hold out until we got inside the reef where the water was still. I encouraged the men all I could, reminded them that there were others, their wives and children, that they should think of, and to strive for their sakes to keep up, but the cold was too much for them, and one after another each gave out as did the first. Very little was said by any of the men; it was very hard for any of us to speak at all. I attribute my own safety to the fact that I was not heated up when we filled. The men had been rowing hard and were very warm, and the sudden chill seemed to strike them to the heart. In corroboration of this theory I would say that Deegan, who did the least rowing, was the last to give out. All six perished before we had drifted to the reef. I have a faint recollection of the boat grating or striking the reef as she passed over it, and from that time until I was taken to the station, I have but little recollection of what transpired. I was conscious only at brief intervals. I was not suffering, had no pain, had no sense of feeling in my hands, felt tired, sleepy, and numb. At times I could scarcely see. I remember screeching several times, not to attract attention, but thought it would help the circulation of the blood. I would pound my hands and feet on the boat whenever I was conscious. I have a faint recollection of when I got on the bottom of the boat, which must have been after she crossed the reef. I remember too in the same dreamy way of when I reached shore; remember of falling down twice, and it seems as if I walked a long distance between the two falls, but I could not have done so, as I was found within thirty feet of the boat. I must have reached the shore about 9:30 AM, so that I was about 3.5 hours in the water. I was helped to the station by Mr. Shaw, lightkeeper, and Mr. McFarland; was given restoratives, dry clothes were put on, my limbs were dressed, and I was put to bed. I slept till noon (two hours), when my wife called me, saying that Deegan and Nantau, had drifted ashore, and were in the boatroom. My memory from this time is clear. I thought possibly these two men might be brought to life, and, under my instructions, had Mr. Shaw and Mr. Pethers work at Deegan for over an hour, while I worked over Nantau for the same time, but without success. I then telegraphed to the superintendent and the friends of the crew. The four other men were picked up between 1 and 2 PM, all having come ashore within a quarter of a mile from the station. The surfboat and myself came ashore about one mile south of the station, the bodies drifting in the direction of the wind, and the boat more with the sea. I ordered coffins for all. On the 24th, Hiram Walker, of Detroit, telegraphed to ship the bodies of Petherbridge and Nantau to Detroit, which I did, together with their effects. The other four men were delivered to their friends, all residents of this county.\n\n\"‘The following are the names of the lost crew: William I. Sayres, Robert Morison, James Pottenger, Dennis Deegan, James Nantau, and Walter Petherbridge. Sayres and Morison were widowers. Sayres leaves five children, the youngest eight years old. Morison leaves three children, the youngest six years old. This would be the third season for these two men at the station. Pottenger and Deegan each leave a wife and four children, the youngest two months old each. This was the second season for these two men at the station. Nantau and Petherbridge were single men, and this was their first season at the station.’\n\n\"Mr. Samuel McFarland makes the following statement:\n\n\"’I am a farmer, and was working on the farm about one-fourth of a mile from where the surfboat came ashore, when I heard gulls screeching, as I supposed, several times, but paid no attention to it. Presently my two dogs started to run for the cliff, and thinking that somebody might be calling from the shore, I went to the edge of the high cliff overlooking the lake, and saw a boat bottom up about 100 rods from shore, with one man on it. Not knowing that the station crew were out, started to notify them of what I saw. Upon getting to the station, about 9 o’clock, and learning that they were out, concluded it was the surf-boat I had seen, and went to the light-house after Mr. Shaw to accompany me to where the boat was drifting in. When we got there the boat was ashore, and Captain Kiah was standing on the beach about 30 feet from the boat, with one hand holding on to the root of a fallen tree, and with the other hand steadying himself with a lath-stick, and swaying his body to and fro, as if in the act of walking, but not stirring his feet. He did not seem to realize our presence. His face was so black and swollen, with a white froth issuing from his mouth and nose, that we did not at first know who he was. We took him between us, and with great difficulty walked him to the station. Several times on the way he would murmur, \"Poor boys, they are all gone.\" At one time he straightened out his legs, his head dropped back, and we thought he was dying, but he soon recovered again. Upon reaching the station he was given restoratives, his clothes were removed, and he was put to bed. His legs from above the knees were much swollen, bruised and black.’\n\n\"Mr. Shaw corroborates this statement from the time he took part in it.\n\n\"I attended the funerals of Deegan and Pottenger, the 25th, and hope I may be spared from ever again witnessing so sad a scene. The wives of these two brave men were almost crazed by their great loss, and the cries of the poor children left fatherless, were heart-rending in the extreme. It is sincerely to be hoped that the bill now pending in Congress, granting pensions to the families of surfmen who lose their lives in the discharge of their duty, will become a law, so that the families of these truly brave men may be compensated to the extent of its provisions.\n\n\"In conclusion, I would state that I feel very keenly the loss of this crew, but I can lay the blame at no one’s door. It was one of those unfortunate accidents that are liable to occur with the best of men and under the best management, but not likely to occur twice in a lifetime. Had the boat been two seconds earlier or later, the sea would have broken ahead of her, or she would have passed over it before breaking; but upon straightening up the boat there was no time left to back or dodge. The sea broke when she lay in the most critical position to take it. Certainly it was the duty of the crew to answer to the signal of distress, and certainly they responded most promptly. There was no discord here; there was more than a friendly feeling existing between the keeper and crew. They had together made a good record at their station, and when duty called each strove to be foremost in the boat.\n\n\"I have conversed with several who have served with Keeper Kiah, and all speak in the highest praise of him as a man, and of his superior skill in handling a surf-boat. He has the sympathy of the entire community, including the friends and relatives of his dead crew, in his present trouble.\"\n\nThe closing incident in the Point-aux-Barques tragedy was the resignation of the stanch keeper, too shattered in mind and body, for the time at least, to retain his position. Thus the heroic station was by a day’s experience left at once vacant of its crew, who, this very year, had saved nearly a hundred lives.\n\nDate of Award: December 3, 1884\n\nAbout 7 o’clock in the evening on 31 October 1884, during a hard northwesterly, the three-masted schooner Sophia Minch arrived off the harbor of Cleveland, OH with a cargo of iron ore from Marquette, MI. While attempting to run in, however, the heavy sea disabled her rudder. She at once came to with both anchors off the east pier and hoisted a signal for assistance. The tug Peter Smith answered the call and steamed out to her. Two of the crew of the Cleveland Station (Ninth District) accompanied to assist in handling the lives. The captain of the Minch, deeming one tug insufficient to tow his vessel, refused to heave up his anchors until another tug could be procured.\n\nThe Smith, therefore, returned and obtained the assistance of the Fanny Tuthill. Keeper Goodwin and the rest of the life-saving crew, save one man left in charge of the station, jumped on board the Smith as she again steamed out to assist the disabled craft. Once alongside it was only with the greatest difficulty that the life saving men gained the schooner’s deck, one man, Surfman Distel, being left on the tug to aid in handling the lines. As soon as the anchors were tripped, the two tugs started with the vessel in tow. Before going very far, however, both towlines parted. The two tugs, unable to do anything further, sought safety behind the breakwater. The sea then began dragging the vessel towards the rocky shore. It was also discovered that the water was finding its way into the hold and the men were sent to the pumps. They could do very little, however, as they took every effort to save from being washed overboard.\n\nThe captain, fearful of the vessel driving onto the rocks, had a hasty consultation with Keeper Goodwin and resolved to scuttle her. He planned to let her sink to the sandy bottom where she would not receive so much damage and trusting to the chances of raising her after the storm. The scuttling was accomplished by boring auger holes in the deck forward. The schooner, in a short time, sank in shoal water with her deck just awash. All those on board, except two men, took to the fore rigging for safety. The other two, a surfman belonging and the mate, were cut off from the rest and were compelled to climb into the mizzen rigging.\n\nSurfman Distel, who had landed from the tug Smith, acted promptly. He, however, had only one of the station crew to assist him. Though it was now between 2 and 3 o’clock in the morning, he cast about for volunteers. Customs Inspector Bates, the lighthouse keeper, George H. Tower, and three others, Messrs. Pryor, Duffy, and Tovat, promptly responded to the appeal. The latter, with his team to draw the apparatus cart, took the beach gear abreast of the sunken vessel. The first shot was successful, carrying the line just abaft the fore rigging. In a short time the gear was rigged and the breeches buoy hauled off. Keeper Goodwin was the first to come ashore to take charge of the operation. The rest in the fore rigging following one by one until all but Surfman Hatch were safely landed.\n\nThere were also the two men in the rigging aft who were unable to get forward. Surfman Distel volunteered to go off in the buoy to consult with Hatch as to the best means of saving the two men. The result was that Hatch agreed to attempt to reach the mizzen rigging and see what could then be done. It was an extremely hazardous undertaking, as the main boom and gaff were swaying from one side to the other in a most frightful manner. Literally taking his life in his hands, he told Distel that if he did not return in a reasonable time, it might be taken for granted it was impossible for him to do so. He further advised him to return to shore in the buoy and report the situation to the keeper.\n\nHatch succeeded in reaching the after part of the vessel and found the men safe, but it was utterly impossible for him to get back. Distel, therefore, faithfully followed out his instructions and when his comerade failed to return, he gave the signal to be drawn ashore and made known the facts to Captain Goodwin. As soon, therefore, as Distel could be sent off again, the gear was unrigged, the gun got into position, and communication established with the other end of the vessel. It took Hatch only a little while to haul off the whip and hawser. As soon as everything was all right, they were drawn safely ashore, Hatch being the sixteenth and last man to be rescued.\n\nThe-whole affair reflected great credit both on the members of the life-saving crew and upon the little band of volunteers, who came so bravely forward to assist Distel in landing his comrades and those belonging to the vessel. The personal effects of the captain and crew were recovered and landed subsequently when daylight gave them the opportunity. A few days later (November 4), the station crew boarded the vessel and assisted in stripping her of sails and rigging, On the day following, they aided in setting up a steam-pump on her deck and removing a portion of the cargo. When all the arrangements were completed (6 November), she was floated and taken into the harbor.\n\nOn 1 November, during the same gale that damaged the schooner Sophia Minch, the three-masted schooner John B. Merrill of Milwaukee, WI hove into sight off Cleveland Harbor. She was inbound from Escanaba, MI deeply laden with iron ore. A vessel of nearly six hundred-fifty tons and carried a crew of ten persons including the captain’s wife, who acted as cook. It was about 5 o’clock when she was met and taken in tow by the steam-tug James Amadeus. The latter had brought almost under the shelter of the breakwater, when the towline parted and the schooner began drifting toward the beach. The tug succeeded in getting a line to her again and renewed the attempt to tow her in, but the towline snapped a second time. The schooner was now so near the breakers that it was dangerous for the tug to again risk an attempt. As a last resort the anchors were let go, but failed to hold.\n\nThe life-saving crew closely watched the two vessels. As soon as it became apparent that the schooner must go ashore, Keeper Goodwin ordered the beach apparatus out. As it was already dark, the keeper started down the beach after giving his orders so as to keep track of the vessel. It was about half past 6 when the vessel stopped a little less than half a mile east of the station and nearly abreast of the Lake Shore Railroad freight house. It was, therefore, in close proximity to the sunken Sophia Minch.\n\nAs soon as she struck, the captain ordered the hatches opened in order to let her fill with water and remain steady. This saved the ship from thumping itself to pieces. This was a wise precaution, as she lay on the smooth, sandy bottom and it prevented her from driving up onto the rocks. Some of the volunteers, Messrs. Tower, Bates, Tovat, and Assistant Lightkeeper Reed, who had assisted the station crew in the morning with the Sophia Finch, were soon on hand. They rendered excellent service in getting the apparatus down and with the subsequent operations. The relief party arrived abreast of the vessel, which lay about four hundred feet from shore, at a quarter before 8. As soon as the gun could be placed in position, the shot was sent whizzing over the schooner. It dropped the line against the mizzen rigging. The whip and hawser speedily followed. When all was ready Surfman Hatch, with the keeper’s call for a volunteer, stepped forward and went off in the breeches-buoy to manage the gear on board. He had done likewise earlier on board the Sophia Minch.\n\nAs soon as he reached the schooner the landing of the people commenced. The captain’s wife was the first one hauled ashore. The rest followed one by one. Within 45 minutes from the firing of the shot, all hands were safe and quickly taken to places of shelter. The landing was effected none too soon, as the weather was freezing cold.\n\nOn 3 November, the gale having abated, the station crew lent valuable aid in pumping the Merrill out and in running lines to the three tugs employed to raise her. The task was successfully accomplished by 5 o’clock in the evening of the same day. The local press gave unmeasured praise to the life-saving crew and the little band of volunteers who acted so nobly at these two disasters. The captain of the John B. Merrill wrote the following complimentary letter:\n\nThe schooner John B. Merrill, in trying to make the harbor at Cleveland on the evening of 1 November, in charge of the tug James Amadeus, when near the end of the breakwater parted her tow-line and the vessel’s anchors were let go, but failed to hold. She drifted onto the beach, where she soon filled with water, the sea making a clean breach over her, making it extremely dangerous to launch a boat in the heavy sea that was running. The life-saving crew was promptly on hand, and in a very short time had succeeded in getting a line on board. Everything worked like clockwork, without a hitch, and in less than an hour all the crew of nine men and one woman were got on shore. It was blowing a gale, with a heavy sea running, and the night very dark. Too much praise cannot be given to Captain Goodwin and his crew for the efficient service they rendered in saving the lives of the crew, and also in getting the vessel off the beach on November 3.\n\nJ. H. COLEMAN\n\nMaster of Schooner, John B. Merrill\n\nOne of the most thrilling episodes of the Cleveland Life-Saving Station (Ninth District) occurred on 11 November 1884. About 9 o’clock at night, during a violent northwesterly gale, the station’s crew observed a vessel under reduced sail heading directly for the harbor. She failed to reach the sanctuary of the breakwater and was compelled to anchor off the end of the east pier. Keeper Goodwin predicted trouble and ordered the surfboat deployed.\n\nThe sea was running so high that the lighthouse was often completely buried in foam. As the boat passed out of the harbor, the captain of the tug Forest City hailed the keeper. He told him that if he would run a line from the vessel and stand by to slip her cable, the tug would try to tow her. The lifesavers got on board all right, but found the sea breaking over her. She was covered with a glare of ice. She proved to be the schooner-rigged barge John T. Johnson of Sandusky, OH inbound from Escanaba, MI with a cargo of iron ore consigned to parties in Cleveland. Her crew consisted of six men and one woman serving as the cook.\n\nThe keeper realized that steps needed to be quickly taken, as there was danger of the schooner parting her cable and driving ashore. He hailed Customs Inspector Bates and Lightkeeper Reed, who were on the pier, and requested them to send the tug out. The message was promptly delivered, but by the captain of the Forest City had changed his mind. Fearful of risking his vessel, he refused to go. The other tug lying in the river also declined. This was soon communicated to Goodwin. He realized that it would be madness to attempt to land the people with the boat. Especially as chances were that they would be capsized and drowned before reaching the harbor.\n\nAs the vessel could not hold on much longer, he decided to return ashore with his men and make ready the breeches buoy apparatus. He left one of the surfmen, John Eveleigh, on board to see that the gear was properly rigged. The boat had less than a hundred feet when it was nearly swamped and rendered almost unmanageable. To make matters worse the men were nearly exhausted by the pulling out to the vessel. Before they could bail out the water, the boat had drifted so far to the east of the pier that they could not get back into the river. They were compelled to square away for a short stretch of beach between the harbor pier and freight piers of the Lake Shore Railroad. This course, while expeditious, was also dangerous. If they missed the beach, they would be swept into certain destruction among the piers beyond.\n\nThey had barely got the boat under control again, when a tremendous sea overtook and capsized them. All hands were thrown into the ice cold water. Washed off again and again, they made desperate but fruitless efforts to right the boat. Several of them had also been badly bruised from contact with the boat. In the meantime an excited crowd had gathered upon the pier. They threw pieces of plank to the struggling surfmen. Though well-intended, this only added to their peril. With their cork life-belts providing sufficient buoyancy, the poor fellows now had to exert their energy to avoid being struck by one of the timbers.\n\nAt last after great exertion two or three of the men got to within forty or fifty feet of the pier. They caught the ropes thrown to them and were pulled out. The rest boat soon afterwards reached the beach. They were in a pitiable condition and for some time could not speak. It was one of the narrowest escapes in the history of the Life Saving Service. But for their life preservers, they every man would have been lost.\n\nThey were taken to the office of the customs inspector. Here their wet clothing was removed and replaced with dry garments and in a short time, they began to revive. The situation of the people on the schooner was foremost in their minds and the report that the vessel was drifting ashore acted like magic. They were instantly on the alert again, forgetting all else. The gallant fellows repaired to the station and with the assistance of others brought out the beach apparatus. It was now nearly midnight.\n\nThe schooner had moved almost into the same spot as the Sophia Minch a few days prior. Her crew could be dimly seen perched in the mizzen rigging. As quickly as possible the gun was placed in the most favorable position and fired. Surfman Eveleigh, who was in the rigging with the rest, caught the line. Although the storm raged with unabated fury, the work was now comparatively easy. Under Eveleigh’s directions the whip block was hauled out by the sailors and made fast. The whip and hawser soon followed and were secured to the mast. When taut, the breeches buoy went out and the rescue commenced. The woman was landed first. Then followed, one by one, the four seamen, the mate, the captain, and, lastly Surfman Eveleigh, who reached the shore at 25 minutes after 12, just thirty minutes from the time the gun was fired. The seamen were at once taken to shelter. Though badly damaged, the schooner was subsequently saved along with most of the cargo.\n\nDate of Award: January 10, 1889\n\nOn the morning of 20 November, the schooner Oliver Dyer went on the rocks near the Jerry's Point (NH) Station (First District). The following account of the disaster is from the report of the investigating officer, Lieutenant Charles F. Shoemaker of the Revenue Marine, assistant inspector, Third Life-Saving District:\n\n\"It appears that the schooner Oliver Dyer anchored at 1.30 A. M., of November 25th, just inside the entrance to Portsmouth Harbor and about one-half mile northeast of Jerry’s Point Station. The wind at that hour was northeast, weather cloudy. The vessel was of Saco, Maine, from Weehawken, New Jersey, bound for her home port, coal laden, and with a crew of five men; the wind being ahead, she put in here for a harbor, but, owing to the strong ebb tide and scanty breeze, was unable to reach the upper anchorage.\"\n\n\"The wind began to breeze on at sunrise of the 25th; and at sunset was blowing a howling gale from northeast, with a thick snow-storm, while a tremendous surf had grown upon the shore. Keeper Harding, fearing that the vessels at anchor in sight of his station (of which there were three, including the Dyer) might drag their anchors or part their chains if the gale. continued during the night, at sunset displayed from the staff at his station the international code signal M T (signifying, ‘Lookout will be kept on the beach all night’) to notify those on board the vessels that help would be at hand if required. Throughout the night a vigilant watch was maintained by the keeper and his crew. Before dark, as a precautionary measure, the keeper took a heaving-stick, with a long drift of line attached, to the patrol-box upon the shore and deposited it there to be dry and ready for use. At 5.45 A. M. of the 26th, Surfman Robinson, while on the north patrol, descried a vessel dragging her anchors, fired his Coston signal, and hurrying to the station gave the alarm at 6. Keeper Harding at once called all hands, and then, with Robinson, ran to the shore. Arriving there (about two hundred feet from the station), he discovered that the vessel reported had been brought up by her anchors, just clear of the breakers, about four hundred yards from the station, and two hundred yards off shore, where she was laboring heavily. The first thought, notwithstanding the huge surf, was to launch the boat, it being at hand upon the beach, but as the attempt was about to be made the keeper saw the schooner’s head fall off to the southward and the vessel driving before the gale, indicating that her chains had parted, and with this came the inevitable conclusion that she must strike upon the ragged ledges east of the station, about one hundred and fifty feet off shore, and, therefore, that the only hope of rescuing her people lay in the gun and line. Accordingly the beach-apparatus was hurried to the scene, and meantime the vessel had stranded upon the ledges. As the-gun was about to be charged, a tremendous sea caught the vessel upon her broadside and lifting her bodily threw her thirty or forty feet inshore. When the vessel struck upon the ledges the crew took to the fore and main rigging. As soon as the schooner brought up on the rocks the sea boarded her entire length, fore and aft, forging her shoreward and making clean breaches over her. The first sea washed a man from the main rigging forty feet above the deck. The keeper says: The truth is that when the first seas went over that vessel there was nothing of her in sight but her top masts and lower mast heads, and it is a miracle that every soul was not washed into the sea. ’It was thus seen that the gun and line could not be successfully operated, as the crew on board could not handle lines if thrown to them, so continually were the vessel’s decks swept, and besides the vessel was rapidly coming on and had now worked shoreward to within fifty or seventy-five feet of a huge flat rock, which, although almost constantly swept by heavy breakers, was the only spot from which there was the least hope of rendering aid. Harding took in the situation on the instant, dropped everything else and had recourse to the heaving-stick and line which he had judiciously placed the night before in the patrol-box near by. The rock indicated above, was reached by the life-saving crew between seas, and then a man who had jumped from the wreck was seen struggling in the water. One of the life-saving crew (Surfman Hall, it is believed) jumped to the rescue and was helping him out, when, just as the rest of the crew were getting hold of him, a huge breaker washed the rescuers and the rescued together off the rock. Fortunately they fell upon the inshore side, or all would have been swept out by the undertow and drowned; they, however, clung to the ragged edges of the rock, tearing the, flesh upon their arms until the blood ran, and when the sea receded, they regained their footing. While this was going on the vessel’s cook jumped overboard, and Surfman Randall seeing him in the water jumped to the rescue and caught him as he was being washed out by the undertow the second time, and landed him. Two men now remained on board the wreck. The heaving-stick, with the line attached, was thrown to them, and when they got hold of it, the other end of the line was fastened to the hauling part and, by keeping the bight on shore, the sailors were enabled to haul aboard a double line and provide themselves with a single part each. Keeper Harding then hailed and told them to each make the part he held last around his body, under the armpits, and jump overboard. This they did, and both were landed. Having thus rescued all in sight, the keeper sent Surfmen Randall and Amazeen to the rock to see if they could get sight of the man washed from the rigging. Nothing daunted by previous experience at this dangerous spot, the brave fellows had just succeeded in gaining a footing upon the rock, when a big sea took them off their feet. Amazeen caught hold of Randall, and, as the sea rolled back, they clung to the rock and were saved. Their escape was narrow indeed, and when recovered from their peril by the rest of the crew they were far gone with exhaustion.\"\n\nThus have I recounted the details of this disaster, and told of the service rendered by the Jerry’s Point life-saving crew. Within thirty minutes from the stranding the four survivors were safe at the station and eared for. That the fifth man of the Dyer’s crew was lost was owing to no fault of the life-saving crew, but solely due to a power that human endeavor could not stay, nor mortal man combat. It is not often that life saving crews are called upon to perform service under such circumstances as environed this case, but this crew was equal to the emergency, and under the able leadership of Keeper Harding performed prodigies of heroism seldom equaled. Every man in this crew came within an ace of losing his life, from the keeper down; so that while they were doing their utmost to save the crew of the wreck, they were in turn saving the lives of each other. Harding was washed from the rock and saved by Randall; A mazeen and Randall were washed from the ledge and dragged almost lifeless from the seething smother; all hands were tumbled from the rock by merciless breakers and rescued each other. Every time they went to that sea-combed rock upon, their errand of mercy it was a forlorn hope, but they led it and conquered.\n\nIt should be stated that the weather was piercing cold and the ground was covered with slush and ice. The man who was lost, Giuseppe Puez, was said to be an Austrian. He fell from the rigging into the sea outside of the schooner when she first struck, and was not seen afterwards. Although the station men diligently searched for the body for several days no trace of it could be found. The four survivors, after being taken to the station. They received shelter and care for two days. The vessel and cargo became a total loss. The surfmen, however, saved the personal effects of the sailors.\n\nOn the recommendation of Lieutenant Shoemaker, and after a full review of the testimony, the Secretary of the Treasury awarded a gold medal to Keeper Harding and each of his men, in recognition of their heroism.\n\nDate of Award: October 17, 1890\n\nOn 28 November (Thanksgiving Day) 1889 the crew of the Evanston (IL) Station, (11th District) Lake Michigan rendered memorable service in rescuing the crew of the steamer Calumet. Out of Buffalo, NY she wrecked off Fort Sheridan, IL during one of the region’s fiercest blizzards. The achievement reflected great credit upon the boat's crew who upheld the reputation of the US Life-Saving Service. The highest praise is also due to the garrison at Fort Sheridan and a party of civilians who aided in getting the surfboat down a steep bluff opposite the vessel. These brave men suffered great hardship in helping to launch the boat after it was lowered from the bluff. It may be justly said that without the aid thus afforded them, the station crew may have been unable to reach the wreck. The result was the rescue of every man from the steamer Calumet.\n\nThe ship was bound to Milwaukee WI with a cargo of coal. A few days previous, as she was passing through a shallow part of the Detroit River, she ran afoul of an anchor on the bottom and sprung a leak. The damage was so serious that Captain Green, her commander, deemed it prudent to repair as much as practicable and take a steam pump on board to keep the ship afloat. This would have been sufficient to save her had a gale not come on after she passed through the Strait of Mackinac. It was a terrible storm with blinding sleet and snow. The thermometer dropped to ten degrees. The high sea caused the leak to begin anew. It increased with such rapidity that it got out of control even with the pumps working at full capacity. Another element of danger was that they were unable to find the lights of Milwaukee Harbor.\n\nIn this dilemma the captain resolved to attempt to reach Chicago. Before long, however, the wrecking pump gave out. Captain Green decided to run her ashore to save the lives of his crew. The vessel had not run far before she grounded heavily on a shoal about a thousand yards from shore. She lay off Fort Sheridan, some ten to twelve miles north of the nearest life-saving station at Evanston, IL. This was about 10:30 o’clock on the night of the 27th. To save her from pounding herself to pieces, the captain ordered the valves in the ship’s bottom opened to permit her to fill completely. The eighteen on board found themselves in a terrible situation. An attempt to save themselves by the boat was out of the question and no help could reach them before dawn.\n\nMr. A W. Fletcher, a resident of Highland Park, was the first to discover her and he quickly sent a dispatch to Keeper Lawson around 12:30. The message simply said, \"There is a large vessel ashore off Fort Sheridan. Come !\" Lawson hurried to the railroad station and asked the night operator when the next train would go north. He replied, \"Not before 7:30 A. M.\" The operator then added that a freight train from Chicago would pass, without stopping, at about 2 o’clock. A request was immediately wired to the train dispatcher at Chicago to direct this train to stop at Evanston and take the station crew to Highland Park. As it, was too late to couple on suitable cars for the transportation of the apparatus, and as the train would reach Evanston in thirty-five minutes, there was little time for other arrangements to be made.\n\nLawson dashed off to the nearest livery stable and engaged teams to haul the boat and beach apparatus to the fort. He then went back to the station and mustered his crew. One man was directed to remain behind, with instructions to wait for the north patrol to come in and then to take the boat and other appliances by the county road. These preliminaries settled, he and the other four men hurried to the railroad station. Joined by the police officer who had delivered the dispatch, the party boarded the train. It was 4 o’clock before they reached Highland Park. They were met by Mr. Fletcher, who furnished a guide to conduct them the remaining two miles. The shore at that point was a bold, precipitous bluff some seventy or eighty feet high, with a ravine extending down to the water’s edge. The guide became confused in the darkness and storm and lost his way. This compelled the party to traverse several ravines before they finally reached the place from which they could operate at 5 o’clock.\n\nA fire was built by the surfmen to serve as a beacon to the people on the vessel and to warm themselves by while waiting for daylight and the arrival of the life-saving appliances. The boat and gear arrived at 7 o’clock. It was then light enough to see that the people on board the ship could not hold out much longer. The keeper decided to attempt to reach her by line rather than risk the lives of the men and the destruction of the boat. Two shots were fired, but each fell a long distance inshore of the vessel. This showed that she was much farther out than had been estimated and, therefore, beyond working range of the lines. Boat service was therefore the only alternative.\n\nDiscarding the gun, the men made immediate preparations for a launch. The place selected for sliding the boat down to the water was the ravine in which the fire had been built. Axes were soon at work cutting a way through the brush wide enough for the boat. Once this was done, the boat was started down the ravine. Soldiers from Fort Sheridan and others eased it to within a few feet of the water. The gully was about three hundred yards to the south of the point directly abreast of the wreck. It was, therefore, necessary to drag it along the narrow shelf of beach at the foot of the bluff.\n\nWith the heavy surf rolling in, it was only by watching for their chances between the breakers that any progress could be made. Even then the gallant fellows were half the time waist-deep and over in the cold icy water, the boat completely filled three times and emptied out the same number. There was also a danger of the men on the inner gunwale being crushed or maimed when the sea struck the craft on its broadside and hurled it against the bank. In spite of this danger and difficulties, the boat was finally gotten to a point a little to the windward of the steamer. As soon as its bow could be pointed lakeward, the crew sprang to their places at the oars. When the next sea lifted the craft, the soldiers pushed it out and the oars were put in motion. The rescuing party was off on their perilous errand.\n\nIn crossing the inner bar they met an immense breaker which nearly threw the boat end over end. The shock of its impact was so great, Keeper Lawson was almost thrown overboard from his post at the steering-oar. Before he could recover, a second wave dashed over the boat and filled it to the thwarts. This made the boat almost unmanageable, but with strong and steady pulling of five of the oars they managed to keep going and soon were beyond the heaviest line of surf.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the current had put them far to the leeward. This gave them a long, hard pull directly in the teeth of the gale. The oars were constantly slipping from the rowlocks as both became encased with ice. In the annals of life-saving effort there can be found few instances so frought with such hardship and peril as it was the lot of these brave men to encounter. Yet not a man quailed. It should be noted that the members of this crew were not regular surfmen. Instead, they, with the exception of the keeper, were students of Northwestern Academy (later Northwestern University). Yet nobly, they stuck to their work.\n\nRecovering the ground lost in passing through the breakers was a rough and arduous task. An eyewitness from the bluff declared that at times he thought they would never succeed. The steamer’s crew was clustered about the pilothouse. The vessel was literally encased in ice and the men were stiff after so many hours of exposure. At last, after one of the most perilous trips ever undertaken by a lifesaving crew, they got near enough to the bow of the steamer for Captain Green to throw them a line. Every watcher on the shore, as well as those on board, breathed easier when the boat got alongside. Six of the castaways were, with some difficulty, taken into the boat. After putting a life preserver on each man, a start was made for the shore. Owing to the strong current, the landing was made fully a quarter of a mile south of the point of starting. As soon as the sailors were helped out, they were conducted to the fire on the bluff where the ice was beaten, from their frozen garments and they were supplied with hot coffee.\n\nWhile this was being done, the boat was emptied and dragged to a point where it could be launched for another trip. Much refreshed by the coffee provided them by the soldiers, the surfmen, after a brief rest, again made their way down to the boat. Another launch was made in the same manner as the first. With the knowledge gained by their previous experience, the boat was from the start headed more to the current and they were not swept so far to the leeward. Consequently, the wreck was more quickly reached and the trip was made in much less time. Three trips in all were made, six men being landed each trip. Thus the entire crew of eighteen men were saved and without any of them being seriously frostbitten. By the time this work was accomplished, the station men were almost in as bad a plight as the men they had saved.\n\nThe assisting party took charge of the boat and after hauling it back onto the bluff saw it safely on its carriage in charge of the teamster en route to the station. While this was being done, the surfmen again refreshed themselves with coffee. They then took the first train for Evanston, where they arrived early in the afternoon. A few hours after the rescue of her crew, the steamer broke up completely and on the following morning nothing was left of her but the stem and sternpost. It was the opinion of all who were present that, but for the heroic conduct of this student crew, every man belonging to the Calumet must have perished. In recognition of their noble devotion to duty, each man was presented with the Gold Lifesaving Medal, the highest token of its appreciation that the Department can bestow. Thanksgiving Day 1889 (28 November) will doubtless ever be remembered by the crew of Calumet, as truly a day for thanksgiving. For on this day the student surfmen of Northwestern and their fearless keeper kept them from a watery grave.\n\nDate of Award: March 21, 1892\n\nDespite one fatality, one of the most notable rescues of 1892 was that conducted by the crew of the Hog Island (VA) Station (Fifth District) in landing twenty-six persons from the Spanish steamship San Albano on 24 February 1892. Out of Bilboa, Spain she had gone ashore on the outer shoals of Hog Island on the evening of the 22nd and subsequently, became a total wreck. Around 4:30 AM on 23 February, the morning beach patrol discovered a steamer’s light too near the shore and he lit his Coston signal. When the light disappeared shortly afterwards, the surfman concluded that the warning had been effective. He later reported what happened to the keeper at sunrise. The keeper then ascended to the lookout and swept the horizon with the glass. To the north he discerned the masts and smokestack of a vessel which appeared to be close to the land.\n\nThe weather was misty and a northeast gale prevailed. This carried the tide over the marshes of the island. The surf, beat heavily upon the shore and swift currents swept along the beach to the southward. The life-saving crew set out at once with the beach apparatus and worked their way up the coast to the ship about five miles distant. After two hours of exertion, they arrived abreast the ship at 9:00. It appeared that the vessel of twelve hundred and ninety-one tons register, bound from New Orleans to Hamburg, Germany. She was to obtain coal in Norfolk. In the thick weather the ship passed the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. In retracing the distance along the coast, the master steered too far to the westward and grounded on the outer shoals of Hog Island. He later worked over the bar and floated in one of the numerous channels. Here the master came to an anchor, but the increasing force of adverse elements proved irresistible and the vessel drifted before the wind. Striking upon the shoals at intervals, she filled with water and finally grounded five hundred yards from the beach.\n\nWhen the lifesavers arrived, the ship lay broadside and the waves broke over her decks. The ship’s company could be seen gathered around the houses on deck and while the Spanish flag floated from halfway up the main rigging. It appeared impossible to reach the wreck with the gun. The forty-mile gale ensured that the life-car would be needed should communication be established with the beach apparatus. It was also deemed advisable to bring the surfboat to the scene. This necessitated a return to the station for this equipment. The round trip required ten miles’ travel over the flooded country. The station horse was taken back to bring up the surfboat and a team of horses was kindly loaned by Mr. J. L. Ferrell to haul the life-car, a spare shot-line, and shot. The lifesaving crew could not re-assemble opposite the wreck until 2:00 PM.\n\nThe gun was placed and a failed shot was fired. The second shot, with a No. 4 line, passed over the ship and the line fell on deck. In their eagerness to haul it aboard, however, the steamer’s crew carelessly permitted it to chafe against the main rigging where the action of the sea caused it to part. The rising tide drove the lifesavers farther back upon the beach, increasing the distance to the wreck. The gale raged with greater fury and caused the five succeeding shots to fall short. Without any additional lines, the keeper decided to resort to the surfboat. He did this, despite the assertions of experienced men that no boat could survive in such surf.\n\nThe boat was dragged well up to the window and launched, but the wind, the sea, and the current, were too powerful for the crew. They were carried below the wreck, where they reached the shore with difficulty. They made a second launch from a point much farther to the north, but the heroic struggle to reach the wreck proved futile. Although they approached somewhat nearer the stranded steamer, it was impossible to reach her. The boat was again swept beyond the vessel and nearly overturned. After a desperate struggle, a safe landing was effected about a mile below the wreck.\n\nThough both attempts with the boat had jeopardized the lives of the entire, it had also demonstrated their dauntless courage.\n\nMeanwhile some of the ship’s company, in defiance of the captain, lowered the steamer’s only remaining boat, and seven of them made a successful trip to the shore. This was a circumstance so exceptional under such conditions, that it may be noted to be little less than miraculous. Shortly thereafter, it sunset arrived and it grew dark. The lifesaving crew was prevented from further operations by the night. With his crew exhausted by their efforts and going without food all day, the keeper decided to return to the station for needed food and a brief rest. He made this decision after he learned, from the men who came ashore, that the ship was yet solid and dry in her deckhouses.\n\nA company composed of the Rev. J.R. Sturgis, his son, and Mr. Albert Barrett, with others whose names were unfortunately unknown, volunteered to maintain a watch, keep a fire on the beach, and to notify Keeper Johnson should anything serious occur. The crew reached the station at 9 o’clock, and after a few hours’ rest set out again for the wreck at 4 in the morning. They took the last dry shot line with them.\n\nThe wind was due northeast and the surf had not diminished. The ship, however, did not appear to have worked any nearer the shore, and although it was low water, the keeper saw that she was still probably beyond the range of the gun. As such, the crew was forced to resort to an ingenious expedient that proved to be the turning point for a successful operation. The gun was lashed upon the apparatus cart while the shot-line box was secured on the forward axle of the boat carriage. The men waded waist deep into the surf and the cart was pushed into the water as far as possible. Heavily loaded for this final trial, the gun was discharged at the right moment. After a moment of breathless suspense, the shot landed just over the rail, falling on the ship's deck. Remebering the accident of the previous day, the crew of the steamer kept the line clear and hauled it off with care. Aided by the islanders on the beach, the connection with the wreck was finally made and the life car was sent aboard.\n\nEight trips sufficed to bring the nineteen officers and crew ashore. They landed almost destitute of clothing, but with grateful expressions for their safe deliverance. It was at this juncture that the keeper learned that one man, the chief engineer, had been lost. He had attempted, against the remonstrances of his shipmates, to reach the shore by swimming with the aid of a plank. This rash act cost him his life. Rev. J. R. Sturgis had heard an outcry at about 2 o’clock in the morning but no one was seen. The entire crew of twenty-six persons were properly cared for at the station and their destitution was relieved by supplying them with clothing from the articles furnished by the Women’s National Relief Association. The district inspector, who investigated all the circumstances connected with this remarkable case closed his report in the following words\n\nGreat credit is due the keeper and crew of the Hog Island Station for their brave and persistent efforts, and every man did his whole duty. The people of the island were prompt and ready to assist the life-saving crew in every way possible, and especial praise should be given the Rev. J.R. Sturgis for his hearty cooperation and valuable services. This is the first time in the history of this station that the beach apparatus has been used, and demonstrates the great value of the life car as a means of lauding men when the distance is great and the surf heavy.\n\nIt should be noted that the superintendent of the district, Captain B.S. Rich, a man of great experience and with an enviable record as a lifesaver, was on site early and rendered valuable aid by his sound judgment and excellent advice. The crew remained at the station seven days, when they were transferred to the mainland. Before their departure the captain addressed a letter to the district superintendent:\n\nHOG ISLAND STATION\n\nFebruary 25, 1892.\n\nSir:\n\nI am much obliged to Keeper J.E. Johnson and his crew for the promptness with which they came to the aid of the steamer San Albano and for saving twenty-six men and the cat. One sailor was drowned. He jumped overboard in spite of the warning of all hands. I would, therefore, express great praise to Keeper Johnson and his crew for saving our lives under the most trying circumstances, since there was a heavy surf breaking on the beach, accompanied by a high wind and strong current. The superintendent also proved himself very efficient in giving directions on shore and in pushing forward the task of rescue. I do not know how to express our gratitude for the good which resulted.\n\nDate of Award: March 28, 1902\n\nOne of the most distressing calamities in the history of the Life-Saving Service occurred on 17 March 1902 near the eastern end of Shovelful Shoal on the Massachusetts coast. It resulted in the drowning of 12 persons, 5 from the stranded coal barge Wadena and 7 from the crew of the Monomoy Life-Saving Station. The circumstances of this lamentable ship wreck and sacrifice of the life-saving men appears to have been as follows:\n\nDuring a northeast gale on the night of 11 March, the barges Wadena and John C. Fitzpatrick, bound from Newport News, VA to Boston, MA in tow of the tug, Sweepstakes, struck on Shovelful Shoal, off the southern end of Monomoy Island, Cape Cod while seeking an anchorage. They remained there for several days. A few hours after stranding, the crew of the Monomoy Life-Saving Station boarded the barges and tried to float them. Finding the undertaking impracticable, due to the weather, they took both crews of five men each to the life-saving station, where they arrived at 3 PM.\n\nThe Sweepstakes remained by the barges for a couple of days, but she was compelled to make a port for repairs. Wreckers were engaged to lighter the cargoes and float the barges. As conditions permitted, the wreckers continued their labors off and on until the night of March 16. At this time the weather became so threatening that the tug Peter Smith, which had replaced the Sweepstakes, took all the men off the Wadena, except five, and put into the harbor of Hyannis. Those who remained on the barge were the owner, W. S. Mack, of Cleveland, OH, Captain C.D. Olsen of Boston, and three Portuguese wreckers, Manoel Ignacio, Vasco Izevedo, and another whose name could not be ascertained.\n\nAbout 8:00 on the 17th, the south patrol of the Monomoy Life-Saving Station reported the barges as being in no immediate danger as far as he could make out. In a few minutes, however, Keeper Eldridge received a telephone inquiry from the captain of the tug Peter Smith, then at Hyannis, asking whether everything was all right with the men on board the Wadena. This was the first time the keeper had any idea that anybody had remained on the barge over night. The suggestive message caused him so much uneasiness that he started for the end of the Point, about 3 miles to the southwest, in order to determine the situation for himself. Rain was falling and the weather was thick. Meanwhile, a fresh southeast wind was blowing and across the direction of it, the ebbing tide was setting strongly, making a very ugly sea.\n\nThe Wadena lay about half a mile south of the point. Although Keeper Eldridge saw no signs of especial danger, a signal of distress was flying on board and he could not disregard it. He, therefore, telephoned from the south watchhouse to No. 1 Surfman Seth L. Ellis. He informed him of the facts and directed him to launch the surfboat and come down in it with the crew by the inside route. Promptly obeying, the men put on their storm clothes and after a hard pull reached a point on the beach some 2.5 miles from the station. Here they took in the keeper, who had walked up to meet them.\n\nThe keeper now assumed control and advising the crew of his intent. He took his course around the point straight for the Wadena. In many places on the shoals, the sea was very heavy, a peculiarly difficult and treacherous sea in which to handle a boat, and perhaps a barrel of water was shipped. It was nearly noon when the boat rounded-to under the lee of the barge, just abaft the forerigging. With her head pointed toward the stern, this was the only place where the waves permitted going alongside with any safety. A line was instantly thrown to the surfmen from the barge. Afterwards, the boat’s painter was also passed on board and used to make fast.\n\nHaving ascertained the number of persons on board, the keeper directed them to get into the boat. The main rail of the vessel was 12 or 13 feet above the water, and the men lowered themselves one by one over the side by means of a rope. Most unfortunately, Captain Olsen, a heavy man, lost his grasp on the way down and dropped with such force on the second thwart that he broke it. This put the rowers on that seat to great disadvantage.\n\nIn order to get quickly away from his dangerous proximity to the barge, Keeper Eldridge commanded Surfman Chase to cut the painter. The boat then shoved off. There was little safety room to maneuver and a swift attempt was made to clear the line of breakers. While the surfmen holding the port oars were backing hard and those on the starboard side were pulling, a sea struck the boat and poured a great deal of water into it. The men from the barge instantly flew into a panic that could not be quelled. They stood up, clung to the surfmen, crowded them out of their places on the thwarts, obstructed the use of the oars, and made any effective work impossible. The keeper and his crew were cool and resolute. They strained every muscle to turn the boat.\n\nDoing their utmost to restore reason and order, a heavier wave rose up, fell broadside upon them, and the boat went over. Everyone who could clung to it as it drifted fast into the heaviest of the breakers. Twice the lifesavers righted it, but each time the seas upset it again. There was no longer any opportunity for concerted action. The water was bitter cold and the foam of the breakers nearly suffocating. Only the strongest could survive. As the boat tumbled and rolled about, the waves completely submerged it every few moments. One by one the men lost their hold and disappeared. With seven of them all was soon over.\n\nKeeper Eldridge and Surfmen Ellis, Kendrick, Foye, and Rogers still held on. Kendrick had sufficient strength to climb to the bottom of the boat, but the next sea swept him away and Foye soon followed. The keeper was fast losing his vitality and now asked Ellis, who had succeeded in getting back onto the boat, to help him. Soon a strong wave washed off both of them and Eldridge, after regaining and losing his grasp several times, gave out and was seen no more. Only Rogers and Ellis remained. The former despairingly threw his arms around the latter’s neck. Unless Ellis could release himself, both would drown together. It was a terrible emergency. With the strength of desperation, Ellis broke away and hauled himself once more onto the boat while Rogers was still able to clutch the submerged rail. Ellis could scarcely breathe and was so worn out that all he could do was to keep his place and extend to his comrade a few feeble words of encouragement. Rogers was soon exhausted and after faintly moaning, \"I have got to go,\" he fell away out of sight.\n\nThe awful tragedy was almost complete and poor Ellis nearly hopeless, but the boat eventually drifted into less turbulent water. The centerboard slipped part way out of the trunk so that he could clutch it and hold his place far more securely. Nevertheless, he might soon have perished had not assistance soon reached him.\n\nThe barge Fitzpatrick, which had stranded at the same time as the Wadena, was still intact on the shoal. On board were Captain Andrew Welsh, master, Captain Benjamin Mallows, marine underwriter, and Captain Elmer F. Mayo of Chatham, in charge of wrecking operations. The Fitzpatrick lay some considerable distance from the Wadena and it would seem that those on board did not see the life-saving boat when it went out. They were busy battening down hatches and had just started their steam pump when Captain Mayo glanced over the port rail and saw a capsized boat with four men clinging to it. At first he thought it was one of his own wrecking boats. He remembered, however, that he had observed a signal of distress flying on the Wadena. He then realized that the capsized boat belonged to the life-saving station. It was drifting toward the Fitzpatrick and Mayo quickly threw a large wooden fender overboard, thinking that it might find its way to the shipwrecked men. It did not do so and in the meantime three of them had dropped off the boat.\n\nMayo now astonished his shipmates by declaring that he would go to the rescue with the barge’s dory, a vessel totally unfit for so perilous an enterprise. It lay on deck without thole pins or oars. Two pieces of pine, a serving stick, and an old rasp were quickly driven in for thole pins. Two old sawed-off oars were got together. In such crippled condition as this the little dory was thrust over the rail and fortunately took the water right side up. Mayo threw off his boots and oil jacket, strapped a life preserver about him and leapt into the dory, oars in hand. He then shoved away. Watching his chance with consummate skill and judgment, he swept across the heaviest line of breakers and then located his man and pulled ahead with all his might. Ellis stated that he waved his hand toward the barge after Rogers drowned and saw a dory thrown over the side, but after that, he saw nothing \"until all at once the dory hove in sight\" near him. Captain Mayo ran close alongside the capsized boat, and as he did so Ellis reached out and dragged himself into the dory.\n\nMayo’s work was so far well and bravely done, but the most dangerous part of it was still to be accomplished. He could not pull back to the barge, nor to the shore on the inside of the point. Instead, he had to make his landing on the outside where the surf was most dangerous. He knew that the attempt would jeopardize his own life and he carefully picked out his way. He held back a few moments until a person whom he saw coming down the beach could reach the edge of the water and render aid in case of need. This man proved to be Francisco Bloomer, a skillful surfman. As soon as he was abreast of the boat, Mayo drove it forward with great power while Bloomer ran into the surf and assisted both men safely to land.\n\nWhen Captain Mayo left the Fitzpatrick on this self-imposed perilous mission of humanity he was warned that he would never live to accomplish it. When it was done, however, news of it spread quickly and it was proclaimed a most noble and brilliant achievement. In recognition of his extraordinary merits, the Secretary of the Treasury bestowed upon him the Gold Lifesaving Medal, awarded only to those who display the most extreme and heroic daring in saving life from the perils of the sea. Surfman Ellis, for his devotion to duty, his faultless courage, and his self-sacrificing fidelity to his comrades, was likewise honored. He was also promoted to keeper of his station.\n\nThe loss of the 7 life-saving men who perished created a sense of profound sorrow. There was no more skillful or fearless crew on the whole coast. As the Wadena remained safe for days after the disaster, there was a general conviction that the men were a tragic and unnecessary sacrifice. On the one hand, they responded to the needless apprehensions and senseless panic of the men from the barge. On the other hand they fell victim to their own high sense of duty which would not permit them to turn their backs upon a signal of distress. Perhaps the keeper’s order best sums up their ironic legacy. He said, \"We must go, there is a distress flag in the rigging.\"\n\nDate of Award: April 16, 1913\n\nOn the morning of 30 December 1912, the seagoing tug Margaret, enroute from New York to Norfolk with three heavily-laden barges, struck an obstruction off the coast of New Jersey. She was so severely injured that she had to cast off her tow and run for the shore. She grounded in the breakers some 300 yards off the beach and was promptly discovered by the lookout of the Avalon Life-Saving Station.\n\nAs a rescue party from the station would have had to put to sea in the teeth of the gale, news of the disaster was telephoned to the Tathams Life-Saving Station, several miles to the south. From that location a boat going to the assistance of the tug would have the wind dead astern. After sending the message, the keeper of the Avalon Station set out on foot with his crew to assist the life-savers at Tathams.\n\nThe Tathams crew, under the command of Keeper Harry McGinley, hauled their power surfboat down to the beach upon receiving the information of the stranding. The waters inshore, however, had become a cauldron of raging seas. To launch off an unprotected beach at such a time the boat had to be held squarely head to the seas. With even a slight swerve to either side, a breaking wave could swing the craft around broadside and roll her back onto the beach, possibly with the loss of some of her crew.\n\nAs the boat g"
