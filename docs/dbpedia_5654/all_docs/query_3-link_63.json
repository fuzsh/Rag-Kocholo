        "text": "Allison T\n\nVerified\n\nBardstown tour I thoroughly enjoy planning trips myself so I was thankful to find a company that had shuttle service only and I could book all the tours/tastings. We lucked out with Shelby (the new owner) as our driver and a very nice new black van. As I was a shuttle only service, I tried not to ask too many questions, but when I did she was very quick and helpful. For reference, 9 of us did basic tasting/tours of the following: 9am Bardstown Bourbon 10:30am Willet (OUR FAV) 1pm Four Roses Distillery (not bottling) We all agreed Four Roses was our least fav and furthest out. After just seeing Makers Mark grounds, we should have gone there instead. Happy bourboning!\n\nCybill V\n\nVerified\n\nTop Shelf Service I had the pleasure to be escorted for three days from our rental home to the Kentucky Bourbon Festival. We were greeted by the most amazing and personable gentleman who introduced himself as \"Ron\". Ron made our experience truly memorable. He was engaging, thoughtful and by the time we made it to the first day of the KBF -he was family. This is an outstanding company who delivered high quality service while making you feel like you were in the company of a lifelong friend. I book events and travel for a living (over 30 years) and I knew within our first hour together that I would not return to Louisville/Bourbon Country without ensuring that Ron and BourbonTown Tours were part of that experience. The quality of the service, cleanliness of the vehicle and personal touches truly elevated our time in Louisville. If you are looking for a company to host your next bourbon trip make sure you give them a call. You won't be disappointed.\n\nEdwin M\n\nVerified\n\nFantastic Bourbon Festival Experience I took my father down to the Kentucky Bourbon Festival in Bardstown, along with some other family members, as a Father's Day trip. You don't expect that a three day Bourbon festival, coupled with distillery tours can be made any better. Ron quickly blew that expectation out of the water. The time we spent with him between Louisville and Bardstown each day was easily the highlight of our trip. There is now not another transportation company in Kentucky I'd dream of using.\n\nGwenn\n\nVerified\n\nBourbonTown Tour - Sept 2023 Keith was amazing. He picked us up right at our Air BnB in Bardstown, and had a cooler, snacks, ice and water ready for us. He picked us up in a very nice SUV that was room enough for us to bring our own cooler of drinks and food as well, and for all the stuff we bought (4 of us). We had 3 tours setup for us and he got us to all early and did the leg work of talking to the front desk. He would also take our purchases to the car for us, so we could shop more or eat. We had enough time that he even got us to a forth distillery to shop the gift shop and have a quick drink. He was full of knowledge on the history of the area, the distilleries and the flora and fauna as well. He was super laid back and very sweet, and even offered to take photos or our group so we could all be in the pics. I would book again with this company and request Keith, on our next visit.\n\nCarolyn D\n\nVerified\n\nGreat Custom tour! Had a great experience hiring Bourbontown Tours for a custom tour for my friend and I. Our driver, Beverly, was friendly and knowledgeable and made sure we had everything we needed for a fun day - including snacks and water in the car. I appreciated that Bourbontown handled all the logistics, including tour reservations, all we had to do was relax and enjoy the tastings! Booking the tour was a seamless process - the team offered helpful advice about which distilleries to pair and where to eat. Iâ€™ll definitely be calling them again for our next Bourbon tour.\n\njchille\n\nVerified\n\nBourbon day trip with friends We had an amazing day on the bourbon trail with our tour guide, Dan. He was prompt to pick us up, even bringing Apple fritters from a local bakery for our ride from downtown Louisville to Bardstown. The vehicle was immaculate, complete with a cooler of waters. We toured three distilleries: Preservation, Jim Beam and Log Still. Dan was there to take pictures, give us some local history, and to guide us to our tour destinations on time. We had a beautiful, comfortable, fun day! It was definitely nice not to worry about one of us driving. We will definitely be back again!\n\nErik J\n\nVerified\n\nBurBIN Bhais The trip was well worth the money and our guide was very engaging adding to the experience. We hit a lot of stops and she kept us laughing and having a great time\n\nmisslulumesa\n\nVerified\n\nWonderful Experience-amazing guide We had a wonderful time with a driver (Kirk) who was the greatest! He went above and beyond to make our day great! He even made an extra stop for us at Jim Bean! He knew so much and made sure everything was perfect! We felt like we were out for the day with a friend! The tour was set up perfect! We could not of asked for more!\n\nEllenseafl\n\nVerified\n\nBourbonTown Tours Great Time We had an exceptional two-day excursion to Frankfort and Bardstown distilleries with Kirk as the driver and shepherd of our 9 person party. They booked the distillery tours, tastings and Sunday brunch. They accommodated our own booking today and even stopped at the grocery store for us. Highly recommend!\n\nCuriosity46987804761\n\nVerified\n\nBirthday Bourbon Tour The Tour company was extremely professional our driver Tommy was amazing. We celebrated 2 birthdays and our tour was the highlight of our weekend. I would use them again and again."
