        "text": "CAMPAIGN IN VIRGINIA, 1864.\n\nTwenty Thousand Strong marched the Negro troops into the campaign of Virginia. On their way they passed through Washington. Mr. Lincoln, with Gen. Burnside and friends, reviewed the long line from the balcony of Willard's Hotel. As the long, heavy columns filed past, the President acknowledged their almost continuous \"Hurrah for Lincoln!\" He was deeply touched by the spectacle; there were tears in many eyes that saw the\n\nPage 118\n\nbrave thousands of sable sons, but a little while ago slaves, now gallantly marching to defend the Union. It was a scene never forgotten by those who saw it.\n\nWith Equal Pay, a recognition as soldiers by Mr. Davis, and a brilliant record, marched the Negro troops into the Virginia campaign. Gen. Butler, who was now convinced by the scenes at Port Hudson, Forts Pillow and Wagner of the Negro's capacity for fighting, was stationed at Bermuda Hundreds with a large corps of Negro troops.\n\nGrant Threw His Forces across the Rapidan and met the Confederates in The Wilderness. He left Gen. Ferrero with his colored troops to protect his wagon train in the rear. Ewell with the Confederate cavalry, whipped around in search of these supplies. Gen. Ferrero with his Negro troops met Ewell. The Confederates made a bold charge and captured twenty-seven wagons. The hungry soldiers prepared to feast on their plunder.\n\nGen. Ferrero opened fire. The Confederates charged again, giving the colored troops their very best, but the Negro regiments did not budge. Gen. Ferrero then ordered his troops to charge, and, in this the first fight between Negro troops and Virginians, the Confederates were driven \"as the gale drives chaff.\" \"It was the first time at the East,\" says Gen. Badeau in his Military History of Grant,\n\nPage 119\n\n\"when the colored troops had been engaged in any important battle, and the display of soldierly qualities won a frank acknowledgment from both troops and commanders, not all of whom had before been willing to look upon Negroes as comrades. But after that time, white soldiers in the Army of the Potomac were not displeased to receive the support of the black ones; they had found the support worth having.\"\n\nPage 120\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nAROUND PETERSBURG.\n\nHere it was that Negro soldiers covered themselves with merited glory in the presence of white troops on both sides; surprising in their daring to officers trained at West Point, and that, too, on the very soil where slavery first made its appearance in this country.\n\nThe City of Petersburg lies on the Appomattox river near the James, and not far from Richmond, with which it has railroad connection, and formed the base of supplies up the James for the troops in defence of Richmond. It therefore became an important point to reduce. It was strongly fortified on all sides for miles out.\n\nThe Task of Taking the \"Cockade City,\" as it was called, fell to Gen. Smith, assisted by General Kautz, coming up on the East; Brooks, following Kautz; Martindale, who was to move up the Appomattox, and Hinks, who moved between the two. The black brigade was under Gen Hinks, who discovered a Confederate battery on a knoll six miles out from the city. Under range of the Confederate\n\nPage 121\n\nguns he formed his line for a charge. The battery must be taken at the point of the bayonet. \"Forward!\" rang out along the line, and as the troops cleared the woods the enemy opened a raking fire with canister, siege gun and musket. But away swept the black brigade, their ranks shattered with deadly shells. As they closer came, a fusilade of musketry came down upon them; a hundred men fell; but leaping and dashing, with a wild cheer they burst over the bulwarks, drove the enemy from their guns, and instantly turned them on their scattered ranks beating a hasty retreat towards Petersburg -- and the colored troops had won the day.\n\nBrooks and Martindale were now in front of the Confederates' main line near the river. Hinks, with his Negro corps of 3,000, was ordered towards \"Dunn's House,\" three miles from the city on the road leading east.\n\nTo Reach His Position it was necessary to cross an open space in full reach of the sharp-shooters and artillery of the enemy. They crossed this space by moving forward a few paces and then lying down; at every quiet moment they would steal forward; they thus reached their position under the most trying test. But on reaching their post, so thick and deadly was the firing from all sides that\n\nPage 122\n\nthey dared not rise; so thus they lay from one till five o'clock P.M. while torrents of lead whizzed over their heads.\n\n\"Dunn's House\" was defended by three forts, one in front, one north and another south. Deep ravines lay in front, while an almost impassable abatis of trees impeded the way to the forts. Seven hundred yards in front lay Hink's black troops hungry for the fray. Thus they lay in deep suspense, anxious for orders to go forward. Meanwhile, shells plowed the earth around them for four long hours, which seemed to them like days.\n\nAt Five O'clock the command \"Forward!\" was greeted with a rush and a shout. The brave Negro troops went forward at a double-quick; the skirmishers were the first to reach the embankments, and were greeted with a shower of bullets which tumbled many headlong and lifeless into the pits. But on came the main body as if impelled by lightning; they swept into the midst of the enemy, grabbed their guns and fired them upon them as they \"ran for their lives.\" Three hundred Confederates were taken prisoners, and several pieces of artillery were captured.\n\nSmith Had Petersburg now at his mercy. Brooks and Martindale had swept the enemy in front of them simultaneously with Hinks, and the way was\n\nPage 123\n\nopen to march immediately into the city. Gen. Smith, however, decided to wait for the arrival of Gen. Birney with the Second Corps -- and this delay caused the loss of many thousand lives.\n\nNext Morning, as the sun peeped up over the yellow waters of the Appomattox, the condition of things had changed. The flower of Lee's army had come up in the night-time, and Grant was compelled afterwards to lay siege to the city, under which it finally surrendered.\n\nSecretary Stanton was wild with delight over the valor of the colored troops at Petersburg. Said he: \"The hardest fighting was done by the black troops. The forts they stormed were the worst of all. After the affair was over, Gen. Smith went to thank them, and tell them he was proud of their courage and dash. He says they cannot be excelled as soldiers, and that hereafter he will send them in a difficult place as readily as the white troops.\"\n\nPage 124\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nTHE CRATER.\n\nPetersburg was now surrounded by the Union army. There was continual skirmishing. Burnside commanded the Ninth Corps, composed partly of Negro troops. By fierce fighting he made his way up to within a hundred and fifty yards of the Confederate batteries. Projecting out in front of them was a strong fort. After consultation a trench was dug out some hundred and fifty yards long, branching off in two directions at the end under the fort. It was packed with powder and explosives, the design being to blow the place up. As arranged, on the 30th of July, 1864, the match was applied. Dampness prevented an explosion. Lieut. Jacob Douty and Sergeant Henry Rus volunteered to go into the trenches and ascertain and remove the difficulty and very soon after they came out, at 4:45 A. M., the match was again applied, and -- read the result, by Gen. Badeau: \"The mine exploded with a shock like that of an earthquake, tearing up the Confederates' works above them, and vomiting men, guns and caissons, two hundred feet into the air. The tremendous\n\nPage 125\n\nmass appeared for a moment to hang suspended in the heavens like a huge indented cone, the exploding powder still flashing out here and there, while limbs and bodies of mutilated men, and fragments of cannon and wood-work, could be seen. Then all fell heavily to the ground again, with a second report like thunder. When the smoke and dust had cleared away, only all enormous crater, thirty feet deep, sixty feet wide, and a hundred and fifty feet long stretched out in front of the Ninth Corps, where the Confederate fort had been.\"\n\nAt the moment of the explosion the Union batteries belched forth from one hundred and ten deadly cannon and fifty mortars, and verily the earth seemed to tremble from the shock.\n\nThe Plan was to follow the discharge of the batteries with a charge. Gen. Burnside had arranged his Negro troops for the post of honor. A dispute arose between him and Gen. Meade as to the wisdom of this plan. The whole matter was referred to Gen. Grant, who ordered lots to be drawn by the different Generals as to \"who should go into the crater.\" The lot fell on Gen. Ledlie. Gen. Ledlie accordingly endeavored to draw up his troops into the mouth of the crater. The Tenth New Hampshire faltered and broke ranks. Generals Potter and\n\nPage 126\n\nWilcox marched their troops into the dreadful hole, where they halted long enough for the Confederates to make an attack.\n\nGen. Potter Struggled out with his division and charged the enemy, but had to retire. Gen. Burnside now ordered his colored troops around the edges of the crater; the Confederates were now gathering around from all sides, and under a heavy fire drove the colored troops into the deadly hole, from which they continued to rally until nightfall.\n\nA Ridiculous Mistake was made by the Federals in not marching into the city immediately after the explosion, when the Confederates were nonplused and breaking away in mad confusion. Gen. Grant says of this disgraceful affair: \"The four divisions of his (Burnside's) corps were commanded by Generals Potter, Wilcox, Ledlie and Ferrero. The last was a colored division; and Burnside selected it to make the assault. Meade interfered with this. Burnside then took Ledlie's division.\"\n\nBefore the committee that investigated the affair Gen. Grant said: \"Gen. Burnside wanted to put his colored division in front; I believe if he had done so it would have been a success.\"\n\nFour Thousand Four Hundred Union soldiers perished through the mistake then of not allowing\n\nPage 127\n\nthe colored troops to take the Confederate works, which Gen. Grant says they would have taken.\n\nHow the Colored Soldiers fought in the crater let the Confederate commanders (some of whose slaves were there) speak: \"Ah, boys, you have got hot work ahead -- they are Negroes and show no quarter.\" (Col. Stewart.)\n\n\"Encouraged, Threatened, Emulating the white troops, the black men fought with desperation. Some Confederate soldiers recognized their slaves at the crater. A Captain of the Forty-first Virginia, gave the military salute to 'Bob' and 'Ben,' whom he had left hoeing corn in Dinwiddie.\"\n\nPetersburg Being Captured, the siege of Richmond was begun with a vigor and determination as only a Grant could command. Meanwhile, a lively discussion was going on at the Confederate capital as to the proposition of Mr. Benjamin to arm the slaves in defence of the city. Gen. Lee and Mr. Jefferson Davis favored this plan, and recommended that such colored people as would join the Confederate ranks should be set free.\n\nSome Score or More Blacks, three of whom were Mr. Benjamin's slaves, enlisted and were daily drilled in the capital square, which stands on an eminence in the center of the city.\n\nPage 128\n\nGen. Lee was now employing his best troops and military manoeuvres to keep Grant out of the Confederate capital. His retreats and skirmishes, executed with genius and tact, delayed the event; but, opposed by superior numbers, his army half-starved, and the Confederacy subjugated in the South-west, he saw the uselessness of a further hopeless sacrifice of his men and surrendered accordingly at Appomattox on the 9th of April, 1865, \"he and his army, defeated in every way possible, numbering 27,516,\" and \"every man was fed by the conqueror.\"\n\nWhen the Union Army marched into Richmond the Confederates set the city on fire, and commenced a wholesale destruction and plunder of everything. Thousands of gallons of rum were emptied into the streets, and staggering destruction of everything useful seemed in order. The colored troops were organized into fire brigades and soon extinguished the fires and stopped the plunder their masters had begun.\n\nPage 129\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nINCIDENTS OF THE WAR.\n\nRodman's Point, N. C., was the scene of a brave deed by a Negro. A flat-boat full of troops, with a few colored soldiers among them, tried to land at this place. The Confederate soldiers were lying in wait for the boat, and the soldiers in it could only save themselves by lying flat on the bottom out of reach of their deadly guns. But if the boat remained where it was very long it would be surrounded, and captured. One of the colored soldiers saw the danger and knowing the boat must be pushed off or all would be killed, suddenly rose up and said: \"Somebody got to die to get us all out dis 'ere, and it mout jes as well be me as anybody!\" Saying this he deliberately stepped on shore and pushed the boat off. The men in the bottom were saved, but the Negro hero's body \"fell forward into the end of the boat, pierced by five bullets.\" He had done what none of them dared do to save the lives of his comrades.\n\nA Negro Established a Clothes-line Telegraph in the Falmouth camp on the Rappahannock in 1863. The Confederate and Union armies occupied opposite\n\nPage 130\n\nsides of the river and used every means of gaining knowledge of each others movements. The colored attendant in the Union camp proved very valuable here as elsewhere during the war. A colored man named Dabney drifted into the Union lines one day from a neighboring farm, and soon proved very useful because of his full knowledge of the topography of the country. He was given employment as \"cook and body servant.\" He became much interested in the system of army signals employed and begged to have them explained to him. This was done and he learned them readily. His wife soon came over, and after staying awhile was allowed to return as servant to a \"secesh woman\" whom General Hooker was about to send to her friends on the other side. She went over and took a place as laundress at \"the headquarters of a prominent rebel General.\" Dabney, her husband, was on the Union side, and soon began to know all about what was to take place in the Confederate camp. An hour or two before any movement took place he could tell all about it, and it always turned out as he said. The wonder and puzzle to the Union men was how he got his information, as he didn't seem to neglect his work to go off for any information and did not converse with the scouts. After numerous questions and many\n\nPage 131\n\nrequests he finally took one of the officers to a prominent point near by, and pointed out a cabin on the banks of the river in the suburbs of the enemy's camp. He asked the officer if he saw a clothes-line with clothes hanging on it. The officer replied \"Yes,\" whereupon Dabney said: \"Well, that clothes-line tells me in half an hour just what goes on in their camp. You see my wife over there, she washes for the officers, and cooks and waits around, and as soon as she hears of any movement or anything going on she comes down and moves the clothes on that line so I can understand it in a minute. That there gray shirt is Longstreet, and when she takes it off it means he's gone down about Richmond. That white shirt means Hill, and when she moves it up to the west end of the line, Hill's Corps has moved up stream. That red one is Stonewall. He's down on the right now, and if he moves she will move that red shirt.\" One morning Dabney came in and reported a movement over there, but said it \"Don't mean anything, they are only making believe.\" An officer went out to look at the clothes-line telegraph through his field-glass. There had been quite a shifting over there of the army flannels. \"But how do you know but there's something in it?\" \"Do you see those two blankets pinned together at the bottom?\"\n\nPage 132\n\nsaid Dabney. \"Yes, but what of it?\" said the officer. \"Why that's her way of making a fish-trap; and when she pins the clothes together that way, it means that Lee is only trying to draw us into his fish-trap.\" As long as the two armies lay watching each other on opposite banks of the stream, Dabney with his clothes-line telegraph continued to be one of the promptest and most reliable of General Hooker's scouts. (Taken from Civil War -- Song and Story).\n\nWilliam Staines, Hero of the Fight at Belmont, was servant to Gen. McClernand. He was close by his employer during many an engagement. On one occasion, in the course of the fight, a captain of one of the companies was struck by a spent ball, which disabled him from walking. Stains, the colored servant, rode up to him and shouted, \"Captain, if you can fight any longer for the Stars and Stripes, take my horse and lead your men.\" He then dismounted and helped the wounded officer into his saddle, and, as he was walking away, a rebel dragoon rushed forward at the officer to take him prisoner. The brave Stains did not flinch, but drew his revolver and put a ball through the rebel's head, scattering his brains over the horse's neck. (Revised from Civil War -- Song and Story.)\n\nPage 133\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nTHE END OF THE WAR.\n\nFor four years the American people had been fighting among themselves. At the outbreak of the struggle the freedom of the slaves was not looked for by many. But the Abolitionists, who grew stronger as the war progressed, pressed their views upon the leaders of the country. They took every advantage of every opportunity to make the freedom of the slaves the main issue of the war; and their efforts, coupled with the desire of the Union leaders to weaken the Confederacy by employing Negro troops, to whom they offered freedom, caused the final proclamation of Mr. Lincoln, in 1863, giving freedom to the slaves.\n\nIn this War there were employed on the Union side more than 186,000 colored soldiers, whose bravery stands vouched for by every Union, and many Confederate Generals, who saw them as daring in the face of death as their fellow white soldiers.\n\nOn the Confederate Side there were enlisted throughout the South, in various employments, some six thousand colored troops. But all over\n\nPage 134\n\nthe South, while their masters were away at war, the Negro women and men were enlisted in the ranks of the private duties of the Southern soldiers' home, which, ever be it remembered to the honor and credit of the Negro race of America, they protected faithfully and industriously. The opportunity for outrage and plunder was open on every side, but not a hurtful hand was laid on the thousands of white widows, orphans and aged who lay defenceless in the Negroes' power. This action on the part of the slaves proves that the race is not fond of bloodshed, and is kind even to its foes.\n\nSome Plantations, on the contrary, were found in better trim on the return of the masters from the war than when they left them.\n\nNegro Body-servants accompanied their masters into the war, shared the roughs of camp life, and often were the last to minister to their wants in the hospital, and the first to bear the tidings home to the anxious family after death; taking with them sometimes the treasured watch or ring.*\n\n* He emphatically denies the assertion that has gained currency, to the effect that Mr. Jefferson Davis, while escaping from the Union forces, was attired in female clothes. Mr. J. states that the Confederate President used a large cloak, which he usually wore indoors, to disguise himself with.\n\nMr. James H. Jones, of Raleigh, N. C., served as messenger to Mr. Jefferson Davis during his\n\nPage 135\n\nPresidency of the Confederacy at Richmond. He was with him when caught by the Union troops in South-west Georgia, and was also confined with him in the \"Rip-Raps\" at Hampton Roads, Virginia. After the war, Mr. Jones kept up a correspondence with Mr. Davis until his death, and received a new photograph whenever Mr. Davis had a new one taken. Mr. Jones is now an honored citizen of Raleigh, and a member of the Board of Aldermen.\n\nPage 136\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nRECONSTRUCTION -- 1865-'68.\n\nAfter the Surrender of Lee at Appomattox, the question arose as to what should be done with the Southern States that for four years had rebelled against the flag of the Union and had set up a flag of their own. The Southern flag was now conquered; and the plan of the North was to restore these conquered States into the Union. Amnesty was offered all those who desired it. A Provisional Government was first established in North Carolina, with W. W. Holden at its head; other States were organized in the same way. Conventions were called by the Provisional Governors of the several States, and new Constitutions adopted in conformity with the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThe Right to Vote was denied the colored people. Exclusion from public places was established by law. Thirty-nine lashes was the punishment for keeping fire-arms. When white persons were implicated colored people could not testify in the courts.\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, making the race citizens, was virtually made null\n\nPage 137\n\nand void by the legislatures of the reconstructed States. So it became necessary to pass The Civil Rights Bill, giving the colored people the right to enter public places, and ride on first-class railroad cars. This bill has been declared unconstitutional by our Supreme Court. Owing to the attempts of the Ku-Klux Klan to prevent colored people from voting, the fifteenth amendment was passed guaranteeing to them the right to vote and to have their votes counted. Thus the eleven Southern States were reconstructed on a basis of universal suffrage, and the colored race began to develop statesmen, orators, lawyers, judges, teachers of various kinds, ministers, and discreet, far-seeing business men.\n\nTHE FREEDMEN'S BUREAU.\n\nThe design of this institution was to educate the newly emancipated colored people into all the ways of freedom. Schools were opened, to which there was a general rush, so great was the thirst for knowledge. Many gray heads could be seen among the children, and the \"Blue Back Speller\" was often to be seen even in the Sabbath-schools. Such a stampede, such an ardent desire for knowledge, was possibly never witnessed anywhere before. Many very old people learned to read the Bible and,\n\nPage 138\n\nthe joy they seemed to get from this long coveted privilege was poured out in often, thankful and fervent prayer.\n\nGen. O. O. Howard was a leading Spirit in the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau. His design was to make the colored people better citizens in every respect. With him was associated a saintly corps of devoted, missionary inclined white men and women, who planted school-houses and churches in many a hamlet of this once slave-cursed but now free land.\n\nMany of These People came from the best families of the North, were well educated, refined and cultured. Their pupils were not slow in catching the beautiful graces of these instructors, and their extra qualities are demonstrated in the wonderful educational progress the race has made within only twenty-six years of actual freedom.\n\nThe Plan was to locate schools at central points where teachers and preachers might be trained to go out into the rural districts in which the majority of the race still lived. The money was contributed by benevolent people of the North, and a wiser investment, both for God and humanity, was never made.\n\nThrough the Influence of the Freedmen's Bureau the Southern States got their present free-school\n\nPage 139\n\nsystem, which they did not have before the war. Some schools established during this time were Shaw University, Raleigh, N. C.; Howard University, Washington, D. C.; Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta University, Atlanta, Ga.; Hampton Normal School, Hampton, Va., and many others, whose influence for good is incalculable.\n\nPage 140\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nPROGRESS SINCE FREEDOM.\n\nThrough a Century and a Half we have now traced our ancestors' history. We have seen how they performed the hard tasks assigned them by their masters: following the hoe and the plow with a laugh and a song; making magnificent estates, building mansions, furnishing them with the splendor of the times; so eager in patriotism as to be the first to shed their blood on the altar of their country's liberty. All this they did with no other hope of reward than a slave's cabin and a life of bondage for themselves and children. Scarcely have they ever sought revenge in riot or bloodshed. Stolen from a home of savage freedom they found themselves in strait circumstances as slaves in America, but the greatness of the Negro's nature crops out plainly in the wonderful way in which he adapted himself to his conditions. The fact that he went to work willingly, worked so long and faithfully, and rebelled so little, marks him as far superior to the Indian, who never accepts the conditions of labor, either for himself or another; and universally enjoys the rank of a savage rather\n\nPage 141\n\nthan that of a civilized being. A plant placed in the window of a dark chamber gradually bends its foliage towards the sunlight; so the Negro, surrounded by the darkness of slavery, bent his life toward the light of his master's God. He found Him. In Him he trusted, to Him he prayed, from Him he hoped for deliverance; no people ever were more devout according to their knowledge of the word, no people ever suffered persecution more bravely, no people ever got more out of the few talents assigned them; and for this humble devotion, this implicit trust and faithfulness God has now rewarded them. The race comes out of slavery with more than it had before it went in. But there was no need of any slavery at all. Jamestown, New England, and the other colonies, might have held the Negro long enough to serve out his passage from Africa, and then given him his freedom, as they did their white slaves imported from England. The mistake was made then, the mistake became a law which the people were educated to believe was just. Many did not believe it, and some slaveholders sought to make the condition of their slaves comfortable. The affection arising between the slave and his master often governed the treatment. The Negro, being largely endowed by nature with affection, affability and a forgiving spirit, generally\n\nPage 142\n\nwon for himself good treatment. Then, too, the master had some soul, and where that ingredient of his make-up was deficient, a selfish interest in the slave as his property somewhat modified the venom that might have more often visited itself upon the unfortunate slave in lashes and stripes.\n\nMany Affections and Friendships formed between master and slave exist to the present day. Some slaves are still at the old homestead, conditions entirely reversed, voting differently at the polls, but friends at home; and in death the family of one follows that of the other to the grave.\n\nWhen the War Ended the whole South was in an unsettled condition -- property destroyed, thousands of her sons dead on the battle-field, no credit, conquered. But if the condition of the whites was bad, that of the blacks was worse. They were without homes, money, or learning. They were now to feed clothe and protect themselves in a government whose treasury they had enriched with two centuries and a half of unrequited labor, and a country whose laws they must obey, but could not read.\n\nIt Was Natural that they should make mistakes. But they made less mistakes than the bummers who came South for plunder during reconstruction times, and with the false promise of \"forty acres\n\nPage 143\n\nand a mule,\" led the unlettered race into a season of idleness and vain hopes. But this condition did not last. The Negro inherited the ability to work from the institution of slavery. He soon set about to utilize this ability. I ask what race could have, done more? And this the Negro has done, though virtually ostracised from the avenues of trade and speculation. His admission to a trades union is the exception, rather than the rule, in America. A colored boy taking a place as porter in a store at the same time with a white boy, may find the white boy soon promoted to a clerkship, then to a partnership in the firm, if he is smart; but the colored boy remains year after year where he first commenced, no matter how worthy, no matter how competent. His lot is that of a menial, custom assigns him there, and in looking for clerks and partners he is not thought of by the white business man; and thus, by the rigid laws of custom, he has continually lost golden opportunities to forge his fortune; yet he has prospered in spite of this, and it bespeaks for him a superior manhood.\n\nPage 144\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nRELIGIOUS PROGRESS.\n\nBefore the war the colored people of the South worshipped mainly in the white churches, or in separate churches usually ministered to by white pastors. But the colored people, naturally inclined to religion, soon developed preachers of their own. They composed their own music, which expressed, in their own way, thanks and petitions to heaven. Their music isoriginal, entertaining, and pathetic -- and the only original music of the American Contiinent, when we remember that other than Negro tecniques and melodies are all borrowed from the masters of Europe.\n\nDebarred of the Privileges of schools, it is not surprising that the religion of the slaves should be otherwise than somewhat twisted from the cultured tone of the Bible to suit the whims of an unlettered race. It can be truly said though, that, considering the circumstances, they did not bury the talents given them. But the religious progress since freedom is so marvelous as to completely overshadow much of the darkness of the past. Let\n\nPage 145\n\nus notice briefly several of the great religious denominations of the race. The colored people produce less infidels than any other similar number of people in America. They are proverbially religious and God-fearing.\n\nBISHOP W. J. GAINES.\n\nBishop W. J. Gaines is a representative of what twenty-five years of freedom has done in many instances for the colored race. He was born a slave in Georgia on the plantation of the famous Robert Toombs, member of the Confederate Cabinet. He had reached his majority before the\n\nPage 146\n\nwar ended, and it is needless to say his chances for early culture were very meagre. But, nevertheless, he learned to read at odd moments, and after freedom applied himself to his books with undaunted and determined zeal. He often speaks of how \"I made up my mind when I entered the ministry to reach the highest position in my church through merit.\" He has won his coveted prize in this respect; and each step of his life, from the plow-handle to the Bishopric, has been markedly illustrious. He is a living argument of the innate genius of the race, that might, like the poet's rose, have been \"born to blush unseen,\" but for the fact that he embraced the possibilities that freedom opened up before him. He is of commanding presence, dignified, and a natural leader of men. It is an inspiration to be in his presence, and his appearance on the rostrum is natural and complete.\n\nHe has possibly built more church edifices than any other member of his denomination. Morris Brown College, of Atlanta, worth something over seventy thousand dollars, is the work of his hands, and that of itself would sufficiently speak for his ability, without referring to thousands of dollars raised for other purposes. Bishop Gaines can be counted on to foster and encourage any enterprise tending to the benefit of the Negro race,\n\nPage 147\n\nand he never fails to encourage the young people who are anxious to rise.\n\nThe A. M. E. Church, founded by Rev. Richard Allen, of Philadelphia, Penn., because of the spirit of caste and race prejudice of the Protestant Church during and after the American Revolution, has exerted a broad and unmeasured influence upon the Negro race. From a meeting held in 1816, at Rev. Allen's private house, has sprung surprising results. It has 3,394 churches, valued at $5,028,126; 660 parsonages, valued at $312,763.75, and the total valuation of church property is $5,341,889.25. It has a publication department, which sends out the Christian Recorder and A. M. E. Review to thousands of people. The salaries of the editors of these papers amount to $10,800. In 1887, the money raised for all purposes was $1,064,569.50, with an indebtedness of $509,113.24. Wilberforce University is a noted institution controlled by the A. M. E. Church. The influence of this church for good among the people cannot be measured. The bishops are an extraordinary set of learned men, many of whom are self-made, but yet are authors, orators, linguists, theologians and scholars that will compare favorably with the best theological brain of America.\n\nPage 148\n\nREV. E. M. BRAWLEY.\n\nRev. E. M. Brawley, of Charleston, S. C., is noted especially for his sober, earnest and pious Christian life. He is a scholarly gentleman and thoroughly devoted to the interests of his people. It has been his fortune to be President of Selma University, Ala.; Sunday-school agent in South Carolina, and editor of the Baptist Tribune. Such a hard-working, zealous and thoroughly honest man should be a pride to any race.\n\nPage 149\n\nThe Baptist Church was founded by Roger Williams. The church officers derive their power from the members. In the beginning Roger Williams' influence had a tendency to keep down race prejudice. But from the rapid increase of slaves, the feeling grew until self-interest demanded a separation. They form a body of useful and intelligent people. Kentucky has a host of Baptists, who own much valuable property. There are more Baptists in Virginia than any other Southern State. Some of the churches have very large congregations. There are a large number of Baptist churches in the District of Columbia, some of which have interesting histories. Among the noble, true and faithful workers of the Baptists are Duke, Williams, Anderson and Leonard, Andrew Grimes and Dr. W. J. Simmons, of Louisville, Ky., who have consecrated their lives to their church in the spreading of the gospel.\n\nThe Baptist Church exercises a religious and educational influence over more colored people than any other denomination in America. I gather from the minutes of their National Convention of 1887, that they have a total membership in the United States of 1,155,486; and that they have 6,605 ordained ministers, 3,304 Sabbath-schools,\n\nPage 150\n\nLIVINGSTON COLLEGE.\n\nPage 151\n\nwith 10,718 teachers and officers, and 194,492 pupils. They own $3,056,571 worth of church property. They operate twenty-five colleges and seminaries, worth $1,072,140, and in which are annually taught more than 3,609 pupils.\n\nThe A. M. E. Zion Church is another of the powerful religious denominations among the colored people, and is everywhere urging the race to a higher standard of living in all respects. Their membership is in the neighborhood of 500,000. They support and control entirely Livingston College, of Salisbury, N. C., a progressive and well manned institution, and the Star of Zion, the church organ, ably edited by Mr. John C. Dancy. The Livingston College Faculty is all colored, and it has property valued at over $100,000.\n\nThe Northern Methodist Church supports many churches in the South ministered over by colored pastors. There are several schools supported by them, prominent among which is Bennett College, of Greensboro, N. C., and controlled entirely by a colored Faculty. Other schools of this denomination manned by white Faculties are, with Bennett College, doing a most necessary and beneficial work among the colored people. So might be mentioned schools and churches supported by Northern Presbyterians, Northern Congregationalists, and other\n\nPage 152\n\ndenominations, all of which are to be reckoned as great uplifting agencies among the colored people. Some of the Northern societies spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every year on Negro education and religion in the South.\n\nPage 153\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nEDUCATIONAL PROGRESS.\n\nCan the Negro learn anything? Was the first question he had to answer after schools were established for him. He has answered this question satisfactorily to the most incredulous in every instance where brought to a test. The fact that every slave State had laws against his being taught before the war, and that they opposed it afterwards, ought to be a sufficient answer. But if this is not sufficient, let speak the deeds of Professor Scarborough, of Macon, Ga., author of a series of Greek text-books which have been adopted at Yale; Geo. W. Williams, author of \"History of the American Negro;\" Jos. T. Wilson, author of \"Black Phalanx\"; C. G. Morgan, class orator at Harvard, 1890, and a host of others.\n\nWHAT THE SOUTH IS DOING FOR NEGRO EDUCATION.\n\nIt would be a serious error to omit, in speaking of the educational progress of the Negro since freedom, what has been done to help him by the Southern States. Though at first bitterly opposed\n\nPage 154\n\nto Negro education, there has been a wonderful change of sentiment on this subject. They made laws against Negro education before the war, now they make laws for it. In the more liberal portions of many Southern States, good schools are provided for the colored children. Some States have asylums for the deaf, dumb, blind and insane. The Institute for these unfortunates at Raleigh, N. C., is entirely supported by the State, which employs a most competent colored Principal in the person of Professor W. F. Debnam. The South spends annually about $6,000,000 on Negro schools, and this sum will soon be increased. Some of the States have Normal Schools, Universities and Training Schools for the colored youth. There are some who oppose Negro education on the ground that the whites pay two-thirds of the taxes. A false position this -- the laborer and consumer pay the taxes on capital. The Negro is the laborer of the South, and a large consumer. He produces more than a billion dollars worth of farm products annually, not estimating other products; and it is his toil, his muscle that makes the school-fund; and out of the inexhaustible store-house of his own labor does he draw his quota of the appropriation for the schools.\n\nThe High Schools, Seminaries, Colleges and Professional Schools for the colored people, number\n\nPage 155\n\nSHAW UNIVERSITY.\n\nPage 156\n\nnearly two hundred. Many of them are controlled entirely by colored Faculties, as Livingston and Bennett Colleges, N. C.; Kittrell's Normal and Industrial Institute, and Shaw University, except its President, who is white, but one of the first Presidents to recognize the ability of young colored men to teach the higher branches. Dr. H. M. Tupper inaugurated a movement by putting young colored men at work in Shaw University, which has been followed by many of the other schools supported by donations from white friends in the North. The plan works admirably well, and, besides teaching the race to confide in the ability of its own educated men and women, it affords lucrative employment to many, who are by nature and choice fitted for the work of teaching.\n\nA Self-made Man is a worthy description when applied to a Saxon. But a knowledge of the facts will teach us that nine-tenths of all the leading Negroes were and are self made. The royal road to knowledge is beyond question closed to the young colored man.\n\nThere is No Large Estate to draw on for school bills; no rich uncle or kinsman to foot the bill and wait till success in after years for a settlement. His own brawny muscle is usually the young colored student's means of support. Many of\n\nPage 157\n\nthem work in school between hours. In fact, most of the schools for colored people in the South assign certain hours each day in which the students are to labor. Some institutions do not spend one cent for domestic labor during the whole of the school terms. Yet they, in some instances, raise quite enough farm and garden products for their tables, and sometimes make brick enough to put up extra buildings. The time usually used by the white student in foot-ball and other games is utilized by the colored student in faithful toil. The fact that in none of the colored schools the expense for tuition, board, lodging, laundry-work and incidentals is over $12 per month (and in some cases it is as low as $6), is a strong argument in favor of the help the Negro youth furnishes towards his own education. People with such a love for knowledge that they are willing to thus toil for it may be relied upon to use that knowledge properly.\n\nWhen the War Closed there were about four million colored people in the United States. Scarcely a million of them could read. Now they number about eight millions, and nearly half of them can read. There are 1,158,008 colored children in the schools, anually taught by 20,000 Negro teachers. The colored people of the South have made more progress in education since the war than in anything\n\nPage 158\n\nelse; and they are still thirsty for knowledge. The schools everywhere are crowded. The love of knowledge seems to be instinctive, and thousands of faithful mothers spend many weary nights at the ironing-board and wash-tub, in order to get money to help their children obtain an education. With the start they now have, twenty-five years more of earnest work will show marvelous changes in the educational condition of the race. No people ever learned more in so short a time.\n\nMUSICAL PROGRESS.\n\nThe Fisk Jubilee Singers have sung the fame of the Negro in all America, much of Europe and Australia. The slave music is the only original music of America. The Indian has none, and white Americans have borrowed from the masters of Europe. Negro melodies are now a part of the classical music of this country. The peculiarity of Negro song is its pathos and trueness to nature. It stirs the soul and revives a sunken hope. Travelers describe the music of the native African as sung in a major key, which key characterizes the songs of a conquering people. Slavery has not extracted this characteristic totally from the American Negro's songs. While he sings not the\n\nPage 159\n\nconquering major of battle, he thrills you with the pleasing minor of hope. Dr. Talmage says: \"Everybody knows the natural gift of the African for singing. No singing on this continent like that of the colored churches in the South. Everybody going to Richmond or Charleston wants to hear the Africans sing.\"\n\nPage 160\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nFINANCIAL PROGRESS.\n\nThe Freedmen's Savings Bank, though it failed, furnishes a strong argument in favor of the thrift and industry of the recently emancipated slaves. In this bank the colored people deposited during the years between 1866 and 1871, about $57,000,000. The original design of this institution was doubtless good, but it fell into bad hands and the consequence was a most disgraceful failure.\n\nThe Negro's Confidence in banks was, on his first trial of them, badly shaken. He has not recovered yet. Many colored people who would deposit their money now, are reluctant to do so when they remember the \"Freedmen's Bank failure.\" The branch offices of the bank in the different States were placed in the hands of colored men who worked for salaries under instructions from the home office. To this day sentiment attaches blame on these colored bank officers, who themselves were as much deluded as the depositors. It was a sad and disgraceful piece of legalized robbery. But the Negro is putting his money in other enterprises, and though unsuccessful in his first, his\n\nPage 161\n\nlast efforts at economy are bearing rich fruit. The property owned by the colored people now is computed at the following figures:\n\nTwenty-five Years' Accumulations: Alabama, $9,200,125; Arkansas, $8,010,315; Florida, $7,900,400; Georgia, $10,415,330; Kentucky, $5,900,010; Louisiana, $18,100,528; Mississippi, $13,400,213; Missouri, $6,600,343; North Carolina, $11,010,652; South Carolina, $12,500,000; Texas, $18,010,545; Tennessee, $10,400,211; Virginia, 4,900,000.\n\nThe Colored Churches in the United States own $16,310,441; the total amount of property owned by the colored people in all the States is rated at over $263,000,000.\n\nMuch Property is owned by the colored people of the North and West. Some of their estates run high into the hundred thousands. Many of them, though shut out almost entirely from the trades and business avenues, have accumulated handsome homes and live in elegance and refinement.\n\nRev. A. G. Davis, of Raleigh, N. C., in an address at the North Carolina Colored Agricultural Fair, said, in reference to the Negro's progress, this, among other things: \"Scan if you will the long line of eight million Negroes as they march slowly but surely up the road of progress, and you will find in her\n\nPage 162\n\nranks such men as Granville T. Woods, of Ohio, the electrician, mechanical engineer, manufacturer of telephones, telegraph and electrical instruments; William Still, of Philadelphia, the coal dealer; Henry Tanner, the artist; John W. Terry, foreman of the Iron and Fitting Department of the Chicago West Division Street Car Company; J. D. Baltimore, engineer, machinist and inventor, of Washington, D. C.; Wiley Jones, of Pine Bluff, Ark., the owner of a street car railroad, race track and park; Richard M. Hancock, foreman of the pattern shops of the Eagle Works and Manufacturing Co., and draughtsman; John Black, the inventor, whose inventions are worth tens of thousands; W. C. Atwood, the lumber merchant and capitalist.\" To this we might add a\n\nLIST OF THE NAMES OF A FEW WEALTHY COLORED MEN IN THE UNITED STATES:\n\nQUOTED AT\n\nAmanda Eubanks, of Georgia . . . . . $ 400,000\n\nWm.

What has been said in this chapter is not to make you content and satisfied; but rather to inspire new zeal and fresh courage, that each one of you may add something more to what has already been accomplished. You can, you must, and we believe you will. Do not falter on account of difficulties. Set your standard high and go to it, remembering that labor, coupled with a strong devotion to integrity, will surely conquer.\n\nPage 165\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nSOME NOTED NEGROES.\n\nHon. Hiram R. Revels, a native of North Carolina, graduate of Knox, College, Ill., A. M. E. minister, President of Alcorn University, Mississippi, elected to the State Senate, Mississippi, was the first Negro to hold the position of U. S. Senator, elected to fill the place of Jefferson Davis in 1869, to the wonder and surprise of all America.\n\nHon. J. Mercer Langston, A. B., A. M., LL.D.; great Indian-Anglo-Saxon Negro. Grew to manhood, educated and pursued a business and official life in Ohio up to time of manhood. He made unsuccessful attempts, on account of his color, in New York and Ohio, to attend the law schools. After attempting private lessons, he grew discouraged and graduated from the Theological Department of Oberlin College, Ohio. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar. After this he was made Dean and Professor of Law at Howard University, where he received the degree of LL.D. President Hayes appointed him U. S. Minister and Consul\n\nPage 166\n\nGeneral to Hayti, which position he honorably held eight years. He was also President of the Virginia Normal Collegiate Institute.\n\nHon. Robert Small, the pilot and captain of the steamer Planet, also the Congressman, must not be\n\nROBERT SMALL\n\noverlooked on these pages. Moving from Beaufort, South Carolina, to Charleston in '51, he was employed as \"rigger,\" thereby getting a knowledge of ships and the life of sailors. His greatest work was with the Planter, a Confederate transport Page 167\n\nsteamer in '61, afterwards used as a dispatch boat. The officers retired from the boat on the night of May 13, 1862, and left eight colored men on watch, Small being one of the number. He was only called a wheelman then, but in reality was a pilot. He with the others on board conceived the risky plan of giving the boat over to the Federals. Everything being ready, and after taking on Small's wife and three children, they started out at 2 o'clock. In passing out of the harbor and by each fort the steamer gave her signals as though the Confederate captain was on board, and everything was all right. The dangerous plan, which if it had been found out would have ended in instant death, was a success. The boat was given over to the Federal Captain Nichols, who found her quite an additional help to the Union.\n\nROBERT B. ELLIOTT.\n\nOn the pages of history no name shines forth with more lustre than that of Hon. Bobert B. Elliott. He was one of earth's sons, plucked too soon to reap the harvest which was in store for him. This eloquent orator and distinguished lawyer was a graduate from an English college. After finishing there he studied law under FitzHerbert, of the London bar. He then came to the\n\nPage 168\n\nUnited States, and began his brilliant and successful career. It was in the Forty-second Congress, while a representative of South Carolina, that he impressed himself indelibly upon the minds of his country as a man of giant intellect and rare oratorical ability. Alexander Stephens of Georgia, Beck of Kentucky, Harris of Virginia, had severely assailed the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Bill after which Mr. Elliott arose and addressed the House as follows an effort that bespeaks the ability of the man: \"Mr. Speaker, while I am sincerely grateful for the high mark of courtesy that has been accorded me by this House, it is a matter of regret to me that it is necessary at this day that I should rise in the presence of an American Congress to advocate a bill which simply asserts rights and equal privileges for all classes of American citizens. I regret, sir, that the dark hue of my skin may lend a color to the imputation. that I am controlled by motives personal to myself in my advocacy of this great measure of natural justice. Sir, the motive that impels me is restricted by no such narrow boundary, but is as broad as your Constitution. I advocate it, sir, because it is right. The bill, however, not only appeals to your justice, but it demands a response to your gratitude. In the events that led\n\nPage 169\n\nto the achievement of American independence the Negro was not an inactive or unconcerned spectator. He bore his part bravely upon many battle-fields, although uncheered by that certain hope of political elevation which victory would secure to the white man. The tall granite shaft, which a grateful State has reared above its sons who fell in defending Fort Griswold against the attack of Benedict Arnold, bears the name of John Freeman and others of the African race, who there cemented with their blood the corner-stone of your Republic. In the State, which I have had the honor in part to represent, the rifle of the black man rang out against the troops of the British crown in the darkest days of the American Revolution. * * * I meet him (Stephens) only as an adversary, nor shall age or any other consideration restrain me from saying that he now offers this Government, which he has done his utmost to destroy, a very poor return for its magnanimous treatment, to come here to seek to continue, by the assertion of doctrines obnoxious to the true principles of our Government, the burdens and oppressions, which rest upon five millions of his countrymen, who never failed to lift their earnest prayers for the success of this Government, when the gentleman was asking to break up the Union\n\nPage 170\n\nof the States, and to blot the American Republic from the galaxy of nations.\" * * * He related to Mr. Beck the story of the fleeing of the Kentucky soldiers at a most urgent time during the second war with Great Britain, and then proceeded to say: \"In quoting this indisputable piece of history, I do so only by way of admonition, and not to question the well-attested gallantry of the true Kentuckian, and to suggest to the gentleman that he should not flaunt his heraldry so proudly while he bears this bar-sinister on the military escutcheon of his State -- a State which answered the call of the Republic in 1861, when treason thundered at the very gates of the Capital, by coldly declaring her neutrality in the impending struggle. The Negro, true to that patriotism that has ever characterized and marked his history, came to the aid of the Government in its efforts to maintain the Constitution. To that Government he now appeals; that Constitution he now invokes for protection against unjust prejudices founded upon caste.\"\n\nWilliam Wells Brown, Esq., was born of slave parents; he escaped to the North and so improved his time from then on until he is now known to the world as M. D.; historian of the Negro race, lecturer and author.\n\nPage 171\n\nBISHOP D. A. PAYNE.\n\nPage 172\n\nRev. D. A. Payne, D.D., LL.D., is the oldest bishop of the A. M. E. Church, also its true, tried friend. He is a great educator, and has the Negro's best interests at heart. Many generous and noble deeds has he done for his race. He is the scholar and reverenced father of the A. M. E. Church.\n\nRev. William T. Dixon, the pastor of Concord Baptist Church, greatly deserves notice. Rev. Dixon has been a great power in his church, and has been the means of exerting an excellent intellectual and moral influence upon his people at Brooklyn, N. Y. His efforts for the conversion of the souls of his fellow-men are untiring, patient, and full of sacrifice. Many faces brighten and hearts ring with joy when his name is called.\n\nBishop H. M. Turner is well known throughout the United States. He stands as a model for the poor boy to-day with scanty means. His early efforts for an education were accompanied with many disappointments and failures. Though free, he had to submit to the law, \"no Negro must be educated.\" However, he got a start and added to his small stock until he could read the Bible and hymn-book. It is said that he learned fifty psalms in a night, and while plowing repeated them to his co-laborers. He was hired out most of the time by his father; his work was always with hard and\n\nPage 173\n\noften cruel overseers. But he said, and kept his word, when a boy, no white man should whip and scar his back. When about fifteen years of age he was employed as a waiting-boy in a law office, where he attracted special notice by his tenacious memory and accuracy in delivering messages. The lawyers took an interest in him and taught him whatever he wanted to learn. From this he moved on from one level to the next higher -- being a hard student all the way up to the present. He now is known as bishop, philosopher, politician, author, devoted race-man, and ex-United States Chaplain.\n\nHon. P. B. S. Pinchback has the honor of having held more positions than any other colored man. He was a true and faithful soldier during the civil war. At the time of the impeachment of Governor Warmouth, of Louisiana, he became acting Governor of that State, finally becoming the real Governor until the term expired.\n\nProf. Richard Theodore Greener stands with the first scholars of the Negro race. His essays and orations rank high in the fields of literature and oratory. He has held the position of Chief Civil Service Examiner of New York City, lawyer, prize essayist, orator, and Dean of the Law Department of Howard University.\n\nPage 174\n\nB. K. BRUCE.\n\nSenator B. K. Bruce, another son of the Negro race, though not receiving his privilege as a man until 1865, and notwithstanding then having attained to the age of 24, smothered no longer the intellectual fires then burning in his soul. Though a Virginian he entered into public life in Mississippi. Much useful knowledge he gathered while\n\nPage 175\n\nsergent-at-arms of the State Senate of Mississippi, which helped him to admirably fill his place as U. S. Senator. It was, also, his honor to hold the position of Register of the U. S. Treasury.\n\nProf. W. S. Scarborough is the author of a set of Greek text-books which have been adopted at Yale; he is also versed in many of the modern and ancient languages including, Gothic, Zend, Old Slavonic, Luthuanian, and Sanscrit. In every respect he is a representative man; having come up from poverty and obscurity to his present high position in life. He was born in Macon, Ga. When the war closed he, like many other colored boys, entered the \"Yankee school\" there, from which he subsequently attended Atlanta University. From there, he went to Oberlin, Ohio, where he graduated in 1875. He taught school in the vacation months to support himself while in school. Well may we say he is a self-made man, if unflagging industry, self-reliance, and an indomitable determination to succeed may be counted as ingredients in the make-up of such characters. He is now teacher of classics in Wilberforce University, which position he holds in preference to many others his scholarly abilities fit him for, and which he might attain. He is recognized as a thorough scholar by the world of learned men, and stands out as an unchallenged vindication of the race's ability.\n\nPage 176\n\nProf. B. T. Washington is what we so often hear of, a self-made man. Being left quite young an orphan to forge his own way through the world, he started out determined to get an education. With the assistance of friends, he reached Hampton Institute with fifty cents in his pocket. He finished the course by working out his expenses as janitor. After graduating at Hampton, he taught a while at Malden, Va., then his home, and then took a course of study at Wayland Seminary. He taught two years at Hampton Institute and then accepted the position of Principal of the Tuskegee Normal School, which he has held with a remarkable degree of success and honor to himself and his race. The school is now in a flourishing condition and doing much good throughout the State of Alabama, and even in other States.\n\nProf. E. E. Smith, a native North Carolinian, and a young man of the post-bellum school, has quickly risen to fame by an appointment under President Cleveland as Minister of the U. S. Government to the Republic of Liberia. Mr. Smith served in this position for four years with honor and credit to himself and his country. Prior to his appointment as Minister to Liberia he was the worthy Principal of the Fayetteville, N.C., Normal School. He is a graduate of the famous Shaw University, and destined to reflect still greater honors on this his Alma Mater.\n\nPage 177\n\nJ. C. PRICE.\n\nDr. J. C. Price, D. D., the well known temperance orator, lives in the hearts of many people. His clear and distinct voice, fascinating manner and excellent ability to handle a story, gives him a hearty welcome in every place to which he goes. He was the first colored preacher to stand in the\n\nPage 178\n\npulpit of Henry Ward Beecher, and now with the sympathy and love of a parent for his pupils, he with honor holds the position of President of Livingston College, North Carolina. He is a native of North Carolina.\n\nEDMONIA LEWIS.\n\nThe subject of this sketch, by the diligent use of the powers God gave her, has done much to demonstrate to the world what genius exists in the race she represents. Left an orphan in early life, she was not educated according to her desire, but was conscious of a power and a burning desire to make herself felt in the world.\n\nHer first visit to Boston proved the turning point in her life. When she for the first time saw the statute of Franklin, her soul was touched. While the dull stone seemed cold to others, there was a chord in her young soul which the cold lineaments played upon, and she exclaimed exultingly, \"I can make a stone man.\" Wm. Lloyd Garrison, always ready to help the race, introduced her to a leading Boston sculptor. He gave her some clay and a model of a human foot, saying, \"Go home and make that; if there is anything in you it will come out.\" Her first effort was brought back to the\n\nPage 179\n\nteacher, who examined it, then broke it to pieces telling her to try again. She did so, and succeeded. Her achievements since have placed her among the prominent artists of the world. She now resides at Rome, where her studio is the famed resort of art lovers the world over. Some of her works are, busts of Chas. Sumner, Lincoln, Hiawatha's Wooing, Forever Free, Hagar in the Wilderness, Madonna, with infant Christ and two adoring Angels. She was patronized by the leading Englishmen, such as Disraeli and others.\n\nT. T. Fortune, Esq., the well known and fearless editor, was also a slave, born of slave parents in Florida. He is a deep thinker and an enthusiastic and true worker for his race. A great agitator and denouncer of the wrong and encourager of the right, also an author and pamphleteer.\n\nRev. W. J. Simmons, A. B., A. M., D. D., was, beyond question, one of the strongest characters of the race. He was the President of the Normal and Theological Institute at Louisville, Ky. At one time he was editor of the American Baptist, and did a telling work in that position by his strong editorials and telling points in behalf of the interests of the race. But Rev. Simmons is better known as an educator. He took charge of the\n\nPage 180\n\nInstitute at Louisville when nothing but failure seemed to stare it in the face; and from an appearance of hopeless ruin he has worked it up to a point of great excellency. It now stands as one of the most important factors of Negro education in the South, and its success is due to the indomitable energy, force and brain of Dr. Simmons. He has also furnished the literature of the race with a valuable work known as \"Men of Mark.\" In it you will be pleased to read elegant sketches of many of the race's best men.\n\nThe Hon. H. P. Cheatham is a son of Shaw University, and a young man whose success is due to emancipation. He is now one of the colored members of our National Congress, having won his seat, through a most desperate contest, for the Second District of North Carolina. His record in Congress is good; not so much known, however, for his \"much speaking,\" as for the devotion he shows to the interests of his race. Mr. Cheatham came up from the ranks of the school teachers, leaving off that work to take a position as Register of Deeds in his (Vance) county, which position he held creditably for a number of years, and which he resigned to run for Congress in 1888.\n\nPage 181\n\nJOHN R. LYNCH.\n\nHon. John R. Lynch is another son of whom we may be proud. He bid not his talents, but rather multiplied them. It was his honor to preside at the National Republican Convention in 1884 at Chicago. We know him as orator, lawyer, Congressman and prominent politician.\n\nAmong the Noted Singers should be mentioned Madame Selika, \"the colored Jenny Lind.\" Her voice is, perhaps, sweeter than the renowned Jenny Lind (white), and capable of greater variation in length and pitch. Madame Selika stands as a\n\nPage 182\n\nprodigy among singers. She would stand near the head of modern female voices were it not that she is colored.\n\nMrs. Francis Ellen Harper, a native of Baltimore, Maryland, was denied the opportunities of an education in her early days, but as soon as the way was opened she applied herself with such energy and earnestness as to develope her rare intellectual abilities and put her before the world as a grand, good woman. She is known as an entertaining lecturer and pleasing essayist.\n\nMiss Flora Batson Bergen is another representative of the art of song. The wonder is that she renders the most difficult classical music from memory, being unable to read notes. She is an undoubted genius.\n\nMiss H. Q. Brown stands high as an elocutionist and reader of wonderful force and descriptive powers.\n\nPage 183\n\nBLIND TOM.\n\n\"Blind Tom,\" the Negro Musical Prodigy, is known as well in Europe as America. His correct name is Thomas Bethune. He was born May 25, 1849, at Columbus, Georgia. When a babe he seemed totally blind, but in later years he could see a little. His memory of dates, persons and places seems almost perfect. Shake his hand to-day and speak to him, tell your name, and ten years after he will recall your voice and name. He is uniformly and studiously polite, and entertains the highest regard for truth in all things. At four\n\nPage 184\n\nyears of age he found his way to his master's piano for the first time. He had attempted to use his voice in imitating the piano and other sounds before this. He imitated all the sounds he knew on the piano, and when his supply was exhausted he began to compose for himself. He would play, as he would remark, \"what the wind said\" or the \"birds said,\" or the \"trees said.\" When five years old, during a thunder-storm he composed his \"Rain Storm\" which is so true to Nature that one imagines on hearing it that he can hear the thunder roar, and \"looks for the lightning to flash.\" One author says of him: \"I can't teach him anything; he knows more of music than we know or can know. We can learn all that great genius can reduce to rule and put in tangible form; he knows more than that. I do not even know what it is; but I feel it is something beyond my comprehension. All that can be done for him will be to let him hear fine playing; he will work it all out for himself after a while.\"\n\nHe plays the most difficult classical music of Mendelssohn and Bethoven and cannot read a note. His marches include \"Delta Kappa Epsilon,\" by Peace; \"Grand March de Concert,\" by Wallace. He imitates as perfectly as if natural, \"Battle of Manassas,\" \"Douglass' Speech,\" guitar,\n\nPage 185\n\nbanjo, church organ, Dutch woman and hand-organ, a harp, Scotch bagpipe, and a music-box -- all on the piano. His equal, if it ever existed in the world, has not been known. He stands out as a phenomenon, a genius, a prodigy in black. He still lives, and is constantly improving and adding to his large stock of musical achievements.\n\nPage 186\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nTHE FREE PEOPLE OF COLOR IN NORTH CAROLINA.\n\nBY THE HON. JOHN S. LEARY.\n\nIn the Revolutionary War there were enlisted as soldiers in the American army quite a number of colored men who served faithfully and fought gallantly for the cause of American Independence. Among others who enlisted from North Carolina, were Louie Revels, John Lomax, Thomas Bell, Charles Hood and John Pettiford. All of these surviving the contest, drew as long as they lived a pension from the United States Government. When the Congress of freemen (freeholders) assembled at Halifax and on the 18th day of December, 1776, ratified a Constitution for North Carolina, the elective franchise was extended to every freeman residing in the State who was twenty-one years of age and had paid a public tax. Under the provisions of this Constitution, all free colored persons living in North Carolina, who were twenty-one years of age and had paid a public tax, claimed and exercised the right to vote until the\n\nPage 187\n\nyear 1835, a period of more than a half century, when the Convention which assembled that year, acting on the principle that might makes right, adopted an amended Constitution which barred them of that right. Having been barred of the right to vote by the provisions of the Constitution of 1835, in the year 1838 the question as to whether they were or were not citizens coming before the State Supreme Court, the following extract from the opinion of the Court, delivered by Gaston, Judge, will show that the Court decided that they were citizens:\n\n\"Whatever distinctions may have existed in the Roman law between citizens and free inhabitants, they are unknown to our institutions. Before our Revolution all free persons born within the dominion of the King of Great Britain, whatever their color or complexion, were native-born British subjects -- those born out of his allegiance were aliens. Slavery did not exist in England, but it did exist in the British Colonies. Slaves were not, in legal parlance, persons, but property. The moment the incapacity -- or disqualification -- of slavery was removed, they became persons, and were then either British subjects or not British subjects, according as they were or were not born within the allegiance of the British King. Upon the close of the Revolution no\n\nPage 188\n\nother change took place in the law of North Carolina than was consequent upon the transition from a colony dependent on an European king to a free and sovereign State. Slaves remained slaves. British subjects in North Carolina became North Carolina freemen. Foreigners, until made members of the State, continued aliens. Slaves manumitted here became freemen -- and, therefore, if born within North Carolina, are citizens of North Carolina -- and all free persons born within the State are born citizens of the State.\"\n\nHowever, under the provisions of the amended Constitution, and the laws enacted subsequent to its ratification by the Legislature, there existed in North Carolina prior to the year 1865 three distinct classes of people: The free white man, enjoying and exercising all the rights and privileges of an American citizen; the free colored man, deprived of nearly all the rights and privileges of an American citizen; and the colored slave who, in legal parlance, was a mere chattel. Owing to this anomalous state of affairs, whatever was accomplished by the genius, industry, effort, culture and literary attainments of the colored American residing in the State, was studiously ignored and cast aside as not worthy to be recorded as a part and parcel of the history of the people of the State.\n\nPage 189\n\nTo preserve the memory, as well as to perpetuate the work and worth of a very eminent colored citizen of North Carolina, I here present for the information of the youths, and all other persons who do not know anything of the history of his life, a biographical narrative of the Rev. John Chavers. This gentleman, a regularly ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church, came to the United States in the year 1822. He settled in North Carolina, and after remaining here for the period of time required by law, was naturalized and became a citizen of the State and United States. In culture and literary attainments he far excelled a majority of all classes of the people living in the State at that day and date. A Christain gentleman, possessing all the qualities which go to make a true and noble man, he was honored for his eminent ability and respected for his Christian character. He lived in the town of Fayetteville for a period of two years, preached and taught school. He removed from Fayetteville, and afterwards lived respectively in the counties of Franklin, Wake and Chatham, in each of which he preached and taught school. The school organized and taught by him in Chatham County was patronized almost exclusively by the white people. In the light of present surroundings, it may seem\n\nPage 190\n\nstrange and incredulous that the white people of North Carolina would send their children to a colored school teacher and consent to have their lives and characters shaped and moulded by him, but this is accounted for in the fact that the recorded history of those times goes to show that classical scholars and thoroughly equipped school teachers were not near so plentiful among the white people then as they are now, and they were not so very particular as to the color of the \"Gamaliel\" at whose feet their children should sit, provided he had the ability and learning to impart the desired information. As evidence of this gentleman's eminence as an instructor, and the influence which his precept and example had upon the lives and character of his pupils, I mention the names of a few who were so fortunate as to enjoy the benefit of his instruction and careful training. The late Honorable Kenneth Rayner, one of his pupils, was well known to the people of North Carolina as an eminent lawyer, and, before the civil war, as a Representative from North Carolina in the United States Congress, and after said war was the able and efficient Solicitor General of the United States Treasury under President Arthur's administration. Mr. Thomas J. Curtis, a successful business man, and for several years Mayor of the town of Fayetteville,\n\nPage 191\n\nwas another, and yet another was the late Honorable Abram Rencher, of Chatham County, who was one of the most distinguished men the State has ever produced. There were a great many others, but it is not necessary to mention by name any more. These are enough to show that if justice had been done, this illustrious colored gentleman would have had a place in the recorded history of the State of his adoption as one of her earliest, most successful educators and eminent men.\n\nPage 192\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\nUp to the present time the Negro has been a success in every avenue of life. As a soldier and citizen he has always been faithful to his country's flag; as a politician he has filled successfully many honorable positions, from that of a Town Constable to the Registry of the Treasury of the United States; he has been a legislator, a senator, a judge, a lawyer, a juror, a shrewd business man, and won honor, respect and confidence in every such position, and all this in twenty-five years. Every sort of hindrance has been thrown in his way, but he is overcoming them all, and daily winning friends from the ranks of those most opposed to his progress. Time is yet to bring forth better things for the race. Let there be patience and an honest, persistent endeavor to do the very best in everything, and ere long we shall \"reap if we faint not.\" We shall rise, not by dragging others down, but by encouraging those who are up to extend down to us the helping hand, which we must quickly grasp, and by its help lift ourselves up."
