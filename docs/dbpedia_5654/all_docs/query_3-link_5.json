        "text": "A film biography of lesser known, late 19th-century aviation pioneer John J. Montgomery, whose experiments with gliders brought him notoriety, but no money. He invents a gold separator, but the money he makes from that goes to fight patent-infringement lawsuits. He begins a relationship with a Jesuit, Blair, who helps him through hard times. Then he contracts vertigo, which prevents him from flying, and he dies. Wellman's lack-luster direction keeps the film from being a compelling drama."
