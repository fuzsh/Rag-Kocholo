In January 1886, then Lieutenant Wood was serving as an assistant surgeon stationed with the 4th Calvary at Fort Huachuca, Arizona Territory. During the final campaign against Geronimo in the summer of that year, his bravery, leadership and keen sense of purpose resulted in his award of the Medal of Honor. He voluntarily carried dispatches through a region infested with hostile Indians, making a journey of 70 miles in one night and walking 30 miles the next day. The latter part of the journey on foot was replete with harsh weather conditions and unforgiving terrain. Also, though a surgeon, he volunteered to lead a detachment of soldiers which was without an officer. For several weeks, Lieutenant Wood was in close pursuit of Geronimo’s band, constantly expecting an encounter."
