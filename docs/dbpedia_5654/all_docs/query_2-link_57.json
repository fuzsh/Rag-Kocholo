        "text": "A great deal of recent research has focused on the objecthood of the pre-modern book and its associated materiality. But only sporadic attempts have been made to understand the role of visual representations of the book in conveying ideas about knowledge. How can our understanding be transformed when the dictum that “a picture is worth a thousand words” is put into practice, when the how of depiction is accorded as much importance as the what of textual content? This symposium will examine the means by which the book, and in particular the manuscript, is described across a wide variety of media, from painting and sculpture to digital media and film. Topics to be addressed include the book as a symbol of authority, wisdom, or piety; the visual archeology of otherwise vanished bookbinding styles, reading practices, and study spaces; and the re-imagining of the physicality of the codex through digital means. The event will also mark the public launch at Penn Libraries of the Books as Symbols in Renaissance Art (BASIRA) project, an innovative, public-access web database of thousands of depictions of books in artwork produced between about 1300 and 1600 CE. The database, like the symposium itself, aims to engage historians of religion, literacy, art, music, language, and private life, as well as book artists, conservators, and interested members of the public. The symposium is organized in partnership with the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of Philadelphia (view on map).\n\nThe program will begin Thursday evening, November 16, 5:00 pm, at the Free Library of Philadelphia in the Rare Book Department, with a reception and keynote address by Jeffrey Hamburger, Kuno Francke Professor of German Art & Culture,Harvard University. The symposium will continue November 17-18 at the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts (view on map).\n\nThe symposium will be held in person with an option to join virtually. All are welcome to attend.

In this paper, I want to focus on the Zübdetü’t-tevarih (Quintessence of Histories), which is a universal history-cum-genealogy of the Ottoman house which was produced in three illustrated copies. All three culminate with a portrait of Murad III, seated and holding a red book in one hand, accompanied by attendants. No other rulers in the book are shown with a book, they have other attributes. The fact that Murad is the patron of the Zübdet is certainly one reason why he is singled out in this way, but the depiction is also part of a larger effort on the part of the ruler and his entourage to emphasize his learning and moral qualities as part of his public persona. The portrait is also a key to understanding the goals of the Zübdet project. This fascinating book is actually a translation into codex format of a sixteenth-century Ottoman genealogical scroll, an anomaly by any standard. By considering the choices that the book artists made in the transition, we will gain a deeper understanding of the codex as it existed in the imagination of Ottoman practitioners of the book arts, the broader idea or image of a book that the Zübdet embodies.\n\nThomas Rainer, University of Zurich\n\nSince antiquity, the codex format has been used in Christianity to differentiate the Christian Scriptures from Old Testament law and prophecy. The polemical juxtaposition of open Gospel codex and closed Torah scroll was a standard topos of Christian apologetics. This polemic is reflected in numerous images that paint a distorted picture of the complex relationship between codex and scroll in Jewish liturgy. In the pictorial juxtaposition of Christianity and Judaism, book formats have been used selectively to highlight differences, and images that incorporate realistic elements of Jewish liturgical practice in Christian art are rare and usually overlooked. In this paper, I examine such examples from the 14th to the 18th centuries and compare them to depictions of scrolls and codices in Jewish art of the same period. Starting with a group of late medieval French miniatures that feature realistic elements of synagogue architecture, I show how the different pictorial traditions for depicting scrolls and codices interacted in complex ways in processes of religious identity-building. The tension between the integration and the exclusion of pictorial elements from the other religious tradition is studied based on both Christian and Jewish examples. In both religions we find depictions of the codex as a medium through which to imagine religious identity and difference.\n\nDominique Stutzmann, Institut de Recherche et d’Histoire des Textes\n\nThis contribution presents an analysis of the iconographic motifs of scrolls, codices and inscriptions depicted in miniatures from books of hours. The primary focus is on examining a vast corpus of over 1,100 digitized books of hours, which together contain over 20,000 miniatures. The objectives of this study are twofold. First, to demonstrate that an artificial intelligence model, trained on a limited dataset, can proficiently detect not only miniatures in digitized images, but also representations of books within those miniatures. Second, to utilize a corpus of more than 6,000 images of books to explore their iconography and to take a transversal approach in examining the presence or absence of objects across diverse iconographies. In particular, we will analyze the context and depiction of the Virgin beyond the presence of “the Virgin Mary’s book at the Annunciation” (Miles 2020) as well as the representation of Evangelists and saints with a specific focus on the presence and form of the written Word. For the author portraits specifically, the research aims to investigate if books take part in “the number of ways of highlight[ing…] John’s preeminence as primus inter pares among the four Evangelists” (Hamburger 2002:49). By applying a scholarly approach and scrutinizing an extensive corpus of digitized materials, this analysis sheds new light on the iconographies found within miniatures in books of hours and addresses the presence of written artefacts both as iconographic attributes and as decorative elements.\n\nSabina Zonno, University of Southern California\n\nThis paper presents a digital humanities project developed at the University of Southern California by a multidisciplinary team who created a template that enables anyone to create fully immersive virtual reality experiences of Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. Wearing a relatively inexpensive VR headset, researchers, students, and general audiences find themselves immersed in a spatial and aural environment relevant to a selected manuscript, which is the focus of the experience. The virtual book is created with the combination of a 3-D model and parchment simulation that affords real-time page turning by the user. Anyone, anywhere, can access these experiences that make manuscripts – and even fragile manuscripts whose access is restricted by curation institutions – accessible globally. Also, people with no experience in handling manuscripts can engage with a virtual manuscript with no damage to the original. Because of the immersive character and high interaction level of virtual reality, which allows a sense of presence, people can interact with manuscripts, read their texts in the original language and in translations, and learn about past reading practices in spaces that may no longer exist or have drastically changed throughout the centuries, remembering these experiences viscerally. Virtual reality is a new tool that we can use to advance manuscript research, teaching, and outreach. But as scholars, how do we use this tool to describe manuscripts in virtual reality? How do we address the needs of different users including other scholars or non-specialists who will access these experiences of Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts? What are the advantages and limits of these virtual interactions with books? This paper will discuss the use of virtual reality to encourage engagement with and appreciation of tangible and intangible heritage contained in manuscripts and the potentials of virtual reality as an innovative tool for embodied learning and group-led teaching.\n\nDenva Gallant, Rice University\n\nThe book in the Middle Ages had an aura of authority that often superseded its contents, and its representation could offer symbolic value outside its function. The representation of the book in the late Middle Ages and its attendant and associative activity, reading, have prompted scholars to ask whether one can retrieve the social and personal habits of reading during the period through close looking at depictions of books and reading. Laurel Amtower, for instance, has argued that representations of reading in the late medieval Books of Hours drew attention to reading’s function as a mediator between the divine and profane worlds, while Jeffrey Hamburger has positioned depictions of reading within the so-called “cult of representation.” In this talk, I examine another dimension of depictions of books and reading in late medieval illuminated manuscripts: the ways representations of reading not only elaborated on the function of the book itself but also structured, organized and dictated the reader’s experience of the manuscripts. In particular, I look at representations of books and reading in passages from the Vitae patrum (The Lives of the Desert Fathers) and the vernacular translation, Le Vite de’ Santi Padri, which were recommended as reading for both monastics and the laity during the Middle Ages. When manuscripts of the Lives of the Desert Fathers are illuminated with inhabited and historiated initials, they not only mark the beginning of the lives (a guiding and reading device in itself) but also self-reflexively inform the way the text should be read. In analyzing depictions of books and reading in illustrated manuscripts of the Vitae patrum, I ask what representations of books in manuscripts might have taught their readers about how to read, and what they in turn can teach us about orality, listening, and reading in the late Middle Ages.\n\nJames Watts, Syracuse University\n\nThe image of the book, in all its various forms, has been a prominent feature of the art of literate cultures for 5,000 years. Books appear in portraits to cast their subjects as educated scholars. Specific books index the religious and intellectual allegiances of the people around them. Books appear in the hands of anonymous readers, often women, as idealized (“iconic”) depictions of reading, literature, education, and religion. In all these contexts, the image of the book serves to legitimize people, professions, ideas, and religions. Creation of the BASIRA database of books in Renaissance Art provides the opportunity to test such broad generalizations on an historically delimited and controlled database. This resource permits greater specificity in answering questions about how artists and their patrons used the image of books to depict themselves and their society, how their audiences (both literate and illiterate) were socialized to receive such images, and how such art may or may not reflect the actual use of books in mediating power relationships in Renaissance religion, society, and politics.\n\nLucy Freeman Sandler, New York University\n\nDestruction of books has a long history in which visual representation plays a significant role. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance images of book destruction, especially by burning, appeared in manuscript books themselves, as in turn did images of the saving, preservation, or miraculous rescue of books. After an introduction identifying the types of manuscripts in which such images appeared--the Moralized Bible, prayer books and breviaries, university and civil law texts, and national chronicles--this paper will focus on illustrations of book destruction and salvage inspired by biblical accounts in Jeremiah, Maccabees, Acts, and the Apocalypse, especially images accompanied by pictorial and/or textual expositions.\n\nAllie Alvis, Winterthur Library\n\nMedieval books are more than historical objects, they are potent – and elastic– symbols. Umberto Ecco’s Ten Little Middle Ages articulates the diversity of attitudes to and perceptions of the Medieval period, broadly defined. Megan L. Cook’s “Dirtbag Medievalism” hones this concept for the 21st century, describing an earnest, bombastic “kind of meta-medievalism, distilled through the internet and pop culture.” These frameworks speak to how shifting cultural values emphasize (and de-emphasize) parts of the Middle Ages to suit their goals, with books frequently being caught up in the mix, but rarely a focal point. Despite being relegated to supporting roles, the material forms of books specifically tell us a great deal not only about how non-medievalists conceptualize the period, but of how they understand book history in general.\n\nEnter Pop Bibliography. Many things can be gained through considering how books as physical objects are represented in pop culture, from the big screen to the art for trading card games such as Magic: The Gathering. The framework of Pop Bibliography takes into account Ecco’s concept of the dream of the Middle Ages, and Cook’s concept of the distillation of history through today’s constantly-churning media milieu, to reverse-engineer the popular concept(s) of the “Old Book” in Western pop culture. This talk will delve into the origins of some of the historical sources of these concepts, and address how they speak to the fetishization of the book as an object in the digital age. It will further address the role of “Old Books” in cultivating consumer identities, using case studies from popular media."
