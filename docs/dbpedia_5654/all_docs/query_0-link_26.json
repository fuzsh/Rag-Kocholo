        "text": "This tells of a certain class who were\n\nmembers of the DMT.\n\nMarch 1902\n\nDid you ever hear of the gallant D.M.Ts,\n\nThey are the most gallant set that you ever I did see.\n\nThey are all splendid fighters, shots, and riders too,\n\nFor none can join the D.M.T. unless an exam he’s gone through.\n\nThey are such stalwart fellows, they’re never sick at all,\n\nThey scorn to see a doctor, for anything so small\n\nAs coughs and colds, rhu[e]matics; fever or swollen eyes, (Mosquito bites)\n\nOr any other pain that’s caused, by anything you can surmise.\n\nThey are such goody fellows, they never ask for leave,\n\nThey never prowl the streets at night, or girls try to deceive.\n\nOh no, they live for glory, not seven and six a day.\n\nThey give their service gratis, and don’t won’t any pay.\n\nThey know more of music, than a donkey of the same;\n\nBut yet a donkey beats them, he has but little brain,\n\nBut they have none, and he has some, and he plays his natural strain,\n\nAnd they try to imitate him, but retire to whence they came.\n\nAnd as for being goody, why, they’ve done some dreadful things,\n\nTo hear of which would make you shake, and your hair stand up and singe.\n\nI’m sure they’l[l] never get to heaven, or any such like place,\n\nAnd the only other place for them, is H- with its disgrace.\n\nNow as to their great gallantry, I won’t screen that at all.\n\nThey are never ready; to fight, to stand or fall.\n\nBut here I make a great mistake, for to fall they’re always glad,\n\nBut it’s always behind a great big sack, them from which you cannot drag.\n\nJust look at their fight at Rooipoort, when they tackled the Boers so gay,\n\nThey happened to fall right on to the Boers, just at the break of day.\n\nWithin five hundred yards; never such a chance had they,\n\nThey fired about fifty shots and then, highed themselves away.\n\nFor at the very first shot, the Boers were up in arms\n\nFor they are always ready to answer war’s alarms\n\nThe galloped around and almost cut off the retreat of the D.M.T\n\nBut the D.M.T were mounted well and their backs let the wily Boers see.\n\nThey made a stand at Jonnespoort but the Boers were on their track\n\nThey hastly got dismounted till volleys came in with a whack\n\nAgain the Boers were on their flanks and almost cut off their last hope\n\nThe hastily mounted and galloping away hard never stopped till in Burghersdorp\n\nNow this is a sketch of the D.M.T very faithful I think you’ll see\n\nThey aren’t exactly soldiers and don’t intend to be\n\nThey’re only civil volunteers, who offered their service free\n\nSo when fighting starts, each says to himself, Burghersdorp’s the place for me.\n\nI shouldn’t be too hard on them, as father was in this fight\n\nand had his horse shot under him.\n\nW E"
