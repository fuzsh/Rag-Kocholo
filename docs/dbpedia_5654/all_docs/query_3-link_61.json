        "text": "For People and the Planet:\n\nTo lead the regenerative organic cotton movement in India, empowering farmers to earn more, lead healthier lives, combat climate change, and prevent farmer suicides. Our vision is for farmers to find joy and fulfillment in farming, reducing the need to abandon their land and migrate to cities. The scope of our work seeks to positively impact all people along the cotton supply chain, from farmers to factory workers to our partners.\n\nFourteen years of experience have taught us what it takes to make truly value-added products that have a positive impact on your business, the planet, and the entire supply chain, starting with farmers. This impact, in turn, influences the way your clients see you, and that is enriching for us all. Let’s make something good together.\n\nVikrant Giri (Vik) was born and raised in Pokhara, Nepal, and from a young age, he traveled extensively in India with his extended family. These journeys gave him first-hand insight into the harmful effects of conventional farming and the exploitation of laborers within supply chains. This unacceptable truth inspired Vik to start a purpose-driven company dedicated to making a positive impact on cotton farmers and workers across the entire supply chain. His mission includes championing the use of organic and regenerative organic cotton for the benefits it brings to both people and the planet. Vik believes that the best way to support his cutomers on their organic journey is by fostering direct relationships with farmers, offering full support and long-term commitment while prioritizing complete transparency and traceability, and providing measurable impact data.\n\nCERTIFIED BCORP\n\nWe became a Certified B Corporation® because we believe that businesses are capable of doing more social and environmental good in society.
