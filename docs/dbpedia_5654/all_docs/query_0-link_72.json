        "text": "Historical Significance:\n\nThe Hessian Barracks were erected by British and Hessian prisoners of war in 1777. The Hessian Barracks held prisoners from the Revolutionary War battles of Saratoga, Trenton, and Yorktown. Two historians of Frederick, Maryland, Lucy Leigh Bowie (in 1939) and J. Thomas Scharf (in 1882) maintained that the Hessian Barracks were built during the French and Indian War (1754-1763). The first principal (William D. Cooke) of the Maryland School for the Deaf currently located on the barracks grounds stated in his history of the institution that he was unable to date the barracks exactly, but stated \"It is known, however, that they were built during the reign of George II, and that they were occupied by General Braddock and his troops on their route to Fort Dusquene.\" The State of Maryland contracted to build \"a\" barracks in Frederick in the summer of 1777, but this structure was not completed in 1781. A letter from a British officer, a prisoner of war, to Governor Thomas Sim Lee, dated January 30, 1781, reveals the condition of the then-incomplete barracks, being at that time used as a prison.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, the barracks provided a mustering point for militia headed to Annapolis and other points along the Chesapeake Bay and Baltimore Harbor. The barracks also housed British prisoners of war.\n\nIn the 19th century the Barracks served several state and community needs, including a state armory and a silk worm production site, and the barracks yard served as the Agricultural Fairgrounds from 1853 to 1860. After the Battle of Antietam in 1862, the Barracks building served as a hospital for the wounded from both North and South. Every available space in Frederick from hotels to high schools, including the Barracks, was taken up for the estimated 4,000 wounded hospitalized there. The State of Maryland chose the Barracks grounds for the location of a new school, the Maryland Institution for the Deaf and Dumb (1867). Before the construction of the first building in 1871, the school met in the barracks. The Industrial Department of the Maryland Institution for the Deaf and Dumb continued to use the barracks for a few years after the construction of the 1871 school building. The school's Board of Directors authorized demolition of the western of the two original barracks buildings.\n\nHistoric Marker:"
