The early sets were offered in the student size with a 2-3/8″ King and a 1-3/16″ diameter base; and the Standard size with a 2-3/4″ King and a 1-5/16″ diameter base. The company moved from their original facilities at 147 Grand Avenue, Lake Villa, IL, to 228 West Kinzie Street, Chicago 10, IL, and added the small, Travel set No. 100(M) with a 2-1/8″ King having a 15/16″ diameter base; and a large Tournament set with a 4-7/8″ King and a 2-0″ diameter base. The sets were produced in a Mottled plastic as well as a Black or Red and ivory colored plastic. the Travel and Student sets were housed in simple cardboard boxes (No. 100, No. 35 and No. 36). The Standard sets were housed in cardboard boxes, hinged leatherette cases and a very attractive wooden chest (No. 75 and No. 76). The large Tournament set was housed in a hinge-top leatherette covered cardboard box."
