        "text": "Old growth woods, meadows, restored prairies and wetlands, and wetland woods characterize Gallant Woods Park. Wildlife sightings vary by habitat; look and listen for wood thrush and barred owls in the woodlands, Eastern bluebirds in the prairies, and chorus frogs, grey tree frogs, small mouth salamanders and fairy shrimp in the wetlands. Several of the wetlands have been restored by Preservation Parks, and these bodies of water attract shorebirds not otherwise seen in the area, including lesser and greater yellowlegs, and three types of sandpiper: solitary, least and spotted. The Interpretive Gateway introduces visitors to wetland habitats and describes the transition from farmland to restored native habitat.\n\nThe park also includes a sledding hill, reservable shelter and playground.\n\nGallant Woods Preserve was acquired because of the generosity of two Delaware County citizens. Charlotte Gallant donated 83 acres of woods to the Park District. An anonymous donor provided the funds to purchase 101 adjoining acres, and the Park District purchased an additional 47 acres of adjoining properties, bringing the total to 231 acres. The park opened to the public in 2005.\n\nNOTE: Leashed dogs are allowed on these trails, but you must clean up after your pets.\n\nGallant Woods Park History\n\nAcorn Trail/Gateway Trail (Gravel and Boardwalk)\n\nApproximate walking time: 15 minutes; little elevation change\n\nLeashed dogs are allowed on this trail.\n\nMeets guidelines for outdoor accessibility.\n\nAfter crossing through the Interpretive Gateway, visitors turn right on the short Gateway Trail and boardwalk to skirt a small wetland and view aquatic plants and wildlife that lives there. Then, the 0.4-mile graveled Acorn Trail loops through a wetland woods that is recovering from being pastured in the mid-1900s. Its trees are mainly maple, oak, ash, beech and hickory. Watch for signs of deer, rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, coyotes and foxes.\n\nYou might also catch glimpses of a barred owl, red-bellied woodpeckers and various songbirds. Wildflowers you’ll see along the trail include trilliums, wild violets and mayapples, depending on the season.\n\nPheasant Run Trail (Grass and Gravel)\n\nApproximate walking time: 35 minutes; little elevation change. NOTE: There is little shade along this trail\n\nLeashed dogs are allowed on this trail.\n\nThis 1.1-mile loop traverses the perimeter of a large meadow, which is gradually being converted to prairie. The east end of the trail extends through Walters’ Grove, a mature stand of trees. Along the trail, you might see foxes hunting for voles, or indigo buntings, ring-necked pheasants, hawks and meadowlarks.\n\nYou will see bluebird boxes and perhaps their inhabitants. You can view several recently reclaimed wetland and our reforestation efforts along sections of this trail.\n\nVisit the NEW Mindfulness Walk along the one-mile Pheasant Run Trail at Gallant Woods Park. Visitors encounter activities which prompt one to focus on the present moment and calmly acknowledge their thoughts and emotions. Revel the experiences of balancing stacked stones, exploring a labyrinth, focusing on specific senses, cultivating gratitude, and setting intentions for yourself and for the world. Practicing mindfulness is a healthy way to reduce stress and anxiety, which each of us carries. We hope the Mindfulness Walk will be a source of calm and peace for everyone who visits.\n\nTree-Frog Trail (Gravel Trail)\n\nApproximate walking time: 15 minutes\n\nLeashed dogs are allowed on this trail.\n\nMeets guidelines for outdoor accessibility.\n\nThis 0.3-mile path connects the Acorn and Pheasant Run Trails, extending through a woodland and former farm fields. You’ll see many of the same species as along the Pheasant Run Trail, and during the summer, you’ll see many varieties of butterflies and enjoy chirping crickets and grasshoppers.\n\nPrimitive Trail\n\nApproximate walking time: 35 minutes\n\nLeashed dogs are allowed on this trail.\n\nThis 1.3-mile dirt path winds along the western edge of Gallant Woods, and travels close to wetlands and vernal pools. There is little elevation change on this trail.\n\nFarm Connector Trail (Gravel Trail)\n\nApproximate walking time: 5 minutes\n\nLeashed dogs are allowed on this trail, but may not be brought across the street to Gallant Farm.\n\nThis 0.25-mile trail edges meadow, woodland and prairie, and extends to the road, where it crosses to provide a pedestrian connection to Gallant Farm."
