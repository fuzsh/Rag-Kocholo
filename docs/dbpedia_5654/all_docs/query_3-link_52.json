        "text": "Biography\n\nAmerica’s second Triple Crown winner, Gallant Fox set a single-season earnings record in 1930 that stood for 16 years and had the highest career purse earnings at the time of his retirement.\n\nBred and owned by William Woodward, Sr., Gallant Fox was a son of French-bred stallion Sir Gallahad III and foaled at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky. Big and ungainly as a 2-year-old, Gallant Fox flashed some potential in winning the Flash Stakes and Cowdin Stakes, coaxing Hall of Fame jockey Earl Sande to come out of retirement to ride the “Fox of Belair” during his 3-year-old season of 1930.\n\nTrained by Hall of Famer James E. “Sunny Jim” Fitzsimmons, Gallant Fox won the Wood Memorial by four lengths, took the Preakness Stakes and Kentucky Derby in that order, and then annexed the Triple Crown with a three-length victory in the Belmont Stakes. Gallant Fox went on to win the Dwyer Stakes and Arlington Classic before a shocking defeat in the Travers, as 100-1 shot Jim Dandy won on a muddy track at Saratoga.\n\nGallant Fox shrugged off the Travers loss and rebounded to win the Saratoga Cup at 1¾ miles, the Lawrence Realization at 1⅝ miles, and the Jockey Club Gold Cup at two miles. With a record of 9-1-0 from 10 starts, Gallant Fox became the first horse to surpass $300,000 in earnings in a year. He was retired after his Jockey Club Gold Cup victory with a career record of 11-3-2 from 17 starts and record lifetime earnings of $328,165.\n\nAs a stallion, Gallant Fox sired 1935 Triple Crown winner Omaha, 1936 Horse of the Year Granville, and Ascot Gold Cup winner Flares. Both Omaha and Granville later joined their sire in the Hall of Fame.\n\nGallant Fox died on Nov. 13, 1954, at Claiborne Farm at the age of 27.\n\nAchievements\n\nHorse of the Year — 1930\n\nChampion 3-Year-Old Male— 1930\n\nTriple Crown Highlights\n\nWon the Preakness Stakes — 1930\n\nWon the Kentucky Derby — 1930\n\nWon the Belmont Stakes — 1930"
