CONNECTING, COACHING, and COUNSELING Veterans to hopeful and purposeful lives.

Our Process

The GallantFew STAR (Self Training And Response-ability) Program supports the main areas of transition from military service to civilian life: Emotional, Spiritual, Physical, Professional, and Social.

Emotional: A personal growth mindset with a sound emotional state.

Physical: Healthy and fit lifestyle.

Spiritual: A life of purpose and direction.

Professional: A successful career, education, and financial growth.

Social: Integration and leadership in civilian communities.
