        "text": "The E-4 Voice Tweaker is an outrageously jammable box of fun that harmonizes, auto-pitches, vocodes, loops, and glitches your voice and anything else you feed it. Flip through hands-on controls to manipulate the sound, and chain in AIRA Compacts and other electronic instruments and let them ride in perfect sync.\n\nStandard Features\n\nInspiring Roland vocal processing.\n\nThe E-4 combines powerful voice transformer tools and standard vocal effects with a tactile interface that’s meant to be played. This lean, mean machine puts a treasure trove of top-quality processing in a go-everywhere gadget that’s endlessly enjoyable and amazingly affordable.\n\nPerform with sound.\n\nBy working the E-4’s inviting panel, you can go from traditional vocal enhancements to punchy beatboxed grooves to striking alien soundscapes—all in a single performance. Select different sonic shapers, trigger looper controls, cycle through Scatter effects, and tweak pitch, formant, and more in the flow.\n\nHarmonic explorer.\n\nTake your singing to the next level with automatic harmony effects. Set the key and chord voicing on the fly and bring head-turning flair to any song. And with Auto Pitch, you can dial in everything from subtle tuning fixes to the hard-tuned sounds heard in mainstream pop tracks.\n\nLoop and Scatter.\n\nTurn one voice into an entire orchestra using the 24-second looper. Overdub layer after layer with the E-4's effects to create wild, vocal-driven rides. Then slice and dice with the expressive Scatter knob, which chops your sound into colorful bits that you control with a twist.\n\nChannel your inner robot.\n\nUse direct-access tools to instantly change your vocal gender, conjure sounds from outer space, or transform yourself into a mechanical persona (good or evil is up to you). There’s also a powerful vocoder, which you can drive from a large pool of onboard synth waveforms, the E-4’s pitch functions, or an external MIDI keyboard for an endless variety of textures.\n\nLink up and go.\n\nConnect a handheld mic to the front input for performing, or use a gaming headset or the inline mic on your earbuds to bring fresh vocal fun to your next livestream or podcast. Sync with other AIRA Compacts like the T-8 Beat Machine and J-6 Chord Synthesizer to expand your range. Or interface with computer DAWS, mobile music apps, and hardware instruments via USB-C or MIDI.\n\nEverywhere at once.\n\nThe E-4 creatively accentuates vocals anytime and anywhere. The lithium-ion battery provides up to 3.5 hours of power per charge, and the rugged Roland build will support inspired magic and mayhem for a long, long time.\n\nAIRA COMPACT\n\nMeet the gang\n\nT-8\n\nBeat Machine\n\nCreate infectious tracks in seconds flat with a miniature rhythm factory powered by pristine TR drums plus bass from the inimitable TB-303.\n\nINFO\n\nJ-6\n\nChord Synth\n\nPairing a powerful chord sequencer with the lavish tones of the legendary JUNO-60, this portable synth toolbox has the building blocks you need to bring harmonic substance to your jams.\n\nINFO\n\nS-1\n\nTweak Synth\n\nDivine a new world of sonic textures with a potent micro polysynth and sound design playground inspired by the legendary SH-101.\n\nINFO\n\nStandard Features\n\nVocal performance tool with powerful voice transformer effects\n\nInstantly shape the sound with pitch and formant sliders\n\nAdvanced vocal effects including Auto Pitch, harmony, and vocoder\n\nDial up unique rhythmic effects with the Scatter knob\n\nProcess the sound output with high-quality reverb, echo, tempo delay, and chorus effects\n\nLow-cut filter and noise gate to eliminate unwanted sounds\n\n24-second looper with unlimited overdubbing, undo/redo, and automatic BPM detection\n\nSupports external MIDI control of pitch, harmony, and vocoder functions\n\n¼-inch mic input with wide-ranging gain control\n\nHeadphones output with support for an inline mic\n\nComprehensive connectivity with audio, MIDI, and sync I/O plus AIRA Link\n\nClass-compliant USB-C audio/MIDI interface—no drivers needed\n\nLithium-ion battery with up to 3.5 hours of operation per charge\n\nSturdy construction and robust controls\n\nConnect to other AIRA Compacts and standard MIDI devices with optional BOSS TRS MIDI cables\n\nSpecifications\n\nEffect Type\n\nAUTO PITCH\n\nHARMONY\n\nVOCODER\n\nPITCH\n\nFORMANT\n\nSCATTER\n\nREVERB\n\nDELAY\n\nECHO\n\nCHORUS\n\nLOOPER\n\nMaximum Recording Time\n\nApproximately 24 seconds\n\nDisplay\n\n7 segments, 4 characters (LED)\n\nConnectors\n\nSYNC (IN, OUT) jacks: Miniature phone type\n\nMIX (IN, OUT) / HEADSET jacks: Stereo miniature phone type (Stereo, CTIA)\n\nMIDI (IN, OUT) jacks: Stereo miniature phone type\n\nMIC IN jack: Stereo phone type\n\nUSB port: USB Type-C® (Audio, MIDI)\n\nPower Supply\n\nRechargeable lithium-ion battery\n\nObtained via USB port (USB bus power)\n\nCurrent Draw\n\n500 mA\n\nExpected battery life under continuous use\n\nApprox. 3.5 hours\n\n* These figures will vary depending on the actual conditions of use.\n\nExpected battery charging time\n\nApprox. 3 hours\n\n* To charge the unit, use the USB port of a computer or a commercially available USB power supply adaptor (5 V, 500 mA or higher).\n\nAccessories\n\nLeaflet ”Read Me First”\n\nUSB Type-C to USB Type-A cable\n\nSize and Weight\n\nWidth\n\n188 mm\n\n7-7/16 inches\n\nDepth\n\n106.5 mm\n\n4-1/4 inches\n\nHeight\n\n41.7 mm\n\n1-11/16 inches\n\nWeight (including batteries)\n\n290 g\n\n11 oz\n\n<% for (var i=0,len=images.length; i <% } %>\n\nVideo Library\n\nAIRA Compact Overview\n\nFun, go-everywhere instruments that put Roland’s legendary creative magic in the palm of your hand.\n\nGetting to Know AIRA Compact: An Introduction\n\nThe AIRA Compact line is Roland’s most portable to date.
