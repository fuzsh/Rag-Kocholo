        "text": "THE GENTLEMAN'S GENTLEMAN\n\nSpy story set in 1927. An English valet is actually a spy for His Majesty's government. He must try to stop a Nazi plot to damage the English war machine before the next upcoming conflict. ABOUT THE DESIGN: 1. Title in Britannic Bold 2. Silhouette of main character: slim, slightly short English gentlemen with bowler. 3. Holding an umbrella, or perhaps an umbrella with the handle pulled out a little bit to reveal a sword blade. 4. Elements: Airplane and city map\n\nA ME WITHOUT WE\n\nThe book is a grief support book. it is based on my life with my twin sister. she died of cancer. I show others in this book how to find yourself again and get busy living. ABOUT THE DESIGN: The idea shows 2 Twin Birds, one flying away and the other left alone.\n\nHEART HALF BLACK\n\nAfter body parts wash ashore in a tranquil Florida beach town, investigators quickly identify the killer, Kenneth Lamont Duncan. However, he won’t talk to anyone but Detective Becker Gray. Duncan’s demand seems bizarre. It’s been seven years since the two men spoke or were even in the same room together. And Gray hardly even remembers the specifics of that encounter. But Duncan knows how to get what he wants. “I can help him find what he’s searching for.” What is Gray searching for? And what does it have to do with Duncan? In the fourth installment of the Becker Gray series, the detective’s interview with Duncan winds through the killer’s seemingly tenuous grip on reality. Truth morphs into lies. Clarity fogs. And the men’s differences become their commonality. All part of Duncan’s plan: manipulation of the information, the promise Gray pledges, and even the bloody ending.\n\nBook cover for “Ricigliano” by Nick Pintozzi\n\nThis novel is the sequel to “Remember Love’s Smile”, whose book cover I had previously designed. The story is about the intriguing influence that a small town in southwestern Italy has on four vacationing Americans. My starting point was the map of Italy, used as a background where all the other “objects” are placed. The most challenging part of this decision was determining where each detail should appear, to keep the three most important locations visible: Venice, Rome and Ricigliano. The idea of the little pin flags to mark them made the design more real, but also clearer. In addition to an image where the four characters are presented on a canvas, one of the requirements was to include the painting of “Fumo”, a Lucanian goat. In order to accurately represent this unique character, I did research on this specific breed. The main image on the back is a detail of a real painting created by Anne Marie Cina, who granted permission to the author to include it on the cover.\n\nBook cover for “A Place for Grayson” by Kaitlin Kalagher\n\nThis book is about Grayson, a young adult that struggles with drug addiction and his girlfriend, Emily, a recovering alcoholic. Emily takes her sobriety very seriously, while Grayson has not been able to make that commitment yet. Instead of showing the characters, I decided to go for a more symbolic approach, in order to make it different from the common romance books. I used the contrast between cold and warm tones to transmit the concept of “choices” that the characters need to make in their lives. In this design the blue tones represent the sad and numb life of addiction, the struggles and the dramatic consequences… and the yellow/orange tones represent the recovery and the achievement of finally become sober. Grayson is still struggling in a “cold life”, while Emily has already overcome her battle. The orange flower is Emily that blossoms from branches that seem to be almost dry. While Grayson is still the cold reflex in the water of what can become his future.\n\nBook cover for “Night Briars” by Taryn Tyler\n\nThis design was a layout proposal and was never published. Based off of Grimm’s fairy tales, this is a romance between two women that explores the nuances of what happens after “Happily ever after”. Their names — Rose and Snow — allowed not only to give a symbolic representation of the characters, but also to show the contrasts of what unfolds during the story. As the plot begins with the arrival of an invitation to the King’s wedding, followed by the court life and the castle’s secrets, this building took also an important place in the entire design. Since the client wanted the cover to embody dark romance reminiscent of a gothic novel, I decided to use a very dark palette, with high contrasts and grainy textures. This graphic style, and also the only color (Red) present in the design, helped to highlight even more the main element: the rose with the snow.\n\nUnreal Frontier\n\nTyrian purple is somewhat of a theme for this other world. The sky is purple and the ground has hues of purple. There is a scene in the book where the protagonist returns to this other reality and sits beneath a dead tree in the desert and reads a journal from a madman. I'd like to capture this scene but keep it silhouetted with large contrast between the scene and the environment. A distant farmhouse could be added as well. It's not from that scene, but has quite a large significance in this other world.\n\nBook cover for “The House Sitter” by Jeanie Green\n\nThis design was made for a fictional drama/romance which story, filled with family dynamics, is set in an equestrian property in Australia. The main requests from the author were a design with an air of luxury (with details in gold) and the picture of her own mare Anastasia — “I want it to stand out in an almost 3D effect”. Therefore, I decided to place the image of the horse in a very large scale and also with an effect where it seems to get out of the page. Its body extends to the back cover, giving a deep dark contrast to the entire design. This creates a very dramatic appearance but also a sophisticated style, helped by the warm golden tones on the background and on the title. Then, I made a line drawing of the house, from the picture that the client had provided of the property in which the story takes place, and I included it on the title... almost as if it were part of its “Logo”.\n\nBook cover for “Inte som du tror” by Anna Karlsson\n\nInte som du tror (translated from Swedish \"Not as you think\") is a story that mainly takes place in a school, about two girls with ages around 13 years old. It talks about how the two girls deal with each other and how their attitudes may hide more severe and private problems. One of the important details of the story is the finding of an old diary written in the 19th century by a girl of the same age. This diary inspires one the girls to start reading the Bible and pray to God for the other one. That is why I placed one of the main characters as a central point of the cover, holding an old book, while the other girl is seen on the top almost hidden in the middle of her long blonde hair. As the target group for this book will be teens but also adults, the author didn’t want it to signal teen’s fiction too much.\n\nBook cover for “Die zehn Vorteile des Schleiers” by Iben Martell\n\n“Die zehn Vorteile des Schleiers”, translated from German as “The ten Advantages of the Veil”, is a collection of seven short stories in the erotica genre telling the adventures of different people, in different countries. The client requested a design that could reflect the book title with a female face partly covered by a veil, where the eyes, looking straight at the viewer, would become the central point of attention. The simple typography chosen and the warm red color also helped to create the atmosphere that was intended, making even a better connection with the book genre. The golden tone given to some texts also added a detail of sophistication to the entire book cover, as well as they helped to alternate the paragraphs that describe each story in the back cover. As this is the first book in a series, the design was also thought having in mind a consistent graphic line throughout all the future books.\n\nBook covers for “Wicked Game Series” (Books 1 and 2) by Michelle St. James\n\nFor the first time after several series, the author decided to have a female model as the main subject of the design instead of a man. Despite her target audience being usually attracted by models of the opposite sex, as the story is developed around a strong woman, it made sense to make her the focal point. The request was to represent her as a sophisticated and powerful character, but that could also transmit a sense of sensuality, which is one of the more important aspects of this author’s books. The draped fabrics on the photos, as well as the particular blue tone that was chosen, helped to achieve the requested style, as well as to keep a consistency in all the books of this series.\n\nBook cover for “Rummet innanför” by Anna Karlsson\n\n“Rummet innanför” (translated from Swedish \"The room inside\") is the sequel of “Inte som du tror”, which book cover I had previously designed. Some events and details on the story led to the choice of the elements in the design. The main characters — Bella, Miranda and Erik — are on summer holiday. Bella is searching for answers about her family's history, after finding a revealing picture. Miranda is haunted by memories from a fire at her school. Erik is working at a soccer school for kids. As requested, the main scenario needed to also include a mansion, as well as a sports car. As in many books which target audience are teens, it was important to give some clues but without revealing too much of the plot. I followed the same style of the first book, as well as the placement of the characters and background effects. However, to better distinguish both books, I used a different color scheme with fresh tones to make the connection with summer season.\n\nBook cover for “Oliver and Eleanor” by Vasyl Malyi\n\nThis is a novel-drama which main characters are two musicians. Following the story, my approach was to transmit all the main aspects in a symbolic way, giving the right amount of clues, but without revealing too much of the plot. The subtitle “Only one season for Love” was the starting point. By including the two characters in a field full of flowers, I’m representing that idea of the “season”, the only season that they will have. The dark sky, full of heavy clouds, shows that this isn’t a happy and light story. The placement of the characters in the design transmits the distance between them that is revealed throughout the story. I’ve placed the pianist near a tree, because this element is a symbol of “rebirth”, of restarting a new life… a new opportunity.\n\nThe White\n\n\"The White\" is about three people who die on the same day at the same time. They are taken to a 'world' where they are surrounded by nothing but white. Together they realize they've died, and they figure out how to create a space around them; with their minds. The three receive a message that they have to lead a group of hundreds of people who will soon join them in the white.\n\nBook cover for \"Once Upon a Time\" by Alyson Manes\n\nThis is a Christian romantic fiction (Amish novel) about a coming of age story — two Amish children and their path until the adult life. Apart from the inclusion of the two children (in typical Amish clothes) and a wishing well as the central elements, another of the requests from the client was to have a book cover more “dreamy or artistic” than with a plain photograph. Therefore, I decided to make a design more similar to a painting. The lavender field helped to create this effect, but also gave a very smooth and pleasant color scheme… almost naive.\n\nspider\n\ni'm maybe don't have a time to join your contest. but i always have time for 1 to 1 project. let's make 1 to 1 project with me. discuss the negotiable price with fast response and high quality design. and one thing, please don't invite me for your logo contest. can you see? i am an illustrator not designer! please\n\nBook cover for \"Shear Deception\" by Rhonda Blackhurst\n\nBook 2 of the \"Melanie Hogan Mysteries Series\", which stories always take place within the environment of an hair salon. The main character, that owns the space, is the suspect in the shooting of the nail technician that works there. The author didn't want anything bloody or gory, but a bit mysterious. Since the story takes place in the Minnesota in the early springtime, another request was to incorporate a fresh color scheme, where some light snow could still be seen on the forest floor. This also helped to differentiate this second book from the other ones in the same series.\n\nBook covers for “Here” and “There” by D.G.Swank\n\nThese designs were a layout proposal and have never been published. They were created for a YA dystopian romance set in parallel universes. The author wanted to have that sense of duality represented in the design, but in a way that it would be completely clear that the first book was set in our current universe, and the second one in a dystopian universe at the same place. As one of the details from this dystopian universe was that all trees were dead, I used the image of two massive trees as the main focal point. They helped to represent the differences between those two worlds, also intensified by the different color schemes. The poses of the girl (main character in the story) also reinforce the titles of each book: a static pose for “Here” and a moving/running pose for “There”.\n\nBook cover for \"Shear Malice\" by Rhonda Blackhurst\n\nBook 3 of the \"Melanie Hogan Mysteries Series\", which stories always take place within the environment of an hair salon. This is a mysterious story that takes place in the fall. So, one of the requests from the author was to include the colors of that season. In this book the main character is moving her best friend into a house next to her own, when they stumble across three gravestones in a hidden area in the back of the shed. This discovery will uncover a shocking family secret. Another request from the author was to include some hairdresser instruments on the back cover (as in all the books of this series) to make the connection with the main theme.\n\nBook cover for “Spent Identity” by Marlene M. Bell\n\nThis is the second book of the Annalisse Series, a romantic mystery novel. The design was created following the original vision of the author that already had in mind the inclusion of very specific elements. The main objective was to lean more on the “mystery” side of the story, which revolves around a murder and disappearance. Therefore, instead of showing the main characters, the design presents some objects that have an important role or that give some clues about the development of the plot. The roses were one of the details that required a special attention. They couldn’t be too bright or too perfect. So, I made them all different: from the one that is still bright and fresh, to the other that opens its petals, and all the others that start to wilt and die… exactly like the several stages of a life.\n\nBook cover for \"The Mouth of the Gods\" by William Stacey\n\nDesign for book 3 of the Vampire Queen Saga, a mature dark fantasy novel. The design shows one of the scenes of the story, when the main character finds a chest in a tower containing the Vampire Queen's heart... but then a spider as large as a dog attacks. The details that I added to the wooden chest, not only help to place the story within medieval times, but they also give a strange and mysterious appearance to this unique piece, as it had been requested by the author. All the book covers of this series are substantially different but they all have the same strange and menacing atmosphere.\n\nBook cover for “Giants of Iniquity” by Jason Covington\n\nThis design was a layout proposal and was never published. It was created for a cautionary tale about what America is becoming. This science fiction book is a sort of metaphor for what is happening in our society, bringing the excitement and intrigue of paranormal and spiritual discovery, together with a supernatural battle between spiritual forces in an age of advanced technology and cultural shifting. As it is set in San Francisco, the client required a clear skyline of the buildings of the city, from which a giant violet construction stands out, not only by its size but also by the different appearance and materials. The major challenge was precisely to represent that giant building in a way that could show its different nature, following the descriptions on the book — “some kind of magnetic force field, not glass or steel”.\n\nBook cover for “The Soul Snatchers” by Richard Sanford\n\nThis design was created for a science fiction novel, set about a dozen years in the future. The diagonal form of the buildings gives a great depth to the cover, also helped by the running man and the strong light at the end of the street. This contrast between zones of light and shadow was made to create impact and transmit a sense of mystery. Since the story has to do with the malicious, mesmerizing effect of a presence on social media, the author wanted to include some kind of electronic device (mobile, tablet or computer). However, I also added some details as a watermark, like the circular grid with the zero and one numerals, in order to have a certain \"technological atmosphere\". Another of the requests was to create the design with a blue/gray palette with gold highlights, since this is a color combination that can attract the public of this book genre.\n\nBook Cover for “Fairest” by Sophia Zaccaria\n\nThis book cover was created for a dark fantasy novel — a retelling of the Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs, with the Evil Queen as the protagonist. The request from the author was to include several elements representing the story (the main character, a broken mirror and an apple) but always having the “Gothic style” in mind. This is usually made by creating a darker design, with high contrasts and a “mysterious atmosphere”, almost dramatic. Therefore, I made the entire cover with a grey color scheme, even if that grey has some soft tones (like a light purple or silver). This also gave the possibility to highlight small details, by being the only spots with a strong color, like the drop of blood in the main title and also the apple. The font I chose for the title is quite suitable for the dark fantasy genre and its “pointed corners” helped to match the model’s long nails. It gives a mixture of a sophisticated and dramatic feeling, showing that this is not exactly a “sweet romance”.\n\nBook cover for \"Cradles Will Fall\" by Danny Moriarty\n\nDark thriller based on the abduction of a young girl from a playground in Boston and the subsequent manhunt by the FBI and the girl's mother. One of the requests from the author was to have a dark deep cover with strong colors, but also quite simple. In my design I played with the contrast between the innocence of the child and her teddy bear, with the heavy and stormy clouds that transmit a very dramatic feeling.\n\nBook cover for “44 – Becoming Self” by Ania K\n\nThis book cover was designed for a spiritual fiction. The author had already in mind a specific scene described in the first chapter. To follow the writing, the angel needed to have an etheric appearance, while the little girl had to be seen as being “more real”. Although there were already some references regarding the appearance of the characters, I had some freedom to “create” them in a way that could be interesting for the viewers, adding some details. The atmosphere that surrounds them was also a very important aspect of the entire design, with the sunlight that comes through the trees. The mist was already part of the image chosen for the background, but the colors and contrasts had to be completely changed in order to make the whole imagery balanced and believable. One of the other details requested by the author was to give a big impact to the main title “44”. The effects and colors helped to make it stand out and, at the same time, to match the rest of the design.\n\nBook cover for \"The Shield of Serl Raven-Eye\" by William Stacey\n\nDesign for book 2 of the Vampire Queen Saga, a mature dark fantasy novel that revolves around the search for a viking-style shield, with a raven's head painted on it. I designed a stylized raven to incorporate in the main zone of the shield, very much in the style of the ancient heraldic and tribal symbols. The main challenge was to have the eye right at the center, making it almost “alive”. This also helped to represent the shield as something special and unique. The other request of the author was to have a nautical feel, as most of the book takes place at sea or in port.\n\nBook cover for a novel Red and Green: Oil on Water\n\nFrom the brief: I would like the cover to have an 'Indian feel' to it. novel is high-brow. A book is a postcolonial novel set in Bangladesh and Britain. It is a history of a nation that is trying to find itself, in the midst of violence, sexual intrigue, and identity crises.\n\nBook cover for “Murphy’s Law” by Michelle St. James\n\nThe book’s main character is a vigilante-for-hire who runs a high end mercenary organization, headquartered in Boston. As this is the first book of a set of several new series, the author requested a slight different approach, in relation to what had already been done on the previous books, as long as it would fit her already very well known brand. When I made the research of the publishing design trends within this genre I noticed that, whenever there's a cover with an image in a big scale, it stands out from the others in an incredible way, specially when they have a face looking at the viewer. I immediately remembered how the eyes of the models (and a particular gaze) is one of the details that identify so many of this author’s books — the direct look at the reader, that catches the attention and also seduces, is almost her trademark.\n\nBook cover for \"Finding Abby\" by Rhonda Blackhurst\n\nA romantic suspense set in the Colorado Mountains, about a woman who is searching for herself in life. Running away from a violent ex-husband, this single mom takes refuge in a idyllic resort that she inherits from a friend. A sunset with a porch in front of a lake, with Rocky Mountains in the background, were some of the details required by the author to include on the book cover. The sunset colors also helped to give the desired impact, fundamental to catch the attention of the viewers.\n\nBook cover design for novel One Thousand Days In The Sun\n\nTask from the brief: Female protagonist should be a lithe young woman with African features and a palpable femininity. The reader must sense her's incredibly feminine, almost feral pull just from the image. The male protagonist need not be imaged, although his shadow, virtual or montage, may hover in the background.\n\neBook Cover for “Pashmina & Razzia” by Iben Martell\n\nThis design was created for a short eBook by Iben Martell with two novels in the erotica genre. As it belongs to the same collection of the first book “Die zehn Vorteile des Schleiers” (The ten Advantages of the Veil), it was important to keep a consistent graphic line. Therefore, it was used the same concept of a face partly covered, where the glance at the viewer becomes the central point of attention. This concept helps to transmit a certain audacity and sensuality, but it is also a mysterious approach by not revealing the main plot of the stories. The image used was chosen by the author, following the location of one of the novels, set in Central Asia. However, it was completely modified in order to achieve the same dark atmosphere of the first book, as well as a similar color scheme. The fonts and the golden tones of the typography are a detail of sophistication that had already been applied in the design of the first book cover.\n\nBook cover for “Remember Love’s Smile” by Nick Pintozzi\n\nThis romantic comedy novel is meant to be fun, but it’s also a plea to keep family memories alive for future generations. It is set in two different times: Chicago in the 1950s and Arizona in 2019. The starting point of the design was the desert painting. In fact, I did it in a way that simulates the technic and texture of the paint and, to make it more real, I also added some brushes on the side, as if they were placed on the book itself. As the artistic theme is a central point of the story, I gathered in this painting several “key details” that are quite important to the plot. The elements at the top of the cover make reference to Italian food, one of the “unexpected” and funny aspects in the story. The Chicago painting is presented as a symbolic representation of the past: the old photograph that brings the memories of the 1950s. It is a detail of a real painting created by Anne Marie Cina, who granted permission to the author to include it on the back cover.\n\nGenerative glitch art for psychological thriller\n\nA woman loved a man to obsession. He left her for another. When he is discovered dead in the woods behind her home, she becomes the prime suspect. Yet she would never hurt him, or anything. You have to believe her. Using Processing app, I created this arresting glitch art image of a woman. First, I wanted to give reference to the psychological state of obsession. But what I really want to do is to create a question mark as to whether this is a depiction of an inner state of psychopathy, or is how others came to view her, as she protests innocence, despite her proximity to a murder."
