        "text": "Goodbye, summer. Hello, fall!\n\nIf you thought summer was the best season for thrillers and mysteries, you’re in for a surprise when you see the full lineup of titles set to come out between mid-September and early December. Spoiler: There are a ton of great books set to be released.\n\nBecause this is our first major Reading Guide since the release of my own book, Lethal Range, back in August, I just want to offer my sincere thanks to everyone who took the time to grab a cop, read it, and leave a review on Amazon and/or Goodreads. It means a lot to me, and I am thrilled to see so many Book Spy followers embracing me as an author. So, thank you. I’m happy to report that, among the many titles featured below, one of them is my new, forthcoming novella, Redd Christmas, an e-book exclusive that serves as a prequel to my first two books, going back in time to show Matthew Redd as a young Marine, chronicling how he becomes the hardened, battle-tested operator we meet when the action kicks off in Fields of Fire. I’m really proud of the novella, and if you’re looking for any additional reasons to consider pre-ordering it, well, at the end of the story, there’s an excerpt for my third novel, Out For Blood, available in hardcover, e-book, and audiobook on June 4th, 2024. Enjoy!\n\nFrom John Grisham to Michael Connelly to Stephen King and many, many more . . . browse every title set to come out his fall below, then make sure to leave us a comment or tag us on social media to let us know which books you’re most excited to get your hands on.\n\nHappy Reading!\n\nFeatured Selections\n\nRedd Christmas by Ryan Steck (From The Real Book Spy)\n\nRelease Date: November 7th\n\nFrom The Real Book Spy Ryan Steck comes an exciting novella that goes back in time to show how Matthew Redd becomes the hardened, battle-tested operator that readers meet in Fields of Fire\n\nI remember that promise to J. B. like it was yesterday.\n\nAfter losing his mom at age ten, Matthew Redd found a new home in Montana with J. B. Thompson—a man who knew the value of hard work and simple living. J. B. didn’t have much reason to celebrate Christmas before becoming Redd’s dad but threw himself into building traditions, including a tree, a few practical gifts, and the essential holiday movies: A Christmas Story and Die Hard.\n\nEight years later, Redd realizes this is the last Christmas he’ll spend at the ranch with his dad before heading off to join the Marines. He impulsively promises J. B. that even if they can’t be together on Christmas Eve, he’ll call every year without fail.\n\nIt’s a promise Redd keeps until the year his squadron is called in to assist when a nearby Special Forces team comes under enemy fire. The Marines’ mission is to secure the scene and evacuate the wounded, but soon after their arrival, they realize the initial attack was only the first wave. Before long, Redd and his team are outmanned and outgunned. With the clock ticking down, he begins to wonder if this is the year he’ll have to break his promise . . . or if he’ll make it out alive.\n\nA Christmas story for men who love military thrillers\n\nContemporary Christmas novella\n\nPrequel to full-length novels Fields of Fire & Lethal Range\n\nORDER NOW\n\nHercule Poirot’s Silent Night by Sophie Hannah\n\nRelease Date: October 24th\n\nThe world’s greatest detective, Hercule Poirot—legendary star of Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile—puts his little grey cells to work solving a baffling Christmas mystery.\n\nIt’s December 19, 1931. Hercule Poirot and Inspector Edward Catchpool are looking forward to a much-needed, restful Christmas holiday, when they are called upon to investigate the murder of a man in a Norfolk hospital ward. Cynthia Catchpool, Edward’s mother, insists that Poirot stay with her in a crumbling mansion by the coast, so that they can all be together for the festive period while he solves the case.\n\nAs Poirot digs into the mystery, he discovers that the murdered man was a retired post office master, and by all accounts very well-liked. The local constabulary’s investigation failed to uncover how someone could have entered a hospital room and killed him under the noses of the staff. Cynthia’s friend Arnold is soon to be admitted to that same hospital, and his wife is convinced he will be the killer’s next victim, though she refuses to explain why.\n\nWith no obvious motive or suspect, Poirot has less than a week to solve the crime and prevent more murders, if he is to escape from this nightmare scenario and get home in time for Christmas. Meanwhile, someone else—someone utterly ruthless—also has ideas about what ought to happen to Hercule Poirot.\n\nORDER NOW\n\nCode Red by Kyle Mills\n\nRelease Date: September 12th\n\nMitch Rapp returns to make a mortal enemy of Russia in this high-octane and up-to-the-minute installment in the #1 New York Times bestselling series from “one of the best thriller writers on the planet” (The Real Book Spy).\n\nMitch Rapp hates owing anyone a favor—especially when it’s the world’s most powerful crime lord. But when Damian Losa calls, Mitch is honor-bound to answer.\n\nThe Syrian government appears to have created a highly addictive new narcotic that it plans to distribute throughout Europe. It’s a major threat to Losa’s business and he’s determined to send someone to keep him on top by any means necessary.\n\nRapp is the perfect choice for the mission. Not only does he have extensive experience operating in the Middle East, but he’s also entirely expendable.\n\nAs he crosses into war-torn Syria, Rapp quickly discovers a shocking truth. The new drug isn’t being produced by Damascus to prop up the government’s collapsing finances.

Now, in Berlin, they are reunited and tasked with investigating the murder of one of their own: CID Special Agent Harry Vance of the 5th MP Battalion, an accomplished counterterrorism agent who had been stationed in western Germany, and whose body was discovered in a city park in the heart of Berlin’s Arab refugee community.\n\nThe authorities suspect this is an act of Islamic terrorism, but Brodie and Taylor soon believe there is more to this case. The reason for Vance’s presence in Berlin is unknown, and as Brodie and Taylor work to discover what the murder victim was doing in the days and weeks preceding his death, they become immersed in the many conflicts and contradictions of modern Germany—the Arab refugee crisis, the dark legacy of the Cold War and the Stasi secret police, and the imminent threats of a rising neo-Nazi movement. At the same time, they are butting heads with the authorities—both German and American—and facing a possible threat from American intelligence agents who fear that Brodie and Taylor might have learned too much about US clandestine operations during their mission in Venezuela.\n\nUltimately, Brodie and Taylor realize that the murder of Harry Vance was merely the prelude to a much more sinister future event—unless they can unravel the mystery in time to stop it.\n\nORDER NOW\n\nThe Secret by Lee Child and Andrew Child\n\nRelease Date: October 24th\n\nThe gripping new Jack Reacher thriller from the #1 New York Times bestselling authors Lee Child and Andrew Child\n\n1992.
