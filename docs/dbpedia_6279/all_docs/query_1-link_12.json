This suspenseful debut by Julia Bartz had me hooked from the first page. THE WRITING RETREAT is about a famous author who invites five up-and-coming female novelists to her home in the Adirondacks for a month-long writing competition. The retreat is fierce, but there is a whole lot more at stake than just winning. The gothic atmospheric setting and complicated characters are icing on the cake for this cold winter hair-raiser. That’s all I’ll say about the plot . . . to make this psychological read all the more intriguing.\n\nThe Writing Retreat\n\nJulia Bartz\n\nThe Plot meets Please Join Us in this psychological suspense debut about a young author at an exclusive writer’s retreat that descends into a nightmare.\n\nAlex has all but given up on her dreams of becoming a published author when she receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: attend an exclusive, month-long writing retreat at the estate of feminist horror writer Roza Vallo. Even the knowledge that Wren, her former best friend and current rival, is attending doesn’t dampen her excitement.\n\nBut when the attendees arrive, Roza drops a bombshell—they must all complete an entire novel from scratch during the next month, and the author of the best one will receive a life-changing seven-figure publishing deal. Determined to win this seemingly impossible contest, Alex buckles down and tries to ignore the strange happenings at the estate, including Roza’s erratic behavior, Wren’s cruel mind games, and the alleged haunting of the mansion itself. But when one of the writers vanishes during a snowstorm, Alex realizes that something very sinister is afoot. With the clock running out, she’s desperate to discover the truth and save herself.\n\nA claustrophobic and propulsive thriller exploring the dark side of female friendships and fame, The Writing Retreat is the unputdownable debut novel from a compelling new talent.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nLying Beside You\n\nby Michael Robotham\n\nAndie’s Pick #2: Get ready for your next riveting read with Michael Robotham’s latest thriller LYING BESIDE YOU! In this third installment of the series (which can also be read as a stand-alone), a man is murdered and his daughter Maya Kirk is missing. Forensic psychologist Cyrus Haven is called in to profile the killer and help piece together the hours before the disappearance. While Cyrus is on the case, Evie Cormac, a damaged and gifted teenager who is also Cyrus’s ward and can tell when someone is lying, is working at a bar where another woman goes missing . . . and Evie is the only witness. Could these two cases somehow be linked? Add to the mix that Cyrus’s brother, Elias, has been released from a psychiatric hospital after twenty years for killing Cyrus’s parents and young sisters, and he’s coming to stay with Evie and Cyrus. These are all pieces to a big puzzle and suspenseful English ride. LYING BESIDE YOU is full of psychological twists and turns, the dynamic between Cyrus and Evie is first-rate, and Robotham is at the top of his game.\n\nLying Beside You\n\nMichael Robotham\n\nCyrus Haven and Evie Cormac return in Robotham’s latest page-turning, psychological thriller in this “gripping and eerie” (Karin Slaughter) series, reaffirming why Stephen King has proclaimed this author “an absolute master.”\n\nIf I could tell you one thing about my brother, it would be this. Two days after his nineteenth birthday, he killed our parents and twin sisters because he heard voices in his head. As defining events go, nothing else comes close for Elias, or for me.\n\nAs a boy, Cyrus Haven survived a family massacre and slowly pieced his life back together. Now, after almost twenty years, his brother is applying to be released from a secure psychiatric hospital—and Cyrus is expected to forgive Elias and welcome him home.\n\nElias is returning to a very different world. Cyrus is now a successful psychologist, working with the police, sharing his house with Evie Cormac, a damaged and gifted teenager who can tell when someone is lying. Evie has gone back to school and is working part-time at an inner-city bar, but she continues to struggle with authority and following rules.\n\nWhen a man is murdered and his daughter disappears, Cyrus is called in to profile the killer and help piece together Maya Kirk’s last hours. Police believe she was drugged and driven away from the same bar where Evie is working. Soon, a second victim is taken, and Evie is the only person who glimpsed the man behind the wheel.\n\nBut there’s a problem. Only two people believe her. One is Cyrus.\n\nThe other is the killer.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nTheir Vicious Games\n\nby Joelle Wellington\n\nSharon’s Pick: Although THEIR VICIOUS GAMES doesn’t come out until the summer of 2023, it has already been garnering buzz across the internet, and for good reason! Citing ACE OF SPADES, Squid Game, and Gossip Girl as influences, THEIR VICIOUS GAMES sounds absolutely thrilling.\n\nKnowing she has to work twice as hard to get half as much, Black teen Adina Walker strives to be perfect at the predominantly white Edgewater Academy in order to get into the Ivy League school of her dreams. However, when she gets in a fight and is blacklisted from her top choice school, she must participate in the Finish, a competition hosted by Edgewater’s founding family, which pits twelve girls of exceptional promise against each other. As Adina discovers that the Finish’s stakes are life-and-death, she realizes that the only means to her survival lies in changing the rules.\n\nTheir Vicious Games\n\nJoelle Wellington\n\nA Black teen desperate to regain her Ivy League acceptance enters an elite competition only to discover the stakes aren’t just high, they’re deadly, in this searing thriller that’s Ace of Spades meets Squid Game with a sprinkling of The Bachelor.\n\nYou must work twice as hard to get half as much.\n\nAdina Walker has known this the entire time she’s been on scholarship at the prestigious Edgewater Academy—a school for the rich (and mostly white) upper class of New England. It’s why she works so hard to be perfect and above reproach, no matter what she must force beneath the surface. Even one slip can cost you everything.\n\nAnd it does. One fight, one moment of lost control, leaves Adina blacklisted from her top choice Ivy League college and any other. Her only chance to regain the future she’s sacrificed everything for is the Finish, a high-stakes contest sponsored by Edgewater’s founding family in which twelve young, ambitious women with exceptional promise are selected to compete in three mysterious events: the Ride, the Raid, and the Royale. The winner will be granted entry into the fold of the Remington family, whose wealth and power can open any door.\n\nBut when she arrives at the Finish, Adina quickly gets the feeling that something isn’t quite right with both the Remingtons and her competition, and soon it becomes clear that this larger-than-life prize can only come at an even greater cost. Because the Finish’s stakes aren’t just make or break…they’re life and death.\n\nAdina knows the deck is stacked against her—it always has been—so maybe the only way to survive their vicious games is for her to change the rules.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nThe Twyford Code\n\nby Janice Hallett\n\nEmily’s Pick #1: I didn’t fit enough jigsaw puzzling into my holiday break, so I’m trying to make up for it with mystery novels where scenes resemble puzzle pieces that I have to scramble to put together. THE TWYFORD CODE by Janice Hallett sounds perfect! When a young Steven Smith found a copy of a famous children’s book by Edith Twyford filled with bizarre markings inside, he enlisted the help of his English teacher to figure them out. Together they realized the markings relate to a secret code in all of Twyford’s novels. Forty years later and the mystery still haunts Steven. Freshly released from prison, he recounts his past and tries to unlock the decades-old mystery while also reflecting on what landed him in prison in the first place—and what happened to his English teacher from so long ago.\n\nThe Twyford Code\n\nJanice Hallett\n\nThe mysterious connection between a teacher’s disappearance and an unsolved code in a children’s book is explored in this fresh novel from the author of the “clever and often wryly funny” (PopSugar) novel The Appeal.\n\nForty years ago, Steven “Smithy” Smith found a copy of a famous children’s book by disgraced author Edith Twyford, its margins full of strange markings and annotations. When he showed it to his remedial English teacher Miss Iles, she believed that it was part of a secret code that ran through all of Twyford’s novels. And when she disappeared on a class field trip, Smithy became convinced that she had been right.\n\nNow, out of prison after a long stretch, Smithy decides to investigate the mystery that has haunted him for decades. In a series of voice recordings on an old iPhone from his estranged son, Smithy alternates between visiting the people of his childhood and looking back on the events that later landed him in prison.\n\nBut it soon becomes clear that Edith Twyford wasn’t just a writer of forgotten children’s stories. The Twyford Code holds a great secret, and Smithy may just have the key.\n\n“A modern Agatha Christie” (The Sunday Times, London), Janice Hallett has constructed a fiendishly clever, maddeningly original crime novel for lovers of word games, puzzles, and stories of redemption.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nMurder Your Employer\n\nby Rupert Holmes\n\nEmily’s Pick #2: What a title! Now just wait until you hear the premise. At the McMasters Conservatory for the Applied Arts, students are taught how to successfully get away with a murder—with lessons very closely tailored toward their specific goal and—er—victim. We follow three enrolled students as they go about their sinister studies. But, as we fall under the spell of these characters (and learn what brought them to such murderous ambitions), the gray areas of morality expand. I can’t wait for what’s sure to be a uniquely thrilling and thought-provoking reading experience—especially since I’ve seen many people call this book “wholesome.”\n\nMurder Your Employer\n\nRupert Holmes\n\nFrom the diabolical imagination of Edgar Award–winning novelist, playwright, and story-songwriter Rupert Holmes comes a devilish thriller with a killer concept: The McMasters Conservatory for the Applied Arts, a luxurious, clandestine college dedicated to the fine art of murder where earnest students study how best to “delete” their most deserving victim.\n\nWho hasn’t wondered for a split second what the world would be like if a person who is the object of your affliction ceased to exist? But then you’ve probably never heard of The McMasters Conservatory, dedicated to the consummate execution of the homicidal arts. To gain admission, a student must have an ethical reason for erasing someone who deeply deserves a fate no worse (nor better) than death. The campus of this “Poison Ivy League” college—its location unknown to even those who study there—is where you might find yourself the practice target of a classmate…and where one’s mandatory graduation thesis is getting away with the perfect murder of someone whose death will make the world a much better place to live.\n\nPrepare for an education you’ll never forget. A delightful mix of witty wordplay, breathtaking twists and genuine intrigue, Murder Your Employer will gain you admission into a wholly original world, cocooned within the most entertaining book about well-intentioned would-be murderers you’ll ever read.\n\nRupert Holmes’s much celebrated career ranges from chart-topping story songs with surprising twists—“Escape (The Pina Colada Song)”—to Tony Award–winning whodunit musicals—The Mystery of Edwin Drood—Edgar Award–winning comedy-thrillers—Accomplice—and the Nero Wolfe Best American Mystery Novel nominated Where the Truth Lies, made into an Atom Egoyan motion picture starring Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon. Called “an American treasure” (Los Angeles Times), “a true Renaissance man” by Newsweek, “a comic genius” (Kirkus Reviews) and simply “a genius” (The Times, London), Rupert Holmes brings his wickedly clever storytelling talents to this outrageous and darkly comic mystery set in a secret, idyllic campus where students learn how to “do in others as you would have others do you in.”\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nA Death at the Party\n\nby Amy Stuart\n\nMel’s Pick: I completely devoured bestselling author Amy Stuart's A DEATH AT THE PARTY. I know it has been said many times over by thriller readers but this book truly had me guessing whodunit until the very end, and I have been raving about it to everyone I know since. It’s set over the course of a single day during an elaborate garden party and shows how a family drama devolves and rumors twist until they result in doting wife, mother, and daughter Nadine standing over a dead body in the cellar. If you love books by authors Lisa Jewell, Ashley Audrain, and Lucy Foley, you'll definitely want to pick this one up. A DEATH AT THE PARTY is a tense, literary thriller filled with secrets, haunting memories, and an exquisite twist ending.\n\nA Death at the Party\n\nAmy Stuart\n\nIn this tense, spellbinding thriller set over the course of a single day, a woman prepares for a party that goes dreadfully wrong—for fans of Ashley Audrain and Lisa Jewell.\n\nNadine Walsh’s summer garden party is in full swing. The neighbors all have cocktails, the catered food is exquisite—everything’s going according to plan.\n\nBut Nadine—devoted wife, loving mother, and doting daughter—finds herself standing over a dead body in her basement while her guests clink glasses upstairs. What happened? How did it come to this?\n\nRewind to that morning, when Nadine is in her kitchen, making last-minute preparations before she welcomes more than a hundred guests to her home to celebrate her mother’s birthday. But her husband is of little help to her, her two grown children are consumed with their own concerns, and her mother—only her mother knows that today isn’t just a birthday party. It marks another anniversary as well.\n\nStill, Nadine will focus just on tonight. Everyone deserves a celebration after the year they’ve had. A chance for fun. A chance to forget. But it’s hard to forget when Nadine’s head is swirling with secrets, haunting memories, and concerns about what might happen when her guests unite.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nZero Days\n\nby Ruth Ware\n\nMackenzie’s Pick #1: If you’re a fan of the Bourne movie franchise, or Mr. and Mrs. Smith, you must read Ruth Ware’s next thriller ZERO DAYS! Our main character Jack (short for Jacinta) is a low-key professional spy who is forced to go on the run after being framed for a vicious crime. The reader follows her on a nail-biting, gut-wrenching quest through London as she searches for clues to prove she’s innocent. ZERO DAYS will delight both this masterful author’s longtime fans and appeal to new readers.\n\nZero Days\n\nRuth Ware\n\nThe New York Times bestselling “new Agatha Christie” (Air Mail) Ruth Ware returns with this adrenaline-fueled thriller that combines Mr. and Mrs. Smith with The Fugitive about a woman in a race against time to clear her name and find her husband’s murderer.\n\nHired by companies to break into buildings and hack security systems, Jack and her husband, Gabe, are the best penetration specialists in the business. But after a routine assignment goes horribly wrong, Jack arrives home to find her husband dead. To add to her horror, the police are closing in on their suspect—her.\n\nSuddenly on the run and quickly running out of options, Jack must decide who she can trust as she circles closer to the real killer in this unputdownable and heart-pounding mystery from an author whose “propulsive prose keeps readers on the hook and refuses to let anyone off until all has been revealed” (Shelf Awareness).\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nThe Blackhouse\n\nby Carole Johnstone\n\nSara’s Pick #1: Is moving to Scotland one of your 2023 resolutions? Maybe reconsider that one. When Robert moves his whole life, family included, to an island in the Outer Hebrides, he hopes he can leave the past behind and find a community he can rely on. But, well, let’s just say that his plan goes south quickly. When a young journalist named Maggie MacKay enters the picture some 20 years later, claiming to be the reincarnation of a murdered man from the same community, things go from bad to worse. Is Maggie crazy or is the long-presumed dead man looking to settle some scores? As full of twists and turns as the whipping winds of the island’s storms, THE BLACKHOUSE is sure to have you shivering from its atmospheric thrills and chills.\n\nThe Blackhouse\n\nCarole Johnstone\n\nFrom the author of the “dark and devious...beautifully written” (Stephen King) Mirrorland comes a richly atmospheric thriller set on an isolated Scottish island where nothing is as it seems and shocking twists lie around every corner.\n\nA remote village. A deadly secret. An outsider who knows the truth.\n\nRobert Reid moved his family to Scotland’s Outer Hebrides in the 1990s, driven by hope, craving safety and community, and hiding a terrible secret. But despite his best efforts to fit in, Robert is always seen as an outsider. And as the legendary and violent Hebridean storms rage around him, he begins to unravel, believing his fate on the remote island of Kilmeray cannot be escaped.\n\nFor her entire life, Maggie MacKay has sensed something was wrong with her. When Maggie was five years old, she announced that a man on Kilmeray—a place she’d never visited—had been murdered. Her unfounded claim drew media attention and turned the locals against each other, creating rifts that never mended.\n\nNearly twenty years later, Maggie is determined to find out what really happened, and what the islanders are hiding. But when she begins to receive ominous threats, Maggie is forced to consider how much she is willing to risk to discover the horrifying truth.\n\nUnnerving, enthralling, and filled with gothic suspense, The Blackhouse is a spectacularly sinister tale readers won’t soon forget.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nHow to Sell a Haunted House\n\nby Grady Hendrix\n\nSara’s Pick #2: Horror author Grady Hendrix is back with yet another tale of terror that hits close to home, literally. When estranged siblings Louise and Mark inherit their childhood home after their parents’ questionable deaths, they agree to sell it to salvage what’s left of their bank account post-pandemic. But they soon discover that their parents had done some pretty strange things to the house, like covering all the mirrors and nailing the attic door shut—not to mention the presence in the house of harassing puppets. Something strange is lurking in the old home, and Louise and Mark will have to get over their grudges and emotional baggage to survive it. HOW TO SELL A HAUNTED HOUSE is as much about the horror of family as it is about creaky floors and mysterious shadows, and highlights just how scary it can sometimes be to go back home.\n\nHow to Sell a Haunted House\n\nGrady Hendrix\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nThe Sanctuary\n\nby Katrine Engberg\n\nHeather’s Pick: Fellow Scandinavian noir fans, you won’t want to miss the conclusion to Katrine Engberg’s Kørner and Werner series. The investigators are back for one more case together in THE SANCTUARY, where the clues surrounding a severed corpse in downtown Copenhagen lead Detective Anette Werner to the island of Bornholm, where Jeppe Kørner, on leave, just so happens to be spending his winter. All he wanted was to escape the world for a little while, but Kørner comes to realize Bornholm isn’t at all the peaceful place he had assumed it would be. In fact, its dark secrets may get him killed. . . .\n\nThe Sanctuary\n\nKatrine Engberg\n\nFrom internationally bestselling author Katrine Engberg, the series that is a “gripping addition to the Scandinavian crime fiction pantheon” (Oprah Daily) comes to a stunning conclusion as Jeppe Kørner and Anette Werner rush to untangle a long-simmering mystery before a brutal killer strikes again.\n\nJeppe Kørner, on leave from the police force and nursing a broken heart, has taken refuge on the island of Bornholm for the winter. Also on the island is Esther de Laurenti, a writer working on a biography on a female anthropologist with a mysterious past and coming to terms with her own crushing sense of loneliness in the wake of a dear friend’s death. When Jeppe lends a helping hand at the island’s local sawmill, he begins to realize that the island may not be the peaceful refuge it appears to be.\n\nBack in Copenhagen, Anette Werner is tasked with leading the investigation into a severed corpse discovered on a downtown playground. As she follows the strange trail of clues, they all seem to lead back to Bornholm. With an innocent offer to check out a lead, Jeppe unwittingly finds himself in the crosshairs of a sinister mystery rooted in the past, forcing him to team up with Anette and Esther to unravel the island’s secrets before it’s too late.\n\nWith her signature “unforgettable characters and brilliant plot twists” (Kathy Reichs, #1 New York Times bestselling author), Katrine Engberg weaves a satisfying and white-knuckled finale to her Korner and Werner series that is a modern classic of Scandinavian noir.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nCamp Zero\n\nby Michelle Min Sterling\n\nEmily’s Pick #3: Although I’m terrified of the very real threat of climate change, I’m trying to read books that put the future into a present perspective. Michelle Min Sterling’s debut thriller seems to do just that while providing intriguing character development. In the near future, climate change has ravaged the world, forcing many to enter isolated “camps” in northern cities. The main protagonist, Rose, heads to one such mysterious camp in northern Canada—she’s been promised housing there if she spies on its creator—where she meets another newcomer and climate-displaced person, Grant. As they get to know each other and delve into the mysteries of the camp and nearby research stations, the story contemplates layers of class, gender, and more.\n\nCamp Zero\n\nMichelle Min Sterling\n\nIn a near-future northern settlement, a handful of climate change survivors find their fates intertwined in this mesmerizing and transportive novel in the vein of Station Eleven and The Power.\n\nIn the far north of Canada sits Camp Zero, an American building project hiding many secrets.\n\nDesperate to help her climate-displaced Korean immigrant mother, Rose agrees to travel to Camp Zero and spy on its architect in exchange for housing. She arrives at the same time as another newcomer, a college professor named Grant who is determined to flee his wealthy family’s dark legacy. Gradually, they realize that there is more to the architect than previously thought, and a disturbing mystery lurks beneath the surface of the camp. At the same time, rumors abound of an elite group of women soldiers living and working at a nearby Cold War-era climate research station. What are they doing there? And who is leading them?\n\nAn electrifying page-turner where nothing is as it seems, Camp Zero cleverly explores how the intersection of gender, class, and migration will impact who and what will survive in a warming world.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nWhere Are the Children Now?\n\nby Mary Higgins Clark & Alafair Burke\n\nDanielle’s Pick: The late Mary Higgins Clark was known as the “Queen of Suspense” and the accolades she accrued in her lifetime—including fifty-six bestselling novels—make it easy to see why. If you need any additional convincing, however, look no further than Mary’s final collaboration with her longtime co-author Alafair Burke, WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN NOW? The long-awaited sequel to the novel that made Mary a household name—WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?—revisits the woman at the center of the original, Nancy Harmon, and her now adult children, Mike and Melissa. When Melissa’s new stepdaughter goes missing, Mike and Melissa must draw from their own childhood experience of being abducted to try to save her from sharing their trauma (or worse). This book is a must-read for any fan of domestic suspense, and you don’t need to have read the first book to be completely gripped by the twists and turns of WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN NOW?\n\nWhere Are the Children Now?\n\nMary Higgins Clark & Alafair Burke\n\nThe legacy of the “Queen of Suspense” continues with the highly anticipated follow-up to Mary Higgins Clark’s iconic novel Where Are The Children?, featuring the children of Nancy Harmon, facing peril once again as adults.\n\nOf the fifty-six bestsellers the “Queen of Suspense” Mary Higgins Clark published in her lifetime, Where Are the Children? was her biggest, selling millions of copies and forever transforming the genre of suspense fiction. In that story, a young California mother named Nancy Harmon was convicted of murdering her two children. Though released on a technicality, she was abandoned by her husband and became such a pariah in the media that she was forced to move across the country to Cape Cod, change her identity and appearance, and start a new life. Years later her two children from a second marriage, Mike and Melissa, would go missing, and Nancy yet again became the prime suspect—but this time, Nancy was able to confront the secrets buried in her past and rescue her kids from a dangerous predator.\n\nNow, more than four decades since readers first met Nancy and her children, comes the thrilling sequel to the groundbreaking book that set the stage for future generations of psychological suspense novels. A lawyer turned successful podcaster, Melissa has recently married a man whose first wife died tragically, leaving him and their young daughter, Riley, behind. While Melissa and her brother, Mike, help their mom, Nancy, relocate from Cape Cod to the equally idyllic Hamptons, Melissa’s new stepdaughter goes missing. Drawing on the experience of their own abduction, Melissa and Mike race to find Riley to save her from the trauma they still struggle with—or worse.\n\nJust like the original, Where Are the Children Now? keeps readers guessing and holding their breath until the very last page.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nDon't Fear the Reaper\n\nby Stephen Graham Jones\n\nJustin’s Pick: A sequel is rarely ever as good as the original, especially when it comes to horror—and *especially especially* when it comes to horror slashers. But leave it to genre master Stephen Graham Jones to once again take your expectations and trope-awareness and kindly slash them in half with a chainsaw.
