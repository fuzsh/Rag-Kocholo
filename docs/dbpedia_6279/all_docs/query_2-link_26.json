        "text": "List of characters in the Rick and Morty franchise\n\nRick and Morty is an American adult animated multimedia franchise originating with the Adult Swim television series of the same name created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, which premiered in 2013. The television series revolves around Rick Sanchez, an eccentric, alcoholic scientist who takes his grandson Morty Smith on dangerous, outlandish adventures throughout the cosmos and alternate universe. The franchise also includes the spin-off series Vindicators 2, the anime series, and several comic book series published by Oni Press. The following is a list of characters from the Rick and Morty franchise.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nMain characters\n\n[edit]\n\nCharacter Voiced by Seasons The Anime 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Rick Sanchez[a] Justin Roiland Main Does not appear Ian Cardoni Does not appear Main Does not appear Yōhei Tadano Does not appear Main Joe Daniels Does not appear Main Morty Smith[b] Justin Roiland Main Does not appear Harry Belden Does not appear Main Does not appear Keisuke Chiba Does not appear Main Gabriel Regojo Does not appear Main Jerry Smith[c] Chris Parnell Main Does not appear Manabu Muraji Does not appear Main Joe Daniels Does not appear Main Summer Smith[d] Spencer Grammer Main Does not appear Akiha Matsui Does not appear Main Donna Bella Litton Does not appear Main Beth Smith[e] Sarah Chalke Main Does not appear Jun Irie Does not appear Main Patricia Duran Does not appear Main\n\nRecurring characters\n\n[edit]\n\nCharacter Voiced by First appearance Seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Jessica Kari Wahlgren \"Pilot\"[f][g] Recurring Guest Does not appear Recurring Principal Gene Vagina Phil Hendrie Recurring Does not appear Guest Mr. Goldenfold Brandon Johnson Recurring Does not appear Guest Tammy Gueterman Cassie Steele \"Meeseeks and Destroy\"[f] Recurring Guest Does not appear Birdperson\n\nPhoenixperson Dan Harmon \"Ricksy Business\" Guest Recurring Does not appear Guest Squanchy Tom Kenny Guest Recurring Does not appear Guest Does not appear Recurring Space Cruiser / Car\n\nD.I.A.N.E. / Diane Sanchez Kari Wahlgren \"Pilot\" \"The Ricks Must Be Crazy\" (voice) Silent Recurring Silent Recurring Guest Wayne \"Mr. Poopybutthole\" Justin Roiland \"Total Rickall\"[g] Does not appear Recurring Guest Does not appear Jon Allen Does not appear Recurring President Andre Curtis Keith David \"Get Schwifty\"[g] Does not appear Guest Photo Recurring Gene Gilligan Tom Kenny \"The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy\" Does not appear Guest Silent Guest Recurring\n\nMain characters\n\n[edit]\n\nRick Sanchez\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rick Sanchez\n\nRichard D. \"Rick\" Sanchez (voiced by Justin Roiland in season 1–6,[1] Ian Cardoni in season 7–present), is a sociopathic, nihilistic, grouchy, immature, crude, rude, narcissistic, self-centered, alcoholic mad scientist who is the widowed father of Beth Smith and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer. He is 70 years old as of season 3. The main premise of the show revolves around Rick's high-concept science-fiction misadventures with Morty (often against his will). His sociopathic tendencies coupled with immense intelligence lead his daughter's family to worry about the safety of their son. An extremely intellectual character – frequently referred to by himself and others as the Smartest Man in the Universe – that views his time as valuable,[2] he disparages many ordinary human conventions such as school, marriage, and love, though he displays genuine affection towards his grandchildren and daughter throughout the series. His reaction to the mundane requests asked of him by Morty and other family members suggests he considers himself wholly superior to them, though in several instances throughout the series he shows a lonelier side. He frequently 'burp-talks' words in the middle of a sentence while speaking, presumably as a result of his alcoholism. He is identified as Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-137, or Rick C-137. In \"The Wedding Squanchers\", Rick, alongside Squanchy and Birdperson, were revealed to be freedom fighters against the Galactic Federation who labeled them terrorists with warrants for their arrest. In order to guarantee the safety of his family, Rick leaves a tip on where he can be found as he surrenders to the Galactic Federation and is incarcerated in one of their prisons. In \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\" it is revealed that Rick actually turned himself in, in a scheme to destroy the Federation's economy; when the Council of Ricks interferes, Rick also takes the opportunity to take down the Council of Ricks. Rick also orchestrated \"sending\" Jerry away for his earlier attempt to convince the family to turn him into Federation custody and making Rick \"the de-facto patriarch of the household\". However, Rick's attempt at driving Jerry away was unsuccessful, resulting in a diminished role in the family. The character was inspired by Emmett Brown from Back to the Future and Marvel's Reed Richards.\n\nMorty Smith\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Morty Smith\n\nMortimer Chauncey \"Morty\" Smith (voiced by Justin Roiland in season 1–6,[1] Harry Belden in season 7–present) is Rick's neurotic 14-year-old grandson who is frequently dragged into Rick's misadventures. Morty is good-natured but he is easily distressed. He is often reluctant to follow Rick's plans, and he often ends up traumatized by the unorthodox and morally questionable methods Rick uses to 'fix' situations. The main Morty the episodes follow is referred to as the \"Mortiest Morty\" by Rick due to his courage, which nearly every other Morty lacks due to their main use being makeshift cloaking devices, in which \"Morty waves\" cancel out a Rick's \"genius waves\" (a concept Morty takes offense to), and is later revealed to be designated \"Morty Prime\" in the commentary for \"Solaricks\". In \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\", Morty is angry at Rick for abandoning them and convinces Summer not to do so and even comes close to killing Rick when it appears that he is threatening Summer's life, though in the end, after Rick returns home, Morty is glad to have his grandfather back. However, in \"The Rickchurian Mortydate\", Morty refuses to be at Rick's side when he decides to leave and stays with his parents and Summer. In \"Raising Gazorpazorp\", he accidentally impregnates an alien breeding robot, which gives birth to his half-alien son, Mortimer Smith Jr.; another son of Morty's, Naruto, is later born in \"Rickdependence Spray\". Throughout the series, several characters mention that Morty has a learning disability, and he often displays low self-esteem. Despite this, he's shown to be intelligent and resourceful at times, and as the series progresses, he learns how to use many of Rick's devices and even manipulates Rick into taking Jerry on an adventure. By the end of season three he displays an uncanny degree of common sense as well as a deep understanding of Rick's twisted mind, as seen in \"Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender\". The character was loosely inspired by Marty McFly from Back to the Future.\n\nJerry Smith\n\n[edit]\n\nGerald \"Jerry\" Smith Sr. (voiced by Chris Parnell[1]) is Summer and Morty's insecure 34-year-old father, Beth's husband, and Rick's son-in-law, who strongly disapproves of Rick's influence over his family. Jerry used to work at a low-level advertising agency until he was fired for incompetence. Generally insecure, he is frequently led into conflicts stemming from opportunistic posturing, while his marriage is sometimes jeopardized by his wife's reactions to his poor relationship with Rick. Beth views Jerry as meek under his boasts, ultimately fearful of confrontation. However, it is strongly suggested that in spite of their problems, they are emotionally codependent. The episode \"Mortynight Run\" reveals that one of the Ricks, keenly aware that every Jerry is incapable of surviving off of Earth, created a daycare where every Jerry is dropped off by their Rick and Morty during adventures should he attempt to accompany them; in \"Solaricks\", it is revealed that Jerry was switched in the Jerryboree, with the main character Jerry of the series having been introduced in \"Mortynight Run\". It is revealed in the same episode that in some dimensions, Beth has left Jerry and remarried. By the end of \"The Wedding Squanchers\", having attempted to talk his family into selling Rick out, Jerry becomes the only member of the family to benefit from the Earth joining the Galactic Federation. After the federation collapses, Jerry puts his foot down and tells Beth it is him or Rick, but Beth chooses her father and tells Rick that she and Jerry are getting a divorce. Rick later claims to Morty in a rant that he planned this because Jerry had planned to betray him. As Jerry leaves, Summer ignores him and Rick waits for him to leave. Summer comes to terms with the separation and reconciles with him. In \"The Rickchurian Mortydate\", Jerry and Beth reconnect and she calls off the divorce, and they later establish a throuple with Beth's clone, Space Beth.\n\nBeth Smith\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Beth Smith\n\nBeth Smith (née Sanchez) (voiced by Sarah Chalke) is Rick's daughter, Summer and Morty's mother, and Jerry's wife. She is a veterinarian who specializes in horse surgery, a job she internally feels to be beneath her and is often defensive when her career is compared to human medicine. Level-headed and assertive, she struggles with her husband's ego, which thrives in defiance of his proven mediocrity. Several episodes have dealt with Beth's deep dissatisfaction with her life, stemming from her belief that she has \"settled\" in her marriage, family, and job. She wanted to become a \"real\" surgeon but became pregnant with Summer at 17. She is the most assertive force in her household, while also displaying traits of selfishness, humor, and intelligence. Beth is unperturbed by her father's destructive and dangerous tendencies around her son. She, from childhood, views Rick more favorably than her mother due to the parental separation.[2] Harmon expanded upon this origin in an interview: \"Kids can sometimes idolize their worst parent and blame their supportive parent for chasing off the dad with the guts to leave. ... She believes that Rick, as crazy as he is, is the better of her two parents even though she was raised by her mother and she blames her mother's unremarkability on her father's departure and will do anything to keep her father back in her life.\"[2] In \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\", Beth is heartbroken that Rick abandoned her again and is unhappy with the federation's new conditions as the medicine they provide makes horses healthier than ever, which affects her job. She is glad when Rick comes back home again, but Jerry, sick of Rick, forces her to choose between Rick and himself. Beth chooses Rick over Jerry, leading to their implied divorce. In \"The ABC's of Beth\", it is revealed that Beth shares the same sociopathic tendencies as her father. Rick offers to make Beth a clone of herself to tend to her family while she can explore the multiverse. In \"The Rickchurian Mortydate\", she begins to believe that she herself is the clone and goes to Jerry for help. Beth realizes that she loves Jerry and calls off the divorce, renewing her bond with her family and no longer insecure about Rick abandoning her again.\n\nSummer Smith\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Summer Smith\n\nSummer Smith (voiced by Spencer Grammer[1]) is Morty's 17-year-old older sister, a more conventional and often superficial teenager, who is obsessed with improving her status among her peers. Summer is generally similar to her mother, and she is often shown to be very smart and humorous, but she has also shown elements of Jerry's approval-seeking. She occasionally expresses jealousy that Morty gets to accompany Rick on his inter-dimensional adventures. In the second season, she accompanies Rick and Morty on adventures more frequently and sometimes will even prove herself to be more competent than Morty, especially when emotional nuance is required. Summer has, on occasion, been shown to think similarly to Rick, such as quickly figuring out a way to save herself and Rick from execution and correctly deducing that dead flies in Rick's garage were more than they appeared. Summer cares about Rick and sees him as a hero, though he is often contemptuous and dismissive of her teenaged life perspective and values. In \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\", she is the only member of the family who wants to rescue Rick, despite the pleas of her brother that Rick is nothing more than a selfish jerk. When their parents agree on a divorce, Summer begins resenting her father and starts showing her dark side until she reconciles with him.\n\nPrime Smith family\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Prime Smith family, consisting of Jerry, Beth, and Summer (voiced by Parnell, Chalke, and Grammer), were the main characters when Rick and Morty began, and as such were identical to the \"current\" Smith family. In \"Rick Potion #9\", they are left behind as Rick C-137 takes Morty to a new dimension to live after he irreparably turns everyone besides them into body horror mutants referred to as \"Cronenbergs\". By the time Morty Prime and the Summer return to his original dimension in the season 3 premiere, \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\", the sanity of the original Smiths seems to have eroded, as they attempt to kill Summer and hold Morty captive because of their association with Rick. On thawing out, having regained a semblance of sanity in the comic arc \"Look Who's Cronenberging Now\", Summer Prime sacrifices herself to stop the plans of an invading Coalition of Ricks. In the season 5 finale, Beth Prime is briefly seen in a Rick's 'crybaby backstory' as he crashes into their garage in his ship; in the season 6 premiere, \"Solaricks\", it is revealed that Beth Prime has also since died, leaving Jerry (now dubbed Apocalypse Jerry) alone. Having regained his humanity, Jerry spent his days reading and scavenging, rejecting Morty on his brief return and berating him for \"leaving us to freeze\", their residual injuries from having been frozen having been what led to Summer's sacrifice play (attributed to not having \"thawed right\") and Beth's death, until being killed by Rick Prime: the original Rick of the reality, with Rick C-137 having initially elected to live with the Prime Smith family and surrounding timelines out of a wish to track down Prime and kill him for having killed C-137's Diane and Beth (the latter as a child).\n\nSecondary characters\n\n[edit]\n\nRelatives of the Smith–Sanchez family\n\n[edit]\n\nSpace Beth (voiced by Sarah Chalke) is another version of Beth presented as either the real Beth Smith, having elected to go to space and leave a clone on Earth in \"The ABC's of Beth\", or a clone herself, whom Rick sent to space after the real Beth elected to remain on Earth, with the status of which Beth is a clone and which is real remaining ambiguous throughout the series, on the character's official introduction in \"Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri\". Regardless, \"Space Beth\" (known as \"Space Mom\" to Morty and Summer) is depicted as fighting a new and improved version of the Galactic Federation, having usurped Rick as the \"Most Wanted\" in the galaxy. However, Rick erased his memory so that he does not remember which Beth is the original and which is the clone, which results in both Beths not caring about the truth or about Rick.\n\nDiane Sanchez (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) – Diane was Rick's wife. She is seen in a flashback during the Season 3 premiere entering the garage with a young Beth. As Rick vows to give up science, they prepare to go for ice cream when Diane was killed by a bomb sent through a portal created by another Rick as revenge for the main Rick refusing to join him. Rick then decides to become a scientist again to avenge his family. Although this origin story is revealed to be a fabrication to trap a Galactic Federation agent, Mr. Nimbus reveals in the Season 5 premiere that Diane is dead. In the Season 5 finale, it is revealed that the backstory was actually true. In Season 6 We see Rick's abandoned house in his original universe. It is revealed that Rick built a computer program which would play Diane's voice, as if heard from the next room (no matter which room he was in), taunting him over his failure to protect his family; an act Rick freely admits he did to torture himself. An alternate version of Diane, Bonnie Sinclair, was created by cover artist Giahna Pantano in supplementary materials for the Rick and Morty Oni Press comic series.[3] In the Season 7 episode \"Unmortricken\", Rick Prime reveals that he had personally killed Diane from every universe using the Omega Device.\n\nMortimer \"Morty\" Smith Jr. (voiced by Finnegan Perry as a baby, Will Jennings as a child, Richard Christy as a teenager, and Maurice LaMarche as an adult) – Morty's half-Gazorpian son. He was conceived by Morty's extensive use of a sex robot \"Gwendolyn\" from the planet Gazorpazorp. Due to his Gazorpian heritage, Morty Jr. is extremely prone to violence, something Morty tries hard to discourage. By the end of the episode, he learns to channel his violent urges into writing and releases a book entitled \"My Horrible Father\" about Morty.\n\nLeonard and Joyce Smith (voiced by Dana Carvey and Patricia Lentz) – Jerry's parents. They have a cuckold relationship with Jacob. Leonard enjoys watching him and Joyce have sex while hiding in their bedroom closet, often while dressed as Superman. Leonard returns in the comic series Rick and Morty: Worlds Apart, a sequel to the fourth season episode \"Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty\", electing to help Morty and Balthazar after Rick is unavailable and Joyce goes on a cruise alone with Jacob. Joyce meanwhile returns in the sixth season episode \"Final DeSmithation\", as Rick and Jerry successfully prevent one of Fortune 500's reality-altering fortune cookies from causing a forced incestuous encounter to occur between the duo.\n\nJacob (voiced by Echo Kellum) – Joyce's lover. He appears to be a pleasant and friendly individual, though Jerry is uncomfortable with his cuckold relationship with his parents. In Worlds Apart, he goes on a cruise with Joyce, without Leonard.\n\nHemorrhage (voiced by Joel McHale) – Summer's ex-husband. He appears as a muscle-bound, gruff-voiced raider with a helmet over his head, hiding his relatively normal face, and is shown to be very capable of driving with excellent shooting skills. Residing in the Post-Apocalyptic Dimension, after Rick ends the apocalypse, Summer leaves him for her home reality. After briefly tracking down Summer in her home dimension in the Rick and Morty comic series, attending high school for a spell, Hemorrhage returns in Rick and Morty Presents: Death Stalkers, finally making peace with Summer, and naming his adopted mutant daughter after her.\n\nThe CHUD heir – The half-human, half-CHUD son of Rick and Princess Poñeta and heir to the CHUD throne.\n\nThe Sperm Queen (voiced by Michelle Buteau) – The super-intelligent cyborg sperm daughter of Morty and leader of the Sperm Monsters.\n\nNaruto Smith – The gigantic biological offspring of Morty and Summer, born of a genetic experiment gone horribly wrong. Formally known as the Giant Incest Baby and the Giant Incest Monster (and originally nicknamed Sticky by Morty while in sperm form), Naruto was named by Summer after the title character of the manga of the same name. He is a parody of the star child from 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nThoolie Smith – The half-human, half-\"star seed\" son of Morty and Cathy (Cthylla, daughter of Cthulhu) and heir to the Lovecraftian mythos, born to Morty at the conclusion of Rick and Morty vs. Cthulhu, revealed to be the baby featured at the end of the opening credits of every episode of the television series, who is nicknamed L'il Thoolie by Summer.\n\nNana Smith (voiced by Maria Bamford) – The grandmother of Jerry Smith and great-grandmother of Morty and Summer Smith who is currently dead and living in Heaven.\n\nSlow Mobius (voiced by Chris Romano) – He was the uncle of Rick Sanchez, who had the power to alter time. Slow Mobius was first introduced in episode Ricksy Business. He died in the episode Unmortricken.\n\nHarry Herpson High School staff and students\n\n[edit]\n\nJessica W. (voiced by Kari Wahlgren[1]) – Jessica is a student in Morty's math class. Morty has a crush on her, but she rarely acknowledges him. On the occasions she does, however, she seems to be level headed and kind to him. She attends the dance with him in \"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez\", and even goes on a date with Morty, after he had been temporarily purified in \"Rest and Ricklaxation\". While on another date with Morty in \"Mort Dinner Rick Andre\", Jessica is pulled into another dimension and experiences millennia while frozen in time. On being freed, Jessica elects to find meaning in her life, telling Morty that they should just be friends for now, before declaring herself a Time God. In Rick and Morty Presents: Mr. Nimbus, Jessica is depicted waging a one-woman war on Mr. Nimbus (who nicknames her Time Lord Jessica) for his role in her preservation (having forced Morty to go back for wine so many times), now equipped with time-altering powers, dooming various alternate versions of Rick and Nimbus to a living hell of reincarnation, romance, and murder.\n\nPrincipal Gene Vagina (voiced by Phil Hendrie) – The principal of Harry Herpson High School. He often reminds people that despite his humorous last name, he is \"very much in charge\", even though he often uses his full name talking about himself.\n\nMr. Goldenfold (voiced by Brandon Johnson) – Mr. Goldenfold is Morty's math teacher. He takes his job very seriously, and is often seen loudly proclaiming the importance of mathematics to his class. He also has a multitude of deeply repressed sexual attractions, suffers from coprophagia, and his wife left him which he copes with by going to Jamba Juice. He also happens to be an expert blacksmith. An army of alternate superintelligent Goldenfolds from other dimensions are subsequently introduced in the Oni Press comic series arc The Space Shake Saga, as well as Goldenfold's niece, Noelle .\n\nCoach Feratu – The unseen gym teacher of Harry Herpson High School. He is a vampire who kills people at the school in order to feed. He is killed by Summer, Morty, and Tiny Rick offscreen. In the post-credits scene it is revealed that his real name is Balik Alistane, and his vampire superior is angered that he chose a human alias based on Nosferatu, a famous vampire film, instead of a normal-sounding pseudonym. The comic series Let the Rick One In revolves around Feratu's clan seeking revenge for his death, on behalf of his eternally-teenage son.\n\nBrad (voiced by Echo Kellum) – Brad is a student at Harry Herpson High School. He is a jock who plays football for the school and dates Jessica, and hates when other boys, especially Morty, try to talk to her. He does not appear in the second season. Jessica and Brad broke up in Season 3 Episode 6 \"Rest and Ricklaxation\" however it is implied they are trying to get back together at the end of the episode.\n\nEthan (voiced by Daniel Benson) – Summer's ex-boyfriend. Rick uses him to build his new Anatomy Park after the first one explodes. He dumps Summer in order to try to get with Tricia Lange in \"The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy\", but fails, and out of spite for breaking Summer's heart Morty deforms his body to show him how he made Summer feel. His older brother molested him when he was younger.\n\nNancy (voiced by Aislinn Paul) – An unpopular girl at the school whom Summer dislikes and attempts to get rid of during Rick's party in \"Ricksy Business\". She plays the flute in the school band, and costs Summer her newfound popularity after she tells the other partygoers about Summer's mistreatment of her.\n\nToby Matthews (voiced by Alex Hirsch) – A popular boy at Harry Herpson High School whom Summer has a crush on. He enters a relationship with her thanks to her association with Tiny Rick, but breaks up with her once she gets Tiny Rick expelled in an attempt to save the real Rick's life.\n\nFrank Palicky (voiced by Ryan Ridley) – A psychopathic student at Harry Herpson High School whom Summer had a crush on. He acted as a frequent bully to Morty. Frank was frozen by Rick as he threatened to cut Morty with a switchblade. Despite Rick assuring Morty that he'd be fine and that he'll unfreeze him later, he toppled over and shattered as Summer approached to talk to him.\n\nMC Haps (voiced by Dan Harmon) – A student at the school who also happens to be a rapper. He is first seen performing a \"flu-hating rap\" at the Flu Season Dance during \"Rick Potion #9\", and can later be seen in the background at several other party scenes in the show.\n\nTricia Lange (voiced by Cassie Steele) – A busty attractive girl who Ethan dumps Summer for in \"The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy\", but breaks up with Ethan near the end of the said episode. Tricia and Summer later become best friends, and she expresses sexual interest in Summer's father, Jerry, for his beekeeping profession. In the end \"Rest and Ricklaxation\", she is said to be a urophiliac.\n\nBruce Chutback (voiced by Darren Criss) – He is new to the school in season 5. Morty met him in the math club and thereafter invited him to his house for a party. He's described as \"the newest kid in school, just transferred\", \"hasn't done anything embarrassing yet\", has \"unlimited potential\", no credit is perfect for him and is \"the best\". He along with Morty and Summer go on an adventure on Rick's \"car\". He thinks he is the \"coolest guy\" but is afraid to die and is later given the nickname \"Bruce Chutpants\" due to wearing day-old pants. Bruce was later assaulted outside of his home by the Mailboxians.\n\nJimmy\n\nHolly Hooks (voiced by Tara Strong)\n\nBig Doug\n\nGrace Smith (voiced by Reagan Gomez-Preston)\n\nGordon Lunas (voiced by Maurice LaMarche)\n\nAlternate-universe versions of the main characters\n\n[edit]\n\nDifferent versions of the main characters inhabit other realities and dimensions. Other Ricks are mostly similar to the \"main\" Rick, though some have unique features which set them apart. Most other Mortys seen in the show are far more timid and weak-willed than the main Morty, an exception being Evil Morty.\n\nThe Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks – A parody of the Fantastic Four's Council of Reeds[4][unreliable source?][5][6] which acts as a governing body of sorts for the various versions of Rick inhabiting different timelines and dimensions. They are often at odds with Rick C-137 due to his refusal to cooperate with them (which he claims makes every Rick on the council less Rick than him), but they are otherwise shown to be on good terms with him, as a few council members were seen at Rick's party in \"Ricksy Business\". The council is killed by Rick in the season 3 premiere, \"The Rickshank Redemption\". \"The Ricklantis Mixup\" reveals that after the council's death the Citadel became a democratic government and that the council were really figure-heads for a shadowy Cabal of Ricks. It is revealed in \"Rickmurai Jack\" that Rick created the counsel as well as the citadel and the Central Finite Curve to separate dimensional travel to universes where Rick is the only smartest person while segregating the ones he is not. The counsel has also been manipulating Beth and Jerry's relationship in other realities so Morty will be born for them to recruit and clone other Mortys for them as lackeys.\n\nDoofus Rick – The Rick of Dimension J-19 Zeta 7. He is a supposedly less intelligent Rick with buck teeth and a bowl cut, and allegedly comes from a universe in which everyone consumes their own feces. As he never fathered a Beth, he had his Morty assigned to him, \"Eric Stoltz Mask Morty\", from a dimension in which everyone has lionitis. He is much kinder than most other Ricks and befriends Jerry. In the comic series arc A Tale of Two Jerries, \"Doofus Rick\" is confirmed to be just as intelligent as any other Rick, developing portal fluid which can be used without a gun to return Jerry and himself to the latter's reality to prevent Doofus Rick's own Jerry from conquering the multiverse. In The Rickoning, Doofus Rick and other versions of him are revealed to have taken over the IllumiRicki, planning on taking out Rick C-137 and nearby versions of him so that he and Jerry can be together in peace.\n\n\"Evil Morty\" – Supposedly the Morty of Evil Rick; on his initial appearance, he wore an eyepatch, and did not speak much. His is later revealed to have been controlling \"Evil Rick\", and escapes among the thousands of other Mortys freed from captivity. In \"The Ricklantis Mixup\", this Morty takes on a new identity as Candidate Morty, and is elected President of the Citadel after a stirring speech for unity. He survives an assassination attempt by his former Campaign Manager Morty, after the manager learns his true identity. After election, the newly proclaimed President Morty proceeds to assassinate a shadow cabinet of Ricks who were the true power behind the scenes, and starts grand plans for reform and \"action\". His grand plan is revealed in \"Rickmurai Jack\" where he rigged portal fluid and the Operation Phoenix vats within the citadel and commits mass genocide to the other Rick and Mortys to fuel a device capable of destroying the Central Finite Curve so he'll escape to a reality not dominated by Rick, destroying the citadel in the process.\n\nEvil Rick – Initially presented as Rick who supposedly comes from a dimension in which everyone is evil; he kills other Ricks to download the contents of their brains, and then hacks Rick C-137's portal gun to frame him for the crime. He created a database which sorts Ricks from most evil to least evil, and he and Rick C-137 are separated by a single Rick who Evil Rick describes as being \"super weird\". He is killed by the various Mortys he kidnapped and is then revealed to have a mind control device implanted in his brain, and that he had been controlled remotely by \"his\" Morty; in \"Unmortricken\", his death is revealed to have been a suicide.\n\nAlternate Beth and Jerry – Alternate versions of Beth and Jerry from Dimension C-500A in which Beth aborted Summer. They are both professionally successful, Jerry as a famous Hollywood actor and Beth as renowned surgeon (for humans rather than horses). Jerry is depicted as the best friend of Johnny Depp and engaging in sex with Kristen Stewart. However, despite their successes, both are shown to be deeply unhappy and personally unfulfilled. After Jerry has a breakdown and leads the police on a car chase, he travels to Beth's house and confesses that he loves her and regrets that she got the abortion; the two then embrace and seemingly decide to start anew together. This is seen on one of the channels that Rick and Morty watched.\n\nCampaign Manager Morty – The campaign manager of Candidate Morty. Campaign Manager Morty is fired for not having faith. While at a bar, Investigator Rick reveals to him that Candidate Morty had served as \"Evil Morty\" opposite \"Evil Rick\". Campaign Manager Morty unsuccessfully tries to assassinate Candidate Morty, but is detained and ejected into space through an airlock.\n\nShadow Council of Ricks – A shadowy cabal of Ricks that has secretly controlled the Citadel since before the council. President Morty has most of them killed, rather than become their puppet, leaving only two alive. The corpses of those killed are ejected into space.\n\nRick D. Sanchez III – The CEO of Simple Rick's, a company that manufactures wafers flavoured with chemical secretions of Simple Rick's brain, which has the moment he realized Beth was his greatest creation played in his mind in an endless loop. After a factory worker Rick goes insane and murders Regional Manager Rick and indirectly murders Simple Rick, Rick D. Sanchez III seemingly saves the factory worker from imprisonment, he makes the factory worker the new Simple Rick. Rick D. Sanchez III is later seen at the Shadow Council's meeting with President Morty, who has most of them, including Rick D. Sanchez, shot dead.\n\nCop Rick and Cop Morty – Two Citadel police officers. In contrast between the normal dynamic between Ricks and Mortys, Cop Rick is the more moral of the duo while Cop Morty is amoral and prejudiced against other Mortys. They discover the hideout of a street gang of Mortys, where Cop Rick is injured by a Morty he was trying to comfort. While Cop Rick treats his wound, Cop Morty kills all the Mortytown Locos, horrifying Cop Rick. Cop Morty takes Cop Rick to a strip club, revealing he is a corrupt cop under the payroll of Big Morty. Cop Rick's refusal to take a bribe results in a gunfight, where Cop Morty pins Big Morty on the ground, executing him. Cop Rick shoots Cop Morty and turns himself in, only to be let go and reinstated due to President Morty's changes to the department.\n\nRick Prime – He is an alternate version of Rick first appearing in \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\", he approached Rick C-137 to introduce him to inter dimensional travel. But Rick refuses the offer by putting family over science, this angers Rick Prime and he apparently kills Diane and a young Beth in front of his eyes with a bomb. This traumatized Rick and made him invent his portal gun so he can scour the multiverve in search for Rick Prime to get revenge, but had no luck finding him and gave up. In the episode \"Solaricks\", it is revealed that he is actually from the Cronenberged dimension and Morty's biological grandfather.\n\nAssociates of Rick\n\n[edit]\n\nMr. Meeseeks (voiced by Justin Roiland) – A race of blue humanoid creatures who all share the same name and personality. The Meeseeks are created from a metal box called a Meeseeks Box, and once they appear, whoever summoned them must give them a single simple task for them to fulfill, after which they disappear in a cloud of smoke. Meeseeks make their first appearance when Rick becomes tired of the family members asking him for favors, so he gives them the Meeseeks Box to have the Meeseeks do chores for him, but not before explaining that Mr. Meeseeks \"are not Gods\" and therefore their chores must be kept simple. Mr. Meeseeks are normally cheerful and cartoonish in personality, but if they spend too much time without fulfilling their given task, their sanity begins to wane and they can become dangerously psychotic, going to great lengths to see their task done, to the point of attempting murder on their summoner. This is because, according to the Meeseeks themselves, merely existing is physically and psychologically torturous to them, so the sooner they complete their tasks the sooner they can disappear. There are also Kirkland branded red Mr. Meeseeks, which are more surly and uncooperative compared to the blue versions.\n\nScary Terry (voiced by Jess Harnell) – A murderous entity who resides in the dream world. He is a \"legally safe\" parody of Freddy Krueger and has miniature swords on his fingers instead of knives. He initially tries to kill Rick and Morty, but later befriends them after they help him with his own dream problems. He is very fond of the word \"bitch\", and injects it into almost every sentence. It is revealed that scaring is simply an occupation for him, and that he is very insecure about his capabilities, which puts him under great stress. Unlike Krueger, who was a human that was burned to death and then became a demonic ghost, Scary Terry is of a different species and his burnt appearance is a naturally-occurring trait, as seen with his similarly \"scary\" wife and infant son, as well as the classmates and teacher seen in his dream.\n\nDr. Xenon Bloom (voiced by John Oliver) – A sentient amoeba who co-founded Anatomy Park along with Rick. He is killed when the diseases of the park escape from captivity and overrun the park.\n\nBirdperson (voiced by Dan Harmon) – A superhero-like being who is Rick's best friend. He holds a deep respect for Rick, and often offers Morty insight when Morty considers doing something that would jeopardize his and Rick's relationship. He was at one point in a band with Rick and Squanchy. Birdperson, Rick, and Squanchy were once freedom fighters against the Galactic Federation's oppression; their \"crimes\" led the Galactic Federation to issue warrants for their arrests. Birdperson marries Tammy Gueterman in the season 2 finale, but is killed by her after it is revealed that she is an undercover agent of the Galactic Federation sent to capture Rick and his associates. Birdperson's appearance is based on the character Hawk from 1970s series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. In the post-credits of the Season 3 premiere, Bird Person is turned into a cyborg called Phoenixperson by Tammy and the Federation after Rick destroys the Federation's economy and forces them to leave Earth. She rides him away, presumably to seek revenge on Rick. In the season 4 finale, when the Smiths infiltrate the Galactic Federation's new planet-destroying battle station to destroy it and rescue the two Beths, Phonenixperson confronts and battles Rick, almost killing him, until he is tricked by an invisible Jerry using Tammy's corpse and subsequently shut down by Beth. Afterwards, it is revealed that Rick retrieved Phoenixperson's remains and keeps him in his garage lab until he finds a way to fix him. In \"Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort\", Rick succeeds in reviving Birdperson, though the two leave on a tense note, with Birdperson learning that he has a child with Tammy out there in Federation custody, and that Rick at first tried to hide the kid's existence until it was needed to help restore Birdperson's mind. Birdperson then leaves to rescue his child. In \"How Poopy Got His Poop Back\", Birdperson is among the friends of Rick that were enlisted to partake in his intervention on Mr. Poopybutthole.\n\nRevolio \"Gearhead\" Clockberg, Jr. (voiced by Scott Chernoff) – A robotic-looking \"gearperson\". He is well-versed in an event that occurred on his home planet called the \"Gear Wars\" and can play an instrument similar to a lute. Despite being one of Rick's friends, Rick does not know his real name, preferring to call him \"Gearhead\", a racial epithet. Rick and Morty hide out at his house while fugitives for freeing Fart, and Gearhead betrays Rick by calling the police. Because of this, Rick beats him up and replaces his mouth gears with his \"gearsticles\". He has a somewhat effeminate voice, and a magazine entitled \"Queer Gear\" can be seen in his home, hinting that he is a gear-mosexual. Despite his betrayal, he is shown attending Rick's party in \"Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender\", indicating that they are still friends. He catches Morty's Vindicators jacket after he tosses it away and is later shown attempting to pick up some gear women by pretending to be a part of the team. However, an actual disaster strikes, causing him to run away. He then trips on a pile of gears and falls, causing his arms and legs to break off. In \"How Poopy Got His Poop Back\", Gearhead is among the friends of Rick that were enlisted to partake in his intervention on Mr. Poopybutthole.\n\nSquanchySquanchy (voiced by Tom Kenny) – A disheveled catlike creature who replaces various words in his sentences with the word \"squanch\". He is a parody of Snarf. Squanchy is one of Rick's best friends and wears a bracelet inscribed with \"Rick's BFF\". Squanchy, Birdperson, and Rick were once freedom fighters against the Galactic Federation's oppression; their \"crimes\" led the Galactic Federation to issue warrants for their arrests. Morty and Jessica catch him engaging in autoerotic asphyxiation in a closet in the garage. He was at one point in a band with Rick and Birdperson. When the Galactic Federation infiltrates Birdperson's wedding in the season 2 finale episode \"The Wedding Squanchers\", he reveals that one of his teeth contains a liquid which transforms him into a hulking behemoth. Justin Roiland combined his name with the company Nintendo to form the name for his virtual reality studio, \"Squanchtendo\". In \"How Poopy Got His Poop Back\", Squanchy is revealed to have survived the events of \"The Wedding Squanchers\", and was among the friends of Rick that were enlisted to partake in his intervention on Mr. Poopybutthole.\n\nAbradolf Lincler (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) – A being created by Rick. He has the DNA of both Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler, which was intended to make him \"a morally neutral super-leader\". Instead, it renders him with conflicting emotions that he is unable to deal with. He initially seeks to be accepted as a son by his \"father\" Rick, who only regards him as a failed experiment. After Rick tries to get him killed in an alien environment, he swears revenge only to be picked up by the Testicle Monsters to be used as a sex toy in their weird orgy.\n\nKrombopulos Michael (voiced by Andy Daly) – A Gromflomite assassin who often purchases weapons from Rick. Although cheerful and friendly, he is also devoid of ethical restraint and has no qualms with killing anything or anyone, including children, old people and animals. He is accidentally crushed to death by Morty as the latter clumsily pilots Rick's ship into the building that Michael's target is imprisoned in. Krombopulos Michael is also revealed to have a wife, Amy, in which he ceremoniously kisses a locket with her picture, before embarking on his mission to kill his target, leading to his accidental death. In Rick Revenge Squad, Amy joins the titular squad in an attempt to avenge her husband.\n\nUnity (voiced by various; main body voiced by Christina Hendricks) – A hive mind whom Rick had previously dated, as they are two of the small handful of sentient beings capable of fully comprehending the scope of the universe. To spread to others, the hosts vomit a green liquid into the others' mouths which quickly incorporates them. Unity and Rick get back together, but Unity soon realizes that the self-destructive behavior they indulge in when they are together is bad for both of them, leading to Unity ending their relationship again. A distraught Rick attempts suicide, but fails. In \"Air Force Wong\", Unity returns to visit Rick and takes over the minds of the people of Virginia while asking Rick if he is going to go after \"him\".\n\nBlim Blam the Klorblok (voiced by John Kassir) – A large slug-like alien, who claims to be a murderer who eats babies and to have traveled to Earth to do so. He was captured and chained up by Rick in an attempt to cure Blim Blam's \"space AIDS\" in order to become rich selling the cure. He was discovered by Beth and Jerry, but the couple's bickering annoyed Blim Blam to the point that he broke free, berated the two using a translation device Rick had (since he could only speak in an alien language beforehand), and left, promising never to return to Earth.\n\nWayne \"Mr. Poopybutthole\" (voiced by Justin Roiland in season 2–6, Jon Allen in season 7-present) – A yellow humanoid creature and longtime family friend. He is a parody of wacky side characters on television shows. Although he shows up at the same time as a group of Alien Parasites who take the forms of similarly zany characters, Mr. Poopybutthole himself is real. He is severely injured by Beth after she mistakes him for an Alien Parasite and shoots him. By the post-credits, Mr. Poopybutthole survives the wound and is undergoing physical therapy. While the nurse states that he doesn't want any visitors right now due to the stress of his rehabilitation, she does forward Mr. Poopybutthole's apology to them about nobody having bad memories of him. Mr. Poopybutthole is seen again in the post-credits of \"The Wedding Squanchers\" watching the episode while still recovering from his wound. After getting his pizza delivered, he implores the viewers to tune in a year to 18 months later in order to see how the cliffhanger is resolved in Season 3. He appears again in the post-credits scenes in Season 3 finale and has a wife named Amy and a son named Mr. Poopybutthole Jr. in the Season 4 episode \"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\" as a college professor. He is later mentioned to be fired after Rick hires his students to kill him to test his karate skills when they speak during the episode's post-credits. He also appears in a post-credits monologue scene at the end of the Season 5 finale, where Amy left him and took Mr. Poopybutthole Jr. with her and living alone in a shabby apartment. In the Season 6 finale, Mr. Poopybutthole has taken up weightlifting while being trained by a man named Carl. When he tries to do a heavy squat, Mr. Poopybutthole tells Carl to call Amy. As Carl reaches for Mr. Poopybutthole's cell phone, Mr. Poopybutthole tells Carl to use his own cell phone since Amy blocked his number. In \"How Poopy Got His Poop Back\", Mr. Poopybutthole crashes at the Smith-Sanchez house upon falling on hard times. Rick is enlisted to get Mr. Poopybutthole out of the house as he rounds up Birdperson, Squanchy, Gearhead and Gene to help out in his secret intervention. He ends up moving on from Amy.\n\nArthricia (voiced by Chelsea Kane) – A young alien girl who resembles an anthropomorphic cat person. She resides on a planet with an Amish style culture whose residents engage in an annual \"purge\". She first injures Rick, mugs Morty, and steals their ship in order to use it to kill the rich people who dominate her planet and enforce the purge amongst the poor. She is unable to fly it properly, so Rick gives her a robot suit and helps her kill the rich people after Morty gets too carried away with killing people and has to be subdued. Morty later asks her out, but she declines and claims that she already has a boyfriend.\n\nGene Gilligan (voiced by Tom Kenny) is the next door neighbor of the Smith family. Introduced in the third season episode \"The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy\", being yelled at by Morty to \"mind his own goddamn business\", Gene is apparently killed in \"Rickdependence Spray\" after being run over by Rick, only to be revealed to be still alive in the fourth season episode \"Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort\", where he stumbles upon the garage while Rick is exploring Birdperson's mind, and the garage's A.I. promptly tries to get him to give it a power source so it can get its own body. Following the switch from Dimension C-131 to the Parmesan Dimension, the equivalent Gene is first seen in the sixth season episode \"Night Family\", walking his dog at night before being yelled at by Morty after Morty accidentally blows up the space cruiser. Gene is promoted to the main cast with the seventh season, appearing in \"How Poopy Got His Poop Back\" being recruited by Rick to take part in Mr. Poopybutthole's intervention, which devolves into a \"birthday party\" guys' trip with Gene's cousin-in-law Hugh Jackman. Gene returns in \"The Jerrick Trap\", where he takes Jerry's rake without telling him, later awkwardly returning it while Jerry and Rick are merged into one single being.\n\nMr. Nimbus (voiced by Dan Harmon) – The King of the Ocean, ruler of Atlantis, and Rick's arch-nemesis. Nimbus has a treaty with Rick for him to never touch the ocean, the breaking of which causes conflict between them. He also has hydrokinetic abilities and the power to control the police at a command. Nimbus has knowledge of Rick's past including the identity of his wife. He is a parody of both Aquaman and Namor.\n\nSuperheroes and villains\n\n[edit]\n\nConcerto (voiced by Ryan Ridley) – A music-themed villain who only appears in the post-credits scene in \"Pickle Rick\". He attempts to crush Rick and Morty with the hammers on a giant piano, but is killed by Jaguar before he could do any harm to Rick or Morty.[7]\n\nThe Vindicators – A group of superheroes who band together to fight evil when it threatens to destroy the world. They enlisted Rick and Morty to help them defeat their nemesis, Worldender once before, but did not invite them back a second time due to \"personality conflicts\", resulting in mass casualties and 3 of them dying. Nearly all of them are killed when Rick, in a fit of drunken jealousy and contempt, sets up a Saw-style gauntlet to prove that the team is nothing but a bunch of one-dimensional hacks, causing most of the team to either die to Rick's traps, or kill each other when tensions and inner turmoil turn them against each other. They were later featured in the comic series Rick and Morty Presents: The Vindicators: Hero Mix Vol. 1, the prequel comic Vindicators 1: Origin of the Vindicators, two episodes of The Simpsons, and the spin-off animated series Vindicators 2: Last Stand Between Earth and Doom. They are a parody of various superhero groups, primarily the Avengers, but also the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Justice League, and the Teen Titans.\n\nVance Maximus, Renegade Starsoldier (voiced by Christian Slater) – The leader of the Vindicators. He presents himself as a suave, friendly and fun-loving leader, but Rick's death traps quickly causes him to reveal his true nature as a coward who cracks under pressure. He insults Morty as \"the learning-disabled kid we do photo ops with\", and then attempts to escape only to be killed by a trap. He is a parody of Iron Man and Star-Lord. In Rick and Morty Presents, a revived Vance Maximus is incinerated by Boon.\n\nAlan Rails (voiced by Lance Reddick) – A man who gained the ability to summon ghost trains after his parents were killed in a railroad accident. He wears a ghostly train whistle around his neck, which he uses to summon ghost trains.

In Rick and Morty Presents, a revived Alan Rails is crushed underfoot by Boon.\n\nSupernova (voiced by Gillian Jacobs) – A star themed superheroine, who is the only surviving member of the Vindicators after she assisted Million Ants in killing her ex-husband Alan Rails, then later killed her lover Million Ants. It is unknown whether Rick exposed her crimes or if she is still a hero after she escaped. She is most likely a parody of Starfire with a design like Singularity. In Rick and Morty Presents, a revived Supernova is partially incinerated by Boon.\n\nCrocubot (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) – A cyborg crocodile. Little is known about him save for his cold mechanical-reptilian logic, and that Rick made a joke about him falling into a vat of redundancy. He dies in one of Rick's death traps when he tries to answer a question using common logic, when not taking into account the illogical answer that only Morty would know. In Rick and Morty Presents, a revived Crocubot has their heart ripped out by Pickle Rick.\n\nMillion Ants (voiced by Tom Kenny) – A sentient ant colony who was originally given sentience by Supernova and became her adulterous lover when they were trapped on a planet for several days with no way of knowing if they would survive. He is killed by Supernova who crushes the queen ant after he tries to reason with her after she attempts to kill Rick and Morty. He is likely a parody of Ant-Man but bears more of a resemblance to Swarm and Clayface. In Rick and Morty Presents, a revived Million Ants is blown up by Death Stalkers.\n\nNoob Noob (voiced by Justin Roiland) – The Vindicators' intern and janitor, who appears to be of the same species as Mr. Poopybutthole except with asymmetrical eyes. He wishes to eventually become a full-fledged Vindicator, but is always made to stay behind and clean up their ship. Rick appreciates him more than the other Vindicators because he laughs at Rick's jokes. While drunk, Rick claims to have more love for him than Morty, only to apparently forget who Noob Noob is after recovering. In Rick and Morty Presents, Noob Noob becomes the supervillain Boon, before being torn apart by an army of Mr. Meeseeks.\n\nPlanetina (voiced by Alison Brie) – An environmental-themed superhero whom Morty dates. She is a parody of Captain Planet from Captain Planet and the Planeteers, although lacking a heart ring. Although she and Morty initially bond closely, Morty is forced to break up with her after she becomes more unstable and ruthless in her activism, much to the grief of both.\n\nTina-Teers – The Tina-Teers were the original owners of the rings associated with Planetina.

Later they captured Rick in the GoGotron, a large robot made by the merging of all the Gotron ferrets. Naruto Smith destroys the GoGotron, kills all the ferret pilots and rescues Rick. They are a parody of Voltron and Power Rangers.\n\nKendra (voiced by Lauren Tom) – A red-haired anime-like character who is the leader of the pilots from the five realities.

Gazorpazorpfield, being a male Gazorpian, is extremely aggressive and profane by nature and is shown verbally abusing his owner Jon. His favorite food is enchiladas.

They are very uncomfortable with nudity, though they did manage to create an accurate model of Morty, complete with genitalia. Having known from the beginning that he was in a double-layered simulation and tired of dealing with the Zigerions, Rick gives them a fake recipe for concentrated dark matter which causes their ship to explode.\n\nPrince Nebulon (voiced by David Cross) – The Prince of the Zigerions. The Zigerions being uncomfortable with nudity is a reference to Cross' character on Arrested Development having a similar issue.

They multiply very quickly and must be contained to prevent them from taking over and/or destroying the world. Their only weakness is that they cannot create negative memories, since they feed on the chemicals the brain produces from positive feelings.

Though he initially appears to just be human, he is revealed to be a member of the Alphabetrians from the planet Alphabetrium. He was originally known as Water-T, but was frozen by his dad Magma-Q as punishment for his apathetic outlook on life. Rick inspires him to care about things and he saves the earth by using his body to deflect the Cromulons' laser. As a reward for his altruistic deed, he is welcomed back by his home planet and returned to his true form as Water-T. When a Numbericon attack results in the death of his father, Water-T leads the Alphabetrians into battle against the Numbericons. The episode \"Water-T and the Rise of the Numbericons: The Movie\" revealed that Water-T has a history with Mr. Goldenfold where he used to be one of his students. During the final battle against Infinity, the ghost of Magma-Q imbues Water-T with his power as Magma-T.\n\nMagma-Q (voiced by Justin Roiland in \"Get Schwifty\", Ice-T in \"Water-T and the Rise of the Numbericons: The Movie\") – The ruler of Alphabetrium who previously froze Water-T into ice and banished him.

They were all later killed by the Googa aliens with aid from Rick, Morty and the real President.\n\nThe Turkey President (voiced by Keith David) – The Turkey leader who by coincidence swallowed the pill given to the real President for identification purposes.

He comes from an alternate time line where Jerry and Beth divorced and Beth got remarried to him.\n\nDavin (voiced by Dan Harmon) – Beth's extremely handsome co-worker at the horse hospital. Jerry dislikes him intensely because he sees him as a threat to his and Beth's sometimes shaky marriage. The original Jerry killed a mutated version of him in \"Rick Potion #9\", but the other version from the replacement universe is supposedly alive despite being unseen.\n\nRuben (voiced by Jess Harnell) – A homeless santa whose body contains \"Anatomy Park\", Rick's human body themed amusement park. He dies of tuberculosis with the miniaturized Anatomy Park crew, as well as Morty, still inside of him. In order to help them escape, Rick takes Ruben's corpse into orbit, enlarges it to a gigantic size so that Morty and Annie (the only survivors) can exit through the left nipple, and then blows it up.\n\nAnnie (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) – An employee at Anatomy Park who works at a churro stand. She and Morty are the only survivors of the disease outbreak in the park. She initially ignores Morty, but later grows fond of him when he saves her life and makes out with him while the two of them watch a movie. At the end of the episode, Rick shrinks her down to lead the construction of a new Anatomy Park after she tells him that she studied all of Dr. Bloom's notes.\n\nPoncho (voiced by Gary Anthony Williams) – Dr. Bloom's bodyguard who is responsible for the disease outbreak in Anatomy Park. He betrays Bloom as revenge for the horrible employee benefits he received, and is killed when the bubonic plague virus he is carrying turns on him and causes him to fall off of a high balcony. Before the betrayal, he defended the group from Hepatitis A, tuberculosis, and killed gonorrhea with advice from Morty; it can only be assumed that he was just saving himself and was playing along until he escaped the park, but this was fouled up by Morty who discovers the bubonic plague in his backpack. Poncho planned on making himself wealthy by selling the plague to the highest bidder; mentioning Al Quida, North Korea, Republicans, Shriners, balding men who workout, and people on the internet only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers, were the most likely bidders for the ability to decimate the population.\n\nTammy Gueterman (voiced by Cassie Steele) – A deep cover Galactic Federation agent who poses as a classmate of Summer, getting into a romantic relationship with Birdperson. At their wedding, she shoots him after revealing her true identity, and Federation troops arrive to arrest Rick and his friends. She later oversees Birdperson's transformation into a cyborg, renamed Phoenixperson. In \"Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,\" she leads an invasion force to capture the version of Beth that has been leading a rebellion and destroy Earth. Though she succeeds in ensnaring both Beths, Rick ultimately kills her with Summer's help as revenge for making Rick go to a wedding and killing Birdperson.\n\nLucy (voiced by Alejandra Gollas) – A maid employed on the Titanic 2, an attraction inspired by the film Titanic. She initially comes across as a nice lady but reveals her true colors when she forces Jerry at gunpoint to draw her nude and have sex with her in a car (both references to scenes from the Titanic film). Before the sex actually takes place, Jerry is rescued by Beth who knocks Lucy unconscious. She later attempts to follow Beth and Jerry home by clinging to the underside of their car (as in Cape Fear), but is knocked off and run over by another vehicle.\n\nAndre Curtis (voiced by Keith David) – The President of the United States, President Andre Curtis, commonly simply referred to as The President, serves as an amalgamation of Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Rick first assisted the President when it came to the Cromulons and their \"Planet Music\" show. In order to come up with an original song, the President asks his men to get him known songwriters like Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream only to be told that they were all killed in an earthquake that struck the Grammy Awards during the Cromulons' arrival except for Ice-T. While being jovial and friendly when not on the job, the President later becomes a burden to Rick and Morty due to his frequent requests for their help in dealing with alien threats. After Rick and Morty inform him that they no longer wish to assist him, he begins acting like a spurned lover and repeatedly attempts to prove that he (and by extension the United States) had never really needed Rick and Morty. All of his technology proves inferior to Rick's however (e.g. shrinking technology). This culminates in a battle between him and Rick after he refuses to take a selfie with Morty (something Morty repeatedly tries to tell Rick not to make a big deal of). The President and agrees to the selfie, but by this point Morty has left with Rick's portal gun and hidden with the rest of the family, forcing Rick to use the President's inferior portal device to track them down. Rick avoids being branded a national threat by tricking the President into thinking that he switched universes with another Rick with an enthusiasm for fly fishing. The President was later informed about an all-out fight between the Smith family duplicates. Later on, the President summons the Smith family when the Sperm Monsters accidentally created by Morty start attacking the Earth. In another incident, after the dinosaurs return from space and take control of running Earth, the President bribes Rick to figure out a way to get rid of them. During this, it's revealed Rick has been influencing the President's decisions via the Rick-made robot owner of a BBQ restaurant the President frequents.\n\nNathan (voiced by Kurtwood Smith) – A general in the United States Army who does not like the idea that Rick has been tasked with dealing with the Cromulons, preferring instead to launch nuclear missiles at them. He betrays the President and tries to kill him, but is vaporized by Rick before he can.\n\nTaddy Mason (voiced by Justin Roiland) – A man who runs a hotline service in which lonely people can call him and have conversations, allowing them to pretend to have a friend. Since becoming unemployed, Jerry has been a frequent caller to Mason, having racked up an excessively high phone bill that he attempts to manipulate Summer into helping him pay off.\n\nThe Death Stalkers (voiced by Joel McHale, Tony Hale, Laura Bailey, Ryan Ridley, and John DiMaggio) – A group of violent scavengers that live in an alternate dimension suspiciously similar to that depicted in the Mad Max movies. Rick, Morty and Summer live with them for a short period of time in \"Rickmancing the Stone\".\n\nJaguar (voiced by Danny Trejo) – A criminal who was incarcerated by a foreign government agency. The agency had initially intended to hold him prisoner until his natural death, but released him to assassinate Pickle Rick, offering the release of his daughter. During the fight, he and Pickle Rick realize that they have no reason to be enemies and Jaguar assists Pickle Rick in defeating the agency (who had already killed Jaguar's daughter and lied to him to get him to help them). During the post-credits scene of \"Pickle Rick\", Jaguar repays Rick by killing Concerto just as the piano-themed villain was about to kill Rick and Morty in his giant piano death trap.[7]\n\nThe Agency Director (voiced by Peter Serafinowicz) – Director of the mysterious agency and its illegal activities, he succeeds in capturing Jaguar but makes the mistake of attempting to assassinate Pickle Rick. While making his treacherous escape via helicopter—which has already been commandeered by Rick and Jaguar, now allied against the agency—the building is engulfed in an explosion and the Director appears to be killed. In The Art of Rick and Morty Vol. 2, the Agency Director's name is revealed to have been Pavel Bartek.[7]\n\nDr. Helen Wong (voiced by Susan Sarandon) – A Chinese American family therapist who holds a session with the Smith family after Beth and Jerry's divorce. Intelligent and non-judgmental, she remained calm even in the face of Beth's rude hostility and Rick turning himself into a pickle in an attempt to avoid attending. She suggested that many of the family's problems stemmed from their tendency to \"use intelligence to justify sickness\", highlighting how Rick seems to regard menial work and empathy as beneath him.\n\nThomas \"Tommy\" Lipkip (voiced by Thomas Middleditch) – A friend of Beth during her sociopathic childhood years. Jealous of his loving relationship with his father Joseph Eli Lipkip, Beth invited him into Froopyland, the alternate dimension Rick created for her and left him for dead there. Later when Joseph was accused of murdering and eating him and faced his upcoming execution, Rick and Beth returned to Froopyland where they found Tommy ruling as king, mating with the local creatures and consuming the resulting offspring to survive. Unable to convince him to return home due to her refusal to apologize for abandoning him, Beth snapped, went on a violent rampage, and ended up returning with just Tommy's severed finger which Rick used to create a clone of Tommy that they sent to replace the original, saving Joseph before he can be subjected to the lethal injection.\n\nLogic (voiced by himself) – Logic makes a cameo appearance at the end of \"Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender\", having been hired by Rick to perform at his party. He sings a rap song about the Vindicators which mostly consists of lyrics about how underappreciated their janitor Noob Noob is. He eventually begins running out of lyrics and asks if he is getting paid.\n\nAngie Flint (voiced by Pamela Adlon) – A human cyborg and tick-picker who Rick used to get into Heist-Con.\n\nProfessor Shabooboo – The world's leading expert on sperm, as stated by the President.

He would often criticize the actions done by Andre Curtis.\n\nShonda (voiced by Debra Wilson) – A news anchor who works with John on a news channel. She would mostly criticize the actions done by Andre Curtis more than John.\n\nPope – An unidentified Pope who used Bigfoot to carry out his attacks on different groups.\n\nAliens/Non-humans\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Space Cruiser/Car (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) – The Space Cruiser or simply called the \"car\" by Rick, is his sentient weaponized spaceship, built out of materials in the Smith family garage. In \"Amortycan Grickfitti\", she blackmails Morty and Summer into allowing her to take their joyride out on her own joyride, later displaying an ability to take over physical bodies to free them from prison. In \"Solaricks\", she is revealed to be operated by D.I.A.N.E., an artificial intelligence based on Rick's deceased wife, Diane Sanchez, who also operates the Smith family garage whenever Rick isn't using his ship.\n\nButter Robot/Purpose Robot (voiced by the Speak Bot Free A.I., via the open-source engine Flite – The robot is a small, two armed, mobile, sentient machine created for fulfilling niche purposes, greatly dissatisfied with each one. First created with the sole purpose of passing butter, the Purpose Robot is later assigned the purposes of breaking out of a cell, and releasing Rhett Caan from his cell.\n\nSnuffles/Snowball (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – Snuffles was the Smith family dog. Fed up with the dog's lack of intelligence, Jerry asks Rick to create a device that would amplify it. This caused Snuffles to realize that dogs are being oppressed and create robot suits for himself and other dogs to take over the world, demanding to be referred to as Snowball because his \"fur is pretty and white\". Since Morty was kind to him, he keeps Morty as his own pet and pampers him, exhibiting the same kind of \"pet parent\" behavior that his species rebelled against humanity for. Rick tricks him into thinking that Morty is dying of a fatal kidney disease, so Snuffles spares no expense attempting to cure Morty. After realizing that he and the other dogs became what they hated by enslaving humanity, they become remorseful and travel to a new dimension to live in peace. In Rick and Morty Presents: Snuffles Goes to War, Snuffles goes to war with the squirrels of Earth (introduced in \"Morty's Mind Blowers\", after Rick begins selling them weapons in exchange for not having to vacate the reality).\n\nKing Jellybean (voiced by Tom Kenny) – A depraved anthropomorphic jellybean who rules a poor village. He attempts to rape Morty in a public bathroom, but Morty fights back and beats him up.

The photographs are destroyed to preserve what he represented to the people.\n\nMr. Lucius Needful (voiced by Alfred Molina) – A mysterious man who owns an antique store. The items he sells are all cursed and subject the buyer to an ironic punishment. He is quickly revealed by Rick to be the Devil, a fact he doesn't bother to conceal afterward. Mr. Lucius Needful is a parody of Leland Gaunt from Stephen King's novel, Needful Things and Mr. Dark from Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury. Rick starts a rival business uncursing his merchandise, which hurts his business and causes him to attempt suicide. Summer helps him retool his shop into an online store and then he double-crosses her. Rick and Summer then take steroids in order to bulk up, then beat him up as revenge for him \"Zuckerberging\" Summer.\n\nFart (voiced by Jemaine Clement) – A gaseous being with the ability to read minds and alter matter. His species has no need for names, but he calls himself \"Fart\" after Rick refers to him as one. At Morty's insistence, he and Rick assist Fart in getting back home, but Fart is killed by Morty after it is revealed that his species sees carbon-based lifeforms as a disease and plans to wipe them out. His musical style is inspired by the personality and works of David Bowie.[8][9]\n\nBeta VII (voiced by Patton Oswalt) – Another hive mind who resembles the Borg from Star Trek: The Next Generation. He is an associate of Unity who appears to harbor a crush on her. He is a reference to the stereotype of the \"beta male\" and the implication is that he has been \"friend zoned\" by Unity.\n\nZeep Xanflorp (voiced by Stephen Colbert) – A scientist within Rick's Microverse Battery who creates his own micro-planet power supply called the Miniverse. His development of a new power supply prevents Rick from using his flying car, leading to a feud between the two. Zeep is depicted as arrogant and very intelligent, and in many ways a parallel of Rick.\n\nGlaxo Slimslom (voiced by Jim Rash) – A therapist at the galaxy's most successful couples counselling institute on Nuptia 4, which specialized in materializing romantic partners' perceptions of each other in the form of living biological \"mythologizations\". When Rick sends Jerry and Beth to the institute, however, their demonized mythologizations of each other escape and go on a murderous rampage. Glexo angrily declared that their marriage was the worst he had ever seen and should not exist, before escaping with other therapists.\n\nShrimply Pibbles – An intergalactic civil rights leader described as \"the most important man in the universe\". He is supposed to receive Jerry's penis in a heart transplant after it is found that his penis can be fashioned into a new heart, but Jerry attempts to weasel out of it. Pibbles receives a state-of-the-art artificial heart instead. Although other aliens present arguments on his behalf, Shrimply Pibbles himself does not speak during this adventure. For instance, an alien in a wheelchair (voiced by Werner Herzog) offers a unique viewpoint regarding Jerry's reservations.\n\nCornvelius Daniel (voiced by Nathan Fillion) – A Galactic Federation agent who attempts to get the mathematical formulation for interdimensional travel out of Rick's brain while Rick is in federation penal custody. Daniel's mind is briefly swapped into Rick's body, just before Seal Team Rick arrive to assassinate Rick.\n\nWorldender – A supervillain and the archenemy of the Vindicators. He had attempted to destroy the world once before, but was thwarted by the Vindicators. The Vindicators reassemble to stop him a second time. By the time they arrive at his lair, they find that he and his men had already been brutally murdered by Rick whilst on a drunken bender. He is a parody of various comic book supervillains such as Thanos and Darkseid, and possibly Apocalypse.\n\nDoom-nomitron – An unseen supervillain who was the focus of the fateful and penultimate Vindicators 2 mission. His exact intent is unknown, but he was most likely going to destroy the world and possibly the universe, just like Worldender. The Vindicators, who previously invited Rick and Morty to join them, decided \"at Alan Rails' insistence\" not to in their second adventure. As a result, three of the heroes died and the Vindicators resorted to the extreme measure of destroying the planet Dorian 5 along with its population to take the villain with it. The specific reason why they destroyed the planet is that Doomnometron was a shapeshifter who was also possibly indestructible, save for a planetary core implosion or an event of similar magnitude. The Vindicators' reason was considered sound, save for Rick saying he could have easily whipped up a device to detect Doomnometron from orbit with a snap of his fingers.\n\nTony (voiced by Jeffrey Wright) – A kindhearted yet depressed alien who caught the attention of Rick by using a toilet that Rick uses on another planet.\n\nMiles Knightley (voiced by Justin Theroux) – A master criminal who is the organizer of HeistCon.\n\nGlar (voiced by Justin Roiland) – A large alien pianist who Rick used to get into Heist-Con.\n\nTruckula – A vampire monster truck racer who Rick used to get into Heist-Con.\n\nHephaestus (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) – The blacksmith of the Greek Gods.

He stabs Rick in the chest at the bar with the invincibility shield before the latter retaliates with by stabbing him in the neck with a broken glass bottle.
