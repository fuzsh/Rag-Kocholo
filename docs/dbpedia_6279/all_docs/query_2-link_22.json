        "text": "Cozmo is a little forklift robot who's one of Codi Newton's robots. He is Also The Main Robotic Protagonist of the Series.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nCozmo is silly, but competitive. He loves challenges and games. In 'The Obstacle Race', he competes against Vector in finishing an obstacle course.\n\nHe is also quite emotional, such as when he ends up crying in 'Try Not To Blink', and is a bit frustrated while trying to lift a block in 'Desert Island Bots'. He also enjoys being the life of the party, always sparking up jokes in their Shorts page.\n\nBiography[]\n\nTBA\n\nTechnical Details[]\n\nLivery[]\n\nCozmo is painted red and white.\n\nin \"Mods, mods, mods!\" Cozmo was still in his normal livery, but his wheels were painted black and has a fire drawing on the side of him.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAudio Files[]\n\nHorn[]\n\nFirst used Last used Sound Effect Mods, mods, mods! Mods, mods, mods!\n\nTrivia[]\n\nLike with every other character in the show, alignments are not officially said, but assuming for how he is like Overall and his roles and his behaviour overall in all the episodes he appeared in (which is all 36 episodes), it's possible that his alignment is \"Neutral Good\".\n\nHowever, like previously stated, alignments are not officially said, so take this with a pinch of salt.\n\nCozmo has shown to be liking to use Lines in Art instead of Stamps, which is what his (Presumed) older brother, Vector, prefers in opposite, as shown in Art-E pants.\n\nIn one of the joke shorts on Tiktok, which involved Cozmo and Vector, it's shown that Cozmo actually has a fear of Pythons (the snakes), which his brother Vector, however, doesn't have a fear of.[1]\n\nso this could mean that Cozmo has Ophidiophobia.\n\nStrangely, Despite usually being meant to be a hero; he did play somewhat of a on and off role in So long sucker!, purposely provoking Marv (who was just doing his job as a robot vacuum cleaner roomba to suck up the dust), getting him to chase him, not taking any of it seriously, and did it all for his own entertainment, and only stopped when Cavu intervened and told him to stop, and even then, when Marv was full, the first thought that came to Cozmo's mind was \"putting Marv in the bin\", although it most likely is a joke, it may be still a bit concerning.\n\nAlthough at the end of the episode, Cozmo also has grown a temporary grudge against Marv; as Codi and Nate congratulated Marv for doing all the cleaning when they got back home, even though Cozmo & Cavu were actually the ones who actually cleaned everything.\n\nMarv was also seemingly not interested in giving any credit to Cozmo & Cavu when it came to cleaning, hence further strengthing Cozmo's own stance against Marv that lasted for the last minute or so of the episode.\n\nIt also was likely that Marv didn't actually thought about chasing Cozmo, and was just simply cleaning up the mess that Cozmo literally put down continuously and rapidly. Although in the end of the episode, when Marv warned Cozmo to not put down another single token on the floor (thus his \"*Don't. You.*\"), with which Cozmo ignored and cut him off by putting down a token on the floor anyways, Marv genuinely seemed to be angry, and seemingly actually chased down Cozmo.\n\nHowever, it is likely that Marv, although was not happy with Cozmo placing down another token on the floor, meaning endless more mess to clean, still did not intentionally try to chase down Cozmo in the end. He simply was, again, focused on cleaning and 'sucking up the dust', which in this case, are the tokens.\n\nCozmo is shown to be quite humble at times, which is in contrast to his (Presumed) older brother Vector, who is more of on the arrogant side."
