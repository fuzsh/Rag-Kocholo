        "text": "On a remote jungle island, genetic engineers have created a dinosaur game park.\n\nNow one of mankind’s most thrilling fantasies has come true. Creatures that have been extinct for millions of years roam Jurassic Park, and all the world can visit them – for a price.\n\nBut when a catastrophe destroys the park’s defence system, what was once a scientific dream becomes a living nightmare. . .\n\nAnd scientists and tourists alike are left fighting for their lives.\n\nI am an absolutely huge fan of the Jurassic Park movies. Honestly, they are one of my favourite film series ever and I rewatch them at regular intervals, usually when I am home alone and wanting some comfort movies, as I can no longer persuade other people to watch them with me. My friend, Sandra, has been urging me to read the original book for ages, because it is one of her favourites and she thinks it is better than the movies, but I’ve never got round to it before. Then two things happened at the same time. Firstly, I was home alone again for the weekend and went back to the first three movies to keep me company. Then, the next day I saw a Twitter thread which was discussing movies which were better than the source novel and one of the films suggested was Jurassic Park. ‘Really?’ I thought, ‘That’s not what Sandra says.’ So I decided i had better find out for myself. Plus, it’s probably really embarrassing for a self-proclaimed book addict never to have read a Michael Crichton book, isn’t it? Better remedy that, asap.\n\nSo, I abandoned my pre-planned list of reads for the #20BooksOfSummer challenge again and took Jurassic Park with me on my recent holiday in Cornwall. I have to say, even though I thought I knew the story, I was absolutely hooked from start to finish and raced through it as fast as the demands of my partner that I spend quality time with him on our break would allow. (Men can be SO unreasonable!) This book is eminently readable, particularly if you have seen the movies. Firstly, the chapters are short, which always helps reading go quickly. Secondly, I was having great fun comparing the book to the movies and picking out familiar bits of the story and parts that were different (no spoilers, but there are some shocking differences!) Thirdly, the writing is just fantastic.\n\nSo, is the book better than the movie? Are the movies better than the book? Which did I prefer. Well, this may sound like a copout but I promise you it isn’t, it is my honest opinion. I liked them both equally because they are very different. Nothing will ever ruin the movies for me. I love them, they are fun and action-packed and include some of my favourite characters ever (plus Sam Neill, yum!) The books are more detailed, more complex and possibly more brutal. Some of the characters are very different (I won’t say more for fear of spoiling the story.) Some things happen differently (one, not in a good way at all!) but work effectively for the story.If you are a fan of the movies, I wouldn’t let it put you off reading the books. I have now ordered three more Michael Crichton novels to read, because his writing style hooked me in and I am keen to see what else he can do. Watch this space.\n\nJurassic Park is out now in all formats and you can buy a copy here.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMICHAEL CRICHTON the author of the groundbreaking novels Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, The Great Train Robbery, Disclosure, Prey, State of Fear, Sphere, Congo, Next and Micro among many others. His books have sold more than 200 million copies worldwide, have been translated into thirty-eight languages, and have provided the basis for fifteen feature films, most notably Jurassic Park. He directed Westworld, Coma, The Great Train Robbery and Looker, and also created the hit television series ER. Crichton remains the only writer to have a number one book, movie, and TV show in the same year.\n\nWebsite: https://www.michaelcrichton.com\n\nFacebook: Michael Crichton\n\nTwitter: @CrichtonBooks\n\nInstagram: @michaelcrichton_official\n\nBy 2037 the world’s been torn apart by global warming, religious wars and viruses. Against this turbulent setting French special agent Alex Lamarque is hunting eco terrorists attacking energy services and supply lines.\n\nBattling with personal tragedy on one hand, and the intrusion of new-found celebrity on the other, Alex must re-emerge from self-imposed exile to reunite with Mariam – the woman he loves – and Amaury – his truest friend – to face the fight of their lives.\n\nFrom the streets of Paris, the lithium mines of Southern Mali, and the mighty Aswan Dam, they come up against forces whose intentions are as devious as they are malign. Time is against them, and there’s more at stake than ever. Can they survive The Coming Storm?\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series by Greg Mosse when I read it in 2022 (you can read my review of The Coming Darkness here) so I am happy today to be shining the spotlight on the sequel to this novel, The Coming Storm, which is out today.\n\nThis book marks the return of special agent, Alexander Lamarque, following the events of the thwarted eco-terrorism plot in the first book. Not only is Alexander having to deal with personal struggles, he is now a kind of celebrity and this brings additional challenges to his work, as the world is not yet safe from the threat.\n\nI haven’t had a chance to read the new book for myself yet but it promises to be packed with the same exciting blend of tension, action, globe-hopping and great characterisation that made the first book such a riveting read and I am sure it will be equally gripping. I wish Greg a fantastic publication day and urge all his fans to go and get the book at the earliest opportunity.\n\nThe Coming Storm is out now in paperback and ebook and you can buy a copy here.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nA theatre director, playwright and actor Greg Mosse is the founder and director of the Criterion New Writing programme at the Criterion Theatre in London, running workshops in script development to a diverse community of writers, actors and directors. In addition, since 2015, Greg has written, produced and stage 25 plays and musicals.\n\nGreg set up both the Southbank Centre Creative Writing School – an open access program of evening classes delivering MA level workshops – and the University of Sussex MA in Creative Writing at West Dean College which he taught for 4 years.\n\nThe husband of the bestselling novelist Kate Mosse, Kate’s hit novel Labyrinth was inspired by a house that Greg and his mother bought together in the French medieval city of Carcassonne, where the couple and their children spent many happy summers. Following the success of Labyrinth, Greg created the innovative readers-and-writers website MosseLabyrinth. The first of its kind MosseLabyrinth was the world’s first online accessible 3D world, and the inspiration for Pottermore – the popular Harry Potter website.\n\nA multilinguist, Greg has lived and worked in Paris, New York, Los Angeles and Madrid and has worked as both an interpreter at a variety of international institutions and a teacher in the UK.\n\nGreg and Kate live in Chichester, where Kate’s parents founded the Chichester Festival Theatre, they have two grown up children.\n\nConnect with Greg:\n\nWebsite: https://www.gregmosse.com\n\nTwitter: @GregMosse\n\nInstagram: @gregmosse\n\nSix months since the earth-shattering events of The Space Between Us, the revelatory hope of the aliens’ visit has turned to dust and the creatures have disappeared into the water off Scotland’s west coast.\n\nTeenager Lennox and grieving mother Heather are being held in New Broom, a makeshift US military base, the subject of experiments, alongside the Enceladons who have been captured by the authorities.\n\nAva, who has given birth, is awaiting the jury verdict at her trial for the murder of her husband. And MI7 agent Oscar Fellowes, who has been sidelined by the US military, is beginning to think he might be on the wrong side of history.\n\nWhen alien Sandy makes contact, Lennox and Heather make a plan to escape with Ava. All three of them are heading for a profound confrontation between the worst of humanity and a possible brighter future, as the stakes get higher for the alien Enceladons and the entire human race…\n\nI am delighted to be taking my turn today on the blog tour for The Collapsing Wave by Doug Johnstone, the sequel to last year’s The Space Between Us, a book which I absolutely loved (you can read my review here). I feel like I have been waiting forever to catch up with what has happened to Lennox, Heather, Ava and Sandy since the end of the previous book, so I want to thank Anne Cater or Random Things Tours for inviting me to take part in the tour and to the publisher for providing me with an advance paperback copy of the book for the purpose of review and so I didn’t have to wait any longer! I have reviewed the book honestly and impartially as always.\n\nWow, things really aren’t looking great for the characters from The Space Between Us since we left them six months ago. Lennox and Heather are being held in a secretive military camp and are being used to find out more about the Enceladons. Ava is on trial for the murder of her ex and has been separated from her new baby and the Enceladons have gone to ground (or to sea, more appropriately. We are starting from a dark place after the hope that seemed to be on the horizon as the previous book closed. The prospect of connection and understanding that the Enceladons brought with them has come to nothing and humans are doing what humans always do, viewing anything different to them as a threat and meeting that imagined threat with threats of their own.\n\nThe first half of this book is bleak. It shines a light on the absolute worst traits of humanity – suspicion, mistrust, othering, callousness, contempt, stupidity, the list goes on. Honestly, I was absolutely horrified by the inhumanity shown by some of the characters in this book, mostly because it is all too credible. It seems highly likely that humanity, or at least a section of it, would behave exactly like this is we were visited by an alien species. In fact, we don’t even need to imagine that scenario because we can see in the world around us now exactly how human beings who come from other lands and may be slightly different to us are treated in the here and now, Doug’s writing again is a depressing reflection of the things that are actually happening around us and it makes me very sad. I was concerned, all the way through, that this book was not going to end well for the characters we have come to care about, because happy ending are in short supply in the real world these days and I found it hard to bear. I have come to care about these characters so deeply over the course of these books, I wanted them to have that happy ending. I tweeted Doug about half way through and told him I may never forgive him if the book ended badly and I meant it.\n\nBut, before you decide not to read the book in case it is relentlessly bleak and depressing, fear not. There are still good people in the world. There is still hope. Miracles do happen and redemption is not impossible, particularly if people are prepared to stand up for what they believe and risk everything for those they care about. All it takes is for people to put surface differences aside and find out what is beneath the surface, because that is what really counts. not superficial similarities or differences that are only skin deep, but what people truly think and feel, their motivations and their beliefs inside are what counts. This books asks us to look beyond the obvious for the truth at the heart of things and make our decisions based on that and on our own consciences. Being true to yourself and practising kindness and love are what will win through in the end.\n\nThe fact does all of this whilst not coming across as the least bit preachy or lecturing, and by using a completely weird, alien species to elicit these feelings from the reader if nothing short of miraculous. I tried to explain to my teenage daughter what I was reading and why I was so moved by it and there is no easy way to describe this book without it sounding insane and improbable. You have fallen in love with alien, octopus-like creatures from outer space who have come here as refugees and if they don’t survive and thrive you are going to be heart broken? Maybe you’ve spent too much time living in fictional worlds, Julie! But it’s true, that’s how I felt all the way through and I guarantee you will too if you read these books. The writing and characterisations in these novels are just sublime. The plotting is genius; all the way through I had a real and deep sense of peril for the protagonists, a converse anger and loathing towards the antagonists and a fanatical need to know the outcome. And I don’t want to leave you with the idea that the end is a fairytale, because it isn’t. That’s not how life is and the author has been nothing if not true to how the world actually works (except for the alien bit, obviously.) What the end is, is deeply satisfying to anyone who has gone on this journey with the characters from start to finish and feels true to the story. Who can ask for more than that.\n\nI loved this book as much as the first one and am so happy that I have read this series. They are definitely some of the best book I have read over the past twelve months and, beyond that, I feel like they are the books that the world needs right now. Hyperbole, you may say? I don’t think so. I really want people to read this novels, I have absolutely no doubt you will love them as much as I do and will get a huge amount from them too.\n\nThe Collapsing Wave is out now in all formats and you can buy a copy here. I highly recommend that you read The Space Between Us before coming to The Collapsing Wave if you haven’t already done so, and you can get that book here.\n\nPlease make sure to visit some of the other blogs taking part in the tour for this book:\n\nDoug Johnstone is the author of 16 previous novels, most recently The Opposite of Lonely (2023) and The Space Between Us (2023).

A time-trapped forest. Paranormal problems for a down-to-earth detective.\n\nWar waged over wi-fi. An app to die for and a fateful shirt. Musing on the rails. Hermits, caves and epic tales. Roboboats aimlessly afloat. Passengers and paintings. The keys to sunlight, and young love in sunlit Santiago. Freedom has many faces. In Taking Liberties it is met in a dozen different guises and in worlds where nothing is what it seems.\n\nThreaded through with the theme of freedom, the stories explore what it means to yearn for escape and to search for the true self, whether in the DNA or in the human soul. Mirth and myth, mystery and magic, noir and memoir shape this first offering from the Breakthrough Book Collective, a group of established and emerging authors embarking on its own journey of creative liberty.\n\nI was invited to review this book by Stephanie Bretherton and provided with a digital copy of the book for this purpose. As always, I have reviewed the book honestly and impartially.\n\nI know short stories can be divisive amongst readers, some people love them, some are not so keen. Personally, sometimes they are just what I am in the mood for, easy to dip in and out of when you may not have the time or mental focus to concentrate on a full length novel. As a writer, I also know how difficult a good short story is to write, they are a complicated art form to get right so I am always impressed when I read a good one.\n\nHere a is a collection of twelve short stories by twelve different writers, all loosely centred around the theme of freedom. Having a topic open to such wide interpretation from a range of writers with very different voices writing across different genres has produced a diverse and fascinating collection which contains something for everyone and demonstrates what a versatile narrative form the short story is.\n\nAlthough they are all very different, the stories are all extremely well written and elicit a plethora of emotions in the reader. All of human life is here, and you will be delighted by the variety of approaches the writers have taken to the prompt and where they have run with them. The illustrate perfectly how pliant the human brain is and how we all see the world from very personal slants. They got me thinking about what kind of story I might write on this subject and what freedom means to me. I might even pen down some of the ideas that came to me, so if there is a Taking Liberties, Volume 2, I’ll be ready!\n\nFor anyone who appreciates the short story as an art form and is on the look out for a new collection, I highly recommend this one.\n\nTaking Liberties is out now in ebook and paperback formats and you can buy a copy here.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nContributors:\n\nStephanie Bretherton\n\nJamie Chipperfield\n\nSue Clark\n\nJason Cobley\n\nStevyn Colgan\n\nSamuel Dodson\n\nA.B. Kyazze\n\nVirginia Moffatt\n\nIvy Ngeow\n\nEamon Somers\n\nPaul Waters\n\nPJ Whiteley.\n\nIt’s our world, but decades into the future …\n\nAn ordinary world, where cars drive themselves, drones glide across the sky and robots work in burger shops. There are two superpowers and a digital Cold War, but all conflicts are safely oceans away. People get up, work, and have dinner. Everything is as it should be…\n\nExcept for seventeen-year-old John, a tech prodigy from a damaged family, who hides a deeply personal secret. But everything starts to change for him when he enters a tiny café on a cold Tokyo night. A café run by a disgraced sumo wrestler, where a peculiar dog with a spherical head lives alongside its owner, enigmatic waitress Neotnia…\n\nBut Neotnia hides a secret of her own – a secret that will turn John’s unhappy life upside down. A secret that will take them from the neon streets of Tokyo to Hiroshima’s tragic past to the snowy mountains of Nagano.\n\nA secret that reveals that this world is anything but ordinary – and it’s about to change forever…\n\nI’ve been so excited to read this book and take my turn on the blog tour because I’ve read such amazing reviews of this title and it sounded really different and intriguing. My thanks to Anne Cater of Random Things Tours for offering me a place on the tour and to the publisher for my digital copy of the book, which I have reviewed honestly and impartially.\n\nIt’s getting harder and harder to write reviews for Orenda Books. Honestly, I’m starting to approach them with trepidation because my words feel entirely inadequate to convey the feelings that the writing published by this imprint arouses in me of late and no one wants to write a review that fails to do a stunning book justice. But I’ve made a promise to do it so I’ll have to find something to say. Just know, what I write here isn’t going to come anywhere close to describing how startlingly brilliant this novel is and just how much it moved me. To be honest, I haven’t fully processed the experience myself yet.\n\nThe book is set in Japan, in a future a few decades distant, in a world that resembles ours but has moved on so far that parts of it are unrecognisable. You’ll have to read the book yourself to decide whether advancements in technology have improved or imperilled the world, but what I can say is that the author has built a world here that is a seamless blend of beautiful and terrifying, recognisable and alien, appealing and repellent, all at the same time. It takes a Japan that has intrigued and beguiled outsiders for centuries and brings it to life on the page, then fires it into a future that is entirely too easy to imagine.\n\nOur guide through this world is John, an American teenage computer prodigy who is visiting the country for the first time as he negotiates the sale of his computer code to Japanese tech giant, putting the reader firmly in the shoes of an outsider learning about the society as he stumbles through it. Alone and lonely, he ventures into a quirky cafe and meets a girl who is going to change his life. How this happens and where that relationship will take them both, you’ll have to read the book to find out and more fool you if you don’t do so, because this book will take you places you have never been before – intellectually and emotionally – and leave you reeling with feelings you will not have expected when you began to read and which will be hard to process.\n\nThis book is such a hard book to define or explain. Part love story, part thriller, part sci-fi, part exploration of what it means to be a human, it is complex and beautiful and heart-breaking and intellectually demanding. The relationship between John and Neotnia will make you feel joy and pain and love and sorrow and make you question just what it is that draws one soul to another, and whether love can overcome any obstacle in its way. Is it possible to love the things in another that you hate in yourself? What if the person you love turns out not to be who you thought they were? What tears people apart and keeps them together?\n\nAside from the relationship between the two main characters, and the subordinate ones who round out the cast, this book is about the world, where it is, where it is going and how people treat one another. This is a subject that must be at the forefront of most of our minds in these turbulent times, as those in power seem to become crueller and crueller and it can be hard to see any good in the world, until you look closer at the individuals who make up society. There you can see flashes of kindness and generosity, of love and friendship that restore you faith in the world and make you believe that things might be okay. It is to the goodness within individuals we need to look to curb the cruelness of the mob and preserve humanity as something above the base. This book explores these themes, about how the actions of one person can change the course of history.\n\nThis book hurt my heart and lifted me up at the same time. The writing is just beautiful, the world building impeccable, the characterisation so compelling that I read this book in one sitting because I was so invested in the people and the relationships depicted within. But beyond all this, this book made me feel that I am not alone. That there are other people out there who have the same thoughts and fears about the direction the world is taking and what could be looming in the future but, whilst these concerns are real and profound, that there is still a thread of hope that runs through it all and that, if we stick together, we can make the future better if we learn from the past.\n\nBeautiful Shining People is out now in all formats and you can buy a copy here.\n\n(This is an affiliate link so I may earn a small amount of commission should you buy through it.
