        "meta_description": "https://terryshepherd.com/ \nBIO: I’m a writer and editor by trade, living in Jacksonville, Florida with my beautiful wife. Between the two of us, we earn enough to keep the lights on, pay the Internet bill and share adventures together. Except for a few excursions and some daily cardio, I spend every free minute in front of a keyboard, spilling out the contents of my disordered mind. Someday maybe it will coalesce into something with commercial appeal. I’m ok if it doesn’t. Jessica Ramirez is my “protagonist”, what we call our heroes and heroines in the trade. Yes, she patterened after a real Latina cop and I base her on actual events in that cop’s life. To protect the innocent, I weave a composite of traits and adventures in the lives of some amazing police women I’ve had the honor of knowing. Jess has had her share of troubles navigating her career in a department that is one of the last bastions of overt male chauvinism. She’s far from perfect, but has a good heart and a desire for both justice and compassion. Her wild hair tendencies get her into trouble. “La Familia Ramirez” is her rock and her best friend and sometime partner Ali Clark is a confidant and fellow troublemaker. Check out Jess’ Journal to get to know her a little better. I hope it will inspire you to want to read “Chasing Vega”, her first adventure and “Chasing the Captain”, the one I’m trying to finish now. I also write stuff for kids. My grandson asked me one day if I had a job. I spend a lot of time with him and with his sister, so it was natural that he might think I was a slacker. When I told him I wrote books, he asked if I could write one for him, so he could be a star. “Hudson and the Missing Tiger” became the first in what will be “The Waterford Detective” series for elementary school kids. And when the Pandemic came upon us, I wanted to create something that could teach children habits that could help protect them from the Coronavirus. I grew up loving Dr. Seuss and with the help of my brilliant illustrator - son-in-law, Casey Ratchford, we created two books in “The Mystery Bug Collection”. “Juliette and the Mystery Bug” teaches proper hand-washing and nose-blowing. And “Juliette and the Masked Hero” teaches about Masking and Social Distancing. I wrote both books in the anapestic tetrameter style of the good Doctor and are available, along with everything I write at Amazon. The Mystery Bug series became so popular that we created mystery-bug.com as a place where parents and educators can find lesson plans for the classroom and more resources to help create productive conversations with kids about Covid19. You can tell that my adventures in fiction have been unfocused and a little crazy. That’s ok. I’m often unfocused and crazy. I don’t expect to get rich doing this stuff. I do hope that what I write touches your heart and perhaps gives you an escape from this uncertain world we live in. #JessicaRamirez #TerrySheperd #ChasingKarma #ChasingCaptain #THEMYSTERYBUG",

From a very early age I invented characters and composed scenes and stories in my head. At about 10 years old I first saw my own words printed--in the grammar school newsletter that I co-founded, typed, and published. Around the same time I decided to combine my theatrical and my writing ambitions, and adapted all my favourite youth novels into scripts.Since then many, many more words have been published: novels, nonfiction articles on British history and travel and theatre, website content, book and film reviews, my M.A. thesis, advertising copy...and more.I live with my husband and our two mixed-breed dogs in an architecturally unique, book-filled home in a lovely and historic New England city. A favorite retreat--and my preferred writing location for many months of the year--is our rustic cottage beside one of our region's largest and most scenic lakes. We return annually to Great Britain, with London serving as our base in recent years, although formerly it was Bristol.\n\nVOX VOMITUS: Sometimes, it's not what goes right in the writing process, it's what goes horribly wrong.

Smart, full of character, vibrant. You will feel, you will feel big, and you will return, too, to the richest moments of your own history, landmarks that bring you to both smile and weep. –Josh Malerman New York Times best-selling author of Bird Box and Daphne I compulsively read anything Jennifer Anne Gordon writes. Like the best contemporary filmmakers stitching together grief and horror, her storytelling is a sharp needle that both pierces and tugs us close. Compulsive and genre-slashing, with exquisite, rhythmic prose, THE JAPANESE BOX is an extraordinary exploration of alone-ness that beats and breathes: grief is horror, grief is love. We as readers are drawn ever closer to this beautifully haunted narrator until we're face-down in the box with her. Does she feel us? She thinks she is alone. We all think we are alone. By the end we've become the ghosts in her black room, reaching out to gently touch her hair and whisper we're here. -Diane Zinna, author of The All-Night Sun From the author of the Kindle Award Winning Novel for Best Horror 2020 —Beautiful, Frightening, and Silent—and Pretty/Ugly— Winner of The Kindle Award for Best Novel 2022 (Reader’s Choice) comes a collection of short stories contemplating horror, grief, and trauma. Simulacrum is a dark comedic tale about college life, and love. It is the story of what happens when two sociopaths attend art exhibits, drink lemon vodka, and spar over everything and anything. Periods. Coloring books. Art. This is the story of our unnamed narrator…an origin story of a would-be, hopes to be, serial killer. The Japanese Box is a story that blends memoir, creative nonfiction, and the horror of a coming-of-age story, and a coming of middle-aged story. Imagine growing up with a reflection that is often absent, and a Japanese box that is filled with things that should never have been there. Memories. Violence. The Japanese Box is a love letter to anxiety, trauma, grief, and longing. It is a story of a child becoming an adult, and all the ghosts and misfortunes that happen in order to survive. The Lithium Moon: Simone is an artist by day, and an emotionally abused wife at night. She is a successful artist with a long history of schizoid effective disorder with bipolar tendencies. When her marriage goes from good to bad, she suffers her first miscarriage. The tragedy coincides with a wolf moon—Trauma and magic converge seem to converge in Simone’s head. This story explores sadness, illness, hallucinations, full moons, and the creative process. What Stage of Grief is not a poem, or a song, but a dirge. Fantasy and facts, this poem walks a fine line between nightmares and memories. Grief stories and love stories. Dogs, and drama. Nightmares, and nevermore. Normally, Jennifer Anne Gordon is our host, but today, she switches seats to be interviewed by co-host Allison Martine Hubbard to delve into the depths of THE JAPANESE BOX.

All I knew was that I was whisked to the famous “glass island” on an overcrowded, stinky boat. I waited behind two dozen tourists to pay an exorbitant price for a little glass fish—what a bewildering experience! Still, it was the artistic traditions of the world that lured me to travel and inspired me to pursue art history. Today, my mission is to EDUCATE, ENTERTAIN, and INSPIRE with the stories of art history, both real and imagined. Join me at lauramorelli.com to read a free story, take an online art history class, or to learn more about my work. Thank you!

I decided I wanted to be a fiction writer when I was five years old and spent my childhood and adolescence learning how to tell stories. At Cornell University I wrote what would become my first published novel, Fool on the Hill, as my senior thesis in Honors English. My professor Alison Lurie helped me find an agent, and within six months of my college graduation Fool on the Hill had been sold to Atlantic Monthly Press. Through a combination of timely foreign rights sales, the generous support of family and friends, occasional grant money, and a slowly accumulating backlist, I’ve managed to make novel-writing my primary occupation ever since. My third novel, Set This House in Order, marked a critical turning point in my career after it won the James Tiptree, Jr. Award, a Washington State Book Award, and a Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award, and helped me secure a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. My fourth novel, Bad Monkeys, also won multiple awards; it is currently under development as a Universal Studios film, with Margot Robbie attached to star. My sixth novel, Lovecraft Country, has been adapted as an HBO series by Misha Green, Jordan Peele, and J.J. Abrams. In 1998 I married my best friend, the researcher and rare-book expert Lisa Gold. We live in Seattle, Washington.\n\n#Matt Ruff #TheDestroyerofWorldsAReturntoLovecraftCountry #LovecraftCountry #TheDestroyerofWorlds\n\nVOX VOMITUS: Sometimes, it's not what goes right in the writing process, it's what goes horribly wrong.
