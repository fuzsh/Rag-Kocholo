        "text": "With her 2019 Booker Prize-winning novel Girl, Woman, Other, Bernardine Evaristo immediately became one of my favorite living writers. It is my mission to read the rest of her bibliography before I die, which shouldn’t be too hard seeing as I’m 27 and she’s written a total of 8 novels. I have time, right?\n\nMr. Loverman was a perfect novel to start reading during Pride month. It’s about a “Caribbean queen” named Barrington “Barry” Jedidiah Walker, husband to Carmel Walker, father to Maxine and Donna Walker, grandfather to Daniel, and closeted lover to his childhood buddy Morris. The book moves from Barry’s first-person perspective to a second-person perspective about Carmel. Evaristo offers her signature hybrid of prose and poetry underpinned with themes of intergenerational strife, family dysfunction, secrecy, sexual identity, depression, and the clash of assimilation and the preservation of culture.\n\nIt pains me to say that I did not enjoy reading this. There were moments that worked, mainly the sections with Daniel and Maxine interacting with Barry. Evaristo penetrates uncomfortable subject matter with ease and allows the reader to live in the spaces of empathy within the most egregious characters. She is able to show us how each person is flawed and simultaneously a victim and a perpetrator of abuse. I loved how the protagonists are all above the age of 70, demonstrating that love and lust are still realities for septuagenarians. It’s so important to have queer stories featuring queer couples above the age of 19 that end in happiness and not suicide. It’s even more important to see people of color in those stories. Evaristo touches on mental health issues in the Black community with searing honesty, too.\n\nHowever, I couldn’t help but feel the plot was contrived. The characters were symbols instead of people. Maxine was the uber-progressive daughter who sided with her father, Donna was the conservative-ish and perpetually single daughter who sided with her mother, Daniel was the young and even more liberal, aspiring politician, Carmel was the nagging wife, and Barry was the alcoholic, unfaithful husband. I wished there were more conversations between Morris and Barry for me to be fully invested in their relationship, since that was the backbone of the novel.\n\nWhat killed me most was the constant elder abuse that masqueraded as comedy. None of it was funny to me. Donna was AWFUL to her father and it seemed unrealistic that she wouldn’t even try to hear his point of view. Her backstory didn’t excuse her behavior. Barry’s clear alcohol abuse was also not funny at all to me. It was depressing envisioning an elderly man at home alone drinking himself to death to then be harassed by his ungrateful, spoiled kids. To make it worse, there was awful body shaming towards Maxine and sexism towards Donna, who regrettably embodied the stereotype of the “angry Black woman.” Every character was a mess, but Carmel was the messiest. (Well…actually maybe Donna??) There’s no denying she was suffering with her own mental health issues in her marriage, but she was undoubtedly guilty of verbally abusing her husband, too. I was hoping the book would at some point deconstruct these issues seriously, but that moment never came. If this was a dark comedy, the humor went right over my head.\n\nBarry is closeted and very, very misogynist and homophobic. From my understanding, this setup is meant to break the stereotypes that 1) all Black people think the same (read: all are liberal and progressive) and 2) all gay people think the same (read: are open-minded). I recently watched the new webisode of The Grapevine about Black trans women, and the guest speakers (all trans women of color) at the end acknowledged the diversity of opinions within their community, that some trans women are deeply offended by misgendering pronouns while others are not, that some trans women are open to teaching non-Black allies while others feel it should no longer be their burden, etc. I think the same concept applies to Mr. Loverman. Barry and his wife belong to a more conservative line of thinking, which is not directly linked to their Antiguan upbringing, their religious beliefs, or the norm for people their age (as one would think). Morris’ progressive views shatter those expectations.\n\nAdditionally, Barry’s conservatism is a sign of how deeply ingrained systems of oppression affect people of color. Members of the LGBTQIA+ community are just as capable of perpetuating heteronormativity as straight folks are. We all have some level of unlearning to do.\n\nAgain, this novel needed a more obvious and thorough criticism of the harmful language the characters used. Reading the book was like listening to that one problematic friend you have who uses comedy to mask pain go on and on and on about the awful things they’re suffering, when you just need them to for once submit to the emotion in order to better themselves, because you know they’re getting nowhere until that moment comes. I expected much more from Mr. Loverman, but I won’t let this deter me from continuing to read more Evaristo.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nSmall Island (2004) by Andrea Levy—presents the difficulties of young Jamaican immigrants in the UK\n\nDa 5 Bloods (2020), dir. by Spike Lee—Delroy Lindo plays an elder Trump supporter and his pathology is handled with utmost sincerity\n\nOddly enough, Schitt’s Creek—Barry’s convoluted language reminded me so much of Moira’s manner of speaking; Barry’s role in the family is similar to Johnny’s role as the family punching bag; David+Alexis is basically Maxine.\n\nThe Grapevine episode mentioned in review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11WAvPMR64w\n\n“[I wanted] to write about communities that were familiar to me and people that were familiar to me. I wanted to write about communities of color. I wanted to write about girls. I wanted to write about friendship and all of these things that I felt like were missing in a lot of the books that I read as a child.”\n\nJacqueline Woodson, 2009\n\n“Guess that’s where the tears came from, knowing that there’s so much in this great big world that you don’t have a single ounce of control over.”\n\nsaid by Po’Boy, Red at the Bone, page 49\n\nA kaleidoscope of Black experiences and parenthood, Red at the Bone by Jacqueline Woodson is a sharp, layered novel about growing up, the tough decisions and revelations that come with it, and the responsibility we all have to our ancestors and their sacrifices.\n\nThe novel’s fragmented narrative style is figuratively and literally tied together by the sixteen-year-old character Melody. She is the unplanned product of her parents Iris and Aubrey’s teenage tryst. At Melody’s coming-of-age celebration, Iris and Aubrey find themselves reflecting on their own relationship and mistakes and confronting their growing fears about their maturing daughter. The hosts of the celebration are Grandma Sabe and Grandpa Po’Boy, both of whom remember how their lives were affected by Melody’s birth and how much time has passed since they too were young and madly in love. Each character has his or her own pitch in the prosaic song, much like the creaky last rung on the staircase Melody notices in her grandparents’ house. The notes and the characters, though different, all share an identity and a lineage. Woodson weaves together these five characters’ perspectives with a fluid and poetic dexterity.\n\nIt’s remarkable just how many important themes Woodson packs into such a short novel (my hardback is only 196 pages long!). One such theme is social class. Aubrey comes from a low-income background and relies on government social programs, while Iris’ family is comfortably middle class and highly educated. Iris is always correcting people’s grammar, while Aubrey is more prone to slang. Iris was destined for university, while Aubrey contemplated crime. Chapter Six, in which Iris first visits Aubrey’s mom’s small apartment, touched me personally. Here’s an excerpt:\n\n“Until he’d been inside Iris’s house with its upright piano beneath framed portraits of ancient family members, he hadn’t thought of him and his mama as poor. But now, in the dim room, with Iris breathing gently at his shoulder, he could see that was the case. He reached behind himself for Iris’s hand. The strange thing was the shame that came with knowing this. He tried not to inhale the cheap Lysol smell, tried not to look at the vase filled with dusty plastic flowers.” –said by Aubrey, page 76\n\nI know the feeling of thinking there’s nothing wrong with the way you live until you see what’s “normal” for other people and how their luxuries compare to yours. To this day, two of the most annoying, presumptive (but totally normal) questions I’m met with are: “Do you have any plans for the weekend?” and “What are you doing over (summer/winter/spring) break?” Obviously, no one ever means it maliciously; it’s a simple enough question. I’ve always felt the pressure of needing to have a cool (read: expensive) activity as my response. The thing is….my mom and I never had money to do anything on the weekend or breaks, except maybe going to Wendy’s and a movie to splurge. Growing up my couch had holes in it that my grandma patched up with pieces of a pillowcase. And now that I’m older, I still am quite broke and living on a tight budget, though I’m by no means living in poverty. I think people sometimes need to realize that their innocuous questions point to a deeper privilege they aren’t aware of. Woodson captures these financial insecurities so well in Aubrey, and juxtaposes his feelings with his proud and unabashed mother.\n\nAnother important theme that Woodson explores is Black love and dark skin love, in particular an appreciation for dark-skinned women. There is nothing wrong with interracial relationships, but too often the media and even communities of color praise light-skinned people and the relationships that most likely will create these “pretty” light-skinned people. Red at the Bone instead gives us two (and a half?) Black couples in love with each other’s dark brown skin, big black eyes, voluptuous hair, and plump lips. Characters wish they could be darker while the light-skinned characters, like Aubrey’s mom, reject this fair part of themselves. Even the high school interracial “relationships” between Black basketball players and white girls are revealed to be private moments of fetish-exploration than demonstrations of true love. Malcolm, Melody’s best friend and her date to her coming-of-age celebration, pretty much sums up how society treats dark-skinned women, but makes sure to emphasize that there’s nothing wrong with Melody’s skin complexion: “White boys can’t see you and the brothers just stupid, but you’ll get your fuck on. Trust.” (174)\n\nRed at the Bone is also a book about Black spaces. It touches on wealth and education disparity within cities, the inevitably segregated integrated educational system, HBCU’s versus predominantly white institutions, and the diversity of the Black experience. Moreover, Woodson explores old age and queerness, life and death, and the weight of one’s personal decisions on one’s offspring. There’s a beautiful sense of interconnectivity between generations in a way that I’ve only seen Bernardine Evaristo master in Girl, Woman, Other.\n\nI won’t spoil the book’s ending, but I’ll say it blew me away and will touch anyone with a heart.\n\nMarketed as a feminist retelling of Homer’s The Iliad as seen through the eyes of Achilles’ war prize, Queen Briseis, The Silence of the Girls by Pat Barker is actually a novel that unintentionally enables the silencing of women by granting Achilles an opportunity to become even more fleshed out than he was in The Iliad.\n\nOf the book’s three parts, only one is told solely from Briseis’ first-person point of view. The other two switch back and forth between hers and a third person account of Achilles’ side of the story. If this was a literary experiment to show us how men go out of their way to interfere in spaces they were never invited (in this case, a woman’s self-portrait), then I wish Barker would have saved it for another time. Honestly, I’ve never wanted to read The Iliad more than I did while reading this book.\n\nThe last sentence of The Silence of the Girls suggests that Barker chose to include Achilles’ perspective because Briseis’ story as it related to him was never her story to begin with. It was a man’s story and she was forced into it to serve as a scapegoat for male sins. In her words, “Once, not so long ago, I tried to walk out of Achilles’s story—and failed. Now my own story can begin.” (291) I’d argue that as Alcimus’ wife (in a marriage arranged by Achilles) and as mother to Achilles’ child, there’s no escaping playing a supporting role in a man’s world, specifically in Achilles’ world. How is Briseis’ new life more independent than her previous one? I don’t feel hopeful that her narrative will change. As she says in the book’s penultimate sentence, “So I turn back on the burial mound and let [Alcimus] lead me down to the ships.” (291) Congratulations Briseis, you’ve attained enough freedom to allow your husband to lead you. You do realize, though, that you’re still being led, right?\n\nAside from shifting to Achilles’ perspective in Part Two, the story of the slave women begins to be overshadowed by Achilles’ and Patroclus’ queerbaiting relationship—one that has already been written to death by so many scholars. Unfortunately, it is not as riveting or progressive as Barker thinks it is. Parts of it were straight up histrionic, it took me a few minutes to recover from my eyerolls. I’m unsure what Barker wanted me to gain from her cliché exploration of a male friendship. She kept it vague enough that the homosexuality remained pure speculation amongst the other characters. Yet, the men’s relationship clearly wasn’t platonic either.\n\nI am by no means a classicist, but even I knew that homosexuality was common in ancient Greece. You bet I was perplexed when I came across the following passage from Briseis after she caught Achilles and his step-brother sharing an intimate moment:\n\n“I stepped back into the shadows. I knew I’d stumbled on something too private to be witnessed. There were always those, then and later, who believed Achilles and Patroclus were lovers. Theirs was a relationship that invited speculation: Agamemnon, in particular, couldn’t leave it alone, though Odysseus was nearly as bad. And perhaps they were lovers, or had been at some stage, but what I saw on the beach that night went beyond sex, and perhaps even beyond love. I didn’t understand it then—and I’m not sure I do now—but I recognized its power.” – Briseis (65-66)\n\nOh, you mean private, never-before-witnessed moments like these?\n\nI highly doubt that Agamemnon and Odysseus—calm, intelligent, wise Odysseus of all people!!— were losing sleep over something as banal as pederasty. Did Barker even try to research???\n\nThe Silence of the Girls being touted as a work of feminist fiction is frustrating to say the least. It reads like a novelization of a PhD thesis that examines the role of women in Homer’s epics. There were too many egregious feminist clichés scattered about, desperate to pass as nuggets of enlightenment, but coming across as obvious and superficial, almost as if Barker didn’t trust the reader to figure out for herself what the subtext was. Here are just a handful of the least offensive examples:\n\n“We-ell, she had a pretty good idea what [the men] were thinking—the same thing they’d been thinking since she was ten years old. Oh, yes, I got that story too. Poor Helen, raped on a riverbank when she was only ten. Of course I believed her. It was a quite a shock to me, later, to discover nobody else did.” (112)\n\nIf this were made into a film, I can imagine that during the delivery of that last line, the actress would pause for a few seconds after the word “discover,” lower her voice, and dramatically utter “…nobody else did,” just as the camera zooms into an extreme close up of her wet irises.\n\nAnd just how daft can Briseis be? She’s a sex slave, living amongst men who normalize rape and abuse women every single day, and she was shocked that they didn’t believe Helen??? Come on!\n\nHere’s another on-the-nose, “men are trash” moment: “There was a legend—it tells you everything, really—that whenever Helen cut a thread in her weaving, a man died on the battlefield. She was responsible for every death.” (114)\n\nWhich leads to Briseis’ very presumptuous line: “[Achilles] was blaming me for Patroclus.” (188)\n\nThe implication here is that just as Homer wrote off Helen as the cause of the battles waged by men, so too was Briseis. I fundamentally agree that men throughout history have villainized women and blamed them for their own mistakes, but I think it is a bit naïve to attribute Achilles’ rage simply to good ol’ sexism. As if the only reason Achilles could have possibly blamed Briseis for Patroclus’ death was because she was a woman. It’s clear to me that he was ready to kill and blame anybody in the direct or indirect path that lead to Patroclus’ death. If Briseis were a man, he’d hate him the same. I mean, it’s not like Hector got off easy!\n\nPat Barker ultimately twisted Briseis’ inner monologue to reflect her own personal issues with Homer and men in general. Not once did I feel like I was reading a woman’s point of view from the 12th century BC; that it was written by a woman in the #MeToo era was crystal clear to me. The jarring and vulgar anachronistic phrases, like Greek men referring to breasts as “knockers” (18) and calling people “bugger,” did nothing to help.\n\nI’ll try to end on some more positive notes. Despite the book’s faults, Pat Barker isn’t a terrible writer. I found her prose to be quite strong and lush with vivid imagery. The way she described the rat plague and Myron’s wounds at the beginning made my skin crawl. She has a knack for finding the most poignant of metaphors to aid her in this visualization.\n\nIt was effective, in the midst of the Agamemnon and Achilles argument, for her to switch from Briseis’ to Achilles’ points of view, thereby repeating the same action. That way we could observe how differently the characters perceived the world.\n\nAchilles described the entrance of Odysseus and Ajax as follows: “Odysseus stepped into the firelight, closely followed by Ajax. Odysseus short, lean, muscular; Ajax: immensely tall, freckles dotting his nose like gnat bites, grinning to reveal a mouthful of large white uneven teeth.” (135) While Briseis observed: “Ten or fifteen feet away, Ajax and Odysseus were standing side by side, Odysseus ferret-thin and dark; great, blond, raw-boned Ajax towering over him.” (131)\n\nAchilles is preoccupied with physique, which itself is a sign of status and power. His bias against Ajax is evident in his focus on his less-than perfect teeth and freckles. Briseis is precise, noting just how far away the men were from her. Her descriptors are more complex—“ferret-thin”, “raw-boned”—they allude to something; they require you to use your imagination. Achilles is a bit simple. These passages worked in exactly the way the feminist clichés didn’t: they allowed readers to figure out their literary purpose for themselves. These are the kind of subtleties I appreciate.\n\nThough she has the tendency to lean on melodrama, Barker finds a way to evoke sympathy for most characters, whether they deserve it or not. Two of my favorite scenes were of Apollo’s priest and Hector’s elderly father invading the camp to beg for the return of their family members. As a reader, I found my emotions swelling up, even in the climactic deaths of Patroclus and Achilles. It takes a hell of a good writer to accomplish that, and I can’t take that away from Barker.\n\nDirected by David Yates, 134min, UK/USA\n\n*This review contains spoilers.\n\nI had such a fun time watching 2016’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. My inner Harry Potter nerd tingled with excitement once I realized the projected five-film (!!!) franchise was leading up to the epic 1945 duel between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald. I was fascinated by the idea of Credence as an Obscurial and how that could explain Ariana Dumbledore’s mysterious and tragic death, which was mentioned in Deathly Hallows. All the whimsy and innocent, witty humor present in the original works was in this new output, and Eddie Redmayne was the most appropriately-cast, endearing Hufflepuff they could have found to play Newt Scamander. Sure, the plot didn’t have as much at stake as any of the original stories, but I was still as swept away by the magic as I have been since 2000.\n\nTo say I was excited to see the sequel is an understatement. When I saw the overwhelmingly negative reviews it’s received, my heart sank. It couldn’t possibly be that bad, right??\n\nWelllll….\n\nOkay, it was kind of a mess. For starters, cinematographically, I’m not sure what Philippe Rousselot had in mind by framing most shots so that the very tops of people’s heads were cut off. Could that have been a fault on the part of the theater (improperly aligned projector? Incorrect image settings? Offput masking?)? Also did he have to wash out every light-skinned Black actress so that they appear white?\n\nMany people have voiced their problems with the film’s pacing, and while I was never bored with it, I don’t disagree that this all-too-important storytelling aspect needed fine-tuning. The majority of the movie involved characters talking about backstory, interspersed with random bursts of short-lived action that gave rise to more talking. I guarantee that a lot of the backstory and dialogue will fly over people’s heads, since it requires some in-depth knowledge of the established lore. J.K. Rowling needs to understand that although it might be thrilling for a small subset of hardcore fans (read: me) for the film’s two big twists to be about family trees, the majority of audiences (including the rest of the fandom and every other causal moviegoer) will find it unsatisfying and will have no idea what is going on. I’ll repeat that I wasn’t bored by the pace, but then again, I’m one of those people who couldn’t wait to read about everyone’s OWLS results in book six, so make of that what you will.\n\nI normally love the makeup, costumes, and production design in every Harry Potter film; they are a large part of what bring this world to life. Crimes of Grindelwald had some nauseating steampunk elements that I think were due to Johnny Depp’s involvement in the project…but that’s just me speculating😉. Why oh why did Grindelwald have to vape on a skull?? What was the point of that Ministry of Magic cleaning mechanism? Why did Grindelwald look like he was in a Tim Burton movie?? WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON WITH NICOLAS FLAMEL?? Tell me he doesn’t look positively insane:\n\nSpeaking of Nicolas Flamel, did anyone else find it hilarious and absurd when he came out of nowhere and revealed that he’d been the resident of Dumbledore’s safe house the entire time? I feel like he could have introduced himself much sooner than that. It seems like J.K. Rowling threw that in there after a last-minute rewrite because she needed a way to somehow justify the existence of this franchise by referencing events and people that happen/appear in the originals. Why do you even need the expertise of an alchemist to understand advanced wandlore for the climax scene?? Shouldn’t you reach out to Ollivander or Gregorovitch??\n\nAnother major weakness was the structure of the film. There are literally over 20 plots! We’ve got the Newt and Tina will-they/won’t-they romance, Newt’s and Leta’s unrequited love, Newt’s and Theseus’ potential sibling rivalry spurred on by the fact that Leta loves Newt but is engaged to Theseus, Bunty’s crush on Newt, Dumbledore convincing Newt to fight on his side, Grindelwald trying to recruit Credence, Credence searching for his mom, Nagini being abused in the freak show, whatever is going on with Credence and Nagini, Newt and his rocky relationship with the Ministry of Magic, Leta’s lonely Hogwarts days, Kama’s Unbreakable Vow that requires him to kill Corvus, Tina tracking down Credence, the Queenie and Jacob romance, Nicolas Flamel joining the fight, Dumbledore’s and Grindelwald’s complicated history and potential romance, the Ministry-appointed bounty hunter looking for Credence, the Lestrange family tree backstory, the Ministry’s search for Grindelwald, MANCUSA’s search for both Credence and Grindelwald, etc. Ben and John from SuperCarlinBrothers said it best when they said that this sequel would be more enjoyable if we had immediate access to the next film. But because we have to wait two years for the next installment, it feels like an underdeveloped, expository filler episode in a TV series that’s crammed with loose ends. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPPrdpGmZhY&t=693s)\n\nAccording to Crimes of Grindelwald, the Memory Potion that Newt used on Jacob didn’t work because it only removed bad memories, and conveniently, all of Jacob’s memories involving magic were good and he forgot nothing. It was as much of a writing cop out as resurrecting Credence and dropping that information so nonchalantly within the first ten minutes. Minerva McGonagall makes an appearance, which is odd considering she wasn’t born yet. I’m sure J.K. Rowling will say that Minerva froze herself in time, or that that’s her secret older sister with the same name who was teaching at Hogwarts in the 1920’s, or some other nonsense.\n\nDespite allllll this criticism, I still enjoyed the film. Call me crazy. I’m a sucker for the Wizarding World. While it was lazy to go back to Hogwarts and rehash beloved scenes that worked in the original books (e.g. the bogart), I would be lying if I said I didn’t perk up and smile when I heard the John Williams score and saw the students in black robes walking to class in the Hogwarts halls. I refuse to believe that young Dumbledore—the man with such a humble and troubled upbringing—resembled Jude Law in his perfectly tailored suit in any way. Though I must say, Jude Law nailed his performance. He must have studied Michael Gambon’s portrayal, right down to his accent. There were some words where he would add a sort of Irish twang, much like Gambon. Johnny Depp did an excellent job with the now-English Grindelwald that Rowling wrote for the script, but I simply hate this film version of his character. He’s so cartoonish and stylized. Tell me how he looks more modern and digital than anyone in the eight Harry Potter movies, which take place decades after the events here???\n\nWhile Nicolas Flamel looked crazy and was unnecessary, I was moved when he joined the battle in the end. There’s something about good people coming together and using their remarkable intelligence to fight the powers of evil that gets to me. The final plot twist left my jaw on the floor. I hope it’s not a case of “Oh Dumbledore had a secret sibling,” and ends up being more evidence of Grindelwald’s cunning manipulation and deception. Was Leta telling the truth when she revealed that she killed her half-brother? Maybe Leta is innocent and really does believe she killed her brother, despite the possibility that that isn’t what happened. I do recall Abernathy stealing a box from the Ministry before that entire scene took place. Was that the family tree box that he stole and then took to the graveyard, or is that the real one and a fake, altered one was the one we saw at the graveyard? I can’t remember Newt’s precise words, but he said something like, “It was all planted” when the group walked out of the graveyard and into the mass gathering. That could be referring to how they were lured to that particular place, or it could be referring to the fake box. MAYBE ABERNATHY IS CORVUS! I need to see more of Dumbledore interacting with Grindelwald and where this Blood Pact plot line is going.\n\nI hope the next movie will use Newt more, because he’s such a lovely character and Eddie does such a wonderful job portraying him and his social awkwardness. At times I feel like his story suffers because J.K. Rowling has forced the Dumbledore/Grindelwald storyline on what was supposed to be the Fantastic Beasts world. It’s a shame because 1) Newt is interesting enough and deserves to carry his own movie, and 2) the Dumbledore and Grindelwald backstory is so rich it’s practically begging for its own movie, if not franchise.\n\nI don’t care how flawed this latest installment was, I’m still fully invested in the story. All I ask is that J.K. enroll herself in some local screenwriting classes prior to writing the third film. And, please, stop it with the Polyjuice Potion! And I guess while she’s at it, she could stop being transphobic.\n\nDirected by Jordan Peele, 116m, USA\n\n*This review contains spoilers.\n\nMy record for correctly guessing the plot twist at the very beginning of a film was held by the film Goodnight Mommy (2014). I guessed it at a record ten minutes, or (in case recollection serves me wrong) by the time the two lead boys sit at the dining table waiting for their bandaged mother to serve them breakfast, but she only talks to and serves one of them for no apparent reason. Jordan Peele’s second feature film, Us, released just two years after the exquisite Get Out, has officially beat out Goodnight Mommy for my quickest plot twist guess, at just five minutes, or (once again in case recollection serves me wrong) by the time young Adelaide’s doppelgänger, Red, turns around to face her in the hall of mirrors, and the scene cuts to present-day Adelaide. Flashback scenes of her parents speaking to a therapist about their daughter’s mysterious change of state and their desperation to get the “old Adelaide back” did nothing to conceal the twist.\n\nIt’s evident that Jordan Peele is determined to make horror movies that matter. Ones that go beyond genre, yet still satisfy our B-movie cravings and stimulate us intellectually. In this way, he succeeded with Us.\n\nAdelaide, Gabe, Zora, and Jason are the average American upper middle-class family. We meet them on their way to Santa Cruz for what is meant to be a relaxing vacation. Gabe and Adelaide want some romantic alone time, Zora just wants to listen to music and watch videos on her phone, and Jason wants to practice his magic tricks. Their plans are cut short when their beach house is invaded by a family of maleficent doppelgangers.\n\nWhen I first saw the trailer, I thought the movie would grapple with the psychology of having to face the fact that we are what we fear most, or in other words, that fear can manifest itself in our image, making it harder to identify and conquer those fears. I imagined a thriller with a Freudian touch. Peele had much bigger plans, and I must admit, I was a bit disappointed in the political turn it made, not because I disagreed with what he was trying to say, but because what he was saying was falling apart before it even took shape.\n\nI interpreted the doppelgängers as a dual metaphor, if you will. On the one hand, they functioned as a commentary on the rise of American xenophobia in an age of contentious immigration policies, as well as a commentary on the normalization of Islamophobia as a tool to mask the rise of home-grown, western terrorism. Regardless of which—if either—is correct, Us is a movie for the Trump era, and as much as I can’t stand talking about that clown, it’s hard to deny his perverse influence on the film.\n\nThanks to Agent Orange (to quote Spike Lee quoting Busta Rhymes), Americans have seen a rise in xenophobic rhetoric, specifically against Mexican immigrants, but really against any people of color in the United States. I vomit as I recall his “Mexicans are rapists…some…are good people” remarks, along with his infamous “shithole countries“ jab (in reference to Haiti and African nations), and his obsession with the handful of cases where undocumented immigrants have killed American citizens, going as far as promising to start a website that will keep a live update of crimes committed by immigrants. This kind of fear-mongering riled up unfounded hatred towards groups that are seemingly different than “us.” It allowed for dangerous generalizations of people of complex ethnic, linguistic, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nSo imagine you are one of these xenophobic people for a second. You look outside your house and you see a group of people holding hands, wearing red jumpsuits that resemble prison garb, not moving, looking straight at your house. You panic. You go outside, and you realize once you are closer to them that instead of the non-human monsters you thought they were, they look exactly like you. No, they are you. You also realize they are militant and ready to kill you. Confusion and fear meet panic. How is it possible that these evil beings can be made of the same fiber as you? As Jason said in the film, “When you point a finger, three are pointing back at you.” Ultimately, it’s easy to fear and blame something or someone that isn’t you.\n\nI believe Red and her doppelgänger family of Abraham, Umbrae, and Pluto represent immigrants. As the plot thickens, we learn that Red is the real Adelaide coming to take her rightful place in the world. Her life was stolen from her when her doppelgänger switched places with her in the hall of mirrors in the opening scene of the film. Red’s plan of destruction is suddenly humanized because we see that she is actually a victim looking to better her miserable existence as a Tethered.\n\nWhenever people spew anti-Mexican immigrant rhetoric, they seem to forget that much of the southern United States once belonged to Mexico, and that a lot of the suffering that brings these immigrants to the United States is a direct or indirect result of American interference in Mexico, as well as in those “shithole countries.” Accuse immigrants all you want of bringing drugs into this country, but don’t forget that Americans are the ones buying them. I can’t help but see parallels to these immigrants and the Tethered.\n\nThis goes hand in hand with reading the metaphor as a commentary on the rampant Islamophobia in today’s society. It’s easy to point the finger at people who are part of a religion that you are ignorant of, that you only understand through hearsay from other equally ignorant people. The hypocrisy becomes evident when Americans, typically Christian white men, commit heinous crimes against other Americans, but receive little to no racist attacks. Instead, they are treated like troubled teens, who unfortunately met their breaking point. Let’s not forget Agent Orange’s “There were good people on the white supremacist side, too” soundbite after the Charlottesville white supremacist march in 2017. Once again, when you are bigoted and the “enemy” looks like you, it opens up the possibility that there could be a piece of the “enemy” within you. You’d rather find a new Other to blame than confront your own demons. But as Red responds when Gabe asks her “What are you people?”: “We are Americans.” It’s not us versus them, because we are them.\n\nIf it’s not obvious where Peele’s metaphor crumbles, let me explain. Peele is challenging the idea that “scary” people of a different nationality, race, or creed are invading and ruining the American landscape. But it’s the very people who look like us, Americans themselves, that are mobilizing and killing people. But…his characters are technically still invading and viciously killing the “original” people in their homes. We might be able to sympathize with them but the Tethered in the film are technically breaking into people’s homes. They seem to be part of an army, giving more credit to the idiots that claim all immigrants are a monolith of criminals. It’s also a bit unsettling to consider immigrants as copies of natural-born citizens.\n\nAdditionally, the nature of the doppelgängers was very confusing. It seemed like the Tethered were obliged to mirror the physical movements of the originals, but that law wasn’t consistent throughout the movie. We saw it in action when Jason lead Pluto into the fire and in the fact that whatever happens to the originals, like starting a family, happens to the Tethered, but we don’t see it at all anywhere else. How are the Tethered able to mobilize if they are only able to mimic the originals, and how is Red able to function in the world independent of what the imprisoned Adelaide does? Shouldn’t Adelaide in fact be mirroring Red? How did she learn to speak? I need answers!\n\nIt also doesn’t make any sense why Red didn’t just explain her story at the beginning. It would have been much easier and less bloody if she just told Gabe the real timeline of events. I doubt he’d like the idea of being married to a Tethered. Red’s vengeance on all the originals and not just Adelaide is a weird mission to embark upon, when the reason for her suffering is because of the actions of just one Tethered. Her voice changing was a bit extra, but I get that that was a side effect of Adelaide choking the life out of her when she was young.\n\nAny references to Jeremiah 11:11 for me are ruined thanks to the worst show put to screen, HBO’s Here and Now. I still need to dissect the Hands Across America reference, along with the point of the Tethered’s demonstration. Did they want peace with or did they want death to all the originals? Why the slaughter if you don’t have a reason for it? How were they controlled so easily?\n\nLupita Nyong’o deserved at the very least an Oscar nomination for this brilliant performance!\n\nUs is an ambitious movie. For me, the quintessential modern doppelgänger story is Coherence and you should probably watch that instead (sorry Jordan Peele). For now, I’ll just keep rewatching Get Out.\n\nDirected by Alexandre Lehmann, 80 min, USA\n\n“Quickly I slid it out, and almost immediately its glow enveloped me, something almost musical, an internal sweetness that was inexplicable beyond a deep, blood-rocking harmony of rightness, the way your heart beat slow and sure when you were with a person you felt safe with and loved. A power, a shine, came off it, a freshness like the morning light in my old bedroom in New York which was serene yet exhilarating, a light that rendered everything sharp-edged and yet more tender and lovely than it actually was, and lovelier still because it was part of the past, and irretrievable: wallpaper glowing, the old Rand McNally globe in half-shadow.”\n\nThe Goldfinch (2013) by Donna Tartt\n\n“I’m afraid there’s nothing simple about being simple.”\n\nCertified Copy (2010, Abbas Kiarostami)\n\n“I started out in search of ordinary things.” So croons a languished Bill Callahan in “Jim Cain,” the song that accompanies the final credits of Blue Jay. That a quiet, intimate film stripped of what can be considered gaudy color (“to buck the trend of loud indies,” in the words of its director and cinematographer) ends in such a reflexive note of meditation is no coincidence.\n\nJim Cain, much like the film’s protagonist Jim (Mark Duplass) and even the filmmakers behind Blue Jay, turns to life’s simpler curiosities to find his purest, most fulfilled self. It’s a Walden-esque return to nature, where our mind is free to roam, without external pressures, where observation of the world around us is key, and the asking of questions and living in the moment is more thrilling than the arrival at the answers. In fact, it’s in facing these answers—the reasons why—that we become disillusioned.\n\nAside from creating an uncluttered visual scheme, screenwriter and actor, Mark Duplass transports us to a world of small, intimate moments between two charming, humble people. Blue Jay in essence is a simple film, and I don’t mean that in a pejorative sense. The soundtrack is unobtrusive. The dialogue is organic due to its largely improvised nature. The script focuses on two main characters and a guest character, and four locations: the grocery store, the Blue Jay diner, the drug store, and Jim’s mom’s house. Crestline is an alpine fortress of small town life, unburdened by big city woes. It took a total of seven days to shoot this under-90 minute feature. Absolutely nothing about the film is aspiring to be Big or Important (for the most part).\n\nJim’s Walden is the return to his mother’s house with his high school sweetheart, Amanda (Sarah Paulson), who is visiting her pregnant sister in Crestline. In their regular lives, he is a drywall contractor weighed down by the loss of his mother, the responsibility of renovating and selling her home, and recent unemployment, and she is trying to find a sense of fulfilment that doesn’t compromise the responsibility she has for caring for her elderly husband and two stepchildren. But, as if it were a time machine, Jim’s mother’s house blasts the two friends back to their romantic high school days as soon as they step foot in it. Here, all their burdens disappear, they can be as goofy and uninhibited as they once were; they have dreams that burst at the seams. They can pretend life hasn’t hit them yet.\n\nBut the reality of their doomed connection reveals itself. Artifacts from their high school days are what prompt their conversations and musings: tape recordings, mixtapes, bad coffee, international beer, and letters. Their first conversation at the grocery store is a blubbering attempt at one, almost as if they can’t even recognize the adult version of the person they once loved in front of them, not just physically but also mentally, and have no idea how to recreate their once instant connection. Only until Amanda opens the letter in Act Three can they finally have an honest, adult conversation. But it’s too late. They are not who they used to be. In a way, it’s the exact opposite of the marriage in Alex Garland’s Annihilation, in which the sole reason Lena and Kane can resume their relationship is precisely because they are altered beings. Jim and Amanda, like Jim Cain, aren’t satisfied anymore with their play-acting. It turns out recreating their simpler times is maybe more difficult than being their complicated, regular selves, because they are pretending to be the people they once were. Their blissful reminiscing becomes too painful. Instead of relishing in the small moments they confront each other about the event that broke them apart, and again like their musical kindred spirit, “things didn’t pan out as planned.”\n\nJim Cain seems to either end his own life in search of fulfillment or fall back into a deep depression (or both?), but ultimately asks the listener to “remember the good things I’ve done.” Likewise, Jim, who himself appears to suffer from loneliness, regret, and sadness has been trying to right his earlier mistake by attempting to remind Amanda of all the great moments they had together.\n\nWhere Blue Jay falls apart for me is in its third act, which felt totally out of place with what the rest of the film was trying to accomplish. The story throws intimate and small out the window and opts for Big and Important in a film that would have been just as wonderful without it. Of course, from a writing standpoint, I understand that a climactic conflict needed to be introduced to break the characters’ nostalgic merriment, but did it need to be in the shape of cringy overacting? Perhaps not. And though Mark Duplass can morph very well across different genres and roles, I’m not so sure that portraying a heavy, dramatic mental breakdown is a tool he has in his acting belt quite yet. His monologue was either hilariously over-the-top or brutally vulnerable, though I’m leaning toward the former.\n\n*This review contains spoilers.\n\nSmall Island, Andrea Levy’s 2004 Orange Prize-winning historical novel, shines a spotlight on the erased contributions of the Jamaican volunteers in the Royal Air Force (RAF) who fought alongside the mainland British in World War II. Many of them moved to Britain after the war as part of the Windrush Generation only to face cruel systemic racism from the very people they fought to protect. Something as simple as obtaining a livable housing and wages became a struggle. Switching back and forth between the perspectives of the white English couple of Queenie and Bernard Bligh and their tenants, the Black Jamaican couple of Hortense and Gilbert Joseph, the novel provides a trans-Atlantic version of an era that has notoriously whitewashed the impact of England’s growing immigrant community.\n\nIn my opinion, the novel’s most engaging narratives were those of the Josephs, two emblems of determination and hard work. Gilbert is a hilarious protagonist. An RAF volunteer faced with the culture shock of life abroad, he complains about criminally unseasoned English food, his wife Hortense’s horrible Jamaican cooking, the nonsensical American Jim Crow laws, and the stupidity of the white people of any nationality who keep gawking at his skin color and accent as if they too don’t have a color or accent. His sharp yet humorous commentary will satisfy the modern reader who is also privy to racial microaggressions and is disturbed by society’s centering normalcy on whiteness. When Gilbert temporarily visits a United States army base, Levy highlights the ways the American legal system was (and is) racist in more sinister, ostentatious ways than that of the English. The English might touch Gilbert’s skin without his permission, but the Americans were the ones who wouldn’t let him sit in the same area as white people.\n\nThe Jamaican narratives also gesture toward the class struggles faced by Jamaicans in their small island as well as the evident colorism that allowed lighter-skinned Jamaicans, like Hortense and Gilbert (who himself is half white), to access education and the means to escape. Levy does an exceptional job navigating the interiority of these characters as they are exposed to overt racism, as well as capturing the authentic bigotry spewed by the ruthless white American and English characters. One is left feeling appropriately uncomfortable.\n\nAt first glance, Hortense comes across as uptight and condescending, but really she is a product of a lifetime of psychological deception. She and other Jamaicans were taught that England was the Mother Country and made to feel like they would be accepted by her citizens. That if Hortense followed the path set for Jamaicans by her white English teachers, her skills and resume would be automatically accepted in England. You know—“Just peak properly and don’t act like those other Jamaicans, and you’ll be fine.” It sounds a bit too similar to the pushback Black Americans face when another Black person dies at the hands of police—“If they just acted ‘right,’ then maybe they would still be alive.” Of course, this type of respectability politics is no insulation for systemic racism. Hortense was well-educated and more qualified for a teaching job than most of the English characters yet she was still treated as if she were illiterate, just as Christian Cooper is Harvard-educated yet still got the cops called on him simply for bird watching while Black. Rest assured, no matter how “exceptional” a Black person is by white society’s standards, he or she will be judged by something as superficial as his or her skin color. As Malcolm X quipped, “Do you know what white racists call black Ph.D.’s? N*****!” (The Autobiography of Malcolm X, p. 290)\n\nIt’s not until the end of Small Island when Hortense finally realizes that the so-called Motherland sees Black people, despite their fighting alongside the British in the war and being citizens of their Commonwealth, as invaders in their country. And it’s not until the final chapters where she decides to stay in England against all odds, because it is her right. It’s a much-needed moment of power for the Josephs, both of whom are on their way to rebuilding their lives on their own terms outside of London. The scene gestures toward the coming of a more interracial but segregated modern England which stratifies its citizens of color into underfunded neighborhoods. Levy makes the point that while the Josephs are able to escape the bigotry of their landlords the Blighs to seek community among like-minded and like-skinned people, their future is one of limited opportunity. It’s hopeful, but ominous.\n\nThe Blighs’ narratives had as much bigotry and ignorance as the Josephs’ parts had heart and soul. Queenie is the more tolerable of the couple, but my god is she an awful human being. It’s been a week since I finished the book and the vile, ignorant comments she made in the preface continue to haunt me! I started to lose hope in the novel when it seemed like Levy was trying to write off racism and/or signal a change of heart in Queenie by having her start an affair with Michael Roberts, a Jamaican member of the RAF and (a little too) conveniently, Hortense’s true love and adopted brother. I don’t totally blame Levy for the problematic writing—I do think she wants the reader to realize that Queenie was acting out a fetish and was never in love with Michael, but I fear that some readers might finish the novel thinking that interracial dating—and further, interracial children—is what is needed to combat racism. As a member of a racially mixed ethnic group, I can confidently report that interracial relationships solve absolutely nothing; it just makes it easier for racism to remain covert. In the end, Queenie having sex with a Black man is just that—Queenie having sex with a Black man. She reduces Michael to his stereotypical hypermasculinity. The way she talks about him as they are having sex is dehumanizing, as if he’s an extraterrestrial. (I’m still hurting from the manner in which she described him.) I was relieved that Queenie ended up admitting she didn’t have the strength to not be racist (lol), which confirms my suspicions that Levy wasn’t trying to romanticize the situation. That clarity came a little too late for me.\n\nWith Bernard Bligh, Levy presents a three-dimensional English racism where not only Black people but also Indians, or “natives” as Bernard calls them (and much worse), were also being degraded. The novel started falling apart further here. His war section was superfluous and added nothing unique to the story. It was a straightforward, testosterone-bloated recounting of how the English government abandoned the RAF in India after the war was over and how the RAF participated in horrific inhumane and misogynistic acts on the battlefield. We know. It’s the history that already had a voice.\n\nThe way Bernard’s backstory unfolded read like an afterthought, crammed in at the last minute to explain where he had been for five years…even though I never really understood why he was in Brighton other than to spy on Maxi’s family. There was a moment when Bernard thought he had syphilis and then a few pages later he found out he didn’t. Was that there just for laughs and a bit of cringe-worthy descriptions of Bernard popping pus in his nether regions? I see no other reason for those inconsequential details to have been included.\n\nWhile the novel did give a voice to the silenced, Small Island read like it should have been the first book in a series. I went into it thinking it would focus on the Jamaican characters and leave the white characters in the periphery. Ultimately, it ended up not following any one person’s journey enough to leave me a satisfied reader. Plus, there were too many coincidences scattered throughout! Levy’s writing flowed easily and had excellent moments of wit, social commentary, and wisdom, but I left feeling underwhelmed.\n\nHow should one approach criticizing a film adaptation? Is the success of a film solely dependent on how accurately the original source material was depicted? Should the director be applauded for his or her original point of view? Should we treat the film as an independent medium? I overworked myself trying to answer all these questions whilst watching Lenny Abrahamson’s The Little Stanger, an adaptation of Sarah Waters’ novel, to the point where I think it’s necessary for me to re-watch it.\n\nI find reviews of film adaptations that lambast a film for not adhering 100% to events as they occurred in a book to be simple and ignorant of the basic tenets of filmmaking. Of course, some literary moments will have to be lost once they transfer the material to the screen. It’s also a bit rich for a film to claim to be an adaptation of a work it barely resembles. In the end, a faithful adaptation can be a terrible film (Fifty Shades of…) and an unfaithful adaptation can be a good film (Stanley Kubrick’s Lolita), just as much as a terrible book can be adapted into a good film (Lord of the Rings…sorry not sorry Tolkien fans). What’s important is that the viewer considers what the director’s intentions were in making the film. What about the book did he or she want to emphasize, and do the plot changes serve his or her vision for the story?\n\nChallenge Number One in watching Abrahamson’s adaptation was in accepting that the characters I had gotten to know in the 500 pages of Waters’ novel were not going to be present in this film. His unique imprint on the story was evident within the first five minutes. Ruth Wilson, who blew me away as Jane Eyre in the 2006 BBC adaptation, plays Caroline Ayres, a plain, unmaterialistic sort of woman, with a stifled sense of adventure, and a dry, self-deprecating sense of humor. However, Film Version Caroline was straight up miserable and humorless, stomping into the Hundreds Hall kitchen, barely noticing Dr. Faraday standing there as she forces out a greeting. I’m by no means an expert in the Warwickshire accent or upper class 1940’s English accents, but to my American ears it sounded like the accent Ruth used when we were introduced to Caroline was not the same one she used in later scenes, nor did it sound like the accents of any of her family members.\n\nCaroline’s mother, Mrs. Ayres, in the novel had a certain airy and friendly quality to her, almost as if no one had yet informed her that her mansion, once resplendent in wealth, was crumbling before her, yet Charlotte Rampling’s version was uptight and possessed an uncharacteristically sinister look in her eyes, as if she sensed the mysterious events that would befall her family in days to come.\n\nOne of the most disappointing changes came in the depiction of Roderick, Caroline’s younger brother, who instead of being his charming, occasionally approachable, and stressed out self, was the stereotypical and slightly offensive movie version of a person with disabilities. He was pretty much angry every second he was on screen, wallowing in his sadness and disfigurement. He was Suffering, and instead of using a talent like Will Poulter to command scenes with interesting dialogue, the filmmakers exaggerated the common cinema rule of “show, don’t tell” by SHOWING!!! and barely telling us anything about him.\n\nAlthough Domhnall Gleeson captured the essence of Dr. Faraday very well, I’m afraid he let the film’s ending inform his acting choices throughout. What made the reading experience so unsettling was in the dramatic irony of the audience sensing that something was off about Faraday all along, but Faraday not realizing that until the very last sentence. In a Thrillist article, Lenny Abrahamson shared a tidbit about what helped him and Gleeson better understand the character of Faraday (thus confirming my aforementioned observation). In his words:\n\n“…there’s that famous Spaghetti Western where the character is carrying nitroglycerin. He’s carrying this explosive liquid and therefore he has to be really careful with everything he does in case it explodes. That was one image we used quite a lot: Domhnall is so contained and careful and repressed and buttoned up. Not because he’s cold, but precisely because he’s somehow subconsciously aware he has this terrible force in him. When he is angry, stuff starts to happen in the house. There’s this symbiosis between him and ‘the thing’.”\n\nThere were some inconsistencies in character and writing. In particular, there was a scene where Caroline asks Faraday to speak to Roderick about what’s troubling him, to which he forcefully refuses because he’s not a psychologist. She repeats the question, and then with a quick mood change, he says, “Oh, of course. I’d be happy to.” But he literally just said he couldn’t!! Was that meant to showcase Faraday’s shaky mental state or was it just clumsy writing? There was another weird exchange when a party guest asks Faraday to fetch Roderick to join in their celebration. Even if it was meant as a condescending gesture from someone who assumed Faraday was staff, it still doesn’t make any sense why she would see fit to ask him, when a minutes ago it was announced that he was a guest at the party, and Mrs. Ayres and Betty, the servant, were in the same room and could have done the job just fine. From a writer’s perspective, I’m assuming they wrote that in to abridge the events as they were described in the book. Instead of including the long bits during which Betty goes to fetch Rod to join the party, then comes back without him, then goes back with Mrs. Ayres to fetch him, then returns without him again, then the days pass before Rod admits what really happened the night of the party, and then more days pass before Caroline finally recounts the night of the fire, the film places Faraday at the events and shortens the timeline.\n\nBy portraying Faraday as a rational man repressing an anger he’s aware of and Roderick as a self-pitying and morose war victim with a penchant for ominous warnings, Abrahamson leaves no room for us to doubt that Roderick is crazy and Faraday is responsible for the “hauntings.” And by presenting Caroline and Faraday as two awkward love birds with no idea of how to be romantic, he leaves out a truly frightening version of Faraday: the one where he’s a sexual predator and a misogynist.\n\nThe only actor who I thought had any semblance to her book version was Liv Hill as Betty. Despite my criticisms, all the actors were excellent at portraying the wildly inaccurate versions of their characters. Were the changes worth it, though? Abrahamson seemed to want to focus on Faraday and the darkness within him that was threatening to explode. It would have been more beneficial for his vision to show Faraday’s and Caroline’s courtship in all its creepy, dark, uncomfortable moments. Their film relationship seemed too tame and Faraday too understanding for me to fully believe he possessed an inner evil. Roderick’s changes didn’t really affect the main plot, since he became such a peripheral character in the end. The same goes for Mrs. Ayres.\n\nChallenge Number Two was in getting accustomed to the way the story was breezing through character development. I understand that translating prose into cinema language is not easy, but for some reason the film thought that uneventful short scenes were the equivalent of extensive, detailed prose. I would rather have had one long scene of the Ayreses with Faraday at tea, during which they discuss his poor upbringing or the rise of the National Health Service, than a five second establishing shot of them at dinner, and then a cut to Faraday and Caroline sitting on a couch hours later. It stripped away most of the rich social commentary and pressures they were facing. I wonder if I would have been able to follow along in the story and know the intensions of the characters had I not read the book beforehand.\n\nChallenge Number Three was in absorbing the film’s new version of events and using it to challenge my own interpretation of the book. I never imagined Faraday as being responsible for the deaths of any of the Ayreses or of the “S” scribbles on the walls, but these new points do make for a fascinating reading of the story. We understand the plot through Faraday’s perspective. Sure, he says he has no idea how Caroline died, but it is very suspicious that he was wasted at the wheel right in front of Hundreds Hall when she died. Or at least that’s what the editing led us to believe. It had to be intentional to place a medium long shot of Faraday sleeping at the wheel right before the shot of him entering his house to greet a distraught Dr. Granger (why did they change his name from Graham to Granger??) with some bad news. How much time had passed between the scenes? Couldn’t he have done it and forgotten? Or did he really fall asleep and go straight home when he woke up?\n\nThe possibility of Faraday being an unreliable narrator is something I’m glad carried over into the film. Is his narration his way of reshaping the past to cast himself in a better light? I would even say that the movie does a better job explaining why he’s telling his story in the first place. If he killed Caroline, then it makes sense for him to tell his version of events. Perhaps his unreliability explains why Abrahamson altered the “romantic” scene in the car to one in which Caroline is a willing participant.\n\nEven if I were to remove all I know about the book and approach the film independently, I still don’t think it is an exceptional film. I didn’t mind the toned-down supernatural elements or the film’s slow pace, but what did bother me was that Hundreds Hall didn’t look as intimidating or haunting as it thought it was. The sound design was effective and very subtle. You could hear knocks and whispers without any of the characters on screen noticing them. Oftentimes I found myself looking around the theater in case it was one of my fellow moviegoers making noise or perhaps the sound from the adjacent screening room was seeping through the walls (it was neither). Additionally, Abrahamson’s choice to set most all scenes in the daytime was a unique take on a genre that relies heavily on darkness and the unseen to produce scares.\n\nAlthough I appreciated the movie’s bold choice to implicate Faraday in the death of Caroline and his poltergeist to be the force behind the mystery, I did find that the eeriness of the story disappeared when it made that decision. It would have been much more effective had an equally compelling case for the presence of ghosts been presented or explained in the slightest. The screenplay was most tolerable when Faraday used voice over to tell his story, and I would have liked to see more of that.\n\n“We make our own ghosts by looking but pretending not to see, and then forgetting ourselves altogether. It is a terrible thing to look at oneself and all the while see nothing. Surely this is how we make our own ghosts: we make them out of ourselves.”- I AM THE PRETTY THING THAT LIVES IN THE HOUSE (2016)\n\nI suggest that you be grateful/That it’s your blood on my hands/And assume yourself weaker, the fall of man/And look out for the beast/Tonight he lies with me/Tonight he lies with me/And here comes the beast – “The Beast” (Laura Marling)\n\nSarah Waters’ 2009 psychological historical fiction takes us back to the late 1940’s to a decaying mansion in Warwickshire, England. Through the first-person narration of protagonist, Dr. Faraday, we learn that the still, crumbling, inactive expanse of property known as Hundreds Hall was once a bustling and alive place, with the Ayres family the hub of upper class social life and the envy of many a working class family. It is the Ayres’ sick servant named Betty and the fortuitous unavailability of his boss that bring Faraday back to his mother’s employer’s house, and it is his obsession with conserving the past as he remembers it that keeps him there.\n\nThis book is overflowing with anxiety, stress, depression, self-loathing, insecurity, and unfulfillment.\n\nLet’s start with the most fascinating and frustrating character: Dr. Faraday. He is both confident in his own judgments of others—whether or not they’re founded in truth or pure speculation—yet simultaneously lacks confidence in himself. He delivers psychological diagnoses left, right, and center to every member of the Ayres family, yet dismisses and downplays his obvious and very serious mental issues as “fits of discontentment” (41). Here’s one example:\n\n“…I’ve had occasional dark hours, dreary fits when my life, laid all before me, has seemed bitter and hollow and insignificant as a bad nut; and one of those fits came upon me now. I forgot the many modest successes of my career, and instead saw every failure: the mishandled cases, the missed opportunities, the moments of cowardice and disappointment. I thought of my undistinguished war years—spent here in Warwickshire, while my younger colleagues, Graham and Morrison, enrolled with the RAMC. I felt the empty rooms below me, and remembered a girl with whom, as a medical student, I’d been very much in love: a girl from a good Birmingham family, whose parents hadn’t considered me to be a suitable match, and who had finally thrown me over for another man. I had rather turned my back on romance after that disenchantment and the few affairs I had had since then had been very half-hearted things. Now those passionless embraces came back to me too, in all their dry mechanical detail. I felt a wave of disgust for myself, and a pity for the women involved.” (39)\n\nWhile reading, I wondered whether he was using these euphemisms for depression because historically the medical terms were not popular or widely researched at the time and carried a lot of stigma. Sometimes there’s no hesitation in naming specific diseases, like epilepsy, delirium tremens, and myxedema, and even Mrs. Ayres confides that Roderick’s previous doctor (Rod we’ll get to in a second) diagnosed him with depression (119); other times problems are referred to as a “nervous condition” or as vaguely and reductively as “war shock.” It’s unclear what the consensus was, but what is certain is that Faraday is unable to recognize his own psychological instability despite thinking of himself as a very observant, logical, and rational mind. His own self-criticisms are pointed and tinged with a true self-hatred that persists throughout the entire book. Caroline at one point tells him, “But now it sounds almost as though—well, as though you hate yourself” (257). It’s ironic that he was so quick to point out how Roderick experienced the worst of his supernatural encounters via a mirror—how that could symbolize that the real horror was in confronting one’s reality and the demons we each hold within ourselves—when a cracked mirror is what he’s looking at when he finally confronts his own problems.\n\nFaraday’s lack of self-awareness is evident most in the distorted, controlling way he engages with Caroline, the older Ayres sibling. First of all, he is cruel and cold in his descriptions of her. He’s so critical of her every physical detail that his descriptive passages oftentimes read like police or autopsy reports. In one instance, just the sight of Caroline enrages him (321). His romantic pursuit of her seems more like an attempt for him to own a part of society that he could never participate in, as well as a link to a past that is gone. He mentions stealing an ornamental acorn from Hundreds Hall when he was little as a way to possess a piece of the house; marrying Caroline is the equivalent.\n\nI must admit that the romance sections between Faraday and Caroline were dreadful and prolonged my reading experience by two full days, during which I looked at the book, picked it up, ran my fingers through the binding and the pages, and immediately decided to watch three hours of The Americans: Season Four instead. I hated every uncomfortable second of Faraday sexually assaulting Caroline in his car. In that scene she was giving him both verbal and physical cues to let him know she did not want to be kissed, touched, or pursued in a romantic way. Of course, Faraday did so anyway, not recognizing how predatory and desperate he was behaving. So when she calls off the wedding, he pretty much goes off the rails, refusing to leave her alone, and ultimately refuses to once and for all detach himself from Hundreds Hall.\n\nMrs. Ayres, Caroline’s mother, is a victim of societal pressures on women to be perfect mothers and to have children, and the subsequent trauma of losing one of the children she was likely pressured to have. She expresses to Faraday how people would tell her:\n\n“Why, what’s the matter with you? Don’t you know that people of our sort don’t make a fuss? Here you are, in your fine home, with your husband who came through the war, and two healthy children. If you can’t find a way to be happy with that, you must simply stop complaining—” (226)\n\nThere are also hints of how class expectations affect her too. How can someone who has so much feel so little? Be so ungrateful? It showcases a society that wasn’t fully aware of the way untreated mental illnesses can blossom into bigger problems.\n\nRoderick, Caroline’s brother, is equally as mentally tormented as Faraday, but he at least recognizes it. It’s unclear what exactly his disorder is, though I myself speculate it’s social anxiety and bipolar disorder, because of the fears he admits to having when he breaks down in Faraday’s dispensary and the fact that the doctors administer lithium bromide to him when he is in the mental facility. His is quite a tragic story and can be read as both an example of the ways in which our mental health system fails us and a commentary on how close-minded skeptics of the supernatural can be. I am definitely one of those people that points to science or some “logical” physical phenomenon to explain what is otherwise inexplicable. I typically claim, rather overconfidently, that those who believe in the supernatural are allowing their belief in a spiritual world to clout their reality. Our minds are so powerful, that when you believe in ghosts and you walk into a dark, haunted place and hear a noise or see a shadow, you will convince yourself that that noise or shadow without a doubt is caused by a ghost, despite there being other explanations for the events. But what if the believers are right?\n\nWhat Sarah Waters does brilliantly in The Little Stranger, is present a character who, like me, is a nonbeliever (a character I should relate to), imbuing him with despicable traits, and in that making me root for the believers of the supernatural instead. It’s because both sides have sound arguments that the novel works. I can see how it could very well be a poltergeist causing the problems, but I can also see how it could be a series of mental delusions causing them. Or both.\n\nThe supernatural events could too be read as a metaphorical haunting of pre-war England on post-war England, or of each of our personal histories creeping up on us preventing us from moving forward, or as a metaphor for anxiety (Rod: “For so long as I can keep it, you see, in my room, I can contain the infection.”). All of them are valid. That’s why I referred to the novel as a psychological historical fiction at the beginning of this review. It’s not so much a terrifying ghost story as much as it is a picture of a struggling society as it attempts to rebuild itself after strife. We get a sense of the gender expectations of the time, how oppressive marriage was for a woman, and how medicine either shamed and dismissed women when they admitted to feeling low, or falsely diagnosed them with disorders when they saw fit to silence them. The disparity in classes was apparent, with characters constantly making unintentionally offensive remarks about the lower classes in front of Faraday, assuming that because he’s eloquent, has a proper accent, and is highly educated, he can’t possibly have come from anything other than wealthy stock. In The Little Stranger, these rich, pompous families are being put in their place, losing the fortunes they once had and being forced to *GASP* make their own food and fetch their own plates, since their servants fled to factories.\n\nA few days ago I watched a YouTube video featuring Simon and Mercedes of SavidgeReads and MercysBookishMusings, respectively, in which Mercedes (and a bunch of other readers) posited that Caroline could be gay. Now, I can’t definitively agree or disagree after reading through the book twice, but I’m leaning towards no. Faraday attributes “masculine” features and behavior to Caroline when speaking of her. Sometimes it’s as subtle as both he and Caroline standing up when somebody walks into a room. At the doctors’ dance, Caroline seems to be more carefree in the presence of her friend, Brenda, than she is around the men, and oftentimes does stereotypically unfeminine things, like oversee the building of the houses on the Hundreds property, and bear her feet. But does that have to mean she’s lesbian? Couldn’t that be attributed to a personal rebellion against gender norms? Or maybe because she’s attracted to men she’s more uncomfortable around them? When Faraday says she has “muscular calves” and “mismatched masculine features,” and selects to recount her telling him that dancing with her was like “dancing with a boy,” are we meant to read it as 1940’s code words for homosexual? It’s an interesting theory, but one that’s inconsequential to the story.\n\nSpeaking of selective memory brings me to a most mystifying question: why has Faraday taken the time to tell us this story? Other first-person narratives typically explain why the protagonist is recounting the events laid down in the book we’re reading. Faraday never explains why he’s sharing anything. He just kind of starts talking to us. It makes me wonder whether he’s reliable as a narrator. A huge chunk of the narrative is him recalling what other people have told him. Has he altered any details? Is his memory reliable? Is he downplaying his own demons and exaggerating the illnesses of others to make a stronger case against them and make himself look better? Is he more critical of Caroline, and women in general, because he’s writing with the knowledge that she rejected him?\n\nI thought the ending worked well and kept in line with the array of themes and insecurities explored in the book. Waters’ writing is sturdy and competent, though it’s nothing I would call extraordinary. I can’t say I was terrified at any point in my reading, but the uneasiness and anxiety expressed within the pages has stayed with me much after putting the book down."
