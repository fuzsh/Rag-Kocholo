However, production has yet to begin and a release date has never been confirmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeries creator Hideo Kojima is currently working on Death Stranding 2, following his departure from Konami in 2015.\n\nDeath Stranding 2 will see the return of Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges, Troy Baker as Higgs and Léa Seydoux as Fragile while Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna join the cast.\n\nA release date is yet to be confirmed but after Kojima shared several photos of him hanging out with CHVRCHES, many fans assume the band will also be involved in the sequel to 2019’s Death Stranding."
