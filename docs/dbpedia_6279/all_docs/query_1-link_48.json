Mind-map SLEEPOVER IDEA: Trapped inside a bedroom Sleep walking The person waking up hallucinated Home environment - gives a sense of reality. PTSD Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Abuse Bad background story, creates sympathy and understanding. Drug use, non glorified. CONVENTIONS OF A HORROR FILM: Dusty old board game, similar to the movie Ouija, creates a sense of old fear, the use of the dust shows time aging, fear that nobody wants to play the game NON GLORIFIED DRUG USE Pills, teenagers, regret Shows audience members the negative side effects, Similar to the show EUPHORIA CONVENTIONS OF A THRILLER, Action film, editing shots such as the blur effect shows activeness, high speeds. Thriller movies tend to have props such as guns, post apocalyptic ideologies such as Bird box or a quiet place. TEENAGER POPULAR MOVIES Movies such as Nerve, involves technology which allows teenagers who watch it understand how popular apps are. Gives the movie a sense of realism, how it can happen to them. Popular scores used in movies such as the Purge ( thriller ) used the song Plug Walk, helps reach to those teens / young adults who understand the lifestyle, making it more relatable. Camera angles create drama, close ups, medium shots can help portray and represent the character, high shot to represent weakness or vulnerability. Clothing can help represent weakness or power such as tatted clothes for helpless characters, Ideas Group Discussion:\n\n3. Trailer Ideas Mind Map Ideas relating to someone being stabbed, in a party. Blood everywhere linking to the common conventions of horror. Bloody knife and body, we can use fake blood to show danger, this creates a sense of fear which creates suspense. Doing makeup - as part of the sleepover, and getting ready for the halloween party Watching a scene from euphoria which is a show, the scene will pause on someone face as someone tries to replicate the makeup look. Looking at more ideas, we can note that in a party environment they will be taking pictures of each- other, this could potentially be faded into a police environment. This advocates to the audience members that something must have gone wrong however we do not reveal too much creating anticipation for audience members to want to watch out movie. A shot of someone’s back (they would be wearing a black hoodie with the hoodie pulled up so the audience don't know who) holding the bloody knife while looking down at the back of a dead body so its doesn't spoil who dies but builds anticipation Our theatrical trailer will follow the three-act structure. This means that it will start off with an establishment shot, this can show their environment then we will carry on with a disturbance and furthermore end our theatrical trailer with a montage and the trailer will be 2:30 seconds long. The teaser trailer will be 30 seconds to a minute therefore it gives us room to decide and analyse what we can add to the trailer to make it appealing to our target market. A close up shot of a hand holding the bloody knife Doing a line a of powdered drug (using flour) (we are not glorifying it) then the scene cuts before its sniffed this could be a way that someone is killed, the drug affects the person's body, making them do things they're not suppose to (killing their friend). There will also be someone who takes another prescribed drug for their mental illness, these two drugs being together in their body will have harmful side effects such as hallucinations ,the prescribed drug is a new type of drug on the market. Bloody knife Walking out of the party with music in the background to show the party is going on (diegetic music) - not too loud so you can hear us talking Another aspect we could interpret into our final piece is the non glorification of drug use, this can also be added with peer-pressure as we can target issues in relation. Another thing we could think about is adding a blue to the camera, this means it can create a sense of hallucination etc. The group taking pictures all together then there will be a flash as they take the picture which might be the transition to another shot of the flash ending and we can see that its the police taking pictures of a dead body. The ending of the establishing part can be of the taking pictures then the transition is the flash and the start of the start of the disturbance is the police taking pictures Looking at the costumes used, and the common conventions of a subgenre the clothing used for when there is stabbing would be tatted, damaged clothes, this shows how they are vulnerable and accentuated on their weakness, making the audience connect more with the character, creating a larger urge to want to watch the movie. Looking at the common conventions of a drama, for our final piece we will try to promote an emotional connection with the characters and the audience to create more tension in the trailer to make them feel more sympathy etc. Them playing a board game such as ouija but we will have our own version of it but in a way that the audience know what it is, one of the friends in the group will say how this is a bad idea, then we will see them dead a but later. We will try to add popular soundtracks such as popular artists, this will help show our target market who are teenagers more about and relate more to the situation making our final piece more contemporary.\n\n4. Mise-en scene Sound Editing Shots For our mise-en scene, we will look into creating our final piece relatable to the common conventions of horror and some of drama, this can help make our genre more understandable and help create a more scary and sets the tone, we took inspiration: For our sound, we will try to add in popular soundtracks, this is because it will make our final piece more contemporary and more in date with our audience members, furthermore from our survey we gained information to add scores which are screeching noises etc to create suspension and bring a new sense of fear to audience members. For the editing of our final piece, we will try to incorporate features such as adding blurs to create an effect of hallucination, we will also add features such as fast invisible cuts to keep a high sense of continuity furthermore we will add things such as fade however we will add inspiration to further promote ideas / features we could potentially add to make our final piece aesthetically pleasing. Looking at the common conventions of horror / drama films we can denote that they tend to not reveal a lot about the surroundings. From our survey conducted, we could see that people's favourite horror movies were movies like the conjuring and shining which tend to not reveal too much to create passive audiences into more active audiences to create a sense of fear. Furthermore, we can see in drama movies such as love island to keep a sense of reality to keep the audience member interested.\n\n5. Inspiration page (mise-en-scene) costumes props MAKEUP SETTING For the makeup we were inspired by the show euphoria, they tend to use glitter and a lot of gems mainly around their eyes. They also tend to use purple, blue and pink for their eyeshadow. We thought that this could be interpreted into our halloween costumes in the beginning of the trailer, showing us Most teen dramas show typical teenage parties, however we will transform it into a halloween party to add the horror to the drama since that's our genre. Our our party scene inspiration comes from movies such as mean girls where they hosted a halloween party and the show euphoria color themes with the lighting as well inspired us. For our sleepover (ouija board scene) and getting ready scene, it will be based in the bedroom and again inspired by euphoria we will transform the room to look like a typical teenage room, with fairy lights, many throw pillows, decor etc. For the getting ready scene girls usually have a chaotic messy room when getting ready as you can see in the picture on the left. As i mentioned before our makeup is inspired by the show euphoria which we will interpret into our halloween costumes, this will be the same for our outfits. As you can see in the pictures below these are characters in euphorias outfits, which we will try and recreate. The type of outfit depends on the character and their personality, as you can see the outfit of each character depends on their personality, some are girly and others are more tomboy and one is even goth. This helps portray the characters personality and understand them more in the trailer without the audience watching the movie. For the props we will be using drugs which is also inspired by the show euphoria where drugs are used by teenagers to educate how bad it can affect your life, therefore you should never use them. The way we will interpret this into our own trailer and teaser is through the idea of encouragement by friends to take drugs which will lead to consequences such as hallucinations and accidental events. Moreover, us using the ouija board at the sleepover scene is inspired from many horror movies specifically the movie ‘Ouija’ where this board is said to bring bad spirits and possess, which will help create horror in our trailer and teaser. Furthermore, as i mentioned in the settings probs like fairy ad LED lights will be added to the bedroom in the sleepover scenes to create a more realistic teenager room inspired by euphoria.\n\n6. Our first draft of the story board\n\n8. During the planning stage of our storyboard, we decided that we wanted to ensure that we follow the three act structure, meaning that the end of our trailer would need to have a fast moving montage. Therefore we took our previous five shots of the slow dance movement and the characters sleeping in a room, to meet more of the common codes and conventions of a horror movie by adding five completely different and scary scenes such as banging on a door, showing how scared the character is. The killers point of view of watching one of their victims sleeping which immediately foreshadow danger. Moreover we can see that there is a demeted body reflecting back in the mirror, which creates tension and brings fear to the audience members, fast car chases which brings an adrenaline rush and the last shot of a screaming character, we decided to make it more chaotic as this will ensure that we can bring fear but also make it more clear as to the storyline. Storyboard planning (2)\n\n9. THEATRICAL TRAILER A theatrical trailer which is also known as a preview of coming attraction is a commercial advertisement for a feature film that will be exhibited by potential audience members. This trailer is a long version of a trailer as they can range from 2-3 minutes long. Moreover we have to follow the three-act structure of establishment, disturbance and montage in order to make out piece more clear to audience members and to ensure that we can portray the highest quality trailer to attract audiences. It is important that we follow the structure and keep to a clear and consistent layout in order to make it clearer for us as the producers in the filming stage. THEATRICAL TRAILER IS ON THE NEXT SLIDES:\n\n10. Storyboard THEATRICAL Mise en scene- Makeup products will be used in this first shot as a close up - this is a typical code and convention of drama movies where girls usually like to get ready and play around with makeup with their friends, this also lets the audience get to know the characters personalities because often makeup can show they are “girly”. We added makeup as we know this will automatically attract teenage audiences, which are our target demographic, moreover male audiences may be confused as to why there is makeup, making them want to watch on. Lighting - high key lighting coming from the lights in her room - evening time. Shot - A close up shot will be used - close ups are used to show importance of the props and in this case it's the makeup. Close up allows us to immediately show the audience that our characters are female, this is because looking at common stereotypes, females tend to wear more makeup. Therefore adding a close up does not reveal too much at the beginning to expose any form of the storyline. Editing - It will start as a close up then it will zoom out to show more makeup products scattered on the table because the girl is getting ready, a pan movement allows the audience to explore more of the establishing environment without revealing too much, making them want to watch on. Sound - non diegetic sound track - a typical modern day song playing from her phone as she gets ready, this is because it is associated with teenagers and moreover teenage audience members will be able to relate, making them watch on. What is happening: the shot changes from the makeup to the main character being introduced to doing her makeup, foreshadowing future events to the audience. Mise-en scene- This scene is showing her in her room applying makeup. There will also be a container of prescribed lithium pills for her mental illness, she will will look at it and pushes it away into the trash. Shot- medium shot Lighting: normal white bathroom lights to represent to the audience that is so danger. Sound: diegetic recorded sound track of a modern day popular song playing in the background to show that she is listening to music while applying makeup which is what a normal person does, it also offers a sense of relatibillity to the audience as the song will be known and the action of listening to music while listening to music is relatable. Editing : when it moves from shot one to shot two there is no cut it's a continuous edit, this is to show that this is from the same scene and that. What's happening: She’ll be putting make up as she looks in the mirror (same as the scene before) but here it's now a medium shot showing her clothing and room and her face is different.. Mise en scene - Again the makeup will be the props used here to signify her girly personality and show the drama side of our genre but this time she is holding it and using it - It will be euphoria inspired makeup for the halloween party she's about to attend. Shot - This shot will be a medium shot to show her what she's wearing and her room Lighting - high key lighting - good lighting is needed for this scene because we are still introducing the character so details of her outfit and makeup needs to be shown in good lighting Editing - An invisible cut will be used to switch from the close up to medium long shot. Sound - the same diegetic song will be playing from her phone (same as shot 1 and 2) - again to show hr personality through the typical modern day music she listens to 1 2 3 Establishing shot of makeup, shows audience makeup, then changes to character using makeupz Putting on makeup over shoulder shot in mirror then changes to another angle, showing makeup is being used establishment\n\n11. 4 5 Mise en scene - Here we can see the introduction of another character, this is during the establishment phase as it shows who the characters are and makes it clear as to them being teenagers, going to a party therefore setting the overall theme and tone for the trailer. We can see that they will be in a bedroom, with the girl doing her makeup and getting up and the entrance of the new character breaks away from the isolation that was presented in the first few shots. The mise-en scene will show calm and excited body-language to somewhat foreshadow future events which creates confusion within the audience. Shot - The shot is a medium close up, we decided to choose this shot as it can correctly denote the characters facial expressions with also including the background, this can help create the mood for the environment. We decided to choose this shot as it can denote not only their expressions but help create more of a character relationship with the audience as they begin to understand their personalities etc. Lighting - The lighting will be normal bedroom lighting, this is because it can help create a warm mood for the characters, so that when the trailer moves forward, when negative things happen it can create sympathy for them. Editing - For the editing, it will be a fast invisible cut, this is so that it can cut fastly and keep a sense of continuity throughout the establishment of the trailer. Sound - The sound for this shot will be a diegetic dialogue of the second character saying ‘’are you ready’’, this creates confusion within the audience as they want to know what it is that they are getting ready for, it also foreshadows danger as something is going to happen, yet as it is a trailer and we cannot reveal too much. Mise en scene - For this shot, the mise-en scene is that we are trying to create a very shallow tone and scary tone, in a teenage bedroom, in order to create more of the common conventions of a horror. Adding a split into the main character looking into the mirror and editing it to create a sad look looking back at the character creates a sense of fear, this is to again emphasise and foreshadow the dangers that lie ahead in the movie, yet we are trying to show that this character may be the victim within the movie, making it more understandable for the audience members. Shot - this shot will be a medium long shot to show both her from the waist up and the reflection in the mirror, this is to put emphasis on the difference in the expression, the shot will denote her side profile on both sides to show a change in expression from happy to sad, to show deep down she is not happy, to create a sense of curiosity within the audience. Lighting - The lighting within this will be slightly more gloomy than the previous one, this is because it can help to convey the saddened mood which we are intending to portray. Editing - this will be an invisible cut then it will fade to black to set the tone of the trailer and to add mystery to it, we chose the colour black as this is the most common colour used in movies with the similar common conventions of horror and drama. Sound - The sound for this shot will be a diegetic sound where it goes from silence where she replies to the previous dialogue to say ‘’i am’’ insinuating that she is ready.\n\n12. 6 7 Mise en scene - For this title, we can see that it will fade to black, this is because looking at rick altman colour representation we can see that the colour black can represent fear, danger etc therefore this colour would be most suitable for the background for our titles, Here we can add a title such as a small quote along the lines of ‘’ would you trust your friends?’’ or some short quote along these lines to create suspense and fear within the audience. Shot - this will simply be a fade to black with a title. Lighting - Dark lighting as the colour black will create a sense of fear.

We added this section of the trailer which is similar to the three-act structure and it is the disturbance this is because the audience are alerted that there is an immediate problem.

Mise en scene - This next shot is similar to the previous one, however the picture taken will zoom out to a detective / police officer examining the room, this changes the tone completely from a party environment to complete silence, and gloom, linking to the common codes and conventions of a horror.

Disturbance\n\n16. 18 17 16 In in this scene we are now introduced to the disruption part of the 3 act structure Mise en scene - In this shot the policeman is shown taking a picture of the crime scene, the camera is a key prop in this scene and the previous one because they are both used for different purposes, in this shots case it's being used in a negative way but the audience is still not familiar with why it’s being used and making them question what just happened? why is the police here? what crime was just committed? Making them engaged to persuade them to watch the movie and fins out. Shot - A medium close up shot will be used again to similarly replicate the previous one as well as to focus on the camera but the uniform to make sure they are familiar that his is a policeman. Lighting - Low-key lighting since it will now be late at night after the party and this will also help make it more of a horror scene since bright high-key lighting make not give the audience a sense of fear Editing - Again its started of as a a fade from a white flash this is so that it can slowly show the audience there is a problem. Sound - The same camera snap sound (non-diegetic) will be used as the previous but now a non-diegetic sound track of dramatic music will start to intensify the disruption scene. Mise en scene - In this shot we are now shown more or the crime scene still in the same room but a more key part - which is the body being zipped up in the background. The zipped body bag brings many thoughts to the audience since they are now aware that someone has died - making them question who is in the body bag? Which is why we will only be showing the feet of the body since this is a trailer and we can't reveal too much but also this will attract them to watch our movie so that they can find out. Shot - A Long shot will be used in this shot to familiarize the audience with the new atmosphere of the room that this crime scene has created and the state it left the room in. It's also used to show the relationship between characters and their environment. Lighting - Again low-key gloomy lighting is used to create a horror scene as well as the fact that it's late at night. Editing - Invisible cut used from this shot to the next one (18) to show a sense of continuity. Sound - A non-diegetic sound track from the previous scene will continue to play of dramatic intense music to add a sense of fear for the audience making them intrigued and engaged. Mise en scene - In this scene the blood is shown dripping from the body bag, blood is a key code and convention of a typical horror movie used to make these scenes look realistic and gruesome. In this scene the blood shown is the blood of the dead body and it could also show and give the audience a sneak peak on the way the dead body was killed?? Shot - Extreme close up - to show importance of the blood making it more glorifying and gruesome Lighting - Low-key lighting since the room is still dark but there will still be some lighting to showcase the blood and its detail Editing - Again an invisible cut used to give the audience a sense of continuity Sound - The sound will increase but still the same soundtrack of non-diegetic intense dramatic music will be playing from the two scenes before.\n\n17. 20 19 Mise en scene - This shot is of another title page which helps separate the location scene change. It will be a dark title to bring a sense of fear towards the audience again looking at rick altman colour representation we can see that the colour black can represent fear, danger etc therefore this colour would be most suitable for the background for our titles. This title will be another quote along the lines of “your next” to keep suspense throughout the trailer helping stay engaged. The text font will be researched more deeply which you can see in out font research however we are sure that it will contain dark colors with either our choice of a dark background or dark text writing. Shot - the shot will simply just be a fade to a dark title shot with the title covering most of the screen. Lighting - Dark lighting will be used for this because we want to create fear with low key lighting since our genre also falls under horror. Editing - It will fast fade to black from the scene before to help create a intense dramatic change to scare the audience. Sound - The sound for this will be a non-diegetic cinematic effect of intense loud music for the short amount th Mise en scene - This shot will show one of the girls being questioned but the camera quality will be through a cctv camera the reason behind this is because we want the audience to experience what it's like though the point of view of the police statin watching the girl being questioned, and it gives the audience a sense of belonging as if they are there seeing what it's like from the polices point of view as well and it makes it more realistic again making sure the audience are always engaged with our unique trailer because It also makes the audience question what is she doing here and what is she being questioned for. Shot - It will be a medium shot this is because it helps show the girls emotions but also her body language as she is being questioned to show her response to being in this situation. As researched before i know that you body language and All of your nonverbal behavior, the gestures you make, your posture, your tone of voice, how much eye contact you make, send strong messages. Lighting - lighting is low key the lighting will be coming from a bright lamp that shines directly on her face used typically in questioning rooms to scare the suspect. Editing - An invisible cut will be used this is because we want don't want a clear visible transformation between the scene before and this one and instead create a sense on continuity. Sound - diegetic sound of the girl speaking saying “I didn't do it” again making the audience question “what is it that she did” which will make them want to watch the full movie.\n\n18. 23 22 21 Mise en scene - Again through this scene will be shown through the CCTV camera to give a CCTV camera a different girl is now shown to a different angle this is to show that Shot - This shot is a high angle long shot used because we want to familiarize the audience with the new setting of the entire room which the girls are being questioned in. Lighting - The lighting here again will be low-key lighting with a bright lamp shined on their faces to integrate them when being questioned again this method is usually used by police men to typically in questioning rooms to scare the suspect. Editing - The editing of this shot will be an invisible cut, this method will be used because we don't want a clear visible transformation between the scene before and this one and instead create a sense on continuity between all the girls being questioned. Sound - diegetic sound of the girl saying “I don't even know her well” a low volume suspense non-diegetic soundtrack still be playing in the background of this to make sure the audience sense of fear is still present. Mise en scene - In this scene we are now brought closer to the character in the questioning room to introduce the audience to their identities and facial expressions not through the CCTV this time. Shot - This shot will be a medium close up, used commonly to show the emotions on a characters facial expression. Facial expressions are also very important because It may also tells the audience something about that situation, for example if the character is very shocked and we can see it in their face, this probably means something unexpected just happened, and in this case we are shown that the girls face is terrified and frightened from being in this situation. Lighting - The lighting in this room will be lowkey but their will be a bright lamp in the questioners face to make it seem more realistic (as this is a typical practice done of suspects in questioning rooms) when they are being questioned in the room and giving them a sense of pressure and fear as their being questioned. Editing - Again an invisible cut will be used because we don't want a clear visible transformation between the scene before and this one and instead create a sense on continuity between all the girls being questioned. Sound - The volume will now increase as this shot starts and there will only be the non-diegetic dramatic soundtrack still playing in the background. Diegetic sound of police man integrating her “do you recognise these drugs?” Mise en scene - In this scene we are now shown a different character sat in the same location, in the same seat also being questioned again not shown through the CCTV camera anymore but it's close to show their facial expressions. The purpose of this is to show how many different people were being questioned that night, which emphasises on the crime committed was a serious one. Shot - Again, it's similar to the shot before only the character is changing so it is also a medium close up, used commonly to show emotions. Lighting - The lighting in this room will be the same as the shot before, which is dull and lowkey which is common on questioning rooms to give the suspect a sense of pressure and fear. Editing - Again an invisible cut will be used to change smoothly from character to character and giving it a sense of continuity. Sound - In this she will be asked a different question compared to the other character so that the audience can build up some information about what the police may be talking about, giving them clues so in this one the police asks her “were you aware she had this mental illness”\n\n19. 25 24 Mise en scene - this continues on from the previous shot and it is showing the front of her face as she gets interrogated, her face would look pale and shocked, we would show this by having mascara smeared under her eyes, she would be slightly trembling. This all to make the audience realize that this matter is serious and that she is terrified. The girl would also be wearing oversized clothes and sunglasses showing that they are gulty and are trying to cover up. Shot - this will be a medium close up shot so the audience can clearly see her face. Lighting - Dark, gloomy lighting to bring the tone down, this is to create tension to the audience so they feel anxious and edgy towards the outcome, which will make them want to view the movie. Editing - this will be a continuous shot continuing on from the previous shot. Sound - there will be suspentional soundtrack, this to make the audience feel jumpy. Diegetic sound of girl saying “it wasn't her/our fault” Mise en scene - this is another shot that will include another title, it will also help the audience members to recognise the transition from the disruption bit to the montage. The reading it is a black background is so that it will put emphasis on the dark notes of the trailer. Shot - the shot will be a white title with a complete black background to show the strk difference between the two. Lighting - the lighting will be dark to show emphasis on the fact that the trailer is not happy and cheerful but darkl and horor Editing - it will simply be a fade to black from the scene before Sound - non diegetic; a creepy version of the song ring around the rosie will start to fade in softly from the background.\n\n20.

She will then wash her face and when she looks back in the mirror the main charector will be seen standing behind her in black bloody clothing with a dark expression to show how she is dangerous and that she is injured or injured someone. The girl will be seen wearing pyjamas to show that she is going to sleep. Shot - the shot will be using here is a medium shot so we only show the girl from the waist up so that we can see the mirror and her clearly and we can see that there is someone behind her, we will also have a crane camera movement of the camera starting at her looking in the mirror with nothing behind her then it goes down with her as she washes her face then it goes back up again and someone would be behind her. Lighting - the lighting here will be a normal Bright bathroom light to show everything clearly and to show that she is not just seeing shadows but it is clear enouhg. This will make the audience feel unsettled as the lighting is bright so there shouldn't be a problem or a source of evil.

TEASER TRAILER: For the teaser trailer, this is a trailer which is also known as a pre- launch campaign, it is an advertising campaign which consists of a much faster version of the theatrical trailer. This is because it will be much more attention grabbing therefore looking at the theatrical trailer, this means that we will need to take the montage in relation to the three act structure and we will place this directly into the middle in order to increase the attention of the users. Moreover as the teaser trailer is a shorter version, this means it will have less shots as it will range from 45 seconds to 1 minute therefore we can incorporate shots from the theatrical trailer into the teaser trailer in order to keep a sense of branding and understanding. To also ensure that the audience are not exposed to too much information. THE STORYBOARD FOR OUR TEASER TRAILER IS BELOW:\n\n24. 1 2 Mise en scene - Here we can see the introduction of another character, this is during the establishment phase as it shows who the characters are and makes it clear as to them being teenagers, going to a party therefore setting the overall theme and tone for the trailer. We can see that they will be in a bedroom, with the girl doing her makeup and getting up and the entrance of the new character breaks away from the isolation that was presented in the first few shots. The mise-en scene will show calm and excited body-language to somewhat foreshadow future events which creates confusion within the audience. Shot - The shot is a medium close up, we decided to choose this shot as it can correctly denote the characters facial expressions with also including the background, this can help create the mood for the environment. We decided to choose this shot as it can denote not only their expressions but help create more of a character relationship with the audience as they begin to understand their personalities etc. Lighting - The lighting will be normal bedroom lighting, this is because it can help create a warm mood for the characters, so that when the trailer moves forward, when negative things happen it can create sympathy for them. Editing - For the editing, it will be a fast invisible cut, this is so that it can cut fastly and keep a sense of continuity throughout the establishment of the trailer. Sound - The sound for this shot will be a diegetic dialogue of the second character saying ‘’are you ready’’, this creates confusion within the audience as they want to know what it is that they are getting ready for, it also foreshadows danger as something is going to happen, yet as it is a trailer and we cannot reveal too much. Mise en scene - For this shot, the mise-en scene is that we are trying to create a very shallow tone and scary tone, in a teenage bedroom, in order to create more of the common conventions of a horror. Adding a split into the main character looking into the mirror and editing it to create a sad look looking back at the character creates a sense of fear, this is to again emphasise and foreshadow the dangers that lie ahead in the movie, yet we are trying to show that this character may be the victim within the movie, making it more understandable for the audience members. Shot - this shot will be a medium long shot to show both her from the waist up and the reflection in the mirror, this is to put emphasis on the difference in the expression, the shot will denote her side profile on both sides to show a change in expression from happy to sad, to show deep down she is not happy, to create a sense of curiosity within the audience. Lighting - The lighting within this will be slightly more gloomy than the previous one, this is because it can help to convey the saddened mood which we are intending to portray. Editing - this will be an invisible cut then it will fade to black to set the tone of the trailer and to add mystery to it, we chose the colour black as this is the most common colour used in movies with the similar common conventions of horror and drama. Sound - The sound for this shot will be a diegetic sound where it goes from silence where she replies to the previous dialogue to say ‘’i am’’ insinuating that she is ready.\n\n25. Mise en scene - the girl standing outside the window will be wearing dark red and black bloody clothing to signify danger and evil. She will be the only person standing outside the window to show how the area is isolated which will make the atmosphere tense as the girl outside is seen to be fearless which makes her dangerous. The girl inside will be slightly trembling and shaking with fear. Shot - the shot will be using here is an over the shoulder shot do that we are able to see what she sees from her viewpoint which is of a girl standing outside in the streets watching her from the bedroom window, this makes the audience nervous as this could happen to any of them which put them in the girl's shoes. Lighting - there will be a dim bedroom light and Street lights to add jumpiness to the shot as that will only be the lights in the shot to show the girl. Editing - an invisible cut will be seen in this shot to show the sequence of events. Sound - she will also be panting and breathing heavily while staring out the window to show that she is terrified. we will be using a non diegetic Ring around a roses song,playing softly in the background. conventions of horror. Mise en scene - the girl will be seen looking tired by having her dark circles under her eyes, wrinkled clothes and knotted hair to show how she is exhausted. Her clothes will be black to show how she is in mourning. Her facial expression will appear to be pinched, to show her fear. Her eyes will be watering to show that she is petrified. Shot - the shot will be using here is a wide medium shot so that she is seen trying to open her room door but its closed and so that her facial expressions is seen as well, this makes the audience see everything that is happening carefully so they will feel worried for her. Lighting - in the next scene it will be a night, and only a dim bedroom light will be on to add to the tension and apprehensiveness of the audience when they watch and to als add to the mystery as it is unknown who is behind the door. Editing - the editing will be an invisible cut Sound - we will be a live diegetic door slam, sounds of her trying to open the door by jiggling the door knob and breathing heavily. This will put emphasis on the fact that she is trapped and terrified. we will be using a non diegetic Ring around a roses song,playing softly in the background. conventions of horror. Mise en scene - in this scene the girl will be seen in the bathroom standing in front of a mirror and a sink, there will be products for such as different types of creams, lotion, etc, to show how she is still young and an average stereotypical girl. She will then wash her face and when she looks back in the mirror the main character will be seen standing behind her in black bloody clothing with a dark expression to show how she is dangerous and that she is injured or injured someone. The girl will be seen wearing pyjamas to show that she is going to sleep. Shot - the shot will be using here is a medium shot so we only show the girl from the waist up so that we can see the mirror and her clearly and we can see that there is someone behind her, we will also have a crane camera movement of the camera starting at her looking in the mirror with nothing behind her then it goes down with her as she washes her face then it goes back up again and someone would be behind her. Lighting - the lighting here will be a normal Bright bathroom light to show everything clearly and to show that she is not just seeing shadows but it is clear enough. This will make the audience feel unsettled as the lighting is bright so there shouldn't be a problem or a source of evil. Editing - this is an invisible cut Sound - there will also be a diegetic live sound of her washing her face, this to show normalcy and to put the audience on edge so they feel anxious that something will happen , when she sees the person behind her she will also gasp in shock. 3 4 5\n\n26. Mise en scene - the car will be black so that its indespiquoues and so that it is able to blend in with the shades which will add to the notes of danger. She will be seen wearing exercise close to show that she has been jogging. Shot - the shot will be using here is a wide shot so that we can show her clearly running running away from a car that is chasing her, this would make the audience jittery as there is a random car chasing a teenage girl in the middle of nowhere significant. Lighting - this will be at night which follows the horor codes of convention, and only the street lights will be visible so it can show shadows and that it is dark. Which will immediately put a weariness tn the audience. Editing - this will be an invisible cut. Sound - there will be a live diegetic sound of her saying hello when she hears something behind her, then the car will then be seen, this is to show how she does not know who the car belongs too and that she is scared. there will be a diegetic live sound of a car following her. This is to build tension to the audience. There will be the live diegetic sounds of her starting to walk faster as she realizes the car is following her. This is to make the audience understand that she is trying to walk away from the car. we will be using a non diegetic Ring around a roses song,playing softly in the background. conventions of horror. Mise en scene - her face will be seen to be scared and frightened. Her face will be damp with perspiration to show that she is exhausted from exerting energy. She will also have streaks of faded blood on her face and hair. Shot - the shot will be using here is a close up shot so th it will put emphasis on her face and her screaming showing that she is terrified. Lighting - Only bright light on the girl's face and the background is pitch black. This is to put emphasis on the girl face and how she is terrified and she is slowly succumb to the darkness which is why darkness is surrounding her. Editing - this will be an invisible cut. Sound - we will be using a live sound of a girl screaming in a terrified way showing that she is scared, this will make the audience unease. There will also be a crazed high pitched laughter in the background. Mise en scene - For this shot, the mise-en scene is that we are trying to create a very shallow tone and scary tone, in a teenage bedroom, in order to create more of the common conventions of a horror. Adding a split into the main character looking into the mirror and editing it to create a sad look looking back at the character creates a sense of fear, this is to again emphasise and foreshadow the dangers that lie ahead in the movie, yet we are trying to show that this character may be the victim within the movie, making it more understandable for the audience members.

Sound - The sound for this shot will be a diegetic sound where it goes from silence where she replies to the previous 6 7 8\n\n27. Film name (sarah: description WE ALL DECIDED NAMES (ALL) On this page we'll be finding the film name. I decided to conduct a form of primary research survey of 10 people to which 6/10 people decided that the name Ephemeral was the most appropriate name with context of the storyboard. This is because ‘’it creates the strongest idea of confusion which would make me want to watch on and watch the movie’’. Therefore from this feedback it allowed me to understand that this name for our trailer ensures that we do not reveal too much information about the trailer.\n\n40. Font research: Dana A survey was taken in order for us as a group to understand what our focus group prefer for our fonts, the final font chosen will be used in the trailer teaser and poster. Putting out a survey for our focus group is really important as our focus group research is to draw upon respondents' attitudes, feelings, beliefs, experiences and reactions in a way where other methods are not applicable. A Focus Group allows the us (the researchers) to gather more information in a shorter period of time in a matter of hours. They are who the movie is going to be viewed by and their opinions will really effect on the popularity of our trailer die to the fact that their ideas were inputted. After research we had chosen the three below to ask out focus group about and below shows how many votes each got and out final decision. This got a vote of 6/15. This was also taken from dafont.com and was also very popular with votes although it did not win. This was chosen as one of our choices because not also does it give a horror effect which is what we are going for but out movie is about the main character getting revenge which is the name of this font, so it went well with our idea and is something we definitely wanted to consider. This font idea got a vote 7/15. This idea is our titles written with lipstick on a mirror this shows out teen drame side of the movie but there will be blood dripping down the mirror which will also show our horror side of the movie. The feedback from our focus group was mainly the fact that it was a very unique idea which they wanted to see come to life and that have haven't seen an idea like this before. This is what lead us to choosing this as out final font. This font got a vote of 2/15. This font idea was taken from dafont.com and we mainly picked it because it looked like a very creepy and scary font that will attract those audiences who enjoy a good horror movie. However the feedback from out focus group was that it didn't catch there eye and was a very basic font used by many horror films which is why we did not choose it as our final one.\n\n41. Shot list ( theatrical ) 1 Sarah This is our shot list, this is very important for our final piece as it will make filming much more time efficient therefore it allows us to find a clear distinction between the establishment, disturbance and montage in relation to the three act structure. There are several different black out titles and shots, this will not be filmed but we added it in to understand the structure of our trailer (theatrical ), instead they will be edited into our final piece during editing. Moreover, the shot list helps with ensuring out final piece flows smoothly with a strong sense of continuity, we hope to achieve a strong sense of understanding in order for our potential target market to want to watch our movie.

Props and equipment (sarah) EQUIPMENT: The props and equipment are the physical materials in which we need to create our final piece. When creating a final piece, there is a need for an equipment and prop list in order to be organised when it comes to filming. This helps us to develop a stronger sense of commercialism as behind the production of our trailers and posters, we need to look into the lights, cameras, props and materials. I creates a table requiring the specific materials we need to use in order to film our piece. Below shows who in the group well being each piece of equipment This is a tripod, this will help us when filming as we can look into the scene where they sit in a circle, this will help make it much smoother therefore making it easier to watch with less of a disturbance or shake in the camera which would degrade the quality. It will also help keep the camera straight during the filming of other features such as the blood when it is zoomed in. This is a plug in lighting system, this is necessary for out final piece as it helps to create the tone and mise-en scene of it being a party environment. This helps to make it much more easier for the audience to understand the typical codes and conventions of horror/ teen drama, and helps to convey the tone. This is a camera, in our case we can choose to use out IPHONE 11 and Pro max in order to keep our quality high. Choosing to keep our quality to a high standard will ensure we can convey the correct tone for our final piece and ensures our trailer does not degrade. This is final cut pro, we also have Imovie which are both editing softwares which will help us to make different edits such as the blue effect, and fast invisible cute to keep a strong sense of continuity furthermore making out final piece look more aesthetically pleasing and making our target audience feel more inclined to want to watch it. This is a ring-light, this is to help with our lighting and we are choosing to use a product like this to ensure that we can portray the characters main emotions such as fear when they are being interviewed for CCTV. This can help convey their emotions of the common codes and conventions of a horror and drama film. CAMERA Roba or Sarah SOFTWARE Sarah DISCO PLUG IN LIGHT Sarah RING LIGHT Roba TRIPOD Dana\n\n48. Props and equipment (sarah) PROPS ( clothes) For the props, looking at the fashion, we will add typical teenage clothes which are worn in parties, such as colourful dresses. We took inspiration from the show ‘ euphoria’ this is because they have typical teenage clothing yet with an edge of the idea of drug use. The different colours used can represent different meanings for example the colour purple can represent pain and therefore shit represents who the character is. Moreover the character who wears a tight black dress will be the victim, this is because looking at rick altman colour representation the colour black represents death therefore the main character will be wearing a black dress, the other teenage characters will be wearing typical teenage clothes. Such as dresses. Furthermore, the clothes used will be a detective and police outfit, this is because during the disturbance it will change to show a police man and a crime scene therefore we will need to get a police outfit to clearly show the audience that there has been an accident / danger therefore creating a sense of confusion which will make the audience want to watch on and watch the movie. For more for the costume, we need a different outfit for the disturbance when the teenagers from the party are being interviewed, we chose to get oversized hoodies, big sunglasses etc this will help create a sense of discreteness. Someone knows they are guilty and are choosing to somewhat hide behind clothes and glasses. This also ensures that the audience cannot see specifically who it is to keep us from revealing too much.\n\n49. Props and equipment (sarah) PROPS This prop used is a camera, this is because it will be used by the teenage character when they take a picture of the victim which will transition into the detective taking a picture of the crime scene, this is a vital prop in our final piece. This is an unorganised messy desk- space, we decided to keep this in our props because it shows the typical products which teenagers use, making it more relatable to the target demographic. We also chose to use makeup during the establishment as it can also be used in the crime scene to create a sense of continuity throughout our trailer. This prop used is a body-bag, this is going to be used in the disturbance of the trailer where the detective is in the room, we will not show who has been killed, this will help keep confusion which will create a need to fill in the curiosity to the audience therefore making them want to watch on and want to watch our movie. The body bag will be executed to make it look like a real body, with blood dripping. This is fake blood, this will be dripping off the body-bag and will also be placed around the room in order to link to the common conventions of horror which can help to create fear amongst audience members. This other prop which we will add to our final piece are fake drugs, this is so that we can convey the non- glorification of drug use. This will be given around in the party environment to show the dangers and to some audience members who have knowledge on what drugs do foreshadows danger. Furthermore, the final prop which we will add to our trailer are plastic cups to symbolise that the teenagers are underage drinking. This immediately foreshadows danger and enforces the idea that the characters will be under the influence which means that there will be danger. In conclusion the knowledge and understanding of which props to use will ensure that we are more organised in being time efficient for our final piece.\n\n50. The ring light serves two purposes the first being that it illuminates the room further so its better for filming and that it's more fitting for the makeup scene as lots of people use it so that they are able to apply makeup properly which will fit in with the stereotypical teenage girl theme The colours of the wall appear to be grey which represents dullness and depressing which sets the mood for the rest of the trailer as the audience will see that it is dark movie and it also reflects the main character's personality. The ‘hamsa’ which is known as the evil eye and it is said to ward off evil also creates a foreshadowing sense to the audience if hey look at it as it does not fit in with the room which create a sense of foreshadowing that there is a sense of evil. Shots: 1,2,3,4,5 Location Recce (roba)\n\n51. Again more greys as it sets the tone and the horror theme representing lifelessness and dullness. The ‘love’ that is hung up on the bed is seen a lot in teenage girls room that is it a stereotype so it is added to fit the teen genre so that it is attractive to the as they will develop a personal connection to the trailer which will then might draw them in into watching the movie There is a forever 21 shopping bag on the bed which is in the colour yellow which represents caution which would again set the tone for the rest of the trailer. Shots: 2.3,4,5,26\n\n52. The colours in this arena also symbolise both horror and drama which will give the audience an understanding of what had occurred. The dead leaves on the ground give a foreshadowing foreboding effect on what will occur next which might cause the audience to feel unsettled, especially as they are seeing dead leaves while seeing the dead body of a girl. Which will fit into both drama and horror codes of convention. This bench was perfect to convey rick Altmans genre theory as it has the semantics/ syntactics of both horror and drama movie, for semantics it has the old creepy. Shots : 17,18\n\n53. For the ‘party scene’ we went to a place called the youth hub in which they had areas such as this studio that we are able to film in. The colours of this area are very simple and light which is beneficial as we turned off the light and used tv to have party lights by searching it up in youtube this then set the tone that this is a party that the individuals are partaking in, the light colours was reflective enough that the whole area had strobe party lights . We placed the two chairs in the middle aside so that the individuals who will be acting are able to sit in the middle in a circle together shots: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14\n\n54. We also decided to crop the filming as you can see that the walls are made of glass and you can see the outside so while editing we will make sure to not show the glass walls. This area was perfect for a questioning scene as it had plain white tables and chairs which is a common thing to see at questioning areas, this will then tell the audience that the killer is unknown. For the ‘questioning shots’ we went to a place called the youth hub in which they had areas such as this studying room that we were are able to film in. shots: 20,21,22,23,24\n\n55. This fits the horror movies conventions as it will be dark, which will then give the audience a sense of foreboding as to what the girl is doing there For this shot we had to think of a new location that would be entirely dark and with no background, so we chose this area as it fits our criteria as it will be dark as there are no light sources that can enter the area. shots: 30\n\n56. Risk Assessment Perspective Risks? Who is affected by this risk? Risk rating /10 for danger? On hand control measures? What we can do to fix it? Who is responsible? The car in shot 6 of the teaser and 29 in the theatrical trailer may run out of petrol while driving. The main character driving the car could be injured if the petrol runs out while shes driving. 8/10 - depending on how serious the injures are Make sure her seat belt is on at all times, and full tank of petrol is filled prior to filming the scene. To fix this situation if it happens we will have to stop filming and depending on how serious the injuries are we may have to call the ambulance. The owner of the car is responsible for filming the tank. In shot 17 and 18 there is a large amount of fake blood on the floor which could maybe be a hazard because someone might Slip on the fake blood. Who ever is in the set of this scene, so the main character, the policeman, the investigator or the camera crew (sarah or roba). 6/10 - Someone on stand by always watching and warning people who walk past the fake blood on the floor, if this isn't possible then a yellow caution sign next to it is necessary. A first aid kit will be in the house incase someone trips and injuries themselves and in the worst case scenario if the injury is really bad (eg. head is hit on hard floor) then the ambulance will be called. All of us our responsible for this situation since it was a group decision to use fake blood on the floor, however if we will use a watch person instead of a caution sign then they are responsible for this situation. During shot 29 on the theatrical trailer and 6 on the teaser, the main character will be driving a car on the road. This maybe a hazard because trying to act while driving could lead to a car accident. The main character will be at risk since she is the one in the car as well as the person she may be in an accident with (so any other cars on the road during this time). 9/10 The main character driving needs to make sure her seatbelt is on to prevent her from having serious injuries and she needs to make sure she have 100% focus and control while driving and acting. o fix this situation if it happens we will have to stop filming and depending on how serious the injuries are we may have to call the ambulance. The person driving is responsible (the main character) because she needs to focus at all times while driving and to be cautious of other cars on the road. Also they will have to pay for the damages made to the car. Dana\n\n57. In shot 20 character 3 will be screaming extremely loud. This may be a risk because people in the area may think something bad has happened to her and may not be aware that we are acting. This may lead to them having a panic attack or calling the police. The public is affected by this (anyone in the area at the time). 5/10 To prevent this from happening we will try either go to the desert of an extremely abandoned location where there is no one around. Warn anyone who will potentially call the police or have a panic attack that we are just filming and show them our scrip for evidence. We are all responsible for this as it was a group decision to have the character scream. In shot 8 and 9 we will be showing the characters using fake drugs eg. flour or panadol to represent the drugs. This could be a risk because as the characters are fake sniffing the flour it may go up there nose or characters fake swallowing pills make choke on them. The main character and characters 2,3,4 and 5 in shots 8 and 9 of the theatrical trailer from the storyboard will be at risk since they are the ones fake using drugs. 9/10 To prevent any choking of flour sniffed we will practice prior to the filming to make sure we know the characters are built to do this scene without accidentally snorting or choking on the drugs. Ensure that if the flour goes up there nose that there is no harm (research). Each character is responsible for this as they should be very careful when using the fake drugs. In shot 4 and 27 (4 in the teaser and 27 in the theatrical trailer) the main character will be watching the girl through her window whilst standing on the road. This needs to be done to show the main characters personality is fearless. However this has a high risk of getting hit if by a car coming past as the main character is on the road. Strangers walking by, driver, anyone in area 10/10 - Getting hit by a car is extremely risky since it could lead to serious injuries and worst case death. To prevent this from happening we will have a person standing a couple miles further from the main character to warn her if any cars are coming to get of the road. We will also be doing this at a late time where there will be barely any cars on the road. Go to an empty road We are all responsible for this situation\n\n58. Shooting schedule/contingency plan (dana) Dana Day Equipment needed What we plan to get done Who is needed Constituency plan 1 - Makeup bag - Makeup products - Costumes (outfits) - Camera - Spare Batteries for camera - Portable Charger - bracelet In day one we plan to go to our first location which will be located in a house and we will film the first five shots of our storyboard (shot 1-5) where the girl is getting ready for the party by putting her makeup on as she is looking into the mirror. This should approximately take around 1 hour and a half to film since there will be a lot of time taken for the makeup artist to do the main characters makeup, costumes to be put on, and time taken to prepare the scene behind the scenes even though the shots will only be 20 seconds long. As well as the fact that it may take a lot of tries to get the perfect shots. The main character is needed as well and character 2 which will intrude into the room as the main character is putting her makeup on (shown in shot 4). As well as he makeup artist which will be doing the main character makeup for this scene since the trailer does show the main character half- way through doing her makeup but behind the scene the makeup artist will actually be doing this makeup look for the party for her as the main character is incapable of this skill. We will also need the camera crew which will be Sarah and Roba due to their prior knowledge of shots and the way we want the film to look. In case the character 2 is unavailable we will have a back up character one call away to fill in for character 2 and in the worst case scenario we will get our camera crew to fill in and put on character 2s costume. 2 - Fake drugs - Costumes - Camera - Extra batteries for camera - Tripod with wheels (for pan movements) - Party lights - Cups (filled with fake alcohol) - Water (to replace alcohol) - Phone (prop used to take a picture of girl) - Portable charger In day 2 we plan to film the next 8 shots so shot 8-15 from the storyboard which will be the actual party scenes showcasing the usage of drugs and effects it has on the main character afterwards. The location for this scene will be the same as day 1 we are still be in the house and we will be filming in the living room and bedroom. It will approximately take around 4 hours just because we are filming more shots in this day and there are many characters in these 8 shots and it will also it take many shots and tries to the perfect one since we want to achieve our highest potential, as well as the make-up artists having to do each of the 6 characters makeup and preparing the setting for the scenes. The reason we want to film all 8 shots in one day to prevent us having to continuously change costumes and prepare the setting in each day so its better to do these 8 shot that don't need any costume change. T In this scene we will need the main character and characters 2,3,4 and 5 who aren't main character but more so her friends that are in the party with her and background characters. We will also need the camera crew which are Sarah and Roba and the make-up artist. To prepare for these characters being unavailable at the time we will have backup characters just a call away just incase to make sure that we can still have people to film with. In the worst case scenario we will have to get our camera crew or main character to change into different costumes and act as the friends. Another worst case scenario is that if the camera crew are sick or unable to make it we will change the date.\n\n59. 3 - Camera - Spare batteries for camera - Camera prop - Tripod - Tripod with wheels - Costumes - Police costume - Body bag - Fake blood - Pills - Gloves - Bracelet On day 3 we plan to start the disruption part of our trailer it will have a more short day of filming where we will only film 3 shot, which are 16-18 from the storyboard. W plan for it to that take approximately 1 hour and 30 mins, the reason we will only film 3 shots is because a lot of detail and time goes into setting the crime scene up ready for filming. Not only this but we feel it’s more efficient if we film all the scenes with the same costumes and setting on the same day to avoid extra time wasted changing into costumes on the same day. This will also be filmed in the house same location as the party. A police man and investigator will be needed on this day as well as a character which will be in the body bag and our camera crew which is sarah and roba. To prepare for these characters being unavailable at the time we will have backup characters just a call away just incase to make sure that we can still have people to film with. In the worst case scenario we will have to get our camera crew or main character to change into different costumes and act as the friends. Another worst case scenario is that if the camera crew are sick or unable to make it we will change the date. 4 - Camera - Spare batteries for camera - Tripod - Costumes - Lamp - Police costume - Large table - Two chairs On day 4 we plan to shoot the different shots of the questioning room from shot 20 to 24 on the storyboard continuing and filming the disruption part of our trailer. This will take us approximately 2 and a half hours to since we need many different characters for these 4 shots. In these scenes we will need a police woman and character 2,3 and 4 as well as our camera crew sarah and roba. Worst case scenario we will have to get our camera crew to act but we will alway have backup actors in case. 5 - Camera - Spare batteries - Costumes - Tripod - Portable charger - car On day 5 we will film shots 26-30 the last 4 shots of our thaterial trailer. This will be the start of our montage and it should take approximately 5 hours since it will take many tries to get the perfect shot and we will have to go to many different locations for shot 29 and 30. This is because shot 29 will be on a road and 30 will be in abandoned area so the character is able to scream. The main character, character 2,3,4 and 5 and the camera crew (Roba and Sarah) will also be needed. As well as the makeup artists that will be working on trying to get the main character to look as scary as possible for shot 28 and 30. In case of missing characters we will have backup character just a call away. We also will have a backup car incase this one runs out of petro or breaks down. In the worst case scenario we will have to get sarah and roba to change into the different characters costumes. 6 - Camera - Costumes - Spare batteries - Tripod - Portable charger On our final day we will start our teaser, we will only need to film is shot 2 and 5 from our teaser storyboard because we are using the same montage we filmed for our theatrical trailer in our teaser. It should only take 2 hours. We will also use this say to re-film any changes we have made after editing and realising we might need to re-film some shot that may have not turned out perfectly. The main character and character 2 will be needed for these shot as well as our camera crew and make up artist to do the makeup of shot 5. Just in case character 2 is unavailable we will have backup character just a call away if need and in the worst case scenario the main character or camera crew can change into costume and replace them."
