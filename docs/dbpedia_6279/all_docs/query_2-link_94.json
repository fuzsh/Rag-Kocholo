        "text": "Various medications can help manage bipolar disorder, such as antidepressants and lithium, which is a mood stabilizer. Working with a doctor, a person can often find effective treatment.\n\nBipolar disorder is a mood disorder that involves extreme changes in mood, behavior, energy, and thought patterns. A person with bipolar disorder experiences significant highs and lows. The clinical terms for these states are mania and depression.\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 2.8% of adults in the United States have bipolar disorder.\n\nDoctors often find it challenging to treat because everyone responds to the medications differently.\n\nMany people with bipolar disorder try several medications before they find one that works for them. Some people also find that managing their symptoms requires more than one type of medication.\n\nDifferent types, or classes, of drugs can safely and effectively treat bipolar disorder.\n\nFinding the right medication\n\nFinding the right combination of medications to treat bipolar disorder can take some time. A doctor considers a person’s symptoms and tries to find the right medications to match them. It is best if a person is open with their doctor about any new or changing symptoms and side effects. The doctor can then adjust the treatment accordingly.\n\nLithium goes by the generic names lithium carbonate, which comes as capsules and tablets, and lithium citrate, which comes in liquid form. There are several brand names, such as Eskalith, Eskalith CR, and Lithobid.\n\nLithium works in the brain to help stabilize moods. Doctors may prescribe it to help treat bipolar disorder or acute mania.\n\nThe dosage is usually 600–1,800 milligrams (mg) of lithium carbonate daily.\n\nLithium is fast-acting and may treat acute manic episodes.\n\nDoctors have prescribed lithium to treat bipolar disorder for decades, despite the range of possible side effects. These can include:\n\nnausea\n\nshaking\n\ndry mouth\n\nfrequent urination\n\ndiarrhea\n\nweight gain\n\nincreased thirst\n\nloss of appetite\n\nkidney damage\n\nreduced thyroid activity\n\nfatigue\n\nemotional numbness, or a “dull” feeling\n\nIt is essential for people taking lithium to stay hydrated. This keeps lithium levels in the blood from becoming toxic. A doctor typically monitors these levels regularly.\n\nSigns of lithium toxicity, or excess lithium in the blood, include:\n\ndifficulty concentrating\n\nconfusion\n\nfatigue\n\nvomiting\n\ndiarrhea\n\nless coordination\n\nmuscle weakness, twitching, and tremors\n\nan irregular heart rhythm\n\nseizures\n\nIf anyone has symptoms of lithium toxicity, it is best to call 911 or the local emergency number. Lithium overdoses can result in coma and death.\n\nA doctor also monitors levels of creatinine in the blood to ensure that the kidneys are handling the drug well. Creatinine is a waste product that the kidneys create. When blood creatinine levels are high, it is often a sign that the kidneys are not working correctly.\n\nAnticonvulsants treat conditions that cause seizures, but they can also help manage mania and bipolar disorder.\n\nDoctors often refer to anticonvulsants that treat bipolar disorder as “mood stabilizers.”\n\nThey may prescribe the following anticonvulsants for bipolar disorder:\n\ndivalproex sodium (Depakote)\n\nlamotrigine (Lamictal)\n\nvalproic acid (Depakene)\n\ncarbamazepine (Equetro)\n\ntopiramate (Topamax)\n\nSome common side effects of anticonvulsant medications include:\n\nnausea\n\nshaking\n\nweight gain\n\ndizziness\n\ndrowsiness\n\nblurred vision\n\ndry mouth\n\nTopiramate may have different or additional side effects, including:\n\nweight loss\n\nmemory issues\n\nemotional numbness or a “dull” feeling\n\nkidney stones\n\nLamotrigine can also sometimes cause a rash that requires medical attention.\n\nDoctors may not prescribe valproic acid during pregnancy, as it may cause some congenital anomalies.\n\nDoctors typically prescribe antipsychotic medications to treat schizophrenia.\n\nHowever, antipsychotics can also help manage bipolar disorder, especially when periods of psychosis occur during severe depression or mania.\n\nA doctor may prescribe an antipsychotic drug “off-label” to help manage bipolar disorder. This means the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of this drug for this purpose.\n\nHowever, a few antipsychotics do have FDA approval to treat bipolar disorder, including:\n\nFor acute bipolar mania\n\nolanzapine (Zyprexa)\n\nrisperidone (Risperdal)\n\nquetiapine fumarate (Seroquel)\n\nasenapine (Saphris)\n\naripiprazole (Abilify)\n\nziprasidone (Geodon)\n\niloperidone (Fanapt)\n\nolanzapine/fluoxetine (Symbyax)\n\npaliperidone (Invega)\n\nFor bipolar maintenance\n\naripiprazole (Abilify)\n\nolanzapine (Zyprexa)\n\nrisperidone (Risperdal Consta)\n\nFor bipolar depression\n\nquetiapine (Seroquel XR)\n\nlurasidone HCl (Latuda)\n\nolanzapine/fluoxetine (Symbyax)\n\ncariprazine (Vraylar)\n\nSome possible side effects of antipsychotic medications include:\n\ndrowsiness and sedation\n\ndry mouth\n\nshaking\n\nincreased appetite\n\nweight gain\n\nconstipation\n\nlow blood pressure\n\nrestlessness\n\nincreased saliva\n\nreduced libido or sexual dysfunction\n\nAsenapine can cause numbness and an unusual taste in the mouth. Ziprasidone may cause heart problems.\n\nAntidepressants can help manage the symptoms of bipolar depression, though scientists are still researching their efficacy. They work by acting on brain chemicals called neurotransmitters.\n\nA person who takes antidepressants for bipolar disorder also needs to take a mood stabilizer to help prevent the risk of mania.\n\nOne medication, called Symbyax, is a mix of both an antidepressant (fluoxetine) and an antipsychotic (olanzapine). This can help treat depression while also stabilizing mood.\n\nThere are several classes of antidepressants, each of which targets a different neurotransmitter or set of neurotransmitters. The FDA has not approved specific antidepressants to treat bipolar disorder, so any prescription may be off-label.\n\nSome classes of antidepressants that may reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder include:\n\nSerotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\nlevomilnacipran (Fetzima)\n\nduloxetine (Cymbalta, Yentreve)\n\nvenlafaxine (Effexor)\n\ndesvenlafaxine (Khedezla, Pristiq)\n\nmilnacipran (Savella)\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n\ncitalopram (Celexa)\n\nfluvoxamine (Luvox)\n\nescitalopram (Lexapro)\n\nfluoxetine (Prozac)\n\nparoxetine (Paxil)\n\nsertraline (Zoloft)\n\nTricyclics and tetracyclics\n\nclomipramine (Anafranil)\n\namitriptyline (Elavil)\n\ndesipramine (Norpramin)\n\nimipramine (Tofranil)\n\nnortriptyline (Pamelor)\n\ndoxepin (Silenor, Zonalon, Prudoxin)\n\ntrimipramine (Surmontil)\n\nprotriptyline (Vivactil)\n\nmaprotiline (Ludiomil)\n\namoxapine (Asendin)\n\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)\n\nphenelzine (Nardil)\n\ntranylcypromine (Parnate)\n\nmoclobemide (Amira, Aurorix, Clobemix)\n\nisocarboxazid\n\nEach group of antidepressants and each specific drug can have different side effects. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants include:\n\nsexual dysfunction\n\ndizziness\n\ninsomnia\n\nsleepiness\n\ndry mouth\n\nagitation, anxiety, and nervousness\n\nweight gain\n\nlow blood pressure\n\nA doctor may prescribe antianxiety medication, such as a benzodiazepine, for short-term use. These can also help with sleep. Doctors typically do not prescribe these drugs for long periods due to the risk of tolerance and dependence.\n\nExamples include:\n\ndiazepam (Valium)\n\nalprazolam (Xanax)\n\nclonazepam (Klonopin)\n\nclorazepate (Tranxene T-Tab)\n\nlorazepam (Lorazepam Intensol, Ativan)\n\noxazepam (Alepam)\n\nDoctors prescribe medications as the first line of treatment for bipolar disorder. Some people find that additional approaches, including some self-care strategies, help manage their condition along with medication.\n\nSome additional ways to help manage bipolar disorder include:\n\nreceiving psychotherapy\n\nexercising regularly\n\nhaving a healthy sleep schedule\n\neating a nutrient-dense, balanced diet\n\nusing relaxation or mindfulness techniques\n\nreducing or avoiding alcohol use\n\nEach medication can cause side effects. These vary from drug to drug and class to class.\n\nFor example, side effects of antipsychotics can include:\n\ndrowsiness\n\nlack of emotion\n\nrestlessness\n\ndry mouth\n\nweight gain\n\nLithium, one of the most commonly prescribed mood stabilizers, can cause:\n\nthirst\n\nexcessive urination\n\nnausea\n\ndiarrhea\n\ntremor\n\nweight gain\n\ncognitive issues\n\nkidney and thyroid issues\n\nSome side effects may resolve within a few days or weeks, while others may last longer.\n\nA healthcare professional may be able to describe ways of reducing side effects, such as taking medications at different times of the day or with food.\n\nA person should always consult a doctor about any severe, concerning, or persistent side effects. They may modify the dosage or recommend a different treatment. An individual can also inform the doctor if any treatment is still not reducing the symptoms.\n\nFinding the right medication can be a slow process, but it is best to talk with a doctor before ending the treatment. A person should also tell a doctor if they have missed more than one or two doses.\n\nSeveral types of medication can effectively treat bipolar disorder. However, each can cause side effects.\n\nMany mild or moderate side effects may resolve within the first weeks or months. However, if side effects are concerning or bothersome, it is best for people to speak with the doctor.\n\nIf any side effect seems dangerous, a person should contact emergency services. Some medications, especially lithium-based drugs, can cause complications that require urgent care.\n\nAn individual may need to seek emergency care if any of the following arise:\n\nsevere or sudden changes of any kind\n\nmuscle weakness, a tremor, or a twitch\n\ndifficulty concentrating\n\nconfusion\n\na severe rash\n\njaundice, which is yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes\n\nan irregular heartbeat or other heart-related symptoms\n\na fever\n\nthoughts of suicide\n\nhallucinations, such as hearing voices that are not there\n\nIn many cases, finding the right treatment requires patience and a trial-and-error approach. Combining drug-based treatment with other methods, such as psychotherapy and stress-management techniques, can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life."
