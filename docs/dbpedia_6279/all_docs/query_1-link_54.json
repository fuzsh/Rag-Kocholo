        "text": "The Wonder by J.D. Beresford\n\nreviewed by Georges T. Dodds\n\nFirst published in Britain in 1911, this was the first novel to deal fully with the sociological implications of a vastly superior human amongst us. Since then, numerous genre titles have appeared all following superhuman children in one way or another. This story stands out by avoiding the sensationalism and paranoia of much of the later works.\n\nPrisoner of Haven by Nancy Varian Berberick\n\nreviewed by Cindy Lynn Speer\n\nDezra Majere visits Haven every year in order to collect supplies needed for the family's tavern. This year she takes her sister-in-law Usha with her, knowing that the painter needs distraction from the troubles in her marriage. Usha knows that times are getting harder in Haven. Dezra confirms it when she tells Usha that the supplies that they have come to gather -- hops, wine, spirits -- are no longer available. Then the dragons attack, trapping everyone in the city.\n\nSon of Avonar by Carol Berg\n\nreviewed by Cindy Lynn Speer\n\nLife these past ten years has not been easy for Seri, once a duchess and now a peasant trying to fill her belly by gathering dyestuffs and selling them. When she runs into a wild young man in the woods, naked and insane, she wisely runs away. Until an old enemy shows up on her doorstep who demands to know if she has seen him. Despite her better judgment she goes back for the young man. She soon discovers that he's capable of sorcery, an ability punishable by death by burning. Seri knows this quite well. Her beloved husband was discovered to be a sorcerer, and was burned at the stake. Her son was taken from her moments after his birth and killed.\n\nRestoration by Carol Berg\n\nreviewed by Donna McMahon\n\nWhen the king of Azhakstan is murdered, enemies accuse his son, Aleksander, of treachery and drive him from his kingdom. But Seyonne, former body slave to the prince, knows that Aleksander is the kingdom's best hope. So he leaves his quiet retreat in the countryside and returns to Aleksander's service, following him into exile and using his growing magical powers to help the rightful king regain the throne.\n\nThe Divine Theory of Everything: Book 1, Wanderer by Robert D. Berger\n\nreviewed by Sandra Scholes\n\nBringing together the theories of science and religion; two topics that have not always got on together, the author ponders on whether man was made as per Darwin's theory or by God. The novel reads like a history of evolution and the history of spirituality from other countries. Certain names like The Priestess and Seth are synonymous with Celtic and Egyptian myth also, and the story can be seen as a fantasy crossed with science fiction.\n\nVintage: A Ghost Story by Steve Berman\n\nreviewed by Sherwood Smith\n\nOne night while walking down a deserted highway in September, our protagonist sees a handsome boy who is wearing a 50s costume, or is it a costume? We soon discover that he is the ghost of an athlete who met his death years before, and the town has known about this ghost walking the highway since 1957. But for the first time, Josh, the ghost, leaves the highway and follows someone, and even speaks to him.\n\nMirror, Mirror on the Wall edited by Kate Bernheimer\n\nreviewed by Alma A. Hromic\n\nIt is a delicate cordial, to be sipped and savoured, sampling and tasting and coming back again and again to a selection of essays by such luminaries as Ursula K. Le Guin, Margaret Atwood, A.S. Byatt, Terry Windling, Midori Snyder, Fay Weldon, Julia Alvarez and Joyce Carol Oates amongst others. It is a rich celebration of the most ancient kind of story ever told -- the fairy tale -- seen with the feminine eye.\n\nPassion Play by Beth Bernobich\n\nreviewed by Rich Horton\n\nTherez Zhalina is the daughter of a rich merchant in the city of Melnek in the country of Veraene. She hopes to have her life broadened when she accompanies her older brother to his university. Alas, all her plans are destroyed when her father decides to marry her off to an influential man. But Therez, on meeting the man, takes an immediate dislike to him, and is further furious at the lack of any consideration of her own future. So she decides to run away.\n\nPassion Play by Beth Bernobich\n\nreviewed by Sherwood Smith\n\nTherez is a typical teen, revelling in her own intelligence, sure she's figured out the world. Like many smart teens, when presented with her first big challenge (and it's a very big one) she cuts and runs, not really considering that there could be worse things out there than her problems at home. And she finds them when she joins a caravan.\n\nArs Memoriae by Beth Bernobich\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nSet against a world in which Irish Queen Áine Lasairíona Devereaux rules over a fractious England, the story concerns Commander Adrian Dee, who is sent on a mission to Montenegro to seek out Anglian activists. We follow Dee as he crosses Europe and must not only find the cell of Anglians but also figure out who the traitor is among the Queen's court.\n\nThe Last Dragonlord by Joanne Bertin\n\nreviewed by Todd Richmond\n\nThis first novel is filled with a richness of detail that makes you want to know more. Linden Rathan, the main character comes alive in the book: you feel his joy and his pain, his sense of compassion and anger but, most of the time, you get the feeling that he is just a lonely man, searching for companionship and comfort.\n\nBest of the Web 2000\n\nreviewed by Trent Walters\n\nThe Web is in dire need of a critical foundation, lest it risk no one taking it seriously. The Preditors and Editors website has attempted to settle that with a poll based on popular vote. It's excellent in idea, valiant in the attempt and much needed to dredge through the sludge of written Web material, but the present system is flawed.\n\nThe Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nYou've probably seen this novel included in every SF Top 10 List published. 45 years have passed since it was first published and it's yet to be knocked out of the masters' circle. That's a pretty impressive statement. Bester's classic has the stuff to back it up. Gully Foyle is not exactly one of the good guys, but he's your hero for this trip. Foyle's life has never been easy, but as the novel opens he is in about the worst predicament of his life -- stranded in space, alone, with little or no chance of rescue.\n\nThe Demolished Man by Alfred Bester\n\nreviewed by Todd Richmond\n\nIt takes place in a future where a small percentage of the population has developed telepathic powers. Called peepers, they have revolutionized business, government, and, most importantly, law enforcement. In fact, no act of premeditated murder has been committed in more than 70 years. So Lincoln Polwell is somewhat astonished to be summoned to a popular socialite's home to investigate both a murder and a disappearance.\n\nA Hazy Shade of Winter by Simon Bestwick\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nA few years ago, the author came to everyone's attention with \"Graven\" in Darkness Rising One: Night's Soft Pains. This beautiful, unique tale presents a relationship readers can instantly identify with and mourn; a universal experience of love's strains and lasting power. How fitting that \"Graven\" graces the author's first collection, a debut guaranteed to start him on the road to well-deserved literary fame. No longer will he remain a precious secret shared by a select circle of fans; after this, everyone is going to be watching his career blossom.\n\nThe Fifth Science Fiction Megapack: 25 Modern and Classic Science Fiction Stories edited by John Betancourt\n\nreviewed by Cyd Athens\n\nThe 5th volume in the Science Fiction Megapack ebook series presents 25 tales of high adventure through other worlds and times, including two award winners: Avram Davidson's Hugo-winning story, \"Or All the Seas with Oysters,\" and Gardner Dozois's \"The Peacemaker,\" which won a Nebula Award, and several nominees: Nebula Award finalist \"The Eichmann Variations,\" by George Zebrowski; Hugo finalist \"Code Three,\" by Rick Raphael; and,\"May Be Some Time,\" by Brenda Clough, which was both a Hugo and a Nebula finalist.\n\nChaos and Amber by John Gregory Betancourt\n\nreviewed by Steve Lazarowitz\n\nAdmittedly, this second book of the new series reminded Steve more of the second Amber series, than the first but, aside from that, it's eminently entertaining. The main character is Oberon, son of Dworkin, who was raised on a shadow world, in complete ignorance of his true heritage. It answers some of the questions raised in Dawn of Amber and leaves a few others in its wake.\n\nRoger Zelazny's The Dawn of Amber by John Gregory Betancourt\n\nreviewed by Alma A. Hromic\n\nThe novel chronicles the adventures of Oberon, whom we know from Zelazny's books to have been a much-married and very fecund King of Amber. The story begins with one Alma's own personal Literary Cardinal Sins -- the Dream Sequence. This is a fantasy -- more, it is a fantasy rooted in Zelazny, and Zelazny's imagination could be extremely strange.\n\nDouble Helix: Infection by John Gregory Betancourt\n\nreviewed by Todd Richmond\n\nJean-Luc Picard, in his first year as Captain of the Enterprise, is sent to Archaria III, where a raging epidemic is sweeping the planet. It's a particularly nasty disease that only strikes down individuals with mixed genetic backgrounds. (Perhaps you'll want to take a moment to think of which Enterprise crew members are at risk...)\n\nThe Lesbian Fantastic by Phyllis M. Betz\n\nreviewed by Sandra Scholes\n\nThis critical study of science fiction and other related genres is comprised of several chapters that deal with lesbian writing and the novels which feature prominent lesbian characters. Phyllis M. Betz leaves no stone unturned with her analysis of lesbians in famous fiction whether it is old or new. For many, lesbians have been seen as frightening characters in novels due to their differences to other more feminine heroines.\n\nMoxyland by Lauren Beukes\n\nreviewed by Bonnie L. Norman\n\nThe gap between the haves and the have-nots has spread to a Grand Canyon sized gulf. Set in the near future of South Africa, it follows the interweaving story of four very different kinds of people. In each perspective, the person is somehow controlled or subsumed by the technology society has come to rely on, bringing to mind visions of how claustrophobic and wired life could eventually become.\n\nOf Wind and Sand by Sylvie Bérard\n\nreviewed by Paul Kincaid\n\nThe premise is that a human ship has landed on the planet the passengers christen Mars II. Ostensibly the ship is there for repair, though we never learn how it was damaged, we see no attempt to effect repairs, and later the ship will take off with no apparent problem. Instead, the humans decide to settle, and immediately embark upon a war with the race of intelligent lizards who inhabit the planet.\n\nShapestone by James Bibby\n\nreviewed by Lisa Brunetta\n\nMarauding orcs, a novice magician, an attractive damsel in distress, the Guild of Assassins, incompetent officers of the law nipping off for a pint during working hours, and a rollicking, hilarious adventure set in a sprawling metropolis with numerous pubs and back alleys. Does this sound familiar to you? It will if you're a fan of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels -- but in that case you should enjoy this book, too.\n\nThe Billy Meier Story\n\na DVD review by Kit O'Connell\n\nWho is Billy Meier? While you may not know his name, if you've seen a UFO documentary then you have almost certainly seen his work before. Close your eyes for a moment and picture a flying saucer -- from a photo or film footage you've seen. It floats gently over a green, sparsely vegetated Alpine landscape, perhaps hovering in place or orbiting lazily around a tree.\n\nThe Wanderer's Tale by David Bilsborough\n\nreviewed by Tammy Moore\n\nIt starts in Vaagenfjord Maw, the final battle in an epic war between good and evil. Scathur, servant of the Rawgr and General of his armies, fulfils one last request for his dark master, a request that taints the victory of the Pel-Adan forces for centuries to come. Five hundred years later, there are still those who fear that the Rawgr will return and they have the ear of powerful men.\n\nAngels of Vengeance by John Birmingham\n\nreviewed by Nathan Brazil\n\nAngels of Vengeance is the sequel to Without Warning and After America. The premise is that a wave of entirely unknown energy descended upon North America, wiping out much of the population but leaving structures intact. Unattended, nuclear power plants ran amok and cities burned. Until the mysterious wave lifted as suddenly and inexplicably as it had arrived, no human being could set foot inside the vast area it covered. As this novel commences, the US is struggling to drag itself up by the bootstraps, and is in danger of descending into civil war due to the rebellious inclinations of Texas Governor 'Mad Jack' Blackstone.\n\nAfter America by John Birmingham\n\nreviewed by Nathan Brazil\n\nSet a mere handful of years from where Without Warning left off, the story opens with President James Kipper leading the effort to reclaim an America that is now free of the deadly energy wave which erased most of the living things within its borders. Gone, as quickly and mysteriously as it came -- and without any explanation -- what is left behind is a vast country in which most of the cities are burned out ruins.\n\nWithout Warning by John Birmingham\n\nreviewed by Nathan Brazil\n\nThe setting is March 14, 2003, where US armed forces are poised to invade Iraq. In an instant, there is a major and catastrophic change. A mysterious wave of energy appears with no warning, standing miles high and encompassing much of Canada, Mexico, half of Cuba and almost the entire United States. All life caught within the standing wave vanishes, leaving vast areas unattended, and instantly impenetrable except by unmanned drones. The only Americans left alive are those overseas when the wave struck, the military outposts in Pearl Harbour and Guantanamo Bay, plus the city of Seattle which stands just outside of the wave.\n\nAxis of Time Trilogy by John Birmingham\n\nreviewed by Nathan Brazil\n\nIt's a tale sprawling across several years, beginning with a catastrophic accident that tears a hole in time, throwing an international fleet from 2021 back to 1942. The uptimers emerge at night, slap bang in the middle of the US task force heading toward Midway Atoll. A major problem is a side effect of the unexpected time travel which causes most of the future crew to arrive unconscious, or barely functional. Sensing the danger, their computer controlled Combat Intelligence acts in defence when elements of the '42 fleet attack, quickly leading to all guns blazing on both sides.\n\nAxis of Time Trilogy by John Birmingham\n\nreviewed by Peter D. Tillman\n\nA naval task force from 2021 is diverted to 1942 by a DARPA teleportation experiment gone spectacularly wrong. In the confusion of the transition, the moderns sink most of Admiral Spruance's fleet, enroute to the Battle of Midway. The trilogy goes on to re-fight WW2, and to show once again that the oldest cliché can look fresh in the hands of a good writer with a new approach.\n\nThe Shadow Chaser by Dylan Birtolo\n\nreviewed by David Hebblethwaite\n\nDarien Yost wakes one evening, having passed out, with a ravenous appetite and no memory of what happened. Is his friend Ellen right that this is a hangover? Is it, as government agent Michael Olson suggests, the result of some contamination in the area? Or could it be something else entirely? Events suggest the last, when a mysterious and beautiful woman named Alyssa invades Darien's dreams and then turns up in reality -- and when Olson's men make an attempt on his life...\n\nAnne Bishop\n\nOperation Vampyr by David Bishop\n\nreviewed by Nathan Brazil\n\nSubtitled 'Fiends of the Eastern Front,' this is the first in a new series, combining WWII military action with the supernatural. Set in 1941 it features the adventures of the brothers Vollmer, not a circus troupe but three German soldiers battling their way across Russia. These Germans have a unique ally, the 1st Rumanian Mountain Troop. As the brothers' adventures progress and intertwine, we find out just what makes the Rumanians so feared by the retreating Russians, and so dangerous to the Fatherland.\n\nThe Door Gunner and Other Perilous Flights of Fancy by Michael Bishop\n\nreviewed by Paul Kincaid\n\nBack in the mid-70s, in the first volume of an original anthology series that never saw volume two, Paul came across a novella called \"On the Street of the Serpents\" by Michael Bishop. It was, along with fictions by Samuel R. Delany and James Tiptree, Jr. whose work he was also discovering at that time, a story that helped to change the way he read science fiction. He didn't realize how new Bishop was as a writer, but he was doing something sophisticated, original, and challenging with the form, and it caught Paul's imagination.\n\nBlue Kansas Sky by Michael Bishop\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nHe has written some of the best speculative fiction of the last 20 years, ranging from the gritty Minor League baseball novel Brittle Innings to the romantic anthropological novel Ancient of Days. The author's writing has never fully managed to find the audience it deserves. This is his 5th collection. If there is justice in the world, it will introduce his work to a wider readership.\n\nTerry Bisson\n\nArthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black\n\nreviewed by Charlene Brusso\n\nThis book is companion to the popular fantasy series The Spiderwick Chronicles, but you don't need to have read the Chronicles, to enjoy this gorgeous tome. The opening chapters contain all manner of helpful information for those seeking to explore the world of fantastical creatures. For example, fairies like milk and are drawn to it; they like lukewarm the best. And for getting rid of them, a bag of salt is likewise handy.\n\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black\n\nreviewed by Charlene Brusso\n\nThe series opens with the Grace family, moving into their great aunt Lucinda's decrepit old Victorian house. Mom tries to put a hopeful spin on things, but the Grace children -- daughter Mallory, the oldest, and twins Simon and Jared (our narrator) -- are not happy campers. Aunt Lucinda's house is full of cobwebs and creaky old furniture, untrustworthy electricity, and a strange scrabbling in the walls. While investigating the noises, Jared discovers a secret room full of pilfered knick-knacks. This is home to the grumpy household brownie Thimbletack, who doesn't want outsiders in his house.\n\nDark Side of the Moon by J. Carson Black\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nThe author continues to ignore the common wisdom of writing: debut novels are supposed to be rough and uncertain, fledgling steps into the genre, sophomore efforts stumble coming out of the gate. Right? Wrong. Starting with a spectacular debut that was one of the best novels of 2005, she follows up with a second volume in the Laura Cardinal series that may, in fact, be even better than the first. With a record like that, she is a force to be reckoned with and an author to keep an eye on.\n\nDarkness on the Edge of Town by J. Carson Black\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nThere ought to be a law that novels should not be this well-plotted, assured, and addictive. It just ain't right. It may be the complex, compelling characters, the vivid, out-of-the-way settings, or the constant tension the author weaves into the story, but once you started reading you'll move faster and faster, with no way to stop until the breathtaking ending. Forget sleep, because you won't have time for such trivialities; you're here to read.\n\nThe Devil You Know by Jenna Black\n\nreviewed by Nathan Brazil\n\nThe publisher describes the goings on here as; \"The beautiful. The bad. The possessed.\" What that translates to is a somewhat camp, demons and damp knickers pot boiler, featuring possessed exorcist Morgan Kingsley. A woman who is one of the few humans with an aura stronger than her possessor. In this world, possession is rather common, it seems. As the story opens, Morgan has recently become aware that her entire past, including her identity, might be a lie.\n\nBlack Gate\n\nBlack Static, Issue 25, November 2011\n\nreviewed by Sandra Scholes\n\nThis time around, Black Static boasts of reviews of new novels, anthologies, collections and even novellas plus DVD and Blu-ray reviews and give-aways of free copies. There is a lot of information packed into a sixty-four page issue that tests the boundaries of the unusual, fantastic and truly horrific.\n\nBlack Static, Issue 21, February-March 2011\n\nreviewed by Sandra Scholes\n\nThis issue has to be read to be believed, Peter Tennant's column being the best, Ray Cluley and Maura McHugh's stories captivate, and Mike O Driscoll's argument on genre fiction makes it a very enjoyable magazine that's well worth getting your hands on.\n\nBlack Static, Issue 19, October-November 2010\n\nreviewed by Sandra Scholes\n\nAs well as the usual array of short stories, and information on where to get new novels in this month's issue of Black Static, Peter Tennant's Case Notes has some reviews on the latest books out there and an interview of Stephen Jones, \"Home is Where the Horror Is.\" This time out, Tennant reviews the latest anthologies in horror such as The Mammoth Book of the Best of Best New Horror: A Twenty Year Celebration edited by Stephen Jones, The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror Volume 21 also edited by Stephen Jones, and Zombie Apocalypse!, created by Stephen Jones.\n\nBlack Static #10, May 2009\n\nreviewed by Jonathan McCalmont\n\nIt is possible to buy Black Static purely \"for the articles.\" By which Jonathan means the non-fiction elements. The magazine features interesting and engaging columns from Christopher Fowler, Stephen Volk and Mike O'Driscoll as well as fascinating interviews with Ellen Datlow and Thomas Ligotti. However, the real stars are Tony Lee's enthusiastic DVD round-up and Contributing Editor Peter Tennant's magnificent book reviews.\n\nStar Wars: The New Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology by W. Haden Blackman\n\nreviewed by David Maddox\n\nLightsabers, Ion Cannons and Wookie bow casters may be second nature to Star Wars fans, but what about Plasma Cannons, Amphistaffs and Vonduun-Crab-Shell-Plated Armor? All these bizarre pieces of technology and more are there for the learning in this compendium of weapons and technology.\n\nEdge by Thomas Blackthorne\n\nreviewed by Seamus Sweeney\n\nIn a near-future Britain which is in many respects hardly distinguishable from the present state of that green and pleasant land, it is a country of privatised surveillance, economic angst, and fears of arbitrary terrorism -- like today, except more so. In a world where the United States has broken up into fissile fragments, and the fundamentalist President of the rump US destablises what seems to be a fragile world disorder, Britain has seen the return of legalised duelling.\n\nKilling Frost by Dan L. Blake\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nIt reads like a late-night movie. Yes, there are flaws, but the action moves so fast that you aren't going to have time to dwell on them. Yes, you know it's a school night, but you are going to stay up until you finish it. And, yes, you'd be really surprised to hear it mentioned at an awards show.\n\nVoices of Vision by Jayme Lynn Blaschke\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nThis collection of interviews run the gamut of the field, including authors and editors and comic book writers. From recently published authors such as Patricia Anthony to stalwarts of the field such as Jack Williamson, these interviews give a broad look, not just at the history of the field, but at the breadth of topics which can be covered, and the manner in which they can be covered, under the rubric of science fiction.\n\nDimiter by William Peter Blatty\n\nan audiobook review by Gil T. Wilson\n\nThe author of The Exorcist has a new book out, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a horror novel. While this book does delve into some mysticism, it is pretty much a spy thriller. The story opens in the 1970s in Albania, when a prisoner suspected of being an enemy agent is captured and subjected to horrendous torture. The prisoner is known as Dimiter, the American \"agent from Hell.\"\n\nDimiter by William Peter Blatty\n\nan audiobook review by Gil T.

Blaylock short stories will be welcome news to the many worldwide fans of this writer, particularly in light of the fact that it has been four long years since we last had the pleasure of a Blaylock novel. The author is clearly still very active in the short fiction market and, as illustrated by this new collection, is right at the top of his game. The most enduring qualities of his work is that it is, and should be, required re-reading. Like a painting by an acknowledged master, this is work that can be viewed time and time again, with each visitation revealing something new and hugely rewarding.\n\nThe Rainy Season by James P. Blaylock\n\nreviewed by Rodger Turner\n\nJames P. Blaylock brings us another of his modern gothic tales. He captures the creepy elegance of place, not in the setting of castles and moors but rather in a neo-Victorian farmhouse and an avocado ranch in Southern California. This novel provides us with a mixture of the mundane and the supernatural, woven together with a smart degree of wit and acuity.\n\nWinter Tides by James P. Blaylock\n\nreviewed by Rodger Turner\n\nFor Rodger, the sheer maliciousness with which one of the characters goes through life has made this book one of Blaylock's most intriguing to date.\n\nBlood Groove by Alex Bledsoe\n\nan audiobook review by Jennifer McCann\n\nIf you're looking for a vampire romance like Twilight, this is not the story for you. No, this is a dark, wet, sticky, ugly, gritty visit to the anti-Twilight. Beginning many years earlier, at the staking of the vampire, Baron Rudolfo Zginski, this is a tale of Old World vampiric culture clashing with the \"tuned in, turned on, dropped out\" culture of the 70s. Picture Roller Boogie meets Bram Stoker.\n\nThe Sword-Edged Blonde by Alex Bledsoe\n\nan audiook review by Susan Dunman\n\nEddie LaCrosse is a no-nonsense Private Investigator who, for the right amount of gold coin, will use his considerable skill at sword-wielding and sleuthing to find out what you need to know in any kingdom of the realm. With an office located over Angelina's Tavern in the backwater town of Neceda, Eddie waits for new business.\n\nIn This World or Another by James Blish\n\nreviewed by Cindy Lynn Speer\n\nThis is a very strong collection of stories. Most people may connect the author with the original Star Trek, and while he did some great work there, he is really so much more. This collection is a great tribute to one of the masters of the SF genre.\n\nA Case Of Conscience by James Blish\n\nreviewed by Martin Lewis\n\nA contact team of four scientists have been sent to decide whether to open up Lithia to Earth. This decision is complicated by the fact that Lithia is inhabited by intelligent, civilized aliens with the appearance of 12-foot high reptilian kangaroos. Michelis believes the planet should be opened up so Earth can benefit from contact with the peaceful, unified Lithians; Carver believes the planet's high quantity of lithium makes it ideal for turning into a bomb factory; Agronski is undecided, flitting between both views; Ruiz-Sanchez, a priest as well as a biologist, believes Lithia should be placed in permanent quarantine because it is a creation of the devil.\n\nThe Seedling Stars by James Blish\n\nreviewed by Rich Horton\n\nThe central theme uniting the stories of this episodic novel is that humanity will colonize other planets not by adapting the environment of those planets to men (terraforming), nor by avoiding the environment of other planets (living in domes, say), but by adapting men to alien environments. By so doing, man will \"seed\" the stars. Representing some of the author's very best work, he takes a striking idea and develops it fully, in the best tradition of pure SF.\n\nYours Truly, Jack the Ripper by Robert Bloch\n\nreviewed by Richard A. Lupoff\n\nSo many authors are known for a single work or even a single character that it practically becomes part of their names: \"Mary-Shelley-author-of-Frankenstein,\" \"Harriet-Beecher-Stowe-author-of-Uncle-Tom's-Cabin, Arthur-Conan-Doyle-creator-of-Sherlock-Holmes,\" \"Bram-Stoker-author-of-Dracula.\" It's a rarity that this kind of lightning strikes the same author twice, but it happened to Robert Bloch. He became famous for his short story, \"Yours Truly  Jack the Ripper,\" that appeared in Weird Tales in 1943. For a good many years he was known as \"Robert-Bloch-author-of-'Yours-Truly-Jack-the-Ripper.'\" But then one of his short novels was published by Simon & Shuster with little fanfare titled Psycho. And the author would be known for the rest of his days as \"Robert-Bloch-author-of-Psycho.\"\n\nThe Fear Planet and Other Unusual Destinations by Robert Bloch\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nThis collection is part of a series of previously unreprinted Robert Bloch stories. It begs the question \"why?\" If Bloch himself did not see the value in reprinting these stories after they provided him with initial payment, why would a publisher and editor think they have value at this late date? One part of the answer is for the collectors, but another part of the answer is to compare the stories to chocolate. Any chocolate is better than no\n\nHell on Earth by Robert Bloch\n\nreviewed by Georges T. Dodds\n\nThis collection presents 4 novellas from the author's pre-Psycho but post-Lovecraftian era. They are down and dirty pulp literature, ranging from humorous fantasy to occult and noir horror. While his works aren't the sorts of things one would reread to find the intricate plotting and meaning of a Tolkien, they are very entertaining, suspenseful and fun to read.\n\nFairy Tales in Electri-City by Francesca Lia Block\n\nreviewed by Sandra Scholes\n\nThere is a lot to enjoy with this collection. Starting when the reader first looks at the book, they will be surprised at how small the book is, and also how well designed it is. Her poetry and stories are about several fantasy creatures; elves, centaurs, fairies, and nymphs. There are some erotic ones though too.\n\nStory Time by Edward Bloor\n\nreviewed by Matthew Hughes\n\nIt is set in a corrupt US county where the school board and the local government are so firmly under the sway of one greedy family that they allow them to shanghai public school students into the fee-charging Whittaker Magnet School, where the concept of \"teaching to the test\" goes reductio ad absurdum and then keeps right on going. The brightest kids on the county sit in rows in the basement of the Whittaker Library, taking test after test. Unfortunately for all, some of the books in the old library are haunted by nasty ghosts."
