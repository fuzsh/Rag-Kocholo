        "text": "Quetiapine belongs to a group of medicines called antipsychotics.\n\nIt does not cure your condition, but it can help the symptoms.\n\nQuetiapine works by affecting chemicals in the brain such as dopamine and serotonin.\n\nIf you have too much dopamine it can make you see things that are not there (hallucinations) or think things that are not true (delusions). Dopamine is also involved in muscle movements so too much of it can affect your muscles.\n\nSerotonin is believed to be involved in regulating mood.\n\nQuetiapine does not work straight away. It can take several days or even weeks for some symptoms to improve. It may take a few weeks to get to the right dose for you.\n\nWhen you start taking it, give it time to start working properly.\n\nTo begin with you may find that quetiapine makes you feel more alert and less slowed down. Many people do not have any side effects.\n\nOver time, you may find that quetiapine makes you:\n\nfeel calmer and less upset\n\nable to concentrate better and think more clearly\n\nable to get things done and stay focused\n\nmore aware of what may and may not be real\n\nstop hearing voices\n\nremember things more easily\n\nstop having troubling thoughts or beliefs that are not accepted by others\n\nfeel more comfortable with other people and get along better with them\n\nTaking quetiapine will not change your personality and it is not addictive.\n\nThe antipsychotic medicine you're prescribed will depend on your condition and how severe it is, any other conditions you have, and how well the medicine works for you.\n\nDifferent people respond differently to antipsychotic medicine. You might have to try a few medicines before you find the medicine and dose that works for you.\n\nDifferent antipsychotic medicines may have different side effects. When deciding on the best medicine for you, it's important to discuss with your doctor the possible side effects and how they may affect you.\n\nLithium is the main medicine used to treat bipolar disorder. It is a long-term treatment for episodes of mania and depression, and it's usually prescribed for at least 6 months.\n\nLithium is a mood stabiliser, which means it helps to keep your mood stable and control your symptoms of mania and depression.\n\nQuetiapine also helps symptoms of mania and depression.\n\nDiscuss with your doctor which treatment is best for you. This will depend on your symptoms, any other conditions you have and whether you might be sensitive to some of the side effects of the medicines.\n\nQuetiapine can make you feel more hungry than usual, so you may put on weight.\n\nTry to eat a healthy, balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes. Do not snack on foods that contain a lot of calories, such as crisps, cakes, biscuits and sweets. If you feel hungry between meals, eat fruit and vegetables and low-calorie foods.\n\nIf you start to have problems with your weight while taking quetiapine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nMost antipsychotic medicines like quetiapine can sometimes cause sexual problems, but some are more likely to cause these problems than others.\n\nIf you feel you have been having any sexual problems while taking quetiapine, talk to your doctor. They may suggest changing your medicine so that the sexual problems improve or stop.\n\nQuetiapine can increase the amount of sugar in your blood, and this can sometimes lead to diabetes. It's an uncommon side effect of quetiapine and affects less than 1 in 100 people.\n\nYou will usually have a blood test before you start taking quetiapine to see how much sugar you have in your blood. You'll usually have another test a few weeks after starting quetiapine to see if the results have changed. If your results are OK then you'll have another test each year to monitor your blood sugar.\n\nIf you already have diabetes, you will be monitored more closely and will need to check your blood sugar more often.\n\nIf you get any symptoms such as feeling thirsty, needing to pee more often or an increased appetite, talk to your doctor.\n\nQuetiapine can make you feel drowsy or sleepy. Some people cannot concentrate properly while they're taking it.\n\nWhen you first start taking quetiapine, it's a good idea to stop driving and cycling for the first few days until you know how this medicine makes you feel.\n\nIt's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking quetiapine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving."
