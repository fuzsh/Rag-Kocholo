Commission Bids\n\nWhilst prospective buyers are strongly advised to attend the auction personally or via an online bidding platform and are always responsible for any decision to bid for a particular Lot and shall be assumed to have carefully inspected and satisfied themselves as to its condition, we will if so instructed clearly and in writing execute bids on their behalf. Neither the auctioneer nor our employees or agents shall be responsible for any neglect or default in so doing or failing to do so. Where two or more commission bids at the same level are recorded we reserve the right in our absolute discretion to prefer the first bid so made.\n\n11. Warranty of Title And Availability\n\nThe seller warrants to the auctioneer and you that the seller is the true owner of the property consigned or is property authorised by the true owner to consign it for sale and is able to transfer good and marketable title to the property free from any third party claims.\n\n12. Agency\n\nThe auctioneer normally acts as agent only and disclaims any responsibility for default by sellers or buyers.\n\n13. Descriptions\n\n(1) Whilst we seek to describe lots accurately, it may be impractical for us to carry out exhaustive due diligence on each lot. Prospective buyers are given ample opportunities to view, inspect and ask for written condition reports before any sale and they (and any independent experts on their behalf) must satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of any description applied to the lot. Prospective buyers also bid on the understanding that, inevitably, representations or statements by us as to authorship, genuineness, origin, date, age, provenance, condition, size or estimated selling price involve matters of opinion. Neither we the auctioneer nor our employees or agents nor the seller accept liability for the correctness of such opinions and all conditions and warranties, whether relating to description, condition, size or quality of lots, express, implied or statutory, and hereby excluded. All lots remain sold completely 'as is' - irrespective of any description, and no refund shall be issued on any lot where matters arising to condition are raised.\n\n(2) Private treaty sales made under these Conditions are deemed to be sales by auction for purposes of consumer legislation.\n\n(3) Electrical items - any and all electrical items (including, but not limited to, lamps, toys, furniture etc) are sold as decorative 'antique' or 'curio' objects ONLY and must only be used after a qualified electrician / professional has inspected the item for safety. Auctioneum Ltd or its agents are not liable for any injury, damage or loss relating to use of any electrical item. Based upon guidance from Trading Standards, plugs, cables and power leads will be removed prior to sale. No guarantees, warranties or similar are implied nor given on the working ability or electrical safety of any item.\n\n(4) Measurements and Sizes - any measurements or stated sizes should be assumed as 'approximate' where given, and buyers are specifically requested to check sizes match their expectations prior to bidding.\n\n14. Online Bidding\n\nAuctioneum Ltd offer catalogues across multiple online bidding websites. Each of these websites levies a different charge for this service and any prospective bidders are asked to satisfy themselves as to those charges on each specific website.\n\nIn completing the bidder registration on www.the-saleroom.com and providing your card details and unless alternative arrangements are agreed with Auctioneum Ltd you:\n\n1. authorise Auctioneum Ltd if they so wish, to charge the card given in part or full payment, including all fees, for items successfully purchased in the auction via the-saleroom.com or other website, and\n\n2. confirm that you are authorised to provide these card details to Auctioneum Ltd through www.the-saleroom.com (or other website) and agree that Auctioneum Ltd are entitled to ship the goods to the card holder name and card holder address provided in fulfilment of the sale.\n\n15. Anti-Money Laundering\n\nUnder the regulations set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Auctioneum Ltd is required to provide appropriate identity evidence for HMRC when transactions take place over £10000. This is to prove that all buyers seeking to purchase high value items from East Bristol Auctions are who they say they are.\n\nBuyers registering to bid via saleroom.com and Auctioneum's own website will register to bid initially by entering an email address ( subject to validating) a current address of residence along with a valid debit or credit card that details will be matched against each other to verify your identity and to protect us from theft and fraud, complying with AML laws. Successful bidders of items over £10,000 using internet bidding will be sent an email after purchase asking for these, which includes details on what kind of documents we can accept. Please note, in some instances, if we are unable to verify your identity as a bidder on items of a value over £10,000, we will possibly not be able to process your bid and it may be cancelled as a result. Once your identity has been verified, we will inform you via email.\n\nBuyers submitting telephone bidding requests and commission bids prior to the auction will also be subject to the above requirements and document requests prior to bidding thus satisfying both East Bristol Auctions and the current regulations for the Money Laundering Act .\n\nAuctioneum Ltd will be required by law to meet current compliance requirements for example, under UK AML (anti-money laundering) HMRC laws, or individual countries customs laws and regulations and disclose this information"
