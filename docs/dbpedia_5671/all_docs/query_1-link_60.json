Nominated several times for the WSL Big Wave Awards, he does not hesitate to travel the world\n\nto travel the world, accompanied by his aquatic chamber, to hunt and photograph the biggest\n\nthe biggest waves ever surfed by adrenaline professionals.\n\nPrivileged of the caravan of the world professional circuit of surfing, of which he makes the chronicles\n\nfor magazines and specialized websites, Romu is above all a passionate person. Very quickly, he built a vast network of\n\na vast network of international clients and collaborates with surf brands such as Hurley\n\nand for many surf magazines and websites (Surfline, Surf Session, Surf Report\n\nor Beachbrother).\n\nBorn in Brittany, Romu grew up on the coast of Finistère where his maritime training was shaped by the\n\nshaped by the waves and tides of the Atlantic from an early age. Like any young Breton\n\nlike any young Breton who respects himself, his first steps were naturally on the decks of\n\nand catamarans before anchoring them definitively in the pads of the surfboards and in the\n\nsurfboards and in the surf culture since the end of the 80's.\n\nHis ocean wanderings brought him to Tahiti where he joined the team of a famous surf brand as a rider and photographer.\n\nteam of a famous surf brand whose boss is none other than a legend of the surfing world\n\nRobby Naish!\n\nHis reading of the wave and his knowledge of the placement of the riders allow him to immortalize\n\nangles and his photos plunge us, for our greatest happiness, closer to the action and the heart of the\n\naction and in the heart of the biggest and most dangerous tubes on the planet."
