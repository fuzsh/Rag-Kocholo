        "text": "Works and Words was an international art manifestation organised from 20-30 September 1979 by Foundation De Appel in Amsterdam, with artists, art historians and -critics from the Netherlands, former East-Germany, Hungary, Poland and former Yugoslavia (the invited artists from former Czechoslovakia were not able to come). Works and Words comprised lectures, discussions, performances, installations, video, film, historical documentation and an exhibition of photo works (from September 15 through 30). Lectures and meetings and the larger part of the performances took place in a space of 20 x 20 meters, situated in the ex-House of Detention in Amsterdam (De Kapel). The photo works exhibition was held in the Fundatie Kunsthuis, Amsterdam. The films were shown in the Stedelijk Museum and in the Filmmuseum. Gallery A presented Endre Tót’s Gladness Drawings (1973-79). The information and performance space on the main floor of De Appel building were used for various activities which often had a workshop character. The second floor gave a survey of developments and trends in the countries concerned from 1960 onwards. An important objective was to stimulate contact between the artists; daily group dinners were organised at De Appel. Foundation Holland Experimental Film and Fundatie Kunsthuis Amsterdam collaborated in the organisation of the film programme and the exhibition of photo works respectively.\n\nArtists: Franklin Aalders, Jaroslav Anděl, Gábor Attalai, Zoran Belic, Jerzy Bereś, Gábor Bódy, Branko Bubenik, Michel Cardena, Nuša and Srečo Dragan, Ľubomír Ďurček, Miklós Erdély, Ivan Ladislav Galeta, Tomislav Gotovac, Frank Gribling, Buky Grinberg, Vladimir Gudac, Tibor Hajas, Zlatko Hajdler, Janusz Haka, Károly Halasz, Ágnes Háy, Vladimír Havrilla, Nan Hoover, Sanja Iveković, Servie Janssen, Zoltan Jeney, Gyorgy Jovanovic, Cezary Jaworski, Jacek Jozwiak, Szigmond Károlyi, Karoly Kelemen, Michal Kern, Milan Knížák, Tomislav Kobija, Július Koller, Mirko Komosar, Tomasz Konart, Jiří Kovanda, Harrie de Kroon, Zofia Kulik, Romuald Kutera, Paweł Kwiek, Przemyslaw Kwiek, KwieKulik, Natalia LL, Andrzej Lachowicz, Dušan Makavejev, Ivan Martinac, Dalibor Martinis, Raùl Marroquin, Dóra Maurer, Antoni Mikolajczyk, Karel Miler, Jan Mlčoch, Teresa Murak, Vjekoslav Nakić, Mihovil Pansini, Aldo Paquola, Andrzej Paruzel, Sef Peeters, Vladimir Petek, Sandor Pinczehelyi, Reindeer Werk (Dirk Larsen & Tom Puckey), Jaroslav Richtr, Józef Robakowski, Vinco Rozman, Tomasz Sikorski, Petr Štembera, Mladen Stilinović, Peter Timar, Teresa Tyszkiewicz and Zdzislaw Sosnowski, Goran Svob, Janusz Szczerek, István Sziranyi, Raša Todosijević, Endre Tot, Janos Toth, Sava Trifkovic, Ulay, Jiri Valoch, Ante Verzotti, Janos Veto, Zbigniew Warpechowski, Ryszard Waśko, Albert van der Weide, Dobroslav Zborník.\n\nOn Works and Words\n\nZsuzsa László, \"Works and Words.
