        "text": "A piano is a welcome visitor at the zoo. You don't have to be a lion of the keyboard to play this little collection. Antelope, reindeer, and elephants cluster around the young pianist.\n\nThe kangaroo takes bold leaps, the bear ambles with measured gait at a comfortable maestoso , the crocodile slithers in a smooth legato, and the beaver baffles the eye with dexterous nibbles. The player rides horseback on a pony with tiny staccato leaps, and grasshoppers set accents of their very own.\n\nEach of these charming pieces poses a special technical task that young players can master playfully, almost effortlessly. Dry études become a thing of the past. Even the colourful illustrations by Marcin Bruchnalski reflect the character of the music."
