        "text": "Robin Lyons is very much in demand as a writer and story editor of animation projects. He works with his writing partner, Andrew Offiler. They are currently writing a feature film script with Mel Sano for Moody Street Kids in Melbourne and working on the development of an animated tv series for a studio in Ravenna.\n\nWriting Credits\n\nRobin’s writing career started as a student at Oxford where he contributed sketches for several revues in which he performed, including two Oxford Revues, An Exhibition of Ourselves and Her Majesty’s Pleasure.\n\nHe also wrote a dramatic adaptation of André Maurois’ book Fattypuffs and Thinifers which was performed in the open air.\n\nHis first professional work was a one act play commissioned by the British Dance Drama Theatre called He Looks Like An Angel. He contributed song lyrics to several productions by the Red Light Theatre, writing with composer Charlie Barber. He wrote and directed a full length dramatic work based on the life and work of French author and jazz artist Boris Vian, again with music by Barber.\n\nAt this time Robin started collaborating with composer Chris Stuart with whom he had performed at Oxford writing comedy songs which they performed with their own musical revue. Robin wrote all the lyrics, links and sketches for their live shows as well as for broadcasts on radio and television. These included several revues at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, starting with The Penultimate Show On Earth at the Richard De Marco gallery.\n\nThe revue became known as Baby Grand. Apart from live performances it made appearances on BBC radio shows such as Medium Dry Sherrin and Not Now, I’m Listening as well as the tv shows Pebble Mill at One and Friday Night, Saturday Morning. These featured songs written by Robin with Chris Stuart.\n\nOther shows featuring the group and written by Robin include two specials for HTV, shown on the ITV network: For Patrons Only and Back in the Pavilion. They wrote other entertainment programmes for HTV at the time that did not feature Baby Grand, including the special Saints Alive.\n\nFor BBC radio, Robin wrote and performed in a series of 6 x 15 minute programmes for Radio 2 The Baby Grand Song Factory, a 45 minute one-off comedy The Underwater Towering Inferno, as well as a half hour of sketches and songs satirising the devolution referendum of 1979 for BBC Radio Wales. Chris Stuart wrote the music for these shows.\n\nFor television Robin wrote and performed in two series of 6 x 30 minute programmes for BBC 2, Verse, Worse and Baby Grand and Say It With Baby Grand. Again all the music was written by Chris Stuart.\n\nAt the same time Robin was working as a freelance critic, covering dance and jazz for the Guardian but also contributing to Jazz Journal, TES and the Western Mail. He also write several scripts for BBC Schools Radio, including a three part musical with music by Chris Stuart.\n\nHe also ghost wrote the children’s books SuperTed for its creator Mike Young and this led to the writing that Robin Lyons is best known for today – scripts for animation.
