        "text": "Injecting future ! is the name we are giving to our ambition 2030 PANPHARMA. A major focus for achieving this ambition is the industrial transformation that we began in 2021. After the visit of the construction site of our new vial line in Trittau (Germany) we took the opportunity of the budget review in Luitré (France) to visit the facility and the new building with Marie Helene Dick- Madelpuech and a several members of the Group's management team. Again a real satisfaction to see this investment of more than 28 million euro becoming reality, providing us with ultra-modern equipment to improve our performance and increase our capacity so that we can continue to \"Act together, every day, to guarantee patients reliable access to essential medicines\". We started the visit by the #cephalosporin line that just restarted after the installation of several new equipements and we then visited the new building where the new #penicillin line will be implemented. The full line was delivered just before Christmas, not by Father Christmas and his reindeer but 7 trucks fully loaded ! Thank you to the full project team lead by Aurore Renin for their dedication and determination to deliver the key steps now in 2024 that will be again a busy year. Thanks also to all the teams working on this critical multidisciplinary project. Join us if you want to make a difference ! #makingadifference #frenchfab #togetherwecan #bpifrance #investirlavenir #francerelance"
