        "text": "Simanas Daukantas\n\nLithuanian historian\n\nQuick Facts\n\nBorn:\n\nOct. 28, 1793, Kalviai, Lithuania\n\nDied:\n\nDec. 6 [Nov. 24, old style], 1864, Papilė, Lithuania, Russian Empire (aged 71)\n\nSubjects Of Study:\n\nLithuania\n\nSimanas Daukantas (born Oct. 28, 1793, Kalviai, Lithuania—died Dec. 6 [Nov. 24, old style], 1864, Papilė, Lithuania, Russian Empire) was a historian who was the first to write a history of Lithuania in Lithuanian and a pioneer of the Lithuanian national renaissance.\n\nDaukantas studied languages and literature at the University of Vilnius (at Vilnius, former capital of Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire; 1816–18) and then philosophy, law, and history. He received his master of law degree in 1825. After 10 years as a translator in the office of the governor general in Riga, Latvia, where he had access to the archives, he went to St. Petersburg in 1835 to take a post in the senate office and archives, where he was able to study important Lithuanian state documents. He retired because of ill health in 1850.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nHistory Buff Quiz\n\nDaukantas’ two main historical works are Būdas senovės lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių (1845; “The Character of the Lithuanians, Highlanders, and Samogitians”) and Istorija žemaitiška (written before 1838 and first published in serial form in a U.S. Lithuanian newspaper, 1891–96; “History of Samogitia”). Because he was concerned with uplifting and instilling national pride in the Lithuanian people, he idealized his nation’s past. The importance of his works lies in their influence on the Lithuanian national movement, as well as in the quality of his writing.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
