Twelve years ago a small patch of a strange gigantic seaweed appeared off the coast of Monaco.

Despite warnings from a marine biologist about its high toxicity, the seaweed was ignored by local authorities, and has now mutated into a phenomenon known as the "killer algae" which is choking all indigenous life. This documentary examines how a supposedly harmless plant has become a potential threat to global marine life.
