Those who are studying African American religion or history in the Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction periods will benefit greatly from reading and interacting with this work.”--Reading Religion\n\n“[Harper's] extensive research in multiple archives yields a valuable account of black Protestants tenaciously asserting that the god of Christian faith was still active in history despite the overwhelming expansion of institutional racism. Recommended.”--Choice\n\n“Solidly researched and accessibly written. . . . An important addition to the literature on African American religiosity during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.”--Journal of Church and State\n\n“Provides a fresh perspective on African American politics and religion.”--North Carolina Historical Review\n\n“Illustrates how black biblical and theological interpretations challenged, and often inverted, those of white Southerners.”--Reviews in American History"
