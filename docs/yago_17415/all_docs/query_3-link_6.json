        "text": "If we are to think like the first-century hearers, we must recognize that the importance of the number fourteen is that it is a multiple of (that ever-so-important number) seven. Matthew is implying that the entire flow of God's history of creating a people for himself shows that Jesus the Christ is our Sabbath rest.\n\nForty-two, not Fourteen\n\nThree sets of fourteen is six sets of seven. The operative number here is not really fourteen but forty-two. And no, forty-two is not the answer to life, the universe, and everything; actually it is the precursor to the one who is the meaning of everything. Jesus Christ is the seventh week of history; he is the completion and the culmination; he inaugurates the last days.\n\nIn the Lord Jesus, God's redemptive work comes to a rest. This does not mean that God becomes inert, but that that the finality and totality are invested in him, and history never moves beyond him, as he lives on in his indestructible life, ruling from on high.\n\nOld Testament Prophecies\n\nI am not aware of prophecies that reference the number fourteen. However, when this is seen as a matter of the seventh seven, all the significance of seven and its square come into play. There are a handful of references to forty-two in the Old Testament, but none of them shed a lot of light on this situation. The most relevant prophecy may be Daniel's reference to the week of weeks:\n\nNow listen and understand! Seven sets of seven plus sixty-two sets of seven will pass from the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until a ruler—the Anointed One—comes. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and strong defenses, despite the perilous times. —Daniel 9:25 (NLT)\n\nAdmittedly, Daniel is giving a different perspective on the narrative than Matthew, but the same theological meaning of the seventh seven: the Messiah will be the fulfillment of all things.\n\nNew Testament Prophecies\n\nThe meaning of forty-two is further clarified by the last book of prophecy as the time of the dominion of the nations over God's people:\n\nBut do not measure the outer courtyard, for it has been turned over to the nations. They will trample the holy city for 42 months. —Revelation 11:2 (NLT)\n\nAnd:\n\nThen the beast was allowed to speak great blasphemies against God. And he was given authority to do whatever he wanted for forty-two months. —Revelation 13:5 (NLT)\n\nThe Messiah is the one who brings this time to an end, defeating the enemies of God and rescuing his people. Upon his arrival, the time of trampling is over.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Jon Ericson's answer, he links to an article by Bob Deffinbaugh, who points out the strong connections between Matthew 1 and Genesis 1. Indeed, what we see here is that just as God created progressively over six days, so God revealed himself progressively for six weeks, until on the seventh God himself appeared on earth and became our rest.\n\nNumerology\n\nA recent question linked to a reference of meaning of various numbers in the Bible and this passage seem to be the primary source of meaning for the number 14. None of the other references seem particularly compelling and seem to be included for data-mining purposes. I would say that the number 14 has no particular meaning in the Bible outside of this passage.\n\nProphesy\n\nWhile there are many Old Testament prophesies that are said to apply to Jesus, I don't know of any that involve 14 generations. It is clear that the Messiah must come from the line of David, but nothing in the Jewish texts require him to be any particular generation away from David.\n\nInterpretation\n\nSo why did Matthew make a point of specifying the number of generations? Simply put, genealogy and numerology were important to 1st century Jews as they are to most people throughout history. It's vital that the Messiah descend from Abraham and David. So Matthew recorded the lineage from Abraham to David and from David to Jesus. When he did so, he must have noticed that there were roughly the same number of men from the start of the Jewish people to its height, as from the start of the Jewish kingdom to its end, as from the captivity to Jesus. There weren't 14 generations exactly, however. So Matthew edited the list by jumping from grand- or great-grandfathers to their later decedent (\"son of\" can mean any male decedent).\n\nThe image that Matthew seems to invoke that of a deep plan in human history managed by God and culminating in the person of Jesus. It is the story of the rise and fall of a people and the redemption of that story when a new \"King of the Jews\" was born. We are meant to be reminded of the very familiar names that take up the bulk of Jesus' genealogy and remember their triumphs and failures.\n\nFor a fairly exhaustive interpretation of this passage, I highly recommend Bob Deffinbaugh's article on bible.org.\n\nThe numerical values of David's name adds up to 14, as has already been stated. Besides there were exactly 14 generations between Abraham and David. But Matthew had to skip 3 generations to make 14 from David to the captivity in Babylon, and had to skip many more to make only 14 from Babylon to Jesus. The numerical value of David's name itself may explain why the number 14 is chosen, but does not explain why any number had to be chosen at all: why not list every person in the genealogy?\n\nI think the answer lies in the fact that Matthew is more interested in theology and parallelism than in historicity and chronology. Often Matthew will mention only briefly what Mark describes in great detail, and will move the accounts of events around to make them fit his structure and theological emphasis (note, however, that he never claims that these events are in chronological order). In the genealogy, I believe he is drawing parallels between each set of 14 names in order to emphasize two points: David (from whom the Messiah would come), and Babylon (which took away from Israel the kingdom which Christ was to restore). In addition to emphasizing these two points in the chronology, the 14x3 generations may be meant as a mnemonic aid for anyone wanting to memorize them (as was more common in their time than in ours).\n\nAs explained by @Frank Luke, the original Jewish audience for Matthew would immediately have connected the number 14 to David. This was anticipated in verse 1 where Jesus is introduced as the \"Son of David\". It is crucial for Matthew to underscore that Jesus was the Messiah=Son of David. Of course, \"son\" is here used in an extended, Hebrew sense. When one person in the genealogy is said to be the father of another person, this can mean either father, grandfather or ancestor. Likewise a \"son\" can be a son, grandson or descendant. The word \"son\" can also mean \"someone like\" as in \"sons of thunder\". So, it is not a problem for Matthew to leave out certain names in the genealogy in order to arrive at the significant number 3x14.\n\nIt is irrelevant that this adds up to 42, and that 14=7x2, but it is relevant that we have 3 sets of 14. The symbolic meaning of 3 is what comes from God or relates to God's intervention on earth. The number 4 stands for people or humanity. By combining God with people we get the perfect and complete number 3+4=7. By multiplying God and people, 3x4=12, we get the people of God. The OT people of God is represented by the 12 sons of Jacob, and the NT people of God is represented by the 12 apostles. These two peoples are combined in Revelation and represented by 24 elders.\n\nSo, Matthew is telling his audience that Jesus was not a regular earthly king like David. He did not come to restore the physical kingdom of David. It was a different kingdom he was to be the ruler in, the Kingdom of Heaven = the Kingdom of God. Jesus was sent by God into this world as the Son of God, the spiritual King David.\n\nMany people have looked at the symbolic meaning of numbers in the Bible. Some deny any symbolic meaning of any number, while others see dubious symbolism in every number. My own little contribution can be found here: https://www.academia.edu/1040939/Number_symbolism_in_the_Bible\n\nDrawing on \"The Adoption of Jesus\" by Ra McLaughlin, I'd suggest that the counting here is not intended as a hidden numerological code or fulfillment of any prophecy but is simply a literary device used to place Jesus in squarely as part of Israel's history. Says McLaughlin:\n\nThe generations are not counted in a precisely similar fashion — Jeconiah is counted twice. This is not inappropriate given that [the genealogy] is primarily a literary device intended to highlight the four markers [viz., Abraham, David, the exile, and Christ]. Moreover, Jeconiah rightly belongs in both groups: in the first group, he is in a line of kings; in the second group, having been deposed, he is merely counted as a man.\n\nIn particular, Matthew was self-consciously writing, Michael Kruger argues, to complete the story of Israel recorded in the Old Testament and that he saw Jesus as the continuation and consummation of that story:\n\n[Matthew] turns immediately to a genealogy, placing the Jesus story into the story of Israel, with a special emphasis on David. The genealogy, of course, is a well-known Old Testament genre that is frequently used to demonstrate the historical unfolding of God’s redemptive activities among his people. In this regard, Matthew’s closest parallel is the book of Chronicles which also begins with a genealogy that has an emphasis on the Davidic line.\n\nIf by the first century Chronicles was regarded as the final book in the Hebrew canon, as some scholars have argued, then Matthew’s gospel would certainly be a fitting sequel. An Old Testament canon ending with Chronicles would have placed Israel in an eschatological posture, looking ahead to the time when the messiah, the son of David, will come to Jerusalem and bring full deliverance to his people.\n\nIf so, then Matthew’s opening chapter would be a clear indication that he is intending to finish this story. He is picking up where the Old Testament ended, with a focus on David and the deliverance of Israel.\n\nMany of the answers given are quite good and useful. Niobius and Steve Can Help and John are very good answers indeed. I wouldn't bother to add but that for the oft repeated observation by the many authors here, \"just because XYZ is equal to 14, doesn't mean Matthew's reason for doing this is because of it.\" True.\n\nAfter years looking at Matthew, I believe there is a more pressing reason for Matthew using 14 as a key number in his genealogy. In short, Matthew uses 14 as a literary tool to write his Gospel and group his stories into a meaningful whole. And Matthew \"tells us\" this by doing the same to the introduction ( which is the geneology).\n\nI have taught on this many times but not published as of yet. But to keep this abbreviated, allow this explanation.\n\nMatthew wrote his Gospel and separated out the genealogical history of Jesus into 3 groups of 14 (self evident, IMHO). But the next question is why...and all the above is in play. However, Matthew has a more over-arching reason for separating the 42 (seeming) generations into 3 x 14 (and NOT 6X7). Matthew wants his readers to follow him in groups of 14 throughout His Gospel. David Palmer has one of the better renditions of this in His book on Matthew. And even if you don't initially see the fourteen used as groupings (Matthew is not going to number like John), those groupings enables Matthew to communicate much that is clouded without his groupings into 14. Most notably is dead center of His Gospel (chapter 13) where 14 mini-stories are set in inverted-parallel so to communicate his Gospels focus on discipleship. And that number 14 is used throughout as Matthew's breakdown of the life of Jesus.\n\nIn short, the third reason is literary...and used quite deftly by Matthew. And as others have said quite well...there are not 3 groups of 14 persons in Matthew's genealogy. Shoot, the name Exile isn't even a name (needed to get 14). :) But Matthew seperates his genealogy into 14's because he is going to do that same thing throughout his book so to build a literary frame that helps the reader focus on the crucial elements more clearly. JJ\n\nThe genealogy of Yeshua is 14+14+14 which leads us to the Christ generation or those that become ONE (Echad) with Christ. Added together it sums to 42. There were 42 stops in the wilderness before entering the Promised Land. That means that 42 is a number that signifies the end of one place and transitioning into another. As stated in Rev 11:2 and 13:5, it signified the end of evil domination. If you know Hebrew gemetria, the proper name of Jesus is Yehoshua. You can find that spelled various ways, but we know that when Yeshua died and received his glorified body he became one with the Father, YHVH. Since the Hebrew letter Shin represents the Shekinah or Glory of God, you would spell the name by putting the Shin within the other letters or YHSVH (Yud, Hey, Shin, Vav, Hey). If you know how to do the milui (full letter value) of this name it works out to 1260. 1260 in days is the same as 3.5 years or in months is 42. So, 42 also represents the name of Jesus in the glory which is YHSVH or Yehoshua. Yes, I don't think it was a coincidence that it is a popular saying but yet no one knows exactly why, but even the youth are wearing sweatshirts saying; 42- the answer to all life.\n\nThe number 14 by itself is the gemetria of the word \"beloved\" in Hebrew, is 7x2 which since 7 is a spiritual completion number means double completion or the reward of double for the first born. Being double completion, it can also mean the passing through of the 2 veils in the tabernacle, and the two resurrections."
