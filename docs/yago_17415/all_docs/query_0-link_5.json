What I love about polish film from this period is their way of staging that's simultaneously stylized and simple, and it isn't show-offy in that mock-Kubrickian way, nor do they share the compulsive symmetry of Wes Anderson. There's a scene where Mathis is on one end of a stream and one of the farm girls on the other. Mathis remarks that touching the water feels like touching an electrical wire",

There's a scene where Mathis is on one end of a stream and one of the farm girls on the other. Mathis remarks that touching the water feels like touching an electrical wire (as he's so in touch with the natural world that every sensation feels stronger for him than others), but he's interrupted by the farm girl's boyfriend splashing water at them from the middle of the stream. She splashes water back at him and they run off. Mathis is left behind on the other side, and when he tries to cross over he falls into the stream.\n\nIt's such an elegant visual metaphor, and the film is filled with moments like that. It's a crime this isn't more well known, as this is easily on par with other giants of european cinema of it's time."
