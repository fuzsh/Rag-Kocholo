        "text": "Michał Sutowski’s interview with prof. Jerzy Osiatyński and Małgorzata Mazurek is the second meeting of the cycle of discussions concerning the exhibitions \"After Year Zero\" and \"Lest The Two Seas Meet\".\n\nPoland once had much to offer the so-called Third World. Researchers from the circles later called the Polish School of Development – Ignacy Sachs, Michał Kalecki, or Witold Kula – not only belonged to the world elite of the social, historical, and economic sciences, but were also able to transform the local 20th century experience of Poland – a backward agricultural country that was strenuously industrialised and occupied by colonialists – into an inspiration for grand modernisation plans of the African and Asian countries that were gaining independence. Conscious of the limitations of capitalism and absurdities of the soviet planned economy, they created ambitious growth strategies for Ghana, India, or Mongolia.\n\nProfessor Jerzy Osiatyński, former Polish finance minister, member of the Monetary Policy Council, follower of Michał Kalecki, will speak about how Warsaw of the 1960s became an intellectual Mecca for politicians and economists from developing countries.\n\nJerzy Osiatyński (born in 1941) – economic sciences professor, graduate of SGPiS (Warsaw School of Economics at present), former Polish finance minister (in the cabinet of Hanna Suchocka), currently member of the Monetary Policy Council, expert in economic theory, public finance, 20th century history of the economic thought and transformation of economy from centrally planned to market-regulated, author of the handbook \"Public Finance\", scholarly editor of the publications of Michał Kalecki.\n\nMichał Sutowski (born in 1985) – political scientist, graduate of the Interdisciplinary Individual Humanist and Social Studies College of the University of Warsaw, member of the \"Krytyka Polityczna\" team and the Advanced Studies Institute, columnist of \"Dziennik Opinii\", translator of the books of Ulrich Beck, Robert Skidelski, Marci Shore, and Ivan Krastev, among others, author of the books \"Live and let live\" (interview with Agata Bielik-Robson), \"Friendly relations\" (interview with Ludwika Wujec) and \"I am from here\" (interview with Agnieszka Graff).\n\nMałgorzata Mazurek is a professor of Polish studies at the History Faculty of Columbia University in New York. She investigates modern and contemporary history of Poland and Central and Eastern Europe and the history of the social sciences. Previously she worked at the Centre for Contemporary History in Potsdam. She was also a lecturer at Humboldt University in Berlin and University of Warsaw. She is the author of books \"Socialist workplace. Labourers in the Polish People’s Republic and East Germany at the turn of the 1960s\" (2005), \"The queuing society. On the experience of a shortage 1945-1989\" (2010), and also numerous articles and chapters of books published in Polish, English, German, and French. Currently she is working on a book about the history of research on the population, emigration, and capitalism on the Polish territory, which in the 1940s became the basis of the growth theory for the so-called Third World countries and contributed to the creation of an international discipline of social sciences – development economics."
