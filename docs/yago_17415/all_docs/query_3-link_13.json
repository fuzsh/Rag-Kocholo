        "text": "What are your favorite memories of last year? Or the year before? Most of us tend to keep our memories inside our head or inside our heart, and over time they tend to fade away until something stirs the memory back to the surface.\n\nThe Book of Days is my latest online class where I show you how to make a journal with blank pages that you can use as a place to hold your favorite memories as you progress through the year. At the end of the year you’ll have a wonderful book of memories that will be a treasured keepsake for years to come.\n\nBut blank pages don’t have to be boring, so in this video workshop I’m also sharing some of my favorite techniques for working with stencils, paint and texture pastes to create pages that are full of beautiful visual texture and color.\n\nI’ve made my Book of Days as a nature-inspired memory journal where I can keep a remembrance of my nature photos and other nature-inspired bits and pieces, so your book can be used for special occasions, or as a general purpose memory journal.\n\nThis workshop also includes a lesson on natural dyeing with fruit and vegetables to create beautiful fabric to use in your journal."
