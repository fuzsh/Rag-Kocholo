E-mail: officialmatthewmdaybooks@gmail.com IMPORTANT UPDATE: 29 OCTOBER 2021: Until further notice, I will not be doing any interviews or publicize these books through the media. Please keep up with this page and my blog for additional book-related news. For additional updates, check out matthewmdaybooks.blogspot.com. Hello, and thanks for visiting my Author Central page! I am a Lubbock, Texas-based author who published my first book in June 2019. I hope that you will enjoy the books that I put out as much as I enjoyed researching them and writing them. I specialize in oil and agricultural history, especially in West Texas during the first half of the 20th century. By the time I turned 30 in April 2019, I had published four research articles--one in the Journal of the West, one in the Great Plains Quarterly, and two in Britain's History: The Journal of the Historical Association. The first time I published an article in History ended a four-year drought between articles being published. The second time I did just that, I had finally succeeded after failing to publish the article on around 20 different occasions. So, I understand the challenges that publishing entails. It's not easy. You have to really, really love the process. You will lose more than you win. But the wins are so satisfying. And, sometimes, the stories behind the articles are just as captivating--at least, I think they are (but I'm biased). The most recent article, partially titled \"Not Just Another Duster,\" was published in History's December 2018 issue. I submitted, revised, and then resubmitted the article at a time when I was preparing to relocate home to Lubbock after 25 years of being a visitor. (I was born in Lubbock; I moved away as a small child and wanted to come back. In between, I lived in and around Oklahoma City and Amarillo and graduated from college in 2012.) Not two weeks after moving back to Lubbock, I get the article accepted. That was in summer 2018. Why did I decide to write a book? Perhaps the most relevant reason is that, after four articles in a span dating back to 2013, I decided it was time to make a little money and to bring the same historical research and writing that had made me successful in journals published in 2 different countries. I wanted to bring scholarship to people who might not have ready access to scholarly journals. In what time I spend not writing or working (I work in the private sector unrelated to my writings), I enjoy experimenting with dishes in the kitchen (Pepperoni cheese fries? Why not?), enjoying the food and weather Lubbock has to offer (chili rellenos ), and cruising around this city and enjoying life. Anyway, thanks for your time, and enjoy the books. PUBLICITY FOR MY BOOKS: 6/28/2019: Robert Pratt, host of Pratt on Texas (KFYO-AM/FM, Lubbock, Texas), interviewed me for the \"Texana\" segment of his show. The interview focused on my book, Frank Isett: and the Myth of the Wealthy Oilman. A huge THANK YOU to Robert Pratt and KFYO for letting me come on the program (via phone interview) to talk about my research. MORE PUBLICITY: Chris Russell, a Washington, D. C.-area sports radio host, gave me a shoutout on his Locked on Redskins podcast, aired September 26, 2019. Thanks once again to Chris for taking a moment out of what has been a frustrating season for us Redskins fans to help promote the book for readers in the DMV. The shoutout begins at about the 22-minute mark. https://podbay.fm/podcast/1144183096/e/1569544884 PHOTOS: The photos on this page were taken on November 12, 2019. Special thanks to Weston Marshall (Southwest Collection--Texas Tech U.) for taking the photographs and also to the archive's staff (especially Randy Vance and Tai Kreidler) for giving their approval to the photos being taken.
