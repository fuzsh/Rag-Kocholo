Communism cut off any possible attempts at outreach and most Poles only knew a religion of salvation based on a life of good works and keeping church disciplines. This of course led most into a state of eternal uncertainty and conviction that God was continually being offended by us. His sacrifice on the Cross was not understood as a full payment for our guilt and shame; We would also have to pay and receive mercy from the Church itself to free us from the penalties we would have to pay ourselves in purgatory and possibly an eternal sentence to Hell. To this very day, people in Poland pay money to aid the dead and release them into eternal life.\n\nIn the mid 1970’s a large group of missionaries was sent from Campus Crusade for Christ which bypassed the tiny mixed in doctrine evangelical community. This group of Campus Crusaders which probably numbered several hundred coming in for a time over the past 40 years was able to directly reach the unevangelized 99.99% religious lost to what some have estimated to be five million Poles out of 38 million. Some have said hundreds of thousands became born again Christians and because 99% of the Polish communities had not even one healthy Christ centered church, most Poles simply stayed in the Catholic Church. However, thousands of Catholics saved at this outreach did increase the evangelical churches four to tenfold, depending on the community. On my trips to Poland, I have spoken to both groups. This great evangelization of the 1970’s and 1980’s slowed down due to many political and spiritual movement changes began to take place in Poland. Many other ministries also began to develop and have some fruit in the 1980’s and 1990’s. This brings us to today. There are now ten times more evangelical churches and fellowships. They are the hope and strategy to reach the entire nation of Poland with the Gospel. Most Poles living today were born after the seventies. Our mission is to work side by side with all of them to reach all of Poland with the \"Good News\".\n\nThe Lord Provides, Protects, Empowers, Transforms, Heals, Teaches and Guides\n\nIn 1990, Joe and Anna met in Chicago and married. They now have three children - (Mary- 27 (Married to Daniel Havlock - 27 in 2020), Lukas - 25 and Konrad - 21). A ministry of Christian radio, camps, concerts, festivals and training conferences were held throughout the city of Chicago.\n\nIn 2004, Joe and Anna started MissionPoland full time. This ministry began with holding Bible conferences and evangelistic meetings in churches and family camps in Poland. We also continued ministry to Poles in America and the U.K.. Fruit from these earlier years still needs to be gathered, discipled and organized. We still have unique doors open for us and have been preparing for an even greater harvest in Poland. God has protected and provided for us and we trust Him to continue, as we keep His word, love the Lord, honor His name and have His purpose.\n\n\"Znam twoje czyny. Oto postawiłem jako dar przed tobą drzwi otwarte, których nikt nie może zamknąć, bo moc masz znikomą, ale zachowałeś moje słowo i nie zaparłeś się mego imienia\" Ap. 3:8"
