Night Shyamalan’s Trap is campy and surface-level, but there’s still a twist to untangle.\n\nReview: Sugarcane\n\nSugarcane is a balanced and striking documentary about individuals affected by the traumas of an Indigenous residential school.\n\nReview: Starve Acre\n\nThe folk horror-drama Starve Acre finds suspense in the silence."
