        "text": "Template:Culture of Poland sidebar\n\nPolish literature is the literary tradition of Poland. Most Polish literature has been written in the Polish language, though other languages, used in Poland over the centuries, have also contributed to Polish literary traditions, including Yiddish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, German and Esperanto. Until the early 18th century, a major language of Polish literature was Latin, widely popular across all of Western and Central Europe at the time.[1]\n\nFor centuries – wrote Czesław Miłosz – Polish literature focused more on drama and poetic self-expression than on fiction (dominant in the English speaking world). The reasons were manifold, but mostly, rested on historical circumstances of the nation. Polish writers typically have had a more profound range of choices to motivate them to write including historical cataclysms of extraordinary violence that swept Poland, as the crossroads of Europe; but also, Polish own collective incongruities demanding adequate reaction from the writing communities of any given period.[2][3]\n\nMiddle Ages[]\n\nAlmost nothing remains of Polish literature prior to the country's Christianization in 966. Poland's pagan inhabitants certainly possessed an oral literature extending to Slavic songs, legends and beliefs, but early Christian writers did not deem it worthy of mention in the obligatory Latin, and so it has perished.[2]\n\nIt is customary to include within the Polish literary tradition, works that have dealt with Poland, even if not written by ethnic Poles. This is the case with Gallus Anonymus, the first historian to have described Poland in his work entitled Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum (Deeds of the Princes of the Poles), composed in sophisticated Latin. Gallus was a foreign monk who accompanied King Bolesław III Wrymouth in his return from Hungary to Poland. The important tradition of Polish historiography was continued by Wincenty Kadłubek, a thirteenth century Bishop of Kraków, as well as Jan Długosz, a Polish priest and secretary to Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki.[2]\n\nThe first recorded sentence in the Polish language reads: \"Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai\" (\"Let me grind, and you take a rest\") — a paraphrase of the Latin \"Sine, ut ego etiam molam.\" The work, in which this phrase appeared, reflects the culture of early Poland. The sentence was written within the Latin language chronicle Liber fundationis from between 1269 and 1273, a history of the Cistercian monastery in Henryków, Silesia. It was recorded by an abbot known simply as Piotr (Peter) referring to an event almost a hundred years earlier. The sentence was supposedly uttered by a Bohemian settler, Bogwal (\"Bogwalus Boemus\"), a subject of Bolesław the Tall, expressing compassion for his own wife who \"very often stood grinding by the quern-stone.\"[1] Most notable early medieval Polish works in Latin and the Old Polish language include the oldest extant manuscript of fine prose in the Polish language entitled the Holy Cross Sermons, as well as the earliest Polish-language Bible of Queen Zofia and the Chronicle of Janko of Czarnków from the 14th century, not to mention the Puławy Psalter.[2]\n\nMost early texts in Polish vernacular were influenced heavily by the Latin sacred literature. They include Bogurodzica (Mother of God), a hymn in praise of the Virgin Mary written down in the 15th century though popular at least a century earlier. Bogurodzica served as a national anthem. It was one of the first texts reproduced in Polish on a printing press; and so was the Master Polikarp's Conversation with Death (Rozmowa mistrza Polikarpa ze śmiercią).[2]\n\nIn the early 1470s, one of the first printing houses in Poland was set up by Kasper Straube in Kraków (see: spread of the printing press). In 1475 Kasper Elyan of Glogau (Głogów) set up a printing shop in Breslau (Wrocław), Silesia. Twenty years later, the first Cyrillic printing house was founded at Kraków by Schweipolt Fiol for Eastern Orthodox Church hierarchs. The most notable texts produced in that period include Saint Florian's Breviary printed partially in Polish in the late 14th century; Statua synodalia Wratislaviensia (1475): a printed collection of Polish and Latin prayers, as well as Jan Długosz's Chronicle from the 15th century and his Catalogus archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium.[2]\n\nRenaissance[]\n\nWith the advent of the Renaissance, the Polish language was finally accepted on an equal footing with Latin. Polish culture and art flourished under Jagiellonian rule, and many foreign poets and writers settled in Poland, bringing with them new literary trends. Such writers included Kallimach (Filippo Buonaccorsi) and Conrad Celtis. Many Polish writers studied abroad, and at the Kraków Academy, which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents. In 1488 the world's first writers' club, called Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana‎, was founded in Kraków. Notable members included Conrad Celtes, Albert Brudzewski, Filip Callimachus, and Laurentius Corvinus.[2]\n\nA Polish writer who used Latin as his principal vehicle of expression was Klemens Janicki (Ianicius), who became one of the most notable Latin poets of his time and was laureled by the Pope. Other writers such as Mikołaj Rej,[4] and Jan Kochanowski, laid the foundations for the Polish literary language and modern Polish grammar. The first book written entirely in the Polish language appeared in this period. It was a prayer-book by Biernat of Lublin (ca. 1465 – after 1529), called Raj duszny (Hortulus Animae, Eden of the Soul), printed in Kraków in 1513 at one of Poland's first printing establishments operated by Florian Ungler originally from Bavaria. Most notable Polish writers and poets active in the 16th century include:\n\nMikołaj Hussowski (Hussowczyk, 1480?–1533?)\n\nAndrzej Krzycki (1482–1537)\n\nJohannes Dantiscus (1485–1548)\n\nJan Łaski (1499–1560), Communae Poloniae Regni privilegium\n\nAndrzej Frycz Modrzewski (1503–1572), De Republica emendanda\n\nMikołaj Rej (1505–1569), Krótka rozprawa...\n\nKlemens Janicki (Ianicius, 1516–1542)\n\nŁukasz Górnicki (1524–1603)\n\nJan Kochanowski (1530–1584), Laments (Treny)\n\nPiotr Skarga (1536–1612)\n\nBartosz Paprocki (1543?–1614), historiographer, genealogist\n\nSzymon Szymonowic (1558–1629)\n\nDaniel Naborowski (1573–1640)\n\nMaciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski (1595–1640)\n\nBaroque[]\n\nThe literature in the period of Polish Baroque,[5] between 1620 and 1764, was significantly influenced by the great popularization of Jesuit high school, which offered education based on Latin classics as part of preparation for a political carrier. The studies of poetry required the practical knowledge of writing both Latin and Polish poems, which radically increased the number of poets and versifiers countrywide. On the soil of humanistic education some exceptional writers grew as well. Piotr Kochanowski (1566–1620) gave his translation of Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, a poet laureate, become known among European nations as Horatius christianus (Christian Horace) for his Latin writings. Jan Andrzej Morsztyn (1621–1693), an epicurean courtier and diplomat, extolled in his sophisticated poems the valors of earthly delights. Wacław Potocki (1621–1696), the most productive writer of the Polish Baroque unified the typical opinions of Polish szlachta with some deeper reflections and existential experiences. Notable Polish writers and poets active in this period include:\n\nMikołaj Sęp Szarzyński (1550–1581), Rymy\n\nKasper Miaskowski (1550?–1622)\n\nDaniel Naborowski (1573–1640)\n\nHieronim Morsztyn (1581–1623)\n\nSzymon Starowolski (1588–1656)\n\nMaciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski (1595–1640)\n\nJózef Bartłomiej Zimorowic (1597–1677)\n\nSamuel Twardowski (1600?–1661)\n\nSzymon Zimorowic (1608?–1629), Roksolanki\n\nKrzysztof Opaliński (1611–1655)\n\nŁukasz Opaliński (1612–1666)\n\nJan Andrzej Morsztyn (1621–1693), leading Baroque poet\n\nWacław Potocki (1621–1696), Wojna Chocimska\n\nZbigniew Morsztyn (Morstyn, 1628?-1689)\n\nStanisław Grochowski (1633–1645)\n\nJan Chryzostom Pasek (1636–1701), Pamietniki (memoirs)\n\nKasper Twardowski, \"Lekcyje Kupidynowe\" (church-banned erotica)\n\nSebastian Grabowiecki (1543–1607)\n\nPiotr Kochanowski (1566–1620)\n\nJan z Kijan (Dzwonowski?, early 1600s)[6]\n\nEnlightenment[]\n\nThe period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century during the reign of Poland's last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski.[7] It went into sharp decline with the Third and final Partition of Poland (1795) followed by political, cultural and economic destruction of the country, leading to Great Emigration of Polish elites. The Enlightenment ended around 1822, and was replaced by Polish Romanticism at home and abroad.[2]\n\nOne of the leading Polish Enlightenment poets was Ignacy Krasicki (1735–1801), known locally as \"the Prince of Poets\" and Poland's La Fontaine, author of the first Polish novel called The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom (Mikołaja Doświadczyńskiego przypadki); playwright, journalist, encyclopedist and translator from French and Greek. Another prominent writer of the period was Jan Potocki (1761–1815), a Polish nobleman, Egyptologist, linguist, and adventurer whose travel memoirs made him legendary in his homeland. Outside Poland he is known chiefly for his novel, The Manuscript Found in Saragossa drawing comparisons to such celebrated works as the Decameron and the Arabian Nights. Notable Polish writers and poets of the Enlightenment period include:\n\nStanisław Leszczyński (1677–1766), \"Głos wolny...\"\n\nElżbieta Drużbacka (1695?–1765)\n\nStanisław Konarski (1700–1773), \"O skutecznym rad sposobie\"\n\nFranciszek Bohomolec (1720–1784), magazine Monitor\n\nStanisław August Poniatowski (1732–1798)\n\nAdam Naruszewicz (1733–1796)\n\nIgnacy Krasicki (1735–1801), Fables and Parables\n\nOnufry Kopczyński (1736–1817)\n\nStanisław Trembecki (1739–1812)\n\nFranciszek Salezy Jezierski (1740–1791)\n\nFranciszek Karpiński (1741–1825)\n\nJan Piotr Norblin (1745–1830)\n\nIzabela Czartoryska (1746–1835), Czartoryski Museum\n\nHugo Kołłątaj (1750–1812), Kuźnica Kołłątajowska\n\nFranciszek Kniaźnin (1750–1807)\n\nFranciszek Zabłocki (1754–1821), Towarzystwo do Ksiąg Elementarnych\n\nStanisław Staszic (1755–1826), Constitution of 1791\n\nJan Śniadecki (1756–1830)\n\nJulian Ursyn Niemcewicz (1758–1841), Constitution of 1791\n\nJakub Jasiński (1759–1794)\n\nTadeusz Czacki (1765–1813), Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk\n\nJędrzej Śniadecki (1768–1838), first Polish chemistry text book\n\nSamuel Linde (1771–1847), Towarzystwo do Ksiąg Elementarnych\n\nJózef Maksymilian Ossoliński, Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich\n\nAndrzej Stanisław Załuski and Józef Załuski, Biblioteka Załuskich\n\nRomanticism in the wake of the revolt[]\n\nDue to partitions carried out by the neighboring empires – which ended the existence of the sovereign Polish state in 1795 – Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe, was largely an independence movement that expressed the ideals, and way of life of the Polish people under foreign occupation. The period of Romanticism in Poland ended with the Tsarist suppression of the January 1863 Uprising marked by public executions by the Russians and deportations to Siberia.[8]\n\nThe literature of Polish Romanticism falls into two distinct periods both defined by insurgencies: the first around 1820–1832 ending with the November Uprising of 1830, and the second between 1832–1864, giving birth to Polish Positivism. In the first period, Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics. Their art featured emotionalism and imagination, folklore, country life, as well as the propagation of the ideals of independence. The most famous writers of the period were: Adam Mickiewicz, Seweryn Goszczyński, Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki. In the second period, after January Uprising many Polish Romantics worked abroad, often banished from the Polish soil by the occupying power. Their work became dominated by the ideals of freedom and the struggle for regaining their country's lost sovereignty. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. Also in that period, developed the idea of the poeta-wieszcz (nation's bard). The wieszcz functioned as spiritual leader to the suppressed people. The most notable poet among the leading bards of Romanticism, so recognized in both periods, was Adam Mickiewicz. Other two national poets were: Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński. Polish writers and poets of the Romantic period include:\n\nAdam Jerzy Czartoryski (1770–1861)\n\nAntoni Gorecki (1787–1861)\n\nAleksander Fredro (1791–1876), Zemsta\n\nKazimierz Brodziński (1791–1835)\n\nAntoni Malczewski (1793–1826)\n\nJan Czeczot (1796–1846)\n\nAdam Mickiewicz (1798–1855), Dziady, Pan Tadeusz\n\nKlementyna Hoffmanowa (1798–1845)\n\nFranciszek Salezy Dmochowski (1801–1871)\n\nSeweryn Goszczyński (1801–1876)\n\nMichał Czajkowski (1804–1886)\n\nZygmunt Krasiński (1812–1859), Nie-boska Komedia\n\nJózef Ignacy Kraszewski (1812–1887), Stara baśń\n\nGustaw Ehrenberg (1818–1895)\n\nTeodor Tomasz Jeż (1824–1915)\n\nMaria Wirtemberska (1768–1854)\n\nHenryk Rzewuski (1791–1866)\n\nTomasz Zan (1796–1855)\n\nJózef Bohdan Zaleski (1802–1886)\n\nMaurycy Mochnacki (1803–1834)\n\nWincenty Pol (1807–1882)\n\nLucjan Siemieński (1807–1877)\n\nJuliusz Słowacki (1809–1849), Balladyna, Kordian\n\nNarcyza Żmichowska (1819–1876)\n\nCyprian Kamil Norwid (1821–1883), Vade-mecum\n\nTeofil Lenartowicz (1822–1893)\n\nWładysław Syrokomla (1823–1862)\n\nKornel Ujejski (1823–1897)\n\nJadwiga Łuszczewska (1834–1908)\n\nMieczysław Romanowski (1834–1863)\n\nPositivism[]\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed January Uprising against the Russian occupation, the new period of Polish Positivism began to advocate skepticism and the exercise of reason. Questions addressed by the \"Positivist\" writers revolved around the so called \"organic work\" which included the establishment of equal rights for all members of society; the assimilation of Poland's Jewish minority; and the defense of the Polish population in the German-ruled part of Poland against Kulturkampf and their violent displacement. The writers were poised to educate the public about constructive patriotism which would enable Polish society to function as fully integrated social organism regardless of external circumstances.[9] The period lasted until the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the Young Poland movement. Prominent writers and poets of Polish Positivism include:\n\nNarcyza Żmichowska (1819–1876), precursor of feminism in Poland\n\nEdmund Chojecki (1822–1899)\n\nMaria Ilnicka (1825 or 1827–1897)\n\nJózef Szujski (1835–1883)\n\nMichał Bałucki (1837–1901)\n\nAdam Asnyk (1838–1897)\n\nAdolf Dygasiński (1839–1902)\n\nEliza Orzeszkowa (1841–1910), Nad Niemnem\n\nMaria Konopnicka (1842–1910), Rota\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz (1846–1916), Quo Vadis; Nobel Prize, 1905\n\nBolesław Prus (1847–1912), The Doll, Pharaoh\n\nAleksander Świętochowski (1849–1938)\n\nGabriela Zapolska (1857–1921)\n\nKazimierz Zalewski (1849–1919)\n\nMaria Rodziewiczówna (1863–1944)\n\nYoung Poland[]\n\nThe modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts, literature and music, came into being around 1890, and concluded with the Poland's return to independence. The period was based on two concepts. Its early stage was characterized by a strong aesthetic opposition to the ideals of its own predecessor (promoting organic work in the face of foreign occupation). Artists following this early philosophy of Young Poland believed in decadence, symbolism, conflict between human values and civilization, and the existence of art for art's sake. Prominent authors who followed this trend included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanisław Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The later ideology emerged in conjunction with the socio-political upheavals across Europe such as the 1905 Revolution against Nicholas II of Russia, the Norwegian independence, the Moroccan Crisis and others. It was a continuation of romanticism, often called neo-romanticism. The artists and writers following this idea covered a large variety of topics: from the sense of personal mission of a Pole exemplified by Stefan Żeromski's prose, through condemnation of social inequality in works by Władysław Reymont and Gabriela Zapolska, to criticism of Polish society and Polish revolutionary history by Stanisław Wyspiański. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his patriotic Trilogy inspiring a new sense of hope. Writers of this period include:[10]\n\nJan Kasprowicz (1860–1926)\n\nStefan Żeromski (1864–1925), Przedwiośnie (trilogy)\n\nFranciszek Nowicki (1864–1935)\n\nWładysław Reymont (1867–1925), Chłopi, Nobel Prize in Literature, 1924\n\nWacław Berent (1878-1940)\n\nAntoni Lange (1863–1929)\n\nTadeusz Miciński (1873–1918)\n\nFranciszek Nowicki (1864–1935)\n\nWładysław Orkan (1875–1930)\n\nTadeusz Rittner (1873–1921)\n\nWacław Sieroszewski (1858–1945)\n\nLeopold Staff (1878–1957)\n\nKazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer (1865–1940)\n\nTadeusz Boy-Żeleński (1874–1941), Zielony Balonik\n\nInterbellum and the return to independence[]\n\nLiterature of the Second Polish Republic encompasses a short, though exeptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. In large part, derivative of these changes was the collective and unobstructed development of programs for artists and writers. New avant-garde trends had emerged. The period, spanning just twenty years, was full of notable individualities who saw themselves as exponents of changing European civilization, including Tuwim, Witkacy, Gombrowicz, Miłosz, Dąbrowska and Nałkowska. They all contributed to a new model of the twentieth-century Polish culture echoing its own language of everyday life.[11][12][13]\n\nThe two decades of Interbellum were marked by rapid development in the field of poetry, undivided and undiminished for the first time in over a century. From 1918 to 1939, the gradual and successive introduction of new ideas resulted in the formation of separate and distinct trends. The first decade of Polish interwar poetry was clear, constructive, and optimistic; as opposed to the second decade marked by dark visions of the impending war, internal conflicts within the Polish society, and growing pessimism. The whole period was amazingly rich nevertheless. One of the most prominent poets of the interwar period was Bolesław Leśmian whose creative personality developed before 1918, and in large part influenced both decades (until his death in 1937). The literary life of his contemporaries revolved mostly around the issues of independence. All Polish poets treated the concept of freedom with extreme seriousness, and many patriotic works had emerged at that time, not to mention a particular variant of a poetic cult of Piłsudski.\n\nJan Brzechwa (1900–1966)\n\nMaria Dąbrowska (1889–1965)\n\nWitold Gombrowicz (1904–1969), Ferdydurke\n\nBruno Jasieński (1901–1938)\n\nJarosław Iwaszkiewicz (1894–1980)\n\nMaria Kuncewiczowa (1899–1989)\n\nJan Lechoń (1899-1956)\n\nBolesław Leśmian (ca. 1877 –1937)\n\nJózef Mackiewicz (1902–85)\n\nKornel Makuszyński (1884–1953), Koziołek Matołek\n\nZofia Kossak-Szczucka (1890–1968), Krzyżowcy (trilogy)\n\nAndrzej Strug (1871–1937)\n\nStanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (1885–1939), Nienasycenie\n\nMaria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska (1891–1945)\n\nBruno Schulz (1892–1942), Sanatorium Pod Klepsydrą\n\nJulian Tuwim (1894–1953)\n\nKazimierz Wierzyński (1894–1969)\n\nStanisław Młodożeniec (1895–1959)\n\nAntoni Słonimski (1895–1976)\n\nAleksander Wat (1900–1967)\n\nJulian Przyboś (1901–1970)\n\nHalina Poświatowska (1935–1967)\n\nSee also: Skamander and Category:Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nIn the years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland, all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. The environment was chaotic, and the writers scattered: some found themselves in concentration and labor camps (or Nazi-era ghettos), others were deported out ​​of the country; some emigrated (Tuwim, Wierzyński), many more joined the ranks of Polish underground resistance movement (Baczyński, Borowski, Gajcy). All literary outlets were forced to cease operation. Writers who remained at home began organizing literary life in conspiracy including lectures, evenings of poetry, and secret meetings in the homes of writers and art facilitators. Polish cities where such meetings were held most frequently were: Warsaw, Kraków and Lwów. Writers participated in setting-up of the underground presses (out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland about 200 were devoted to literature).
