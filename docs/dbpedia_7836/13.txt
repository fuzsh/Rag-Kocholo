Hausa, widely spoken in Nigeria and Niger, is one of West Africaâ€™s most prominent languages and serves as a lingua franca for many in the region. It is a language of trade, culture and history. The melodic sounds and textures of Hausa reflect the vibrant markets, folklore and daily life of the region.

Hausa offers insight not only into the diverse culture of West Africa, but also into stories and traditions that are at the heart of the Hausa community.

At Sankofa, our Hausa courses are designed to take place in small, interactive groups, which allows for more intensive learning. The use of authentic materials enriches the learning process and allows students to connect more deeply with the cultural and historical essence of Hausa.
