        "text": "CATHERINE ACHOLONU'S APPRAISAL OF THE RESEARCH\n\nof Dr. BARRY FELL & EDO NYLAND\n\n\"All the words that researchers Edo Nyland and Dr. Barry Fell transcribed were Igbo words, which I could easily read and translate. When I told Nyland that I had translated the words he transcribed from Ogam stones he did not believe me at first. When Hugo Kennes found my work on the Internet and started informing all the Ogam researchers he knew including Nyland, Nyland asked him to get an Igbo dictionary from me. After a meeting with Pellech in Belgium, she convinced me to write further details for her site, and that led to my doing the Igbo Ogam VCV Dictionary.\" [Please also see New York Times article].\n\n\"Nyland's use of the word Saharanmight not be too far off the mark. However, he did not check West Africa, which has language links with North Africa because the direction of migrations from the Niger has been both northward and southward through the Ages. For example the Berber etymology of 'Barbarian' is related to Igbo in the sense that (according to Herodotus) the word means 'stranger'. Igbo\n\nword for \"Stranger\" is \"Obiarabia.\"\n\n\"My thesis is that Egyptwas the main outpost from where West African Kwa (Kwush/Kush) culture was exported to the rest of the world. Igbo is the Mega-Kwa language - the Kushite mother-language. Kush is the major bearer of this civilization. Ethiopiawas not just an East Africa location, but lay West too. According to Homer, it was in Sunset Ethiopia that the Gods congregated, and the people were called \"the Blameless Ethiopians in whose land the gods held banquets\". We have discovered the lost city of this Pre-historic Civilization, with its array of beautiful bronze and pottery works lost to living memory and posing an Enigma to African and World History.\"\n\n\"My analyses of the early archaeology of Sumer and of the Akkadian/Sumerian/Canaanite(Semitic) languages shows that all of them without exception were children of the Igbo language and that the earliest inhabitants of Sumerhad Igbo lifestyles in religion, architecture, clothing, etc., even in the recipe for soap-making (wood-ash/potash boiled in oil).\"\n\n\"Igbo is in the family of Niger-Congo languages called Kwa by European linguists, which includes many Nigerian and West African languages like Ashanti, Akan, Yoruba and Benin (Edo). Igbo, I find to be closest to the original mother of that language family. In fact my finding is that in order to not let the Igbo know that it was their language that birthed the others, the linguists invented the word Kwa, which was originated from Akwa Nshi (Igbo for 'First People', also the local name of the Nigerian monoliths that represent First People on the planet). This word was used also by the ancient Egyptians to describe the West African, in fact Igbo-speaking, Sea People (Kwush, see Martin Bernal - Black Athena ) who brought civilization to the Aegean and the Levant during the Hyksos (which means 'Kwush') Exodus. Kwush, also pronounced Kush means in Semitic and in Igbo 'People of the Esh/Eshi'. Eshi are the so-called 'Blameless Ethiopians' of Homer. In Sumer and in Igbo, the word meant 'Righteous/Sons of God/Descendants of the Adama (see The Nag Hammadi Scriptures and the Torah). Adam was Adama before the Fall. After he fell he became Adam, a word, which in Igbo means 'I have Fallen'. Today in Igbo land we still have the descendants of the Immortal First People. They have never ceased to go by Adam's original name - 'Adama'. They are the Land Chiefs in Igbo land.\"\n\n\"Biblical Kush was named after the Ikwu Eshi/Kwush. Ikwu Eshi literally means in Igbo - 'Descendant/Lineage of the Eshi'.\"\n\n\"The Sea People were related to the Hebrews. They all spoke Semitic languages. They were the founders of Greece, Crete, Troy, and Rome. They were the Carians, Danaans, Acheans, and Myceneans, not excluding the Hittites. The writing systems they gave to Crete and early Middle East have been mostly found on the Igbo Ukwu excavated artifacts (see The Lost Testament), while the surviving words from their period had many Igbo cognates. Their exodus began in Egypt, remember? And Egypt, according to our findings was an outpost of an originally West African civilization in the time of Osiris (10,000 B.C.), whose Nigerian equivalent bore the Ogam scarifications on his face as his personal signature. We have found many hieroglyphs and pyramid symbols of Egypt on body adornments of ancient Nigerian gods and monuments.\"\n\n\"Ogam was a writing system, not a language. Ancient Africans had other writing forms, too. Egyptian hieroglyphics was not a language; it was a writing system that could only be read correctly and meaningfully if you know the language. In this case, Igbo, the original Kwa.\"\n\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThe 2013 book:Acholonu, Catherine Oianuju & Sidney Louis Davis, Jr. 2013. Eden in Sumer on the Niger-- Archeological, Linguistic and Gnetic Evidence of 450,000 years of Atlantis, Eden and Sumer in West Africa. (A sequel to \"The Gram Code of African Adam\", \"They lived Before Adam\" & \"The Lost Testament of The Ancestors of Adam\"). [provides archeological, linguistic, genetic and recorded evidence of the West African origin of mankind, language, religion, culture and civilization. It also gives multidisciplinary evidence of the actual geographical locations in West Africa of the Garden of Eden, Atlantis, and the original homeland of the Sumerian people before their migration to the Middle East.\n\nBy translating the hitherto unknown pre-cuneiform inscriptions of the Sumerians, the layers of thousands of years of Africa's lost pre-history have been brought to the fore. The identity is revealed of the West African villages, tribes and clans that supplied the Pharaohs of Egypt, and African faces are placed on the African kings of Sumer's Akkad, Ur, Uruk, Mesopotamia, even the Indus Valley- all products of the original African home of the Sumerians."
