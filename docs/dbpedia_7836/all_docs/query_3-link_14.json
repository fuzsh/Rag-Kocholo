        "text": "Niger-Congo Language Family\n\nThe Niger-Congo language family is one of the largest language families in the world and the largest one in Africa in terms of its geographical spread across most of sub-Saharan Africa, number of speakers, and the number of languages (1514). Almost all of the most widely spoken languages of sub-Saharan Africa belong to the Niger-Congo family, and about 600 million people (85% of Africa’s population) speak a Niger-Congo language.\n\nThere is no consensus among scholars about the origins and historical development of the Niger-Congo languages. The earliest evidence of a Niger-Congo language dates back to Portuguese records of the 16th century. However, few grammars were published prior to the 19th century although the first known grammar of an African language (Kongo) was written by an Italian missionary in 1659. A number of dictionaries and grammars appeared in the 19th century. They were written mostly by European missionaries who often lacked the linguistic training necessary to analyze languages that had little in common with their own. With a few exceptions, the resulting descriptions forced these languages into an ill-fitting Latin straitjacket.\n\nDetermining the number of languages in this family is complicated by the fact that it is often difficult to decide, in the absence of written historical records, whether two language varieties are two dialects of the same language or two separate languages.\n\nThere are several problems in classifying languages of the Niger-Congo family — a very large and extremely diverse group of languages that have been splitting from each other for thousands of years. First and foremost, is the lack of historical records that date back more than several hundred years. Second, very limited knowledge about a great many of the languages makes it extremely difficult to reconstruct their common ancestry.\n\nThe Niger-Congo language family is usually divided into several major branches that are estimated to have split from the ancestral language some 5,000 years ago. Some of the branches are closer to each other than others because they split from the ancestral language at different times. The majority of languages in these branches have small populations of speakers, with a significant percentage of them averaging only several thousand people. Large numbers of languages are often found clustered together in relatively small geographic areas.\n\nThe table below lists the most populous languages of the Niger-Congo family belonging to some of its different branches.\n\nBenue-Congo (961 languages)\n\nSwahili 773,000 1st- and 30 million 2nd-language speakers Tanzania Yoruba 19.3 million 1st- and 2 million 2nd-language speakers Nigeria Igbo 18 million Nigeria Shona 10.6 million 1st- and 1.8 million 2nd- or 3rd-language speakers Zimbabwe Zulu 9.5 million 1st- and 15.7 million 2nd-language speakers South Africa Nyanja (Chichewa) 7 million 1st-language and 400,000 2nd-language speakers Malawi Kinyarwanda (Rwanda) 7.3 million Rwanda Xhosa 7.2 million South Africa Luba-Kasai 6.3 million 1st- and 700,000 2nd-language speakers Democratic Republic of the Congo Gikuyu (Kikuyu) 5.3 million Kenya Southern Sotho 4.9 million Lesotho, Botswana, South Africa Rundi (Kirundi) 4.8 million Burundi Tswana 4.4 million Botswana Umbundu 4 million Angola Northern Sotho 3.7 million South Africa Tsonga 3.2 million South Africa Ganda (Luganda) 3 million 1st-language and 1 million 2nd-language speakers Uganda Lingala 2 million 1st-language and 5 million 2nd-language speakers Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo Mbundu 3 million Angola Kamba 2.4 million 1st-language and 600,000 2nd-language speakers Kenya Tiv 2.2 million Nigeria Ibibio 1.5 to 2 million Nigeria Swati (Swazi) 1.7 million Swaziland Ndebele 1.6 million Zimbabwe Soga 1.3 million Uganda Tumbuka 1.3 million Guinea Nyamwezi 1.2 million Tanzania Koongo 1 million Democratic Republic of the Congo Chokwe 1 million Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nAtlantic (64 languages)\n\nFula 12 million Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Benin, Guinea, Senegal Wolof 3.6 million Senegal Serer-Sine 1.2 million Senegal, Gambia Themne 1.2 million Sierra Leone\n\nMande (71 languages)\n\nPular 2.9 million Guinea Bambara (Bamanankan) 2.8 million Mali Maninkakan, Eastern 2 million Guinea Mende 1.5 million Sierra Leone Mandinka 1.2 million Senegal Jula 1.2 million 1st-language and 3-4 million 2nd-language speakers Burkina Faso Soninke 1.1 million Mali Tura-Dan-Mano 1.1 million Liberia, Côte-d’Ivoire Susu 1 million Guinea Ebira 1 million Nigeria Edo 1 million Nigeria Nupe-Nupe-Tako 800,000 Nigeria Igala 800,000 Nigeria\n\nGur (96 languages)\n\nMòoré 5 million Bourkina Faso, Ghana, Togo Senari 1.1 million Côte-d’Ivoir, Burkina Faso, Mali Dagaare, Southern 1 million Ghana Dagbani 800,000 Ghana Baatonum 560,000 Benin\n\nKwa (80 languages)\n\nAkan 8.3 million 1st- and 1 million 2nd- language speakers Ghana Éwé 3.1 million 1st- and 500,000 2nd-language speakers Ghana\n\nIjoid (10)\n\nIzon 1 million Nigeria\n\nKru (39 languages)\n\nBété 446,000 Côte-d’Ivoire Dida 203,,000 Côte-d’Ivoire\n\nAdamawa-Ubangi (158 languages)\n\nZande 1.1 million Democratic Republic of the Congo Gbaya 580,000 Central African Republic\n\nCreoles\n\nKituba 4.2 million 1-st language and 800,000 2nd-language speakers Democratic Republic of the Congo Sango 404,000 1st-language and 1.6 million 2nd-language speakers Central African Republic\n\nFor a complete listing of all Niger-Congo languages consult Ethnologue.\n\nStatus\n\nThe colonial regimes that had governed much of the African continent left a lasting imprint on the status of the languages of the African countries. In post-colonial Africa, indigenous languages have rarely been constitutionally accorded official status. By and large, the only official languages accorded this position in post-colonial Africa are the colonial languages. A survey of African countries in which Niger-Congo languages are spoken shows that all of them list English, French, or Portuguese as their official or co-official languages despite the fact that the majority of their populations speak indigenous languages.\n\nThe languages listed below and many others that are not listed here are taught in primary and secondary schools. Only a few are used as a medium of instruction at the university level.

Let us know and we’ll add them here!\n\nStructure\n\nSound system\n\nIt is difficult to make generalizations about the sound systems of the Niger-Congo languages due to their diversity, their large number, and the fact that little is known about a great many of them.\n\nVowels\n\nNiger-Congo vowel systems share several distinguishing features:\n\nSyllable structure\n\nSyllables in Niger-Congo languages typically end in a vowel or nasal consonant. Consonant clusters are rare or nonexistent.\n\nVowel harmony\n\nMost Niger-Congo languages have two sets of vowels: one set is pronounced with an advanced tongue root [+ATR], the other set is pronounced with a retracted tone root [-ATR]. Advanced tongue root is produced by moving the base of the tongue forward during the pronunciation of a vowel. This adds abreathy quality to the vowel. Only one of these sets can occur in any given word. This phenomenon is called vowel harmony.\n\nNasalization\n\nMost Niger-Congo languages have a small set of nasalized vowels. Nasalized vowels are pronounced with the velum (soft palate) lowered, so that some air escapes through the nose as well as through the mouth.\n\nConsonants\n\nConsonants in many Niger-Congo languages share several distinguishing features:\n\nPrenasalized consonants\n\nIn some languages, there are prenasalized consonants, e.g., in the Swahili word ndizi ‘banana,’ the first consonant nd is pronounced as one sound, not as two.\n\nLabial-velar stops\n\nThese doubly-articulated consonants are produced with a simultaneous labial and velar closure, e.g., [gb] in the name of the language Gbaya.\n\nIn addition to these features, Bantu languages such as Zulu and Xhosa, have a variety of click, implosive and ejective consonants.\n\nTones\n\nMost of the Niger-Congo languages are tonal, with some exceptions such as Swahili. The properties of the tonal systems vary considerably. In some languages tones are used to represent grammatical categories, while in others they are used to distinguish between otherwise identical words.\n\nGrammar\n\nIt is difficult to make generalizations about the grammatical systems of the Niger-Congo languages due to their diversity, large number, and the fact that little is known about a great many of them. On the whole, however, Niger-Congo languages are agglutinative, i.e., grammatical functions are expressed by adding prefixes and suffixes to lexical stems and roots.\n\nNoun phrase\n\nOne of the most notable characteristics of some Niger-Congo languages is the system of noun classes. The number of noun classes ranges from 3 to 25 depending on the language. Classes may have phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic correlates. Nouns in Benue-Congo languages, for instance, are assigned to classes on the basis of their singular and plural forms that are marked by one prefix or suffix in the singular and another in the plural. Noun modifiers, e.g., pronouns, adjectives, numerals and sometimes even verbs, are also marked with the same prefix or suffix as the noun. There are exceptions, such as Mande languages that do not have noun classes.\n\nVerb phrase\n\nVerbs in Niger-Congo languages are highly inflected. Many notions that are expressed by words in English are realized as prefixes and suffixes. Niger-Congo verbs use various prefixes and suffixes to mark person, tense, aspect, and mood. Suffixes are also used to derive passive, causative, reciprocal, and prepositional forms.\n\nWord order\n\nThe usual word order in Niger-Congo languages is Subject-Verb-Object. In some languages, the subject may be part of the verb. Certain Gur languages are characterized by a Subject-Object-Verb sequence.\n\nVocabulary\n\nNiger-Congo languages have enriched their vocabularies by borrowing from languages with which they have had contact. For instance, Swahili and Yoruba have borrowed a significant number of Arabic words from contact with Arab traders and through the influence of Islam. Zulu and Xhosa, on the other hand, borrowed from neighboring Khoisan languages and Afrikaans. Most Niger-Congo languages have numerous loanwords from French, Portuguese, and English. The latter is the most recent major source of borrowing\n\nBecause these languages have split from their common ancestors a very long time ago, their vocabularies have evolved to the point that even the most common words, such as the numerals below, show few resemblances. However, they tend to share some common derivational processes such as compounding.\n\nNumbers in selected Niger-Congo languages\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nBenue-Congo\n\nSwahili\n\nmoja\n\nmbili\n\ntatu\n\nnne\n\ntano\n\nsita\n\nsaba\n\nnane\n\ntisa\n\nkumi\n\nYoruba\n\není\n\nèjì\n\nèta\n\nèrin\n\nárún\n\nèfà\n\nèje\n\nèjo\n\nèsán\n\nèwá\n\nIgbo\n\notu\n\naboa\n\nato\n\nanô\n\nise\n\nisi\n\nasa\n\nasato\n\niteghete\n\niri\n\nShona\n\nmotsi\n\npiti\n\ntatu\n\nchina\n\nshanu\n\ntanhatu\n\nchinomwe\n\nrusere\n\npfumbamwe\n\ngumi\n\nZulu\n\nnye\n\nbili\n\ntatu\n\nne\n\nhlanu\n\nisitupa\n\nisikom\n\nbisa\n\nshiyan\n\ngalombili\n\nshiya\n\ngalolunye\n\nishumi\n\nXhosa\n\nnye\n\nb’ini\n\nthathu\n\nne\n\nhlanu\n\nthandathu\n\nsosixhenxe\n\nsosibhozo\n\nsolithoba\n\nsolishumi\n\nLingala\n\nmoko\n\nmibale\n\nmisato\n\nminei\n\nmitano\n\nmotobo\n\nnsambo\n\nmwambe\n\nlibwa\n\njomi\n\nKinyarwanda\n\nlimwe\n\nkabili\n\ngatatu\n\nkane\n\ngatanu\n\ngatandatu\n\nkalindwi\n\numunani\n\nicyenda\n\nicumi\n\nRundi\n\nmwe\n\nbiri\n\ntatu\n\nne\n\nta:nu\n\ntandatu\n\nindwi\n\numana:ni\n\ni-ce:nda\n\ni-cumi\n\nTswana\n\nmongwe-fêla\n\nbababêch\n\nbabar\n\naro\n\nbab\n\nanê\n\nbabat\n\nlhano\n\nbabara\n\ntaro\n\nbashupa\n\nbafêromenô êmêbedi\n\nbafêra monô ole mongwe\n\nleshome\n\nNorthern Sotho\n\nu-mongga\n\npedi\n\ntharo\n\nnne\n\nhlano\n\ntshela\n\nshupa\n\nseswai\n\nsenyane\n\nleshome\n\nMande\n\nBamanankan (Bambara)\n\nkelen\n\nfila\n\nsaba\n\nnaani\n\nduuru\n\nwooro\n\nwòlonfla\n\nsegi\n\nkòno_ntò\n\ntan\n\nAtlantic\n\nFulfulde\n\ngo’o\n\nd’d’\n\ntat\n\nnay\n\njow\n\njoweego’o\n\njoweed’id’\n\njoweetat\n\njoweenay\n\nsappo\n\nKwa\n\nÉwé\n\ndeká\n\neve\n\neto\n\nene\n\nató\n\nadé\n\nadré\n\nenyí\n\nenyíde\n\newó\n\nWriting\n\nMost Niger-Congo languages were unwritten prior to the 19th century when European missionaries started to create writing systems, dictionaries, and grammars for these languages. The missionaries used the letters of the Latin alphabet to represent sounds of Niger-Congo languages that had no counterparts in Indo-European languages. As a result, some of the alphabets they created were not well-suited to represent Niger-Congo languages, particularly those that have tones, breathy and creaky vowels, clicks, prenasalized, ejective, and implosive consonants.\n\nToday, many Niger-Congo languages are written in various versions of the African reference alphabet which was first proposed in 1978 by a UNESCO-organized conference held in Niamey, Niger. The alphabet was revised in 1982. The conference recommended the use of single letters rather than digraphs and diacritics for the orthographic representation of the phonemes, i.e., sounds that differentiate word meaning.\n\nAn exception is the N’Ko alphabet that was invented in 1949 in Guinea by Solomana Kante for writing in Malinke. It is mainly used by speakers of Malinke, Bambara, and Jula in Guinea, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali and Côte-d’Ivoire. The N’Ko alphabet contains 26 symbols, including 7 vowels, 18 consonants, and one semivowel. There are also characters for the numerals 1-10. The N’Ko alphabet is written from right to left in horizontal lines, nasalization is indicated by diacritics below the vowels, length and tone are indicated by diacritics over the vowels.\n\nHere is a sample text in N’ko. It bears visual resemblance to the Arabic script.\n\nEven today, there are scores of Niger-Congo languages that remain unwritten.\n\nDifficulty"
