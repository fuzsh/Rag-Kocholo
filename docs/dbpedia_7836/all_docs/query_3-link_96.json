        "text": "19 Nov 2019\n\nDear Mrs Farley:\n\nThank you very much for submitting your manuscript \"Language and beliefs in relation to noma: a qualitative study, northwest Nigeria\" (PNTD-D-19-01408) for review by PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Your manuscript was fully evaluated at the editorial level and by independent peer reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic but identified some aspects of the manuscript that should be improved.\n\nWe therefore ask you to modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations before we can consider your manuscript for acceptance. Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer.\n\nIn addition, when you are ready to resubmit, please be prepared to provide the following:\n\n(1) A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.\n\n(2) Two versions of the manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed (uploaded as a \"Revised Article with Changes Highlighted\" file); the other a clean version (uploaded as the article file).\n\n(3) If available, a striking still image (a new image if one is available or an existing one from within your manuscript). If your manuscript is accepted for publication, this image may be featured on our website. Images should ideally be high resolution, eye-catching, single panel images; where one is available, please use 'add file' at the time of resubmission and select 'striking image' as the file type.\n\nPlease provide a short caption, including credits, uploaded as a separate \"Other\" file. If your image is from someone other than yourself, please ensure that the artist has read and agreed to the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution License at http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/content-license (NOTE: we cannot publish copyrighted images).\n\n(4) Appropriate Figure Files\n\nPlease remove all name and figure # text from your figure files upon submitting your revision. Please also take this time to check that your figures are of high resolution, which will improve both the editorial review process and help expedite your manuscript's publication should it be accepted. Please note that figures must have been originally created at 300dpi or higher. Do not manually increase the resolution of your files. For instructions on how to properly obtain high quality images, please review our Figure Guidelines, with examples at: http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/figures\n\nWhile revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool, https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/ PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. To use PACE, you must first register as a user. Then, login and navigate to the UPLOAD tab, where you will find detailed instructions on how to use the tool. If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at gro.solp@serugif.\n\nPlease note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.\n\nWe hope to receive your revised manuscript by Jan 18 2020 11:59PM.

Therefore, programs aimed at encouraging awareness regarding noma should consider the importance using a variety of names when communicating about noma.\n\nA second important finding is that noma may be thought to have a spiritual cause, and this would explain why many patients first receive treatment from a traditional healer. Increased education regarding the causes of noma, and the importance of urgently receiving treatment from qualified medical personnel, may improve outcomes of noma.\n\nI have additional recommendations regarding some changes that would improve how the manuscript reads (below)\n\nThroughout the manuscript, would re-word 'noma patients' to 'patients with noma'\n\nabstract line 2 – suggest, ‘most patients live in’\n\nline 5 – suggest ‘programs’ instead of ‘programmes’\n\nabstract - health care center instead of centre\n\n'Carer' was unclear to me initially when reading the manuscipt\n\nSuggest\n\nPatient caretaker, and would further describe who these caretakers normally are, that is, are these family members vs. other caretakers?\n\nSuggest revising the below sentences (as revised below):\n\nDifficulty in accessing care for patietns with noma was evident and\n\nthe findings suggest a variety of actions taking place before reaching a health center or\n\nhealth worker. Patient caregivers mentioned that barriers to care included a lack of knowledge regarding this medical condition, as well as a lack of trust in seeking medical care. Participants in our study spoke of the mental health strain the disease\n\nplaced on them (remove \"as carers\"), particularly due to the stigma that is associated with noma.\n\nConclusions Paragraph: Suggest rewording to below:\n\nCarer and practitioner perspectives may enlighten efforts to improve outcomes (remove case finding), and to understand barriers to health care access (re-worded).\n\nDifferences in disease naming illustrates the difference in beliefs and has an impact on if and how individuals seek medical care (re-worded),\n\nwhich for noma cases has important ramifications on outcomes, due to the rapid progression of the disease (re-worded).\n\nLine 19 - Would recommend re-wording the sentence to \"most patients live in\"\n\nLine 21 - suggest ‘programs’ instead of ‘programmes’\n\nLine 35 - suggest ‘center ‘instead of ‘centre’\n\nLine 35-37\n\nPatient caregivers mentioned that barriers to care included a lack of knowledge, regarding the medical condition, as well as lack of trust in seeking medical care.
