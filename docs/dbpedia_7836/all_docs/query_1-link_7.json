        "meta_description": "Hausa is a Chadic (Afro-Asiatic) language spoken by roughly 36 million people as a first-language, in at least 10 territories. The largest numbers of speakers are in Nigeria and Niger, and there are also significant numbers of first-language speakers in Sudan, Chad, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. Hausa is also used as a lingua franca over much of West Africa, and as such its use continues to grow.",

        "text": "Technical Notes\n\nTerritory size shows the proportion of all people who speak Hausa as a first language that live in that territory. This map removes the countries where Hausa is dominant. This map therefore only shows 2.3% of all speakers of Hausa. The territories omitted are Nigeria and Niger.\n\nDefinition\n\nThe maps in the 2005 language data series are made from data on the number of people speaking a language as their first-language, that is the language they would use at home.\n\nData sources\n\nThis map uses data several sources, the main one being Ethnologue (15th Edition, 2005). Estimating the number of speakers of a language is fraught with difficulty on several levels (last accessed January 2009). We aim to map as complete data as possible and therefore estimate data for missing values. The language numbers we use and publish are rough estimates, and should not be taken as definitive. In some cases, missing data for very small territories is not used in the cartogram and that area is therefore omitted in the map.\n\nFurther notes on the data, as well as all modifications to the original data source are noted in our data sheets.\n\nDownload data file"
