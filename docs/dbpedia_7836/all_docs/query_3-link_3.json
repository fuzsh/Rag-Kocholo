        "text": "Nigeria is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world, with over 500 languages spoken. The official language is English, but it is spoken less frequently in rural areas and amongst people with lower education levels. Other major languages spoken include: Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Fulfulde, Ibibio, Kanuri, and Tiv. Nigerian Sign Language, Hausa Sign Language, and Bura Sign Language are all used in Nigeria. The maps, documents, and datasets below provide information about languages spoken in the northeast part of the country.\n\nCurated datasets\n\nComing soon\n\nOther sources of language data\n\nWikipedia\n\nGlottolog\n\nAn Atlas of Nigerian Languages\n\nTools\n\nWhy we need to collect data on the languages of crisis-affected people (PDF)\n\nRapid Guide to Localizing and Translating Survey Tools (EN, FR, PT)\n\nLanguage data allows humanitarian organizations to better understand the languages people speak and understand, leading to better programming and accountability. We’re working with University College London’s Centre for Translation Studies and others to make language data more easily accessible and usable.\n\nFor more information, read about the project on our blog or contact [email protected].\n\nMaps and resources:\n\nAn interactive map of languages spoken by LGA in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states. Language data is from the 2019 Multi-Sectoral Needs Assessment and is only based on sites that were accessible to REACH data collection teams.\n\nAn interactive map of individual language distribution by LGA in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states. Language data is from the 2019 Multi-Sectoral Needs Assessment and is only based on sites that were accessible to REACH data collection teams.\n\nThis interactive map and dashboard provide data related to language and communication preferences by site in Northeast Nigeria. Data collected from IOM's Displacement Tracking Matrix team.\n\nThis report from November 2018 highlights language barriers in humanitarian data collection in northeast Nigeria. It found that language is not a routine consideration in survey design and enumerators often do not understand the words they are being asked to translate in surveys.\n\nThis blog summarizes key language and communication findings from the 2019 Multi-Sectoral Needs Assessment."
