In Nigeria it is the first language of at least 25 million people, with another 15 million speaking it fluently as a second language. As a result it has become the lingua franca for most of the northern part of the country. There are also about 5 million speakers in neighboring Niger and smaller numbers in other countries.\n\nHausa belongs to the Chadic branch of the Afro-Asiatic (Hamito-Semitic) family of languages. Before the colonial period it was written in a variety of the Arabic script known as Ajami, but this has largely given way to a modified Roman script introduced by the British. The language contains many words borrowed from the Arabic.\n\nHausa is spoken/used in the following countries:\n\nNiger, Nigeria.\n\nLanguage Family\n\nFamily: Afro-Asiatic (Hamito-Semitic)\n\nSubgroup: Chadic\n\nCopyright © Kenneth Katzner, The Languages of the World, Published by Routledge.\n\nWriting Sample\n\nTranslation\n\nThe Ground Squirrel and the Hedgehog:One day it was raining: the hedgehog greeted the squirrel saying, \"How do you like the cold? Is there anywhere I can shelter?\" The squirrel replied, \"I'm well, thank God. Here's a little place, enter!\" They then lived together, but after a while the squirrel said, \"Hedgehog! This stay of yours with me is unpleasant, your body is all prickles. Change your abode!\" The hedgehog said, \"Is that so? As for me, I enjoy it: the one whom this place doesn't suit, shouldn't he change it for another?\""
