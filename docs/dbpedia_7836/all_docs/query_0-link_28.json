        "text": "The largest Hausa speaker groups are found in Nigeria and Niger, with smaller communities in other West African countries such as Ghana, Cameroon, Chad and Sudan. Due to its use as a trade language, Hausa is one of the most widespread languages in Central Africa - at least if first and second speakers are counted together. The language is used in the media, in education and in government.\n\nDevelopment of Hausa\n\nHausa is a Chadian language that belongs to the larger Afro-Asian language family. The first written records of the Hausa language date back to the 16th century. It is assumed that the language itself is much older.\n\nGeographically and historically, Hausa originated in what is now northern Nigeria and southern Niger. This area, known as Hausaland, was a center of trans-Saharan trade, giving Hausa an important role as a lingua franca in West Africa. Over time, trade, conquest and the spread of Islam led to the spread of the language over a wide area.\n\nThe development of the Hausa language was strongly influenced by the Arabic language, especially after the adoption of Islam in the region. Many Arabic terms were incorporated into the Hausa vocabulary, especially in areas such as religion, education and administration. In the 19th century, the Fulani conquests further contributed to the spread of the language by promoting Hausa as an administrative and commercial language in the newly conquered territories.\n\nThe language also has a literary tradition that includes both oral poetry and written literature, often written in Ajami, a script based on Arabic. Today, Hausa is written both in a modified Arabic script and in Latin script, the latter having been standardized since the 1950s through a literacy program during the British colonial period."
