        "text": "Most of the languages are primarily oral with little available in written form. The languages of Africa break down into four large families (phyla), with an additional Austronesian family spoken in Madagascar; the four continental language families are:\n\nNiger-Congo\n\nNilo-Saharan\n\nAfroasiatic\n\nKhoisan\n\nNiger-Congo\n\nNiger-Congo, with approximately 1,350 - 1,650 languages is the largest of the four; it is also the largest language family in the world. The Niger-Congo languages inhabit Western, Central, Eastern and Southern Africa. The most widely spoken languages of Africa, Swahili (200 million), Yoruba (45 million), Igbo (30 million), and Fula (35 million) all belong to the Niger-Congo family.\n\nLearn more about the Niger-Congo language family on Ethnologue.\n\nAfroasiatic\n\nThe next largest family is Afroasiatic with about 200 - 300 member languages in Africa The Afroasiatic languages in Africa are found mainly in the Northern regions of Africa, including: northern Nigeria (Hausa), southern Niger, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and in the North African countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, etc.\n\nLearn more about the Afroasiatic language family on Ethnologue.\n\nNilo-Saharan\n\nNext in size is the Nilo-Saharan family with about 80 languages. These occupy Eastern Africa and the North Eastern region of Africa, namely: Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Chad, the Sudan, etc.\n\nLearn more about the Nilo-Saharan language family on Ethnologue.\n\nKhoisan\n\nLast but not least is the Khoisan family with between 40 - 70 members. Believed to be the oldest of the four language families, it is the smallest of the four and is found mainly in Southern Africa.\n\nLearn more about the Khoisan language family on Ethnologue.\n\nThe population numbers given here are approximations from various population census statistics."
