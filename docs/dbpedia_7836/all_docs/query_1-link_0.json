Depending on how they are counted, Niger has between 8 and 20 indigenous languages, belonging to the Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan and Niger–Congo families. The discrepancy comes from the fact that several are closely related, and can be grouped together or considered apart.\n\nOfficial Languages\n\n[edit]\n\nFrench, inherited from the colonial period, is the official language. It is spoken mainly as a second language by people who have received an education (20% of Nigeriens are literate in French, and even 47% in cities, growing quickly as literacy improves[1]). Although educated Nigeriens still constitute a relatively small percentage of the population, the French language is the language used by the official administration (courts, government, etc.), the media and the business community. See also: African French[citation needed]\n\nNiger has ten official national languages, namely Arabic, Buduma, Fulfulde, Gourmanchéma, Hausa, Kanuri, Zarma & Songhai, Tamasheq, Tassawaq, Tebu.[2] These ten national languages, their language families, the approximate percentage of the population that speak them, their approximate home regions, and additional information are as follows:[citation needed]\n\nLanguage Family Approx % Main region Notes Hausa Afro-Asiatic / Chadic 55.4% South, central Main trade language[3] Songhai Songhay languages (nilo-saharan) 21% Southwest Zarma and Songhay are considered together Tamasheq Afro-Asiatic / Berber 9.3% North Fulfulde Niger–Congo / Atlantic 8.5% All Fulfulde of Western Niger & Central-Eastern Niger are considered together Kanuri Nilo-Saharan 4.7% Southeast Arabic Afro-Asiatic / Semitic 0.4% Southeast Particularly spoken by the Diffa Arabs mainly in the Diffa Region Gourmanchéma Niger–Congo / Gur 0.4% Southwest corner Spoken mainly by the Gurma people of southwest Niger Tebu Nilo-Saharan 0.4% East Spoken mainly by the Toubou people of Eastern Niger Other N/A 0.1% Throughout Any other languages\n\nLanguages by number of speakers (according to Ethnologue)[4]\n\n[edit]\n\nRank Language Speakers in Niger 1 Hausa 14,500,000 2 Zarma 3,590,000 3 French 2,506,000 4 Fulfulde, Central-Eastern Niger 450,000 5 Fulfulde, Western Niger 450,000 6 Tamajaq, Tawallammat 450,000 7 Kanuri, Manga 280,000 8 Tamajeq, Tayart 250,000 9 Kanuri, Yerwa 80,000 10 Dazaga 50,000 11 Kanuri, Tumari 40,000 12 Gourmanchéma 30,000 13 Tagdal 26,900 14 Kanuri, Bilma 20,000 15 Tamahaq, Tahaggart 20,000 16 Arabic, Hassaniyya 19,000 17 Arabic, Algerian Saharan Spoken 10,000 18 Tedaga 10,000 19 Arabic, Libyan Spoken 9,300 20 Arabic, Shuwa 9,300 21 Tasawaq 8,000 22 Arabic, Standard 7,800 23 Tetserret 2,000\n\nBy Region\n\n[edit]\n\nDominant languages\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Languages Agadez Region Tuareg, Kanuri Diffa Region Kanuri Dosso Region Zarma Maradi Region Hausa Niamey Zarma Tahoua Region Hausa Tillabéri Region Zarma Zinder Region Kanuri\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics of Niger\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
