        "text": "On 8 January 1897 the name of ‘Nigeria’ appeared in print for the first time. It was the title of an article in our leading newspaper, written by Miss Flora Shaw, who at that time ‘did the Colonies for The Times’, as Cecil Rhodes expressed it. Miss Shaw later became the wife of Lord Lugard, the great builder of Nigeria; and one of the greatest of all British Colonial Administrators. And here is what Miss Shaw said.\n\n4 The term ‘Nile of the Negroes’ seems to have been applied mostly to the Senegal river which Ibn Said, writing in the thirteenth century, had called ‘the Nile of Ghana’.Google Scholar\n\n9 The account of Hanno's voyage was inscribed on a tablet in Phoenician and hung in the temple of Melkarth at Carthage. The account, now extant, is a Greek translation—the Periplus, but originally it was written in the Punic language.Google Scholar\n\n17 See Strabo, XVII, 3, 20Google Scholar, Sallust, B.J. 79Google Scholar, and Valerius Maximus, B.V.C. 6.Google Scholar The Philanoi were supposed to be two brothers, citizens of Carthage, who, in order to settle a boundary dispute with the people of Cyrene, allowed themselves to be buried alive. A well-known translator of Pliny discredits the story because of the supposed Greek name of the brothers, viz. ‘Lovers of praise’! ϕίλος + àινος. (See Bohn's translation of Pliny, N.H. I, 394, footnote.)Google Scholar\n\n21 There is some doubt about the date at which Vitruvius wrote, but most scholars believe that Augustus is the Imperator Caesar to whom he dedicated his work, which is quoted later by the elder Pliny.Google Scholar\n\n24 See, e.g., Mela, I, 4, 3 and III, 10, 4Google Scholar and Pliny, N.H. v, 8, 8, § 43.Google Scholar But nigritia was also in common use among post-Augustan writers in the abstract sense to describe the colour ‘blackness’. Our English words Nigritian, Nigritic and the obsolete Nigrite seem to be regarded (by the Oxford Dictionary) as derivatives of the Latin adjective niger = black. Yet the term Nigritia was being commonly used in England during the nineteenth century with the geographical connotation of ‘the region nearly co-extensive with the Sudan’ (see Shorter Oxford Dictionary).\n\n32 See my A Sudanese Kingdom, 418: ‘It is said that this animal, when it has been severely wounded and lies down to die, keeps its upper eye open; and if the hunter approaches it before it has died and meets its dying glance, he will be pursued by the animal's ghost until his own has been captured.’Google Scholar;\n\n40 Odyssey, I, 23–4. (‘The Ethiopians, the most remote of mankind are divided into two parts: The one at the setting of Hyperion, the other at his rising.’)Google Scholar\n\n67 But there are powerful arguments against this view—notably, the use of the expressions ‘Nigeira Metropolis’ and The Geir Ethiopians’. Pliny's river Niger was clearly conceived to flow south of the Sahara, while the great length of the river as described by the classical writers, coupled with the belief that it joined up with the Nile and that there was a seasonal swelling of the river (a feature of the Niger's great easterly affluent—the Benue), together with the account given of the fauna, are all inconsistent with the identification of the Niger with some small river of the Atlas region.Google Scholar"
