The total number of Hausa speakers is estimated at 63 million, according to Ethnologue. The ancestral language of the Hausa people, one of the largest ethnic groups in Central Africa, Hausa is mostly spoken throughout southern Niger and northern Nigeria. It is also a recognized minority language in the United States. It has developed into a lingua franca across much of Western Africa for purposes of trade.\n\nPhonology[]\n\nGrammar[]\n\nOrthography[]\n\nCommon difficulties[]\n\nThe Foreign Service Institute has classified Hausa as a \"Hard\" language. It is estimated that learning Hausa to a Professional Working Proficiency in the language (a score of Speaking-3/Reading-3 on the Interagency Language Roundtable scale) will take an average of 44 weeks (1100 class hours).[1]\n\nResources[]"
