        "text": "Introduction\n\nNigeria, a country in West Africa, is the most populous Black country in the world, with an estimated population of nearly 220 million people. A former British colony until 1960, Nigeria is one of the six countries that make up English-speaking West Africa (the others being Ghana, The Gambia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and a part of Cameroon). With an estimated 53% of Nigerians speaking a form of English, Nigeria is one of the largest English-speaking countries in the world. In Nigeria, English is a co-official language alongside three other indigenous languages: Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba. However, this is only in principle because, in practice, English is used as the sole official language in almost all official contexts, including governance, education, mass media, law courts etc. Even though the vast majority of English speakers in Nigeria use it as a second language, there is now a growing number of young Nigerians who speak Nigerian English as a first language.\n\nExcerpt taken from the OED article ‘Introduction to Nigerian English’ by Dr Kingsley Ugwuanyi, which explores the history and current status and linguistic features of English in Nigeria\n\nNigerian English words recently recorded in the OED\n\nbarbing salon, n.\n\nbuka, n.\n\nember months, n.\n\nmama put, n.\n\nokada, n.\n\nnext tomorrow, n. & adv.\n\nseverally, adv.\n\nto rub minds (together) in rub, v./1\n\nsend-forth, n.\n\nSee the full list of Nigerian English words most recently added to the OED.\n\nClick on the links above to view these words, or explore further using the advanced search (access our getting started guides to learn how to search the OED).\n\nSubmit a Nigerian English word to the OED\n\nUse this submission form to suggest a Nigerian English word for inclusion in the OED.\n\nNigerian English editors and consultants\n\nThe OED works in partnership with external experts from or in Nigeria to ensure that our entries for Nigerian English words draw from local knowledge and expertise and reflect the everyday reality and distinctive identity of the Nigerian English-speaking community.\n\nView our Nigerian English consultants below:\n\nProf Ulrike Gut, University of Münster (Nigerian English pronunciation)\n\nProf Philip Jaggar, SOAS University of London (etymology of words originating in Hausa)\n\nMr Kọ́lá Túbọ̀sún, writer, teacher, and linguist (also on etymology of words originating in Yorùbá)\n\nDr Kingsley Ugwuanyi, English Lecturer and Researcher, University of Nigeria (also on etymology of words originating in Igbo)\n\nNigerian English pronunciation\n\nView the OED’s pronunciation model and key to pronunciation for West African English.\n\nNigerian English resources from the OED events\n\nWorld English Symposium parallel session 3: World Englishes and context-based ELT in Nigeria\n\nLanguage prejudice and the documentation of minoritized varieties of English\n\nMama put in the OED: World Englishes and the Oxford English Dictionary\n\nNigerian English resources from the OED website\n\nIntroduction to Nigerian English\n\nNigerian English in the OED January 2020 update\n\nOne particularly interesting set of such loanwords and coinages has to do with Nigerian street food. The word buka, borrowed from Hausa and Yoruba and first attested in 1972, refers to a roadside restaurant or street stall that sells local fare at low prices. Another term for such eating places first evidenced in 1980 is bukateria, which adds to buka the –teria ending from the word cafeteria. An even more creative synonym is mama put, from 1979, which comes from the way that customers usually order food in a buka: they say ‘Mama, put…’ to the woman running the stall, and indicate the dish they want. The word later became a generic name for the female food vendors themselves—Nobel Prize-winning Nigerian playwright Wole Soyinka notably includes a Mama Put character in one of his works.\n\nExcerpt taken from the OED article ‘Nigerian English in the OED January 2020 update’"
