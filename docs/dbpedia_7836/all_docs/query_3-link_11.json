        "text": "Can you imagine the chaos we would be facing if the world wasn’t divided into perfectly balanced categories? If you entered a grocery store and there were no separate aisles for different household items, you would not be able to find a single thing. When people enter their rooms and they know exactly where something is, it helps them find that item much more easily. This is why when you send someone else to your room to pick up something, there is a high chance they won’t be able to find it. This is why we feel at peace in the world because we know where something is. If you woke up tomorrow and found out that the world isn’t divided in categories anymore and you have to look for items on a website before shopping instead of just opening the menu and selecting electronics and beauty, you will feel completely out of place.\n\nNature has also made categories for us and put things in their different places. A mountain cannot change its location and show up in the middle of a city. The same way, humans have made categories too so they can better understand the things around us. We have categorized both natural and man-made things. There are elements that we have divided in different categories based on their features and then there are skincare products which we placed in their respective places.\n\nLanguages are also something humans created. We made them so we can talk to each other properly and convey whatever we are feeling. However, the more the population of the earth grew, the more vernaculars we created. It is just like the cultures that are practiced in the world today. The more tribes and nations showed up on earth, the more traditions they made up to follow. Just like cultures, each language is unique and has its particular set of features. But there are a few that share similarities either because of closeness of location or a common ancestor. In either case, the ones with similar features are placed in the same family.\n\nThere are over seven thousand languages in the world and the number will rise when we discover more communities and hidden cultures. All of these tongues are divided into families which are further subdivided into groups. There are some features in each family which are consistent throughout the groups. There are also those features which are shared by the members of one group only. In any case, studying a language family and what makes it different from other categories is pretty interesting. A lot of it may not be understandable for those who are not familiar with linguistics. Linguists, on the other hand, love to study such similarities and take joy in learning about different vernaculars."
