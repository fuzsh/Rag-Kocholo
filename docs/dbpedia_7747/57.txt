Abraham Kuyper (born October 29, 1837 in Maassluis; â€  November 8, 1920 in The Hague) was a Dutch Reformed theologian, politician and journalist. He made a significant contribution to the separation of the strict Calvinist Gereformeerde Kerken from the established Dutch Reformed Church. Kuyper was the founder of the Anti-Revolutionaire Partij (ARP) in 1879 and chairman for almost four decades, as well as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905.

Kuyper is also known for his contributions to journalism. He founded the newspaper "De Standaard", which became an important voice for Dutch Calvinists. Through his writings, he promoted ideas that significantly influenced the political and religious thought of the country.
