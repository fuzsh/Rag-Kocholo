        "text": "Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) began to develop a Reformational approach to art, his work provided a key turning point in the development of contemporary views of Calvinism and art. His view can be summarized as, art is a gift of God that shows itself in an ability, which portrays beauty that can be enjoyed by all. In this paper, I expound his view by looking primarily at his Stone Lecture on 'Calvinism and art' (1888), where he draws upon Calvin, and defends Calvinism, extracts from writings on common grace in Wisdom and Wonder (1905) and the final section of his Pro Rege (1912). I conclude that he was not fully successful in developing a Reformational aesthetic, in that he underplays the role of the antithesis in art and overemphasized the role of beauty. He tended towards a dualistic-almost neo-platonic-view of beauty. However, his nascent views provided the framework for Dooyeweerd to develop an ontology that includes the aesthetic, and Rookmaaker and Seerveld among developed his view that art is part of a cultural mandate and not merely the fringes on a theological garment.\n\nThe ground-breaking Afrofuturist film Black Panther from Marvel Studios celebrates African culture. I propose that if the Marvel Cinematic Universe, an American media franchise, can decolonize superhero motion pictures, one might hope the same concerning Western theology, including the Kuyperian tradition, despite the prejudiced views on race by its progenitor. The Black Panther, I argue, offers a dramatic portrait for decolonizing the Kuyperian tradition, not just for African saints, but for all believers. To begin, I explore the Black Panther’s backdrop and the film’s cultural significance. Next, the decolonization of the Kuyperian tradition is discussed. Considering the Black Panther as a paradigm, the paper explores how the Kuyperian tradition might be decolonized and woven together with rich African wisdom contributing towards a colorful and textured theology for the global church.\n\nThis paper examines Kuyper's view of the natural sciences. For Kuyper science is by design a unique creature of God, it flourishes within society, it grows and develops. It is part of creation, so even if there were to have been no fall, we would still have science. The fall, however, has impacted on science to an unimaginable extent. Science is independent of both church and state, thus science must be allowed to flourish unhampered by both. Science, for Kuyper, involves thinking God's thoughts after him. There are two kinds of science and two kinds of people: normalists and abnormalists-what makes the difference is regeneration or palingenesis-this is Kuyper's antithesis. Common grace is important for science without it the post-fall decline of science would be absolute. Strands of scholasticism are identified in Kuyper's approach.\n\nThe theology of Dutch pastor and politician Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) is presently experiencing something of a renaissance among English-speaking evangelicals. Such an embrace of his thought by those of disparate ecclesiological traditions, however, would come as quite a surprise to Kuyper himself. While outside of the Netherlands Kuyper is known for his notions of Christian cultural responsibility and transformation, for the Dutch his ecclesiology stands as his most important legacy. Indeed, one cannot easily extricate Kuyper’s work of church reform from his public theology, for the latter emerged from the former at key points in his career. If this is the case, that Kuyper the churchman cannot be separated from Kuyper the cultural transformationist, it leads one to wonder if Kuyper is as helpful to evangelicals outside the Reformed tradition as initially thought. This is especially so for credobaptists, whose ecclesiological differences with the Reformed tradition could not be starker, especially regarding infant baptism and a believers-only church. Upon closer inspection of Kuyper’s ecclesiology as it developed across his career, however, his thought appears surprisingly friendly to those of Baptist convictions. This essay contends that Kuyper’s developing ecclesiology, formulated in response to various ecclesiastical and political debates, bears a certain arc, the trajectory of which serves to situate him in territory which Baptists could find quite amiable to their own ecclesiology. Three phases from Kuyper’s career are examined, with an eye towards his work of reform to see churches freed from state control and composed of believers only. This trajectory maps well onto Baptist hallmarks of soul competency and regenerate church membership, leading to the conclusion that a Kuyperian inheritance for Baptist public theology need not set aside questions of the nature of the church and its relation to society. Baptists may find in Abraham Kuyper an unexpectedly friendly resource.\n\nRecent evangelical scholarship increasingly calls for ethnic theological perspectives in the American context; for just as the center of World Christianity has shifted from the West to the Majority World, the ethnic and cultural center of American evangelicalism is soon to shift – if it has not already. However, among the contextual theologies developed in the U.S., neither an explicitly Chinese American, nor a Chinese American evangelical theology have been pursued. This is surprising, given that Chinese Americans are the largest demographic of Asian Americans and that the majority of Chinese American Christians identify as evangelical. Thus, this thesis pursues a contextualized Chinese American evangelical theology. This thesis first begins by explaining the socio-historical factors behind the prevalence of conservative American evangelicalism amongst Chinese American Christians. Secondly, it identifies the most significant ill-effects of American evangelicalism amongst Chinese American Christians, and diagnoses these ill-effects as theologically rooted in anthropological uniformity, individualism vs. collectivism confusion, and a dualistic doctrine of creation. Thirdly, this thesis considers the “pent-evangelical” theology of Amos Yong as a possible path forward. However, this thesis concludes that while Yong has much to offer Chinese American evangelicals, the neo-Calvinist tradition can not only complement Yong at many points, but also bodes greater promise with less obstacles for a robust theology of ethnicity, a harmonic vision of individuals and collectives, and a holistic doctrine of creation that is still able to maintain distinctions. Hence, this thesis takes a step in the direction of a contextualized Chinese American evangelical theology that both critiques and benefits not only Chinese American evangelicals, but the broader swath of American Christians who have uncritically embraced some of the problematic assumptions found within popular and conservative American evangelical theology."
