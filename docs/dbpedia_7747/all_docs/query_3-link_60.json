        "text": "Profession: Prime Minister of the Netherlands\n\nBiography: Abraham Kuyper was Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905, during which time he was noted for his strong leadership style. He is also known for the link between his political views and his orthodox Protestant theological beliefs.\n\nKuyper was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1874, early on writing a seminal text for the Anti-Revolutionary Party. He was further noted for leaving the Dutch Reformed Church in 1886 along with a substantial following, then in 1892 this group founded the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands.\n\nTheologically, Kuyper is known for developing a form of Dutch Calvinism called neo-Calvinism and for his contribution to various theological aspects of the Calvinist worldview, in particular the principle of common grace.\n\nBorn: October 29, 1837\n\nBirthplace: Maassluis, Netherlands\n\nStar Sign: Scorpio"
