He was gone for more than four months; during which time he wrote twenty-two letters to his wife Jo (and seven children) back home. These sometimes hastily penned personal letters allowed his wife and children to share his adventures, and also his thoughts and feelings while traveling. These are typical travel letters. For Kuyper scholars and students of American history and culture these letters contain fascinating details, and for the lover of the epistolary genre and the petit histoire this publication offers the opportunity to get close to the enigmatic figure of Abraham Kuyper.\n\nCritique: Abraham Kuijper (29 October 1837 - 8 November 1920), generally known as Abraham Kuyper, was a Dutch politician, journalist, statesman and theologian. He founded the Anti-Revolutionary Party and was prime minister of the Netherlands between 1901 and 1905. Ably translated into English by Margriet Urbanus, and deftly edited by George Harinck \"Kuyper in America: This Is Where I Was Meant to Be\" offers a candid and informative perspective on Kuyper by Kuyper and is an especially recommended addition to academic library reference collections.\n\nDisplaced\n\nRussell H. Kaschula\n\nUniversity of South Africa Press\n\nc/o International Specialized Book Services\n\n920 Northeast 58th Avenue, Suite 300, Portland, OR 97213\n\nwww.isbs.com www.dalro.co.zq\n\n9781868887330, $22.00, 176pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: Russell Kaschula's delightful and provocative stories explore the complexities of living in the intercultural spaces of Southern Africa - reflections born out of his own history and experiences. Depicting a truly South African identity, these stories are told without bigotry, condescension, or political correctness. They embrace the theme of a common historical uncertainty and displacement over a period stretching back to the 1850s. Bringing together pre- and post-apartheid threads, Kaschula weaves together sometimes painful, sometimes humorous incidents of change, sorrow, fun, violence, forgiveness, innocence, identity, belonging, new directions, and interlinked destinies.\n\nCritique: This outstanding anthology is comprised of twelve thoroughly entertaining and engaging short stories: Two Teas Pleas; Pool; Valley of Voices; Initiates; Six Teaspoons of Sweetness; Divine Beginnings; N(ative) Y(ard) 47th Street; Shades of Orange; The Forgiver; Shadow; Razor Ribbon; and the title piece, Displaced. A collection of extraordinarily well crafted stories, \"Displaced\" is highly recommended for personal reading lists and community library collections.\n\nMy Husband Has Died, But That's Not The Funny Part\n\nDebra J. Blood\n\nAuthorHouse\n\n1663 Liberty Drive, Suite 200, Bloomington, IN 47403-5161\n\nwww.authorhouse.com\n\n9781481716673, $22.95, 258pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: Losing her husband Dennis unexpectedly in 2011, at the young age of 47, Debra was faced with handling grief in the only way she knew how, with strength, grace and much laughter. Debra worked through her tears by posting to her husband each day (for one year) on a social media website after his passing. She credits her \"seeing the light of day\" by sharing funny stories of their time together and walking through the pain, not alone, but with her ever growing unshakeable faith in God and the resounding love of many who have taken this journey each day with her. Through her stories, her daily blog (thehappywidow.com) and her posts she has used her distinctively unique humor, desire to honor the love of her life, and her ability to \"tell it like it is\" to inspire, lift, and encourage others in a way seldom seen. \"Losing the one you love suddenly is like being put on a roller coaster ride (and I have always hated those). You rise slowly, fall fast, hold on for dear life, and scream not so nice words that you hope those around you didn't hear. But when you get off this ride, while you may not want to buy another ticket, you are so proud of yourself for just being able to say you let go, threw your hands in the air the entire time and you indeed lived through it\" You will laugh, you will cry, at time you will pray you never personally know how she truly feels, but after you read this book that was written to her sweet husband Dennis and for her children Timothy and Sarah, you will believe that just maybe there is a way to face death and come out smiling.\n\nCritique: Written with an extraordinarily articulate candor and practical insight, \"My Husband Has Died, But That's Not The Funny Part: When Laughter and Love Overcome Grief and Loss\" is as inspired as it is inspiring. Very highly recommended and informative reading for anyone having to deal with the loss of a loved one, \"My Husband Has Died, But That's Not The Funny Part: When Laughter and Love Overcome Grief and Loss\" should be a part of every community library collection in the country.\n\nThe Jobs/Careers Shelf\n\nThe Brainiac Paradox\n\nMark Cornillie\n\nStein, Klauber & Company\n\nPO Box 15051, Detroit, MI 48230\n\nwww.steinandklauber.com\n\n9780989188500, $23.95, 352pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: There are nine factors that can significantly influence whether one's STEM career will be successful and fulfilling or not. These are the focus of \"The Brainiac Paradox\", but there is much more ... Scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians (STEM) are widely accepted to be among society's most intelligent people, and yet some struggle with something those on the other end of the cognitive spectrum may handle with ease: communication. This is the Brainiac Paradox. Communication effectiveness largely determines whether one's work is understood, approved, funded, staffed, supported, and ultimately successful. Communication challenges among STEM professionals result in frustrated careers for those directly affected, and innovation and solution opportunity costs for society as a whole. \"The Brainiac Paradox\" tackles this subject head-on, providing relevant information and actionable solutions. Essentially, it is two books in one. The first half addresses the underlying issue, answering the questions of how, why, and so what. It explores various mind sciences research that would seem to suggest congenital explanation. It also reviews environmental development factors that contribute to this phenomenon, if not the outright cause. The second half offers targeted assistance and prescriptive solutions, focusing on the nine factors author Mark Cornillie has found, based his more than 20 years of hands-on experience with this issue, to most impede the success of some STEM professionals. These solutions are provided within the framework of a methodology that will ensure lasting results. But The Brainiac Paradox is not just for STEM professionals seeking greater career success. It also has been written for those who are affected by this issue indirectly: managers, colleagues, loved ones, etc.\n\nCritique: Of special note is author Mark Cornillie's informative introduction (The Tower of Technobabel) and instructional advisory (How to Use This Book). \"The Brainiac Paradox: Solutions for the Communication Challenges of STEM Professionals\" is exceptionally well written, organized and presented. As informed and informative as it is thoughtful and thought-provoking, \"The Brainiac Paradox: Solutions for the Communication Challenges of STEM Professionals\" is an engaging (and at times challenging) read, making it very highly recommended for academic and community library collections, and the personal reading lists for anyone engaged in the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n\nThe Fiction Shelf\n\nThe Death of Davy Moss\n\nKristine Kathryn Rusch\n\nWMG Publishing\n\nPO Box 269\n\nLincoln City, OR 97367\n\n9780615862019 $15.99 www.wmgpublishing.com\n\nThe Death of Davy Moss is an original romance novel about a modern-day Elvis. Davy Moss was a pop culture sensation, until his alleged death in a terrible accident, fifteen years ago. The fans keep his memory alive, but Davy Moss himself has traded fame and fortune for the relative anonymity of his quiet new life as Josh Candless. When he crosses paths with music promoter Emily Lukovich, she recognizes his talent and wants to make him a star, unaware of his nigh-celestial past. The sparks of love begin to stir between this unlikely couple, but at what price? Davy Moss once abandoned everyone he knew; will Josh Candless do the same? Complex characters driven by multiple motivations form the halmark of this serenade, especially recommended for readers who enjoy music as surely as they do romance.\n\nHavens of Pompeii: Some Things Always Survive\n\nNicole Louw\n\niUniverse, Inc.\n\nc/o Author House\n\n1663 Liberty Dr. Suite #300, Bloomington, IN 47403\n\nwww.iuniverse.com\n\n9781462019731, $27.95, 534pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: After spending seven fruitless years training as a gladiator, Valerus Claudius Cascus returns from Rome to his hometown of Herculaneum.

Valerus finds himself drawn to the shy and withdrawn Flavia, and her ambition and dedication lead him to a new way of looking at the world and his life. As their worlds slowly intertwine-initially as friends and then as lovers-Valerus becomes blatantly aware that Flavia is first and foremost his father's slave and he can do with her as he pleases. In a heroic attempt to protect Flavia, he soon begins to work towards liberating her from her cruel fate. Unfortunately, neither Valerus nor Flavia suspect the imminent danger that lies beneath the mountain that first brought them together. In this historical tale based on real-life events, a Christian slave and a free Roman struggle to keep their love alive-even as the world erupts around them. Some things will always survive.\n\nCritique: Exceptionally well written, novelist Nicole Louw has a definite flair for creating memorial characters and crafting entertaining narratives.

Very highly recommended for personal reading lists and community library contemporary fiction collections, it should be noted that \"Recovering From Life\" is also available in a Kindle edition ($2.99).\n\nWandering West\n\nGary C. Stalcup\n\nLulu Publishing\n\n3101 Hillsborough Street, Raleigh, NC 27607-5436\n\nBohlseng Group (publicity)\n\n9781483403274, $19.99, 316pp, www.amazon.colm\n\nSynopsis: Jack Stiler's return to The Lucky Star Ranch in South Texas is bittersweet.

The region has been plagued by a drought of historic proportions, and the area surrounding his home is rife with the trafficking of drugs, guns, and desperate human beings who want nothing more than a better way of life. But Siler's return is more than a battle to save The Lucky Star from financial ruin and from the invasion of smugglers; it's a desperate attempt to defeat the demons within.

Bartow\n\nWholeness Publications\n\nPO Box 36057, Canton, OH, 44735\n\nwww.wholenesspublications.com\n\n9781893042155, $22.99, 192pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: With compelling sensitivity and tenderness, author Donald W. Bartow captures the life of Jesus from the unique perspective of His mother, Mary, the woman God chose and blessed to bring His Son to Earth. Although fiction, it is often the case that a well-researched and presented historical novel imparts more truths than a non-fiction book which may have inaccuracies due to either author bias or shoddy research. Such is the case with The Gospel According to Mary, Mother of Jesus which is scripturally sound, culturally sensitive, and in modern language. The Gospel According to Mary, Mother of Jesus is as easy to read as an entertaining suspense novel, while at the same time being as informative as a textbook. Creatively it presents the essence of the Gospel of faith, hope, and love. This engaging and insightful work - intended for young, old, believers, and unbeliever - flows tenderly from the heart of the aged mother of Jesus. Through the warmth of a mother's love sharing her heart-felt story you will discover an enhanced meaning to your life, find many helpful spiritual truths, fully grasp the message and ministry of Jesus, increase your understanding of the Bible, learn to appreciate that God can take an ordinary person and accomplish the extraordinary, be inspired to help fight the darkness of the rampant secularism in our day, experience a story as exciting as a suspense novel.\n\nCritique: Just as Jesus used short stories (called parables) to illustrate spiritual truths, so \"The Gospel According to Mary, Mother of Jesus\" is a novel length story that illustrates spiritual truths while entertaining and inspiring the reader. Offering a deftly written and biblically based narrative, \"The Gospel According to Mary, Mother of Jesus\" is very highly recommended reading and would prove to be an enduringly popular addition to community library historical fiction collections.\n\nThe Mystery/Suspense Shelf\n\nFatal Forgery\n\nSusan Grossey\n\nCreateSpace\n\n4900 LaCross Rd., North Charleston, SC 29406\n\nwww.createspace.com\n\n9781489587404, $12.49, 282pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: It is 1824, and trust in the virtual money of the day - new paper financial instruments - is so fragile that anyone forging them is sent to the scaffold.

Schaya explains in great depth and beauty how the God of Israel manifests His goodness, power, and mercy in multiple levels of creative emanations, which are the main focus of the Kabbalah. Even more, however, Schaya looks through Judaism's particular forms and demonstrates that at its core Judaism reveals the same mysterious universal source from which all of the great religious traditions of the world draw their spiritual sustenance and energy.\n\nCritique: Deftly edited by Roger Gaetani and with an informative Foreword by Patrick Laude, \"Universal Aspects of the Kabbalah and Judaism\" is enhanced with the inclusion of a glossary, a list of sources, biographical notes, and a comprehensive index.

One foundational scriptural understanding of the Pentecostal movement is that the Spirit empowers us to carry out the work of the gospel. Without a dependence on the work of the Spirit, we are mere humans. Dr. Self provides here a vivid picture of what it looks like for followers of Jesus to take the Great Commandment and the Great Commission seriously in the context of their own local communities. His concern is that our view of discipleship is lacking a clear integration of faith, work, and economics. Christians have the means to bless their local economies in unique ways that can transform coworkers and neighbors alike as Christ is glorified. This primer aims at wholehearted discipleship that extends beyond our Sundays at church and into our workplaces the rest of the week. With a strong biblical understanding of the all-encompassing nature of true discipleship as integral to the kingdom of God, combined with a unified view of church history and an appreciation for all members of the church body, Flourishing Churches and Communities presents a vision for Christians that is as beautiful as it is challenging.\n\nCritique: \"Flourishing Churches and Communities: A Pentecostal Primer on Faith, Work, and Economics for Spirit-Empowered Discipleship\" is as informed and informative, as it is inspired and inspiring, creating a truly exceptional and very highly recommended addition to personal, seminary, and academic library Christian Studies reference collections in general, and Pentacostal Christian Studies supplemental reading lists in particular.

From the phenomenon of individuals becoming \"spiritual but not religious\" to multiple religions' views on homosexuality, \"Religion Today: An Integral Approach\" uses diverse perspectives to look at how religion relates to today's society. Readers explore the thoughts and theories of psychologists, historians, experts on world religions, sociologists, social justice activists, environmentalists, feminists, experts in spirituality, evolutionists and many others in an attempt to discover a more balanced understanding of the world and be encouraged to explore their own relationship with religion through both an internal dialogue and discussions with others. Dr. Brennan Hill unveils a background on the history and basic elements of religion before diving into how religion relates to Ken Wilber's four quadrants of life: the \"I,\" the \"Thou,\" the \"We,\" and the \"It.\" From this foundation, Hill then examines the roles of spirituality, faith, and theology with regard to religion, and investigates the relationship between religion and numerous social issues that are relevant to young adults today.\n\nCritique: Written with an extraordinary clarity, accessibility, and presentation, \"Religion Today: An Integral Approach\" will prove to be an enduringly valuable contribution to personal, seminary, and academic library Christian Studies reference collections and supplemental reading lists.

Thompson\n\nCommonwealth Book Publishers of Virginia\n\nwww.thomasjeffersonenlightenment.org\n\n9780985486310 $50.00 www.amazon.com\n\nThomas Jefferson's Enlightenment: Paris 1785 is a unique, biographical portrait of American Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, focusing on a crucial turning point in his life - when he witnessed the death spiral of the French monarchy, destined to culminate in the French Revolution a few weeks before Jefferson returned home. Jefferson's time in France would chang him; he would share ideas with a circle of philosophers, and trade the idea that human history was a gradual march toward enlightenment. When he returned home to America, he would join forces with people organizing America's first political party, and continue to make his mark on history. Written in a unique style - the \"nonfiction narrative\" - Thomas Jefferson's Enlightenment: Paris 1785 tells how Jefferson adjusted his worldview through Jefferson's own words, quoted and smoothly integrated in an accessible natural flow.

Henry Reed Rathbone (1837-1911) was a Civil War veteran who had earned the rank of major at the time of President Lincoln's assassination. He and his wife agreed to attend the theater at the request of the President's wife, and he was the only man able to confront Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth. Booth managed to get away and remained at large for twelve days; Rathbone sustained severe injuries from their struggle. But Rathbone's greatest wounds were inside. Post-traumatic stress plagued him in the years that followed. He blamed himself for failing to prevent Lincoln's assassination, and became increasingly unstable and violent. His mental illness peaked in a fit of madness eighteen years later; he attacked his own children, murdered his wife when she tried to defend them, and then tried to kill himself by stabbing himself in the chest. Judged insane by German courts, he spent the remainder of his years in an asylum. Worst Seat in the House is as much a cautionary tale about the devastation of untreated mental illness as it is a window into a turning point of history from the perspective of one helplessly caught in its tide. Highly recommended.\n\nOn My Own\n\nErika Schulhof Rybeck\n\nSummit Crossroads Press\n\n9329 Angelina Circle, Columbia, MD 21045\n\n9780983404996, $17.95, 136pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: Erika Schulhof Rybeck enjoyed a magical childhood in Austria, escaped to a convent boarding school in Scotland, and started a new life in America.

At the time, interfaith relationships were frowned upon almost to the point of being forbidden; yet Bette, a 21-year-old Catholic college senior, fell in love Richard, a seventeen-year-old Jewish kid. They became engaged seven weeks later, and married two years later. Both their families (and the local clergy) objected vehemently to their relationship, trying every trick in the book to break them up. Today, when roughly 45% of all U.S. marriages are interfaith, few Americans encounter as severe an ordeal to love as Bette and Richard did, yet stories like theirs deserve to be remembered, as testimony to the long, hard road toward tolerance. Insightful, relevant, at times witty, and always absorbing, Star Crossed is highly recommended.\n\nJames A.
