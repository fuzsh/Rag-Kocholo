        "text": "Kuyper founded the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, the second largest Protestant church in the Netherlands; the Free University of Amsterdam, the Anti-Revolutionary Party, and was Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1901-1905. The home-schooled son of a minister, he earned his doctorate at age 25. An advocate of public funding of religious schools, he also was professor of Theology, and received an honorary doctorate from Princeton Seminary. He is known for the doctrine of “sphere sovereignty,” that education, government, religion, and other “spheres” are autonomous and independent. He is most known for his quote, “There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry, Mine!” Abraham Kuyper died in 1920 and is buried in the Oud Eik en Duinen Cemetery in The Hague in the Netherlands."
