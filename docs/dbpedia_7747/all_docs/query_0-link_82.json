        "text": "Dutch theologian, journalist, and statesman Abraham Kuyper is commonly cited as an authoritative figure with regard to Christianity and politics. His example as a theologically sophisticated and politically active Christian is widely lauded and celebrated. However, his thought and impact have been rarely considered from the perspective of political theory, and his contribution to the field has largely been overlooked. There are notable exceptions to this, and some of these will be cited in this paper. None the less, due to this lack of theoretical clarity in political studies on Kuyper himself, this paper aims to provide a clearer vision of the theoretical basis of Kuyper's political thought. It will be shown that his political thought can be located in the broad streams of pluralism and Calvinism. We will first survey pluralist political thought, and then survey Calvinist political thought, focusing on John Calvin and Johannes Althusius. These surveys will lead to Dutch Calvinism and Abraham Kuyper's doctrine of sphere sovereignty. This core Kuyperian doctrine will be expounded, and will be shown to be an expression of Calvinist pluralism, thereby locating Abraham Kuyper's political theory within that stream.\n\nAs a theoretical thinker, Kuyper did not surpass his contemporaries. A Free University professor stated at the burial of Abraham Kuyper in November 1920, that it was understandable that Kuyper, unlike his Dutch co-theologian Herman Bavinck, never was elected a member of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences. He said: “For the official academic world Kuyper has been more an object of study than a subject.… He was never taken seriously as an academic.” How doubtful this rather critical judgment may seem to us, it does not stand alone. In the 1930s the Dutch Reformed philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd made it clear that, though Abraham Kuyper was crowned with the most extraordinary gifts, he certainly had some blind spots. And the Reformed theologian Klaas Schilder was right, too, when he observed in 1947 that Abraham Kuyper, the theologian, often had had to make place for Kuyper the tactical general. In the Netherlands of the 1930s and 1940s, Abraham Kuyper’s theories were certainly not gene...\n\nAbraham Kuyper was a theologian, statesman, journalist, church reformer, church historian, church pastor, founder of a Christian university and a Christian political party, and one-time prime minister of the Netherlands. He was a Reformed Christian whose writings have shaped a movement known as neo-Calvinism. Yet he is little known in the UK. In this article, I examine several key themes that shaped Kuyper's approach to theology, culture and society. These include the sovereignty of God, the cultural mandate, the role of worldviews, common grace, the antithesis, and sphere sovereignty. These themes provided the theoretical framework for Kuyper's neo-Calvinism. I look at how they shaped his approach to church, politics, education, art and mission.\n\nThis article offers a concise exposition of the ecclesiology of Abraham Kuyper. Focusing extensively on Kuyper’s doctrines of the church as both institute and organism as well as on ecclesiological pluriformity, the enduring relevance of Kuyper’s vision is shown for our present context, both in the Netherlands and the United States. Contrary to neo-Calvinist critiques of the twentieth century, the term institute is just as contextually bound as organism—yet this does not negate the usefulness of either concept. Rather, it is the task of the church to adapt itself to the concrete circumstances of each place and age, even employing ideas from each context as appropriate. With reservations regarding his neglect of the liturgical character of the church, Kuyper’s distinctions are expounded and set forward as helpful ecclesiological guidelines for modern Christian social witness today. Ad de Bruijne, &quot;&#39;Colony of Heaven&#39;: Abraham Kuyper&#39;s Ecclesiology in the Twenty-First ...\n\nPolitical movement and responsibility is a present day opinion of some Evangelicals, and it is not new. Once they thought that Church should not involved in Politics, now the notion has been shifted towards, and saying that the Church should involve in politics. In the early 19th century Abraham Kuyper wants to combine Calvinism principles with politics and he did succeeded for some extent as a Dutch theologian and a politician and even he became the president of the Netherlands with what he believed for. This paper will focus the Kuyper’s lecture of ‘Calvinism a life system’ and his life.\n\nThe figure of Abraham Kuyper looms large over the political and social landscape of nineteenth and twentieth century Holland. He held significant posts in government, education, and the church. His social theory impacted Dutch society for much of the twentieth century. His influence on both continental and American Christian political thought is substantial. And yet, Kuyper’s legacy is largely understated, and his political thought unknown in many corners of the scholarly world. This paper seeks to address this by surveying some of the major aspects of Kuyper’s political thought while placing him in his historical setting. By doing so, it will be shown that Abraham Kuyper is a transitory figure in political history, occupying an important place in the development of the relationship between religion and the modern state.\n\nThis article explores Abraham Kuyper’s spirituality by comparing it to that of John Calvin. Calvin’s Institutes exhibits three dimensions of his spirituality in the context of the mystical union with Christ, namely, the affective character of this union, its effects and its significance for a correct estimation of the world. By comparison, Kuyper put a greater emphasis on the importance of the affections in mystical union because he gives more weight to the regenerated life. This focus also coheres with Kuyper’s more optimistic approach to the Christian life, which contrasts with Calvin’s emphasis on the need for daily justification. In Kuyper’s approach the indwelling of the Spirit represents the union between heaven and earth, while Calvin stresses that God’s future kingdom is beyond the here and now."
