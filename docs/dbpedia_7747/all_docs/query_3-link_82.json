        "text": "He was born on October 29, 1837 in Holland. He died on November 8, 1920 at the age of 93.\n\nHis parents believed – as a child – that Abraham might have had hydrocephalus (water on the brain) because his head was unusually large. Doctors said nothing was wrong with him.\n\nHe became a Christian while writing a dissertation against the teachings of John Calvin.\n\nKuyper helped establish The Free University of Amsterdam in 1880, which was a school founded on the Reformed tradition.\n\nProbably Kuyper’s most famous quote: “There is not one part of our world of thought that can be hermetically separated from the other parts, and there is not an inch in the entire area of our human life of which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry, ‘Mine!’”\n\nPrinceton University conferred upon him an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws on October 22, 1898, at the age of 61.\n\nAs the leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party, he was elected Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1901-1905. He thought of politics as a sacred calling.\n\nKuyper was not just a pastor theologian. Others have called him an entrepreneur, a politician, a statesman, a journalist, a professor, and a political organizer."
