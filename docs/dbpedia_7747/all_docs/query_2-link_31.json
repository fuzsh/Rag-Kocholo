        "text": "The Works of Abraham Kuyper\n\nAbraham Kuyper was one of the most extraordinary individuals of his time: the founder of a political party, a university, and a Reformed denomination, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, and an incredibly prolific author on a dizzying array of subjects. A resurgence of interest in Kuyper, his life, and his writings is taking hold as Christians search for ways to faithfully understand and engage culture.\n\nAbraham Kuyper (1837–1920) was a prolific intellectual and theologian, he founded the Free University in Amsterdam and was instrumental in the development of Neo-Calvinism. He was also an active politician, serving as a member of Parliament in the Netherlands beginning in 1874 and serving as Prime Minister from 1901 to 1905. At this intersection of church and state, he devoted much of his writing towards developing a public theology. His passion was to faithfully understand and engage culture through a Christian worldview. The most famous example is his articulation of the doctrine of common grace. His work has influenced countless others, including Francis Schaeffer, Cornelius Van Til, and Alvin Plantinga.\n\nThe 28-volume Abraham Kuyper Comprehensive Studies Collection contains many of Kuyper’s writings on public theolgy, the doctrine of the Reformed church, and Calvinism. You’ll also find biographies on Kuyper and essays inspired by his life and works. The Abraham Kuyper Comprehensive Studies Collection is a must-have for pastors and teachers, and anyone interested in studying one of the most influential Reformed theologians of the modern era."
