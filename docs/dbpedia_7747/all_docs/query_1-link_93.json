        "text": "Lived Theology\n\nWritten by Michael Wagenman\n\nChrist declares \"Mine!\" over every square inch of creation.\n\nIn his well--known quote, Abraham Kuyper expressed the defining characteristic of his public theology: Jesus' sovereignty extends over all things. He believed Christians should engage the whole world in all of its various spheres. But what does that comprehensive calling practically look like for us today?\n\nIn Engaging the World with Abraham Kuyper, Michael Wagenman explores the practical application of Kuyper's public theology. Using Kuyper's own life as an example, he shows us how the gospel can permeate all aspects of society: our identity, public discourse, education, the church, politics. Ultimately, this means engaging the world with perceptive truth that's mindful of the dynamics at work in our time and place.\n\nPaperback, 166 pages, notes, bibliography, General Index, Scripture Index"
