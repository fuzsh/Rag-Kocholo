        "text": "Abraham Kuyper is no longer held in high esteem in the Reformed churches. In his day—some 100 years ago—he bestrode the Netherlands like a colossus. He cast a long shadow across much of the Reformed world. That shadow lingered for many years. But today Kuyper the Reformed theologian is rejected, if not despised.\n\nThere are still theologians and churches that honor Kuyper the theoretician of a Christian culture, the man of social action, and the successful politician. But no one speaks out in appreciation of Kuyper the Reformed theologian. When his name comes up (as it does this year of the 100th anniversary of his lectures on Calvinism at Princeton Seminary), it is to honor him as a champion of cultural influence and dominion.\n\nThe Reformed world acknowledge Abraham Kuyper, if they acknowledge him at all, as the philosopher of common grace. About Kuyper the Reformed theologian they are silent. For them Kuyper is the man of only two books: Lectures on Calvinism and De Gemeene Gratie (Common Grace).\n\nThis is a perennial perversity in the church. Luther noted it in his controversy with Erasmus. Men are eager to collect all the dung that they can find in the fathers, while carefully overlooking the gold. Luther was commenting on Erasmus’ examination of the church fathers to gather many quotations favoring the free will of the sinner, while ignoring their statements on the enslaved will.\n\nWith this article I honor Abraham Kuyper as a Reformed theologian. His theology, although imperfect, was solid, sound, biblical, and creedal Reformed doctrine. By this theology and on behalf of this theology, Kuyper reformed the church of Christ in the Netherlands at the end of the 19th century. In its fundamentals it was the gospel.\n\nThe Protestant Reformed Churches (PRC) are indebted to Kuyper the theologian. We might speak of him as “father” Abraham in acknowledgment of the use that Jesus Christ made of him in giving existence and life to these churches.\n\nThe indebtedness of the PRC to Kuyper is a fact of history. The founding members of the PRC were men and women who were put out of the Christian Reformed Church (CRC). Many members of the CRC were Dutch immigrants who had left the apostate national church in the reformation of 1886, the “Doleantie.” Kuyper was the leading reformer. Many members of the PRC today are direct descendants of men and women who were delivered from the darkness of Arminianism and modernism into the light of the Reformed faith by means of Abraham Kuyper.\n\nSome years ago I myself stood before a small, red-brick church building in Joure, Friesland. The church belongs to the denomination founded by Kuyper. In this church my paternal grandfather was baptized and then reared until as a young man he emigrated to the United States where he joined the Hope CRC of Grandville in Western Michigan. I thanked God for “father” Abraham on behalf of myself and my own family.\n\nThe debt that the PRC owe to Kuyper as a servant of Christ is doctrinal. Because doctrine is the main thing for the church, the debt of the PRC to Kuyper is great.\n\nThe members of the PRC themselves may not be aware of their doctrinal indebtedness to Kuyper. Usually Kuyper’s name comes up among us as a father of common grace, which teaching we repudiate as erroneous. In addition, Herman Hoeksema seldom indicated his own dependency on the theology of Kuyper. He almost never quoted Kuyper with approval. The many references to Kuyper are critical.\n\nThis is unfortunate and misleading. Although Hoeksema corrected, developed, and put his own stamp on the theology of Kuyper, the theology of Hoeksema is essentially that of Kuyper. As Kuyper faithfully confessed and developed the theology of Calvin and the Reformed tradition, on the basis of the confessions, so Hoeksema received and worked with the tradition as it came to him in large part through Kuyper.\n\nHerman Hoeksema was heavily influenced by the theology of Abraham Kuyper.\n\nEarly in his ministry Hoeksema readily acknowledged this influence. In the foreword of Van Zonde en Genade (Concerning Sin and Grace), co-authored with H. Danhof in the heat of the common grace controversy, Hoeksema wrote: “The great Netherlands leader (Abraham Kuyper) has written much with which we heartily agree. When we read his Dat de Genade Particulier is (That Grace is Particular) , we feel ourselves thoroughly one with him” (p. 9; this and all other quotations from Dutch titles in the editorial are my translation).\n\nIn 1930, in an article in the Standard Bearer on “Dr. Abraham Kuyper and Common Grace,” Hoeksema spoke highly of Kuyper and his theology:\n\nAlthough we refuse to worship him or to make him the court of last appeal in Reformed theology, as is often done … and although it is our conviction that he departed from the line of Reformed thinking in his development of the theory of Common Grace; yet, it must not be forgotten that he was instrumental to a great extent in the restoration of Reformed theology (SB 6, no. 13 [April 1, 1930]: 304).\n\nWhat, in briefest summary, is the theology of Kuyper that has come to the PRC by way of Herman Hoeksema?\n\nFirst, there is the heartfelt conviction (on which everything is staked) that sound doctrine is necessary and primary for the church; that this doctrine is the historic, confessional Reformed truth; that this doctrine is God-centered; and that this doctrine is a system. Herman Bavinck described Kuyper’s theology this way:\n\nAvoiding all Apologetics, Dr. Kuyper proceeded in a thetical manner. He chose his standpoint not on the outside but within faith, planted himself squarely on the basis of the infallible Scriptures and the Reformed Confession…. While thus embracing the Reformed doctrine he revives the same in its most strict type. To him the line marked by the names of Calvin, Voetius, Comrie represents Reformed theology in its most correct development. For it is characteristic of the Reformed doctrine, that it deduces all things from God and makes all things return to God. Hence Dr. Kuyper is not satisfied until every dogma has been traced to its deepest roots and set forth in its inner connection with the divine decree…. The various Reformed doctrines are to him … one world of ideas, one strictly coherent system (cited in L. Praamsma, Let Christ be King: Reflections on the Life and Times of Abraham Kuyper, Paideia, 1985, pp. 114, 115).\n\nSecond, at its heart this theology is the confession that the grace of God in Jesus Christ is sovereign and particular. The theology of Kuyper (in distinction from his philosophy) is found in his Dat de Genade Particulier is; his commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism (E Voto Dordraceno); De Leer der Verbonden (The Doctrine of the Covenants); and the Dictaten Dogmatiek (Kuyper’s dogmatics lectures at the Free University).\n\nDat de Genade Particulier is (Kruyt, 1884) is a grand, moving defense of particular, sovereign grace against the heresy of a universal, ineffectual grace of God in Jesus Christ and His gospel. Kuyper began by explaining the three main texts that open and secret Arminians always raise against particular grace: I John 2:2; I Timothy 2:4; and II Peter 3:9. All have the elect, and the elect only, in view. Mentioning that his own colleagues in the national church cursed him from the pulpit for teaching it, Kuyper insisted that Christ died only for the elect. He also taught that God’s grace in the gospel is intended for and directed to the elect alone. God desires the salvation of the elect only.\n\nKuyper taught eternal, unconditional election accompanied by eternal, unconditional reprobation. In his De Leer der Verbonden, he asserted that one who refuses to confess reprobation thereby refuses to confess biblical election: “Election is always accompanied by its dark shadow. Without confessing reprobation, you also do not confess election. To suppose that you could be able to have the one without the other is playing with words” (in Uit het Woord, vol. 2, Kruyt, 1885, p. 320).\n\nFor Kuyper the order of the eternal decrees is supralapsarian. This order, he thought, was more biblical, as well as more glorifying to God.\n\nThe actual saving of the elect sinner is the sovereign work of God alone apart from any cooperating activity on the part of the sinner. This was Kuyper’s doctrine of immediate regeneration. Only the teaching that the Spirit regenerates without the means of the preached Word explains the regeneration—and salvation—of elect infant children of believing parents. But this teaching also safeguards the graciousness of regeneration: the new birth is not at all the work of the sinner himself, is not at all a change dependent on the sinner’s faith.\n\nFor his confession of God’s sovereignty in salvation, Kuyper was “accused . . . of hyper-Calvinism” (Praamsma, Let Christ be King, p. 91). Within the Reformed community, this charge is final confirmation that one is, in fact, teaching the gospel of grace (see Rom. 9:19, 20). As is always the case, the slander came, not from avowed enemies of the Reformed faith but from Reformed ministers.\n\nA third vital area of biblical truth in which the PRC have been significantly influenced by Abraham Kuyper is the doctrine of the covenant. In the book, De Leer der Verbonden, Kuyper traced the covenant of grace to the triune being of God, thus suggesting that the covenant is a relationship of love and life. On the basis of Romans 5:12ff., Kuyper established that Jesus Christ is head of the covenant of grace, as Adam was head of the covenant of creation in Paradise. Christ, Kuyper stated, is “Head of the covenant of grace” (p. 197).\n\nChrist’s headship of the covenant implies that the covenant of grace is established only with the elect. This follows also from the close relationship between election and the covenant. Election and covenant are not “two (opposite) poles that exclude each other. Rather the covenant of grace is the glorious bed through which the water of life flows to us from the depths of election.”\n\nKuyper vehemently rejected the notion that the covenant differs from election by including the reprobate: The covenant of grace “aims only and exclusively at the elect. No one is a member in that covenant other than the one who receives or has been appointed to grace. The rich, glorious promises that God the Lord has included in His covenant of grace are absolutely not offered upon an uncertain chance, but are applied to the elect children of the inheritance in the light.”\n\nTo say that in Baptism, according to the Form of Baptism, the promises of eternal salvation are given, personally and essentially, to every baptized child, head for head, is nothing other than a destruction (vernietigen), by Arminian poison, of the rich life that fragrantly wafts to you from this formula (pp. 320-326).\n\nThis is familiar language to every Protestant Reformed Christian, though he or she may never have read a word of Kuyper.\n\nIn 1924, the CRC officially committed itself to the philosophy of Abraham Kuyper: the culture-forming, world-conforming theory of common grace. In the person of Herman Hoeksema, it banished the theology of Kuyper. This theology now finds a home in the PRC. And hardly anywhere else.\n\nSpace would fail me to tell of Kuyper’s defense of the antithesis and of his recovery of the autonomy of the local congregation.\n\nWhat a theology!\n\nThis is our debt!\n\nThank God for Abraham Kuyper the theologian and reformer of the church!\n\n—DJE"
