This old piece of concrete pipe was originally used to transport water from Sooke all the way to Victoria, about 38km (23 miles) away. While you can’t ride the entire thing, there’s a decent bit of fun to be had if you’re a daredevil, and NOBL athlete and local freeride legend Dean Tennant is definitely brave enough to ride it."
