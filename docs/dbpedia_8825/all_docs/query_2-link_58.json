        "text": "When working with a forklift, it is important to recognize and be aware of the fall quarter. This is the area around the forklift where materials can potentially fall during loading and unloading, or where the forklift itself should tip over.\n\nTo outline the fall zone, remember the radius of the device’s movement, which is the entire distance from the forklift’s center out. This may vary depending on the scale and shape of the forklift used. In addition, you must not forget about any feasible sudden movements, such as unexpected stops or adjustments of the course.\n\nBefore starting any operation, marking and securing the fall zone is crucial. This can be done by using barriers, cones, or signs to indicate the zone’s boundaries and ensure that people and equipment stay clear.\n\nHere’s Why?\n\nBefore operating a forklift, defining and securing the fall zone is crucial to avoid unintentional injuries. This involves identifying where the forklift will operate and marking it off so that employees and observers know where it is safe to stand. It is also essential to train employees on the fall zone and forklift operation to understand the risks and the precautions they must take.\n\nEmployees and bystanders should never stand or pass under a raised load to maintain a safe working environment. They should also respect the identified forklift fall zone and take immediate action if they see anyone violating the safety precautions. Following these guidelines ensures that your forklift operation is safe, efficient, and accident-free. . So, taking these precautions can help prevent accidents and ensure a safe working environment for all involved."
