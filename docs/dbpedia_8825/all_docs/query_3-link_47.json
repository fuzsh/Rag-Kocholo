        "text": "If the slide is less than 4 feet in height, draw a perimeter marking around the slide by joining the markings made 6 feet from the edge of the equipment. The area enclosed by this perimeter is the fall zone for small slides. For slides that are higher than 4 feet, measure the height of the slide at the platform found at the top of the steps and the top of the sliding surface. Add 4 feet to the platform height to obtain the distance which the fall zone should extend beyond the foot of the slide. For the remainder of the fall zone, excluding the foot of the sliding surface, the zone perimeter must be 6 feet from the slide sides and the access steps."
