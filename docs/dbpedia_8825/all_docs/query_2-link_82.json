        "text": "The Piedmont encompasses the area in the center of the state defined as the foothills and holds many of North Carolinaâ€™s large cities. Piedmont archaeological sites range from plantations and homesteads to historic cemeteries to battlefields and pre-contact occupation sites.\n\nArchaeological sites in this region face threats from changes in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events. Being in the middle of the state, the impacts of these threats tend to mimic those in the mountains and Coastal Plain. Changes in temperature and precipitation lead to increased plant growth on archaeological sites. For example, both the Adam Spach House in Davidson County and sites at Falls Lake in the Raleigh/Durham area have seen increased plant growth over time. This growth can destabilize archaeological sites as roots push through walls and moss corrodes the structures.\n\nHeavy rains and extreme weather events including tornados and tropical cyclones contribute to pooling water, unstable grounds, and wind damage. The combination of these impacts lead to the overturning of trees and the disturbance of the ground. Tree roots can upheave buried archaeological sites and falling limbs may damage exposed and buried structures. For example, at cemetery sites, such as the one pictured from Warren County, this can disturb tombstones and burials through both root upheaval and tree collapse."
