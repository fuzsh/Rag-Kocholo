        "text": "If you’ve been looking at our No Fault website (and if you have, WELCOME!) you may have noticed that each of our playground safety surface products (such as Poured-In-Place (PIP), Loose Rubber Mulch, Bonded Rubber Mulch, and Safety Tiles) have “critical fall heights” associated with them.\n\n“Critical fall height” is the height at which a critical injury can occur. It is based on the “highest designated play area,” or the height of the highest piece of equipment that a child can stand on during normal play.\n\nWhat’s the purpose? Each year, over 200,000 children are injured in playground falls, and most can be prevented by installing a shock-absorbing surface. An industry standard called American Standard Testing Methods (ASTM) sets the requirements for manufacturers like No Fault, and we take these requirements seriously.\n\nThe term “critical fall height” is a combination of fall height and critical height. In this post, we define each of those terms and explain their importance.\n\nWhat is Fall Height?\n\nAccording to ASTM, fall height is defined as the “vertical distance between a designated play surface and the protective surfacing beneath it.”\n\nFall heights vary according to the types of equipment used on the playground. For example, the fall height of climbing equipment, such as a jungle gym will differ from that of a swing set.\n\nHere is a list of fall height measurement criteria for various types of playground equipment:\n\nClimbing equipment – highest part of the climber intended for foot support;\n\nUpper body equipment – highest part of the equipment;\n\nSwing sets – the pivot point;\n\nSeesaws – maximum height attainable by the seat;\n\nSpring rockers – height of the seat;\n\nComposite equipment (where components are connected) – distance from the highest designated play surface to the protective surface.\n\nView Safety Surfacing\n\nWhat is Critical Height?\n\nCritical height correlates with the impact attenuation, or shock absorbency, of the surface material. Its purpose is to “approximate the maximum fall height that would not result in a life threatening head injury,” according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nDepending on the playground surface material being used, critical height measurements vary. For instance, with rubber mulch, if the playground equipment fall height is eight feet, the critical fall height must attain a depth of six inches. If poured-in-place rubber surface is used as a protective safety surface, a depth of 3.5 inches must be achieved.\n\nHow Is Critical Fall Height Tested?\n\nCritical fall heights are determined by testing methods that evaluate the shock absorbing properties of the playground surfacing material. This can be laboratory testing or testing in the “fall zone” at the actual play area.\n\nTesters drop an instrumented metal “head-form” onto a sample of the playground surfacing material and record how fast and hard it hits the material. A “head form” is a head-shaped device which has a built-in device for measuring acceleration. The test is repeated from varying heights. These heights determine the thickness of each system needed for protection.\n\nWhen it comes to installation, you must take into consideration both the depth of safety surfacing and the area of surfacing needed. The surfacing should extend beyond the edge of equipment use area, especially where kids can fall away from the equipment (tumbling out of a swing set seat, for example).\n\nAlso, different play equipment will have different fall heights—your equipment manufacturer can tell you what the rating is for each item.\n\nNo Fault Safety Surfacing is ASTM Compliant\n\nThe use of surfacing materials that have the proper resiliency and impact attenuation is one of the most important factors in reducing injuries from falls."
