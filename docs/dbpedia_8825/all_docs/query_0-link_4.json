        "text": "Escarpment in the Eastern United States\n\nThe Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line, or Fall Zone, is a 900-mile (1,400 km) escarpment where the Piedmont and Atlantic coastal plain meet in the eastern United States.[2] Much of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line passes through areas where no evidence of faulting is present.\n\nThe fall line marks the geologic boundary of hard metamorphosed terrain—the product of the Taconic orogeny—and the sandy, relatively flat alluvial plain of the upper continental shelf, formed of unconsolidated Cretaceous and Cenozoic sediments. Examples of Fall Zone features include the Potomac River's Little Falls and the rapids in Richmond, Virginia, where the James River falls across a series of rapids down to its own tidal estuary.\n\nBefore navigation improvements such as locks, the fall line was generally the head of navigation on rivers due to their rapids or waterfalls, and the necessary portage around them. Numerous cities initially formed along the fall line because of the easy river transportation to seaports, as well the availability of water power to operate mills and factories, thus bringing together river traffic and industrial labor. U.S. Route 1 and I-95 link many of the fall-line cities.\n\nIn 1808, Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin noted the significance of the fall line as an obstacle to improved national communication and commerce between the Atlantic seaboard and the western river systems:[3]\n\nThe most prominent, though not perhaps the most insuperable obstacle in the navigation of the Atlantic rivers, consists in their lower falls, which are ascribed to a presumed continuous granite ridge, rising about one hundred and thirty feet above tide water. That ridge from New York to James River inclusively arrests the ascent of the tide; the falls of every river within that space being precisely at the head of the tide; pursuing thence southwardly a direction nearly parallel to the mountains, it recedes from the sea, leaving in each southern river an extent of good navigation between the tide and the falls. Other falls of less magnitude are found at the gaps of the Blue Ridge, through which the rivers have forced their passage...\n\nNotable cities\n\n[edit]\n\nSome cities that lie along the Piedmont–Coastal Plain fall line include the following (from north to south):\n\nNew Brunswick, New Jersey on the Raritan River\n\nPrinceton, New Jersey, on the Millstone River\n\nTrenton, New Jersey, on the Delaware River.[2]\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, on the Schuylkill River.[4]\n\nWilmington, Delaware, on the Brandywine River.\n\nPerryville, Maryland, and Havre de Grace, Maryland, on the Susquehanna River/head of Chesapeake Bay.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland, on Herring Run, Jones Falls, and Gwynns Falls.[5]\n\nElkridge, Maryland, on the Patapsco River.[citation needed]\n\nLaurel, Maryland, on the Patuxent River.[citation needed]\n\nWashington, D.C., on the Potomac River.[6]\n\nOccoquan, Virginia, on the Occoquan River.[citation needed]\n\nFredericksburg, Virginia on the Rappahannock River.[6]\n\nRichmond, Virginia, on the James River.[7]\n\nPetersburg, Virginia, on the Appomattox River.[8]\n\nWeldon, North Carolina, and Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, on the Roanoke River[9]\n\nRocky Mount, North Carolina, on the Tar River.[9]\n\nKinston, Smithfield, and Goldsboro, North Carolina, on the Neuse River.[9]\n\nFayetteville, North Carolina, on the Cape Fear River.[9]\n\nLumberton, North Carolina, on the Lumber River.[9]\n\nCheraw, South Carolina, on the Pee Dee River.[citation needed]\n\nCamden, South Carolina, on the Wateree River.[citation needed]\n\nColumbia, South Carolina, on the Congaree River.[7]\n\nAugusta, Georgia, on the Savannah River.[10]\n\nMilledgeville, Georgia, on the Oconee River.[10]\n\nMacon, Georgia, on the Ocmulgee River.[10]\n\nColumbus, Georgia, on the Chattahoochee River.[2]\n\nTallassee, Alabama, on the Tallapoosa River[11]\n\nWetumpka, Alabama, on the Coosa River[11]\n\nTuscaloosa, Alabama, on the Black Warrior River[11]\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n[edit]\n\nAtlantic Seaboard fall line, north-to-south State Point (crossing) Elevation & coordinates Fall zone:\n\ndrop/width (slope) Geomorphology\n\nPiedmont—Coastal plain New Jersey New Brunswick (Raritan River) 460 ft (140 m) Trenton (Delaware River) 8 ft Pennsylvania Philadelphia (Schuylkill River by I-76) Delaware Wilmington (Brandywine Creek) Delaware Newark (White Clay Creek) Maryland Conowingo Dam (Susquehanna) Ellicott City[12] (Patapsco) [1] Crystalline rock—unconsolidate marine sediments[13] Little Falls (Potomac River) Washington, DC Theodore Roosevelt Island (Potomac River) Virginia Fredericksburg (Rappahannock) [2] [west of Interstate 95 bridge][14] Emporia (Meherrin River)[15]"
