        "text": "Foliage Report for October 18, 2023\n\nFinal Foliage Report: Peak Conditions Approaching the Immediate Coast\n\n(AUGUSTA, Maine) - The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) final Foliage reportfor October 18 indicates peak and past peak conditions throughout most of the state. Peak conditions are approaching the coast in zone one with high leaf drop (more than 70 percent).\n\nThis Weeks Foliage Outlook\n\n\"This foliage season was a tricky one to forecast. While we had color because trees do what they need to do to prepare for their long winter nap, the colors were muted in some areas and breathtaking in others. Our rainy, wind-swept weather played a significant role,\" said Gale Ross, fall foliage spokesperson.\n\nWhile the weather might not be conducive to long road trips and leaf peeping this upcoming weekend, there are dozens of fun-filled activities taking place statewide. For those who are adventurous and still want to catch a glimpse of the fall colors, a hike in and around the blueberry barrens in DownEast Maine is a must-see. Barrens ablaze with the fall colors never disappoint! As we close the books on another fall foliage season, let's give a hearty shout-out and thank you to all our leaf lovers and everyone who shared their memorable fall foliage photos with us, added Ross.\n\nAs foliage season across Maine will soon come to a close, there is still a chance to enjoy seasonal events, activities and road trip ideas:\n\nHead to the Maine Beaches region of the state this weekend for pops of color along the coast. OgunquitFest is taking place this Friday through Sunday with the classic car show, artisan craft fair, the DogtoberFest costume parade, hot air balloon rides, children's activities and other Halloween-themed fun. If the weather cooperates while in Ogunquit, walk along Marginal Way, a one-mile paved coastal path winding along the coastline with unbeatable panoramic views leading to Perkins Cove.\n\nFor other ways to enjoy a foliage-filled road trip this weekend, visit Boothbay's Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens during their last weekend of the season.\n\nLater this month as we near Halloween and November, other annual events will continue throughout the season, like Harvest on the Harbor, October 25-28, providing unique food and beverage-focused events.\n\nNearing the end of harvest season, this is also the ideal time to stop by a farm stand for in-season agricultural products.\n\nFoliage season enthusiasts can visit the states official foliage website to receive weekly reports by email. Everyone is invited to share color progression photos from throughout Maine. The Maine Fall Foliage Facebook and Instagram accounts feature gorgeous images and special activities statewide.
