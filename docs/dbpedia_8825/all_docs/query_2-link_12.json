Manufacturer: Surface America, Inc.\n\n1. Contact: PO Box 157, Williamsville, NY 14231; Telephone: (800) 999-0555, (716) 632-8413; Fax: (716) 632-8324; E-mail: info@surfaceamerica.com; website: http://www.surfaceamerica.com.\n\nB. Proprietary Products/Systems. Poured-in-place playground surfacing system, including the following:\n\n1. PlayBound Poured-In-Place Primer:\n\na. Material: Urethane.\n\n2. PlayBound Poured-in-Place Basemat:\n\na. Material: Blend of 100% recycled SBR (styrene butadiene rubber) and urethane.\n\nSpecifier Note: The type of playground equipment determines the required basemat thickness, and the basemat thickness may be different at various locations on the playground site. Depending on ASTM F1292 requirements for critical fall height (4’, 5’, 6’, 7’, 8’, 9’, 10’, 12’ or 13’ (1219, 1524, 1829, 2134, 2438, 2743, 3048, 3657 or 3962 mm), select basemat thickness from options provided in subparagraph below (1 1/4 “, 2”, 2 1/2″, 2 1/2″, 3”, 3 1/2″, 4″, 4 1/2”, 5″ or 6″ (32, 51, 63, 63, 76, 89, 102, 114, 127 or 152 mm, respectively). Specify project requirements below and coordinate with working drawings.\n\nb. Thickness: [1 1/4″ (31.75 mm) for 4’ critical fall height] [2″ (51 mm) for 5’ critical fall height] [2 1/2” (64 mm) for 6’ and 7’ critical fall heights] [3″ (76 mm) for 8’ critical fall height] [3 1/2″ (89 mm) for 9’ critical fall height] [4″ (102 mm) for 10’ critical fall height] [5″ (127 mm) for 12’ critical fall height] [6″ (152 mm) for 13’ critical fall height].\n\nc. Formulation Components: Blend of strand and granular material.\n\n3. PlayBound Poured-In-Place Top Surface:\n\na. Material: Blend of Virgin EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) rubber or TPV Granule and aromatic or aliphatic urethane binder.\n\nb. Thickness: Nominal 1/2″ (12.7 mm), minimum 3/8″ (9.5 mm), maximum 5/8” (15.9 mm).\n\nc. Color: [Standard] [Terra Cotta Red] [Primary Red] [Orange] [Gold] [Beige] [Yellow] [Bright Green] [Hunter Green] [Teal] [Sky Blue] [Royal Blue] [Purple] [Pearl] [Eggshell] [Brown] [Light Gray] [Dark Gray] [Black] [Custom color – specify requirements].\n\nSpecifier Note: Aliphatic urethane (Extreme-10) is recommended for certain colors (blue, teal, purple, pearl, eggshell and grays) because aromatic binder (Super-7) “yellows” slightly upon exposure to ultraviolet rays. Most of this thin layer of urethane wears off with foot traffic and weathering typically within two to six months. This characteristic applies industry-wide.\n\nd. Dry Static Coefficient of Friction (ASTM D2047): 1.0.\n\ne. Wet Static Coefficient of Friction (ASTM D2047): 0.9.\n\nf. Dry Skid Resistance (ASTM E303): 89.\n\ng.

Add text to refer to Division 1 Project Requirements (Product Substitutions Procedures) Section.\n\n2.02 PRODUCT SUBSTITUTIONS\n\nA. Substitutions: No substitutions permitted.\n\nSpecifier Note: Specify proportions and procedures for site mixing materials. Mixing is the preparation of materials for use and is considered to be part of the manufacturing process.\n\n2.03 MIXES\n\nA. Required mix proportions by weight:\n\n1. Basemat: 16+% urethane (as ratio: 14% urethane divided by 86% rubber). 14% urethane, 86% rubber (based on entire rubber & urethane mix).\n\n2. Top Surface: 22% urethane (ratio: 18% urethane divided by 82% rubber). 18% urethane, 82% rubber (based on entire rubber & urethane mix).\n\nPART 3 – EXECUTION\n\nSpecifier Note: Revise article below to suit project requirements and specifier’s practice.\n\n3.01 MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nA. Comply with the instructions and recommendations of the playground surfacing manufacturer.\n\nSpecifier Note: Specify actions to physically determine that conditions are acceptable to receive primary products of the section.\n\n3.02 EXAMINATION\n\nA.

Proper drainage is critical to the longevity of the PlayBound Poured-in-Place surfacing system. Inadequate drainage will cause premature breakdown of the poured system in affected areas; and void the warranty.\n\nSpecifier Note: Specify actions required to physically prepare the surface, area, or site or to incorporate the primary products of the section.\n\n3.03 PREPARATION\n\nA. Surface Preparation: Using a brush or short nap roller, apply primer to the substrate perimeter and any adjacent vertical barriers such as playground equipment support legs, curbs or slabs that will contact the surfacing system at the rate of 300 ft2/gal (7.5 m2/L).\n\nSpecifier Note: Coordinate article below with manufacturer’s recommended installation requirements.\n\n3.04 INSTALLATION\n\nA. Do not proceed with playground surfacing installation until all applicable site work, including substrate preparation, fencing, playground equipment installation and other relevant work, has been completed.\n\nB. Basemat Installation:\n\n1. Using screeds and hand trowels, install the basemat at a consistent density of 29 pounds, 1 ounce per cubic foot (466 kg/m3) to the specified thickness.\n\n2. Allow basemat to cure for sufficient time so that indentations are not left in the basemat from applicator foot traffic or equipment.\n\n3. Do not allow foot traffic or use of the basemat surface until it is sufficiently cured.\n\nC. Primer Application: Using a brush or short nap roller, apply primer to the basemat perimeter and any adjacent vertical barriers such as playground equipment support legs, curbs or slabs that will contact the surfacing system at the rate of 300 ft2/gal (7.5 m2/L).\n\nD. Top Surface Installation:\n\n1. Using a hand trowel, install top surface at a consistent density of 58 pounds, 9 ounces per cubic foot (938 kg/m3) to a nominal thickness of 1/2″ (12.7 mm).\n\n2. Allow top surface to cure for a minimum of 48 hours.\n\n3. At the end of the minimum curing period, verify that the top surface is sufficiently dry and firm to allow foot traffic and use without damage to the surface.\n\n4. Do not allow foot traffic or use of the surface until it is sufficiently cured.\n\nSpecifier Note: Specify provisions for protecting work after installation but prior to acceptance by the owner. Coordinate article below with Division 1 Execution Requirements Section.\n\n3.05 PROTECTION\n\nA. Protect the installed playground surface from damage resulting from subsequent construction activity on the site."
