        "text": "9-8-5: TOWER CONSTRUCTION, HEIGHT, LIGHTING, SETBACK AND FALL ZONE STANDARDS:\n\nÂ Â Â A.Â Â Â Construction: The tower shall be constructed to the Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association (TIA|EIA) 222 revision F standard entitled \"Structural Standards For Steel Antenna Supporting Structures\", or as hereinafter may be amended.\n\nÂ Â Â B.Â Â Â Camouflaged With Surrounding Environment: All telecommunications facilities shall be constructed or modified in such a way as to best blend in and be camouflaged with the surrounding environment and, in some circumstances, may not be readily recognized as a wireless telecommunications facility, unless specifically waived, in writing, by the board of county commissioners. Said telecommunications facility shall be architecturally and visually compatible with the existing structures, vegetation, and/or uses in the area or likely to exist in the area under the terms of the applicable zone and/or comprehensive plan. The decision making body shall consider, but shall not be limited to, the following factors: similar height, color, bulk, and/or shape, or camouflage techniques to disguise the telecommunications facility. This shall not preclude towers requiring FAA painting and/or lighting and/or marking from meeting those standards.\n\nÂ Â Â C.Â Â Â Height Limit: Within the McCall, Donnelly, and Cascade airport overlay areas, the height limit on the tower or antenna structure shall be as required by the code of federal regulations 14 CFR 77.\n\nÂ Â Â D.Â Â Â Lighting: Lighting shall be consistent with the requirements of the FAA. The FAA lighting requirement shall be met in the least obtrusive manner. Security lighting for the siting area is permitted as long as it is not greater than twenty feet (20') high, downward directed and shielded to prevent illumination at the siting area boundary. Motion detectors on security lighting is recommended.\n\nÂ Â Â E.Â Â Â Tower Design: Towers must be designed to allow for future placement of additional antennas upon the tower. Such towers must also be designed to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.\n\nÂ Â Â F.Â Â Â Facilities And Siting Area Design: All telecommunications facilities and siting areas shall be designed to structurally allow for a minimum collocation of two (2) additional providers.\n\nÂ Â Â G.Â Â Â Location; Setbacks: All telecommunications facilities shall not be located within at least one thousand feet (1,000') of State Highway 55, unless located in an existing structure and/or constructed as an alternative tower structure or not visible from the highway. In addition, setbacks shall be equal to the height of the tower, plus ten feet (10'), from any public road or property line, and a minimum of one thousand feet (1,000') from the nearest residence, single-family subdivision in each direction, unless written consent of residents, lot owners, and building owners is given. This section shall not prohibit the placement of towers on a commercial building(s).\n\nÂ Â Â H.Â Â Â Maximum Allowable Tower Height: Maximum allowable tower height, including antennas, is one hundred fifty feet (150'). The county may impose stricter height limitations due to obstruction of views or incompatibility with surrounding uses.\n\nÂ Â Â I.Â Â Â Fall Zone: Every tower shall have a fall zone which shall be delineated and permanently restricted from future development as follows:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The fall zone shall consist of the land area centered beneath the tower and circumscribed by a circle with a radius equal to a length of one foot (1') for every ten feet (10') of tower height."
