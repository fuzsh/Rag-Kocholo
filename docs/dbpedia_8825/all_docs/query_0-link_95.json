        "text": "Neither process altered the sediments to convert them into hard crystalline rock, and soft unconsolidated sediments erode faster than the hard bedrock. There is a Fall Line today due to the physical differences between the hard crystalline Piedmont bedrock and the soft Coastal Plain sediments.\n\nThe sediments on the Coastal Plain have not been baked and squeezed tight; there has been no metamorphism comparable to the older bedrock exposed in the Piedmont now. There is some spots of hard rock in the Coastal Plain where ancient ocean reefs are now expsed. At other places iron was dissolved by rainwater and carried in solution down to an oxygen-free depth, where the iron came out of solution and glued sedimentary particles together. Building stones were carved from the Coastal Plain at places where the sediment was glued together, including Freestone Point at Leesylvania State Park and Government Island in Stafford County, but those building stones were far weaker than rock quarried in the Piedmont.\n\nthe Fall Line on the Rappahannock River led to the establishment of Fredericksburg/Falmouth and the location of Route 1\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Fredericksburg 7.5x7.5 topographic quadrangle (2013)\n\nEarly colonists moving west beyond the Fall Line quickly discovered locations where river currents regularly scoured the bottom of streams flowing eastward across the Piedmont. Those rivers have a thin coating of recent sediments; mud, sand and stones deposited on the river bottom since the last major flood make crossing the rivers difficult in most locations. Colonists located the fords and later built their roads to take advantage of the places where hard bedrock was exposed underwater in the Piedmont. It was far easier to cross those rivers at a ford where bedrock was exposed, compared to dragging a wagon through mud...\n\nSuch fords are very rare east of the Fall Line, except on small streams. River bottoms are soft Coastal Plain sediments east of the Fall Line; no underwater bedrock offers a hard bottom for an easy river crossing.\n\na Digital Elevation Model (DEM) shows how the Rappahannock River carved a broader valley in the soft Coastal Plain sediments, east of where I-95 crosses the river (red circle)\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), National Map - DEM Viewer\n\nIn Tidewater, colonists avoided building a road network that crossed rivers. Instead, farmers carried tobacco and other agricultural products to wharves and docks built on the edge of the rivers. Shipping mostly by water minimized the need to get wagons across a river. When necessary, colonists such as George Mason III (father of the man who built Gunston Hall and was principal author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights) created ferry crossings to get across Coastal Plain rivers.\n\nEast of the Fall Line, the Piedmont bedrock is buried beneath young, unconsolidated sediments that hardly qualify to be labeled \"rock.\" Rapids occur throughout the Piedmont physiographic province, from the Blue Ridge east to the Fall Line. The gradient at which a river channel drops can steepen briefly at knickpoints where rivers cross from harder to softer bedrock, reflecting ancient zones of different metamorphism or faults in the terranes. There are no such knickpoints on the Coastal Plain, and there are no rapids downstream of the Fall Line.\n\nrapids occur in the middle of the Piedmont on the South Anna River northwest of Richmond, but there are no rapids on Virginia rivers downstream of the Fall Line\n\nSource: ESRI, ArcGIS Online\n\nWhen a river flowing east towards the Chesapeake Bay reaches the eastern edge of the Piedmont and encounters the easier-to-erode sediments on the Coastal Plain, the flowing water washes away those soft sediments. At the Fall Line, the energy of the river carves a deeper channel in the softer Coastal Plain sediments than in the Piedmont bedrock. The difference in the depth of the channel results in rapids and waterfalls; the water flowing off the Piedmont falls to sea level at the Fall Line.\n\nSuch rapids and waterfalls are most obvious at Great Falls on the Potomac River, on the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg (look westward from the I-95 bridge), and on the James River near downtown Richmond (look westward from any bridge between I-95 to the Huguenot Bridge).\n\nphysiographic setting of Great Falls\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS) Bulletin 1471, The River and the Rocks: The Geologic Story of Great Falls and the Potomac River Gorge\n\nThe Fall Line waterfall on the Occoquan River near Lorton has been \"dried out\" by the construction of a dam, and only a trickle of water flows over the Occoquan Reservoir dam in the summer months. Fairfax Water kept the area closed to public use after acquiring the dam and reservoir complex in the 1960's, but starting in 2015 the utility agreed to open its Fall Line property upstream from the town of Occoquan to public visits. People will no longer need special permission (or have to sneak past the gates...) to see the exposed rocks at the Fall Line.\n\nrapids at the Fall Line of the Occoquan River, below Occoquan Reservoir (Route 123 on right)\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Occoquan 7.5x7.5 topographic quadrangle (Revision 1, 2013)\n\nThe Fall Line zone between the Coastal Plain and the Piedmont physiographic provinces is wide. The watersheds of the tributaries upstream from the Mattaponi River are small. They carry so little water, the coating of Coastal Plain sediments has not eroded away as fast. The Matta, Po, and Ni rivers cross the geologic boundary between hard crystalline bedrock and soft sediments while still 150' or higher above sea level and without creating a set of rapids or waterfalls.\n\nthe Mat, Po, and Ni rivers carry less water and Coastal Plain sediments (yellow and brown) while still above sea level\n\nSource: Virginia Department of Energy, Geology Mineral Resources\n\nthe Ni River flows onto Coastal Plain sediments while nearly 200' above sea level\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Spotsylvania VA 1:24,000 topographic quadrangle (2019)\n\nthe Po River flows onto Coastal Plain sediments while still 150' above sea level\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Spotsylvania VA 1:24,000 topographic quadrangle (2019)\n\nthe Matta River flows onto Coastal Plain sediments while still 150' above sea level\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Ladysmith VA 1:24,000 topographic quadrangle (2019)\n\nthe gradual elevation changes of the Matta, Po, and Ni rivers do not reveal an obvious Fall Line\n\nSource: ESRI, ArcGIS Online\n\nThe North Anna and South Anna rivers, tributaries of the Pamunkey River, encounter sandstone and siltstone in the Taylorsville Basin when they flow east beyond the hard crystalline bedrock of the Piedmont. The metamorphosed bedrock in the Triassic Basin has a resistance to erosion intermediate between the Piedmont and Coastal Plain, so those two rivers also lack clear rapids and waterfalls.\n\nthe North Anna River flows east from hard crystalline bedrock in the Piedmont onto metamorphosed sandstone/siltstone (blue borders) in a Triassic Basin\n\nSource: Virginia Department of Energy, Geology Mineral Resources\n\nthe North Anna River flows across the geologic boundary (yellow line) into a Triassic Basin while about 50' above sea level\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Ruther Glen VA 1:24,000 topographic quadrangle (2019)\n\nIn some places, erosion has excavated the river valleys and the actual waterfalls may be miles upstream from the geologic boundary between the Piedmont and Coastal Plain bedrock. As the rivers etch their way through the sediments at the contact between Piedmont-Coastal Plain, the harder crystalline bedrock is exposed. The waterfalls are migrating upstream, towards the west, as the sedimentary coating is eroded. At a far slower rate, the waterfalls are disappearing on the eastern edge of the Fall Zone as the bedrock is etched away to sea level.\n\nthe last rapids on the North Anna River are just upstream from North Anna Battlefield Park, almost two miles west of I-95\n\nSource: ESRI, ArcGIS Online\n\nToday the hard crystalline rock exposed at Great Falls on the Potomac River is the bedrock in the Piedmont, while the eastern edge of that hard bedrock formation is downstream on Teddy Roosevelt Island. The contact between Coastal Plains sediments and exposed Piedmont is underneath the Teddy Roosevelt Bridge at the eastern end of I-66, where it crosses the Potomac River to connect Rosslyn with the District of Columbia at the Kennedy Center. The whitewater rapids of Great Falls are about 14 miles upstream of the geologic contact.\n\nThe Potomac River has etched its way 14 miles upstream over the last 2 million years. In the process, it has carved out Mather Gorge in the crystalline bedrock. The gradient of most Virginia rivers changes when the rivers are about 100' in elevation above sea level. Great Falls is close to the 140' contour line, because the large Potomac River has cut deeper into the bedrock. In comparison, the slow-flowing Mattaponi and Pamunkey rivers change their gradient at only the 50' elevation contour.5\n\nTeddy Roosevelt Island marks the geologic boundary between the hard crystalline bedrock of the Piedmont and the soft sediments of the Coastal Plain\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Washington West 7.5x7.5 topographic quadrangle (2014)\n\n500-million-year-old (Cambrian Period) crystalline bedrock outcrops are buried beneath younger Coastal Plain sediments and artificial fill east of Teddy Roosevelt Island and Rock Creek Park\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Geologic map of the Washington West quadrangle, District of Columbia, Montgomery and Prince George's Counties, Maryland, and Arlington and Fairfax Counties, Virginia (1994)\n\nOver time, the erosive power of the Potomac River will move the waterfall further upstream, past Riverbend Regional Park in Fairfax County. Great Falls will move far enough upstream to get past the Piedmont bedrock, and to etch away at the softer Triassic Basin sediments near Seneca Creek.\n\nBecause the resistance of the bedrock will be less in the Triassic Basin, Great Falls will change into a series of gentler rapids over the sandstone of the Triassic Basin. It took 2 million years to etch a channel 14 miles, an average of one mile each 150,000 years. There are about eight more miles of Piedmont bedrock before reaching the Triassic Basin. Using very simplistic math, the remaining lifespan of Great Falls is about 1-1.5 million years.\n\nmigration of Potomac River waterfall from geologic boundary at I-66 bridge upstream to Great Falls (blue), and on to Seneca Creek (red) in next million or so years\n\nSource: ESRI, ArcGIS Online\n\ngeologic setting of Great Falls\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Bulletin 1471, The River and the Rocks: The Geologic Story of Great Falls and the Potomac River Gorge\n\nThe Fall Line defined by geology is in a different location that the boundary between freshwater and saltwater in Virginia's rivers. A tidal freshwater zone exists at the estuarine head-of-tide, downstream from both where rivers flow into Coastal Plain sediments and from where rivers reach sea level. Species composition in tidal freshwater swamps is changing as sea level rises and saltwater intrudes further inland. Ghost forests of trees killed by salt, with trunks still standing, are developing in wetlands that were once freshwater swamps.6\n\nlow-level salinization is forming ghost forests, replacing trees with marsh plants as saltwater intrudes westward towards the geologic Fall Line boundary\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), A temporary boost to surviving trees in tidal freshwater swamps but steadily increasing salinity associated with sea-level rise ultimately creates \"ghost forests\"\n\nThe Fall Line may be interpreted as a zone on rivers, but the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources (DWR) requires a specific location to facilitate enforcement of different regulations for freshwater vs. anadromous/saltwater fish. The state agency prioritized the interface between freshwater and saltwater, rather than bedrock geology separating the Piedmont and the Coastal Plain.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources has defined a Fall Line that is based on fixed and obvious landscape features, primarily bridges that anglers and Conservation Police Officers (\"game wardens\") can see. The Fall Line, as defined by the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources for regulatory purposes, is at the 14th Street bridge over the James River in Richmond. It then zigs eastward to Walkers Dam on the Chickahominy River, then back to the Route 360 bridges over the Pamunkey and Mattaponi rivers. The regulatory boundary then moves westward again to the Route 1 bridge at Fredericksburg and the Interstate 95 bridge over the Occoquan River.\n\nSuch a zig-zag line does not match the changes in geology or topography, but do approximate boundaries between waters preferred by saltwater and freshwater fish. The following landmarks are used by the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources to define its version of the Fall Line:7\n\nPotomac River: Little Falls\n\nOccoquan River: I-95 Bridge\n\nRappahannock River: Rt. 1 Bridge\n\nMattaponi River: Route 360 Bridge\n\nPamunkey River: Route 360 Bridge\n\nChickahominy River: Walkers Dam\n\nJames River: 14th Street Bridge\n\nAppomattox River: The remnants of Harvell Dam, approximately 0.5 mi upstream of Route 1\n\nFall Line, as defined by Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources\n\nMap Source: US Geological Survey, National Map\n\nThere are multiple ways to define the Fall Line as a feature on the landscape, based on different perspectives.\n\nFrom aÂ geologicalÂ perspective, the Fall Line might be the contact between sedimentary and metamorphicÂ bedrock.Â From a historical perspective, the Fall Line might be the spot in the rivers where colonial shipping was blocked.Â From a cultural perspective, the Fall Line might be the pattern of cities stretching from Philadelphia to Augusta which developed near the barrier for shipping, and where waterpower was available.\n\nthe James River and Kanawha Canal through Richmond bypassed the rapids at the Fall Line\n\nSource: National Archives, Map of City of Richmond, Virginia (1858)\n\nFrom a river-based perspective, the Fall Line might be a zone several miles wide through which rivers drop as much as 100 feet in elevation.Â From a wildlifeÂ management perspective, the Fall Line might be drawn in a location that simplifies enforcement of fishing regulations.\n\nDetermining what is the \"right location\" of the Fall Line depends on the point of view, and the purpose for making a definition.\n\nFalls of the Nottoway River\n\nHow the Fall Line Shaped Powhatan's Area of Control\n\nHow the Fall Line Shaped Colonial Settlement in Virginia\n\nRiver and \"Fall Line\" Cities\n\nWaterfalls of Virginia\n\nrapids at the Fall Line of the Rappahannock River in Fredericksburg (I-95 just to left)\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Frdericksburg 7.5x7.5 topographic quadrangle (Revision 1, 2013)\n\nrapids at the Fall Line of the Appomattox River at Petersburg (west of I-95)\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Petersburg 7.5x7.5 topographic quadrangle (Revision 1, 2013)\n\nthe Fall Zone in Virginia extends from Arlington County to Greensville County\n\nSource: Geological Survey of Canada, Lithotectonic map of the Appalachian Orogen, Canada-United States of America (2006)\n\nLinks\n\nGeographic Regions of Virginia map, showing the Fall Line\n\nJames River Park System\n\nGeology of the Fall Zone\n\nNational Park Service - The Great Falls Park\n\nPortage and Path Dependence\n\nUS Geological Survey\n\nA Tapestry of Time and Terrain\n\nCoastal Plain\n\nFall Line\n\nOpen File Report 00-264 Geologic Map of the Potomac River Gorge: Great Falls Park, Virginia, and part of the C&O Canal National Historical Park, Maryland\n\na dam on Aquia Creek at the Fall Line forms Smith Lake in Stafford County\n\nSource: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Sea Level Rise Viewer\n\nno hydropower facilities in Virginia are located on the Coastal Plain - all rely upon the topographic relief at the Fall Line, or further west\n\nSource: Energy Information Administration, State Profile and Energy Estimates - Virginia\n\nReferences\n\n1. \"Geology of the Fall Zone - South Tour,\" James River Park System (Richmond, VA), https://jamesriverpark.org/science-in-the-park/geology/SouthGeoTour.pdf (last cheched November 24, 2019)\n\n2.
