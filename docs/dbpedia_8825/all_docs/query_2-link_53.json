        "text": "The first five feet from your home is the most important. Keeping the area closest to buildings, structures, and decks clear will prevent embers from igniting materials that can spread the fire to your home.\n\nWhy? The majority of homes lost to wildfire are ignited by flying embers. Embers can travel miles ahead of the active front of wildfires.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nUse hardscape like gravel, pavers, or concrete. No combustible bark or mulch.\n\nRemove all dead and dying plants, weeds, and debris (leaves, needles, etc.) from your roof, gutter, deck, porch, stairways, and under any areas of your home.\n\nRemove all branches within 10 feet of any chimney or stovepipe outlet.\n\nLimit combustible items (like outdoor furniture and planters) on top of decks.\n\nRelocate firewood and lumber to Zone 2.\n\nReplace combustible fencing, gates, and arbors attached to the home with noncombustible alternatives.\n\nConsider relocating garbage and recycling containers outside this zone.\n\nConsider relocating boats, RVs, vehicles, and other combustible items outside this zone.\n\nRegularly clear dead or dry vegetation and create space between trees. During times of drought when watering is limited, pay special attention to clearing dead or dying material.\n\nWhy? Removing dead plants and creating space between trees and shrubs creates a buffer for your property and reduces potential fuel for fire.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nRemove all dead plants, grass, and weeds.\n\nRemove dead or dry leaves and pine needles.\n\nTrim trees regularly to keep branches a minimum of 10 feet from other trees.\n\nCreate a separation between trees, shrubs, and items that could catch fire, such as patio furniture, wood piles, swing sets, etc.\n\nHow much space should you leave between trees or shrubs?\n\nHorizontal space depends on the slope of the land and the height of the shrubs or trees. Leave more space between vegetation on bigger slopes. Refer to the chart below to determine spacing distance.\n\nSpace between shrubs:\n\nFlat or mild slope (less than 20%): Two times the height of the shrub.\n\nMild to moderate slope (20-40%): Four times the height of the shrub\n\nModerate to steep slope (greater than 40%): Six times the height of the shrub\n\nSpace between trees:\n\nFlat or mild slope (less than 20%): 10 feet.\n\nMild to moderate slope (20-40%): 20 feet.\n\nModerate to steep slope (greater than 40%): 30 feet."
