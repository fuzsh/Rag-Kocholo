        "text": "The depth and area of the BounceBack rubberised wet pour safety surface depends on:\n\nThe Free Fall Height of the playground equipment along with\n\nThe Critical Fall Height of the surface.\n\nThe wet pour surface depths on this page are a result of specific testing, and apply only to BounceBack wet pour surfaces.\n\nCorrectly specified playground flooring is critical to the safety of children.\n\nSurfacing Depth\n\nFree Fall Height is a measurement of distance between a play surface and the protective surface.\n\nCritical Fall Height relates to the impact attenuation of the surface material and is “the maximum height from which a life threatening head injury would not be expected to occur.”\n\nTherefore, the fall height of the equipment should not exceed the critical height of the surface in the design of playgrounds and the type and depth of surfacing used under the equipment.\n\nFree Fall Height is measured from the point at which the feet can stand and not the overall top of the playground equipment.\n\nMany pieces of equipment have tops or coverings so the measurement is not taken from that point but where the child would be standing at the highest point during normal play. The fall height of see-saws is the maximum height attainable by the seat and the fall height of spring rockers is the height of the seat.\n\nThe diagram gives the critical fall height and the minimum required wet pour safety surface thickness.\n\nSurfacing Area Around Equipment\n\nThe extent of the playground flooring safety surface required around play equipment is dictated by the height of a potential fall.\n\nStationary Equipment\n\nStationary play equipment with a FFH (Free Fall Height) of 1.5m or less should have surfacing which extends at least 1.5m beyond the edges of the equipment. For equipment with a FFH of more than 1.5m, subtract 1.5 from the FFH and multiply the result by 0.667, then add back the 1.5m.\n\nHaving an adequate and appropriate playground surface, and maintaining it properly, are the most important things a playground owner/operator can do to minimize the severity of playground injuries.\n\nThe above information is designed to help you assess the depth and extent of your safety surfacing but please don’t hesitate to contact us should you require any further advice or information.\n\nThe table opposite demonstrates this principle:"
