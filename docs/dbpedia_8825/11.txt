“I had my playground surface renovated by FallZone Safety Surfacing and this is such a great company with outstanding products. The FallZone team were fast, so my playground was not closed down long at all and it was a big project. I own The Learning Experience in New Jersey and we are so happy we replaced all that horrible mulch! There are many smiling kids running around and enjoying there new FallZone Playground Safety Surface everyday. I strongly recommend this company, FallZone by far has the best value & product”
