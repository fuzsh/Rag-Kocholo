        "text": "Tibet has \"remained a mysterious country,\" says the Dalai Lama, and the mystery extends even to himself. Ever since the spiritual leader fled to Dharamsala, India, after being forced by the Chinese to leave his home country in 1959, his only information about Tibet has come from eyewitness accounts. He tries to meet with every refugee who makes it through the Himalayas.\n\nAnd therefore it was neither the photographer York Hovest, nor the reporter Jörg Eigendorf, but the Dalai Lama himself who asked the first questions during their interview in Dharamsala. He wanted to know the details about Hovest's time in Tibet. Whether there were still monks in the monasteries where the Dalai Lama once studied and took his exams. How exactly the surveillance cameras of the Chinese worked. And whether it was not somehow possible to plant a few trees 5,000 meters above sea level. Page by page, he went through Hovest's book, 100 days in Tibet.\n\nBut in the end it was still an interview.\n\nYour Holiness, do you think that you can return to your homeland one day?\n\nYes, I am sure of that. China can no longer isolate itself, it must follow the global trend toward a democratic society. I can already feel that change among Chinese students. I heard there are more than 200,000 Chinese students studying abroad nowadays. A few years ago when I met students, they were serious and reserved. Today they smile. Those are signs of change.\n\nIs this the reason you have become almost conciliatory toward China during the past few months?\n\nA new era has begun with the presidency of Xi Jinping. He wants to create a more harmonious society than the one under his predecessor, Hu Jintao. In former years, it was the era of economic growth, which has created a lot of resentment and envy.\n\nIf China reforms, what happens to Tibet?\n\nWhoever wants a harmonious society can't rely on violence and suppression. Harmony comes from the heart. It is based on trust. Harmony and distrust are mutually exclusive. This is good for Tibet.\n\nHow Tibetan is Tibet these days?\n\nThe Chinese did not manage to destroy our culture, which is 3,000 to 4,000 years old. Those who criticize different beliefs and cultures actually make them stronger. Deep down in their hearts, 95 percent of all Tibetans still feel and think very Tibetan. They are strongly connected to their culture. This even applies to those who work for the Chinese.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"thinking and feeling Tibetan\"?\n\nThis is to practice and internalize Tibetan Buddhism, which is the teaching of compassion, wisdom based on intelligence and interdependence. We believe in being reborn over and over again, until we attain enlightenment.\n\nDo you need to be anxious about the Tibetan culture?\n\nWe still have a big problem: Without proper teachers and proper training, keeping up a religion is very difficult. Prior to 1959, there were outstanding scholars in Tibet. But most of them were arrested, some were killed, some fled.\n\nSo there aren't enough scholars in Tibet who could train new monks?\n\nWe have trained some monks here in India who have returned to Tibet. But this is rare. The danger is that religion becomes a mere ritual. It's not sufficient to ring a bell, you know. Monks have to master the doctrine and the meditation. They need to be good in both. This requires thorough training.\n\nWhy do you think Chinese President Xi Jinping is serious about the change he began?\n\nHe resolutely fights corruption. And corruption is the main source of mistrust. Xi Jinping is brave. He has alienated large parts of the old cadres. Some high-ranking Chinese officials have been arrested. The president seriously thinks about values. During his visit to Paris in March this year, he even referred to Buddhism as an important part of the Chinese culture.\n\nCould Buddhism play an important role in China's transformation?\n\nMaybe. The leader of the Communist Party saying something positive about Buddhism is definitely new. He has Buddhists in the family; his mother even practices Tibetan Buddhism. And many Chinese people are fascinated by our religion.\n\nBut monks are still burning themselves in Tibet, human rights are still violated blatantly.\n\nYes, that's terrible. And it hurts to see that. But we have to accept that Tibet will always be in the neighborhood of China. We cannot move it anywhere else. Although the two countries have a bad relationship at the moment, that wasn't and will not always remain this way. I hope for change being carried from outside into China. It is good that China was integrated into the world economy. I've always said so. What matters now is that the modern world supports China becoming a democratic country — with rule of law, human rights and freedom of press. So integration is good, for Tibet as well.\n\nYou are now 79 years old. Can you imagine that you won't have a successor?\n\nYes, indeed, I can. The institution of the \"Dalai Lama\" was important mainly because of its political power. I completely gave up that power in 2011, when I retired. Politically-thinking people must therefore realize that the more than four centuries of having a Dalai Lama should be over.\n\nBut isn't your spirituality more important than political power?\n\nTibetan Buddhism is not dependent on one individual. We have a very good organizational structure with highly trained monks and scholars. Over the past five decades, step by step we have built up a strong community here in India.\n\nSo the Tibetans do not need a Dalai Lama anymore?\n\nNo, I don't think so. Twenty-six hundred years of Buddhist tradition cannot be maintained by one person. And sometimes I make a tough joke: We had a Dalai Lama for almost five centuries. The 14th Dalai Lama now is very popular. Let us then finish with a popular Dalai Lama. If a weak Dalai Lama comes along, then it will just disgrace the Dalai Lama. (The Dalai Lama laughs.)\n\nHow old do you want to become?\n\nThe doctors say I could become 100 years old. But in my dreams I will die at the age of 113 years.\n\nYou have written and said that you can affect your rebirth.\n\nI hope and pray that I may return to this world as long as sentient beings' suffering remains. I mean not in the same body, but with the same spirit and the same soul.\n\nIt is said that whoever has achieved enlightenment will not return.\n\nThe first Dalai Lama became 80 years old. There his disciples said that he was ready for a place in heaven. He replied: \"I have no desire for any of these heavenly places. I want to be reborn, where I can be of use.\" This is my wish, too.\n\nJörg Eigendorf writes for the German newspaper Die Welt."
