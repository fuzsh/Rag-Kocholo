        "text": "Now published in Frontiers in Psychology our study resulting from the collaboration between University of Trento, La Sapienza University of Rome and Lama Tzong Khapa Institute of Pomaia (PI), in which we investigate the psychological effects of a theoretical and practical course on happiness.\n\nWho wouldn't want to be happy? We are not referring, of course, to an idea of happiness as the seeking of pleasure (hedonism), or to the modern obsession with positive thinking. We are talking about authentic happiness, understood as the full and stable expression of the person, who feels satisfied, accepts the negativity of life, and even reaches the contemplation of death. We all aspire to achieve the full satisfaction of our needs, material and otherwise, as we want to express and work on our potential and aspirations, and feel authentically good. But do human beings know how to be happy? Are there any recipes for becoming truly happy? Can we learn to be authentically happy?\n\nFor at least two thousand and five hundred years in Western culture, philosophical thought has been concerned with how people could be happier. It all started with the precepts of the Pythagorean school in the sixth century BC, passing through the theories of Aristotle, the indications of the Stoics, to happiness in God in the Middle Ages, to the advice of Bertrand Russell on the conquest of happiness. In recent decades, psychological research on the effects of interventions based on contemplative practices has shown a number of benefits, such as the reduction of stress.\n\nHowever, the question of how to promote happiness more generally remains open, as it is a very broad topic. In a manifestly nihilistic era like the present one, with a pervasive sense of disorientation and loss of meaning, with worrying data on the rise of psychological diseses, with the expansion of depressive and anxiety disorders, it would seem that these philosophical and psychological theories do not are effective in teaching humans how to satisfactorily walk the path to happiness.\n\nIn a study now published, we investigated the effectiveness of an integrated mental and cultural training program called the Art of Happiness. The course was taught at the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute (ILTK) in Pomaia (Pisa). The course lasted nine months (7 weekends per month, plus two retreats). The teachers of the course were Ven. Constance (Connie) Miller, a Buddhist nun of Tibetan tradition and teacher of Buddhist philosophy and practice in international centers since 1982, and myself for the neuroscientific and psychological explanations. The scientific study was carried out in collaboration with the La Sapienza University and the University of Trento.\n\nThe happiness training program was inspired by a book by the fourteenth Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso and psychiatrist Howard Cutler (Dalai Lama and Cutler, 2011). The book is based on the principle that happiness is inextricably linked to the development of inner balance, a kinder attitude and a more open perspective of oneself, the others and the world, towards a clear mind that can wisely lead to a deeper understanding of reality. In all these processes, a key role is entrusted to contemplative practices, including various forms of meditation. Another key role is played by rational understanding of the functioning of the mind and brain, through theoretical presentations and discussions.\n\nThe Lama Tzong Khapa Institute of Tibetan culture in Pomaia in Italy, where the scientific study on the Art of Happiness course was carried out.\n\nTo this end, the participants experimented a new approach to happiness based on interdisciplinary research, embracing themes of psychology, neuroscience, history of thought and philosophy of life of Tibetan Buddhism. All the activities were accompanied by numerous contemplative exercises (meditation, personal diary, Zen dialogues, etc.), to be carried out individually, in groups and at home. Several themes have been addressed from the teachings of Mahayana Buddhism and Western philosophical traditions, as well as from scientific research. Some of the scientific topics were: the effects of mental training and meditation, the psychology and neuroscience of well-being and happiness, neuroplasticity, mind-brain-body interactions, different areas of contemplative sciences, placebo and nocebo effects. , the brain circuits of attention and wandering of the mind, stress and anxiety, the mechanisms of pain and pleasure, positive and negative emotions, desire and addiction, sense of self, empathy and compassion, and many others.\n\nTo carry out the scientific study, the participants did several psychological tests in five different stages of the course (from start to finish). The results showed that several measures of psychological well-being gradually increased as the course progressed.\n\nIn particular, we observed an increa in the sense of life satisfaction, self-awareness and emotional regulation, a decrease of anxiety, a decrease of negative thoughts, with both shortand long term empowering effects throughout the duration of the program, with a important role played by the two retreats.\n\nThe figure shows the changes from the beginning of the course (red line) to the end of the course (blue line) (on the circumference the maximum well-being values, in the center instead the minimum). SWLS, Satisfaction in life; S-Ang / F, feeling of anger; S-Ang / V, desire to express anger verbally; S-Ang / P, desire to physically express anger; T-Ang / T, angry temper; T-Ang / R, angry reaction; AX-O, Expression of anger on the outside; AX-I, expression of anger within; AC-O, external anger control; AC-I, internal anger control; PSS, perceived stress scale; STAI -Y1, State anxiety; STAI -Y2, State anxiety; PA and NA, respectively positive and negative affect scales; OBS, observation; DES, Description; AWA, Act with awareness, Njudge, Do not judge; NReact, Don't react.\n\nThe study certainly has methodological limitations, first of all the absence of a control group. There are also in this study still unexplored directions of research, for example which of the many activities carried out was of greatest benefit, or whether psychophysiological parameters or even brain activities and circuits associated with well-being could have shown changes.\n\nDespite these limitations, the results described in the study suggest that intensive programs based on contemplative exercise (including retreats) accompanied by a theoretical framework based on psychological and neuroscientific research such as the Art of Happiness can promote mental well-being in individuals by improving mental health and psychological functioning. Programs of this type offer a unique opportunity for the intensive development of inner attitudes related to the ability to be happy, improving a more stable eudemonic well-being in adults without psychopathologies.\n\nAuthors of the article are: Clara Rastelli (University of Trento), Lucia Calabrese (La Sapienza University), Constance Miller (Lama Tzong Khapa Institute), Antonino Raffone (La Sapienza University), Nicola De Pisapia (University of Trento).\n\nRastelli, C., Calabrese, L., Miller, C., Raffone, A., & De Pisapia, N.
