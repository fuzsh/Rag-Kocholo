        "text": "“If I ask you to close your eyes and think of Tibet what do you see?” I use this line a lot at conferences and lectures. Particularly, when I’m talking about collecting ‘Tibet’ for National Museums Liverpool. I follow this up by asking if people are thinking about the Dalai Lama, or mountains, or prayer flags fluttering in the breeze; at this point I usually get a considerable number of nodding heads. For my grande finale, I ask if anyone was thinking about this, as I flash up a piece of artwork from the collection I curate at Liverpool. On several occasions an audible gasp has rippled through the audience. You see rather than meet their expectations by showing a beatific meditational thangka painting I show them Buddha Series: Mickey Mouse by Gade (Figure 1), the internationally renowned artist from Lhasa. By collecting artworks like these I have been working towards the same sort of reaction from a museum audience.\n\nGade’s Buddha Series: Mickey Mouse is one of a number of acquisitions I’ve made for National Museums Liverpool over the past 10 years. During that time I’ve collected contemporary Tibetan artworks and contemporary material culture for the purpose of building a strong visual challenge to Liverpool’s historic Tibet collection. This week, I added another significant piece to this growing collection, ‘And the Winner is…’ by Tsherin Sherpa. To celebrate the arrival of this highly resistant figure who defies the museological imaginings prescribed for Tibet, I thought I’d share some of my thinking on this decade-long collecting process over a series of blogs. If you want to read more, my reflective article on this collecting project was published in 2016 by the Journal of Museum Ethnography, although for now the article is behind a paywall (unless you are a member of the Museum Ethnographer’s Group).\n\nSo where to begin? Well, I can trace the origins of this collecting project to a visit to the October Gallery in London in 2003. I had travelled down from Liverpool to see the exhibition Radiant Transmission: Contemporary Masterpieces of Tibetan Buddhist Art which featured the work of contemporary thangka painters from Kathmandu valley in Nepal alongside works by the British artist Robert Beer. I had already decided that I was going to develop a contemporary Tibetan collection, but at that stage I had no idea what this might look like, or if I am honest, what its purpose might be. The fact that the October Gallery had used the word contemporary in their title was a good enough reason for me to go and see the exhibition.\n\nAt the show I met the artist Chewang Dorje Lama, a thangka painter based in Kathmandu and I decided to buy two of his thangka for the collection as representative examples of high quality Kathmandu style thangka produced for both Tibetan and western markets. Yet, in hindsight, these thangka were not the most influential things I saw that day. The critical moment for the Liverpool collecting project came not in the gallery, but in the cafe. Displayed without ceremony were four framed photographs, the small label told me they were called My Identity by Gonkar Gyatso.*\n\nGonkar Gyatso is a megastar of what is now understood to be a contemporary Tibetan art movement, but in 2003 I knew very little about him. What I did know was that he was referencing this photograph in My Identity; a photograph taken at the Norbulingka in Lhasa in 1937 by the American Charles Suydam Cutting. This is a posed and highly stylised portrait of Tsering, the 13th Dalai Lama’s senior thangka painter.\n\nGyatso’s method of using historic material as a reference point for contemporary practice was inspirational to me. I realised that this was a methodology I could use to build a contemporary Tibet collection. This would allow me to use contemporary Tibetan material culture to reference or ask questions of the historical Tibet collection at National Museums Liverpool. Like Gyatso I wanted to unpick the contentious and often highly political histories inherent in these collections, but also challenge the objectification of Tibetans and the continuing museological representation of Tibet as a religious place of the past. In my 2014 PhD thesis, which I am now (laboriously) turning into a book entitled, Beyond the Collector: Locating Tibetan networks of collecting and connoisseurship in Charles Bell’s ‘List of Curios’ I talk about, “the recataloguing or the repositioning of a collection, embedding it into both the relational networks and the wider geographical and political circumstances that made its accumulation possible”. This concept became my framework for collecting ‘Tibet’ in the contemporary moment and this in turn generated a set of research questions, many of which are a work in progress and are still to be answered:\n\nHow could I address issues of religious imprisonment, timelessness, and the lack of contemporary, and furthermore Tibetan, voices in the collection?\n\nWho, from the many competing and conflicting parties, should the museum collect with or from?\n\nWhat to collect in order to reflect the cultural and political changes Tibet has witnessed, processed and undergone over the past 50 years?\n\nIs it time to collect beyond the ethnographic?\n\nFinally, what objects reflect Western imaginings of Tibet and should I acquire examples for the museum’s collection?\n\nAs with all things new and challenging in museums it took a while to get the collecting project off the ground. I had to rethink the Ethnology department’s collecting strategy and also needed to decide on a focused collecting programme for the Tibet collection. With the advice and knowledge of Fabio and Anna-Maria Rossi at Rossi & Rossi and with the support and encouragement of Sarah Phelps at The Art Fund I put together a grant application. Finally, in 2009, I received nearly £30,000 from The Art Fund to build a capsule collection of contemporary Tibetan art for National Museum Liverpool; the first collection of its kind in a UK public museum (I think I can also extend that claim to Europe, but I don’t want to claim something I am not 100% sure of). This made a significant contribution to the new thematic collecting programme I devised entitled, Tibetan Realities: Life and Art in the 21st Century, which I will say more about in post No.2. The grant paid for the purchase of 12 works and the capsule collection includes pieces from some of the most notable artists associated with the contemporary Tibetan art movement, including Gonkar Gyatso (b.1961), Gade (1971), Tenzing Rigdol (b.1982), Dedron (b.1976), Kesang Lamdark (b.1963) and Nortse (b.1963). My selection criterion was simple enough; each contemporary artwork had to speak to or challenge an object in the historical collection and this acquisition partially answered the research question: how could I address issues of religious imprisonment, timelessness, and the lack of contemporary, and furthermore Tibetan, voices in the collection? In the Journal of Museum Ethnography article I talk about how two of the artworks produce this dialogue and I will touch on those here too, but I also want to share my reasoning for some of the other choices I made in 2009.\n\nFinding contemporary Tibetan voices is an important part of this collecting project and I particularly want to include voices from Tibet that have a differing perspectives on what it means to be Tibetan from those found in the Tibetan Diaspora. Clare Harris has shown the tensions regarding contemporary imaginings of Tibet within the exile community in India (Harris 1999 and 2012). This is particularly apparent in cultural institutions with close ties to the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA, previously the Tibetan Government-in-Exile) which continue to develop and promote a particular image of Tibetan art and culture that privileges preservation and Tibetan artistic purity. Contemporary artists and contemporary art have found it difficult to stake out a space in this politically prescribed cultural environment. However, a group of artists outside of these governmental confines and working in Lhasa under the umbrella of the Gedun Choephel Artists’ Guild (although I should note that several Tibetan artists working in the Diaspora also identify with this group) have built international reputations for their work. My interest in them comes from the ideas they collectively explore; what it means to be Tibetan in the 21st century, fractured personal and cultural identities, societal change, disruption and transformation, and the emergence of Tibetan Buddhism as a global commodity.\n\nI avoid seeking novelty in my works, because a lot of these things are imaginary or expectations by outsiders who are looking for “Shangri-la” or “Savage Culture”. I am living in a real society and have feelings and thoughts as other people in the world. I want to speak as humankind in general – Tsewang Tashi\n\nTsewang Tashi’s work is particularly important for his portrayal of Tibetans and his refusal to cloak his subjects in the religious materiality that is so often used to create a sense of Tibetaness in the museum. Tashi’s work is also a counterpoint to the many colonial photographs in NML’s collection that feature Tibetans as ethnographic types performing their religiosity. Tibetans in these photographs play the role of pious (but unkempt) pilgrim, or as in this image by John Claude White, the aristocratic lama weighed down by his religious regalia.\n\nThese images epitomise the ways that colonial officers chose to represent and consume Tibet in the early 20th century, but Tsewang Tashi challenges these tropes by creating close up, powerful portraits of Tibetans on the streets of Lhasa wearing tracksuits, jeans and trainers, rather than monastic robes, prayer wheels or amulets. It is worth mentioning that the piece I chose for Liverpool’s collection, Untitled No. 6 was the only artwork questioned by The Art Fund committee. One committee member was particularly skeptical as they felt Tashi’s portrait did not look Tibetan enough. This, I argued, was the point as this portrait turns the colonial gaze on its head by presenting strong, bold, hyper-realistic images of Tibetans stripped of every possible identifier of Tibetaness. This uncertainty and the questioning of whether or not this was Tibetan enough was the type of challenge I hoped the new works would bring to the museum, the historic collection, and most importantly to the museum’s audiences.\n\nMy generation has grown up with Thanka [sic] painting, martial arts, Hollywood movies, Mickey Mouse, Charlie Chaplin, Rock n’ Roll and McDonalds. We still don’t know where the spiritual homeland is—New York, Beijing or Lhasa. We wear Jeans and T-shirts and when we drink a Budweiser it is only occasionally that we talk about “Buddhahood” – Gade\n\nWhen Gade describes the ambiguities of being Tibetan in the twenty-first century, he pinpoints issues of globalization, cultural appropriation and dual heritage. What it is to be Tibetan and what contemporary Tibet can be when seen from different vantage points are two important ongoing concerns for my collecting project. It speaks to the ‘multivocal’, the idea that collections and museum displays must present different voices and perspectives. In this case, I am not only concerned with non-curatorial voices, but also the many different voices that claim to be Tibetan. Gade, like Tsewang Tashi, pushes for more realistic representations of Tibet and Tibetans and in doing so he critiques the ingrained American/European imaginings of Tibet. He plays with the packaging of Tibetan Buddhism as a global commodity that is furiously consumed in North America and Europe. His artistic practice embodies his barbed commentaries in that he uses traditional techniques to produce mineral pigments and to prepare and stretch his canvases, but his contemporary versions of thangka replace the Buddha Shakyamuni with comic book heroes and corporate icons. By using Ronald MacDonald, the Incredible Hulk and Mickey Mouse instead of Buddhist deities he comments on the changing nature of Buddhism, and its consumption by non-Tibetan spiritual seekers.\n\nWhile Gade’s thangka draws on the big business of buying and selling Tibetan Buddhism, Tenzing Rigdol’s work Poetry of Line, Number 4 focuses on the restrictive language and imagery of Tibetan identity. Rather than present the thangka as a finished article Rigdol reveals the layers or complexities needed to produce a Tibetan Buddhist figure in painted form. Poetry of Line, Number 4 uses the grids that prepare the ground for the strict iconometry (body proportions) of traditional thangka paintings used to create many of the thangka in Liverpool’s historical collection. Yet, rather than cover these complex grid systems Rigdol highlights their role in creating a tightly bound, and for him, suffocating Tibetan aesthetic. He deconstructs traditional Tibetan painting practices by revealing the structure beneath. In doing so he critiques the restrictive processes of Tibetan art and identity production. Including Poetry of Line, Number 4 in Liverpool’s contemporary collection allows me to think about how these restrictions are still highly visible in the representations museums choose to construct for Tibet and how certain religious boundaries and lines of control still exist for museum displays featuring Tibet. Rigdol’s work does then provide the basis for a discussion with museum audiences on type-casting, stereotypes, and of course Donald Lopez Jr’s Prisoners of Shangri-la. Rigdol’s work helps me to challenge the audience’s expectations while encouraging new ways of seeing the many layers that produce any given Tibetan identity.\n\nThe final artist I’m going to talk about here is Dedron, the only woman represented in Liverpool’s capsule collection. It was important to include Dedron’s work Injured Tibetan Antelope as I wanted to gender the collection and feature one of the few women artists working in Lhasa at that time. It was also important for me to include an artist who worked closely with more recognizable motifs of allegorical Tibetan thangka painting. Dedron uses the narrative traditions of Tibetan thangka paintings to create highly symbolic works that in this case comment on the survival of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibet. The swirling mountains and vulture perched ready to pounce on the wounded antelope do at first glance give the painting a sense of foreboding. If we choose to read the antelope as a stand-in for Tibet itself this is a painful image of a fatally wounded being. But, Dedron places the image of the antelope within the head-space or the mind of the Buddha, and if we look away from the wound we see the antelope’s young continuing to suckle. By including the calf she hints at continuation or rebirth. While this tightly framed image feels oppressive and creates a sense of despondency and dread, this artwork can also signify hope and renewal. In placing the painting within the wooden framework of the Buddha Dedron also produces something reminiscent of a ga’u or amulet box, which creates a protective space for Tibet. The message here is that Tibet will survive and it will continue to be protected by Tibetan Buddhism and its practitioners. Injured Tibetan Antelope is subtle, but it reveals acts of simultaneous concealment and assertion; that fine line between what to say out loud and what to veil in allegorical tales. This makes it such an important work for understanding the hidden ways that Tibetans negotiate and reveal Tibetaness in the 21st century.\n\nIn my next blog, I will discuss how I use contemporary collecting to ask new questions of the historical collections.\n\n* There are now five photographs in this series, but at the time there were only four.\n\nReferences\n\nHarris, Clare.
