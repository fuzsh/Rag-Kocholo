        "text": "If you had a ten-question limit, what are some of the queries you would posit to the holiest man on the planet? (And no, we're not talking about the pope.) Filmmaker and explorer Rick Ray had the opportunity to meet with the Dalai Lama, a Tibetan Buddhist spiritual teacher who has allegedly been reincarnated thirteen times since his first appearance as Genden Drub in 1391. It's a time of flux and change for the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist faith: Tenzin Gyatso, number fourteen, has said he will never be born again inside territory controlled by the People's Republic of China, although he hasn't ruled out a fifteenth reincarnation altogether.\n\nSo what does a man like Gyatso answer to questions such as \"Why do the poor often seem happier than the rich?\" \"Must a society lose its traditions in order to move into the future?\" and \"How do you reconcile a commitment to non-violence when faced with violence?\" Find out tonight when 10 Questions for the Dalai Lama, Ray's award-winning film about his journey to speak with the guru and the meeting of the minds that resulted, opens at Starz FilmCenter in the Tivoli. 10 Questions runs through Thursday, September 13; tickets are $5.75 to $8.75, or $2 during Two for Tuesday.
