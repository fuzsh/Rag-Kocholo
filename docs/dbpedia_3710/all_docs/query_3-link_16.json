        "text": "With the University Libraries resources, you may dig deeper into compassion.\n\nActivity:\n\nGo to the Libraries OneSearch and search Compassion. What types of sources do you retrieve? How might you filter or refine your search to locate the information you need?\n\nActivity:\n\nAs you explore the resources above consider who is sharing their point of view. Are you familiar with the authors? What do you know about their background and expertise? What do you notice about their perspective and opinions? What knowledge might they have about the topic? You might choose to investigate the author by searching the University Libraries Biography Resources. Consider searching for a few of the key figures in the book: Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Richard J. Davidson, Paul Ekman.\n\nGale In Context: Biography\n\nContains contextual information on the world's most influential people, merging reference content with periodicals and multimedia materials.\n\nActivity:\n\nThe University Libraries OneSearch is an excellent starting point to research these topics. You might also try searching specialized databases.\n\nPsycINFO + PsycArticles (ProQuest)\n\nCovers psychology and psychological aspects of medicine, psychiatry, anthropology, business, law, and similar disciplines.\n\nSocial Science Database (ProQuest)\n\nIndexing and full text for academic journals across social science disciplines including anthropology, communication, criminology, economics, education, political science, psychology, social work, and sociology.\n\nActivity:\n\nAs scholars research and write, they trace the conversation that came before and reference those sources in their own work. Examining the citations of a source is an excellent means of tracking the conversation. Go to the following article, go to the reference section, choose one of the sources to examine more fully.\n\nStrauss, C., Taylor, B. L., Gu, J., Kuyken, W., Baer, R., Jones, F., & Cavanagh, K. (2016). What is compassion and how can we measure it? A review of definitions and measures. Clinical psychology review, 47, 15-27.\n\nActivity:\n\nThis popular magazine article references and links to a number of other sources. Trace some of those sources. Where is the author gathering their evidence? How do you assess the credibility of those sources? Do the sources give you new ideas or inspire new questions?\n\nActivity:\n\nScholarly sources are typically written by experts in a field or area of study. The intended audience is other experts, scholars, and researchers. These works are characterized by specific formats, language, and structures. Popular sources may cover similar topics but tend to be targeted to a broader audience. In this activity, you will compare and contrast sample academic and sample popular sources, in order to consider when it might be appropriate to use a scholarly source rather than a popular source, and vice versa.\n\nExplore this pair of articles. The popular source references the scholarly source. Do you think the authors accurately summarize the content? What do you notice is different about the two sources (style, tone, citation practices, structure, readability, etc.)? What do you notice about the authors?\n\nPopular source: Train Yourself To Be Happy: 4 Coachable Parts of Your Mental Health\n\nScholarly source: The plasticity of well-being: A training-based framework for the cultivation of human flourishing\n\nOr explore this pair:\n\nPopular source: Training compassion ‘muscle’ may boost brain’s resilience to others’ suffering\n\nScholarly source: Visual Attention to Suffering After Compassion Training Is Associated With Decreased Amygdala Responses"
