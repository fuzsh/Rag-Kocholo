He was also part of the team that created the mandala for the movie, and was the sand mandala supervisor. During the creation of the movie, Losang took many photos of the cast and crew during different scenes. Following filming, he traveled to Tibet and took numerous photos of the actual locations that were depicted in the movie. He then collected these images, and maps and photos of Tibet and old photos of His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama’s family. This information and these historical images were compiled to make this presentation, from which people can learn about the history of Tibet and the life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\n\nDuring the slide presentation Losang Samten will provide narration of the images, as well as share stories of his experiences in making the movie. Following the presentation, there will be time for the audience to ask questions.\n\nFor more information on Losang Samten visit http://losangsamten.com/."
