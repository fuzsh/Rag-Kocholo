The film goes in-depth to portray the experiences and insights of both teachers and practitioners in the US and around the world. Along the way, it illuminates the wide ranging dialogs taking place between Buddhist teachings and science, psychology, gender theory and the arts. The film creates a vivid and entertaining portrait of the world of Tibetan Buddhism, as it is manifesting in the West and asks the vital question – ‘In these increasingly chaotic modern times, can these age old teachings help us to find genuine happiness and create a saner, more compassionate 21st century world’?\n\nThe Devotion of Matthieu Ricard (12 noon – duration: 67mins)\n\nFrom The Buddhist Film Foundation\n\n‘The Happiest Man Alive’\n\nNearly forty years ago Matthieu Ricard left his native France and a promising career in cellular genetics to become a monk in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition in Nepal. He is now a translator, photographer and bestselling author (The Monk and the Philosopher, Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life’s Most Important Skill) and an active participant in scientific research on the effects of meditation on the brain. He is involved in a number of humanitarian projects in Tibet and Nepal, where he resides.\n\nThis intimate portrait journeys with Matthieu as he continues the work of his late teacher, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, in the Himalayas, and as he serves as translator for the Dalai Lama in Europe and participates in scientific research there. His vivid photography and accessible stories of a monk s life in the Himalayas feature throughout.\n\nFilmed on location in Europe, Tibet, India and Nepal, with footage and photographs from Tibet by Matthieu Ricard.\n\nBodhisattva (1.30pm – duration:59mins)\n\n‘Beautifully done, the film is a charming, educational, uplifting treasure.’\n\nLight of Consciousness Magazine\n\nDirector: Mark Elliot\n\n‘Bodhisattva’ captures a moment in the life of the Seventeenth Gyalwa Karmapa, one of the most important Lamas in the world of Tibetan Buddhism. For many, he is the face of the next generation of Tibetan Buddhism. In this hour-long documentary, this young man of extraordinary warmth, humanity and charisma embarks on his first tour of the United States, where he speaks to packed auditoriums and delights in encountering this new world. ‘Bodhissatva’ interweaves footage shot on tour with superb background footage of the Karmapa’s childhood in Tibet, sequences in Dharamsala, India, and film of the previous Sixteenth Karmapa.\n\nYangsi (2.45pm – duration:82mins)\n\n‘An astonishing documentary’ Sprituality and Practice\n\n‘A brilliant character sketch’ Blouinartinfo\n\nThe newest documentary by director Mark Elliott, offers an intimate portrait of a young Tibetan boy who is recognised as the reincarnation of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, one of the most revered Tibetan Buddhist masters of the twentieth century. He is known as the “Yangsi”, “the one who has come again into existence”.\n\nFilmed over a period of 14 years, Yangsi chronicles the young boys life, starting with his enthronement at age four before a crowd of fifteen thousand people in Kathmandu, at which point he leaves his family for a life of training in Tibetan philosophy and ritualism at Shechen monastery. The young boy has a lot to live up to. His previous incarnation was known to millions as a great saint. How does he does he deal with the expectations placed upon him? And his circumstances are so different from his previous life as a Yogi who spent more than twenty years in retreat in mountain solitude in his homeland.\n\nIn a rare, first person narration throughout the film, the young Yangsi gives an account of his experience of growing up in, and coming to terms with, his unique inheritance. A remarkable humour and honesty characterise his biographical observations.\n\nThe Sun Behind the Clouds (4.30pm – duration:79mins)\n\nDirected by Tenzing Sonam and Ritu Sarin\n\n‘This film shows what is happening in the hearts of the Tibetan people…it presents a very unusual insight into the situation in Tibet.’ —Vaclav Havel,\n\n‘…beautiful, stirring and inescapably elegiac…’ —Kevin Thomas, Los Angeles Times\n\nAwards….include:\n\nVaclav Havel Award, One World International Film Festival, Prague, 2010\n\nSilver Conch, Mumbai International Film Festival, 2010\n\nBest Feature Documentary, 3rd Kerala International Documentary and Short Film Festival, 2010\n\nPrix du Public, Films de Femmes, Creteil, France, 2010\n\nIn The Sun Behind the Clouds, Tibetan filmmaker, Tenzing Sonam, and his partner, Ritu Sarin, take a uniquely Tibetan perspective on the trials and tribulations of the Dalai Lama and his people as they continue their struggle for freedom in the face of determined suppression by one of the world’s biggest and most powerful nations.

Australian ex-Catholic, ex-political activist and feminist, Robina Courtin has been a Buddhist nun since 1978. Teaching Buddhism around the world, she shatters the stereotype of a Buddhist nun, her intense and direct style leaving an indelible impression on everyone she meets.\n\nIn the heart of America’s bible belt, Robina visits Kentucky State Penitentiary, guiding death row inmates and others on the path to enlightenment. Determined to harness their minds and deal with their violent crimes, they inspire Robina to work even harder at her own rigorous spiritual practice.\n\nDreaming Lhasa (7.30pm – duration:90mins)\n\nDirected by Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam\n\nAwards:\n\nAudience Award, 54th Trento Film Festival, Italy, 2006\n\n‘Best of Fest’, Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, London, 2006\n\nKarma, a Tibetan filmmaker from New York, goes to Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama’s exile headquarters in northern India, to make a documentary about former political prisoners who have escaped from Tibet. She wants to reconnect with her roots but is also escaping a deteriorating relationship back home.\n\nOne of Karma’s interviewees is Dhondup, an enigmatic ex-monk who has just escaped from Tibet. He confides in her that his real reason for coming to India is to fulfill his dying mother’s last wish, to deliver a charm box to a long-missing resistance fighter. Karma finds herself unwittingly falling in love with Dhondup even as she is sucked into the passion of his quest, which becomes a journey into Tibet’s fractured past and a voyage of self-discovery.\n\nThe Cup (9.15pm – duration:93mins)\n\nDirector: Khyentse Norbu\n\n‘A delightful film’ New York Times\n\nBased on inspiring true story The Cup the second offering to our Tibetan Film Festival from multiple award winning director Khyentse Norbu. The plot involves two young football-crazed Tibetan refugee novice monks in a remote Himalayan monastery in India who desperately try to obtain a television for the monastery to watch the 1998 World Cup final. The result is a beautiful ‘feel good’ movie that was entirely shot in the Tibetan refugee village Bir in India (Himachal Pradesh) (almost entirely between Chokling Gompa and Elu Road).\n\nSaturday 27th June\n\nThe Lion’s Roar (10am – duration:50mins)\n\nDirector: Mark Elliot\n\nRecognised as a spiritual classic, The Lion’s Roar is the masterful portrait of the late 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, the great Tibetan Buddhist master known as the Black Hat Lama. The Karmapa is the head of the Karma Kagyu lineage, one of the four great lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. The film journeys with him in North America where he visits the Hopi Nation, offers teachings and performs the Black Crown Ceremony for a crowd of over a thousand Western students, along the way enjoying everything from zoos to video arcades. His cremation in Rumtek is vividly documented. Through interviews and live footage, The Lion’s Roar conveys the power of awakened mind, and its ability to provoke spiritual awakening in those who encounter it.\n\nWomen of Tibet: Gyalyum Chemo (11.15am – duration:57mins)\n\n(The Great Mother and Women of Tibet: A Quiet Revolution)\n\nProduced by Frame of Mind Films\n\nWinner of 3 TELLY awards, Gyalyum Chemo: The Great Mother recounts the compelling life story of Dekyi Tsering, the mother of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. The Tibetan people call her “Gyalyum Chemo” or “Great Mother.” During the course of her long and extraordinary life, she gave birth to sixteen children, seven who survived, three of whom were recognized as incarnate lamas, and one who has been recognized by millions around the globe as one of the world’s leading ambassadors for peace.\n\nThe film weaves together a rich life history of anecdotal threads and personal reflections from her children, grandchildren, and friends who share the details of her long and full life. We are guided and inspired by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who speaks candidly of his admiration and respect for his mother and the profound impact she had on him.\n\nDekyi Tsering’s story, as seen through the larger lens of the universal Great Mother, skillfully conveys how the greater forces of love, generosity, and mercy are constantly called into being. Dr. Marion Woodman (Addiction to Perfection), Alice Walker (The Color Purple), and Angeles Arrien (The Second Half of Life) link this uniquely Tibetan story to a much broader perspective of motherhood and how the Great Mother lives within each of us.\n\nThe Dhamma Brothers (12.30am – duration:76mins)\n\nDirector/Producer/Writer: Jenny Phillips\n\n‘A wonderful, powerful, and unsentimental film about incarcerated men getting below the surface of things. The freedom and community they find sitting on meditation cushions in an Alabama prison is a rare inspiration to all of us.’ Richard Gere\n\nAn overcrowded, violent maximum-security prison, the end of the line in Alabama’s prison system, is dramatically changed by the influence of an ancient meditation program. Behind high security towers and a double row of barbed wire and electrical fence live over 1,500 prisoners, many of whom will never again know life in the outside world. But for some of these men, a spark is ignited when it becomes the first maximum-security prison in North America to hold an extended Vipassana retreat, an emotionally and physically demanding program of silent meditation lasting ten days and requiring 100 hours of meditation.\n\nThe Dhamma Brothers tells a dramatic tale of human potential and transformation as it closely follows and documents the stories of the prison inmates at Donaldson Correctional Facility as they enter into this arduous and intensive program. This film has the power to dismantle stereotypes about men behind prison bars.\n\nOCEAN OF WISDOM (2.15pm – duration:30mins)\n\nDirector: Rajiv Mehrotra 30 min\n\nRajiv Mehrotra has been a personal student of HH The Dalai Lama for more than thirty years & A high profile TV host, Rajiv is also well known as a filmmaker having been awarded more than have won more than 170 international and forty national awards from the President of India. He has also been a personal student of HH the Dalai Lama for more than 30 years, describing himself as “a most unworthy chela”.\n\nThis unique combination makes for uniquely philosophical biography of the life of Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama . With his deep knowledge of Buddhism Rajiv is able to showhow those ideas have shaped His Holiness’ response to what is really a national crisis.\n\nAlthough there are many films now about His Holiness, this still has some unique footage, and the Dalai Lama as always manages to get across the message of wisdom, love and compassion with great humility.\n\nIn Search of Kundun (3pm – duration:85mins)\n\nDirector: Michael Henry Wilson.\n\n‘Gripping on every level’ Le Monde\n\n‘Valuable and informative’ New York Times\n\n‘Penetrating and insightful’ LA Times\n\n‘Not to be missed’ Hollywood Reporter\n\n‘In Search of Kundun’ tracks the emotion-filled encounter of Martin Scorsese with the Tibetans who portrayed the key figures of his epic ‘Kundun’. We also visit the the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, where he reminisces about the events of his youth and life in exile. Shot in Morocco and India, this engrossing documentary captures at once the rich culture of Tibet and the challenges of translating a moving story into film. It provides an eloquent plea for a culture in danger of extinction and a testimonial to the profound spiritual power of the Dalai Lama.\n\nHimalaya (4.45pm – duration:108mins)\n\nDirector: Eric Valli 1999\n\nNominated in the Best Foreign Film category at the 72nd academy film awards, Himalaya was shot in widescreen over nine months on location in a region that can only be reached on foot, with all but two characters played by real chiefs, lamas and local villagers.\n\nIt tells the story of an ageing chiefs last stand and his bitter rivalry with Karma, whom he believes is responsible for his sons death on the salt lakes. On returning ‘home’ from the ill fated trip, the ageing chief refuses to give refuses to give Karma his blessing as the new chief, and organizes a rival caravan to take the salt to lower Nepal to trade for grain. He, a few old men, his son’s widow, his grandson, and his second son, a monk, set out on the arduous journey. After tumultuous and tortuous travels amongst the forbidding backdrop of Nepal’s Dolpo region the men finally are set for a final standoff…\n\n10 Questions for the Dalai Lama (7pm – duration:86mins)\n\nDirected by Rick Ray, 2006\n\nWinner of 4 awards, this philosophical and spiritual documentary ‘10 Questions for the Dalai Lama’ finds the questing filmmaker and intellectual Rick Ray visiting with Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama — widely regarded as one of the wisest men in the world — and asking His Holiness such questions as: ‘Why are the poor traditionally so much happier than the wealthy?’; ‘Is it necessary for a society to abandon its centuries-old traditions to move into the future’?; and ‘How does one committed to nonviolence’.\n\n‘This is his story, as told and filmed by Rick Ray during a private visit to his monastery in Dharamsala, India over the course of several months. Also included is rare historical footage as well as footage supplied by individuals who at great personal risk, filmed with hidden cameras within Tibet. Part biography, part philosophy, part adventure and part politics, “10 Questions for The Dalai Lama” conveys more than history and more than answers – it opens a window into the heart of an inspiring man. If you had only one hour, what would you ask?’\n\nKundun (8.45pm – duration:135mins)\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nNominated for 4 Oscar Awards including:\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nBest Music\n\nBest Art Direction\n\nBest Costume\n\n‘With this film, composed of dazzling, beautifully framed imagery, billowing waves of music and few words, Martin Scorsese has come the closest he ever has to making a work of pure cinema.’ New York Times\n\n‘An important and beautiful movie’ Michael WilmingtonChicago Tribune\n\nMartin Scorsese directs the incredible true story of one of the world’s most fascinating leaders —Tibet’s Dali Lama and his daring struggle at the head of a nation at one of the most challenging times in its history. The film opens in Tibet in 1937, four years after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, as monks find a young boy whom they sense may be their reincarnated leader. In one of the film’s most charming scenes, they place the child in front of an array of objects, some belonging to the 13th, some not, and he picks out the right ones, childishly saying, “Mine! Mine! Mine!” Two years later, the monks come to take the child to live with them and take his place in history At its midpoint comes another very powerful scene; the 14th Dalai Lama reads a letter from the 13th, prophesying that religion in Tibet will be destroyed by China—that he and his followers may have to wander helplessly like beggars. He says, ‘What can I do? I’m only a boy’. His advisers say, ‘You are the man who wrote this letter. You must know what to do’. This literal faith in reincarnation, in the belief that the child at the beginning of “Kundun” is the same man who died four years before the child was born, sets the film’s underlying tone. “Kundun” is structured as the life of the 14th Dalai Lama, but he is simply a vessel for a larger life or spirit, continuing through centuries…………………\n\nSunday 28th June\n\nRoad to Peace (10am – duration:65 mins)\n\nDirector : Leon Stuparich – 2012\n\n‘Best Feature Documentary’ Audience Award Winner, AFME 2013\n\nIn a world dominated by suffering and violence, how can we create peace in our lives? This award-winning film goes on an extraordinary journey with one of the greatest humanitarians of all time, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. The Nobel Peace Prize winner offers a radical vision of how we can create lasting peace within ourselves and on a global level. With intimate behind the scenes access and a candid personal interview, this film is as close to a flesh-and-blood encounter with the Dalai Lama as you can get. Filmed during the Dalai Lama’s last UK visit before he stepped down as the exiled Political Leader of Tibet, this film captures his sense of humor, integrity and extraordinary ability to connect with people on a personal level. Demonstrating how any one of us can create change within our own lives and transform the world in which we live.\n\nDigital Dharma: One Man’s Mission to Save a Culture\n\n(11.30am – duration:82 mins)\n\nDirector: Dafna Yachin- 2012\n\nWhen ancient writings of Sanskrit and Tibetan texts vanish during the political turmoil of the 1950s and 1960s, the history of a whole society-–its beliefs, customs and roadmap to enlightenment-–is in danger of disappearing. Enter destiny in the form of American pacifist E. Gene Smith, a Mormon from Ogden, Utah, the unlikely leader of an effort to rescue these early insights from mankind’s consciousness, from the medical to the mystical.\n\nDigital Dharma is an epic story of a cultural rescue and how one man’s life mission became the catalyst for an international movement to find, save and provide open access to the story of the Tibetan people. E. Gene Smith spent 50 years trying to save the literary history of a disappearing culture and preserve its early lessons for the benefit of mankind.\n\nThis wonderful film really does justice to a great man. A humble pacifist from Utah, E. Gene Smith has spent 5 decades trying to save the literary history of a disappearing culture and preserve its early lessons for the benefit of mankind.\n\nTravellers and Magicians (1.15pm – duration:108 mins)\n\nDirector: Khyentse Norbu\n\nThis movie is a landmark first: the first ever feature film to be shot in Bhutan and what an incredible visual backdrop the setting provides for this allegorical tale. Two men embark on separate journeys, to escape the routine of their familiar lives, seeking out better and different pastures. A tale that cleverly interlinks the very human themes of lust, jealously and murder into a wild mystical fable and leaves us with the question…..is the grass truly greener on the other side?\n\nBringing Tibet Home (3.30pm – duration:82mins)\n\nDirector: Tenzin Tsetan Choklay."
