        "text": ", the buddhist goddess of compassion, is the subject of this painting. It is one of the finest examples of early Tibetan art, remarkable for its elegant composition and aesthetic refinement. It has a distinguished, if still somewhat mysterious provenance. Although it has been the subject of a few brief studies, fundamental questions remain about when it was commissioned, and by whom. Analysis of the painting’s , lineage of teachers, inscriptions, and style provides evidence of its origins and early history.\n\nIconography\n\nThe painting presents the beloved goddess within a mountain cave. Tara’s languid body is adorned with an array of jewels. A fine orange gauze gathers on her lap and falls almost undetected along her lower limbs. She sits on a lotus supported by two snake deities, in a natural setting dense with vegetation and inhabited by elephants and other wild animals (fig. 2). At the top of the painting, saintly beings make their way through a forest likewise filled with dangerous predators. The side registers present eight additional images of Tara within smaller mountain caves (fig. 3). In each, the goddess offers an open hand to a supplicant. The iconography of the painting is known as Ashtamahabhaya Tara, “Tara Who Protects from the Eight (ashta) Great Fears (mahabhaya).”\n\nA text from about the seventh century describing this iconography was composed by the Indian philosopher Chandragomin. His text describes Tara’s setting as “on a lake, in a jewel cavern.” In this form, Tara was patron and guide to traveling Buddhist merchants and pilgrims. The eight perils described in Chandragomin’s account were very real dangers to medieval travelers: attacks by the demons who cause disease or by bandits, stampeding elephants, lions, and poisonous snakes; being caught in forest fires or in floods (perhaps drowning in failed attempts to cross rivers or streams); and false imprisonment in foreign lands.\n\nThe Lineage of Teachers\n\nThree historical figures appear in the painting, constituting a lineage of revered teachers who transmitted teachings connected with this form of Tara from one generation to the next. The Indian monk in a red-peaked cap represents Atisha (ca. 982–1054), the celebrated Buddhist master whose presence in Tibet between 1042 and 1054 helped to establish a firm foundation for the practice of (fig. 4). Tara was Atisha’s tutelary , and he and his Tibetan disciple Naktso translated Chandragomin’s text on the Eight Great Fears Tara into Tibetan in the eleventh century. On the other side is Atisha’s chief Tibetan disciple Dromton (1005–1064), dressed in the robes of a lay practitioner because he was never ordained as a monk. The painting’s patron appears in the lower left corner (fig. 5). The monk wears the uniquely Tibetan short-sleeved yellow vest under the red robe, indicating he was a Tibetan. A lineage of teachers can be helpful in assigning dates to Tibetan paintings, for they are sometimes continuous to the period of the painting’s patron. If that were the case in this painting, the patron would be a disciple of Dromton, who founded Reting Monastery north of in 1056 and died in 1064.\n\nThese inscriptions shed light on the painting’s early history, but their implications are open to interpretation. Martin interprets the statement that the painting is the “high aspiration” of Jatson Druwo as evidence that the latter had commissioned the painting. While this is possible, it is by no means a certainty. Paintings accrue inscriptions over time. This painting’s visual lineage, which may indicate the painting was commissioned by a disciple of Dromton, and the first inscription stating “the Reting Deity” may indicate that the painting was first at Reting, where it was commissioned, and that it later came into the hands of Sechilpuwa, who reconsecrated it sometime before his death in 1189.\n\nIn support of this interpretation is evidence in paintings (1, 2) associated with . Thirty-eight twelfth- and thirteenth-century Taklung paintings bear an inscription stating they were consecrated by Sanggye Won (d. 1296), interim fourth abbot (1272–1273) of Taklung. Of these paintings, perhaps only a quarter were also commissioned by him. The great majority were reconsecrations of earlier paintings. Moreover, six Taklung paintings bear an inscription asserting that they are the “high aspiration [tukdam]” of Sanggye Won. Of these paintings, five are certainly older paintings inherited by Sanggye Won; only one painting bearing this inscription may have been commissioned by him. In the Taklung paintings, the tukdam inscription appears on paintings that were inherited from a teacher, a teacher’s teacher, and sometimes, a teacher’s teacher’s teacher.\n\nTara’s Connection with Atisha and Reting Monastery\n\nWhile in Tibet, Atisha had a vision of Tara, which he described to his disciples: “Jowo said, ‘I visualize Tārā even in dreams with the idea she is a mother. The Jomo is clearly in this, and she will be my witness [to the truth of this].’ They asked him where the Jomo [Holy One, in feminine form] was and he replied, ‘She is in a of Eight Fears Tārā. This is the one.’ That thangka is even now to be found in Reting.” A descriptive catalog of Reting Monastery describes an abbot of Reting, Neljor Chenpo Jangchub Rinchen (1015–1078; abbot 1065–1078), who was sent to India to commission a painting of the Eight Fears Protector Tara. He presented it to Atisha, then residing at Netang Monastery, who performed consecrations of the painting.\n\nStyle and Summary\n\nThe style of the painting is closely related to eastern Indian art of the period. Around the turn of the eleventh century, Tibetan Buddhists looked to eastern India, the Buddhist homeland, as a crucial source of Buddhist culture. For over two centuries, they apprenticed themselves to tantric masters and enrolled as students in the great monastic universities of eastern India such as Nalanda, Odantapuri, and Vikramashila. While there, they experienced the ritual use of Buddhist images and were inspired by the art and architecture of Buddhist India. They also commissioned and otherwise procured perhaps thousands of sculptures and paintings, which they brought back to Tibet. The aesthetic and iconographic canons of eastern India formed the foundation of one of the two major artistic styles in central Tibet from the eleventh until the beginning of the fifteenth century.\n\nSome early Tibetan paintings so closely resemble Indian art that scholars have begun to explore whether any of the surviving early Tibetan paintings, like this Tara, might in fact have been commissioned in India. Aside from observing the aesthetic and iconographic norms of eastern India (such as the proportions of figures, the architectural and iconographic forms, the jewelry and costume design, and the tropical jungle references, all of which find antecedents in the art of eastern India), this painting is remarkable because it has presence. The central figure of Tara expresses a gentle, transcendent presence. Her fine, tapering fingers hold the stem of a lotus on her left, while her right hand offers a gracious gesture of renunciation (shramana ). Note the poise of her right hand, its ringed finger raised slightly as she presents an open palm, and the fall of the gem-encrusted gold pendants of her girdle over her left calf, observing the fall of gravity. A diaphanous shawl, now just barely evident across her upper arms and chest, bears an elegant circle motif. Her form is languid, poised, relaxed, but alert. All of these aspects suggest an artist of exceptional skill and sophistication. Regardless of the uncertainties surrounding its early provenance, the painting remains one of the great masterworks of Tibetan art, one that will richly reward additional investigation."
