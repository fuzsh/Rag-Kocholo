Despite his fame, he dispensed with much of the pomp surrounding his office, describing himself as a “simple Buddhist monk.” Having fled Tibet in 1959, he took up residence in Dharmshala, India, where he led the Tibetan Buddhist community in exile. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1989.\n\n(Read the Dalai Lama’s Britannica essay on compassion.)\n\nTimeline of the 14th Dalai Lama’s Life\n\n1935: Born in Takster, Amdo region, Tibet (July 6)\n\n1935: Recognized as incarnation of 13th Dalai Lama\n\n1940: Enthroned as 14th Dalai Lama, in Lhasa, Tibet\n\n1950: Became head of state of Tibet\n\n1959: Escaped to India, beginning exile\n\n1987: Proposed “Five Point Peace Plan”\n\n1988: Proposed “Middle Way Approach” to Tibet-China relations\n\n1989: Awarded Nobel Prize for Peace\n\n2011: Stepped down as head of Tibetan government-in-exile\n\n2012: Awarded Templeton Prize\n\nIt is a tenet of Tibetan Buddhism (which traditionally has flourished not only in Tibet but also in Mongolia, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, and other parts of India and China) that highly advanced religious teachers return to the world after their death, motivated by their compassion for the world. (See Dalai Lama: A Call to Compassion.) At the time of the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950, there were several thousand of these teachers, often referred to in English as “incarnate lamas” (the term in Tibetan is sprul sku, also transliterated as tulku, which literally means “emanation body”). The most important and famous of these teachers was the Dalai Lama, whose line began in the 14th century. The third incarnation of this figure, named Bsod-nams-rgya-mtsho (Sonam Gyatso) (1543–88), was given the title of Dalai Lama (“Ocean Teacher”) by the Mongol chieftain Altan Khan in 1580. The two previous incarnations were posthumously designated as the first and second Dalai Lamas. Until the 17th century the Dalai Lamas were prominent religious teachers of the Dge-lugs-pa (Gelukpa; also called Yellow Hats) sect, one of the four major sects of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nIn 1642 the 5th Dalai Lama was given temporal control of Tibet, and the Dalai Lamas remained head of state there until the flight of the 14th Dalai Lama into exile in 1959. It is said that the incarnations prior to the 14th Dalai Lama extend not only to the previous 13 but further back into Tibetan history to include the first Buddhist kings (chos rgyal) of the 7th, 8th, and 9th centuries. All the Dalai Lamas and these early kings are considered human embodiments of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva (buddha-to-be) of compassion and the protector of Tibet.\n\nPrevious Dalai Lamas were often figures cloaked in mystery, living in isolation in the Potala Palace in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. In contrast, the 14th Dalai Lama achieved a level of visibility and celebrity that would have been unimaginable for his predecessors. He became the most famous Buddhist teacher in the world, widely respected for his commitment both to nonviolence and to the cause of Tibetan freedom. The 14th Dalai Lama has traveled the globe, spreading notions of peace and Buddhist ideas. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1989, the Templeton Prize in 2012, and countless other accolades along with achieving global popular recognition as an influential religious leader and thinker in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nEarly life in Tibet\n\nThe 13th Dalai Lama died in Lhasa on December 17, 1933. According to custom, executive authority was given to a regent, whose chief task was to identify and educate the next Dalai Lama, who would typically assume control at about the age of 20. After consulting various oracles, the regent sent out search parties to locate the child. One party made its way to Amdo, in the far northeastern region of the Tibetan cultural domain, where it encountered a young boy named Lhamo Thondup, a son of farmers who survived despite hardscrabble conditions in the town of Takster. His mother gave birth to 16 children, of whom 7 survived, and the eldest and youngest of Lhamo Thondup’s brothers were recognized as lamas. After the appearance of significant signs and his passing a number of tests (including recognizing the leader of the search party and selecting personal items that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama), Lhamo Thondup was proclaimed the next Dalai Lama. He and his family were then held for ransom by a powerful Chinese warlord. The ransom was paid by the Tibetan government, and the child and his family made the long trip to Lhasa, where he was enthroned on February 22, 1940.\n\nOrdained as a Buddhist monk, the young Dalai Lama moved (without his family) into the vast Potala Palace (the residence of the Dalai Lamas and the seat of Tibetan government), where he began a rigorous monastic education under the tutelage of distinguished scholars. Affairs of state remained, however, in the hands of the regent, who preserved Tibet’s neutrality during World War II. Although removed from international affairs, the Dalai Lama learned something of the outside world from magazines and newsreels, as well as from the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer during the latter’s seven years in Tibet.\n\nThe Dalai Lama’s flight from Tibet\n\nAfter they took control of China in 1949, the communists asserted that Tibet was part of the “Chinese motherland” (the non-Chinese Qing rulers of China had exercised suzerainty over the region from the 18th century until the dynasty’s fall in 1911/12), and Chinese cadres entered Tibet in 1950. With a crisis looming, the Dalai Lama was asked to assume the role of head of state, which he did on November 17, 1950, at the age of 15. Attempts by the Chinese to collectivize monastic properties in eastern Tibet met with resistance, which led to violence and intervention by the People’s Liberation Army that year. On May 23, 1951, a Tibetan delegation in Beijing signed (under duress) a “Seventeen-Point Agreement,” thereby ceding control of Tibet to China; Chinese troops marched into Lhasa on September 9. During the next seven and a half years, the young Dalai Lama sought to protect the interests of the Tibetan people, departing for China in 1954 for a year-long tour, during which he met with China’s leader, Mao Zedong.\n\nIn 1956 the Dalai Lama traveled to India to participate in the celebration of the 2,500th anniversary of the Buddha’s Enlightenment. Against the advice of some members of his circle, he returned to Tibet, where the situation continued to deteriorate. Guerrillas fought Chinese troops in eastern Tibet, and a significant number of refugees flowed into the capital. In February 1959, despite the turmoil, the Dalai Lama sat for his examination for the rank of geshe (“spiritual friend”), the highest scholastic achievement in the Dge-lugs-pa sect.\n\nAs tensions continued to escalate, rumors that Chinese authorities planned to kidnap the Dalai Lama led to a popular uprising in Lhasa on March 10, 1959, during which crowds surrounded the Dalai Lama’s summer palace to protect him. The unrest caused a breakdown in communications between the Dalai Lama’s government and Chinese military authorities, and during the chaos, the Dalai Lama (disguised as a Tibetan soldier) escaped under cover of darkness on March 17. Accompanied by a small party of his family and teachers and escorted by guerrilla fighters, the Dalai Lama made his way on foot and horseback across the Himalayas, pursued by Chinese troops. On March 31 he and his escorts arrived in India, where the Indian government offered them asylum."
