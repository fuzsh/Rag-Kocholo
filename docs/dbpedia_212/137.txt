A Jam Band that Plays Together Flies Together

Chris Robinson has continuously reinvented himself over the past three decades. His original band The Black Crowes have seen a wide range of musicians perform with the group.

He is currently working on a side project called As the Crow Flies. The band is made up of guitarists Marcus King and Audley Freed, keyboardist Adam MacDougall, bassist Andy Hess and drummer Tony Leone.

Robinson shared his perspective on this new project.

“Spring will be sprung and the songs will be sung. This crow will fly high with old friends and new. Bring on, bring on! I can’t wait to hit the stage with some rock ‘n’ roll for the ages. It’s been five years since I’ve had the privilege of singing these songs and with Audley Freed, Marcus King, Andy Hess, Adam McDougall and Tony Leone all onboard, a soulful rockin’ funky good time is guaranteed!” – Chris Robinson

Currently Robinson is touring with As The Crow Flies between his performing schedule with the Chris Robinson Brotherhood.
