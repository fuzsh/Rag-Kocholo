        "text": "I think Foo Fighters put on an awesome show when I saw them. I don't remember feeling short changed. In my opinion, they are one of the few (if not the only) bands that can come close to doing what PJ does.\n\nHearts and thoughts they fade....\n\nfade away...\n\nI am at peace with my lust.....for Eddie.\n\n0\n\nI've seen FF 3 times and the first time was 14 songs (It was a festival, and it was on the TCATS tour and they only had 2 albums).\n\nSaw them in 2005 with Weezer, Foos played 16 songs\n\nSaw them in 2007 and they played 19.\n\nFoos shows are great live enjoy every minute of it, but yeah, it seems to fly by. (wish they'd do bootleglegs, but their set is more or less the same each show/ tour).\n\nSaw the crowes do about a 3 hr show last night, can't complain about that. Not big on 15-20 minute jams, but the show kicked ass. They played some of my faves. Really wanted to hear Appaloosa, but knew it was a longshot, considering their catalog. Amazing show.\n\nBut yes, it makes or should make, people appreciate pearl jam giving a 25- 30 song set every night of a tour; cause people still bitch about show length, and songs played.\n\nPJ: 10/14/00 06/09/03 10/4/09 11/15/13 11/16/13 10/08/14\n\nEV Solo: 7/11/11 11/12/12 11/13/12\n\n0\n\nI look at these guys as a joke. I mean really after all these years you cant be \"friends\" with your brother but you can be in a band with him? Lame. Sure they maybe talented but there is way to much ego for me to take them seriously in anyway.\n\n0\n\nSolarWorld wrote:\n\nI look at these guys as a joke. I mean really after all these years you cant be \"friends\" with your brother but you can be in a band with him? Lame. Sure they maybe talented but there is way to much ego for me to take them seriously in anyway.\n\nThe Black Crowes are one of the best rock bands walking the planet right now. You post out of ignorance.\n\nI'd like to see PJ take a cue from them and really dig into their catalog of originals and bust out more interesting covers. I wouldn't wanna hear PJ jam like they do though b/c I don't think they could keep it as interesting.\n\n0\n\nI saw the black crowes open for Tom Petty at the gorge (a few days after the gorge 05 pj show). I didn't think there live show was all that great. I think call them one of the best rock bands walking the planet might be overrated and more like personal opinion?\n\nOut of Bands I've seen.. Ones that have some close to PJ greatness are:\n\nBruce Springsteen when he places with the e-street band.\n\nThe Who\n\nFoo Fighters\n\nTool\n\nMetallica (even though I don't dig the newer albums, their live shows rock)\n\nThats all I can think of.. you usually get your 2 hours plus out of those bands at high quality consistent live performances.\n\nMost other bands play shorter or inconsistent live. I've seen U2 a few times.. they both kicked ass and phone it in.. so I don't add them to the list.\n\n0\n\nSee if this fits your bill. Three hour show in Houston. Two hour show the next night in Austin. 5 repeated songs.\n\nSorry but the Crowes mix it up WAY more than PJ. And they have about 200 covers they pick from regularly.\n\nAnd they have been doing it longer than PJ and they don't bother with \"have to play the hits to keep the casual fans engaged\" BS.\n\nOh, and they fucking tour their asses off. When it comes to touring Pearl Jam, as much as I love them, don't even come close to pulling off what the Crowes can do.\n\nDAL-7/5/98,10/17/00,6/9/03,11/15/13\n\nBOS-9/28/04,9/29/04,6/28/08,6/30/08, 9/5/16, 9/7/16, 9/2/18\n\nMTL-9/15/05, OTT-9/16/05\n\nPHL-5/27/06,5/28/06,10/30/09,10/31/09\n\nCHI-8/2/07,8/5/07,8/23/09,8/24/09\n\nHTFD-6/27/08\n\nATX-10/4/09, 10/12/14\n\nKC-5/3/2010,STL-5/4/2010\n\nBridge School-10/23/2010,10/24/2010\n\nPJ20-9/3/2011,9/4/2011\n\nOKC-11/16/13\n\nSEA-12/6/13\n\nTUL-10/8/14\n\n0\n\nRITFWinCO wrote:\n\nGreat show.

C'mon - Southern Harmony and Amorica in particular are two of the best albums of the 90's. I just hope you've listened to those two albums before you've called them over rated - otherwise you have no standing. Your talent barometer is set very, very high...\n\n0\n\nFlagg wrote:\n\nPJ doesn't stretch out songs for 10 minutes or more though. When you play 4 minute songs you can fit more into the time.\n\nAlso 2 hours is the norm for PJ. Rare do they go beyond 2.5 hours.\n\nGreat point. I don't know where this misconception comes from that Pearl Jam play these epic, 3 hour long shows on a regular basis but outside of a small handful of shows the past 10 years or so, they average about 2 hours a show. 2.5 if you are lucky. Maybe it's all Ed's standard BS talk about getting the curfew pushed back that gets people thinking the shows are 3 hours but outside of the last Spectrum show, I haven't seen a really long show since State College in 2003. And they also don't switch up the setlist as much as many people insist.\n\nAnd I am fortunate to live in Philly where the band has come through many times the past decade but others aren't so fortunate. I think this is a case of where you see which band cares about touring and making a decent amount of money (more than any of us ever will) and which band seemingly cares more about the money than reaching as many fans as possible.\n\n0\n\nThe Crowes are probably my second favorite band next to PJ. I've seen them 5 times in the last few years and they definitely go out of their way to tour in remote parts of the country. Yes, they jam out quite a lot and Chris Robinson does have his diva moments, but they play very obscure covers and are definitely one of the preeminent live acts of the past 20 years.\n\nLuther Dickinson alone is worth going to see. That guy makes his guitar sing.\n\n0\n\nCrowes are an incredible act, but I'd love for them to play longer. As a PJ fan, I think I've been a bit spoiled.\n\n7/2/06 - Denver, CO\n\n6/12/08 - Tampa, FL\n\n8/23/09 - Chicago, IL\n\n9/28/09 - Salt Lake City, UT (11 years too long!!!)\n\n9/03/11 - East Troy, WI - PJ20 - Night 1\n\n9/04/11 - East Troy, WI - PJ20 - Night 2\n\n0\n\nFlagg wrote:\n\nSee if this fits your bill.

When it comes to touring Pearl Jam, as much as I love them, don't even come close to pulling off what the Crowes can do.\n\nAll valid, and excellent points.\n\nPlain and simple the Crowes are a hard-working band.\n\nAs far as ego goes...I actually think they have very little of it. They could sell bigger venues, but they don't. As far as Chris and Rich go...they're brothers. Brothers always have tiffs...it's just how it goes.\n\nThey've had a phenomenal run, and after the hiatus after Lions, they came back with a huge bang and have made what is possibly the best two albums of their career.\n\nThey may not play as long as PJ does on a regular basis...but they don't need to. They give out plenty of good energy in the short sets they do...and it's incredibly hard to guess what they'll play on any night they mix it up so much.\n\n7/2/06 - Denver, CO\n\n6/12/08 - Tampa, FL\n\n8/23/09 - Chicago, IL\n\n9/28/09 - Salt Lake City, UT (11 years too long!!!)\n\n9/03/11 - East Troy, WI - PJ20 - Night 1\n\n9/04/11 - East Troy, WI - PJ20 - Night 2\n\n0\n\nTheBeardedFellow wrote:\n\nI love the Crowes to death, they're my other favorite band... but singing along with Chris at a show is nigh impossible. That's the only non-positive thing I have to say about them.\n\nWhile I can agree with you on Chris's singing...he doesn't slaughter songs either. He gives great improv and lets face it, the guy can sing like a champ...so I'm cool with hearing him show off his vocal abilities.\n\n7/2/06 - Denver, CO\n\n6/12/08 - Tampa, FL\n\n8/23/09 - Chicago, IL\n\n9/28/09 - Salt Lake City, UT (11 years too long!!!)\n\n9/03/11 - East Troy, WI - PJ20 - Night 1\n\n9/04/11 - East Troy, WI - PJ20 - Night 2\n\n0\n\nbobasfeet wrote:\n\nThe Black Crowes are completely UNDERrated.

The last two BC shows I've seen there have been a few assholes in the arena.

One going to the show and one a doorman/ID checker at the club next door. Both agree the PJ and BC fanbases have a lot in common and are basically the same kind of people. The Crowes fans I hung with were at all three shows this weekend and some were hitting 10, 20 even 30 shows on this tour. We are a lot alike.\n\nEvery Crowe fan I talked to mentioned how much they respect PJ when I mentioned them and the 10 Club.\n\nDAL-7/5/98,10/17/00,6/9/03,11/15/13\n\nBOS-9/28/04,9/29/04,6/28/08,6/30/08, 9/5/16, 9/7/16, 9/2/18\n\nMTL-9/15/05, OTT-9/16/05\n\nPHL-5/27/06,5/28/06,10/30/09,10/31/09\n\nCHI-8/2/07,8/5/07,8/23/09,8/24/09\n\nHTFD-6/27/08\n\nATX-10/4/09, 10/12/14\n\nKC-5/3/2010,STL-5/4/2010\n\nBridge School-10/23/2010,10/24/2010\n\nPJ20-9/3/2011,9/4/2011\n\nOKC-11/16/13\n\nSEA-12/6/13\n\nTUL-10/8/14\n\n0"
