Goes back to before the Crowes when they were called Mr. Crowes' Garden.\n\nYeah, I looked up Joel also....not sure whats going on. A few weeks ago Charlie played with them on the \"EP premiere '1972' Live from the Whisky A Go Go\" . They said he was filling in for Isiah Mitchell. I know he plays/played with a band called Earthless. Maybe obligations there? When they reformed a few years back they had bassist from the TTB Tim Lefebvre and a drummer Raj Ojha. Those two were replaced by Sven and Brian Griffin.\n\nGorman's book is real good. I heard a podcast right around the end of the year with former bass player Johnny Colt, he was probably a little more vocal/demonstrative about his time in the band. Pretty intense!\n\nEveryone has a plan, till you get punched in the face,\n\n@robslob\n\nYeah it is interesting that Starr is still guesting(?) with the Crowes after all this time. Would love to see them with him as I am a big BBerry Smoke fan and think Charlie is very talented and an underrated as a guitar player.\n\nI also saw the Crowes with Luther on second guitar at the Boston HOB before I really even knew who he was. He played a vintage Gibson ES-125 like this one the whole concert. Going to see the NMAllstars this August and can't wait.\n\nHere is an interesting video on his gear\n\nhttps://www.premierguitar.com/rig-rundown-luther-dickinson\n\nhttps://www.premierguitar.com/artists/luther-dickinson-world-boogie-is-here\n\nIf you get a chance you should listen to the audio book of Gorman's book as he reads it and he adds some real emotion to what he has written. You can tell he is really sad about what happened in the Crowes and is conflicted about not being in the band anymore.\n\nThis post was modified 2 years ago by Bill_Graham\n\n@lee: \"I have to respectfully disagree with you guys that say Steve Gorman was bashing Chris excessively. My read on it is that I don't really think so. I thought it was a provoking view of someone who had been there.\"\n\nApparently there are two different versions of Hard To Handle by Steve Gorman? Damn, I can't believe you just said that. I could quote Gorman again and again when he bashes Chris but why spend the time? Here are pages in the book where he bashes Chris Robinson: 50, 64, 98-99, 108-109, 116-117, 192, 196, 288, 291-292, 295. Pages 291-292 may be the topper of them all. But don't settle for that. You have the book still? I just gave you the page numbers.\n\nGorman describes the mood after Chris's marriage in Aspen to Kate Hudson. FYI his brother Rich, the best man, had left the wedding just as the reception was getting started which really set Chris off. Gorman and his wife shared the same ride with Chris and Kate after the reception because they were all staying at the same villa. Pages 291-292:\n\nGorman: \"From the backseat, hammered, I told him, 'F*ck him. Didn't you just marry a f*cking movie star for f*ck's sake......why don't you focus on what makes you happy instead of your stupid f*cking brother?' I might as well have suggested that he sprout wings and fly.\n\nWe were driving home from the most beautiful wedding day I'd ever seen. Miserable. We were walking in a figure eight in a field of grass in 1987 after a successful gig. Miserable. We were leaving London after a hugely successful first tour. Miserable. With every moment of triumph there was a corresponding crash.\n\nChris was a control freak. A control freak without linear thoughts, or contemplation, or a set goal at any given moment......but, still, a control freak.\n\nChris had a burning, raging need to control the emotional charge of any positive moment. When things got too good, he always had to bring them crashing back down to earth.\n\nSomewhere in the most fundamental building blocks of his psyche, somewhere very early in the development of his worldview, a number had been improperly inserted into the code. Therefore his formula was forever off, and nothing was ever going to add up properly.\n\nThe result was a complete lack of faith in positivity. An inability to trust in others.\n\nA certainty that the good times wouldn't last, that they couldn't last, and therefore must be destroyed.\n\nAnd thus, controlled. Poor guy. He was flying blind. Always had been. Always would be.\"\n\nLIKE I SAID, LEE: Apparently you got your hands on a completely different copy of Hard To Handle than I did. I just quoted you just ONE example of Gorman bashing Chris. I'm not saying it was warranted or it was not warranted. I'm just saying, READ THE BOOK. Apparently you only scanned it. And I don't remember myself or anyone else saying that Gorman bashed Chris \"excessively\". We just said he bashed him, and a LOT. I just gave you the page numbers to prove it.\n\nThis post was modified 2 years ago 5 times by robslob\n\nI think it might be subjective on what we think \"bashing\" is and how much. Like Lee mentioned \"I thought it was a provoking view of someone who had been there\". Is a good way to put it and I thought it was insightful also. He does lay it out there for sure,bash, but I dont think the whole book is a burn down. Steve seems to be an honest guy , it's just the vibe I get from the many interviews I have read and heard. Very well spoken. I still cant cant over the whole Jimmy Page thing with Rich. Amazing!\n\nHere is a link to the Johnny Colt one. Its kinda long, but worth a listen ,IMHO. Kinda intense/passionate at times he is.\n\nI really enjoy Rich's solo stuff. His first release \"Live at the Knitting Factory\" is real good. Chris's New Earth Mud was solid, but his stuff after that , not my cup of tea. Pretty much tuned out during that era.\n\nThe Brothers are very talented when it comes to songwriting and more formidable as a duo for sure. They're body of work speaks for itself. I am looking forward to any new material they are going to produce. Would love for them to start turning more ears back to that \"Rock\" sound.\n\nEveryone has a plan, till you get punched in the face,\n\nI'm on page 330 of Hard To Handle by Steve Gorman, only 16 pages from the end of the book. Just in case that quote above was not enough for anybody, here's another one from page 330:\n\n\"By 2009, Chris had fully committed to his narrative that he was The Black Crowes.\n\nHe ranted endlessly. 'I write the setlist every night. I oversee the artwork. I design the laminates. I oversee the merchandise designs. I'm the one that keeps the crowd going. I am the only one performing! I do everything. You guys don't do shit. All you do is get paid.'\n\nThe band did, in a sense, become 'Chris Robinson and the No-Names,' but that was all on him. I came back encouraged by the thought of 'doing things the right way.' But ultimately that didn't happen, because Chris destroyed the kinship that was The Black Crowes.\n\nBy the time it was all said and done, Chris's greatest talent was clear to see. He was a f*cking genius at surrounding himself with other people filled with real talent, dedication, and humanity and dragging them all down into the muck and filth and disorder of his own existence. And when they wobbled, or struggled, or fell........he moved on without them, kicking them out the door. And for that he wanted more. More credit, more control, and more money. Always more.\"\n\n@robslob Chris apparently isn't a band guy. Too strong a personality and too involved with how things should run from A to Z to be in a situation where he is one vote among equal mates.\n\nTalented musicians/people like Chris should operate a solo band. As Gregg Allman, who wasn't as strong and picky a personality, said more than once he liked his band the best. Gregg said he is the only chef in the kitchen in his solo band and it's totally his stew.\n\nWith that said there are a number of bands that become controlled by one or two members. For many years the ABB was run by Dickey and Gregg and mostly Dickey. In the beginning it was Duane but Duane was a hippie and wanted a band of equals. Rolling Stones by Mick and Keith. When Mick and Keith aren't seeing eye to eye the Stones stay off the road. Eagles by Don Henley and Glen Frye. And many more. The other guys have to yield to the leaders or something will have to give. Sometimes they quit or get booted. And everytime one of the originals of a band leaves it makes the strong personalities in that band more powerful as their replacement either is not a full member or a hired sideman.\n\nA friend who has a son really into the Crows loaned me this book. I agree robslob. Steve Gorman is ripping Chris all through this thing. Gorman wanted a band of brothers, equals.\n\nTo me it seems hell would freeze over before Chris would ever consider being on stage with Steve again. If the Black Crows continue touring, Steve Gorman won't be the drummer.\n\nI did not take Gorman's book as bashing so much as telling what actually went down. Bashing to me is when someone makes accusations about someone which are not true or are half truths and I did not see Gorman's comments about Chris as that. He also had some negative things to say about Rich but everyone is focused on his comments about Chris.\n\nThe Crowes broke up the last time in 2015 when Chris tried a financial power play by asking Rich to give up his equal share of the Crowes and wanted Gorman give up 100% of his share and make him a salaried sideman.\n\nhttps://blabbermouth.net/news/the-black-crowes-are-no-more-says-guitarist-rich-robinson\n\nChris even admitted to this in an interview with Howard Stern and explained that he wanted out of the Crowes and this was his way to force a breakup as he knew they would not agree to his demands. Sound fishy to me but that was his explanation.\n\nBased on comments from members of the band at the time Chris was very difficult to work with so I have little doubt what Gorman claims are mostly the truth although it is his side of the story.\n\nWhen I was younger, in my late teens, I was working in a lumber yard humping lumber and cement bags and a wise Manager I worked for once told me \" If you ask 10 people about someone and 9 out the 10 people you ask say the person is an a**hole he most likely is an a**hole\". So I believe what Gorman wrote as he wasn't the only person who was there to basically say Chris was an a**hole back then.\n\nThis post was modified 2 years ago by Bill_Graham\n\nI'm 75 years old so should stay home anyway, I'm never going to see Chris and the Crows again.\n\nI finally finished Steve Gorman's book and maybe it's sour grapes on Gorman's part but Chris sounds like a egotistical jerk and controll freak. I'll continue to listen to their music when I want to.\n\nI enjoy watching videos of Buddy Rich playing the drums. Phil Collins said Buddy is probably the best drummer we've had. Personally I tend to agree. But if Buddy was still alive (died in 1987 and would be over 100 now) I wouldn't go see him. Because he was an egotistical jerk yelling at his band members regularly.\n\nPaul Anka is still living and may be still touring. He too is a jerk behind the scenes. Anyone seen the video of him cursing and yelling at his staff and musicians? It's on YouTube and titled \"Paul Anka wants shirts!\" Paul noticed a trombone player without a matching shirt and after the show goes crazy cursing and screaming at his people for 20 minutes. Man needs some Prozac!!\n\n@bill_graham: \"I did not take Gorman's book as bashing so much as telling what actually went down. Bashing to me is when someone makes accusations about someone which are not true or are half truths and I did not see Gorman's comments about Chris as that.\"\n\nNot sure I can agree with that statement. I mean, in the interest of consideration of others, do you have to call someone an \"addict\" and a \"narcissist\" in your book, even when you believe it to be true? How would you feel if ABB band members were slinging around terms like that about each other here on this website, either now or 10 years ago? You wouldn't feel that was bashing? Because it was \"true\"? Well, WHO decides if it's true? The reader? I will admit, this book vastly lowered my opinion of Chris Robinson.\n\nHere's one last quote about Chris Robinson in Steve Gorman's book and I'll back out of this discussion. I believe I've proved my point. Oh and yeah, Gorman did \"bash\" Rich Robinson in the book too. About 10% as much as he bashed Chris. Page 338:\n\n\"Chris has spent years projecting himself as a care-free, hippie-dippie, guy. And there are certainly some people out there who buy into that. But it's not real.\n\nThe real Chris Robinson is the angriest person I've ever known. He's also the most judgmental person I've ever known.\n\nI've called him a lot of names over the years. I don't do that anymore. Now that it's been years since I've spent time with him, it's much easier to see him for what he is.\n\nHe's an addict. He's a narcissist.\n\nAnd both of those conditions have progressed unabated for years.\n\nI doubt he'll ever get help. I don't think he could ever face himself, the careers he's damaged, the promises he's broken, the lives he's shattered......I don't think he could live with it. It's just too much. So he continues to self-medicate, always dodging reality, never looking back.\"\n\nThis post was modified 2 years ago by robslob\n\n@robslob Been lots of drug addicts in rock. And it's always hindered their careers and play. It results in missed shows, never getting the next album done etc and the list is long of how many had their lives cut short. When one is an alcoholic,drug addict AND egotistical and a narcissist...wow that person is hard to handle if you'll excuse the pun.\n\nIt's likely the Black Crows will never be a band again. Probably the Chris Robinson show with his brother and sidemen who have no input. They just play what they are told.\n\nI'm so glad Derek and Warren aren't like that.\n\nIn the early 2000s Butch Trucks would indicate in his interviews that Dickey is an alcoholic and drug addict plus a mean bully. By about 2010 Butch came out in an interview that Gregg Allman still had a drug problem but he wasn't mean and Gregg was over on the side, not in the middle of the stage.\n\nFirst time I read that is was perplexing as Gregg continued to claim he got off drugs and vodka and cigarettes in 1995 after he saw himself on TV in New York when the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as he was so blasted he couldn't say what he wanted to say about Duane Allman. And how he looked and sounded when they played some songs at the induction.\n\nMaybe in 2010 Gregg was on a lot of prescription drugs for health issues. I seem to remember it came out Gregg still smoked pot. But some cancer patients smoke marijuana for medical reasons.\n\nOh well Rock and Roll, drugs, booze and some big egos seems to go together in a lot of places.\n\nThis post was modified 2 years ago 2 times by robertdee"
