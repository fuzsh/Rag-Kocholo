        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA- So, it was a 2.5 hour drive out to Yaamava’ Resort in Highland, California. I kept thinking to myself…NEVER AGAIN ON A MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND! When I finally arrived and made my way to the theater all I could hear was the sound of slot machines and the roulette wheel. There was the scent of middle-class hope everywhere.\n\nI’m a SoCal kid bred through and through. Water sports, skateboarding, and summer bus rides to the beach run through my veins and is part of my tapestry. But I’ve got to tell you… the Black Crowes and their style of Southern Blues Rock rocks this SoCal kid’s soul hard. They are a LOUD and true guitar band, with a lead singer, Chris Robinson, whose voice only gets better and better with time… and they rocked loud at the Yaamava’ Resort at San Manuel Casino on May 27th, 2022. REAL LOUD. To have the band reunited again… man. Makes me smile just thinking that The Black Crowes are finally flying again!\n\nI probably attend 3-4 shows a week and always wear my earplugs otherwise I’d be deaf. That’s how LOUD they were!!! Rich Robinson, the other half of the famous duo that started this incredible band, went straight into power chord mode. My ears were so grateful for earplugs that night.\n\nChris and Rich Robinson, blood brothers of The Black Crowes, were one of the bands I’ve been anxiously anticipating seeing in concert since the pre-covid shutdown. They officially broke up back in 2013, and barely played with each other over the past 10 years. They are the American rockstar version of the infamous Gallagher brothers of the band Oasis. On stage, the Robinson brothers are a pair of dangerous weapons. Rich with his guitar and Chris with his voice. There is no denying that two is better than one on stage.\n\nEveryone inside the beautiful and brand new Yaamava’ Theatre was in for an incredible ol’ fashion rock’n roll show. The Black Crowes were known for saving “Rock’n Roll” in the ‘90s with their debut album Shake Your Money Maker. Everyone in the room anticipated hearing “Twice as hard”, “Jealous Again”, “Hard to Handle” and “She Talks to Angels”. The song I was really dying to hear was “Soul Singing” from their LIONS album. With the odd exception of “Hard To Handle”, they played them all.\n\nWith every song, people started getting more and more into the mood. Whether air guitaring, singing along or shaking their own moneymakers, the crowd was definitely getting into it. One of the highlights of the night was a throwback to 1972. 1972 is also the title of their latest EP release which is a tribute album to songs from that year. “Papa Was A Rolling Stone “ by the Temptations is just a dirty, funky song. With quite possibly one of the most famous bass line intros and a sick wah-wah guitar, it was enhanced with Chris Robinson’s harmonica and rock style. The authenticity of love for the epic music from that era was more than respected and revered in the 1972 album. It was recorded in the famous SUNSET STUDIOS where PRINCE recorded 1999 and countless other legendary bands recorded.\n\nThis night was a celebration of love and devotion to analog ROCK’N ROLL!\n\nFollow The Black Crowes on Facebook Twitter and Instagram.\n\n*********************\n\nVIDEO CLIPS"
