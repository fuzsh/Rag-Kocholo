Their recent tours have sucked though, as they've become complacent and are now literally sharing the stage with rappers and other bands and singing their songs as well. I don't wanna buy a Counting Crows ticket to see their bassist do five songs while some dude raps, and then see Augustana sing the bridge to Mr. Jones.\n\nAlso, their last two albums were far inferior to Recovering the Satellites, and their other two early albums. Ugh.\n\nI knew it all along, see?\n\n0\n\njim.barry wrote:\n\nIf you want a great live experience, skip the counting crows and go see the Black Crowes . By far one of the best bands out and touring today\n\nExcellent first post and so very true. Welcome by the way.\n\nAs for the other Crows....I still contend that 'August and Everything After' is a masterpiece, but the kool-aid wasn't strong enough for me even with the second album...which was still pretty damn solid.\n\nI can't comment on their virtues as a live band for I have not seen them, but I think the overall quality of their work has lagged simply because they far outreached themselves with August....I think maybe that album was simply a fluke. Well, maybe not a fluke, but maybe they just weren't made for the long haul.\n\nAll I have to do is revel in the everyday....then do it again tomorrow\n\nThey say every sin is deadly but I believe they may be wrong...I'm guilty of all seven and I don't feel too bad at all\n\n0\n\njim.barry wrote:\n\nIf you want a great live experience, skip the counting crows and go see the Black Crowes .

I have a friend who is a major fan. I've watched their live videos and am bummed that Adam rarely sings it the way it's recorded, but whatever..\n\nAugust and Everything After is an incredible album though...\n\n7/2/06 - Denver, CO\n\n6/12/08 - Tampa, FL\n\n8/23/09 - Chicago, IL\n\n9/28/09 - Salt Lake City, UT (11 years too long!!!)\n\n9/03/11 - East Troy, WI - PJ20 - Night 1\n\n9/04/11 - East Troy, WI - PJ20 - Night 2\n\n0\n\nI saw the Counting Crows maybe six years ago opening for John Mayer when John Mayer was still a pop star for 14 year old girls. I agree with their live show being fairly sucky. They played the most lackluster version of Rain King imaginable. I mean, Rain King was one of their most uplifting songs (despite the name) from their early albums, and Adam sang it like Eyore. What a disappointment.\n\nBut I do think their newest album was a return to form. It wasn't as good as their first two albums but at least they returned to more of a rockin' sound than that pop they'd been making recently.\n\n0\n\ngabers wrote:\n\nI saw the Counting Crows maybe six years ago opening for John Mayer when John Mayer was still a pop star for 14 year old girls.

Instead, it's sitting around in some studio somewhere, collecting dust. The song is called Suffocate, and it's an incredible song that they played live once. They recorded it for the last album, and then didn't release it. Not even as a bonus track. Huge disappointment.\n\nI knew it all along, see?\n\n0\n\nProbably the most frustrating live band around, Adam Duritz would do well to go back and listen to their records and re-learn the vocal melodies. I saw them live a few years back and he basically changed every melody, to the point that it prety much killed any sing-alongs. Now I'm all for a bit of improvisation, but he sounded more drunk and incoherent.

Ugh.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu9rtD7KKBI\n\nYeah there really is no need to stretch Rain King out over nearly eight minutes!\n\nI don't know if he's just plain arrogant or what, but changing the songs up that much isn't much fun for the audience. Obviously it works better on some songs than others, for example, there is an amazing version of Round Here on the b-side to Angels Of The Silences where he really adds to the song. I think you can get away with it on a more drawn out kind of song, but when it's essentially a 3-4 minute pop song like Mr.Jones it just doesn't work, what should be a triumphant sing-along moment just falls flat and leaves people disappointed.\n\n0\n\nI loved them up thru the lbum with Mrs. Potter lullby and Hanging round,,\n\nNot a big fan odd Hard Candy but Sundays and Saturdys iIS a return to their greatness in song writing.\n\nunfortunately their ability to translate songs in live setting (which used to be their strong suit) is gone , fini.\n\nThe reason, Adam Duritz... he can't sing like he used to seems to be burned out with touring and has taken to wearing wig of fake dreadlocks.\n\nNot sure why people hve been raising the \"he doesn't sing the songs like the originl version\" he hs been doing tht since 1992 ever since Van Morrison told him it was the only way not to \"get bored\" singing the sme songs every night (another gret vocalist who butcheres his orginals live)\n\nits suppose to be some kind of jazz ethic.\n\nschool dismisseed!\n\n\"This here's a REQUEST!\"\n\nEV intro to Chloe Dancer / Crown of Thorns\n\n10/25/13 Hartford\n\n0\n\nfacepollution wrote:\n\nProbably the most frustrating live band around, Adam Duritz would do well to go back and listen to their records and re-learn the vocal melodies.

I love the fact that Adam changes the melodies and lyrics live, it's part of the theatrical way that he performs and it makes each performance unique in my opinion.\n\nHe's been doing it since the early days (on the Across a Wire album \"Round Here\" has lyrics from \"Have You Seen Me Lately?\" and the introduction to \"Mr. Jones\" includes lyrics from \"Miller's Angels\" and \"So You Wanna Be A Rock & Roll Star\") and I guess it's one of those things that you either love or hate.\n\nFor what it's worth, this is my Mr Jones video and I'm only posting this to show how much energy the crowd put into singing every word.

I've seen them about five times live including both festivals and their own shows, and that was by far the worst. Like I said in my first post, some improvisation is cool, I don't mind him putting bits of other songs in there, I mean Ed does that all the time and it sounds great. However, in that Mr. Jones video he is nowhere near the melody, it doesn't sound special or unique to my ears, it sounds like he's rambling and can't keep up with the song. I was in that crowd and sure everyone was trying to sing along, but they were singing the original melody, it would have been nice if Mr.Duritz had joined us for at least some of it.\n\nImagine if Ed started singing Alive in the same dis-jointed way, like it or not, some people want to hear those big songs, and I think it's down to the artists to do them some kind of justice.\n\n0\n\nI saw the counting crows on their recovering the satelites tour and thought it was good. Saying that though, I have never felt the need to see them live again and that was 14 years ago. One time sufficed.\n\nLike many, just lost interest or the connection. However, they still have a solid fanbase that probably think \"Hard candy\", \"saturday nights, / Sunday mornings is the holy grail of the Coubting crows catalog.\n\nPJ: 10/14/00 06/09/03 10/4/09 11/15/13 11/16/13 10/08/14\n\nEV Solo: 7/11/11 11/12/12 11/13/12\n\n0\n\njohnny america wrote:\n\nAlong with PJ and Alice in Chains, the Crows were in my holy trinity of favorite bands growing up.\n\nToday, they suck ass.\n\nWhy?\n\ncuz Adam Duritz has fake dreads :x\n\nand there are like 8 band members...and the only original member left is fake dreads\n\nand because Adam Duritz feels the need to change the way he sings songs live, which in turn makes them suck ass.\n\nI used to like them too...i know...its sad.\n\nMansfield, MA - Jul 02, 2003; Mansfield, MA - Jul 03, 2003; Mansfield, MA - Jul 11, 2003; Boston, MA - Sep 29, 2004; Reading, PA - Oct 01, 2004; Hartford, CT - May 13, 2006; Boston, MA - May 24, 2006; Boston, MA - May 25, 2006; Hartford, CT - Jun 27, 2008; Mansfield, MA - Jun 28, 2008; Mansfield, MA - June 30, 2008; Hartford, CT - May 15, 2010; Boston, MA - May 17, 2010; [EV - Providence, RI - June 15, 2011; EV - Hartford, CT - June 18, 2011]; Worcester, MA - Oct. 15, 2013; Worcester, MA - Oct. 16, 2013; Hartford, CT - Oct. 25, 2013; Boston, MA - August 5, 2016; Boston, MA - August 7, 2016...\n\n0"
