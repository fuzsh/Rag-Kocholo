        "text": "The Black Crowes\n\nThe Black Crowes – a rock band Billboard coined an “Allmans-to-Zappa synthesis of influences” – broke onto the scene with their multiplatinum 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker. The Georgia band has since released seven studio albums, which have racked up worldwide sales exceeding 19 million. The Crowes’ 2008 LP, Warpaint, includes, according to Rolling Stone, “some of the best range and craft of the band’s career.”\n\nThe Venue\n\nThe Lyric Theater has accrued a rich history since its inception in the late 1800’s. Originally a stable owned by the family of esteemed author, William Faulkner, it was converted into a theater during the 1920’s for performances and silent films, and was thus titled The Lyric Theatre. Due to the rising popularity of film, it eventually became Oxford’s first movie theater. In 1949, William Faulkner attended the theater’s world premiere of MGM’s Intruder in the Dust, a film adapted from his novel of the same name. The Lyric ceased its operations as a movie theater in the 1970’s and was abandoned until the early 1980’s, when it was restored and converted into office spaces and a health center. In 2007, The Lyric underwent a second restoration and was returned to its original purpose as a theater. It began operating again the next year.
