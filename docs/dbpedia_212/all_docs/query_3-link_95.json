        "text": "THE BLACK CROWES – HAPPINESS BASTARDS\n\nReviewed: 1st April 2024\n\nReleased: 15th March 2024, Silver Arrow Records\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nReviewer: Jack Merry\n\nA look back through the music industry over the years will dig up many examples of brothers who just couldn’t see eye to eye. Phil and Don Everly, Ray and Dave Davies, Duane and Gregg Allman, and Noel and Liam Gallagher all had very public fallouts with each other for a myriad of reasons; be it writing credits, control, substance abuse, or just generally being a pain in the arse.\n\nChris and Rich Robinson of The Black Crowes have had one of the most prolific and tumultuous relationships in the business. After many breakups, reunions, side projects and squabbles, Chris and Rich seem to have buried the hatchet for good as they deliver ‘Happiness Bastards,’ their first new studio album in 15 years.\n\nThe group’s previous effort from 2009, the experimental and wandering ‘Before the Frost… Until the Freeze,’ was a double album that shed the straight ahead rock n’ roll of previous albums and dove headfirst into full Americana and roots music. It’s a solid if sprawling album, with enough varied material that all Crowes’ fans will find something to enjoy.\n\nFast forward to 2019 and the brothers announced their reunion, stating they had resolved their differences and were planning a 2020 tour to commemorate 30 years of their deubt record ‘Shake Your Money Maker.’ Playing together again had obviously re-lit the fire inside them and it wasn’t long until work began on the new material.\n\nThere’s a little more to their history than that, but it can be found anywhere online if you’d like to know more. It makes for interesting reading. Now we’re all up to speed, lets take a deep dive into the Black Crowes’ new album ‘Happiness Bastards.’ The Crowes have publicly stated that they set out to make a true rock n’ roll record, and they’ve absolutely done that. It’s easily the most consistent and well written batch of songs the brothers have produced since 1999’s ‘By Your Side,’ at least in my book.\n\nThings get off to a roaring start with the Faces-on-a-bar-crawl swagger of opening track “Bedside Manners,” complete with slide guitar, boogie-woogie piano and a rollicking stomp. Chris’ lyrics are as good as ever, as the bridge couplet of “If you don’t want my diamonds, don’t shake my tree / Girl you think you know what’s best for me” is feverently stuck in my head as he celebrates a lost relationship. As it reaches an ecstatic finale, a gospel backing vocals and Chris is let loose and it’s a defintive ‘we’re back’ statement. Great stuff.\n\n“Rats and Clowns” follows in much the same vein, with a greasy guitar riff leading into a tight blues rock shuffle. Rich’s style of guitar playing is immediately identifiable and I’m glad he’s back rocking and rolling with the Crowes after years of quieter experimentation. The band haven’t lost their groove after all that time away.\n\n“Cross Your Fingers” has a hushed vocal and acoustic intro before a mid-tempo stop-start riff kicks in and Chris starts singing about a relationship that seems toxic from both sides. It’s a great tune, but my personal favourite tune on the album has to be lead single “Wanting and Waiting.” An all-round fantastic tune that sits comfortably alongside the likes of “Twice as Hard” and “Jealous Again,” the latter of which seems to slightly inform the new single musically. Great guitar work, vocals, lyrics, keyboard work, and groove… everything just works.\n\nNashville star Lainey Wilson features on the acoustic ballad “Wilted Rose” to mix a little country edge to proceedings, and she harmonizes with Chris really well here. I’m not too familiar with her work but I’ll be checking it out on the strength of this track alone. Soon the song builds and transcends into Zeppelin-esque grandeur, and Wilson sounds fantastic. “Dirty Cold Sun” hits the sweet spot on a swampy groove courtesy of a tight-but-loose rhythm section, and “Bleed It Dry” glides along with some tasty slide guitar work courtesy of Rich and an achingly soulful vocal from Chris. The brothers should do more like this.\n\nCalling ‘Happiness Bastards’ a return to form isn’t quite right. What it is, however, is a glorious ode to rock n’ roll and a wonderful reunion of two brothers with a pure love for this kind of music that seeps into every layer of this album. There are some life lessons to be learned here, but it also acts as a perfect summer barbeque record too. Get a few friends by the fire, and this would make an excellent soundtrack to the night. Hopefully this is the start of a new chapter in the Crowes story and they can maintain what they have right now. Fifteen years is a long time. As Chris sings on the opening track, with friends like these… who needs enemies?\n\nVideo:\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01. Bedside Manners\n\n02. Rats and Clowns\n\n03. Cross Your Fingers\n\n04.
