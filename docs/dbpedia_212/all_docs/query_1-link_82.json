        "text": "Lamb of God are set to unleash their first new album in five years this May, but guitarist Mark Morton has been quite prolific in the lead up to its release. In addition to issuing his first solo album, Anesthetic, last year, he just dropped a new solo EP titled Ether back in January.\n\nThe mostly acoustic EP features three original songs, including the single “All I Had to Lose”, along with covers of The Black Crowes’ “She Talks to Angels” (featuring Lzzy Hale on vocals) and Pearl Jam’s “Black” (featuring singer Mark Morales).\n\nWe recently caught up with Morton to discuss the Ether EP. The guitarist talked to us about working with Lzzy Hale on “She Talks to Angels”, saying she “knocked it out of the park.” As for his decision to cover “Black” from Pearl Jam’s vast catalog, Morton explained, “I think that song is one of the great songs from that era of music, that early and mid ’90s era of grunge and alternative … “Black’ is one of the standout songs of that era.”\n\nWhile we spoke with Morton just prior to Lamb of God announcing their new self-titled album, the guitarist gave us a general idea of what to expect from the effort, telling us “there’s a new energy in the band.”\n\nWatch our interview with Mark Morton in the video player above, and order or stream the guitarist’s recent EP, Ether, from various outlets."
