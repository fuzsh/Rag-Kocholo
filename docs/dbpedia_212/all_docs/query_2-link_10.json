I also enjoy more blues based jam bands like Govt Mule and The Allman Brothers. Traditional jam bands like The Grateful Dead, Phish, Widespread Panic and others have never done much for me. The Chris Robinson Brotherhood lies somewhere in between the above mentioned styles for me. Robinson, of course, is the former lead vocalist for The Black Crowes, a band that I always liked and enjoyed live. The CRB is definitely more jam oriented than the Crowes were. I have 3 of their albums and like them to varying degrees. The band put on a 3 hour concert (with intermission), with no opening act at Bells Brewery Beer Garden Friday night. The show was sold out and there were more people than I had ever seen at the venue for a show in the past. The show was good, but to be honest I got a bit board with it after a while. Some of the bands songs are really strong (Tulsa Yesterday is a good example), and like most jam bands, they do some covers in the set, but overall it just gets a bit samey to my ears. Robinsons voice is still great, but unlike with the Black Crowes where he was a front man working the stage, in the CRB he played rhythm guitar all night, and only spoke to the audience very briefly. The rest of the band are all good musicians, although they could have used a riser for the keyboard player and drummer as it was difficult to see them all night. It was a gorgeous evening for an outdoor show, and of course having fresh Bells beer on tap is a bonus in itself. In the end, I enjoyed this show, but it did not blow me away. I probably would not go see them again, but most people in the crowd seemed to eat it up so what do I know. Here is the set list:\n\nNEW CANNOBALL RAG\n\nEAGLES ON THE HIGHWAY\n\nBEGGARS MOON\n\nTULSA YESTERDAY\n\nTHE MUSICS HOT (SLIM HARPO COVER)\n\nROAN COUNTRY BANJO\n\nSTAR OR STONE\n\nHELLO L.A., BYE BYE BIRMINGHAM (DELANEY BRAMLETT COVER)\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nNARCISSUS SOAKING WET\n\nRARE BIRDS\n\nHARE, THE HERALD HERMIT SPEAKS\n\nIF YOU HAD A HEART TO BREAK\n\nGIRL I LOVE YOU\n\nSHORE POWER\n\nGOT LOVE IF YOU WANT IT (SLIM HARPO COVER)\n\nENCORE\n\nSWEET VIRGINIA (ROLLING STONES COVER)"
