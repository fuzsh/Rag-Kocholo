        "text": "The relationship between brothers Chris and Rich Robinson, the founding singer and guitarist, respectively, of the Black Crowes, has endured its share of ups and downs over the decades. On Tuesday, Oct. 1, for the first of their two consecutive nights at the Civic Theatre downtown, the brothers, like the rest of the Black Crowes, appeared to be in a good place.\n\nDuring a cover of the Rolling Stones’ “Torn and Frayed,” Chris and Rich strummed acoustic guitars and harmonized. They locked eyes to better navigate the song, which they apparently hadn’t played previously on the current tour. The result was an exceptionally well-assembled arrangement, a breezy, back porch Southern rock singalong.\n\nThat “Torn and Frayed” was originally released in 1972 by a British band trying to sound Southern was somehow appropriate. The Black Crowes were dismissed early on in some quarters as ‘70s rock wannabes. But now they have found their place as a rock band steeped in Southern soul and snarling guitars, one that is claimed in part by the jam-band community (how could that community resist the stoned crow logo?).\n\nNo two Black Crowes set lists are ever alike, and onstage improvisations are encouraged. The Crowes, however, flex far more muscle than many jam bands; they tilt toward the heavier, Allman Brothers end of the spectrum. At times on Tuesday, they seemed to be channeling the Allmans via guitar solos that alternately chirped and soared. “Another Roadside Tragedy” included an especially Allman-esque pivot in which the tempo dropped to clear the way for a guitar solo over a bed of organ.\n\nThe Black Crowes' 2013 tour follows a two-year hiatus. On Tuesday, the Civic wasn't full; the venue's upper balcony wasn't even open. Perhaps $65 was too steep a ticket price for a mid-week show by a band that had already passed through New Orleans once this year, during the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.\n\nWith no new album to promote, the Black Crowes are free to trot out deep cuts and favorites by other artists. Of the 19 songs on Tuesday's set list, seven were originally recorded by other artists (though Otis Redding's \"Hard to Handle\" is synonymous with the Black Crowes, thanks to their hit 1990 version).\n\nIn a nod to New Orleans, they opened with a cover of the Byrds’ “Lover of the Bayou.” “Under a Mountain,” a relative obscurity from the “Three Snakes and One Charm” album, followed. They continued with early favorites “Sting Me” and “Twice As Hard.” For the latter, they extended the closing guitar riff, boring into it.\n\nFor the current tour, Jackie Greene replaced Luther Dickinson as lead guitarist. Greene, a veteran of Phil Lesh’s band, was not as bold as Dickinson in his soloing, but held his own. His slide guitar lit up “Black Moon Creeping,” among others.\n\nThe boogie-woogie piano of “Let Me Share the Ride” led to a Chris Robinson harmonica solo, which in turn gave way to a guitar-heavy jam. For “Whoa Mule,” drummer Steve Gorman – like the Robinson brothers, an original member of the band -- stepped out front with a hand drum as Greene switched to mandolin and Rich Robinson strummed an acoustic. A strong “She Talks to Angels,” with its sparkling lattice of mandolin and acoustic guitar, tumbled into an extended instrumental passage with a breakdown that evoked the Allmans’ “Jessica.”\n\nChris Robinson, barefoot and rail-thin, his head covered by a mop of hair and a thick beard, wasted no time on chit-chat beyond the occasional “thank you.” But he sang well, with gusto. When not needed at the microphone, he danced or deployed maracas and a tambourine."
