        "text": "Welcome to Flashlight & A Biscuit, my Southern culture/sports/music/food offshoot of my work at Yahoo Sports. Thanks for reading, and if you’re new around here, why not subscribe? It’s free and all.\n\nWay, way, way back in 1990, when I was but a wee pup just trying to break into the writing game, I got a freelance assignment from the Richmond Times-Dispatch to cover a performance by an up-and-coming rock band. Whenever I got these gigs, I’d try to get to the venue many hours early, to listen to the sound check and soak up the vibe.\n\nOn this particular day, as I walked up to the Flood Zone — a converted warehouse-turned-tiny-concert-hall in Richmond’s Shockoe Bottom district — I saw a blade-skinny dude lounging outside the venue’s side door, sporting a long coat, a frilly shirt with sleeves that extended almost to his fingertips, and a wide floppy velvet driver’s cap. The dude was blazing up something fierce; smoke hung around his head like a Christmas wreath, and he had several women lingering on his every word. This was Chris Robinson, lead singer of the Black Crowes, and at that moment he looked like the coolest man alive.\n\nHe also looked like a man severely out of place. This was 1990, and Bart Simpson t-shirts and jorts ruled the day. Hair metal bands like Mötley Crüe and Poison still owned rock n’ roll, and the grunge era of Nirvana and Pearl Jam was still months away from breaking big.\n\nBut here was Robinson, dressed like some faded English dandy in tax exile. He was trying his best to turn Richmond, Virginia into the south of France, even if nobody outside of him was playing along. The Crowes were just starting to pick up steam off their monumental Shake Your Money Maker debut — you know, the one with “Hard To Handle” and “She Talks To Angels.” Within a few months, they’d be the biggest band on the planet — for a few weeks, anyway — but right at this moment, it looked like Halloween had come a little early to Shockoe Bottom.\n\nThe Crowes — who just released a new album, which is why I’m writing this, but we’ll get to that in a bit — formed in Atlanta, and based the entirety of their identity on the turn-of-the-’70s, Exile on Main Street-era Stones. Grimy guitars, train-kept-a-rollin’ rhythm section, yelped lyrics of celebration and regret, barroom piano, a mournful Hammond B-3 organ … the Crowes mainlined a kind of blues rock that was dead and gone after the synth-laden ‘80s blew through.\n\nHere’s the mindblowing thing: The Crowes, in 1990, were biting off a culture that reached its apex in about 1970. Back then, the era of the Stones/Faces/Zeppelin seemed like another era. But if it were today, the 2024 equivalent of the Black Crowes would be ripping off the early-2000s pop punk of Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco. (Related: We are all old.)\n\nThe Crowes released one magnificent album (Shake Your Money Maker), one epic (The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, which has their best song, “Hotel Illness”) … and then things started to go sideways. The Crowes were right there on the verge of becoming one of the greatest American rock n’ roll bands in history … right up until everything fell apart. No, wait, that passive-voice construction doesn’t quite hit the mark. Right up until they blew everything apart.\n\nFronted by the Robinson brothers — the aforementioned Chris, and also Rich — the Crowes went through the typical lead singer-lead guitarist who’s-running-the-show drama … but unlike the Stones, the Crowes weren’t able to see the bigger picture. For their next album, Amorica (which features their second-best song, “Descending”), Chris demanded a cover taken straight from an old Hustler magazine featuring a closeup of a woman’s American-flag bikini with pubic hair clearly visible around the edges. Not exactly the most commercially viable record cover, as you can imagine.\n\nMatters devolved from there, as best recounted by former drummer Steve Gorman in his exceptional autobiography “Hard to Handle.” Short version: the Robinson brothers had a golden goose in their hands and they somehow managed to strangle it and stomp it into feathers. Granted, they did step onto the tracks right as the grunge train was bearing down on them, but still … you’ll want to throw the book across the room at all the Crowes’ missed opportunities — like the time Jimmy Page, of all people, wanted to help the Crowes get back on track toward immortality, and they basically spit on his offer.\n\nAnyway, now that they’ve pretty much exhausted every other option — and everyone else in their lives, probably — the Robinson brothers are back together, and they’ve just released Happiness Bastards, their first album together in well over a decade. They’re the only two left over from the original band, which is both appropriate and tragic.\n\nThere’s an easy familiarity to the Crowes’ music, particularly if you grew up on rock n’ roll. Check out “Wanting and Waiting,” the first single off the album, which locks into a recognizable groove and doesn’t let go for four minutes. The group-sung chorus, “I’m nothing but lonely, waiting and wanting, wanting and waiting for you,” would sound just fine pretty much any year from 1969 to today:\n\nAnd that might be the whole issue right there. The Crowes found a style and a groove that fits them, and they’ve largely stuck to that pretty much ever since. Even the Stones, who also just released an album of new material last year, brought in a thirtysomething producer to give their songs a present-day feel. Happiness Bastards would give you the same feel whether it was played on an LP in 1974, a cassette tape in 1984, a CD in 1994, an MP3 ripped off Napster in 2004, or Spotify in 2024. They’ve been around long enough that the style of music they were aping in 1990 has come and gone a couple times now.\n\nIt’s a fascinating question for any artist, how much to change with the times and how much to stick with your own original vision. Try to keep up with the trends, and you risk coming off as inauthentic, try-hard and goofy, losing your audience in the process. Try to stick with a proven formula, though, and you’ll find yourself appealing to the same, ever-dwindling group of diehards.\n\nIf those diehards are a large enough cohort — for, say, Phish or Grateful Dead-adjacent bands — you can get away with playing the same tune, rearranged. But the worst-case scenario is that you end up with an audience that only wants to hear your old stuff, no matter how much you’d like to do something new.\n\nThe Crowes had a chance to come out from under the shadow of the Stones and chart the course of rock music for the ‘90s — the solo that starts at the 3:54 mark of “Jealous Again,” for instance, is one of my favorite guitar breaks ever, and it hits heights the Stones never even attempted. But the Crowes self-destructed, not just shooting themselves in the feet but sawing them off just to spite each other. I’m glad they’re back, but man, what could’ve been.\n\nSo if you happen to be fortunate enough to have created something beautiful, for the love of God, don’t screw it up. That magic doesn’t come along often.\n\nCrowdsourcing: Who’s your ride-or-die band? The one you’ll always follow no matter how badly they screw up?
