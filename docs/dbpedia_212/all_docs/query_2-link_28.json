        "text": "By Martine Ehrenclou\n\nIn the heat of the summertime, there’s something special about listening to Southern Rock or Roots-Rock music on your back porch with your favorite beverage in hand or with friends at a concert or backyard party. It just feels right. There’s something about the grit and groove of Southern Rock and Roots Rock that goes hand-in-hand with the best parts of Summer. Get out your headphones or stereo and crank it up. Blasting it out of a classic muscle car is even better. Now, you’re living.\n\nIn case you’re thinking that the only Southern Rock bands worth listening to are vintage stalwarts Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers, or The Marshall Tucker Band, we have some surprises for you. Here are 15 Southern Rock and Roots-Rock artists and bands you need to get up to speed on. Some you might already know but we’d be remiss not to include them. Some you probably don’t and that’s what we live for: turning you on to amazing new music.\n\nCompartmentalizing artists and bands into the Southern Rock category can be a little tricky. A few hit the bullseye with their mix of blues and 70s hard rock such as Skynyrd or the much newer The Georgia Thunderbolts but others blend soul, R&B, country, and even folk into their sound. Regardless, we believe you need to experience each one of these outstanding Southern Rock and Roots-Rock bands and artists. All of them have a sound based in the American South but some may have more rock, twang, or soul in their vibe than others. Personally, I enjoy bands that include flavors from other genres in their music and keep their craft evolving.\n\nI purposely did not include renowned bands such as Chris Stapleton, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Marshall Tucker Band, Kid Rock, Lucinda Williams, Tedeschi Trucks Band, and others because you’re already rocking to them. Today, we’re all about finding you some new jams to finish off your Summer.\n\nEach of these 15 bands is hand-picked. I genuinely think very highly of them and included their information, websites, and videos so you can sample their music and check out their worlds.\n\nBecause the pandemic put touring and more on hold for 15 months, musicians still need our help and concern. Please visit their websites and buy their music and merch, if you can. Sign up for their newsletters and subscribe to their YouTube channels. We didn’t get through the pandemic without music so we owe a debt of support to those who make it.\n\nI hope you enjoy every one of the acts you’re about to hear. Please put your favorites in the Comment Section below.\n\nThe Georgia Thunderbolts\n\nUshering in a new generation of classic Southern rock steeped in soul and the blues, The Georgia Thunderbolts hail from Rome, GA at the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.
