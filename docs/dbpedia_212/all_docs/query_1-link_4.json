        "text": "I don't think that the Crowes were ever really a 'jam band' more a band that jammed.\n\nThe jamming wasn't aimless noodling, but more of a structured instrumental used to prelude a song.\n\nEither way, and forgetting such semantics, here's some pro-shot footage which you should see. I have concentrated on the glory that was the Amorica Or Bust Tour in 1995.\n\nCologne 1995\n\nGlastonbury 1995\n\nShoreline Ampitheater 1995\n\nObviously there are hundreds of other examples out there, and lots of audience shot footage (most of which is very enjoyable) but search carefully - I recommend caution moving beyond 2006.\n\nThey were still good, but not 1995 good. They were the best live band on the planet for a time.\n\nBut, if you have a strong desire to see Wiser Time dragged kicking and screaming into a 25 minute long slog, search out the 2013 shows. (But don't).\n\nHopefully Badge will chime in with more definitive recommendations. I'd suggest focusing on the 1995-1997 shows. I'd need to thing hard on choices based on your op.\n\nThe Crowes as a jam band is a slippery slope in the convential sense although they do have many attributes of the genre, they are more traditional song structure oriented, have many other non-jam aspects and were never consumed by the idea, just influenced by and capable of it.\n\nThe ability to improvise, yes, but they did not deconstruct songs to the point they would morph into something unrecognizable.\n\nThe practice of a different set list every night, yes, this was one of their great attributes live and with their vast catalogue of unreleased songs and covers could create an absolutely unique in-the-moment night of music when they were inspired.\n\nEach member, being capable of soloing and taking the lead of a given section - less so in the bass dept - yes.\n\nA dedicated fan base that would follow them from show to show and expect many of the things a jam band fan would expect from doing so, yes.\n\nAllowing taping and trading of live shows, and putting as much emphasis on that as their studio albums, yes.\n\nGuest appearances during their sets by opening bands and musical friends, not as much thought their career, but yes.\n\nOpening for the Grateful Dead, dozens ng the Further your, covering the Dead minimally, and members playing with Phil and Friends, yes.\n\nDocumentation of the live records and band evolution via \"Deadbase\" type resources, yes.\n\nAs a starting point, any live My Morning Song or Thorn in My Pride that in the middle of a show will provide an example of how the Crowes and Jam intersect.\n\nI'll think about some specific shows for you...\n\nI'm not sure if much of their studio work I'd classify as \"jam band\". Live, some songs took different directions night to night, and you have some really great intros, middle breaks, or codas that were different night to night. Seeing them live, especially in the later years, I always liked watching Rich direct the improve -- was cool to watch him look for the breaks and either take the lead of turn it over the to next guy.\n\nThere are some great 1996 and 1997 shows available online for purchase -- excellent sound quality on these earlier shows. Two that stand out for me from memory\n\nBerlin: The Black Crowes - 1/29/97 BC Roadshow, Berlin, DE »\n\nPampolona: The Black Crowes - 2/8/97 BC Roadshow, Pamplona, ESP »\n\nEven in those two shows you have some longer improvisational sections and then some very concise, straight ahead tunes. I always liked a good extended Morning Song...I wished they'd played Nonfiction more straight forward, I always found that extended version sort of painful. Found the later day Thorn drum solo was a bit of a drag as well in recorded versions -- OK to see live, not so great as a listen afterwards."
