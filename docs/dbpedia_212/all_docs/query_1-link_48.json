        "text": "I can’t tell you how much we’ve been waiting for this new Black Crowes album down here at B&V. The phrase, “highly anticipated” doesn’t do it justice. Both the Rock Chick and I have been fans of the Crowes since their early days. The Black Crowes, formed by brothers Chris Robinson (vocals) and Rich Robinson (guitars) have had an up and down career. That can happen when brothers form bands. When the Crowes first started out, we thought they were the Stones of the 90s. They had a similar sound to the Stones or perhaps more accurately a sound similar to Stones’ acolytes Humble Pie and the Faces. We hoped they’d have the Stones’ longevity… Somewhere along the line the Crowes turned into a bit of jam band, or at least that was the impression many of us got. They broke up after 2001’s Lions and I’m not sure any of us were terribly surprised. If my brother and I had formed a band I’m sure he would have fired me a long time ago…\n\nHowever, by the time they broke up again in 2015, I’m not sure I even noticed. After reuniting in 2005 they’d put out two very solid albums – 2008’s Warpaint (which is sadly overlooked) and 2009’s Before The Frost…Until The Freeze. They’d recorded that latter double LP of new material, live in Levon Helm’s barn in front of an intimate crowd. I still don’t think that album was a jam band album. It was more rootsy than jammy? I think that whole jam band reputation comes more from Chris Robinson’s solo projects like the Chris Robinson Brotherhood. Not that there’s anything wrong with jam bands but I digress. The animosity between the brothers Robinson was so bad in 2015 I never thought they’d get back together.\n\nBut, and good for them as humans, they reconnected as brothers before they reconnected as band mates. I’m sure that made Thanksgiving less awkward and made their mother happy. Everybody wins. Eventually they decided, like you do, to get the band together. They were criticized for not involving any former members, especially erstwhile drummer Steve Gorman. But Gorman had written a tell-all book about the Black Crowes that wasn’t a terribly flattering portrait of the Robinson Brothers. They said when they first got back together that they were trying to keep influences who were “negative to their relationship” out of the band. Read that how you want. Sometimes you’ve got weigh the pro’s and cons of a relationship, especially in light of the chemistry within a band. Chemistry is so important and yet so fragile in a working rock n roll outfit.\n\nI think it’s safe to say at first the reunion was a tentative one. They intended to tour for the 30th anniversary of Shake Your Money Maker, their sensational debut album but then… Covid. I loved the deluxe edition of that album. In particular one of the outtakes from those sessions, “Charming Mess” is sensational. In light of their tour being cancelled they recorded a great, fun little EP of cover songs all from 1972, creatively titled 1972. I dug that little exercise. They did everything from Bowie to the Stones to Little Feat. It was fun but it could also be read as an experiment to see if their formerly combustible chemistry could take being in the studio together. With the release of their first album of all new material in 15 years, it seems the answer was yes, it could.\n\nThe Brothers Robinson did eventually get a former member of the Black Crowes back into the fold, bass player Sven Pippien. They augmented the line up with Erik Deutsch on keyboards, Cully Symington on drums and Nico Bereciartua on guitar. Sure, I’d like to see Weird Eddie Harsch back on keyboards, but alas I think he passed in 2016. The new album is called Happiness Bastards and was produced by Jay Joyce. Oddly, I have never heard of this producer. I hear he’s been tied to rootsy albums. I know he’s worked with Emmylou Harris, John Hiatt, and Cage The Elephant… although admittedly most his credits read country. Have no fear though, this is not a country album.\n\nI guess the Crowes had a choice to come back rocking or come back jamming and they chose to rock. I will admit, my first listen of Happiness Bastards didn’t grab me like I thought it would. Expectations can be tricky, and mine were pretty high. Sometimes though, you just have to commune with a new album – put it on the headphones… listen in the car… really spend some time with it. And I’ll tell you, the more I listened to this album the more I like it. I mean, if you’re looking for Southern Harmony And Musical Companion 2.0 – and considering the cover art is that album’s cover photo painted over like graffiti, so you could be forgiven for hoping for that – you’re likely going to be disappointed. Not many bands are gonna pull off a second Southern Harmony in a career. As mentioned the Crowes have definitely decided to come out swinging. It’s all guitars/drums/vocals with a few harmonica and keyboard accents. And in 2024 we need good ol’ solid rock n roll like this in our lives.\n\nI think one of the reasons I didn’t immediately connect with this album on first listen – it’s more of a “grower” – is because of the first two tracks, “Bedside Manners” and “Rats And Clowns.” They’ve grown on me, believe me, but on first listen it sounded like they were trying too hard. They’re both balls-to-the-wall rockers but like on Van Halen’s first album with Sammy, the songs “Good Enough” and “Get Up” sounded like they were trying too hard to establish chemistry with the new singer. So too, these first two Crowes tunes sounded a little like they were trying too hard to re-establish their chemistry. But, the more I listen to these songs the better they sound. “Rats And Clowns” may be aimed at former band members?\n\nThere are two, great rootsy, acoustic songs. I really dug “Kindred Friend,” the track that ends the record. It’s not “She Talks To Angels,” but it’s a nice upbeat strummer. I love the lyrics, “Sit at my table, let me fill your glass with something strong and fine, Stay forever or leave tonight, Thankful for the time…” Nothing better than sharing a glass of something dark and murky with an old pal. The other track is “Wilted Rose” and features country singer Lainey Wilson. I’ll be honest, I had to google her. Her contribution here is more of a harmony vocal, it’s not a duet. But again, I love my Crowes old style acoustic songs.\n\nWhen we get into the meat of this record, there is so much kick ass rock n roll to like. “Wanting And Waiting,” the first single, is just a great song. It’s a classic Black Crowes tune. “Cross Your Fingers,” the second single is a wild ride of a song. It starts acoustic and then turns into rocking funk, like they had too many ideas… but in a good way. “Dirty Cold Sun” is maybe my favorite… rocking guitars over an organ and a snarling vocal. Oh, yes the Crowes are back! “Bleed It Dry” is a fantastic blues song, complete with harmonica. It might end up on my Rockers Playing the Blues/Blues Rock playlist. I love that the Black Crowes still play the blues. “Flesh Wound” is another galloping rocker that should be played up loud.\n\nThe Crowes are back with a solid, if not completely sensational album of rock n roll. That, to me, is grounds for celebration. Two warring brothers, putting aside their feud and instead picking up instruments and making a glorious racket. Let’s all cross our fingers that this time the reunion holds and these guys continue to build that all important rock n roll chemistry. I know I’ll be keeping my eyes on the tour for this album… I haven’t seen them since the By Your Side Tour…\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s no secret that I’ve been a huge fan of the Black Crowes since I first heard “Jealous Again” while I was driving around in my car in 1990. Granted, it wasn’t until I heard “Hard To Handle” that I drove to the record store and bought their landmark debut Shake Your Money Maker, but man am I glad I did. We shared our thoughts on that great debut album’s 30th Anniversary box previously. The Black Crowes were our new Stones for the 90s, or so we thought. They stood out to me because they played solid blues rock – very Faces, Humble Pie, Stonesy – in a world full of Grunge. In a universe of flannel shirts, they had leather pants on.\n\nBut alas, as I wrote in my piece The Mark of Cain: When Brothers Form Bands, when siblings form bands it can sometimes lead to some explosive chemistry. The Brothers Robinson were no exception to that sad rule… Much like the Brothers Gallagher in Oasis, their battles were legendary. (Liam does have a great new song out right now by the way, with ex-Stone Roses’ guitarist John Squire, “Just Another Rainbow”). The Crowes broke up shortly after putting out 2001’s Lions but reunited in 2008 and put out a couple of strong late career records but the reunion didn’t “hold.” Frankly, I thought that was it for the Black Crowes.\n\nBut then, in late 2019 (I believe, my timeline for what happened pre and post COVID is a bit off) I read in a magazine that the brothers had tried to rebuild their relationship as brothers, as human beings. If they could do that they might consider a band reunion. Thankfully for the Robinson Family Thanksgivings, the two managed to sort out their personal relationship. They were going to tour in 2020 to celebrate the aforementioned Shake Your Money Maker‘s 30th Anniversary but, pandemic. There were signs of life for the band, however. Late in ’20 they released “Back Door Santa,” a Xmas song even I can get behind and I don’t love Xmas songs. In ’21 we got the box for Shake Your Money Maker and there were some great outtakes and a live concert that everyone should hear. In ’22 they released a great EP of cover songs from ‘72 entitled, creatively 1972. It was clear the reunion was holding but they were taking only tentative steps toward new music.\n\nAfter celebrating their fabulous second album last fall with a deluxe box, Southern Harmony & Musical Companion – Super Deluxe, the rumors began that new Crowes music was on the way. Last Friday we finally got some new Black Crowes when they released their first new song in 15 years. The new track is “Wanting And Waiting,” which describes my feelings about new Crowes music… I’ve been wanting it but man I have been waiting a long time. It turns out, it was worth the wait!\n\nAs far as personnel on this song/album, I know that Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar) and former Crowes member Sven Pippien (bass) play on the song. Sven is apparently the only past member invited to the reunited version of the band. I assume that the folks who played on 1972 played on this record, but with the mercurial Robinsons, who knows: Isaiah Mitchell (guitars), Joel Robinow (keyboards), and Brian Griffin (drums). Of course, Rich could be playing all the guitar parts. I’ve scoured the internet but couldn’t come up with any answers…\n\n“Wanting And Waiting” starts off with a grinding, galloping guitar. When the organ kicks in the song just soars. I have to admit when I first heard it it had echos of “Jealous Again,” in a good way. Chris Robinson is in his usual fine vocal form. I love the big chorus. This isn’t a sad song about waiting for a lover… it’s more of an energetic expression of one man’s frustration. Who likes waiting anyway? I may have to put this track on my Waiting Playlist. “I’m nothing but lonely, waiting and wanting, wanting and waiting for you…” I think we’ve all been there. This track even has some backup vocalists ala Southern Harmony’s best tracks. I just love this song. What a great way to reintroduce themselves. Here’s the track:\n\nTurn this one up loud! There are several new songs that have come out of late, including the Liam Gallagher/John Squire track I mentioned earlier but “Wanting And Waiting” is my favorite of the bunch. Who among us couldn’t use a little more blues rock in our lives these days.\n\nCheers and stay warm out there… I don’t remember I saw the sun…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Black Crowes have just released a box set for their landmark second album – and how many second albums can we say that about, that it’s a classic? – Southern Harmony And Musical Companion. The box is modeled much the same way as the Shake Your Money Maker – 30th Anniversary box from a few years ago in that it’s a three disc box with the original album, a disc of outtakes and finally a concert disc from the “High As The Moon Tour” from 1992-1993. I still wonder why I didn’t include the Crowes and Southern Harmony on my list of bands who defied the “sophomore slump.” Maybe because their debut album was so strong? While I love this album and if you don’t own it this is a nice package, I do think the box is flawed. And at (currently) $97, it’s a bit pricey for a three disc set.\n\nAs I have stated before, I got on the Crowes band wagon in 1990, shortly after I’d returned from my corporate exile in Northwest Arkansas. I remember hearing “Jealous Again” in my car and that was all it took. I may have even heard this song when I still lived in Arkansas. However, I did wait until I heard their Otis Redding cover “Hard To Handle” before I headed down to the CD store in Westport to pick up the album. Man, am I glad I did. Blues rock had largely been supplanted in the 80s by Hair Metal. Those bands all wanted to look and sound like Van Halen – few did – and that wonderful connection to rock’s roots in the blues was severed. When the Crowes surfaced, they took me back to that classic Stones/Faces vibe that I sooo love. The Stones are my Alpha and Omega. In a world dominated at the time by Grunge, here was a band singing the blues and lamenting how they were “Seeing Things.” Oh, yes!\n\nBy May 12th in 1992 I was home in Kansas City and in that classic successful phase of life known as, “Moved back in with my parents.” So I can only guess that my first time hearing the first single “Remedy” had to be in the car. Mom didn’t appreciate high volume rock n roll the same way I did. She almost had a heart attack when I played some Sabbath at full volume… I didn’t know she was home…Anyway, at the time I remember reading in Rolling Stone magazine that the Crowes were putting out their second album. I was primed for some new Crowes but second albums can be difficult… the sophomore slump is real. As ready as I was for new Crowes in 1992, I was not emotionally prepared for the power of that first single, “Remedy.” God, what a song! It leaped from the speakers and grabbed me by the lapel and slapped my face. That riff was huge and heavy and wonderful. I steered the car immediately to the record store. I remember visiting a guy I knew in Dallas at the time and I couldn’t stop singing “Remedy.” I kept blowing the lyric, “Baby, baby why you dye your hair…” and I was singing, at the top of my lungs, “Baby, baby why you dry your hair…” Yes, there was drink involved. It’s hard to stay sober in Texas.\n\nThe first half of Southern Harmony is about as good as the Crowes ever got. And believe it’s sublime rock n roll, dripping with blues feel. The opener “Sting Me” did just that. That track led to “Remedy,” my favorite Crowe’s tune. But just when you’d been pummeled into submission, in a good way, here comes the acoustic guitars (which weren’t heard a lot back then outside of the Unplugged Series) with “Thorn In My Pride.” “Bad Luck Blue Eyes, Goodbye” perhaps my favorite of their bluesy stuff, follows and at that point I’m in need of a shot of bourbon and fan. After that they just rock out. Listening to the entire album yesterday while I drove down to the DMV (yet again), it was those deeper, harder rock tracks that grabbed my ear. “Hotel Illness” was always a favorite. “Black Moon Creeping” is a sledgehammer of a rock song as is “No Speak No Slave.” “My Morning Song” is a great slide riff. There’s not a bad moment on this album. And then, just to freak me out, they cover a deep track of Bob Marley’s, “Time Will Tell.” Acoustic reggae on a blues rock album, Hell, yes!\n\nAs mentioned, the first disc in the box is the original album in all it’s glory. It’s been remastered and as usual they’ve cranked up the sound to 11 so it’s pretty damn loud aka “brickwalled.” But if you’ve never owned the album it’s still a great listen. Disc 2, for me is usually where the gold is found. Although, and this is where I think this disc is flawed, there’s only 9 tracks on the outtakes disc. I have to think these guys were on such a roll they had more in the can than just these 9 tracks. The last four tracks are “In Studio Live” versions of tracks on the album: “Sting Me (Slow),” “Sometimes Salvation,” “Blue Eyes Bad Luck, Goodbye” and “Black Moon Creeping.” Those are nice to have but far from essential. The “Sting Me (Slow)” version is one that I already had as bonus track. It is, as advertised, a “slow” version of “Sting Me” which is interesting.\n\nHalf the bonus disc filled with “In Studio Live” is just meh for me. However, that said there are 5 nice outtakes that every Crowes fan will dig. “99 Pounds” is quintessential Crowes, but it has been released prior to this and yes, I already have the song. “Miserable,” which I reviewed earlier, is a great track. I like the slow burn blues track more each time I hear it… and it does explode into a jam at the end. They do a ripping “In Studio Live” cover of Dylan’s “Rainy Day Woman No 12 & 35,” (the “everybody must get stoned” song). I do so love Dylan covers… “Boomer’s Story” is a nice bluesy number. It would have fit perfectly on the album. I really like this song. “Darling Of The Underground Press” is an acoustic blues number that knocks me out. Over bluesy acoustic there are stabs of electric guitar. As much as I love “Time Will Tell,” (nobody covers Bob Marley!), I would have rather had this track on the finished album.\n\nDisc 3 is a concert from the tour for Southern Harmony, which was known as the “High As The Moon” tour. This was the first tour me and my friends saw the Crowes and man, were they awesome. As an aside, the Rock Chick saw the Crowes on their first tour when they opened for Aerosmith. She said she was more impressed with the Crowes that night than she was with Aerosmith. There’s a reason I call her the Rock Chick, but I digress. I saw pretty much the same setlist as they played in Houston, where this concert was recorded… this was only a couple of weeks before we – Storm Cat, the Accountant and I – saw them. Storm Cat liked the show so much a few months later he jumped in a car with two stoner cooks from where he worked and drove up to St Joseph, Missouri to see it again… kudo’s Storm!\n\nNo one is a bigger fan of a live album culled from the then current tour that bands put into these box sets than I am. It’s also usually where the gold is. Guns N Roses shows from the Use Your Illusions tour is a case in point. I don’t know how many times I’ve walked out of a concert and thought, “that should be the live album, just release this show.” Of course nowadays, bands actually do that. I purchased the Springsteen show I saw in February here in KC right after I saw the show and I love that live album! There was a real opportunity for the Crowes on this live disc. However, they edited all the Shake Your Money Maker live songs from the concert off this disc. They also did a Bob Marley cover that night and they cut it off. You get each Southern Harmony track live plus a “Jam” they put together. It’s good but as they say down south, it’s like kissing your sister. If they’d released the whole show I’d be 100% in. It doesn’t help that the bootleg of the entire show has been out there for 30 years… Sigh. They blew this one. Give us the whole concert – especially at $97!\n\nAs much as I love the Black Crowes – I even loved the EP they did last year 1972 – I can’t recommend this box as a purchase. First and foremost, it’s too expensive. The price may come down after the first of the year so keep an eye out and you may get it cheaper. The outtakes disc is far too short and contains too many “In Studio Live” songs that are already on the LP in a superior version. And finally, they edited the concert down which is, in this Rock Historian/Complete-ist view, a sin. This is going to be a set that you’ll want to stream – especially those first 5 outtakes – and the concert. While disappointing as edited, the live performance is still somethin’. This is some peak Black Crowes on these slender discs.\n\nCheers and Happy Holidays!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOh my, now we’re talkin’ ’bout the good stuff!!\n\nIt was about two and half years ago that the Black Crowes, perennial favorites around here at B&V, put out a 30th Anniversary Edition of their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker. It was a great little package of the original album, outtakes/b-sides and a full concert from that tour. But then I love that album and debut albums in general. In 1992, the Black Crowes followed up that landmark 1990 debut by defying the “sophomore slump” and delivering an even better album with The Southern Harmony And Musical Companion. That’s often a difficult thing to do. So many bands have foundered on the rocks of the “difficult second album,” as Bono described it in his Rock Hall of Fame acceptance speech. And indeed, U2 is a prime example of the sophomore slump. There’s a cliche in rock music that goes: you have your whole life to write your first album and six months to write and record your second one.\n\nI was still watching MTV in 1992, although at the time I was going through that successful period of life known as “moving back in with your parents,” and I know they didn’t have MTV. My dad would barely spring for basic cable. Anyway I saw the Crowes lead singer Chris Robinson being interviewed and he said something along the lines of, “We just set up and played live in the studio… we wanted to be eyeball to eyeball and just vibe the thing.” I thought that was cool but was still worried… I really liked these guys and I wanted them to succeed. I tend to root for rock bands the same way some people root for NFL teams or soccer, er I mean football, teams.\n\nOn December 1st the Crowes will release a Super Deluxe box set for Southern Harmony and it looks very similar to the Shake Your Money Maker package. It’s got the original album, outtakes/b-sides and part of a live concert from that tour. Coincidentally that was the first tour I saw the Black Crowes with my buddy Stormin’ at venerable Memorial Hall over in Kansas City, Kansas… not a bad seat in the house. To tease the new box they’ve released two songs that didn’t make the original album – an outtake, “Miserable,” and a b-side called “99 Pounds.” Had they released this last year, it would have likely been called a “30th Anniversary” package but I guess the brothers Robinson steering the Black Crowes ship decided to instead release their great EP 1972.\n\nThe first track I listened to was “Miserable.” Now I will admit to you, it didn’t grab me the way that the first Shake Your Money Maker (30th Anniversary) single “Charming Mess” did. But then “Charming Mess” sounded like it could be the Faces, and I love the Faces. But with “Miserable” you do get a classic sounding blues rock track and you will never hear me complain about that! It really sounds akin to what came out on the album. Thick, bluesy riffs, and Chris Robinson’s blues rock vocals. It’s a slow, almost mournful riff, like waking up hungover on a Sunday morning… but then at the ends kicks into high gear in a fast jam with Marc Ford and Rich Robinson digging in on guitar. It’s got some great piano from the late great Eddie Harsch. And who can argue with a lyric like “3 a.m. again, here I am, good for nothing, punched a hole in the wall… I might get up, go on out and paint the whole God damn town red…” Yeah, I’ve been there… it’s been a while… but oh, have I been there.\n\n“99 Pounds,” in the interest of full disclosure is a tune I’m familiar with. It’s been out there for a while. This is a new mix. I think they originally put it out as a bonus track on “deluxe” CD versions of their original LPs. It’s a good rockin’ song. In this mix I hear the back up singers – the incomparable Barbara MItchell and Taj Harmon – more clearly on this new mix. I love what those ladies brought to this entire album so it’s nice to hear them more clearly. If “99 Pounds” doesn’t get you up and movin’ across the floor, nothing will… Here is a link to the tracks:\n\nI can only hope we get the same quality of outtakes and b-sides on this box as we got from the Shake Your Money Maker set. There were some great covers on that box – Lennon’s “Jealous Guy” and Humble Pie’s “30 Days In The Hole.” I already have some concerns about the concert they’re including but I’ll save those thoughts for when the box comes out. It’s probably going to be a streaming only kind of set as the prices I’ve seen on the box are steep. For now, crank these two tracks up with a little southern sour mash and enjoy your upcoming Thanksgiving holiday… if you’re in the States.\n\nCheers! (No politics this Thanksgiving… unless you’re debating whose running the Stones, Keith or Mick?)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
