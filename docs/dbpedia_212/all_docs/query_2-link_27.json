        "text": "well now thats a hard question man!!\n\ni myself have a very wide music tatse......funk, soul, ska, punk, indie, rock...\n\nand with PJ bein my fave band, indeed since i was 13...waaaaaaaay back\n\nif i was to suggest one act it may not be what ya want.....then again u\n\ndont really want to listen to bands who sound like PJ do ya?? would that\n\nnot get a bit boring??\n\nanyway rock bands i like: Therapy?.........Pixies....the Hold Steady......\n\nnot PJ sounding but excellent!\n\n26/10/96 dublin\n\n01/06/00 dublin\n\n23/08/06 dublin\n\n11/09/06 paris\n\n18/06/07 london\n\n17/08/09 manchester\n\n18/08/09 london\n\n0\n\nThe Tragically Hip\n\nWintersleep\n\nThe Hold Steady\n\nMatt Mays & El Torpedo\n\nSam Roberts\n\nDrive-By Truckers\n\nThe Black Crowes\n\nNone of these bands sound like Pearl Jam, but they all kick ass.\n\n\"I try my best to chug, stomp, weep, whisper, moan, wheeze, scat, blurt, rage, whine, and seduce. With my voice I can sound like a girl, the boogieman, a Theremin, a cherry bomb, a clown, a doctor, a murderer. I can be tribal. Ironic. Or disturbed. My voice is really my instrument.\"\n\n-Tom Waits\n\n0\n\nit seems like alot of PJ fans have a very wide variety in our taste in music. heres some bands you might consider if you like pearl jam:\n\nSoundgarden\n\nAlice in Chains\n\nAudioslave\n\nDave Matthews Band (only because they also seem to have a strong fanbase and alot live recordings like PJ)\n\nSmashing Pumpkins\n\nThe Who\n\nRadiohead\n\nand i also happen to like rush, primus, and dream theater. although they sound nothing like PJ.\n\n5/28/06, 6/27/08, 10/28/09, 5/18/10, 5/21/10\n\n8/7/08, 6/9/09\n\n0\n\nwolfbear wrote:\n\nExactly what I was going to say.\n\nReally, they might have a song or two similar to another band but I just cant think of anybody that I would say are like them as a whole. I cant believe some of the bands people are naming as similar to them, this thread must be a joke or something.\n\nAlpine Valley 2000\n\nSummerfest 2006\n\n\"Why would they come to our concert just to boo us?\" -Lisa Simpson\n\n0\n\npjoasisrule wrote:\n\nReally, they might have a song or two similar to another band but I just cant think of anybody that I would say are like them as a whole. I cant believe some of the bands people are naming as similar to them, this thread must be a joke or something.\n\nYep, they are rock, but unique and diverse which is what drew me to them in the\n\nfirst place.\n\n\"I'd rather be with an animal.\" \"Those that can be trusted can change their mind.\" \"The in between is mine.\" \"If I don't lose control, explore and not explode, a preternatural other plane with the power to maintain.\" \"Yeh this is living.\" \"Life is what you make it.\"\n\n0\n\nI have always thought My Morning Jacket was a similar band to Pearl jam. I say that because both bands are just putting their own flavor on classic rock. sure each band does it a little different you don't want them to be an exact copy but they both jam. MMJ lyrics are not as good as pj's but they are not horrible.\n\nAlso for more old school smashing pumpkins, stone temple pilots, and others were similar.\n\nBuilt to Spill gets mentioned often. i don't think they are anything like pearl jam really but they are a great band and for some reason pj fans seem to dig them. Maybe it is the sonic patterns in the guitar sounds. When i was 19 a person i met told me if i like pearl jam i'll love BtS. Got the album was not blown away by it. A few years later i checked them out again and they are one of my fav bands now.\n\nCharlotte 00\n\nCharlotte 03\n\nAsheville 04\n\nAtlanta 12\n\nGreenville 16, Columbia 16\n\nSeattle 18\n\nNashville 22\n\n0\n\nMost of the bands people are mentioning here are either A) Already known by anyone who used to be under the VH1 spell (back when it was at least a bit good), or dont sound like PJ at all.\n\nI mean, even if PJ has a sound all to their own, honestly...Audioslave? Come on guys (not that I have anything against Audioslave. Their first album was interesting. Second one was boring as hell)\n\nAnd my ideals go against listening to Smashing Pumpkins (sorry if it bothers you guys haha Im just not that much into such an alternative sound)\n\nI just consider PJ to be a modern day The Who, if you can believe that. Some guys have mentioned bands here that I will look into, if they have that classic rock jam vibe PJ has. They also have a seriousness to their sound...most bands Ive listened to that people compare them with just sound...teen-ish. While PJ has always had this mature quality to it. It doesn't sound pop AT ALL. They never were these kids living with mom trying to make sense of the world (which seems to be the trend in most of these weird, rock indie bands I mostly see around. No offense, that's just my interpretation)\n\nIf the bands mentioned here dont work, I may just then stick to stoner/doom as my straight rock fix (besides PJ of course)\n\n0"
