        "text": "Well, I did see Queen jam a very long time ago when they had a bad reception just after Seven Seas came out - we're talking 1973 or so here - and they weren't in any way famous at that time. I'm told by my daughter who was there that at the Reading festival in the UK a couple of years ago when someone called 50 Cent was booed off the stage that Green Day jammed away for an hour or so to fill in time - not what you'd expect I guess.\n\nIratowns\n\nGhost Trane\n\nEmma Gibbs Band\n\nBlueground Undergrass\n\n...Yes, I know most people have never heard of these bands and 3/4 of them have broken up, but they were the greatest! You missed out!\n\nI love bands the jam/improvise. Let it all hang out and hope it works. If a band is playing it safe, chances are pretty good I'll be bored. The problem is, most of the more popular jam bands just don't do it for me in the songwriting dept.. Phish had some great songs early on, but most made me say \"Please stop singing and just play\".\n\nMy list:\n\nGrateful Dead\n\nMedeski, Martin, and Wood (although they tend to noodle too much these days)\n\nClub d'Elf\n\nHow 'bout The Who? Live at Leeds is some serious jamming."
