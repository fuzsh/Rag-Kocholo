        "text": "The first sound you hear, on the first song, on the first Black Crowes album is Rich Robinson’s guitar.\n\nWithin eight seconds, Robinson’s swaying Keef-meets-Malcolm-Young intro to “Twice As Hard” sets the tone for the entire “Shake Your Money Maker” LP.\n\nBluesy hard-rock with swagger and soul.\n\nReleased early 1990, “Shake Your Money Maker” had the roots to connect with listeners whose classic-rock fire was restoked by The Rolling Stones’ massive 1989 reunion tour and “Steel Wheels” album. But the “Money Maker” mix of riffs, deft hooks and Rich’s brother Chris Robinson’s howling vocals were also present-tense enough to connect with fans of more metallic contemporary bands, like Guns N’ Roses and Motley Crue.\n\nThat crossover, as well as the Crowes blossoming into an exciting live band on tour with legends like Aerosmith and Robert Plant, resulted in “Shake Your Money Maker” selling more than five million copies. Rockers like “Twice As Hard” and “Jealous Again” dialed in the spectacularly shambolic sounds of ‘70s Stones and Faces records.\n\nChris sang like Humble Pie’s Steve Marriott and moved like Jagger. Rich introduced Keith Richards’ Open G guitar-tuning moves to the whammy-bar generation. Drummer Steve Gorman and Johnny Colt did grooves you could chase trouble to. Lead guitarist Jeff Cease played solos you could hum. Stones keyboardist Chuck Leavell, an Allman Brothers Band alumni who grew up in Tuscaloosa, was brought in as a studio musician to add piano and organ to “SYMM.”\n\nIn a 2018 interview, Chris told me it was his idea for the Crowes to cover Otis Redding’s ‘60s soul saunter “Hard To Handle.” “Money Maker” producer George Drakoulias recommended the band accelerate Redding’s song to an Aerosmith-y, “Walk This Way” pace. It was a deft move. “Hard To Handle” blew up on radio and, back then more importantly, MTV. The Crowes’ next single “She Talks To Angels” wasn’t a power-ballad but rather a powerful ballad in a more timeless rock sense. “Angels” expanded the band’s reach even further.\n\nDuring the “Shake Your Money Maker” album cycle, The Black Crowes were a musical guest on “Saturday Night Live,” then still a big way for rock bands to reach new fans. They periodically made the news for their singer’s bad-boy behavior, most notably for getting kicked off a Miller Lite-sponsored ZZ Top tour for onstage diatribes against corporate sponsorship. Rolling Stone put the young band on their cover with the headline “What’s So Bad About The Black Crowes?” Back then, few celebrities not named Cheech or Chong were publicly extolling the virtues of getting high. But Chris was an outspoken advocate.\n\nThe Robinson bros had founded the band in mid ‘80s Atlanta under the name Mr. Crowes’ Garden, with a jangly sound more akin to R.E.M.’s “Radio Free Europe” than “Brown Sugar.” Around the time “Shake Your Money Maker” was released, the Crowes were still playing small rock clubs in the Southeast, including The Nick in Birmingham, The Varsity in Tuscaloosa and Tip Top Café in Huntsville. By the time they were done touring their album, they were playing to ocean-sized stadium crowds in Europe on the Monsters of Rock tour with AC/DC and Metallica.\n\nThe Crowes’ sophomore LP, 1992′s “The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion,” is the band’s best album, contains their signature song, “Remedy” and went to number one. “Southern Harmony” also forged the band’s classic lineup, with the addition of keyboardist Eddie Harsch and swapping in guitar sorcerer Marc Ford for Cease. Still, “Southern Harmony” sold less than half of what “Money Maker” did.\n\nDruggy sprawling third album “Amorica” went gold, but the crotch-shot album cover art is more famous than the music. Patchouli-scented fourth album “Three Snake and One Charm” sent fans hoping for “Jealous Again” again packing.\n\nThe Black Crowes spent too much of the next few decades snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, playing different setlists every night, often forsaking the hits. Inspired by Chris’ Grateful Dead fandom, they played long improvisational jams. But the Crowes’ jams rarely clicked and the style shift felt forced.\n\nBand members came and went. Superfans dug in. Mainstream culture changed the channel. A turn of the century tour backing Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page put The Black Crowes back on casual fans’ radar, but the Crowes weren’t able to continue that momentum in a significant way. The Black Crowes released several latter day studio albums, the strongest of which was rootsy 2008 effort “Warpaint.”\n\nInfighting had been a part of the Crowes’ story since early on, sparked by the brothers’ loud (Chris) and quiet (Rich) dichotomy. The band had broken up a few times and introduced the more pleasant sounding term “hiatus” to rock news lexicon. But things went nuclear in 2015 when Rich announced what seemed like the Crowes’ final death, due to a money-split spat with Chris. The brothers pursued solo careers, producing some solid music but not significant fanbases.\n\nIn 2016, Harsch died from a drug overdose, ending any hopes fans had of a classic lineup reunion. Post-Crowes, Colt was in that reality show band Supernova with Crue drummer Tommy Lee and had stints playing bass for groups like Train and Lynyrd Skynyrd, but Colt found bigger success behind the scenes, with backline equipment and rehearsal-space rental businesses. Cease grew a goatee and has been country star Eric Church’s guitarist for years. Gorman penned a 2019 memoir that’s probably gotten him excommunicated from the Crowes for life, and he seems pretty OK with that.\n\nIn late 2019, Chris and Rich appeared on “The Howard Stern Show” to announce a 2020 reunion tour celebrating the 30th anniversary of “Shake Your Money Maker” on which they’d play that entire album front-to-back each concert. It made sense. Reintroduce the band with the most popular and accessible music by far from their eight studio LP catalog.\n\nIn addition to being nostalgic, the tour would also be new. Besides the Robinsons, it was all new musicians with no past Crowes included. Even longtime manager Peter Angelus, also known for his years as a crucial part of David Lee Roth-era Van Halen’s team, was out. The exception: latter day Crowes bassist Sven Pipien was brought back in. Then the pandemic shutdown touring, including the Crowes reunion, on ice until ‘21.\n\nSuperfans may have been initially skeptical but the tour has received copious press coverage and overwhelmingly positive. Clips of the live performances - with guitarist Isaiah Mitchell, drummer Brian Griffin and keyboardist Joel Robinow providing the Robinsons with spirited backing - have been impressive.\n\nAt age 54, Chris can still “bring it” onstage. Rich’s early riffs resonate as much as ever, and he’s even using some of the Marshall amps from the original “Money Maker” tour. In interviews, Chris has said a return to rock basics has inspired he and Rich to write new material with Drakoulias back as producer.\n\nGuided by new manager Mark DiDia, the Crowes have made smarter business moves too, including a better merch strategy and an awesome “SYMM” box set with the original album, outtakes, a hot 1990 live show and liner notes by David Fricke, who wrote the band’s 1991 Rolling Stone cover story. Thirty one years later, the Black Crowes feel more viable than they have in a long time.\n\nOn a recent Saturday afternoon, Rich Robinson checked in from his tour bus for the below phone interview. Edited excerpts are below.\n\nRich, what do you recall about coming up with the guitar riff for “Twice As Hard”? What guitar did you write that on?\n\nYou know for some reason I can’t remember how I wrote it. And I don’t remember what guitar I was using. I want to say it was this black (Fender) Tele Deluxe I had from the ‘70s and maybe that was it, or maybe it was my blonde (1968) Tele. But I only had like two or three guitars for that record, so it’s kind of one or the other, you know what I mean?\n\nAnything stand out about recording that song?\n\nIt was 32 years ago and I have general memories of the studio and things like that, but getting into deep … trying to remember those specific recordings, I just can’t.\n\nIn addition to all the great guitar on “Money Maker” a big part of what people loved about that record was Chris’ awesome singing. To you, what makes your brother special as a singer? Why do you think his vocals were able to drawn people in, even during a time when there were lots of singers with big voices?\n\nWell, I think the songs help people come in. The song is the gift, you know what I mean? You can have the best singer, the best guitar player, the best everything, but if you have shitty songs, no one really cares. [Laughs]\n\nI think the reason that record is … We wrote how we felt and what we meant. It was authentic for us. We’re not trying to be something we weren’t. We weren’t trying to fit in into a box that we didn’t really associate with too much. We just played music that moved us, and I think that sincerity is maybe what people were drawn too.\n\nAnd that doesn’t take away from Chris or his vocals because he is an amazing singer and an amazing frontman, but I think it’s more than just that. It’s not just one thing that draws people into a band.\n\nSongs are king, for sure. But do you have a favorite vocal performance of your brother’s? From “Shake Your Money Maker,” I love “Seeing This” and “Could I Have Been So Blind,” and also “Sometimes Salvation,” off “Southern Harmony,” which the band has played some this tour, during the second “other hits” set?\n\nThere’s a lot of them. One song in particular I always thought Chris’ delivery was just phenomenal on was “Descending” on “Amorica.” And “Under A Mountain” on “Three Snakes” too I thought was just stellar.\n\nThe first time many people outside Atlanta ever saw The Black Crowes was on the “Jealous Again” music video on MTV. What do you recall about shooting that video?\n\nWe shot a version of it in Atlanta at this place called the Buckhead Theatre, which is now called The Roxy. And we did a cool video that we liked, and we were trying to go for something specific and then we hired a manager, and he wanted to reshoot the video.\n\nSo we did it in L.A. at this big soundstage and our manager at the time (Pete Angelus) put everything together and shot this video. There were some live shots, some shots from a rehearsal room where we had been rehearsing, and then us walking around L.A. as a band and stuff like that. It was cool. It was a good foray into that world for the first time.\n\nGeorge Drakoulias was the producer on “Shake Your Money Maker” and he also worked with the band on “Southern Harmony.” Those are the two biggest selling Black Crowes records and, as much as I love “Amorica,” probably the most classic too. Why do you think you guys and George have worked so well together, and those songs have connected with so many people and really endured? Before the tour you were working on new Crowes material with him.\n\nThe first two records … really, George was our great friend, but he was also kind of our mentor and our manager. He wasn’t officially our manager, but he signed us and made our records and helped us find managers.\n\nWe put a lot of trust into George and George really came through. And we trusted him musically. He had a vision, which is kind of hard for a 19-year-old to have. I was 19 when we made this record.\n\nGeorge was a little bit older than us and was like, “Hey, this is what you have to do,” “This is what I hear,” and to walk into the studio with someone with a vision that we trusted and listened to was pretty amazing.\n\nWe made “Southern Harmony” and “Shake Your Money Maker” and those are great records, but cut to three or four years later and we were delving into different elements of music. And it wasn’t maybe what George wanted to do, but what we needed to do as musicians and as songwriters in particular, Chris and I.\n\nSo we went down a road. I mean, we weren’t trying to make a commercial album with “Amorica.” We never tried to make a commercial album, one that would sell. We have always just written our songs, you know, same thing goes for “Three Snakes.”\n\nWe have a long history with George, we’ve known him for 33, 34 years. He got really good ears and we love him. Chris and I are in a great place and we really wanted to bring George back in and get in a room and work some songs out.\n\nOne of my favorites to hear live from “Shake Your Money Maker” is “Thick N’ Thin,” a song the Crowes performed on “SNL” in 1991. In the last few years I really got into the music of The Replacements and I hear a Replacements influence on “Thick N’ Thin.” The Black Crowes’ Stones, Faces, Humble Pie and even R.E.M. roots have been written about a lot. But what other bands were you listening to when you were making “Shake Your Money Maker”? Influences that went over many listeners’ heads.\n\nYeah, The Replacements were a huge influence on us, a rock & roll band but also a punk band and a pop band. But there were a lot of bands at that time, sort of starting out in the early to mid’ 80s, that we really connected with.\n\nThere’s a bunch of bands from L.A. we were into. X, the sort of classic L.A. punk band. We were into Rain Parade, The Dream Syndicate and The Long Ryders.\n\nAnd on the East Coast, there were amazing bands like The dB’s, just so many bands. We were huge Velvet Underground fans. We loved all that music, and that’s really what we were absorbing.\n\nSpeaking of roots, the “Hard To Handle” cover was a breakthrough track for the Crowes. The band was doing well already but that just made things go zoom. The recording engineer on the album, Brendan O’Brien (who later became an A-list record producer for the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam), played the guitar solo on “Hard To Handle.” In the “Shake Your Money Maker” liner notes, it credits him with “a potpourri of instruments.” Did Brendan O’Brien play other lead guitar parts on the album?\n\nNo, he didn’t. Basically when they said he played “a potpourri of instruments,” he played organ on “She Talks To Angels” and he played the solo on “Hard To Handle.” That was it.\n\nChuck (Leavell, Stones keyboardist) had to leave. He came in for two days, knocked out the whole record and then he left. And so after listening to “Angels,” someone had the idea of putting like a Procol Harum kind of organ on “She Talks To Angels,” and Brendan was like “I can do it. I can come up with something simple.” And that’s what he did.\n\n(Crowes guitarist) Jeff Cease took off from the studio for some reason. He went home to Nashville (where Cease was from), and then “Hard To Handle” needed a (guitar) solo, so Brendan did it.\n\nThere’s a hidden track on “Shake Your Money Maker” called “Live Too Fast Blues/Mercy, Sweet Moan.” In the ‘90s, a lot of bands ended up doing hidden tracks, but this is the first major one I recall. On the “Money Maker” reunion tour, the Crowes haven’t been playing that song live, but did you ever try it in the rehearsals or consider doing it as part of this tour? And did you and Chris ever flesh it (“Live Too Fast Blues/Mercy, Sweet Moan”) out into a full song?\n\nWe ever fleshed it out into a full song, and we’re not gonna play it on the set. But it was a cool song. Chris and I wrote it really quickly, just threw it on there and that was that was about it.\n\nDo you remember if any other album titles were considered for the debut album, besides “Shake Your Money Maker”?\n\nI really don’t. I think Chris had a pretty good idea halfway through making the record … He brought up the (Elmore James song) version and that was cool, but that’s as deep as it went from what I from what I can remember.\n\nWhat’s the biggest single way you think your guitar playing has evolved since “Shake Your Money Maker”? And what’s the biggest way it’s remained the same?\n\nI’d only been playing guitar for about three or four years when I made “Shake Your Money Maker.” I didn’t start playing until much later than most people. So I started when I was 15 and played standard tuning for a while, but then was drawn to open-tunings, i.e. (English folk-singer) Nick Drake and (Crosby, Stills & Nash’s) Stephen Stills and those kinds of people.\n\nThat record, I really focused on songwriting instead of playing guitar or being a guitar player type person. And that was always my focus. But 31 years later, I never really think about what I do or how I play, in those sort of ways. I don’t really consider myself too much, you know, so I wouldn’t know how to put that into some sort of amusing anecdote. Like, I have no idea. [Laughs]\n\nAnother of your early musical influences was Prince. What do you think was great about Prince as a guitarist? His album “Dirty Mind” was one of the first records you ever had, I’ve read.\n\nYeah, I mean, it’s hard to call Prince any one thing. He was brilliant at everything. He was a brilliant singer, brilliant bass player, drummer, keyboard player, guitar player, amazing songwriter.\n\nSo I don’t really consider him anything but just Prince, you know? It was kind of crazy how good he was at everything. [Laughs] Those songs, the song “Dirty Mind” in particular and that whole record and all down the line, how many great songs did that guy write?\n\nI always thought if I could hear any artist cover a Crowes song, I’d want to hear Prince do “Girl From a Pawnshop” (off the “Three Snakes” album).\n\nYeah, me too. I know he played “Jealous Again,” right when “Shake Your Money Maker” came out he had played that song a couple times and it got back to us and it was very humbling. I took it as a huge honor.\n\nThe Black Crowes’ play Pelham’s Oak Mountain Amphitheatre on Sept. 5. Los Angeles hard-rock band Dirty Honey is the support act. Showtime is 7:30 p.m. Tickets start at $30 and go up to around $200, via concerts.livenation.com.
