Known for spacey, extended jams and solos, the best jam bands have developed strong, devoted followings over the years. The top jam bands' concerts have become events unto themselves with fans often times camping out and traveling all over to hear a live show. These sets generally vary from night to night, giving fans a different experience. While jam bands never sold too well, their live shows are stuff of legend. Today, jam band not only includes the psychedelic bands who were initially labeled as this, but also folk rock, electronic music, world music, and jazz fusion.\n\nSo, what are the best jam bands? For starters, any list has to include the Grateful Dead, Allman Brothers Band, Phish, Gov't Mule, Medeski, Martin & Wood and over time, the Black Crowes. These bands are widely known for allowing their concerts to be taped and circulated among their fans. Additionally, as time has worn on, the best jam bands have been influenced by others outside of the stringent jam band label. The party atmosphere and improvisational nature of this style of music has allowed to endure and grow over the years.\n\nThat said, it's up to you to determine what are the best jam bands. If you notice a band that isn't on this list and should be, feel free to add them. This list answers the questions \"who are the best jam band bands of all time?\" and \"who is the greatest jam band musician ever?\" If you know enough about the genre, please vote based on the quality of the band's music instead of just voting for the most popular jam band bands that you might've heard of. {#nodes}\n\nMost divisive: Rusted Root\n\nOver 3.1K Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of Jam Bands\n\nAs pioneers of the Jam Band genre, Grateful Dead's improvisational approach to live performances has solidified their reputation as one of the most influential bands in history. With a career spanning over 30 years, the band's seamless blending of rock, folk, and blues resulted in iconic songs such as \"Truckin'\" and \"Casey Jones\". Their dedicated fanbase, affectionately known as \"Deadheads\", continue to celebrate and share the band's extensive catalog of live recordings. Through countless lineup changes and the passing of key members, Grateful Dead's impact on American music culture remains unparalleled.\n\nFormed in 1969, The Allman Brothers Band are widely recognized for their innovative blend of Southern rock, jazz, and blues. With classic hits like \"Ramblin' Man\" and \"Whipping Post\", the band's musicianship showcased an unwavering commitment to delivering soul-stirring jams during each performance. As one of the most successful Jam Bands in history, The Allman Brothers Band has consistently attracted new generations of fans while maintaining a strong legacy that includes multiple Grammy Awards and Hall of Fame inductions.\n\nHailing from Vermont, Phish has been carrying the torch for improvisational rock since 1983. Often compared to Grateful Dead due to their dedicated fanbase and lengthy live shows, Phish has crafted a unique sound that incorporates elements from rock, jazz, funk, progressive rock, and bluegrass. With a robust discography that includes iconic songs such as \"You Enjoy Myself\" and \"Tweezer\", Phish continues to be one of the most influential Jam Bands today by consistently pushing musical boundaries through improvisation and exploratory composition.\n\nWidespread Panic emerged from Athens, Georgia in 1986 as a force to be reckoned with in the Jam Band scene. Their innovative fusion of Southern rock, blues, and jazz has earned them a dedicated fanbase that relishes the band's ability to create transcendent live performances. With top-charting albums like Ain't Life Grand and Bombs & Butterflies, Widespread Panic has solidified their status as a premier Jam Band while also making a lasting impact on American music by selling more than three million albums and hosting unforgettable live shows around the world.\n\nFormed in 1993, The String Cheese Incident has captivated audiences with their eclectic style that merges bluegrass, rock, electronica, funk, jazz, and beyond. Known for their high-energy live shows and dedicated fanbase affectionately referred to as \"Cheeseheads\", the band has released multiple successful studio albums like Born on the Wrong Planet and Outside Inside. Through genre-defying collaborations and engaging live performances, The String Cheese Incident continues to be a major influence in the Jam Band community.\n\nOriginally formed as a side project by members of The Allman Brothers Band in 1994, Gov't Mule quickly took on a life of its own by creating some of the most soulful jams in modern music. With a sound that blends Southern rock, blues, and jazz influences, the band has released numerous successful albums including Dose and The Deep End. Gov't Mule's unwavering commitment to delivering powerful live performances has made them a staple in the Jam Band scene and an enduring influence on new generations of musicians."
