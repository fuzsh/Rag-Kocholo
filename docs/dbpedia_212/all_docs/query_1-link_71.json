        "text": "It doesn't matter that The Black Crowes were not influential. Unfortunately, they were a band out of their time. However, this does not in ANY WAY discount the significance of their achievements. They carried on a dying (dead?) tradition of straight up, no frills, sneering, unapologetic purely American rock n' roll music. Anyone who questions their originality is simply not listening. They are far darker, more Gothic, mystical and dualistic than their predecessors. They play, both live and on record, with a passion and intensity that has rarely been matched. And, the simple fact that a band so removed from the glory days of their genre has sustained such a devoted following and managed to remain relevant to the chagrin of critics everywhere is a testament in itself to their greatness. Did The Black Crowes reinvent the wheel? No. But, they rolled the wheel on and kept it glowing in an era of darkness. If this does not constitute musical legendary, nothing does.\n\nPosted by JeremyCane17 on Saturday, 07/27/2013 @ 02:05am\n\nBlack Crowes should be 1st ballot RRHOF in 2015. One of the few bands everybody loves. Black-White,Rich-Poor,Democrat-Republican,Male-Female loves the Crowes.\n\nShake Your Money Maker was a Classic CD. Jealous Again,She Talks To Angels,Hard To Handle my FAVS.Like Guns N Roses,they were the truth. 80's groups thought they were pretty good but GNR & BC showed these groups how to make great albums & craft great songs.Musicianship & talent off the charts.\n\nBlack Crowes looked like they stepped off a 1971 bus into the 90's but they were one of the bands that saved rock music & introduced a bluesy sound to the mix. Just fantastic band.\n\nChris Robinson squeezes every ounce of himself when he sings. His voice is incredible & moves me like few singers. Bono,Natalie Merchant,Freddie Mercury off the top of my head.\n\nThey had the commercial success,hits,& CD sales as well as great respect from musicians. Many critics might wonder their exact innovation & influence but I say they deserve RRHOF. KING\n\nPosted by KING on Wednesday, 02/19/2014 @ 23:40pm\n\nThe Crowes (as well as Pearl Jam) are pretty much a shoe in for the R n R Hall of fame, They have always had a pretty good rep with Rolling Stone magazine as well as the respect of bands members of everyone from The Beatles to Zeppelin. They (although now they are no longer together) have had a very successful cult following. The Crowes are eligible as of 2015 which will mark 25 years since their debut. Granted since 2001 the band had a revolving door on it due to members leaving or being fired, too many drug problems and personality issues had really plagued these guys for years but they always continued to follow their own heart musically. One of the BEST bands to emerge out of 1990. They have hit everything from Hard Rock, Blues, Metal, Extended Jams, Country rock and more recently bluegrass. They were always able to reinvent themselves and still never bow to conventionality and never sold out to gain popularity. I can easily state that by 2017, The Black Crowes will be in the RnR hall. Well deserved.\n\nPosted by Mike on Thursday, 04/16/2015 @ 03:06am\n\nfirst ballot of shut the RRHF down. How can you have rappers in and not one of the top 5 best rock and roll bands ever in? Just close the doors and shut it down if you don't put them in. I would never visit the RRHF unless the correct bands were in.\n\nPosted by vinnie on Thursday, 11/19/2015 @ 15:41pm\n\nI never saw the Crowes, but the Chris Robinson Brotherhood was phenomenal live. They closed the show with a kickass cover of the Dead's Mr. Charlie. She Talks To Angels and sometimes even Hard to Handle are still in regular radio rotation, and I don't know anyone who doesn't like these guys. Saying they aren't influential is just plain wrong. You can clearly hear their influence on modern blues-rock bands like Tedeschi-Trucks Band. Second-Ballot HOFers?\n\nPosted by Max on Monday, 02/8/2016 @ 00:02am\n\nRecently, Somebody was trying to sound like they were making some semi-profound point about how The Black Crowes didn't bring anything new or substantial to the rock table and were not special, just a cross between The Rolling Stones and The Allman Brothers... Well, I think they are more than that, but if that does happen to be all they are, it may not be new, but sounds like something substantial and special. So, yeah The Black Crowes carry way more than enough weight for this misguided fame game.\n\nPosted by GCB on Thursday, 12/26/2019 @ 16:48pm\n\nOne of the most underrated rock bands of all time. Outstanding musicianship and songwriting throughout their career that went well beyond the classics from Shake Your Moneymaker. They continued to add depth to their work that effectively blended rock, blues, soul, folk, psychedelic Americana and some hints of country and yes, even some punk aftertaste - they were \"Southern Craft\" before southern craft was a thing. Great band that doesn't get nearly enough critical recognition for their body of work. Put them in!\n\nPosted by J P on Tuesday, 05/10/2022 @ 21:36pm\n\nThose of you that don't think they are the greatest rock band, let me remind ya that Gregg Allman said it himself. Believe his vote counts. I've seen them 27 times. Seen Chris w/ Phil, Page in Raleigh.. it's an absolute abomination that they are not in. I never understood how Soundgarden, Alice In Chains and the Crowes are not in yet the Beasties, Publix Enemy, the Cars…. Shoot I can go on for hours. Chris is a top 10 lead singer. Rich & Marc are two of the greatest alive … Eddie was 1st in his class…. Sheeeeet. I don't even know if they'd go but they should be inducted asap. I mean come on. Wtf are we talking bout man!!! Get it over with so I can die in peace.\n\nPosted by Vinnie D on Saturday, 11/5/2022 @ 04:28am"
