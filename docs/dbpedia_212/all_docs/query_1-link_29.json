        "text": "What band could be more appropriate to spend some time with on 4-20 than the Black Crowes?\n\nThe veteran rock troupe, reformed and reconstituted since 2019 by brothers Chris and Rich Robinson, has traded in and been embraced as part of cannabis culture since the start of a career that began 40 years ago. One of the group’s logos even features a black crow smoking a joint. So you’re not going to find too many bands as in tune with the day designated to celebrate high times.\n\nAnd the Crowes were indeed smokin’ on Saturday night, April 20, at the Fillmore Detroit — their sixth performance at the venue and first in 11 years. Promoting “Happiness Bastards,” its first new album in 15 years, the octet roared through a tight ‘n’ tidy nearly 95 minutes, presenting a 17-song rock ‘n’ roll textbook on how to balance old with new and keep the dynamic on high even in mellower moments.\n\nThat’s something the band has done when at its best over the years, and at this juncture the Robinsons and their cohorts have nested in a satisfying sweet spot.\n\nFollowing a gritty 30-minute set by the Chicago trio Glyders, the Black Crowes were ushered on stage by AC/DC’s “It’s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock ‘n’ Roll)” on the PA before kicking into the big beat of “Beside Manners,” one of six tracks the group played from “Happiness Bastards.” Fronting the band on a tiered stage with theatrically stacked amplifiers and a carnival-style canopy of lights above, Chris Robinson danced, strutted and twirled his microphone stand, his moves reflected in a tall “vanity mirror” that was part of the drum riser. The band, including longtime bassist Sven Pipien and two female backing vocalists, locked into the groove behind him, and when the elder Robinson declared, “Saturday night in Detroit — let’s (expletive) rock ‘n’ roll!,” the packed-to-the-gills Fillmore was happy to follow suit.\n\nThe Crowes maintained an economical flight path throughout the night on songs new (“Rats and Clowns,” “Dirty Could Sun,” “Wilted Rose,” “Wanting and Waiting”), old (“Black Moon Creeping,” “Twice as Hard,” “No Speak No Slave,” “Then She Said My Name”) and borrowed via covers of Bo Diddley’s “Road Runner” and the group’s hit version of Otis Redding’s “Hard to Handle.” It did, however, show off its ferocious jam band potency during a lengthy, ebb-and-flow arrangement of “Thorn in My Pride,” with Rich Robinson and Nico Bereciartua trading guitar solos and Chris Robinson pulling out his harmonica.\n\nLater, the Crowes’ extended its first hit, 1990’s “Jealous Again,” before ending the main set with “Remedy” and returning to cover the Velvet Underground’s punky “White Light, White Heat” for a quick encore.\n\nBefore “Thorn in My Pride” Chris Robinson acknowledged that “we’ve been coming to Detroit for a long time” and recalled the late MC5 frontman Rob Tyner showing up to see group during its 1990 show at the old Ritz in Roseville. “What is a rock ‘n’ roll band?” Robinson asked. “It’s pretty much a dream…this dream is still going, and hopefully this dream goes on for a long time.”\n\nAnd there was certainly no doubt the 3,000 at the Fillmore on Saturday concurred. High times, indeed."
