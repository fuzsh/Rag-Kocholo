        "text": "The Bend Theater brings you Southbound: 50th Anniversary Celebration of The Allman Brothers Band’s classic album “Brothers and Sisters”\n\nPlease join Southbound on Friday, March 31st at The Bend for a special Allman Brothers Band tribute show. This concert features a celebration of the 50th anniversary release of the classic “Brothers And Sisters” album. Southbound will perform a respectful and accurate rendition of the entire Album along with a “Best Of” set of the ABB. This is one show that Allman Brothers fans cannot miss. All Allmans, All Night!\n\nSouthbound is a Milwaukee-based band, which specializes in classic rock with a jam-based groove. With a thirty-year history of producing authentic versions of the best rock music in history, Southbound maintains the integrity of music they cover while adding a touch of their own originality. Southbound has enjoyed much success in the Midwest performing in front of large audiences and high-profile concerts such as Summerfest, Harley Anniversary headlining shows and the Wisconsin State Fair and much more. Southbound has built an extraordinary following which appeals to a wide range of music lovers who appreciate great rock and roll. The focal point of the Southbound experience involves strong vocals and stunning instrumentation. Southbound is comprised of Stan Lukasz (Lead Vocals, Guitar), Gary Koehler (Guitar, Vocals), Tony May (Keyboards, Vocals), Tim Schulz (Drums, Percussion), Jim May (Bass, Vocals) and special guest on drums, Mike Kasprzak (Cactus Brothers & Violent Femmes). Southbound’s repertoire consists of original music as well as music from The Allman Brothers Band, The Rolling Stones, The Grateful Dead, The Band, The Doors, ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Santana, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Black Crowes, The Beatles, CCR and much more…\n\nShepherd Express: Critic’s Choice\n\nMilwaukee’s Southbound has drawn crowds with their own versions of hippie-rock standards. The band broke away from their demanding schedule to record a self-titled disc of self-penned material. “We’ve been incorporating originals into the sets for sometime now and been getting great response,” says drummer Tim Schulz. Their own songs stay true to the roots of their covers. The musicianship is top-notch, and although the production level is high, an undeniable looseness keeps the record accessible to those who enjoy the Allman Brothers-like feel that has made the band so popular. Most bands in this area of music never make it past their first never-ending gigtuned-jam, but Southbound has stood the test of time, evolving and remaining fresh, maintaining their following, and drawing in new fans show after show.\n\nThe Onion\n\nSouthbound is like the house band for the entire city of Milwaukee, playing practically every week at bars, clubs, and festivals, as well as traveling throughout the state. Though the group packs its sets with crowd-pleasing covers, Southbound recorded a CD of original compositions. So, in addition to works by the Allman Brothers (whose “Southbound” inspired this band’s name), the Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones, fans can now shout for Southbound’s own material…\n\nOn Milwaukee.com\n\nSouthbound fans range from hippies to rockers and everyone in between. The band recorded their first album, self-title “Southbound”. The record is a kaleidoscope of styles, from the danceable, Grateful-Deady “Latent Heat” to the soulful, mellow “Plea.” Southbound doesn’t reinvent the wheel, rather the band creates songs that their favorite artists might have written themselves. It’s almost as if they are channeling the sounds of classic rock bands, and, lucky for our ears, doing it quite well…\n\nMilwaukee Magazine Run For Cover\n\nThe knock on “cover bands” – groups that play songs written by others – is that lack of original material (whatever that means) automatically assigns them second-class status. The sentiment ignores the fact that much of today’s “post modern,” “Information Age” music – sample[1]based electronic and hip-hop, for example – is culled, with varying degrees of legality, from previously recorded or written material. It also fails to recognize that some cover bands please crowds by combining accessible material with top-notch musicianship, including improvisation within cover songs. The members of the local band Southbound, who play tunes by the Grateful Dead, Allman Brothers, Doors and others, aren’t exactly losing sleep over the cover band label.\n\nDoors open at 6:30 PM to give you time to find your seats, visit our historic lobby, concession stand and fully stocked bar! Show begins at approximately 7:30 PM."
