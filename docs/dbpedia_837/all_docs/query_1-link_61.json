        "text": "Vulnerability of housing buildings in Bucharest, Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBostenaru, M.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nThe author participates to the World Housing Encyclopedia project (www.world-housing.net), an internet based database of housing buildings in earthquake prone areas of the world. This is a voluntary project run by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, Oakland, California and the International Association of Earthquake Engineering, financial means being available only for the website where the information is shared. For broader dissemination in 2004 a summary publication of the reports to date was published. The database can be querried for various parameters and browsed after geographic distribution. Participation is open to any housing experts. Between 2003 and 2006 the author was also member of the editorial board. The author contributed numerous reports about building types in Romania, and each one about building types in Germany and Switzerland. This presentation will be about the contributed reports on building types in Romania. To the Encyclopedia eight reports on building types from Bucharest were contributed, while in further research of the author one more was similarly described regarding the vulnerability and the seismic retrofit. The selection of these types was done considering the historic development of the built substance in Bucharest from 1850 on, time from which a representative amount of housing buildings which can be classified in typologies can be found in Bucharest. While the structural types are not necessarily characteristic for the style, since the style has other time limits, often appearing before the type became common and then remaining being practiced also after another style gained ground, a historic succession can be seen also in this case. The nine types considered can be grouped in seven time categories: - the time 1850-1880, for a vernacular housing type with masonry load bearing walls and timber floors, - the time 1880-1920, for the type of two storey or multi-storey house with masonry walls and timber floors (in which\n\nA hydrogeological conceptual approach to study urban groundwater flow in Bucharest city, Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoukhemacha, Mohamed Amine; Gogu, Constantin Radu; Serpescu, Irina; Gaitanaru, Dragos; Bica, Ioan\n\n2015-05-01\n\nManagement of groundwater systems in urban areas is necessary and can be reliably performed by means of mathematical modeling combined with geospatial analysis. A conceptual approach for the study of urban hydrogeological systems is presented. The proposed approach is based on the features of Bucharest city (Romania) and can be adapted to other urban areas showing similar characteristics. It takes into account the interaction between groundwater and significant urban infrastructure elements that can be encountered in modern cities such as subway tunnels and water-supply networks, and gives special attention to the sewer system. In this respect, an adaptation of the leakage factor approach is proposed, which uses a sewer-system zoning function related to the conduits' location in the aquifer system and a sewer-conduits classification function related to their structural and/or hydraulic properties. The approach was used to elaborate a single-layered steady state groundwater flow model for a pilot zone of Bucharest city.\n\nWeb-GIS platform for green infrastructure in Bucharest, Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSercaianu, Mihai; Petrescu, Florian; Aldea, Mihaela; Oana, Luca; Rotaru, George\n\n2015-06-01\n\nIn the last decade, reducing urban pollution and improving quality of public spaces became a more and more important issue for public administration authorities in Romania. The paper describes the development of a web-GIS solution dedicated to monitoring of the green infrastructure in Bucharest, Romania. Thus, the system allows the urban residents (citizens) to collect themselves and directly report relevant information regarding the current status of the green infrastructure of the city. Consequently, the citizens become an active component of the decision-support process within the public administration. Besides the usual technical characteristics of such geo-information processing systems, due to the complex legal and organizational problems that arise in collecting information directly from the citizens, additional analysis was required concerning, for example, local government involvement, environmental protection agencies regulations or public entities requirements. Designing and implementing the whole information exchange process, based on the active interaction between the citizens and public administration bodies, required the use of the \"citizen-sensor\" concept deployed with GIS tools. The information collected and reported from the field is related to a lot of factors, which are not always limited to the city level, providing the possibility to consider the green infrastructure as a whole. The \"citizen-request\" web-GIS for green infrastructure monitoring solution is characterized by a very diverse urban information, due to the fact that the green infrastructure itself is conditioned by a lot of urban elements, such as urban infrastructures, urban infrastructure works and construction density.\n\nReducing urban heat island effects to improve urban comfort and balance energy consumption in Bucharest (Romania)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nConstantinescu, Dan; Ochinciuc, Cristina Victoria; Cheval, Sorin; ComÅa, IonuÅ£; SÃ®rodoev, Igor; Andone, Radu; CaracaÅ, Gabriela; CrÄciun, Cerasella; Dumitrescu, Alexandru; Georgescu, Mihaela; IanoÅ, Ioan; Merciu, Cristina; Moraru, Dan; OpriÅ, Ana; Paraschiv, Mirela; RaeÅ£chi, Sonia; Saghin, Irina; Schvab, Andrei; TÄtui-VÄidianu, NataÅa\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIn the recent decades, extreme temperature events and derived hazards are frequent and trigger noteworthy impacts in Romania, especially over the large urban areas. The cities produce significant disturbances of many elements of the regional climate, and generates adverse effects such as Urban Heat Islands (UHI). This presentation condenses the outputs of an ongoing research project (REDBHI) developed through (2013-2017) focused on developing a methodology for monitoring and forecasting indoor climate and energy challenges related to the intensity of UHI of Bucharest (Romania), based on relevant urban climate zones (UCZs). Multi-criteria correlations between the UHI and architectural, urban and landscape variables were determined, and the vulnerability of buildings expressed in the form of transfer function between indoor micro-climate and outdoor urban environment. The vulnerability of civil buildings was determined in relation with the potential for amplifying the thermal hazards intensity through the anthropogenic influence. The project REDBHI aims at developing innovative and original products, with direct applicability, which can be used in any urban settlement and have market potential with regards to energy design and consulting. The concrete innovative outcomes consist of a) localization of the Bucharest UCZs according to the UHI intensity, identifying reference buildings and sub-zones according to urban anthropic factors and landscape pattern; b) typology of representative buildings with regards to energy consumption and CO2 emitted as a result of building exploitation; c) 3D modelling of the reference buildings and of the thermal/energy reaction to severe climatic conditions d) empirical validation of the dynamic thermal/energy analysis; d) development of an pilot virtual studio capable to simulate climate alerts, analyse scenarios and suggest measures to mitigate the UHI effects, and disseminate the outcomes for educational purposes; e) compendium of\n\nMonitoring and assessment of the outdoor thermal comfort in Bucharest (Romania)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheval, Sorin; Ciobotaru, Ana-Maria; Andronache, Ion; Dumitrescu, Alexandru\n\n2017-04-01\n\nfundamental information for supporting the immediate measures and the long-term urban planning and the sustainable thermal comfort of the urban inhabitants.

Bucharest is particularly vulnerable to seismic hazard due to: the high density of inhabitants, especially within the residential districts with blocks of flats; the old public utility fund; the out-of-date infrastructure; the numerous industrial parks that are undergoing a restructuring process, not to mention the inefficient organization of civil protection and poor education of the population regarding seismic risk. This research was designed to examine the attitudes and perceptions of people living with the risk of an earthquake hazard in Bucharest. We were interested in how attitudes and perceptions differ depending on gender, age, education, residential area and socioeconomic status, characteristics of seismic hazard, degree of risk exposure, degree of danger, and casualty awareness. At the same time, we compare the results of this study with those from a previous and similar enquiry in 1997. The statistical processing has indicated a significant difference between the declared perception of seismic risk and the independent variables of gender, age, level of education, level of attachment to the residential area, and degree to which the subjects consider they may be affected and could retrieve their losses. Due to the continuous decrease of their living standard, the most vulnerable is the aged population. The feelings toward the residential area is another factor of statistical significance for the population's seismic danger perception. A strong affective bond offers a feeling of safety and leads to the neglect and even total denial of the hazard. In the case of independent variables regarding the type of dwelling, its age, and property form, deviations of empiric values from the theoretical distribution are not relevant for the correlation searched for, which indicates that this issue goes beyond the above-mentioned criteria.\n\nThe summer urban heat island of Bucharest (Romania) as retrieved from satellite imagery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheval, Sorin; Dumitrescu, Alexandru\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe summer Urban Heat Island (UHI) of the city of Bucharest (Romania) has been investigated in terms of its shape, intensity, extension, and links to land cover. The study integrates land surface temperature (LST) data retrieved by the MODIS sensors aboard the Terra and Aqua NASA satellites, and SEVIRI sensors on board of the geostationary platform MSG, along 2000-2012. Based on the Rodionov Regime Shift Index, the significant changing points in the land surface temperature values along transverse profiles crossing the city's centre were considered as UHI's limits. The study shows that the intensity calculated as the difference between the LST within the UHI limits and several surrounding buffers is an objective and flexible tool for describing the average thermal state of the urban-rural transition. The method secures the weight of comparing the UHI's intensity of different urban areas. There are little variations from one month to another, but UHI's shapes and intensities under clear-sky conditions are very specific to nighttime (more regular and 2-3Â°C less in the 7-km width buffer), and daytime (more twisted and more steep temperature decrease). For both cases, strong relationships with the land cover can be assumed. The nighttime UHI's geometry is more regular, and the intensity lower than the day situation, while the land cover exerts a strong influence on the Bucharest LST. After all, the study promotes an objective manner to delimitate and quantify the UHI based on satellite imagery. The study was performed within the STAR project 92/2013 (Urban Heat Island Monitoring under Present and Future Climate - UCLIMESA).\n\nPsychological Vulnerability and Earthquake Risk Perception in Bucharest/Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRomeo Cretu, Zeno; Armas, Iuliana; Stanciugelu, Irina\n\n2010-05-01\n\n(activities, strategies in case of disaster). The psychological module included 21 encoded items with answers on a five-level Likert scale (1 - strongly disagree, 5 - strongly agree). The research hypotheses were centered on testing the connection between psychological control factors and demographic determinants (subject's sex and age), economical status and the building conditions/characteristics which they live in. Another hypothesis to be checked was focused on behavioral changes related with the experience level of investigated subjects. The final questionnaire was applied by phone to Bucharest representative sample of 1376 people. The sample type was the probabilistic, single-staged, layered one. There had been selected families/households from Bucharest, which had a telephone or a Mobil phone. The households were elected using the RDD (Random Digit Dialing) Method for undifferentiated phone numbers generation.

In this respect, the most revered personalities are those of Professor Alexandru Moruzzi (1900-1957) (in Iasi) and Professor Dimitrie Bagdasar (1893-1946) (in Bucharest), who are the fathers of modern neurosurgery in Romania. Professor Bagdasar was schooled in Professor Harvey Cushing's clinic in Boston and is credited with creating the first completely independent neurosurgical unit in Romania. His legacy was carried on with honor by Professor Constantin Arseni (1912-1994), who, in 1975, tasked Dr. Lenke Horvath (1917-1991) with creating the first autonomous pediatric neurosurgery unit in Bucharest. This article is a small tribute to the founder of pediatric neurosurgery in Romania and one of the female pioneer neurosurgeons, who, by personal example of dedication and hard work, radically changed medical thinking and neurosurgery in Romania.

The research was limited to housing buildings. Bucharest, the capital of Romania, was the object of the research. Strong earthquakes affect Bucharest about three times in a century, the damaging earthquakes of the 20th century being in 1940 and 1977. Other strong earthquakes occurred in 1986 and 1990. Since it is a broad topic, first the building type was determined, which should serve further research. For this scope the building types of the 20th century, which are common in Bucharest, Romania, were investigated. For each building type reports have been written, which comprised the earthquake resilient features, the seismic defficiencies, the damage patterns and the retrofit measures. Each of these features was listed for elements of the building. A first result of the research was an integrated system in order to include latter aspects in the planning in the first steps. So already at the building survey attention has to be paid on how a building is subdivided in order to be able to determine the economic efficiency of the planned action. So were defined the `retrofit elements`. In a first step the characteristics were defined, through which these retrofit elements (for example column, wall part between two windows) can be recognised in the building survey. In a further one, which retrofit measures can be connected to these. Diagrams were built, in order to visualise these findings. For each retrofit element and the corresponding measure the costs were calculated. Also, these retrofit elements and the measures connected to them were modelled for the simulation with the structural software, so that the benefit of the measures could be determined. In the part which regarded the economic efficiency, benefits and costs of retrofit measures had to be compared, so the improvement in the rigidity\n\nUrban Vulnerability Assessment to Seismic Hazard through Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis. Case Study: the Bucharest Municipality/Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArmas, Iuliana; Dumitrascu, Silvia; Bostenaru, Maria\n\n2010-05-01\n\nIn the context of an explosive increase in value of the damage caused by natural disasters, an alarming challenge in the third millennium is the rapid growth of urban population in vulnerable areas. Cities are, by definition, very fragile socio-ecological systems with a high level of vulnerability when it comes to environmental changes and that are responsible for important transformations of the space, determining dysfunctions shown in the state of the natural variables (Parker and Mitchell, 1995, The OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database). A contributing factor is the demographic dynamic that affects urban areas. The aim of this study is to estimate the overall vulnerability of the urban area of Bucharest in the context of the seismic hazard, by using environmental, socio-economic, and physical measurable variables in the framework of a spatial multi-criteria analysis. For this approach the capital city of Romania was chosen based on its high vulnerability due to the explosive urban development and the advanced state of degradation of the buildings (most of the building stock being built between 1940 and 1977). Combining these attributes with the seismic hazard induced by the Vrancea source, Bucharest was ranked as the 10th capital city worldwide in the terms of seismic risk. Over 40 years of experience in the natural risk field shows that the only directly accessible way to reduce the natural risk is by reducing the vulnerability of the space (Adger et al., 2001, Turner et al., 2003; UN/ISDR, 2004, Dayton-Johnson, 2004, Kasperson et al., 2005; Birkmann, 2006 etc.). In effect, reducing the vulnerability of urban spaces would imply lower costs produced by natural disasters. By applying the SMCA method, the result reveals a circular pattern, signaling as hot spots the Bucharest historic centre (located on a river terrace and with aged building stock) and peripheral areas (isolated from the emergency centers and defined by precarious social and economic\n\nFunctional Zoning and Urban Development Tendencies of Bucharest City/Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArmas, Iuliana; Dumitrascu, Silvia\n\n2010-05-01\n\nAny form of urban development policy for environmental management should be based on the differentiation of the structure of a territory that can be found in the shape of functional zoning. Identifying the patterns of morphological structure of the urban space can provide essential clues concerning the proper measures to take into consideration during the activity of urban planning. In this sense, the Bucharest municipality study case provides the example of a dynamic urban space with a complex and distinctive evolutionary structure. The aim of the study is to set out the main events that shaped the Bucharest city space and the patterns resulted from their impact at the functional level of the Romanian capital. In order to identify the development tendencies of the Bucharest municipality, a series of aspects concerning urban morphology should be highlighted that reveal the impact of the socio-economical policies at the structural level of the territory. In this sense, three images of the urban space stand out, representative for the period when they materialized: the Post-Byzantine (XV-XVIII), the Fanariot (XVIII) and the Modern periods (XIX-XX). The corresponding cartographic documents analyzed are: the Franz Purcel Plan (dated 1789), the Romanian Guide Print Plan and, respectively, the AGC Busman Print Plan. The analysis reveals three distinctive morphological types: radial-concentric in the 17th century, polynuclear in the 18th century, leading to the mixed character in the Modern period. The latest trait of the urban territory is based on the concentric character of the street network (three circles were identified at the level of the capital city that point out the evolution of the urban space: Dacia bv-Mircea Vulcanescu, Stefan cel Mare bv-Iancu de Hunedoara and the last circle outlined by the ring road) and the presence of multiple nuclei that accumulate the commercial, administrative and business functions of the city.\n\nSocial vulnerability assessment using spatial multi-criteria analysis (SEVI model) and the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI model) - a case study for Bucharest, Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArmaÅ, I.; GavriÅ, A.\n\n2013-06-01\n\nIn recent decades, the development of vulnerability frameworks has enlarged the research in the natural hazards field. Despite progress in developing the vulnerability studies, there is more to investigate regarding the quantitative approach and clarification of the conceptual explanation of the social component. At the same time, some disaster-prone areas register limited attention. Among these, Romania's capital city, Bucharest, is the most earthquake-prone capital in Europe and the tenth in the world. The location is used to assess two multi-criteria methods for aggregating complex indicators: the social vulnerability index (SoVI model) and the spatial multi-criteria social vulnerability index (SEVI model). Using the data of the 2002 census we reduce the indicators through a factor analytical approach to create the indices and examine if they bear any resemblance to the known vulnerability of Bucharest city through an exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). This is a critical issue that may provide better understanding of the social vulnerability in the city and appropriate information for authorities and stakeholders to consider in their decision making. The study emphasizes that social vulnerability is an urban process that increased in a post-communist Bucharest, raising the concern that the population at risk lacks the capacity to cope with disasters. The assessment of the indices indicates a significant and similar clustering pattern of the census administrative units, with an overlap between the clustering areas affected by high social vulnerability. Our proposed SEVI model suggests adjustment sensitivity, useful in the expert-opinion accuracy.\n\nMolecular typing of the recently expanding subtype B HIV-1 epidemic in Romania: evidence for local spread among MSMs in Bucharest area.\n\nPubMed\n\nParaschiv, Simona; Otelea, Dan; Batan, Ionelia; Baicus, Cristian; Magiorkinis, Gkikas; Paraskevis, Dimitrios\n\n2012-07-01\n\nHIV-1 subtype B is predominant in Europe except in some countries from Eastern Europe which are characterized by a high prevalence of non-B subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). Romania is a particular case: the HIV-1 epidemic started with subtype F1 which is still the most prevalent. Previous studies have shown an increasing prevalence of subtype B which is the second most frequent one among the newly diagnosed individuals, followed by subtype C and several CRFs as well as unique recombinant forms (URFs). Our objective was to analyze in detail the characteristics (way of dispersal, association with transmission risk groups) of the subtype B infections in Romania by means of phylogenetic analysis. Among all the individuals sampled during 2003-2010, 71 out of 1127 patients (6.3%) have been identified to be infected with subtype B strains. The most frequent route of infection identified in HIV-1 subtype B patients in Romania was MSM transmission (39.6%), followed by the heterosexual route (35.2%). Many of the patients acquired the infection abroad, mainly in Western European countries. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the existence of a local transmission network (monophyletic clade) including 14 patients, mainly MSM living in the Bucharest area. We estimate the origin of the local transmission network that dates at the beginning of the 90s; the introduction of the F1 and C subtypes occurred earlier. The rest of the sequences were intermixed with reference strains sampled across Europe suggesting that single infection were not followed by subsequent dispersal within the local population. Although HIV-1 subtype B epidemic in Romania is recent, there is evidence for local spread among the MSMs, in addition to multiple introductions. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This phenomenon has been interpreted as the combined effect of both seismic source properties and site response of the large sedimentary basin. The thickness of the unconsolidated Quaternary deposits beneath the city is more than 200 m, the total depth of sediments is more than 1000 m. Complex basin geometry and the low seismic wave velocities of the sediments are primarily responsible for the large amplification and long duration experienced during earthquakes. For a better understanding of the geological structure under Bucharest, a number of investigations using non-invasive methods have been carried out. With the goal to analyse and extract the polarization and dispersion characteristics of the surface waves, ambient vibrations and low-magnitude earthquakes have been investigated using single station and array techniques. Love and Rayleigh dispersion curves (including higher modes), Rayleigh waves ellipticity and SH-wave fundamental frequency of resonance (f0SH) have been inverted simultaneously to estimate the shear wave velocity structure under Bucharest down to a depth of about 8 km. Information from existing borehole logs was used as prior to reduce the non-uniqueness of the inversion and to constrain the shallow part of the velocity model (<300 m). In this study, we use data from a 35-km diameter array (the URS experiment) installed by the National Institute for Earth Physics and by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology during 10 months in the period 2003-2004. The array consisted of 32 three-component seismological stations, deployed in the urban area of Bucharest and adjacent zones. The large size of the array and the broad-band nature of the available sensors gave us the possibility to characterize the surface wave dispersion at very low frequencies (0.05-1 Hz) using frequency-wavenumber techniques\n\nMoments of astronomy education in Bucharest\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRusu, Mircea V.; Stavinschi, Magda\n\n2008-09-01\n\nSelection from past astronomy education, activities, textbooks and curricula will be presented. Didactic aspects and comparison with physics education will be exemplified. The astronomy/science education along the time in Romania was roughly divided in four directions: very broad information texts for everybody, popular science, school textbooks, science fictions and astronomy/science literature, and exemplified using original texts. All categories were intended to extend literacy in science, but in different ways. The trends for different periods were outlined. The teaching of astronomy and astrophysics in high school and universities, with special attention to the Faculty of Physic from University of Bucharest are presented. Suggestions for future improvement of both related fields, physics and astronomy, will be one of the outcomes of our communication.\n\nGreenhouse gas reduction by recovery and utilization of landfill methane and CO{sub 2} technical and market feasibility study, Boului Landfill, Bucharest, Romania. Final report, September 30, 1997--September 19, 1998\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCook, W.J.; Brown, W.R.; Siwajek, L.\n\n1998-09-01\n\nThe project is a landfill gas to energy project rated at about 4 megawatts (electric) at startup, increasing to 8 megawatts over time. The project site is Boului Landfill, near Bucharest, Romania. The project improves regional air quality, reduces emission of greenhouse gases, controls and utilizes landfill methane, and supplies electric power to the local grid. The technical and economic feasibility of pre-treating Boului landfill gas with Acrion`s new landfill gas cleanup technology prior to combustion for power production us attractive. Acrion`s gas treatment provides several benefits to the currently structured electric generation project: (1) increase energy density of landfillmoreÂ Â» gas from about 500 Btu/ft{sup 3} to about 750 Btu/ft{sup 3}; (2) remove contaminants from landfill gas to prolong engine life and reduce maintenance;; (3) recover carbon dioxide from landfill gas for Romanian markets; and (4) reduce emission of greenhouse gases methane and carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gas emissions reduction attributable to successful implementation of the landfill gas to electric project, with commercial liquid CO{sub 2} recovery, is estimated to be 53 million metric tons of CO{sub 2} equivalent of its 15 year life.Â«Â less\n\nEarthquake early warning for Romania - most recent improvements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarmureanu, Alexandru; Elia, Luca; Martino, Claudio; Colombelli, Simona; Zollo, Aldo; Cioflan, Carmen; Toader, Victorin; Marmureanu, Gheorghe; Marius Craiu, George; Ionescu, Constantin\n\n2014-05-01\n\nEWS for Vrancea earthquakes uses the time interval (28-32 sec.) between the moment when the earthquake is detected by the local seismic network installed in the epicenter area (Vrancea) and the arrival time of the seismic waves in the protected area (Bucharest) to send earthquake warning to users. In the last years, National Institute for Earth Physics (NIEP) upgraded its seismic network in order to cover better the seismic zones of Romania. Currently the National Institute for Earth Physics (NIEP) operates a real-time seismic network designed to monitor the seismic activity on the Romania territory, dominated by the Vrancea intermediate-depth (60-200 km) earthquakes. The NIEP real-time network consists of 102 stations and two seismic arrays equipped with different high quality digitizers (Kinemetrics K2, Quanterra Q330, Quanterra Q330HR, PS6-26, Basalt), broadband and short period seismometers (CMG3ESP, CMG40T, KS2000, KS54000, KS2000, CMG3T,STS2, SH-1, S13, Ranger, gs21, Mark l22) and acceleration sensors (Episensor). Recent improvement of the seismic network and real-time communication technologies allows implementation of a nation-wide EEWS for Vrancea and other seismic sources from Romania. We present a regional approach to Earthquake Early Warning for Romania earthquakes. The regional approach is based on PRESTo (Probabilistic and Evolutionary early warning SysTem) software platform: PRESTo processes in real-time three channel acceleration data streams: once the P-waves arrival have been detected, it provides earthquake location and magnitude estimations, and peak ground motion predictions at target sites. PRESTo is currently implemented in real- time at National Institute for Earth Physics, Bucharest for several months in parallel with a secondary EEWS. The alert notification is issued only when both systems validate each other. Here we present the results obtained using offline earthquakes originating from Vrancea area together with several real\n\nUsing experimental data to reduce the single-building sigma of fragility curves: case study of the BRD tower in Bucharest, Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPerrault, Matthieu; Gueguen, Philippe; Aldea, Alexandru; Demetriu, Sorin\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe lack of knowledge concerning modelling existing buildings leads to signifiant variability in fragility curves for single or grouped existing buildings. This study aims to investigate the uncertainties of fragility curves, with special consideration of the single-building sigma. Experimental data and simplified models are applied to the BRD tower in Bucharest, Romania, a RC building with permanent instrumentation. A three-step methodology is applied: (1) adjustment of a linear MDOF model for experimental modal analysis using a Timoshenko beam model and based on Anderson's criteria, (2) computation of the structure's response to a large set of accelerograms simulated by SIMQKE software, considering twelve ground motion parameters as intensity measurements (IM), and (3) construction of the fragility curves by comparing numerical interstory drift with the threshold criteria provided by the Hazus methodology for the slight damage state. By introducing experimental data into the model, uncertainty is reduced to 0.02 considering S d ( f 1) as seismic intensity IM and uncertainty related to the model is assessed at 0.03. These values must be compared with the total uncertainty value of around 0.7 provided by the Hazus methodology.\n\nImproved seismic risk estimation for Bucharest, based on multiple hazard scenarios, analytical methods and new techniques\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nToma-Danila, Dragos; Florinela Manea, Elena; Ortanza Cioflan, Carmen\n\n2014-05-01\n\nBucharest, capital of Romania (with 1678000 inhabitants in 2011), is one of the most exposed big cities in Europe to seismic damage. The major earthquakes affecting the city have their origin in the Vrancea region. The Vrancea intermediate-depth source generates, statistically, 2-3 shocks with moment magnitude >7.0 per century. Although the focal distance is greater than 170 km, the historical records (from the 1838, 1894, 1908, 1940 and 1977 events) reveal severe effects in the Bucharest area, e.g. intensities IX (MSK) for the case of 1940 event. During the 1977 earthquake, 1420 people were killed and 33 large buildings collapsed. The nowadays building stock is vulnerable both due to construction (material, age) and soil conditions (high amplification, generated within the weak consolidated Quaternary deposits, their thickness is varying 250-500m throughout the city). A number of 373 old buildings, out of 2563, evaluated by experts are more likely to experience severe damage/collapse in the next major earthquake. The total number of residential buildings, in 2011, was 113900. In order to guide the mitigation measures, different studies tried to estimate the seismic risk of Bucharest, in terms of buildings, population or economic damage probability. Unfortunately, most of them were based on incomplete sets of data, whether regarding the hazard or the building stock in detail. However, during the DACEA Project, the National Institute for Earth Physics, together with the Technical University of Civil Engineering Bucharest and NORSAR Institute managed to compile a database for buildings in southern Romania (according to the 1999 census), with 48 associated capacity and fragility curves. Until now, the developed real-time estimation system was not implemented for Bucharest. This paper presents more than an adaptation of this system to Bucharest; first, we analyze the previous seismic risk studies, from a SWOT perspective. This reveals that most of the studies don't use\n\nEpidemiology of gingivitis in schoolchildren in Bucharest, Romania: a cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFunieru, C; Klinger, A; BÄicuÈ, C; Funieru, E; Dumitriu, H T; Dumitriu, A\n\n2017-04-01\n\nGingivitis is the most prevalent oral disease in children, being strongly associated to social gradients. Many studies have reported different results concerning the extent and intra-oral distribution of gingivitis in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiologic parameters and socio-related risk factors of gingivitis in the 10-17-year-old Bucharest schoolchildren population and to analyze its intra-oral distribution. Cross-sectional data were obtained from 1595 schoolchildren, social condition being assigned using a simple questionnaire. Classes of students were used as clusters in a single-stage cluster sampling method. An intra-oral exam was performed for all the children included in this study. Silness and LÃ¶e scores, prevalence and the extent of gingivitis were calculated. The gingival scores showed a mild inflammation and the prevalence of gingivitis was 91%. Boys had a higher gingival (0.19 vs. 0.18; p < 0.05) and plaque scores (0.71 vs. 0.59; p < 0.01) than girls. Children who did not live in overcrowded households, whose parents had a better education and those who had direct access to school dental services displayed better gingival conditions (p < 0.05). Gingivitis was more severe on the upper teeth, with the maximum score being reached at the right upper lateral incisor (0.63 on distal surface). Gingival condition in Bucharest schoolchildren population was associated to social gradients. School dental services are also another factor that seems to be related with gingivitis.

The promotion of nature-based solutions represents an efficient approach to meet sustainability targets in cities and improve the quality of life of citizens. The association of large components of green infrastructure, such as urban parks, with physical activity can counteract the sedentary lifestyle endemic to cities and improve the overall health and well-being of individuals (Carrus et al., 2013; Scopelliti et al., 2016). By promoting a sustainable means of transport and connecting green spaces within a highly urbanized city, bicycle lanes represent an effective tool for associating physical activity with nature in cities allowing bicycle users to benefit from the positive health effects of nature-based solutions. Our study focuses on the potential of bicycle lanes to improve functional connectivity among green spaces. We administered 820 questionnaires in 34 green spaces (i.e., urban parks) in Bucharest, Romania, to identify the factors influencing the use of bicycle lanes connecting urban parks and to understand which planning criteria for bicycle lanes are considered as the most important by park visitors. We applied binary and ordinal logistic regressions and found that the factors affecting bicycle lane use are illegally parked cars and lack of accessibility to urban parks. The criteria preferred by park visitors for bicycle lane planning are determined by experience level and frequency of bicycle use. To develop a functional and integrated bicycle lane network that can make cities healthier and more sustainable, policy makers are advised to engage in a public participatory process and focus on the needs of bicycle users.

Molecular analyses were conducted on HIV-1 sequences from IDUs comprising 51% and 20% of the diagnosed cases among IDUs during 2011-2013 for Greece and Romania, respectively. Phylodynamic analyses were performed using the newly developed birth-death serial skyline model which allows estimating of important epidemiological parameters, as implemented in BEAST programme. Most infections (>90%) occurred within four and three IDU local transmission networks in Athens and Bucharest, respectively. For all Romanian clusters, the viral strains originated from local circulating strains, whereas in Athens, the local strains seeded only two of the four sub-outbreaks. Birth-death skyline plots suggest a more explosive nature for sub-outbreaks in Bucharest than in Athens. In Athens, two sub-outbreaks had been controlled (Re<1.0) by 2013 and two appeared to be endemic (Reâ¼1). In Bucharest one outbreak continued to expand (Re>1.0) and two had been controlled (Re<1.0). The lead times were shorter for the outbreak in Athens than in Bucharest. Enhanced molecular surveillance proved useful to gain information about the origin, causal pathways, dispersal patterns and transmission dynamics of the outbreaks that can be useful in a public health setting.

Over time, there has been a transition from an artisanal method of prosthetics production to modern concepts and materials, including a re-education through virtual reality. The conditions for an efficient fitting of a prosthesis include the necessity that the prosthesis respects the form and function of the lost limb, both anatomically and biomechanically. Prosthetics are made individually, personalized according to sex, age, physiological characteristics, profession and preference. In our country, thoracic limb prosthetics has a relatively short-recorded history of approximately a century, the most preeminent centers being in Iasi, Cluj and Bucharest. Currently, thoracic limb prosthetics, and particularly hand prosthetics, are in a period of development. A technique for amputation and stump reamputation called âcircumferential osteoneuromioplastyâ (CONM) is currently being used in the Orthopedics and Trauma Clinic of the Central Military University Emergency Hospital in Bucharest. The method was created with the purpose of obtaining distinct myoelectric signals of better quality, following the contraction of each muscle. The CONM method can be used in conjuncture with both the new hand prostheses that are currently available in Romania, and with the model that is being developed by a mixed team from the Polytechnic University in Bucharest, in collaboration with the Central Military University Emergency Hospital in Bucharest.

The selected test site is Bucharest (Romania), a built-up area characterized by the usual urban complex pattern: mixture of buildings with different height levels, paved roads, vegetation, and water bodies. First, the DSMs were generated following the standard interferometric processing chain. Then, the accuracy of the DSMs was analyzed against the SPOT HRS model (30 m resolution at the equator). A DSM derived by optical stereoscopic processing of SPOT 5 HRG data and also the SRTM (3 arc seconds resolution at the equator) DSM have been included in the comparative analysis.\n\nThe Effects of Early Experience on Face Recognition: An Event-Related Potential Study of Institutionalized Children in Romania\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMoulson, Margaret C.; Westerlund, Alissa; Fox, Nathan A.; Zeanah, Charles H.; Nelson, Charles A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nData are reported from 3 groups of children residing in Bucharest, Romania.

A total of eight patients, including a nine-year-old child, were included between June 2011 and June 2012, in the Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Bucharest, Romania. Seven cases presented during summer months and one in spring. Six patients presented a generalized rash with fever, myalgia and skin eschar. The last two patients presented a typical SENLAT syndrome, characterized by scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy. Using serological tools, we confirmed for the first time two cases of Rickettsia massiliae, the agent of spotted fever disease, and one case of Rickettsia slovaca, and one case of R. slovacaRickettsia raoultii the agents of SENLAT syndrome.

Achieving an objective and suitable decision making may become a challenge. In such situations decision support systems (DSS) have been developed. DSS can assist in the decision making process, offering support on how a decision should be made, rather than what decision should be made (Simon, 1979). This in turn potentially involves a huge number of stakeholders and criteria. Regarding seismic risk, Bucharest City is highly vulnerable (Mandrescu et al., 2007). The aim of this study is to implement a spatial decision support system in order to secure a suitable shelter in case of an earthquake occurrence in the historical centre of Bucharest City. In case of a seismic risk, a shelter is essential for sheltering people who lost their homes or whose homes are in danger of collapsing while people at risk receive first aid in the post-disaster phase. For the present study, the SMCE Module for ILWIS 3.4 was used. The methodology included structuring the problem by creating a decision tree, standardizing and weighting of the criteria. The results showed that the most suitable buildings are Tania Hotel, Hanul lui Manuc, The National Bank of Romania, The Romanian Commercial Bank and The National History Museum.\n\nRomania’s Intelligence Community: From an Instrument of Dictatorship to Serving Democracy\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2007-01-01\n\nControl of Armed Forces (DCAF), (Bucharest, 2004). 32 Profil, nr. 7, March 2005, p. 9. http://www.sri.ro/index.php?nav= biblioteca &subnav=publicatii&tabela...pp. 14â17, http://www.sri.ro/ index.php?nav= biblioteca &subnav=publicatii&tabela=publicatii_bl 66 Interview by Ion Petrescu with General Lieutenant dr... biblioteca &subnav=publicatii&tabela=publicatii_bl 83 Radu Tudor, ââRomania Creates New Counterterrorism Unit,ââ Janeâs Intelligence Review, 1 January 2005\n\nInforme Especial: O Ensino e a Promocao do Portugues na Romenia (Special Report: The Teaching and Promotion of Portuguese in Romania).\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPloae-Hanganu, Mariana\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThis article reflects the most significant advances made in the teaching and promotion of Portuguese in Romania in the past 20 years.

The speech was good in most patients but wide clefts had a high percentage of fistulas, abnormal speech due to short length and limited mobility of the soft palate. In 2009, the protocol was changed to Gothenburg Delayed Hard Palate Closure, (DHPC) technique. The present evaluation was performed to study the implementation of this technique. One hundred and sixty-eight patients with cleft palate were admitted, 89 isolated cleft palate (ICP), 53 unilateral (UCLP) and 26 bilateral (BCLP). In these, 228 surgical interventions were performed. Soft Palate Repair (SPR) and Hard Palate Repair (HPR) were performed with the DHPC procedure. The transfer to this technique was successfully performed in three steps: one team visit to Gothenburg by a surgeon from MSC and two visits by surgeons from Gothenburg to the MSC. Patients with SPR and HPR were operated on without major complications and there were no differences in results between Gothenburg surgeons and MSC surgeons. The interventions with SPR and HPR technique were proven to be easy to teach and learn and successfully performed without major complications. For cleft patients at MSC hospital it has meant earlier surgery, less re-operations and complications. This report shows a successful change of strategy for palatal repair with improved outcome regarding surgery. In future, speech and growth will be followed on a regular basis and will be compared with results from the Gothenburg Cleft Team.\n\nCity landscape changes effects on land surface temperature in Bucharest metropolitan area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSavastru, Dan M.; Zoran, Maria A.; Savastru, Roxana S.; Dida, Adrian I.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThis study investigated the influences of city land cover changes and extreme climate events on land surface temperature in relationship with several biophysical variables in Bucharest metropolitan area of Romania through satellite and in-situ monitoring data. Remote sensing data from IKONOS, Landsat TM/ETM+ and time series MODIS Terra/Aqua and NOAA AVHRR sensors have been used to assess urban land cover- temperature interactions over 2000 - 2016 period. Time series Thermal InfraRed (TIR) satellite remote sensing data in synergy with meteorological data (air temperatureAT, precipitations, wind, solar radiation, etc.) were applied mainly for analyzing land surface temperature (LST) pattern and its relationship with surface landscape characteristics, assessing urban heat island (UHI), and relating urban land cover temperatures (LST). The land surface temperature, a key parameter for urban thermal characteristics analysis, was also analyzed in relation with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at city level. Results show that in the metropolitan area ratio of impervious surface in Bucharest increased significantly during investigated period, the intensity of urban heat island and heat wave events being most significant. The correlation analyses revealed that, at the pixel-scale, LST and AT possessed a strong positive correlation with percent impervious surfaces and negative correlation with vegetation abundances at metropolitan scale respectively. The NDVI was significantly correlated with precipitation. The spatial average air temperatures in urban test areas rise with the expansion of the urban size.\n\nEstablished Population of the Invasive Mosquito Species Aedes albopictus in Romania, 2012-14.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrioteasa, Liviu F; Dinu, Sorin; FÄlcuÅ£Ä, Elena; Ceianu, Cornelia S\n\n2015-06-01\n\nDuring an entomological investigation carried out in Bucharest and surroundings in fall of 2012, 45 adult mosquitoes (38 females and 7 males) of Aedes albopictus were collected in a neighborhood from the southern area of the city. The morphological identification of the species was further confirmed by sequencing 2 mitochondrial DNA markers: the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 genes. Aedes albopictus was collected again in 2013 in the same area from July until October. During late summer the species was found also in another location in the city, downtown Bucharest. Larvae were found in water barrels and other types of household containers, as well as in rain catch basins. In 2014, following a nuisance complaint of a Bucharest inhabitant, the entomological investigation found aggressive Ae. albopictus adults on his property that harbored many mosquito larvae in container-type breeding habitats. These findings are the 1st records of this invasive species and of its breeding population in Romania, and show maintenance of the species over 2 winter seasons. Surveillance of the species outside the area of the capital city was not performed, therefore it is not known whether Ae. albopictus has been introduced in other regions of the country. The presence of Ae. albopictus has been reported every year (2012-14) to competent public health authorities, stressing on the importance of surveillance and of implementation of control measures.\n\nJPRS Report, East Europe\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1991-06-14\n\nROBOTNICZA 28 May] .... 1 Eger Conference on Transylvania Criticized [Bucharest ROMANIA LIBERA 11 May] 1 Views of Parties on Eger Seminar...Transylvania Criticized 91BA0757A Bucharest ROMANIA LIBERA in Romanian 11 May 91 pp 1-2 [Article by Ion Pavelescu: \"Too Much Fanaticism, Too Little...reduced to learning from UDMR [Democratic Associations of Hungarians in Romania ] sources that the filmed document had been edited in the style in\n\nAir Shipment of Spent Nuclear Fuel from Romania to Russia\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nIgor Bolshinsky; Ken Allen; Lucian Biro\n\nRomania successfully completed the worldâs first air shipment of spent nuclear fuel transported in Type B(U) casks under existing international laws and without shipment license special exceptions when the last Romanian highly enriched uranium (HEU) spent nuclear fuel was transported to the Russian Federation in June 2009. This air shipment required the design, fabrication, and licensing of special 20 foot freight containers and cask tiedown supports to transport the eighteen TUK 19 shipping casks on a Russian commercial cargo aircraft.

T.; Mudura, R.; Nicolescu, G.; Purcarea-Ciulacu, V.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nAfter 1990 there were environmental changes at national, European and global level which led to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases. Among these diseases, those transmitted by vectors were installed on very large areas where pathogens entered the complex transmission cycles within the local ecosystems. Environmental changes were generated by climatic (temperature and precipitation), geomorphologic (altitude) and anthropogenic (land cover / land use) changes. Due to these environmental changes it became necessary to anticipate, prevent and control the epidemics in order to avoid major crises of natural and socio-economic systems. In these circumstances, the risk of re-emergence of West Nile virus infection increased, thus becoming a public health problem for Romania. Our research consisted in assessing this risk, depending on environmental changes that can influence the presence and space-time distribution as well as the dynamics of the elements of virus transmission cycle. Study areas were selected so that they should meet, on the one hand, very different natural ecosystems and on the other hand should include continuously changing anthropogenic ecosystems that provide optimal conditions for the vector-borne West Nile virus. These areas were: the Danube Delta including Razim-Sinoe complex (Tulcea County), Bucharest Metropolitan Area (BMA) (Bucharest and Ilfov & Giurgiu Counties). The Danube Delta lagoon area is the gateway to West Nile virus in Romania. During the neurological infection epidemic with West Nile virus in 1996, in BMA were recorded 60% of the total number of human cases. For the period 2009 - 2011 the authors developed risk maps to West Nile virus vectors to vertebrate hosts depending on climatic, geomorphologic and anthropogenic changes. Maps were made using ArcGis - ArcMap software, depending on the mean annual temperature and precipitation. We were used by the altitude risk map the hypsographic map of Romania and for the risk map\n\nAssessment of early warning system performance and improvements since it is in operational phase in Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIonescu, Constantin; Marmureanu, Alexandru; Marmureanu, Gheorghe; Ortansa Cioflan, Carmen\n\n2017-04-01\n\nEarthquake represents a major natural disaster for Romanian territory. The main goal following the occurrence of a strong earthquake is to minimize the total number of fatalities. A rapid early warning system (REWS) was developed in Romania in order to provide 25-35 seconds warning time to Bucharest facilities for the earthquakes with M>5.0. The system consists of four components: a network of strong motion sensors installed in the epicentral area, a redundant communication network, an automatic analyzing system located in the Romanian Data Centre and an alert distribution system. The detection algorithm is based on the magnitude computation using strong motion data and rapid evaluation and scaling relation between the maximum P-wave acceleration measured in the epicentral area and the higher ground motion amplitude recorded in Bucharest. In order to reduce the damages caused by earthquakes, the exploitation of the up to date technology is very important. The information is the key point in the disaster management, and the internet is one of the most used instrument, implying also low costs. The Rapid Early Warning System was expanded to cover all countries affected by major earthquakes originating in the Vrancea seismic area and reduce their impact on existing installations of national interest in neighbouring Romania and elsewhere. REWS provides an efficient instrument for prevention and reaction based on the integrated system for seismic detection in South-Eastern Europe. REWS has been operational since 2013 and sends alert the authorities, hazardous facilities in Romania and Bulgaria (NPP, emergency response agencies etc.) and to public via twitter and some smartphone applications developed in the house. Also, NIEP is part of the UNESCO initiative case on developing a platform on earthquake early warning systems (IP-MEP) that aims to promote and strengthen the development of earthquake early warning systems in earthquake-prone regions of the world by sharing\n\nPhylodynamic and Phylogeographic Patterns of the HIV Type 1 Subtype F1 Parenteral Epidemic in Romania\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuÃ©, StÃ©phane; Buckton, Andrew J.; Myers, Richard E.; Duiculescu, Dan; Ene, Luminita; Oprea, Cristiana; Tardei, Gratiela; Rugina, Sorin; Mardarescu, Mariana; Floch, Corinne; Notheis, Gundula; ZÃ¶hrer, Bettina; Cane, Patricia A.; Pillay, Deenan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbstract In the late 1980s an HIV-1 epidemic emerged in Romania that was dominated by subtype F1. The main route of infection is believed to be parenteral transmission in children. We sequenced partial pol coding regions of 70 subtype F1 samples from children and adolescents from the PENTA-EPPICC network of which 67 were from Romania. Phylogenetic reconstruction using the sequences and other publically available global subtype F sequences showed that 79% of Romanian F1 sequences formed a statistically robust monophyletic cluster. The monophyletic cluster was epidemiologically linked to parenteral transmission in children. Coalescent-based analysis dated the origins of the parenteral epidemic to 1983 [1981â1987; 95% HPD]. The analysis also shows that the epidemic's effective population size has remained fairly constant since the early 1990s suggesting limited onward spread of the virus within the population. Furthermore, phylogeographic analysis suggests that the root location of the parenteral epidemic was Bucharest.

The paper presents old and new data connected with these disasters obtained not only by us but also by others laboratories from Romania. It is an attempt to mark the mainly aspects regarding the radioactive contamination in our country connected with these catastrophes. After the Chernobyl accident the radioactive cloud passage over Romania on NE - SW direction brought relatively intesive radionuclide deposition. On this direction the highest deposition were found in the areas where this passage during April 30-st and May 1-st were accompanied by rainfalls. In the rain water and fresh sediment colected at May 1-st, 1986 and measured the next days, all radionuclide species from Chernobyl could be identified [1]. Additional measurements of 90Sr and 239/240Pu have been made several years later in different environmental samples (roof sediment, soil, pollen, sand, roof-water, street dust) collected in 1986 from Cluj-Napoca, Romania [2]. In the case of Fukushima disaster the air transport from west and north-west brought small quantities of radionuclides over the Romanian teritorry. Even if in this case the radioactive cloud was very dilluted, 131I could be clearly identified and measured in air, rain water and other products as: milk, vegetables, grass, fresh meat from the NW of Romania [3]. Measurements have been also conducted in Bucharest and Pitesti. During the last 5 years suplimentary 137Cs measurements were made in different areas as an attempt to use this radionuclide as soil and sediment tracer. [1]. C.

In early October 1996, entomologic and avian investigations of the epidemic were conducted in the city of Bucharest and nearby rural areas. Thirty (41%) of 73 domestic fowl sampled had neutralizing antibody to WN virus, including 5 of 13 ducks (38%), 1 of 1 goose, 19 of 52 chickens (37%), 1 of 1 peahen, and 4 of 6 turkeys (67%). Seroprevalence in domestic fowl (27%, or 7 of 26) from the urban Bucharest site was not significantly different (P = 0.08, by Fisher's exact test) than rates at three rural sites (50%, or 23 of 46). Serum collected from one of 12 Passeriformes, an Erithacus rubecula, was positive for neutralizing antibody to WN virus. A total of 5,577 mosquitoes representing seven taxa were collected. Culex pipiens pipiens accounted for 96% of the mosquitoes collected. A single virus isolate, RO97-50, was obtained from a pool of 30 Cx. p. pipiens females aspirated from the walls and ceiling of a blockhouse located near the center of Bucharest, resulting in a minimum infection rate of 0.19 per 1,000. Antisera prepared against RO97-50 failed to distinguish among RO97-50, WN virus strain Eg101, and Kunjin (KUN) virus strain MRM16. A 2,323-basepair DNA fragment of the envelope (E) glycoprotein gene from RO97-50 and a Romanian WN virus strain obtained from a human cerebrospinal fluid sample, RO96-1030, were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of 23 WN virus strains and one KUN virus strain using the amino acid and nucleotide sequences for a small portion of the E gene suggest the existence of two large lineages of viruses.

Prior to the Conference, there appeared to be a general consensus that population growth was the crucial issue although it was recognized that population growth had to be considered in the context of socioeconomic and cultural development. What developed at Bucharest was a clear division between the developed countries who favored population control and implementation of family planning programs by 1986 and the developing countries who rejected the idea of population control unless it was associated with the redistribution of world resources. The reality of people having large families because they are poor cannot be denied, but, simultaneously, the problem of increasing numbers and their impact on the quality of life, nutrition, housing, education, and employment must be faced. Since affluent countries cannot be relied upon concerning the redistribution of their wealth, developing countries can bring about some change by redistributing the wealth within their countries. Adult literacy programs have been identified as a means to promote socioeconomic development, but these programs will only prove successful if they involve the adults in the process of learning by means of problem solving and cause them to reflect on their socioeconomic situation with the result of reinvolving themselves in society in order to change it.\n\nProgramme Note: Street Children in Bucharest.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAlexandrescu, Gabriela\n\n1996-01-01\n\nInterviewed Bucharest street children, most between 11 and 15 years of age.

City environment includes intense emissions arising from traffic (about 1 million cars per day), five thermo-electrical power-generation stations, that use both natural gas and oil derivatives for power generation and domestic heating, and from industrial sources (more than 800 small and medium plants). In the present work we performed an extensive analysis of the air pollution state for the Bucharest area (inside and outside the city) using filter measurement aerosol data PM10 and PM2.5. Data spanning over first year of continuous sampling (2005) were taken from the city Air Quality Monitoring Network, which consists of eight sampling stations: three industrial and two traffic, one EPA urban background, one suburban and one regional station located outside of Bucharest. The objective was to assess the PM10 recorded levels and their degree of compliance with the EU-legislated air quality standards and to provide a statistical investigation of the factors controlling seasonal and spatial variations of PM levels. PM10 relationships with other measured air pollutants (SO2, CO, NOx) and meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind velocity and direction) were investigated by statistical analysis. Back trajectory modeling and wind direction frequency distributions were used to identify the origin of the polluted air masses. Contribution of combustion (slopes) and non-combustion (intercepts) sources to PM10 recorded levels was quantified by linear analysis, for two seasonal periods: cold (15 October-14 April) and warm (15 April-14 October). PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were compared with corresponding values in other European urban areas. Main conclusions are as follows: Traffic and industrial sites contribute to the\n\nWhooping cough in South-East Romania: a 1-year study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDinu, Sorin; Guillot, Sophie; Dragomirescu, Cristiana Cerasella; Brun, Delphine; LazÄr, Stefan; Vancea, Geta; Ionescu, Biatrice Mariana; Gherman, Mariana Felicia; Bjerkestrand, Andreea-Florina-Dana; Ungureanu, Vasilica; Guiso, Nicole; Damian, Maria\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe incidence of whooping cough in Romania is substantially underestimated, and, as noted by the health authorities, this is mostly due to the lack of both awareness and biological diagnosis. We conducted a 1-year study in Bucharest in order to assess the circulation of Bordetella pertussis, the main etiological agent of whooping cough. Fifty-one subjects suspected of whooping cough were enrolled. Culture, real-time PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for laboratory diagnosis. Whooping cough patients (63%) were distributed among all age groups, and most were unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or had been vaccinated more than 5 years previously. Bordetella holmesii DNA was detected in 22% of the bordetellosis cases; these patients included adults; teenagers; and, surprisingly, young children. B. pertussis isolates were similar to the clinical isolates currently circulating elsewhere in Europe. One isolate does not express pertactin, an antigen included in some acellular pertussis vaccines. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Few studies regarding the necrophagous entomofauna from buried remains have been performed to date. In contrast to the exposed carcasses, the accessibility of soil to insects is limited due to burial depth and is dependent on soil type. This study highlights the colonization behavior of Conicera similis (Haliday 1833) (Diptera: Phoridae) during carcass decomposition, a previously unobserved taxon in Romania. Adult and larvae specimens were collected from rat (Rattus norvegicus) carcasses buried at 40â¯cm depth in an urban park environment in June 2016 during active decomposition and their presence and activity period was correlated with the environmental parameters variation. Bacterial diversity from C. similis female adult and larvae specimens was determined via 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing to further characterize these commonly encountered and forensically important necrophagous insects. This report signals the easternmost geographical location in Europe (Bucharest, Romania) of C. similis to date. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

Their environmental changes can be investigated on different spatial and temporal scales. Urban and peri-urban environment dynamics is of great interest for future planning and decision making as well as in frame of local and regional changes. Changes in urban land cover include changes in biotic diversity, actual and potential primary productivity, soil quality, runoff, and sedimentation rates, and cannot be well understood without the knowledge of land use change that drives them. The study focuses on the assessment of environmental features changes for Bucharest metropolitan area, Romania by satellite remote sensing and in-situ monitoring data. Rational feature selection from the varieties of spectral channels in the optical wavelengths of electromagnetic spectrum (VIS and NIR) is very important for effective analysis and information extraction of remote sensing data. Based on comprehensively analyses of the spectral characteristics of remote sensing data is possibly to derive environmental changes in urban areas. The information quantity contained in a band is an important parameter in evaluating the band. The deviation and entropy are often used to show information amount. Feature selection is one of the most important steps in recognition and classification of remote sensing images. Therefore, it is necessary to select features before classification. The optimal features are those that can be used to distinguish objects easily and correctly. Three factorsâthe information quantity of bands, the correlation between bands and the spectral characteristic (e.g. absorption specialty) of classified objects in test area Bucharest have been considered in our study. As, the spectral characteristic of an object is influenced by many factors, being difficult to define optimal feature parameters to distinguish all the objects in a whole area, a method of multi-level feature selection\n\n[Catastrophic results of the restrictive population policy in Romania].\n\nPubMed\n\nPresl, J\n\n1991-02-01\n\nThe dictator Ceaucescu came to power in Romania in 1965, by which time the birth rate had decreased from 25 children/1000 fertile women in 1955 to 15.6/1000. Under a 1966 law, induced abortion was allowed only for women 45, for those with 4 or more children, or in life-threatening situations. IUDs, condoms, and spermicides were regulated to the black market. Pregnancies were registered, and women up to age 5 were subjected to a compulsory monthly gynecological examination at their workplace. The doctors' pay depended on the fulfillment of the prescribed monthly birth plan. Women aged 20-30 were given quarterly pregnancy tests whose outcome was checked by a regional demographic committee. Illegal induced abortion was punished with up to 12 years of imprisonment, and self-induced abortion was punished by 6 months to 2 years of prison. In 1984, the goal was set to increase the birth rate to 20/1000 to attain a population of 30 million by the year 2000. Instead the 1967 rate of 27.4/1000 dropped to 14.3/1000 by 1983. Maternal mortality increased from 86/100,000 live births in 1966 to 140 in 1981 and 150 in 1984, mostly abortion-related. In 1988, 519 maternal deaths occurred for 380,000 births (505 had to do with abortion). In 1985, infant mortality was 25.6/1000 live births. The premature birth rate was 16% in Bucharest in 1974 vs. 5-8% in the rest of Europe. 13,000 children (1500 in Bucharest) living in shelters maintained by the state were available for adoption for hard currency in Belgium, France, Israel, and Italy; the number of adoptions increased. Down's syndrome and mental retardation were prevalence among them.\n\nSecure Transportation of HEU in Romania\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNone\n\n2009-07-06\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration has announced the final shipments of Russian-origin highly enriched uranium (HEU) nuclear fuel from Romania. The material was removed and returned to Russia by air for storage at two secure nuclear facilities, making Romania the first country to remove all HEU since President Obama outlined his commitment to securing all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years. This was also the first time NNSA has shipped spent HEU by airplane, a development that will help accelerate efforts to meet the Presidents objective.\n\nInfant mortality evolution in Romania: perspectives from a country in transition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurlea, A.-M.; Muntele, I.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIn the last two decades transition was a word used to describe the important mutations that have characterized social and economic structures in Romania. All the changes left their mark on every aspects of life including on population health status, and all modifications were reflected in the evolution of health indicators. Considered one of the most sensitive indicators of living conditions, population health literacy level and healthcare system efficiency infant mortality rate is a negative indicator which reflects the intensity of children deaths before their first anniversary. Based on the current statistical data collected at county level, this research aims to underline the existing spatial differences in Romania at county level, to identify spatial patterns, time trend and to point out the territories that need special attention and a more profound analysis for understanding the causes that are generating them. Using mathematical and statistical methods we have calculated infant mortality for a previous and available period of time (1990 - 2010) and identified a trend influenced by exogenous and endogenous factors. With the help of GIS techniques we have created cartographic material for allowing us an easier identification of spatial disparities. Following the global trend, Romania achieved significant progress in reduction infant mortality. From values that exceeded 26 â° at the beginning of the nineties this indicator has continued to diminish until 9.79 â° in 2010. But, with all the improvements, value is still double in compare with European Union average. Although characteristic for Romania is the general downward trend, at the county level there can be identified different types of evolution and different spatial pattern. Having the lowest economic development level in the country, Northeast and Southeast counties maintain high values for infant mortality rate. Positive examples are given by Bucharest and some central and western districts, all with\n\nTesting Method for External Cladding Systems - Incerc Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSimion, A.; Dragne, H.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThis research presents a new testing method in a natural scale for external cladding systems tested on buildings with minimum than 3 floors [1]. The testing method is unique in Romania and it is similar about many fire testing current methods from European Union states. Also, presents the fire propagation and the effect of fire smoke on the building faÃ§ade composed of thermal insulation. Laboratory of testing and research for building fire safety from National Institute INCERC Bucharest, provides a test method for determining the fire performance characteristics of non-loadbearing external cladding systems and external wall insulation systems when applied to the face of a building and exposed to an external fire under controlled conditions [2]. The fire exposure is representative of an external fire source or a fully-developed (post-flashover) fire in a room, venting through an opening such as a window aperture that exposes the cladding to the effects of external flames, or an external fire source. On the future, fire tests will be experimented for answer demande a number of high-profile fires where the external facade of tall buildings provided a route for vertical fire spread.\n\nRisk-targeted maps for Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVacareanu, Radu; Pavel, Florin; Craciun, Ionut; Coliba, Veronica; Arion, Cristian; Aldea, Alexandru; Neagu, Cristian\n\n2018-03-01\n\nRomania has one of the highest seismic hazard levels in Europe. The seismic hazard is due to a combination of local crustal seismic sources, situated mainly in the western part of the country and the Vrancea intermediate-depth seismic source, which can be found at the bend of the Carpathian Mountains. Recent seismic hazard studies have shown that there are consistent differences between the slopes of the seismic hazard curves for sites situated in the fore-arc and back-arc of the Carpathian Mountains. Consequently, in this study we extend this finding to the evaluation of the probability of collapse of buildings and finally to the development of uniform risk-targeted maps. The main advantage of uniform risk approach is that the target probability of collapse will be uniform throughout the country. Finally, the results obtained are discussed in the light of a recent study with the same focus performed at European level using the hazard data from SHARE project. The analyses performed in this study have pointed out to a dominant influence of the quantile of peak ground acceleration used for anchoring the fragility function. This parameter basically alters the shape of the risk-targeted maps shifting the areas which have higher collapse probabilities from eastern Romania to western Romania, as its exceedance probability increases. Consequently, a uniform procedure for deriving risk-targeted maps appears as more than necessary.\n\nAnalysis of the seismic wavefield in the Moesian Platform (Bucharest area) for hazard assessment purposes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nManea, Elena Florinela; Michel, Clotaire; Hobiger, Manuel; FÃ¤h, Donat; Cioflan, Carmen Ortanza; Radulian, Mircea\n\n2017-09-01\n\nDuring large earthquakes generated at intermediate depth in the Vrancea seismic zone, the ground motion recorded in Bucharest (Romania) is characterized by predominant long periods with strong amplification. Time-frequency analysis highlights the generation of low frequency surface waves (<1 Hz) for sufficiently strong and superficial events. This phenomenon has been explained by the influence of both source mechanism (radiation pattern, directivity effects) and mechanical properties of the local geological structure (geological layering and geometry). The main goal of our study is to better characterize and understand the seismic wavefield produced by earthquakes in the area of Bucharest, taking into account its location in the centre of the Moesian Platform, a large sedimentary basin (450 km long, 300 km wide and up to 20 km deep). To this aim, we identify the contribution of different seismic surface waves, such as the ones produced at the edges of this large sedimentary basin or multipath interference waves (Airy phases of Love and Rayleigh waves), on ground motion. The data from a 35 km diameter array (URS experiment) were used. The array was installed by the National Institute for Earth Physics in cooperation with the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology and operated during 10 months in 2003 and 2004 in the urban area of Bucharest and adjacent zones. The earthquake wavefield recorded by the URS array was analysed using the MUSIQUE technique. This technique analyses the three-component signals of all sensors of a seismic array together. The analysis includes 19 earthquakes with epicentral distances from 100 to 1560 km and with various backazimuths with enough energy at low frequencies (0.1-1 Hz), within the resolution range of the array. For all events, the largest portion of energy is arriving from the source direction and the wavefield is dominated by Love waves. The results of the array analyses clearly indicate a significant scattering corresponding to 2-D\n\nTranslations on Eastern Europe, Political, Sociological, and Military Affairs, No. 1566\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1978-07-20\n\nGermany x Hungary x Poland x Romania Yugoslavia 17b. ldcntificr.s/Open-Ended Terms Propaganda Political Science Sociology Military...Energy Supply Problems (Slawomir Popowski; TRYBUNA LUDU, 29 Jun 78) 82 ROMANIA Manescu Addresses CEMA Session in Bucharest (Manea Manescu...the RCP Central Committee, the government of the Socialist Republic of Romania and to you personally, Comrade Manescu, for the warm reception\n\nA Long Journey of Mathematics and Astronomy in Romania\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStavinschi, Magda\n\n2010-10-01\n\nBucharest Astronomical Observatory celebrated recently its centenary. Its founders were all mathematicians or, better said, astronomers specialized in celestial mechanics. Their first doctoral theses were defended at Sorbonne, in the second half of the 19th century, under the guidance of the greatest specialists of the time. After they returned home, they continued what they had begun in Paris, namely celestial mechanics. The instruments they ordered and the first programmes of astronomical observations had an increasingly closer relation to mathematics, as they referred to astrometry and especially to stellar catalogues. Naturally, there were also astrophysical concerns, timid ones in the beginning, and then ever larger, especially beginning with the International Geophysical Year. The evolution of world astronomy, as well as that of Romania, seems to be following but one direction: astrophysics. The truth is that astrometry and celestial mechanics continue to lie at the basis of all astrophysical researches, actually in an entirely new and modern form. The astrometry schools recently organized, the new astrometry textbooks, as well as the IAU working groups dedicated to modern astrometry prove that the long journey of mathematics and astronomy is not over yet.\n\nGround based and airborne atmospheric measurements near bucharest\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNemuc, Anca; Boscornea, Andreea; Belegante, Livio; Vasilescu, Jeni; Vajaiac, Sorin; Ene, Dragos; Marmureanu, Luminita; Andrei, Simona\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis paper presents the results from a coordinated approach for atmospheric investigation, exploring synergies between different techniques.

The urban heat island in Bucharest was analyzed through a network of sensors located in 56 points (47 inside the administrative boundary of the city, 9 outside) 2009-2011. The network lost progressively its initial density, but was reformed during a new phase, 2013-2015. Time series satellite images from MODIS were intersected with the sensors for both phases. Statistical analysis were conducted to identify the temporal and spatial pattern of extreme temperatures in Bucharest. Several environmental factors like albedou, presence and absence of vegetation were used to fit a regression model between MODIS satellite products sensors in order to upscale the temperatures values recorded by MODIS For Bucharest, an important role for air temperature values in urban environments proved to have the local environmental conditions that leads to differences in air temperature at Bucharest city scale between 3-5 Â°C (both in the summer and in the winter). The UHI maps shows a good correlation with the presence of green areas. Differences in air temperature between higher tree density areas and isolated trees can reach much higher values, averages over 24 h periods still are in the 3-5 Â°C range The results have been obtained within the project UCLIMESA (Urban Heat Island Monitoring under Present and Future Climate), ongoing between 2013 and 2015 in the framework of the Programme for Research-DevelopmentInnovation for Space Technology and Advanced Research (STAR), administrated by the Romanian Space Agency Keywords: time series, urban heat island\n\nEpidemiological aspects of genital warts in romania - a 2012 retrospective survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalavastru, Carmen Maria; Niculescu, Mihaela Cristina; Zota, Alexandra; Nicola, Gheorghe; Morariu, Horia Silviu; Solovan, Caius; Patrascu, Virgil; Popovici, Georgeta; Vladuta, Raluca; Panduru, Mihaela; Tiplica, George-Sorin\n\n2014-06-01\n\nGenital infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has become one of the most frequently viral sexually transmitted diseases. The infection may remain asymptomatic, may take the form of external genital warts and may give raise to cervical cancers. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of the patients with genital warts addressing to five tertiary referral dermato-venereological units in Romania (where patients from several counties are referred) and to compare the results with the out-patient data reported by all Romanian hospitals. Data regarding patients with external genital warts who addressed to the hospital emergency rooms, in five tertiary referral dermato-venerological units in Romania (Bucharest, Timisoara, Craiova, Constanta, TÃ¢rgu-Mures) were collected for the year 2012. For comparison there have been used data collected by the National School of Public Health, Management and Professional Development, during the same year. Data reported at national level in 2012 included 952 patients (731 women and 221 men) with 26 males under 20 years of age and 251 female patients in the age group 0-20 years. In the overall population (males and females combined) the total number of genital warts cases registered at the hospital emergency rooms in the five centers, in the year 2012, was 266 patients (119 men and 147 women) with 4 girls under 14 years of age and 6 male patients in the age group 0-14 years. The high prevalence of the infection with HPV, the costs of treatment and the psychological impact prove that prevention of the disease is the most important step for decreasing the incidence of this disease. General measures for patients awareness regarding the disease and its complications need to be completed with the recommendation for vaccination. A closer monitoring of patients would provide information for a strategic national approach leading to a better outcome.\n\nThe contribution of waste management to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with applications in the city of Bucharest.\n\nPubMed\n\nSandulescu, Elena\n\n2004-12-01\n\nWaste management is a key process to protect the environment and conserve resources.
