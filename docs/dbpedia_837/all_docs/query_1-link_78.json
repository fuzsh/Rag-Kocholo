This document summarizes the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's first assessment of transboundary rivers, lakes, and groundwaters in the UNECE region. The assessment examines the conditions of transboundary water bodies and trends in their ecological and chemical status. It also evaluates the effectiveness of measures taken to prevent, control, and reduce transboundary water pollution. The assessment is intended to identify priority needs and guide decision-making around the management of shared water resources, particularly in countries with economies in transition.",
