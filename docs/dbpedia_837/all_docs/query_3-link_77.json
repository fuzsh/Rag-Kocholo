Guide Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of Physical Geography presents a comprehensive survey of the physical geography of 192 countries of the world plus Taiwan, Antarctica, and Puerto Rico.\n\nEach entry begins with a list of key facts about the physical characteristics of the country; measurements are provided in both metric and English units. Student researchers should be reminded that geography is an imprecise science, and measurements of geographical features may vary from source to source.\n\ne entries are arranged alphabetically by country in five volumes. Following the format of other popular titles in the Junior Worldmark series, information in each entry is presented in a consistent format, allowing student researchers to find information and compare countries quickly and easily.\n\nKey Facts  Official name e countries of the world are referred to by a common name; the more formal official name is listed here.\n\nA topographic map—with notable mountain ranges and peaks, lakes, rivers, deserts, and coastal areas labeled—accompanies each entry. In addition, more than 200 photographs illustrate the varied landscapes found in the countries of the world. Adding further interest are the “Did You Know?” boxes appearing in the entries, noting interesting or unusual geographic features or facts or explaining regional geographic references.\n\n Area e country’s area, usually including islands, is provided in square kilometers and square miles.  Highest point on mainland e height, in meters and feet, is given for the highest point on the mainland portion of the country. For most countries, this is also the highest point anywhere in the country.\n\nOrganization Each volume begins with the contents listed for that volume, followed by a cumulative table of contents for all five volumes in the set. To help researchers who wish to identify a country within one of the world’s continents, a finder table—Countries of the World by Continent—appears at the front of each volume. Words to Know, a glossary of terms related to geography, completes the front matter. Entries for individual countries follow. Although all numbered rubrics are included in every entry, entries vary in length depending primarily on the geographic complexity of the country’s land area.\n\n Highest point in territory For some countries with islands and territories, the highest point not on the mainland is provided in meters and feet.  Lowest point on land e elevation, in meters and feet, for the lowest point on the mainland portion of the country is provided.\n\nx\n\nREADER’S GUIDE  Hemispheres The country’s hemispheres (Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western) help the researcher locate the country on the globe.  Time zone e time zone of the country’s capital is provided, with the time related to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). For some large countries, more than one time zone may be listed.\n\n Longest distances Measurements in kilometers and miles of the country’s widest points from north to south and east to west are given. For some countries, longest distances may be measured on a slight diagonal (northwest to southeast, for example).  Land boundaries e total distance making up the country’s borders with other nations is provided in kilometers and miles, followed by the border distances with the individual neighboring countries.  Coastline Coastline measurements, in kilometers and miles, are approximate.

The eastern coast of Somalia directly faces the Indian Ocean.\n\nSea Inlets and Straits ere are no major inlets on Somalia’s coastline.\n\nIslands and Archipelagos e Bajuni is a 125-kilometer- (77-mile-) long coral reef chain of several small islands and many islets or rocks. It includes Coiama (Somalia’s largest island, covering 6 square kilometers/2.5 square miles), Ngumi, the Ciovai pair, Ciula (inhabited), Daracas, and Ciandra. Most of the islands are barren and without permanent settlement.\n\nCoastal Features Somalia has the second-longest coastline in Africa (only South Africa’s is longer.) e northern coast, along the Gulf of Aden, begins on the west at the border of Djibouti. Sandy beaches are interspersed with rocky cliffs, and the north coast has no reefs. Ras Caseyr (Cape Guardafui) is a rugged headland where the north and east coasts meet. Due south of the Cape, the Point Xaafuun (Ras Hafun) promontory juts out. From there, the Indian Ocean coast runs south in a succession of sandy beaches with little indentation. Along the southern stretch, from Mogadishu to the Kenya border, coral reefs form a barrier to the shore, which lacks natural harbors.\n\nAP Photo/Jean-Marc Bouju\n\nSomali men scoop mud to clear an irrigation canal that will bring badly needed water to their farms in Jiddo, south of Mogadishu.\n\n6  INLAND LAKES Somalia does not have any permanent lakes. In the Haud, some basins are filled by rains and intermittent floodwater, creating temporary ponds. Somalia also has artificial ponds designed to capture precious seasonal waters for irrigation and drinking. Wells and springs are of great importance to Somalia’s water supply.\n\n7  RIVERS AND WATERFALLS Somalia’s two permanently flowing rivers, the Jubba (Gestro) and Shabeelle, are used for irrigation but are not navigable by large boats. e Jubba and Shabeelle Rivers both have their sources in Ethiopia and run south through Somalia towards the Indian Ocean. e Jubba River is approximately 1,610\n\nJunior Worldmark Encyclopedia of Physical Geography\n\n11\n\nSOMALIA kilometers (1,000 miles) long. e Shabeelle River, the country’s longest river, has a total length of 2,011 kilometers (1,250 miles), of which only 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) run through Somalia. e Jubba River empties directly into the Indian Ocean in southern Somalia. To its north, the Shabeelle River flows towards the coast, then turns southeast following the coast, dwindling to its end in marshlands and sand flats. In times of heavy rain, the Shabeelle waters can meet those of the Jubba. e area between the two rivers is Somalia’s most fertile region. e Jubba/Shabeelle river system and the seasonal watercourses found in badly eroded, deforested, and desert terrain are highly vulnerable to sporadic flooding. e wetlands of Somalia surround the outlet of the Jubba River and the lower reaches of the Shabeelle River, where swamp basins are the habitat of birds and reptiles. Some mangrove forests are still found in Somalia, especially along the Jubba outlet, but most have been destroyed by cutting for fuel and fodder. e two largest watercourses in northern Somalia are the seasonal Daror and Nugaaleed stream systems. Both are usually dry.\n\n8  DESERTS About 25 percent of Somalia is desert, usually consisting of sand or gravel mixed with some vegetation. e deserts run along most of Somalia’s northern and central coasts and extend into the interior. Desertification is steadily claiming grassland and wooded areas across Somalia. On the Gulf of Aden coast, the Guban Desert is a hot, dry plain with a system of sandy seasonal watercourses. e arid Hobyo region extends north from Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, along the Indian Ocean coast. It is a desert with low vegetation that is a habitat\n\n12\n\nfor birds, reptiles, and antelopes. Over-grazing of the grasses that anchored the dunes in place has destabilized areas of sand dunes along the Indian Ocean coast.\n\n9  FLAT AND ROLLING TERRAIN Up to 70 percent of Somalia is a scrubland ecosystem of coarse grass-patches and shrubs. is terrain is especially pervasive in the Haud Plateau region of the north and throughout the south. e scrub vegetation receives minimal rain, but it is resilient. Where there is water, as in the area between the Jubba and Shabelle Rivers, good pastureland results. Nomadic Somalis pasture their herds of camels, cattle, goats, and sheep on the scrub grasslands. Much of Somalia’s grassland is being lost to desertification as a result of overgrazing and the cutting of fodder grass for export to neighboring countries. Somalia has only 1 percent of its forest cover remaining, mainly located in the far south. Trees are cut for fuel, fodder, and livestock shelters, and there is very little reforestation. e southern forest includes eucalyptus, tall cactus, and mahogany. Trees that provide myrrh and frankincense are also native to Somalia. e north has some acacia scrub and savannah forest. In the northern region called the Ogo, limestone hills at elevations of 900 to 1,200 meters (2,953 to 3,937 feet) distinguish a rough terrain dissected with dried-up streambeds. The hills are covered with scrub vegetation, which provides grazing for livestock and antelopes.\n\n10  MOUNTAINS AND VOLCANOES Somalia’s only mountains, the Migiurtinia and Ogo ranges, are in the north, extending from Ethiopia and following the Gulf of Aden coast with a high escarpment until the cliffs form the tip of the Horn of Africa.\n\nJunior Worldmark Encyclopedia of Physical Geography\n\nSOMALIA\n\nAP Photo/John Moore\n\nA cart is guided along a road in rural Somalia.\n\nSomalia’s highest peak, Mount Shimbiris, rises 2,416 meters (7,927 feet) at the center of the northern range.\n\n13  MAN-MADE FEATURES ere are no major man-made structures affecting the geography of Somalia.\n\n11\n\n14\n\n CANYONS AND CAVES\n\n FURTHER READING\n\nThroughout Somalia, soil erosion has caused gullies and canyons to appear. A lack of roads has led to trucks being driven across pastures, eroding gullies in the dry soil. Seasonal watercourses also carve deep ravines into the landscape.\n\nBooks\n\n12\n\nHassig, Susan M.

It covers 1,219,912 square kilometers (471,011 square miles), or nearly twice as much area as the state of Texas. 2\n\ntemperature range is 11°C to 22°C (52°F to 72°F) in Durban, 4°C to 17°C (39°F to 63°F) in Johannesburg, and 7°C to 17°C (45°F to 63°F) in Cape Town. Nearly all of South Africa enjoys a mild, temperate climate. Except for the extreme southwest, most of the country is under the influence of the easterly trade winds that originate over the Indian Ocean, bringing about 89 centimeters (35 inches) of yearly precipitation to the Eastern Lowveld and the Eastern Uplands as far west as the Drakensberg. The Highveld receives from 38 to 76 centimeters (15 to 30 inches) of precipitation each year. On the western coast, annual rainfall is often as low as 5 centimeters (2 inches). The rainfall deposited by the trade winds occurs mainly between October and April. In the drier regions of the plateau, the amount of rainfall and the beginning of the rainy season vary greatly from year to year. The extreme southwest receives about\n\n TERRITORIES AND DEPENDENCIES\n\nSouth Africa has no territories or dependencies. 3\n\n CLIMATE\n\nThe climate of South Africa ranges from Mediterranean-like in the southwest to temperate in the interior plateau, to subtropical in the northeast. Snow is rare, although winter frosts do occur in the higher areas of the plateau. Average January temperatures in Durban fall between 21°C and 27°C (69°F and 81°F); in Johannesburg, between 14°C and 26°C (58°F and 78°F); and in Cape Town, they range from 16°C to 26°C (60°F to 78°F).

Collectively, these edges are known as the Great Escarpment. Inland from the crest of the Great Escarpment the country consists generally of rolling plains that gradually descend to an altitude of about 900 meters (2,952 feet) in the center.\n\n25°E\n\n30°E\n\n5  OCEANS AND SEAS e Indian Ocean borders South Africa on the east; the Atlantic Ocean borders it on the west; and both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans border it on the south. Off South Africa’s eastern coast, the Indian Ocean ranges from 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); off the western coast, the Atlantic Ocean ranges from 9°C to 14°C (48°F to 57°F). Off the southern shore, the combined seas range from 16°C to 21°C (61°F to 70°F).\n\nSeacoast and Undersea Features ere are coral reefs off the eastern coast surrounding Sodwana Bay that attract divers from all over the world.
