        "text": "Cuejdel Lake is the largest aquatorium among the Romanian natural dam lakes and one of the top 5 largest natural dam lakes in the Romanian Carpathians (surface – 13.88ha, max. depth – 14.9m, total volume – 815,986m 3 in 2013). The lake was generated by a large landslide that dammed the Cuejdel brook (in Ștânișoarei Mountains, Eastern Carpathians) during the summer of 1991. Cuejdel Lake was officially designated a national natural reserve by the Governmental Decision 2151/2004 regarding the creation of new protected areas and the conservation of natural flora and fauna habitats. Since 2011, our team has monitored the lake and studied the evolution of this limnosystem at the level of the lacustrine depression and its reception basin. Our research results indicated that, after 20 years of evolution and negative changes in the value of its morpho-bathymetric parameters (surface – 2.37ha, max. depth – 2.3m, total volume – 26.77⋅10 4 m 3 ), the lake is now in a relative hydrodynamic equil...\n\nCuejdi river watershed (area: 97.41 km 2 ; max. altitude: 1213 m; min. altitude: 306; lenght: 29.11 km) left tributary of Bistrița river, drains the south-eastern part of the Central Group of Stânișoarei mountains, from the Central Group of Eastern Carpathians, Romania. The geographical position indicates a specific geological feature individualized by a very high morpho-dynamic induced by the presence of external flisch deposits. This fact was the premise of early Quaternary landslides triggering, and so far, the landslide bodies leading to the emergence of several natural dam lakes. Three of them are the subject of the present study: lake Cuejdel, which is the largest natural dam lake in Romania, at this moment (area: 13.95 ha, maximum depth 16.45 m), lake Cuejdel II (area: 0.5 ha, maximum depth 4.5 m) and lake Bolătău-Ponoarele, the oldest within the basin. So far, their investigation has been hampered by reduced accessibility and high forestation degree. Starting from 2011 until...\n\nMorpho-bathymetric parameters of recess Crucii Lake (Stânisoarei Mountains). Crucii Lake from Stânisoarei Mountains was formed in 1978 as a result of riverbed dam Cuejdel after a landslide triggered on the western slope of Muncelul Peak. The event led initially to a small accumulation of 250-300 acvatoriu m, 25-30 m wide and 4-5 m maximum depth. In the summer of 1991 following the construction of a forest road in the flysch, and amid a high humid conditions, the slide was reactivated, leading to the formation of the largest natural dam lake in Romania. It has a length of 1 km, area of 12.2 ha, maximum depth of 16 m and a water volume of ca. 907.000 m. Morphometric and morphobathymetric measurements performed in the summer of 2011, with the help of the integrated 1.200 GPS of Station Leica System 1.200 surveying measurements and bathymetric measurements Valeyport Ecosounder Midas showed new values for the morpho-bathymetric parameters. Among them stands out: 13,95 ha area, perimeter ...\n\nStanca-Costesti Reservoir holds the largest amount of water among reservoirs located in Romania and has multiple purposes, such as flood mitigation, hydropower production, irrigation etc. Our bathymetric survey was conducted along longitudinal, as well as transverse alignments, so as to cover the entire lacustrine surface by using an echo-sounder. Data from three different surveys were employed, i.e. topographical (dating back to 1977, before the onset of flooding) and bathymetrical (1986 and 2000) surveys. The drainage basin of this reservoir extends across three countries, Romania, Ukraine and Republic of Moldova, and whereas the mountain sector of the basin is mostly covered by forest, the lowland (the Moldavian Plateau) is used for agriculture, i.e., cereal crops. Thus, deforestation and inappropriate tillage techniques employed within this basin result in increased soil erosion. Most of the sediment load is carried during flood events, which have grown increasingly common, particularly in summer. The terraces formed along the downstream sector of the reservoir are not covered by alluvium, whereas the corresponding terraces from its upper sector have been covered by submerged glacises. Moreover, in the area of Ciugur river mouth we observed a submerged valley, as well as several submerged natural levees. The deepest area of the reservoir (29.2 m) is located adjacent to the dam and is thought to be the outcome of a circular current generated by the lake bottom morphology. The silting degree is rather high, ranging up to an index value of 7.3% over 33 years.\n\nUsing hydraulic modeling techniques (e.g., one-dimensional/two-dimensional (1D/2D) hydraulic modeling, dam break scenarios) for extracting the flood settings is an important aspect of any action plan for dam failure (APDF) and flood mitigation strategy. For example, the flood hydraulic models and dam break scenario generated based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) and processed in the dedicated geographic information systems (GIS) and hydraulic modeling software (e.g., HEC-RAS—Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System, developed by USACE HEC, Davis, CA, USA) can improve the flood hazard maps in case of potentially embankment dam failure. In this study, we develop a small-scale conceptual approach using 2D HEC-RAS software according to the three embankment dam break scenarios, LiDAR data (0.5 m spatial resolution), and 2D hydraulic modeling for the Başeu multi-reservoir system which belongs to the Başeu River (NE Romania) includi..."
