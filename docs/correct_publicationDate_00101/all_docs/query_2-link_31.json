        "text": "ã€Š4 of 4ã€‹ Particle Accelerators. This one took some digging. It's widely discussed that protons and such can't be accelerated to the speed of light because their mass increases and it would take infinite energy to push them faster. That's not how accelerators work, though. And in as few words as possible, the particles are pushed along as if they are surfing on a wave. And it's not like a rack and pinion where the motion has no unidirection slip. In particle accelerators there is slip between the particles and wave and its respective frequency. (Here's a short video) https://lnkd.in/eazFTeZj So...it's not because mass is increasing...though momentum certainly is. And truly...in that closed system, c is the speed limit. But in an open system...there is no momentum...and there is no speed limit. #Particleaccelarators #particlephysics #relativity #Specialrelativity ##timedilation\n\nã€Š3 of 4ã€‹ \"Relativistic Mass increases as an object approaches the speed of light.\" I totally agree with this. The key word, however, is relativistic mass. This idea gets conflated to bring about a supposed limit to how fast an object can travel because it would take infinite energy to accelerate it to the speed of light. Relativistic mass is momentum. A bullet has momentum in relation to a hay bale. Two bullets flying parallel to each have no momentum relative to each other. Two bullets at .9c flying next to each other have exactly the same mass as they would at any other velocity regardless of how they achieved that velocity. If this were not true, their physics would change as they approached c. This does not happen. So keep in mind the difference between relativistic mass and physical mass. The universe itself has no idea how fast you're traveling. You can accelerate at 1g as long as you'd like...because the physics does not change as you go faster. (Faster than what?) Particle accelerators have speed limits for a different reason...and it has nothing to do with mass increasing. #Relativity #Specialrelativity #timedilation #physics\n\nã€Š1 of 4ã€‹Time dilation. It's (nearly) universally agreed that there is no absolute speed in space. Similarly, there is no absolute rest. The thought experiment is very simple compared to all the \"observer A, B,C\" and synchronized stopwatches. In the void of space, how does any object share any information about what it's doing or where it's been with any other object? Say, for instance you have a ship in a sun-synchronous orbit. It can stare at the Earth...and never see beyond it. On the opposite side of the Earth is another ship that takes a near-lightspeed trip out to Pluto and back. Then the two ships team back up in orbit around Earth. How does either ship have any idea what ther other was doing? The relativeness of their \"relative\" motion cannot be communicated. And since there is no concept of absolute speed, who is to say what was going on during the one rocket's trip out to Pluto? #Relativity #Specialrelativity #physics ##timedilation\n\nã€Š2 of 4ã€‹ How would the physics of a object at relativistic speeds remain constant if it's length is contracted in its direction of travel? 1.The cg of the object would shift. Density would change. (Picture an aircraft carrier with zero lenght...not a baseball.) 2. Electrical and thermal properties would become asymmetrical. 3. Chemical reactions would change with the asymmetry. Length contraction can only be a mathematical idea disconnected from reality. #Specialrelativity #Physics #relativity #timedilation\n\n\"It's midnight here. And I'm tpying this with one eye squinted shut while I should be sleeping. Forgive me if you answer this in your papers... But... Is there an absolute speed in space? How does one object alone in space recieve any information about the velocity of another object in space for there to be any time dilation? And... Is it possible that velocity-based time dilation is only applicable within a sizable gravitational field? These are the questions that keep me up at night. Thanks!\" (From a reply of mine to someone else's post recently) #Specialrelativity #physics #timedilation #relativity #insomnia Thad Roberts ðŸ¤”?"
