        "text": "The world is currently witnessing a real space race: this year Space X is planning the first private astronaut spacewalk, next year NASA will send a man to the moon again, and experts predict that the first landing on Mars will take place in the next decade.\n\nRobert Zubrin, an American aerospace engineer, writer, and founder of the Martian Society, tells RBC-Ukraine about the biggest space discoveries that await humanity in the next half-century.\n\nBiggest space discoveries awaiting humanity in next 50 years\n\n\"There will be the first human landing on Mars, the birth of the first child on Mars, the discovery of extraterrestrial life, the discovery of extraterrestrial civilizations, and the demonstration of fusion rockets,\" the engineer says.\n\nHe adds that the first human landing on Mars could happen in the next decade if Elon Musk focuses on Space X again. And our generation will witness the first bases on the Moon.\n\n\"We will see the creation of bases on the Moon. But the Moon lacks materials for settlement. There is very little water, no carbon, no nitrogen. Mars has all this and much more, so it is more suitable for settlement,\" Zubrin adds.\n\nRobert Zubrin (photo: facebook.com/robert.zubrin.1)\n\nZubrin is one of the popularizers of Mars colonization. Members of his Martian Society around the world promote his ideas and create developments that can bring humanity closer to the conquest of other planets.\n\nInterestingly, Zubrin is the ideological inspiration for Elon Musk. In the 2000s, it was the engineer who pushed the businessman to invest in the space industry.\n\nThe aerospace engineer also emphasizes that China and India, which have been actively developing their technologies in recent years, could overtake the United States in the space race. If Ukraine wins, it could also become a space leader.\n\nTests conducted by members of the Martian Society at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah (photo: facebook.com/robert.zubrin.1)\n\nTests conducted by members of the Martian Society at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah (photo: facebook.com/robert.zubrin.1)\n\nTests conducted by members of the Martian Society at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah (photo: facebook.com/robert.zubrin.1)"
