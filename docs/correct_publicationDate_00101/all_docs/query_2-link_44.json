        "text": "“We are the watchmen on the walls of world freedom.” That’s from the speech JFK was to give in Dallas, before he was shot down by an ex marine who had defected to Russia. Harris is running against a con man and an ex marine who both want us to desert the walls of world freedom. That’s the only issue that matters in this campaign. Will we defend world freedom or not?\n\nI sent this message to my congresswoman today. I urge everyone represented by a Democrat to send a similar message to their representative or Senator. Congresswoman Pettersen needs to call on Biden to withdraw and release his delegates. Biden is not only losing every swing state, he does worse than the Dem nominee for Senate in every swing state by at least 10 points. In non swing states, it is even worse. In Ohio he trails Sherod Brown by 15 points. In Montana he trails Tester by 22 points. If you keep Biden, you are setting up a GOP landslide, and installing a man in the White House who says he is above the law, and who fully intends to betray the western alliance. But if Biden frees his delegates, the Dems can have an open convention. The competition for the nomination will steal the limelight from Trump, and light up the nation - which has been in despair over the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch- with hope. The Dems will then sweep the election. The republic and free world will be saved. That’s the choice here. It is not a question of whether Biden “deserves” the nomination. It is a question of life or death for the republic and the whole free world. She needs to do the right thing. Now. There is no time to be lost. Robert"
