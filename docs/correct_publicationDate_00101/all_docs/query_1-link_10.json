        "text": "First Landing unearths the untold story of Reverend Robert Hunt's incredible sacrifice as expedition chaplain of the Virginia Company's awe inspiring voyage to the New World - a groundbreaking trip that would result in America's first permanent English settlement in Jamestown, Virginia.The story follows Hunt's struggle to leave his young family in order to make the arduous journey by sea in 1606. Despite being initially pinned by superstitious sailors as the cause of severe winter storms in the English Channel that were keeping the ships in a stranglehold for six weeks, a desperately seasick Hunt persuades Captain Christopher Newport to stay the course on to\n\nthe new world. With new strength, Hunt then resolves to minister to his shipmates and to persevere throughout the journey. But infighting among members of the expedition lingers, especially between the swashbuckling John Smith and the influential Edward Marie Wingfield. Smith is charged with mutiny, and Hunt becomes part of Smith's dramatic rescue from the gallows. In April 1607, the voyagers finally reach their destination. A wooden cross is raised among the sand dunes of what is today Cape Henry, and Hunt prays for God's blessing on the new colony and the people of the land.\n\nIn the midst of disease and the hostility, Hunt pours himself into caring for the settlers, giving little thought to his own needs. The sacrifice of Robert Hunt is a largely unknown story, coming to light 400 years later. His role in enabling the colonists to not only reach the shores of North America but to also survive those early brutal years cannot be underestimated. While most men looked to their own needs, Hunt brought much needed unity to the frail outpost on the James River that would in time become the United States of America, one nation under God with liberty and justice for all.\n\n\"This film is a forgotten story that needs to be told. Because God has been taken out of schools so much that we need to bring back the true foundation of this country and its beliefs.\"\n\n\"This movie shows me that God has had his hand on this country from the beginning.\"\n\n\"First Landing shows that the men that came over here were dedicated to share the gospel to the ends of the earth.\"\n\n\"First Landing is inspiring, very encouraging and it's a blessing!\""
