        "text": "February 20, 2012\n\nI saw an interview where Alan Moore called Zubrin basically some kind of nut, probably because Newt Gingritch said something nice about him. I thought to myself, \" self, if Alan Moore thinks this guy is nuts, you have got to get this book.\" after reading the book, I have to say Zubrin is not at all crazy, he was disappointingly sane in fact. He is certainly a glass half full guy, a bit pollyanna-ish, but sane just the same. His theories are very well thought out but thourougly optimistic. I just wish we had the stones to give some of it a try. I truly don't believe we will anytime soon and that is to our detriment. This was a pretty good read. Recommended for those who have an interest in near future space exploration.\n\nNovember 27, 2021\n\nCarefully researched, masterfully written, passionate and clearly on our (human) side. The only reason it's 4 stars rather than 5 is the omission of the topic of (IMHO) overarching importance: mechanics of human decision-making. Selling the idea of spacefaring civilization to the humans who will end up either paying for creating it (and sharing in the benefits of doing so if it works), - or refusing to.\n\nApril 27, 2009\n\nThis is the future of human civilization; and it is astounding.\n\nZubrin blew my mind a number of times, and in later chapters it appears that Zubrin is blowing his own mind, based on the prevalence of conclusions he makes accentuated with exclamation marks in ellipses (!!!). All of which are warranted, as Zubrin is clearly the most visionary, optimistic, and forward thinking aeronautical engineer around. Having read his previous book 'The Case For Mars', I was expecting optimism and brilliance, and this more than delivered. (Also, I plan on going to this year's Space Development Conference in Florida, where Zubrin will speak).\n\nThe book begins with the current state of space exploration: capabilities, missions, goals, technologies, etc., It then begins to discuss the near future, including missions to mars, returning to the moon, and then progressing along a logical path into the future of space exploration. I recommend this book to all who are interested in knowing what their children, grandchildren and more distant offspring will be doing in the centuries to come.\n\nSeptember 8, 2007\n\nExtremely informative and very inspirational.\n\nAfter I read it I was like if I had a choice to make the world better, it would be along the lines of what was proposed in the book. Forward the human civilization into space.\n\nAugust 15, 2018\n\nEntering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization (2000) by Robert Zubrin is a remarkable book the gives a remarkable view of how humanity can actually go into space. Both in the solar system and outside it.\n\nRobert Zubrin has a masters in Aeronautics and a PhD in nuclear engineering and has worked as an aeronautical engineer so he has the ideal training to speculate seriously about what is possible in space flight in the next few decades and beyond. He has proposed numerous plausible propulsion systems for exploring space.\n\nThe book is broken up into the Kardashev system for classifying civilizations, as Type 1 or world spanning, type 2 or solar system spanning and type 3 or galactic civilization.\n\nThe world spanning looks at what more can be done in orbit. The solar system spanning as looking at how and why mars and other worlds can be colonized and the type 3 part looking at how with really plausibly technology the galaxy could be explored.\n\nThe solar system sections covers similar ground to Zubrin's book on why and how Mars should be colonized and extends it to how the asteroids and other worlds could be used. He also addresses the ideas of Gerard K O'Neil in The High Frontier and also Mining the Sky by John Lewis. The details and ideas presented are remarkable.\n\nThe section on how the galaxy could be colonised is also fascinating. Zubrin looks at various propulsion systems including Project Orion style nuclear explosive drives and various fusion propulsion systems that have been seriously proposed. It is very optimistic, but it is remarkably all physically plausible.\n\nEntering Space is the best single book I've read on how serious space exploration and colonisation could be attempted. It's a really inspiring book for anyone interested in humanities possible ventures in space.\n\nOctober 2, 2022\n\nThis book was written twenty years ago, so it’s a little bit out of date. But only in the sense that all the change since it was written makes it more compelling.\n\nThe boom begins by motivating humanity’s need, individually and collectively, to expand and settle other planets. Then it describes how we could do this. Necessarily high level, the analysis is nonetheless insightful and grounded. Finally it spans to the far future and considers how we might actually travel to other stars and what this means for life, the universe and the Fermi paradox.\n\nThere aren’t many books they change the way I think and what I care about but this one does.\n\nApril 12, 2021\n\nI really didn’t like this book. Zubrin came off as a mansplainer at a party who corners you and starts telling you about his genius business idea. Except you’re not at a party, you spent money on his book. And instead of an business plan, it’s his plan for space travel. Also I found some parts to be irrelevant just since it’s an older book in a field that’s quickly growing.\n\nSeptember 24, 2015\n\nGood book on what a spacefaring civilisation might look like, and a potential realistic pathway to achieving it.\n\nResource gathering throughout the solar system could have been more in depth, about the size of economies required to sustain them.\n\nDiscussion of potential aliens in the galaxy was informative but a little narrow minded / opinionated:\n\n- drake equation discussion concluded there must be many aliens in our galaxy, discounted the possibility of it being rare (<1 civilisation per galaxy)\n\n- made the assumption that civilisations not growing must stagnate (that's a human observation, not necessarily a universal truth).\n\n- assumption that all civilisations even ones in growth must collapse\n\nOverall quite interesting and covered a wide range of technology and topics\n\nMarch 3, 2017\n\nInspired me to my mechanical/aerospace major, Zubrin sets a game plan for the development of humanity through each stage of \"energy\" existence- from planetary, to solar, to galactic- without relying on magical warp drives, but rather conventional high school physics and chemistry that we can all understand.\n\nIt explains how things should work without being like those bothersome, \"Science of StarTrek/HarryPotter/XMen\" books.\n\nNovember 4, 2013\n\nI have never read a science or engineering book of such sweeping vision. Not only does it give insight about the next steps for the culture and technology of this planet, but it is an intelligent discussion of what's going on in the rest of the galaxy and the universe. This is better than The Starflight Handbook or Prospects for Interstellar Travel. Highly, highly recommended\n\nNovember 30, 2008\n\nZubrin made the case for Mars. This is his ultimate manifesto for mankind conquering space. He manages to slay a number of dragons in this work and points out a number of potential \"goldmine\" industries that could emerge as humanity enters space.\n\nJanuary 20, 2009\n\nThis is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's a little dated in parts (published 2000), but still a gem. Zubrin's writing is both insprirational and informative. He argued a better case for the space program than any author I've ever read.\n\nJuly 13, 2012\n\nZubrin offers his take on the various reasons for going into space, and shows that many of the often-cited ones are economically unfeasible. If you are interested in space, check this book out for sure.\n\nFebruary 4, 2016\n\nEssential reading for anyone who wants to see the ideological necessity and practical feasibility of space colonization. An exciting and compelling narrative on the immediacy with which we can embrace the human destiny of interstellar travel.\n\nJuly 10, 2018\n\nReally excellent compilation of ideas for making us a space faring species. Not for people who like sports or Kim Kardasian. I thought it was super awesome and will refer back to it in the future(pun intented)\n\nJuly 17, 2008\n\nI really enjoyed this book. He discusses seemingly doable and necessary plans for us to become a space-faring civilization. Really fascinating.\n\nFebruary 11, 2010\n\nCould read this over and over - always something more to absorb\n\nMarch 9, 2012\n\nAn inspiring, relatively technical read. Highly recommended.\n\nJune 13, 2012\n\nAbsolutely fantastic!! I would recommend this to all Sci-fi readers!\n\nMarch 24, 2016\n\nThis was a great book filled with good science and facts relating to expanding humanity into space."
