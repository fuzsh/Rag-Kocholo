Remainder mark.\n\nCover art: NASA\n\nBlurb: “One of the most provocative and hopeful documents\n\nI have read about the space program in 20 years.\"\n\n-DENNIS OVERBYE,\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW\n\nRobert Zubrin crafted the daring blueprint for humanity's reach to the Red Planet twenty-five years ago when he first published The Case for Mars. Now, in an era when the American space program and private companies like SpaceX are racing to send astronauts there before the decade is out, he looks to the future once more. In the grand tradition of successful explorers, Zubrin calls for a travel-light and live-off-the-land approach to Martian settlement.\n\nHe explains how scientists can use present-day technology to send humans to Mars, produce fuel and oxygen on the planet's surface with its own natural resources, build bases and communities, and, one day, terraform-or alter the atmosphere of the planet in order to pave the way for sustainable life. As the day humans step foot on the Red Planet draws ever nearer, Zubrin lays out a comprehensive plan to build life on a new world.\n\n\"This book shows how a flight to Mars has progressed from fantasy to ... reality.\"\n\n-Buzz ALDRIN\n\n\"Bob Zubrin really, nearly alone, changed our thinking on this issue.\"\n\n-CARL SAGAN\n\nROBERT ZUBRIN is president of Pioneer Astronautics, an aerospace R&D company, and the founder and president of the Mars Society, an international organization dedicated to furthering the exploration and settlement of Mars by both public and private means. He lives with his wife, Hope, a science teacher, in Golden, Colorado."
