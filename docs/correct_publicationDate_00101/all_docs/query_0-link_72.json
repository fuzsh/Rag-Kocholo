And it provides scientific refutations to antihumanism’s major pseudo-scientific claims, including its modern tirades against nuclear power, pesticides, population growth, biotech foods, resource depletion, industrial development, and, most recently, fear-mongering about global warming. The book’s official homepage is: www.MerchantsOfDespair.com.\n\nLocation: Marriott Pyramid 5151 San Francisco Rd NE, Albuquerque, NM 87109\n\nWhen: Wednesday, March 16, 2016, 12:00 noon to 1:00pm.\n\nCost: Seating is limited and can be purchased at the discounted price of $30 through Wednesday, March 9, 2016; $40 thereafter.\n\nIn addition to his writing on the environment and public policy, Zubrin is the author of the critically acclaimed nonfiction books The Case for Mars, Entering Space, and Mars on Earth; the science fiction novels The Holy Land and First Landing; and articles in Scientific American, The New Atlantis,American Enterprise, the New York Times, and the Washington Post. He has appeared on major media including CNN, C-SPAN, the BBC, the Discovery Channel, the Science Channel, NBC, ABC, and NPR.\n\nRobert Zubrin is a New Atlantis contributing editor and a fellow at the Center for Security Policy. For many years, he worked as a senior engineer for Lockheed Martin."
