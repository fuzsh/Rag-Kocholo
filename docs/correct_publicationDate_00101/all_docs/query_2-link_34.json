        "text": "The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must\n\nBy Robert Zubrin, Richard Wagner,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nIf there's a roadmap to Mars, it is Robert Zubrin's classic The Case for Mars. An aerospace engineer by training, Zubrin describes with exceeding clarity every detail needed to set up a rudimentary camp on Mars with the long-term goal of human migration and Martian terraforming. Zubrin's plans include a novel rocket launch approach called Mars Direct, which sends cargo in advance before the crew and establishes a cycle of launches every two years. Unlike most advocates for Mars settlements, Zubrin doesn't pretend the journey is simple. As with settlements at Jamestown and Plymouth, most migrants will die en route or shortly after. Most interesting is how NASA's plans for Mars for 2040 looks remarkably like Zubrin's Mars Direct circa 1996. Yes, we've wasted decades not even starting.\n\nBy Robert Zubrin, Richard Wagner,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked The Case for Mars as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Case for Marsmakes living in space seem more possible than ever in this updated 25th anniversary edition, featuring the latest information on the planet's exploration and the drive to send humans there.\n\nSince the beginning of human history, Mars has been an alluring dream—the stuff of legends, gods, and mystery. The planet most like ours, it had long been thought impossible to reach, let alone explore and inhabit. But that is changing fast.\n\nIn February 2021, the American rover Perseverance will touch down on Mars. Equipped with a powerful suite of scientific instruments—including some that will attempt to make…\n\nPreview\n\nVacation Guide to the Solar System: Science for the Savvy Space Traveler!\n\nBy Olivia Koski, Jana Grcevich,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nWhimsical but devilishly accurate, authors Olivia Koski and Jana Grcevich take you on a journey through the solar system as told from the perspective of an overzealous travel agent. Ski Mercury's volcanic sands; paraglide through Venus' clouds; explore Europa's deep-sea oceans. Vacation Guide to the Solar System is the \"official\" guide from the Intergalactic Travel Bureau. Although the book is written tongue-in-cheek, filled with campy illustrations reminiscent of 1950s travel guides, you will learn critical details of our neighboring planets and moons. There's so much to see and do on Mars. But danger lurks: Although you'll feel only 38% of your weight climbing the cliffs of the Valles Marineris (the largest canyon in the solar system), you can still fall to your death, as they are four miles high.\n\nBy Olivia Koski, Jana Grcevich,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Vacation Guide to the Solar System as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPacked with real science and fueled by imagination, a beautifully illustrated guide to traveling in our solar system\n\nImagine taking a hike along the windswept red plains of Mars to dig for signs of life, or touring one of Jupiter's sixty-four moons where you can photograph its swirling storms. For a shorter trip on a tight budget, the Moon is quite majestic and very quiet if you can make it during the off-season.\n\nPacked with full color illustrations and real-world science, Vacation Guide to the Solar System is the must-have planning guide for the curious space adventurer, covering all of…\n\nPreview\n\nSpace Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier\n\nBy Neil Degrasse Tyson,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nDuring his speech at the World Government Summit 2018 in Dubai, Neil deGrasse Tyson confessed that his original title for the book Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier was Failure to Launch: The Dreams and Delusions of Space Enthusiasts. The publisher rejected this title. I would have purchased this book either way, but the original title is on the mark. Tyson is one of my greatest sources of inspiration because he is so clear-eyed about practical challenges in space travel: from the physical and biological to the political and philosophical. Space Chronicles is one of many fine entry points into his brilliant mind.\n\nBy Neil Degrasse Tyson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Space Chronicles as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson is a rare breed of astrophysicist, one who can speak as easily and brilliantly with popular audiences as with professional scientists. Now that NASA has put human space flight effectively on hold, Tyson's views on the future of space travel and America's role in that future are especially timely and urgent.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Martian\n\nBy Andy Weir,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nThe best science fiction comes across as science fact, and that's what author Andy Weir pulled off in the book The Martian. This is one of the few books about living on Mars, as opposed to acting out an earth-based plot in a Martian setting. Perhaps you have seen the movie starring Matt Damon. However excellent the movie is, the novel goes into far greater detail concerning the very essence of surviving on Mars with current technology and the known dangers on a planet that's cold and nearly as devoid of air pressure as space itself. Even if you saw the movie, I recommend following up with the book.\n\nBy Andy Weir,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n20 authors picked The Martian as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSix days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he's alive--and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old human error are…\n\nPreview\n\nRed Mars\n\nBy Kim Stanley Robinson,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nOnce again, science fiction meets science fact in the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, a thoughtful exploration for colonizing Mars. The first novel, Red Mars, gets us there. The second, Green Mars, is a battle for the soul of Mars, with fractions who desire to keep Mars natural pitted against others who desire to make it more earthlike. All the while there's a revolution unfolding between Mars and Earth à la the American Revolution. (Partial spoiler alert: the third novel, Blue Mars, hints at who won.) Should humans ever migrate to Mars, there is little doubt that they will have different opinions about self-rule. Martian migration will be a grand experiment, and Kim Stanley Robinson may prove himself to be prescient come the year 2100.\n\nBy Kim Stanley Robinson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n11 authors picked Red Mars as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe first novel in Kim Stanley Robinson's massively successful and lavishly praised Mars trilogy. 'The ultimate in future history' Daily Mail\n\nMars - the barren, forbidding planet that epitomises mankind's dreams of space conquest.\n\nFrom the first pioneers who looked back at Earth and saw a small blue star, to the first colonists - hand-picked scientists with the skills necessary to create life from cold desert - Red Mars is the story of a new genesis.\n\nIt is also the story of how Man must struggle against his own self-destructive mechanisms to achieve his dreams: before he even sets foot…\n\nPreview\n\nYou might also like...\n\nExchange Student\n\nBy Michael R. Lane,\n\nNew book alert!\n\nSponsored by Michael R. Lane Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs an avid reader, I read a wide variety of books. Of the fiction genre mystery and suspense remain my favorite. From the classics to the gritty, a well-told mystery is a literary gem. As my mystery palette has aged—like my taste in wine—so are my demands of what makes a good mystery novel. The best mysteries for me contain more than a serpentine journey toward the hidden truth. They have intriguing characters, crisp dialogue, interesting settings, formidable foes, and of course indispensable heroes or anti-heroes. My writing goal is aimed at achieving the same level of literary penmanship of the mysteries I enjoy reading so much.\n\nMichael's book list on African American mysteries\n\nWhat is my book about?\n\nDaniel “Dan” Bluford is the Director of Polar City Single Organism Research Lab Facilities.
