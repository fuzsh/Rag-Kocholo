        "text": "On the early morning (about 4 a.m.)\n\nof Sunday, April 26, 1607, three small\n\nships carrying the first permanent\n\nsettlers of Virginia approached the\n\nshore near Cape Henry at the mouth of\n\nthe Chesapeake Bay. This Virginia\n\nCompany of London expedition had set\n\nsail from England on Dec. 26, 1606.\n\nReleased from their four month\n\nconfinement at sea, they made\n\nlandfall just west of the cape, where\n\nthe reverend Robert Hunt led the\n\ncolonists in giving thanks to god for\n\ntheir “safe” voyage.\n\nCaptain Christopher Newport, the\n\nexpedition’s commander until the first\n\ncharter’s requirements were carried\n\nout, went ashore that morning with a\n\nparty to explore this new land filled\n\nwith “freshwaters, faire meadowes,\" and\n\n“goodly tall trees”. During an\n\nafternoon encounter with indians, two\n\nof the party were wounded.\n\nThat evening the colonists opened the\n\nstrong box and read the instructions\n\ncontained in the first charter. Upon\n\ndiscovering that the members of the\n\ncouncil were named but not its\n\npresident, they held the first recorded\n\nfree election under English common\n\nlaw; the vote being duly recorded for the\n\nestablishment of “James Cittie”.\n\nA second party was to put ashore\n\nthe next day to assemble a “shallop”,\n\nwhich is a small boat. This shallop was\n\nused to explore the lower reaches of\n\nthe Chesapeake Bay and the\n\nLynnhaven River, possibly as far in-\n\nland as today’s Thalia and Wolf Snare.\n\nAccording to George Percy, younger\n\nson of the Duke of Northumberland,\n\nwho was with them, “on the nine and\n\ntwentieth day we returned to the\n\nmouth of the Chesiopic, set up a cross\n\nand called the place Cape Henry” for\n\nHenry, Prince of Wales, elder son of\n\nking James I.\n\nApril 30 found them at a new\n\nanchorage, “Cape Comfort” and shortly\n\nthereafter they entered the James River.\n\nAfter two weeks of searching both sides\n\nof the James River for a suitable site,\n\nthey established the first permanent\n\nsettlement on May 13, 1607, naming it\n\n“James Cittie” for king James I.\n\n(information and picture provided by\n\nthe department of the interior)"
