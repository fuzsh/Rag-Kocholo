        "text": "Description\n\nThe Case For Mars Robert Zubrin with Richard Wagner\n\nThe Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must with a foreword by Arthur C. Clarke. Since the beginning of human history, Mars has been an alluring dream–the stuff of legends, gods, and mystery. The planet most like ours, it has still been thought impossible to reach, let alone explore and inhabit. But all that changed when leading space exploration authority Robert Zubrin crafted a daring new blueprint, Mars Direct. When it was first published in 1996, \"The Case for Mars \"became an instant classic, lauded widely for its game-changing perspective by those who would see the American space program rise to the challenge of Mars; Carl Sagan called Zubrin the man who, \"nearly alone, changed our thinking on this issue.\"\n\nFeatures;\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster Ltd., London; 1996\n\nRed Cloth with Black Spine Hardback, 328 pp\n\nIllustrated with diagrams and b/w photographs.\n\nSize 240 x 160mm, 850g\n\nISBN 0 684 81930 9\n\nCondition: Very Good – Very Good Unclipped Dust Jacket, No Inscriptions, Very Good Copy\n\n5 Good Reasons To BUY NOW !!!"
