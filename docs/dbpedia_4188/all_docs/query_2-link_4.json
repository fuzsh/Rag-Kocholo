        "text": "Thanks, I put in search for MJH & got fairly general discussions about labels with brief mentions of releases but no comparisons or recommendations.\n\nWell, I compared the 1928 sessions on the Sony when that one came out with the Yazoo CD and the latter thrashed it. The noise reduction and other mastering choices on the Sony killed the music.\n\nYeah the search functions are not so great even when you search titles only. You get the whole list of posts rather than just the thread you'd like to look through\n\nTwo things: I have the Yazoo and Sony versions of the 1928 sessions, and I prefer the Yazoo. The Sony has been doctored to clean it up where the Yazoo is clearer, but has a lot of surface noise (cracks and pops). It's really just personal preference as I can see why some people may prefer the Sony (Avalon Blues).\n\nThe second thing I wanted to say is regarding the search function, and this is applicable to any website. You'll get better results searching the site using Google. For example, in the Google search window type:\n\n\"Mississippi John Hurt site: stevehoffman.tv\"\n\nIt'll give you much better results. Hope that helps.\n\nWhat he said. He plays a 12 string flawlessly live for the double album concert, doing all his best songs. It's where I learned how to fingerpick (He's slightly detuned if you're intrested).\n\nThanks to all! I had Today on vinyl back in the day but it's been years.\n\nI ordered new & used, a tribute to MJH, the Vanguard 3 piece, the Yazoo, the Greatest/Live cd. I left the Library of Congress in my 'save for later', probably pick it up within the next couple of months.\n\nAgain THANKS, this is reason #28 why I love this forum!\n\nLet us know how you enjoy the albums! Because I suspect that you will love them...\n\nYes I do love them. Talk about pure, relaxing sounds, this is it. Today sounds as beautiful as it did back when.\n\nDid he insure his right thumb?\n\nAfter years and years of listening to probably all of John Hurt's recorded output, I find myself always going back to his first two albums released on Vanguard. On those two albums, his playing and singing were much more solid than when he later showed obvious signs of age and ill health, and his guitar was always in perfect tune (unlike some other releases). I will agree with others, however, that it is fascinating to hear his 1928 recordings, mostly because he was something like 35 years old. Personally, I would begin with these two albums; then the 1928 recordings.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Today-Mississ...6217290&sr=1-4&keywords=mississippi+john+hurt\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Immortal-Miss...6217382&sr=1-9&keywords=mississippi+john+hurt\n\nSo, getting these is better than getting the Library of Congress collection?"
