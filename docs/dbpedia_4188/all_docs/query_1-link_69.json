        "text": "Avalon Blues: A Tribute to the Music of Mississippi John Hurt\n\nLabel: Vanguard Records\n\nMedia: CD\n\nFormat: Album\n\nWorkNameSort: Avalon Blues: A Tribute to the Music of Mississippi John Hurt\n\nIt must be daunting to do a tribute album to Mississippi John Hurt. His intricate finger-picking style, wistful delivery and Cinderella career make him a unique character in music. Hurt recorded a few sides in the late '20s, then headed home to Mississippi, only to be rediscovered in 1963 by two blues historians and immediately idolized by a burgeoning American folk scene.\n\n\"Avalon Blues\" features some big names in the folk/alt-country scene: Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Ben Harper, Gillian Welch, John Hiatt and even Beck doing inspired covers of well-known Hurt tunes like \"Avalon,\" \"My Home Town\" and \"Candy Man.\" The arrangements are low-key and all the performances here are good. But it's Harper's graceful \"Sliding Delta\" that comes closest to capturing Hurt's gentle effervescence -- a quality that made him one of the greatest, and most grateful, blues figures in history.\n\nWE LOVE OUR READERS!\n\nSince 1990, Orlando Weekly has served as the free, independent voice of Orlando, and we want to keep it that way.\n\nBecoming an Orlando Weekly Supporter for as little as $5 a month allows us to continue offering readers access to our coverage of local news, food, nightlife, events, and culture with no paywalls.\n\nJoin today because you love us, too."
