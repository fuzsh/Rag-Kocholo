        "text": "Mississippi John Hurt (1892-1966) was one of the great early blues players from Mississippi.\n\nHe recorded 13 tracks for Okeh Records in 1928 and then faded into obscurity until two music researchers traced him to his home in Avalon, Mississippi in the early 1960s.\n\nHis re-discovery led Mississippi John Hurt to a successful new recording and performing career until his death in 1966.\n\nLast year, a friend and I visited Mississippi John Hurt’s grave in Avalon, Mississippi.\n\nThe Mississippi Blues Trail has placed a marker in Avalon, Mississippi commemorating Mississippi John Hurt.\n\nMississippi John Hurt’s grave can be difficult to find if you are unfamiliar with the area. It’s in an abandoned and overgrown cemetery obscured by trees off the side of a dirt road.\n\nMississippi John Hurt’s grave is at the back of the cemetery.\n\nWe will post more information about Mississippi John Hurt and other great Mississippi blues musicians in due time.\n\nIn the meantime, here’s a video of Mississippi John Hurt performing You Got To Walk That Lonesome Valley, circa 1963."
