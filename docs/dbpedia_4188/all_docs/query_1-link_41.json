        "text": "Recommended Recordings\n\nAs one of Our Recommendations and Recommended Recordings, we recommend Avalon Blues: The Complete 1928 Okeh Recordings, by Mississippi John Hurt.\n\nAvailable through Amazon.com and these Amazon affiliates:\n\nAmazon.ca | CD edition | Digital Download |\n\nAmazon.com | CD edition | Digital Download |\n\nThis album contains the 13 recordings Mississippi John Hurt made for Okeh Records in 1928. After making these recordings, Mississippi John Hurt disappeared from public view until the early 1960’s when two blues researchers used the song Avalon Blues, which contains the lyric “Avalon is my hometown,” to trace Mississippi John Hurt to his home in Avalon, Carroll County, Mississippi.\n\nFollowing his “re-discovery” Mississippi John Hurt saw a revival and resurgence of his performing and recording career until his death in 1967.\n\nThese 1928 Okeh Records recordings are the ones that started Mississippi John Hurt’s career. We have no hesitation in recommending this release to fellow blues fans.\n\nIf you’re in Mississippi you may want to check out these sites:\n\nMississippi John Hurt’s grave, near Avalon, Carroll County, Mississippi\n\nMississippi Blues Trail marker commemorating Mississippi John Hurt, near Avalon, Carroll County, Mississippi\n\nWould you like to leave a comment or question about anything on this page?"
