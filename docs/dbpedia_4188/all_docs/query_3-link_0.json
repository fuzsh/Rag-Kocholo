        "text": "American rapper and songwriter (born 1987)\n\nFor his self-titled EP, see Kendrick Lamar (EP).\n\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper and songwriter. Regarded as one of the most influential hip hop artists of his generation, and one of the greatest rappers of all time, he is known for his technical artistry and complex songwriting. He was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, becoming the first musician outside of the classical and jazz genres to be honored.\n\nLamar began releasing music under the stage name K.Dot while he was attending high school. He signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005, where he co-founded the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy. Following the success of his alternative rap debut album Section.80 (2011), Lamar secured a joint contract with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. He rose to prominence with his gangsta rap-influenced second album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012) and its top 40 singles \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\", \"Poetic Justice\" and \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\". It is the longest-charting hip hop studio album on the Billboard 200.\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly (2015), Lamar's third album, embraced the history of African-American music. It became his first of four consecutive number-one albums in the U.S., and was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the 2010s. Lamar's work on the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" garnered his first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100. His critical and commercial success continued with his R&B and pop-leaning fourth album Damn (2017), yielding his second chart-topping single \"Humble\". The double album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022) concluded Lamar's tenure with TDE and Aftermath. His 2024 feud with Drake spawned the number-one songs \"Like That\" and \"Not Like Us\".\n\nLamar has received various accolades throughout his career, including one Primetime Emmy Award, one Brit Award, four American Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including two Video of the Year wins), 17 Grammy Awards (the third-most won by a rapper), and 29 BET Hip Hop Awards (the most won by any artist). Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016. Two of his concert tours, the Damn Tour (2017–2018) and the Big Steppers Tour (2022–2024), are amongst the highest-grossing rap tours in history. Three of his works were included in Rolling Stone's 2020 revision of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Outside of music, Lamar co-founded the creative company PGLang and ventured into film with his creative partner, Dave Free.\n\nLife and career\n\nEarly life\n\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California.[1] He is the first child of Kenneth \"Kenny\" Duckworth, a former gang hustler who previously worked at KFC,[2] and Paula Oliver, a hairdresser who previously worked at McDonald's.[2] Both of his parents are African Americans from the South Side of Chicago.[2] When they were teenagers, they relocated to Compton in 1984, due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples.[3] Lamar was named after singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations.[4] He was an only child until the age of seven and was described as a loner by his mother.[2][5] Eventually, his parents had his two younger brothers and younger sister, businesswoman Kayla Sawyer (née Duckworth).[6] His cousins include basketball player Nick Young and rapper Baby Keem.[7][8]\n\nLamar and his family lived in Section 8 housing, were reliant on welfare and food stamps, and experienced homelessness.[9] Although he is not a member of a particular gang, he grew up with close affiliates of the Westside Pirus.[3] Despite suffering hardships, Lamar remembered having \"good memories\" of his childhood that sparked his interest in hip hop music, such as sneaking into his parents' house parties.[2][11] He was raised secular, although he occasionally attended church services and was taught the Bible by his grandmother.[12] He felt \"spiritually unsatisfied\" as a child due to the \"empty\" and \"one-sided\" nature of the sermons.[13]\n\nAfter hearing a recording of his voice for the first time, Lamar became interested in rapping.[14] He was introduced to police brutality after experiencing the first day of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.[2] When he was five years old, he witnessed a murder for the first time while sitting outside of his apartment unit, as a teenage drug dealer was killed in a drive-by shooting.[2] \"It done [sic] something to me right then and there,\" Lamar later admitted to NPR Music. \"It let me know that this is not only something that I'm looking at, but it's something that maybe I have to get used to.\"[15] His parents nicknamed him \"Man-Man\" due to his precocious behavior, although he confessed it \"put a stigma on the idea of me reacting as a kid sometimes—I would hurt myself and they would expect me not to cry.\"[16]\n\nIn school, Lamar was a quiet and observant student who excelled academically and had a noticeable stutter.[17] His first grade teacher at Robert E. McNair Elementary School encouraged him to become a writer after she heard him correctly use the word “audacity\".[18] As a seventh grade student at Vanguard Learning Center, Lamar was introduced to poetry by his English teacher, Regis Inge.[19] Inge integrated the literary form into his curriculum as a response to the growing racial tensions amongst his students.[19] Through its connection to hip hop, Lamar studied rhymes, metaphors and double entendres, which made him fall in love with songwriting: \"You can put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and they'd make sense to you. I liked that.\"[2][19] Instead of completing assignments for other classes, Lamar would scribe lyrics in his notebooks.[19] His initial writing was entirely profane, but it helped him manage his psychological trauma and depression, which he struggled with during his adolescence.[19][20] Inge played a vital role in his intellectual growth, often critiquing his lexicon and suggesting prompts to strengthen his prose.[19]\n\nLamar later attended Centennial High School.[21] He was enrolled in summer school during the tenth grade, which he dreaded because it forced him to be embroiled in a gang war.[21] Despite his efforts to avoid them, Lamar soon became heavily involved with Compton's hedonistic gang culture, which led to numerous health scares and encounters with the police.[2] He distanced himself from the lifestyle following an intervention staged by his father.[5] When he was 16, he was baptized and converted to Christianity following the death of a friend.[22][23] Lamar entered a lasting romantic relationship with his classmate, beautician Whitney Alford.[24] His sexual addiction and repeated infidelity caused numerous difficulties within their on-and-off relationship.[25] Lamar graduated from high school in 2005 as a straight-A student.[26][27] He flirted with the idea of studying psychology and astronomy in college, but suspended his academic pursuits to focus on his music career.[2][28]\n\n2003–2008: Career beginnings\n\nDuring high school, Lamar adopted the stage name K.Dot and began freestyling and battle rapping at school.[1] His performances caught the attention of fellow student Dave Free, who traveled from Inglewood to watch him rap.[1] They quickly formed a friendship over their love of hip hop and the television sitcom Martin.[1] They recorded music together at Free's makeshift garage studio and at his older brother's Hyde Park apartment.[1] Lamar's earliest performances were held at a \"super hood\" comedy club and behind a tattoo parlor.[1] Free was his hype man during that time, while his older brother was his manager and disc jockey.[1] Lamar recorded five mixtapes throughout the 2000s; his first, Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year), was released on April 15, 2003, through Konkrete Jungle Musik.[29] The mixtapes primarily consisted of freestyles over the production of popular hip hop songs.[29]\n\nIn a series of retrospective reviews for Rolling Stone, Mosi Reeves complimented Lamar's \"unerring\" sense of rhythm and timing found in Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year, but criticized his \"overly beholden\" flow and \"clumsy\" lyricism.[29] Free, who was working as a computer technician, introduced the mixtape to record producer Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith while attempting to repair his computer.[30] Tiffith was impressed with Lamar's burgeoning abilities and invited him to partake in an audition process for entry into his newly established independent record label, Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE).[30] During his audition, Lamar freestyled for Tiffith and record executive Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson for two hours, a strategy that impressed Henderson but bewildered Tiffith.[5][31] He was offered a recording contract by TDE in 2005, joining Jay Rock as the label's first signings.[5] Upon signing, he purchased a minority stake in the label for an undisclosed amount.[31]\n\nLamar had a brief stint as a security guard when he started working on music with Jay Rock at TDE's in-house recording studio.[32][27] The bond he formed with him, Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q led to the formation of the hip hop supergroup, Black Hippy.[33] Lamar released his second mixtape, Training Day, on December 30, 2005.[29] Reeves complimented its varied production and \"well-executed\" concept, which was based on the 2001 film of the same name.[29] In 2006, Lamar signed an artist development deal with Def Jam Recordings and was featured on two singles by the Game. He also heavily contributed to Jay Rock's first two mixtapes, Watts Finest Vol. 1 and Watts Finest Vol. 2: The Nickerson Files.[16][34] Lamar was ultimately let go from Def Jam after an encounter with its president and chief executive officer, Jay-Z; he later described it as \"one of those situations where I wasn’t ready.\"[35][36] Lamar and Jay Rock released a collaborative mixtape, title No Sleep 'til NYC, on December 24, 2007.[29] Reeves declared the project as a \"fun cypher session, nothing more, nothing less.\"[29]\n\n2009–2011: Overly Dedicated and Section.80\n\nLamar's third mixtape C4, released on January 30, 2009, is a tribute project to Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter III (2008) and was supported by his co-sign.[37] Reeves felt that the mixtape was a \"wrongheaded homage to a year-old, well-worn album.\"[29] From February to July, he toured with the Game on his LAX Tour as a hype man for Jay Rock.[38][39] Lamar disliked how his stage name diverted attention away from his true identity, and decided to retire it.[40] He opted to use his first and middle names professionally and regards the name change as part of his career growth.\"[41] For his eponymous debut extended play (2009),[42] Lamar eschewed the creative process of his mixtapes in favor of a project heavily focused on his songwriting over \"lovely yet doleful\" production.[29] Reeves described the EP as the \"first standout project\" of his career, praising its melancholic tone.[29] He felt that the project restored his reputation following the sting of criticism he received over C4.[29]\n\nAfter striking a music publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music,[43] Lamar released his fourth mixtape, Overly Dedicated, on September 14, 2010. It was his first project to be purchased through digital retailers.[44] Reeves described Overly Dedicated as a partial \"victory lap\" that marked a shift in his songwriting.[29] The mixtape peaked at number 72 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[45] Lamar served as Jay Rock's hype man for a second time during Tech N9ne's Independent Grind Tour, where Overly Dedicated was introduced to Dr. Dre.[46][47] After watching the music video for the song \"Ignorance Is Bliss\" on YouTube, he reached out to Lamar with hopes of working with him and Snoop Dogg on his unfinished album, Detox.[46][48] He also considered signing him to his record label, Aftermath Entertainment, and was encouraged to by artists such as J. Cole.[49][50]\n\nLamar entered a brief relationship with emcee Nitty Scott,[51][52] and was featured on XXL's 2011 Freshman Class list.[53] He released his debut studio album, Section.80, on July 2, 2011,[54] which was supported by its lead single \"HiiiPower\".[55] The album explored conscious and alternative hip hop styles and experimented with \"stripped-down\" jazz production.[56][57] Ogden Payne of Forbes considers it to be \"the genesis to [Lamar] successfully balancing social commentary with mass appeal.\"[58] Section.80 marked Lamar's first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 113. It sold approximately 5,000 copies in its first week of tracking, with minimal coverage from mainstream media outlets.[59] To promote the album, Lamar performed at small venues and college campuses across the U.S.[60][61] He was dubbed the \"New King of the West Coast\" by Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and the Game during a performance in West Los Angeles.[62][63] At the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards, Section.80 was nominated for Best Mixtape.[64] Throughout the year, he appeared on the Game's The R.E.D. Album, Tech N9ne's All 6's and 7's, 9th Wonder's The Wonder Years, and Drake's Take Care.[65]\n\n2012–2013: Good Kid, M.A.A.D City\n\nLamar began planning his second album before Section.80 was released.[66] From February to April 2012, he opened for Drake on his Club Paradise Tour.[67] He began working with J. Cole on a collaborative album around that time, but nothing came to fruition; Cole later admitted the two \"put it to bed years ago\".[68][69] On March 8, The Fader reported that Lamar had signed a joint venture recording contract with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records; under the deal, TDE continued to serve as his primary label.[70] His first commercial single, \"The Recipe\" featuring Dr. Dre, premiered on rhythmic crossover radio on April 2.[71]\n\nGood Kid, M.A.A.D City, Lamar's second album and first under a major record label, was released on October 22, 2012.[72][73] He worked with producers such as Pharrell Williams, Hit-Boy, Scoop DeVille, Jack Splash, and T-Minus to create an atmospheric West Coast hip hop album with heavy gangsta rap influences.[74] Its lead single, \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\",[75] marked Lamar's first top 20 single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[76] Its other singles, \"Backseat Freestyle\", \"Poetic Justice\", and \"Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe\", enjoyed moderate commercial success.[77][78] Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was met with widespread critical acclaim, who lauded Lamar's nonlinear songwriting and thematic scope. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune applauded him for giving gangsta tropes a \"twist, or sometimes upend[ing] them completely\" on a record that \"brims with comedy, complexity and the many voices in [Lamar’s] head.\"[79] The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 242,000 copies sold;[80] the highest first-week album sales of the year by a male rapper.[81] Good Kid, M.A.A.D City surpassed The Eminem Show (2002) to become the longest-charting hip hop studio album on the Billboard 200.[82] In October 2022, it became the first hip hop studio album to spend over ten consecutive years on the chart.[83]\n\nFrom September to October 2012, Lamar headlined the BET Music Matters Tour with Black Hippy and Stalley.[84] He won Lyricist of the Year at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards,[85] and was featured on ASAP Rocky’s single \"Fuckin' Problems\" alongside Drake and 2 Chainz, which reached the top 10 in the U.S.[86] Lamar embarked on two headlining concert tours in 2013: a national college tour with Steve Aoki and his first international tour.[87][88] He struggled with depression, survivor's guilt and suicidal ideation during promotional events upon learning of the deaths of three close friends.[89] In an interview with MTV, he confessed that \"psychologically, it messes your brain up. You live in this life, you know what I'm saying, but you still have to face realities of this. I gotta get back off that tour bus and go to these funerals.\"[90] From October to December 2013, Lamar opened for Kanye West on his Yeezus Tour, despite disapproval from his label and management team.[91][92] He was baptized for a second time during the beginning of the tour, and experienced a nervous breakdown near the end.[93][94] Lamar won three awards each during the 2013 BET Awards and BET Hip Hop Awards,[95][96] including Best New Artist at the former.[97][98]\n\nLamar was featured on six songs throughout the year: \"YOLO\" by the Lonely Island featuring Adam Levine, that premiered during his first appearance as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live;[99] the remix of \"How Many Drinks?\" by Miguel;[100] \"Collard Greens\" by Schoolboy Q;[101] \"Control\" with Big Sean and Jay Electronica;[102] \"Give It 2 U\" by Robin Thicke featuring 2 Chainz;[103] and \"Love Game\" by Eminem.[104] His performance on \"Control\" was described as a “wake up call” for the hip hop industry and commenced his decade-long feud with Drake.[105] Rolling Stone noted that his verse made the track one of the most important hip hop songs of the last decade.[106] Lamar was named Rapper of the Year by GQ during their annual Men of the Year edition.[107] Following the issue's release, Tiffith pulled him from performing at GQ's accompanying party and accused Steve Marsh's profile on him of containing \"racial overtones\".[108][109]\n\n2014–2016: To Pimp a Butterfly and Untitled Unmastered\n\nAfter his opening stint for the Yeezus Tour ended, Lamar started working on his third album.[92] He earned seven nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (January 2014), including Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, and Album of the Year for Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.[110] He was winless at the ceremony, which several media outlets felt was a snub.[111][112] Macklemore, who won Best New Artist and Best Rap Album, shared a text message that he sent Lamar after the ceremony ended, in which he apologized for winning over him.[113] The incident was the subject of widespread media attention, controversy and Internet memes.[114] During the awards ceremony, Lamar performed a mashup of \"M.A.A.D City\" and \"Radioactive\" with rock band Imagine Dragons, which was met with critical acclaim.[115][116]\n\nLamar opened for Eminem on the Rapture Tour from February to July 2014.[117][118] On August 9, he premiered the short film M.A.A.D, which he starred in, commissioned and produced, during the Sundance Institute's Next Fest.[119] He released \"I\" as the lead single to his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, on September 23, which won Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.[120][121] His performance of \"I\" during his second appearance as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live was lauded by contemporary critics.[122] Lamar was featured on three songs in 2014: \"It's On Again\" by Alicia Keys,[123] \"Babylon\" by SZA,[124] and \"Never Catch Me\" by Flying Lotus.[125] He won Lyricist of the Year for the second consecutive time at the 2014 BET Hip Hop Awards.[126]\n\nOriginally scheduled to arrive at a later date, To Pimp a Butterfly was released on March 15, 2015.[127] The album incorporated various genres synonymous with African American music, such as jazz, funk, and soul.[128] To capture its essence, Lamar recruited producers such as Sounwave, Pharrell Williams, Terrace Martin, and Thundercat.[129] Whitney Alford contributed background vocals on select tracks.[130] Other singles from the album were \"The Blacker the Berry\",[131] \"King Kunta\",[132] \"Alright\", and \"These Walls\"–all of which enjoyed moderate commercial success.[133] Selling 324,000 copies in its first week, To Pimp a Butterfly became Lamar's first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and held Spotify’s global first-day streaming record at the time (9.6 million).[134][135] Billboard commented that \"twenty years ago, a conscious rap record wouldn't have penetrated the mainstream in the way [Lamar] did with To Pimp a Butterfly. His sense of timing is impeccable. In the midst of rampant cases of police brutality and racial tension across America, he spews raw, aggressive bard while possible cutting a rug.\"[136] Pitchfork opined that the album \"forced critics to think deeply about music.\"[137]\n\nIn April 2015, Lamar and Alford announced their engagement.[138][139] He earned his first number-one single on the Hot 100 through the remix of singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\".[140][141] It won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, while the music video for \"Alright\" won Best Direction.[142] Lamar later re-recorded his featured appearance on the \"Bad Blood\" remix in support of Swift's counteraction to her masters dispute.[143][144] He opened the 2015 BET Awards with a controversial performance of \"Alright\" and won Best Male Hip Hop Artist.[145] He also won three awards at the 2015 BET Hip Hop Awards.[146] In support of To Pimp a Butterfly, Lamar embarked on the Kunta's Groove Sessions Tour, which ran from October to November 2015 in select intimate venues across the U.S.[147] For his work on the album and other collaborations throughout the year, Lamar earned 11 nominations at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, the most by a rapper in a single night.[148] He led the winners with five awards: To Pimp a Butterfly was named Best Rap Album, \"Alright\" won Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song, \"These Walls\" won Best Rap/Sung Performance, and \"Bad Blood\" won Best Music Video.[149]\n\nDuring the ceremony, Lamar performed a critically acclaimed medley of \"The Blacker the Berry\", \"Alright\", and an untitled song.[150] He previously performed untitled songs on The Colbert Report (December 2014) and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (January 2016).[151][152] After receiving a request from basketball player LeBron James to share the untitled works, Lamar released his first compilation album, Untitled Unmastered, on March 4, 2016.[153] It contained eight untitled, dated, unfinished, and entirely self-written tracks that were intended to be included on To Pimp a Butterfly, and continued the album's exploration of jazz, funk, soul, and avant-garde styles.[154] Untitled Unmastered received critical acclaim and debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 178,000 album-equivalent units, becoming Lamar's second consecutive number-one project.[155] Throughout the year, he was featured on four commercially successful songs: Beyoncé's \"Freedom\",[156] Maroon 5's \"Don't Wanna Know\",[157][158] the Weeknd's \"Sidewalks\",[159] and Travis Scott's \"Goosebumps\".[160]\n\n2017–2019: Damn and Black Panther: The Album\n\nOn March 1, 2017, during a cover story for T, Lamar confirmed that he was working on his fourth album, Damn.[161] He released the promotional single \"The Heart Part 4\" on March 23, before releasing the album's lead single \"Humble\" on March 30.[162][163] The song debuted at number two on the Hot 100 and reached the top spot in its second week of charting. It is Lamar's second single, and first as a lead artist, to top the Hot 100.[164] Damn was released on April 14.[165] It utilized a more mainstream musical palette than To Pimp a Butterfly, exploring R&B and pop elements.[166] Rolling Stone described its sonics as a \"brilliant combination of the timeless and the modern, the old school and the next-level.\"[167] Damn became Lamar's most commercially successful album. It spent four non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200, marking his third consecutive number-one album, and debuted with 603,000 units sold.[168][169] All of the album's 14 songs debuted on the Hot 100, including the top-20 singles \"Loyalty\" and \"Love\".

it sounds like an actual film.\"[283] He also listened and took influence from Mos Def and Snoop Dogg during his childhood,[284] and said, \"I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Eazy-E.\"[285] 50 Cent's mixtape success inspired Lamar to become an independent artist,[5] while his view on being categorized as a conscious rapper, \"Yeah, I'm a conscious artist because I have a conscience,\" gave him a sense of perspective.[286]\n\nProdigy of Mobb Deep was a key influence on Lamar's earlier mixtapes,[287] while his rapping technique was stemmed from Lil Wayne and his longevity.[288] Eminem and his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) introduced him to songwriting elements, such as ad-libs, and impacted his aggressive approach to records such as \"Backseat Freestyle\".[289][290][291] He took inspiration from N.W.A's tenacity of representing his hometown with \"courage, honesty and artistic brilliance.\"[292] Various R&B and soul artists, including Marvin Gaye,[293] the Isley Brothers,[293] Michael Jackson,[294] Teddy Pendergrass,[295] Sade, and Anita Baker, have influenced Lamar.[296] He performed with Prince, who impacted his vocal register,[297] at Paisley Park to celebrate the release of the latter's 2014 albums Plectrumelectrum and Art Official Age, which GQ described as \"five minutes of brilliant insanity.\"[298] To Pimp a Butterfly was influenced by the works of jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and funk collective Parliament-Funkadelic.[299]\n\nMusical style\n\nThe nature of Lamar's musical style has been described as \"anti-flamboyant, interior and complex.\"[300] He is rooted in West Coast hip hop,[301] and has continually reinvented his sound by branching out into other genres.[302] Due to his contributions to its audience growth, through his appeal to mainstream listeners, music critics generally categorize Lamar as a progressive rap artist.[303] He suggests that his music is genreless, explaining in a 2012 interview, \"You really can't categorize my music, it's human music.\"[304] PopDust opined that during the 2010s, a decade that was arguably defined by hip hop, Lamar constantly pushed the boundaries of what the genre could be.[305]\n\nLamar did not care for music production during the beginning of his career.[306] However, as he placed an emphasis on songwriting and \"making material that's universal\", he grew more exacting and adventurous with his compositions.[306] He is heavily involved with every aspect of his production process, including the mixing and mastering stages, and is known for working long hours in the recording studio.[307] \"You gotta be hands on and know the different sounds and frequencies,\" Lamar explained to Variety.[306] \"What makes people move, what melodies stick with you, taking the higher octaves and the lower octaves and learning how to intertwine that in a certain frequency, how to manipulate sound to your advantage.\"[306] Lamar chooses to work with a close-knit team of musicians, rather than constantly seek high-profile talent.[46] He has been working with his longtime producer, Sounwave, since his 2009 self-titled EP.[29]\n\nKendrick Lamar marked a pivotal change in Lamar's artistry. Unlike his earlier mixtapes, which consisted of freestyles over CHR and urban radio singles, the EP incorporated melancholic and \"doleful\" original production that emphasized his lyrics.[29] Austere jazz production was blended with alternative rap styles on Section.80,[308] with instrumentals drawing from R&B, boom bap, psychedelia, and downtempo.[309] Good Kid, M.A.A.D City abandoned the tastes of contemporary hip hop by exploring a subtle, atmospheric side of West Coast hip hop and gangsta rap.[310][311] To Pimp a Butterfly is an amalgamation of genres synonymous with African-American music, most prominently jazz, funk, and soul.[312][313] It redefined jazz rap by highlighting improvisation and soloing rather than primarily using sampling.[314][315] Minimalist arrangements are incorporated in Damn and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.[316][317] Damn appealed to mainstream listeners through its pop and R&B-influenced production,[318] while the scattered and distorted instrumentals of Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was designed to make listeners feel anxious and uncomfortable.[319]\n\nVoice\n\nSeveral media outlets consider Lamar to be the greatest and most important rapper of his generation.[320][321] Billboard, Forbes and Vibe named him the second-greatest rapper of all time, behind Jay-Z.[322][323] Described as a \"blazing\" technical rapper and \"relentless searcher\" by The New York Times,[300] Lamar's \"limber, dexterous\" flow switches from derivative to generative metrics,[324] while incorporating internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes. His rhymes are typically manipulated within common time, allowing him to subtly control his metrical phonology and suggest formal ambiguities similar to pop and rock repertoires. Some of his rhyme manipulations feature \"flexible\" new school styles evoking the 1990s, while others use \"rigid\" old school elements recalling the 1980s. Lamar frequently uses syncopation in his melodies to create contradictions between his lyrical content and rhythms. With Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, he liberally plays with pronunciation, inflections, and delivery to mirror the album's emotional range.[328]\n\nLamar possesses a versatile tenor vocal range[329][330] and a raspy, half-shout timbre, where \"his throat sounds dry and his mouth sounds wet.\"[331] André 3000 was the first rapper that introduced him to singing sensibilities in hip hop,[332] and he writes melody-driven songs as practice for his rap albums.[332] Lamar became comfortable with his vocals over time, to the point where he feels confident enough to create singing-based albums.[333] Pitchfork noticed how his harmonies on To Pimp a Butterfly never made him sound alone throughout his \"desolate\" performance; comparing his vocal layering to \"standing in the middle, unnoticed, of a large quarrelsome crowd.\"[334]\n\nPraised for his willingness to use his voice as an instrument,[335] Lamar adopts different cadences, tones, modulations, and timbres to suggest conflicting personalities, paint distinct emotions, and communicate stories using characters and personas.[336][337] His falsetto register, which he calls the \"ghetto falsetto\",[332] has been likened to Curtis Mayfield's.[338] MTV writes that by manipulating his voice, Lamar calls back to a lineage that runs through James Brown's foundational work in the 1960s, 1970s psychedelia, Prince's \"sweaty\" phantasmagoria in the 1980s, and 1990s gangsta rap.[339] He was ranked the tenth-best solo singer of the 21st century by The Times in 2023.[340]\n\nSongwriting\n\nBranded as a \"master of storytelling\" by The New Yorker,[337] Lamar has been referred to as one of the greatest lyricists in modern hip hop by several publications and his peers.[341][342] Pharrell Williams suggests that what makes his songwriting stand out is because he \"knows how to be very disciplined with a subject matter, he knows that stickiness is important, and he knows that it has to be great.\"[343] American Songwriter notes that for as much as Lamar is a musician, lyricist, and emcee, he is also \"a playwright, a novelist, a short story author. He's literary within the art form of music.\"[344] Lamar's reflective narrative songwriting pulls from a wide range of literary and cinematic techniques, such as hip hop skits and voice-overs, to allow his audience to follow internal and external storylines.[345] His fusion of various film styles and his sonic influence has elevated his works to be some of the most \"consistently poignant\" in hip hop, and promoted the advancement of the narrative device.[345]\n\nLamar, who self-identifies as a musician and writer,[161] begins his songwriting process with an assortment of premeditated thoughts that he jotted down over the course of one year.[346] His personal experiences are a common source of inspiration, but he also pulls ideas from meeting new people, traveling, and experiencing different cultures.[346] A devout Christian, he additionally shares his spiritual triumphs and struggles on his songs.[347][348] He is an avid note-taker, and has developed keywords, phrases, and sounds to help him \"trigger the exact emotions\" he felt when writing the initial demo.[346] Considered to be a \"radio-friendly but overtly political rapper\" by Pitchfork,[349] and a populist by The Wall Street Journal,[350] Lamar's songwriting regularly infuses political criticism and social commentary concerning African-American culture.[351] Common themes explored include racial inequality, institutional discrimination, and black empowerment.[352] Lamar's critiques has been compared to the State of the Union Address by The Guardian,[353] while Billboard described it as \"Shakespearean\".[354] HuffPost opined that his work is a \"great\" piece of journalism because it \"speaks from the prerogative of black communities facing oppression and directly attacks the institutions responsible for their pain,\" an achievement most reporters cannot attain.[355]\n\nLamar tries to carry a conceptual idea inside of his music, \"whether it's a big concept or it's so subtle you can't even tell until you get to 20 listens.\"[306] Fans and publications have theorized that his albums are related to different forms of mass media.[356] Section.80 is regarded as a short story collection inspired and themed around events that impacted the millennial generation, such as Ronald Reagan's presidency.[357][358] The nonlinear narrative structure of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City is billed as a coming-of-age short film that chronicles Lamar's harsh teenage experiences in his native Compton.[359][360] Its cinematic scope has been compared to the screenplays written by filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.[361][362] To Pimp a Butterfly unfolds as both a poem and blank letter that explores the responsibilities of being a role model and documents life as an African American during Barack Obama's presidency.[363][364] Damn is labeled as an introspective satire that explores the dualities of human nature and morality.[365][366] Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers takes on the form of a theatrical play, with confessional lyrics based on Lamar's experiences in therapy.[367][368] Lamar has won the BET Hip Hop Award for Lyricist of the Year nine times, the most wins by any artist.[369] He has also published articles for Billboard,[370] Interview,[371] Paper,[372] and XXL.[373]\n\nReception\n\nLegacy\n\nAs one of the most influential musicians of the 2010s decade, Lamar has been deemed a paradigm shift in contemporary hip hop and popular culture.[374][375] His discography became a catalyst in the upsurge of social conscience across multiple generations;
