        "text": "Right now I'm watching him on youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRQgQhcEPHI&feature=related) and everytime I see these videos or listen to the one cd I have right now (Avalon Blues, I'm looking for more) I think, this is THE best. I can't get over how he pulls so many notes out of that guitar at a time. I can do a little fingerpicking myself, but just watching or listening to him blows my mind. I'm gonna throw it out there and say he's better than Robert Johnson in my mind. (Because we know better is subjective in music) I love listening to this stuff and if there's anyone who hasn't listened to him reading this go and watch those clips, you'll love it.\n\none of my barely remembered early influences - thanks for reminding me.\n\nI love it, the guitar is so sweet and lyrical, then you see those big old hands and fingers and you wonder \"how the heck does he do it? And I notice he only uses the thumb and two fingers most of the time (at least on this video).\n\nAbsolutely wonderful. There such a warmth to his music,\n\nand the man himself seems so gentle and kind.\n\nI first heard him on this fine album:\n\nI have most everything he recorded. He's probally my biggest musical influence bar none.\n\nI consider the poorly named Vangaurd \"The Best of ...\" to be THE greatest live performance recorded of guitar work..period..\n\nI've been facinated by that album for nearly 30 years. I've owned it on LP..CD..even Cassette tape.\n\nI still pick at least one John Hurt song nearly every time I pick up a guitar.\n\nHis music is soooo subtle. It seems simplistic, but even after learning a piece note for note from his recordings I can NEVER make it sound like Mr. Hurt.\n\nAnymore I'm just happy to have a big repertoire of John Hurt Songs that I can play with my own unique voice.\n\nGee..can you tell I like him?\n\nAnother big influence of mine in simular style is Mance Lipscomb. Check him out.\n\nAlso look for recordings of the late great John Jackson. I was VERY fortunate to have known him and sit with him many times to hear him play and talk with him about music. He was a good friend of my Uncles' and of my Step Father.\n\nAnyway, it's good to see John Hurt's legacy living on and on.\n\ni have most of the lp's appearing above and totally agree that john hurt was a master fingerstlyist.\n\ni think he was a tremendous influence on many of contemporary fingerstylists (hedges, de grassi, finger, reed et al) and especially on the modern folk blues purists. and, his voice? it was as soft as the cotton he raised...\n\ni believe his daughter or grand daughter is setting up a memorial site for him in avalon. i think it's at his cabin (home).\n\njerry garcia owed a great debt to john hurt, too. (i.e. louis collins) lot's of john hurt in jerry's music.\n\nimho.\n\nrand z tropicalsoul.net"
