        "text": "The years between the first and second World Wars were the incubation period for the blues.\n\nAll the big, brash styles we came to know later, wailing electric guitars, electric bass and punchy brass sections were still years ahead.\n\nIt was the burgeoning talent and ingenuity of simple yet amazingly talented working men in places like Mississippi which was laying down the foundations of a great tradition and a guitar technique which we in the future would never improve upon.\n\nIf you’re young and have come to the blues lately, you might ask why you need these very old recordings.\n\nThe answer is simple – they’re brilliant, inspirational and they are the golden frame around the colourful canvas of the blues.\n\nThe truly great Mississippi John Hurt (1893-1966) along with names such as Skip James, Blind Willie Johnson and Son House are the foundation stones of the blues.\n\nThese 19 sparkling tracks recorded for Okeh in 1928 which form Spike Driver Blues belie their age.\n\nHurt was on fine form. His lilting voice is clear over a superb guitar style all his own, with a technique which would be avidly studied and taken up by every acoustic bluesman since.\n\nThe Hurt classics are here; Stack O’Lee, Spike Driver Blues, Candy Man Blues and wonderful religious songs such as Blessed Be The Name and Praying On The Old Camp Ground.\n\nMasterful fingerpicking, graceful vocals, if you don’t already have them, these recordings with James Chumet’s comprehensive 16-page booklet are essential to any blues fan.\n\nROY BAINTON"
