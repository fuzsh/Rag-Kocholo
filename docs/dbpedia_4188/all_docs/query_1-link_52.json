It is astonishing that this man, in the final months of his life, could do 17 songs that were the equal of anything he had done at his first sessions 45 years earlier, his playing (supported on some tracks with producer Patrick Sky on second guitar) as alluringly complex as ever and his voice still in top form. Hurt is brilliant throughout, his voice overpowering in its mixture of warmth, gentleness, and power, and in addition to the expected crop of standards and originals, he covers songs by Bukka White (\"Poor Boy, Long Ways from Home\") and Leadbelly (\"Goodnight Irene\") -- all of it is worthwhile, with some tracks, such as \"Let the Mermaids Flirt with Me,\" especially haunting.\n\n&copy Bruce Eder /TiVo\n\nMore info\n\nAlbum review\n\nRecorded in New York during February and July of 1966, the 17 songs on this collection represent Mississippi John Hurt's final studio efforts.
