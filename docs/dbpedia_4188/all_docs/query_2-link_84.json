Blues: The Library Of Congress Recordings” if you want to dig deeper.\n\nMississippi John Hurt playlist\n\nContributor: Rick Kronberg\n\nThe animating spirit behind most of the exciting popular music of the last fifty years is that anyone can do it. Punk, hip-hop, DJ music – they’re all driven by the idea of “That can be me up there. I can do that.”\n\nThat is not the feeling you get when you listen to Mississippi John Hurt. Nobody can be him.\n\nNone of us have the biography. We weren’t born in a small shack in the Mississippi Delta in the 1890s. The chances are slim that any of us will invent an entire style of music to “just make it sound like I think it ought to.” And we certainly don’t have the same right hand (more on that later).\n\nThere is only one Mississippi John Hurt. But there are endless superlatives to describe him. One of the most charismatic and magnetic performers you will ever see. A guitar God before such a thing existed. A superstar who didn’t hit it big until his seventies. However you choose to define the ‘it factor’, very few had more of it than John Hurt.\n\nI first came to Mississippi John Hurt’s music through the original mixtape, the Anthology Of American Folk Music. After a couple listens to the entire 6 CD set, his two songs leaped out. Do you know how good you have to be to win the Anthology Of American Folk Music? Check out his two contributions, Spike Driver Blues and Frankie.\n\nThose two are part of a slew of songs he recorded for OKeh Records in 1928. To broaden the music’s appeal, the record company added the word ‘Blues’ to half the song titles, even though they’re not actually blues songs (proving that record company execs have always been bad news). He sings with none of the raspy grit that is the hallmark of the delta blues. There’s no shouting. Instead his vocals are smooth, warm and understated. The word most often used to describe his singing is ‘gentle.’ It fits.\n\nHis guitar playing is something else entirely. It is not an overstatement to say he was one of the most inventive and flat-out skilled guitarists of any era. Self-taught from the age of 9, he created his own style, a highly rhythmic, insanely precise fingerpicking approach that owes more to ragtime than the blues. His right hand is a thing of wonder. You can see it best on this live video of Spike Driver Blues:\n\nAs the story goes, an enthusiastic guitar student played Mississippi John Hurt for his teacher, the legendary classical guitarist Andrés Segovia. Segovia wondered who the second guitarist was. There was none.\n\nThe heartbreaking Louis Collins and Avalon Blues round out my selections from the 20s. Avalon Blues turned out to be the song that had the biggest impact on John Hurt’s life and career. But it took decades for that to play out.\n\nOne year after his OKeh recordings, the great depression hit. The musical career of Mississippi John Hurt was effectively over. He stayed in Mississippi, raised 14 children with his (very busy) wife, working a series of jobs, mainly as a sharecropper and laborer, sometimes playing at local dances.\n\nFast forward 35 years. The folk music boom in college campuses and coffee houses in the northeast was at its peak. Enter Tom Hoskins and Mike Stewart, two folk music collectors and archivists. Inspired by the Anthology Of American Folk Music and Hurt’s OKeh recordings, they decided to try and track down Mississippi John Hurt. All they had to go by was the lyric from Avalon Blues: “Avalon’s my hometown, always on my mind.”\n\nThe odds of finding him – let alone with his skills intact – were a billion to one. It hit.\n\nThat’s how at age 71, Mississippi John Hurt began an extraordinary and unparalleled comeback. Time had eroded none of his skills. If anything, he just got better, deeper. To listen to these sessions is humbling. How could somebody so goddamn talented be unknown to so many people? The guy is a force of nature.\n\nThe perfect introduction to his 1960s music is Coffee Blues. Listen for the chorus. A fairly famous band took their name from it.\n\nFor the next three years, starting at age 70, Mississippi John Hurt was a top draw on the folk music circuit. It’s not hard to see why he was an instant smash. He played all the biggest festivals to rapturous responses (check out the astounding footage of him at Newport at the foot of this post) and even was a guest on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Make Me A Pallet On Your Floor and I’m Satisfied are two obvious highlights. They put all of his strengths on display.\n\nI’m Satisfied is a particular standout. One thing you notice about his music is how happy so much of it is. There can be little doubt he lived a hard life in Jim Crow Mississippi. But that pain and struggle isn’t necessarily reflected in his music. What comes through is his warmth, gentle spirit, and the force of his otherworldly talent that time could not extinguish.\n\nFor the bulk of his life, Hurt played small juke joints in the Mississippi delta, where the most important job was to keep everyone dancing. It’s easy to imagine Salty Dog Blues getting everyone out on the floor.\n\nIf I had to choose a favorite, right now it would be Boys, You’re Welcome. This is just one of the flat-out catchiest songs you will ever hear. His guitar playing is always flawless, (as if he has three hands and forty-three fingers), but what gets me here is his voice. It was recorded just a few months before he passed away at 73, for what became his Last Sessions album. Finally sounding worn down from age, some of his smoothness is gone, but his friendliness and irrepressible spirit are undiminished. Mississippi John Hurt went out on top.\n\nWe’ll close out with Trouble, I’ve Had All My Day from his D.C. Library of Congress sessions. In just two days, he recorded 36 songs live in the studio, him and his guitar. The degree of difficulty is off-the-charts. It’s safe to say that there are only a few people in history who could sing and play like this. That’s what strikes me most about Mississippi John Hurt. The guy was an immortal. The fact that Hoskins and Stewart were able to track him down and convince him to start playing again after decades (he didn’t even own a guitar when they found him) is one of history’s greatest gifts.\n\nThat’s my top ten for Mississippi John Hurt. Ask me next week and I can find ten, twenty, or thirty more (Candy Man, First Shot Missed Him, Stack O’ Lee leap to mind). There are no bad Mississippi John Hurt songs. How could there be? Look who’s performing them.\n\nMississippi John Hurt performing “Talking Casey” at Newport 1964\n\n“He was born, John Smith Hurt, however, his actual date of birth is a bit of a mystery. The most likely is March 8th, 1893. This is the date written in the Hurt family Bible, and accepted by his biographer and several other researchers. The birth date on his grave stone, however, is March 3rd, 1892.” (American Blues Scene)\n\nMississippi John Hurt (1893-1966)\n\nThe Mississippi John Hurt Foundation\n\nMississippi John Hurt Illustrated Discogaphy (from Stefan Wirz)\n\n“Mississippi John Hurt – His Life, His Times, His Blues”\n\nby Philip R Ratcliffe (University Press of Mississippi, 2018)\n\nMississippi John Hurt biography (AllMusic)\n\nRick Kronberg is a music geek and advertising professional hailing from New Jersey, where he lives with his wife and three children who do not want to hear him mansplain about Elvis.
