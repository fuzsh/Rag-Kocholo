Blues singer Mississippi John Hurt passed away in November last year following a heart attack. He was 74 years old. Hurt had seen a resurgence in his career in the 4 years before his death, following his 'rediscovery' and subsequent recording contract with Vanguard.

Immortal is the second release from Vanguard of Hurt's recordings, following last year's Today!
