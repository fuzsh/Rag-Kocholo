Those vehicles, which include snowmobiles, are subject to other laws and regulations.\n\nATV REGISTRATION AND DATE OF EXPIRATION\n\nAn ATV must be registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) if it is operated anywhere in New York State, including on the owner's property.\n\nWhen you register a new or used ATV for the first time, your registration will expire each year on August 31. Registrations for ATVs originally registered before April 1, 2005, will continue to expire each year on April 30.\n\nATV dealers are required by law to register every ATV they sell to New York State residents or to non-residents before the purchaser takes delivery; unless the purchaser qualifies for an exemption from registration. A purchaser is exempt from registration when the ATV will be used exclusively: outside of New York State; at special events; for agricultural purposes; or for snow plowing other than for-hire. Dealers must have the purchaser complete and sign a \"Declaration of Exemption From Snowmobile or All-Terrain Vehicle Registration\" (RV-6).\n\nUnless you qualify for an exemption from registration, you cannot take delivery from an authorized dealer until after the ATV is registered.\n\nIf you buy an ATV from a person who is not a New York State registered ATV dealer, you must register the ATV with the DMV. To register the ATV; you must complete an \"Vehicle Registration/Title Application\" (MV-82) and submit it to a motor vehicle issuing office.

The bill of sale must contain the dealer's name, address and dealer registration number, plus your name and address, the ATV vehicle identification number, the year, make, model, and number of wheels. The bill of sale also must indicate that the ATV is either new or used, and must confirm that the dealer has collected the appropriate sales tax.\n\nIf you buy the ATV from a person who is not a registered dealer, you must pay the sales tax at a motor vehicle office. To determine the proper amount of sales tax, the DMV needs proof of what you paid for the ATV. Have the seller sign and give you a Statement of Transaction- Sale or Gift of Motor Vehicle, Trailer, All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV), Vessel (Boat), or Snowmobile (pdf) (at NY State Department of Tax and Finance) (DTF-802). You must submit this form to the motor vehicle office, and pay the appropriate sales tax, before registering your ATV:\n\nAcceptable documents that prove payment of sales tax are:\n\nThe dealer's bill of sale showing that the dealer had collected the sales tax; or\n\nA receipt for sales tax payment from the motor vehicle office.\n\nPROOF OF IDENTITY AND DATE OF BIRTH\n\nTo register an ATV, you must provide proof of who you are.

Minimum required coverage is $50,000/$100,000 for death, $25,000/$50,000 for injury, and $10,000 for property damage in any one accident. You must show proof of this insurance upon the request of a judge, the police, or a person claiming to have suffered injury or property damage from your operation of the ATV.\n\nCHANGE OF ADDRESS\n\nIf you move, cross out the old address on your registration document and write in the new one.

If you cross, you must follow these rules:\n\nYou must cross at an angle of approximately 90 degrees, at a place where there are no obstructions to prevent a quick, safe crossing.\n\nYou must come to a complete stop and yield the right-of-way to traffic on the highway before crossing.\n\nYou may cross a divided highway only where it intersects with another street or highway.\n\nYou may not cross an interstate highway or any controlled-access highway, such as the Thruway or a parkway at any time.\n\nON HIGHWAYS\n\nYou may not operate an ATV on a highway unless it has been designated and posted for ATV use by the state or local authority. Usually, only the part of a highway between two off-highway trails will be posted for ATV use. Check with local police to be sure. DMV recommends that you turn your headlight and taillight on and wear bright, reflective clothing whenever you ride on a highway. Always enter the highway with care, and yield to other traffic.\n\nON PUBLIC LAND\n\nYou may not operate an ATV on public land unless it is specifically designated for ATV use, and it is allowed by a posted sign.\n\nON PRIVATE LAND\n\nTo operate an ATV on private land, you must have permission of the land owner or lessee. If you receive permission, make sure you know the boundaries of the property, and respect any special restrictions or requests of the land owner. You could lose permission to ride on private land by littering, causing damage, or riding carelessly.\n\nREQUIRED EQUIPMENT\n\nWhether you are the operator or passenger, you must wear a USDOT-approved helmet when riding an ATV.

For greater safety, DMV recommends you keep the lights on at all times.\n\nRIDING RESTRICTIONS\n\nIn addition to obeying the ATV laws and rules, it is wise to ride your ATV with common sense and courtesy. Having fun on an ATV does not include annoying others or taking foolish risks. ATV riders who ignore the rules and the rights of others may cause ATV operation to be restricted or prohibited on private and public lands.\n\nYOU MAY NEVER OPERATE AN ATV\n\nOther than while seated on the permanent, regular seat.\n\nWith a passenger, unless the ATV is designed to carry a passenger.\n\nAt a speed too fast for existing conditions or potential hazards.\n\nIn a careless, reckless or negligent manner.\n\nWhile intoxicated or impaired by alcohol or drugs.\n\nOn the tracks or right-of-way of a railroad.\n\nOn a highway, if the ATV is equipped with studded tires other than automobile-type studs.\n\nIn a tree nursery or planting in a manner which damages or destroys growing stock or creates a substantial risk of damage or destruction.\n\nWithin 100 feet of a dwelling between midnight and 6 A.M. at a speed greater than necessary to keep the ATV moving.\n\nWhile pulling a person on skis, a toboggan, sleigh, sled or trailer, unless the device is attached to the ATV by a tow-bar or other rigid connection.\n\nOn the ice or public water within 100 feet of a person, fishing shanty or shelter at a speed greater than necessary to keep the ATV moving.\n\nOver an area cleared of snow for skating, unless necessary for access to public waters.\n\nLOCAL LAWS\n\nNo locality may require its own ATV licenses or registrations, but it may impose additional restrictions or rules on ATV operation.

You also must show proof of insurance to persons claiming to have suffered injury or damage. If property is damaged, and you cannot locate the owner, you must give the above information to police as soon as possible.\n\nYou must immediately report to the police any accident that involves death, personal injury or damage estimated at $600 or more to the property of any one person.\n\nYou must also file a Report of Motor Vehicle Accident (MV-104) with the Department of Motor Vehicles about an accident that results in a fatality, personal injury, or property damage estimated at $1,000 or more. You must file the report within 10 days of the accident and send a copy to the county sheriff or police commissioner.\n\nIf you are incapacitated, the written report may be filed by another party familiar with the accident. The investigating police officer must also file a written report, but that does not relieve you of your legal responsibility to file one.\n\nFailure to report an accident is a misdemeanor. A conviction may result in suspension or revocation of your safety training certificate and/or the ATV registration.\n\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles may suspend your safety training certificate and/or the ATV registration until you file an acceptable written report.\n\nAdditional information can be found at: Register and title a recreational vehicle (snowmobile, boat, moped or ATV)\n\nNEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES\n\nMark J.
