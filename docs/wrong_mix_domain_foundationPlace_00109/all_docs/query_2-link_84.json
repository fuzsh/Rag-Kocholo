        "text": "What is Kawasaki disease?\n\nKawasaki (pronounced cow-a-SA-kee) disease causes inflammation of the small blood vessels in the body. This can be dangerous because it can damage the blood vessels of the heart. It can also affect many other parts of your child’s body, including their skin; eyes; lymph nodes; and lining of the mouth, nose and throat (mucous membranes).\n\nIf your child has Kawasaki disease, it is important to get care right away. Treatment is much more likely to work if given within 10 days of the start of symptoms. With treatment, most children recover fully within weeks and do not have lasting problems.\n\nInflammation of the heart and Kawasaki disease (Video. 2:11)\n\nDr. Michael Portman explains how his research into the causes of inflammation may lead to better treatments for Kawasaki disease.\n\nSymptoms of Kawasaki Disease\n\nChildren with Kawasaki disease usually have some or all of these symptoms:\n\nFever higher than 101.5 degrees that lasts for at least 4 or 5 days\n\nRed, patchy skin rash on the trunk and around the groin or diaper area\n\nSwelling and redness in the hands and feet, with peeling skin later on\n\nRed, bloodshot eyes, similar to pinkeye (conjunctivitis) but without pus\n\nSwollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits\n\nRed, swollen and cracked lips, mouth, throat and tongue (sometimes called strawberry tongue)\n\nSome children also get swollen joints, pain, stomachache, diarrhea and vomiting. It is common for children to be fussy because of their symptoms.\n\nDiagnosing Kawasaki Disease\n\nTo diagnose this condition, your child’s doctor will examine your child and check their temperature. The doctor will ask for details about any symptoms your child has, their health history and your family health history.\n\nThere is no specific test for Kawasaki disease. Blood tests, such as the C-reactive protein test and a complete blood count, help to support the diagnosis.\n\nTo rule out other illnesses and to check your child’s heart, the doctor might do tests like blood tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiography and chest X-rays.\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nFind out what you need to know about your child’s hospital stay and hospital campus amenities.\n\nWho’s on the team?\n\nYour team at the hospital may ask permission for your child to take part in a clinical research study, or clinical trial, to learn more about Kawasaki disease. Read more about our Kawasaki disease research program.\n\nContact Us\n\nContact the Heart Center at 206-987-2515 for an appointment at the Kawasaki Disease Clinic, a second opinion or more information.\n\nProviders, see how to refer a patient.\n\nRelated Links\n\nRelated Programs\n\nCardiac Catheterization\n\nHeart Center\n\nRelated Research\n\nKawasaki Disease Research Program\n\nResources for Patients and Families\n\nKawasaki Disease (PDF) (Spanish)\n\nWhat to Expect: Chest X-ray\n\nWhat to Expect: Electrocardiogram\n\nWhat to Expect: Echo\n\nWhat to Expect: Exercise Tests\n\nKawasaki Disease Foundation\n\nSupport Groups\n\nKDF Bridges Program\n\nFor Healthcare Professionals"
