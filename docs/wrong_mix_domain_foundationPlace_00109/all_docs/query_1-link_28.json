Internships can be completed as nearby as Los Angeles and as far away as any international location of the student’s choosing. Students often elect to register their internships for academic credit.\n\nInternational and transfer students are offered comparable opportunities as first-year students, successfully completing internships and going on to rewarding careers.\n\nLearn more about Career and Professional Development\n\n2 of every 3\n\nstudents in the class of 2023 completed an internship.\n\n3,200\n\ninternships available.\n\nSilicon Beach: L.A.’s new career frontier\n\nFaculty enhance student learning by bringing the classroom to employers. The adjacent neighborhood of “Silicon Beach” in Playa Vista is home to over 500 technology start-up companies, as well as global giants such as Facebook, Google, Snapchat, YouTube, and Yahoo! The entrepreneurial spirit and energy of Silicon Beach is endless, as are the opportunities for students to connect and engage with the employers who reside there.\n\nLearn more about Silicon Beach"
