        "text": "IT Strategy & Digital Integration Division supports the growth of Hitachi by providing IT solutions to more than 300,000 users of the Hitachi Group worldwide. In order for Hitachi Group to achieve social innovation on a global level, professional IT services to support management of the entire Hitachi group are necessary. Specifically, the expectations for IT-driven innovation and new value creation have recently been rising. In its drive to be an innovation partner in the IoT era, it is important for the Hitachi Group to apply data analytics to accelerate competitive creativity and synergies in the group, and to transform operations.\n\nOur mission is to (1) discover issues and needs in Hitachifs management, business and operations, and making full use of technology and data to solve issues and create value, and (2) promote IT sophistication and digital transformation company-wide, and to provide an overall optimal common platform. As such, departments are divided into those that mainly handle account support, which provides IT solutions while grasping the individual issues of each business and operation, and those that mainly handle the development and operation of IT solutions and services. These two groups cooperate and work together to promote the use of IT and digital.\n\nOrganizational structure of internal IT departments\n\nThe IT Strategy & Digital Integration Division controls the IT of a huge organization comprising of approximately 700 global Group companies and approximately 300,000 employees. It is necessary to implement common measures that give a bird's-eye view of the entire Group while also respecting the independence of each business unit and Group company, in order to reduce IT costs and respond to security risks which are increasingly important. Hitachi Group's IT Department consists of two levels of organization in order to achieve both quick decisions for each business segment and realization of common measures.\n\nTo be specific, the IT Strategy & Digital Integration Division controls the entire Hitachi Group, coordinating with the IT departments that exist within each business unit and Group company to roll out initiatives.\n\nIn addition, we have appointed IT managers in Europe, the US, China, India and Singapore to promote the realization of common global IT measures."
