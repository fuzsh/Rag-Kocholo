        "text": "Whether you're using BMW ConnectedRide products or your smartphone, the ConnectedRide Navigator combines all the devices and media applications into one device. For example, the navigation function, telephony and media are grayed out on the TFT display of the bike and clearly shown on the display of the ConnectedRide Navigator when the connection between bike and navigator is active. And thanks to BMW ID and BMW Motorrad Cloud Integration, you can easily synchronize your route planning from the BMW Motorrad Connected app with the ConnectedRide Navigator.\n\nWith the navigation preparation, available as optional equipment for new models or as a retrofit solution, the ConnectedRide Navigator also connects many older BMW motorbikes built from 2014 onwards to the roads of the world. Simply click in, lock and enjoy the benefits of the ConnectedRide Navigator.\n\nThe world at your fingertips"
