        "meta_description": "Kawasaki disease is an acute, systemic vasculitis that predominantly affects patients younger than five years. It represents the most prominent cause of acquired coronary artery disease in childhood. In the United States, 19 per 100,000 children younger than five years are hospitalized with Kawasaki disease annually. According to U.S. and Japanese guidelines, Kawasaki disease is a clinical diagnosis. Classic (typical) Kawasaki disease is diagnosed based on the presence of a fever lasting five or more days, accompanied by four out of five findings: bilateral conjunctival injection, oral changes such as cracked and erythematous lips and strawberry tongue, cervical lymphadenopathy, extremity changes such as erythema or palm and sole desquamation, and polymorphous rash. Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease occurs in persons with fever lasting five or more days and with two or three of these findings. Transthoracic echocardiography is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice to screen for coronary aneurysms, although other techniques are being evaluated for diagnosis and management. Treatment for acute disease is intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin. If there is no response to treatment, patients are given a second dose of intravenous immunoglobulin with or without corticosteroids or other adjunctive treatments. The presence and severity of coronary aneurysms and obstruction at diagnosis determine treatment options and the need, periodicity, and intensity of long-term cardiovascular monitoring for potential atherosclerosis.",

The presence and severity of coronary aneurysms and obstruction at diagnosis determine treatment options and the need, periodicity, and intensity of long-term cardiovascular monitoring for potential atherosclerosis.\n\nThese clinical features tend to appear sequentially, which helps to differentiate Kawasaki disease from other disorders (Table 27,12 ). In the acute phase, conjunctival injection (Figure 1) occurs soon after the fever and is usually bilateral, nonpurulent, and painless, and spares the limbus. Oral changes include cracking and erythema of the lips (Figure 2) and a strawberry tongue. Cervical lymphadenopathy is unilateral and includes at least one lymph node greater than 1.5 cm in diameter. The polymorphous rash usually occurs within five days after fever onset and may present as a generalized maculopapular exanthema (Figure 3), erythema multiforme–like eruption, or scarlatiniform rash (Figure 4). Extremity changes may include induration and erythema of the hands (Figure 5) and feet (Figure 6); in the subacute phase, two to three weeks after fever onset, the fingers and toes may desquamate. Although not diagnostic, a variety of less common features, including gastrointestinal (diarrhea, emesis, and abdominal pain), respiratory (cough and rhinorrhea), and rheumatologic (joint pain and swelling) symptoms, may occur in patients with Kawasaki disease.7,8\n\nCopyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nThis content is owned by the AAFP.
