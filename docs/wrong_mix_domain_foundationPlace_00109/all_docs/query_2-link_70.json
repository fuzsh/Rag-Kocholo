        "text": "Causes of Kawasaki disease\n\nThe exact causes of Kawasaki disease are unknown. It is also not known why some children get the disease and others do not. It is possible that genetics play a role in the development of Kawasaki disease.\n\nIt is also possible a viral or bacterial infection may trigger the disease in children. Infections and Kawasaki disease often occur at the same time.\n\nKawasaki disease is not contagious\n\nKawasaki disease not spread from child to child, but infections can trigger Kawasaki disease.\n\nIt is rare for two children in the same family to get Kawasaki disease. When this occurs, it may be related to inherited genes that help to control the immune system.\n\nDiagnosis of Kawasaki disease\n\nThe diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is made when a child has at least five consecutive days of fever and at least four out of the other five symptoms mentioned above. In some cases, a child will have fewer than four symptoms. Kawasaki disease often mimics other diseases, such as common childhood infections. These factors make the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease more difficult.\n\nKawasaki disease is a rare illness. It usually affects children under the age of five, but older children can also be affected.\n\nThere is no specific test to diagnose Kawasaki disease. However, your child will have a blood test and a urine test, as well as an echocardiogram. This is an ultrasound that takes pictures of your child's heart. It lets doctors see if there are any changes in the coronary arteries. If these arteries are affected, they may look widened or swollen.\n\nTreatment of Kawasaki disease\n\nA child with Kawasaki disease will need to stay in the hospital for several days. The health-care team will give your child medicine to decrease the inflammation in the blood vessels and try to prevent damage to the coronary arteries. These medicines are called intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), steroids (prednisone) and ASA (acetylsalicylic acid or Aspirin)​. It is important to recognize that the treatment of Kawasaki disease differs for every child. Your health-care team will use a combination of medications that best suits your child’s specific needs.\n\nAfter a child is treated, the fever usually goes away for good. Sometimes a child will need a second treatment with IVIG or other medicines.\n\nIVIG\n\nIVIG is given through an intravenous (IV) needle in your child's vein. It helps reduce the inflammation in the body. In turn, this can:\n\nreduce the fever and redness caused by the disease\n\nhelp protect against heart problems\n\nIVIG contains antibodies from donated blood. It is screened for viruses and bacteria before it is used as a treatment. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this treatment. Please see the IVIG page on AboutKidsHealth for more information.\n\nSteroids\n\nSteroids, such as prednisone, can help to reduce the inflammation in the body and are sometimes needed in children with Kawasaki disease. Your health-care team will tell you if your child needs steroids. Steroids can:\n\nreduce the fever and redness caused by the disease\n\nhelp protect against heart problems\n\nWhen steroids are prescribed for Kawasaki disease, they are usually given as 1 to 2 doses per day for about 3 weeks. Your health-care team will give you a plan for slowly decreasing the dose of steroids until you can stop them completely. If fever occurs while your child is decreasing their dose of steroids, please contact your health-care team for further instruction.\n\nThe side effects of steroids differ between long-term use and short-term use. For the treatment of Kawasaki disease, steroids will be used in the short term. Some common side effects with short-term steroid use may include:\n\nincreased appetite\n\nirritability\n\nincreased or slowed heart rate\n\ntrouble sleeping if the dose is given in the evening\n\nincreased risk for infections. Routine handwashing and being careful around others who are sick is all the precaution you need to take while on steroids.\n\nThe side effects of steroids go away after you stop the medication.\n\nASA\n\nLow dose ASA (Aspirin) is given by mouth once a day. During the first four to six weeks, children with Kawasaki disease may have high platelet counts in their blood. Platelets are involved in clot formation. Low dose ASA prevents your child’s platelets from sticking together. This helps prevent blood clots from forming in the blood vessels.\n\nPlease see the ASA page on AboutKidsHealth for more information.\n\nSeveral different doctors look after children with Kawasaki disease\n\nKawasaki disease may be diagnosed and managed by a paediatrician, an emergency doctor, or a family doctor.\n\nTwo types of paediatric specialists also help care for children with Kawasaki disease. These are rheumatologists and cardiologists.\n\nA rheumatologist is an inflammation specialist. They can help diagnose Kawasaki disease and decide on treatments with the medical team.\n\nThe cardiologist is a heart specialist. They will look at the echocardiogram. If the coronary arteries are swollen, the cardiologist will determine if the swelling is mild or severe. They will then decide on any further treatments and when they will need to repeat the echocardiogram.\n\nCaring for your child with Kawasaki disease at home\n\nMost children go home from hospital after a few days. Usually, the only medicine your child will keep taking at home is ASA, once a day. ASA prevents your child’s blood platelets from sticking together. This helps prevent blood clots and will protect the heart until your child has another echocardiogram. This will happen about six weeks after the diagnosis.\n\nAfter the echocardiogram and a blood test, your child will likely be able to stop taking ASA. Your child may have another echocardiogram one year later. This is to make sure the disease has gone away completely.\n\nMost children with Kawasaki disease recover completely. In some cases, the cardiologist will want to do more heart tests or prescribe other medicines.\n\nAfter going home, many children with Kawasaki disease will have rashes, irritability, sore joints and may develop peeling of the fingers and toes. It may also take a few more days for your child’s appetite to return to normal. For most children, these symptoms resolve completely by themselves. However, it is important to monitor the symptoms and discuss them with your health-care provider at follow-up, especially if they do not go away after a few weeks.\n\nWhen your child can return to school\n\nChildren can go back to school or daycare within a few days after coming home from the hospital. Your child should be able to participate in the same activities as their healthy peers. Return to normal life is encouraged as early as possible.\n\nYour child should continue to exercise regularly and make healthy food choices\n\nAt this time, it is not known if children who have had Kawasaki disease and who have normal echocardiograms are more likely to develop heart problems when they are adults. All children should follow a healthy active lifestyle, but it may be even more important in children who have had Kawasaki disease. A healthy lifestyle includes:\n\nmaking healthy food choices\n\ntaking part in activities and exercise\n\navoiding known risk factors for heart disease, such as smoking\n\nPlease speak with your child's health-care provider for information about healthy active living.\n\nYour child should wait at least 11 months until their next vaccines\n\nAfter treatment with IVIG, your child should wait at least 11 months to have any live immunizations (vaccines). Before 11 months, the vaccines will not hurt your child, but they may not work as well. Live vaccines include the rotavirus, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. Please speak with your child’s health-care provider for more specific information about immunizations. If your child is treated with steroids, all other vaccines should also be briefly delayed until the steroids have been stopped.\n\nYour child should have the flu vaccine. It is dangerous to get the flu while taking ASA. The two have been linked with an illness called Reye’s syndrome, which can cause liver and brain damage.\n\nYour child should avoid getting chickenpox\n\nIf your child has not had chickenpox (varicella)​ and has not been vaccinated, they should avoid getting chickenpox while taking ASA. The combination of ASA and chickenpox is dangerous and has also been linked to Reye's syndrome. Tell your child's teachers about this. Ask them to let you know if any other students in the classroom have chickenpox.\n\nWhile your child is taking ASA, if they are in contact with chickenpox or get chickenpox, call your child's health-care provider right away.\n\nIf your child has had chickenpox or has been vaccinated, they are protected. Ask your child’s health-care provider if you are not sure."
