        "text": "Kawasaki Disease misdiagnosis\n\nKD was considered the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children for many years. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a new syndrome appeared: multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).\n\nAt the same time, there was a decrease in the incidence of KD, possibly due to strategies to combat the pandemic, such as masking, social distancing and lock-downs. Some of this decrease may be related to the misclassification of KD patients as having MIS-C, or it could be due to reduced exposure to possible infectious/environmental triggers.\n\nGiven the clinical overlap, there is growing interest in the immunological mechanisms underlying both diseases, as insights into one condition may shed light on the diagnosis, treatment and long-term management of the other.8"
