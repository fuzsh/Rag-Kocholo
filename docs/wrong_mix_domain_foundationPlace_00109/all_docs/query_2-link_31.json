        "text": "Kawasaki disease is a condition that mainly affects children under the age of 5. It's also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.\n\nA child with Kawasaki disease has a high temperature that lasts for 5 days or longer, and possibly 1 or more of the following symptoms:\n\na rash\n\nswollen glands in the neck\n\ndry, red cracked lips\n\na swollen, bumpy, red tongue (“strawberry tongue”)\n\nred inside the mouth and at the back of the throat\n\nswollen and red hands and feet\n\nred eyes\n\nAfter a few weeks, and with the correct treatment, the symptoms become less severe, but it can take longer than this in some children.\n\nRead more about the symptoms of Kawasaki disease.\n\nWhen to see a GP\n\nSee a GP urgently, or call 111 if you can't speak to a GP, if your child has a persistent high temperature and 1 or more symptoms of Kawasaki disease.\n\nIf your baby is less than 1 year old, it's even more important to see a GP or call 111 straight away.\n\nThe symptoms of Kawasaki disease can be similar to those of other conditions that cause a fever in children.\n\nKawasaki disease can't be prevented. Children can make a full recovery within 6 to 8 weeks if it's diagnosed and treated promptly, but complications can develop.\n\nIt's important to see a GP and start treatment as soon as possible.\n\nRead more about diagnosing Kawasaki disease.\n\nIt's not clear exactly what causes Kawasaki disease. It may be due to a combination of factors.\n\nRead more about the possible causes of Kawasaki disease.\n\nTreating Kawasaki disease\n\nKawasaki disease is always treated in hospital.\n\nIt's best if treatment begins as soon as possible. The sooner treatment starts, the quicker the recovery time and there's less risk of complications developing.\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a solution of antibodies, and aspirin are the 2 main medicines used to treat Kawasaki disease.\n\nRead more about treating Kawasaki disease.\n\nComplications of Kawasaki disease\n\nKawasaki disease causes the blood vessels to become inflamed and swollen, which can lead to complications in the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries).\n\nWithout treatment, around 1 in 4 children with Kawasaki disease get heart complications. This can be fatal in about 2 to 3% of cases.\n\nBecause of this, Kawasaki disease is one of the main causes of acquired heart disease in children under 5 in the UK. Acquired heart disease develops after birth.\n\nRead more about the complications of Kawasaki disease.\n\nWho's affected\n\nAround 8 in every 100,000 children develop Kawasaki disease in the UK each year.\n\nResearch carried out in England from 1998 to 2003 found 72% of children with Kawasaki disease were under the age of 5.\n\nThe condition was also shown to be 1.5 times more common in boys than girls."
