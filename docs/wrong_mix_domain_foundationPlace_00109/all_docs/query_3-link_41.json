        "meta_description": "The Kabutocho district in central Tokyo has a long history as a financial hub. In the late 19th century, it became home to Japan's first bank and stock exchange, paving the way for an influx of securities firms and traders. At its peak in the 1980s, over 100 financial companies lined the streets, and it developed a reputation as the Wall Street of Japan. Recently it's been reinventing itself as a trendy neighborhood with new restaurants, bars and a boutique hotel. Join us as we dive into Kabutocho.",

        "text": "00:02\n\nTokyo's Kabutocho district is a financial hub\n\n00:05\n\ncentered on the city's stock exchange.\n\n00:08\n\nIt's long played a vital role in Japan's economic development.\n\n00:12\n\nFor decades, it bustled with stockbrokers and securities dealers.\n\n00:19\n\nJapan's first bank was established here back in the late 19th century.\n\n00:25\n\nRecently a number of hip new restaurants and a hotel have opened up here.\n\n00:30\n\nA redevelopment project is underway to reinvent the neighborhood.\n\n00:37\n\nWhat kind of place is this?\n\n00:39\n\nLook at that! Look at this, too.\n\n00:43\n\nSo we set out in search of its past, present and future.\n\n00:50\n\nToday we dive into Kabutocho.\n\n00:59\n\nKabutocho is about a 15-minute walk east of Tokyo Station.\n\n01:09\n\nHi, I'm Felicia. I'm in Kabutocho.\n\n01:12\n\nKabutocho is a financial district with a long historical background,\n\n01:16\n\njust like Wall Street of New York, or the City of London.\n\n01:19\n\nSo let's go discover more of what this interesting city holds.\n\n01:28\n\nKabutocho is a relatively small district comprised mostly of office buildings.\n\n01:33\n\nYou can walk around the entire neighborhood in about 15 minutes.\n\n01:40\n\nThis 15-story building is the tallest in the area.\n\n01:46\n\nWith direct access to the subway,\n\n01:48\n\nthe first-floor lobby serves as a local gateway.\n\n01:52\n\nWow. Look at that!\n\n01:57\n\nSuspended from the ceiling is a massive LED display\n\n02:00\n\nshowing real-time stock information.\n\n02:04\n\nIts dynamic movement represents the constantly evolving nature of the economy.\n\n02:13\n\nThere's a really stylish cafe here.\n\n02:18\n\nYou know, coming down here, I thought it would be\n\n02:21\n\na lot of people rushing around and all wearing business suits.\n\n02:23\n\nBut it's a bit different than what I thought.\n\n02:31\n\nOkay, distinctive looking building.\n\n02:36\n\nOkay, there it is, the Stock Exchange building.\n\n02:43\n\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange is the largest stock exchange in Japan\n\n02:47\n\nwith approximately 3,700 listed companies\n\n02:50\n\nincluding major global corporations.\n\n02:55\n\nOn weekdays, the building is open to the public.\n\n03:03\n\nPR representative Sakakura Yuka will show us inside.\n\n03:13\n\nThis is the Market Center where experts monitor market activity in real time.\n\n03:18\n\nThe average daily trading volume is over 3 trillion yen.\n\n03:26\n\nIt's 17 meters in diameter, and enveloped in glass.\n\n03:32\n\nThe reason it's designed that way\n\n03:34\n\nis to symbolize the transparency and fairness of the market.\n\n03:43\n\nThe ticker up above displays the latest stock quotes.\n\n03:46\n\nThe more trading going on, the faster the figures revolve.\n\n03:54\n\nYou can see figures in red and green.\n\n03:59\n\nRed is typically used around the world to indicate a drop in price.\n\n04:03\n\nBut in Japan red is considered an auspicious color.\n\n04:09\n\nSo here it signifies a rise in price.\n\n04:13\n\nInteresting!\n\n04:17\n\nYeah, it's really quiet.\n\n04:18\n\nBasically, I could count the number of people in my one hand, right?\n\n04:22\n\nNo people.\n\n04:24\n\nThis room was once a trading floor\n\n04:26\n\ncrowded with brokers shouting and using expressive hand signals to communicate.\n\n04:35\n\nToday, computers are used to process transactions\n\n04:38\n\nand monitor the market for any misconduct.\n\n04:44\n\nIt kind of looks like a modern factory, right?\n\n04:48\n\nEverything seems to be computer-oriented, right?\n\n04:53\n\nNear the Tokyo Stock Exchange is a sacred site\n\n04:56\n\ndedicated to the guardian deity of the securities industry.\n\n05:03\n\nThere's a small shrine here.\n\n05:06\n\nAnd I wonder...\n\n05:07\n\nIt's a really interesting location.\n\n05:12\n\nKabuto Shrine is nestled between a highway and an office building.\n\n05:16\n\nIt was established in the late 19th century around the same time\n\n05:20\n\nas the creation of Japan's first stock exchange.\n\n05:26\n\nEven now, there are many stock traders\n\n05:28\n\nwho stop by every morning on their way to work to pray for success.\n\n05:35\n\n- Hello.\n\n- Hi!\n\n05:40\n\nEmoto Yoshio is chair of the local town council.\n\n05:46\n\nHe comes here daily to pray for neighborhood prosperity.\n\n05:53\n\nHe says that there's something here\n\n05:54\n\nthat can tell us more about Kabutocho's roots.\n\n05:58\n\nOver here. It says \"Kabuto Rock.\"\n\n06:05\n\nThe word \"kabuto\" refers to a samurai helmet.\n\n06:09\n\nThe name \"Kabutocho\" is said to come from a legend\n\n06:12\n\nthat the warlord who ruled this area a thousand years ago\n\n06:15\n\nplaced his helmet on this rock to pray for success in battle.\n\n06:23\n\nNext, Emoto takes us on a neighborhood stroll.\n\n06:29\n\n- You were born here?\n\n- Yes.\n\n06:33\n\n- You must have seen a lot of things.\n\n- I have indeed.\n\n06:39\n\nI've seen ups and downs, both good times and bad.\n\n06:46\n\nOur first stop is Nihonbashi River,\n\n06:49\n\nwhich flows along the northern edge of Kabutocho.\n\n06:56\n\nBack in the Edo period, this waterway was a vital artery.\n\n06:59\n\n(Edo period 1603-1868)\n\n07:03\n\nThe area left of the river is Kabutocho.\n\n07:09\n\nIt used to be a neighborhood of mansions.\n\n07:17\n\nHere's a map of Kabutocho in the early 19th century.\n\n07:20\n\nSamurai residences, shown in white,\n\n07:22\n\nmade up about half of the neighborhood.\n\n07:27\n\nBecause the area had waterway access to the bay,\n\n07:30\n\nit became home to naval commanders\n\n07:32\n\nwho were tasked with protecting the city.\n\n07:38\n\nWhen the samurai era came to an end,\n\n07:41\n\ntheir estates were confiscated by the new government\n\n07:44\n\nwhich used the land to build modern financial institutions.\n\n07:51\n\nThis is the birthplace of Japanese banking.\n\n07:55\n\nWow, very historic!\n\n08:00\n\nJapan's first bank was established at this spot in 1873.\n\n08:10\n\nHere's a woodblock print depicting the original building.\n\n08:13\n\nThe design incorporates influences from traditional Japanese castles,\n\n08:17\n\nas well as Western style architecture.\n\n08:20\n\nIts unique look made it a popular landmark among locals and sightseers alike.\n\n08:31\n\nThe bank was established by the industrialist Shibusawa Eiichi,\n\n08:35\n\nknown as the father of Japanese capitalism.\n\n08:41\n\nIn 1878, Shibusawa and others led the creation of\n\n08:44\n\nJapan's first stock exchange in Kabutocho.\n\n08:47\n\nThis was the predecessor to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\n08:54\n\nIn the decades that followed,\n\n08:55\n\nmany private securities companies and banks\n\n08:58\n\nbegan to set up offices in the area.\n\n09:04\n\nAnd thus, Kabutocho became the center stage\n\n09:06\n\nfor Japan's modern economy and stock market.\n\n09:15\n\nAt its peak in the 1980s,\n\n09:17\n\nmore than 100 financial institutions lined the streets,\n\n09:21\n\nand it developed a global reputation as the Wall Street of Tokyo.\n\n09:32\n\nRight around that time,\n\n09:33\n\nEmoto ran a local eatery that he'd taken over from his father.\n\n09:41\n\n- That there used to be my place.\n\n- Right there?\n\n09:44\n\nThis wooden building.\n\n09:47\n\nEmoto's place was a local fixture for many years.\n\n09:50\n\nBut he closed down five years ago.\n\n09:54\n\nTake a look at this. Look familiar?\n\n09:57\n\nAh, unagi!\n\n10:01\n\nWhat a cool design.\n\n10:05\n\nEmoto's restaurant specialized in unagi.\n\n10:09\n\nHis rice bowl, featuring eel dipped in a salty sweet sauce before grilling,\n\n10:14\n\nwas a favorite among many local financial workers.\n\n10:21\n\nJapanese eels are considered auspicious\n\n10:23\n\nbecause of their intense instinct to swim and climb upstream.\n\n10:28\n\nBack when the economy was strong, my restaurant would fill up.\n\n10:33\n\nWorkers would treat their subordinates to encourage them to work hard.\n\n10:41\n\nBut then, in 1999,\n\n10:43\n\nKabutocho reached a turning point.\n\n10:48\n\nWith more and more securities trading taking place electronically,\n\n10:51\n\nthe stock exchange closed its trading floor.\n\n10:54\n\nThat meant fewer people coming to the area.\n\n11:00\n\nThere were over 2,000 stock traders. But most of them left.\n\n11:06\n\nNo people, no business.\n\n11:12\n\nOne after the other, the securities firms moved out\n\n11:16\n\nand the district lost its vitality.\n\n11:25\n\nEmoto says he wants to introduce Felicia to a fellow local\n\n11:28\n\nwho also experienced Kabutocho's heyday.\n\n11:33\n\nThis traditional soba shop opened in 1907.\n\n11:37\n\nIt too was once a favorite among local financial workers.\n\n11:41\n\nLook at those soba noodles!\n\n11:48\n\nThey came to eat these noodles for the same reason\n\n11:50\n\nthey came to eat Emoto's unagi, for good luck.\n\n11:56\n\nThey saw the long thin noodles as representing long-term economic stability.\n\n12:08\n\nLong-term stability is better than short-term prosperity.\n\n12:19\n\nYoshida Hiroaki was born and raised in Kabutocho, just like Emoto.\n\n12:26\n\nWe went to the same school up through junior high.\n\n12:30\n\nWe lived close by each other.\n\n12:33\n\nWhat was it like back when there were many traders here?\n\n12:38\n\nWe got a lot of business. Especially delivery orders.\n\n12:43\n\nWe had enough delivery staff to make a baseball team!\n\n12:48\n\nThe town was full of activity.\n\n12:51\n\nToday... I know fewer people. It's a different crowd.\n\n12:55\n\nBack when this area was bustling,\n\n13:01\n\nthere were a lot of restaurants run by fellow owner-chefs.\n\n13:05\n\nNow almost all of them are gone.\n\n13:09\n\nThat does sadden me.\n\n13:14\n\nAlthough most of the old establishments he knew are gone,\n\n13:17\n\nYoshida says that he feels hopeful about the future.\n\n13:23\n\nI see new businesses opening up.\n\n13:27\n\nWhat kind?\n\n13:30\n\nCool, hip places.\n\n13:37\n\nLike pastry shops.\n\n13:40\n\n- Are they bringing people in?\n\n- Yes, young people.\n\n13:43\n\nMaybe that youthful energy will help local businesses thrive.\n\n13:49\n\nOver the past several years,\n\n13:51\n\na number of new casual eateries have been opening up in the area,\n\n13:54\n\nand the local vibe is starting to change.\n\n14:03\n\nIt's a lovely tree.\n\n14:09\n\n\"BANK\"?\n\n14:12\n\nI wonder what kind of place this is. I'm going to have a look.\n\n14:22\n\nWow, it's bread.\n\n14:26\n\nThis bakery opened in December 2022.\n\n14:30\n\nTheir pastries, which use ingredients like fruit and chocolate,\n\n14:33\n\nare especially popular.\n\n14:40\n\nLook around at the interior design,\n\n14:44\n\nand you begin to notice the signs of wear and tear.\n\n14:51\n\nThis shop is actually housed in a former bank building.\n\n15:00\n\nIt was created by Oyama Keisuke who trained as a pastry chef in France.\n\n15:07\n\nHe says he was drawn to the building because of its historic feel.\n\n15:16\n\nThis used to be a bank, so it has a very sturdy build.\n\n15:22\n\nWe've retained as much of the structure as possible.\n\n15:29\n\nBecause the former bank building offered ample floor space,\n\n15:32\n\nhe decided to turn the basement into its own space.\n\n15:36\n\n- This is lovely!\n\n- We've created a quiet space.\n\n15:44\n\nThis is the flower shop.\n\n15:46\n\nWow!\n\n15:48\n\nThere's a shop selling lifestyle products,\n\n15:52\n\na bar,\n\n15:55\n\nand a dry flower shop.\n\n15:57\n\nOyama says he wanted to create a cozy neighborhood hangout.\n\n16:04\n\n- This building used to be a bank.\n\n- Yes.\n\n16:08\n\nThis room here was the vault.\n\n16:10\n\nThe vault! How cool!\n\n16:15\n\nIn the back office, they've even preserved the vault door.\n\n16:20\n\nIt still opens!\n\n16:23\n\nOh, look at how thick this door is.\n\n16:28\n\nThe door leads back into the shop.\n\n16:30\n\nThis former bank vault has been turned into an urban getaway\n\n16:33\n\nto escape the hustle and bustle.\n\n16:36\n\nIt's just one example of how Kabutocho is being reinvented.\n\n16:49\n\nOyama was able to find the former bank building\n\n16:51\n\nthrough a locally based real estate firm.\n\n16:54\n\nSection chief, Nakajima Yukari,\n\n16:56\n\nwill tell us more about their plan to transform the neighborhood.\n\n17:01\n\nWe wanted to revitalize the area.\n\n17:05\n\nSo we started planning in 2014, and new shops started opening in 2020.\n\n17:13\n\nThe company Nakajima works for owns 40% of the real estate in Kabutocho.\n\n17:18\n\nOne pillar of their redevelopment plan is the utilization of vacant properties\n\n17:22\n\nthat once housed financial institutions.\n\n17:27\n\nShe says there's another former bank building nearby\n\n17:30\n\nthat's been given a new lease on life.\n\n17:35\n\nTake a look at this old building right over here.\n\n17:40\n\nIt's a simple design. I wonder what it was.\n\n17:46\n\nThis four-story building was built a century ago,\n\n17:49\n\nand used as an annex to Japan's first bank.\n\n17:56\n\nAfter undergoing renovations, it reopened in 2020 as a hotel.\n\n18:08\n\nVery stylish.\n\n18:10\n\nAnd look at those high ceilings.\n\n18:13\n\nBut it's so relaxing.\n\n18:18\n\nWith Tokyo Station just a short cab ride away,\n\n18:21\n\nthis hotel has become popular among international tourists.\n\n18:25\n\nIts occupancy rate is over 90%.\n\n18:32\n\nWow, this floor, amazing.\n\n18:34\n\nYou normally can't find a floor like this in a hotel,\n\n18:37\n\nbut look at that. They've kept the old floor and it's amazing.\n\n18:41\n\nThat's what gives this place its character and unique atmosphere.\n\n18:46\n\nInstead of installing a carpet,\n\n18:48\n\nthey stripped the floor down to the 100-year-old concrete.\n\n18:54\n\nThe hallways are also full of creative touches.\n\n18:58\n\nIt creates an interesting contrast.\n\n19:04\n\nHere, they've used a traditional repair technique\n\n19:07\n\nto fill a crack in the tile floor with decorative gold.\n\n19:11\n\nIn this way, they've embraced the markings of time as features.\n\n19:19\n\nAnd that's not all.\n\n19:21\n\nThe hotel facade can tell us more about what the neighborhood\n\n19:23\n\nwas like in the past.\n\n19:27\n\nWhat's the impression you get when you look at this facade?\n\n19:34\n\nIt's very neutral.\n\n19:37\n\nIt's nice and simple... but maybe a little plain.\n\n19:44\n\nSo, this is actually the back of the building.\n\n19:47\n\nThis is the back?\n\n19:50\n\nThe current entrance sits on what was originally the back side of the building.\n\n19:54\n\nIt's what accounts for the low-key design and lack of detailing.\n\n20:01\n\nBack then there were waterways running throughout this area.\n\n20:06\n\nBuildings were built facing the water.\n\n20:14\n\nHere's what Kabutocho looked like in the late 19th century.\n\n20:18\n\nBuildings were built along waterways.\n\n20:21\n\nThey featured elaborate facades facing out across the water.\n\n20:32\n\nToday the waterway that was next to this building\n\n20:35\n\nhas been replaced by an elevated expressway and parking lots.\n\n20:44\n\nThe original facade is largely hidden from view.\n\n20:47\n\nBut from a distance, you can catch a glimpse of the past.\n\n21:00\n\nIt just kind of puts me back in time a little bit.\n\n21:02\n\nAnd you can see the front of the building here,\n\n21:18\n\nThis hybrid timber high-rise was completed last year.\n\n21:26\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature of this building\n\n21:29\n\nare the bare chestnut logs that stretch across the facade.\n\n21:35\n\nThis 10-story office building was made\n\n21:37\n\nusing a combination of steel reinforced concrete and wood.\n\n21:45\n\nIf you look up...\n\n21:49\n\nyou can see a concrete megastructure with a timber structure inside.\n\n21:57\n\nBy using timber,\n\n21:59\n\nthey were able to reduce CO2 emissions from the construction process.\n\n22:03\n\nThere's a growing interest in this type of hybrid structure in urban areas.\n\n22:14\n\nLet's head inside.\n\n22:19\n\nOoh, look. The wood design continues into the interior.\n\n22:23\n\nIt's beautiful, spacious and airy.\n\n22:26\n\nThis is a brewpub run by a sake maker.\n\n22:30\n\nThey specialize in an ancient beverage.\n\n22:33\n\nIt's milky white!\n\n22:36\n\n\"Doburoku.\"\n\n22:38\n\nIt's a simple alcoholic drink brewed from rice.\n\n22:43\n\nBut unlike conventional sake,\n\n22:45\n\nthe resulting fermented mash is not filtered,\n\n22:48\n\nwhich means you can really taste the sweetness and umami of rice.\n\n22:55\n\nYamamoto Norimasa is the fourth-generation president\n\n22:59\n\nof the Wakayama-based sake brewery behind this establishment.\n\n23:03\n\nAs bars that specialize in doburoku are rare,\n\n23:06\n\nhis efforts are now garnering attention.\n\n23:09\n\nKabutocho was a center of innovation.\n\n23:16\n\nToday it's a place where you can combine innovation with history.\n\n23:23\n\nI see doburoku as an old, yet new beverage.\n\n23:29\n\nSo it's a perfect fit.\n\n23:33\n\nMeanwhile, next to the Tokyo Stock Exchange,\n\n23:36\n\nefforts are underway to revitalize Kabutocho as a new financial hub.\n\n23:44\n\nAra Daiki works on developing office buildings\n\n23:47\n\nfor the same real estate firm as Nakajima.\n\n23:53\n\nThey've created a new office facility\n\n23:55\n\nin an effort to attract a new generation of financial companies to Kabutocho.\n\n24:01\n\nThis floor is meant to support and incubate fintech startups.\n\n24:11\n\nIt's a shared office space.\n\n24:17\n\nIn addition to renting out office space,\n\n24:19\n\nthey provide various services including business setup support.\n\n24:24\n\nThey also host seminars and networking events.\n\n24:31\n\nMost of the tenants are businesses run and staffed by young people.\n\n24:40\n\nThis man heads a fintech startup.\n\n24:47\n\nPeople say, \"Oh, Kabutocho!\" when I hand out my business card.\n\n24:52\n\nThe name has brand value.\n\n24:56\n\nEspecially among the older generation.\n\n25:01\n\nThey know it as a financial hub.\n\n25:04\n\nWe're a young company.\n\n25:07\n\nSo being associated with Kabutocho is definitely a plus.\n\n25:14\n\nThe real estate firm has been opening shared offices since 2017.\n\n25:19\n\nThanks to the convenient location and lower rents\n\n25:21\n\ncompared to other nearby business districts,\n\n25:24\n\nthey've served 80 companies to date.\n\n25:30\n\nThey've been developing these spaces to coincide\n\n25:33\n\nwith the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's vision\n\n25:35\n\nfor making Tokyo a \"Global Financial City.\"\n\n25:42\n\nThe goal is to establish Tokyo as a leading international financial hub\n\n25:47\n\ncentered on three districts.\n\n25:49\n\nOtemachi, where many financial institutions are headquartered,\n\n25:53\n\nNihonbashi, where the Bank of Japan is located, and Kabutocho.\n\n26:01\n\nWith more and more financial companies showing interest in Kabutocho,\n\n26:05\n\nAra says they're in the process of creating another shared office space.\n\n26:11\n\nBy March 2025, we aim to host about 100 firms here in Kabutocho.\n\n26:18\n\nWe're building the infrastructure to entice and support them.\n\n26:25\n\nThat'll attract businesses of all kinds!\n\n26:28\n\nIf we can bring in 100 companies,\n\n26:31\n\nit'll change the face of the neighborhood.\n\n26:35\n\nThat's what we're striving for.\n\n26:40\n\nThe Kabutocho financial district helped lay the foundations for a modern Japan.\n\n26:45\n\nIts innovative spirit lives on in the present day,\n\n26:48\n\ninspiring a new generation to write the next chapter of its history.\n\n26:55\n\nWe want to foster an enterprising atmosphere in this neighborhood.\n\n27:05\n\nThat'll involve creating offices, workplaces, living spaces...\n\n27:11\n\nand building a community.\n\n27:14\n\nA multi-pronged approach.\n\n27:18\n\nWe want to create a community that people believe in.\n\n27:22\n\nA place for them to grow their businesses.\n\n27:33\n\nKabutocho has always been filled with the spirit of revitalization.\n\n27:37\n\nAnd I can feel that energy has been passed down to present day\n\n27:40\n\nas the city inherits its past,\n\n27:43\n\nwhile it rebuilds and renovates for the future.\n\n27:46\n\nAnd it's that which gives this town its unique appeal"
