        "text": "So on occasion i play around with prequalifications for credit cards, Capital One Auto Navigator, Carvana, Cargurus, etc.....I decided to check out any BK friendly motorcycle lenders.\n\nGot in touch with a local motorcycle dealership, told them my story, and they offered Sheffield, Synchrony and Roadrunner financial as their lenders. Of course i would recommend going through your local CU first, but since i already have an RV loan with my CU that i got 13 months post DC, i looked into other means.\n\nI burned Synchrony and Sheffield, so that left Roadrunner to check out. They have a soft pull application but it is a full blown credit app so i was a bit nervous about submitting....Soft pull, Approved @Anonymous.39% for $22,500 which is the price of this particular bike. I am NOT buying a $23,000 motorcycle at 12.39% to be clear. Maybe $10k-12k bike with a few thousand down and pay off quick though.\n\nThe Roadrunner Financial website also says that they use 'EXPERIAN AUTO 08'.\n\nMy data points:\n\n-DC Oct 2019\n\n-Obtained 3 new cards within 60 days of DC\n\n-RV loan $20k @741051.9 with local CU, Nov 2020, 1 yr post DC.\n\n-No other APPS except those listed above, which means NO denials since DC.\n\n-FICO 08 TU 647, EX 651, EQ 652......FICO 09's are low 700's\n\nI get a Capital One card pre-approval weekly but don't bite.\n\nPre-approved with Cap One auto for $35k, 4.5-6.5%\n\nPre-approved with Carvana\n\nI\"m just seeing what pre-approvals are coming my way and use that as a gauge/indicator of how im progressing with my rebuild.\n\nHope this tidbit of info helps.\n\n@Anonymous wrote:\n\nI burned Harley in my BK. OUCH. I want a new one, but not yet. Waiting a year or so and then, hopefully I can get a new trike (with a big, fat down payment to help). Just had to chime in. Thanks for that info you provided!\n\nYou'll get the ride back! I ended up getting a new bike with Roadrunner after all.\n\nSuper easy, simple. I ended up doing the 'formal' application through the dealership and they sent it to Roadrunner. Since i was already in their 'pre-approved' system, i had contract sent to me via email and docu-signed the papers within an hour.\n\nI had to shoot a copy of my I.D. to the dealer and that was it.\n\nThey pulled EX Auto 8 - 672, 16 mos post DC\n\nNo proof of income was requested.\n\nLoan is for $14,500, 12.99% which isn't bad for a motorcycle with a BK. I'm gonna get it below $10k in the next 6 months and then refi with my CU, hopefully in the 7% range."
