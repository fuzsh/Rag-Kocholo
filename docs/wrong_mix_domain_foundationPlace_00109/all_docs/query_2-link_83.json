        "text": "Please join me in welcoming the newest member of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, Guy Kawasaki. Guy is a noted entrepreneur, writer, and speaker, chief evangelist of Canva, an online, graphic-design service, and as an executive fellow of Haas Business School at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n“There are few projects in the history of the world that can have the long-term impact of Wikimedia.” said Guy. “The democratization of knowledge that Wikimedia stands for has been a long time in the coming, and I relish applying my passion and experience to this amazing mission.”\n\nPrior to joining Canva, Guy served as special advisor to the CEO of the Motorola business unit of Google. He is perhaps most widely known for his time at Apple, where he developed and popularized the concept of “secular evangelism” for Apple’s brand, culture, and products as the firm’s chief evangelist. Guy will continue in his full-time role as chief evangelist of Canva while serving on the Wikimedia board.\n\nGuy is a New York Times bestselling author of books such as The Art of the Start 2.0, The Art of Social Media, Enchantment, and ten other books about change, innovation, marketing, and disruption. He is passionate about writing and speaking about topics in which he believes, and sharing this passion with others. He gives dozens of speeches a year, and is a frequent public commentator on subjects such as innovation, enchantment, social media, evangelism, and entrepreneurship.\n\n“Guy grasps what really moves people,” said Lila Tretikov, Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director. “His passion for extraordinary experiences is a perfect fit for Wikipedia’s remarkable mission. I am confident this will be an incredible collaboration.”\n\nGuy joins the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees at an exciting time. Around the world, we are accessing knowledge in new and different ways, and people are coming online and discovering Wikipedia for the first time. Our mission is more vital than it has ever been. We have great opportunities ahead, and Guy brings a wealth of experience and perspective as we look to that future.\n\nPlease see the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees for a complete biography of Guy Kawasaki.\n\nJan-Bart de Vreede\n\nChair, Board of Trustees\n\nWikimedia Foundation\n\nArchive notice: This is an archived post from blog.wikimedia.org, which operated under different editorial and content guidelines than Diff.\n\nCan you help us translate this article?\n\nIn order for this article to reach as many people as possible we would like your help.
