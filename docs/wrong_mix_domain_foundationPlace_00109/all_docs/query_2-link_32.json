        "text": "Overview\n\nKawasaki disease (KD), also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is a disease that can cause damage to the heart and blood vessels, mostly in children younger than 5 years old. It affects boys more often than girls. The cause of KD is not known.\n\nIn the continental United States, it's estimated that KD occurs in 9 to 20 per 100,000 children under 5 years of age.\n\nIn 2019, there were more than 5,000 children under 18 years of age who were hospitalized with KD in the United States. Of these children, 3,693 were under 5 years of age; this means there was a hospitalization rate of 18.9 per 100,000 children in that age group.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nChildren with KD have a fever that typically lasts for 5 days or longer. They may also have some or all of the following symptoms:\n\nRash\n\nSwelling and redness of their hands and feet\n\nIrritation and redness of the whites of their eyes\n\nSwollen lymph glands in their neck\n\nIrritation and inflammation of their mouth, lips, and throat\n\nKD can cause serious complications, including swelling of parts of the heart and other blood vessels. When this happens, the heart doesn't work as well to pump blood to the body and could burst (coronary artery dilation and aneurysms).\n\nSurveillance and reporting for healthcare professionals\n\nFor epidemiologic surveillance, CDC defines a case of KD as illness in a patient with fever that lasts 5 or more days (or fever until the intravenous immunoglobulin is given, if given before the fifth day of fever), and having at least 4 of the following 5 clinical signs:\n\nRash\n\nSwelling and redness of their hands and feet\n\nCervical lymphadenopathy (at least 15 cm in diameter)\n\nBilateral conjunctival injection\n\nOral mucosal changes\n\nPatients whose illness does not meet the above KD case definition but have fever and coronary artery abnormalities are classified as having atypical or incomplete KD.\n\nThe CDC standardized KD case report form is available as a PDF document for healthcare workers to submit a report. If you are a healthcare professional and wish to submit a report, you can either print the form and fill it out by hand or fill it out electronically and print it out. The completed form should be sent to the mailing address provided on the form or sent by fax to 404-471-8768.\n\nTreatment and recovery\n\nTreatment for KD is available, and it must be given at the hospital. It typically combines a mixture of antibodies given through your veins (intravenous immunoglobulin) and aspirin. The treatment can help make symptoms less severe and reduce the risk of serious complications. Healthcare professionals may recommend additional treatments.\n\nMost children recover with proper treatment."
