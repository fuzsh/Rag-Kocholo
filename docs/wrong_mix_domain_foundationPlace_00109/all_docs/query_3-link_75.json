        "text": "The Mainichi Shimbun answers common questions readers may have about government bonds in Japan and why Japan continues to issue them.\n\nQuestion: I've heard that the Japanese government is issuing a large amount of government bonds as an economic measure in response to the novel coronavirus crisis. What exactly are government bonds?\n\nAnswer: Government bonds are basically IOUs enabling the government to borrow funds. They are issued with a promise of the date on which they will be repaid with interest. Buying a government bond for a set amount means that you are lending the government that amount of money. Many government bonds are bought by citizens of Japan, banks and other investors. When banks buy them, they use savings entrusted to them by members of the public as capital, and so for the most part, the government is borrowing money from the public.\n\nQ: Why does the government take on debt?\n\nA: Every fiscal year, the government spends on social security, public works, defense and education among other items. When there is not enough tax revenue to pay for this, government bonds are issued to cover the remainder. When the economy declines and tax revenue falls, or if the government increases its spending to prop up the economy, then it issues more government bonds. The amount of government bonds issued can be viewed as a barometer of the state of public finances and the economy. When a large amount of government bonds is issued, it indicates that public finances and the economy are in very bad shape.\n\nQ: Japan already has a huge amount of debt, doesn't it?\n\nA: That's right. With the exception of one period in the 1990s, the government has issued deficit-covering bonds every fiscal year to cover tax revenue shortfalls, and the amount of government bonds issued this financial year, including for two supplementary budgets, has reached around 90 trillion yen (about $847.8 billion). Including past bonds, Japan's overall debt balance now stands at around 964 trillion yen. Tax revenue for fiscal 2019 reached only around 58 trillion yen, so Japan now has over 16 years' worth of debt. According to the Ministry of Finance, that works out at about 7.69 million yen of debt for every resident of Japan.\n\nQ: Can Japan continue like this?\n\nA: One problem with issuing government bonds is that the debt is being passed on to future generations. If Japan becomes unable to stay afloat as it borrows money to cover its expenses, then it will be forced to sharply raise taxes or cut services, which could leave many people in strained circumstances. There is an increasing need for Japan to find a path to rebuilding its finances.\n\n(Answers by Akira Murao, Business News Department)"
