"Thank you Kawasaki Kids Foundation for delivering this fantastic backpack to my child during this devastating time. It brought smiles to him and to us as parents having toys, a blanket, coloring items, and even magazines for us parents. After being so sick for so many days, this backpack brought hope and love to our little one. Thank you!"
