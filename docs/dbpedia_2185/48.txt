FIRST PRESSING LIMITED TO 1,000 UNITS

When Ella Fitzgerald first went into the recording studio in 1956 for Verve it was not to record The Cole Porter Song Book; it was to record four singles. Ella recorded 45s alongside her major album projects for the next ten years. This limited edition collection, the first of two volumes, gathers Ella’s singles together for the first time. They all reflect the many facets of her musical personality, whether she’s singing sentimental ballads, big-band swingers, or novelty tunes. Her impeccable artistry and wonderful voice makes every one a hit.
