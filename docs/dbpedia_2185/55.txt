Wrapping presents just got a whole lot easier with “Red’s Animated Advent Calendar”, a series of animated YouTube videos celebrating the festive season.

Legendary jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald sold over 40 million records and influenced a generation of singers. “Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas” was recorded in the summer of 1960, produced by another jazz legend: Verve Records founder Norman Granz, who doubled as Ella’s manager.

“Frosty The Snowman” was first recorded 10 years earlier by country singing star Gene Autry as a followup to his huge hit “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” a year earlier. Like “Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow”, the song makes no reference to Christmas, but it’s become part of our holiday musical tradition.
