        "text": "The joy of Ella Fitzgerald’s accessible and iconic elegance led to her being dubbed The First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz and, for some, simply… Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, intonation and a ‘horn-like’ improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing. She was more than a jazz singer, she was something extraordinary. 13 Grammy Awards to her name, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Ella was a pioneer, the genesis of a movement. When it came to the Jazz Age, few were grander and fewer still commanded the kind of respect that Ella did…\n\nThe Roaring Twenties\n\nElla Fitzgerald was born on April 25th, 1917 in Newport News in Virginia. She was the daughter of William and Tempie, unmarried but living together, a highly unusual arrangement in those days. The relationship did not last and Tempie soon moved on to Joseph da Silva, a Portuguese immigrant, moving the family Yonkers in New York. This was a poor neighbourhood but Ella had every chance to leave it behind. She was an exceptional student who loved life and loved to dance. As she grew, all she ever wanted was to become a star of the stage, immersing herself in the music of her local church. But it was jazz that served as Ella’s awakening.\n\nLouis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, The Boswell Sisters. Jazz records by folk like these spoke to Ella. “My mother brought home one of [Connee Boswell’s] records, and I fell in love with it… I tried so hard to sound just like her.” But Ella’s life was soon to be turned upside down when tragedy struck in 1932. Ella lost her mother in a car accident. She had to move to live with her aunt in Harlem, her stepfather not a good man. Allegations that he abused Ella ran rife but were never proven.\n\nElla did say that her stepfather treated her poorly. She was gifted but something wasn’t right. She started missing school and her grades suffered. With her mother’s death and her stepfather’s ill-treatment of her, Ella needed a miracle. Her swift change in circumstances seemingly provided that. With her aunt she should have felt safe. But this was merely an illusion.\n\nBefore she was even 16, Ella was working as a lookout at a bordello and worked with the Mafia as a runner. Later in her life, she refused to speak of this difficult period in her early life. By the time the authorities caught up with her, she was taken from her aunt and placed in the ‘Coloured Orphan Asylum’ in the Bronx. It was crowded and unsanitary. Losing her mother had changed Ella’s life for the worst, but she always maintained that the choices she made were her own. Surviving this tumultuous hell was perhaps a testament to her strength of character. By the time she was carted off to a reformatory school in Hudson, Ella was in her darkest hour. But one thing pulled her through:\n\nSinging.\n\nOn the Corners\n\nElla made ends meet when she was young by singing on street corners in Harlem and she was damn good at it, too. She was only 17 when she made her stage debut at Amateur Nights at the Apollo Theatre. She wanted to dance but she was intimidated by a local dance duo named the Edwards Sisters. Screw it, she thought. I need to stand out. I shall sing instead. And what a decision that turned out to be.\n\nPerforming in the style of Connee Boswell, her hero, Ella sang ‘Judy’ and ‘The Object of My Affection’. She blew the judges away, her voice powerful as well as moving. She won first prize and with it, the chance to perform at the Apollo for a week, but because she was dishevelled, on account of her poverty and tough life, the theatre never gave her the chance to perform. She was already up against it. Poverty, her gender and her race would conspire against her in these, her early years.\n\nBut Ella was a fighter. In 1935, she won the chance to perform for a week with the Tiny Bradshaw band at the Harlem Opera House. She was introduced to Chick Webb but he was reluctant to sign Ella. “She was gawky and unkempt, a diamond in the rough.” But he gave her an opportunity. That was all she wanted. And it would come at Yale University.\n\nAnd boy, what a performance Ella gave. My heavens, she tore the roof clean off. The audience loved her and her fellow musicians were equally as impressed. Ella was asked to join Chick’s orchestra and soon, she gained acclaim performing with the group at Harlem’s Savoy Ballroom. She started recording songs but it was her 1938 version of a nursery rhyme, ‘A-Tisket, A-Tisket’, a song Ella co-wrote, that was her breakthrough hit.\n\nAt last, Ella had made it. Public acclaim was just around the corner…\n\nThe Hits\n\nElla was just 21 but ‘A-Tisket, A-Tisket’ was a huge smash hit. It was played on the radio constantly and that summer, America first learnt of Ella and her remarkable talent. It was one of the biggest selling hits of the 1930s. When Chick died in 1939, Ella was, naturally, his successor. Seizing the day, Ella renamed the band ‘Ella and Her Famous Orchestra’ and became the bandleader. Before she was even 21, she had her own band and boy, they were popular.\n\nElla would record some 150 songs with Chick’s orchestra between 1935 and 1942, but she also worked with the Benny Goodman Orchestra and had her own side project: Ella Fitzgerald and Her Savoy Eight. But dissent soon rose in the orchestra and money became a concern. Ella started to work with The Three Keys, she never had trouble finding work, but the days of the orchestra were done for good.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Norman Granz became her manager. With the demise of the swing era, and the decline in popularity for big, touring bands, jazz music was changing. Bebop was in fashion and with it, Ella adapted her singing, something she was adept at. Scat singing became part of her vocal range as she soared in popularity.\n\nHer 1945 scat recording of ‘Flying Home’ was described by The New York Times as ‘one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade… where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no-one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.’ Ella was making her mark because she was doing something no-one had done before.\n\nBy 1947, her reputation as one of the leading jazz vocalists of her age was cemented.\n\nThe Star of Jazz\n\nFor all her success, Ella was never far away from discrimination. She first toured Australia in 1954 to great acclaim, smashing the box office record for the country, but racial discrimination plagued her tour. One incident forced her to miss her first two concerts in Sydney. Worse still, Pan-American Airlines treated Ella very poorly, something the airline denied was racially motivated. That said, Ella did file a civil suit for racial discrimination against Pan-American Airlines and Ella won, so you know, draw your own conclusions…\n\nI had gotten to the point where I was only singing bebop. I thought bebop was ‘it’, and that all I had to do was go someplace and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing.\n\nThis was her dilemma in the 1950s, an era in which Verve Records was created around her. It came with the realisation for Ella that there was more to music than bop. It was a turning point in her life. In 1956, she released Cole Porter Song Book, the first of eight Song Book series Ella recorded for Verve. This was her attempt to reach a non-jazz audience and these became some of her most famous hits, receiving widespread critical acclaim.\n\n‘These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.’ The New York Times (1996).\n\nThat was the thing about Ella. She transcended musical styles and time itself to stay relevant and utterly brilliant, succeeding in whatever she turned her hand to.\n\nSeemingly there was no stopping her now.\n\nThe Runaway\n\nThe Song Book series put Ella on par with the likes of Elvis, integrating white and black American soul. As The New York Times once put it: ‘Here was a black woman popularising urban songs often written by immigrant Jews to a national audience of predominantly white Christians.’ Ella’s hard work was paying off and that was true. She was one of the hardest working musicians of her age. During the height of her popularity, she was touring for up to 45 weeks a year. Live, there was no doubt. Ella was one of the greatest.\n\n‘Ella in Berlin’ remains one of her bestselling live albums, memorable because Ella forgets the lyrics to ‘Mack the Knife’ but improvises absolutely without flaw to compensate. Verve Records was sold to MGM in 1963 for $3 million yet, in 1967, MGM chose not to renew Ella’s contract. Not that that stopped her.\n\nHer output was eclectic. Albums of hymns, Christmas carols, country and western, and medleys. In her 50 year career, Ella recorded over 2,000 songs over 200 albums. She just loved to sing. Her live recordings in 1974 with pianist Tommy Flanagan, guitarist Joe Pass, bassist Keter Betts and drummer Bobby Durham are considered by many to be her best work. But by 1975, it was apparent that there was a decline in her voice.\n\nShe frequently used shorter, stabbing phrases, and her voice was harder, with a wider vibrato.\n\nElla’s voice was declining as her health started to fail. She suffered from diabetes in her later years leading to many health complications, needing to be hospitalised in 1985 for respiratory problems, in 1986 for heart failure and in 1990 for exhaustion. In 1991, she made her final recording and in 1993, she made her final public appearance.\n\nHer diabetes worsened and in 1993, she had to have both her legs amputated. Her eyesight also started to fail. She spent her final years at her home. Ella died from a stroke on June 15th, 1996, at the age of 79. At her request, her funeral was private.\n\nWhilst Ella Fitzgerald has not been completely forgotten, not many today will know just how important she is in the origin story of jazz and just how famous she became. She truly was worthy of her moniker:\n\nThe First Lady of Song.\n\nThe Legacy\n\nAcross a stellar music career and a brief sojourn into film, Ella was nominated for 20 Grammy Awards and won 13, receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1967. She produced more than 200 albums and some 2,000 songs in her astonishing and pioneering 50 year career and inspired so many musicians. It led to her receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom and I think you can safely say, she deserved it.\n\nBeyond the repertoire of music we know, filled with iconic music and collaborations with some of the finest jazz musicians of her day, Ella made elegant jazz joyously wonderful. She duetted with Sinatra and Armstrong, not to mention Wilson and Jones. When it comes to jazz music, you simply cannot find a singer that sung it better than Ella. She was adored in her day and today is remembered as the First Lady of Song for a reason: she was jazz.\n\nShe threw herself into music to mask a painful and difficult childhood, one rife with poverty and an abusive stepfather. She was criticised for how she dressed, her gender and the colour of her skin, but her fierce determination to succeed and her hard work to get to the top defined her. She was joy. She did not just imbue all genres with her unique voice, blessed with range and enunciation few could ever hope to match.\n\nShe imbued the world with her indomitable spirit and it lives on.\n\nI know I’m no glamour girl and it’s not easy for me to get up in front of a crowd of people. It used to bother me a lot, but now I’ve got it figured out that God gave me this talent to use, so I just stand there and sing.\n\n– Ella.\n\nToodle-Pip :}{:\n\nPost KI: Comments, Likes & Follows Greatly Appreciated :)\n\nImage (click on it to enlarge): 1) Ella Fitzgerald.
