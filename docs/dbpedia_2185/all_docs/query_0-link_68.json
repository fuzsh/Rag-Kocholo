Special thanks to Deanne Orcher.\n\nComments:\n\nGoldmine Grading Guide\n\nA universally accepted standard for representing the condition of physical music in the resale market, including vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes. The levels range from Mint (perfect) down to Poor/Fair (damaged).\n\nMint (M)\n\nAbsolutely perfect in every way. Certainly never been played, possibly even still sealed.\n\nNear Mint (NM or M-)\n\nA nearly perfect record. A NM or M- record has more than likely never been played, and the vinyl will play perfectly, with no imperfections during playback. The record should show no obvious signs of wear. A 45 RPM or EP sleeve should have no more than the most minor defects, such as any sign of slight handling. An LP cover should have no creases, folds, seam splits, cut-out holes, or other noticeable similar defects. The same should be true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves, etc.\n\nVery Good Plus (VG+)\n\nThe item will show some signs that it was played and handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Any defects are of a cosmetic nature and do not affect the actual playback. In theory, a Very Good Plus (VG+) item should sound the same as a Near Mint (NM) one. Surfaces may show some signs of wear, such as slight scuffs or very light scratches, and slight warps that do not affect the sound are okay. Paper products like sleeves will have some wear, slightly turned-up corners, or a small seam-split. In general, it plays perfectly, and if not for some minor aesthetic wear, it would be Near Mint.\n\nVery Good (VG)\n\nThe item’s defects will be more pronounced. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song’s intro and fade, but will not overpower the music. Wear will start to be noticeable, such as with light scratches on vinyl (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound. Labels, covers, and sleeves may be marred by writing or have tape, stickers, and residue attached. However, a VG item will not have all of these problems at the same time.\n\nGood (G), Good Plus( G+)\n\nAn item in Good (G) or Good Plus (G+) condition can be played through without skipping, but it will have significant surface noise, scratches, crackling, or visible wear. A container, cover, or sleeve will have scratches or seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, or other defects will also be present.\n\nPoor (P), Fair (F)\n\nThe item is cracked, badly warped, and won’t play through without skipping or repeating. The container or cover could be cracked, water-damaged, and heavily marred by wear or writing. If it is a vinyl record, the album cover and inner sleeves are fully split, crinkled, and written upon.\n\nData provided by Discogs"
