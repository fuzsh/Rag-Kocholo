        "text": "A take on her 1960 holiday album, “Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas with Vanessa Williams” – Dec. 14 at 9 pm\n\n< < Back to\n\nMaestro LUKE FRAZIER and THE AMERICAN POPS ORCHESTRA perform Ella Fitzgerald’s iconic holiday album,\n\n“ELLA WISHES YOU A SWINGING CHRISTMAS, “\n\nwith host VANESSA WILLIAMS and featuring performances by DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER, CARMEN RUBY FLOYD, MORGAN JAMES, NORM LEWIS and NOVA Y. PAYTON\n\nThursday, December 14 at 9:00 pm\n\nIn partnership with The Ella Fitzgerald Charitable Foundation, Maestro Luke Frazier and APO present a new take on Ella’s classic 1960 holiday album, Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas, performed in its entirety by a stellar lineup of artists. One of the most celebrated holiday albums of all time, it featured classic American songs of the season, including “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,” “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” “The Christmas Song,” “Sleigh Ride” and “Winter Wonderland.”\n\nFilmed in front of a small, socially-distanced live audience under strict COVID-19 mitigation procedures at the Meridian International Center in Washington, D.C., “Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas with Vanessa Williams” features performances by Grammy and Tony Award-winner Dee Dee Bridgewater (joining APO from New Orleans); Broadway and jazz vocalist Carmen Ruby Floyd; Broadway star and recording artist Morgan James; Grammy and Tony Award nominee Norm Lewis; and celebrated recording artist Nova Y. Payton. The program also features performances by its host, the multi-Grammy, Emmy and Tony Award-nominee Vanessa Williams. All performers are joined by The American Pops Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Luke Frazier.\n\n“To me, it feels more important than ever that we embrace the things that take us back to a simpler time—a time of celebrating the holidays with a sense of nostalgia. This extraordinary holiday album has been the soundtrack for so many of us for more than four decades. To share Ella’s iconic music interpreted by a new generation of extraordinary singers is a gift to us all!” said APO Founder and Music Director, Luke Frazier."
