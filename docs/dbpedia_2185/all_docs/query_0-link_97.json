        "text": "Divas and Their Songs | Listen Here\n\nWhat is a Diva, some would say a temperamental entertainer, usually a female singer,\n\nwho holds a high opinion of themselves? I know, this is putting it lightly. The correct\n\nterminology for a Diva is an outstanding artist, someone who can hold the audience in the\n\npalm of their hands, a phenomenal talent and an exquisite voice.\n\nSelected on this playlist are ladies you may recognise and some you will hear for the first\n\ntime. Each female artist has perfected their art and are dedicated to taking to the stage\n\nand giving her audience a remarkable performance. I hope you find your personal\n\nfavourite Diva on this playlist and one you may discover, either way allow these divas a\n\nmoment to serenade you with a little Prima Donna thrown in.\n\nTRACK 1. One of the finest Divas to take to the classical stage is the goddess herself Maria Anna\n\nCecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos better known as Maria Callas, born in New York to Greek\n\nparents in 1923. She passed away in Paris at the age of 53 in 1977. She was a dramatic\n\nperformer and was in demand across the globe. For years, she struggled with weight\n\nissues which may have affected her voice in later years when she decided to keep\n\nslenderer. The director of the New York Met would later say that Callas was the most\n\ndifficult artist he ever worked with. “Because she was so much more intelligent. Other\n\nartists, you could get around, but Callas, you could not get around. She knew exactly what\n\nshe wanted, and why she wanted it.”\n\nShe was hailed a style icon and one of the most famous and named ‘La Divina’ to this day.\n\nHere she is singing Carmen, Act I: “L’amour est un oiseau rebelle” This opera was\n\nwritten by Georges Bizet and was first performed in Paris in 1875. At the time shocked the\n\naudience but now entertains and delights.\n\nTRACK 2. There is so much to choose from in the Ella Fitzgerald album catalogue. Her vocals are\n\npure perfection on all her recordings. Here she is singing from the album, ‘Cole Porter\n\nSong Book’. This studio album was recorded in 1956 and still sounds fresh today. Her\n\nsmooth delivery, her understanding of the sentiment of the song and her voice is\n\nuntainted. It is a pleasure to listen to.\n\nThis song was first performed in the Broadway musical ‘Anything Goes’ and goes on to be\n\nperformed by many artists. This was Ella’s first Album with Verve Records, founded by\n\nNorman Granz in 1956. Granz went on to say, “I was interested in how I could enhance\n\nElla’s position, to make her a singer with more than just a cult following amongst jazz fans.\n\nSo, I proposed to Ella that the first Verve album would not be a jazz project, but rather a\n\nsong book of the works of Cole Porter”. I think Ella takes this Cole Porter song ‘I Get A\n\nKick Out of You’ and makes it her own. The album is honoured by the Grammys and was\n\nrightly inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nTRACK 3. Billie Holiday’s ‘That Ole Devil called Love’ is a song written in 1944 by Allan Roberts\n\nand Doris Fisher. Holiday recorded this song in 1945 and it was the ‘B’ side to “Lover\n\nMan”. History shows us that Billie Holiday was a tortured soul and with every song she\n\nsang, she was able to penetrate her life experience into every vocal note. With drugs,\n\nalcohol abuse and being mistreated by some of the men in her life, her health deteriorated\n\nand she passed away on July 17, 1959. She was 44. Her career spans over 26 years and\n\nshe was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1973, leaving behind an enormous\n\ncatalogue of work. ‘Lady Day’ is gone but not forgotten.\n\nTRACK 4. The album ‘Nina Simone Sings the Blues’ was released in 1967’ and ‘I Want Some Sugar\n\nin My Bowl’ was the 7th track on the album.\n\nThe song is based on a track by one of Simone’s great inspirations the mighty Bessie\n\nSmith. She did however change the lyrics to make it her own. The album was repackaged\n\nin 1991 and reissued in 2006. Nina was an extraordinary artist, classically trained from an\n\nearly age and went on to create a wonderful collection of songs. She was known to be a\n\ntemperamental artist; however, she gave her all when performing. Off the stage she was\n\nan activist for Civil Rights and would risks fighting the cause. You may not take sugar, but\n\nthis track is one of Nina’s nice and sweet tracks… Enjoy!\n\nTRACK 5. ’Your Love Is As Black as The Night’ from the album ‘My One And Only Thrill’ released\n\nin 2009.\n\nMelody Gardot had a car accident in 2003 and her way back to recovery was through\n\nmusic therapy. At first, she started to hum and then started writing lyrics. She healed and\n\nrediscovered her life through music.\n\nShe was discovered playing in clubs and bars in Philadelphia and was encouraged to send\n\nher demo tapes to Universal Music who released her first album ‘Worrisome Heart.’ Her\n\nvocal style is slick and intimate and this track gives you a sense of hazy late nights.\n\nTRACK 6. Anita Baker’s classic ‘Sweet Love’ from her second album ‘Rapture’ released in 1986.\n\nThis was Anita’s first big hit and would go onto win her a Grammy Award for Best R&B\n\nsong in 1987. She started her musical career singing in a funk band. She walked away\n\nfrom the music industry and worked as a waitress but was rediscovered and encouraged\n\nto go solo. Her album ‘The Songstress’ was released in 1983 but unfortunately, there were\n\nrecord company squabbles regarding royalties, It took two years to settle the dispute. She\n\nwent into the studio again in 1985 and created this gem of a song.\n\nI was fortunate to have seen her perform at Wembley Stadium and it was a performance I\n\nwill never forget. She commanded the stage with such grace and ease that I felt I was in\n\nthe presence of one of the great Divas.\n\nTRACK 7. No Diva playlist is complete without the ‘Queen of Soul’ herself Aretha Franklin. Aretha\n\nLouise Franklin started singing gospel in church. Her father was a minister and at 18 he\n\ngave her his blessing to become a recording artist. Aretha’s voice became a symbol of\n\nblack pride in the sixties and helped to bring black music to a new audience. The co-\n\nfounder of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, says of Aretha, “I don’t think there’s anybody I\n\nhave known who possesses an instrument like hers and who has such a thorough\n\nbackground in gospel, the blues and the essential black-music idiom…the result is maybe\n\nthe greatest singer of our time.” This track ‘Spanish Harlem’ has been covered by many\n\nartists, but I am confident to say this is the best version.\n\nTRACK 8. It’s the Academy awards in 1997 and Celine Dion performs 3 songs and one of them is ‘I\n\nFinally Found Someone’ from the movie ‘The Mirror Has Two faces’ originally sang by\n\nBarbra Streisand and Brian Adams. Barbra Striesand also stars in the movie. A few days\n\nlater after Celine’s performance she receives this note from Streisand “I watched the tape\n\nafterwards, you sang my song beautifully and I regret I wasn’t in the room to hear you, next\n\ntime let’s make one together. I really wish your song would have won, you are a wonderful\n\nsinger”. The opportunity was taken and ‘Tell Him’ was born. Two Divas on one record is a\n\ndouble treat.\n\nTRACK 9. ‘If I Was A Boy’ was written by BC Jean and Toby Gad. Inspiration for a song comes in\n\nmany ways, even by eating pizza. “One day Jean and Gad visited a pizzeria in Times\n\nSquare in New York City. Although tempted, Jean refrained from eating pizza because she\n\nwas dieting. She then thought that if she were a boy, she would have eaten without regret.\n\nAfter reflecting on the idea, she concluded that she would have been a better man than\n\nher past lover. Gad captured Jean’s ideas on a pocket recorder, and they went to the\n\nstudio the same day. Once there, she wrote the lyrics and melody in about 15 minutes.\n\nShe then recorded the song in less than half an hour, with Gad on the guitar.” And with the\n\ndiva Beyonce giving an emotive vocal touch to the track, it gets played on every radio\n\nstation around the world and becomes a hit. I’m sure the writers have no regrets eating\n\npizza.\n\nTRACK 10. Sweetly sung by Witney Houston ‘Exhale’ (Shoop Shoop) released in 1985 and is\n\nfeatured on the soundtrack for the movie ‘Waiting to Exhale’ staring Witney Houston and\n\nAngela Basset.\n\nThe movie is based on a novel by Terry McMillian and there is talk about a sequel based\n\non another one of McMillian’s books ‘Getting to Be Happy.’\n\nWitney Houston was mentored by Clive Davis, chairman of Arista Records from the age of\n\n19 and later becomes recognised by the Guinness Book Of Records as one of the “most\n\nawarded artists of all time”. Witney Houston died in 2012 leaving behind a legacy of music\n\nany soul Diva would be proud of.\n\nTRACK 11. Lianne La Haves was born in London and raised by her Greek father and Jamaican\n\nmother. It was her parents’ diverse tastes in music that inspired her to pick up the guitar\n\nand learn to play. She wrote her first song at 11 and continues to do so. She was a\n\nbacking singer for English singer and song writer Paloma Faith. Prince became a big fan\n\nof hers and in the press, she was named his ‘Protégée’. She also supported Cold Play on\n\ntheir 2016 tour. ‘Bittersweet’ is taken from the self-titled album ‘Lianne La Haves’\n\nreleased in 2020 after a five year hiatus. Lianne is an artist to look out for if you haven’t\n\nheard of her already, a Diva in the making in the best possible way.\n\nTRACK 12. Eva Cassidy’s ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ taken from her ‘Songbird’ album released\n\nin 1998, two years after her death in 1996. ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ was made\n\nfamous by Judy Garland and taken from the 1939 movie ‘The Wizard of Oz’.\n\nAfter Eva’s death Folk singer Grace Griffith sent a copy of a 5-track album to Bill Shaw,\n\nhead of Blix Street Records in the US. Music was released but it took two years before it\n\nwas discovered. “The song becomes a big hit in the UK after being played on Terry Wogan\n\nradio morning show, ‘Wake Up to Wogan’, which made it an overnight success and heard\n\naround the world.”\n\nEva does a beautiful rendition of this song. Her voice just shines through over the rainbow\n\nand beyond.\n\nTRACK 13. ‘Cry Me A River’ was made famous by Julie London 1955 and this cover version sung by\n\nthe fabulous Dame Shirley Bassey.\n\nThe song was written by Arthur Hamilton for Ella Fitzgerald to sing in the musical crime\n\nmovie ‘Pete Kelly’s Blues’. Julie London and Hamilton were school mates and London’s\n\nhusband, Jack Webb, the director of the movie was looking for songs for the soundtrack,\n\nbut it didn’t make the cut. Ella did do a version of it for another movie called ‘Clap Hands,\n\nHere Comes Charlie’ but it was Julie London who took the song into the chart success.\n\nThis is Bassey’s take on the song, giving it her Diva signature powerful vocals.\n\nTRACK 14 ‘Vision of Love’ written by Mariah Carey and Ben Margulies was the debut song for\n\nMariah Carey and the introduction to the world stage in 1990, taken from the album\n\n‘Mariah Carey’. The song stayed in the Billboard charts at number one for 4 weeks and\n\nwas climbing and staying at the top of the charts globally. The song was nominated for\n\nthree Grammy awards in 1991 with numerous awards to follow. This song marks the\n\nbeginning of an incredible career for Carey.\n\nShe is “high-maintenance” diva – and she’s not ashamed to admit it. One of her requests\n\n“Do not speak to Mariah the day before a performance. She cannot under any\n\ncircumstances speak ahead of performing. If anyone wants to communicate with her, they\n\nhave to do so through writing or sign language so that she can preserve her voice.”\n\nYou must agree that hitting those high notes takes practice and has earned her the\n\nreputation as the ultimate Diva.\n\nTRACK 15. Lady Gaga sings ‘La Vie En Rose’ which was made famous by the French Diva, cabaret\n\nsinger Édith Piaf, she was the lyricist of the song and sung it in her formidable style.\n\nHere is Ms. Gaga singing the song on the ‘A Star Is Born’ soundtrack released in 2018.\n\nThere are many Divas who have given their rendition of the song, for example Grace\n\nJones, Donna Summer, Celine Dion and even some of guys have given their own version\n\nfor example Bill Crosby, Louis Armstrong, Dean Martin and even Iggy Pop to name a few.\n\nLady Gaga takes the song and makes it her own in the movie, she sings the song in a bar\n\nscene, everyone watches mesmerised by her performance, as well as Bradly Cooper who\n\nis her love interest. In the movie she starts to sing, and he can see she is a star in the\n\nmaking. He takes on stage with him and his audience loves her. It’s a wonderful\n\nperformance by Lady Gaga, it shows her versatility as a true pop Diva.\n\nTRACK 16 Christina Aguilera sings ‘Keep On Singing My Song’ released on the ‘Stripped’ album in\n\n2002.\n\nAguilera has a voice that holds no bounds her vocal range is unlimited. Celine Dion gave\n\nhomage to her when she said, “Without a doubt Christina Aguilera is one of the most\n\ntalented artist the world has ever seen and heard, and I think she’s going to continue to\n\namaze us for many, many years to come”. On this track she truly proves that and when\n\nshe sings the lyric “But I I’m gonna carry on, I’ll keep on singing my song” You truly believe\n\nit, her vocals are the embodiment of Divadom.\n\nTrack list created by Pepsi Demacque-Crockett. Details compiled from various\n\nonline references including Wikipedia.\n\nPepsi was part of the UK 80’s pop scene, a member of “Wham!” and half of the duo\n\n“Pepsi and Shirlie”. She later graced the stage in several Musical theatre\n\nproductions in the UK and performed across Europe with Mike Oldfield on his\n\nMillennial Bell European Tour. She now lives in St Lucia with her husband James &\n\ndog Shabby where she is a marriage officer and writer."
