Maybe one of the most iconic Christmas albums of all times. "Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas" is a 1960 album by the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, recorded in the summer of 1960, with a studio orchestra arranged and conducted by Frank DeVol. The tracks are all secular Christmas seasonal songs, interpreted in her very own wonderful style.
