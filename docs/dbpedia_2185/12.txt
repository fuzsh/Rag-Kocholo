“Ella Fitzgerald’s Christmas album is a secular holiday delight sure to please every listener, even atheists and agnostics. Originally released in 1960, the sound here is warm and inviting as a Yule log burning in the fireplace … Perfect QRP pressing too.” — Music = 9/11; Sound = 9/11 — Michael Fremer, AnalogPlanet.com.

A holiday album from the jazz legend! Have a swinging Christmas and a jazzy new year with this joyous 1960 Ella LP in your collection. She sings (and swings) “Jingle Bells,” “Sleigh Ride,” “Winter Wonderland,” and more! She puts her singular stamp on everything from a sultry vamp like “What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?” to the sweet and cozy “The Christmas Song.” Even potentially shopworn standards like “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town” sound fresher when they’re coming from Ella Fitzgerald.
