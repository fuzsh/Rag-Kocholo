        "text": "Scaffolding by Lauren Elkin\n\nThis entertaining debut novel by the critic Lauren Elkin is a \"brainy sex comedy\"s et in pre-Covid Paris, said Anthony Cummins in The Observer. Its narrator, Anna, is a Franco- American psychoanalyst whose lawyer husband is away for the summer, on a job in London, \"leaving her to oversee the long-planned knocking through of a wall in their Belleville apartment\". Anna feels lonely and adrift, until she meets Clementine, an art history postgraduate who has just moved into the same building. Clementine challenges many of Anna's assumptions – about property ownership, psychoanalysis, marriage – and also \"widens\" her \"sexual horizons\", drawing her into a ménage à trois with her boyfriend. Elkin's prose can be clumsy, and at times this novel feels overly introspective, said Ellen Peirson-Hagger in The i Paper. But as it develops, it becomes a \"truly fascinating\" study of the messiness of the human condition. In non-fiction books such as Art Monsters and Flâneuse, Elkin has shown herself to be an \"astute\" thinker; here, she proves equally \"inventive\" as a novelist.\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nGodwin by Joseph O'Neill\n\nThe premise of Joseph O'Neill's latest novel could hardly be more \"unlikely\", said Anthony Cummins in The Observer. Mark Wolfe is a failed scientist who now writes grant applications for Big Pharma. When he falls out with his colleagues at the writers' co-op he belongs to in Pittsburgh, he decides to take up a proposal put forward by his half-brother – a former footballer-turned-aspiring agent – to travel to West Africa to snap up a gifted, but elusive, young footballer. O'Neill – best known for his 2008 novel Netherland – somehow \"wrings edge-of-your-seat drama\" from this story, with its echoes of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Godwin is an \"exceptional\" novel, with an \"enthralling fireside quality\". Wolfe is a typical O'Neill creation, said Robert Collins in The Times: a \"floundering\" middle-aged man. But he shares the narration with one of his co-op colleagues – an African-American woman named Lakesha – and her account of her own career crisis gives this \"deceptively light comic novel a subtly profound undertow\". Somewhat against the odds, Godwin is \"great\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nThis Strange Eventful History by Claire Messud\n\nThe American writer Claire Messud is responsible for some of the best-loved literary novels of the past two decades, including The \"Emperor's Children\" (2006), said Alex Peake-Tomkinson in The Daily Telegraph. For her seventh novel, she has drawn on parts of her own family history to tell the story of \"the Cassar clan\", a French-Algerian family. With its title taken from the \"Seven Ages of Man\" speech in \"As You Like It\", \"This Strange Eventful History\" is a richly satisfying Balzacian saga, and may well be Messud's \"finest book\".\n\nThe action begins in the 1940s, with patriarch Gaston Cassar – a French naval officer stationed in Greece – hastily arranging for his wife and two children to return to Algeria from Paris, as the \"Germans sweep into France\", said Lucy Hughes-Hallett in The Guardian. What follows is an \"ambitious and compelling\" tale that spans seven decades and crosses multiple continents: as Gaston and his descendants fan out across the globe, the action shifts to Massachusetts, Toronto, Buenos Aires and Sydney. Messud's brilliance lies in the way she tackles big themes – colonialism, separation, the meaning of home – while delineating her characters with \"precision\".\n\nHer versatility is astonishing, said Ron Charles in The Washington Post: Messud can capture everything from the \"panicked mind of a woman realising that the love of her life is an illusion\", to a gossiping crowd at a 50th anniversary party. The results are \"magnificent\": I searched hard for flaws, but failed to find any. This is a work of \"cavernous depth\".\n\nParade by Rachel Cusk\n\nThe novelist and memoirist Rachel Cusk is \"an acquired taste worth acquiring\", said Kate Kellaway in The Observer. Since reinventing herself with the novel Outline in 2014, she has grafted fiction onto autobiography \"with a fluency that made you wonder why more novels were not written this way\". Parade, a mosaic of stories about sex, death and gender, featuring disparate artists who are all referred to as \"G\", is \"a brilliant, stark and unsettling feat\", approaching its subjects with an \"intellectual intensity\" rare in English fiction. \"I have admired, sometimes loved, all of Cusk's books,\" said Johanna Thomas-Corr in The Sunday Times. This one, however, is a plotless, introspective, humourless piece of writing \"about how hard it is being Rachel Cusk\". It's \"simultaneously cold and histrionic, hermetic and inert, rather like that scene in Being John Malkovich where everyone has John Malkovich's face only much, much less funny\". Reading Parade is \"like walking over shards of broken glass\". It doesn't feel \"bracing\", though – \"it feels unnecessary\".\n\nBlue Ruin by Hari Kunzru\n\nHari Kunzru's \"bracingly intelligent\" new novel opens with its protagonist, Jay, \"delivering groceries to a palatial home\" in upstate New York, said Sandra Newman in The Guardian. The woman who answers the door is masked (it's the early days of Covid), but Jay recognises her as Alice, \"his girlfriend from another life\". Twenty years before, they'd been together in London, when he was an \"up-and-coming Young British Artist\". But she went on to marry Jay's \"best friend and rival\" (now himself a successful artist), while Jay's career stalled, and he fell into poverty. Now, he's sick with long Covid. Alice takes Jay in, and lets him stay in a barn on her property, said David Anderson in Literary Review. While he recovers, the novel \"drifts back through time and space\", to Jay's younger days in London. Kunzru \"dexterously manages\" this slippage: his depiction of the 1990s art scene is \"superbly handled\", and is all the more compelling for being \"nested within\" the Covid narrative. It's a novel that \"confirms Kunzru's status as a master choreographer of the present moment's creeping anxiety\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nBluestockings by Susannah Gibson\n\nThe word \"bluestocking\" is today a \"derisive term for a female intellectual\", said Johanna Thomas-Corr in The Sunday Times. But the original bluestockings – as Susannah Gibson shows in this revealing book – were a group of \"brilliant thinkers determined to show that women could be every bit as rational, erudite and witty as men\". The movement was founded in the mid-1700s by the \"colossally wealthy\" Elizabeth Montagu, who held intellectual gatherings in her Mayfair home. These were attended by both women and men; the latter included Edmund Burke, Samuel Johnson and the botanist Benjamin Stillingfleet – who gave the group its name after appearing in his \"workaday blue woollen stockings\". One is left \"gasping\" at the bluestockings' sheer energy, said Miranda Seymour in Literary Review. Margaret Cavendish Bentinck founded a centre for scientific investigation; another member \"understood eight languages\". At a time when the idea of female bookishness appalled many men, theirs was a \"revolutionary\" project – and Gibson's \"spirited, lively and scholarly book\" recognises how \"remarkable\" they were.\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nThe Spoiled Heart by Sunjeev Sahota\n\nIn his previous novels, the twice Booker-nominated Sunjeev Sahota has tackled \"religious radicalisation, migration and intergenerational trauma\", said Sam Byers in The Guardian. His new one is similarly \"challenging\" in its themes: set in the Derbyshire town of Chesterfield, it explores what has become a fault line for the Left – the tension between old-school socialism and new-style identity politics. Representing the former is Nayan, a working-class divorcé in his 40s who is running to be leader of a fictional union. His main challenger is Megha, a young woman from a privileged background who tirelessly promotes racial diversity and regards Nayan as \"stuck on the factory floor\".\n\nWho would have thought that a novel about trade union politics could \"make for such riveting reading\", asked Michael Arditti in The Spectator. That it does is down to Sahota's controlled, \"spare\" prose and \"rich and nuanced\" characterisation. Sahota's one \"miscalculation\" is a tendency to indulge in \"metafictional flourishes\". That aside, this is an \"accomplished and timely political morality tale\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nThe Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley\n\n\"It is only May,\" said Ed Cumming in Literary Review, \"but Kaliane Bradley's 'The Ministry of Time' might well be the loudest debut of the year.\" Sold in 20 languages, and soon to be adapted by the BBC, it is a \"gleeful romp across genres\" that \"might have been specially bred to leap into holiday-bound tote bags\". In a near-future Britain where time travel is possible, the government has established a Ministry of Time, which recruits \"expats\" from different historical eras to undertake various tasks. The narrator, an unnamed British-Cambodian woman, works for the ministry as a \"bridge\", or expat-minder, and is assigned Graham Gore, a real-life polar explorer who perished c.1847 on HMS Terror. This is not only a sci-fi thriller, but a romcom too, said Ella Risbridger in The Guardian: despite their 200-year age gap, Gore and the narrator fall in love. Bradley has revealed that she began it as \"joke\" for her friends, and it does feel like it was \"written for pleasure\": while it tackles serious subjects, these are never at the expense of the story. The result is a \"joy to read\", a \"summer romp that also sparks real thought\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nJames by Percival Everett\n\nPercival Everett is \"no stranger to debates about the representation of race\", said Marcel Theroux in The Guardian. His 2001 novel \"Erasure\" – the story of a highbrow African-American novelist who despairs at the way his work is received – was recently adapted for the screen as the Oscar-winning American Fiction.\n\nNow, Everett has turned his attention to the racial politics of one of America's most hallowed works of literature – Mark Twain's 1884 classic, \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\". Everett retells the story from the point of view of Jim, the runaway slave who joins Huck on his journey down the Mississippi River. Although the novel has often been described as anti-racist, there has been \"growing debate\" over Jim's portrayal – with critics noting that he is one-dimensional, and that his \"main function in the novel is to give Huck an opportunity to exhibit his moral growth\". In Everett's version, Jim speaks in his own voice, and emerges as highly intelligent. The result is \"funny, entertaining and deeply thought-provoking\".\n\nThe novel's central conceit is that Jim's persona as a kind-hearted simpleton is a pose designed to make him less threatening to whites, said Jessa Crispin in The Telegraph. In reality, he can read and write, and his \"slave talk\" is an example of \"code-switching\"; when among black people, he speaks quite differently.\n\nFor most of his career, Everett's novels have been \"politely passed over\", said Johanna Thomas-Corr in The Sunday Times. Only now is his brilliance being recognised. \"Thrilling, bold and profound\", \"James\" \"has the potential to become a classic text\" – to be the book that \"seals his legacy\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nYou Are Here by David Nicholls\n\nOver his hugely successful writing career, David Nicholls has specialised in exploring \"so-called ordinary life – and so-called ordinary love – with humanity and humour\", said Erica Wagner in the FT. His sixth novel is no exception: set over a week-long walking holiday in the north of England, it tells the story of a burgeoning affair between Marnie, a 38-year-old copy editor from London, and Michael, a 42-year-old geography teacher from York. The pair are part of a group assembled by Marnie's old friend, Cleo, a teacher at Michael's school, said Alex Preston in The Observer. Also present is the \"absurdly attractive\" Conrad – to whom Marnie is initially drawn – and \"Cleo's taciturn teenage son Anthony\". But when these others drop out, Marnie and Michael are left \"alone together\" – and a \"cagoule-clad romance\" develops that completely pulls the reader in.\n\nIts charms were largely lost on me, said Claire Allfree in The Daily Telegraph. Nicholls remains as good as ever at finding humour in the \"humdrum aspects of daily life\": he's \"a poet of the mundane, like Larkin without the misanthropy\". Unfortunately, the novel suffers from a lack of drama, because we basically know what's going to happen. \"Before long, it all becomes dull.\" It may not be challenging or surprising, said Lucy Atkins in The Guardian. But that's not why we read a Nicholls book. Like his mega-selling \"One Day\", now a \"global Netflix hit\", \"You Are Here\" generates \"endless nods of recognition\" thanks to its \"pithy textural details\" and \"skilful dialogue\". For many, it will be a \"comforting antidote to the grimness of our grim world\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nChoice by Neel Mukherjee\n\nThe UK-based Indian writer Neel Mukherjee's latest novel comprises three narratives about \"21st century ethical and political dilemmas\", said Tanjil Rashid in The Guardian. In the first, Ayush, a publisher living in London, struggles with his \"human footprint\" and the \"neoliberal\" outlook of his husband. In the second, Emily, an academic, becomes obsessed with an illegal immigrant taxi driver, after his cab is involved in a hit-and-run. In the third, the lives of a family in India fall apart when they receive the \"well-meant gift\" of a cow.\n\nWith themes including climate change, animal cruelty and the \"white saviour complex\", Choice \"is very much of its moment\", said Benjamin Markovits in The Telegraph. And much of it is \"beautifully written\" – but to me, it felt \"maybe less of a novel and more a triptych of tales\".\n\nActually, there is a pattern of \"well-intentioned error\" here that bonds the sections together, said Jonathan Lee in The New York Times. Written in \"cool, calm, all-noticing prose\", this is a \"strangely uplifting, exquisitely droll heartbreaker of a book\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nCaledonian Road by Andrew O'Hagan\n\nThe Caledonian Road is the main thoroughfare heading north from London's King's Cross. At its southeastern end are the leafy Georgian squares of Islington, said Tim Adams in The Observer. But just minutes away, it is flanked by gritty estates. In his long and ambitious seventh novel, Andrew O'Hagan takes his readers \"deep into the lives of all the communities who live around 'the Cally'\". His central character is Campbell Flynn, a Glasgow-born art historian and bestselling author who lives in Islington with his family. Flynn moves in rarefied circles – his best friend is a retail tycoon who is facing sexual harassment charges – but he becomes embroiled in a very different world when he befriends one of his students, a \"radical post-colonial theorist\" named Milo Mangasha. While Flynn thinks that knowing Milo will help keep him relevant, Milo has other ideas entirely. Nimbly moving between a huge cast of characters, Caledonian Road is a \"pitch-perfect\" Dickensian tragicomedy of manners, and an enjoyable \"dispatch from the trenches of culture wars\".\n\nIt's a book that \"springs from scene to scene without let-up, and the energy generated carries the reader pleasurably along\", said John Self in The Times. In O'Hagan's skilfully created scenes – court cases, TV shows, parties – we meet people traffickers, drill rappers, Russian oligarchs and international playboys. At its best, Caledonian Road is a Bonfire of the Vanities for the 21st century, but \"all this activity comes at a cost\". Some characters feel more than a little feeble – one, who is non-binary, simply \"spouts woke talking points\" – and the breakneck pace leaves \"little breathing space\".\n\nEven though it's 650 pages long, the novel feels cramped. It's \"just too much – but also not quite enough\". I found it \"rather brittle\" and bombastic, said Lucy Scholes in the FT. The endless bon mots become exhausting – \"High-minded values are merely low-minded prejudices dressed in the robes of office,\" one character ploddingly opines – and O'Hagan has a habit of both showing and telling. The book isn't flawless, said Nikhil Krishnan in The Daily Telegraph: there's too much editorialising, and most of the characters are \"odious\". Still, it's hard not to admire O'Hagan's ambition and chutzpah. This \"dauntingly populous\" novel is an \"emphatically contemporary\" social satire that describes the \"way we live now\". If it leaves a bitter taste, maybe that's because \"a state-of-the-nation novel can't afford to make the state of the nation seem nicer than it is\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nThe Painter's Daughters by Emily Howes\n\nThe 18th century portraitist Thomas Gainsborough immortalised his two daughters, Molly and Peggy, in half-a-dozen canvases that charted their development from \"carefree girls\" to \"fashionable young women\", said Mark Bostridge in The Spectator. In her \"ingenious\" debut, Emily Howes \"delves beneath the surface\" of the paintings to imagine what life for the sisters was like.\n\nIt is not a happy tale, said James Walton in The Daily Telegraph. Peggy, the narrator, realises when young that Molly is sometimes \"not herself\". As Molly (who did indeed succumb to madness as an adult) becomes \"increasingly erratic\", Penny becomes her sister's protector.\n\nMarked by its nuanced understanding of family dynamics, this is a \"hugely impressive\" work. Howes writes \"knowledgeably on everything from Georgian pigments to the tensions of sisterly love\", said Imogen Hermes Gowar in The Guardian. So it's a pity that she includes a \"superfluous\" subplot, set 40 years earlier, which concerns the paternity of Gainsborough's wife. This \"assured\" book didn't need \"spicing up\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nUntil August by Gabriel García Márquez\n\nBefore he died aged 87, Gabriel García Márquez instructed his sons to destroy his final novel, telling them: \"It doesn't work.\" They have decided to ignore his request, said David Mills in The Times. And so, ten years after the writer's death, we have this curious novel, with a plot that only he could have come up with. It opens with Ana, the wife of a conductor, taking her annual trip to a Caribbean island to visit her mother's grave. This year, feeling \"mischievous\", she decides to bed a stranger she meets in a bar. Each year after that, visits to the grave are followed by an attempt to \"find a lover and have an eye-watering night of sex\".\n\nMárquez was in the early stages of dementia when he wrote Until August, and at times it shows, said Sarah Perry in The Daily Telegraph. It lacks the \"inventive discursions\" of his best work, and some of the writing is gauche and imprecise. Yet much of the novel is \"astutely observed and beautifully conveyed\", and the \"cumulative effect is oddly moving\". Until August may not \"enlarge the legend of Gabo\" – but nor does it \"diminish it\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nThe Lodgers by Holly Pester\n\nThis well-timed debut novel – about a \"young woman's precarious experience of subletting\" – begins with the narrator moving into a new flat in the small English town in which she grew up, said Chloë Ashby in the TLS. It is not her first time returning there: her life has been caught in a \"desperate cycle\" of moving away and then moving back. No sooner has she arrived in her new lodging – which \"smells of men's shower gel and instant noodles\" – than she begins obsessively imagining the life of the woman who has taken up the rented room she had just vacated, in another \"similar\" town.\n\nWhile \"nothing extraordinary occurs\" in The Lodgers, it's \"compelling\" and \"pleasingly weird\". Pester is also a poet, and it \"shows\", said Lucy Thynne in Literary Review. Her playful sentences revel in the oddness of language, and you sense the narrator's \"desire to get out of her own head\". Eccentric and disorientating it may be, but this novel \"holds a pressing, political truth\", said Ellen Peirson-Hagger in The Observer: to stay in any kind of precarious housing, it suggests, \"is to not live totally as oneself\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nLeaving by Roxana Robinson\n\nAt a performance of Tosca at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, two 60-year-olds who were briefly a couple in their youth cross paths, said Amity Gaige in The New York Times. The woman, Sarah, is divorced; the man, Warren, is married. They have dinner together, and realise that they have \"unfinished business\". From this premise, the American novelist Roxana Robinson builds a pitch-perfect study of \"late-life love\", said Joan Frank in The Washington Post. It's not a remotely sentimental or cloying tale; Robinson charts the many obstacles the couple face, including the \"implacable\" rage of Warren's grown-up daughter. Written in \"shapely and sensuous\" sentences, Leaving is a \"wondrous feat\".\n\n\"Affection between older people\" is just one theme here, said Caroline Moorehead in The Spectator. Robinson writes superbly about the \"terrifying ruthlessness of human beings\", and even about dog ownership. And as its title suggests, Leaving is as much about loss as about fulfilment. With its \"many twists\" and bombshell ending, this is a \"highly enjoyable\" novel.\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nBurma Sahib by Paul Theroux\n\nIn his 30th novel, the veteran writer Paul Theroux fictionalises a \"relatively unexplored\" period of George Orwell's life, said William Boyd in The New York Times: the five years he spent as a colonial police officer in Burma between 1922 and 1927. Eric Blair (as he then was) was fresh out of Eton, and hadn't yet decided to become a writer. Theroux presents him as a \"somewhat tormented soul\", who is \"repelled\" by the snobberies and injustices of colonial life. To console himself, he sleeps promiscuously with \"local prostitutes and colonial wives\". Inevitably, it's a work that owes much to speculation, but everything in it \"reeks of plausibility\" – and it shows that, at the age of 82, Theroux's talent remains \"in remarkable shape\".\n\nTheroux's Orwell sets sail for Burma \"full of romantic notions acquired from Kipling\", said Nikhil Krishnan in The Daily Telegraph. The narrative charts how he loses his idealism, and in the process \"acquires a sense of writerly vocation\". Full of \"fine\" descriptive passages, Burma Sahib is \"both credible as history\" and an \"enjoyable\" novel in its own right.\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nMy Heavenly Favourite by Lucas Rijneveld\n\nThis second novel by the acclaimed Dutch author Lucas Rijneveld \"belongs to a tiny, controversial subgenre\", said Sandra Newman in The Guardian: \"novels about child sex abuse rendered in exquisite prose\". It is narrated by \"Kurt\", a 49-year-old vet from rural Holland, who becomes obsessed with the \"troubled 14-year-old daughter of a dairy farmer\". The girl, whom Kurt – her name for him – calls \"Little Bird\", comes from a strict religious society, and is confused about her gender identity – something Kurt exploits to become a \"parental figure\".\n\nSuch a novel could easily have been a \"cynical\" rehash of Lolita, but instead it's a \"tour de force of transgressive imagination\". Rijneveld's \"unsettling\" first novel, \"The Discomfort of Evening\" – about a girl coaxed into sex games with her siblings – won the 2020 International Booker Prize, said Luke Kennard in The Daily Telegraph. His follow-up is quite possibly even better. Written in run-on sentences with a \"breathless cadence\", it's an \"extraordinary literary achievement – albeit one you might hesitate to recommend\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nGreen Dot by Madeleine Gray\n\nThis \"acutely witty debut\" by the Australian literary critic Madeleine Gray charts the \"affair between a disaffected millennial and her older, married boss\", said Madeleine Feeny in The Guardian. Hera, 24, is broke, overqualified, and \"living in Sydney with her father\" when she starts a job as an online community moderator. Exasperated by the \"indignities of office life on the bottom rung\", she begins a flirtation with fortysomething Arthur – which develops into a full-blown affair. While it's hardly an original story, Gray's \"parodist's ear for the cadences, platitudes and jargon of modern speech\" ensures that this is a convincing, propulsive work. There's some \"quite bad writing\" on display in these pages, said Johanna Thomas-Corr in The Sunday Times – as when Gray describes the feeling of being kept a secret by your lover as like \"getting your period mid-hike with no tampons in sight\". But the novel \"shines\" in other ways – such as in its subtle \"exploration of the toxic relationship between boredom and lust\". Ignore the \"TikTok-friendly metaphors\", and you'll be in for a treat.\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nDay by Michael Cunningham\n\nMany writers have responded to the Covid pandemic by \"fashioning dystopias\", said Claire Allfree in The Daily Telegraph. Not Michael Cunningham. \"One of America's most refined stylists\", he prefers, in the elegiac \"Day\", to \"see lockdown as a microcosm of life at its most yearningly restless\". The novel is focused on three \"angsty New Yorkers\" who share the same cramped Brooklyn brownstone. Isabel and Dan are married: she's a \"harried senior photo editor at a soon-to-be-defunct\" magazine; he's a failed singer-songwriter. Upstairs lives Isabel's younger brother Robbie, a gay schoolteacher who spends much of his time curating the Instagram account of an imaginary brother he nicknames \"Wolfe\".\n\nCunningham deploys the same \"triptych structure\" he used in his best-known novel, \"The Hours\", said Ron Charles in The Washington Post: \"Day\" unfolds in three sections, each taking place on the same day, 5 April, over three consecutive years. While it's \"thinly plotted\", Cunningham's exposure of his characters' inner life is \"piercing\", and his \"truly beautiful\" writing \"vibrates off the page\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nBreakdown by Cathy Sweeney\n\nThis \"blistering\" first novel by an acclaimed Irish short-story writer anatomises \"a marriage that has outrun its course\", said Lucy Popescu in The Observer. The unnamed narrator doesn't know she's walking out for good when she leaves her comfortable house in a Dublin suburb one Tuesday morning, not saying goodbye to her sleeping husband and teenaged children. But, as she makes her way, by train and ferry, to Fishguard in Wales, we're filled in on her \"prolonged unravelling\" in writing of masterly economy and restraint.\n\nSweeney's spare, precise prose \"gives the book a cinematic quality\", said Chloë Ashby in The Spectator. Every moment in it is \"observed in slow motion and high definition\". It turns out that the protagonist's exit has been preceded by certain signs: \"drinking alone; disliking her daughter, or at least her type; having an affair with her friend's son; opening a separate bank account in her maiden name when her mother died\". But there's a core of mystery to this \"deceptively simple story that tugs you along from start to finish\".\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nWild Houses by Colin Barrett\n\nColin Barrett is a writer of \"glaringly obvious talent\" who has previously restricted himself to short stories, said Keiran Goddard in The Guardian. Now, for the first time, he has broadened his canvas: set in the same working class County Mayo milieu that Barrett has explored in his earlier work, \"Wild Houses\" is a hugely enjoyable crime caper. Gabe and Sketch are small-time crooks who are owed a few grand by a local drug dealer. In an attempt to extract the money, they abduct the dealer's younger brother, Doll, and retreat to a remote farmhouse owned by their cousin Dev. Although the story may seem slight, the book is elevated by the \"deftness of its telling\", and Barrett's \"droll, linguistically inventive\" dialogue.\n\nThere's an impressive \"depth of character on display\" in these pages, said George Cochrane in The TLS. Dev – a \"godly-sized unit\" who is dominated by his younger cousins – is memorably drawn, as is Doll's frantic girlfriend, Nicky. Mixing \"action scenes with quieter moments\", Wild Houses is \"exhilarating\", atmospheric and addictive.\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nWellness by Nathan Hill\n\nNathan Hill's 2016 debut novel, \"The Nix\" – a \"time-jumping, character-hopping, consistently funny 200,000-word\" doorstop – was hailed as a work of staggering promise, said Jonathan Myerson in The Observer. Nearly as long, and no less ambitious, Hill's follow-up is \"equally remarkable\". In part, it's an \"Updikean story of marital inertia\", about a couple called Jack and Elizabeth who, after 20 years together, find themselves contemplating \"separate master bedrooms\". Yet it's also a satire on the \"many post-truths\" flourishing in contemporary America – including the blandishments of the wellness industry, for which Elizabeth works. Rich in \"ideas and possibilities\", \"Wellness\" is \"utterly immersive\".\n\nHill is at his best when his \"satirical prods\" are directed at specific topics, said John Self in The Daily Telegraph. For instance, an account of a swingers' orgy proves funny and surprisingly affecting. But a novel this long needs gripping storylines and convincing themes – and here \"Wellness\" falls down. It provides \"page-by-page pleasure\", but works less well on a larger scale.\n\nAvailable on The Week Bookshop\n\nTell by Jonathan Buckley\n\nStories about the super-rich \"tend to focus on their subjects' dysfunction\", said Benjamin Markovits in The Daily Telegraph. Not so Jonathan Buckley's 12th novel, which is \"just as interested in the virtues and habits\" that have enabled its hero – retail tycoon Curtis Doyle – to succeed. The novel is framed as a series of interviews with Doyle's gardener, who is telling a mysterious interlocutor about Doyle's life, in the wake of his disappearance from his \"palace\" in Scotland. The format \"yields great rewards\": the gardener is free to jump from episode to episode, \"without the structural impositions of a conventional plot\". Packed with \"wonderful\" anecdotes and character sketches, this is \"one of the best new novels I’ve read in a while\".\n\nOver his 25-year career, Buckley has consistently eschewed traditional narrative, said George Cochrane in the FT. His readership may have remained small as a result, but that's no reflection of the quality of his novels. \"Tell\" is another hugely \"satisfying\" work, said David Annand in the TLS: a \"fascinating exploration of what it means to tell stories about our lives\"."
