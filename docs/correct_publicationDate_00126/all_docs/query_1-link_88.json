        "text": "When Edward C. Cosgrove became Erie County district attorney in 1974, he brought his savvy as a former FBI special agent to the job.\n\nHe cracked down on government corruption in Buffalo and Cheektowaga. To solve the racially motivated murders by the .22 Caliber Killer, he organized a 185-man probe with a 24-hour command post. He was the only local-level prosecutor in the nation to stage a series of sting operations against mobsters.\n\nFor assistance, he got cooperation from a wide variety of agencies – the Buffalo Police Department, the State Police, U.S. Justice Department, the FBI and the U.S. Strike Force on Organized Crime. In one of the sting operations, he arranged for a federal grant to get the hundreds of thousands of dollars that federal undercover agents needed to buy a stolen Rembrandt painting.\n\nThe strength of his crime-fighting reputation led Reps. Jack F. Kemp, John J. LaFalce and Henry J. Nowak to recommend him to President Jimmy Carter to succeed outgoing Clarence M. Kelly as FBI director in 1977. U.S. Court of Appeals Judge William H. Webster got the job instead.\n\nMr. Cosgrove declined to run for a third term as district attorney in 1981 and started his own practice, the Cosgrove Law Firm. One of his sons, James, joined him in 2000. He tried more cases to a jury verdict than most lawyers in New York State and continued seeing clients until just before his death July 4 in Mercy Hospital after a brief illness. He was 89.\n\nBorn in South Buffalo, Edward Charles Cosgrove was the oldest of nine children of Edward J. and Margaret E. Mathews Cosgrove. His father was a high school guidance counselor and a steelworker.\n\nHe attended Our Lady of Victory Academy in Lackawanna and was a 1952 graduate of Bishop Timon High School, where he played football and basketball.\n\nHe went on to earn a bachelor’s degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1956, working summers in a steel plant, and received a doctor of law degree from Georgetown University Law School in 1959. He was admitted to the bar in the District of Columbia later that year.\n\nAfter serving in the Army, he became a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was sworn in by its director, J. Edgar Hoover. He was assigned to FBI offices in Washington, D.C.; Jacksonville, Fla., and Baltimore, Md.\n\nMr. Cosgrove returned to Buffalo in 1963 to practice law, earned a certificate in criminal law from Northwestern University in 1965 and was affiliated with the firm of Cosgrove and O’Connor from 1965 to 1973. He appeared in court frequently in murder and personal injury cases.\n\nHe quickly entered politics, seeking the Democratic endorsement for a vacant Assembly seat in 1964. He became a confidential clerk for his uncle, State Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Cosgrove, in 1966.\n\nActive as a campaign manager and fundraiser, he secured the Democratic endorsement to succeed his longtime friend, District Attorney Michael F. Dillon, when Dillon was elevated to State Supreme Court in 1973. He defeated James T. McFarland, a well-known Republican state senator, by nearly 60,000 votes, and was sworn in by his uncle.\n\nHe recruited top law school graduates for his staff and cultivated close relationships with local police departments. Although his office handled more than 10,000 felony cases during his tenure, he was not immune from criticism.\n\nComplaints followed an announcement that, due to an overwhelming caseload, he would prosecute only the most serious drunken driving cases. Protests greeted his decision just before leaving office to disband the Major Homicide Task Force he created for the .22 Caliber Killer case after a judge ruled that the suspect, Joseph Christopher, was mentally unfit to stand trial.\n\nChristopher eventually was convicted of the first three of the 13 murders he committed and died in prison in 1993. Mr. Cosgrove received a special commendation for his work from FBI Director Webster.\n\nIn private practice, his clients included local and national corporations, insurance companies, physicians, dentists, Canisius and Bishop Timon-St. Jude high schools, St. Michael’s Catholic Church and several orders of Women Religious.\n\nHe returned to the other side of the courtroom in 2004 when a Chautauqua County judge named him special prosecutor in the case involving Jamestown Police Officer Michael Watson, suspected in the disappearance and death of a single mother, Yolanda Bindics.\n\nIn 2008, he appeared in Chautauqua County Court as prosecutor and defense attorney on the same day – for Watson’s sentencing and to represent a former state police investigator facing charges from a fatal crash.\n\n“Everybody’s entitled to the benefit of a good strong defense in the courtroom,” he explained to Buffalo News reporter Gene Warner, “and the community is entitled to a knowledgeable, strong and just prosecution.”\n\nHe was one of Gov. Mario Cuomo’s choices for the newly-formed Horizons Waterfront Commission in 1988, was chairman, and served until 1991. He also was a member of the Superspan Task Force in 2000 and several panels and committees considering the construction of a new Peace Bridge between Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ont.\n\nFor 43 years, he received the highest peer review rating for legal ability and ethical standards in the Martindale-Hubbell law directory. He was selected as one of the top lawyers in New York State by the New York Law Journal in 2023 and received the Legal Elite Lifetime Achievement Award from the Buffalo Law Journal and Business First in 2017.\n\nA member of the county, state and national bar associations, he chaired the state organization’s Trial Lawyers Section in 2003-04, was a member of its House of Delegates in 2005 and 2006 and a member of its Task Force on Lawyer Advertising from 2006 to 2010.\n\nDeeply religious, he was active in numerous Catholic organizations. He was a member of the board of directors of Our Lady of Victory Homes of Charity from 1980 to 1988 and chaired its Father Baker Campaign dinners. He was a former chairman and president of St. Columban Retreat House in Derby and the St. Columban’s Retreat League.\n\nHe was a former trustee and board chairman of Christ the King Seminary and D’Youville College. He also was a trustee of the Mercy Hospital of Buffalo Foundation for 16 years.\n\nHe chaired 25 kickoff luncheons and was a member of the advisory board for 25 appeal drives for the Diocese of Buffalo’s Retirement Fund for the Religious from 1988 to 2012, raising more than $24.4 million. He continued as a sponsor and adviser for drives from 2013 to 2023. He received a special award from the Leadership Conference of Women Religious in 1999.\n\nOther honors included the St. Bonaventure University Gaudete Medal in 2007, the Trocaire College Reflections Award in 2014 and the Spirit of St. Francis Award in 2016 from Bishop Timon-St. Jude High School, which also recognized him as a distinguished alumnus in 1997. He was a Buffalo News Outstanding Citizen in 1977.\n\nA former president of the Notre Dame Club of Buffalo, he was the club’s Man of the Year in 1988. He was Man of the Year in 1975 and 1981 for Morality in Media of Western New York.\n\nHe was a former member of the Parish Council of Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Church and a member of the Orchard Park Country Club and the Buffalo Club.\n\nHe and Dorothea Ann Nicosia, a high school teacher he met on a blind date, were married in St. Benedict’s Catholic Church on Nov. 25, 1967. Devoted to his family, he especially enjoyed watching his grandchildren’s athletic events.\n\nIn addition to his wife, survivors include three sons, Dr. Edward J., James C. and Charles M.; a daughter, Mary Cathleen Moran; six sisters, Aileen Flynn, Jeanne Kirk, Cecelia Cosgrove, Clare Andrews, Ellen Schneiderer and Margaret Stiglianese; a brother, Terrence; and eight grandchildren.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be offered at 10 a.m. Tuesday in Nativity of Our Lord Church, 26 Thorn Ave., Orchard Park.\n\nEmail danderson@buffnews.com.\n\nObituaries Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the most recent local obituaries delivered to your inbox.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nDale Anderson\n\nReporter\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
