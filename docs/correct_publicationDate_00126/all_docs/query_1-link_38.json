        "text": "Readers have been in love with the Mitch Rapp book series ever since the first book came out in 1999. Penned by the late New York Times bestselling author Vince Flynn, the fictional counterterrorism operative has gone through numerous adventures which continue to this day. After Flynn’s untimely death from prostate cancer in 2013, writer Kyle Mills picked up the series.

The novels follow Mitch as he goes around the world, performing increasingly dangerous tasks and uncovering world-shattering conspiracies. Political thrillers with an assassin as their main character, Mitch Rapp novels can be tricky to navigate as a series.

This article will serve as your guide to Mitch Rapp series in order of the events unfolding in the novels.
