Have an account? .\n\nThe Netflix thriller \"You\" features a number of literary references throughout the seasons.\n\nJoe references real-life books and authors â€” some foreshadow what's going to happen on the show.\n\nWarning: This post contains spoilers for \"You.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring season one, Joe highly recommends the 1970 novel \"Desperate Characters\" to Beck.\n\nWhen Beck (Elizabeth Lail) first comes into Joe's (Penn Badgley) bookstore, she's looking at a Paula Fox novel, to which Joe recommends she read \"Desperate Characters.\"\n\nBeck says she's worried it won't live up to the hype but ends up buying it anyway.\n\n\"Desperate Characters\" tells the story of a couple, Sophie and Otto, living in Brooklyn.\n\nAfter Sophie is bitten trying to feed a stray, a series of small disasters begin striking the couple, revealing the rifts in a marriage and society crumbling to pieces.\n\nThe book is later seen on her coffee table when Benji (Lou Taylor Pucci) asks about it.\n\nPeach Salinger is a distant cousin of J.D. Salinger.\n\nSalinger is known for \"Catcher in the Rye,\" and \"Franny and Zooey.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA rude customer buys \"Franny and Zooey\" on episode one of season one.\n\nA rude customer can be seen buying \"Franny and Zooey\" from the bookstore on the first episode.\n\n\"He's just pissed he has to buy Salinger to feel respectable,\" Joe's internal monologue says over the scene.\n\nHis rudeness might allude to Joe's impression of Peach, the author's fictional descendant on the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe lends Paco \"Don Quixote.\"\n\n\"The most valuable things in life are usually the most helpless. So they need people like us to protect them,\" Joe tells Paco on episode one, season one.\n\nThis quote could be alluding to his obsessive overprotection of Beck through his actions.\n\nRight after, he gives Paco (Luca Padovan) an old copy of \"Don Quixote\" by Miguel de Cervantes.\n\n\"It's about a guy who believes in chivalry so he decides to be an old school knight,\" Joe explains to Paco, adding that this book is one of his favorites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe also lends Paco \"The Three Musketeers\" by Alexandre Dumas.\n\nJoe sees Paco reading on the stairs of their building and comments on how fast he's reading \"The Three Musketeers.\"\n\nPaco replies, \"It reads quick. It's good.\"\n\n\"The Three Musketeers\" follows d'Artagnan after he leaves home to join the Musketeers of the Guard, where he becomes friends with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeck gives Joe \"The Da Vinci Code\" by Dan Brown in Italian.\n\nAfter he saves her from the train tracks, Beck comes back to the store and gives him \"Il Codice Da Vinci\" with one of her poems inside.\n\nThis book is a mystery thriller, the same genre as \"You.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe and Ethan set up for a debut of Stephen King and Owen King's book, \"Sleeping Beauties,\" at their bookstore.\n\nThe morning \"Sleeping Beauties\" is released at Joe's bookstore, Ethan (Zach Cherry) says, \"Let's give thanks to our Lord Stephen King who bestowed books so that our bookstores in third-dimensional locations may live.\"\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties\" revolves around the disappearance of women from the world.\n\nIt could be alluding to the women on \"You\" who disappear in one way or another: Beck, Peach, or even Candace (Ambyr Childers).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe gives Paco \"Frankenstein\" by Mary Shelley to read next.\n\nAfter Paco hates a werewolf novel the girls in his class keep talking about, Joe recommends \"Frankenstein.\"\n\nHe says, \"The monster is really cool and scary, but also not really the monster.\" The audience later realizes this is probably how Joe feels about himself.\n\n\"It's cool how you get the monster's POV, you understand why he does stuff,\" Paco later tells Joe. \"It's weird because he's bad, but not all bad.\"\n\nJoe then adds, \"Well, I think it's open to your interpretation.\"\n\nThis could reference the format of \"You\" in and of itself and the audience's potential perception of Joe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe steals \"Ozma of Oz\" by L. Frank Baum from Peach's house.\n\nDuring Peach's party on episode two, season one, Joe finds a collection of old and first-edition novels and pockets Baum's \"Ozma of Oz,\" the third book in the Oz series.\n\nThe tale follows Dorothy Gale of Kansas as she makes a trip over the rainbow for the second time.\n\nIt's also revealed that Joe used to read this book when Mr. Mooney locked him in the basement of the bookstore as a kid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe turns to numerous books and authors to figure out how to get rid of a dead body.\n\nJoe lists King and Caleb Carr as some authors he researched to figure out how to get rid of Benji's body.\n\nHe takes a look at Carr's \"The Alienist,\" a thriller about a ritualistic killer before he turns to a cookbook that explains how to butcher a chicken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe follows Beck to a Charles Dickens festival.\n\nBeck attends a Dickens festival with her family.\n\nHere, everyone dresses up in Victorian-era clothing and participates in old-fashioned activities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe recommends Paco read \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" by Dumas.\n\nAfter Paco tells Joe about his issues with Ron and how he wants revenge, Joe recommends \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\"\n\nPaco gets mad at the book and says, \"He waits 24 years to get justice.\"\n\nJoe replies, \"It's all about the long game.\"\n\nThis is foreshadowing Ron's murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe throws Beck a literary-themed birthday party and dresses up as Hemingway.\n\nLynn dresses up as a \"Harry Potter\" character and Blythe becomes Dorothea Brooke from George Eliot's \"Middlemarch.\"\n\nEthan's costume is Mr. Darcy from Jane Austen's beloved novel \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\n\nYou can also spot a Shakespeare and Mark Twain among the guests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCandace reads and destroys \"Wuthering Heights.\"\n\nDuring season one, episode nine, there's a flashback of Candace reading \"Wuthering Heights\" by Emily BrontÃ« to Joe.\n\nThe book is later destroyed and Joe is shown repairing the book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe and Beck read together.\n\nJoe is reading \"Black Swan Green\" by David Mitchell.\n\nMeanwhile, Beck reads \"On Beauty\" by Zadie Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeason two kicks off with a mural of books.\n\nThis real-life mural is located in Hollywood, and the books featured are all written by Charles Bukowski, a German-American novelist and poet deeply influenced by California.\n\nThe second season takes place in Los Angeles and the books could be foreshadowing Joe's job as a bookseller at the high-end wellness store Anavrin just a few moments later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the first episode of season two, Joe whips out \"Crime and Punishment.\"\n\nJoe takes the Fyodor Dostoyevsky book out of his bag during his job interview with the Anavrin employee Calvin (Adwin Brown).\n\n\"I just feel like it gets more relevant every day, right?\" Joe tells him. \" ... This guy's struggling, trying to get past his mistakes, you know. I don't like to get political but I will say our world is done for if we don't think about that, how to be better.\"\n\n\"I can't believe you just did that, made a Russian novel sound like something I'd want to read,\" Calvin tells him.\n\nWe later learn that Joe brought the book to secure his job at Anavrin when we see a flashback of Forty angrily lecturing Calvin for ordering a bunch of copies of \"Crime and Punishment.\"\n\n\"What? There's a human alive who wants to read 'Crime and Punishment?'\" Forty tells Calvin.\n\nThat said, the book could also be a nod to Joe's present state. The novel's narrator struggles to overcome his past mistakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Joe's first social-media posts is a photo of three books.\n\nDuring season two, episode one, Joe takes a photo of three colorful novels.\n\nThe red book is \"The Power\" by Naomi Alderman, a sci-fi novel about women developing the ability to shoot electrical jolts from their fingertips, helping them to become the dominant gender.\n\nThis could allude to Love having the upper hand at the close of the season when locked Joe in his own cage.\n\nThe yellow book is \"Gold Fame Citrus\" by Claire Vaye Watkins, a novel set in the future in California.\n\nAccording to Goodreads, this book explores the myths we believe about others and tell about ourselves.\n\nIt certainly seems like a nod to Joe and the lies and constant justifications he tells himself.\n\nThe last book is \"Sum\" by David Eagleman, a novel that goes through different afterlives and alternate realities of what could have been.\n\nThe reference could foreshadow Joe's fresh start as someone new (Will).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLove's parting gift to Joe is a Joan Didion book.\n\nOn the second episode of season two, Love (Victoria Pedretti) gifts Joe Didion's novel \"Play It As It Lays,\" a novel that dissects American life in the 1960s.\n\nAs she gives it to Joe, she calls it \"smart,\" \"complex,\" and \"a little dark\" because it's what \"makes [him] feel at home\" and what makes her feel at home.\n\nThis is foreshadowing Love's own dark past of murder and deception.\n\nWe later see Joe reading the book on episode three and packing it in his duffel bag on episode eight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe's locker at Anavrin contains the book \"Nostromo\" by Joseph Conrad.\n\nDuring season two, episode three, Joe opens his locker to get a baked treat from Love, revealing two books in the locker.\n\nAlthough the brown book's name is unclear, the green novel is \"Nostromo,\" a tale of rebellion and exploitation set in a fictional republic.\n\nIt has an omniscient narrator who withholds details from the reader, similar to Joe's tendency to withhold details from the viewer.\n\nFor example, when he saw Love long before he met her in the grocery store, he purposefully got an apartment that overlooked it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe gives Ellie a list of books to read and the first one is a Russian novel.\n\nAfter Ellie (Jenna Ortega) gives Joe a movie recommendation, he insists on getting her a book.\n\nHis first proposal is \"The Master and Margarita\" by Mikhail Bulgakov.\n\n\"For Ellie, something dark, funny, ambitious,\" Joe says as he buys it at Anavrin on season two, episode three.\n\nThe book is a Russian novel, something Joe is likely trying to sell more of after his initial job interview with Calvin.\n\nIt is known for being dark and funny since it's based around the devil, a naked witch, and a black cat who loves to drink vodka and play chess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring season two, episode seven, we get a glimpse of the books in Joe's cage.\n\nAs Delilah (Carmela Zumbado) digs around his cage, you can see a few books Joe has kept inside of it.\n\nIt's difficult to make out all of the titles, but one visible name is Aristotle Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy's second husband and wealthy shipping magnate.\n\nYou can also see \"Berlin Wild\" by Elly Welt, a book set during World War II.\n\nThese could be a handful of titles Joe wanted to bring with him during his trek from New York to Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe's newest target is reading a stack of classic books.\n\nDuring the season-two finale, Joe is carrying \"Crime and Punishment\" (the book that helped him get hired at Anavrin) into his yard.\n\nBut instead of actually reading it, he peers over through the fence at his neighbor, who is making her way through a few books.\n\nHer stack includes \"Brave New World,\" a classic dystopian novel by Aldous Huxley. The sci-fi work is centered around a world where life is genetically engineered and pain-free, but also meaningless.\n\nShe also has \"A Guide to Jane Austen\" by Michael Hardwick and \"Kafka's Selected Stories,\" translated by Stanley Corngold, which are both classic writers.\n\nHer taste in literature could be part of the reason why Joe falls for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe mentions several authors at the beginning of the first episode of season three.\n\nJoe mentions several authors and common themes when describing what he imagines parenthood will be like.\n\nHe mentions Nicholson Baker's essays and Louisa May Alcott's novels before deciding that parenthood is instead \"'Groundhog Day' as written by Jean Paul-Satre.\"\n\nJoe also compares taking care of his infant Henry to the \"Greek myth about pushing a boulder of baby poop up a hill\" in reference to the myth of Sisyphus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Great Gatsby\" is mentioned multiple times in the first episode.\n\nJoe reads Fitzgerald's classic \"The Great Gatsby\" to Henry, who throws up on the book.\n\nJoe also refers to Natalie (Michaela McManus) as \"the green light at the end of my dock.\" In the book, the green light was a symbol for hope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe grabs his hat off of a Hemingway book.\n\nWhen Joe leaves the house to follow Natalie on the first episode, he grabs his baseball cap off of a stack of two books. The top book is written by Hemingway.\n\nJoe previously dressed up the famous writer for Beck's birthday party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNatalie takes multiple books out of the library, including one that hints at the season's end.\n\nNatalie takes out a stack of books that includes N.K. Jemisin's fantasy \"The Broken Earth Trilogy\" and Laura Hillenbrand's \"Seabiscuit: An American Legend.\"\n\nShe also checks out Gillian Flynn's suspense-filled novel \"Gone Girl,\" in which the main character fakes her own death.\n\nJoe does the same by the end of the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a full rack of books by a King character.\n\nJoe stands next to a rack of books by Scott Landon as he watches Natalie check out library books.\n\nScott Landon is actually a character in King's book \"Lisey's Story.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe quotes the book Natalie checks out for him.\n\nNatalie checks out Fitzgerald's \"Tender Is the Night\" for Joe at the library.\n\nJoe can be seen reading the book on his couch and later quotes it to Natalie.\n\nHowever, he slightly changes the line, saying, \"New friends can often have a better time together than old friends.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe reads a classic children's book to Henry.\n\nAfter failing to entertain Henry with classic novels, Joe reads Arnold Lobel's \"Frog and Toad\" book to him.\n\nHe mentions wanting to read Astrid Lindgren's \"Pippi Longstocking\" to Henry next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is mentioned throughout the third episode.\n\nThe third episode starts with Joe referencing \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" when he thinks, \"Things are always better in the morning. At least that's what Scout tells us, and who am I to argue with Harper Lee.\"\n\nJoe later says wants to be \"steady like Atticus,\" an impressive and wise character. He also calls the Engler residence \"Boo Radley's house,\" which is surrounded by misery and mystery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe lists the books he's stolen and sold for Ellie.\n\nMarienne (Tati Gabrielle) asks Joe if he knows where the library's first edition copy of Henrik Ibsen's drama \"Peer Gynt\" is, and mentions the play is worth $2,500.\n\nInterestingly enough, some copies of \"Peer Gynt\" listed as first editions can be found online for under $30.\n\nJoe has also taken and sold copies of works by Dickens and Shelley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarienne gives Joe a Dickens book.\n\nMarienne gives Joe a copy of Dickens' novel \"David Copperfield\" to apologize for incorrectly judging Joe for having a wealthy upbringing.\n\nThe book is fitting, considering it features a boy who grew up in poverty who turns out to be a successful novelist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe mentions \"Dragonriders of Pern,\" a children's fantasy series from the late 20th century.\n\nJoe tells Marienne that Anne McCaffrey's \"Dragonriders of Pern\" is his favorite classic fantasy series from the 1970s to the 1990s.\n\nThe first book actually came out in 1968, though the series continued until the 1990s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarienne discusses her love for \"The Little Prince.\"\n\nThe illustration Marienne submits to the children's illustration contest shows a scene from \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry.\n\nShe says the original French version of the classic is her favorite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheo compares Joe's lawn-care skills to Richard Yates' writing style.\n\nTheo (Dylan Arnold) tells Joe that his impeccable lawn \"shows Richard Yates level attention to detail.\"\n\nYates was a troubled realist writer who wrote several novels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA younger Joe can be seen reading \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\"\n\nWhen he was in a group home, Joe reads Stephen Chbosky's \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\"\n\nThe book came out in 1999 and would have been intended for an older audience than Joe would have fit into.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe sees a poetry book at Marienne's apartment.\n\nJoe sees a copy of Jericho Brown's \"The Tradition\" in Marienne's apartment.\n\nThe book is a modern poetry collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA girl asks Joe where she can find \"Narnia\" books.\n\nA child approaches Joe in the library to ask where \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" books are located.\n\nThe mid-20th-century fantasy series was written by C.S.

Joe likely identifies with it a bit, as he starts the season having \"lost\" his love Marienne and wanting to redeem himself and start with a clean slate.\n\nOn Goodreads, it's described as more of a philosophical read, following allegories rather than a direct plot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also assigns Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart.\"\n\nJoe has a collection of Poe stories with him in class, and assigns \"The Tell-Tale Heart.\"\n\nThis classic Poe story follows a man who struggles with guilt after committing a gruesome murder, a concept Joe is very familiar with and something that foreshadows the death and dismemberment of Malcolm (Stephen Hagan).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe calls Rhys' book one of the best memoirs he's read.\n\nRhys Montrose's (Ed Speelers) memoir, \"A Good Man in a Cruel World,\" follows the man's journey from coming from a broken family to succeeding after attending Oxford University.\n\nJoe says it's one of the best memoirs he's read, though he doesn't tend to read many. It might be that he sees a bit of himself in Rhys â€” Joe's had a difficult upbringing and is now teaching at a university.

S. Eliot on the shelves, which are so full of books that one section of shelving features two rows of books on each shelf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe teaches Poe's \"The Man of the Crowd\" short story.\n\nJoe assigns another Poe short story, \"The Man of the Crowd,\" partway into season four.\n\nThis is fitting timing because this story is about a narrator following a man through London. At this point, Joe has already begun getting anonymous texts from his stalker who seems to be following him through the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRhys quotes Joan Didion at Simon's funeral.\n\nWhile eulogizing Simon, Rhys quotes Joan Didion, saying \"When we mourn our losses, we also mourn, for better or for worse, ourselves.\"\n\nDidion previously appeared on this list during the second season, when Love gave Joe one of her books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalcolm's home office has a large book collection as well.\n\nThere are more modern books at Malcolm's office at home than in his school-office collection.\n\n\"Cedilla\" by Adam Mars-Jones is the second novel in a trilogy that follows a university student.\n\nA nonfiction book by Dan Jones titled \"The Plantagenets\" that covers British medieval history is visible as well.\n\nThere is also a book titled \"The Art of Italy\" on the same shelf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe (or Malcolm) has multiple copies of \"The Path to Rome.\"\n\nWhen Joe is looking at the bookshelf in his apartment, multiple copies of \"The Path to Rome\" by Hilaire Belloc can be spotted.\n\nThis is an early 20th-century autobiographical work that follows the author's long journey to Rome.\n\nIt is unclear why either Joe or Malcolm would have more than one copy of this, but Joe does see it before making the journey to the country house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe and Connie mention \"Leaving Las Vegas.\"\n\nWhen Connie's substance abuse escalates, Joe and Connie both compare the situation to \"Leaving Las Vegas.\"\n\nThis was a 1990 novel by John O'Brien, that follows an alcoholic's relationship. It was turned into a movie of the same name in 1995.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom says his personal Bible is Roosevelt's \"The Rough Riders.\"\n\nWhen Joe first meets Kate's father, Tom, he mentions his \"personal bible\" is Theodore Roosevelt's \"The Rough Riders.\"\n\nThe book is Roosevelt's account of a battle he led during the Spanish-American War in 1898.\n\nJoe calls the book a manifest destiny and white-savior story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe shows Tom a first edition of \"My Early Life.\"\n\nJoe has a first edition of Winston Churchill's \"My Early Life\" in his office to show Tom.\n\nThe book is Churchill's autobiography, and fits with the kind of books Tom is interested in throughout the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNadia looks through a shelf of classics at Joe's flat.\n\nLocated in the midle of the shelf is Ovid's \"Metamorphoses,\" a lengthy mythological poem from the Roman poet. It looks newer than some of the other books.\n\nThere is a Homer text visible and Charles Scott Sherrington's \"Man on His Nature\" philosophy book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe uses a copy of \"Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" as a hiding place.\n\nThe key to the space Joe is holding Marienne in is hiding in his copy of \"Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\"\n\nThe classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel is about a man who switches between being the friendly Dr. Jekyll to the murderous Mr. Hyde, in a clear reference to Joe's own personality-switching plotline this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe mentions the story \"Bullet in the Brain\" during the season-four finale.\n\nWhile contemplating suicide, Joe mentions the story \"Bullet in the Brain.\"\n\nThis 1995 short story by Tobias Wolff shows a man's thoughts while he is being shot, following his narration even though the bullet is already in his brain and the man will not survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom's collection of strategy books includes several bestsellers.\n\nTom has some of his book collection with him at the airplane hangar he's working in.\n\nThere are books on ciphers as well as well-known strategy books such as \"Kissinger on Kissinger\" by Winston Lord.\n\nHe also has a copy of Marcus Luttrell's \"Lone Survivor,\" a story from a former Navy Seal that was turned into a 2013 film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe has a shelf of theology and sociology books that also features a fiction author.\n\nJoe has his copy of \"The Complete Tales & Poems of Edgar Allan Poe,\" shown earlier in the season, on the same shelf as his theology and sociology books.\n\nIt's unclear why the Poe book would be placed here, other than to possibly stress how much Joe values and relates to Poe's works. After all, they are mentioned in the season.\n\nOther books on the shelf include \"The Old Testament,\" \"Greek Religion,\" and \"Women in Ancient Greece.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEdward and Nadia reference an epic poem.\n\nEdward and Nadia mention \"The Changing Light at Sandover\" while on the phone.\n\nThis is an epic poem by James Merrill that shows conversations with real and fictional spirits, in what may be a reference to Joe being shown having both real and hallucinatory interactions throughout the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNadia looks through Joe's copy of Robert Lowell's \"Day by Day.\"\n\nNadia finds a copy of Robert Lowell's \"Day by Day\" at Joe's flat.
