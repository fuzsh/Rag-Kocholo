Can you BDO the net?’ ‘I know my business,’ said The Lotus Jewel sharply. ‘A crew this size couldn’t run a Big Dumb Object.’ fannishness n. 1991 L. Niven, J. Pournelle, & M. Flynn Fallen Angels 24 Eventually she had had to watch what she said around him because she couldn’t be sure that he wouldn’t denounce her for fannishness to the University. gafiate v. 1991 L.

Be quiet. Grownups clustered with worried faces around the threedy, flickering images from far away, grave pronouncements by solemn men and women. Don't you know there’s a Crisis? Men and women are dying to save children like you. At strange places with strange names. The Bean. Left Hook. Damocles. Deimos. Phobos. No, he hadn’t known. At ten, there was little to know except that Popito was away and Mamita sometimes cried herself to sleep."
