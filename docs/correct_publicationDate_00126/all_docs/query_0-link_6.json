        "text": "American science fiction author (1947–2023)\n\nMichael Francis Flynn (December 20, 1947[1] – September 30, 2023) was an American science fiction author. Nearly all of Flynn's work falls under the category of hard science fiction, although his treatment of it can be unusual since he applied the rigor of hard science fiction to \"softer\" sciences such as sociology in works such as In the Country of the Blind. Much of his short fiction appeared in Analog Science Fiction and Fact.[2]\n\nFlynn was born in Easton, Pennsylvania to his parents, Joseph and Rita (Singley) Flynn. He had a brother, Dennis, who died in childhood. Flynn attended and graduated from Notre Dame High School, then located in Bethlehem Township.[3]\n\nHe earned a B.A. in mathematics from La Salle University in Easton, and an M.S. in topology from Marquette University in Milwaukee. He began but did not complete a Ph.D at the University of Colorado Boulder.[2][4]\n\nPrior to become a science fiction author, he was employed as an industrial quality engineer and statistician with Coors Container Corporation and Stat-A-Matrix/Oriel.[2]\n\nMain article: Michael Flynn bibliography\n\n1987 novella Eifelheim\n\n1988 novella The Forest of Time\n\n1995 novella Melodies of the Heart\n\n2005 novelette The Clapping Hands of God\n\n2007 novelette \"Dawn, and Sunset, and the Colours of the Earth\"\n\n2007 novel Eifelheim (based on the 1987 novella)\n\n2015 novelette \"The Journeyman: In the Stone House\"\n\n1991 In the Country of the Blind (won)\n\n1992 Fallen Angels (won)\n\n1997 Firestar (finalist)\n\n1999 Rogue Star (finalist)\n\n2001 Lodestar (finalist)\n\n2002 Falling Stars (finalist)\n\n2009 The January Dancer (finalist)\n\n2013 In the Lion's Mouth (nominated)\n\nFallen Angels also won the Seiun Award, and was co-written with Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle.\n\nThe novelette \"House of Dreams\" won a Theodore Sturgeon Award in 1998.\n\nThe novelette \"Quaestiones Super Caelo et Mundo\" tied with Kristine Kathryn Rusch's novella \"Recovering Apollo 8\" for the Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 2007.\n\nFirst winner of the Robert A. Heinlein Medal.[6]\n\nFlynn died at his childhood home in Easton, Pennsylvania, on September 30, 2023, at age 75. He is interred at New St. Joseph's Cemetery in Easton.[3] He was predeceased by his wife of 49 years, Margie.[7][8]\n\nFlynn, Michael. The January Dancer; Macmillan, (2008)."
