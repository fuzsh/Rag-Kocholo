Writing with insight and wit, Miller is both unsparing and sympathetic…. Miller’s deliciously engaging, gently quirky, surprisingly hopeful novel seals her spot in the pantheon of Southern fiction writers.”\n\n— Kirkus Reviews [starred review]\n\nDominic Smith\n\nThe Electric Hotel\n\n(Sarah Crichton Books, 2019)\n\n“Radiant . . . a vital and highly entertaining work about the act of creation, and about what it means to pick up and move on after you’ve lost everything.”\n\n―The New York Times\n\nVirginia Reeves\n\nThe Behavior of Love\n\n(Scribner, 2019)\n\n“[Reeves] is never so supple or interesting a writer as when she is tracing a character’s fugitive shreds of consciousness…”\n\n— The New Yorker\n\nFarid Matuk\n\nThe Real Horse\n\n(Poems, U. of Arizona Press, 2018)\n\n“A lyrical interrogation of Western notions of gender, race, and manifest destiny.”\n\n—Publisher’s Weekly\n\nFlynn Berry\n\nA Double Life\n\n(Novel: Viking, July 2018.)\n\n“Flynn Berry writes thrillingly about women raging against a world that protects cruel and careless men. . . . As shocking as it is satisfying.”\n\n—The New York Times Book Review\n\nRachel Heng\n\nSuicide Club\n\n(Novel: Henry Holt & Co, July 2018)\n\n“Heng expertly threads a ribbon of dread through her glittering vistas and gleaming characters…[This is] a complicated and promising debut that spoofs the current health culture craze even as it anticipates its appalling culmination.”\n\n—Kirkus Reviews\n\nKatie Williams\n\nTell the Machine Goodnight\n\n(Novel: Riverhead, June 2018)\n\n“The book feels like an extended episode of ‘Black Mirror,’ and certainly has that show’s taste for dark humor and high-concept philosophizing around our tech addition, though what raises it above another clever-clever slab of science fiction is that its characters are complex and contradictory and real…Williams offers a master class in not losing sight of the human element.”\n\n—New York Times Book Review\n\nCarrie Fountain\n\nI’m Not Missing\n\n(YA Novel: Flatiron, July 2018)\n\n“Part-plot-twisty thriller, part-sweet romance, and perfect for summer reading”\n\n—Bustle, Best YA Read of July\n\nKevin Powers\n\nA Shout in the Ruins\n\n(Novel: Little Brown & Co, May 2018)\n\n“In the course of just two novels, Kevin Powers has already become one of the most original and exciting voices of his generation, and A Shout in the Ruins is a singular triumph of a book.”\n\n—NPR\n\nJennifer Donaldson\n\nLies You Never Told Me\n\n(YA Novel: Razorbill May 2018)\n\n“This conversation-starting page-turner is…Fatal Attraction meets Big Little Lies.”\n\n—Kirkus Reviews\n\nAnna Maria Hong\n\nAge of Glass\n\n(Poems: Cleveland State Poetry Center, Mar 2018)\n\nWINNER OF THE 2017 CLEVELAND STATE FIRST BOOK POETRY PRIZE\n\n“Hong demonstrates in her own labyrinthine sonnets ‘the monstrous breadth’ of her poetic abilities, offering in them radical interpretations of myths and fairy tales that speak to our time and dazzle us with their wit and linguistic virtuosity.”\n\n—Rosa Alcalá\n\nAnna Maria Hong\n\nH & G\n\n(Novella: Sidebrow Books, May 2018)\n\nWINNER OF THE 2017 CLARISSA DALLOWAY PRIZE/ROOM OF HER OWN FOUNDATION\n\n“Hansel and Gretel . . . for the post-post-modern 21st century . . . a text brimming with biting wit, feminist insight, psychological incisiveness, and a hybrid narrative daring that turns genre on its head.”\n\n—John Keene\n\nBruce Snider, co-editor with Shara Lessley\n\nThe Poem’s Country\n\n(Essays: Pleiades Press, Mar 2018)\n\n“In these ravishing essays, the next generation of poets explores the influence of place on contemporary poetry, and a diverse reimagining of place emerges that both grounds and lifts us up.”\n\n—Quan Berry\n\nMatthew Dickman\n\nWonderland\n\n(Poems: WW Norton, Mar 2018)\n\n“There is an unabashed rapture to these poems about ordinary American life in the analog age. How astounding, and how perfectly troubling, to be led through this fearsome, familiar realm . . . by an intelligence as deft and buoyant as Matthew Dickman’s.”\n\n—Tracy K. Smith\n\nJosh Booton\n\nThe Miraculous Courageous\n\n(Poems: Parlor Press/Free Verse Editions, Feb 2018)\n\nWINNER 2018 NEW MEASURE POETRY PRIZE\n\n“These poems are agile, slippery . . . skewing the boundaries between lyric and monologue, vignette and scene . . . [marking] a rich and startling immersion in the mind of autism.”\n\n—Judge, Jon Thompson\n\nMeg Freitag\n\nEdith\n\n(Poems: Boaat Press, Nov 2017)\n\n“Anyone who has ever loved anything will love this book.”\n\n—Dean Young\n\nTaisia Kitaiskaia\n\nLiterary Witches\n\n(Illustrated Collaboration with Katy Horan: Seal Press, Oct 2017)\n\n“Part portal into the superpowers of irreverent female literary heroines and part illustrated almanac of fun facts dispatched through the lens of the ultimate mystical female archetype . . . enormously enjoyable, rich in information, and visually brilliant.”\n\n—Lisa Congdon\n\nRivers Solomon\n\nAn Unkindness of Ghosts\n\n(Novel: Akashic Books, Oct 2017)\n\n“Immediately immersive and sophisticated…This is a phenomenal piece of work.”\n\n—Lee Child\n\nJesse Donaldson\n\nOn Homesickness\n\n(Essays: Vandalia Press UWV, Sept 2017)\n\n“A wonderful prose poem, a beautiful meditation on homesickness and connection to place, and a celebration of Kentucky and that strange and undeniable connection that Kentuckians have to the state.”\n\n—Silas House\n\nSam Sax\n\nMadness\n\n(Poems: Penguin Random House, Oct 2017)\n\n“MADNESS is a wild, resolute book. This is a fine, otherworldly madness … an astounding debut.”\n\n—Terrance Hayes, judge National Poetry Series\n\nTaisia Kitaiskaia\n\nAsk Baba Yaga\n\n(Otherworldly Advice: Andrews McMeel, Sept 2017)\n\n“A beautiful, strange, troubled, moving piece of fresh air. Pick up this book, turn the pages, inhale, and feel ready to march back into everyday troubles with renewed courage and hope.”\n\n—Edward Carey\n\nMICHAEL MCGRIFF\n\nEarly Hour\n\n(Poems: Copper Canyon, Aug 2017)\n\n“It’s [McGriff’s] language that keeps you reading along, transfixed.”\n\n—New York Times Book Review\n\nBRIAN MCGREEVY\n\nThe Lights\n\n(Novel: Rare Bird Books, May 2017)\n\n“The Lights begins in the familiar territory of an MFA program, but the narrator’s meditations immediately stretch far beyond it. This is a novel about temptation, validation, and all the different routes (and detours) one might take on her way to becoming an artist.”\n\n—Chelsea Hodson\n\nBRIAN VAN REET\n\nSpoils\n\n(Novel: Lee Boudreaux Books, April 2017)\n\n“A fine piece of writing that should stand in the front ranks of recent war novels.”\n\n—Kirkus starred review\n\nMARY MILLER\n\nAlways Happy Hour\n\n(Stories: W.W. Norton, January 2017)\n\n“. . . like drinking an Old Fashioned. It’s strong with a sweet burn, and after each taste you immediately want more. Mary Miller writes well about sex, drugs and white bikinis. “\n\n—Helen Ellis\n\nKELLY LUCE\n\nPull Me Under\n\n(Novel: Farrar, Straus & GIroux, November 2016)\n\n“PULL ME UNDER is a strange and very appealing novel, a journey to Japan and the primal scene of the main character’s self— which, like a volcano, may have already blown its top.”\n\n—Rachel Kushner\n\nDONIKA ROSS KELLY\n\nBestiary\n\n(Poems: Graywolf Press, November 2016)\n\nWINNER OF THE 2015 CAVE CANEM POETRY PRIZE\n\n“These poems are gut-punches, heart-shredders, eaters-of-soul-stuff. Love, abuse, loneliness, dogs: it’s all here, everything that matters.”\n\n—BookRiot\n\nMIRIAM BIRD GREENBERG\n\nIn the Volcano’s Mouth\n\n(Poems: Pitt Poetry Series, October 2016)\n\nWINNER 2015 AGNES LYNCH STARRETT POETRY PRIZE\n\n“These poems do what the best poetry sometimes does: reveal and deepen our understanding of the strangeness in the ordinary. And do so in language clear as a bell.”\n\n—Ed Ochester, judge\n\nMATTHEW & MICHAEL DICKMAN\n\nBrother\n\n(Poems: Faber & Faber UK, September 2016)\n\n“Michael’s poems are interior, fragmentary, and austere . . . Matthew’s [spill] over with pop-cultural references and exuberant carnality . . . together, the resonance of the work is amplified.”\n\n—The New Yorker\n\nJESSE DONALDSON\n\nThe More They Disappear\n\n(Novel: McMillan/Thos Dunn Books, August 2016)\n\n“This feels like what Denis Johnson, Richard Price, or even Graham Greene might have written if they had the precise feel for the region that gave us bluegrass and bourbon.”\n\n—Daniel Torday\n\nFLYNN BERRY\n\nUnder the Harrow\n\n(Novel: Penguin, June 2016)\n\n“Once I started reading . . . I couldn’t stop.
