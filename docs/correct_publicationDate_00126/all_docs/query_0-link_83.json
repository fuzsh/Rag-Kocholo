        "text": "I didn’t know how trapped I was\n\nin my own busyness until,\n\nwalking past a quiet lake\n\nand up through a lush spruce forest\n\nI felt how with each step toward tree line\n\nmore calendar squares disappeared\n\nand all my lists dissolved until\n\nI was nowhere but wading\n\nthrough waist-high bluebells\n\nwith corn lilies rising above my head.\n\nHow still my mind was then, still,\n\nas I traversed creeks and clambered\n\nover fallen trees. Still as I climbed\n\nto the place where the clear water\n\nstreams down gray cliffs and yellow\n\nmonkey flower flourishes on the banks.\n\nI was bathed with gratefulness.\n\nIs it true that to know this freedom\n\nonce is to be able to carry it\n\nlike a touchstone in my body?\n\nWill the larkspur have any dominion\n\ntomorrow while I’m trapped in a deadline?\n\nWill the scent of summer’s last wild roses\n\nreturn when I’m scrambling\n\nfor just ten more minutes?\n\nOh freedom, I long to contain you.\n\nThat thought makes me laugh.\n\nYet it’s true. I long to find myself\n\nmid-hustle still linked to the gurgling stream,\n\nits waters so cold I can’t help but gasp.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFor two hours this morning\n\nI practiced being a tree.\n\nSat in one place in the sun\n\nand did not move. Offered\n\nshade to ground below.\n\nDid not speak. Did not plan.\n\nAnd though no bird chose\n\nto nest in my lap, was not\n\naverse to such nesting.\n\nImagined eating light.\n\nTo anyone else, it looked\n\nlike a woman sitting on\n\na wooden chair. Need\n\nto keep practicing before\n\neven coming close to\n\nthe proficiency of that\n\nspindly crooked spruce\n\nover there.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nfor P\n\nAll day I imagine my love\n\nis a great ocean that lifts you\n\non a warm and gentle tide\n\nso all you need to do today\n\nis float. Float and let yourself\n\nbe carried. Float and know\n\nthat in this hour nothing\n\nneed be done. Perhaps\n\nif you are still today, even\n\nfor a moment, you can feel\n\nthe way these distant waves\n\nare near as your own sweet breath.\n\nThe weight of all that scares you\n\ndoesn’t change. I know. I imagine\n\nI lift that, too. Lift it all until\n\nyou are certain no matter\n\nhow much things change,\n\nyou are not alone.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHe walks along the river’s edge,\n\nboots up to his knees, pitchfork\n\nbalanced on his shoulder,\n\nhis handwoven bucket hat\n\nbalanced on his head. And\n\nI fall in love again. Not with\n\nthe man I married, but with\n\nthe man he’s become—\n\nthe man who has pruned\n\nthe coyote willows for days,\n\nfor years, so we can see\n\nthe river as it changes from clear\n\nto bright red from the storms.\n\nWatch as it runs clear again.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen I forget that the whole world\n\nis holy, even the tiny dark bugs\n\nthat slip through window screens\n\nand flock and stick to kitchen lights,\n\neven the charred black remains of forest,\n\neven the river as it floods bright red,\n\neven when my cheeks are tear-stained\n\nand my body tightens with fear,\n\nthat is when a kind letter from a stranger\n\narrives in the mail, or the rabbit will stand\n\non his back legs to nibble on mint,\n\nor the meadow will blaze with the day’s\n\nlast slant of sunlight and my heart opens\n\nso wide that inside the fear rises praise.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThough I love this high desert,\n\nI am a lake walking amidst\n\nthe cactus and the pinyon pine.\n\nI am sunsets on flat water\n\nand waves in the spring.\n\nI bring my white trillium soul\n\nto the arroyo and let dry sand\n\nrun through my fingers.\n\nThey never leave me,\n\nthese Wisconsin summers,\n\neven though I left them when\n\nI was a barefoot girl,\n\neven though I’ve made a home\n\namongst red rock cliffs and empty\n\nriver beds where the gray trunks\n\nof juniper twist in deep curves\n\nand red-tailed hawks spiral\n\nmaking visible the wind.\n\nHow surprising it is to discover now\n\nin my silvering years some new\n\ninsight into what it means to belong:\n\nhow sometimes we choose,\n\nhow sometimes we are chosen.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWe float side by side on the pond for an hour—\n\nyou in a tube, me on a paddleboard,\n\nboth of us deep in our books.\n\nBut even immersed in another world,\n\nI slip more deeply in love with this one\n\nin which I’m your mother and you\n\nmy girl and our stories are woven\n\nso closely together that even before\n\nI flip the page of tomorrow, I know\n\nfor certain I will love you even more.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPeople think it’s a moment of Eureka!\n\nBut it’s more like a wave,\n\nsaid the mathematician,\n\nand though he was speaking\n\nof inventing new math,\n\nI thought of discovering new love,\n\na wave of startling amplitude,\n\nthe thrill of energy passing through,\n\na trough of fear and a crest\n\nof yes. A whole lotta blue.\n\nI don’t remember much\n\nof physics, but I recall\n\nthe surge, the crash,\n\nthe holding my breath.\n\nI remember the certainty\n\nI would drown, the equal terror\n\nof finding myself on dry land.\n\nIt’s not just a flash of insight, he said.\n\nI thought of how long I’ve been\n\nsolving for love.\n\nYeah, I said.

Perhaps you could guess\n\nwhat I wished for. Aren’t I always\n\nlonging for peace in this world?\n\nBut there is so much of me\n\nnow you do not know.\n\nLike how today, when I got\n\nbehind the car going twenty-seven\n\nmiles under the speed limit,\n\nI didn’t call him an idiot.\n\nI just went slower. See?\n\nThings change. Even this woman\n\nwho is still throwing rocks\n\nin the same river.\n\nOnly now the splash\n\nmakes me both laugh and cry.\n\nAnd now, when I drive\n\nbehind a slow, slow person,\n\nI can’t not think\n\nof what wishes\n\nthey might write.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
