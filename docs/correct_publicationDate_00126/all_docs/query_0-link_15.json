Nearly all of his work falls under the category of hard SF, although his treatment of it can be unusual since he applied the rigor of hard science fiction to \"softer\" sciences such as sociology in works such as In the Country of the Blind. Much of his short fiction appeared in Analog.\n\nHe was a popular speaker at conventions, often presenting fascinating one-person talks relating to statistics (yes, it can be done!) or another interest of his, history, especially Medieval history.\n\nEntry in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction.\n\nAwards, Honors and GoHships:\n\n1987 -- 1987 Best Novella Hugo nomination\n\n1988 -- 1988 Best Novella Hugo nomination\n\n1991 -- Balticon 25, Compton Crook Award\n\n1992 -- Balticon 26, MC at Con*Stellation XI\n\n1995 -- 1995 Best Novella Hugo nomination\n\n1998 -- Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award\n\n2003 -- Robert A.
