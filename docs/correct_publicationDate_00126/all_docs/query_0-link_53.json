        "text": "On this edition of Parallax Views, investigative journalist Ken Silverstein returns to the show hot off the major story he broke for The New Republic last week: \"Off Leash: Inside the Secret, Global, Far-Right Group Chat | The New Republic\". Ken has blown the lid off a secret chat group created by Erik Prince, the founder of the controversial private military company Blackwater, that includes a who's who of influential figures of the global right-wing including Congressman Ryan Zinke, Congressman Mark Green, Tucker Carlson, Gen. Michael Flynn, and many others. Silverstein's reporting on this provides an insight into where a number of major figures, including some with intelligence and military connection, stand in 2024 behind-closed-doors on issues ranging including Iran, the Israel-Hamas War/Gaza War, Israel/Palestine, MAGA vs. the Democratic Party, U.S. foreign policy, and much, much more. He's found communications that reveal what friend of the show, American Conservative contributor, and Senior Advisor at the Quincy Institute Kelley Vlahos describes as a \"batshit crazy chat group that includes Erik Prince, Lara Logan, and every rightwing grifter, politician, influencer, ex-military psycho\" that want to \"nuke, napalm, and 'take out' everyone.\" There was even discussion in the group of rounding up the American right's domestic enemies for Nuremberg-style tribunals. And, on the U.S. foreign policy front, there were calls for covert assassination of political leaders from countries seen as adversarial to the U.S. There were even inclinations in the chat group towards the idea of using nuclear weapons against Gaza. There's also some opaque discussion of Erik Prince having \"the right people in place\" to deal with Iran, which many of the members of Off-Leash have hawkish foreign policy views on, and some rather interesting discussion pertaining to the plane crash that killed Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. Talk of the need for a MAGA \"revolution\" and fighting against a cabal of Marxists, Islamists, and globalists that many members of the chat view as destroying the U.S. and Western civilization are also prominent in the communications that Silverstein uncovered. We'll discuss all of this and much more in the conversation, but its highly recommended you consult both Ken's original report on this for The New Republic AND his Washington Babylon Substack which will be covering this further going forward. You'll also hear us discuss Donald Trump and domestic repression, Russiagate, the RFK Jr. connection to Off-Leash, Ken's thoughts on President Joe Biden vs. Donald Trump, and much, much more.\n\nTake back your heart health today and increase your athletic performance with Cardio Miracle at http://HighPowerHeart.com The world needs to know the truth that fake history has concealed.

First, they report on the Democrats' meltdown over the Bronx Trump rally, highlighting the frenzy and opposition being stirred up. They reveal how various organizations, funded by dark money, are paying outside protestors to oppose the rally, exposing the lengths to which some will go to stifle support for Trump. Despite the opposition, there's palpable excitement from \"We the People NYC\" about Trump's visit to the South Bronx. The hosts capture the enthusiasm and anticipation among local supporters who are eager to welcome the former president. A disturbing threat made against Trump by a Democrat in the Bronx is also discussed, with Jeffrey and Shannon analyzing Scavino's Twitter post that brought the threat to light. They meticulously follow the timestamps and connections of Scavino's posts, leading to an intel drop that offers further proof of the ongoing political manipulation. In a lighter segment, they cover Michael Flynn's appearance in an Alex Stein skit, where Stein humorously smashes a fake \"Hunter Biden\" laptop. The duo explores how Flynn's interaction with key figures surrounding the real laptop story brings new insights into its sudden disappearance. Shifting gears, they review yesterday's episode of \"The Five\" on FOX, where the hosts hilariously dissected how \"the Left can't meme.\" Gutfeld explains the psychology behind successful memes, emphasizing that effective memes contain an element of truth, while those from the Left often deconstruct it. The discussion then moves to the optics being pushed about climate change's impact on the Black community, with Jeffrey and Shannon critically examining the narratives and agendas at play. Finally, they address the Alito hoopla, revealing it as a psyop connected to the Appeal to Heaven Flag, and conclude with a powerful affirmation: the truth is, Trump is a leader, and it is obvious to anyone willing to see. Join Jeffrey and Shannon for an insightful and entertaining episode that peels back the layers of political theater, reveals hidden connections, and celebrates the power of truth and leadership. --- Keywords: MG Show, Jeffrey, Shannon, Bronx Trump Rally, Democrats Meltdown, Dark Money, Outside Protestors, We the People NYC, Scavino Twitter, Threat to Trump, Intel Drop, Michael Flynn, Alex Stein, Hunter Biden Laptop, The Five, FOX, Left Can't Meme, Gutfeld, Memes, Climate Change, Black Community, Alito Hoopla, Psyop, Appeal to Heaven Flag, Trump Leadership, Political Theater, Truth Unveiled\n\nOn this episode of \"Prime Time with Alex Stein,\" Alex is in studio discussing the ongoing Boeing airplane crisis, as ANOTHER plane malfunctioned this morning.

First up, they expose Paula C Blades, a notorious doxxer from the early days, now part of a psyop aimed at distracting and dismantling the MAGA movement. Jeffrey and Shannon uncover the sinister strategies employed to undermine the movement's unity and strength. Next, they delve into Jesse Watters' bombshell report, revealing FBI documents that authorized the use of deadly force if necessary during the Mar-a-Lago raid. This shocking disclosure raises serious questions about the tactics used in this high-profile operation. The spotlight then shifts to Michael Flynn, who boasts of receiving eight subpoenas. While the specifics remain undisclosed, speculation abounds about a potential connection to prosecuting Arizona Electors. Jeffrey and Shannon dig into these tantalizing questions that demand answers. Christina Bobb, Trump's lawyer, provides a firsthand account of the Mar-a-Lago raid, sharing her experiences and shedding light on the legal and procedural irregularities that occurred. The hosts then address the false narratives spread by pundits who falsely claimed that roadside support for Trump was actually for Biden, forcing them to retract their posts. This segment highlights the media's ongoing attempts to distort public perception. In a poignant moment, a video replay reminds viewers of Trump's words addressing the January 6 riot on January 7, 2021, underscoring his call for peace and order during a tumultuous time. Adding a literary twist, Shady reads Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" drawing connections to Julie Kelly's analysis on her American Thinker website. This segment creatively compares the story's theme of a guilty conscience to the corruption of Judge Mechan's daughter, suggesting that the judge's hidden guilt might be similarly exposed. Finally, the episode uncovers the long-standing corruption of Judge Mechan's daughter, revealing her collusion with Adam Schiff and other deep state operatives. Jeffrey and Shannon bring these hidden connections to light, exposing the entrenched corruption within the system. Join Jeffrey and Shannon for a riveting journey through today's most pressing issues, where they unmask deceptions, defend the truth, and hold the powerful accountable.

No, we're still here, fighting fascism at home and abroad. And still with us, unfortunately, is Trump's actual army of far-right Christian nationalists determined to destroy our democracy from within. What's needed to fight a holy war? Another holy war, if your faith is in empathy and science. In this End Times-themed discussion (in honor of the 4.8 earthquake striking near Trump's Bedminister golf course, opening up the gates of hell just in time for the election, and the solar eclipse that blinded the latest winners of the Darwin Awards), we discuss how to protect democracy against a transnational crime syndicate wielding Christian nationalism as its weapon. We also review the must-watch documentary \"Bad Faith,\" based on the book by former Gaslit Nation guest and journalist Anne Nelson, titled Shadow Network: Media, Money, and the Secret Hub of the Radical Right. We also look at Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s campaign to help Trump come to power, Michael Flynn's propaganda tour to energize authoritarian voters, the most dangerous men in the Biden administration who should have been replaced long ago, and why, in a time of genocide and other existential threats, straight white old guys are no longer a “safe bet.” But we'll vote for Biden anyway, because we don't have the time or resources to fight for survival and against a second, never-ending Trump regime. This week's bonus episode, exclusively for our supporters at the Truth-teller level and higher, is a discussion of Evangelicals and Israel – staunch allies for opportunistic reasons. They also constitute a crucial element in Trump's potential Electoral College victory, where Biden barely squeaked by thanks to a mere 44,000 votes scattered across Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Yes, it was that close. So don't forget to pre-order the documentary Bad Faith, organize a watch party with friends and neighbors, and complete the recommended steps in the Gaslit Nation 2024 Survival Guide.
