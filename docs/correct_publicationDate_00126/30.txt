(1947 – September 30, 2023)

Michael Francis Flynn was an American statistician and SF author. Nearly all of his work falls under the category of hard SF, although his treatment of it can be unusual since he applied the rigor of hard science fiction to "softer" sciences such as sociology in works such as In the Country of the Blind. Much of his short fiction appeared in Analog.

He was a popular speaker at conventions, often presenting fascinating one-person talks relating to statistics (yes, it can be done!) or another interest of his, history, especially Medieval history.
