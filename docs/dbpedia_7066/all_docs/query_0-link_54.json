        "text": "If a gentleman had no sons, and his estate was entailed on male heirs only, then that estate could be inherited by a distant relative. This was the case with Mr. Bennet's estate in Pride & Prejudice, which would go to Mr. Collins as soon as Mr. Bennet died; an unexpected windfall for Mr. Collins, but a constant concern for Mrs Bennet:\n\n\"...my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.''\n\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children.\"\n\n[Chapter 13, Pride & Prejudice, by Jane Austen]\n\nYounger sons who were not as lucky as Edward Austen or Mr. Collins would have to marry a wife with money or provide themselves with some kind of occupation.\n\nMarrying money\n\n\"The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\" [Chapter 26, Pride & Prejudice, by Jane Austen]\n\nIncome, status and financial independence were topics of vital interest during the Regency period, and one way for a younger son to secure an independent income and maintain their social status was to marry money.\n\nThis particular subject was touched upon in a lighthearted way during a conversation between Elizabeth Bennet and Colonel Fitzwilliam:\n\n\"...A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?\"\n\n\"These are home questions -- and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\"\n\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\"\n\n\"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\"\n\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\n\n[Chapter 33, Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen]\n\nWhen invested, (usually at 4% or 5% per year) a lump sum would produce an annual income for a married couple. In this particular case, a fifty thousand pound dowry brought to a marriage would generate a return of between £2,000 and £2,500 per year, which was a comfortable income at the time.\n\nNot all females were lucky enough to have such a large dowry. In Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennet and her four sisters would share £5,000, and only then after her parents' death. The £1,000 they each took to their marriage would only add £40 or £50 per year to the household income, so they wouldn't be attractive propositions for a younger son with little or no money of his own. This is why Mary King, with her £10,000 inheritance, was more attractive to Mr Wickham than Elizabeth's paltry £1,000 sometime in the future.\n\nElsewhere in Pride and Prejudice, Miss Darcy's dowry was £30,000, which would produce an annual income of £1200-£1500, while the man who was brave enough to marry Miss Bingley would receive £20,000. (£800-£1000 per year)\n\nJane Austen herself had no dowry at all, and this prevented her from marrying at least one gentleman who needed to marry money.\n\nA few women didn't just have a dowry, but a generous inheritance. One of the best known examples is Sarah Sophia Fane, who is better known to us as Lady Jersey, one of the famous patronesses of Almacks.\n\nSarah Fane's grandfather was Robert Child, senior partner of Child's Bank. When his only daughter eloped, he disinherited her to stop his money falling into his son-in-law's hands. Instead, the money went to his granddaughter. On his death she received the estate of Osterley Park, a senior partnership in the bank and a considerable annual income. Even after making generous gifts of money to her father, brother and two sisters, she still received an annual income of around £60,000. When she married George Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey, in 1805, he changed his name to George Child Villiers.\n\nThe idea of changing your surname when you received an inheritance wasn't always stipulated as a condition of the will but was a way of honouring the memory of the benefactor.\n\nThe Genteel Professions\n\n\"We never could agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family. They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The law was allowed to be genteel enough: many young men, who had chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it...\"\n\n[Chapter 19, Sense & Sensibility, by Jane Austen]\n\nAnyone who earned money from business or trade would find it difficult to be considered a gentleman. So how could a younger son earn money and yet still keep, or even improve, his valuable social status?\n\nThere were a small number of acceptable occupations for younger sons that provided them with a source of income and yet still allowed them to maintain their status as a gentleman. In many cases they received money in a way that was not technically considered \"paid employment\" at the time, thus preserving their position in society. These were:\n\nAn Officer in the British Army\n\nAn Officer in the Royal Navy\n\nA Clergyman in the Established Church\n\nA position in the Government, Diplomatic or Civil Service\n\nA Barrister at Law or a Judge\n\nA Physician\n\nTo obtain one of these positions either required a university education, sometimes followed by further expensive training, the purchase of an expensive commission, or contacts within the government, which put most of these occupations out of the reach of a working man's son.\n\nA traditional pattern followed by some families suggested that if the eldest son inherited the family estate, then a second son would join the army, a third son would go into the Law and the fourth would take Holy orders. Of course, this traditional pattern made no allowances for personal preferences or inclinations, and the pattern was by no means universal.\n\nA real life example of a similar pattern was the family of James Stopford, the 3rd Earl of Courtown.\n\nHe and his wife had six sons and one daughter. Their two eldest sons died in infancy, so it was their third born son, James, who stood to inherit the earldom. He spent some time as a Member of Parliament for Wexford before he took over his father's title and estate.\n\nTheir fourth son, Edward, chose the army. He became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Scots Fusilier Guards. Their fifth son, Henry Scott Stopford, went into the church and eventually became the Archdeacon of Leighlin, and chaplain to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Their sixth son, Montagu, joined the navy. He rose through the ranks to be a Vice Admiral.\n\nThe following chapters will explore these occupations for gentlemen in more detail."
