        "text": "Alice Austen’s life – from 1866 to 1952 – spanned the rise and fall of Staten Island high society. During the post-Civil War boom, the families of Staten Island industrialists and stockbrokers competed with Manhattan’s nouveaux riches for displays of extravagant wealth. Alice held her own among this set without the benefit of a great fortune. She was a popular member of the Island’s elite, whose life of leisure she captured with her camera. By the turn of the 20th century, factories and working-class families began to surround her family’s home, and socially ambitious families moved away to Westchester County, Long Island and New Jersey.\n\nAlice Austen’s Staten Island\n\nHis wife, Elizabeth Townsend Austen, named their home Clear Comfort, and it became Alice’s sanctuary. She photographed Clear Comfort throughout her life, and her photographs, which presented an edenic vision of a bygone era, helped save the house from demolition in the 1970s. The Alice Austen House is now a museum and National Historic LGBTQ Site.\n\nAlice Austen was named “Elizabeth Alice” after her grandmother. The photograph (at right) of Alice with her grandmother on the piazza of Clear Comfort is dated July 1885 and is one of Alice’s earliest images. Her grandmother died two years later at the age of 74.\n\nAlice’s most celebrated ancestor was Peter Townsend—her grandmother’s grandfather—who was a Revolutionary War hero. In 1778, Townsend’s Sterling Iron Works manufactured the massive “Great Chain” that spanned the Hudson River at West Point and kept the British fleet from traveling farther north. A link from the Great Chain, an Austen family prized possession, was prominently displayed over the parlor fireplace (below).\n\nAlice took this photograph of her mother, Alice Cornell Austen, when her mother was in her late fifties. Plagued by ill health, Alice’s mother died in 1900 at the age of 62.\n\nAlice’s parents, Alice Cornell Austen and Edward Stopford Munn, married in 1863 and lived in a house known as Woodbine Cottage, a few blocks away from Clear Comfort. Shortly after Alice was born in 1866, her parents separated, and Alice’s mother moved home and reclaimed her maiden name. For reasons unknown, the Austen family alleged that Munn had abandoned his wife and child to return to his native England, but Munn lived in Brooklyn until his death in 1879 at the age of 52. The couple never divorced.\n\nAlice and her mother shared a room on the first floor of Clear Comfort, and their relationship was as close as their small, crowded room would suggest. Mama’s letters to Alice are filled with local gossip, shopping reports, maternal fretting—“You poor child to go in for rowing and tennis at once, please don’t work too hard”—and encouragement—“You certainly have accomplished a great deal . . . surely you are intended to succeed in life, and see the world.”\n\nThe Austens’ servants were Irish, Scottish or German immigrants. Relying on a wood-burning stove, gas lamps and well water, they cooked, did laundry, and cleaned the house, which although small, was filled chock-a-block with dust-gathering objects. Katie (right) was especially devoted to the family’s pets. The servants slept in two small attic rooms in close quarters with family members.\n\nThe Austens’ dogs—Punch, a pug, and Chico, a Chihuahua—often appear in Alice’s photographs, but here, at bath time, they take center stage. They were full-fledged family members, as Mama Austen’s letters to Alice demonstrate. In 1890, she wrote, “Punch misses you. . . [He] burst through one of the middle room panes, shivering it to pieces, the piazza was covered with glass, he strolled out unhurt.”\n\nThis photograph of Alice with her Aunt Minn (Mary Haggerty Austen) and Minn’s second husband, the Danish-born sea captain Oswald Muller, was taken by Oswald, who taught Alice the rudiments of photography. Alice’s earliest dated photograph is 1884, and there are a series of family portraits taken around that date that may represent his camera lessons. Although Alice later claimed she had learned to use the camera as a young child, it is more likely that she began to photograph in 1884, the year that Aunt Minn and Uncle Oswald moved to Clear Comfort after many years at sea."
