On board were the ALLEY family who came as \"Free\" passengers: Thomas 39, Phoebe 39, Elizabeth 18, William 16, Annie 13, Albert 6, Phoebe 3, and Thomas aged 1. Thomas was to go \"to E. Booker, Maryborough\"; Elizabeth was to go \"to Mrs Harrington, Maryborough\"; and Annie was to go \"to Mrs William Clements, Maryborough\". This information was obtained from the Passenger List.\n\n~~~~~\n\nAt about 11.45 pm on Wednesday, a four-roomed cottage, the property of Mrs P. A. Alley, situated in Excelsior road, was destroyed by fire. Thomas Alley, the husband of Mrs Alley, owner of the cottage, stated to Acting-Sergeant J. J. Clark, that on the night in question he was sleeping in a room in the house and was awakened by someone calling out \"Fire\". He immediately got up and saw that the ceiling of the front room was on fire, and the house was full of smoke, almost suffocating him, and it was with considerable difficulty that he got out of the house in time. By this time the fire had a good hold of the cottage, and he was unable to do anything to save the building. The fire appeared to have originated in the ceiling of the front room, and the only way Mr Alley can account for the fire is that the rats, which were very numerous, may have taken a box of matches up to the ceiling. Other articles, such as a lady's belt and an apron had been found in the ceiling on previous occasions, having apparently been dragged there by rats. The Fire Brigade arrived on the scene and extinguished the fire, but the building was destroyed, with the exception of an old kitchen at the back. The house and furniture were insured for Â£100 in the office of the Alliance Insurance Co. (W. D. Ross, local agent). Mr Alley estimates his loss at about Â£130. Mrs and Miss Alley were both away from home at the time.\n\nMr D. Brown and Mr T. Barson, neighbours of the Alleys, were driving home at about 11.45 pm on Wednesday, and saw smoke coming out of the roof of Mr Alley's house, and saw Mt Alley out in the garden putting on his clothes. They managed to save a few articles, but the progress of the fire soon checked their efforts.\n\n...
