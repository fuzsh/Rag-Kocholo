        "text": "PROSPECT\n\nThe name Prospect owes its origins to Sir Edward Fisher who called this place\n\nFisherstown, then later Fishers Prospect and finally now Prospect.\n\nSir Edward was son of Sir John Fisher who was one of the first to benefit from\n\nthe Plantation of Ulster and Sir Edward Fisher was one of those who benefited from the\n\nPlantation of Wexford.\n\nIn 1611 James 1st granted Sir Edward the townlands from Tara Hill, Kildermot,\n\nBallymoney and to Courtown including the River of Ounavarra and Tara Hill itself\n\nand all the lands in between estimated approx. 1,500 acres. For all this he had to\n\nrender yearly to His Majesty and his successors £8.\n\nSir Edward Fisher entered his lands with the help of the Sheriff of Wexford in\n\nMay 1613 by breaking down the doors of those who resided there and turning them\n\nout.\n\nSir Edward set about building his house without delay, as part of the Plantation\n\nconditions of those with 1,500 acres or more was to build a castle or stone house\n\nmeasuring more than 30′ by 24’and 30’high battlements and to be built within four\n\nyears. This castle was built of red brick, stone and slate. It is shown on the map of the\n\nBarony of Gorey as a Tower house with battlements that had a fine view of Tara Hill and\n\nsurrounded by a wall approx. 110′ by 72′. This house was known as the Castle of\n\nProspect.\n\nSir Edward also built a residence close to Dublin in the Phoenix Park. It later became a vice regal lodge; this site is now occupied by the magazine fort.\n\nThere were houses to the north and south of Prospect Castle in the field known as Old Town.\n\nDuring ploughing in 1938, 1966 and 2010 bricks, stones and slates and several bits of\n\npottery and evidence of population were discovered.\n\nA church was also built around the same time on the site now occupied by\n\nProspect Graveyard. Church records show that in 1615 the church was in good repair\n\nand the rector was Rev. Matthew Lee. There were several traders here including John\n\nTodd (a clothier in 1641), a forge and a pound in 1840 and it continued in use up to a much later date, it was situated at the north west side of the graveyard.\n\nSir Edward was elected a member of Parliament in 1613 and nominated a Burger of Gorey in 1619. On the 27th November 1627 some alarm was caused to the residents of the district by the then appearances of a great number of ships off the coast, Fisher was absent but on his return to his castle at Prospect he was informed of the event by two of his tenants named Hinchley, they reported approximately fifty ships. Rumours of an invasion from Spain was current at this time and hence the anxiety of the residents. It was surmised that the storm the previous night might have driven the fleet off course. A report was sent by Fisher to Lord Esmonde, Governor of Duncannon Fort, who was staying at his estate at Limerick (Kilanerin) near Gorey.\n\nSir Edward died in 1631 and the estate passed to his 5th daughter who married Sir Edward Chichester. His eldest daughter married Sir Walsingham Cooke who lived at Courtown and was High Sheriff of Wexford in 1630.\n\nThe castle was partially destroyed in 1641 when the “pent up fury of the disposed broke like a storm across the land”. In 1654 the castle was shown on the “Down Survey” as decayed.\n\nIn 1659 the population of the Prospect Estate consisted of 18 Englishmen and 44 Irishmen.\n\nThe estate passed in 1711 from John Chichester to James Stopford, the father of the 1st Earl of Courtown.\n\nIn 1769 a new church was built on the Courtown Demesne, Kiltennel church. A\n\npart of the wall of the old church at Prospect was standing in 1878 and contained a\n\nstone on which was sculpted the Arms of Sir Edward Fisher.\n\nThe site of Prospect Castle is situated in the field known as Coarse Meadow on the lands now known as Prospect House and farm, there still stands the remains of a stone cottage and bridge over the stream which was the toll house and bridge near the castle on the old road to Gorey.\n\nThe old road ran from the back of the coastguard station through Prospect coming out at Clonattin the old road to Gorey.\n\nThe present Prospect House was built circa 1830 by Lord Courtown for one of his valued stewards or workers, probably Benjamin Godkin or\n\nSamuel Binnions.\n\nThere is a ghost of a child that still walks the hallways of Prospect House that has’\n\nbeen seen by several people over the years."
