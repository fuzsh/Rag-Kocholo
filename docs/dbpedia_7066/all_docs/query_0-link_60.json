        "text": "135 ’I had no time to call this evening, as we were kept at Downing St until 6.50 pm. Briefly: (1) The only thing that will go before the British Parliament is the document of settlement. It is a case of “take it or leave it”. There can be no amendments. The document will be opposed in Dublin by de Valera, and there will be a hot debate in Dail Eireann, which may end in a break up. (2) Griffith has written a satisfactory letter as to the Second Chamber &c which is to be published. (3) All matters regarding taxation &c must be discussed in Ireland. (4) The constitution of the new Irish State is to be settled in Ireland, always saving clauses i & ii in the settlement. Clause ii ensures an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. (5) The Govt seemed to think that clause 16 was sufficient to protect our interests.\n\n‘The truth is that none of us wd look at this “settlement” or acquiesce in it, if we had a willing alternative. But the only alternative is civil war. We pressed the Govt about land legislation, of course, but I am not sure what will be done, although all are agreed that something ought to be done. Clause 5 [sic] sufficiently protects our Cathedrals, as the ultimate appeal is to the Privy Council.’ (Bernard to Oranmore, 7.40 p.m., 7 Dec. 1921 (Oranmore family papers))"
