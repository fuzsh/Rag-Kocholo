        "text": "(1) Although, in the continuation, we show James as son of King Charles II, TCP (Monmouth) reports that: \"His great beauty, so unlike that of the King his reputed father, makes it more than probable that he was (as often considered) a son of Robert Sydney, one of a handsome race noted for their gallantries. The Duke is also said to have had a mole on the upper lip which was a characteristic feature of that family.\" Robert Sydney, a younger son of the Earl of Leicester, was the lover of his mother Lucy Walter before the King. When he was aged about 8, James was placed under the charge of William Crofts, Baron of Saxham and was given Crofts as his family name until his marriage.\n\n(2) The Duke claimed that his father (King Charles II) had married his mother (Lucy Walters) and, after King Charles died, had himself proclaimed as King. He was executed after defeat by King James II at the battle of Sedgemoor (06.07.1685). His title was forfeited but his wife had been declared Duchess in her own right so that the dukedom continued after her death."
