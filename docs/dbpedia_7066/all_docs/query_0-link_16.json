Though in 1871 there was a Robert F and wife Lucy H with children born in these years:\n\nForename Birth Sex\n\nEmily M 1847 F\n\nMary L 1855 F\n\nFrancis J 1858 M\n\nHenrietta J 1860 F\n\nEleanor Anna 1863 F\n\nBut this got me nowhere!\n\nSo I tried to select baptisms between 1840 and 1860 with Parents names of Edward and Julia from Ancestry and this produced:\n\nBapt Birth Name Parents Father’s job Where\n\n26 Jan 1842 3 Nov 1841 Henry Edward Edward & Julia Maria Capt R.N.

St Geo Han Sq\n\nAnd that was all - and exactly agreed with the births reported in Burke’s peerage.\n\nIt would have been better if Edith’s baptism had an image of the register/BT. But one was found on FindMyPast for a change, though only if you used the Hertfordshire data set, not if you used the All England or the data copied from Family Search.\n\n___________________\n\nHis death index:\n\nName: Age at Death (in years):\n\nSTOPFORD, EDWARD 86\n\nGRO Reference: 1895 D Quarter in DAVENTRY Volume 03B Page 63\n\n___________________\n\nWill notes for Captain Edward Stopford RN\n\nHis probate index:\n\n1895\n\nSTOPFORD Edward of Falconer’s Hill house Daventry Northamptonshire captain royal navy died 14 October 1895 Probate London 14 December to Julia Maria Stopford widow Effects Â£5351 0s. 7d.\n\n1383\n\nAlmost certainly he will have given it all to his wife. So not ordered.\n\n__________________\n\nNotes for Edward & Julia Maria (Family)"
