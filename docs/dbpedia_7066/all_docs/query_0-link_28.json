Another name for Edward was General Edward Charles John STOPFORD.\n\nGeneral Notes: In trying to establish why Sir Edward was known as Claremont, and e-Mail from Tim Powys-Lybbe in July 2017, expanded on his History as follows:\n\nHis parentage is known only from his father's will where he was explicitly named as his son and as the principal beneficiary. This makes him a Powys descendant.\n\nHe was baptised as Edward Charles John Stopford but after the Act of Parliament to naturalise him, he was known as Edward Stopford Claremont.\n\nHis marriage was in Doncaster; the certificate has been ordered to see what additional information it provides.\n\nJune, 2009, TFPL [Timothy Francis Powys-Lybbe]: the marriage certificate tells very little. His father was entered as \"Edward Claremont, General in the Army\" with no mention that he was deceased, let alone that this was not his surname. He was a bachelor and a Lieutenant in the Royal Regt of Foot (I had the impression that officers had to be Captains to be allowed to be married in those days...) The witnesses were a load of Wetheralls plus one or two others whose names I am not sure of.\n\nHe had a distinguished military career and was Military Attache in Paris for 13 years, being a favourite of the Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nTNA has some information about an act to Naturalise him in 1836, when he was 17 or so:\n\nPrivate Act (Not Printed), 6 & 7 William IV, c. 47 HL/PO/PB/1/1836/6&7W4n103 1836\n\nThese documents are held at Parliamentary Archives\n\nContents:\n\nAn Act for naturalizing Edward Stopford Claremont.\n\nI wonder if he and his wife separated? The evidence is (a) his death in Paris and (b) the complete absence of him on all English censuses.\n\nHarts Army list of 1888 shows him as full general in Beds Regt and a Companion of the Bath. The same Harts also showed him as Colonel of the Beds regt, giving his military career:\n\nEnsign: 9 Feb 1838,\n\nLieut: 16 July 1841, (In Times of 17 Jul 1841, quoting London Gazette of 16 Jul 1841)\n\nCapt: 14 Nov 1845,\n\nMajor: 12 Dec 1854, (In London Gazette and The Times of that date) Lt Col: 14 Sep 1855,\n\nCol: 14 Sep 1858\n\nMaj-Gen: 6 Mar 1868,\n\nLt-Gen: 1 Oct 1877 (In London Gazette on 2 Oct 1877 and in The Times on 3 Oct 1877)\n\nGeneral: 1 Jul 1881.\n\nThe Times reported his appointment as Colonel of the Beds regt on 14 Mar 1883.\n\nIn the Army List of 1878 he was classified as a Lt General with a pay of £1-5s-0d a day, £456 per annum (not much).\n\nIn the 1840 Harts Army List he was an ensign in the 1st (or Royal) Regiment of Foot, with three years service at full pay and appointed on 9 Feb 1938 (agrees with above).\n\nIn the Times of 10 Nov 1869, it was announced that the Queen had given her permission for him to wear the Insignia of the French Legion of Honour, third class (whatever that may be), as awarded him by the Emperor.\n\nIn the Times of 27 Jul 1881, quoting the London Gazette of 26 July, there was this notice:\n\n\"The undermentioned General officers are placed upon the Retired List from 1st July 1881, with a step of honorary rank, under the provision so Articles 106, 107, and 124 of the Royal Warrant of 25th June 1881:\n\n\"Lieutenant-Generals:- ... Edward Stopford Claremont, C.B. ...\"\n\nThe Times had this obituary notice on 17 Jul 1890:\n\nOur Paris Correspondent telegraphed last night: \"General Edward Stopford Claremont, C.B., who was for 25 years military attaché to the British Embassy here, died this afternoon. His death will be regretted by many friends in England and on the Continent. General Claremont was with General Pelissier in the Crimea, and he witnessed the Italian campaign of 1859, as also the Franco-German war of 1870. He was one of the grooms of the Privy Chamber to the Queen, and was the first military attaché appointed to any embassy.\"\n\nWikipedia states:\n\nStopford Claremont was born in Paris with the name Edward Charles John Stopford, the illegitimate son of Lieutenant General Hon. Sir Edward Stopford and Anaïs Pauline Nathalie Aubert, known as Mademoiselle Anaïs, an actress in the Comédie-Française. His paternal grandfather was James Stopford, 2nd Earl of Courtown. James Stopford, 3rd Earl of Courtown refused to allow him to use the sole name of Stopford because of his illegitimate status and so he was naturalised in Britain by private act of Parliament in 1836 with the name of Edward Stopford Claremont.\n\nWikipedia also states:\n\nIn 1843 Edward Stopford Claremont married Frances Charlotte, daughter of General Sir George Wetherall. They had six children. He seems at some point to have had a liaison with a wealthy widow, Yolande Lyne-Stephens; his third son Henry changed his surname from Stopford Claremont to Lyne Stephens.\n\nFurther Information from Wikipedia can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Stopford_Claremont\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n Military Award: Legion of Honour, 3rd Class [France].\n\n Appointment: Groom of the Privy Chamber to Queen Victoria.\n\nEdward married Frances Charlotte WETHERALL [110611], daughter of Sir George Augustus WETHERALL KCB [110612] and Frances Diana DENTON [110613], on 14 Oct 1843 in St George's Doncaster Yorkshire England.
