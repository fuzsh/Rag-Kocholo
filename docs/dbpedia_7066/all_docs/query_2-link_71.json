        "text": "Earl of Courtown, in the County of Wexford, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1762 for James Stopford, 1st Baron Courtown. He had previously represented County Wexford and Fethard in the Irish House of Commons. Stopford had already been created Baron Courtown, of Courtown in the County of Wexford, in 1758, and was made Viscount Stopford at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a Tory politician and served under William Pitt the Younger as Treasurer of the Household from 1784 to 1793. In 1796 he was created Baron Saltersford, of Saltersford in the County of Chester, in the Peerage of Great Britain. This title gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords.\n\nHis eldest son, the third Earl, was also a Tory politician. He succeeded his father as Treasurer of the Household and was also Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners for many years. He was succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son, the fourth Earl. He represented County Wexford in the House of Commons as a Tory. His only son from his first marriage, the fifth Earl, served as a Deputy Lieutenant of County Wexford. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of County Wexford. His eldest son, the seventh Earl, was a Major-General in the Army and served as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General at the War Office from 1941 to 1947. As of 2007 the titles are held by the latter's grandson, the ninth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1975. Lord Courtown is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a Conservative.\n\nSeveral other members of the Stopford family have also gained distinction, especially in the Army and Royal Navy.

Reverend the Hon. Richard Bruce Stopford (1774-1844), fourth son of the second Earl, was Canon of Windsor and Chaplain to Her Majesty Queen Victoria.\n\nThe Hon. Sir Montagu Stopford (1798-1864), fifth son of the third Earl, was a Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy. His youngest son Sir Lionel Arthur Montagu Stopford (1860-1942) was a Colonel and Honorary Major-General in the Derby Regiment and Irish Guards. His eldest son Sir Montagu George North Stopford was a General in the Rifle Brigade. The Hon.
