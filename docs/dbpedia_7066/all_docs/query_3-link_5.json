        "text": "Stopford History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe name Stopford was brought to England by the Normans when they conquered the country in 1066. The ancestors of the Stopford family lived in Cheshire, at Stockport.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Stopford family\n\nThe surname Stopford was first found in Cheshire where Sir Robert of Stockport was a Norman noble, son of Robert Fitz-Waltheof, Lord of Etchells, who was a tenant of the Baron of Dunham Massey. \"The manor [at Etchells] was anciently in the Stockports, from whom it passed by female heirs to the Aldernes and Stanleys.\" 1\n\nOver in Bootle, Lancashire the Stockport family one half of the manor with the Beetham family. \"The Stockport family held the other half, and appear to have secured a share of the plough-lands. In 1275 Ellen, widow of Robert de Stockport, claimed against Roger de Stockport dower in a messuage, six oxgangs of land, 60 acres of meadow, in Bootle. However, this holding was short lived as The Stockport share was transferred before 1292 to Robert de Byron.\" 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Stopford family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Stopford research. Another 83 words (6 lines of text) covering the years 1238, 1636, 1654, 1675, 1700, 1770 and 1954 are included under the topic Early Stopford History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nStopford Spelling Variations\n\nThe English language only became standardized in the last few centuries. For that reason, spelling variations are common among many Anglo-Norman names. The shape of the English language was frequently changed with the introduction of elements of Norman French, Latin, and other European languages; even the spelling of literate people's names were subsequently modified. Stopford has been recorded under many different variations, including Stockport, Stopfort, Stopford and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Stopford family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nJoshua Stopford (1636-1675), an English divine, born in Lancashire and entered Brasenose College, Oxford in 16543...\n\nMigration of the Stopford family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Stopford family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 60 words (4 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nStopford migration to the United States +\n\nTo escape the uncertainty of the political and religious uncertainty found in England, many English families boarded ships at great expense to sail for the colonies held by Britain. The passages were expensive, though, and the boats were unsafe, overcrowded, and ridden with disease. Those who were hardy and lucky enough to make the passage intact were rewarded with land, opportunity, and social environment less prone to religious and political persecution. Many of these families went on to be important contributors to the young nations of Canada and the United States where they settled. Stopfords were some of the first of the immigrants to arrive in North America:\n\nStopford Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nEdward Stopford, who settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1852\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Stopford (post 1700) +\n\nJames Stopford (d. 1759), English prelate, Bishop of Cloyne, born in London, the son of Joseph Stopford, a captain in the English army\n\nSir Robert Wright Stopford KCVO, CBE (1901-1976), former Bishop of London\n\nSir Montagu Stopford (1798-1864), British officer in the Royal Navy, youngest son of James Stopford, 3rd Earl of Courtown, Admiral Superintendent, Malta Dockyard 1855â€“1858\n\nSir Robert Stopford (1768-1847), British admiral, third son of James Stopford, second earl of Courtown\n\nSir Edward Stopford GCB (1766-1837), Anglo-Irish soldier and politician\n\nGeneral Sir Montagu George North Stopford GCB, KBE, DSO, MC (1892-1971), British Lieutenant General during the Second World War and Commander-in-Chief of the South East Asia Command from 1946 to 1947\n\nRear Admiral Frederick Victor Stopford, Commander of the Order of Orange, Nassau\n\nEdward Kennedy Stopford, Assistant Under Secretary, Ministry of Defence\n\nWilliam Stopford Kenny (1788-1867), English compiler of educational works from Fitzroy Square, London\n\nStopford Augustus Brooke (1832-1916), Irish clergyman and author\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nThe Stopford Motto +\n\nThe motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Patriae infelici fidelis\n\nMotto Translation: Faithful to an unhappy country.\n\nCitations +\n\nLewis, Samuel, A Topographical Dictionary of England.
