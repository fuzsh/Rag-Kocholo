        "text": "Heraldry:\n\nThe Arms of Ludlow\n\nArms: Argent a chevron between three martin’s heads erased sable (differenced with a crescent)\n\nCrest: A lion rampant sable bezanty\n\nGiven the date of hallmarking of this pair of tazzas and with the evidence of the cadency mark of a crescent that indicates that they were in the possession of a second son of this family, a leading candidate would be William Ludlow who was living at this time. He was the second son of Stephen Ludlow (died 24th February 1721), one of the Clerks in the High Court of Chancery in Ireland and his wife, Alice Lochard. In printed sources William is described as a ‘councillor in law’ which probably means that he was called to the Bar either in England or Ireland therefore he followed his father in the profession of the law. It is known that Stephen married Catharine Stopford, the youngest daughter of James Stopford, the sometime Member ofParliament for the Borough of Wexford in the Irish House of Commons and his wife, Frances Jones. Catharine’s brother, James Stopford was created as Baron Courtown, of Courtown in the County of Wexford on the 19 September 1758 and later advanced as the Earl of Courtown and Viscount Stopford on the 12th April 1762 all within the Peerage of Ireland. The family of Ludlow took their name from Ludlow in the County of Shropshire, They later settled around the middle of the 14th Century at Hill Deverell in the County of Wiltshire."
