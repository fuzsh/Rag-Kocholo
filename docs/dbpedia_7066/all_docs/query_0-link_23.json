        "text": "As Colonel James Stopford had done much in support of the Parliamentarians, perhaps he considered it wiser to remain in Ireland after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. He must have felt that given time the prejudices of the Civil War years would hopefully fade away.\n\nThe family certainly worked hard to achieve this and gain favour once more with the Establishment.\n\nNamed after his grandfather, it was the grandson of Colonel James who purchased the Courtown estate in 1711. At that time the family home was Tara Hall and the New Hall estate, County Meath, Meath, through which the River Boyne flows, lies mostly to the north west of Dublin but narrows to reach the coast just north of the city. It is a very fertile county, and for centuries had provided flax and wool to local industries.\n\nThe Hill of Tara, cone-shaped and 507ft in height, was legendary. There the High Kings of the Celtic island were said to have resided, and St Patrick to have met and won a great argument with the Druids.\n\nThe Courtown purchase was in County Wexford, a coastal county to the south, separated from Dublin by County Wicklow. It was there that James's son, yet another James, was created Baron Courtown in 1758, then Viscount Stopford and 1st Earl of Courtown in the Irish peerages of 1762.\n\nHis sister married a cousin James, son of Joseph Stopford, a captain in the English army. Her husband had been born in London, but he later became Bishop of Cloyne in Ireland and was a very close friend of the famous Irish satirist Jonathan Swift (1667-1745). Swift had accepted the position of Dean of St Patrick's in Dublin during 1713.\n\nBishop James was appointed an executor of Swift's will, and was left a portrait of Charles I by Van Dyke, which he had originally given to Swift.\n\nOn the death of this 1st Earl, his son James became the 2nd Earl of Courtown and continued his father's work. He was a founder member of the Knights of St Patrick.\n\nThe Order was created by George III in 1783; the last knight was created in 1922 when most of Ireland gained independence. Technically it still exists, with the Queen remaining sovereign of the Order with just one officer. The Irish Government has from time to time considered reviving it.\n\nMembership was only permitted to knights and gentlemen, but the latter had to prove that their mother's and father's families had both been entitled to a coat of arms for three generations. In fact only Irish Peers were ever appointed.\n\nIn 1907 it received headline news when its insignia, which had become known as the Irish Crown jewels, mysteriously disappeared from Dublin Castle, shortly before a visit by Edward VII.\n\nIt had been presented to the Grand Master of the Order by Queen Victoria's uncle, William IV, comprising a star and badge of rubies, emeralds and Brazilian diamonds. On special occasions the knights wore collars made of gold depicting harps and Tudor roses, with a crown over the centre harp. The enamelling was white and red, and five of these collars were stolen with the insignia. None has ever been recovered.\n\nNormally the knights wore a broad blue sash with a gold badge sporting a shamrock above a cross of St Patrick.\n\nHaving found himself firmly placed in Irish society, James, 2nd Earl of Courtown, achieved the ultimate family ambition. He was created Baron Salterford in the Peerage of Great Britain 1794.\n\nOnce more the link with Macclesfield was set on record, and the Establishment had forgiven.\n\n(To be continued)"
