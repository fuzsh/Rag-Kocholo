        "text": "The publication in 1908 of 'The making of Ireland and its undoing 1200-1600' by the London-based Irish historian, Alice Stopford Green, provoked a controversy that reveals much about the deepening political tensions at the heart of historical practice in the decade before 1916. Stopford Green took a deliberately controversial approach to the rewriting of medieval Ireland that triggered a bombardment of both positive and negative reactions. Supporters of Irish home rule applauded the work for its innovative analysis and contemporary relevance. But the book elicited a surge of anguish from a united front of 'history men', who dismissed Mrs Green and her work as 'political' and largely fictitious. Anticipating the reaction from a profession that was predominantly sympathetic to a unionist interpretation, Stopford Green had a well-prepared plan that harnessed both her gender and her transnational networks of influence to maximise the dissemination of her radical re-imagining of the Gaelic world. By understanding these deeper strategies of defiance, Alice Stopford Green's history might be reclaimed as a key intervention in the structuring of both Ireland's national tradition and collective consciousness in preparation for independence. doi:10.1017/ihs.2020.40\n\nThe gender biased history of Ireland is gradually being redressed but so much work remains to be done in this area. The lack of female representation in Irish history has often been blamed on a lack of primary source material. It has been argued that there are not enough records of women available for researchers, or that relevant records are difficult to source. In order to redress this situation a research guide to “Women in Irish History” was compiled in the National Library of Ireland. The guide outlines procedures for locating manuscripts relating to women held in the NLI and provides a brief description and contextual background of relevant collections. This article examines the manuscripts of Meath women held in the National Library of Ireland. Providing a brief account of the lives of women who were born or lived in that county and the activities of women’s groups active in the area.\n\nThis article relates to a talk given to the Kilmacanogue History Society in the Glenview Hotel, Co Wicklow, on 6 November 2018. The subject is the closely intertwined Wicklow families of Barton and Childers. In particular the article deals with the careers of Robert Barton (1881-1975) and Erskine Childers (1870-1922), their contribution to the national cause and their spouses Molly Osgood and Rachel Warren of Boston."
