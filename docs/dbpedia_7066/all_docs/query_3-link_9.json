        "text": "Stopford Origin:\n\nEngland\n\nOrigins of Stopford:\n\nListed in the spellings of Stockport, which is quite limited, and the most popular dialects Stoppard, Stopforth and Stopford, this is an English surname. It is locational and starts from the town of Stockport in the division of Cheshire. The town is on the River Mersey and before the Norman Invasion of 1066 it was considered that it was known as Stocford from the Olde English pre 7th century “stoc” meaning a place and “forda,” a slight river crossing. As to why, the popular surname spelling is Stoppard, Stopford or Stopforth is unknown, but some of the earliest records are in Yorkshire in the Poll Tax rolls of 1379. It shows that the changed language through the crossing of the Pennine moorlands and slops which divide the divisions may have had something to do with it. Locational surnames may originally have applied to the local lord of the estate, as may in some examples apply here, however, in general, they are “from” names. That is to say, names were given to people after they departed from their original homes, and who moved elsewhere. Local languages being very thick and spelling unusual, soon lead to the advancement of alternative spellings. In this example, Roger de Stokeford noted in Cheshire in 1295, Thomas Stoppforth was a citizen of York in 1375 and Oliver Stokport was the administrator of Stockport in the year 1549.\n\nVariations:\n\nMore common variations are: Stoppford, Stepford, Stapford, Stipford, Stapfort, Stabfort.\n\nEngland:\n\nThe surname Stopford first appeared in Cheshire where Sir Robert of Stockport was a Norman noble, son of Robert Fitz-Waltheof, King of Etchells, who was a resident of the Baron of Dunham Massey. “The manor [at Etchells] was anciently in the Stockports, from whom it passed by a female descendant to the Aldernes and Stanleys.”\n\nIreland:\n\nMany of the people with surname Stopford had moved to Ireland during the 17th century.\n\nUnited States of America:\n\nSome of the people with the name Stopford who arrived in the United States in the 19th century included Edward Stopford settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1852.\n\nHere is the population distribution of the last name Stopford: South Africa 822; England 645; United States 139; Australia 117; Canada 52; New Zealand 43; Scotland 33; Northern Ireland 3; Ireland 2; Hong Kong 2.\n\nNotable People:\n\nAdmiral Sir Robert Stopford GCB GCMG (February 1768 – June 1847), was a prominent officer in the Royal Navy whose job crossed over 60 years, from the French Revolutionary Wars to the Syrian War.\n\nLieutenant General Sir Frederick William Stopford, KCB, KCMG, KCVO (February 1854 –May 1929) was a British Army officer, best recognized for commanding the Suvla Bay landing in August 1915 during the Gallipoli Battle.\n\nJoseph Thomas Sarsfield Stopford (1867–November 1951) was a British Bowman.
