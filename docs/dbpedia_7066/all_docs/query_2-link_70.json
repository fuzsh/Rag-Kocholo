        "text": "A sign of advancing years is when you realise that the mentors on whom you rely for knowledge are no more. Were only the architect and architectural historian Jeremy Williams still with us then I would know who had designed Aharney House. I do remember that Jeremy did tell me, but what he told me has gone!! I remember visiting the ruins with him whist they still stood – a red brick house, single story, of rubbed brick with square bay windows and a tall two storey tower at one end. The earlier house was at the rear, two storeys and of rubblestone construction.\n\nWere Harry McDowell, that most omnipotent genealogist, still with us I would not be struggling with the genealogies of the Clarkes of Aharney and the Laurensons of Capponellan.\n\nNowadays one might never penetrate the rolling countryside between the Durrow to Ballyragget road and the Durrow to Cullahill road, unless deliberately visiting the area. In prehistoric times things were different – the fulacht fiadh, ringforts and other early earthworks tell of a busy landscape. The ancient highway between Upper Ossory and Kilkenny crossed Cahir Hill to Newtown ond on to Lisdowney. The very name of Aharney means ‘Ford of the Heap’ and commemorates a cattle raiding skirmish between the men of Upper Ossory and Lower Ossory. The men of Upper Ossory retreated to the nearby stream to recover from the battle and were so exhausted and injured that they drowned and their bodies lay in a heap. There was also a tree in the field to the southeast called Sceacharawash, the Bush of the Race, where The MacGiollaPadraig threw Thomas Butler, the son of the 8th Earl of Ormond, down from his horse and most cruelly murdered him after his flight from a conference held by the Butlers and Fitzpatricks in 1532.\n\nIn the 1600s the Butlers, Viscount Mountgarret, owned most of the land . Dun Chobhthaigh Castle was at Tinnaslatty, across the road and stream from Aharney House in the field called Castlefield, that was levelled in the early 1800s. Seskin Castle, north-east of Seskin House was also taken down in the early 19th century. Near the Glanbia factory, on the banks of the Nore stood Ballycorna Castle. According to the Down Survey there was “a castle a little in repayre,” in Ballyconra, in 1655. None of these were actually lived in by the Butlers, who preferred Ballyragget Castle initially, and then Balleen, near Freshford, which was not finished when attacked by Cromwellians in 1650.\n\nTracing title is tough for a property specialist, so nearly impossible for an amateur genealogist – I cannot see how John McTeige Fitzpatrick, the younger son of the 4th Baron of Upper Ossory, came to be in possession of Aharney, but he forfeited it in 1653.\n\nThe Down Survey show Aharney, and in the survey note that there was common land there, a “Danceing (sic) Meadow” of 64 acres.\n\nOver the next 50 years new families now start to arrive\n\nA cadet branch of the Fitzgeralds of Burnchurch lived in Lisdowney, across the river in Kilkenny, In the graveyard at Barony, getting somewhat buried itself, is the tombstone of Alexius FitzGerald (1694) with beautifully incised heraldry and lettering. Alex’s father William died the following year leaving his daughter in the charge of William Clarke, an “English papist”, of Aharney, whose father John Clarke had been one of the surveyors of the barony of Glamoy for the Cromwellian Settlement of 1655.\n\nImage of Alexius FitzGerald’s monument from Paul Cockerham’s Thesis ‘My body to be buried in my owne monument’: the social and religious context of Co. Kilkenny funeral monuments, 1600–1700\n\nHe was possibly a kinsman of Hugh Clarke who was noted as an English Catholic tenant in 1641 on the estate of the Protestant planter Sir Walsingham Cooke of Tomduff, Ballygarrett, the son of the Irish Chancellor of The Exchequer in the 1590s\n\nJohn Clarke was descended from Sir Simon Woodchurch, of Kent, who married Susan, heir to Henry le Clerke around 1260 and annex’d so plentiful a revenue to this name, alter’d their paternal appellation from Woodchurch to Clerke: and so in all their deeds, subsequent to this match have written Clerke alias Woodchurch ever since. He was married to Elizabeth Crispe. also from Kent, many of whose relations were married to other people around Kilkenny – Lodge, Matthews, Bryan & Pay. The exact connection with the senior branch of the family is not clear – the Clarkes of Porthall, Lifford may be the connection – they are descended from of a younger brother of Simon Clarke, who was created a baronet by Charles II. for his services to the Royalist cause. The younger brother was a Cromwellian, and was paid with land in Lifford.\n\nJohn Clarke died in 1721, 7 years before Gabriel Clarke who is buried beside the Grace Mausoleum at Tullaroan, and was possibly his brother. (Confusingly not the same Gabriel Clarke of Cork merchant who was born in 1673 and died 9th March 1739, son of\n\nBartholomew Clarke of Grange co Antrim of the of Hardingstone, Northamptonshire and founder of the first Quaker meeting house in Youghal with William Fennell in 1719)\n\nOne of John’s children was John Clarke, S.J. (1662-1723), missionary to the Irish. Another married Elizabeth, daughter of Walter Murray of Elibank, of Rathvilly, Co. Carlow. Thomas Clarke, their grandson joined the Irish Brigade, and married Louisa Shee, from the Kilkenny family, and their son Henry James William Clarke {1765-1818), became Due de Feltre, Marshal of France, Minister of War to Napoleon the First, Governor of Berlin, &c.!\n\nStrangely back in England things, initially, had not gone quite so well for the senior branch of the family. Sir Simon Clark, the 6th Bart., was caught red-handed after a highway robbery near Winchester in 1731. Clarke pleaded economic necessity and won the sympathy of the local gentry. He removed himself to Jamaica, where his son became a slave-owner and major money-lender. When he died in 1777 he had 171 slaves and £269,591 6 shillings – about £50m in modern terms. One of the clauses of his will might well irritate modern readers – To my reputed daughter (whose name I do not at present recollect) begotten by me on the body of Miss Hannah Samuels in Great Britain £1,000 Jamaican currency at age 21 years or marriage. £50 sterling per annum to her in the meantime.\n\nJemmy, or Shaemeen Clarke of Aharney, who died about 1770, was a famous “Gentleman Hurler”.\n\nThe oldest tombstones in Aharney are erected in memory of Mary Devlin of Aharney who died in the year 1640. William Delaney of Aharney who died in the year 1721. Fr. Delaney who was parish priest of Aharney died in the year 1726. It seems probable that Michael Delaney (b 1786) of Archerstown was a descendant of William.\n\nDelaney was adopted as the anglicised form of the original Irish Ó Dubhshláine, from dubh, meaning “black” and slan, meaning “defiance”. The original territory of the Ó Dubhshlaine was at the foot of the Slieve Bloom mountains in Co. Laois. From there they spread into Kilkenny, and the surname is still strongly associated with these two counties. In this case Devlin is probably an Anglicisation of the same surname\n\nAnother ancient tomb is in Durrow Churchyard “Here Lyeth ye body of …. Burk who departed this life ye 31st July also the body of James Dun her son who died ye 4th August in the 18th year of his age 1728”. Marking the same grave is another headstone:- “God be merciful to the soul of Edwd, Dunn, of Aharney, who depd. this life 30th day of Sept 1784 aged 76 years. Also his wife, Elizabeth Dunn, alias Lawler, who depd. this life the 22nd of June. 1774. aged 64 years ; with three sons and two daughters. Also Michael Dunne, who depd. June the 1st, 1804, aged 65 years.”\n\nThree brothers who moved from Clonaslee and Rosenallis during the second half of the 17th century. Of the brothers, one settled down in Clonageera, beside Durrow, the other two in Ahamey. Their descendants include Michael Dunne, of Durrow, son of Patrick, of Durrow (1822-83), son of John, of Clonageera and Durrow (c. 1770-c. 1850); and Mr. Patrick Dunne, of Aharney, son of John, of Aharney (1794-1873), son of Michael, of Aharney (1739-1804).\n\nThe principal seat of the Dunne family, who emerged as an identifiable clan in the 11th century, was Tinnahinch Castle which was built by Tadgh U Dunne around 1475. Originally known as “Baun Riaganach”, the castle was built by Tadhg MacLaighnigh Ui Duinn in 1475 and was a mile south of Tinnahinch bridge on the Carlow side of The Barrow at Graiguenamanagh. . The name Tinnahinch originally means “house of the island”, a tributary of the Barrow surrounding the castle giving it the appearance of an island. It was destroyed by during the Cromwellians under Colonel Hewson in 1653. At the time it was strongly defended by Charles Dunne and it required a full park of artillery from the invading forces to level the castle. When the main residence in Tinnahinch was blown up in 1653, the Dunne Chief had to build anew. Castlebrack, also built by Tadgh around 1475 for the Dunne clan Tainiste, in the Northern part of the Dunne lands towards Tullamore had also been attacked. However there was a low thatched lodge located at Brittas, near the present village of Clonaslee. The Dunnes built a mansion at right angles to this, facing north-east, of which more in a later post. There were many branches of the clan around Clonaslee and it is hard to identify the Aharney Dunne progenitors.\n\nThe most interesting family arrived here around 1690. Carrigan suggests that they may have been O’Marum and come from beyond the Shannon. Others wonder, despite their religion (they were always Catholic, and produced two parish priests and a bishop) whether they may have come from the Palatines either as refugees or as Williamite soldiers. Initially they lived near Barony Church, and then moved to Galmoy, then Edmund Marum moved back , first to Seskin House around 1780, and then bought 200 acres of good land and built Aharney House in 1807.\n\nAharney before and after the addition of the new facade in the 1870s\n\nEdmund’s younger brothers included the catholic Bishop of Ossory, Kieran Marum, and the PP of Freshford, the Rev Pierce Marum as well as the less popular John Marum of Mount Stopford, near Galmoy, a former United Irishman and substantial landlord on the estate of the Earl of Courtown. He was known as a nasty bit of work, a land-jobber, taking lands over other peoples’ heads, moving opportunistically to take over leases at the expense of defaulting tenants, and then evicting the tenants. In this particular case a middleman had been evicted and the the tenants had hoped to be get leases direct from the landlord. Instead of which Marum acquired the Mmiddleman’s lease and set about preparing to evict the tenants. At 6 o’clock on the evening of Tuesday 16th March 1824 John Marum was shot dead in an ambush by a group of men near his home. At the inquest no one admitted knowledge of the perpetrators and the verdict was “wilful murder by persons unknown”. However, with clever police work and the use of informers, arrests of 6 men were made and 10 prosecution witnesses gave evidence at the trial in Grace’s Old Castle, Kilkenny, before Chief Justice Charles Kendal Bushe from Kilmurray in Thomastown, a former MP in the Irish Parliament, who had resigned his seat rather than accept bribery to support the Union. The jury, mostly of propertied men, found all 6 guilty and they were sentenced to death by hanging at the location of the committal of the crime. A large crowd attended the execution, including MPs and many prominent land-owners, and approx. 500 police and military. The bodies were given to the Surgeon of the County Infirmary for dissection.\n\nEdmund’s daughter married a local farmer, Edward Staunton, and his son Richard married Elizabeth Mulhallen, but predeceased his father leaving three daughters and a son, Edward Purcell Mulhallen Marum, who studied at Carlow College and then did a BA and an LLB in London and was called to The Kings Inns in 1848.\n\nEdward married Maryanne Brennan, daughter of John Brennan of Castlecomer, chief of that name, in 1861. He divided his time between Aharney and Ashfield House in Kilkenny, on the Bennettsbridge road, next to Danville, and seems to have been based there from 1870 to 1880, whilst the new front of Aharney was being built . There were problems. Contract for repairs and additions between Mulhallen Marum, JP,and – Callan, builder, of Dublin, 1868. Latter sues Marum for money alleged to be due to him, 1870. ‘The defendant’s case was substantially that in the winter of ’68 a considerable portion of the work up to that time executed fell down owing to the infirmity of construction, and he contended that the position of the works at present is such that it will cost a considerable amount of money to have the house put into a proper state of repair.’\n\nIt would be interesting to know where the bricks came from, as this predates the establishment of the Durrow Brick Works. They probably came from the brickworks at Graigue at Carlow, or Athy Bricks, from which much of South Dublin was constructed;\n\nThere were brickfields at Clonageera and Archerstown which supplied the brick for Heywood’s garden wall and the cottages at Chapel Street in Ballinakill, both in the early 20th Century. Maybe they were also the source of Marum’s brick?\n\nHe was the honorary correspondent of The Kilkenny Hunt to Bell’s Life, a weekly sporting paper published as a pink broadsheet between 1822 and 1886, probably the origin of the 19th century “pink’un” fashion for sporting news. In 1869 he and W. H. Meredyth, the then Master of the Kilkenny Hunt, had a blazing row initially in the correspondence columns of the Kilkenny Moderator, but which spilt into the committee rooms of the hunt and even the covers drawn . George Bryan of Jenkinstown was his great friend and supporter – indeed for some reason Bryan’s stallion was kept at Aharney :-\n\nHe stood unsuccessfully as a Home Rule candidate for at a by-election in Kilkenny city in 1875. He was subsequently elected as Member of Parliament for County Kilkenny as a Parnellite Home Ruler in 1880, topping the poll, and held the seat until the constituency was divided for the 1885 general election. He was then elected for the new North Kilkenny constituency, and held that seat until his death in 1891. A very colourful figure, in one of his more famous escapades he rode a hunter up and down the marble steps of St. Canice’s Cathedral in Kilkenny.\n\nConscious of his lack of oratory Horace Plunkett hired the services of this silver-tongued orator to thunder out the co-operative gospel at crossroads and church gates, but died of heart disease before he had been able to attend more than three or four.\n\nGetty Images have an interesting picture of Aharney Camp August 1899: The East Yorkshire Regiment’s military encampment during Irish manoeuvres, which I would have shared on this site but didn’t feel like paying the €70 that a licence would cost! The regiment were then based in Birr, and 5 months later embarked for South Africa and the Boer War.\n\nIn March 1900 two of Edwards’s children, the 27 year old Austin Marum, and 30 year old Elizabeth Marum died of diphtheria at Aharney. In January 1907 his last remaining son, the 40 year old William, married Brigid Stapleton, the live in maid. There was some talk about it, and the marriage took place in Dublin. He is said to have been disowned by his family for marrying beneath him. Six months later he died at Aharney, of peritonitis. In his obituary Ballyragget Cricket Club, he is described as being of a retiring nature, but a leading light of the. The informant on the death certificate, Thomas Dowling, married Brigid 9 years later, and they had 4 children.\n\nOn October 27th 1908, the year following William’s death, his mother sold “The Entire of| her Superior Antique Furniture, Cattle, Cob, Carriages, etc.” and retired to 86 Lower Baggot Street.\n\nThe estate was bought by the Stauntons, cousins of the Marums, but sadly in the 1970s that most destructive bunch of ignorant bigots, the Irish Land Commission, got their hands on it and by 1980 the house was derelict."
