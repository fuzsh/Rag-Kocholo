        "text": "If the Roman Church in Scotland had been too lax in its discipline and practice, the same fault could not be found with the Presbyterian; [A curious letter exists (1560), signed by Argyll, James Stewart (Regent), and Ruthven, ordering the altars and figures of saints to be turned out of the “Kyrk of Dunkeld,” and broken up.] and in Dumfries the Kirk Courts ruled with a severity and interference in domestic affairs during the 17th and 18th centuries which was hardly exceeded by the Inquisition in Italy and Spain. In 1659 nine old women were burned together for witchcraft, and even so late as 1709 a woman was consigned to the flames for the same alleged crime. Slander, Sabbath-breaking, swearing, drinking, and tale-bearing were punished by fines, whipping, the pillory, and sometimes very eccentric penances. A Roman priest, in 1626, was recognised crossing the bridge at Dumfries. He was stopped, but favoured by sympathisers in the crowd contrived to make his escape, while the vestments, altar books, and sacred vessels which he had with him in a bag were seized and burned at the Market Cross. The same was done with the property of another priest in 1658. It was forbidden to send a boy out of the country to be educated in a foreign school; and in 1631 the Privy Council even ordered the son of Lord Nithsdale to be taken from him and educated as a Protestant. In 1628 Herbert Maxwell of Kirkconnel; Gilbert Brown, formerly Abbot of Sweet Heart or Newabbey; his brother Charles; John Williamson in Lochmaben, and other influential people were ordered to be tried for “Papistry.” Sir William Grierson of Lag and Sir John Charteris of Amisfield succeeded in arresting the ex-Abbot and his brother, whereupon their adherents subjected the Protestant minister of Newabbey and his family to ill-usage. In 1647 Lord Herries outwardly conformed to Presbyterianism.\n\nThe Scottish Lyon Office, with its contents, having been burned in the last century, and the law being strict in prohibiting the use of armorial bearings unless properly registered, most of the Scottish families matriculated their arms again. The Johnstones of Galabank registered theirs in 1772, and were recorded as belonging to “the family of Newby, an ancient cadet of the Johnstones of Johnstone.” Although the tombs of their family of the date of 1649, 1692, and 1726 bore the arms of Johnstone of that Ilk without a difference, the arms of Johnstone of Galabank were registered with a wavy saltire as a mark of cadency, the last Marquis of Annandale being still living; but the late Mr Edward Johnstone, wishing to restore them to the style borne by his direct ancestors, re-matriculated in 1870. The last Marquis died in 1792, when his estates passed to his niece, married to Sir William Hope, who took the name of Johnstone, and their descendant, Mr Hope-Johnstone (born 1842), now owns the ancient barony of Annandale. His brother, Percy Alexander, late Captain 60th Rifles, born 1845, is his heir. He married his cousin, Evelyn Anne, and has issue.\n\nIn Sir William Pulteney, the Westerhall family produced one of the most eminent lawyers of the last century, and a distinguished member of the House of Commons. He married the heiress of William Pulteney, Earl of Bath, and took her name. As he left only a daughter, Henrietta Laura, created Countess of Bath in 1792, his baronetcy of Westerhall devolved in 1803 on his nephew, Sir John Lowther Johnstone, the grandfather of the present baronet. The heir to Sir Frederick John William Johnstone is his twin brother, Colonel George Keppel Johnstone, born in 1841. He married Agnes, daughter of Mr Thomas Chamberlayne, and has issue.\n\nThere was no minister at Annan or Graitney till about 1612, when Mr Symon Johnstone was appointed to Annan, and remained there many years. Charles I. made enemies of the Scottish landowners in Dumfriesshire as in other parts of Scotland by depriving them of a portion of their tithes, which they exacted from their tenants with far greater severity than had been exercised by the old abbots, to whom their lands had in many instances belonged; and although, when they received these lands, it had been with the stipulation that they should maintain the Parish Kirks this was often done very inadequately. The Johnstones and the Irvings of Bonshaw and Robgill supported Charles, while those noblemen whom his predecessors had enriched with church lands generally supported the Covenanters, particularly the Earl of Buccleuch; for Charles had reversed the attainder of Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, which compelled Buccleuch to restore some of the forfeited lands he had received from James I. The barbarity of the Covenanters in killing the wounded and executing their prisoners is a matter of history, and their subsequent triumph ensured the predominance of Presbyterianism.\n\nIn 1706 the representative of the Douglases, the Duke of Queensberry, was the largest proprietor in Dumfriesshire. His title and estates have now passed into a female branch represented by the Duke of Buccleuch, but his nearest male collaterals, the Douglases of Kelhead, succeeded to the titles of Marquis of Queensberry and Viscount Torthorell. The present owner of them has lately sold all his estates in Annandale.\n\nMEMBERS FOR DUMFRIESSHIRE\n\nAND THE\n\nBURGHS OF DUMFRIES, LOCHMABEN, ANNAN, AND SANQUHAR.\n\nAn Act of 1427 ordained that “the small barons and free tenants need not come to Parliament nor general counsels, so that of each sheriffdom there be two or three wise men chosen at the head court of the sheriffdom, according to its size.” In 1537 another Act ordered the barons to choose one or two of the wisest and most qualified to be Commissioners for the whole shire. In 1587 representation was limited to those who held “a forty shilling land in free tenantry of the King.” The Parliaments sat at Scone, Perth, Stirling, or Edinburgh, and the Members voted as one Chamber, there being no division into an Upper and Lower House.\n\nThos.

Doubtful.\n\nJohn Corsane—1622.\n\nSir Roger Kirkpatrick—1623.\n\nJohn Corrie—1639.\n\nJohn Corsane—1642.\n\nRobert Grahame—1643.\n\nJohn Maxwell—1645.\n\nThomas Macburnie—1649 to 1654.\n\nJohn Irving—1660 to 1665.\n\nThomas Irving—1665 to 1668.\n\nJohn Irving—1668 to 1674.\n\nLord Drumlanrig—1683 to 1686.\n\nJohn Maxwell—1687 to 1688.\n\nThomas Rome—1691.\n\nRobert Johnstone and John Irving, alternately, till 1700.\n\nIn 1517 the Bailies of Dumfries were:—John Welsh, Andro Airying, John Ranyng, Adam Edzair, Edward of Johnstone, David Wilson, Thomas Macnaughton, George Curror, Herbert Gladstanes, Adam Wallace, James Kirkpatrick, David Cunningham.\n\nIn 1543—Edward Johnstone, John Crosbie, George Maxwell, Thomas Maxwell, Herbert Gladstanes, Herbert Parsons, Herbert Maxwell, Gilbert Macbyrnie, Andro Airying, William Paterson, Homer Maxwell, Anthony Houston, Robert Crawfurd, Thomas Ranyng.\n\nIn 1575—Herbert Baillie, William Gladstanes, Thomas Johnstone, Thos. Baty, William Paterson, Andro Moresone, Herbert Maxwell, Peter Davidson, James Wallace, Michael Newall, John Hereis, Andro Edzar, Herbert Ranyng, David Rae, John Roule.\n\nOn the accession of George I., and far into the reign of George III., this oath was required from the Provosts and Bailies, or any holding public office, in Dumfriesshire:—\n\n“I, the underscribed, do truly and sincerely acknowledge, and declare in my conscience before God and the World, that my Sovereign, King George, is lawful and rightful King of Great Britain, and all other his Majesty’s dominions thereunto belonging, and I do solemnly and sincerely declare that I do believe in my conscience that the person pretended to be Prince of Wales during the life of the late King James, and since his decease pretending to be or taking upon himself the style and title of King of England by the name of James III., or of Scotland by the name of James VIII., or the style and title of King of Great Britain, had not any right or title whatsoever to the Crown of this realm, or any other dominion thereunto belonging. . . . and I will do my utmost to disclose and make known to his Majesty and his successors all treason and traitorous attempts which I shall know to be against him,” &c. “So help me God.”\n\nIn 1714, Abraham Crichton was Provost of Sanquhar, and John Crichton (two), Robert Fisher, William Macwath, James Stewart, &c., Bailies. At Sanquhar the Crichton family had almost the monopoly of the Provostship.\n\nStewards Depute of Annandale—1609, John Johnstone in Mylnfield; 1610, John Carruthers of Holmains; 1611, Master John Johnstone; 1613, John Carruthers.\n\nThe register of births, deaths, and marriages in Dumfries is not older than 1620, and is very much broken till the end of that century. Some of the entries are curious. Boys are registered as man bairns, and girls as maid bairns; and there is often a description of the person whose death is recorded, such as “a poor old woman,” “a lame begging man,” &c.; and in one instance the incumbent details the ancestry and virtues of his mother-in-law. The records of the burgh are preserved with intervals from 1479. The register of Dumfriesshire sasines, which begins in 1618, are lost during the years of Civil War, as is also the Register of Wills, and almost every other record relating to Dumfriesshire at that period.\n\nANCIENT PROVOSTS OF ANNAN"
