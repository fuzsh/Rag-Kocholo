There is also an Elizabeth who appears in the 1881 census in Rickmansworth, born in Shropshire.\n\nOn 10 November 1844, again in Clun Shropshire, a Mary Powys was born to John Powys and Jane. I think these three births must be relations, somehow.\n\n__________________\n\nOswald Barron, in his VCH genealogy volume for Northants, calls here Helena.
