In 2020, there was about $25M in funding for Guardians ‚û°Ô∏è Now, there is over $100M going directly to First Nations Guardians programs across the country.

Check out our latest to read more about how the movement supporting Guardians has grown exponentially in the last 4 years, and how it‚Äôs easy to see why. https://bit.ly/3HOiY89\n\nChildren in care should never be the means by which people make profit. @GeorgeMonbiot comments in the @guardian \"Private agencies now own 36% of the fostering sector in England, while profit-making corporations own 83% of children‚Äôs residential care. ‚ÄúBlocks of provision‚Äù ‚Äì which means numbers of children ‚Äì are traded from one company to another. How much is a human being worth? The value of a child on the books, as the dedicated journalist @MartinBarrow documents, is ¬£100,000.\" There are plenty of other options to private fostering and residential care but we have lacked political ambition to actually change the systems. As a result children are being failed while private equity funds make extraordinary amounts of money.\n\nPeople over Profits My heart is broken reading this statistic. It‚Äôs devastating to see the impact on young people being moved from one company to another like commodities. Why are big organisations stepping in and taking over the fostering and residential care sector? The commodification of children, with each valued at ¬£100,000, is shocking. Working with charities that support young people, I see firsthand how passionate and dedicated these organisations are. They truly care about the well-being and future of these children. However, their efforts are constantly hampered by a lack of funding, relying heavily on government support that is often insufficient. Meanwhile, private companies, driven by profit, are buying into these projects, prioritising financial gain over the needs of vulnerable children. Our children are coming out broken, as they go through a broken system. Something needs to change. We must prioritise people over profits and ensure that every child receives the care and support they deserve. We need to provide our nonprofits with the resources and platforms they need to reach a wider audience can make a significant impact. Let‚Äôs invest in and support the charities that are dedicated to making a real difference in these children's lives. Together, we can challenge the status quo, amplify the voices of those who genuinely care, and work towards a system that values the well-being of every child over profit.\n\n\"As we head towards a general election, we need all political parties to recognise that the current situation for the UK‚Äôs children is unacceptable and address it. We need a commitment that more will be spent on improving the lives of babies, children and young people coupled with a pledge to transform the policy and decision-making process that impacts them.\" As part of the Children's Society Coalition, our CEO Anna Feuchtwang and Action for Children Barnardo's NSPCC The Children's Society explain why all political parties must commit to do more for babies, children and young people: https://lnkd.in/dmauBcY6\n\nPutting Children First ‚ÄòGetting it right‚Äô for children and young people means getting it right for our wider society. That‚Äôs why we're campaigning for children and young people to be at the heart of policy making; whether that‚Äôs at Westminster or in the communities where we all live, work and bring up our families. For too long, children and young people have been an ‚Äòadd on‚Äô or afterthought when decisions are made. It‚Äôs now time to reverse the balance and ensure that those who will build our future society take centre stage. So what do we need to make this happen? A new Government Department for Children, Young People and the Family headed by a Secretary of State is our top priority. For too long, ‚Äòfamily policy‚Äô has been left to local commissioning. We want the balance to be reversed so local authorities are carrying out policies which are backed by legislation ‚Äì not ‚Äòpilot schemes‚Äô or ‚Äòpartial roll out‚Äô that can be changed at any time.

Note to folks who read this post (who might not know): When you see something that says \"Notice of Proposed Rule Making\" it means that you, the public, you, the average citizen, or you, the agency, can submit comments in whatever form you like to Regulations.gov. Here is the link. https://lnkd.in/eAinzNfS The deadline is December 1. If you are unable to read the document or respond, you can reach out to The Office of Family Assistance, ACF, at TANFquestions@acf.hhs.gov or 202‚Äì401‚Äì9275. and they will take your comments verbally. Also, \"Deaf and hard of hearing individuals may call 202‚Äì401‚Äì9275 through their chosen relay service or 711 between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. Eastern Time.\" Remember - your comments do not have to be academic or fancy. The most useful comments by far on notices such as these are from folks who have suffered through the bureaucratic or nonsensical rules. Just a few sentences will do about your experience. Finally, you can read every comment submitted if you visit the link above.\n\nActually Justin, the problem with our country is you. It is because of you and your inept policies that everything is so expensive. It is because of you and your taxes that businesses cannot afford to operate. It is because of you and the amount of taxes you take from a paycheque that many people simply don‚Äôt work. Your day care plan will be rot with corruption and incompetence. Everything you touch is rot with corruption and incompetence. Here we are with another billion of taxpayer dollars that will disappear. How about giving a parent an option via a decent salary to actually raise their own child into a hard working ethical Canadian citizen! Good parenting needs to be funded whereas bad parenting needs to be defunded. Nothing is more important then raising a honest citizen. That is how you will lower crime, addiction and so forth. https://lnkd.in/e2S2b2XM"
