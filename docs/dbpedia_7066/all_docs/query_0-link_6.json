Harriet Katherine Townshend and Charles William Henry Montagu-Scott, 4th Duke of Buccleuch, they were married on the 4th of July 1822 at St. Margaret's Church, Westminster, London, England.[3][4] He married, secondly, Dora Pennefather, daughter of Susannah Darby and the Rt. Hon. Edward Pennefather, on the 29th of October 1850 at St. Peter's Church, Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland.[3][5]\n\nEarl of Courtown property\n\nCoonogue 931 acres Giffiths valuation [6]\n\nEvictions Aug 1839\n\nBorris, August 12th, 1839. A most distressing scene took place in this neighbourhood on Wednesday last. No less than forty families were ejected on that day, out of their houses and lands in Coonogue, by their landlord, Lord Courtown.\n\nI cannot account for this wholesale ejectment of tenantry, for they were most industrious people; they and their forefathers cultivated these lands these hundred years, and have, by their labour and industry, improved the land so much, that the rent will now be twice the amount it would be if left in the unreclaimed state it was in forty years ago. Their rents have been paid up to last November, and the half-years rent which became due last May they offered to Captain Owen, Lord Courtown’s agent, but he refused taking it, saving he would leave them no longer on the land.\n\nThey offered to pay any rent, and pay a year's rent in advance; but nothing would satisfy the landlord but his land. There was only one freeholder on the townland; he holds twenty acres of land, and is left in possession, I suppose because he voted for the Tories. There is another man holding nine acres, left in possession also, but all the other tenants, forty in number, were turned to the road with their families. Some of them slept out in the fields that night, and others of them went into the out-offices for the night, as the dwelling-houses were all thrown down as they got possession of them, but they are threatened to be punished as severely as the law will allow, if found on the land.\n\nLord Courtown’s drivers went through the tenants of the neighbouring townlands of Ballybrack and Knockmore, belonging to Lord Courtown, commanding them to attend in Coonogue to throw down the houses: these people are circumstanced just as the people of Coonogue were twelve months ago; they hold their lands from a middle-man, whose lease will expire on the death of a very old man, arid on account of the precarious tenure they have of their lands, they were afraid to disobey this unnatural command. They accordingly pulled down their neighbours’ houses. There are three hundred and eighty acres in the town land which was let in small farms of from thirty-two acres the largest, to one acre, with a right of commonage, on the Blackstairs mountain. Having but small farms, they improved them so much that less than thirty pounds per acre did not cover their expenses; and now when it is in such a state of improvement, and fit to be let in larger farms, they are to be turned to the road as the reward of their industry.\n\nThere was a great display of military and police force that day; I suppose in all about one thousand men. No people could conduct themselves better than those who were ejected; there was no breach of the peace whatever. They are about getting up a memorial to the House of Commons, praying for an investigation into the cause of the persecution exercised against them, and for relief until such time as they can get relief under the poor law act, for there is no other alternative for them but to go to the work-house as soon as the poor law is in operation in their district. [7]\n\nDeath\n\nHe died at the age of 64 at Courtown House, Gorey, County Wexford, Ireland, on the 20th of November 1858.[3]\n\nTitles\n\n4th Earl of Courtown, co. Wexford [I., 1762] on 15 June 1835.[1]\n\n4th Viscount Stopford [I., 1762] on 15 June 1835.[1]\n\n3rd Baron Saltersford, of Saltersford, co.
