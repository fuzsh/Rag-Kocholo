        "text": "The pursuit of the lesser-spotted inherited country house is not – happily – an overly trodden path. The most substantial recent footprints are certainly those left by the late Hugh Massingberd whose works on the subject either as author or supervising editor remain key resources. The mighty Massingberd was also a game-changing obituaries editor at the Daily Telegraph for eight years until 1994. That his stamp there endures is evidenced by the subject and tone of an obituary which appeared in the edition of 8 Aug 2011: ‘In addition to terrorising barmen and waiters the world over by vigorously rejecting any cocktail failing to meet his exacting standards, Godsal had a profound dislike of beards’.\n\nMassingberd’s 1988 book Country houses and their owners includes a chapter on Iscoyd Park, a house on the Shropshire-Flintshire border acquired by the Godsals in 1843. Barely three years later this family would effectively double up, the son & heir marrying Charlotte Garth, ‘heiress,‘ Massingberd noted, ‘of Haines Hill, one of England’s finest ‘unknown’ houses‘.†\n\nLast year, Iscoyd Park and it’s present-day Godsal incumbents were the subject of a revealing half-hour BBC programme [here] and only last month the estate was among the winners of the inaugural Hudson’s Heritage Industry Awards. Now, even though geographically better placed to do so, Handed on somehow can’t imagine that the embrace of the ‘heritage industry’ was ever on their relative’s agenda at Haines Hill. And while it’s no huge surprise that a house might remain relatively obscure and little known out in the far-flung rural shires, how much more impressive to achieve such a state on the fringe of the home counties?\n\nMore precisely, two miles east of Reading.\n\n‘I have not seen this house myself, as Mr A. Godsal refused my request to see it,‘ reads the reputation-defining footnote to the entry for Haines Hill in Pevsner’s Berkshire (1966). Alan Godsal’s Telegraph obituary (which carried one of the few readily available images of the house) records that ‘the estate had been almost beggared funding the Garth Hunt over many years’…\n\n…by the time he inherited from his great-uncle in 1938, aged 12. The hunt¹ was founded and run for 50 years by Thomas Colleton Garth who, like Godsal, had been born at Haines Hill and would die there 85 years later (in 1907). The detail, left, from a local press archive shows the Garth in 1930 assembled in front of the gabled south face of the mansion. This Jacobean / Queen Anne back section of Haines Hill (including a C16 gallery compared to such at Bramshill) predates the present family’s association here. This may have begun in the 1720s but was certainly cemented with the arrival of James Edward Colleton² to whom would devolve the considerable colonial estates initiated by the adventurous exploits of his great-grandfather, Sir John.\n\nJohn Colleton* had lost a fortune backing the King in the Civil War and took off for the nascent colony of Barbados to lick his wounds. At the Restoration he was among those rewarded for their loyalty with the grant of ‘large dominions’ in North America. From his new South Carolina base, Colleton became a prime mover behind the Royal African Company, a slick and profitable slave trade operation. Over time, the family would accrue significant commercial interests in Barbados (some of which continue to this day).\n\nTwice married but without issue³, James Edward Colleton would make his mark at Haines Hill with the addition in 1760 of the dominant nine-bay Georgian front furnished by top-draw craftsmen and adorned with works by the A-team of British portraiture. The entire re-roofing of this section was just one of many improvements undertaken latterly by Alan Godsal as he grappled with a ‘house which had suffered from nearly a century of bachelor occupation’.\n\nThe latter state of affairs was ended in 1962 with Godsal’s marriage to Lady Elizabeth Stopford, daughter of the Earl of Courtown, who survives him. The Daily Mail described the event as ‘one of the biggest of the season’, reporting how the ‘landed and loaded’ groom had laid on two coaches to bring 75 workers from the 2,500-acre estate up to town for the occasion.\n\nThese days, of course, weddings are big business for many country houses and few have committed as wholeheartedly to this kind of enterprise as the aforementioned Iscoyd Park (‘Very much your home for your wedding day‘). A distance of some 160 miles separates the Godsals of Shropshire and Haines Hill, Berkshire but simply in terms of their present-day visibility these places are poles apart…\n\n[G.II* listing]\n\n¹ Most recently amalgamated – somewhat uneasily – into the Kimblewick Hunt.\n\n² ‘The elder son of John Colleton, James Edward Colleton had inherited the family estate of Haines Hill in Berks. and the Barbadian plantations.’ [source]\n\n³ ‘James Edward Colleton died 30 Aug 1790. After his death Haines Hill and the Barbados plantations passed to the son of his cousin Charles Garth.‘ [source][Legacies of Slavery database entry]\n\n† Massingberd would know, Haines Hill and its occupants having also eluded Burke’s Landed Gentry, the last national edition of which he edited."
