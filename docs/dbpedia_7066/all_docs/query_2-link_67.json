        "text": "THE STROLLER returns to\n\nRainow—a village of ever changing moods.\n\nRAINOW, a village with rolling acres of beautiful green hill-country; in Cheshire, yet as un-Cheshire as any parish could be: a village of ever changing moods, which can enchant and frighten; a village of quiet peaceful valleys and wild moorland: a village with an industrial past — at on time it had many mills — a place where most of the cottages and ancient farmsteads are built from the stone hewn from the native hillsides; a village from which in the old days lovers walked hand in hand over the hills to Prestbury to be married — the path they took is still known by the older inhabitants as the marriage steps.\n\nYes. Rainow, one of the largest parishes in the county, abounds with fascinating stories and for the benefit of the many newcomers to the area, it is these which I propose to relate in the course of the next few weeks.\n\nThere are numerous stories to tell, of the days when coalpits, now disused, supplied fuel to a large part of Macclesfield; when the packhorse teams travelled through, carrying salt from mid-Cheshire to Derbyshire and returned loaded with lime.\n\nIn the 17th century, it is recorded, Rainow had two witches who were eventually slain at the Chester Michaelmas Assizes for having practised \"certain artes\" from which \"wicked and devillish acts certain Rainow people fell ill and died.\"\n\nThe whole of Rainow was in the Forest of Macclesfield and it was in the 16th and 17th centuries that portions were sold to private individuals. The late Mr. G. T. Smith, who had a lifelong association with Rainow, and whose parish duties took him regularly to almost every nook and cranny in the village, (few knew more about Rainow's history than him), once he told me that he had evidence of Ingersley Hall being owned by a T. Jarkson in 1658. Saltersford Hall, built in 1593, was the country house of the Stopfords, a descendant of whom was created Earl of Courtown in 1762. At one time this estate extended to 2,500 acres.Towe Hill was sold in 1611 by sir John Savage to E. Jackson, deputy bailiff of the manor, and later to a member of the Gaskell family.The One House estate, so long in the possession of the Hulley family was first mentioned in 1490.\n\nThere remain many reminders of these early days.Lots of the old farmhouses so well built houses of local stone, have since been converted into private residences.One of the most interesting, which I visited this week, is Old Blue Boar Farm now the home of Mrs Audrey Joan Oddy and her son Mr Timothy Oddy, a Macclesfield solicitor.\n\nIt was a meeting with Miss Edith Ward, J.P., of Waggs Road, Congleton, which set me off on my visit to Blue Boar.She had related to me the story of the Ward family, who resided at Blue Boar in the 18th century, in fact a member of the family is said to have built the farmhouse.\n\nIt was John Ward, of Blue Boar who gave the now famous Charleshead farmhouse Bible to Edmund Pott, of Charleshead in 1734.It is a leather bound copy of the 1611 Authorised Version, and it is stipulated that it shall never leave the farm.The inscription reads:\"This bible was given to John Ward of Blue Boar to Edmund Pott at Charles Head forever.It was his desire that great care should be taken of it.\" The bible has remained at Charleshead ever since.\n\nJoshua Ward, was born at Blue Boar in 1763. and both he and his wife, Mary, spent the whole of their lives in Rainow and are buried in Jenkin Chapel.Joshua was a farmer, as well as a worker in stone, for most men in that area could handle stone. as evidenced by the many dry-stone Walls which divide the fields in this hill - country parish. \"Joshua\", says Miss Ward \"did much more than that: he helped to erect many of The buildings around Rainow, and even walked over the moorland paths to assist in the building of the Cat and Fiddle Inn.\"\n\nDuring the latter part of his life he was assisted in the building operations by his son John, who married Betty Potts, Of Harrop Fold Farm, which could be seen from the back of Blue Boar, and John must have walked along the paths that connected the two farms. Now these paths are cut across by the Whaley Bridge . Macclesfield road and have fallen into disuse. In fact the whole area is a network of footpaths joining farms and converging on places of worship and country inns. John moved from farm to farm among the pleasant hill-country of East Cheshire, farming and building as his father had done before him.\n\nFOREMAN\n\n\"About this time when the Macclesfield canal was being built John Ward was drawn from the hills and became foreman of the bridge builders working in stone on the locks and bridges. There is the wonderful stone-built aqueduct of 20 arches spanning the River Dane at North Rode, and the Bollington aqueduct by the side of the River Dean. He later did much work for the new railways. The last job he did for the railways was to supply all the stonework for the Central Station at Macclesfield and for the culverts and drainage on Waters Green and along the side of Gas-road.\"\n\nMiss Ward described John as being a powerful man, standing 6ft 5.5in high. He rode horseback to visit the various sites. John Ward strode forth with a big stick to quell the quarrels between the gangs of English and Irish labourers camped in the fields, or working along the railway track. There were 2,000 workmen alone engaged on the building of the twenty arches at North Rode. John and his wife ended their days at Buglawton, near Congleton, and are buried in Buglawton churchyard.\n\nA number of families have lived at Blue Boar since the Wards left and Mrs. Oddy and her son took over residence there four and a half years ago. It had, however, previously been converted into the charming residence it is today by Mr. and Mrs. John\n\nCasson, who now live at Lower Withington. When the Cassons went to Blue Boar it was a farmhouse and the work of conversion took 12 months to complete. The attached shippon was converted into the kitchen with a bedroom above.\n\nThe area around Old Blue Boar farm is known as Blue Boar and alongside the Oddy's home is Blue Boar Farm which is not quite so old, but an attractive farmstead overlooking the hills as far away as Kinder Scout. This is wild country and the lane by the side is Eurin-lane, leading to Jenkin Chapel and then onto the Goyt Valley.\n\nOld Blue Boar Farm is a wonderful example of how these sturdily stone built farmhouses can be converted into private homes. The oak beams, which run through the building like dark veins, have all been uncovered. Those which had perished through age were renewed.\n\nSTONE-BUILT\n\nThere is a stone built open fireplace in the living room and from the rear window looking across the valley to the hills beyond one can watch the changing seasons of the year. The dining room is very much as it was in the building's farmhouse days. Both upstairs and downstairs there are long corridors, off which are the entrances to the various rooms.\n\nThis ancient farmhouse, converted with loving care,is today furnished in such a way that as soon as one enters one is filled with a feeling that here is a lived in home; a home which almosts shouts out \"welcome\" to visitors.It is a wonderful retreat for two busy people.\n\nThe Oddy's came to Rainow from Buxton. Mrs Oddy a widow, was at one time a member of the Buxton Borough Council, and took an active interest in various local organisations.\n\nRecently Miss Ward returned the original date stone of Blue Boar to Mrs. Oddy. It reads \"T.W.1749\". It was probably removed when alterations were being made.\n\nWhy Blue Boar I like the story related in the book: \"History of Methodism in Macclesfield area\", which gives this explanation: \"Tradition, which tells us that at Wildboarclough, not many miles from Rainow, the last wild boar which had roamed at large in this neighbourhood was killed, also affirms that near to this farmstead, a wild boar of remarkable colour was once slain.\"\n\nIt is also stated that among the Methodists of Rainow at these times Edward Hampson was prominent. He was born at Blue Boar farm in 1739.His father rented a small farm at Lyme, but was drowned while crossing a running stream, leaving 12 small children.\n\nAt one time, according to Dr. Sainter in his book \"Scientific Rambles around Macclesfield\" there was a conical tumili in a field opposite the Blue Boar Farm.\n\nLower down Eurin - lane is the memorial stone which attracts so much attention to visitors.On one side it reads: \"here John Turner was cast away in a heavy snowstorm in the night in or about the year 1735\" and on the other side: \"The print of a woman's shoe was found in the snow where he lay dead.\"The original stone (the present one is a new one placed there some years ago by the Parish Council) Mr. James Mellor, of Hough Hole, Rainow.It has been said that John Turner lived at Saltersford Hall, and that on the night of his death he was returning to his home from Hough Hole, where he had been courting Miss Mellor.The imprint of the woman's shoe may well have been a trick of the wind in the snow."
