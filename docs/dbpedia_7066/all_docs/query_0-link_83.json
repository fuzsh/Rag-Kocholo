From the evidence it appeared, that the deceased had been in the habit of drinking heavily, and to that degree as to affect his mind, and for the last twelve months, at times, appeared in very low spirits and desponding. On Saturday morning, the day on which he committed the fatal act, he appeared as usual, and was seen by Aaron STEER coming from one of the stables with a halter in his hand. Steer went to his breakfastas usual; returning about half an hour afterwards he went into the hay loft, and there he found the deceased hanging suspended to the side bar by a halter. Assistance being immediately procured he was cut down, and Mr HUGGINS, a surgeon, sent for, who bled him, and used other applications without effect, life being extinct. The deceased has left a widow and six children, all of them very young, to mourn his untimely end. The verdict returned was, \"that the deceased hung himselg in a fit of temporary insanity\".NickR FJ18171209NPMSTEINJohnEsqAt Castle Bellingham, John STEIN Esq of Clonmel to Eliza eldest daughter of Alan BELLINGHAM and niece to Sir William BELLINGHAM BtNickR LGA18171209NPMSTEINJohnEsqAt Castle Bellingham church by the Rev John FORTESQUE, John STEIN Esq of Clonmel to Eliza eldest daughter of Alan BELLINGHAM and niece to Sir William BELLINGHAM BtNickR FJ1860114NPMSTEINJohnEsqJanuary 9, at Ballycahane, John STEIN, Esq, Limerick, to Maria Mary, third daughter of the Rev Thomas CROKER of Maryville, vicar of AdareNickR WMT J1824902NPMSTENSONJohnEsqOn the 10th instant, in the Church of Kilmacshalgin, by the Rev.
