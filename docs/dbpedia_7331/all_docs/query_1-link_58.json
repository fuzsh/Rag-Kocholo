        "text": "Our broad portfolio of products and services builds secure networks for America that you can count on. Combined with our technology innovation and decades of experience and investment in US infrastructure, we offer a unique perspective on the costs and benefits of government policy initiatives.\n\nWith our multi-generational wireline and wireless communications equipment, we are committed to leading the America by adopting fast, secure 5G networks capable of revolutionizing lives, economies and societies.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has altered the way that we currently live, study and work. With our “new normal” of working from home, virtual meetings and conferences, to new mandates – network connectivity has become an essential resource that drives our day-to-day activities in order to stay connected.\n\nHowever, millions of Americans are still deprived of this crucial utility and 25% of children do not have access to the internet nor broad connect to be able to complete their homework and lectures, opening the digital divide to those of more low-income or people of color.\n\nDiscover how Nokia is bridging the digital divide as it delivers broadband connectivity to all Americans.\n\n2020 was a remarkable year for us all, where the COVID-19 pandemic changed our increase in demand and reliance on “mission critical networks” so that we can stay connected and power the critical infrastructure that keep America in business.\n\nRead about the heroes working behind the scenes to build and operate the networks that keep us going\n\nSince COVID began impacting our lives, it’s no longer just about connectivity – it’s also about vulnerability. Unserved and underserved households are, at best, economically vulnerable. At worst, they lack access to life-enhancing and potentially life-saving services.\n\nRural broadband is vital for getting the U.S. economy and the society going again. The telco industry has a great responsibility to bring technologies that will make the society smarter, safer and better – no matter what.\n\nWe are committed to helping you succeed by creating a sustainable and profitable rural broadband business. Our solutions are optimized for rural broadband and can be evolved to 10 Gigabit and software-defined network (SDN) infrastructure – whenever you are ready for it.\n\nWatch Nokia take lead in manufacturing for the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. Nokia’s contribution as the first telecom company to announce the manufacturing of fiber-optic broadband network electronic products for the BEAD program in the U.S. will connect every home with high-speed internet.\n\nJoin CEO, Pekka Lundmark, the vice president of the U.S., Kamala Harris, and the Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, who came together to announce this big step for the future of broadband networks.\n\nThe most important take out the pandemic may have given us is that when the world really wants to change something fast, it can. In March 2020, cities emptied out overnight and the world went online, showing that we can all pivot at speed when we try. It’s this kind of rapid change that we now need to see with regard to climate topics across the corporate world.\n\nThere is no single road to achieving the 2030 sustainability goals or further on to a zero carbon world. We can all take actions on a personal level but also on a business, community, city and country level. Decarbonization is needed across the board and digitalization will play a critical role.\n\nDigitalization is critical for making industries more sustainable – resulting in less waste, more resource efficiency and greater productivity. For instance, in the energy sector, digitalization can help wind farm operators automate offshore windfarms, allowing them to operate more productively. In agriculture, the adoption of digital technology can increase yields, reduce costs, and cut water use. Across manufacturing, converting to smart manufacturing can help secure annual productivity and energy-saving gains of 10-20%. While recent research suggests the COVID-19 pandemic speeded up digitalization by an average of six years, the greater part of the world’s economy lacks access to key digital technologies.\n\nWatch our CEO, Pekka Lundmark speaking on COP26 about accelerated digitalizaton.\n\nInnovation is in our blood. Technology fuels us. For more than 150 years, we have been creating the critical networks and technologies to bring together the world’s intelligence, across businesses, cities, supply chains and societies.\n\nTruly committed to innovation, recognized globally for our technology leadership, and driven by the award-winning Nokia Bell Labs and our global innovation hubs, we constantly push the boundaries to achieve the impossible and to inspire the next generation of future-forward thinkers.\n\nWith more than 3,000 essential 5G patents and 129 billion Euros in R&D investment in the past decades, we have invested in the extraordinary opportunities to unleash the value of 5G worldwide.\n\nWith three main innovation hubs and six R&D sites based in the US, we are making significant investments in technology developments, enabling the US to be a global technology leader.\n\nDiscover how we are driving life-changing innovation\n\nNetwork evolution towards the 6G era\n\nEven though there is still a lot of innovation in 5G with the 5G-Advanced release of new standards, Nokia Bell Labs has already begun the research work on 6G to make it commercially available by 2030.\n\nWe are a founding member of the Next G Alliance, leveraging its strong role in deploying 5G in the US, to shape the direction of 6G.\n\nIn the 6G era, the digital, physical and human world will seamlessly fuse to trigger extrasensory experiences. Intelligent knowledge systems will be combined with robust computation capabilities to make humans endlessly more efficient and redefine how we live, work and take care of the planet.\n\nLearn more about the benefits of 6G\n\n“The 6G marathon is just beginning, but by working together, we can accelerate innovation, leverage research to solve industry challenges and help attain 6G technology leadership in the US. Now is the time for foundational 6G research.”\n\nDevaki Chandramouli\n\nHead of North American Standardization at Nokia\n\n“The role of next-generation networks is the unification of our experience across the physical, digital and human world”\n\nHarish Viswanathan\n\nHead of Radio Systems Research at Nokia Bell Labs\n\nWe have opened our first Open RAN (O-RAN) Collaboration and Testing Center at our offices in Dallas, Texas. The center is designed to support the development of partnerships among O-RAN vendors that will help with the verification, introduction and launch of O-RAN compliant solutions to market.\n\nIn particular, vendors will be able to execute Interoperability Tests (IOT) and end-to-end testing for O-RU/O-DU Open Fronthaul as well as xAPP testing for Nokia’s near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). The project is the latest in our continued commitment to O-RAN, vRAN and Edge Cloud innovation.\n\nWe have plans to open similar facilities at our other global offices around the world in the future.\n\nBuilding on our history of industry collaboration on open standards that securely accelerate innovation and enable new business models.\n\nUS leader in O-RAN R&D, leading two specification workgroups\n\nJoint development of O-RAN Radio Intelligent Controller with AT&T\n\nFirst infrastructure vendor to join O-RAN, TIP and the Open RAN Policy Coalition\n\nForeign Policy, in partnership with Nokia, exploring the promise and potential of Open RAN to support a robust and competitive 5G ecosystem and advance the development of emerging network technologies.\n\nExplore our Open RAN solution\n\nNokia is committed to lead an open mobile future with strong network performance and security.\n\nWe are enabling a robust 5G ecosystem through our investment in Open RAN and Cloud RAN.\n\nAs 5G continues to be rolled out, the industry has begun to explore the potential benefits of an expanded ecosystem of mobile access players in the market. Communications Service Providers (CSPs), vendors and even governments are working together to define the role of open standards and how they can help evolve 5G networks to support new services and enhanced efficiency. Open Radio Access Network (RAN) sits at the heart of this discussion.\n\nWe believe all industry stakeholders must jointly create a path for the adoption of Open RAN. CSPs and vendors need to work together to contribute to standard definitions, including Open RAN interfaces, and define an adoption plan.\n\nBy enabling innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applied to the RAN, Open RAN will create many benefits. These include improved network performance; accelerated time-tomarket of new services and functions; more flexible and agile networks; and CAPEX and OPEX efficiencies."
