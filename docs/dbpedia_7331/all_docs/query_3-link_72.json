        "text": "Rebecca McCaig\n\nNovember 5, 2021\n\nThis company is amazing. They are really responsive and quickly address my concerns with our rental. I have been working with Juan Escobedo and he always keeps me updated on my work orders. Mynd is lucky to have him as an employee. He gets the 5 stars.\n\nNovita Indah Sari\n\nDecember 6, 2021\n\nYes I've had a great experience with Mynd Especially with getting things fixed in property. The moment I submit a work order I automatically feel confident because I know the job is going to get done, and Chad always makes sure I'm comfortable with the work and that I'm satisfied , and all I want to say is KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!\n\nPhyllis Ruff\n\nJanuary 31, 2022\n\nMichael was very helpful in arranging for me to view several properties on the same day to minimize my searching time. He asked questions to confirm that I had the necessary information available to make the proper decision on selecting a rental property. Booking an in-person tour was simple!\n\nAnthony Delserro\n\nFebruary 16, 2022\n\nWillie P. Has been such an integral part of our settling into our new home. Upon moving in there were a couple issues that needed to be fixed and Willie had them serviced right away with a quick turnaround time and zero friction. He’s been incredibly communicative and patient and helpful during the process and without him none of these maintenance issues would’ve been addressed as quickly. He had everything fixed in a timely manner and responded to any and every questions we had along the way. He’s been our primary source of truth and he deserves five stars for all the work and time he’s put into helping us settle into our new home. Thanks Willie!\n\nBrienne Herbert\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nI haven't been with Mynd for very long, but they have seemed to impress me thus far. We had an issue with our heat not working. I contacted Mynd through their app, and had a quick response from one of their representatives. That representative was Napoleon Fernández. He was fantastic! He got someone to come out as quickly as possible. That someone was Stephen from Comfort Services. Stephen fixed our heat and made sure everything was working properly before leaving. During all this, Napoleon stayed in contact making sure that the problem was being solved. I can't thank these two enough for their hard work to ensure that we were taken care of.\n\nAch Naufal Firdaus\n\nDecember 27, 2021\n\nReported an issue with my A/C and Chad Santos responded in a very prompt and timely manner. He scheduled a vendor to make the repairs and everything was done within a day and a half. Great service and very professional.\n\nTara Douglas\n\nJanuary 23, 2022\n\nI was so impressed with my customer service rep, Mark D. I was at a house, it was dark, and I couldn’t open the lock box. I called the number provided for “problems.\" Mark D. Answered right away. He was extremely polite, kind, and helpful. I got in within minutes. Mark stayed on the phone with me for a while. I was a little nervous being in the house with it so dark outside. He answered questions and was just very pleasant! Thank you Mark!\n\nBeau Sydes\n\nApril 13, 2021\n\nI found Mynd while doing an online PM search. The things that really attracted me to this company were their assurances and additional guarantees offered in their top package. They are a full service property manager, so they handle everything which makes my life a lot easier. Amy Perry had done a good job communicating to me when needed during on boarding and ongoing management issues. Danni was professional on the phone and was helpful and responsive to recommendations I gave them. I would recommend Mynd to anyone looking for a Property Management Company."
