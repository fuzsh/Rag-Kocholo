        "text": "Google Fi Wireless provides fast, reliable nationwide 4G LTE and 5G coverage through the T-Mobile network. Google Fi Wireless is not subject to data traffic deprioritization, which means you won't experience slowed data speeds during times of high network usage. Additionally Google Fi Wireless users have access to multiple carrier networks to stay connected as they travel domestically and around the world.\n\nPixel users running Android 12 and above can get access to the W+ network when available if they have the Fi VPN enabled. The W+ network uses select secure, high-quality Wi-Fi networks to improve your mobile data connection in highly congested areas, like certain airports, malls and stadiums.\n\nThe Google Fi Wireless network also extends to 200+ countries and territories . On the Flexible and Unlimited Plus plans, you're automatically covered with data abroad at no extra charge and no advanced setup required. Phones sold on fi.google.com are able to get coverage from multiple carriers internationally. Additionally, for supported Pixel and Samsung phones, 5G coverage is available in select countries and territories.\n\nOn Fi, you'll get built-in privacy for your online activity. All phones on Fi get access to a VPN for a private online connection. When enabled, it encrypts your online activity when you use cellular data and Wi-Fi.\n\nYou can see where you're covered with the coverage map, and learn more about international coverage on our website.\n\nYes. If you have an Android phone or iPhone® that supports 5G, you'll get nationwide 5G included on all Fi plans.\n\nFi supports the following 5G network capabilities:\n\nmmWave 5G: Provides the fastest 5G speeds. Available in select urban areas.\n\nStandalone 5G: Provides fast coverage in more places. While some 5G networks require 4G network availability to work, standalone 5G networks use 5G technology end-to-end, which means you can access 5G even in areas where 4G is not available.\n\n5G DSDS (Fi dual connect technology): With Fi dual connect technology on Pixel phones, you can connect to two networks at once — including a 5G network — which means you can be on the best signal even more quickly and frequently.\n\nCurrently, Fi provides international 5G roaming in the following countries and territories for supported Pixel and Samsung phones: Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom .\n\nPixel users running Android 12 and above can get access to the W+ network when available if they have the Fi VPN enabled. The W+ network uses select secure, high-quality Wi-Fi networks to improve your mobile data connection in highly congested areas, like certain airports, malls and stadiums. When connected, you'll see \"W+\" in your network settings and top of your screen.\n\nWhen you're on the W+ network, your internet traffic is encrypted and private. Data used when connected to W+ will count towards your total Fi data usage and will be charged according to your plan.\n\nYou may opt out of being automatically connected to the W+ network at any time. To learn more, visit our Help Center.\n\nOn all phones on Fi, you get access to a VPN for an encrypted and private connection when you use cellular data and Wi-Fi. It provides data protection by shielding you against hackers on unsecure networks (like public Wi-Fi), and prevents websites from using your IP address to track your location.\n\nMost apps will connect through the VPN, but some apps may bypass the VPN in order to work as intended (for example, so your smart home devices can work). You can manage this setting in the Fi app. Note that apps critical to Fi services will always connect outside the VPN. VPNs use mobile data for encryption and network optimizations.\n\nTo learn more, visit our Help Center.\n\nYes. More detail below:\n\nPhones sold on fi.google.com: Just make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi and make a call like you normally would using the phone dialer.\n\nPhones compatible with Fi (may vary by phone): If you have an Android phone, you can turn on Wi-Fi calling on the \"Phone settings\" page in the Google Fi Wireless app. If you have an iPhone®, you can turn on Wi-Fi calling from the iOS Settings page.\n\nFor all phones, if Wi-Fi and cellular networks are available, Fi will route your call over whichever one gives you the best experience. For more information on Wi-Fi calling, please visit our Help Center."
