These cameras and sensors simultaneously feed into the City's Operations Center, where day-to-day coordination of city services and emergency response occurs.\n\nData Retention: The OEMC follows the below retention schedule for it's technical data. The schedule is documented in an Application for Authority to Dispose of Local Records, filed with the Local Records Commission of Cook County (Application No. 02:019C).
