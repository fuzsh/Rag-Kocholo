        "text": "The USA Network app allows users to catch up on the most recent season of their favorite shows, watch live TV, and stream movies and past-season content. Download the app via the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. Once installed, click on Start Watching and enter your login credentials. These will be your TV subscriptionâ€”cable, satellite, or digital. You can watch your favourites anywhere, anytime. At the same time, the app lets individuals contact the USA Network customer service team.\n\nUSA Network does not have a dedicated customer service email address. However, if your queries are related to legal issues, you can use several email addresses. For instance, if you have DMCA inquiries, you can send your queries to dmca.agent@nbcuni.com. For privacy-related issues and inquiries, the email address is privacy@nbcuni.com. Apart from the USA Network channel number and legal email addresses, customers can also utilize the online form available on the website to contact the customer service team. To submit your ticket, head to the official website and navigate to the Contact Us option on the home page's bottom right corner. Next, you can select the subject or program you require help with from the USA Network customer service team. Then, complete the form with your name, email address, issue type, subject of your concern, and a brief description of your issue. The customer service team will review the form and respond to you."
