        "text": "Affordable Housing\n\nCatholic Charities agencies are among the nation’s largest providers of safe, decent, affordable housing, with more than 38,000 permanent units for families, seniors, veterans and others, as well as temporary and emergency housing.\n\nFood and Nutrition\n\nCatholic Charities provides healthy food options for those at risk of hunger via food banks and pantries, schools, child and adult daycare centers, summer lunch programs, group dining settings, community farms and more.\n\nIntegrated Health\n\nThrough care for the whole person — physical, mental and spiritual well-being, or integral human development — everyone can realize their full potential. Agencies offer services including counseling and mental health care, addiction recovery and support, case management and caregiver support.\n\nDisaster Relief\n\nCCUSA is the official domestic relief agency of the U.S. Catholic Church, providing critical, immediate humanitarian support and long-term aid to rebuild lives and restore hope in communities devastated by natural and human-made disasters.\n\nSocial Enterprise and Workforce Development\n\nThese programs offer strategies to improve an individual’s potential in the workplace while contributing to the alleviation of poverty. Social enterprise business models build community alliances and healthy communities, and workforce development programs encourage innovation and job growth.\n\nImmigration Services\n\nCatholic Charities agencies provide care to all our sisters and brothers, many of whom come to us in their time of greatest need. Our ministry to vulnerable people on the move is a cornerstone of our Catholic identity.\n\nFoundational Services\n\nRooted in the belief that every person is made in God’s image, Catholic Charities responds to clients’ economic, social, cultural, personal and spiritual needs, from conception to natural death. Programs help those served — especially those living in poverty — reach their full potential.\n\nParish Engagement\n\nCatholic Charities has a more than 100-year history of engaging with parishes and supporting their efforts to live out the Gospel, to care for the poor and vulnerable and to work for justice."
