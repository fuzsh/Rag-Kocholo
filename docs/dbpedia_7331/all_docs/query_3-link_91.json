        "text": "Where are the best places to buy rental property this year? As a seasoned real estate investor who has been buying single-family and multi-family real estate for decades in the United States and abroad, this is a question I get asked a lot. To help you narrow down the best market for your real estate investment goals, we’ve rounded up the top choices for 2024 and into 2025.\n\nBest Places to Buy Rental Property Quick Links\n\nBefore we dive into our best places to buy rental property for 2024, here are some tips for analyzing potential real estate markets.\n\n3 FACTORS FOR ANALYZING A REAL ESTATE MARKET\n\nBefore researching and analyzing markets, you’ll want clarity on your real estate investment goals to avoid making impulse decisions. Ask yourself, “What do I want from my investment?” Knowing your goals and the answer to this question is critical to creating your best real estate investment strategy.\n\nI’ve found that the best cities to invest in have three factors in common: job growth, population growth and affordability.\n\n1. Job Growth\n\nBecause population growth correlates with the availability of job opportunities, real estate investors should prioritize markets where job opportunities are expanding.\n\nWhen assessing a location for a strong job market, here are key points to keep in mind:\n\nNumber of jobs. The amount of jobs in an area signifies which locations are experiencing growth and which are not.\n\nRise in median salary. The median salary is the midpoint of all wages. When it rises, it indicates a growing economy with a demand for skilled workers.\n\nJob diversity. A strong mix of industries and workforce signifies an area is on an upward momentum.\n\nCommercial buildings. When the economy improves, industries expand and more commercial buildings and towers are built.\n\n2. Population Growth\n\nDespite what the numbers on your pro forma may say, a rental property only brings in revenue if you can find someone willing to rent it. To determine the best places to buy rental property for 2024, look for areas with high population growth and housing demand.\n\nTo analyze a region’s real estate market, look for signs of increasing population, as this often equates to increased demand for housing. Real estate markets with growing populations also tend to have strong economies. When more jobs are available, more people can afford to pay rent.\n\nWhen demand for houses outpaces supply, home prices rise and rents increase. When you invest in rental properties in an area with high population growth and housing demand, your investment should pay off over time as rents rise.\n\n3. Affordability\n\nEvery housing market has its own pricing and market trends. When researching where to invest in rental property, different factors come into play. Here are three you’ll want to make note of:\n\nLocation. A property’s location, including the city and neighborhood, plays a big role in its current value, appreciation potential, and how long it takes to recoup your initial investment. At RealWealth, we suggest investors avoid high-priced markets like New York City, Los Angeles, or San Francisco and instead focus on markets with growing appreciation and job growth like Baltimore, Maryland, San Antonio, Texas, and Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nPrice-to-rent ratio. Investors use this benchmark number to gauge an area’s potential profitability. To find this number, divide the median home price by the median yearly rent. The calculated number lets you know if renting or owning a property is cheaper. A price-to-rent ratio of 15 or lower favors buying, while 21 and above means it’s cheaper to rent than buy. The higher the price-to-rent ratio, the worse the market is for real estate investing (rentals in particular). It also translates to lower cash flow potential. Conversely, an area with affordable real estate but increasing rents will almost always make for a good investment.\n\nFixer Upper. A fixer-upper in a popular or up-and-coming neighborhood can also be a good investment if you have the time, money and experience to make improvements that increase rent and property values.\n\nWhen you find a market with all three factors – job growth, population growth, and affordability – you’ll likely be able to find good real estate investment opportunities for both cash flow and appreciation.\n\nTo help you with your market research, we’ve rounded up 25 of the best places to buy rental property for 2024 and into 2025. We’ll also explain why these markets are strong for investors.\n\nWHERE IS THE BEST PLACE TO BUY RENTAL PROPERTY?\n\n25 CITIES TO CONSIDER IN 2024 AND INTO 2025\n\nPlease Note: The following real estate markets are ranked according to our estimation of their cash flow and appreciation potential. We’ve made this determination based on insights from RealWealth Investment Counselors, who are highly experienced real estate investors who own property in many of these markets.\n\nUsing the expertise of our local property team networks, we’ve pulled together and analyzed current home value and rental data based on the current inventory, as well as metro area historical home value and rental data (dating back to 2014) using Zillow’s Housing Data spreadsheets. In addition, we’ve researched and calculated metro population growth for the last eleven years using Census.gov and annual job growth using data from the Department of Numbers.\n\nWe’ve completed months of research to update this article for 2024. However, please do your due diligence when deciding which real estate market to invest in and which property to purchase. This is the only way to ensure you make the best investment decision for your goals and financial situation.\n\n#1 – Dallas, Texas\n\nOften referred to as DFW or The Metroplex by locals, the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area is the bustling hub of North Texas. It covers 12 counties, with two main areas—Dallas–Plano–Irving and Fort Worth–Arlington—leading the economic growth of Texas.\n\nIt is anticipated to be America’s third-biggest metro area by 2030, with a projected population of up to 10 million residents. Currently ranked fifth for its economic size among other U.S. metro areas, Dallas had a gross domestic product (GDP) of approximately 688.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, clearly showing a continuing economic growth and stability trend in one of the best investment property locations.\n\nAbout the Dallas Housing Market\n\nDallas’s real estate market has evolved thanks to forward-thinking development and a diverse economy. Although it was once known for cotton and oil, Dallas has expanded into other industries, such as tech and finance. This diversity has helped the real estate market stay strong. The Dallas housing market has remained stable, even during economic uncertainty, making it a good choice for investors.\n\nAccording to a recent PwC/Urban Land Institute report, Dallas-Fort Worth ranked fifth in homebuilding prospects and third in overall real estate prospects nationally. These rankings highlight Dallas-Fort Worth as a key ‘Super Sun Belt’ city and a magnet for real estate investment.\n\nWith the most multi-family units in 2022 and a healthy vacancy rate of 6.1%, Dallas-Fort Worth has a well-balanced supply and demand. This means real estate in Dallas is still more affordable for investors than other large metro areas, making it one of the best cities to buy rental property.\n\nDallas Housing Market Statistics\n\nMedian Household Income: $82,823\n\nMetro Population: 7.9 Million\n\n12-Year Population Growth: 24.27%\n\nMedian Home Price: $366,326\n\nMedian Rent Per Month: $1,787 (0.49% rent-to-value ratio)\n\n1-Year Equity Growth: 8.91%\n\n10-Year Equity Growth (January 2014 – January 2024): 115.52%\n\n1-Year Rent Growth: 4.07%\n\n10-Year Rent Growth (January 2014 – January 2024): 43.19%\n\nJob Growth: +144,399 CES jobs created over the last year\n\n1-Year Job Growth Rate: 3.46% (106% higher than the national average)\n\nUnemployment Rate: 3.3% (11% lower than the national average)\n\nDallas Housing Market Quick Facts\n\nHome prices in the Dallas metro area have grown by an impressive 115.52% over the last 10 years at a rate of 8.91%, making it one of the fastest-appreciating housing markets in the country.

Its population is over 948,000, and the metro area has a population of 1.6 million. The city’s growing population and attractions make it an appealing destination for people moving from higher-cost regions, particularly the Northeast.

This mix of industries ensures that the area’s employment and economic prospects are not tied to the fortunes of a single sector, making it a well-rounded choice for investment.\n\nAbout the Jacksonville Housing Market\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014, a period marked by relatively little multi-family construction, the housing crisis led to an increase in rental households. This contributed to declining vacancy rates and rising rents in Jacksonville, setting the stage for its current real estate boom.\n\nDespite a surge in multi-family construction from 2015 onwards, rising rents continued. This was partially due to an influx of migrants into the Housing Market Area (HMA), which resulted in a tighter rental market and positioned Jacksonville as a thriving real estate investment hotspot.\n\nOver the last ten years, the area has added more than 100,000 residents. This influx of new residents is particularly pronounced in St. Johns County, where the population has increased by 44%. This higher-than-average level of net in-migration has resulted in much more substantial population growth, averaging 30,900 people or 2.1% annually from 2013 to the present.\n\nAs of January 2024, the median home price within the city is $290,000, an increase of 3.2% year-over-year. This combination of relatively low home prices, high rental rates, and significant property appreciation rates makes the Jacksonville real estate market one of the best places to buy rental property.\n\nJacksonville Housing Market Statistics\n\nMedian Household Income: $77,583\n\nMetro Population: 1.6 Million\n\n12-Year Population Growth: 24.22%\n\nMedian Home Price: $351,548\n\nMedian Rent Per Month: $1,737 (0.49% rent-to-value ratio)\n\n1-Year Equity Growth: 8.53%\n\n10-Year Equity Growth (January 2014- January 2024): 108.85%\n\n1-Year Rent Growth: 5.06%\n\n10-Year Rent Growth (January 2014 – January 2024): 55.98%\n\nJob Growth: +29,400 CES jobs created over the last year\n\n1-Year Job Growth Rate: 3.75% (123% higher than the national average)\n\nUnemployment Rate: 2.9% (22% lower than the national average)\n\nJacksonville Housing Market Quick Facts\n\nWith an average single-family home price of $351,548, the Jacksonville market has experienced remarkable appreciation, growing by 108.85% over the last 10 years at an annual rate of 8.53%.\n\nRental rates have grown substantially, with the average single-family rent reaching $1,737.
