        "text": "Origins\n\nThe company’s history traces to 1926, when the Radio Corporation of America (now RCA Corporation) and two other firms founded the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) to operate a nationwide radio broadcasting network. NBC expanded so rapidly that by 1927 it found itself with an excess of affiliates in the same cities, so it split its programming into two separate networks, called the Red and the Blue networks. After the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) declared in 1941 that no company could own more than one radio network, NBC in 1943 sold the less-lucrative Blue Network to Edward J. Noble, the millionaire maker of Life Savers candy, who initially renamed it the American Broadcasting System before settling on the name the American Broadcasting Company, Inc. (ABC). ABC was the smallest of the major radio networks and distinguished itself by hiring popular singer Bing Crosby to perform on a weekly variety series. As a precondition for his employment, Crosby required that he be allowed to prerecord the program for later broadcast; as a result, ABC became a pioneer in the field of magnetic recording.\n\nFocus on television\n\nABC turned its attention to television in 1948 but met with little success until it merged with United Paramount Theatres (UPT), formerly the movie-exhibition arm of Paramount Pictures. The $25 million sale of ABC to UPT, which was headed by Leonard Goldenson, was announced in 1951 but was not approved by the FCC until 1953. (In 1955 ABC also entered the recording business with the purchase of a subsidiary and, over the years, under the consolidated ABC Records Division, developed such labels as ABC, Westminster, Dot, and Impulse.) Even though the merger provided ABC with a much-needed infusion of capital, the network still lacked the resources to match the expensive live programming offered by the Columbia Broadcast System (CBS) and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). ABC found a solution to its competitive disadvantage by entering into mutually beneficial deals with major Hollywood producers to provide top-quality filmed programs. The first such producer was Walt Disney, whose popular Disneyland anthology series premiered on ABC in 1954 and enabled the network to attract big-money advertisers and expand its roster of local affiliates. The network also forged a profitable alliance with Warner Brothers, which provided ABC with the popular western Maverick (1957–62), the private-eye series 77 Sunset Strip (1958–64), and other successful programs.\n\nSpecializing in offbeat programming calculated to set it apart from the other networks, ABC entered into such risky ventures as The Flintstones (1960–66), a prime-time animated cartoon series, and Batman (1966–68), a live-action spoof of comic-book superheroes, that paid off in huge ratings and profits. And after unsuccessfully trying to wrest away the major American sports events from NBC and CBS, ABC developed the omnibus series Wide World of Sports (1961–98), which, along with its groundbreaking weeknight telecast of the National Football League, Monday Night Football (1970–2005, and on cable subsidiary ESPN beginning in 2006), served as the cornerstone for the network’s long dominance in the field of televised athletic competition under the leadership of ABC Sports president Roone Arledge.\n\nABC’s golden era began with the arrival of programming executive Fred Silverman in 1975. Establishing a schedule of audience-pleasing situation comedies (Happy Days [1974–84], Laverne and Shirley [1976–83], and Three’s Company [1977–84]) and sexually charged dramatic series (Charlie’s Angels [1976–81], The Love Boat [1977– 86], and Fantasy Island [1978–84]), Silverman rapidly elevated ABC to the coveted number one slot. Perhaps to counteract criticism of its lowbrow entertainment fare, the network offered a number of prestige projects during the Silverman years, notably the blockbuster miniseries Roots (1977). ABC also earned praise as the first network to hire a woman (Barbara Walters) to anchor its nightly newscast, although its news division did not fully blossom until the advent of the current-events series 20/20 (1978– ) and Nightline (1980– )."
