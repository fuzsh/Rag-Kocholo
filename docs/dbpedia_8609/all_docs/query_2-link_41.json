        "text": "Dear Writers, Please note: This is the Last Chance To Save $100 on the IFS + Memoir Writing Online Class with Lissa Rankin & Frank Anderson, MD. If you have parts that have been on the fence about starting the New Year off with a memoir writing class that can help deepen your personal IFS practice; now is the time to resolve those inner polarizations, chat with your financial parts that like deals, and make a Self-led decision! The price goes up $100 on Sunday, but you can still get the early bird special if you register in the next hours. This class is for you if: • You feel called to tell your trauma-to-transformation story, but you’re concerned about the safety to your own psyche of revisiting painful memories that might make for a riveting memoir but might also cause backlash if those multi-sensory memories are not retrieved in a trauma-informed way; • You feel like you have a story buried deep inside that you need to get out of your body and onto the page; You are interested in integrating Internal Family Systems (IFS) and therapeutic memoir writing as part of your own healing and creative process; • You know how awesome, dynamic, creative, and energetic Frank Anderson, MD is as an IFS teacher and you can’t wait to see how he and Lissa collaborate now that they’re both published memoir-writing physicians and IFS people! We hope to see you in class! We hope to see you in class! https://lnkd.in/g7hNpwi3\n\nCall for Manuscripts We are now soliciting manuscripts of our upcoming issue, with the theme \"Geropsychology: Understanding and Helping Older Adults and their Families\" for the Spring issue of the NJ Psychologist. There is a substantial increase in the number of older adults in the United States. In 2019, adults 65 or older represented 16% of the population, more than 1 in every 7 Americans, and close to 1 in every 4 older adults are members of a racial or ethnic minority group. By 2060, the number of older adults is expected to make up nearly 25% of the US population. In addition to the increase in the risk of diseases such as dementia, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and cancer in aging, loneliness and social isolation in older adults present serious public health risks and have been associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide. The upcoming spring issue of the NJ Psychologist is soliciting articles that examine how the field addresses issues with this population. We welcome manuscripts of various types, such as research articles, reviews, and conceptual papers (whatever the methodology used) that seek to contribute to the analysis and understanding of the care involved in working with older adults. The manuscripts may focus on topics of coping with and managing chronic illness and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, and presentation of early-life trauma in later life; Dementia, Alzheimer's, and related behavioral and lifestyle changes for older individuals and their families; the impact of discrimination such as age discrimination, and discrimination based on the intersectionality of age and other aspects of individuals’ identities such as race, ethnicity, immigration/refugee status, gender identity, gender expression, developmental disability, acquired disability, and neurodiversity, etc.…; the impact of economic insecurity; other behavioral health concerns such as insomnia, pain, grief, and loss, including loss of decision making or everyday living abilities; family caregiving strains including the impact of changing roles; adjustment to aging-related stresses including marital/family conflict; end-of-life care; accessibility of health services and mental health care. For this issue, we are seeking General and Homestudy Continuing Education feature manuscripts in areas of research, assessment, and treatment of older persons. Additionally, we are interested in articles addressing the topic of academic and clinical training of psychologists in this area. Due Date: April 1st, 2024 *Please Email Nouriman Ghahary, Ph.D., New Jersey Psychologist Editor, with your General article proposal (or ideas/questions) at ghaharyn@felician.edu *Please Email CoCEA Homestudy Chair, Dr. Dennis Finger with your CE article ideas, at drfinger2@icloud.com Please also feel free to reach out with any questions about the writing and publication process or this special issue. Thank you! Nouriman Ghahary, Ph.D. Editor\n\nHaiku is a form of poetry that originated in Japan and is known for its simplicity and elegance. Writing haiku can be a fun and rewarding experience that can help improve creativity, critical thinking, and language skills. Personally, I found that writing haiku helped me express gratitude, courage, and humility, and improved my overall outlook on life. Haiku can be written for just about anything from humor to social awareness to evoking emotion. They are brief, poignant, and powerful, and can be a great way to express yourself creatively. So why not give haiku a try? You might be surprised at what you can say in just 17 syllables! Here’s haiku for you today: A moment of peace, Breathing in and letting go, Calmness in my soul! ❣️"
