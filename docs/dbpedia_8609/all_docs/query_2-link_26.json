        "text": "Comedic situations in cinema are often characterized by an effective yet limited set of formulae which prompt laughter in audiences. Consequently, patterns emerge across the genre, cementing recognizable tropes and situations that cater towards humor archetypes detached from grounded reality. In contrast, Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel provides an absurdist approach to humor, dissecting comedy into its composite parts and inversely reconstructing the genre utilizing a prevalent yet underlying mesh of reality. By extension, the film utilizes a tragic platform to elevate humor, applying meticulous mise-en-scène configurations, convoluted dialogue, and thematic imbalances to spearhead an unconventional approach toward comedy in contemporary cinema.\n\nComedy and comic conventions offer the possibility for laughter as a therapeutic and liberating force, as well as provide reflections on the absurdity of the everyday through the use of humour and chaos. This paper examines how Balkan comedies during the state socialist period used traditional comic conventions to offer critiques of the political and social systems, through analysis of three films: Ciguli Miguli (Branko Marjanović, Yugoslavia, 1952, released in 1977), Koncert në vitin 1936 (Concert in 1936, Saimir Kumbaro, Albania, 1978), and Господин за един ден (King for a Day, Nikolay Volev, Bulgaria, 1983). Drawing on the stylistic and visual conventions of silent comedies, these films create a range of comic characters and situations: the misadventures of peasant Purko in King for a Day, the water fight between musicians in Ciguli Miguli, and the policeman’s mannerisms in Concert in 1936. Furthermore, some common characteristics inherent to the cinema of Balkan countries in this period will be identified, such as the struggle between the value system of tradition vs. modernity, civilisation vs. primitiveness, European-ness vs. Balkan-ness, suggesting that such Balkanist constructs which continue to feature in popular cinema in the recent period, did not disappear but were internalised by the communist ideologies.\n\nPolitical humour, as an indispensable part of popular culture, played a complex role under communism in Romania. It was a catalyst of the general discontent towards the catastrophic effects of Ceaușescu's megalomaniac dictatorship, a forbidden, dangerous means of expressing opposition. This dynamic part of folklore captured and exposed essential aspects of life in communism, from the permanent fear of the Securitate to the ever-growing ridicule of the presidential couple and their acolytes. Unforgiving jokes targeting the Ceaușescus, now almost forgotten, rendered the grotesque portraits of the abusive, illiterate leaders of a totalitarian regime, radically contrasting with the official discourse that glorified them as heroes of socialism and parents of the nation. Drawing from a rich body of theoretical approaches to political humour and, particularly, political folklore, I intend to critically reread Romanian political humour of the communist era regarding Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu in order to question its role in transforming the public perception of autocratic power. Authors such as Egon Larsen, Dana Maria Nicolescu Grasso, Christie Davies and Eliott Oring, among others, have closely explored the complex territory of this limited yet significant cultural realm. I also intend to explore its specific traits as a potentially particular genre and re-evaluate some divergent theoretical stances that view gallows humour in a dictatorial regime either as a concrete protest or as a means of rerouting and defusing resentment. The creative richness of this rather dominant part of Romanian political humour of the 70s and 80s could reveal a unique territory in which caricature is nurtured by everyday despair.\n\nThere is a famous quotation that has been variously attributed to Mark Twain, Lenny Bruce, Carol Burnett, Steve Allen, Larry Gelbart, Mel Brooks, and a fictional character played by Alan Alda in Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). That quote is \"Comedy is Tragedy + Time.\" Can we successfully explore this old cliché to see if it has any use-value in terms of trauma and terror? Can we (and should we) find humor in excruciating personal, national, and global catastrophes? What is the ultimate role of comedy in our lives and in our cinemas-i.e., is film comedy a positive force that provides a coping mechanism for the eternal suffering of the human species or is it just another \"opiate of the masses\" that conceals the true nature of reality from our eyes? These are, of course, big questions-and the jury may still be out, unless the response is \"Yes, it's both!\" or \"It depends on the circumstances.\" Perhaps interrogating the issues of trauma and terror from the context of comedy will help us find a solution to a conundrum that many scholars thought had been settled, at least to their satisfaction, many years ago. This study examines these questions in connection with Roberto Benigni's Academy Award-winning LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (1998)"
