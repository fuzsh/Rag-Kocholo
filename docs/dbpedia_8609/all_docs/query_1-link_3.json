        "text": "BUCHAREST, Romania — Romanian director and writer Dinu Cocea, who made popular historical adventure movies before being forced into exile by the Communists, has died, his daughter tells a Romanian news agency. He was 84.\n\nCocea died of heart failure in a hospital in Paris on Thursday, daughter Oana Cocea was quoted by Mediafax as saying on Saturday.\n\nBorn into a well-known theatrical family, he debuted with “the Outlaws” in 1966 and made 15 movies in Romania. However, he had to emigrate to Paris in 1986 after he angered Communist censors with a script about a dam that was plagued by corruption.\n\nHe said in interviews that Romanian officials never forgave him. Returning after the 1989 revolution with plans to make a movie, he said he was asked to come up with $1 million, and the next day the sum was doubled\n\nThe American Academy of Film gave him an award in 2000 for his work.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors."
