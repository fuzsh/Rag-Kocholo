        "text": "Newsgathering is a fundamental activity in journalism. It starts from the identification of a factual element, which becomes worthy of recounting for a wider audience. A lot of information can be found in the electronic environment, through Internet searches. However, the journalist can call himself the person who publishes a piece of information for the first time while only extracting it from other media products. This study analyzes the ways of collecting information from the Romanian press on some of the representative electronic platforms, being particularly oriented towards the relationship between the public relations activity, on social media, and on the dangers that occur when professional standards are at a minimum level.\n\nIn order to highlight the current journalism foibles, some voices bring for other journalists of other time overstatements, in some cases even undeserved. While it may seem shocking to some, the press was never flawless. Despite this, the public tends to judge, perhaps too harshly, the value of nowadays journalistic publications, referring to the realities of other eras. Thus, post-communist journalist is considered inferior to the communist one, because the latter would not ever be allowed to publish the horrors that today we encounter in newspapers, on the internet or in broadcasts on radio or television. The result of man's press from the communist era is considered, however, much less valuable than the product which the journalist of interwar years offered to the public. Finally, for some editors or reporters of the years between the two World Wars, the absolute journalist model was Mihai Eminescu, who despite personal exceptional value, he was representative of a press still inferior in many respects to that of the interwar period. In this paper, our intention is to show some of the major shortcomings that have been alleged against the press throughout its existence. In our approach we will not limit, but only to texts targeting newspapers and journalists in Romania.\n\nThe main argument of this paper is that Romanian journalism did not manage to become the subject and main actor within professional self-observed boundaries, but has conserved an object-like position, not only under communism, but as well after. I argue that the objectified position of journalism in Romania has been a continuum, since the beginning of this type of activity. The three theoretical explanatory pillars that I built my argument on are: political culture, path-dependence, and the low institutionalization of rational-legal authority. The first explanatory element refers to the relation of the citizens to power and the state, and more specifically to the implication or withdrawal of regular individuals in the life of their polis. The second refers to the power of the past for explaining present time institutional structuration. On this matter the main process to be observed is how the legacy of journalism under politics has fed the servitude of this sphere of practice to the present day. The latter refers to the instance of incomplete modernization within the Romanian polity, where people in power or established customs are more important than rules and agreed-upon procedures. The above phenomena are visible when studying the field of journalism in its grassroots manifestations.\n\nIn the Romanian newsrooms women outstrip men. Women are not only more numerous but also much younger, being under 30. They have university degrees and, in comparison with men, are more often specialized in journalism. Thus, of the 341 interviewed journalists, 62.5 percent (213) were female and 37.5 percent (128) were male. 84.8 percent of the Romanian journalists were younger than 40, on average being 30.65 years old (s=9.79). A large number of journalists held a bachelorâ€™s (41.6%) or a master&#39;s degree (26.7%), while 10.0 percent had not completed their university studies. 18.8 percent of the total had attained secondary education, while 2.3 percent obtained a Ph.D. Over 80.0 percent of the Romanian journalists with university degrees had specialized in journalism and/or in other field of communication, as follows: 47.4 percent had specialized in journalism, 17.2 percent had studied other field of communication, and 15.7 percent had specialized in journalism and other field of c...\n\nThe article herein presents the results of a research study focused on the evolution of reportage in the Spanish press over a span of four decades. This is the first longitudinal study covering such an extensive period (1982-2018) with regard to this narrative journalistic genre, through publications in La Vanguardia and ABC, the two oldest national newspapers in Spain. The aim of the study is to discover how the genre has evolved in recent decades, in terms of authorship, length, section in which it is published, headlines, visual and complementary elements, and the degree of hybridisation with other journalistic genres. Based on a quantitative and qualitative methodology, a sample was analysed using the constructed week sampling technique (N=346 issues). The results obtained show an increase in the amount and general length of the reports published from the year 2000 onward, as well as a tendency toward hybridisation with genres such as the crÃ³nica and the news report. However, th...\n\nThe paper approaches the â€˜ideologyâ€™ of Romanian post-communist journalism as identified in local news media organisations. We focus on the practical philosophy of journalism, emphasizing elements such as autonomy, truth, objectivity; and the relationship of journalists and news organisations with political actors. Special attention is given to the interplay between this practical philosophy and the political and economic constraints influencing news media organisations in Romania. We approach this topic using in-depth interviews with journalists and editors from news media organisations in three Romanian cities. We argue that two different â€˜ideologiesâ€™ of journalism as a profession exist. These are complemented by a tendency toward reducing journalism to a simple occupation, linked to the politicization of media ownership in Romania and the widespread use of media organisations as vehicles for the free speech of their owners."
