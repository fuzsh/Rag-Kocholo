        "text": "An inspirational official interview with the 2023 Nobel Prize laureate in Physiology or Medicine, Katalin Kariko by nobelprize.org, recorded in Stockholm on 6 December 2023. Key discussion: ★ What brought you to science? ★ What do you enjoy most about science? ★ How have you maintained your focus despite all the obstacles you have faced? ★ What advice do you usually share with young scientists when they are facing obstacles? ★ Was there a specific mentor who influenced your career? ★ How was it to visit your home country Hungary after the Nobel Prize announcement? ★ What do you plan to do with your prize money? ★ What was your first impression of the US? ★ What does Hungary mean to you today? ★ Tell us about your co-laureate Drew Weissman and your collaboration. ★ What advice would you like to share with young scientists? ★ Is diversity important in science? ★ Do you see any similarities between sports and science? ★ When did you learn the importance of setting up goals? ★ Did you realize how important your research would be during the COVID-19 pandemic? ★ How does it feel to know that your research has saved millions of lives? #nobellaureate #scienceforhumanity #covid19vaccine #immunology Source: https://lnkd.in/etniYVzx\n\nThe modern enterprise of monetizing every part of intellectual inquiry in higher education does more to provide ideological critics of different disciplines the opportunity to valuate that inquiry on whatever arbitrary terms fit their narrative. It does far less to substantively measure that value. In this example, we see the stifling of epochal innovation in a \"hard\" science. The social sciences and humanities are even more susceptible to this kind of fatuous managerialism.\n\nMeet the brilliant minds behind PhagoFlux! Professor Jan-Hendrik Hofmeyr 🔬 Director & Co-Founder \"My research career has been devoted to understanding the control and regulation of metabolism, and the functional organisation of cellular processes that allows the cell to self-manufacture --- the key to life itself. Autophagy is one these crucial processes and I am most gratified that what I learned in my own research could be applied in the development of an experimental protocol for measuring autophagic flux. This method now underlies the exciting technology we have been developing at PhagoFlux.\"\n\nNational Science Day 2024 Today, India commemorates National Science Day to mark the discovery of the Raman Effect in 1928 by Sir C.V. Raman. His groundbreaking work on the 'scattering of light by molecules' earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930, making him the first Asian to achieve this feat in the field of Science. The Raman Effect continues to inspire scientific advancements globally, highlighting India's contribution to the world of physics and material science. This day serves as a reminder to foster scientific curiosity and innovation for a brighter future. #nationalscienceday2024 #RamanEffect\n\nWhat are the building blocks of life? How the complex behaviors are produced by the interplay of physical forces between the units of life? Find the answers by EMBO | EMBL Symposium: The mechanics of life: from development to disease This comprehensive symposium will study the interplay of the physical forces — the mechanics — between the fundamental building blocks of life, from molecules to organs. It will cover how these physical forces enable development and how they are altered in disease. We will cover the physical mechanisms of the major components of the animal cell and its environment, including cell membranes, the cytoskeleton, the nucleus, and the extracellular matrix. It will focus on the role of mechanical forces in both development and disease, engaging clinicians, cell and developmental biologists, and physical and material scientists, from in silico to in vitro and in vivo studies. We will include state-of-the-art technological applications that rely on the knowledge and use of mechanical forces for biotechnological and healthcare purposes. Keynote Speakers: 🇫🇷 Raphaël Voituriez, Sorbonne Université 🇺🇸 Valerie M. Weaver, University of California, San Francisco Scientific Organisers: 🇨🇭 Prisca Liberali 🇩🇪 Nicoletta Petridou 🇺🇸 Amy Shyer 🇦🇹 Anđela Šarić 🇪🇸 Xavier Trepat Welcome to know more via: https://lnkd.in/g9SJSNhC\n\nThank you to everyone who joined in Portugal for the 1st Be Seen workshop by The Natural Nipple! As promised, here is the 63 day evidence-based program to unwire neuro-biological blocks & prepare for new life. Longitudinal studies show by using daily self directed cognitive behavioral therapy method used in this program, positive changes were found on: 🦠 A cellular level (based on changes in telomeres, the caps on chromosomes) 🧠 In electrical activity in the brain (based on QEEG-measured changes in the brain) 😃 In psychosocial profiling (based on changes in psychological scales and narratives) 🩸 In blood tests (including changes cortisol and homocysteine levels). Your body is a source of ancient wisdom meets modern day data you can trust. Tap into it with the 1st cohort on Oct 31st for the Un-masquerade event 🎭 Or take the quiz to get your readiness for radical satisfaction score here: https://lnkd.in/d69HZdRN\n\nNational Science Day, #NSD2024 being celebrated today. The theme this year is \"𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐕𝐢𝐤𝐬𝐢𝐭 𝐁𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭\" On this day in 1928, Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman discovered a phenomenon of the scattering of photons, which was later known as the ‘Raman Effect’ after his name.(When light meets particles that are smaller than the light’s wavelength, the light spreads in different directions. This is because some of the incoming photons’ energy can be transferred to a molecule, giving it a higher level of energy). Among other things, the Raman Effect is used to analyze different types of material. After two years in 1930, he got the Nobel Prize for this remarkable discovery, and this was the first Nobel Prize for India in the field of science. To mark the discovery of his famous phenomenon, National Science Day is celebrated in India on this day each year.
