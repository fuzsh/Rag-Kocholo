        "text": "In 1911-12, the Romanian movie director Grigore Brezianu and the financial tycoon Leon Popescu made together the 2 hours long movie \"Romania's Independence\" - an as faithful as possible screen adaptation of the real Independence War that had been fought in 1877. Now, \"Restul e tacere\" tells us, in a loose and half-fictionalized way, the story of this movie making.\n\nFocused on the August 23rd 1944 coup against Marshal Antonescu, the movie also tackles other topics from the same era such as the Iron Guard rebellion and the execution of political leaders by communists.\n\nThe trials and tribulations of two high school students deeply in love with each other, but facing the challenge of their completely different social backgrounds, during the twilight of the communist Romania.\n\nDuring the cholera pandemic in 1873, a wealthy man in a village sends his son an his son's servant, to find people in the mountain area, in order to help finish collecting his wheat crop. His son although has another agenda in finding a girl who worked on his father's land a year ago and with whom he fell in love with. When found, both men, the son and his servant, fell in love with the girl.\n\nThe film is a masterpiece of directing and acting in the same time.In starring brilliant play Serban Ionescu, Amza Pellea,Gheorghe Cozorici and Tora Vasilescu in a realistic vision of the story-communist emblem of culture: young work site which gives answers to the great questions of existence. Calin Surupaceanu is a simple boy, convinced by engineer Dan to accompany him in building a new city. Along the way, he meets his future wife and subsequently source of unrest and rebellion against fate. The movie is based on a novel by Marin Preda called \"The Intruder\".Scenario, especially frames and inner monologue are very good thought. Review is written and thought by George Ciocirlan.\n\nA prosecutor, policemen and teacher bring the students Vuica and Nicu to a restaurant to re-enact their drunken brawl there, and have it filmed to show the effects of alcoholism."
