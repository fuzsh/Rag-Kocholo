        "text": "This article presents the main theories of “biographical genres” in Romania. It contends that especially the works of Eugen Simion, Mihai Zamfir and Mircea Mihăieș of the 1980s can be reused for a better understanding of biographical writing in the context of emerging life writing studies and memory studies. The authors emphasize the fact that theories of the biographical genres did not consider important the study of diaries, correspondences and memoirs until the late 1980s, and that there has been an increased interest on the subject in the 1990s due to the transition to the post-communist society. Thus, the study argues that certain categories of “biographical genres,” and especially the “diary of existence” and “diary of crisis,” put forward by Zamfir, could be used for a better understanding of biographical writing in a world of fragmentation, migration and post-colonial struggle.\n\nI would like to refer mainly to the autobiographic writings of two Romanian intellectuals who chose to emigrate during the communist regime of the 70's. Matei Călinescu, a well-known writer and literary critique, gave up his career in Romania and settled in America where he further joined the academic life as a professor of comparative literature. Ion Vianu, also a well-known psychiatrist in Romania, gave up his privileged life as cultural elite and emigrated in Switzerland where he continued to practice medicine with much success. Both were aware that when leaving their native country they will have fewer chances to regain their central position among the cultural elites of the exile. Yet, they took the decision to \" die \" professionally. The inevitable compromise explains their decision to emigrate and renounce to a comfortable and successful position in society. The paper analyses the ways in which the Romanian intellectual tries to recover the ethical dimension of his professional activity before accepting the failure of this exercise and the extreme solution: the exile.\n\nThe fall of Communism gave way to a frantic search for the “truth” wherein competing narratives aimed at expunging collective memory and reconstruct national identity. In post-socialist Romania memory, history and justice have become embedded in an ongoing struggle for political power between the surviving forces of the old regime and those who believe in a complete break with the pre-1989 nationalist-communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. Twenty five years after the Revolution, Romania’s cultural milieu has not yet escaped the boundaries of the aforementioned paradigm. This paper will not dwell on the critical anthologies cited above. Instead, it will focus on the debates surrounding the critical role of the writer-intellectual and the production of literarure inside an authoritarian regime. The main questions this paper seeks to answer is how should we approach literature produced during the Communist period? Were literary productions entirely the product of ideology? How did the literary canon evolve and how was it influenced by the historical and political context of the time? In an effort to break away from the socialist regime should all literary creations produced during he Communist era be discarded? In retrospect how should one asses the role of the writer/intellectual?\n\nThis paper aims to assess the challenging role of post-communist critical and theoretical revisions for the literary canon legitimized under communism. Special attention will be given, therefore, to the so-called \"East-ethical revisionism\", theoretical direction which, beyond the interpretative excesses involved, brings a necessary resizing of the relation between aesthetics (the autonomy of art) and ethics (the political compromise literature assumes). Although these revisions generated the most acid cultural polemics of the '90s, practical results delay so much that the analysis of their inertia becomes a substantial issue of the current Romanian canonical debate. A good way of access to these interpretative jams remains Monica Lovinescu's critical activity, because Eugen Lovinescu's daughter acquires the role of coordinator of the \"East-ethical revisionism\".\n\nCensorship as a literary subject has sometimes been necessary in times of change, as it may show how power imbalances influence, often very dramatically, the production of and the access to knowledge. The woman in the photo: a diary, 1987-1989 by Tia Șerbănescu and A censor’s notebook by Liliana Corobca are two books that deal with the issue of censorship in the 1980s (the former) and the 1970s (the latter). Both writers tackle the problem from inside the ruling system, aiming at authenticity in different ways. On the one hand, instead of writing a novel, Tia Șerbănescu kept a diary in which she contemplated the oppression and the corruption of the time and their consequences on the freedom of thought, of expression and of speech. She thoroughly described what she felt and thought about her family, friends and other people she met, about books and their authors, in a time when keeping a diary was hard and often perilous. On the other hand, using the technique of the mise en abyme, Liliana Corobca begins from a fictitious exchange of emails to eventually enter and explore the mind of a censor and reveal what she thought and felt about the system, her co-workers, her boss, the books she proofread and edited, their authors and the boundaries of her own identity. Detailed examinations and performances of the relationship between writing and censorship, the two books provide engaging, often tragi-comical, insights into the psychological process of producing literary texts. The intention of this article is to compare and contrast the two author’s perspectives on the act of writing and some of its functions from four points of view: literary, cultural, social and political.\n\nBecause there was no samizdat literature in Romania, historians, men of letters, the public in general were eagerly awaiting the ’90s desk drawer writings of the communist period. The first surprise was that the number was smaller than imagined and then came the revelation that the much-awaited great literature did not bring too much, either as a mirror of the time, or aesthetically. The posthumous novels of Ion D. Sîrbu (1919–1989)—an undeniable victim of the regime—are representative of the censored literature, and their lack of success is a social-literary phenomenon that, once investigated, may explain the singular manner of resistance through culture."
