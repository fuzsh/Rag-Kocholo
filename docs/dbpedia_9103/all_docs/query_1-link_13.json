        "text": "Fighting in Libya between forces loyal to dictator Moammar Gadhafi and rebel forces has grown even more intense in recent days and has been centered in the coastal city of Misrata. Five people, including two celebrated photojournalists, have been confirmed dead, and many more are injured.\n\nSeveral European countries, including France and Britain, announced plans to send weapons and supplies to the rebel fighters to help their cause, while the U.S. said it would send \"non-lethal\" items such as food, clothing and even ambulances.\n\nPro-Gadhafi forces continue to deny their use of extremely lethal weapons, such as cluster bombs, against civilians. But, numerous journalists have filmed and confirmed their existence and use.\n\nA man who says he represents the rebel forces insists his troops are well armed and will not stop short of removing Gadhafi from power. However, Gadhafi and his ruthless, well-supplied forces have also shown no signs of giving up.\n\nQuotes\n\n\"We have enough guns. We have cells in every area of the capital. We are in contact with rebels in the east, in Misrata and Zawiyah. When we attack checkpoints, we kill soldiers and take their weapons. Our aim is to kill Gadhafi. We will get rid of him.\" - Libyan rebel fighter\n\nWarm Up Questions\n\n1. Where is Libya? What has taken place there over the past several weeks?\n\n2. What is a dictator?\n\n3. What is regime change? Why is it often violent?\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\n1. Why does the reporter say he has no way to confirm that the supposed rebel fighter he interviews is who he says he is? What other challenges do you think journalists face while working in war zones?\n\n2. Several Western countries have announced they will provide weapons and other supplies to the rebels, and the U.S. has pledged it will send \"non-lethal\" supplies. What are some of the risks involved in taking sides in such a conflict and arming resistance fighters? Can you think of examples of when this has happened in history?\n\n3. What is a war crime? How are those accused of committing war crimes prosecuted?\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nU.S., Allies Enforce 'No-Fly Zone' in Libya\n\nArab Democracy Movement Turns Violent in Libya"
