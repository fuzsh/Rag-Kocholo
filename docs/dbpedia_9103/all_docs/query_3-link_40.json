        "text": "A Jewish (يهود, יהוד) area on the outskirts of Misrata (مصراتة, מצראתה), Libya (ليبيا, לוב). According to informants, the first Jews to move to Misrata from Yedder did not settle in the city itself but in a Jewish quarter they established on the outskirts. Only later did Jewish settlers move into the city and especially into the Muqawaba neighborhood. This may be that first area of settlement.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Jews of Misrata\n\nHistorically Misrata was a central market town, although to local farmers, the term “Misrata” tends to refer to the hinterlands around the market and the town itself was simply called suk (market).1 In addition to local trade among the areas south and east of the suk, Misrata was also a caravan trade hub.2 There has been evidence of Jewish settlement in Misrata in 1589 and in the early 18th century.3\n\nThe two Jewish areas of Misrata were Yidr (Yidder, 2-4km northeast of the suk) and Maṭin (the Jewish quarter directly west of the central market).4 Yidr was the older settlement.5 It had a large market that was open on Tuesdays and Thursdays; two market days per week suggested that it was very popular.6\n\nAccording to informants, the first Jews to move to central Misrata from Yidr did not immediately settle in the city itself but in a Jewish quarter they established on the outskirts. Tombstones with Hebrew inscriptions dating from 1142 have been found near Misrata, and the existence of a Jewish community strongly suggests non-agricultural activity of some kind.7 Only later did Jewish settlers move into the city and especially into the Muqawaba neighborhood."
