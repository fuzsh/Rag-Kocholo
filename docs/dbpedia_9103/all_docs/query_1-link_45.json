        "text": "I have a pair of Muammar Gaddafi's sunglasses. Cartier. My brigade was one of the first to break into his compound at Bab al-Aziziya. I was driving a vehicle with a 106mm gun on it. I'm the fifth man to drive this car: the last four died in battle.\n\nThe day we broke into the compound was a day of intense fighting, so loud you couldn't hear each other's names. When it was finished we looked around: the houses of his children, his own house, they had everything â€“ BMWs, Mercedes and guns everywhere. Upstairs they had boxes and boxes of sunglasses, maybe 100 pairs, still in their shop wrappers.\n\nThey are all altered to correct Gaddafi's vision. So I took a few pairs as presents. The other things I took were shampoo and a toothbrush, because I needed them, and I took some of his underpants and some of his wife's. All their underwear is black. I took them outside and wrapped them on that statue of the clenched fist. It felt good.\n\nI have been fighting since the first day of the war. Then I was fighting outside, at Dafniya, and then in the attack on Zlitan two weeks ago. But Bab al-Aziziya was different. Because capturing Gaddafi's home was what we came to do. When we captured his house we felt that Gaddafi was finished.\n\nThen we went back to a school building where we were staying and we all cried. There must have been 200 guys and I think everyone was crying because in this war we have all lost someone, a brother, a friend or a cousin. I lost my best friend, Alla Ekshem, a week ago. He was 31, he got married the week before Ramadan. We went into the town by different routes and we were talking to each other by radio. He told me, \"Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar, the two of us will go to Tripoli, we'll see our friends.\" It was the last words I heard from him; he was killed under Zlitan bridge that afternoon.\n\nBefore the war I saw Gaddafi a few times and his sons. I run a construction business and every year Gaddafi would have this celebration on 1 September, always in a different part of the country. I would build the stage. It was very elaborate. They would make a new road for him, and plant palm trees, and he would stay there in his tent, never going out. So a few times he would pass me and say: \"As-Salamu Alaykum [peace be with you].\" I never spoke back. Everyone who was in his presence was afraid, me too, because you knew that he could just look at you and you would be in big trouble.\n\nThe war isn't over, there is Sirte to capture and Beni Walid and maybe Sabha too; it could go on for another month, but in the end all cities will be free. Everyone changed in this war in Misrata, for the better. People you know, sometimes they would say hi to you, sometimes they wouldn't. Now they always say hello. What I hope for now is the same thing I hoped for on the first day of war in Misrata. Just for my mother and all the children to sleep normally. I want Libya to be like the Emirates, like London, like Paris. Not the buildings, I don't look for the buildings, but the people. How the people are thinking.\n\nI think first year will be very difficult for Libyans. Maybe not for the people in Misrata or Tripoli, we are used to business. But in Benghazi it will be difficult because people in Benghazi they don't like to work, they think when Gaddafi is finished with all the oil everyone will be a millionaire.\n\nAs to our future government, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, our president, is very kind, really when you hear him speak you feel he is speaking from his heart. But he is old and he doesn't know how the world is. We need someone who has lived abroad. We are a country with six million people and a lot of oil and you need a strongman. The prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril, is better: he is smart.\n\nAfter the war what I really want to do is repair my mother's house and paint it. Under Gaddafi we had to paint it white. If you wanted to make it another colour you have to take a signature from the government, and blah, blah, blah. I'd like to paint it sand-coloured. Beige.\n\nMuhsen al-Gubbi, 30, has fought with Misrata's rebels since the war began\n\nThis article was corrected on 28 August 2011. It originally stated that three men had driven the car with a 106mm gun on it but it was in fact four and that Gubbi's friend died two weeks ago. The picture had also incorrectly been credited to The Observer."
