        "text": "What is a city?\n\nA city is commonly defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries. Cities generally have extensive systems for infrastructure such as electric grid, sanitation, transportation and other utilites. They also provide a higher economic activity then their rural counterparts, that results a wider array of products and services.\n\nIs there a set standard for defining Cities?\n\nNo, there is no firm rule that makes a population of an area a city. However, The World Bank categorize the degree of urbanization identified by three types of settlements, whereof one is cities, which must have a population of at least 50,000 inhabitants in contiguous dense grid cells (>1,500 inhabitants per km2).\n\nHow are Cities formed?\n\nIn short, cities are formed by people that colocate in the same area through socio-economic decissions. According to the Britannica, the first cities appeared during the Neolithic Period when the development of agricultural techniques assured surplus crop yields large enough to sustain a permanent population. These cities emerged in sites of early civilization, such as the Nile valley, the Indus valley, and the Wei River valley.\n\nWhat is the difference between a city, town and village?\n\nA city is a large human settlement, typically with a population of over 50,000-100,000+ people. While a town is typically considered to be a smaller human settlement, with a population of fewer than 25,000 people. A village on the other hand is a small human settlement, where the population is less than 5,000 people. However, this depends on what country you are in, and how they define it.\n\nCan countries form new Cities?\n\nYes, countries can form new or devide cities as they see fit. However, cities are mainly formed by the interests of people, not through governance."
