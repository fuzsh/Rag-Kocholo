        "text": "Libya is engulfed in new political turmoil, with an Islamist militia openly challenging the legitimacy of the country's elected parliament, after its fighters took control of Tripoli's battered international airport.\n\nAfter seizing the airport in the Libyan capital, the militia from the coastal city of Misrata called Sunday for the old General National Congress to be reinstated.\n\nIt alleged the parliament elected in June was complicit in mysterious airstrikes on Misrati positions at the airport as its militiamen fought rival fighters from the mountainous region of Zintan for six weeks for control of the key facility.\n\nThe new parliament, based in Tobruk, 1,600 kilometers east of Tripoli, branded the Misratis as terrorists, along with another group, Ansar al-Sharia, which controls 80 percent of the eastern city of Benghazi\n\nParliament called the two groups \"a legitimate target\" of the national army, which has been unable to control violence in the country since the 2011 overthrow of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nThe Misratis directly blamed the airstrikes in the past week on Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nCairo denied its involvement, but the UAE had no immediate comment.\n\nGeneral National Congress\n\nGeneral National Congress official Omar Hmaidan defended the Islamist militias and called on the old assembly to resume its meetings to, in his words, \"unite the country.”\n\nHmaidan said the new parliament should not meet in an “ivory tower” in the east of the country, but should return to the capital Tripoli. He argued the National Congress is still legal and the new parliament cannot claim to speak for the country.\n\nHmaidan claimed recently the new parliament has “violated the constitution” with a recent call for foreign intervention in Libya.\n\nThe National Congress' mandate expired last February and many of its members are outside the country.\n\nAirstrikes on Sunday\n\nMeanwhile, unidentified war planes attacked targets in Libya's capital Tripoli on Sunday, residents said, hours after forces from the city of Misrata said they had seized the main airport.\n\nTripoli residents heard jets followed by explosions at dawn, but no more details were immediately available.\n\nIn recent weeks Libya has seen the worst fighting since the NATO-backed campaign to oust Gadhafi. Renegade general Khalifa Haftar has declared war on Islamist-leaning forces, part of growing anarchy in the oil producer.\n\nHis forces claimed responsibility for air raids on Tripoli on Saturday and last Monday, targeting a group called Operation Dawn. But this group, consisting mainly of fighters from Misrata, said on Saturday that it had captured Tripoli's main airport from a rival faction from Zintan in western Libya.\n\nIn the campaign to overthrow Gadhafi, fighters from Zintan and Misrata were comrades-in-arms. But they later fell out and this year have turned parts of Tripoli into a battlefield.\n\nChaos in Libya\n\nLibya's neighbors and Western powers worry Libya will turn into a failed state as the weak government is unable to control armed factions.\n\nHaftar launched a campaign against Islamists in the eastern city of Benghazi in May and threw his weight behind the Zintan fighters.\n\nFighting also erupted between Haftar's troops and allied army special forces with Islamists in two Benghazi suburbs on Saturday, killing eight soldiers and wounding 35, medics said.\n\nThe violence has prompted the United Nations and foreign embassies in Libya to evacuate their staff and citizens, and foreign airlines have largely stopped flying to Libya.\n\nLibya's central government lacks a functioning national army and relies on militia for public security.\n\nBut while these forces receive state salaries and wear uniforms, they report in practice to their own commanders and towns."
