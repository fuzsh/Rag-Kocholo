        "text": "South African authorities are set to deport 95 Libyans who were detained at a suspected training camp in Mpumalanga province, according to the French news agency.\n\nThe deportation, scheduled for Sunday, will be executed utilizing an aircraft provided by the parallel government led by Osama Hammad.\n\nA South African court in White River recently dismissed charges against the Libyans, who had been accused of violating immigration laws. The case was referred to the Ministry of Home Affairs for administrative handling.\n\nThe Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Libya, Liu Jian, has invited Libya's Minister of Economy and Trade, Mohamed Al-Huwaij, to visit Beijing and lead a delegation at the upcoming China-Africa Cooperation Forum.\n\nDuring their meeting, the two officials discussed the current trade and investment ties between China and Libya and explored ways to boost economic collaboration.\n\nAl-Ahli Tripoli received confirmation from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) on Saturday regarding the home and away fixtures for the first preliminary round of the CAF Confederation Cup against Zanzibar’s Ohamiaji Club.\n\nCAF has approved holding both legs at the Tripoli International Stadium. The first leg is set for August 18 at 7:00 PM local time, and the second leg will follow on August 23 at the same time.\n\nThe Tripoli Security Directorate has arrested two individuals on charges of illicitly utilizing a bank card belonging to a deceased woman to withdraw funds from her account.\n\nFollowing the submission of a complaint by a citizen reporting the unauthorized withdrawal of 13,750 dinars from his deceased sister's bank account, the police initiated an investigation.\n\nInquiries unveiled that the withdrawn funds were utilized via a bank card at exchange shops in the Zahra area.\n\nThe Ministry of Education in the Government of National Unity announced the approval of the results of the secondary school certificate exams with a general success rate of 48.43%.\n\n23,503 students took the secondary school certificate exams in the literary section, of whom 7,783 students passed, while 15,720 students failed, with a rate of 33.11%.\n\nIn the scientific certificate, 91,230 students took the exams, 47,898 students passed, and 43,323 students had a second round, with a success rate of 52.05%.\n\nThe National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) announced that it had taken urgent measures for international health control offices at all land, sea and air ports, raising the state of alert and readiness amid the outbreak of monkey pox (Mpox).\n\nThe African Center for Disease Control announced a state of health emergency in the entire African continent after the increase in Mpox cases in 16 countries so far, as the disease entered some countries for the first time.\n\nThe failure of the High Council of State’s (HCS) elections has deepened divisions among its members. The emerging dispute over the validity of a ballot could have been resolved early, as it did not violate procedural rules. However, the intense competition, driven by existing divisions and the intransigence of Al-Mishri and his supporting bloc, has pushed the Council to the brink of splitting into two factions, each claiming legitimacy and deeming the other invalid unless the dispute is resolved in only one of two ways as announced by the head of the HCS which is: awaiting the judiciary’s final decision or proceeding to a third round of voting."
