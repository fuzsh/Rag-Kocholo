        "text": "Prime Minister of the Libyan National Unity Government Abdulhamid Dibeybe inaugurated the city park built by Açılım İnşaat in Misrata city.\n\nIn his speech at the ceremony, Dibeybe stated that until two years ago, the news about Libya was about war, but today we are living in an environment of building, construction and happiness.\n\nStating that governments exist to serve the citizens and make the people happy, Dibeybe added, “ Governments come into office to use the country's resources for you. Inshallah, we will open a new park, a new theatre, a new road, a new school, a new institute and a new university every day. We will realise this in all cities in the east, west and south of this homeland for which you sacrificed lives. Misrata has been waiting for such a park for a long time. I wish you all the best. We are moving towards a better Libya future.”\n\nMahmoud al-Sukutri, the mayor of Misrata, said that the area where the city park is located used to be a place where people threw garbage and criminals gathered late at night, but now it has turned into a beautiful sightseeing park.\n\nStating that the park was built by Açılım İnşaat and will serve the people of Misrata free of charge, Sukutri added, “ There was no such an area in our city where people could get fresh air. A beautiful park was built with cafes and restaurants. I hope that this will be the return of Turkish companies to Libya.”\n\nIn 14 months, more than a hundred Turkish personnel worked\n\nEmrah Kekilli, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors and General Manager of Açılım İnşaat, which built the park, stated that they built a \"world-class\" park on an area of 12 hectares, including children's playgrounds and sports areas, recreation areas, cafes, restaurants, sales units, car parks, walking tracks and pools.\n\n\"Over a hundred Turkish personnel worked for 14 months on the construction of this park. We have completed this project without a single staff member being injured.”. Kekilli noted that the Libyan people and the state showed a very constructive and helpful attitude during the construction process of the park.\n\nStating that as the companies of the Republic of Turkey, which stands by the Libyan people and the state in all difficult times, they have done a serious job for the welfare of the Libyan people in an environment where no foreign companies are working, Kekilli added, “ By realising such projects, we believe that we are serving Turkey's attitude, which has always been a constructive actor in war and peace, and we are proud.”\n\nOur projects continue in different cities of Libya and we consider the Misrata Park project as a start."
