        "text": "The North African nation of Libya is one of the few high-income countries on the African continent. Being the 16th largest in the world in terms of land area with a relatively small population, Libya presents enormous prospects for economic and infrastructural growth. However, progress has been arrested due to continuous factional violence and civil wars that have negatively impacted the economy as well.\n\nA significant portion of the world’s oil reserves is found in Libya, followed by other resources such as natural gas and gypsum. The country is one of the biggest exporters of sweet crude oil in the world, which account for more than 97% of its exports. Apart from petroleum, gold and scrap metal is also exported to European Union, Germany, the US, China, Spain, UAE etc.\n\nIt imports most of its food from other countries due to environmental factors coupled with the political turmoil. Wheat, cereals, barley etc are largely imported. Apart from food, capital equipment and consumer goods are other major import items brought from China, Italy, Turkey, Tunisia and Germany.\n\nLibya is bordered by the Mediterranean sea in the north hence the country carries out its international maritime trade and commerce through its numerous ports and oil terminals. However, most commercial ports are in dilapidated condition, lacking proper equipment and modernisation. Protests and blockades, even bomb attacks have halted port operations in the past and significantly impacted the nation’s annual oil production and maritime trade.\n\nThe political situation has restricted foreign investments in the nation whose population suffers from a lack of education and unemployment while being dependent on immigrant labour for skilled jobs. Business, service and manufacturing sectors have been impacted and infrastructural development has been restrained due to the war-like situation in the country.\n\nAlthough the nation earns mainly through its oil revenues, there is a need to diversify the economy and the ports and shipping sector can play a key role in this endeavour. Let us have a look at some of the major ports and oil terminals in Libya.\n\nPort of Tripoli\n\nLying on the northwestern Mediterranean coast of Libya, Tripoli is the premier port of the country. The city of Tripoli is the country’s capital and is also highly populated. It is Libya’s commercial and manufacturing hub that houses many small industries whose manufactures such as carpets, cigarettes, fish, livestock, chemicals etc are distributed in the region through this port. Heavy industries like gas-bottling units, vehicle assemblage, and oil depots are located close to the port. It lies in the oasis region hence few crops like olives, and some fruits are cultivated nearby. The port’s history goes back to ancient times and it was established by Phoenicians in the 7th century and used by Greeks as an important trading post.\n\nPresently operated and managed by the Ports Authority of Libya, it handles general cargo, bulk and passengers. In 2017, the port was visited by 550 ships and handled 40,000 TEU and 740,000 tonnes of bulk cargo.\n\nThe port harbour spans more than 550 hectares and can handle vessels with a total length of more than 180 m and a draft of 10 m. The port can handle about 4 million tonnes of cargo annually. Tripoli port comprises a general cargo berth covering 40 m and 30 berths for handling containerised cargo with a total length of more than 3000 m.\n\nThe port also has 6 berths with storage tanks and sufficient operational equipment such as 3 shore cranes, 11 reach stackers, 14 trailers, 20 forklifts etc.\n\nIt also has an enormous storage capacity while offering cold storage facility and 250 reefer points. The port comprises two covered yards spanning 3500 m2 and 9,000 m2 for storing general cargo and 3-grain silos. Another storage yard and warehouse are available for lease to private companies.\n\nPort of Benghazi\n\nBenghazi port is one of the largest Libyan facilities situated on the coast of the Gulf of Sidra, near the Mediterranean Sea in the region of Cyrenaica. The city of Benghazi is the second biggest city in the country and an important centre of administration and commerce. The Benghazi port is a commercial facility housing industrial units like oil refineries, food, salt processing, cement making, breweries, tanneries and fishing. It also houses one of the world’s biggest water desalinization plants, which provides fresh water to most of Libya’s cities. The port is well connected to major cities by roadways.\n\nThe Port company of Libya is responsible for port management and operations. Benghazi port suffered due to political reasons and was blocked after 2013, resuming port operations in 2018. The port’s infrastructure deteriorated during this period however it is still operational.\n\nSpanning more than 450,000 sq m, Benghazi port deals with conventional cargo, bulk and containers. Major exports include oil, wool, livestock, rugs while major imports include food, textiles, chemicals, and pottery. Apart from commercial maritime traffic, Benghazi port also handles humanitarian cargoes such as medicines etc destined for other war-torn African nations like Darfur and Chad. In 2018, about 350 ships visited this port and it handled 16000 TEU and 199,000 million tonnes of cargo.\n\nThe port is divided into the old port and the Juliana port. The former comprises 9 berths however it is no longer operational due to dilapidated infrastructure. The latter also has 9 berths for receiving containerised cargo and bulk. The port also has a separate oil facility for receiving tankers with an LOA of not more than 200m.\n\nThe main storage area spans 16000 m2 and comprises 2 warehouses, open yards and sheltered space for storing cargo like grain and cement. Large tanks for storing oil can be found in the other area.\n\nMarsa-El Brega port/ Al-braiga\n\nThis port facility is situated on the Gulf of Sidra at the southern end of the Mediterranean sea close to Bengazi port. It is a major oil handling facility in\n\nLibya and a huge oil refinery owned by Sirte oil enterprise is situated near the port. The Sirte Company has controlled the port facilities since the late 1990s.\n\nDuring the world war period, this was just a tiny fishing village however after the war ended, it developed as Libya’s first oil pipeline was laid here. The port facility was built in the mid-90s and comprised a pier and floating wharves for oil carriers and tankers. It became operational in 1961 after which a natural gas manufacturing unit and an ammonia processing unit were established. Presently, it is known as the country’s major petrochemical port, connected with Tripoli and neighbouring regions, Cairo, Egypt etc.\n\nThe port handles exports of oil, petrochemical goods and also general cargo.
