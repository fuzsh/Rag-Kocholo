He was accompanied by the directors of departments in the Authority and several businessmen, to learn about the progress of work there and the services it needs to encourage local and foreign investment in it.\n\nAl-Masry is working to activate the role of the Authority by taking the necessary measures to support industrial activity and solve the bottlenecks that stand in the way of the activation of industrial zones in all of Libya, the Media Office explained. He also aims to put in place measures to protect local industry, stressing the importance of the private sector’s contribution to implementing the Authority’s targeted investment map supporting the activation of industrial zones.\n\nChina’s Goodwill establishing a ceramics factory\n\nThe Media Office referred to a visit by its Director General to the project of the Chinese company Goodwill, which is building a factory for the manufacture of ceramics and porcelain with an area of 26 hectares within the Al-Karareem industrial zone with a production capacity of 80 thousand square metres.
