        "text": "Fighting has intensified in the Libyan port of Misrata as government forces attempted to retake the rebel-held city after a two-month siege.\n\nA rebel spokesman said Col Gaddafi was trying to create a humanitarian crisis in the only rebel-held western city.\n\nRebels who have been attempting to end Muammar Gaddafi's four-decade rule say Nato forces should be doing more to protect its 300,000 residents.\n\nIn the east, fighting has continued on the coastal road to Benghazi.\n\nFierce battles on the road between Ajdabiya and the strategic oil town of Brega - which has changed hands half a dozen times since February - killed a number of rebels and wounded many more, reports said.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-aircraft fire was heard in Tripoli, suggesting the Libyan capital was coming under attack from the air, although there were no immediate reports of damage.\n\nRebels said dozens of Soviet-designed Grad rockets had been fired at an industrial district of Misrata by government forces, although this has not been confirmed.\n\nThe Grad, which launches multiple rockets from mobile launchers, has been blamed for a number of civilian deaths in recent days, including eight people in a bread queue.\n\nFive civilians were killed as a dairy factory sustained half an hour of heavy shelling, a doctor said.\n\nOn Friday, US-based Human Rights Watch accused the Gaddafi regime of using cluster bombs - which scatter multiple bomblets, causing indiscriminate casualties, and have been banned by most countries - although the Libyan government vehemently denies the charge.\n\n\"There's no more room for hesitation or for not standing with determination against what is happening in Misrata and other Libyan cities, because the destruction that Muammar Gaddafi is causing in Libyan cities is great and extensive,\" said Abdel Hafidh Ghoga, a spokesman for the rebel's Transitional National Council in Benghazi.\n\nHe said several hundred injured civilians from Misrata had already been taken to Turkey for treatment.\n\nThe Gulf state of Qatar is said to be providing medical assistance, and about 1,000 other victims evacuated by sea have been taken to Benghazi.\n\nLibya's government says it is committed to helping the people of Misrata, after having facilitated a visit to the town by the International Committee of the Red Cross."
