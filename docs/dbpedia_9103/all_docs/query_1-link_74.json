        "text": "As Canadians, we're well-versed in the art of navigating wild weather fluctuations. Today is yet another prime example - from the gripping cold out west to the milder embrace of Quebec... and gearing up for an impressive gust of wind and snow tonight. Our resilience in the face of these rapid changes reflects not just on our personal mettle, but our business acumen too. We plan, we adapt, and most importantly, we carry on with a smile and determination, ready to conquer whatever mother nature throws at us next! #CanadianWeather #Resilience #businessadaptability\n\nIn light of the devastating events in Morocco, we turn our focus to the enduring hope found in the expertise of skilled Moroccans like Ayoub Belouch. Ayoub advocates for a safer, more resilient future. “In the face of this disaster, we're reminded that challenges remain; the difficulties we've faced offer us an opportunity to build back better and safer communities. To tackle these challenges head-on, we're rigorously examining every failure mode we encounter, peeling back the layers to understand root causes. This deep dive redefines our strategies and pinpoints the most effective interventions. What comes next? We're evaluating affected regions and refining our understanding of the issues at hand. By quantifying the extent of the damage and taking into account both human and cultural factors, we can extract wisdom, establish best practices rooted in time-tested, ancient earthquake-resilient techniques, and train master masons who will, in turn, instruct others in reconstruction efforts.” - Ayoub Belouch Despite facing ongoing challenges, he remains hopeful for the future, believing that local expertise can help reshape strategies and establish new best practices.\n\n🚨 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗵𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀🚨 Hualien has endured absolute torment, but amidst the rubble, resilience has stood tall. As we navigate the aftermath, let's not forget the importance of being equipped with the right knowledge. We urge you to explore the invaluable wisdom of the Drop, Cover, Hold on (D.C.H.) protocol in Anika's latest blog post. This protocol embodies a mindset shift—a commitment to proactive preparedness in the face of uncertainty. 🤝 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗗.𝗖.𝗛.

We were particularly excited to listen to Dr. Narumi Takahashi, from the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience of Japan, explaining the cutting-edge development and use of #earlywarning systems for #earthquakes and #tsunamis in Japan. Japan is one of the most well-prepared countries of the world when it comes to disasters, especially with regards to earthquake and tsunami #hazards. We are looking forward to our increased scientific #collaboration and exchange of #bestpractices with Japanese experts from both the academic and administrative domains!

Mayor Fatma Şahin invited Horasis to stage this major economic summit. Gaziantep and the southern region of #Türkiye were hit by a massive earthquake earlier this year. Members of the #Horasis community are invited to propose solutions to reconstruct the city. ❓ What is the critical listing of needs from buildings to purposeful changes in societal practices? ❓Can the changes be done rapidly, or must we reflect deeply on purposefulness and the people’s needs?"
