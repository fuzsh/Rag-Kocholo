        "text": "DAVID GREENE, Host:\n\nNow let's turn to our correspondent in Libya, who has been expecting the damage inflicted by war in the western city of Misrata. There were bloody battles in that city, as forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi fought to dislodge local rebels. Some streets remains scenes of devastation. But as NPR's Corey Flintoff reports, the people of Misrata are emerging from the ashes.\n\nCOREY FLINTOFF: Atia Salhouriati, a tall, bearded young fighter, stands in the middle of Tripoli Street, Misrata's main boulevard, and points to a row of shattered buildings.\n\nATIA SALHOURIATI: (Foreign language spoken)\n\nFLINTOFF: This, he says, is where the fighting began. The battle for Misrata surged back and forth for months, from the outbreak of the revolution in mid-February until rebels finally claimed full control of the city in mid-May. Even then, the rebels had to fight through much of the summer to hold what they had gained, as pro-Gadhafi forces kept up a bombardment from the outskirts of the city.\n\nSALHOURIATI: (Foreign language spoken)\n\nFLINTOFF: Everywhere I look, I see buildings that have been blasted and burned by the fighting. Huge holes torn in the concrete sides of buildings, windows blasted out, walls pockmarked with heavy machine gun fire.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Unintelligible)\n\nMAN: (Unintelligible)\n\nFLINTOFF: Across the street, some local men have set up an outdoor museum of the munitions that were used against them.\n\nABDULLAH SHINEBEH: (Foreign language spoken)\n\nFLINTOFF: Abdullah Shinebeh leads the way through a collection of deadly hardware set out in rows according to type, ranging from rocket-propelled grenades to artillery rounds. Like a museum curator, he nudges parts of the display into order as he walks along. Volunteers keep adding new pieces to a wooden box piled with empty machine gun cartridges. Shinebeh shoos away some boys who have climbed a low fence around the display.\n\nSHINEBEH: (Through translator) Such materials, they are still loaded, not exploded yet, so it's risky.\n\nFLINTOFF: Shinebeh says most of the armaments were found in the neighboring buildings. The fighting hit Tripoli Street like a tornado with the same inexplicable pattern that leaves some shops almost intact while the ones on either side are blasted. After dusk, the intact shops show up as rectangles of light in the dark facades - a shoe store, an Internet cafe, even restaurants.\n\nMOHAMMAD AL: In such night, you will find a lot of people who are standing in line waiting for their meals. You will find shops are opening. It is something incredible.\n\nFLINTOFF: Twenty-eight-year-old Mohammad Al-Karami stands outside a chicken takeout shop with a crowd of young men. He's a dentist but he says he's been a fighter since the start of the revolution. Karami says Tripoli Street was hell on Earth but that people started cleaning it as soon as the fighting was over. The cleanest place on this block may be Haitham Ehwaidat's stationary store stacked with supplies for the schools that are reopening this week. He says he wanted to open as quickly as he could to honor the fighters who won his city's freedom.\n\nHAITHAM EHWAIDAT: (Foreign language spoken)\n\nFLINTOFF: Ehwaidat says the storefront was hit by shrapnel and he holds up a new briefcase with a neat hole near the top.\n\nEHWAIDAT: (Foreign language spoken)\n\nFLINTOFF: He shows the chunk of mortar shell that punched the hole, then lodged in his wall. He says he plans to keep the briefcase on display as a sign of what the people here suffered.\n\nMOHAMMED AL: I think Misrata give the whole world an example of what made the courage and the determination never to give up. So I believe Misrata is a very special case.\n\nFLINTOFF: Mohammed Al-Karami says he hopes the heart of his city will return to Tripoli Street in the coming months. That, he says, is what he fought for. Corey Flintoff, NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2011 NPR. All rights reserved.
