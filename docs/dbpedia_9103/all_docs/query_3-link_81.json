        "text": "Heavy fighting has erupted on two fronts on the outskirts of the Libyan city of Misrata, with government troops using tanks to try to keep rebel forces at bay.\n\nMuammar Gaddafi's army also continued shelling the port, which is the besieged city's lifeline. Nato said its warships had caught government naval forces trying to lay sea mines in the harbour.\n\nBrigadier Rob Weighill, the British director of Nato's Libyan operations, said his force's ships had intercepted small boats laying mines in the harbour â€“ the only entry point to get food and medical supplies into the city.\n\n\"It again shows his [Gaddafi's] complete disregard for international law and his willingness to attack humanitarian delivery efforts,\" Weighill said.\n\nRebels have also used to the port to bring in light weapons from eastern Libya.\n\nThe main clashes in the latest fighting centred on the area around the airport, the last position held by Gaddafi's forces in the city after they were defeated in the centre.\n\nAfter several days of low-intensity clashes, rebels attacked early in the morning using automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns.\n\nGovernment troops responded with missiles and tanks, setting fire to a shoe factory and spreading a pall of black smoke across the city.\n\n\"It's very difficult against tanks,\" Rami Pengharpia, a 21-year-old rebel fighter who was wounded in the back by shrapnel, said. \"Only Nato can do something against them.\"\n\nOn the western side of Misrata, where rebels have been slowly forcing Gaddafi's forces back along the road to Tripoli, there was close-quarter fighting near the satellite town of Zawiya al-Majhoub.\n\nSeveral tanks fired at rebel positions and into civilian areas, and mortars were also used.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, at least 15 rebel fighters and civilians had died, according to doctors in Misrata.\n\nSeveral dozen people were injured. They included three young siblings, two boys and a girl who had colourful flower patterns drawn on her hand. All suffered shrapnel wounds after a shell fired by government forces struck their house.\n\n\"They will soon be able to go home, if they still have a home,\" Dr Ahmed Diab, a surgeon at the Hikma Hospital in Misrata, said.\n\nWhile rebel losses are mourned, the mounting civilian casualties are causing the greatest distress in Misrata.\n\nOn Thursday, at least nine people, including two women and three children, were killed when government forces fired mortars into residential neighbourhoods, according to doctors.\n\n\"Gaddafi knows that he cannot win in Misrata as long as Nato is flying above,\" Dr Khalid Abu Falgha said. \"But he is still trying to kill as many people as he can by shelling indiscriminately.\""
