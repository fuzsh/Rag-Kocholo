        "text": "TRIPOLI: The United Nations Libya mission (UNSMIL) called on Wednesday on Libyan authorities to free political activist Al-Moatassim Al-Areebi and to end arbitrary detentions.\n\nAl-Areebi, 29, was abducted on Monday in the city of Misrata by unidentified armed men in civilian clothes along with his friend Mohamed Shtewi, the mission said in a statement.\n\nUNSMIL said that Shtewi was released “after being beaten” but that the whereabouts of Al-Areebi “remain unknown.”\n\nUNSMIL urged Misrata city’s security and law enforcement agencies to urgently investigate the abduction of Al-Areebi, disclose his whereabouts, and secure his safe and immediate release.\n\nMisrata is a port city some 200 km (125 miles) east of the capital Tripoli. The Tripoli government is considered to be in charge of Misrata but has not commented on the case.\n\n“Reports of arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, ill-treatment, torture, and deaths in custody committed with impunity continue to plague Libya,” the mission said.\n\nLibya has had little peace or stability since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that ousted its leader Muammar Qaddafi.\n\nIt split in 2014 between eastern factions in Benghazi, the second-largest city, and western factions in Tripoli, with rival administrations governing in each region.\n\n“The Mission has documented cases of at least 60 individuals currently detained across the country for their actual or perceived political affiliation,” UNSMIL said in the statement.\n\nCAIRO: Famine is looming in four Yemeni districts after instances of hunger have rapidly surged among children in areas controlled by the internationally recognized government, a report by international experts said.\n\nAll 117 districts in government-controlled areas are expected to suffer from “serious” levels of acute malnutrition. Among them, the four districts — Mawza and Mocha in Taiz province, and Hays and Khawkhah in Hodeida province — are projected to slip into famine between July and October this year, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC.\n\nThe report reflects the worsening food insecurity in the poorest Arab nation that plunged into civil war in 2014, when Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis took control of the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north, forcing the government to flee to the south.\n\nAbout half of the country’s population — or 18.2 million people — are in need of humanitarian aid this year, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe number of acutely malnourished children has increased by 34 percent compared to last year, the report said. They include more than 18,500 children under 5 who are projected to be severely malnourished by the end of this year, it said. Additionally, the report found about 223,000 pregnant and lactating women are expected to be malnourished in 2024.\n\n“The report confirms an alarming trend of acute malnutrition for children in southern Yemen,” said the UNICEF representative to Yemen, Peter Hawkins. “To protect the most vulnerable women, girls and boys, an investment in and scale-up of prevention and treatment efforts are more critical than ever.”\n\nThe report attributed the sharp rise of malnutrition to the combined effects of cholera and measles outbreaks, high food insecurity, limited access to safe drinking water, economic decline and inadequate humanitarian aid — all are direct and indirect results of the decade-old war.\n\nThe IPC is a global partnership of 15 UN agencies and humanitarian organizations working in Yemen and funded by the European Union, the US and the UK\n\nA famine is declared in an area when one in five people or households severely lack food and face starvation and destitution that would ultimately lead to critical levels of acute malnutrition and death.\n\n“These findings should be a wake-up call that lives are at stake,” said Pierre Honnorat, the World Food Program director in Yemen. “It is critical to step up support to the most vulnerable who could sink deeper into food insecurity and malnutrition if current low levels of humanitarian funding persist.”\n\nThe report didn’t address hunger conditions in the Houthi-controlled area apparently because of a lack of access. The militia have in recent months launched a crackdown on United Nations agencies and aid groups, detaining dozens of workers.\n\nAddressing the UN Security Council earlier this month, Lisa Doughten, a senior UN humanitarian official, said the Houthi measures negatively impacted aid operations in areas under their control.\n\n“The environment in these areas is growing more constrained at a time when humanitarians are already struggling to meet the needs of millions of people across the country,” she said.\n\nTRIPOLI: Libya’s Tripoli-based central bank said on Sunday it would shut down all operations and not resume work until a senior bank official kidnapped earlier in the day was released.\n\nThe central bank is the only internationally recognized depository for Libyan oil revenues, a vital economic income for a country torn for years between two rival governments in Tripoli and Benghazi.\n\nThe bank said an unknown party was behind the abduction on Sunday of Musaab Muslam, head of its information technology department.\n\n“The bank rejects the mob-like methods that are practiced by some parties outside of the law,” it said in a statement.\n\nIt added that other bank officials had also been threatened and therefore it would suspend operations until “these practices are stopped and the concerned authorities intervene.”\n\nRichard Norland, the US ambassador to Libya, said last week that attempts to replace the bank’s senior management by force could result in the North African country losing access to international financial markets.\n\nNorland met with bank governor Sadiq Kabir to discuss concerns about armed groups gathering around the bank’s headquarters in Tripoli, the US embassy said.\n\n“Disputes over distribution of Libya’s wealth must be settled through transparent, inclusive negotiations toward a unified, consensus-based budget,” Norland said.\n\nLibya has enjoyed little peace since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that overthrew longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi, and it divided in 2014 between warring eastern and western factions.\n\nOn Aug. 9, at least nine people were killed and 16 wounded after clashes erupted between two armed factions in Tajoura, an eastern suburb of Tripoli.\n\nLibya’s Tripoli-based Government of National Unity is headed by interim Prime Minister Abdulhamid Al-Dbeibah, who was installed through a UN-backed process in 2021.\n\nEastern Libya, where the national parliament is based, is under the effective control of military commander Khalifa Haftar.\n\nDespite a 2020 truce and efforts to formally reunify institutions, a political solution has proven elusive.\n\nANKARA: Fires that have ravaged forests around Turkiye’s third most-populous city Izmir for the past four days have largely been brought under control, authorities said Sunday.\n\nAgriculture and Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli said that efforts to douse hotspots were continuing but that the flames were now largely controlled in one place.\n\n“There is no risk in the section overlooking the city. Firefighters have trapped the fire in a valley. Thank God, this fire in the Yamanlar area of Izmir is now under control,” Yumakli told reporters.\n\nAmong the new fires that broke out Saturday in the province of Izmir, one threatening the seaside resort of Cesme was also brought under control without any injuries, which was partly down to the prompt evacuation of residents, the minister said.\n\nFlames continued to char steep valleys in a district some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Izmir, but at a slower pace, Yumakli added.\n\nAt least 43 buildings were damaged in Izmir, while 26 people were hospitalized with injuries related to the blaze, according to Urban Planning Minister Murat Kurum.\n\nWild animals, cats and dogs died in the fire but no human victims have yet been reported.\n\nScientists say climate change makes extreme weather events including heatwaves more likely, longer lasting and more intense, increasing the risk of wildfires.\n\nThe Izmir fire started on Thursday and spread quickly to residential areas by winds blowing at 50 kilometers (30 miles) an hour.\n\nFirefighters were dispatched from several towns, while the army and police forces were also mobilized in the effort.\n\nFive other fires continue to rage in forest areas in other cities in Turkiye, including northwestern Bolu and Aydin in the west.\n\nThe Izmir fire was the biggest Turkiye has seen this summer.\n\nIn June, a fire that broke out in Mardin in southeastern Turkiye claimed the lives of 15 people.\n\nBEIRUT: Three United Nations peacekeepers suffered light injuries Sunday, the UN said, after a blast near their vehicle close to Lebanon’s southern border, where Hezbollah and Israel have traded near-daily fire.\n\nThe Iran-backed Hezbollah group has exchanged cross-border fire with the Israeli army in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian militant group’s October 7 attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war.\n\n“Earlier today, three peacekeepers on patrol were lightly injured when an explosion occurred near their clearly marked UN vehicle in the vicinity of Yarine, in south Lebanon,” the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said in a statement.\n\n“All peacekeepers in the patrol returned safely to their base. We are looking into the incident,” it added.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency had reported that “Israeli enemy warplanes” struck the village of Dhayra, about one kilometer (0.6 miles) from Yarine, “resulting in injuries.”\n\nA UNIFIL source told AFP the explosion that injured the peacekeepers was probably a nearby air strike, but “not a direct hit.”\n\nEarlier in August, Under Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix told AFP that UNIFIL was today “more important than ever” amid the ongoing cross-border clashes, because it was “the only liaison channel between the Israeli side and the Lebanese side in all its components, such as Hezbollah.”\n\nIn April, a judicial official told AFP that an ongoing Lebanese army investigation determined that a land mine wounded three UN military observers and a translator the previous month, while Israel implicated Hezbollah.\n\nUNIFIL’s mandate, which expires at the end of the month, is set to be renewed by the UN Security Council for another year.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed 582 people in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters but including at least 128 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nOn the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.\n\nDUBAI: Kuwait on Sunday announced power cuts in several residential neighborhoods due to “a fuel supply disruption,” according to state-run KUNA news agency\n\n“Within an hour from now, the power in some residential areas will be cut off in order to maintain the stability of the country’s power grid,” the statement on KUNA said.\n\nIt blamed “a fuel supply disruption” for the blackouts, which shut down desalination plants and some power stations.\n\nThe ministry of electricity, water and renewable energy called on consumers to conserve electricity during peak hours, from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm.\n\nSeveral non-residential areas in Kuwait faced temporary power cuts Saturday after a shortage of fuel rendered power plants inoperable.\n\nThe blackouts come while Kuwait experiences high summertime temperatures. The forecast high for the desert emirate on Sunday was 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit).\n\nWeather forecasters warned it could feel like 53 degrees Celsius (127 degrees Fahrenheit), especially as air conditioners go off due to power cuts."
