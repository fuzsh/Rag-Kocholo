        "text": "Misrata\n\nMisurata (Arabic: مصراته‎, Berber languages: Misurata, ⵎⵉⵙⵓⵔⴰⵜⴰ) is a city in the Misrata District in northwestern Libya, situated 187 km (116 mi) to the east of Tripoli and 825 km (513 mi) west of Benghazi on the Mediterranean coast near Cape Misurata. With a population of about 281,000, it is the third-largest city in Libya, after Tripoli and Benghazi. It is the capital city of the Misrata District and has been called the trade capital of Libya. The harbor is at Qasr Ahmad.\n\nGoran Tomasevic:\n\nI am constantly following the Libya story and I am in touch with few friends in Misrata since 2011 - they keep me updated, my goal is to cover the final battle for Sirte.\n\nMattia Toaldo:\n\nThe victorious end of Misrata's offensive on Sirte could be the harbinger of more infighting between different factions, ultimately, the current relative absence of violence in Libya is very fragile in many areas and could crumble under these multiple pressures.\n\nThe Misrata:\n\nWe get nothing from the unity government. This is supposed to be a fight for Libya, but it's been 70 percent led by Misrata, if nothing changes, Seraj's time will come. Maybe he will do well, but if nothing changes?"
