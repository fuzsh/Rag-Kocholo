Goran Tomasevic:

I am constantly following the Libya story and I am in touch with few friends in Misrata since 2011 - they keep me updated, my goal is to cover the final battle for Sirte.

Mattia Toaldo:

The victorious end of Misrata's offensive on Sirte could be the harbinger of more infighting between different factions, ultimately, the current relative absence of violence in Libya is very fragile in many areas and could crumble under these multiple pressures.

The Misrata:

We get nothing from the unity government. This is supposed to be a fight for Libya, but it's been 70 percent led by Misrata, if nothing changes, Seraj's time will come. Maybe he will do well, but if nothing changes?
