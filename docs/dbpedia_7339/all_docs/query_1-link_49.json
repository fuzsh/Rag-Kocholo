        "text": "Dr. Wook-Jin Seong is an Associate Professor, a tenured faculty in the Division of Prosthodontics, Department of Restorative Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota. He started his academic career as an Assistant Professor in 1999 and has successfully completed his specialty board certification process from the American Board of Prosthodontics in Feb. of 2000. He is currently responsible for undergraduate implant prosthodontics preclinical and clinical instructions as well as graduate seminar and clinical instructions and serves as division director.\n\nDr. Seong has earned his Masters in Science degree in the area of dental implants in 2000. His continued interests in implants made him further pursue his Ph.D. degree in oral biology. He earned his Ph.D. in the area of biomechanics with oral biology major and biomedical engineering minor. His research area covered nano-indentation technique on biologic tissue and materials, implant stability measurements, and healing bone-implant interface characterization. Upon completion of his PhD in 2006, his research expanded to the area of bone stimulation, dental implant bone cement & polymer-CNT bone scaffold developments, and clinical trials and animal studies.\n\nDr. Seong is participating in several subcommittees on research, clinic, and curriculum in an effort of making school-wide strategic planning successful. Dr. Seong also serves public by practicing prosthodontics including dental implants in faculty practice clinic (612-626-3233) located at dental school.\n\nFor further information, please visit http://www.tc.umn.edu/~seong001/.\n\nNIDCR, R21, Fund requested $275,000 (pending decision), Seong (PI)\n\nProject title: The safety and efficacy of a novel dental implant bone cement\n\nCenter for Translational Medicine, University of Minnesota, Seong (PI) 1/2011 – 6/2013, $330,249\n\nProject title: The safety and efficacy of dental implant bone cement: a dog study.
