        "text": "Episode 41\n\nWhy are you doing this?//Leave this instant!//You… I’m going to call the police! (?)\n\nAlright, that’s enough.//Well done.\n\nWhat in the world is this?//Why are you treating me this way?\n\nI warned you to stay away from my son.//Try meeting my son one more time. This is nothing compared to what will happen then.\n\nI didn’t meet him. I told you we broke up!\n\nWho do you think you’re lying to?//You even came all the way to the office to rob money from us!\n\nWho are you to lay a hand on my daughter’s face?\n\nOh my… what is this?\n\nYou! Where do you think you’re running off to?\n\nMom! Pretend that you don’t know.\n\nTell me the truth. The asshole who played around with you and dumped you after, was it her son?\n\nToday this bitch (?) is…\n\nHow, how, how could that woman be in that house? Were those two related? Oh my… oh my head.\n\nYou bitch! (?) Stop right there!\n\nYou’re running away after you put my daughter in this state?\n\nThis woman… you must be crazy!//Where do you think you’re touching?//(???)//You and your daughter are the same trying to blackmail us for money just to keep your mouths shut. You should be ashamed. If you live that way, you’ll be punished a thousand times.\n\nWhat?//(???)//Punished a thousand times?//You must know what a thousand punishments are like then!//That’s right, why don’t you tell me how a thousand punishments feel?//After getting a surrogate because your daughter-in-law couldn’t conceive, and then having her marry into the family, how do you feel? (?)\n\nWhat?//This woman.. What are you saying?//Who married a surrogate into their family?\n\nYou’re asking who? I’m talking about you!//Go and think carefully about what I said, you arrogant bitch. (?)//(?) Wow, your household is in great shape!\n\nWhat is that woman talking about?//That woman must be crazy!//She’s crazy.//What?//A surrogate as a daughter-in-law?\n\nI feel great!//But.. What have I done?//Oh my.. What’s Eun Nim going to do now?//Oh.. I don’t know anymore.//Is that really the problem right now?\n\nAfter getting a surrogate because your daughter-in-law couldn’t conceive, and then having her marry into the family, how do you feel? (?)\n\nGranddaughter-in-law, did you and Yoo Bin eat something bad yesterday? Why are both your faces like that?\n\nIs it because Daughter-in-law is (?)? She and Yoo Bin (?) but they really look similar, like (?).\n\nIt can’t be. It’s not. It can’t.//That young lady from before..//Now that I look back on it, they do look alike.//Oh, it’s not, it can’t. There’s no way! There’s no way.//Oh, it’s not.\n\nHow could she trash our house this much?//Oh dear, there’s nothing we can save.//What is this?//Why are you sobbing like a fool when you didn’t do anything right?//They keep walking all over you because you keep acting like such a fool!//You’re not meeting that asshole again, are you?//You said that you two broke up!\n\nWe did break up.\n\nThen why did that bitch (?) come and do all this?//I asked you if you broke up and started meeting again!\n\nIt’s not like that. We did break up.\n\n(?) You two broke up, so why did she come and make things so much worse?//That asshole.. He’s the eldest son of the Baek family, right?\n\nMom, what are you going to do now that you know that?\n\nDo you really want me to sit still and do nothing after all this?\n\nMom, let’s just run away somewhere far. Please, let’s just do that.\n\nEven if we were to run away, I can’t just leave after being treated this way.//I’m going to take pictures of everything and show them to that asshole.\n\nMom!//Mom, why are you doing this? Don’t do this!\n\nLet go! I won’t go.\n\nWhat are you going to do after you take these pictures?\n\nHello?\n\nUhnee, why does your voice sound like that?//Uhnee! It’s me, So Weol.\n\nSo Weol?//Don’t call me from now on.\n\nOh my… why is Uhnee being like this?//Is she mad at me about something?\n\nHey, why are you talking to yourself like that?\n\nOh, it’s Geum Ja Uhnee. After she left so abruptly, I was worried and so I called her, but she hung up on me after telling me not to call again.\n\nI told you already not to associate with her. Whenever I see Geum Ja, she’d always call me Uhnee and say this and that..//But think about how much she’s inconvenienced our family! She knew for a fact that our Chul was getting married but she didn’t even come to the wedding.\n\nI’m sure she has an explanation for that. Geum Ja Uhnee isn’t such a bad person.\n\nAlright then, believe whatever you want.\n\nBut Uhnee, how much did your pay (?) come out to?\n\nI don’t know, don’t ask.//Yes, Director.\n\nWhy is your voice like that again today?//The first episode’s ratings were a success. (?)\n\nYou don’t have to lie like that. I know the first episode’s ratings were only 15%.\n\nYou’re very greedy, you know that? Did you really think we were going to reach 20% by the end of the first broadcast? The last episode of the program that airs before our drama drew in 16%. If our first broadcast drew 12%, that’s a success.\n\nReally?\n\nYes, really. So keep your strength up, and once the shoot is over, I’ll stop by.\n\nNo, it’s okay. You’re probably busy so you don’t need to stop by. Just have a good shoot, alright?//Oh, what? Are you going somewhere?\n\nYes, I have something I need to do.\n\nOkay. You must be tired of being home all the time so go out and meet some friends, go shopping, and try finding a new boyfriend.\n\nOh, Uhnee!\n\nWhat? There’s nothing wrong with that. Seon Young, you’re still young so go out and have a lot of fun, okay?\n\nI’ll be back.\n\nSo you’re not the birth mother(?)?\n\nYes.\n\nSo there must be another birth mother(?) then.\n\nYes. But ever since my child was (?), I raised him myself.//There was never a time when I didn’t see him as my son.\n\nIn these types of situations, blood-related families take precedence.\n\nIs there really no way?\n\nThese types of situations are difficult. You must give up on (?) and (?).\n\nBut before you said that I was (?). That’s what you said.\n\nYou didn’t tell me this before.\n\nYoo Bin, Yoo Bin, Yoo Bin…\n\nSister-in-law..\n\nWas I the one who cheated? But why is it not possible for me? I’m the person who raised Yoo Bin until now. Why?\n\nSister-in-law, it’s probably not going to be that way.\n\nI thought that too. But, they said it’s not possible because I’m not Yoo Bin’s birth mother(?).\n\nWhat?\n\nTo tell you the truth, I didn’t give birth to Yoo Bin. But Sister-in-law, there was never a time when I didn’t think of Yoo Bin as my child. Yoo Bin is my son. But if I divorce, I don’t have a chance.. Even though I cared for him until now, am I still not a mother? What kind of law is like this?\n\nSister-in-law..\n\nWhat should I do, Sister-in-law?//What should I do?\n\nSister-in-law, please drink this.\n\nSister-in-law, you’re the only person who knows that I’m not Yoo Bin’s birth mother(?). My mother doesn’t even know. So take this to your grave, okay? Yoo Bin can’t know about this.\n\nI didn’t want to do this but I wound up telling you anyway.//Sister-in-law, you’re the only person I can trust right now. If I didn’t have you, I wouldn’t have had a clue about what to do.\n\nSister-in-law, what am I supposed to do? What about me?\n\nOh my, it’s time for Yoo Bin to come out. Sister-in-law, you should take Yoo Bin and go. Hurry and go. I want to see Yoo Bin but I don’t want him to see me like this.//I’ll call you another time.\n\nOh hello! You’re here.\n\nAuntie!\n\nThat’s right Yoo Bin.//What should we…//do now?\n\nWhat’s wrong?\n\nPlease get me a glass of water.\n\nWhat’s wrong, daughter?\n\nHello, we’re home!\n\nI’m home!\n\nIt’s not true. It’s not. Oh.\n\nOh Mother-in-law!\n\nHey!\n\nMother-in-law!\n\nHey! Daughter-in-law! Hey! Oh no, why is she like this? Hey! Daughter-in-law!//Hey! Daughter-in-law! Why are you like this? Oh no, why is she like this? Come to your senses!\n\nMother-in-law! Mother-in-law, at least drink some water.\n\nTake it away.\n\nWhy are you being like this? Have you gone crazy? I think we’re going to have to call Doctor Kim.\n\nNo, I’m alright.\n\nIf you’re okay, then why are you being like this? Why did you throw the glass of water?\n\nI said I’m okay! I’m fine!//Please leave.//Ah, I want to be alone!\n\nI think the Madam has become a little strange. There are times when she’s really weird. Even until yesterday she was fine,//but why is she being like this all of a sudden?//She even disappeared at the wedding..\n\nGive me some crackers!\n\nWait one second.//Yoo Bin, take these cookies upstairs and have some, okay?\n\nOkay!\n\nOh my.. They look alike.//How could I not have known when we’re all in the same house?//When they look so much alike?//What do I do now?//What should I do?//What that woman said must be true!\n\nAfter getting a surrogate because your daughter-in-law couldn’t conceive, and then having her marry into the family, how do you feel? (?) Your household is in great shape!\n\nDo you know how much this is? It’s something that you can’t even pay money for!\n\nMother-in-law..\n\nWhat’s going on..//Oh my. Daughter-in-law, did you slap Granddaughter-in-law?\n\nShe, she..\n\nYou! You’ve gone crazy, haven’t you?//Are you really being like this because of that lousy coffee cup?\n\nMother, do you know how much I treasure this coffee cup? You can’t even buy this abroad.//It’s not true. It’s definitely not true. That woman.. Just because I messed with her daughter, she got angry and lied. That must be it. Something like this can’t happen.//I would like a paternity blood test.//What is it that I need?\n\nPlease understand. You need to.//From what I can see, I think your mother-in-law is really sick.//Do you really think she would’ve done something like that if she were in her right mind?//Even if you’re completely sane, there are times when she lashes out. Don’t you remember on your wedding day? She disappeared without a word and when she reappeared, she had no recollection of that.//Oh my Lord, of course you don’t know.//Even before you two married, I went to the hospital with her, but she left me there and disappeared again.//So don’t take this to heart, alright?//Oh dear, oh my. Don’t cry, don’t cry.//I know how much stress you’re under.\n\nI’m sorry Grandmother-in-law. I know I’m lacking in many ways..\n\nNo, that’s not true! You’re not.//But please, don’t tell Kang Ho about what happened, alright?\n\nYes Grandmother-in-law.\n\nOh, my wife is in here?//Why? Is something going on?\n\nWhat do you mean? It’s nothing.\n\nGrandmother, did you scold my wife?\n\nYes. I scolded her.\n\nHow could there not be any hairs? Why does she clean up so well?\n\nOh Mom, what are you doing here?\n\nOh, I’m looking for a nail clipper.\n\nDid you come all the way up here because you were looking for a nail clipper? There should be one in Grandmother’s room.\n\nAh, here. Here it is.\n\nAlright.\n\nThere’s something really strange going on in this house.//I’m going to ask you one more time. Something happened today, right?\n\nNo, nothing. Hurry and wash up so we can have dinner.\n\nAh that punk is sleeping in here again! Again!\n\nThe more I think about it, the angrier I get.//I now know who that asshole is, so the only way I’ll feel better is to see how great he is.\n\nLady, lady. Where do you think you’re going? This is a restricted area and not just anyone can go through here.\n\nI’m not someone who’s restricted, and I’m here to meet the president of this company, Baek Sae Hun.\n\nDid you make an appointment?\n\nWhy don’t you call Baek Sae Hun and tell him that Hong Yeon Hee’s mother is here, then.\n\nYes?//What?//Who’s here?//Put her on.//Yes, this is Baek Sae Hun.//I’ll meet you in the company’s coffee shop.\n\nThat must be him. That’s the asshole.\n\nAre you, Hong Yeon Hee’s…\n\nYou asshole!//You lousy jerk!//You deserve to be killed!//What are you going to do about my daughter? My daughter, huh?!\n\nWhy are you doing this? Why don’t you let go of me and speak.\n\nWhy are you doing this?!//Are you going to be as calm after seeing this?\n\nWhat is this to make you act this way?\n\nYour mother, that almighty woman, look at what she did to my Yeon Hee!//What did my Yeon Hee do to deserve this?//Why does my Yeon Hee have to go through all this? Only her?!//My Yeon Hee’s so pitiful, I can’t stand it.//What is my Yeon Hee going to do now?\n\nHere, our (?).\n\nHere, for my Chul too! (?)\n\n(?), some bean sprouts?\n\nOh, that’s enough. This woman, oh.\n\nOur (?) is making all this money to bring home, and his wife can’t even do this much?//Above all else, if the man brings home money, that’s when we can live comfortably.//Darling, here’s some (?).\n\nThat’s enough, can you stop it now?\n\nWhat about you? What are you going to do from now on?\n\nWhat?\n\nOh dear.\n\nWhen are you going to get your act together and stop wasting time like this?\n\nWhat do you mean wasting time?\n\nIt’s only a matter of time until your baby is born.//All I’m saying is, you need to do something to earn enough money to put food on the table and making a living.\n\nYou don’t need to worry, I’m in the middle of planning something out.\n\nWhat is that, Chul?\n\nThat’s right, what is it? Please tell us.\n\nWhat kind of company is it?\n\nI don’t care about another person’s company, but I’m thinking of opening my own business.\n\nBusiness? What kind of business?\n\nA chicken restaurant.\n\nA chicken restaurant?!\n\nNo way. It can’t be that!\n\nWhat? Why? What do you mean no way?\n\nI want to tie your ties before you leave for work and iron your shirts for you, and other things like that!\n\nDon’t worry about that.//When I leave for the restaurant, I’ll always wear a tie.\n\nDo you really think that’s what I mean?!\n\nWhy do you have so much to say when our son-in-law says that he’s in the middle of planning it?\n\nThen do you mean to tell me to stink of oil as I fry chicken legs?!\n\nI’ll be the one to fry the chicken legs, so don’t worry about that either!//Nan Jung, you have to help me in order for me to build up the strength to work on this. Huh?//In order to not make you and our baby live difficult lives, I thought long and hard about it and came to this decision.\n\nIt’s not even the smell of flowers, or of perfume, but now every day I have to prepare chicken and stink of it?\n\nAll you have to do is have the baby and raise it well because I’ll do the rest.\n\nHow do you think I’m going to let you live such a hard life by yourself?//I can’t do that.//Go away.\n\nHere we go. Nan Jung, look at this! Nan Jung, look here! I’m dancing now!//Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!//???//Is the baby listening to this too?//Let’s do this together, Nan Jung!\n\n—- End of the first half, second half begins at 30:30.A"
