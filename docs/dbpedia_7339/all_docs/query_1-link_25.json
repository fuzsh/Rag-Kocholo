        "text": "Huh Sang Wook is a Buncheong ceramic artist known for the animated motifs and the Bakji sgraffito technique that contain the scenery of nature and life through various expressions and variations. Seasonal flowers blooming, playful gestures of animals, calmly placed daily objects, and the touch of vague memories are contained in the sometimes grandiose and sometimes quiet works. Buncheong, a Joseon-era style of Korean ceramics, is an expressive technique characterized by dark stoneware covered with white slip and a clear glaze. The most crucial aspect of his work is the method of including surface design, removing the outside glaze by scraping and carving, and applying the Buncheong technique. His process uses traces of the past to create new interpretations by infusing character into each stroke.\n\nHuh's work has been presented in numerous exhibitions and biennales, including the World Ceramic Biennale Korea and Cheongju Craft Biennale, housed by the Victoria & Albert Museum, Crafts Museum in New Delhi, Musée Ariana in Geneva, and Gyeonggi Ceramic Museum, and a finalist of the Loewe Craft Foundation Prize 2022."
