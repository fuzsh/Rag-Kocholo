        "text": "The purpose of this article is to introduce and discuss Korean communication with an emphasis on mass media research in the context of globalization. The American influence on this discipline will be focused on, and the current discussion between indigenization and globalization will be introduced. Lastly, some weak and strong signals for the future of the discipline will be proposed. The main sources are major Korean journals related to the theme in the last few years.\n\nHow does mobile communication change the way we engage in public debate and political action? This paper attempts to answer these questions by examining South Korea’s experiences. Over the last decade, Korea was transformed into a mobile-rich society, and at the same time growing political participation and social movements energised the public sphere. The paper argues that the explosion of mobile use in Korea was deeply embedded in the country’s political and economic structure. A “government-industry ICT complex” played a critical role in the diffusion of mobile communication. Yet the impact of mobile use on the public sphere mainly depended on the way the burgeoning civil society responded to the opportunities emerging from new technologies. Three examples of the political use of mobile communication—texting and political mobilisation, mobile phones and street political gathering, and mobile broadband and livestreaming of candlelight vigils—are illustrated to highlight the evolvi...\n\nThis chapter presents a detailed case study of Korean pro-am journalism initiative OhmyNews – its success story, the socio-political drivers of this success, and its operation mechanism – in order to explore its implications for professional journalism. I will first review and re-evaluate the success of OhmyNews. Then, the paper will examine the news production process of OhmyNews, its key editorial and administration strategies to point out that, despite its much-touted \"Every citizen is a reporter\" motto, OhmyNews is essentially a hybrid news cooperative based on a cleverly, creatively managed marriage between citizen reporters and trained, skilled, and experienced journalists, which is fundamental for its success. Finally, the implications of this model for the future of journalism are explored, particularly in relation to the ‘journalism is dead’ debate.\n\nThis paper examines the political perspective of alternative online videos as a new mode of everyday pedagogy where individuals publish alternative standpoints on a certain social issue and mobilize others. As an exemplar, I argue how YouTube videos on Korea's candlelight movement in 2008 helped achieve people's grassroots mobilization efforts for their voluntary, non-violent participation, exhibiting popular, public sentiment against the Korean government's policy on importing U.S. beef. Examining how female protesters constructed their political agency via online communication, this paper further maintains that videos require rethinking the conventional roles of media spectacles that (re) produces the dominant ideology. Thus, with a critical dimension of the popular online videos, this paper contributes to providing media practitioners as well as media scholars with an innovative perspective on a dialectical relationship between popular culture, media technologies, and sociopolitical mobilization within specific cultural, social, and political contexts.\n\nThis paper examines the impact of the Internet on politics in South Korea. Many have noted the Internet&#x27;s political potential due to its versatile nature as a communication medium. However, recent studies are beginning to show the influence of the Internet to be more moderate ..."
