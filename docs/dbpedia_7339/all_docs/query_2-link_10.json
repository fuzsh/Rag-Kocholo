        "text": "For other uses, see Heo (disambiguation).\n\nHeoHangul\n\n허\n\nHanjaRevised RomanizationHeoMcCune–ReischauerHŏ\n\nHeo is a family name in Korea.\n\nIt is also often spelled as Hur or Huh, or less commonly as Her. In South Korea in 1985, out of a population of between roughly 40 and 45 million, there were approximately 264,000 people surnamed Heo. The name is also found in North Korea. The character used for the name (許) means to permit or advocate.\n\nThe Heos traditionally trace their ancestry to Queen Heo Hwang-ok, the wife of King Suro of Geumgwan Gaya, one of ancient kingdoms in Korea. Her native kingdom is believed to be located in India.[1] She bore ten sons, two of whom retained the Queen's name. The Heos are traditionally considered distant kins of the Gimhae Kim clan, who trace their ancestry to the other sons of King Suro.[2]\n\nClans\n\n[edit]\n\nAs with most other Korean family names, there are many Heo clans, including the Gimhae clan and the Yangchon clan. Each clan consists of individual Heo families. Even within each clan, people in different families are not necessarily related to each other. These distinctions are important, since Korean law used to prohibit intermarriage in the same clan, no matter how remote the relationship; now, however, only those in a relationship of second cousins or closer may not marry. [2]\n\nAs with other Korean family names, the Heo clans are distinguished by the place from which they claim to originate.[2]\n\nYangcheon Heo clan[2]\n\nHayang Heo clan[2]\n\nGimhae Heo clan[2]\n\nTaein Heo clan[2]\n\nHamchang clan[2]\n\nSuwon clan[2]\n\nYangju clan[2]\n\nPeople with the surname\n\n[edit]\n\nHeo Hwang-ok (32-189), Queen of Geumgwan Gaya, clan ancestress\n\nBen Huh – South Korean-American internet entrepreneur\n\nHeo Jun (1539-1615), Joseon-era court physician\n\nHeo Nanseolheon (1563-1589), Joseon-era painter and poet\n\nHeo Gyun (1569-1618), Joseon-era writer\n\nHeo Im (1570-1647), Joseon-era physician\n\nHeo Jeok (1610-1680), Prime Minister of South Korea during Joseon Dynasty\n\nHeo Jeong (1896-1988), South Korean politician and Korean independence activist\n\nHeo Jang-kang (1925-1975), South Korean actor\n\nHuh Chin-kyu (born 1940), South Korean businessman, founder and chairman of ILJIN Group\n\nHuh Young-man (born 1947), South Korean manhwa artist\n\nHuh Kyung-young (1947), South Korean politician, chief of the Democratic Republican Party\n\nHuh Chang-soo (born 1948), South Korean businessman, chairman of GS Group and FC Seoul\n\nHur Nam-sik (born 1949), South Korean politician, 33rd, 34th,and 35th mayor of Busan city\n\nHuh Jung-moo (born 1955), South Korean footballer and manager\n\nHur Jin-ho (born 1963), South Korean film director\n\nYoung Soon Hue (born 1963), South Korean ballet choreographer\n\nHeo Joon-ho (born 1965), South Korean actor\n\nHur Jae (born 1965), South Korean basketball coach and former player\n\nHeo Yong-mo (1965), South Korean boxer\n\nAram Hur (born 1971), South Korean educator\n\nHeo Hyeon-seok (1971), South Korean dancer and musician (better known as Hyun Jin-young)\n\nHur Seung-wook (born 1972), South Korean alpine skier\n\nRobert K.
