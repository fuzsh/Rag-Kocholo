        "text": "Actor Cha Seung Won has revealed an official statement regarding the paternity lawsuit over his son Cha No Ah.\n\nOn October 6, the actor’s agency, YG Entertainment, put out an official press release as follows:\n\n“Cha Seung Won got married 22 years ago, and he became one family with his wife, as well as her three-year-old son born from her previous husband, whom she divorced. Cha Seung Won firmly believes that he gave birth to his son Cha No Ah with his heart, and he has shared that he still does not regret the decision he made at that time.\n\nHe is very heartbroken by the hurt inflicted on his family by these news reports. However, he has promised that he will continue to protect his family until the end, no matter what hardships may arise in the future.\n\nWe ask that you please refrain from releasing reports of speculation or assumptions with regards to Cha Seung Won and his family from now on.”\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported earlier that a man claiming to be Cha No Ah’s biological father filed a lawsuit against Cha Seung Won over a matter of his pride being hurt after seeing the actor pretending to be the son’s real father.\n\nSource (1)\n\nWhat are Cookies?\n\nWhen you visit any web site, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
