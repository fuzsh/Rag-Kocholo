        "text": "Here, we show that the HP-LCa2+ diet was a significant risk factor for phosphate overloading and renal phosphate wasting associated with increased risks of nephrocalcinosis, renal fibrosis, crystal nephropathy, hypophosphatemia, and bone loss. Our findings support our hypothesis that an HP-LCa2+ diet has detrimental metabolic effects on Ca2+ and phosphate homeostasis in rats through inhibiting intestinal Ca2+ absorption while increasing intestinal phosphate overloading. These events lead to high levels of PTH and low levels of FGF23 and αKlotho. The resulting hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia caused by the high-phytate/low-Ca2+ diet could explain the secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone loss and phosphaturia, which in turn causes nephrocalcinosis. By contrast, supplementation with high Ca2+ alleviated phytate-mediated pathogenic defects such as biochemical abnormalities, high PTH levels, nephrocalcinosis, renal fibrosis, vitamin D insufficiency, hypophosphatemia, and bone loss. We identified the dietary conditions that influence the bioavailability of phytate when an excess of Ca2+ is added to high-phytate diets. Thus, phytate forms insoluble Ca2+-phytate salts in the intestine, where it becomes indigestible and unabsorbable, and ultimately is excreted as undigested Ca2+-phytate salts in the feces. Thus, Ca2+ supplementation normalized impaired renal tubular Ca2+ and phosphate reabsorption by preventing intestinal phosphate overloading caused by phytate hydrolysis and improving intestinal Ca2+ bioavailability (Figure 7).\n\nWe identified previously unrecognized mechanisms of bioavailability and digestibility of phytate in vivo. Thus, HPIC and ICP-MS analyses of feces revealed that phytate is present in digestible or indigestible forms in vivo depending on the dietary Ca2+ content, revealing that phytate is only indigestible and unabsorbable when it forms multiple Ca2+-phytate salts. This finding is consistent with data of our in vitro studies (Kim et al., 2010), which show that phytate possesses three or four Ca2+-binding sites at physiological pH and forms insoluble multiple Ca2+-phytate salts. By contrast, when the Ca2+/phytate molar ratio is <5 (HP-LCa2+ diet), phytate becomes digestible, which leads to phosphate overloading in the intestine leading to renal phosphate wasting and metabolic bone disease. These results may explain why the adverse effects of high-phytate on nutrients are exacerbated when Ca2+ intake or mineral content is low (Raboy, 2007; Humer et al., 2015).\n\nPhytases can be classified into two major classes on the basis of their biochemical and structural properties, that is, the histidine acid phytases and the alkaline β-propeller phytases (Oh et al., 2004; Stentz et al., 2014). The histidine acid phytase (HAP) superfamily consists of purple acid phosphatase, histidine acid phytase, histidine acid phosphatase, and MINPP1 (Supplementary file 5). Our in vivo data suggested that a high-phytate diet can be hydrolyzed and can release excess phosphates into the gut by either mammalian intestinal or microbial MINPP1 when the diet contains a low concentration of Ca2+, although further studies are needed to determine how mammalian MINPP1 is processed and secreted into the digestive tract. The HAPs, predominantly, have positively charged amino acids in their active sites, thereby explaining how the HAPs can bind highly negatively charged phytate at acidic pH but that this is unfavorable for binding to positively charged Ca2+-phytate due to electrostatic repulsion between the Ca2+-phytate and the active sites (Oh et al., 2004). This suggests a mechanism to explain why the HAPs can only hydrolyze Ca2+-free phytate but cannot hydrolyze Ca2+-phytate when the diet contains a high concentration of Ca2+, leading to a decrease in the bioaccessibility of Ca2+-phytate and the bioavailability of intestinal phosphates and Ca2+ for absorption into the blood, eventually leading to excretion of undigested Ca2+-phytate in the feces. These results explain why high-phytate/high-Ca2+ diets prevented the development of crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone loss in rats. By contrast, β-propeller phytases mainly have negatively charged amino acids in their active sites (Ha et al., 2000), which provide a favorable electrostatic environment and strict substrate specificity for the hydrolysis of positively charged Ca2+-phytate but not Ca2+-free phytate, due to electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged phytate and negatively charged amino acids of the active sites (Supplementary file 5). Therefore, we propose that humans and other monogastric animals may lack β-propeller phytases that hydrolyze Ca2+-phytate in the gut, as high-phytate/high-Ca2+ diets could not be hydrolyzed (indigestible) in the guts of the rats and, eventually, most Ca2+-phytate was excreted in the feces.\n\nFurther, the potential toxicity of excess phosphate in the context of mineral bone disorders (MBD) associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Vervloet et al., 2017; Ketteler et al., 2017) and Ca2+-phosphate crystals (Kuro-o, 2013), together with our present findings, indicate that a HP-LCa2+ diet can be particularly harmful to patients suffering from these conditions. Moreover, dietary phosphate overload can cause tubular damage, hypophosphatemia, and Ca2+-phosphate crystals; and phosphate overloading never causes persistent hyperphosphatemia unless renal function is critically impaired (Haut et al., 1980). Thus, our study emphasizes that a detailed understanding of the dietary effects and properties of phytate may provide a new opportunity to reduce intestinal phosphate overload and to benefit patients with CKD, mineral bone disease, or crystal nephropathies.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence support our findings that phytate is digestible in the absence of Ca2+ or divalent minerals. First, studies of rats fed 14C-labeled phytate show that approximately 94% of phytate is absorbed when Ca2+ intake is low, whereas 54% of phytate is excreted in the feces when Ca2+ intake is high (Nahapetian and Young, 1980), suggesting that phytate absorption is modulated or inhibited by the Ca2+ concentration. Second, another study of rats fed 3H-inositol phytate shows that 78% of phytate is absorbed and 14% is excreted in the feces. Further, most of the radioactivity represents myo-inositol or myo-inositol monophosphate in the plasma or urine (Sakamoto et al., 1993), suggesting the phytate is digestible in vivo. The biased belief that phytate is indigestible led the authors of the above two studies to conclude that intact phytate is absorbed through the upper intestine, hydrolyzed within mucosal cells before entry into the blood, and then released as myo-inositol and phosphate into the blood or urine.\n\nSubsequently, investigators who assumed that phytate is absorbed and can be detected in the blood or urine (Grases et al., 2000) were unable to detect phytate in serum or urine despite using a highly specific and sensitive mass spectrometry (Letcher et al., 2008). These studies support the conclusion that phosphate or myo-inositol generated by the hydrolysis of phytate is absorbed rather than phytate, which is unabsorbable. Numerous explanations account for the impermeability of intestinal membranes to phytate (Reddy and Sathe, 2002). Phytate possesses six phosphate groups with strong negative charges at physiological pH, which suggests that phytate cannot cross the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane without a specific receptor (Ozaki et al., 2000). In support of this possibility, we found that phytate is only engulfed by hepatic Kupffer cells and tissue macrophages in vivo when we intravenously injected iron-containing phytate particles into live mice (Kim et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018), indicating that phytate cannot penetrate membranes of epithelial cells in the intestine. Together, these findings suggest that phytate is not absorbed in the intestine and that only products generated through the hydrolysis of phytate, phosphate, or myo-inositol can be absorbed in the intestine of rats fed phytate-containing low-Ca2+ diets.\n\nHere, we demonstrate that phytate can act as a dual demon in healthy normal rats by adversely affecting Ca2+ and phosphate homeostasis through inhibition of intestinal Ca2+ absorption while increasing intestinal phosphate overload, depending on the Ca2+ content of diets. This may explain why rats fed the HP-LCa2+ diet exhibited high levels of PTH and 1,25(OH)2D, as well as low levels of FGF23 and αKlotho. Moreover, our findings are consistent with data from a large population-based study of subjects with preserved renal function without CKD, which showed that PTH levels increase earlier than FGF23 levels as kidney function decreases and that high FGF23 levels are more closely associated with low levels of 1,25(OH)2D than with excessive renal phosphate wasting (Dhayat et al., 2016). Thus, our results suggest that high levels of 1,25(OH)2D may suppress the expression of calvarial FGF23 in rats fed the HP-LCa2+ diet, in accordance with an earlier study showing that Ca2+ deficiency is highly associated with low levels of FGF23 (Rodriguez-Ortiz et al., 2012). Moreover, Ca2+ deficiency increases the levels of 1,25(OH)2D, which leads to low levels of FGF23 in Ca2+-deficiency states (Clements et al., 1987).\n\nHowever, previous studies that investigated the effects of phytate on kidney stones in rats report conflicting results, which we ascribe to differences in dietary compositions, particularly to the ratio of Ca2+/phytate and analytical laboratory methods (Grases et al., 2000). Specifically, the AIN-76A purified rodent diet containing 1% phytate prevents the development of kidney stones compared with the AIN-76A controls (Grases et al., 2000). Further, Grases et al. (2000) concluded that rats fed the AIN-76A diet developed mineral deposits at the corticomedulary junction from Alizarin Red S staining, whereas Lien et al. (2001) did not find an increased incidence or severity of renal tubular mineralization in rats fed the AIN-76A or AIN-93G diet. Consistent with this, we found that rats fed the AIN-93G control diet did not have nephrocalcinosis. Moreover, we found that an AIN-93G-based HP-LCa2+ diet induced biochemical and urinary abnormalities associated with kidney disease as well as histopathological defects in the kidney. Phytate in the AIN-96-G diet caused a dramatic time- and concentration-dependent increase in PTH levels, leading to PTH-induced impairment of the renal reabsorption of Ca2+ and phosphate, and predisposed rats to the development of hypophosphatemic rickets and nephrocalcinosis."
