        "text": "They call it \"kwarosa\" — death from overwork. South Korea's delivery workers say they are being sacrificed to keep the nation going during the pandemic.\n\nIt was after 1:00am on a Sunday morning when a text message pinged on South Korean delivery driver Lee Seong-Wook's phone. It was from a co-worker. \"I'm still working,\" the message said.\n\nEven at that late hour, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. After all, Seong-Wook's workmate Im Gwang-Soo had been clocking 90-hour weeks.\n\n\"We didn't pay much attention [to the message],\" Lee Seong-Wook says. \"But what a turn of fate. In the morning there was a phone call — he's collapsed.\"\n\nIm Gwang-Soo, a 48-year-old father of two, had suffered a massive brain haemorrhage overnight and slipped into a coma. Doctors gave him a 5 per cent chance of survival.\n\nSeong-Wook knows how easily it could have been him. Like Gwang-Soo, he's in his 40s, separated with two young kids and working gruelling six-day weeks as a delivery driver in South Korea's sprawling capital, Seoul.\n\n\"It wasn't because he was weak,\" says Seong-Wook. \"We lived the same life for six months. Just the other day he tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Hey, it's tough, isn't it? Come on, we can do it!' But he collapsed first.\"\n\nSouth Korea's delivery drivers work for hours packing their own vans for no pay.\n\nForeign Correspondent: Mitch Woolnough\n\nSouth Korea's delivery workers were already overworked before the pandemic. But with COVID-19 cases soaring this year with the arrival of the Delta variant, a surge in online shopping has pushed many beyond breaking point. Unions say 21 delivery workers have died from overwork during the pandemic.\n\nSouth Korea has the longest working hours in the developed world. In just a few generations, the country's culture of hard work transformed a war-torn Japanese colony into the world's 10th-largest economy.\n\nLeaders promised the people that their sacrifices would pay off and their children would reap the rewards. But many Koreans say they're still paying the cost. In one of the world's most advanced economies, death by overwork is so common there's a word for it: \"kwarosa\".\n\nWith Gwang-Soo's life hanging by a thread, Seong-Wook says this \"vicious cycle\" of overwork is to blame. It's a cycle he hopes will soon be broken, before his own children come of working age.\n\nSeong-Wook hasn't held his daughters in six months. His unrelenting workload makes it almost impossible for now. On a dark street corner under the glow of neon lights, at the end of another 16-hour day, he swipes through videos of them.\n\n\"They are always on my mind, running towards me,\" he says. \"They are the reason I am doing this, trying my best.\"\n\nIt's 7:00am at a regional distribution centre and Seoul's delivery drivers are about to face the first indignity of the working day.\n\nThousands of parcels are waiting here to be sorted, but the job won't be done by warehouse staff.\n\nDrivers like Seong-Wook are expected to sort and load the packages into their own vans.\n\nIt's a job that can take hours. And the worst part — the drivers don't get paid to do it.\n\nSeong-Wook parks his truck next to a pile of boxes. The pressure is on to sort them quickly and accurately. Getting it wrong could mean painful doubling back during already long shifts. So the giant game of Tetris begins, with the last packages to be delivered going in first.\n\nDelivery workers like Seong-Wook have kept South Korea's economy moving during the pandemic. But as the public health restrictions ratchet up again, the pressure on them is mounting.\n\nThey're spending even longer than usual sorting through the sheer volume of packages, delaying when they can start their deliveries. Many won't finish the workday until midnight.\n\nLee Seong-Wook often works to midnight. For his hard work, he'll be paid less than $200 a day.\n\nForeign Correspondent: Mitch Woolnough\n\nA problem with the conveyor belt has delayed Seong-Wook's start time even further today. It's already 2:00pm by the time he's ready to make his first delivery.\n\n\"It took me seven hours,\" he says. \"Seven hours! I've finally arrived at my first house.\"\n\nMore than 200 boxes are piled in the back of the truck. The overflow spills into the front seat. Seong-Wook only gets paid when he delivers a package, with each one earning him 800 won, or less than $1.\n\nSeoul is a vast metropolis of 10 million people, and its gleaming skyline might be dominated by skyscrapers of glass and steel, but Seong-Wook's delivery patch in Seongnam is an urban jungle of bricks and mortar.\n\nRows of tiny apartments line the steep streets, some perched six storeys above the pavement. The tight, twisted staircases seem purpose built to make life difficult for delivery drivers. Many of the buildings date back to South Korea's post-war reconstruction period and were built without elevators.\n\n\"Hello. Delivery man,\" he calls up to a woman on the stairs above. \"Don't come down! Please, don't come down.\" Potential exposure to COVID-19 is just one of the perils of the job.\n\nSeong-Wook weaves the van through the narrow alleyways, dodging pedestrians and scooters. Some homes are simply inaccessible except on foot.\n\n\"You have to park the car in one spot and, using a trolley, walk more than a block for deliveries,\" he says. \"That's the hardest part.\"\n\nThere's no time for a lunch break.\n\nUndelivered packages can incur a late fee, sometimes worth many times what a driver earns for delivering the item.\n\nSo he moves quickly in the sweltering summer heat, beads of sweat forming on his brow, the unflinching blue sky mirrored in his sunglasses.\n\n\"If I cannot deliver all the items, I need to start very early the following morning,\" he says.\n\n\"We are working in a terrible environment.\"\n\nIt's this \"terrible\" working environment that saw South Korean delivery drivers take to the streets in protest throughout 2021. Change has been promised but unions say it's not coming fast enough.\n\nIn July, drivers for Korea Post staged an eight-day strike to protest against deaths from overwork, culminating in a rally in downtown Seoul. They received no income for the days of missed work and risked arrest under South Korea's COVID health regulations.\n\n\"We are dying, that is why we are here,\" postal delivery worker Huh Wonjea told Foreign Correspondent. \"We don't want to die, but they never want to hear our voice.\"\n\nBack in January, logistics companies struck a deal with unions that would see more workers hired to help with sorting packages to take the pressure off the drivers. They also pledged to reduce working hours and stop deliveries after 9:00pm.\n\nThe deal was meant to come into effect in June but has been delayed until January 2022. Wonjea worries how many of his fellow drivers might die before then, especially as the pandemic puts more pressure on them daily.\n\n\"This is not right. This is not right,\" Wonjea said. \"They claim that the government successfully managed the defence of this pandemic situation, which might be true. Who were the ones who were sacrificed to support them? We are the ones … who were sacrificed to support the system.\"\n\nSeong-Wook is also fighting to overhaul South Korea's deadly work culture. He's a branch leader for the Delivery Workers Union and has been trying to organise a protest in honour of his colleague Gwang-Soo, who is still in a coma.\n\nA recent visit to offer support to his friend's distraught wife on behalf of the other drivers has further steeled him for action. He was crushed to learn she hadn't had the heart to tell her young children what had happened to their father\n\n\"It's for our sons and daughters,\" says Seong-Wook. \"No more casualties in the future. We want to have evenings off. We want to be good family men. That's why we're putting up a fight. But it hasn't worked out so well so far because we're up against big companies.\"\n\nJang Deok-Joon's parents toured the country in a van emblazoned with the words \"Coupang killed my son\".\n\nForeign Correspondent: Mitch Woolnough\n\nOne of the big companies linked to a death by overwork is e-commerce giant Coupang, often referred to as \"South Korea's Amazon\". In October last year, 27-year-old Jang Deok-Joon died of a heart attack after returning home from a night shift in one of Coupang's fulfillment centres.\n\nThe company insisted his death was not work related but after a campaign by Deok-Joon's parents, who travelled the country in a delivery truck bearing the slogan \"Coupang Killed My Son!\", the South Korean government officially ruled it a death by overwork.\n\n\"There will be other victims like my son, there will be families like us,\" Deok-Joon's mother told Foreign Correspondent. \"Do you really think it's OK to turn a blind eye or force someone to be sacrificed for your convenience?\"\n\nAs daylight fades over Seoul, the pile of boxes in Seong-Wook's van seems to have hardly shrunk.\n\nIt's now a race against a looming deadline that could cost him a big chunk of the day's earnings.\n\nIn 2018, the South Korean government introduced a law to cap the work week at 52 hours, but most essential workers and subcontractors like delivery drivers were excluded from the cap. With the current workload, Seong-Wook says drivers have \"no choice but to deliver through the night, even at dawn\".\n\nJust before 9:00pm, after 14 hours on the job, he gets an automated message from his employer telling him to finish his deliveries. In a matter of minutes the company's computer system will shut down, making it impossible to log packages as delivered that day.\n\n\"So what now?\" Seong-Wook says. \"I still have 66 undelivered items. They include food items. Am I meant to go home without delivering them? The company just sends this message to cover themselves.\"\n\nHe keeps working. It'll take at least another hour to finish. Any boxes he delivers after 9:00pm will have to be marked as \"delivered\" tomorrow. For fresh food items, he'll pay late fees.\n\n\"The late fee … is the price of the item. If this food item is 50,000 won, we'll be charged 50,000 won,\" he says. That's a fine of roughly $60 for an item he's paid less than $1 to deliver.\n\nAt 10:45pm, Seong-Wook finally calls it quits.\n\nFor a 16-hour day, he's earned about $180, but that's before paying tax, his petrol and phone bill, and any penalties for late deliveries.\n\nHe'll rise early tomorrow to do it all again. \"I'll kick the bucket myself at this rate,\" he says.\n\nIt's been two months since Im Gwang-Soo fell into a coma. His life still hangs in the balance. After a recent operation, doctors have upgraded his prognosis to a 20 per cent chance of survival.\n\nLee Seong-Wook is keeping a close eye on his co-worker's delivery van. Gwang-Soo's truck was attracting parking tickets and complaints where it was left, so Seong-Wook has brought it home for safekeeping.\n\n\"I brought it to my house because I have some space for parking,\" he says. \"If he wakes up, he can drive his truck again. We're waiting for a miracle.\"\n\nSeong-Wook is separated from his wife and lives alone in a small house close to the distribution centre. One of the other drivers recently caught COVID-19, fuelling Seong-Wook's wife's fear he could spread the virus to their daughters.\n\nFor now, keeping his distance is just another sacrifice he makes for them.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Korean people work hard. But as people keep dying, questions are asked about why it's happening and people start to realise it's because of overwork.\n\n\"If our generation can't change it, it'll be passed down to the next generation, and then what we do for our children would be meaningless.\"\n\nWatch Foreign Correspondent's 'Dead On Arrival' tonight at 8:00pm on ABC TV and iview, or streaming live on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nCredits"
