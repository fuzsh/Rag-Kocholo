        "text": "Discussion\n\nMuch controversy still exists about maternal-to-fetal transmission of HPV, specifically about the magnitude of the risk and the route and timing of such vertical transmission. In this cohort of 153 normal pregnant women, HPV DNA was detected in 14% of women in first trimester, 18% in the second trimester, and 10% in the third trimester; 24% of women were positive for HPV DNA in at least one trimester of pregnancy. At birth, 5.2% (8/153) of neonates were positive for HPV DNA, and seven of these eight neonates had mothers who were positive for HPV DNA during pregnancy. Detection of HPV in neonates was associated not only with detection of HPV DNA in mother in the third trimester of pregnancy, but also in the first or second trimester.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated an increased risk of HPV vertical transmission in neonates born to mothers at high risk, including women with a history of genital warts, abnormal Pap smears, or cervical dysplasia [10], [18], [19]. However, the risk of vertical transmission in low-risk pregnancies varies significantly between studies. Tenti et al reported a 30% risk of vertical transmission with a 1.5% risk of neonatal infection, all born to HPV-positive mothers [20]. Tseng et al reported similar results with a vertical transmission rate of 39.7% from HPV 16/18-positive mothers to their newborns [21]. In contrast, in two small studies, Smith et al [6] and Sarkola et al [22], found only a 7.7% (1/13) and 15.8% (3/19) risk of vertical transmission, respectively.\n\nThe strength of the current study is that, in contrast to all prior studies that looked only at HPV status in the third trimester and mother-to-fetal transmission, we followed low-risk pregnant women with HPV testing longitudinally throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period. In the current study, 88% (7/8) of newborns who were positive for HPV had mothers with antenatal HPV DNA detection. As shown in , only three out of eight neonates positive for HPV had the same HPV types as that detected in their mothers in the third trimester of pregnancy. However, when comparing neonatal and maternal HPV types across all gestational ages, the concordance rate of HPV type is 75% (6/8) ( ). This observation provides additional evidence in support of the hypothesis that vertical transmission may occur early in pregnancy.\n\nAmong 8 neonates who were HPV DNA positive, one neonate had different HPV type to its mother and another was born to mother without detectable antenatal HPV DNA. This discrepancy may be explained by contamination of the sampling or PCR technique (but these explanations are unlikely due to the methodology used to prevent contamination during sample collections and analysis), or by vertical transmission at other times during pregnancy when maternal sampling for HPV was not done. As we collected maternal samples for HPV DNA detection at only three time points during pregnancy, we may have missed the critical maternal HPV infection responsible for the vertical transmission, which was then cleared from the genital tract by the maternal immune system before the next HPV test.\n\nThe precise route of vertical transmission remains unclear. Several studies have reported that the risk of vertical transmission is increased with vaginal delivery, suggesting that perinatal transmission occurs as the fetus passes through an infected birth canal [6], [23], [24]. However, other investigators have reported that cesarean delivery is not protective against perinatal transmission [22], suggesting that route of delivery may not be a critical risk factor. In the current study, the risk of HPV DNA detection in neonates was not significantly reduced in women delivered by cesarean delivery. Indeed, more HPV DNA-positive neonates were born by cesarean than vaginal delivery (p<0.05, ). These data suggest that other routes of vertical transmission may exist. These may include periconceptual transmission and/or antenatal transmission (through either transplacental hematogenous transmission or ascending infection) or through amniotic fluid [13], [25], [26]. Tseng et al favored transplacental hematogenous transmission, because they detected HPV 16 DNA in 14% of cord blood and showed that HPV DNA in cord blood was more closely related to the maternal HPV DNA status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells than that in cervicovaginal cells [27]. In contrast, Sarkola et al favored ascending intrauterine infection, because they detected HPV DNA in 4.2 and 3.5% of placenta and cord blood samples, respectively, and localized HPV DNA in placental syncytiotrophoblastics using in situ hybridization [22]. In addition, Armbruster-Moraes identified HPV DNA in amniotic fluid samples in the presence of intact fetal membranes in patients with abnormal Pap smears, suggesting that the virus may be able to pass across the fetal membranes and be transmitted to the fetus via the amniotic fluid [28].\n\nIn the current study, we measured HPV DNA in the maternal genital tract using a cervical swab. This should be distinguished from serostatus, which refers to evidence of active or past infection [29].\n\nWe considered neonates positive for HPV if cord blood or nasopharyngeal aspirate tested positive for HPV DNA. This definition may over-estimate the actual burden in neonates, since it does not identify live virus [30]. In addition, the HPV test is a qualitative and not a quantitative test; as such, we were not able to measure viral load in the study population. Further investigation is needed to determine whether or not HPV vertical transmission is related to the viral load in the maternal genital tract.\n\nThe clinical significance of HPV DNA detection in neonates also needs to be further investigated. The presence of HPV DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirate may represent infection or simply exposure. In the prior studies of Park et al. and Rombaldi et al., all infants who were HPV positive at birth subsequently tested HPV negative at both 6 months and 12 months of life [10], [31]. However, other reports have shown that HPV can be detected persistently in infants for months and years after birth, suggesting that this is not simply contamination with maternal virus [12], [13]. Although HPV is known to cause clinical disease, including benign orogenital lesions (warts) as well as cancer of the cervix and head and neck, it is still unclear how often infantile HPV infection progresses on to clinical disease [4]. If vertical transmission does occur and if the virus can persist in a dormant state for many years, then mother-to-fetal transmission may be laying the blueprint for cancer development later in life in many organ systems.\n\nIt has recently been suggested that a subset of head and neck squamous cancers, especially oropharyngeal cancer, is HPV-related [5]. Indeed, 40–80% of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers in the US are positive for HPV 16 [2]–[5]. In spite of the importance of HPV in oropharyngeal cancer, the epidemiology and natural history of oral HPV infection is not well understood. Evidence suggests that the transmission of oral HPV is related to sexual behavior, because risk factors for HPV-positive head and neck cancer include early age at first sexual intercourse and a large number of lifetime oral sexual partners [7]–[9]. However, since 40% of oropharyngeal cancers have less than 3 lifetime sexual partners and 8–40% have no history of oral sexual behavior, other route of transmission should be also considered, [7], [8]. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus might be one such source of oral HPV infection. Up to 80% of neonates born to mothers with genital HPV are themselves positive for HPV in nasopharyneal aspirate or oral mucosa [10]–[12]. Until now, there has been a paucity of information regarding this relationship, and little is known about the clinical significance of HPV detection in neonates or how such infections can be prevented by HPV vaccination. Although only one neonate in the current study was positive for HPV-16 DNA (0.7% (1/153)), which is the most commonly found type in oropharyngeal cancer, this low prevalence may be due to the fact that we enrolled low-risk pregnant women, only 2 of whom were positive for HPV-16. The study by Cason et al enrolled pregnant women with a prevalence of HPV-16 infection as high as 69% and in this cohort, vertical transmission of HPV-16 was reported as 73% at 24 hours after birth, of which 83% persisted to 6 months of age [12].\n\nIn conclusion, HPV DNA can be detected in 5% of neonates born to healthy women, and is associated with detection of HPV in mothers during any of the three trimesters of pregnancy. This observation has major implications for our understanding of the route and timing of HPV mother-to-fetal transmission."
