        "text": "SEOUL – Cannes-winning South Korean actress Jeon Do-yeon has been confirmed to play the lead in the upcoming local romance A Bastard, its production company Sanai Pictures announced.\n\nWritten and directed by Oh Seung-wook, the film is described by makers to be a “hard-boiled romantic thriller” that explores relationships intertwined around a murder case. Jeon will play the defendant’s girlfriend, who falls for the detective investigating the case.\n\nPHOTOS: The Scene at Cannes 2014\n\nKim Nam-gil will the play the detective, replacing The Face Reader‘s Lee Jung-jae. The latter dropped out of the role after suffering an injury on the set of an actioner currently under production, The Big Match.\n\n“Director Oh Seung-wook is well known for penning the script of Hur Jin-ho‘s [popular romance] One Fine Spring Day and made an impressive directorial debut in 2000 with Kilimanjaro. He is expected to deliver yet another unique mise-en-scene with A Bastard,” said a spokesperson for Sanai Pictures. “Jeon Do-yeon will be playing a character who possesses both strength and innocence — something only an actress of such caliber can portray.”\n\nCANNES PHOTOS: Glamorous Gowns at the Fest\n\nThe 41-year-old Jeon won the Best Actress Award at Cannes in 2007 for Lee Chang-dong‘s Secret Sunshine, and has returned to the French festival this year as a judge. She last appeared at la Croisette with the 2011 Korean competition piece The Housemaid."
