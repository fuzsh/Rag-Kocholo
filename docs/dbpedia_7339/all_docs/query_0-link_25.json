        "text": "Study Design\n\nThis study was designed to identify and analyze how differences in suicide survival and demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables vary depending on psychiatric diagnosis for patients who were admitted to the hospital after DSH. We chose certain factors, previously shown to have moderate to high correlation with DSH or death by suicide, as target variables for analysis using the KNHIS database [2,4,11,14,37]. Through this process, a total of 11 variables from the KNHIS database were extracted for in-depth analyses: age, sex, drinking, smoking, cancer, physical disability, insurance type, psychiatric disorders or psychiatric diagnosis, self-harm treatment setting, self-harm method, and somatic disorders or Charlson comorbidity index (CCI; Multimedia Appendix 1). Before performing the main analyses, we preprocessed the data using the following 4 steps.\n\nFirst, we included suicide survival status and DSH severity in the DSH-related factors. Death status was classified by confirming the date of death, and suicide death was classified by confirming the diagnostic code with X60-X84 from the ICD-10. We also classified the severity of DSH using the DSH method. DSH attempts with drugs (X60-X64) and cutting (X78) were defined as nonfatal DSH. In addition, we defined DSH attempts as fatal DSH including hanging (X70), pesticides (X68), or jumping from heights (X80), according to previous studies [38,39].\n\nSecond, we included age and sex in the demographic factors. We excluded patients under the age of 10 years because the cause of death could be accidental, and death by suicide was perceived as intentional after the age of 10 years [40]. We analyzed the differences between the groups by grouping the ages by 10 years.\n\nThird, we included CCI, cancer, psychiatric visits, and disability in the health-related factors [36]. CCI is a widely used comorbidity correction method that involves assigning a specific weight of 1 to 6 points to 19 diseases identified by medical record surveys and then adjusting the sum of these weights [36]. This was used to confirm the risk of DSH according to the severity of the disease. We also categorized the patients into 2 groups: those who had at least one cancer diagnosis and those who had none, regardless of the type of cancer. For psychiatric visits, we included all events when patients had been given a psychiatric diagnosis at least once, not only in the psychiatric department but also in other departments. Disability was classified into 6 grades and was used as a substitute indicator of mobility. These grades were also classified into 3 categories: severe (grades 1-3), mild (grades 4-6), and no disability [41].\n\nFinally, we included smoking, drinking, and NHI as the socioeconomic factors. For smoking and drinking, although the units of measurement were different according to the type of alcohol and tobacco, we categorized patients into 3 groups according to its severity: (1) severe, when substantial use level required health care provider or expert help, (2) moderate, when substantial use level was less severe but abstinence was recommended, and (3) NA, when a related item was not measured because of nonsubstantial users or unknown reasons. For NHI, we classified people into 2 groups: Medical Aid beneficiaries (Medical benefit) who are covered by the Medical Aid program as a low-income population and NHI members with employee health insurance and local-subscriber health insurance (employee or local) above the threshold of 50% of the median income who are covered by the NHI program [42].\n\nOf the 6350 patients who committed DSH, 18 (0.28%) patients with missing birth dates and 54 (0.85%) patients aged <10 years were excluded. The cohort database in this study comprised 6278 patients who had experienced more than one deliberate episode from January 2002 to December 2020, and among the cohort participants, 5008 survivors and 632 suicide deaths were selected for the analysis ( ).\n\nTo determine how psychiatry and its treatment affect DSH, we divided the patients into the following groups: (1) those who self-harmed before receiving a psychiatric diagnosis, (2) those who self-harmed after receiving a psychiatric diagnosis, and (3) those who did not receive a psychiatric diagnosis. We then analyzed whether these groups showed significant differences in their features.\n\nA psychiatric diagnosis can be received in other departments through practices such as the prescription of psychiatric drugs. We also analyzed in detail whether there were significant differences between the groups classified according to the department providing the psychiatric diagnosis. All patients were classified into five groups as follows: (1) psychiatric diagnosis received only from psychiatry, (2) psychiatric diagnosis received from other departments and then from psychiatry, (3) psychiatric diagnosis received from psychiatry and then from other departments, (4) psychiatric diagnosis received from other departments only, and (5) no psychiatric diagnosis. Next, we analyzed whether there were significant differences between the groups.\n\nPatient Characteristics\n\nA total of 5640 patients were included in this study, of which 2573 (45.62%) were male, and the remaining were female. Of the 5640 patients, 4576 (81.13%) patients received a psychiatric diagnosis between January 2002 and December 2020, with 3821 (67.75%) patients receiving a psychiatric diagnosis before self-harm. In total, 1064 (18.87%) patients did not receive any psychiatric diagnosis or treatment.\n\nThere were significant differences in all features, including demographic, health-related, socioeconomic, and survival variables between the groups (P<.001; ). Most notably, there was a significant difference in survival rates sequentially in the group that did not receive a psychiatric diagnosis (81.48%), followed by one group that received psychiatric diagnosis and later self-harmed (89.06%), and one group that self-harmed before receiving the psychiatric diagnosis (97.7%). As each group had distinct characteristics, we described the characteristics of each group in the order of the suicide survival rate as follows.\n\nTable 1\n\nSelf-harm before receiving psychiatric diagnosis (n=755, 13.39%)Self-harm after receiving psychiatric diagnosis (n=3821, 67.75%)No psychiatric diagnosis (n=1064, 18.87%)Total (N=5640)P value Suicide survival status, n (%) <.001Survived738 (97.7)3403 (89.06)867 (81.48)5008 (88.79)Death by suicide17 (2.3)418 (10.94)197 (18.52)632 (11.21) Self-harm severity, n (%) <.001Fatal364 (48.2)1393 (36.46)600 (56.39)2357 (41.79)Nonfatal391 (51.8)2428 (63.54)464 (43.61)3283 (58.21) Demographic factors Sex, n (%) <.001Male399 (52.8)1505 (39.39)669 (62.88)2573 (45.62)Female356 (47.2)2316 (60.61)395 (37.12)3067 (54.38)Age, median (range)40.0 (25.0-53.0)48.0 (32.0-63.0)43.0 (29.0-54.0)46.0 (30.0-59.0)<.001 Age group, n (%) <.00110-19104 (13.8)264 (6.91)123 (11.56)491 (8.71)20-29139 (18.4)562 (14.71)154 (14.47)855 (15.16)30-39134 (17.7)523 (13.69)192 (18.05)849 (15.05)40-49133 (17.6)670 (17.53)213 (20.02)1016 (18.01)50-59132 (17.5)686 (17.95)200 (18.80)1018 (18.05)60-6961 (8.1)430 (11.25)88 (8.27)579 (10.27)70-7931 (4.1)405 (10.60)73 (6.86)509 (9.02)>8021 (2.8)281 (7.35)21 (1.97)323 (5.73) Health-related factor Charlson comorbidity index score, median (range)0.0 (0.0-2.0)1.0 (0.0-3.0)1.0 (0.0-2.0)1.0 (0.0-3.0)<.001Cancer, n (%)298 (39.5)1827 (47.81)363 (34.12)2488 (44.11)<.001Psychiatric visit, n (%)540 (71.5)3261 (85.34)0 (0.00)3801 (67.39)<.001 Disability, n (%) <.001Mild43 (5.7)353 (9.24)52 (4.89)448 (7.94)Severe32 (4.2)255 (6.67)21 (1.97)308 (5.46)No680 (90.1)3213 (84.09)991 (93.14)4884 (86.60) Socioeconomic factor, n (%) Smoking <.001Moderate283 (37.5)1731 (45.30)403 (37.88)2417 (42.85)Heavy171 (22.6)702 (18.37)252 (23.68)1125 (19.95)N/Aa301 (39.9)1388 (36.33)409 (38.44)2098 (37.20) Drinking <.001Moderate265 (35.1)1697 (44.41)376 (35.34)2338 (41.45)Heavy190 (25.2)730 (19.11)278 (26.13)1198 (21.24)N/A300 (39.7)1394 (36.48)410 (38.53)2104 (37.31) National Health Insurance <.001Employee or local718 (95.1)3343 (87.49)1029 (96.71)5090 (90.25)Medical benefit37 (4.9)478 (12.51)35 (3.29)550 (9.75)\n\nFirst, the group without a psychiatric diagnosis had the lowest suicide survival rate (867/1064, 81.48%) and highest rate of fatal self-harm (600/1064, 56.39%). A total of 1064 patients were included in the group, 197 (18.52%) of whom died by suicide. The median age was 43.0 (range 29.0-54.0) years, and 669 (62.88%) patients were male. This group was mainly composed of middle-age men (605/1064, 66.87%) in their 30s and 50s. Regarding health-related factors, none of them had a history of psychiatric visits, and many (991/1064, 93.14%) had no disability. Regarding socioeconomic factors, most had employee or local insurance (1029/1064, 96.71%) and had the highest rate of heavy smokers and drinkers among the 3 groups.\n\nSecond, the group that self-harmed after receiving a psychiatric diagnosis had the highest rate of DSH using the nonfatal method (2428/3821, 63.54%). A total of 3821 patients were included in this group, 418 of whom died by suicide. Regarding demographic factors, there was a high proportion of older women (aged >60 years) and the median age was 48.0 (range 32.0-63.0) years. They had the highest rates of cancer (1827/3821, 47.81%) and psychiatric visit history (3261/3821, 85.34%) among the 3 groups. A history of disability was noted in 608 (608/3821, 15.91%) patients. Socioeconomic factors had the highest rates for medical aid benefit insurance (478/3821, 12.51%), moderate smoking (1731/3821, 45.30%), and drinking (1697/3821, 44.41%).\n\nFinally, the group that self-harmed before receiving a psychiatric diagnosis, that is, the group that self-harmed before clinical visits, had the highest suicide survival rate (738/755, 97.7%), with a high rate of nonfatal self-harm (391/755, 51.8%). A total of 755 patients were included in this group, 17 of whom died by suicide. The median age of the patients was 40.0 (range 25.0-53.0) years, and 399 (52.8%) patients were male. They had a higher rate of people in their 10s and 20s (32.2%) than other age groups. Cancer, disability history, and psychiatric visit history was noted in 298 (39.5%), 37 (4.8%), 75 (9.8%), and 540 (71.5%) patients, respectively. Regarding socioeconomic factors, most participants had employee or local insurance (718/755, 95.1%), and there were more smokers (454/755, 60.1%) and drinkers (455/755, 60.3%).\n\nCharacteristics of Individuals With DSH Behavior\n\nWe also classified all patients into 5 subgroups based on the medical department they had received a psychiatric diagnosis from (Department of Psychiatry vs other departments) to determine whether psychiatric evaluation from the Department of Psychiatry as opposed to a nonpsychiatric department affected the outcome ( ). All variables were significantly different among the 5 groups (P<.001). In particular, these groups significantly differed in suicide rates from the group treated at the psychiatric clinic only, with the highest suicide survival rate (888/951, 93.4%) in the group with no psychiatric diagnosis and the lowest suicide survival rate (867/1064, 81.48%) in the following order.\n\nTable 2\n\nVariablePsychiatric diagnosis from psychiatry (n=951, 16.86%)Psychiatric diagnosis from other departments first, then psychiatry (n=1330, 23.58%)Psychiatric diagnosis from psychiatry first, then other departments (n=1520, 26.95%)Psychiatric diagnosis from other departments (n=775, 13.74%)No psychiatric diagnosis (n=1064, 18.87%)Total (N=5640)P value Survival status, n (%) <.001Survived888 (93.4)1212 (91.13)1366 (89.87)675 (87.1)867 (81.48)5008 (88.79)Death by suicide63 (6.6)118 (8.87)154 (10.13)100 (12.9)197 (18.52)632 (11.21) Self-harm severity, n (%) <.001Fatal615 (64.7)877 (65.94)946 (62.24)381 (49.2)464 (43.61)2357 (41.79)Nonfatal336 (35.3)453 (34.06)574 (37.76)394 (50.8)600 (56.39)3283 (58.21) Demographic factors Sex, n (%) <.001Male432 (45.4)504 (37.89)562 (36.97)406 (52.4)669 (62.88)2573 (45.62)Female519 (54.6)826 (62.11)958 (63.03)369 (47.6)395 (37.12)3067 (54.38)Age (years), median (range)32.0 (21.0-47.0)45.0 (30.0-59.0)52.0 (38.0-68.0)53.0 (40.0-66.0)43.0 (29.0-54.0)51.0 (40.0-64.0)<.001 Age groups, n (%) <.00110-19178 (18.6)100 (7.52)64 (4.21)26 (3.3)123 (11.56)491 (8.71)20-29247 (25.8)227 (17.07)163 (10.72)64 (8.2)154 (14.47)855 (15.16)30-39170 (17.7)200 (15.04)191 (12.57)96 (12.4)192 (18.05)849 (15.05)40-49153 (16.0)241 (18.12)266 (17.50)143 (18.4)213 20.02)1016 (18.01)50-59101 (10.5)230 (17.29)311 (20.46)176 (22.7)200 (18.80)1018 (18.05)60-6954 (5.6)155 (11.65)180 (11.84)102 (13.1)88 (8.27)579 (10.27)70-7932 (3.3)113 (8.50)202 (13.29)89 (11.5)73 (6.86)509 (9.02)>8016 (1.7)64 (4.81)143 (9.41)79 (10.1)21 (1.97)323 (5.73) Medical history–related factor Cancer, n (%)322 (33.9)641 (48.20)812 (53.42)350 (45.2)363 (34.12)2488 (44.11)<.001Charlson comorbidity index score, median (range)0.0 (0.0-1.0)1.0 (0.0-2.0)2.0 (0.0-3.0)2.0 (0.0-3.0)1.0 (0.0-2.0)2.0 (0.0-3.0)<.001 Disability status, n (%) <.001Mild24 (2.5)106 (7.97)173 (11.38)83 (10.7)52 (4.89)438 (7.77)Severe32 (3.3)103 (7.74)118 (7.76)35 (4.5)21 (1.97)309 (5.48)No895 (94.1)1121 (84.29)1229 (80.86)657 (84.8)991 (93.14)4893 (86.76) Socioeconomic factors, n (%) Smoking <.001Moderate278 (29.2)574 (43.16)772 (50.79)390 (50.3)403 (37.88)2417 (42.85)Heavy163 (17.1)250 (18.80)291 (19.14)169 (21.8)252 (23.68)1125 (19.95)N/Aa510 (53.6)506 (38.04)457 (30.07)216 (27.9)409 (38.44)2098 (37.20) Drinking <.001Moderate250 (26.3)582 (43.76)775 (50.99)355 (45.8)376 (35.34)2338 (41.45)Heavy192 (20.2)241 (18.12)284 (18.68)203 (26.2)278 (26.13)1198 (21.24)N/A509 (53.5)507 (38.12)461 (30.33)217 (28.0)410 (38.53)2104 (37.30) National Health Insurance <.001Employee or local928 (97.6)1160 (87.22)1273 (83.75)700 (90.3)1029 (96.71)5090 (90.25)Medical benefit23 (2.4)170 (12.78)247 (16.25)75 (9.7)35 (3.29)550 (9.75)\n\nFirst, the group of patients who received a psychiatric diagnosis from the psychiatric department had the highest suicide survival rate (888/951, 93.4%).

The rate of people in their 40s and 50s (413/1064, 38.82%) was higher than that in other age groups. A history of cancer and disability was noted in 363 (34.12%) and 73 (6.86%) patients, respectively. The median CCI score was 1.0 (range 0.0-2.0). Most of them had employee or local insurance (1029/1064, 96.71%) and had the highest number of heavy smokers (252/1064, 23.68%) among the 5 groups.\n\nPrincipal Findings\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the characteristics of individuals with DSH behavior using nationwide cohort data and to determine the factors that contribute to suicide-related deaths in this population. Such efforts could provide valuable information about individuals with DSH behavior who are especially susceptible to subsequent death by suicide in South Korea, the nation with the highest suicide rate among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries [31]. We predicted that having a psychiatric diagnosis would act as a protective factor against suicide completion. This prediction was based on previous studies describing the relationship between mental health care access and suicide rates. On the basis of a recent study exploring national trends in mental health care among adults who previously attempted suicide, despite the increasing rate of suicide attempts, the use of services among those who attempted suicide did not increase; therefore, there is a great need to expand service accessibility [9]. Several studies have suggested that greater access to mental health services was associated with a reduced incidence of suicide. More access was measured in terms of living at a range of distances from the nearest mental health provider, the availability of specific services, or the density of mental health providers [44-46]. However, these studies did not differentiate between psychiatrists and nonpsychiatric physicians in their analyses. A study exploring short-term suicide risk after psychiatric hospital discharge showed a trend in which patients who had severe psychiatric conditions for which they were seen by psychiatrists and then admitted to the psychiatric ward committed suicide within a few months [47]. Despite conflicting previous findings, it is still unclear whether being seen by a mental health care professional reduces the rate of suicide-related death in individuals with DSH behavior.\n\nThe main finding of this study is that missing a psychiatric diagnosis and therefore missing an appointment with a psychiatrist may contribute to increased HRs independent of already known contributing factors such as male sex, old age, the use of fatal form of DSH, and physical disability. Unsurprisingly, the most important contributor to suicide was the use of a fatal method of self-harm, which has been repeatedly mentioned as a very important risk factor for suicide death in previous literature [3,5,6,11,14-19]. Having a psychiatric diagnosis, whether given by a psychiatrist or a nonpsychiatrist physician, was the second most important contributing factor for suicide-related deaths. In alignment with findings from other studies, having access to a hospital where the physician can evaluate one’s psychiatric conditions may reduce the risk of suicide in individuals who had or would engage in DSH [7]. More importantly, whether someone had an interview or a check-up with a psychiatrist may be more informative than any demographic or socioeconomic status information in predicting one’s chance of committing fatal forms of DSH, which could potentially lead to suicide death.\n\nAs there was a strong correlation between receiving a psychiatric diagnosis and suicide completion, it was deemed imperative to identify the characteristics of individuals who were at a very high risk of suicide death—individuals who had never received a psychiatric diagnosis. Among the 3 subgroups of DSH, the subgroup that had never encountered a medical professional for their mental health condition showed the highest percentage of deaths by suicide, and as expected, more than half of them used fatal methods of DSH ( ). From a socioeconomic standpoint, this subgroup consisted mostly of men in their 40s and 50s, who consumed heavy amounts of alcohol and received health insurance through Medicare (employment/regional health insurance). Some of these characteristics, such as male sex and substance abuse, are known risk factors for increased suicide rates [2]; some other characteristics, such as being middle-age and receiving Medicare, have not been associated with suicide deaths. The KNHIS provides mandatory public health insurance, offering coverage of health care services to almost 100% of South Koreans; 97% of South Koreans are covered by Medicare and 3% are covered by Medicaid [8]. Medicaid is provided to people whose income is insufficient to meet their needs and those of their families, and they are exempted from health insurance fees, whereas those with Medicare pay approximately 10% to 30% of their total medical expenses when using medical facilities. Hence, the type of health insurance is an indirect measure of socioeconomic status, where receiving Medicaid is associated with lower socioeconomic status. Surprisingly, compared with individuals who visited the hospital for psychiatric assessment, those who did not were mostly on Medicare. Our study’s finding is opposite to what previous studies have suggested: higher socioeconomic status, including higher levels of educational achievement, higher income, and employment, is associated with better health and lower risks of all-cause mortality, including deaths by suicide [14,48]. Medicare use may be a primary contributing factor of suicide death in these individuals with DSH behavior, as having to pay for additional medical expenses to be able to see a medical professional for mental health concern may have discouraged such pursuit. Higher socioeconomic status may also have contributed to not seeking psychiatric care; South Korea being notorious for its competitive work environment and demanding high performance and efficiency has shaped such an atmosphere where middle-age employees must hide weaknesses, such as having psychological difficulties.\n\ndisplays how seeing a psychiatrist as opposed to a nonpsychiatrist physician affected survival. For our subanalysis, we categorized individuals who had received a psychiatric diagnosis by the different hospital departments they paid visit to. Suicide-related death rates increased in a stepwise fashion. Notably, individuals who had at least 1 visit to the psychiatrist were mostly women, and this sex difference in psychiatric visits has been noted in previous literature [18]. In addition, individuals in their 20s were the largest age group for most visits to the psychiatric department. Although seeing a psychiatrist continues to be taboo for most older South Korean adults and older adults, the younger generations appear to be more willing to seek professional help and voice concerns about their mental health. This finding may also reflect the recent rise in the youth and young adult depression and anxiety cases in South Korea; this phenomenon has already been hinted in previous studies [32,49]. Another noteworthy finding is that individuals who had mild to severe physical disabilities belonged to subgroups that had received psychiatric diagnoses from psychiatry departments as well as other departments and showed a tendency to engage in more severe forms of DSH. Having a physical disability significantly increased one’s risk of DSH as well as death by suicide, in part by making them more susceptible to the deterioration of mental health [14,50]. It may be in the best interest of nonpsychiatric physicians to perform routine psychiatric evaluations and to actively consult with psychiatrists if their patients show signs of heightened anxiety and depression during treatment for their physical health conditions.\n\nThe total number of individuals with DSH behavior and suicide-related deaths was considerably small despite using NHI cohort data, which included all health-related information of the entire Korean population. According to the 2020 national statistics, 25.7 per 100,000 persons died of suicide attempts [51]; hence, the data set we used in our analyses did not account for all DSH and deaths by suicide cases in South Korea. We infer that this shortage of data could be accounted for by 2 main reasons: (1) suicide and self-harming behavior are major taboos in South Korean society and (2) suicide or self-harm–related diagnosis would disqualify one from reaping medical insurance benefits. It is suspected that most bereaved families as well as the attempters who survived for the reasons mentioned above would strongly refuse to receive a diagnosis for DSH. This would then put pressure on physicians to forgo, including self-harm–related ICD-10 diagnosis codes in the official hospital records. Thus, although high suicide rates in South Korea are readily recognized by the media and the Korean Statistical Information Service, it is not possible to acquire patient information from hospital electronic medical records and the NHI database for every DSH case. Nevertheless, the data set used for our analyses was technically gathered from every hospital in South Korea; therefore, it should represent the DSH population in South Korea to a reasonable extent. To that end, although our study results should be interpreted with careful consideration, our analyses have important clinical value."
