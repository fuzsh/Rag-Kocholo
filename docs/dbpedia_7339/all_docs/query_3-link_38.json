        "text": "I'm really okay.\n\nCha Hyun-su. I need to talk to you.\n\nWhat? Why are you only taking him? What about me? You know he's using you. Hey! Hey! Let me out, too!\n\nIt's important we deep the front gate barricaded at all times. We also need wooden planks and chains blocking the stairs. Monsters could get through at any moment. The same goes for the room back there.. Why do you think I took your side earlier? I'll be honest with you. You'll do all the dangerous work from now on. If you don't want to, then I can't help you.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThe guy in Room 1408. Can you bring him here?\n\nMyeong:The flowers at spring. I can see them even now. All I wanted was to show my daughter the pretty flowers. Truly, it was just for one second.\n\nDulsik:You must miss her a lot.\n\nMyeong:Calling me \"mom,\" for the very first time, turning over by herself… I was so touched by such small things you know…\n\nDusik:Seeing those chubby cheeks of hers… made me feel like I had everything I needed in the world.\n\nMyeong:You have children as well?\n\nDusik:I used to. Before this happened to my legs.\n\nMyeong:I want… the same thing as Hyun-su. If I end up turning, pleas just kill me.\n\nI can't do as you asked. I don't think I can take care of them without you.\n\nMyeong::Is that so?\n\nAre you sure she's not in there?\n\nNo. She's gone so... We need to all let her go now.\n\nKIM YEONG-SU, KIM SU-YEONG\n\nWait wait. I heard you're a gangster. Don't gangsters do anything for money? I'll give you everything. Just help me go outside. I…\n\nMove it.\n\nI… No, you can't…\n\nOpen it.\n\nSeung-wan:Are you sure this is okay?\n\nEun-hyuk:No but I don't think we can stop him.\n\nYou're not supposed to…\n\nWait.\n\nI/s this it? You want me starving huh? You're glad I'm locked up in here, aren't you? I bet you're enjoying this. If I turn into a monster, I'll rip you into pieces. So do something, you stupid bitch!\n\nWe have to save food for everyone.\n\nListen to me. All that stuff is mine.\n\nHe said we're all going to share it the food.\n\nDon't be ridiculous! You hear me?!\n\nYou should hold it in. I do it all the time.\n\nRescuing Han Du-sik is the main goal. The kids are secondary. Focus on the main goal. If things go south, leave the kids behind.\n\nAre you playing with people's lives?\n\nThen who should I have sent? It was the best option. We need that man in Room 1408. And we just can't afford to lose any more time.\n\nI'm sure there's another way besides using other people.\n\nMy plan is to utilize golden hour. Cha Hyun-su was critically injured, but he woke up in just a few hours. If willpower can affect the turning stage, and if he unsuccessfully fight it can fight it, he'll be the strongest weapon we have.\n\nThis is what we call a weapon. He's still human.\n\nI completely agree. For now.\n\nAnd you sent him to die?\n\nIt's in your best interest to get used to using people on the verge of turning,\n\nYou really are twisted.\n\nI don't think you understand how dangerous our situation has become. By the way, what did you think about the voting results? They're marked with Xs. I was thinking of secretly switching them. But I didn't need to after all.\n\n-So you didn't switch the votes?\n\nIt was unexpected. I didn't think people would vote to let Hyun-su stay.\n\nThat's because you made them feel guilty, talking about murder and....\n\nDo you really think they voted not to kick him out because of their conscience? Well, the man with the sword and the girl with the bat may have felt close to him because they were together. But what about the others? It's not easy to accept someone you don't know anything about, especially when your life is at risk.\n\nSo what's your point?\n\nYou still don't get it? Cha Hyun-su and Kim Seok-hyeon. Do you think they're the only ones who are turning? No. Everyone's scared. Because they don't know when they'll turn. There was someone who knew about this before the government announcement.\n\nWho's that?\n\nI don't know. It was an online blog I found by chance.\n\nWhat did it say?\n\n-Despair.\n\n-What?\n\nIt said it's a curse. And that humans will never be able to overcome it.\n\nYou believe a stupid blog post when you don't even know who wrote it?\n\nUnder the circumstances, I don't think we shouldn't ignore even the smallest clues.\n\nCRUCRU\n\nTHIS ISN'T A DISEASE. IT'S A CURSE.\n\nCRUCRU\n\nWhat's \"Crucru\"? Is it your blog?\n\n-Hey, Yi-kyung. Well… When is it? Our wedding photoshoot?\n\nWhat? Did you write you don't want to get married?\n\nNo, it's nothing like that. It's not what you think.\n\nWhere are you doing?\n\n-There will be more infected people soon.\n\n-So?\n\n-So it's not going to be safe here either.\n\nIt's still safer than here,\n\n-Do you want to come?\n\n-To where?\n\nA way to survival.\n\nHey Jisu.\n\nI think there's a monster here. Let's kill it. We can destroy it right now. You're scared, aren't you?\n\nDon't come! Don't come! Stay away, Sang-wook!\n\nOkay move.\n\nAre you trying to burn the whole building down,?\n\nWe have plenty of time to put the fire later. Just relax.\n\nIt will take ages to get to the first floor.\n\nMy goodness. I'm not sure anyone will still be alive by then.\n\nBe careful.\n\nWho's there?\n\nHe's alive.\n\nThe monster left him alive?\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nI couldn't reach my son's hand. I couldn't do anything when the monster took my son. It was too fast. If I had caught my son's hand… If I'd been able to reach that far, would my son be still alive? I can't forgive myself. I'm having nightmares every day. The monster in my head is telling me that it's all my fault. Maybe it will be better to just become a monster. No! It's my fault. I should've held onto him! I should've kept my son next to me! No! There was nothing I could do. It's not my fault.\n\nGREEN HOME BARBER SHOP\n\nShouldn't we do something about her?\n\nJust leave her be. She never associated with people like us anyway. Her daughter to a fancy school in Gangnam. Why not sent her to a local school?\n\nI'm gonna dress your wounds now.\n\n-I don't need that.\n\nYes, you do. Your bleeding has stopped, but you're still injured. Is it okay to let him go like that?\n\nThere's no need to worry about him. I bet he could take on a lion by himself.\n\nHey. You look pretty hurt, yourself.\n\nNo, I'm fine.\n\nMove that hand. It'll get infected if you don't treat it.\n\nI'll do it myself. Give me a bandage.\n\nMove that hand, pretty boy. You're turning, aren't you? Yu-ri, get away from him. Move your hand now. Or else I'll make sure your heart will never beat again. Get out of here, let's go. I wouldn't have helped you if I knew you were a monster. Get out!\n\nYou think you're so funny\n\nI was just kidding. Don't worry you don't have to leave.\n\nWhy in the world would I be scared of you when I'm going to die?\n\n-Pardon?\n\n-Yu-ri. you're gonna stay here. You're going to the 14th floor, right? And you said there are little kids there.\n\nYeah, that's right.\n\nI'm sure you can use someone who's not at all afraid of dying.\n\nNo way.\n\nWell you're fired. You've done well nursing this grumpy old man. But its time to come out of retirement. I want to play superhero before I die. Can you let me join you?\n\nYou're just acting tough.\n\nWhat?\n\nDon't fool yourself. No one really wants to die.\n\nIs becoming rude one of the symptoms of turning into a monster? Let me explain something to you pretty boy. Not being afraid of death and wanting to die are different things. I'm gonna live longer than all the rest of your kids you see.\n\nWhat do you want What are you doing there? Hey. Are you crazy?\n\nYou really… don't care about me at all do you?\n\nWhat?\n\nIf I turn into a monster, I'm sure I'll kill you. But… I don't really want to kill you when you turn into a monster. That won't be satisfying.\n\nYou're not making any sense,\n\nMa'am. Is that man outside the door still there?\n\nNo, he left and went upstairs. So don't worry about it.\n\nHe went upstairs? Shit! Son of a bitch…\n\nSon of a bitch…\n\nHave you been well? Where's the lady?\n\nIs anyone hearing this? We're in despair right now. We don't know what to do, what's happening, or how long we can survive this. But we are still alive. We can't overcome this despair. But… I'm sure there is an end. And we will hold out and fight until that end.\n\nHyun-su:Rest in peace. I'm going to fight a little longer.\n\nEun-hyuk:We will survive.\n\nHey! Over here! II'm not turning! Hey! Come over and check this out! Please help me! Look! Help! Somebody help me!\n\nMy oh my. You must've been scared. Take care of this guy\n\nAlright.\n\nWhy were you in there?\n\nSorry. Just in case.\n\n-I would've lost my mind.\n\n-I'm out now, so it's fine.\n\n-Right…\n\nAre you really cool or just pretending to be?\n\nYun-jae is really kind and patient. Are you a fan of Hanwha Eagles?\n\n-Yeah.\n\nHow did you know?\n\nHe's from Chungcheong Province right?\n\nBut you're not speaking Chungcheong dialect.\n\nI lived in Seoul for a long time okay?\n\nWhat's he so nervous about?\n\n-I guess it was really tough for him.\n\n-Maybe.\n\nEun-yu:[scoffs] You guys are such hypocrites. You pretended not to notice when he was obviously beaten up by someone, but now you're acting all nice.\n\nYEs of course but..\n\nThat hit way too close to home. I feel like shit now. Damn it.\n\nHey.\n\nThat stupid gangster!\n\nCareful, he's going to hear you.\n\nSon of a bitch..He's a murderer. That man's a murderer!\n\nYou f**king murderer.\n\nHe has no criminal record and has no motive. There 's no evidence to prove it was intentional. And as his future shows great promise, the court has decided on the following sentence. The accused, Hwang Seung-jae, Is sentenced to 11 months in prison and 2 years of supervised probation.\n\nYou shouldn't die like that. You shouldn't die peacefully. You don't deserve a humane death you bastard. You…\n\nYou f***ing murderer…\n\nYou don't deserve to live.\n\nSu-yeong, why isn't dad here with us?\n\nThey can't bring Dad here. They said it will be too sad for us if they bring him here.\n\nThat doesn't make sense though!\n\nGrandpa…\n\nWe were born human, and we'll die as humans.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nI should be strong . I'm a mother.\n\nWhat are you going to do now?\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nYou can't so this all by yourself.\n\nThere's no choice I have to. I'll deal with this on my own.\n\nYi-kyung… you did a really good job.\n\nDinosaurs used to rule the earth, but they went extinct about 66 million years ago. But this also proves that there is a possibility humans could also go extinct at any moment. However, our ancestors changed in order to survive. They called it \"evolution.\" But if we humans are forced to face an apocalypse, will we… choose another form of evolution? Or will we choose to remain human?"
