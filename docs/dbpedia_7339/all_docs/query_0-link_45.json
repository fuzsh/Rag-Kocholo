        "text": "Introduction\n\nWe are living the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since 2019. According to WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard, as of 1 September 2021, there have been 217,558,771 coronavirus infected cases of COVID-19 and 527,942 new cases were reported to WHO [1]. Pregnant women are no exception to COVID-19 infection. According to WHO collaborating centre for global women’s health’s analysis, the prevalence of COVID-19 in pregnant women was 10% among the participants who admitted for any reasons [2].\n\nBecause of physiologic changes in both respiratory and immune systems, it is well known that pregnant women are susceptible [3] and prone to develop severe respiratory infection [4]. With enlarged uterus as pregnancy progressed, diaphragm is elevated, and angle of rib cage is increased [5]. With anatomical adaptation, tidal volume and minute oxygen uptake increase and functional residual capacity and total pulmonary resistance decreases. This physiological change of pregnant women body can decrease the capacity of decompensation for pregnant women with some pulmonary complications [6].\n\nIt has been reported that the clinical course of the COVID-19 infection in pregnant women is worse than non-pregnant women with slower recovery [7]. Some reported that the severe COVID-19 infection rate in pregnant women was 70% higher than non-pregnant women of the same age [8]. In 2020, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published by US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might be at increased risk for severe illness compared with non-pregnant women [9].\n\nUntil now, there is a paucity of information regarding the actual prevalence of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. Previous studies from United States, United Kingdom, and other countries throughout the world reported relatively higher prevalence of COVID-19 among pregnant women (ranged from 1·3%~30·74% [10], [11]). However, the studies focused only on pregnant women, limiting comparability of actual prevalence between pregnant and non-pregnant women. In South Korea, National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) is a single healthcare insurer, enabling accurate nationwide estimation of disease prevalence.\n\nThis study was designed to investigate whether the prevalence and clinical outcome of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women differed from those in non-pregnant women. We compared the following outcomes between pregnant and non-pregnant (1) the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the entire population of South Korea and women aged 20–44, and (2) the prevalence of severe or fatal COVID-19. In addition, we analyzed the hospitalization rate to determine the healthcare utilization patterns of COVID-19 infected pregnant women.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results of this study, which analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in pregnant women and clinical outcome through the HIRA database in South Korea, showed that 1) The prevalence of COVID-19 infection was lower in pregnant women than non-pregnant women; 2) Among COVID-19 infected women at age 20–44, pregnant women was at higher risk of oxygen therapy after hospitalization. However, there were no cases of hospitalized severe disease or death in pregnant women with COVID-19.\n\nPrevious studies reported relatively higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection among pregnant women all over the world, ranging 1·3%~30·74% [10], [11]. In one study from the United States, tests of all pregnant women who admitted to two New-York based delivery hospitals confirmed 15·6% of COVID-19 infection, including 1·9% of symptomatic pregnant women and 13·7% of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection [13]. This prevalence was supposed to be much higher than the prevalence in general population, which was 0.16% in New York City [14], although these results are derived from different center and different periods. In another study from a large delivery hospital in United Kingdom also reported higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection (one out of 10 pregnant women) [15] and other reported the range of 1·3%~30·74% [10], [11] of COVID-19 infection among pregnant women in various countries.\n\nThe result from previous studies is different from the result of the current study, as we showed relatively lower incidence of COVID-19 in pregnant women (0·02%). The higher prevalence in pregnant women from previous studies might be partially because of higher chance of nosocomial infection during frequent antenatal visits. The nosocomial infection of COVID-19 was reported in range of 3·7%~44% [16], [17] among COVID-19 patients depending on the hospital reported. In spite of social distancing policies, pregnant women are tended to be exposed to people in hospital and might increase the risk of transmission as they regularly visit hospitals for antenatal care including fetal surveillance. However, the nosocomial infection risk is thought to be lower in South Korea than in other countries. The recent two-week nosocomial infection announced by South Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(KCDC) was relatively low at about 1% (as of September 3, 2021) [18] among newly diagnosed COVID-19 infection.\n\nIt was reported that clinical outcome and disease severity of COVID-19 infected pregnant women were not significantly different from those of non-pregnant women in early study [19]. However, recent studies reported that pregnant women were at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness than non-pregnant women, such as maternal death, intubation, and intensive care unit admissions [9], [20], [21]. According to the results of our study, the severity of COVID-19 was higher in pregnant women like previous studies. However, there were no cases of death or hospitalized severe diseases in pregnant women with COVID-19, probably because of small number of cases of COVID-19 in pregnant women. Lower prevalence of COVID-19 infection and low proportion of death or hospitalized severe diseases of COVID-19 illness among pregnant women in South Korea might be explained by effective response to COVID-19 and strong preemptive strategy for pregnant women. From the early stage of outbreak, South Korea has employed a 3 T (Testing-Tracking-Treatment) strategy to prevent and combat the spread of COVID-19. Early detection of COVID-19 through massive diagnostic testing, contact tracing and treatment of confirmed cases were effective response package [22], [23]. As a result, South Korea avoided a large COVID-19 outbreak and prevented collapse of health care system.\n\nFurthermore, South Korea adopted more protective approach for high risk groups including pregnant women, the elderly and vulnerable people than for other population. All of COVID-19 patients are treated in community treatment centers or hospitals according to the patient’s condition. Asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients were assigned to community treatment centers, and moderate or severe patients were treated in hospitals. The recommended treatments for COVID-19 infected pregnant women is not much different from those for general population [24], [25]. After confirmation of COVID-19 infection, assessment about pregnancy trimester [26], maternal condition, symptoms and severity of the disease is needed. Based on the assessment, physicians can decide treatments and medications such as oxygen supply therapy, steroids, tocilizumab, and remdesivir [25]. The low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention of pregnant women may be the difference. Despite the similar recommended treatments, hospitalization was the first option to be considered for pregnant women with COVID-19 regardless of severity of infection according to government’s guideline [23], [27]. The current study also showed that 96.2% of pregnant women with COVID-19 were monitored and treated more intensively and cautiously in the hospitals. The effective response to COVID-19 and the powerful preemptive strategy for pregnant women with COVID-19 contributed to lower risk of COVID-19 infection and better clinical outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in South Korea.\n\nPrevious studies showed that the COVID-19 infected pregnant women had higher risk of obstetrical complications such as cesarean section rate, preterm birth, and NICU admission rate [21], [28]. This findings suggested that the obstetrical outcome could be affected by the severity of COVID-19 infection [29]. In the current study, rate of cesarean section of pregnant women with COVID-19 was higher than pregnant women without COVID-19 infection. Several studies showed high cesarean section rate in pregnant women with COVID-19 (93% in China [19], 90·2% in Italy [30]). Although there is no evidence about cesarean section in COVID-19 infected pregnant women can result in better obstetric outcomes such as vertical transmission than vaginal delivery [31], the reason for higher cesarean section rate in pregnant women with COVID-19 is thought to be due to anxiety or fear about new infectious diseases [30], [32]. In other obstetrical complications had no significant difference, which is not consistent with findings of other studies [21]. However, pregnant women with COVID-19 showed less obstetrical hemorrhage than pregnant women without COVID-19. Several studies reported changes of coagulation state and elevated risk of thromboembolic events in pregnant women with COVID-19 [33], [34]. This might be the reason for less obstetrical hemorrhage in pregnant women with COVID-19 in spite of higher rates of cesarean section, which is known to have higher blood loss than vaginal delivery.\n\nThere was no clear evidence regarding effects of vaccination during pregnancy in early study [35]. However, recent studies reported that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women was similar to that of general population, and the risk of COVID-19 infection was significantly lower in pregnant women who were vaccinated when compared with those not vaccinated [36], [37]. A mass vaccination program was launched in late February 2021 in South Korea. Vaccination for residents aged 49 and under started in August 2021, and vaccination for pregnant women was started in October 2021. Therefore, effect of vaccination was limited in our study which analyzed the data up to February 2021. Further research would be necessary to study effects of vaccination on pregnant women herself and fetus.\n\nThe current study had strength and limitation. The major strength of this study is analyzing the nationally representative data. The HIRA database used in this study contains information on all claims including any diagnosis, treatments and procedures for approximately 52 million Koreans. Analyzing nationwide database enabled accurate estimation and direct comparison of prevalence of COVID-19 infection in women according to pregnancy status. Limitation of this study is lack of clinical information in the claim data. To address this issue, WHO’s ordinal scale for clinical improvement, which categorized patient states based on the treatments, was used to analyze the severity of COVID-19 infection. Also, we used fee-for-service billing codes in South Korea to identify the actual treatments given to patients."
