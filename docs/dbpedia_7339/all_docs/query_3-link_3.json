        "text": "Lee Minho is one of South Korea's most influential artists. He is an actor, producer, and creative director. With a combined 95 million social media followers on Instagram, Facebook and Weibo, he has a remarkable global reach. The Korean government's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism has ranked Lee as the number one Korean actor amongst international audiences for four consecutive years from 2018 to 2021. In addition to being a critically-acclaimed actor he is also a filmmaker creating short form content and films on his YouTube platform, \"leeminho film\"\n\nLee is now starring as 'Hansu' the AppleTV+ multilingual international drama series Pachinko (2022). Pachinko is based the best-selling novel of the same name that chronicles the hopes and dreams of four generations of a Korean immigrant family. The series was shot in North America and South Korea, and is told in Korean, Japanese, and English.\n\nLee is best known for starring in the Netflix original series, The King: Eternal Monarch (2020), one of Netflix's most watched global series in 2020. Broadcast by SBS in Korea, the series set an all-time record in 2020 for SBS's highest Friday-Saturday drama premiere ratings and maintained the number one spot on the weekly drama chart for eight consecutive weeks. Other notable roles include the series Kkotboda namja (2009), The Heirs: Highschool der Superreichen (2013), as well as films Gangnam 1970 (2015) and Shang jin lie ren (2016).\n\nAs an actor, Lee has contributed substantially to the rise and success of Korean dramas worldwide. In 2013, the TV series The Heirs transcended the South Korean market and had millions of viewers from around the world. The following year, Lee received a commendation from the Korean government for his contributions in raising the profile of Korean content globally.\n\nHe is currently in a worldwide endorsement deal with Fendi and Hugo Boss.\n\nIn 2014, Lee founded PROMIZ, a fundraising platform which raises awareness for social and humanitarian causes. The organization was awarded the first ever \"Sharing Happiness Award\" by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare for his contributions to society.\n\nLee Minho was born in Seoul, South Korea where he began his acting career.\n\nGong Ji-Chul (better known as Gong Yoo) was born in Busan, Korea on July 10, 1979. The actor is known for the movies Train to Busan (2016), Silenced (2011), Squid Game (2021), and The Age of Shadows (2016).\n\nGong Yoo graduated with a Bachelor's degree in theater at Kyung Hee University and worked as a model before entering show business as a video jockey with Mnet. Thereafter, he had several supporting roles in various Korean films and dramas before landing his first leading role with Hello My Teacher (2005) in 2005. His breakout role was with Keopi peurinseu 1-hojeom (2007), a romantic comedy drama series that was a hit with Korean drama viewers worldwide.\n\nAt the height of his career, Gong Yoo enlisted in the Korean Armed Forces in 2008 due to the mandatory military conscription. During his service, Gong did active front-line duty at the border and also served in the PR unit of the army, helming his own daily radio program at the Korean Forces Network. Upon his release from military duties, Gong Yoo's film career slowly took off with genre films such as Silenced (2011) and action-thriller The Suspect - Traue keinem (2013). Silenced (2011), a film based on the true story of child abuse and sexual assault in a special school in Korea, was a project that Gong initiated since he read the story in military. The film sparked public outrage and led to widespread demand for legislative reform to impose heavier punishments for sex crimes against minors and the disabled. The final revised bill passed was also known as the 'Dogani Law' after the Korean title of the film. Prior to his military service, Gong Yoo was known as a romantic comedy male lead, but his portrayal of the teacher in Silenced and his transformation as a buffed-up North Korean spy in The Suspect - Traue keinem (2013) established him as a more versatile actor.\n\nIn 2016, he had multiple hits with the success of zombie blockbuster Train to Busan, action-thriller The Age of Shadows and romantic fantasy drama series Sseulsseulhago Chalranhashin: Dokkaebi (2016), making him one of the most high profile South Korean actors for that year. Train to Busan was the top-grossing film in South Korea in 2016 and broke the box office record for Korean films in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. His return to television as the titular character in Goblin also broke TvN drama ratings and led the popularity index (CPI CJ Ent & Korea Nelsen) for all television platforms for weeks.\n\nWhile the actor is often seen on television commercials, he is known to be rather private with no social media accounts. In 2013, He was appointed as an ambassador by the UNICEF in correlation to the 24th year since the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) was adopted.\n\nKim Woo Bin wanted to become a model while he was in high school and didn't have much intention of becoming an actor.

After this, he and two other model turned actors from White Christmas moved on to do sitcom \"Vampire Idol\" in which he played lovable vampire Gabri Ratis who spent his life thinking he was ugly, and only upon moving to earth became interesting to girls, and women too. Sitcom was meant to have 120 episodes, but has failed to attract viewers and was abruptly ended after 79. He moves on to do \"A Gentleman's Dignity\" where he played a problematic high school kid with crush on his sociology teacher. His character was meant to be small, but as show progressed and his talent shined trough, writer Eun-sook Kim, wrote more material for him and his role grew. Similar thing happens with School 2013, where he only shows up by the end of third episode, and was meant to be supporting role, but he stole audience's hearts instantly and was given much bigger role. His acting in this drama was often described as brave, as there were many scenes of him crying with and his relationship with co-star Jong-suk Lee became infamous. Soon, He will play lead in Friend 2, sequel to Friend (2001) of which he said it's his favorite movie and he knows all the quotes by heart.

Kim Nam-gil played the homosexual character Song Jae-min in \"No Regret\". Although the film \"No Regret\" received high praise from movie critics & film festivals, it failed to boost Kim Nam-gil's popularity or lead to immediate stardom. Instead, Kim Nam-gil took more supporting roles in television dramas and commercial films. Prior to the release of the film Kang Chul-jung: Gonggongui jeog 1-1 (2008), Kim Nam-gil stopped using his stage name \"Lee Han\" and reverted back to his birth name. Nam-gil made this decision after receiving advice from Kang Woo-suk (the director of \"Public Enemy Returns\"). In 2009, Kim Nam-gil was cast in the MBC drama Queen Seon Duk (2009) as Bidam.
