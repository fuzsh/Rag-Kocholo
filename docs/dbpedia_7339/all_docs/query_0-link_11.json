It is astonishing and beautiful because of great actors, great actresses and, of course, because of brilliant and visionary directors & screenwriters. \n\nI listed 45 names here, most of them also being screenwriters. The first six listed here are among the 100 directors of all time and I think my conclusions are objective!\n\nMy basic criterion was that they must have made at least 2 great (or very good) films, and the majority of them have made even more than two.\n\nMy other lists: \n\nBest South Korean Actors (http://www.imdb.com/list/hy2h-BFGGnk/) \n\nMost Handsome South Korean Actors (http://www.imdb.com/list/O8gRVo8bRsg/) \n\nMost Prettiest South Korean Actresses (http://www.imdb.com/list/XtcZPAwVKjQ/) \n\nBest South Korean Actresses (http://www.imdb.com/list/x0sp2czpof0/)",

        "text": "Bong Joon-ho is a South Korean filmmaker. The recipient of three Academy Awards, his filmography is characterized by emphasis on social themes, genre-mixing, black humor, and sudden tone shifts. He first became known to audiences and achieved a cult following with his directorial debut film, the black comedy Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), before achieving both critical and commercial success with his subsequent films: the crime thriller Memories of Murder (2003), the monster film The Host (2006), the science fiction action film Snowpiercer (2013), and the black comedy thriller Parasite (2019), all of which are among the highest-grossing films in South Korea, with Parasite also being the highest-grossing South Korean film in history.\n\nAll of Bong's films have been South Korean productions, although both Snowpiercer and Okja (2017) are mostly in the English language. Two of his films have screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival-Okja in 2017 and Parasite in 2019; the latter earned the Palme d'Or, which was a first for a South Korean film. Parasite also became the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award nominations, with Bong winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, making Parasite the first film not in English to win Best Picture. In 2017, Bong was included on Metacritic's list of the 25 best film directors of the 21st century. In 2020, Bong was included in Time's annual list of 100 Most Influential People and Bloomberg 50.\n\nKim Ji-woon was born in Seoul, South Korea. He began his career as an actor before becoming a stage director with productions such as \"Hot Sea\" in 1994 and \"Movie, Movie\" in 1995. He then began scripting for films, his first work, 97's \"Wonderful Seasons\" won Best Screenplay award at Korea's Premier Scenario contest, whilst his follow up Die verschwiegene Familie (1998) became not only his directorial debut, but also the source material for Takashi Miike's remake The Happiness of the Katakuris (2001) in 2001.\n\nWith an official selection at the Berlin International Film Festival and Best Film award at the Fantasport Film Festival for \"A Quiet Family\", his next film, 2000's Banchikwang (2000), was an instant domestic hit, maintaining the #1 spot for over 6 months, with over 2 million admissions, it was also a worldwide festival crowd-pleaser. The short Coming Out (2000) and his contribution to Three... Nightmares (2002) (alongside segments from Peter Ho-Sun Chan and Nonzee Nimibutr) followed and then he made the 2003 horror A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).\n\nHe is a fan of film-noir and claims that many of his films contain elements of noir, often mixed with black comedy. His movie Bittersweet Life (2005) his full on film-noir gangster thriller masterwork.\n\nBorn in Changsong, Cheollanam-do, 2 May 1936. He grew up in the southern city Kwangju, where he completed senior high school. His family suffered considerable hardships and losses in the Korean War, so he had to move to Pusan in search of work: he was a labourer before trying to start a business recycling US Army boots into shoes. He moved to Seoul in 1956, where a film director Chung Chang-Hwa offered him work as a production assistant in exchange for room and board. Five years later Chung recommended him as a director, and he completed his first feature in 1962. He was a prolific director of films in various popular genres until the late 1970s but felt a deepening urge to make more serious films that first found in outlet in his 1978 film, Jokbo (1979) (Genealogy). Since 1981's Mandala (1981), he has been considered Korea's leading director. He and his films have won every possible prize in Korea's three annual film awards ceremonies, and a growing number of international festival prizes too. His film Sopyonje - Die blinde SÃ¤ngerin (1993) (is the most honoured Korean film ever made, with (to date) 27 domestic and three international prizes; it was also an enormous success in the Korean market."
