        "text": "Vigilante (비질란테)\n\nAction thriller Vigilante was all the rage in Korea when it aired in November, becoming the #1 show in the country across all OTT platforms upon its release. Based on the hit Naver webtoon of the same name, the eight-episode series stars K-drama heartthrob Nam Joo-hyuk (Start-Up, Twenty Five Twenty One) as Kim Ji-yong, a top police academy student who leads a double life as a vigilante, hunting down and punishing criminals during his free time to make up for the shortcomings of Korea’s justice system. His actions garner national media attention and widespread public support, but they also draw the ire of local police, who are intent on taking him down. Will Ji-yong ever be captured and exposed?\n\nFrom its opening scene, in which we see the life-altering tragedy that sets Ji-yong on his path, Vigilante grabs your attention and never lets go. It’s dizzyingly fast-paced, with nonstop action and suspense that’ll keep you on the edge of your seat. Just don’t forget to breathe.\n\nAvailable on Hulu in the U.S. and on Disney+ internationally\n\nMask Girl (마스크걸)\n\nAlso adapted from a popular Naver webtoon, Mask Girl became a huge hit among domestic and international audiences earlier this year, nabbing the top spot on Netflix’s Global Top 10 list of the most-watched non-English language shows shortly after its premiere. Over the course of just seven episodes, a sweeping, decades-spanning saga unfolds through the eyes of anti-heroine Kim Mo-mi (played by three different actresses, including K-drama icon Go Hyun-jung) and several other people who are connected to her.\n\nPlagued with insecurity about her looks, Kim Mo-mi is an ordinary office worker by day and a masked internet celebrity by night. But offline encounters with a couple of her fans quickly spiral out of control and lead to tragic, far-reaching consequences. Dark, gripping and offbeat with numerous shocking plot twists and reveals, Mask Girl is a cinematic masterpiece that gives off a mix of Park Chan-wook’s The Vengeance Trilogy and the K-drama Little Women vibes. The show also explores a wide array of issues that feel highly relevant today, like bullying, loneliness, hypocrisy, sexism, society’s obsession with beauty and more. Not to mention, it gives viewers a glimpse into Korean culture from the late ‘80s to the 2000s—including nods to Korean pop classics like “The Dance in the Rhythm” by Kim Wan-sun (dubbed “the Korean Madonna”) and “Saturday Night” by Son Dam-bi.\n\nAvailable on Netflix\n\nGyeongseong Creature (경성크리처)\n\nOne of 2023’s most highly anticipated K-dramas, Gyeongseong Creature is a unique hybrid of monster horror and historical drama that’s thrilling and at times brutal and heartrending. Written by Kang Eun-kyung (Bread, Love and Dreams; Gu Family Book) and directed by Chung Dong-yoon (Hot Stove League), the series takes place in Gyeongseong (present-day Seoul) in 1945, when Korea was still a Japanese colony. Wealthy pawnbroker Jang Tae-sang (played by Park Seo-joon of Itaewon Class and The Marvels) must use his connections to find the Japanese police commissioner’s missing mistress or risk losing everything he has. Detective Yoon Chae-ok (portrayed by Han So-hee from My Name and Nevertheless,) hasn’t given up searching for her long-lost mother for 10 years. When all clues point to the mysterious Ongseong Hospital, Tae-sang and Chae-ok go there to investigate, only to encounter a terrifying monster that threatens their very survival. Though Gyeongseong Creature incorporates imaginary and sci-fi elements, the show also offers a glimpse into some of the real discrimination and tragic horrors that Koreans suffered under Japanese colonial rule.\n\nPart two of Gyeongseong Creature premieres on January 5, 2024.\n\nAvailable on Netflix\n\nRevenant (악귀)\n\nThis riveting supernatural mystery horror written by renowned K-drama screenwriter Kim Eun-hee (Kingdom, Signal) and co-directed by Lee Jung-rim and Kim Jae-hong is more than just a creepy ghost story—it’s a masterclass in building a tense and eerie atmosphere while keeping things (mostly) PG for broadcast TV. Talented A-lister Kim Tae-ri (Twenty Five Twenty One, Mr. Sunshine, The Handmaiden) stars as Gu San-yeong, a young woman who becomes possessed by an evil spirit after coming in contact with a mysterious object left behind by her late father. Veteran actor Oh Jung-se (It’s Okay to Not Be Okay, Sweet Home) plays Yeom Hae-sang, a professor of Korean folklore who can see ghosts—including the one that’s latched onto San-yeong. When people connected to her begin dying, San-yeong partners with Professor Yeom to investigate the truth behind these deaths—and uncover the identity of the malignant being that’s slowly gaining control over her.\n\nThough most of Revenant’s scare factor lies in the show’s masterful use of suspense, and the ghosts themselves don’t look frightful for the most part (it was made for TV broadcaster SBS after all), the storytelling is so convincing and disturbing that you just might find yourself believing in ghosts by the series’ end.\n\nAvailable on Hulu in the U.S. and on Disney+ internationally\n\nThe Deal (거래)\n\nFresh out of the military, gambling addict Lee Joon-sung (played by former child actor and current K-drama heartthrob Yoo Seung-ho) now finds himself having to pay back the massive debt he owes. Medical student Song Jae-hyo (Kim Dong-hwi of Missing: The Other Side Season 2) is on the verge of being expelled from his school. One day the two meet up with their former high school classmate Park Min-woo (Yoo Su-bin of D.P. Season 2 and Crash Landing on You), who’s from a rich family. Desperate to pry themselves out of their dire situations, Jae-hyo and Joon-sung decide to kidnap Min-woo and hold him for ransom. But things go quickly awry as their spur-of-the-moment decision leads to unforeseen and deadly consequences. There’s a lot of action, tension and intrigue crammed into just eight episodes, and the compelling acting alone makes this webtoon-adapted series worth a watch.\n\nAvailable on Viki\n\nMoving (무빙)\n\nBased on the Kakao webtoon created by webtoon pioneer Kang Full (who also wrote the screenplay for the show), Moving generated a lot of buzz earlier this year as the most watched Korean original series on Disney+ and Hulu and also the most expensive K-drama made to date. Its all-star cast reads like the Korean equivalent of The Avengers franchise or the Ocean’s film series and includes Ryu Seung-ryong (Kingdom, Extreme Job), Han Hyo-joo (The Beauty Inside, Believer 2), Zo In-sung (Escape from Mogadishu; That Winter, the Wind Blows), Cha Tae-hyun (My Sassy Girl, Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds) and Park Hee-soon (My Name, Dr. Brain)—just to name a few.\n\nMoving follows a group of high school students who’ve inherited special abilities from their parents. The kids attempt to hide their superpowers from the world, but when it becomes clear that nefarious forces are working to target and exploit them, their parents do everything they can to protect them. Though often described as a superhero show or a spy thriller, Moving is, at its core, a story about human relationships and the sacrifices that people make for their loved ones. And while a handful of memorably gruesome scenes have landed the series on this list, it also incorporates romance, comedy, coming-of-age and a myriad of other genres—a key factor that has contributed to its global success. Viewers might find the pacing to be a bit slow in the first half of the series, but things quickly fall into place in the second half, culminating in an epic three-part finale.\n\nAvailable on Hulu in the U.S. and on Disney+ internationally.\n\nTaxi Driver (모범택시) Season 2\n\nLoosely inspired by the webtoon The Deluxe Taxi (or Red Cage) and by real-life atrocious crimes that were committed in Korea, this action-packed black comedy follows the exploits of a ragtag group of vigilantes who work for Rainbow Transport, a taxi service that not only offers rides but also carries out justice on behalf of its wronged customers. A quick flashback shows that the Rainbow team parted ways after season one, but when a father’s son goes missing in Vietnam, the gang reunites to track him down. They eventually discover that his disappearance—along with all their subsequent cases—are linked to a powerful underground crime syndicate. Set to a groovy, retro soundtrack, Taxi Driver has an equal measure of high-octane butt-kicking and quirky humor that’s sure to delight fans of Korean action comedies like The Thieves or The Roundup. The show has been such a huge success in Korea that a third season has already been confirmed—a rare feat for non-Netflix Korean series.\n\nAvailable on Viki and Kocowa\n\nBloodhounds (사냥개들)\n\nKim Gun-woo (Woo Do-hwan of The King: Eternal Monarch) is a gifted boxer who uses the prize money he’s earned from his boxing matches to help his mother keep her struggling café afloat during the pandemic. Fellow boxer Hong Woo-jin (Lee Sang-yi of My Demon and Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha) initially resents Gun-woo for his superior boxing skills, but upon finding out that Gun-woo is also an ex-Marine like him, the two become fast friends. When Gun-woo’s mother falls prey to ruthless loan shark Kim Myeong-gil (Park Sung-woong of The Killing Vote), Gun-woo and Woo-jin join forces with altruistic moneylender Choi Tae-ho (played by veteran actor Huh Joon-ho of Kingdom and Designated Survivor: 60 Days) to take down Myeong-gil and his henchmen. Widely praised for its gripping fight sequences and the incredibly chemistry between Woo Do-hwan and Lee Sang-yi, Bloodhounds—which is based on a Naver webtoon—sure knows how to pack a punch: it reached #1 on Netflix’s weekly list of most watched non-English language shows shortly after its release and stayed in the Global Top 10 for over a month.\n\nAvailable on Netflix\n\nThe Killing Vote (국민사형투표)\n\nBased on a Kakao webtoon, The Killing Vote is yet another vigilante K-drama that you’ll want to stream. In terms of gore and violence, it’s definitely one of the tamer shows on this list but makes for a heart-pounding crime thriller nonetheless. Every two weeks, a shadowy figure named Gaetal (which means “dog mask” in Korean) texts a nationwide survey to all Korean citizens over the age of 18, asking them whether a certain criminal who’s evaded adequate punishment should be put to death. If more than 50% of citizens vote for the death penalty, then Gaetal executes the criminal. Police officers Kim Moo-chan (Park Hae-jin of Man to Man and Cheese in the Trap) and Joo Hyun (Lim Ji-yeon of The Glory) race against time to stop Gaetal from claiming more victims—however despicable their past crimes may be. Full of twists and turns, The Killing Vote will keep you guessing about the masked vigilante’s true identity.\n\nAvailable on Prime Video\n\nD.P. (디피) Season 2\n\nIf you ever thought your life was hard, just thank your lucky stars you’ve never had to serve in the South Korean military (that is, assuming you’re not a Korean male citizen). And if you’re wondering what that experience is like, just watch the hit military drama D.P. When the series premiered in 2021, it became the most watched and most talked about show in Korea, where its realistic depiction of the horrors that many Korean men face while fulfilling their mandatory military service hit home unlike anywhere else. D.P. went on to win a number of domestic awards—including Best Drama at last year’s prestigious Baeksang Arts Awards—and was even voted one of the best TV shows of 2021 by The New York Times.\n\nDespite the fact that the show left a lot of Korean men reeling from PTSD, it was renewed for a second season, which launched earlier this year. Jung Hae-in and Koo Kyo-hwan reprise their respective roles as Private An Jun-ho and Corporal Han Ho-yeol, two members of the Korean military’s Deserter Pursuit (“D.P.”) unit that is responsible for tracking down and bringing back soldiers who’ve deserted. This season picks up right where season one left off, further expanding on the challenges within the Korean military that were explored in season one while also introducing other issues like LGBTQ+ discrimination.\n\nAvailable on Netflix\n\nThe Glory (더 글로리) Part 2\n\nIn this brilliant tale of vengeance penned by legendary K-drama screenwriter Kim Eun-sook (Goblin, Descendants of the Sun, Secret Garden), A-list actress Song Hye-kyo (Descendants of the Sun, Full House) plays Moon Dong-eun, a past victim of school bullying who’d suffered tremendous psychological and physical abuse at the hands of her high school classmates. Determined to get back at her former bullies for the lasting trauma they’ve caused her and for forcing her to drop out of school, Dong-eun silently hatches an elaborate plan to take them all down, one by one.\n\nThe Glory was released in two parts, with the first half launching at the end of 2022 and the latter half premiering in March of this year. The second part is where we see Dong-eun’s meticulously plotted revenge really come into full force. According to Netflix’s inaugural engagement report, The Glory was the third most watched Netflix title in the world for the first six months of 2023.\n\nAvailable on Netflix\n\nNight Has Come (밤이 되었습니다)\n\nAll of Us Are Dead meets Alice in Borderland in this teen mystery horror that is, well, absolutely bonkers. High school students on a class retreat are suddenly forced to play a game of mafia where the stakes are life and death. Those who lose or violate the rules of the game (such as by not voting when instructed to do so or by trying to escape the premises) mysteriously turn into zombie-like creatures who go berserk and kill themselves in extremely gruesome ways. Can the hapless teens figure out who the killer is—before they all die? Night Has Come is arguably the goriest and scariest show on this list, so if you’re squeamish, you’ll probably want to watch it with a friend (or two…or more). Just maybe don’t eat any food while you’re at it.\n\nAvailable on Viki"
