        "text": "I admit it, I am a big fan of Korean sageuk dramas. I have missed the days of “Dae Jang Geum” and “Queen Seon Deok”, the last great sageuks in recent memory. No other sageuk has surpassed these two, at least for me. “Empress Ki” was very promising, with a stellar cast and seemingly grand production, it was hard to resist. I was willing to go through a 51-episode journey back to the Koryo and Yuan era.\n\nThe plot is your usual inspiring story of success, of how a lowly Koryo citizen named Seung Nyang became an Empress and ruled a nation. Her parents’ death motivated her to seek power in order to exact her revenge. Also, to stop the practice of sending Koryo people as slaves to Yuan. But the road to the top is not an easy feat. She also gets caught up in a love triangle between the Koryo King and the Yuan Emperor.\n\nI honestly had a love-hate relationship with this series. Loved it for its entertaining value. It was very suspenseful until the very end. It had a star-studded cast, with Ha Ji Won (Seung Nyang/Empress Ki), Joo Jin Mo (Koryo King Wang Yoo), and Ji Chang Wook (Yuan Emperor Ta Hwan) as leads. The villains were great too, Baek Jin Hee was exceptional as Tanashiri. The costumes were beautiful, the cinematography and the locations were spectacular. Every episode was thrilling, with all the political subplots and love angles, I thought, this is one heck of a series. I was hooked. But then, I couldn’t love it for its entirety. As towards the last ten episodes, there were lots of repetitive plots and unnecessary twists.\n\nThe first half of it was so good, the best being the first episode. It was very fast paced. We were introduced to Seung Nyang’s story, why she wanted revenge in the first place. They were being sent to Yuan as slaves. The Koryo Crown Prince freed them, but her mother was killed by Yuan soldiers. She was determined to get inside the palace to find the murderer.\n\nShe cross-dressed as a boy and became a skilled archer, earning her the name the “Jackal”. She befriends Wang Yoo who wanted to meet the notorious “Jackal”. She was oblivious to the fact that he is the Crown Prince of Koryo, and he doesn’t know that she is a girl.\n\nThey formed a special friendship and together they fought corruption which earned Wang Yoo his throne as the Koryo King. Ta Hwan’s entry complicates the story, as she also befriends him, she becomes torn between them and the two nations as well. She learns her father is Commander Ki Jaho, who was later killed by El Temur because Ta Hwan implicated him for fear of his own life. This reinforced Seung Nyang’s quest for revenge.\n\n**********\n\nThe two males were complete opposites and they were rulers of enemy nations.\n\nWang Yoo is the brave one, a true leader, and an intelligent fighter, someone who is admired and loved by his people. Everything a King should be. He had a charisma that gravitated people towards him. The palace people were intrigued by his presence, including the Empress Dowager who admired him. Then Empress Tanashiri and Turk Leader, Yon Feisu even fell for him. He gained the trust and respect of unlikely people, El Temur and Bayan. He has this effect on people but he handles it with grace and humility.\n\nHe would risk his life for the greater good but he never would take credit for it. He is a pillar of strength for his people when the odds are against them, even if he was weak inside and hurting. He was a driving force to move forward in times of adversity. He brings out the best in his people that he turns beggars into warriors. He loved Seung Nyang unconditionally and cared for his people selflessly. Wang Yoo is a flawless character that made me wonder if such person could exist in real life. Up until the bitter end, he was consistent and stood by his virtues. He was willing to die so that others could live. A perfect person in an imperfect world, he was reasonable enough to take whatever life throws at him. His heroic act is truly awe-inspiring. This is why I rooted for Wang Yoo from the start because it felt right to do so.\n\nTa Hwan is a complicated character. He was weak because he grew in fear and had lots of insecurities. He’s just an Emperor on paper since he was controlled by El Temur, the same corrupt man who killed his parents. He was illiterate and was not an ideal Emperor. He lived his life as El Temur’s puppet. He hated his own life for he was surrounded by power hungry people, waiting for him to die. He was lonely and depended on Seung Nyang as his only friend. He drew his strength from her. His character was someone you would hate and pity at the same time. Seung Nyang gets entangled between the two and falls in love.\n\n**********\n\nAs the series progressed, it was hard not to root for Wang Yoo and Seung Nyang’s love, her first love. He was the person who knew her most. She sees him as her equal, but she also draws her strength from him. They had a deep connection, a shared past. Not to mention that Wang Yoo has done so much to protect her, and his people.\n\nTa Hwan on the other hand, had everything, being an Emperor of a powerful nation. Wang Yoo didn’t have much to offer, hence Seung Nyang married Ta Hwan to eventually become an Empress.\n\nTa Hwan’s character is less traditional and is reminiscent of a modern, romantic-comedy while Wang Yoo is the idealistic and romanticized one. I found Wang Yoo as more compelling and befitting for a sageuk drama and the love story between him and Seung Nyang as having more depth.\n\nSeung Nyang’s friendship with Wang Yoo grew into something deeper. Their struggles made their bond stronger and turned into love. Wang Yoo’s love for Seung Nyang is what love should be: unselfish, pure and eternal. He loved her with all he had, at the same time doing his duty as a King. He loved her no matter what cost, even if it’s his own life. How can anyone not admire that? It was a selfless love.\n\nSeung Nyang returned that love even though it was very hard for her to love him entirely because of the circumstances. It was enough proof that she accepted his proposal to be his Queen and to have Byul, her firstborn. Theirs was a star-crossed fate, a tragic but beautiful story. They say we only really love one person in our lives, and I think Wang Yoo is Seung Nyang’s greatest love.\n\nTa Hwan’s love is different, he loved her much, but it was a kind of love that is possessive. Ta Hwan was obsessed with Seung Nyang, he depended on her. She was the one who taught him to be brave, and even taught him to read. It was practical for Seung Nyang to be with him because he offers her the power that she seeks. He is an Emperor of a tyrant country. Seung Nyang unknowingly used him for her own goals. She sacrifices her love for Wang Yoo for Koryo people and for her own revenge.\n\n**********\n\nThings got more complicated when she had Byul, her firstborn with Wang Yoo. She learns that Wang Yoo married El Temur’s niece and decides to become a concubine. But she didn’t know that Wang Yoo thought she was dead and he did that for politics’ sake, to regain his throne. And by regaining his throne, he could avenge her death. But then, this issue was never settled.\n\nThe Temur clan was the primary obstacle for her goal. Tanashiri, the Empress who was jealous of her, Tanqishi, her mother’s killer, and El Temur, the Regent who had Ta Hwan as his puppet all his life. She eventually was able to topple them one by one. With the help of who else, but Wang Yoo. He was able to build allies with the Turks, and even General Bayan. Ironically, as Wang Yoo struggled to keep his throne, he was helping Yuan, his enemies. If not for his help in exposing the corruption in Eagle House, El Temur would never be executed, the primary thorn in the Yuan Emperor’s life.\n\nAfter the fall of El Temur, it was then that the scenes became repetitive and tiresome. The last leg of the series felt like it wasn’t the same story that I loved anymore. Bayan became the new regent and lobbied for his niece to be Empress. This is a duplicate of El Temur’s scheme but done for a shorter time and they suffered the same fate.\n\nTal Tal, whose uncle, Bayan, became El Temur 2.0, was caught between his relatives and despised their vile acts. Being an upright person, he knows better and refuses to taint their clan’s reputation. Bayan’s corrupted mind led Tal Tal to kill his own uncle. Hence, Tal Tal became Ki’s ally. He became the trustworthy regent, the prime minister who finally had the guts to prevent corrupt practices in the palace.\n\nThen the child plot enters, Byul (now Maha), Wang Yoo’s son, and Ayu, Ta Hwan’s son, both with Ki. Maha had an unfortunate life, being used by evil people, Tanashiri and Empress Dowager. But despite of her vileness, Tanashiri loved Maha as her own son. She was a mother to him when Ki wasn’t able to be. Ta Hwan resented him since he knows Maha is not his son. Maha is intelligent like his father, but Ta Hwan forbid him to learn, since he saw Maha as threat to his own son, Ayu. Ki must hide Maha’s identity because it will cost her “Empress” goal, since in order to be one she must be pure and also to protect the child. But one mistake that Ki did, was to entrust Maha to the wrong people. She knew that maid was Tanashiri’s right hand. This cost her son, and even Wang Yoo’s life. Her personal revenge actually did hurt more people.\n\n**********\n\nI honestly didn’t feel like rooting for Ki anymore towards the last 10 episodes. She became a cold-hearted woman, even towards Wang Yoo, the man she loved. Sometimes I felt like she’s not worthy of Wang Yoo’s love anymore. I wanted Wang Yoo to stop protecting her, but he just wouldn’t. She wasn’t even in dire need of saving, but he kept saving her in silence. She didn’t know all of Wang Yoo’s efforts since she was busy being an Empress and living her life as an Emperor’s property. I suddenly missed Seung Nyang, the Jackal. Lady Ki doesn’t have the guts that the Jackal had. She was consumed by her revenge, and even power. Becoming an Empress was almost pointless since she already avenged her father’s death with El Temur’s death. Tanqishi, her mother’s killer is still alive, but he’s nothing without his father. Bayan had a point when he said it’s just greed that’s keeping her in the throne since El Temur is gone. The other people she fought for (Lady Pak and friends), she only met them in the palace but they weren’t the main reason for her revenge. Her enemies just grew in number as her thirst for power also grew, without her knowing it. She wanted to put her son Ayu into the throne. I know that every mother wants the best for her son, but this is not the point. Her revenge is why she was there in the first place. She also wanted to help Koryo people through her position, but they failed to emphasize that part.\n\n**********\n\nNow, the WORST part, is having Ta Hwan kill Wang Yoo. That was a turning point that made me despise the end of this series. Why, of all people, would you hurt someone dear to the person you love? I would’ve preferred Wang Yoo die in a battlefield fighting for his country, not because of a girl and definitely not in the hands of a coward and selfish emperor. Such an unfair fate for someone who did so much good, much more than anyone for his own people and even others.\n\nI don’t buy Ta Hwan’s reasons, protecting Ki by burying the secret of having a love child with a man before him. I know he is an Emperor, and it’s an Emperor’s pride, too. But this is a confirmation of Ta Hwan’s insecurities. Being second only to Wang Yoo in Ki’s life was a huge blow to his ego. He used Ki’s safety to blackmail Wang Yoo but this is just an excuse. He had always wanted to kill Wang Yoo even before Maha, the reason why I couldn’t sympathize with him. He was jealous even during the time that he has no right to be. That jealousy consumed him and blinded his reasoning. He couldn’t bear living in the same sky as Wang Yoo. He envies him to death and the writers want to shove in our faces that it’s the right thing to do.\n\nThe child is dead, and Wang Yoo was leaving to Koryo for good so the secret being known is next to impossible. If he really wanted to hide the secret, then he should’ve killed each and everyone who knows, Bang, Jokho, Dokman, Hongdan, et al. Why focus only on Wang Yoo, the person least likely to speak up and endanger Ki’s life? I don’t think Ta Hwan is not aware of this fact. He is not stupid and naive at all, he knew that Ki is Wang Yoo’s weakness. He was cunning. He used this opportunity to get rid of his rival to Ki’s attention so he could have her all for himself.\n\nYou don’t kill the good people for nothing. He didn’t even spare Wang Yoo’s men who were willing to die for him. I bet he also envies Wang Yoo for having people who are willing to die in his place, because he himself couldn’t trust his men, they are all traitors. Ta Hwan didn’t realize the depth of Wang Yoo and Ki’s relationship and Ki trusts Wang Yoo more than anyone. Wang Yoo would NEVER do anything that will cause Ki harm. Protecting her is Wang Yoo’s duty, it’s in every part of his being.\n\nA great man does not deserve a senseless death. If he dies, make it an EPIC death. This totally ruined Ta Hwan’s character for me. To me, he is just Wang Yoo’s murderer. He proved that he is a coward when he used an army to kill three unarmed people. He thought that finally, he was brave enough to protect Ki by doing this vicious act. He wanted to appear like a hero for once, in Ki’s eyes, but he totally appeared evil to me, not a hero. Wang Yoo is the real HERO. He will never be half the man that Wang Yoo is.\n\nWang Yoo lived a dignified life, a King who was respected and loved. Ta Hwan will forever be remembered as the pathetic, insecure, and coward Emperor. Wang Yoo’s death gave me a more profound understanding of his love for Seung Nyang. He loved her more than his throne. Ta Hwan claimed to protect her but it was Wang Yoo who was willing to die for her. Ta Hwan did not choose to die for Seung Nyang, he was poisoned.\n\nWhat’s also wrong is that Ki still forgave the psychopath Ta Hwan despite him killing Wang Yoo for his foolish pride, despite him raping her, despite him being the cause of her father’s death. I cringed when she embraced that person who just killed the man who truly loved her. She was angry to people who killed her parents, but she forgot her anger to Ta Hwan. I said rape, yes he did force himself into Seung Nyang and she forgave him, so unbecoming of her when she always hated the practice of concubines. He got away from all his wrongdoings and Ki had to turn a blind eye because he is an Emperor.\n\nBut then, Emperor or not, it doesn’t sound right to kill for the one you love. And not just that, to kill the person who did nothing wrong but love her. Between someone willing to die for you, and the one who’s willing to kill for you, who is the better person? Who is the good and evil between them? I think Seung Nyang will forever have that guilty feeling. Imagine, someone who meant the world for you, who loved you and dedicated his life protecting you, was killed by the very person who claims to truly love you? I couldn’t imagine how Seung Nyang could ever live peacefully, how she could sleep at night, knowing someone killed another in exchange for your life. Like is your life more worthy than that person’s life? This is Ta Hwan’s way of loving Seung Nyang, get rid of the person she truly loved and let her love him, and only him. This is not what true love is. Love is selfless, and this act is nothing but selfishness.\n\nTa Hwan is also such an ungrateful person, he forgot all of Wang Yoo’s good deeds which he is forever indebted of. When he was exiled, Wang Yoo protected him in Koryo. If not for Wang Yoo, he would’ve never gotten rid of El Temur and he would’ve died earlier. Wang Yoo used El Temur’s riches to help his people during the famine. He was sitting on his throne giving orders and taking all the credit while Wang Yoo did almost everything. Wang Yoo even saved them for the last time when Tanqishi’s army attacked them. It was for his throne, but still, they were good deeds. He should even thank Wang Yoo for always protecting Ki when he already stole her from him. Ta Hwan practically took Ki away from him even though he knows that Ki loves Wang Yoo. He did not deserve such unfortunate fate.\n\nThey even tortured him for nothing, and Ki even betrayed him (in the guise of having him safe, to stop him from protecting her, but no, he wouldn’t). He lost Yon Feisu, his ally, the woman who loved him and the one worthy of his love. And how many times did they strip him off his throne? They finally gave it back, but only to kill him. They didn’t even give his people time to grieve, after all, he is still a King. He lost his throne, his son, the woman he loved and his own life. Everything that he fought for, came down to this? Why is his life so tragic?? This is not only unfair, this is injustice.\n\nTa Hwan was able to get rid of him, but what good did it do? Nothing. Yuan fell and Koryo prevailed. Wang Yoo’s death didn’t do anything good for him and his people. Why? It doesn’t guarantee Seung Nyang’s safety for she is surrounded by avaricious people. She is always in danger for having that Empress title. Wang Yoo’s death didn’t assure Ta Hwan of Seung Nyang’s love. If Wang Yoo is still King, he would’ve entered a peaceful pact with him so as not to harm Seung Nyang. Ta Hwan endangered his people’s lives by putting them into war. His obsession with Seung Nyang consumed him that he didn’t care about the people around him. He forgot to put his duty with his people first. He only cared about his own happiness. That is not becoming of a true Emperor.\n\nWang Yoo saved Ki’s life many times but she wasn’t able to save him, including her son. They were her first family and she neglected them. It was cruel that a child had to die. Maha didn’t even get to know his parents when he had the right to know. She didn’t even talk about it with Wang Yoo, so there was no proper closure for such an important issue. The way they ended Maha’s story is way too cruel. She lost her parents, her Koryo friends, the man she loved, and her firstborn. It’s not worth it to lose the people you love for revenge. Revenge won’t make anyone happy. Revenge only does you more damage than what you bargained for.\n\n**********\n\nThe last two episodes felt rushed because they added more subplots. They dragged the El Temur-Tanashiri plot so much that the latter parts were crammed, including her investiture as Empress. She became an Empress too late that they failed to establish the point of being one, and if she helped her Koryo people. They focused on the politics in Yuan too much that the story felt short in depicting Ki as a hero, as an iron lady. It should’ve been Koryo and Seung Nyang’s life as the central story. They obviously tried a last-ditch of effort to save Ta Hwan’s character, but failed to do so. Tal Tal, the only sane character left, was also killed without even a final death scene. They should’ve just let Tal Tal live but they didn’t spare him. Too many things happened in the final episode and even the Empress Dowager’s vying for a new emperor is so uncalled for. The Golta plot is very anticlimactic. Though I kinda rooted for Golta just so that Wang Yoo gets his justice, through Ta Hwan’s death. Too many betrayals, it was nauseating. It looked ridiculous as people kept spitting blood in their mouths all in one episode. It’s like they ran out of time so they killed them in one go. Tragic ending indeed.\n\n**********\n\nAs to who wins the love triangle, well, this is up to one’s point of view. She may have said those words, “I love you,” to Ta Hwan, but she had to repeat it to convince him and he already died before hearing it. It may be a confirmation of her love for him, after all, time has passed and maybe she also learned to love him. But it could be just a way to comfort Ta Hwan, who was already dying, and wanted to hear those words. I guess Ta Hwan knew deep inside that it’s still Wang Yoo she loves. If he didn’t, then why was Ki compelled to repeat those words? Maybe she had to convince herself because she’s not sure that she really loved him. Or, it maybe guilt, because somehow she used him for her own good. Ta Hwan may be an Emperor but he was surrounded by traitors, he was lonely, so he relied on Ki always. But Ta Hwan is still lucky to die in Ki’s side. His death somehow brought justice for killing Wang Yoo. Because of what he did, it wasn’t right for him to spend a lifetime with Ki. He didn’t deserve a forever with her after all that happened.\n\nFor Wang Yoo, there were no big words, but the entire fifty episodes will testify to that love. If you have seen the whole series, you would know. Actions speak louder than words. Seung Nyang never needed to tell him that because it is already obvious. It was a forbidden love, but she always had him in her heart, even in her dreams. She never told him those words, but for all the times she cried for him prove that the only person she loved is him. Wang Yoo was her first everything, her King, and her memories with him is the happiest part of her life, when things were much more simple. To her, Wang Yoo felt like home, a home that she couldn’t return to. Wang Yoo never forced her to love him, she loved him naturally like it was meant to be. Ta Hwan had to impress her and grab her from Wang Yoo. She may have loved Ta Hwan but not the way she loved Wang Yoo. She just learned to care for him later on and she had to stay with him for Ayu’s sake, so he would be Emperor.\n\nI remember Golta’s words, “Do you think Seung Nyang will love you if you have nothing, (if you’re not an Emperor)?” Seung Nyang married Ta Hwan because he was an Emperor, and she needed that power. But for Wang Yoo, he doesn’t need any title. Seung Nyang would still love him even if he had nothing. She didn’t even know he was a Crown Prince before, yet she already cared for him. She had imprinted on him from the moment she took an arrow for him. Wang Yoo could’ve been an ordinary man, a servant or a soldier, and she would still love him. That was the difference.\n\nWang Yoo didn’t need to impress Seung Nyang like Ta Hwan did. She came to him in her own will. Ta Hwan had to make every effort to steal her, separate her from him. He even had to kill Wang Yoo to have Seung Nyang all for himself. This was his way of loving her. But still, Wang Yoo’s death didn’t assure him of Seung Nyang’s love. He was still unsure until his last breath.\n\nSeung Nyang’s tears prove her love to Wang Yoo. She didn’t cry like that to Ta Hwan, even in their deaths. She wasn’t as devastated with Ta Hwan’s death as she was with Wang Yoo. She was calm and was not looking forward to another life with him. When Wang Yoo died, she cradled him in her arms and looked forward to the next life. And the next, next life. So if she will be reborn, it’s like she will choose Wang Yoo over and over again. She had regrets so she wanted to find him and start over again in the afterlife. She said, “But I will remember…in the next life…in the next life…all the graciousness that I’ve received from you. I would make the best effort to repay it.” It meant she would make up for everything in the after life. Because for the two of them, forever is not enough.\n\nSeung Nyang promised Wang Yoo to be with him until death. She never promised anything like that to Ta Hwan. Also, Seung Nyang loved Wang Yoo without asking for anything in return. He could only offer a hairpin, yet she accepted him. Ta Hwan could give her the world, yet he was begging for her love until his last breath.\n\nWhen she made love and gave herself to Wang Yoo, she did it out of love, and there was no duty involved. She offered herself to Ta Hwan out of duty, to bear a son, and to become an Empress. Wang Yoo didn’t have to rape her like Ta Hwan did. He forced himself into her. It just meant Seung Nyang doesn’t desire him as a man. Wang Yoo didn’t need to. She willingly gave herself to him as a sign of her love to him.\n\nWang Yoo treated Seung Nyang with respect. She treated her like how a woman should be treated. He never forced her to be with him just for the sake of being together. He let Seung Nyang become her own person, to reach her dreams and to achieve her own goals. Wang Yoo was everything for Seung Nyang, lover, best friend, father, and her King. She even said that if it wasn’t for Wang Yoo she will never become herself, the Empress. She wouldn’t be herself without him.\n\nWang Yoo was the center of gravity in Seung Nyang’s life, the force that pulls her together . Because of Wang Yoo, she was able to reach great heights in her life, because she draws her strength from him. Ta Hwan depended on her as his strength, so it is not clear if what she felt for Ta Hwan is just pity or companionship because no one is loyal to him, no one loved him. Wang Yoo meant everything to Seung Nyang that the moment she lost him, she lost everything.\n\n**********\n\nIn the end, I am not convinced that her becoming an Empress was worth it. I even thought that if she just stayed in Koryo, she could still avenge her parents with Wang Yoo’s help and her skills. They failed to establish her accomplishments, except in a scene where she stopped her Yuan people from bringing Koryo women as slaves. It was not enough, it was too late. It’s not clear if she really changed Yuan and Koryo for the better. They were still plagued by wars, by her own people and she had to be in Yuan’s side, not her homeland. She even had to kill the new Koryo King for her brothers’ death. So instead of a patrotic Koryo woman, we saw a vengeful woman. If only Wang Yoo did not die, Koryo would be a better place. Yes, she showed her devotion to Wang Yoo by loving her Koryo people. But she failed in keeping Koryo peaceful.\n\nSo many people died in order for her to become an Empress, including her son, and I think it was a selfish act. She was not the hero that I expected. She became a traitor that turned her back on her homeland. As Tal Tal once said, “People don’t create betrayal, the times do.” She will have to be a traitor at one point of her life. It will go on until the last of her son’s children.\n\nShe got rid of all her enemies, but she was left alone in the process. What did she achieve then? Her revenge did hurt more people. The people who loved her, and whom she also loved are gone. She avenged her son, her parents, her friends’ death, but she wasn’t able to avenge the man who loved her and saved her a thousand times. I doubt if she was happy after all that happened. She probably had regrets, but as Wang Yoo said, “Life goes on“, so she must.\n\nIn the end, there is no redeeming value for the characters. For Wang Yoo, everything that he fought for came to naught. He lost everything despite his good deeds. He lost his life for someone else’s foolish reasons, and by the hands of an unworthy opponent. Ta Hwan remained a weakling, nobody was loyal to him, and he did not change his empire for the better. And what’s worse, he died without even being sure of Seung Nyang’s feelings for him. Seung Nyang’s “Empress” goal cost her the life of the man she loved, and she will always be haunted by that guilt. She lost everything. She may have completed her revenge, but it doesn’t stop there. She will continue losing more people and she will just keep avenging them. She chose to trade a peaceful life to a life of chaos. Tal Tal’s words describe it perfectly, “The palace is a place of grandeur and death.“\n\nIf I could write the ending, it would be like this: when she fled the palace, she looked for Wang Yoo, if he was alive. And they lived a happy life forever, leaving everything behind. This is my perfect ending.\n\nThe epilogue leaves us questions as to how Seung Nyang would’ve chosen her fate. If given a second chance, would she still make the same choice? Would she still choose Ta Hwan, whose horse she rode instead of Wang Yoo’s? Given the outcome, the aftermath of her revenge and the people she lost, is that even worth a second try? If she chose Wang Yoo’s horse, she would never be the Empress Ki in history. But she would be the Queen of a small country, her homeland, ruling her own people, living a simple life with the man she loved.\n\n**********\n\nP. S.\n\nI just thought of this about the ending. The ending is not really that bad at all. I mean, depending on your mindset, you could tell that Seung Nyang chose Wang Yoo.\n\nThat is why they showed the two horses again. It was like an open ending. The whole story showed the impact of choosing Ta Hwan. What if she chose Wang Yoo’s horse instead? We know the ending is tragic. But if she chose Wang Yoo things would be different.. It would imply that she made the wrong choice. I don’t know about the others, but they would simply think that she chose Ta Hwan over Wang Yoo. But we should dig deeper into the meaning of that scene. Empress Ki is an epic drama and you don’t only watch a scene on the surface. Things tend to be deeper and more poetic in any sageuk.\n\nSeung Nyang left the palace, she escaped Yuan because of an impending war and left Ayu ruling Yuan. No one knows where she went.\n\nI think this would mean she still chooses Wang Yoo after all this time. When Ta Hwan died, she was left ruling the Yuan. If she loved Ta Hwan and was loyal to him, she should have continued Ta Hwan’s legacy. Whatever that legacy is. That’s her way of showing her devotion to him. But she didn’t. She left.\n\nSeung Nyang never did forget Wang Yoo’s legacy. She showed her devotion to Wang Yoo through Koryo and keeping his legacy. Well maybe she failed in some, like keeping Koryo peaceful, but Wang Yoo is no longer the King that time. But she didn’t do the same devotion to Ta Hwan. She abandoned Ta Hwan’s Yuan to save herself. She wasn’t willing to give her life to Yuan people, Ta Hwan’s people. Maybe, she made Ayu do it, but Ayu is Ta Hwan’s son in the first place.\n\nIt was still Koryo deep inside her. And by leaving Yuan she chose Koryo, and by choosing her homeland, it means choosing her King, and that is Wang Yoo."
