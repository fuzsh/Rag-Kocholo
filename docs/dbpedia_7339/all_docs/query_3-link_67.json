        "text": "Hwang, Jong-Hee (Acted by Hwang, Sin-Hae)\n\n\"I pin all my hopes on love!\" Born in a wealthy family, she has never in her life worried about money troubles. What's even more, she was gifted with a perfectly pretty face and has lived all her life like a princess ever since. At the age of 36, when she marries her brother's handsome friend who is 5 years younger, the world seems ever so brighter and perfect. On the wedding day, she definitely felt her friends' envious eyes and thought \"God, am I lucky~!\" But, was she really...? Now a successful director at a home shopping channel but with an incompetent husband at home, she slowly gets used to the harsh reality. She stopped going to beauty salon for make-over and now does her hair herself. In the end, her\n\nbeauty also declines and her husband now begins to turn away from her. One day, he comes home with a bouquet of roses and long hair belonging to a unidentified woman. And a mobile SMS message that says, \"You must be tired of living with that old lady. You know I love you, honey...\" She sits in front of the mirror. \"Huh, I still look great! How dare you have an affair when a woman like me is here?\" Her transformation and new make-over begin... Kim, Seok-Goo (Acted by Ahn, Jae-Wook)\n\nBorn in a ordinary middle class family, he manages to graduate from university and somehow gets to work at a bank. However, unable to hide his playboy nature and his good looks, he goes on leading a life of an out-and-out libertine. His life did not seem to change a bit until he met the daughter of his VIP client, who was also the elder sister of his friend. She is rich and gorgeous! Overflowing with smiles, she seems like the perfect person who will now make his life happy. And this woman says she will marry him! But now that he's married to her, he is miserable. That gorgeous woman who he thought would never change is now just an ordinary woman. Besides, slowly now he's getting tired of his mother-like wife\n\n\"I need a young and cute girl.\" His secret affair begins...\n\nHwang, Jong-Hyeok (Acted by Kwon, Oh-Joong)\n\nI have fun teasing my sister-in-law. He is a brother of Jong-Hee, and just started business with Seok-Goo for a game company. Also, he is an energetic old bachelor. He often run after women, and wastes his money on useless things. He doesn't want to lose his freedom and hobby. His ideal type is a pure and glamour girl, so his friends consider him as a hopeless guy. He is always interested in his sister and sister-in-low, and he makes himself a fun through teasing his sister-in-low. Meanwhile, he found that Seol-Goo has been unfaithful."
