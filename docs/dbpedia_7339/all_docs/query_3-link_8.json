        "text": "Here comes the second part of my hallyu series! (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)\n\nI was initially inspired by Flavia who shared 10 K-dramas on her to-watch list and Savannah who listed her favorite K-pop music video. I always want to write a post on some of my hallyu favorites, but I don‚Äôt know how many people are interested in reading it. When I mentioned it on the wrap up, Andreea and Ruzaika expressed their interest, and so here it is!\n\nAs summer is approaching and I have no plans for this summer, I practically have 2.5 months of free time. While I‚Äôm bummed that I didn‚Äôt get any internship, at least I got some time down to recharge myself after this weird school year. And one of my goal this summer is also to learn a new language, so I figure I would watch a lot of k-dramas. I find listening to music and watching stuffs helped me in learning a new language and while I know I wouldn‚Äôt be an expert by the end of the summer, at least I could understand basic stuff üå∏\n\nI‚Äôve talked quite long, let‚Äôs find out what I have on my list!\n\nPreviously on the series:\n\nPart 1: My favorite K-drama\n\nReply 1988\n\nWhat is this about: Set in the year 1988, it revolves around five friends and their families living in the same neighborhood of Ssangmun-dong, Dobong District, Northern Seoul.\n\nWhy I want to watch it: I already watched the first episode‚Ä¶ and cried 4 times. I think it kinda traumatizes me but at the same time, make me want to watch it! I think this is the third one in Reply 1988 series? I watched this one because a) Park Bo-gum and b) apparently this is the best and highest rated out of all Reply series, because of its focus on family really resonates with people.\n\nCan‚Äôt wait to have my heart ripped out with the rest of the series.\n\nWhile You Were Sleeping\n\nWhat is this about: Hong-joo (Bae Suzy) lives with her mother and helps her run a pork restaurant. Hong-joo is haunted by seeing the future deaths of others in her dreams. What‚Äôs worse is that she does not know when the deaths will happen, but she tries to stop her dreams from becoming reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Jae-chan (Lee Jong-suk) is a rookie prosecutor. He meets Yoo-bum (Lee Sang-yeob) at the prosecutors‚Äô office. Yoo-bum was Jae-chan‚Äôs private tutor when Jae-chan was in his adolescence, but an unfortunate incident caused Jae-chan to dislike him. Yoo-bum was a prosecutor, but he now works as a lawyer. He takes on any case that brings him money.\n\nJae-chan and his younger brother move to new house and they become neighbors with Hong-joo. One night, Jae-chan dreams that Yoo-bum drives Hong-joo‚Äôs car and this leads to a chain of events including the death of Hong-joo‚Äôs mother and then Hong-joo. When Jae-chan senses that his dream is about to become real, he takes extreme actions to stop it. Yoo-bum becomes furious at Jae-chan, but Hong-joo hugs him and thanks him. In the aftermath of the incident, Jae-chan and Hong-joo cross paths and work together to solve other cases.\n\nWhy I want to watch it: I‚Äôm actually halfway through already and planned to finish it this month before finals. However, life has its own course and curveballs and I ended up being VERY busy this month, even busier than last month. With finals looming in the corner, I think I‚Äôll save it for the summer and I‚Äôll try to finish it in the first week of the holidays. The trailer is just sooo pretty, and it‚Äôs been a while since I watch any LJS dramas. I love his acting but as I watch this, I find myself liking Jung Hae-in more, he‚Äôs so cute! üòç\n\nThe King 2 Hearts\n\nWhat is this about: Set in an alternate reality, modern-day South Korea is governed by a constitutional monarchy descended from the Joseon Dynasty. Lee Jae-ha (Lee Seung-gi) is a handsome yet materialistic crown prince who doesn‚Äôt care about politics and feels total reluctance to being the second in line to the throne. Lee Jae-kang (Lee Sung-min), the current king, tricks him into joining a joint military collaboration with North Korea as a means to help ‚Äúmake him grow up.‚Äù\n\nMeanwhile, Kim Hang-ah (Ha Ji-won) is a North Korean Special Forces Officer who is also the daughter of a North Korean military high command official. Both Jae-ha and Hang-ah meet at the joint military training, a crucial part in establishing friendly relations between the two separate countries. Although the two are initially antagonistic towards each other, Jae-ha unwittingly sparks a friendship with Hang-ah and he subsequently falls in love with her. Soon, an arranged marriage is set up between the two and they eventually become engaged. While they attempt to set their differences aside and build a growing relationship, things suddenly take a turn for the worse when King Jae-kang and his wife are assassinated by the devious and notorious terrorist group, Club M, led by John Mayer/Kim Bong-gu (Yoon Je-moon), a mysterious magician who is obsessed with eliminating the royal family and plans to rule in their stead. Now crowned the new King of South Korea, Jae-ha must learn to be responsible and protect the country before it is too late.\n\nWhy I want to watch this: One of those ‚Äúold k-dramas‚Äù and it has everything I wanted from a K-drama: spoiled chaebol being more human in the end, starcrossed romance, royalty, spies, hate to love relationship, and political intrigue! It‚Äôs like an all-in-one package.\n\nI have a feeling this one will be a new favorite of mine.\n\nEmpress Ki\n\nWhat is this about: The series revolves around Gi Seungnyang, a Goryeo-born woman who ascends to power despite the restrictions of the era‚Äôs class system, and later marries Toghon Tem√ºr (Emperor of Mongol Empire) to become an empress of the Yuan dynasty, instead of her first love, Wang Yu. It managed to highlight the deep love the Emperor embedded in Lady Ki and depicts her loves and political ambitions.\n\nWhy I want to watch this: It‚Äôs been a while since I watch a sageuk, and this one is pretty hyped up during its era. It‚Äôs set during the Goryeo era and I always love stories about women who fought to became queen. What makes this show even more interesting is because the queen is from Korea but she fights for Mongol throne. I have a feeling that this one will be a new favorite of mine too, especially since the costume are GORGEOUS.\n\nThat Winter, The Wind Blows\n\nWhat is this about: A melodrama about a man and a blind woman, who don‚Äôt believe in love. Oh Soo is an orphan who is left heartbroken after his first love dies. He leads a goal-less life as a high-stakes gambler with a 99.9% winning probablity. Oh Young is a lonely heiress who lives alone, after her parents got divorced and she finds herself becoming visually impaired. The two learn the true meaning of love after meeting each other.\n\nWhy I want to watch this: Another old drama, this time starring Song Hye Kyo and Jo In Sung. I think I watched a few episodes when it first aired but I was a kid back then so I wasn‚Äôt deeply interested and sort of forget about it. It may not clear from the synopsis, but it involves a pretend relationship since Oh Young poses as Oh Soo‚Äôs brother to get her money, before he fell in love with her. Imagine the pain and angst and tears I will shed!! ‚âß‚óâ‚ó°‚óâ‚â¶\n\nBased on the list, I‚Äôll most definitely watch While You Were Sleeping first, before moving on to The King 2 Hearts. I also will watch Empress Ki at the same time, since it‚Äôs 50 episodes (while the others are 16-20 episodes). I‚Äôll save That Winter along with Reply 1988, so I can ~embrace the sadness~. Andd, if I managed to finish them all before summer ends, I might start Scarlet Heart or Princess Hours. It‚Äôs about time I rewatch the latter, writing last week‚Äôs post really gave me the urge to rewatch!\n\nAnd that‚Äôs all for today! Do you have any plans for the summer? Tell me some of K-dramas on your to-watch list!"
