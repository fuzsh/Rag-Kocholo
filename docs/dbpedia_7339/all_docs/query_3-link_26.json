He wants a blueberry cheesecake.\"\n\nHe groaned. He face palm and looked at his watch.\n\n\"Son. It 2:35am.. where's daddy gonna find a blueberry cheesecake at this hour?\" He said to my big belly.\n\n\"That's not our problem. He's doing summersaults again! Help me!\" I whined.\n\nMy husband laughed. \"Araseo.\" He kissed my forehead and stood up.\n\n\"He's not yet born and he's already spoiled.\"\n\n------------------\n\n\"Yeobo?\"\n\nI looked up from the newspaper I was reading and looked at my wife, who has that sad puppy look in her face.\n\n\"I'm fat.\" She pouted. I can't help but laugh.\n\n\"Yeobo... you're 7 months pregnat.\"\n\n\"So? I'm still fat.\"\n\n\"You don't look fat. You're fine.\"\n\n\"Fine? That's it? I'm fine?\"\n\n*Uh oh...*\n\n\"Baby you're beautiful. Always are. Always will be.. \" I stood up and walked to her.\n\nI kissed her baby bump.\n\n\"What about me?\" She pouted more.\n\nI laughed harder.\n\n\"I love you..\" I said as I kissed her forehead.\n\n\"I love you too..\"\n\n------------------------------\n\n\"Yeobo!!!\"\n\nI heard my wife screamed. I ran out of the shower still with shampoo in my hair.\n\n\"What's wrong?!\"\n\n\"It's time..\" she said softly.\n\n\"Huh?\" I looked down her belly and then the puddle between her feet.\n\n\"Did your water...... just broke?\"\n\nShe nod.\n\nPanic took over! I grabbed the bag we set aside for this situation. I grabbed her coat and shoes.\n\nI then grabbed my wife's hand and we started to the door.\n\n\"Yeobo!!\"\n\n\"What?!\"\n\n\"Can you please put some pants on first?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" I looked down my naked body in shocked. My hair still covered with shampoo.\n\n\"Oopps... sorry. Be right back.\"\n\n-------------------------\n\n\"I will never ever let you touch me again!\" I screamed at his face. The pain! It's killing me!\n\n\"Araseo...\" my husband said soothingly as he kissed my forehead.\n\n\"Yah! Don't kiss me! That's what started all of this! You're sleeping outside the house from now on! Do you understand!? Aaarrggghhhh!!\"\n\n\"Doctor! Do something! \" my husband yelled at the doctor.\n\n\"It's to late for any medicines. You're already crowning.\"\n\n\"Give me drugs! Do you hear me?! I'm not letting this baby go without any drugs! I'm not going to push!! I'm in so much pain! Drugs! I need anything! Give me anything!!!\"\n\n\"Mrs Song all you need now is to push. You're almost there.\"\n\n\"Nooo.... I need some drugs! NOW!!!\"\n\n\"Aw.. aw... Yeobo.. you're breaking my hand!\"\n\n\"This is all your fault!!\"\n\n\"I can see his head! One more push Mrs Song.\"\n\n\"I can't...\"\n\n\"Yeobo.... one more. He's almost here..\"\n\nI gave it all when I pushed for the last time. I thought my lungs will explode.\n\nThen I heard him cry.. I hear my baby cry..\n\n\"Here you are Mrs Song... you're beautiful baby boy\" the nurse said as she handed ne a blur blanket.\n\n\"My son...\" I can't help but cry.\n\n\"Our son..\" Seung-Heon said, he was also crying.\n\n\"Araseo... he can be you're son too..\" I teased my husband.\n\n\"Yah...\" he laughed softly and kissed our heads.\n\n\"You did great Yeobo... \" he whispered.\n\n\"We did great...\" I said, looking at our baby."
