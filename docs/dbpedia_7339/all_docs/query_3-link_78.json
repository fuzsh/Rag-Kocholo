        "text": "2023 – A Hit & Miss Year for Korean Dramas\n\nThere were so many shows that SHOULD have been incredible this year but just kinda let me down. But let’s not be all doom and gloom, there were definitely some stand outs and new favorites, too. If I thought it was worth watching, I’ll slap a pic with it… so if you just wanna find some recommendations it should be a quick scroll. Listed alphabetically for your convenience.\n\nArthdal Chronicles: The Sword of Aramun – 9.5/10\n\nArthdal Chronicles went out with a bang. After waiting FOREVER for this second season, getting used to several major cast members replacements, and then trying to figure out where to actually watch this thing in the USA… I am pleased to announce it was worth all the hassle. It’s just a cool story, ya’ll. It’s epic in scope and concept, in costuming and set designs, and character development and plotline. It did not get a 10/10 because Kim Sung-cheol was my favorite character, Ipsang, in season 1 (so much so that I wrote an entire post about him) and his replacement Lee Hae Woon, though good, could not really compare. My other minor complaint was the chemistry was lacking between the ML & FL in this second installment…. who were perfect for their roles in the show but maybe not so perfect together. But otherwise, the cast replacements totally held up to the standard set by Season 1.\n\nBehind Your Touch – 4/10 – I mean… it’s about a woman who accesses her psychic abilities by touching people’s butts. If they’d leaned hard into the comedy of that, it might have been great… but it tried to be a drama, a romance, and even a murder mystery. Ridiculous.\n\nBlack Knight (Netflix) – 5/10 – I don’t know why they bother to gather all this Korean talent if they’re just gonna churn out basic “American Style” garbage science fiction.\n\nBloodhounds (Netflix) – 6/10 – I love a good bromance but… what were they doing with Woo Do-Hwan’s character? I did not understand if he was supposed to be just… stupid… or mentally challenged… or… I dunno. He was so off putting with his weird child-like character mixed with so much physical violence.\n\nCastaway Diva – 6/10 – Okay, sure I am a sucker for childhood trauma stories but mixing that topic with this super cheesy idol story was just awkward.\n\nCelebrity (Netflix) – 8/10 – Trash. Glittery, devious, guilty pleasure trash.\n\nCelebrity is a totally over the top mystery, revenge thriller that had me in its manicured clutches from the first episode until the last. I had a ball watching every episode. Don’t think about it too much, don’t pull at the delicate stitching on the designer gown or the entire plot might unravel in an instant. Just turn off your brain and enjoy the glitzy drama of bitchy girls and rich assholes. This show is the definition of guilty pleasure from beginning to end and I would recommend this for fans of trash… like Penthouse.\n\nCrash Course in Romance – 8/10 – I liked this one.\n\nCrash Course in Romance had K-drama from the 2012-2016 vibes, including all the annoying tropes that I’m not sure work as well in 2023, but it made me happy and nostalgic watching this show so I’m definitely tossing it into the recommendation pile. I’m not sure I will ever understand the competitive nature of college entry in South Korea, and I will certainly never be able to wrap my head around math… but it was cool to learn about these study schools and watch this struggling lady strive to ensure the best possible future for her teenager. The romance between the celebrity math tutor (I know, right? what a weird world) and this hardworking middle aged lady made me kick my feet in the air it was so cute and stupidly adorable. What can I say… late to love stories work for me.\n\nD.P. Season 2 – 9/10 – Feel like being emotionally wrecked and sad for a few hours? This is your show. Guess they don’t have to worry about it hurting their recruitment stats as enlistment is mandatory in South Korea. This season hurt more than the first one.\n\nThe Deal (Korean Drama) – 6/10 – I love this type of plot, but unfortunately they did nothing to expand upon this well-worn territory. Not to mention the incredibly shallow character development of the three main guys. I felt nothing for any of them, or their problems, it had the emotional weight of a commercial. Did an AI generator write this script or what?\n\nDoona! (Netflix) – 6/10 – One day I will be able to put my finger on why I hated this drama so much. Maybe I hated it more because I really wanted to like it more. That will be a reoccurring theme this year.\n\nThe Eighth Sense – 10/10 – Gorgeous, emotional, romantic, and concise.\n\nThe Eighth Sense was a gay romance that tackled a lot of themes – first loves, familial pressures, survivors guilt, and the various complexities of friendships. The cinematography was stunning – capturing all the flickering emotions on the two main lead’s faces. It felt like falling in love, watching this show.\n\nEvillive – 7/10 – if you’re gonna queer bait us to this extent, just be queer. Especially if you can’t fix the plot up enough to be great without the ambiguous gay angle. Ultimately a let down, this had a lot of potential and the dynamics between the leads was very enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe Glory – 10/10 – HOLY SHEEPLE. This show, ya’ll!\n\nThe Glory wrapped up in 2023 with a deeply satisfying conclusion. I was horrified, traumatized, and totally hooked by this show. Watching a woman’s steely resolve to destroy the lives of the monstrous people who had destroyed her own life was addictive. I usually don’t like Song Hye-kyo because I don’t think she’s very good at portraying emotions – her best roles are when she’s cast as these cold, closed off ladies who don’t want to let anyone near their fortified hearts – so she worked perfectly for the lead in this show. One of the best revenge dramas I have ever seen.\n\nThe Good Bad Mother – 7/10 – I do not understand the hype over this show. And I adore the leading male, he’s one of my favorites. Even so… I just did not enjoy this show. I struggled to finish it.\n\nGyeongseong Creature – 6/10 – Another disaster. A shoddy patched up mess of a monster movie that really had no right being as bad as it was. The elements were there, but whoever was in the kitchen just did not know what to do to create the masterpiece that this show should have been. A-List actors came across as flat with one dimensional characters. Just… not good. Sorry, ya’ll.\n\nHeartbeat (Korean Drama) – 6/10 – Vampire comedy writes itself, so I was looking forward to some giggles with a South Korean slant. But nope. The comedy is stale. The chemistry between the leads is non-existent. The story line was promising but ended up being a huge waste of my time. Deeply disappointed. Don’t bother to stake it, this one was dead on arrival.\n\nThe Heavenly Idol – 3/10 – I don’t even know what to say about this hot mess of a show. I am giving it a 3 because I had a blast making fun of it… so much so that it was totally worth watching. It’s like if Pureflix made a K-Drama… but with a weird mix of mythology. This is another one where if they had just leaned into the camp – it could have been a hit. Just be silly and over the top, don’t try to reign in your nonsense show with moral messages and unnecessary elements. Know what you are.\n\nThe Killing Vote – 9.5/10 – Preposterous. And super fun. I loved this show.\n\nThe Killing Vote had a Devil Judge vibe to it, with the same societal distrust in the justice system and a self-righteous man pretending to empower the people when really he’s got his own personal agenda. This show was a blast each week and I was won over by the young secondary couple who were swept into the madness due to their familial connections. This is what I mean when I say a show should know what it is. It won’t be for everyone, but I am particularly fond of over-the-top social justice type stories.\n\nKing the Land – 5/10 – The most boring, cliched story elements tossed together and yet people seemed to like this mess? Do they not realize there are literally a million better dramas about a dickish-rich guy slowly figuring out that… uh… most people have to work for a living and do shit they don’t wanna do in order to eat? And some nice, capable lady comes along and sorta-kinda helps him be a slightly better person without actually making any significant changes to his wealth, status, or company. I mean, just cause you stick two attractive people together does not mean the show has any merit. I didn’t even bother to finish this one.\n\nKokdu: Season of Deity – 6/10 – Okay, you are probably wondering how I could give this turd of a show a 6… and that’s fair. But at least it tried to go camp. It attempted to be silly and stupid and have a good time with its nonsense story. It reminded me a lot of A Korean Odyssey, actually, which was also a mess but had a good time being terrible. Unfortunately, the silliness just didn’t pan out as well with this show. The leads had no chemistry at all (just like A Korean Odyssey, actually!) and the FL did not have the comedy chops to play off the zany romance (also just like A Korean Odyssey, actually!). Kim Jung Hyun is so good at comedy, I really hope they keep casting him as these insane wacky characters – but you know, next time make sure it’s a good show first and be sure you hire one of our comedy queens to hold up the rom-com dynamics.\n\nMiraculous Brothers – 8/10 – I wish I had watched this all at once – but when I started it only 11 episodes were out… and I was totally drawn into the story of stolen books, unsolved murders, and a time traveling magical boy. Then I kinda forgot about it… and when I finally finished it up, it didn’t have the same appeal anymore because I’d crammed too many other dramas in my head inbetween. I still think this drama was totally unique – and I enjoyed the odd bitter friendship between the time traveler and the book thief. It’s unique. And definitely worth watching. But learn from me – watch it all at once.\n\nMoon In The Day – 8/10 ESTIMATED – I haven’t finished this one yet, but I’m enjoying the melodrama of it. I doubt my rating will go up with the end… if anything, it might go down… but I’ll collect my thoughts on this once I’ve seen the whole thing.\n\nMoving (Korean Drama) – 7/10 – It started out so good, too! But this show wanted to make every character the MAIN CHARACTER – and there were just too many characters running around to pull this off. Entire episodes dedicated to one character’s plotline or backstory, leaving the other characters completely out of the mix. I could barely remember the kids by the time we came back to them. It was so frustrating. And it’s not that I didn’t like the backstories and side characters – it’s just that every writer has to chose their leads. The side characters can rock, can have amazing stories, but they should not overshadow the leads. And if you’re gonna be an ensemble story, you gotta share screen time with some consistency and “track” with everyone. What a waste.\n\nMy Dearest (Korean Drama) – 9/10 – And here we have Gone with the Wind, Korean-style.\n\nMy Dearest was a ride. It’s set during the Qing invasion of Joseon, so, you know, times were tough. Slavery. Hostages. Girls being shipped off to foreign lands as “tributes” and whatnot. And in all this turmoil, we have the sassy, brash lead female Gil Chae (played to perfection by Ahn Eun Jin) trying to win over the heart of a dude who’s clearly in love with someone else. Enter the suave, player Jang Hyun (again, played to perfection by Namgoong Min) who has sworn off marriage but becomes infatuated with the beautiful, spirited Gil Chae. If you’ve seen or read Gone with the Wind, then… just… imagine it. Just like Gone with the Wind, this story is more sorrow, heartbreak, and hard times than anything else – but at its core it’s a fiery romance about two strong willed people trying to figure out their feelings. Loved it.\n\nMy Demon – still watching… it’s kinda dumb but I’m enjoying it anyways.\n\nMy Lovely Liar – 7/10 – The concept was fun. I hate to say it, but I don’t think the Leading Male is much of an actor. I should have realized Hwang Minhyun is an idol. Hidden Side is a gem of a song, though! This show, however, is not very impressive. I enjoyed the concept, and I love the Leading Female, Kim So-hyun… so I watched it all… but there are so many better shows with a light supernatural twist that are far superior. If you’re just looking for something light and cute, this is a solid choice, I guess, but it’s hard to get excited about it.\n\nNot Others – 9/10 – Applause to the non-traditional story line, characters, and vibe of this show.\n\nNot Others found a way to turn a basic rom-com into an unexpected treat by shifting up the traditional starting point. Who knew a story about a grown woman happily living with her single mom would be so freakin’ good? I really loved both these gals – and their respective love interests, who were perfect compliments to their personalities. Besides the dynamics of the two women figuring out if they know how to separate their lives, there were some good mysteries and crimes to keep us excited. It was so nice to see something different.\n\nPerfect Marriage Revenge – 8/10 – This is my brand of nonsense, but it also felt kinda deflated.\n\nPerfect Marriage Revenge… what can I say… the concept was fun, the couple had great chemistry, but I just didn’t particularly like either of them. I didn’t find them interesting, charming, or unique. And if you’re gonna give me such vanilla leads, then you better make the Evil Queen larger than life… and again, it just didn’t quite reach peak evil in my opinion. Though there were moments when the dialogue was there, it just didn’t feel earned. However – the step-sister was stellar – and I thought her crazed desperation was absolutely the show stealing performance in this drama. Whenever I considered turning it off, she would show up and revive my attention with her theatrics. So, yeah… watch it for the irredeemable evil step-sister.\n\nRevenant (Korean Drama) – 10/10 – Helllooooooo horror drama!\n\nRevenant creeped me out. I have enough religious upbringing to be utterly compelled and horrified by the idea of demonic possession. Unlike your Western possession story, this one did not involve priests slinging holy water. Revenant treated us to traditional Korean mythology and folk customs. To the tantalizing and horrifying aspects of working with the dark arts to gain power. I was on the edge of my seat each week watching a young woman’s life fall apart after she inherits her estranged father’s eerie legacy (Kim Tae Ri is really one of the best actresses out there). I especially loved the non-romance in this story… as there was definitely something there between our possessed girl and the cop who was drawn to her, but also… not quite. Add to that the unusual relationship she had with the academic who was helping her and the whole thing was just a non-stop exploration of uncharted territories. If you wanna be unnerved – this is your show.\n\nSong of the Bandits – 6/10 – Great actors, great sets, great costumes… and yet, I was not at all drawn into this story and basically had to force myself to finish it. And this is a short show, too. If it weren’t for Lee Ho-Jung turning me on every time she sauntered into a saloon with her blood soaked hands, I don’t think I would have bothered. But dang, girl! Why weren’t you the main character???\n\nThe Story Of Park’s Marriage Contract – 7/10 – It’s corny and cute. I’m still watching it but feel like this is a safe bet of a mid-show.\n\nStrong Girl Nam-Soon – 4/10 – I was one of the people who asked for this. I wrote an entire review praising the first show and begging for a spin off series to show off other “strong women” with the family genes. Listen, you gotta be careful what you wish for. This is like one of those old parables where the devil starts cackling immediately after you sign away your soul and says “You forgot to say you wanted the spin off series to be worth watching!” And I just stand there, defeated, knowing that’s true. At least we got sexy reels of the bad guy all over our socials. Silver lining, eh?\n\nSweet Home 2 – 7/10 – To say I was disappointed in Season 2 is the understatement of the year. This season felt so disjointed – whose story was this? I’ve rewatched Season 1 about a half dozen times over the past two years, and it remains a stand out in K-Dramas as well as proof that Netflix can help fund some truly wild and creative projects. This season, however, will probably just remain the necessary bridge between Season 1 and Season 3. What can I say, I still have hopes they can salvage this mess for the finale… save us, Lee Do-hyun!\n\nTaxi Driver 2 – 5/10 – We did not need a Taxi Driver Season 2. I know most of ya’ll wanted it, but it was absolutely unnecessary. This season was repetitive, boring, and uninspired. Though I will give it snaps for introducing me to that amazing Dragon Bridge that goes over the River Hàn at Da Nang, Vietnam. Did ya’ll know that thing actually breathes fire??? It also spits out a fountain of water, too, depending on the holiday. Seriously – type in Dragon Bridge Vietnam in a search engine. It’s far more interesting than anything that happened in this lame season.\n\nTwinkling Watermelon – 8/10 – You know when you drink a slushie too fast and get brain freeze? But you keep drinking it anyways cause it’s delicious?\n\nTwinkling Watermelon was a surprise hit for me. Okay, hear me out here (no pun intended). There is a cuteness saturation point and I think this drama definitely was soaking in the sugar-sweetness tooo toooo toooooo long. But maybe it’s because I listen to so much K-Pop that I did not mind this sickeningly sweet teen drama about a time traveling boy who jumps back in time and befriends his own father – and tries to set him up with his future mom. Sometimes you just want to jam out to STAYC, okay? There’s no shame in loving adorable and super-sweet-cutesy things, including this show. Everyone was absolutely lovable and charming in this drama, but it’s the two male leads that will steal your heart. Their cute friendship with the unusual dynamics of being secretly father/son was the colorful icing on the cake.\n\nVigilante (Korean Drama) – 7/10 – This was on the border of being a hit. It was so close! It had such potential! It had all the the ingredients, too. Anger at the failure of the justice system. A burning need for revenge. Masterful secret plans to root out evil above (or below) the law. Great actors. But it didn’t quite congeal, ya dig? I think this one needed to bake a little bit longer. It was still gooey in the center. Give the writers time to iron out the kinks, please. Maybe add a few more episodes if you need to and if that’s not possible then cut out some of the plot points so it works better.\n\nThe Worst Of Evil – 7/10 – This is another show that needed a little more work in the writer’s room. This is a story about a married couple, both police officers, except the wife keeps getting promoted but the hubbie is struggling to move up in the field. He takes on an undercover assignment to infiltrate a local gang and becomes friends with the leader only to discover his new bestie is still harboring a crush on his first love… who just happens to be the cop’s wife. I mean, WUT!? I love this more than words!!! I wanted 2 things from this show: MORE of that delicious complicated love triangle with MORE drama, emotions, and insane consequences cause… that’s the most over-dramatic ridiculous melodrama recipe ever! And I wanted MORE of the friendship/bromance between the cop and the gangster. They should have made this show longer so we could have those two things more – and this could have been the 10/10 show of the year. The Worst of Evil brought us SUPER WOOK back, for God’s sake – Ji Chang-wook is too good at action not to be making more of these types of shows. And we got to see Wi Ha-joon kiss a woman? Finally! But since they didn’t play up the love triangle it felt kinda awkward and strange. Sigh. What a disappointment. If you’re a fan of gangster shows, though, I would still recommend this one.\n\n2022 Reviews… but really just KinnPorsche.\n\nSo, I’ve watched quite a few Korean dramas over the last few months but none of them made me immediately run to the keyboard to write a review. There’s a few that I’ve been stewing over and will probably cover in more depth… but for now… a quick summary:\n\nAll of Use Are Dead – Rating: 10/10. Unexpectedly amazing.\n\nMoney Heist: Korea – Rating: 8/10. Good but was annoyed it wasn’t a complete series.\n\nRomance is a Bonus Book – Rating: 9/10. How did I miss this gem of a show for so long? Classically good K-drama.\n\nTomorrow – Rating: DNF. I wanted to like it… but it was just so dull.\n\nTwenty-Five Twenty-One – Rating: 8/10. Loved the first half… then it meandered a bit… then lost me at the end.\n\nBusiness Proposal – Rating: 7/10. Cute. Nothing new.\n\nOur Beloved Summer – Rating: 8.5/10. Excellent, a bit like an indie romance, could have been stronger but still a strong tea of a romance.\n\nOur Blues – Rating: DNF. I might get around to finishing it this summer… possibly.\n\nMy Liberation Diary – Rating: 8/10. Not quite as good My Mister but definitely wanted to compete… a depressing examination of the disillusionment of adulthood and floundering through life.\n\nThe Sound of Magic – Rating: DNF. I should have watched the trailer cause I was not vibing with a musical.\n\nJuvenile Justice – Rating: DNF. Meh. I like the premise but wasn’t sold on the execution of this story.\n\nCurrently, I’m watching Alchemy of Souls (meh) and Tale of the Nine-Tailed (also meh). But really, there’s only one show from Asia that is truly captivating the web. I mean… is there any other show even on right now? Cause all I see on my socials is a billion gif sets and memes and giddy gushing of fans who are obsessed – OBSESSED, I tell you – with the Thai BL drama KinnPorsche.\n\nSo… KinnPorsche review coming soon! The final episode aired yesterday and I am still high as a kite on the endorphins. Rarely has my fangirling heart been so richly rewarded by a show.\n\nUPDATE: FULL INSANELY LONG & CRAZY REVIEW OF KINNPORSCHE NOW AVAILABLE! Read Review.\n\nWhat are you all watching this summer?\n\nReview – Bulgasal: Immortal Souls\n\nI mean… can you resist this goth aesthetic???\n\nThere’s gonna be a lot of gifs and images in this review… so if you’re internet is slow, give it a minute to load up cause… lights camera action.\n\nAh, Bulgasal! I’ve been sitting on this review a while because this is a tricky show to discuss. Like many other poor fools out there, I watched this drama as it was airing. And in a strange way, that contributed to my love/hate relationship with this fantasy. Cause I should have hated it. I shouldn’t really recommend it to anyone in good faith. But I had such a blast watching this show!\n\nI was soaked in the fandom, giddy with anticipation as the mystery unfolded, and horny over too many characters not to love it. I was amused as often as I was annoyed with the outcome week to week as the story unfolded two episodes at a time. It doesn’t deserve a high rating. It’s slow paced, the plot line is a huge mess, and the characters are weird. But I’m giving it a high rating cause I loved this dumb, beautiful disaster of a show with my whole heart.\n\nEverything you need to know about Bulgasal is revealed in the first ten minutes of the show with the narration introducing the last monster, the flashes of mysterious scenes on a bridge, and the cool opening title sequence. Not once did I hit the skip button, either. I love that title sequence.\n\nBulgasal has an unknown story line (we’re not following any real historical royal families or diving into era specific conflicts or politics), so there’s no easy guessing of the plot’s major conflict. It’s got reincarnation angles, so there are multiple timelines with multiple versions of characters popping up. It’s got a grumpy protagonist who spends the large majority of the show sulking around a dirty house while a bunch of sunshine characters come in upset his world. It’s got a very enjoyable and theatrical antagonist who has more chemistry with the leading man than the leading lady does. And it’s got all kinds of wacky supernatural stuff at play without clear rules so it’s always a mystery how it’s going to effect the storyline and all the characters.\n\nI mean, you won’t really know what’s happening or why in this show for a long time and even when you find out it’s not particularly inspired, but it’s so much fun guessing. If you have any imagination whatsoever you will invent a plotline three times better than the one offered and bask in the glory of your mental fanfiction as you stare at the beautiful people on your screen.\n\nBulgasal is a whole vibe. You’re either on board or not. Do you want on this ship?\n\nWait, I’m sorry. What was that? I don’t think I heard you.\n\nI said DO YOU WANT ON THIS SHIP?\n\nALL ON BOARD.\n\nMy personal rating 10/10. My subjective rating? Uhm… 7/10? But why be subjective with Bulgasal? That’s not what this drama is bringing to the table. Let’s adjust to uh… Overall rating: 9/10. A beautiful disaster that captivated the fandom.\n\nNow let’s talk about what made Bulgasal… Bulgasal. Or rather, let’s just follow tangents along and ramble as I reminisce on the fandom and the characters in this show.\n\nSPOILERS BELOW.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nBL Dramas – Which Country Does BL Best?\n\nBL, or Boys Love, is nothing new to the scene. It’s been around for quite a while, largely in print or anime format. It’s also been extremely diverse from the get-go with many different genres and settings offering us male/male relationships from super sweet romance romances to intensely sexual content. I still remember stumbling across the anime Ai no Kusabi (1992) – which was burned onto a CDR and stuffed in as some free bonus content from my order of Wolf’s Rain (2003) I’d received off eBay.\n\nYa’ll. I was not prepared for Ai no Kusabi.\n\nI’d stumbled across the Finder manga in 2002 and thought I’d found the peak pervy storyline of the sexy mafia boss and his feisty reporter twink… but no. Ai no Kusabi created an entire world around sex pets, like the Claiming of Sleeping Beauty trilogy and Exit to Eden books by Anne Rice, this was a society built upon BDSM and sexual servitude.\n\nSo, like many others, I discovered BL through Japanese manga and anime. Some of them creeped me out with their childlike boy characters (No Money, Boku no Pico), while others made the age-gap work for them (Junjou Romantica). And of course, there were plenty of manga and anime series with heavily implied gay storylines and artwork, giving us “manservice” if you will, where they would show you they were gay but wouldn’t tell you they were gay. One of my all time favorite series X/1999 is one such storyline. I mean… that entire story is just queer escapism. The manga, the anime, even the weird movie… it’s good stuff. Super gay. And yet… not.\n\nThe 21st Century has already seen many cultural shifts and changes, one of the most positive of those has been the push for global acceptance of LGBTQ+ people. We have seen gay marriage, gay rights, and gay issues become major movements around the world. My ardent wish is that by the mid-century, LGBTQ+ people will have equal rights and protections under the law everywhere.\n\nIn the past few years I have watched an explosion of BL live action dramas coming out of Asia, the popularity of this genre increasing almost exponentially whereas now it seems a global phenomenon. This is largely due to the fact that gay content has always been enjoyed outside the gay community. Love is universal, after all, and whether it’s two boys, two girls, a boy and a girl, or a pairing of other gender or sexual identities, it all reads the same – people falling in love.\n\nSince 2020, BL is increasingly common in the live action drama market. So… which country does it best?\n\nI’m not sure there is a real answer to that, as everything boils down to preference. Whether you prefer Thai, Taiwanese, Korean, Filipino, Japanese, and Chinese dramas will, undoubtedly, heavily influence your rankings. I certainly have my preferences, as I am sure you have yours (if you have watched more than one BL, that is). My preferences tend to be related to the storylines and dynamics more than the country, though. So in the genre of BL, I tend to stray from my preference for Korean Dramas, though there are a few from Korea that I enjoyed.\n\nAnyways, without further adieu – here are my favorite BL drama series that I’ve seen from various countries….\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview – Backstreet Rookie (and Ji Chang Wook’s Career Choices)\n\nSo cute! So breezy! So light weight it floats away as soon as you let go of it.\n\nHere’s my issue with Backstreet Rookie, Melting Me Softly, & Lovestruck in the City. They all featured Ji Chang Wook, so of course I watched them all cause I’m a fan. But they’re all just… good. But not great. Not outstanding. Not the types of shows to get you excited about the story line or the fate of the characters. None of these shows are top tier dramas and Ji Chang Wook is a top tier actor, so it feels like a waste somehow, even when it’s a good show.\n\nJi Chang Wook is an actor who is skilled in his craft, who can bring complexity and a wide range of emotions to his roles, who can really suck you into the character arcs of a story. Ji Chang Wook who shook us to our core in Empress Ki. Ji Chang Wook who took our hearts in Warrior Baek Dong Soo. Ji Chang Wook of the iconic show Healer. Ji Chang Wook of the action frenzy escapism of The K2.\n\nNone of his recent dramas are worth him. These are all shows you hand over to lesser actors. These are shows that only required a handsome male lead who can be charming and a little pathetic when in love. And by taking these roles… Ji Chang Wook has lowered his standards, and ours.\n\nListen, I’m not saying I didn’t have a good time watching this show. I enjoyed every episode of it.\n\nBackstreet Rookie is a story about a handsome dude running a convenience store and the young super model “average girl” who is obsessed with him. She comes to work at his store and helps the business do better in order to win his heart and of course it works. They both fall in love. There are obstacles along the way. It’s a typical romantic comedy without any over-dramatic high stakes or melodramatic emotional obstacles to overcome. They’re both impossibly attractive and single – so yeah… cue the wedding march, I guess. I honestly don’t remember much more to the plot than that, now that it’s been a while.\n\nI think there was a side story line about her sister wanting to be an idol. And another side story line about a guy obsessed with Reggae music. Maybe? Was he an author or something? I don’t remember. Whatever. The side stories were cute, but they were garnish, not appetizers. They weren’t mean to be filling in any way, just decorate the surroundings of the main story.\n\nJi Chang Wook was super sweet in this. He’s good at playing these frustrated, adorable men. He’s good with comedic timing and playing off other characters. And he’s always good with his female leads, always.\n\nThe female lead, played by Kim You-Jung, was a drop-dead gorgeous young woman who went through a rebellious phase before settling into the routine and responsibilities of a regular job. She was stunning in every scene and her character was quite charming and I liked her the entire show.\n\nThere’s nothing to complain about. You’ll like watching it. You probably just won’t remember much of it later.\n\nThere are God-Tier work place dramas, like Coffee Prince, Incomplete Life/Misaeng, Live, Move to Heaven, & Pinocchio – you know, the ones that do the heavy lifting and bring more to the table with incredible character development, deeply moving character arcs, unexpected realism, and award winning performances – and then there are all the others, which vary from good to meh to skip it. Backstreet Rookie was good. Check it out. You’ll undoubtedly like it as it was a fun, feel-good rom-com.\n\nI will warn you there is no physical intimacy in this drama. A hug, maybe?\n\nThis is not a spoiler, in my opinion, as we all know what we are getting into when we start a romantic comedy. For whatever dumb reason we, as an audience, weren’t allowed to see the couple kiss (other than the pop kiss in the first episode with the weird pseudo-flying move). I thought this was a bullshit choice by the show runners, frankly, and it deeply annoyed me right at the end when I was supposed to be happy about a happy ending. So an otherwise cute and cheerful romantic comedy went out on a sour note. They even had the audacity to have the characters break the fourth wall and look directly into the camera and wink at us, as if we were in on this decision and agreed to look away. Listen, that’s not how the endearing break of the fourth wall at the end trope works. Watch The Greatest Love, that’s a far better romantic comedy that did the same trick the correct way. That is what we want to experience when our characters acknowledge the viewing audience.\n\nSigh.\n\nJi Chang Wook, are you sure you don’t want to do action dramas again? It doesn’t have to be anything as exhausting as The K2, mind you. We know you don’t want to be Super Wook any longer, but surely there is a middle ground. Something between. I know you’ve got it in you to bring the house down, so I’ll keep watching and hoping you pick up a role worthy of your acting chops.\n\nUntil then, I guess I’ll have to settle for these good-but-not-great romances you keep churning out.\n\nBackstreet Rookie – Overall Rating: 8/10 – Ridiculously Attractive People Maintain Their Perfect Figures & Complexions While Working Blue Collar Jobs Selling Junk Food.\n\nReview – Color Rush\n\nIn the world of this drama, some people are born color blind. It is inexplicable color blindness, having nothing to do with traditional color blindness that involves genetics and cells in the eye’s retina. These unique people are called Monos. They see only in shades of gray.\n\nMonos can be triggered into seeing color, however, if they find a person known as a Probe. Also incredibly rare, these individuals can activate (for lack of a better word) the eyes of Monos. The Monos then experience a color rush – as their eyes change to see color. It’s an overwhelming experience, causing fainting and blackouts. The Monos only experience color in the presence of their paired Probe.\n\nNeedless to say, this change in world view is very disorienting and compelling to the Monos. The experience causes obsessive tendencies and can even result in violence. The Monos desire to be always in the presence of the Probe leads many to stalking, kidnapping, and assault. There have even been cases of Monos eating their Probe partners.\n\nSo when our cute young Mono unexpectedly discovers his cute young Probe, all he wants to do is run away before the madness takes him. And all his Probe wants to do is flirt and invade his personal space, red flags of warning be damned. He strings along his color-rushed Mono, dolling out small doses of overwhelming color in carefully crafted (and surprisingly thoughtful) experiences. He drapes himself around this fainting, confused cutie and drags him into closets to see rainbows. Even when it’s obvious the experience is having an unsettling effect on the Mono, our slinkly Probe keeps pushing him along. Cause if you can see the world in color… why would you ever go back? Isn’t it worth the gamble of madness? Isn’t it worth turning your life upside down for? Isn’t it… the perfect metaphor for discovering you’re gay?\n\nTo say the premise of this series about all the colors of the rainbow is dark is the understatement of the year. It’s deliciously dark. My only complaint about this show is that it didn’t lean in harder to its obvious tonal values. It wanted to be both dark while also cuter than a basket of kittens… which is impossible to pull off under this plot line. I mean, we are told the color rush experience triggers cannibalism in the first episode. You can’t toss out information like that and not have it color, so to speak, the budding relationship.\n\nHonestly, the entire show was just middle of the road for me – the actors, the locations, the cinematography, the side story (which was non existent but could have been awesome), and the romance. Not bad but not good either. Just a solid “eh.” BUT – the plotline elevated this show into a higher status by being so intriguing that every episode felt exciting. The “what if…?” and the “oh god, is he…?” and the “OH MY GOD, IS THAT-?” that you’ll be asking yourself throughout the run time were massively engaging. Ultimately a bit of a let down, too, but enough to propel you forward at an enjoyable speed through this shows short run time.\n\nI’ve got more to say – but it skirts into spoilers, so let’s just drop a quick rating before we get into more. Though it really only deserved a 6 or 7, I’m gonna drop it in the top tier cause I doubt I’ll ever stop thinking about the BL story that tempted me with flesh eating insanity.\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10 – You’ll See Colors and Cannibals Everywhere.\n\nSpoiler time…\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview – The Red Sleeve\n\nThe Red Sleeve had a solid start but unfortunately wandered off the track towards the end and got lost in its own introspection. For nearly everything I liked about this drama, there was a counterweight of something I didn’t like. I will also admit I went into this with expectations of a sweeping historical romance, as I had heard this was a drama that captured people’s hearts with its love story, but, uhm… well, more on that in the review. Cause there was good and bad there, too, unfortunately.\n\nThe story itself was interesting and fresh. Though I am familiar with the fate of Crown Prince Sado, I am less familiar with the story of his son, King Jeongjo. I was captivated by the struggles of this young man, his fierce battle to always appear even tempered, intelligent, and upstanding so as never to be compared with his violent, mentally unstable father. You could really sense the pressure this young royal was under, how practiced his manners were, how he forced himself to endure any hardships with near silence and restraint. Lee Joon-Ho was surprisingly good in this role, for the most part, his bright eyes barely hiding the amount of intense suppressed emotion he carried around inside him.\n\nHe was especially charming in the beginning of this show. We got to enjoy one of the most tried-and-true tropes, the prince in disguise, as he sat around the library flirting with our lead female, the palace maid who somehow failed to recognize him as royalty.\n\nThese were the best episodes, in my opinion, and where both the lead male and lead female truly shined. At this point in the drama, the script felt focused and on track to deliver a great story of a young man navigating the complexities of politics and the dangers of the royal court while finding a loyal and intelligent woman to stand by his side. The King even says this. Verbatim. Like a thesis statement. That the crown prince will need to find solace and comfort in a woman, someone who can be his rock as he navigates the raging sea of politics. And for about half of the drama, that is the storyline we were given. And it was great.\n\nAs a casting director, I can’t say Lee Joon-Ho would have been my first choice for this role, but overall the actor pulled it off. Personally, I think he’s better suited to comedy, maybe, but whatever.\n\nThe most emotional aspect he was required to deliver was his conflicted relationship with the King. And he nailed it. You could sense how much he feared and probably despised his grandfather. And with good reason.\n\nFor those of you who may not know – Crown Prince Sado was murdered by his father. His death was particularly cruel – as no one wanted to outright murder him – so they shut in a small box until he died from starvation and dehydration. There were a lot of reasons behind Sado’s murder, but the constant criticism and strict disapproval of his father, the King, were certainly culprits. The King, played by Lee Deok-Hwa, was outstanding and captured both the disarming charm of the man as well as his mercurial nature, his fits of rage and suspicion, and his descent into dementia. Would it have been nice to have a little more overview into what exactly transpired between the King and his son Sado? Well… yes. I imagine it’s common knowledge in South Korea and no one needs the refresher course, but for us foreigner viewers I was grateful I had seen several movies and shows about Sado so I knew what was going on.\n\nSo that’s the basic plot. The male lead, our crown prince, is doing everything in his power to appease his grandfather the King and stay in his good graces so that he may one day take the throne. Our crown prince has many ideas for improving the country and is eager to step up and rule. Again, this is another area of the show that is both good and bad. Good, cause I understood why he’d been so studious and forced himself to remain stoic and even tempered in order to secure the crown. Bad, cause the show remained quite vague about the specifics of his grand plans of improvement. It was also quite vague about all the political and bloody turmoil that happened after he took the throne. They felt rather skimmed over and when they did take to the front of the stage, the emotional weight was lacking because those characters hadn’t been developed enough for me to care. Where the script chose to focus its attention often meandered and left me, the viewer, quite annoyed by its choices.\n\nListen, creating a good historical drama is a tough gig. Most sageuk’s end up like this one, with some solid episodes but overall sort of messy. They can’t all be Six Flying Dragons, I guess. For me, this was worth watching but I’ll never rewatch it. And if I am going to be recommending historical dramas, this won’t be near the top of the list.\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10.\n\nTo say more is to venture into spoiler territory so come along with me, my friends, further down the page if you want to dig into the female lead and the awkward handling of gender in this tale.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview – Gu Family Book / Kangchi, the Beginning\n\nI watched this series when it first came out, slapped a 7.5 star rating on it, and moved on with my life. Except I didn’t move on. I kept coming back to it. I don’t know how many times I have watched it now, but it’s a lot. A lot, a lot. And I honestly think it gets better with each rewatch. Now I’d say it’s a perfect 10/10. Occasionally our first impressions are just… wrong, okay?\n\nListen, sometimes you have to change your mind about stuff. It’s good for the soul.\n\nJust like this drama.\n\nJust like these two.\n\nBae Suzy and Lee Seung-Gi are the two leads, both of which are notoriously charming in all their dramas. Sticking them together was like the first person who thought to create a double layer cake. What if we put a cake… on top of a cake? Afterwards humanity forever wondered why they hadn’t been doing this the whole time. Cause of course, of course, cake on cake is perfect.\n\nAnd Bae Suzy and Lee Seung-Gi are perfect. They’re both charismatic actors who bring innocence, humor, and sincerity to all their roles. And just so you know – they don’t even really show up until episode 3. Like Queen Seon Duk, the first two episodes are all about the laying foundations of the story with the generation before.\n\nThe plotline of Gu Family Book is fantastic – both the supernatural plotline and the political one. There’s melodrama, action, revenge, political intrigue, and the supernatural. But at its core, this is a romance. And the romance is achingly romantic, with the plot winding slowly around your heart until by the time things start coming together for these two, you’re already desperately bound to their stories.\n\nOh, Gu Family Book! This show has it all. It packed in everything you can think of in its suitcase of plot devices to spellbind an audience. Kang Eun-Kyung wrote a script to rival some of the best historical dramas of all time. The story is huge, complicated, and multi-generational – yet it’s easy to follow and just builds on itself as it goes. There’s tons of humor to balance all the tragedy. The stakes are high but realistic. All the characters are fully developed, and I mean all of them. And they all get complete characters arcs, too, with transformation and growth (even if towards the dark side). I’ll get into all of this in more detail in the spoiler section.\n\nSometimes your protagonists are only as good as your antagonists, and Lee Seung-Gi plays one of the most monstrous villains of all time. You’ll be rooting for someone to cut this man down from the very first episode. Lee Seung-Gi will make your skin crawl. He plays his role with such menace, such devious certainty, that you never once doubt his character’s soul is blacker than the eyeliner of the lead singer of The Cure.\n\nThere are really dark aspects in this drama – human slavery, rape, torture, and murder – though their presentation is PG-13, you might be disturbed by the content. Gu Family Book does not pretend that the past was an entirely pleasant experience – it could be a very, very harsh world. But our characters still find ways to survive, to find beauty, joy, and pleasure, in the world they occupy. Sometimes the darkness can be overcome, and sometimes people have to make room for the light despite of it.\n\nListen, I’m hard pressed to think of a reason why you won’t like this drama. Other than the “old-school” special effects – which okay, sure, they’re old fashioned… it’s just glowing lights and rather painful looking colored contacts most of the time, but whatever. I’m embarrassed to admit I was overly dismissive of the simplistic special effects first viewing – which now don’t bother me in the least. In fact, I actually prefer a lot of these FX tricks over more tedious CGI.\n\nDon’t let your modern eye keep you from enjoying this fairy tale goodness just because its special effects are a bit dated. Maybe at first you’ll be a little unsure of how to feel about some of the show, but it will hypnotize you. Next thing you know you’ll be utterly delighted every time those little blue will-o’-the-wisps show up, every time Kang Chi’s eyes switch colors, every time the operatic theme song by Yisabel busts in… “There’s a stone for the things forgotten…”\n\nAround the early 2010’s is when Korean dramas started picking up a substantial fan base in America. There is something particular about the shows coming out during this time – they were so universally loved by viewers (with a few problematic elements here and there, sure) – they were so addictive, so shamelessly full of love, sorrow, hope, honor, and friendship – that they swept people up into the fan base and retained them as permanent K-drama addicts. Warrior Baek Dong Soo, The Moon Embracing the Sun, Queen In Hyun’s Man, Sungkyunkwan Scandal. If you’ve watched any of these dramas – then you know what I’m talking about. They’re distinctive. Distinctively freakin’ good.\n\nCheck it Gu Family Book and fall in love with a smitten tomboy warrior girl and the half-human half-mythical creature whose big heart and dimpled smile will win you over.\n\nOverall Rating: 10/10. Supernatural Tale Involving Magical Blue Lights and Colored Contact Lenses.\n\nCharacter Discussion & Spoilers Follow…\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview – Dali and the Cocky Prince\n\nDali and the Cocky Prince is a light-hearted, cute romance. It’s predictable and charming, like ordering the dish you know you like at the restaurant even though you promised yourself you would try something new. It’s the safe bet. You know you’ll enjoy it but you also know it will probably blur together in your memory with all the other times you ordered it.\n\nThis is not to say it has nothing new to offer. The premise itself is new and fresh – exploring the world of fine art and all the nuances involved in maintaining an art museum. Though there should have been a lot more of this written into the script, both to establish characters further and to elevate the shows themes. More on this topic in the spoiler section below.\n\nThe two leads were adorable and I genuinely cared about both of them. Their struggles were believable, their personalities distinctive and unique, and their immediate chemistry hooked me to this show in the first episode. Honestly, the couple’s chemistry is what kept me from abandoning this show all together – cause there were a few moments in my viewing that I felt rather bored with the whole storyline. Thankfully the main couple were both cute, quirky, and risk-takers in fashion – which is an art form in itself. How could I abandon ship when I looked forward to seeing what they’d be wearing each episode?\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed all the side characters in this drama, too – though I instantly forgot about them as soon as the show was over. It would have been nice if they’d let the roots go a little deeper with these characters, as they each promise. I mean, sure, we had a bunch of hammy trope characters (the goofy one, the serious one, the broody one, the dutiful one, the earnest one, and so on) but the potential was there to expand past that. Tell us more! The overall impression of the cast was firmly set in place, so why not add a bit more depth… some shadow, some contrast, some dimension to make the forms pop. It would have made the show far more memorable. Character development is what separates really good shows from the mix, really. A lot of shows might be worth hanging in your living room, but only a few will hang in a gallery or a museum… if we continue with the artistic metaphors.\n\nSo it is this, the wasted potential, which ultimately leads me to recommend this show but not rave about it. She’s good quality, but I can’t help but thinking she could have been a star.

Overall Rating: 9/10. The Korean Drama That Hooked American Viewers by Using Cliffhanger Bait.\n\nWhat can anyone say about it at this point that hasn’t already been said?\n\nIt was good. I enjoyed watching it. The aesthetics, the acting, the music, the plot – everything was stellar. The violence was nicely balanced with the quieter scenes of character development. The stakes felt real. The motivations that drove people to such desperation all seemed believable. Everything gelled.\n\nI can’t give it a 10/10 because it didn’t… end. Entire story lines were just abandoned, storylines left dangling in the wind. Clearly it’s meant to be continued, but I still like a satisfying to conclusion to each season of a show. So… I had to knock a point off.\n\nIf you are one of the few people on the planet who haven’t watched this global sensation, then I recommend you go watch it.\n\nRun On. Overall Rating: 7/10. Getting Your Footing in Life is Easier When You’re Hot.\n\nAh, rich people problems. Are they even… real problems? This show will not answer that question for you. I don’t think this show appreciates you even asking that question. In fact, this show would prefer you not think too hard about any of its major plot points, thank you, and please refrain from using your brain while you enjoy these attractive faces on the screen.\n\nI enjoyed watching Run On. It didn’t offer anything new (other than finally giving Shin Se-Kyung a role she seemed comfortable in). The romance is average. It was super sweet, mind you, and the actors have decent chemistry, but it’s nothing to write home over. There are better shows about a girl winning over the heart of an awkward man. There are better sports shows. There are better shows about the movie industry. There are better shows about rich, entitled children standing up to their rich, entitled parents.\n\nOriginally, I had intended to give this a solid 8/10 and stick it on my recommended list… but the second I sat down to review it, the rating quickly dropped. Because there are a lot of issues with the story line, if you pause long enough to think about it. What is the message? What… is this show saying about life and love? It seems to want to say something, but just didn’t mumbled through the thesis. So… no. It’s just so-so and thus deserving it’s 7/10.\n\nMy Name. Overall Rating: 9/10. Pretending a Snowflake Can Cause You Physical Damage for 8 Hours Straight.\n\nDid anyone believe that the leading lady could kick someone’s ass? I wasn’t even convinced she could give someone a stinging slap, let alone step into an underground MMA ring. Maybe it’s something about Han So-Hee’s gently rounded face that makes it impossible for me to believe this story.\n\nSome actresses can pull off the illusion of strength and some can’t. Kim Da-Mi from The Witch and Itaewon Class? I believed she could kick my tail. Kim Ok-Vin from The Villainess? Same. Jun Jong-Seo as the crazy chick from The Call? Yup. Ha Ji-Won can kick all their tails combined. Bae Doo-Na and Lee Si Young, too.\n\nHan So-Hee, however… is a gentle ballerina, a flower petal, a snowflake. I like this actress, but I didn’t like her in this role. I was, however, willing to overlook it because everything else about this show was spot on my exact brand of tea.\n\nThough My Name did not give us a believable protagonist, it did offer up one of the most convincing villains of all time. Chang Ryul playing the feisty fighter working his way to the top of the Dongcheonpa was golden. His performance was so unhinged, so enjoyable to watch, that I quickly forgot about my qualms with the casting the second he was on screen.\n\nI totally believed this dude would get a neck tattoo and chop a guy’s arm off while taunting him. This is excellent casting. Seriously, he saved the entire show in my opinion.\n\nWas the overall plot a melodramatic vengeance fantasy, with little to no attempts to be convincing or believable? Yes. And I love that. Was the romance good, at least? Eh, not particularly, but the love story hit home more on the second viewing. Should I even watch this series, then? Yes. Of course. It’s not very long, with only 8 episodes, and there’s lots of fighting and cops chasing after gang members and whatnot. This show doesn’t have anything to say, really – there’s no message or cultural critiques or unique insights into humanity. It’s just a fun action show. Good cinematography, great acting, very good action sequences, enough twists to entertain you as you unfold the mystery. I loved it.\n\nPlus I was gay for the villain (the other one, not the neck tattoo guy but the head of the mafia who takes our orphan girl under his wing). He was clearly gay for the girl’s father, too. And he was just… yum. A slinky, cruel, calculating monster. Villainous perfection. That mob boss can do whatever he wants to me.\n\nHellbound. Overall Rating: 8/10. What If It’s All Meaningless?\n\nHellbound was another show that I had to change my rating for as I thought about how to review it. When I originally watched it, it was a solid 7/10 (the first chunk maybe rating around 9/10 – then quickly losing me as it switched focus for part two). But this show lingered in my mind. The implications of this show were… vast. And it made you think about humanity, and how we are culturally conditioned to believe certain things without proof, and how this can be both good and bad depending on the circumstances. So, I rounded it out to a solid 8/10. It’s worth it cause it makes you think.\n\nThe plot of Hellbound is relatively simple. A mysterious entity shows up to various people in the world, announces the exact time in which they will die and be dragged to hell, and then makes good on that promise. Huge creatures appear out of nowhere, violently beat you to pulp before killing you, and then just as suddenly disappear. The creatures were awful, by the way – the CGI was sadly lacking, presenting us with these gummy looking children’s’ toys that only seemed threatening due to the performances of the actors pretending to die. But the horror of it, of knowing you were not only going to die – but had been judged and sentenced – is quite an uncomfortable topic. The general public’s fervent desire to cast these people into the roles of “wrong doers” was obvious – they had to deserve it, surely, or else what does that say about the nature of the world? About the afterlife? This series leaves you with uncomfortable questions about the definition of hell, about the unknown things in the universe, about what it means to die or have your life and all your decisions judged by outside and unknown forces. Most of these questions were not answered, either, which works for me… for the most part.\n\nOnce again, I am left wondering if the dangling questions were left there with the intention of a second season. Like Squid Game. As you may or may not know (depending on how much of this blog you’ve read), I am not a fan of second seasons in Korean Dramas. In general, I find what I most like about K-Dramas is their ability to complete a storyline. The threads of various storylines and characters in one show all pulling together for a tightly connected plot is one of the reasons K-dramas are awesome. They know what they are and they know where they are going.\n\nBut Hellbound was already presented as two different short stories within one larger frame. The first half of the series focusing on one group of characters, and the second half on another. Both stories were interesting, though I found the first more compelling overall.\n\nAnyways, I liked it. I liked it for it’s horrific implications. I liked it for its nihilism. It reminded me of the ending of Revival by Stephen King – a shocking, surrealistic nightmare vision of the afterlife which to this day still haunts me. Humans put a lot of stock into certain ideas – into religions – into how our lives fit into the universe. Souls, afterlives, reincarnations, supernatural beings who navigate our destinies… it’s meant to both comfort us and disquiet us. “Be good or else.” It appeals to our desire for balance and justice. “They might not suffer in this world for the terrible things they’ve done, but they’ll suffer in the next.” A show like this could not be made in America. We can only pick holes into religion in a playful or ridiculous way – ways that are clearly entertainment only and not meant to trigger any real examinations of our spiritual beliefs. The Good Life, Supernatural, Lucifer, and such. Even more drama-heavy shows, like The Leftovers or Midnight Mass, leave room for comfort in beliefs. Hellbound doesn’t bother to try to comfort you. It just kicks you when you’re down and says, “Makes you wonder, huh?”\n\nWhat can I say? I like the existential dread."
