Kim Nam-gil will the play the detective, replacing The Face Reader‘s Lee Jung-jae. The latter dropped out of the role after suffering an injury on the set of an actioner currently under production, The Big Match.

“Director Oh Seung-wook is well known for penning the script of Hur Jin-ho‘s [popular romance] One Fine Spring Day and made an impressive directorial debut in 2000 with Kilimanjaro. He is expected to deliver yet another unique mise-en-scene with A Bastard,” said a spokesperson for Sanai Pictures. “Jeon Do-yeon will be playing a character who possesses both strength and innocence — something only an actress of such caliber can portray.”
