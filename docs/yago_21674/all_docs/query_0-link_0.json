Mayer censured Vidor for incorporating some of Glyn's “hot-cheeked” depictions of sexual decadence.[6]\n\nA former officer of the Russian Imperial Army, by now living in Los Angeles, served as a technical adviser on the film. His actual name has not been confirmed; however, the studio press releases referred to him as Mike Mitchell. This film marked the first of four times that John Gilbert and King Vidor would work together. Despite showcasing his riding ability and appearance, Gilbert hated the script and felt it gave him nothing substantial to do as an actor.[7]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nIn this, Gilbert's first film with King Vidor, audiences were impressed with the star as a romantic leading man[8]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to MGM's records, the film made a profit of $159,000.[1] MGM sent Elinor Glynn records which stated the film cost $211,930 and earned $317,442 resulting in a profit of only $105,511. This meant Glynn, who was entitled to 33.3% of net profits, earned $35,170.[9]\n\nPreservation\n\n[edit]\n\nA print of His Hour with Czech intertitles is located at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.[10]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBaxter, John. 1976.
