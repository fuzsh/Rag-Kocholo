        "text": "\"Roland? It's Anne-Marie.\"\n\nAt the end of the summer, the voice of Anne-Marie Miéville, Jean-Luc Godard's wife, sounded at the other end of the landline.\n\n\"I hope it's good news and not bad news,\" said Roland Tolmatchoff.\n\n\"A bit of both,\" said Miéville. \"I'll pass you over to Jean-Luc.\"\n\nWhen someone chooses to prepare their own death, they have time to organize their farewell. If Godard phoned Tolmatchoff, it was perhaps because this 92-year-old former actor, assistant director, yo-yo salesman, antique dealer and Swiss bookseller was his oldest friend. His oldest living friend, just a few months older than Godard, has the same collection of memories from over the last century. They were both 20 years old in 1950. And now this unique voice, which was both shaky and deep from smoking cigars, slowed down by a slight lisp and a hint of a Swiss accent sounded through the old man's phone.\n\n\"Roland, I'm sending you love, I'm leaving.\"\n\nA few weeks have passed since Jean-Luc Godard's death on the morning of September 13. It was an \"assisted suicide,\" which was authorized and regulated by Swiss legislation. From his Geneva retirement home, at the terminus of bus line 7 that leads to the place called Bout du monde, Tolmatchoff retraced the thread of his life and his friendship with the New Wave filmmaker. The Swiss resident was born in Kharkiv, in one of the Soviet republics of the time, now in Ukraine.\n\nHe was 8 years old when his mother took him and his brothers and sisters and went into exile in Switzerland in 1938, in order to flee the Bolsheviks. \"I believe that my father, a pure Ukrainian opposed to Stalin's purges, a diplomatic writer who named me after the writer Romain Rolland, was eaten by wolves after escaping from a prison on the Solovki Islands\" in the White Sea, said Tolmatchoff. With his long silvery beard and frayed hair, he looks like Gandalf or Saruman, the wizards from Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.\n\nThree weddings and a witness\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Parador, a tea room on the Place de Rive in Geneva, was the haunt of a small gang that only lived for the cinema. A young half-Swiss, half-French dandy with tinted glasses was in charge. On the terrace, Tolmatchoff, a self-taught cinema enthusiast and fabulous collector of books on cinema, impressed Godard with his nerve with the girls and his \"mental archiving.\" \"I recited the credits of the smallest films, the names of the assistants, the lighting technicians and the decorators from memory.\"\n\nRead more Subscribers only 'Lessons from Jean-Luc Godard'\n\nBoth were fond of Supervielle's poetry and Marcel Carné and Julien Duvivier's films. In Tolmatchoff's \"treasure box,\" a box tucked under his hospital bed, there are some moving archives of their tangled youths, like two movie tickets from the Palace in Lausanne which are more than half a century old. They date from 1960, when Godard was shooting Le Petit Soldat (The Little Soldier), his second feature film, and had enlisted Tolmatchoff as his assistant. One morning, he canceled the shoot and had the technicians and actors sent home, \"they were,\" Tolmatchoff said, \"my mother, my sister and my teachers at the time: I had done all the casting myself.\" The future maestro had an appointment \"at the cinema with Anna,\" his film's star. The pink tickets were there before our eyes. On one, Godard had written, \"I love\" and on the other, \"Anna.\""
