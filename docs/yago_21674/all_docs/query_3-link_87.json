        "text": "Street Scene is an adaptation from a Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name. The play and the screenplay was written by Elmer Rice and depicts the lives and challenges of the people living in a New York City street. It is set in the summer heat and is condensed to a very short period of time. It starts one evening and ends the following afternoon.\n\nDirector King Vidor basically uses only one location for the entire movie. So one could say that the movie feels very much like a stage play. But Vidor, a master of his craft, uses the location to full effect and is able to make the movie look and feel very authentic. While watching it,…\n\nthe tiny dreams and hopes of all people -- vidor transforms a theatrical tableau into a miniature study in organic spatial/temporal relation, the surging of crowds and the assertion of individual will, how regular everything is until tragedy strikes -- all the routines and civilized games avoiding the truth, \"it can happen here, too\" -- a total depiction of the urban milieu, in both its uncertain glory and political contradictions -- godard said that vidor made movies of the 'common man' so that the rest of cinema didn't have to, but it was more than that: vidor filmed the uncommon virtues and vices that are common to each person, he was invested in the capacity to present a cosmic perspective…\n\nYes, this was watched last night because the plot revolves around a heat wave. It’s a movie I’ve known of for a long while now but the hot climate that has seemingly enveloped the entire Northern Hemisphere as of late made it seem logical (not to mention topical) to give it a spin. The setting of this movie-in fact, all but a small scene are set on a giant sound stage-is a city block in New York City which is a melting pot filled with many different ethnicities & cultures. Of course, the non-white faces you see are only shown briefly, but that is to be expected in Hollywood. The story is based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play and the…\n\nApril 2022: Director of the Month - King Vidor\n\nWith the advent of talkies, Hollywood rushed to adapt Broadway stage dramas and musicals for the screen. Today most seem dated, stagey and technically primitive. But King Vidor's Street Scene stands up well, due to expert direction and cinematography, a poignant performance by Sylvia Sidney and a well-written script.\n\nBased on Elmer Rice's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1929 play (he wrote the screenplay also), it tells of the residents of a crowded slum tenement during a heat wave. Everyone is in everyone else's business; different immigrant ethnic groups, and gossip abounds. People experience either desperation or resignation and emotions flare up as the temperature rises. Men get drunk, women are sexually harassed and…\n\nPerhaps not the world in 90 minutes, but Vidor's Street Scene might just be America in 80 minutes. Set in a half city block in New York City over the course of 24 hours in the sweltering summer heat, this cultural and ideological melting pot slowly reaches the boiling point as tenants are revealed as prisoners driven or controlled by fear, lust, jealousy, intolerance, xenophobia, greed and sexism. Every conversation is within earshot of a judgmental neighbor, each love affair wilted by the overbearing desires of a parent, all compliments undermined by tones of condescension and insults thrown like darts whose tips are poisoned by an innate yet irrational hatred of the other. And yet, Vidor somehow finds enough room…\n\n”You certainly never know when you get up in the morning what the day’s gonna bring.”\n\nTo channel Lin-Manuel, “ . . . it's gotten too darn hot, like my man Cole Porter said.”\n\nThe inhabitants of a New York City brownstone are chronicled over a less than 24 hour span one steamy summer in this Sam Goldwyn-produced, King Vidor-directed adaptation of Elmer Rice’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play - screenplay by the author himself. Pointedly unglamorous as it captures mostly unremarkable day-to-day interactions and struggles until the tragic culmination. Though perhaps overly simplistic to a modern eye, there’s a sense of humanity here somewhat reminiscent of The Crowd.\n\nThis rewatch was partially instigated by my recent modem woes. Unable to stream,…\n\nNow this was not what I was expecting.\n\nReally unsure as to why this isn't a highly touted classic, it's way ahead of its time. A beautiful portrait of a city, an encapsulation of a time.\n\nReal. Dark. Joyous. Unforgiving. Life.\n\nIt's really just a subtle masterclass on filmmaking. The way each moment flows into the next, the constant buzz of life, the way it opens a small window into the complexity of humanity . . . exquisite; jumping from character to character, somehow managing to give you an understanding of each of them, even in the short pre-code run-time. Each character moseying their way into the other's lives, trying to connect, trying to find validation, love, a person to…\n\nTwenty-four hours elapse on the stoop of a Hell's Kitchen tenement as a microcosm of the American melting pot interacts with each other during a summer heatwave.\n\nStreet Scene is scene after scene on a street, a rare phenomenon of a film title totally encapsulating what the film is about. Marks Beulah Bondi's film debut where she plays a gossiping, moralising and unsympathetic woman. When tragedy strikes, she politely yet coldly compares Sylvia Sidney's experience to her own before walking into the flat block. Nothing more could be expected of her.\n\nWhen people say that they don't make them like that anymore, there's a case for Street Scene's unique moment in time when neither internet or television existed, when less…"
