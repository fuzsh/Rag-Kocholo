        "text": "Post by Mattsby on\n\nDidn't know exactly how to word this. \"Ghost-directed\" sounds odd. What I mean and what I've been thinking about recently is when someone directed or co-directed a film but they aren't credited. Name any/all examples.\n\nI watched Beauty and the Beast ('46) the other day and I was just reading into Tightrope ('84). These are two different situations: with Beauty it's a question of whether you think Rene Clement \"helped out\" enough to be considered co-director. Jean Cocteau is quite potently the creative force behind the film, of course, but for those who don't know: Clement was hired to assist in directing and he did, he directed several scenes and was always there to take over when Cocteau fell ill (which happened practically daily).\n\nTightrope it's said was essentially directed by Clint Eastwood but bc of the DGA's \"Eastwood Rule\" he couldn't be credited (the rule was created after he fired and took over directing duties on Outlaw Josey Wales in '76).\n\nOtherwise the most popularly talked about example is Spielberg and Poltergeist. He couldn't be credited bc of some other DGA rule, he was already signed onto ET. There's plenty of word and even behind the scenes footage of Spielberg manning that pic. So another question is for those who've seen Beauty, Tightrope, Poltergeist -- do you consider Clement, Eastwood, Spielberg as co-directors or not really?\n\nThere are lotta other examples based on slight or unsubstantiated scuttle. Or else it can often be tricky to figure out.... like The Thing From Another World ('51)... major debate and differing reports on Howard Hawks' input....\n\nPost by therealcomicman117 on\n\nWhaaaaaa?\n\nyeah buddy... original dude got fired after a few scenes, Rambo guy was brought in but it was so late that Kurt pretty much just did it all himself.\n\nInteresting that he's never tried his hands at directing again before or after.\n\nI'd probably believe the story however, Cosmatos never made anything as good as Tombstone, although Levithan is solid."
