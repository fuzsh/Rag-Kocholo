        "text": "2011 American science fiction action film\n\nFor other uses, see In time (disambiguation).\n\nIn TimeDirected byAndrew NiccolWritten byAndrew NiccolProduced by\n\nAndrew Niccol\n\nMarc Abraham\n\nEric Newman\n\nStarringCinematographyRoger DeakinsEdited byZach StaenbergMusic byCraig Armstrong\n\nProduction\n\ncompanies\n\nDistributed by20th Century Fox\n\nRelease dates\n\nRunning time\n\n109 minutes[3]CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$40 million[4]Box office$174 million[5]\n\nIn Time is a 2011 American science fiction action film written, produced, and directed by Andrew Niccol. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried star as inhabitants of a society that uses time from one's lifespan as its primary currency, with each individual possessing a clock on their arm that counts down how long they have to live. Cillian Murphy, Vincent Kartheiser, Olivia Wilde, Matt Bomer, Johnny Galecki, and Alex Pettyfer also star. The film was released on October 28, 2011, and grossed $174 million against a $40 million budget. It received negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, which praised the premise but called the execution heavy handed.[6] On Metacritic, it received mixed reviews.[7]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2169, people are genetically engineered to stop aging on their 25th birthdays and are given one free year to live. Everyone has a timer on their forearm that shows their remaining time; when it reaches zero, the person \"times out\" and instantly dies.\n\nTime is now the universal currency, transferred directly between people or stored in capsules. The country is divided into Time Zones; Dayton is the poorest, a ghetto where people rarely have more than 24 hours on their timer. New Greenwich is the richest, people there are effectively immortal.\n\nFactory worker Will Salas lives in Dayton with his mother Rachel. One night, he rescues drunken Henry Hamilton from time thief Fortis and his gang the Minutemen. Hamilton reveals that the people of New Greenwich hoard their time while constantly increasing prices to keep the poor dying.\n\nHamilton transfers all his time to a sleeping Will before deliberately timing out and dying. Raymond Leon, the leader of the police-like Timekeepers, assumes that Will killed Hamilton and pursues him.\n\nWill's friend Borel warns him against having so much time in Dayton. Will gives Borel ten years, one for each year of their friendship. Will sets off to meet his mother, intending to take her to New Greenwich. His mother times out and dies in his arms, less than a second before he could transfer time to her and save her life. Will vows to avenge his mother's death by taking the people of New Greenwich for everything they have.\n\nIn a New Greenwich casino, Will meets time-loaning businessman Philippe Weis and his daughter Sylvia. Will wins over a millennium at poker while nearly timing himself out. Sylvia invites him to a party. Leon arrests Will and confiscates all but two hours of his time.\n\nWill takes Sylvia hostage and escapes to Dayton, but Fortis's gang ambushes them, leaving them with 30 minutes each. Will attempts to get some time back from Borel, but his wife Greta explains that he has drunk himself to death. They get a day each by pawning Sylvia's earrings. Will demands Weis pay a 1,000-year ransom to the people in Dayton in exchange for Sylvia's safe return. Weis refuses, and Will releases Sylvia just as Leon finds them. Sylvia shoots Leon in the arm, and Will gives him enough time to survive until the other Timekeepers arrive. They use Leon's car to pull over a New Greenwich resident whom they rob of her time and car.\n\nWill and Sylvia rob her father's time banks and give time capsules to the needy. They realize they cannot significantly change anything, as prices are raised faster to compensate for the extra time. Fortis's gang ambushes them to collect the reward for their capture, but Will kills him and his gang. Will and Sylvia steal a one-million year capsule from her father's vault. Leon chases them back to Dayton but fails to stop them distributing the stolen time. Leon times out, having neglected to collect his day's salary. Will and Sylvia nearly time out themselves but survive by taking his salary.\n\nTelevision reports show factories in Dayton shutting down as everyone has enough time to abandon their jobs. Having seen the consequences of his obsession with the pair, Leon's colleague Jaeger orders the Timekeepers to return home. Will and Sylvia progress to larger banks, still trying to crash the system.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJustin Timberlake as factory worker Will Salas, who learns the truth about the time system\n\nAmanda Seyfried as Sylvia Weis, businessman Phillipe Weis' daughter who becomes Will's accomplice\n\nCillian Murphy as Timekeeper Raymond Leon\n\nAlex Pettyfer as Fortis, a thug and time thief\n\nVincent Kartheiser as banker Philippe Weis, whose companies control the time system\n\nOlivia Wilde as Will's mother Rachel\n\nMatt Bomer as Henry Hamilton, a centenarian who wants to die\n\nJohnny Galecki as Will's friend Borel\n\nCollins Pennie as Timekeeper Jaeger\n\nEthan Peck as Constantin\n\nYaya DaCosta as Borel's wife Greta\n\nRachel Roberts as Carrera\n\nAugust Emerson as Levi\n\nSasha Pivovarova as Clara Weis, Sylvia's grandmother\n\nJesse Lee Soffer as Webb\n\nBella Heathcote as Michele Weis, Sylvia's mother\n\nToby Hemingway as Timekeeper Kors\n\nMelissa Ordway as Leila\n\nJessica Parker Kennedy as Edouarda\n\nJeff Staron as Oris\n\nMatt O'Leary as Moser\n\nNick Lashaway as Ekman\n\nRay Santiago as Victa\n\nKris Lemche as Markus\n\nLaura Ashley Samuels as Sagita\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the film was titled In Time, the names Now and I'm.mortal were used.[8] On July 12, 2010, it was reported that Amanda Seyfried had been offered a lead role.[9] On July 27, 2010, it was confirmed that Justin Timberlake had been offered a lead role.[10] On August 9, 2010, Cillian Murphy was confirmed to have joined the cast.[11]\n\nThe first photos from the set were revealed on October 28, 2010.[12] 20th Century Fox and New Regency distributed the film, and Marc Abraham and Eric Newman's Strike Entertainment produced it.[13]\n\nIn an interview with Kristopher Tapley of In Contention, Roger Deakins stated that he would be shooting the film in digital, which makes this the first film to be shot in digital by the veteran cinematographer.[14]\n\nThe Dayton scenes were filmed primarily in the Skid Row and Boyle Heights neighborhoods of Los Angeles, while the New Greenwich scenes were filmed primarily in Century City, Bel Air, and Malibu. Although the names of the ghetto-like zone and wealthy enclave reflect Dayton and Greenwich, respectively, the maps used by the Timekeepers are maps of Los Angeles.\n\nFor the retrofuturistic setting, the production's vehicle suppliers assembled a fleet of cars and trucks from used car lots and junkyards. Although an old Citroën DS 21 and Cadillac Seville feature, center stage goes to a fleet of seemingly immaculate Dodge Challengers and Lincoln Continentals. The rich drive around in the high gloss Lincolns, all of which have been smoothed, lowered and fitted with oversized disc wheels on low profile rubber. The Dodges are the Time Keeper's cop cars. These too have been smoothed and externally customized, with grilles front and rear covering the lights, and low profile tires on disc wheels. In stark contrast to the Lincolns, paintwork is matte black. A slim police light-bar is fitted internally, behind the windshield.\n\nThe use of retrofuturism is one of many elements that the film shares with Niccol's earlier work, Gattaca; Niccol himself referred to it as \"the bastard child of Gattaca\".[15] That film also features electrically powered vintage cars (notably a Rover P6 and again, a Citroën DS), as well as buildings of indeterminate age. Gattaca also deals with innate inequalities (though in its case genetic, rather than longevity) and also features a character seeking to cross the divide that his birthright is supposed to deny him. Similarly, he is pursued by law enforcement officers after being wrongly identified as having committed a murder.\n\nCopyright lawsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 15, 2011, a lawsuit was filed against the film by attorneys acting on behalf of Harlan Ellison, author of \"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman\". The suit, naming New Regency, director Andrew Niccol and a number of anonymous John Does, appears to base its claim on the similarity that both the completed film and Ellison's story concern a dystopian future in which people have a set amount of time to live which can be revoked, given certain pertaining circumstances by a recognized authority known as a Timekeeper. Initially, the suit demanded an injunction against the film's release;[16] however, Ellison later altered his suit to instead ask for screen credit[17] before ultimately dropping the suit, with both sides releasing the following joint statement: \"After seeing the film In Time, Harlan Ellison decided to voluntarily dismiss the Action. No payment or screen credit was promised or given to Harlan Ellison. The parties wish each other well, and have no further comment on the matter.\"[18]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 37% of 175 critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.30/10. The website's consensus reads, \"In Time's intriguing premise and appealing cast are easily overpowered by the blunt, heavy-handed storytelling.\"[6] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 53 based on 36 reviews.[7] CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a \"B-minus\" on an A+ to F scale.[19] Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review with 3 stars out of 4, noting that the \"premise is damnably intriguing\", but \"a great deal of this film has been assembled from standard elements\".[20] Henry Barnes noted that Will is \"one of the 99%\" and calls the character \"a Rolex Robin Hood\".[21]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Time grossed $12 million on its opening weekend, debuting at number three behind Puss in Boots, and Paranormal Activity 3. The film declined later on during its 14 weekend box office run. The film eventually grossed over $37.5 million in the US and $136.4 million internationally for a worldwide total of $173.9 million.[5]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Price of Life\n\nLogan's Run\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
