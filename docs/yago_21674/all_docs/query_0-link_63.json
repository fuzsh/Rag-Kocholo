        "text": "The Galveston-born filmmaker who helped make ‘The Wizard of Oz’ a hit\n\nIf the tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz feels uncannily realistic, especially for a movie released in 1939, that’s because its director had survived a similar real-life experience. That would be Galveston native King Vidor, son of a successful lumber merchant who would go on to become one of Hollywood’s most successful and influential filmmakers.\n\nToday, although it has temporarily been removed for touch-up work, one of Galveston’s famous “tree sculptures” created after Hurricane Ike–this one at his boyhood home on Winnie Street–honors Vidor’s (pronounced VEE-dor) uncredited contributions to Wizard. Victor Fleming had already directed most of the film when, in February 1939, MGM called him away to finish shooting Gone With the Wind and asked Vidor to take over. The scenes he shot were mostly the black-and-white Kansas part of the story, including Judy Garland’s singing “Over the Rainbow” and the tornado.\n\nThe latter scene took Vidor back to when he was a boy of six, when the September 1900 hurricane nearly destroyed Galveston. Decades later, he recalled the utter devastation in a 1980 oral history for the Director’s Guild of America.\n\n“All the wooden structures of the town were flattened,” he said. “The streets were piled high with dead people, and I took the first tugboat out. On the boat I went up into the bow and saw that the bay was filled with dead bodies, horses, animals, people, everything.”\n\nThroughout his career, Vidor was nominated five times for the Best Director Academy Award, for The Crowd; Hallelujah; The Champ; The Citadel; and War and Peace. He never won, losing to George Stevens of the Lone Star epic Giant in his final nomination. Three years before he died at age 88 in 1982, though, the Academy at last gave him an honorary Oscar. Presenting was his War and Peace star Audrey Hepburn.\n\n“By the time the sound era arrived, he was already considered one of Hollywood’s top filmmakers,” she told the audience at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and on worldwide television. “In all the years since then, King Vidor has reaffirmed that position many times over. His range as a filmmaker is extraordinary.”"
