        "text": "Hallelujah\n\nOne of the first films with an all-African American cast produced by a major studio, this musical follows sharecropper Zeke Johnson (Daniel L. Haynes) and chronicles his relationship with swindler Chick (Nina Mae McKinney), pushing him toward a dishonorable path. This was Nina May McKinney’s first film role, after being discovered by director King Vidor—earning her a contract at MGM, making McKinney the first Black actor with this accomplishment. It has been noted that during the production of this film, McKinney met and entered a brief affair with actor Pepi Lederer.\n\nDIRECTED BY: King Vidor. WRITTEN BY: Wanda Tuchock, King Vidor, Richard Schayer, Ransom Rideout. WITH: Daniel L. Haynes, Nina Mae McKinney, William Fountaine, Harry Gray. 1929. 109 min. USA. B&W. English. 35mm. Restored by the Library of Congress and The Film Foundation. Funding provided by the Hobson/Lucas Family Foundation.\n\nSafe in Hell\n\nNew Orleans sex worker Gilda (Dorothy Mackaill) murders her former boss—who had brought on Gilda’s struggles—and sets his apartment ablaze. To escape a murder charge, she sets off to a Caribbean island where booze is legal and criminals live without recourse. Nina Mae McKinney plays a dynamic supportive role as hotel manager Leonie in this pre-Code fare. Safe in Hell was McKinney’s next substantial role following Hallelujah; many studios at the time failed to create positive roles for Black contract players, leading McKinney to look for opportunities in Europe where she was dubbed “The Black Garbo.”\n\nDIRECTED BY: William A. Wellman. WRITTEN BY: Houston Branch, Joseph Jackson, Maude Fulton. WITH: Dorothy Mackaill, Donald Cook, Nina Mae McKinney, Ralf Harolde. 1931. 73 min. USA. B&W. English. DCP.\n\nAcademy Museum film programming generously funded by the Richard Roth Foundation.\n\nExplore our current quarterly print Film Calendar and browse the archive."
