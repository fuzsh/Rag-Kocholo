        "text": "Reḥovot, city, central Israel, on the coastal plain south-southwest of Tel Aviv–Yafo, in the centre of the country’s most productive citrus belt. The name (Hebrew: “broad places,” or “room”) is from the biblical allusion in Genesis 26:22. Founded in 1890 by Warsaw Jews, Reḥovot soon became economically self-sufficient, owing to its prosperous citrus groves, and absorbed many immigrant agricultural labourers. Under Ottoman rule before World War I, it was the first town to dismiss its Arab guards and to employ ha-Shomer, the Jewish settlement police.\n\nChaim Weizmann (1874–1952), Zionist leader and first president of Israel, built a house in Reḥovot in 1936; it and his gardens (where he is buried) are now a national memorial. Weizmann, a well-known chemist, founded a research institute there in 1934, which was renamed the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1944. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem has its Faculty of Agriculture in the city.\n\nReḥovot’s industries include the processing of citrus by-products (juices, oils, concentrates) and production of plastics, pharmaceuticals, and metal goods. Inc. 1950. Pop. (2006 est.) 104,300."
