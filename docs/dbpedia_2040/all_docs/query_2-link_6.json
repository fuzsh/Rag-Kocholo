        "text": "I was excited to visit the foodtech company 'Amai Proteins ' yesterday, which produces a unique, extremely sweet protein, that may soon become a significant part of our menu instead of white sugar. The Israeli foodtech industry is amazing, but unfortunately, the regulation in Israel is not adapted to the changing world of the foodtech industry. When I served as Minister of Agriculture, I saw the foodtech and agrotech developments as an integral part of the reform I led, and I backed this up with significant budgets for research and development. With the understanding that foodtech and agrotech are going to change the world of nutrition, the State of Israel must lead and enable the growth of these industries. That is why I established the lobby in the Knesset to promote the foodtech and agrotech industries. During the visit I learned about the difficulties experienced by the company following an outdated and extremely complicated regulation that exists in the State of Israel. A regulation that forces many areas of activity to be moved abroad. The State of Israel must adapt the regulation to the world of a changing climate, food crisis and the need for healthier and less polluting food. Israel can be the engine that pushes these industries in the world, we just have to allow the wonderful entrepreneurs and minds that we have here a comfortable ground for operation and development. The State of Israel will benefit, humanity will benefit and the future generations will have a healthier and cleaner world. #foodtech ilan Samish #agrotech"
