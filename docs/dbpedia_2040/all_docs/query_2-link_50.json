        "text": "•\n\nIf you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by completing, dating and signing the enclosed form of proxy, which should be mailed, postage-free (if mailed in the United States) in the enclosed envelope to our United States transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Alternatively, you may send a completed, signed proxy card directly to our Legal Advisor or VP Legal Affairs & Company Secretary at our Company’s registered offices, including via email, to the address or email addresses for those individuals provided above. We reserve the right to require additional identifying information if you submit your proxy card directly to our Company in that manner. If you mail in your proxy to our transfer agent in the enclosed envelope, it must be received by 11:59 a.m., Eastern time, on Wednesday, September 7, 2022 for your vote to be validly included in the tally of ordinary shares voted at the Meeting. If you send in your proxy card directly to our registered office, it must be received at least four (4) hours prior to the appointed time for the Meeting on Thursday, September 8, 2022.\n\n•\n\nIf your ordinary shares are held beneficially in “street name”, that is, in a bank or brokerage account or by a trustee or nominee, on the Nasdaq Stock Market, you should complete and submit the enclosed physical voting instruction form or an online voting instruction form (at www.proxyvote.com) in order to direct your broker, trustee or nominee how to vote your shares. Your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on Wednesday, September 7, 2022 to be validly implemented and reflected in the tally of ordinary shares voted at the Meeting.\n\n•\n\nIf you are a beneficial owner who holds ordinary shares through a member of the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange, or TASE, you may vote your shares in person at the Meeting by presenting a certificate signed by the TASE Clearing House member through which the shares are held, which complies with the Israel Companies Regulations (Proof of Ownership for Voting in General Meetings)-2000 as proof of ownership of the shares. You may instead send that certificate, along with a duly executed proxy (in the form to be filed by us on MAGNA, the distribution site of the Israeli Securities Authority, or ISA, at www.magna.isa.gov.il), to our Legal Advisor or VP Legal Affairs & Company Secretary at our Company’s registered offices, including via email, to the address or email addresses for those individuals provided above. Those items must be received by us no later than six (6) hours prior to the appointed time of the Meeting for your votes to be counted. In the alternative, you may vote your shares through the electronic voting system set up by the ISA for shareholder meetings of Israeli companies whose shares are listed on the TASE, via the MAGNA online platform. Voting your shares through that system requires that you first undergo a registration process. Your vote must be submitted in that manner no later than six (6) hours before the time fixed for the Meeting. You should receive instructions about electronic voting from the TASE member through which you hold your shares."
