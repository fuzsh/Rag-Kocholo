The group's military spokesman said it had fired naval missiles at the Star Nasia and Morning Tide, identifying the Marshall Islands and Barbados-flagged ships, respectively, as American and British.\n\n6 months ago\n\nSaudi Arabia rules out diplomatic relations with Israel without an independent Palestinian state\n\nSaudi Arabia has told the U.S. its position is firm that there will be no diplomatic relations with Israel unless an independent Palestinian state is recognized on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem, and Israeli \"aggression\" on the Gaza Strip stops, the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe Saudi statement was in response to U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby's comments earlier in the day, after he said normalization efforts and a hostage deal are \"two different things\" and not ostensibly linked.\n\n6 months ago\n\nU.S. House fails to pass GOP effort to provide Israel with $17b in standalone aid\n\nWASHINGTON – The U.S. House rejected Republican efforts to pass a standalone bill providing Israel with over $17 billion in emergency aid to Israel amid cross-party criticism and staunch opposition from the White House.\n\nThe vote failed by a total of 250 votes to 180, with 46 Democrats voting in favor — 40 votes short of the necessary two-thirds required to move the bill to the Senate. Fourteen Republicans voted against, and one failed to vote.\n\nEven if it advanced, however, the bill would have had zero chance of advancing given Senate Democrats' insistence that Israel aid be included in U.S. President Joe Biden's national security supplemental aid package, which includes over $14 billion in Israel aid. Biden further warned he would veto the standalone bill if it managed to reach his desk, illustrating the unrealistic nature of the bill ever advancing.\n\nSee full story.\n\n6 months ago\n\nSyrian opposition: Three people killed in strikes on Homs\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that three people were killed in an attack attributed to Israel in Homs, including a woman and a child. The center, which is affiliated with the Syrian opposition, also announced that seven other people were wounded in the attack, which it said targeted areas where there the Syrian army and Hezbollah are both deployed.\n\n6 months ago\n\nBlinken lands in Israel for meetings with Israeli, Palestinian leaders\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Israel to discuss ongoing hostage negotiations, Israel's war in Gaza and the worsening humanitarian crisis, post-war planning and the role potential normalization can play in matters moving forward.\n\nBlinken, currently on his fifth trip to the Middle East since October 7, landed in Israel after stops in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar. This is the second trip in a row where Blinken has visited the other countries prior to Israel, an itinerary choice aimed at bolstering Blinken's messaging with points gleaned from Arab leaders directly preceding his visit.\n\nDuring his visit, he will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, IDF chief Herzl Halevy, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and President Isaac Herzog, before travelling to Ramallah to meet Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. He will give a press briefing in the evening.\n\nClick here for full story.\n\n6 months ago\n\nSyrian sources report explosion in Homs, state media blames 'Israeli aggression'\n\nAn Israeli \"aggression\" targeted Syria's Homs, Syrian state media reported on Tuesday. Syrian air defenses shot down a number of missiles, it added.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that more than nine explosions were heard in the Homs region.\n\n6 months ago\n\nSenior Hamas official says they delayed response to hostage deal because many issues were 'unclear, ambiguous'\n\nA senior Hamas official said that they delayed their response to the hostage deal framework because many issues were \"unclear and ambiguous.\" The official also said that Hamas is interested in releasing the largest number of Palestinian prisoners that it can, and added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to \"make everyone believe that he has or will achieve victory to preserve his coalition agreement.\"\n\n6 months ago\n\nWall Street Journal: About 50 hostages held by Hamas may have been killed since the beginning of war\n\nFollowing a similar report in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that 50 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza may have been killed since October 7, \"a figure that is considerably higher than the 29 deaths Israel has publicly acknowledged,\" the report says.\n\nAccording to Egyptian officials, Israeli officials presented these estimates to their counterparts in the U.S. and Egypt during talks in Cairo, and they were discussed at length as part of the effort to obtain a hostage deal."
