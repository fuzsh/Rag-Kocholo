        "text": "o\n\nOur microbial gene database incorporates more than 250 million microbial genes. In our pursuit to expand our databases to include novel genetic material, we established a pipeline for assembling gene models from samples containing bacterial populations, or metagenomics. Utilizing this approach, we have unveiled millions of genes, some of which have never been observed before, as well as a multitude of bacteria never previously cultured.\n\n◾\n\nDevelopment: This phase is usually divided into Development Stage 1, resulting with a “Lead”, and Development Stage 2, resulting with a “Pre-Product”. In this phase, the fermentation and formulation procedures are further optimized to allow for further testing and validation of efficacy and stability in the field as well as for commercial scale production, addressing cost of good targets and compatibility with other agricultural inputs. Based on industry benchmarks and our estimates, this stage typically lasts approximately 24 months.\n\n◾\n\nPre-commercialization: In this phase, extensive field tests are undertaken to demonstrate the effectiveness of product candidates in enhancing the target trait, including production of data to support product positioning. Additional activities towards launch are performed, including packaging development, upscale manufacturing protocol, registration and regulation. Based on industry benchmarks and our estimates, in the U.S. we expect this stage to last approximately 24 months for bio-stimulants and 36-48 months for bio-pesticides due to longer regulation processes.\n\n◾\n\nIn the final development phases, new chemical products are registered with the proper regulatory authorities and then launched for commercialization. According to publications of key industry players, such development processes are likely to last 5-8 years. We expect that these last stages of development will be conducted by our current and future collaboration partners or by our customers.\n\n◾\n\nPhase I, or “Proof of Concept”: Validated candidate genetic elements are advanced to Phase I. In this phase, they are tested in target plants through greenhouse trials, field trials, or both, for their efficacy in improving plant performance. During this phase, the genetic elements are also optimized to improve their efficacy. Phase I may be conducted by us or by our collaborators, and in our experience, may last up to six years.\n\n◾\n\nPhase II, or “Early Development”: In this phase, the field tests are expanded, and our collaborators evaluate the genetic elements on multiple geographical locations and varieties, to reach commercially viable success rates. By the end of this phase, a specific product candidate is being selected to advance to Phase III. We estimate Phase II to last between two to four years.\n\n◾\n\namortization over an eight-year period of the cost of purchased know-how and patents and rights to use a patent and know-how which are used for the development or advancement of the Industrial Enterprise, commencing in the year in which such rights were first exercised;\n\n(3)\n\nConsists of amounts recognized as non-cash expenses in our statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 in respect of option grants.
