I think this is an amazing and exciting project.z\n\nI have started to map the area inside and around Weizmann Institute of Science (where I live), as well as Ness-Ziona - both of these are very poorly mapped right now.\n\nThanks to all the people involved!\n\ndimka\n\nHey Dimka,\n\nnice that we have somebody starting in this area.\n\nIts proven, that you can achive the best mapping, if you live in the area you do the mapping for.\n\nI would be great if you keep us update in this discussion board for your mapping.\n\nHave fun\n\nHi Yaad!\n\nI am half way of mapping the Neve Hadar neighborhood. I have also uploaded several tracks in Lev Hamoshava, Savionei Nezer Sireni and Giv’at Nof neighborhoods, as well as Tirat Hashalom and Kfar Aharon, but didn’t have the time to map these yet.\n\nSo it would be great if you could start with some other neighborhood so that we can finish the whole city more quickly.\n\nYou are also welcome to review my changes so far, and add streets based on my tracks.\n\nI plan to record tracks on a regular basis.\n\nCheers!\n\ndimka"
