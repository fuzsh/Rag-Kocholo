She received her education at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as well as the Slade School of Fine Art, London. Since 2003 Maya Golds’ works were presented in solo and group exhibitions in Israel and the United States.\\r\\nMaya Gold‘s paintings we sometimes observe a grid of horizontal and vertical lines. This grid, reminiscent of a painterly apparatus meant to aid artists in organizing their canvas, is brought in Gold‘s paintings to the fore. Rather than disappear behind the painting‘s surface, it is suggested by the objects and landscapes on view. This somewhat playful materialization of the painting‘s scaffolding may also imply that the realm represented therein has willingly succumbed to the rules of the perspectival net cast over it.(…)\\r\\nMost of all, in Gold‘s paintings it is a flat, cleverly structured sfumato of clouds that hinders the materialization of an accountable universe. Whether hinted at by their ominous shadows cast on firm ground or watery surfaces, or suggested by their reflection in glass; or whether painted directly — as in the thick nebulous formation enveloping two lonely ship masts above a stormy sea — it is often the clouds that are at the basis of both the doing and undoing of what is encrypted in the paintings. Thus, even a series of fantastic views in different shades, with sparse clouds hanging above an idyllic lake, offers less of a romantic escapade and more of an equivocal yet melancholic play on the reversibility of planes\",\n\n\"about\": \"In his first solo show at Sommer Contemporary Art, American artist Lyle Ashton Harris will exhibit a new series of photomontages and a select set of recent chromogenic prints from his Archive series exploring intersections of the personal and the political. Harris is known internationally for his diverse artistic practice, ranging from photographic media, collage, installation and performance, which examine the contemporary impact of ethnicity, gender and desire across multiple social and cultural spheres.\\r\\n Twenty-two chromogenic prints selected from Harris’s personal archive of 35mm Ektachrome color reversal slides that capture intimate moments among the artist’s close circle throughout the 1980s and 1990s will be shown, spanning locales from New York and Los Angeles to London, Berlin and Rome. Among those portrayed are notable artists, writers and filmmakers, including Nan Goldin, Isaac Julian, Renée Cox, Essex Hemphill, and Iké Udé, in addition to candid self-portraits of Harris himself. As a unique document of the late 20th century life, these works bear witness to fleeting moments throughout a period of seismic shifts across the social, political and artistic landscape, with the emergence of multiculturalism and nascent globalization, the second wave of AIDS activism, and the imbrication of the contemporary art scene with LGBT and African diaspora communities, the expanded impact of which is felt worldwide.\\r\\n The exhibition will also include six large photomontages comprised of dense image clusters—juxtaposing media images, art historical references, political and entertainment figures, unique Polaroid prints, newspaper clippings, and re-photographed images of the artist’s works among other personal ephemera—evoke complex, layered associations excavated from collective memory. These striking new pieces emerged from a set of collage studies originally developed by Harris to explore the African Baroque, published in the catalogue of “Nero su Bianco”, a 2015 exhibition exploring contemporary and historical cross-currents of Italian and African influence, co-curated by Harris, fellow artist and critic Robert Storr, and Peter Benson Miller at the American Academy in Rome.\\r\\n By exhibiting this recent series of photomontages in conjunction with the Ektachrome Archive, Harris seeks to evoke a space in which temporalities collide, disrupting notions of history and memory as mere repositories, while activating their potential to reimagine a multiplicity of narrative readings.\\r\\n Harris was featured in the Project Room of Sommer Contemporary Art in 2015 with “Mapping Desire”, a selection of photographs spanning 1996-2014.\",\n\n\"about\": \"Pleased to announce Elad Rosen's first solo exhibition at Rosenfeld gallery. Rosen, recipient of the Ministry of Culture and Sport’s Young Artist prize of 2015, will show recent paintings that rely on a playful, childlike aesthetic. The paintings are inspired by the video games of the 80's, a virtual space that was as real and intense as any other tangible landscape of Rosen's childhood. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe different works present a repetitive imagery that deals in slapstick, dark humor and an excess of emotion. Limbs, faces, fruit and geometric shapes form together popy, expressive and misleading compositions, where the sweet, joyful appearance turns into a grotesque and terrifying one. A face that seems at first glance to be naïve becomes a disturbing Pinocchio, in an emotional exaggeration that is hard to take seriously and yet is impossible to resist. \\r\\n\\r\\nPleased to announce Karam Natour's exhibition: \\\"Following No Mythologies\\\" that will inaugurate the \\\"Rosy\\\", the new project room at the gallery. In his exhibition Karam is presenting a new series of about 20 digital drawings that were made during the previous year by Jester.\\r\\n\\r\\nJester is the name of an entity that shares the same physical body with the artist, but functions according to a complete different set of mental constructions. This entity, Jester, is the one that created the series of works that are shown in the exhibition. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe drawings often portray a nude male figure that resembles the artist himself being positioned in certain situations that create the narrative in the drawing. The physical presence of the body is a recurring motif in Jester’s works, emphasizing on the allegorical connotations that the physical body has. Jester often approaches the figure of the artist in his drawing with cynicism, humor, playfulness, and sarcasm.\",\n\n\"about\": \"Noga Gallery is delighted to present sculptures and paintings by Chanan de Lange created in 2013-2015.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe exhibition’s title alludes to an in-between state, the elusive moment between darkness and light, when the sky is still blue but the landscape is getting darker, like the in-between that exists in de Lange’s artworks throughout his artistic career. Since his graduation and throughout his work as a designer, planner, architect, de Lange engages in a profound dialogue with visual art.\\r\\n \\r\\nMarcel Duchamp created a distinction between the “ready-made” and “objet trouvé” (found object), which the artist discovers and chooses due to its singular qualities. The ready-made is usually one object of many, produced in mass assembly line, a nondescript object. Andre Breton defined the ready-made as “an industrial object elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist”.\\r\\n \\r\\nChanan de Lange’s studio houses hundreds or thousands of ready-made parts alongside items collected over the years with love and care, objects with past and history, with cultural values of their own and very specific associations to the life of de Lange, which serve as a reservoir of memories, or as the painter’s palette.\\r\\n \\r\\nChanan de Lange is a Dadaist artist, the spirit and freedom of Dada artist is blowing between his works, characterized by a playful and tongue in cheek tone. Marcel Duchamp had said: “I enjoy looking at the bicycle wheel, it has a pleasing and comforting aspect”. De Lange’s pleasure in the creation process, the freedom with which he operates, breathes life, forms relationships, re-creates, creates two and three dimensional works, full of humor, movement, and imagination. The connection between the different elements forms a new syntax that imbues them with fresh, personal and universal meanings.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe exhibition also includes works on canvas originating in curtains, in some of the canvases there is a use of light. The works on canvas, like the sculptures, stress the engagement with liminal moments, and correspond in a different manner with that hinted in-between.\\r\\n \\r\\nProfessor Chanan de Lange graduated with honors from Bezalel Department of Industrial Design. He has been an active designer since 1985 and a teacher at Bezalel since 1988. He served in the past as head of Bezalel Industrial Design Bachelor’s Degree program and (1992-1995) and Bezalel Industrial Design Master’s Degree program (2006-2007). An associate professor since 2003 and a professor since 2008.\",\n\n\"authorDescription\": \"Born in Ramat Hasharon, 1984.\\r\\nLives and works in Tel Aviv.\\r\\n “Artistic practice for me is a process of transformation and a complete disconnection from any aim”\\r\\nIn his work, Goldman combines asphalt, chemical laboratory materials, plant roots, and readymade objects with electronic equipment, LED lights and sound sensors. His work process challenges conventional techniques and materials, implementing experiments that stretch the boundaries of the media in which he works. \\r\\nIt is the encounter with the materials, the dynamic work process, and the transformations that occur in the work from the formulation of the concept to the finished object, that fascinate Goldman and constitute the heart of his artistic practice.\\r\\nIn his work process, Goldman uses drawing as a point of departure for translating images that capture his imagination into the visual dimension. Henceforth, the original meaning of the images becomes fluid and they undergo a transformation that develops them into objects.\\r\\nIn his installations Goldman uses loudspeakers that emit sounds that have been recorded and processed from the environments in which he lives and works. Like the visual images in his work, which are composed of both memories and random daily encounters, the sounds can also be either recordings of voices from Goldman’s autobiographical past, from the natural environment, or sounds created during the installation’s development.\\r\\nThe sound sensors, the lighting and the organic materials and unique sound that make up the work come together to form a unit with an inner engine, an engine that feeds on energy and on acts of conversion and transformation. The resulting rhythms that accompany the site-specific installations connect the objects in the space, while the loudspeakers serve as a kind of sound box for the creative process itself.\\r\\n \\r\\nGoldman regards art as a testing ground for researching relationships in reality, proposing an alternative underlain by optimism and naïveté, a natural habitat for new continents.\",\n\n\"about\": \"In his first solo exhibition at Sommer Contemporary Art, Croatian artist David Maljković continues to explore the erosion of time and the corruption of information through a layering of formal investigations.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe exhibition follows a mirroring logic, in which manipulated images repeat in different constellations and media. On the two central polls of the gallery, two slide projectors rattle. The first is projecting In Low Resolution (2014) – a rotation of 40 slides, taken from the artist's personal archive and depicting his earlier works and installations. The images are manipulated, so that the quality of specific objects and areas are reduced to large indiscernible pixels.\\r\\n \\r\\nOne of the slides, showing a hand trying to catch a floating white pixelated object, is projected, still and isolated, on the second poll. Called Afterform (2013), this image is indeed chasing its various forms, as it is translated again in to wallpapers. These function as backgrounds for two large collages, made of photographs documenting various creative stages of Maljković’s works, laid on top of one another. Their title - New Reproduction (2013), enfolds a temporal paradox. Through digital editing, decollaging, covering and hiding, the artist reactivates his previous works in a kind of a timeline gone-bad. These scrambled hyper-images are framed by KODAK professional quality-control printing scales, as if they were printing tests. Two other wallpapers are in fact over-sized installation shots of Maljković’s 2014 show at the Palais de Tokyo, called 'In Low Resolution'. Rather than transforming the gallery space, they function as ghosts from a former installation.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn a complex play of dislocation and reversed time, Maljković now uses the wallpaper's two-dimensional image of a white empty screen as a projection space for a new version of his famous video work, Out of Projection (2009-2014). Filmed at the test track of Peugeot headquarters in the French city of Sochaux, it shows elderly people walking around the track, along side futurist cars models designed in the 1980-2000s. The image is blurred and the movement is slowed down to suggest a dream-like aesthetic or surveillance footage. The people are actual retired Peugeot workers, some visiting the carefully guarded track for the first time. Their bodies act as a temporal division, while the car models, which now seem as if they were taken from an old sci-fi film, are stranded in a limbo of outdated futures. On a different wall, covered by the same wallpaper, a still from the original film is shown. Here, Maljković stopped the printing of the image before the heads of the figures were injected onto the paper, thus creating headless specters.\\r\\n \\r\\nMaljković’s work deals with formalist concerns through highly controlled variants. While narrative is the driving element of his projects, the artist’s varied means of visual implementation challenge the supremacy of the story. Construction within a set of formal directives encrypts the narrative and postulates what Maljković describes \\\"a new semantic logic\\\". In aesthetic terms, his practice can be described as existing between form and content, or signifier and signified - in linguistic terms. It is within these dynamics that Maljković negotiates his formal methods and disjunctive intentions.\",\n\n\"about\": \"Science tells us that dark matter is a mysterious unseen force that comprises most of the universe. So far immeasurable, it has a powerful effect on that which is visible and known. The creative process is somewhat analogous in that it is presumed, but also unseen, yet impacts the physical world, making the invisible, visible. \\r\\nThis gathering came about in an attempt to present several artists who follow an intuitive, sometimes aggressive approach in the making of art. While formal references may abound and others foist upon them, all the works possess an organic origin, often unfathomable. \\r\\nNot too long ago the paintings of Elad Kopler were vast scenes of destruction and upheaval rendered in a combination of the recognizable and the abstract. The beautifully painted surfaces and abstracted passages obscured darker themes that reflected a very real physical experience. Recent work has seen a reduction, a distillation that excises the narrative and focuses on color, shape and line that goes to the abstract core of the composition. In a very real way he has found the path literally and figuratively ‘out of the rubble’ and into pure painting.\\r\\nPainter, sculptor, photographer, installation and performance artist Robert Melee’s work is not comprised of disparate elements, but is a holistic approach to the making of art. The work is always self-referential and complex. The bottle cap paintings, a series the artist first began in 1999, have become signature works. The kitsch elements of the beer bottle caps are interwoven with plaster, enamel, paint creating an undulating surface. The resultant abstraction provides a meditative mandala effect that transcends the humble materials.\\r\\nThe ethereal paintings of Ted Pim reference old master portraiture. He began his painting career creating mural-scale works in the dark recesses of abandoned breweries, factories and schools, places where few, if any, got the chance to experience the work. The distorted physiognomies rendered in ghostly tonalities emerge from a nearly black expanse to create a poetic, almost funereal imagery, channeling Goya and Francis Bacon.\\r\\n\\r\\nGabriel J. Shuldiner re-purposes the detritus of the world around us, bending, coaxing, twisting and forcing found and discarded objects and materials into a new existence. A pseudo-trademarked amalgam of black pigments called ‘postapocalypticBLACK’ is Shuldiner’s secret ingredient in his alchemical process of turning base matter into a more precious substance. Despite the overriding insistence of the color black, the surfaces have a painterly quality, alternating between matte and sheen and sometimes injected with a tiny shock of fluorescent color. The works move between monolithic statements of form to more free-flowing, seemingly fragile elements.\",\n\n\"about\": \"Urbanism is with-out a doubt one of the most important and influential phenomena of the twentieth and twenty first centuries. Artists, poets, writers, and philosophers are attracted to urbanism while channeling their fascination of this age to an active dialogue, a process of change in urban form which becomes a part of an artistic act.\\r\\nThe exhibition features a collection of works which embody these trends of observing and exploring the urban space, alongside with critique about our environment. The works in the show, by Liat Livni and Amir Tomashov, represent the current urban space in the age of globalization and the local social-political surroundings.\\r\\nAmir Tomashov’s works deal with criticism over our urban surroundings that were constructed in a repetitive, schematic way and lacking an architectural identity. Tomashov works in a similar way to an architect by using a reversal and multi-layered technique to dismantle the surface only to rebuild it again with a deference. While using a technique of sketching and paper stencil, he reveals more than the eye can see, this enhances the connection between architecture and art, together with using ‘Ready-Made’ such as old book covers and leftover wood from the street. In recent years the city which Tomashov lives and works is under a construction momentum, and he involves this in his work together with local architecture.\\r\\nLiat Livni is an artist who often deals with simple, disposable materials that lack any artistic aura such as paper and wood. With these she creates urban structures and landscape that bring together nature and culture. Following an artist residency in Taiwan, Livni created the series of works Windows of Modernity (2012) as a paraphrase on traditional wooden curved windows. Inside the objects, which were made of sand and glue, are mundane images of skyscrapers, industrial buildings, cable car and more. At first it seems that Livni follows a traditional approach in her work, but a closer look reveals complexity of destruction of the old world in favor of progress and western technology. Another work in the exhibition, Reading (2016), also deals with this duality, depicting the mythological Tel Aviv power station, once an urban symbol of air pollution, which has now become a green public space. \\r\\nIt seems that the fast changing reality, influenced by enormous economic and technological powers, effects on the way artists deal with their work. In a dynamic era that accelerate production, artists seek a way to involve their work with processes of urban construction and demolition in a new found boundaries. \\r\\nCurator: Meital Manor\",\n\n\"authorDescription\": \"Liat Livni\\r\\nAfter her stay in Taiwan, Liat Livni, an artist who often uses simple, perishable materials such as paper and wood, created the series “Windows of Modernity” (2012) as a paraphrase of the traditional carved wooden windows that are rapidly disappearing as the culture shifts and older buildings are destroyed to make way for new ones. Composed of sand, cardboard and gluing materials, the objects incorporate within them contemporary images including skyscrapers, industrial structures and a cable car. The artist, who appears at first glance to be maintaining tradition, deals with the destruction of the traditional world in favor of Western technological progress.\\r\\nAmir Tomashov\\r\\nCreating a non-place realm of imaginary experiences, Amir Tomashov presents a series of “architectural landscapes” - models, collages and sketches merging constructivist and deconstructivist dynamics crashing in space and speed. Far from the professional practice of the architect-builder, Tomashov researchs urban anatomies with a clinical look. He thinks in an utopian way FOR space, as if space had to be cared for, or even saved. As if our spatial experience was in imminent danger of being swallowed by an invisible force. Globalization erases memory, hence it erases Time and Space, as both experiences interact through our ability to remember. Tomashov’s ideal cities are far from being romantic. They project us, naked, into a post atomic cosmos of never-ending wandering, where ruined bits and pieces of cities and buildings do not offer any place to rest. Utopia meets apocalypse, thus becoming dystopia. Brutal, violent, and still, entirely redeemed by the power of poetry - the poetry of Amir’s artistic technique: a brilliant capacity for mixing media in blowing compositions, combining high-tech, architecture and craft into conceptual models, into pieces of dream - into pieces of art.\",\n\n\"about\": \"Curator: Leah Abir\\r\\n1.\\tAll the Treadmills are Desperate\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\tThe Flat Diamond Café\\r\\n\\r\\nNir Segal's solo show marks a pivotal point in his artistic research during the last two years, conducted in the framework of his PhD studies at the Slade, London. The two works exhibited in this show stem from the investigation of one concept – \\\"The Flat Diamond\\\" – which stands at the core of the artist's practice and work in recent years. \\\"The Flat Diamond\\\" is a discursive term that is spread by word of mouth, acquiring meaning and context by its receivers through conversations, actions and hearsay. What exactly is this \\\"Flat Diamond\\\"? The many answers to this question are being accumulated with time, in a process that separates this potential object from its different possible narratives and myths of creation, existence and meaning.\\r\\nThe title of the show, \\\"Two Work,\\\" marks a duality inherent in this presentation – two works, two floors, collaboration between two artists and conversations between two people. The first work, All the Treadmills are Desperate, is shown at the gallery's main space in the 4th floor. It was produced, designed and programmed as an invitation for visitors to engage in conversation under specific conditions. Described by Segal as a \\\"conversation machine,\\\" this work is the outcome of a collaboration with choreographer and dancer Oded Graf, who is the artistic director of the international \\\"Yossi Berg and Oded Graf Dance Theater.\\\" \\r\\nThe second work, The Flat Diamond Café, is situated at the first floor of the same building. Similarly to \\\"All the Treadmills are Desperate,\\\" \\\"The Flat Diamond Café,\\\" might also be described as an installation with performative elements. 2 floors beneath the gallery space, Segal designed a small Café named after the thematic enigma of the flat diamond, in which he is hosting visitors throughout the show's opening hours, inviting them for coffee and initiating one-on-one conversations. \\r\\nBoth works displayed in this exhibition are based on duration and process. They function as visual and conceptual frameworks for a content that is slowly building up in action. They both focus on storytelling techniques and collaborative models, challenging them by introducing different rules and conditions, assigning a big role to the potential or actual actions of the viewer/visitor.\\r\\nThe exhibition is supported by: Maccabee Beer, Energym Sports, Electronit, Retro TLV, The Girls Like Food, Blumenwood, and Espresso Club, Yaya Productions\\r\\nSound Design: Shasho\",\n\n\"about\": \"There is nothing conventional about a performance of Ohtoh Olahm (English translation: The Same World). Neither the mixture of the instruments, nor the sound, or the execution of the Israeli and English language songs. The performance moves along serendipitously, like a conversation between friends who have met up for a drink in a bar. When they talk they know not where their talk will take them—not what about, and not with what edge. \\r\\nA performance of Ohtoh Olahm is a conversation among three people--Pesach, Avi, and Gabi—which by chance happens in the presence of an audience.\\r\\nThe planning is the necessary minimum, to meet at a time and place. Content and presentation take shape spontaneously in real time. Dialogue is built, or collapses, in accordance with the mood of the moment. There are no rehearsals. They meet only for the sound check the evening of the performance. This garners for the sound of Ohtoh Olahm an unexpected accumulative abstract materiality, forming a single work which moves toward infinity.\\r\\nThey have been playing together since 2009, with a fluid schedule of performances, avoiding definition or categorization of their type of music. \\r\\nPesach stands in the middle. He plays his vocal chords, and on a percussion instrument, a “bell tree” from Pakistan, which he acquired in Michigan. He also plays a recorder and a theremin (an electronic instrument). Gabi is to Pesach’s left. He uses a computer and a groove box. On the right, Avi plays an electric guitar. \\r\\nGabi drives the groove and defines the texture of the sound, which provides the ground for Pesach’s singing, or speech, or reading. Avi adds the backbeats, everything that is below the surface. Gabi determines the language and the sound of the “conversation”. Pesach determines the continuity, the tone, the verbal component, and the abstract nuances. Avi gives the grammar, the punctuation, and the emphases.\\r\\nIn their meeting, the slow, dark and hazy electronic sound, and Pesach’s high vocalizing, strike a conscious distance from anything that could be called harmonic, or expected, or beautiful. The freedom with which Ohtoh Olahm uses known songs, some better known and some less, disassembles them and then remakes them into something new, and it makes their performance into something strange and at the same time nonchalant, by its chance quality. Pesach makes a collage out of texts which he “cuts and pastes”. Sometimes he sings a song and sometimes he speaks it. He may begin with Hamburger Girl by the Linus Pauling Quartet. He may follow with Rikdi (Dance) by Yishai Levi, giving it monotonic repetition, and then conclude with Chuck Berry’s Rock and Roll Music. The improvisation breaks up the normal hierarchy of voice and accompaniment. It enables the members of the group to literally go out and return as it suits them. (The same applies to the listeners\\\\spectators.) If one of them gets up of a sudden the performance continues without him. When he returns he reenters the flow.\\r\\nAlthough the three artists come from the same world, each, in his art, has different questions. Such it is in the exhibition. There is no pretense of an invented connection which is forced on the art. Taking place in that space between painting, drawing, sculpture, performance and object, the exhibition is an attempt to adopt the unique dynamic of a performance of Ohtoh Olahm and apply it to the emplacement of the objects in the gallery space. The curatorial endeavor lies in the combining of elements itself. It adopts the free values of improvisation, which occasionally are tasteless or fragmentary. The three-headed assemblage created in the space is anti-monumental. It is replete with both the inter-breeding and the contradiction between art and craft, between the two- and the three-dimensional, between movement and stasis. \\r\\nThe group has entrusted their anti-monumental sound to a fourth party, who is not party to their concept “platoon”, someone capable of observing the phenomenon from an outer vantage point. Shay-Lee Uziel has made a work especially for this exhibition, an extended video clip which is screened again and again, continuously. It combines anachronistic hi-tech esthetics with the electro-magnetic avant-garde. This audio-visual collage replaces the live performance which does not take place in the exhibition.\\r\\nCurator: Tali Ben-Nun\\r\\nMusical closing Event will take place on Saturday - 14/5/16 at 19:30\",\n\n\"about\": \"Sea of Tears // Tali Tamir\\r\\nKhen Shish's Tunisian Bride, much like the bride in the well-known play by Nissim Aloni, joins an age-old array of brides who have dressed in their most elegant wedding gowns and as their veil fluttered above them, they fled from the altar to the mythical world of the archetypical bride. This bride, whose groom has never presented himself at her altar (and not the one who ran from her groom in Lorca's \\\"Blood Wedding\\\" – is somewhat of a tricky creature: abandoned and miserable on the one hand, yet at the same time – powerful, independent, and free. \\r\\nThe Tunisian Bride starring in Khen Shish's pink-black-golden painting, representing herself, is washed away by an ocean of tears; up in flames like a martyr, while simultaneously she grows to monumental dimensions, bedecked as befit to a Byzantine queen, she sprouts scorpion's pincers or peacock's wings. Khen rejects gracefulness: her image of the bride has become a ritual hybrid of man/animal, bride/bird of prey, pecking (perhaps) at her groom's liver. The primary pink space of her paintings, saccharine and flowing with hearts, is covered up by a rain of black tears and a flock of sharp-beaked eagles. \\r\\nThe tears receive quite a dramatic empowerment: if in Picasso's \\\"The Weeping Woman\\\" (1937) the tears are enlarged and have a crystal-like presence, in Shish's case, the tears are thick cardboard cutouts glued onto the scenic fabric, gaining a tangible, three-dimensional presence. \\\"An ocean of tears in my two eyes / my heart calls out return to me\\\" – Zohar Argov, the king of Middle Eastern song, sings dramatically to the words of Zmira Chen. \\r\\nIn her previous exhibition, Khen Shish's art spoke of a broken heart calling out for its disappeared lover to return. In the current exhibition, the heart is presented in place of the head, and the tears join in a Bacchanal circle dance. Is the Middle Eastern characteristic of Khen Shish – \\\"The Tunisian\\\" – not looking at the emotional dramatization with the eyes of irony? Maybe even with humor and an implied wink? Perhaps not the tears, but rather the black eyes of the bride/painter, similar to the darkened eyes of the Middle Eastern girls painted by Gutman and Rubin in the twenties – are the key to the charcoal morbidity of these paintings. \\r\\nDuring the time spent working on the \\\"Tunisian Bride\\\" series, Khen Shish consciously corresponded with the Moroccan bride appearing in Eugene Delacroix's \\\"Jewish Wedding\\\", painted in 1839. The Moroccan wedding did in fact take place in the city of Tangier, in Morocco, on the February 21st, 1832, and the Parisian painter, charmed by the veiled East revealed to him, documents in his journal in precise detail the shadows, the whiteness of the sleeves, the darkness of the eyes, the beauty of the bride's face, the purple and gold tones of the fabrics, and finally the sunlight lighting falling on the wall. Not a word about the groom. Same is the case in Breughel's Wedding Party, where the groom is left out of the frame. Only in Rembrandt's \\\"Jewish Bride\\\" does the groom appear beside his bride as he gently places his hand on hers… In Kafka's work we find the groom \\\"standing alone, leaning on the door, looking outside\\\", while the bride \\\"stood amidst friends and acquaintances\\\" at the peak of the engagement celebration held \\\"on a nice warm evening in the month of June\\\". Kafka himself, an \\\"insubordinate groom\\\", will always find a way out of marital life, will eventually roll into the body of an insect and will play the role of the inner horror of rejection and incompatibility, compensated by the freedom of creation. \\r\\nDizzied by the whirling sensation of creation, Khen Shish's Tunisian Bride stands tall and beautifully black eyed, as she rises up in her own flames into the space of painting and imagination. A flock of ravens flutters around her, and the groom disappears in a cloud of smoke.\","
