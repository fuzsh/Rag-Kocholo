        "text": "Two more Hamas martyrs over the weekend. Pass the candy!\n\nOver the weekend, this 22 year old Hamas member, Ibrahim Hamada Majaydeh, supposedly died of \"natural causes.\"\n\nOn a beach in Khan Younis.\n\nHealthy young man hanging out ar the beach and dropping dead. Sounds perfectly kosher to me.\n\nAlso over the weekend, this upstanding Hamas member electrocuted himself in a terror tunnel.\n\nMohammed Khamis Shalluf was 26 years old and died from electric shock in a tunnel in Rafah, which probably means that Hamas is still trying to smuggle weapons from Egypt.\n\nIf all deaths are tragic, these are a bit less tragic than the others.\n\nWe have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective. Please donate today to help get the message out and to help defend Israel.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n08/15 Links Pt2: Be ready to defend Israel on campus; Friends Don’t Let Friends Vote for Jill Stein\n\nFrom Ian:\n\nNGO Monitor: Soros Documents Highlight Irresponsible and Unaccountable Funding to Political NGOs\n\nOn August 14, a number of leaked documents from the Open Society Foundations – a political framework funded by George Soros – were posted anonymously on the DC Leaks website. The material covered many different aspects of this activity around the world. For background information on OSF and other Soros funding mechanisms, see Bad Investment: The Philanthropy of George Soros and the Arab-Israeli Conflict (How Soros-funded Groups Increase Tensions in a Troubled Region), Alexander H. Joffe and Gerald M. Steinberg, NGO Monitor, 2013.\n\nOSF’s declared objective is “to work to build vibrant and tolerant democracies whose governments are accountable and open to the participation of all people.” This is the basis for OSF’s often intrusive activities in both closed and democratic societies, including large scale funding of political NGOs.\n\nA number of these as yet unverified documents deal with OSF’s grants to political NGOs through its “Arab Regional Office (ARO) – Palestinian Citizens of Israel” department. Headed by Ammar Abu Zayyad, the ARO is one of a number of funding mechanisms for Israeli and Palestinian NGO’s in the OSF network.\n\nThe secrecy and lack of transparency inherent in the OSF’s activities is highlighted in the ARO documents: “For a variety of reasons, we wanted to construct a diversified portfolio of grants dealing with Israel and Palestine, funding both Israeli Jewish and PCI (Palestinian Citizens of Israel) groups as well as building a portfolio of Palestinian grants and in all cases to maintain a low profile and relative distance—particularly on the advocacy front.”\n\nSoros email hack reveals plans to fight ‘racist’ Israeli policies\n\nHacked emails show that the Open Society Foundations led by Jewish billionaire George Soros have as an objective “challenging Israel’s racist and anti-democratic policies” in international forums, in part by questioning Israel’s reputation as a democracy.\n\nThe documents are available on a website, reportedly backed by Russia, that uses anti-Semitic stereotypes to attack Soros.\n\nThey reveal that Open Society, which was founded and is chaired by the hedge fund billionaire and philanthropist, gave nearly $10 million since 2001 to groups advancing the rights of Arab Israelis, with an emphasis in recent years on countering what one document says are Israel’s “restrictive measures” against minorities.\n\n“In recent years the radicalization of public opinion and consecutive Israeli right-wing governments have resulted in more restrictive measures against Palestinians within Israel,” a Sept. 1, 2015 review of Open Society’s Arab Regional Office’s work said.\n\nIt cites as an example the Jewish Nation State bill, advanced by its sponsors to entrench Israel’s Jewish status, but decried by some Arab Israelis as further marginalizing non-Jewish minorities. The bill has yet to pass.\n\nAmong achievements listed in the document, the Arab Regional Office includes increased advocacy by “Palestinian citizens of Israel,” or PCI, in international forums, challenging Israel’s “racist” policies in the face of its reputation as a democracy.\n\nGeorge Soros funds Ferguson protests, hopes to spur civil action\n\nThere’s a solitary man at the financial center of the Ferguson protest movement. No, it’s not victim Michael Brown or Officer Darren Wilson. It’s not even the Rev. Al Sharpton, despite his ubiquitous campaign on TV and the streets.\n\nRather, it’s liberal billionaire George Soros, who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in Europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts American politics and policy, not unlike what he did with MoveOn.org.\n\nMr. Soros spurred the Ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the U.S., according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by The Washington Times.\n\nIn all, Mr. Soros gave at least $33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in Ferguson, according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations.\n\nFriends Don’t Let Friends Vote for Jill Stein\n\nStein’s claim that Clinton-esque neoliberal policies somehow had anything to do with Nazism was not only ahistorical and nonsensical, it cheapened the Holocaust to make a dishonest political point.\n\nBut casting Nazi aspersions on the Clintons and doubts on vaccines and Wi-Fi are not the only conspiracy theories Stein has laundered into the mainstream. She has even peddled misinformation about her prospects to her own supporters in requests for campaign cash:\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this year, Stein’s running mate, Ajamu Baraka, contributed an essay to a volume edited by Holocaust denier and 9/11 truther Kevin Barrett. The anthology’s title? Another False Flag? Bloody Tracks from Paris to San Bernadino. A veritable who’s who of bigots and conspiracy theorists, the book posits that the Charlie Hebdo attacks and many others were perpetrated by the CIA and Mossad.\n\nShe has whitewashed abusive dictators and despots. In December 2015, Stein visited Moscow, where she publicly denounced American foreign policy, then personally dined with Vladimir Putin. At no point did Stein criticize the Russian leader for his repressive regime and in particular its cruel treatment of LGBT people.\n\nThis tendency to turn a blind eye to the abuses of despots is shared by Stein’s hand-picked running mate, Baraka, who deemed Bashar al-Assad, the dictator of Syria who has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people, to be a man with democratic legitimacy.\n\nJewish Labour Movement overwhelmingly votes no on Corbyn\n\nIn a landslide vote, 92 percent of the Jewish Labour Movement has nominated Owen Smith for the Labour leadership.\n\nSmith, the Welsh MP, is challenging Jeremy Corbyn for the party leadership. In the same vote, Corbyn received just 4% of the vote while 4% voted for 'no nomination.'\n\nSmith had resigned earlier this year from Corbyn's shadow cabinet before challenging for the leadership. This has caused tensions between the two as Corbyn has criticized Smith for causing disunity within the Labour Party.\n\nCorbyn has faced several incidents of anti-Semitism in the party since taking over as leader in September of 2015.\n\nThis led to Smith mentioning to the BBC in July: \"We have had a massive problem recently with misogyny and intolerance in the party, anti-Semitism, racism and the awful way in which women in the Labour movement have been treated. It's been appalling to witness this, heart-breaking.\"\n\nUnauthorized Images (satire)\n\nTHIS IS A GUEST POST BY DHAIBHIDH C MHAC DHUIHDHLHEIGH OF THE LENINIST VANGUARD (DRUMNADROCHIT CHAPTER).\n\nGreetings all. Apparently someone is objecting to the unauthorized dissemination of this publicly accessible image. Being a responsible blog, we would not dream of displaying an private personal photograph without appropriate consent.\n\nSo here is a screengrab of a webpage which does have consent.\n\nPayment of two shekels?\n\nWorld Vision: Show us your books\n\nWorld Vision's reports on the operation of its Jerusalem office, which serves the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, indicate that between 2007 and 2015 it spent at least $70 million and probably more helping the Palestinians. How much of this sum was spent in Gaza is unreported, but given that this territory was the scene of numerous wars, World Vision's figure of $22.5 million seems a bit low, especially in light of the organization's regular boasts about how much it has been able to improve the lives of the children it helps.\n\nTo re-establish its credibility, World Vision must open up its books for inspection, not just to outside auditors, but to its donors and supporters throughout the world. Telling us that the books have been audited is not good enough -- Bernie Madoff said the same thing. It is time for World Vision to show us the books.\n\nThe organization is also going to have to reset its moral compass when dealing with Hamas. Over the course of the past few decades, key World Vision staffers have whitewashed Hamas' crimes against children in the Gaza Strip, while demonizing Israel. Tom Getman, who worked for World Vision for 25 years, first in Jerusalem and then in Washington, was one of the worst offenders. During the Second Intifada, Getman wrote, \"It is being suggested by several journalists that a purposed ethnic cleansing is the last gasping effort of a dying Zionist vision in order to sign a death warrant to a parallel viable Palestinian state.\" What Getman failed to acknowledge is that it is Palestinian leaders, Hamas especially, that deny Israel's legitimacy, not the other way around.\n\nAnother example of World Vision's moral obtuseness came in 2009, when the organization's office in Jerusalem issued a report about fighting between Hamas and Israel that among other things called on Israel to relax its blockade of the Gaza Strip, but made no demands on Hamas whatsoever. Asking Hamas to stop firing rockets at civilians in Israel would seem to be a reasonable demand for a child advocacy and welfare organization, but World Vision said nothing.\n\nWorld Vision needs to get its house in order, and fast.\n\nFollowing up on World Vision's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week in Gaza\n\nIn 2014, World Vision (WV) noted with pride on its website that Mohammed Khalil El Halabi had been named a United Nations humanitarian hero for his work leading the international evangelical Christian mega-charity in Gaza, the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory.\n\nA year later, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA), a right-leaning Israeli think tank, produced a lengthy white paper on WV's work in Gaza. It asserted that WV promoted \"an anti-Israel narrative in order to obscure the role of Hamas in creating a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. By serving as a conduit of misinformation about the Arab-Israel conflict, World Vision increases its income as it assists Hamas in its propaganda war against the Jewish state.\"\n\nNeither the WV web post or the JPPA report received meaningful news media attention. That's as you might expect. In-house employee praise or white papers by groups with an obvious dog in the fight -- particularly those right-of-center on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- tend to gain little traction with mainstream journalistic professionals.\n\nHere's what does receive attention: Last week, Halabi was charged by Israel with being a Hamas agent who diverted significant WV funds to the Sunni Islamist Palestinian group that the United States and other nations have labeled a terrorist group.\n\nWV is based in the Seattle area, so let's also see what the hometown newspaper did. Lacking its own international resources, the Seattle Times fell back on the time-honored journalistic slight-of-hand of having a staffer add a local veneer to a rewrite of wire reports. Been there, done that.\n\nIsraellyCool: Missouri African American Churches Reject BLM Statements On Israel\n\nIn a Letter to the Editor of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, Bishop Lawrence M. Wooten, President of the Ecumenical Leadership Council of St. Louis, wrote,\n\nBishop Lawrence WootenWe sincerely recognize the value of law enforcement officers and realize that the majority are devoted public servants. However, we also believe that Black Lives Matter plays a vital role in addressing racially driven police abuse in America.\n\nRecently, Black Lives Matter issued a platform of demands. One of the demands called for the elimination of U.S. aid to Israel. Their argument is that Israel is an apartheid state perpetrating genocide against the Palestinians. Most of the platform’s readers are likely unaware that its Israel/Palestine section was written by an activist who was born and raised as a Jew, although Rachel Gilmer says she no longer identifies as Jewish.\n\nThe Ecumenical Leadership Council of Missouri, representing hundreds of predominantly African-American churches throughout the state, rejects without hesitation any notion or assertion that Israel operates as an apartheid country. We embrace our Jewish brethren in America and respect Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nThank you to Bishop Wooten and to those with whom he consulted to prepare this statement.\n\nThis is especially significant because it was in Ferguson, Missouri that Black Lives Matter gained national attention, and it was during the protests in that city that anti-Israel activists began their mission to coopt the BLM movement. Bishop Wooten has also been involved in community empowerment efforts in the aftermath of the Ferguson protests and he has a street named after him.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether others will follow.\n\nGil Troy: Be ready to defend Israel on campus\n\nThe new school year is approaching. Jewish students are returning to campus or starting their university adventure. Unfortunately, rather than simply celebrating, we also must gird for another fight over the nefarious movement to boycott democratic Israel.\n\nWhile this remains a golden age for Jews on campus, with Jews feeling more comfortable than ever in the university, the anti-Israel obsession on campus is mushrooming. In an age of ISIS and lone wolf terrorists, with Iran aspiring to go nuclear and Russia busy manipulating U.S. elections, somehow Israel is considered the world’s big problem. There are four essential moves to make in fighting this scourge.\n\nFirst, don’t let the haters win by making the conversation about Israel solely about boycotts, delegitimization and anti-Zionism. We need a new Zionist conversation on campus, building on the excitement that Israel trips generate and looking at Israel as an inspiration and a model of three-dimensional Jewish living rooted in the past, seeking meaning in the present and building toward a better future. We should use a new appreciation of Israel to revitalize our Jewish identities, and look at Judaism as a process of becoming not just being, as well as one of growing, stretching and challenging assumptions, values and lazy habits of thought. If we start by seeing Zionism as the movement to improve Israel and create a new Jew – one who’s prouder, stronger, freer, more comfortable, more self-critical and more dynamic – we can start looking at Israel, Zionism and Judaism as opportunities, not burdens.\n\nNext, once we solidify our ties to Israel, we will indeed naturally, easily and happily defend it. Don’t claim Israel is perfect – no country is. But Israel is eminently defendable. Make the democracy argument, that as one of the few countries in the world with free elections, free press and free thought, it has built-in mechanisms for self-improvement. Make the peace-making argument, that it’s a country surrounded by enemies, one that has repeatedly made risks for peace and responds better to encouragement than delegitimization, meaning that all these libels against Israel make matters worse.\n\nEnough talk on NUS – Time to take action\n\nYou wrote that you understand Jewish students who are saying “Why should Jewish students have to work that bit harder to have their voices heard?” But here’s the thing. You are how we make our voices heard.\n\nWhen Jewish students overwhelmingly say “we want to disaffiliate” and UJS’ response is “Jewish students must not walk away from NUS”, it isn’t Malia silencing our voices, it’s you.\n\nSix months have gone by since the election.\n\nSix months in which Malia has failed to renounce her earlier support of violence against Israeli civilians, who are friends and family to many of us here in the UK.\n\nSix months in which anti-Semitic, anti-LGBT, anti-feminist groups such as CAGE have continued to be welcomed onto our campuses by NUS executives.\n\nSix months in which the situation of Jewish students has only gotten worse.\n\nI know I’ve asked both of you a lot of questions already, but allow me just one more. Where is your red line? What will it take for you to stand up and say “NUS has gone too far, and now we’re going to make a stand”?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nCall to Ban New Israel Fund Lecturers from IDF Bases\n\nAttorney Doron Nir Tzvi, from the Lavi organization submitted an urgent request to the director-general of the Defense Ministry, Gen. (ret.) Ehud Adam, to bar access to IDF bases to lecturers from organizations financed by The New Israel Fund, the Hartman Institute and Binah and to prevent them from speaking to officers.\n\nNir Tzvi cited statements made by these lecturers which he said were tantamount to incitement against elected officials and contended that their conduct was offensive to entire sectors of the Israeli public.\n\n“Their ways are completely counter to the spirit of the IDF and democratic values…and the connection with them such be severed,” he said in a statement.\n\nNir Tzvi quoted Daniel Hartman, head of the Hartman Institute, who said in a recent interview: “If only the problem was just Netanyahu. So yes, Bibi is living in Germany of 1938, but the challenge is one of education- to deal with the distorted roots in the society.”\n\nIn another context, Hartman said that “Israel appears to the world as the realization of anti-Semitic stereotypes, and exposes Jews in the Diaspora to criticism from their neighbors who connect the state of Israel with Jews who support it.”\n\nWomen's flotilla to set sail in September or October\n\nDr. Mazen Kahel, the head of the European campaign aimed at breaking Israel's naval blockade on Gaza, provided more details on a planned women's flotilla to Gaza, first announced in March.\n\nSpeaking to Hamas's Palestine newspaper on Saturday, Kahel said that two ships will set sail from Spain towards Gaza in late September or early October.\n\nHe added that 25 women will be on board the two ships, including political activists, lawyers and parliamentarians.\n\nThe flotilla will last for about a week and its goal, according to Kahel, is first and foremost to raise awareness about the issue of the blockade on Gaza and to show support for Palestinian women.\n\nMK Hanin Zoabi (Joint List) was previously reported to be one of the participants on the women's flotilla.\n\nPreOccupiedTerritory: Boycott Israel, Says Man Drawing Salary From Israel (satire)\n\nA legislator earning a living from the coffers of the Jewish State called on other countries, individuals, and entities today not to do business or have normal relations with that state.\n\nBasel Ghattas, a lawmaker from the Joint List delegation to the Israeli parliament, addressed a conference in this Canadian city that had already had the government in Ottawa withdraw its support and participation because of the event’s anti-Israel agenda. Ghattas, who also participated in the controversial Mavi Marmara flotilla to Gaza to challenge Israel’s blockade of the coastal territory, urged his audience to disengage from Israel to pressure the country and challenge its legitimacy. In the meantime, the lawmaker is paid tens of thousands of shekels each month as his salary for serving in the legislature, plus benefits.\n\n“The moral step is to boycott this racist entity,” the MK argued, his words generating applause from the audience. “It is incumbent on every person of conscience to withdraw from dealings with the State of Israel, its institutions, and its representatives, no matter how lucrative such dealings may be.”\n\nGhattas was cheered by Omar Barghouti, a Boycott, Divest, Sanctions activist who earned an advanced degree from Tel Aviv University while campaigning for BDS. “Mr, Ghattas cogently argued for what I and my colleagues have been urging for many years,” he said.\n\nDaily Mail (AFP) headline fail – Temple Mount edition\n\nHere’s the headline accompanying an Agence France Presse (AFP) article, on an incident at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, published at the Daily Mail on Aug. 15th.\n\n(We wish to note that this represents the original AFP headline.)\n\nFirst, the characterization of the Jews who visited the site yesterday on Tisha B’Av as ‘radical’ (without quotes) in the headline (and in the opening sentence) uncritically accepts – as a fact – the Jordanian statement as detailed in the 5th paragraph of the article:\n\nBBC Earth corrects ‘border of Palestine’ inaccuracy\n\nAs was noted here a few days ago, on August 10th BBC audiences were inaccurately told that the Dead Sea lies on the border of a country called Palestine.\n\nFollowing communication from BBC Watch, the article was amended and the passage which previously stated “Few are more famous than the Dead Sea, nestled on the borders of Jordan, Israel and Palestine” now reads as follows:\n\nWe commend BBC Earth for that quick correction.\n\nTogo Organizing Israeli-African Security and Development Summit\n\nThe West African nation of Togo is taking the lead in organizing an Israeli-African “security and development” summit, which it offered to host in its capital next year, The Jerusalem Post reported on Friday.\n\nNews of the summit first emerged after Togo’s President Faure Gnassingbe met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin following his arrival in Jerusalem last week. Netanyahu is expected to attend the proposed forum in Togo, as well as a meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Nigeria later this year.\n\nA diplomatic source who spoke to the Post explained that Togo views itself as a good friend of Israel and “wants to become a hub of friendship between west Africa and Israel.” By arranging the summit, Togo will gain “credibility and influence in helping Israel come back to the entire region, not only on the political side, but on the business side as well,” the source added.\n\nWhen asked if Togo feared retribution from North African or Arab states for seeking closer ties with Israel, the source noted that “Togo is a small country and is not getting billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The Muslim population in the country is small and not active, so the political risk is low.”\n\nIsraeli Sci-Fi Is a Reality\n\nAnyone who was at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque during the Sukkot holiday of 2006 will remember the sight of the city’s quiet, highbrow arthouse cinema jam-packed with people, many of them teenagers in costumes (the term “cosplay” hadn’t made it to the local fan community yet) trying to catch a glimpse of the festival’s guest of honor, some (especially the teenage girls) screaming in excitement whenever he passed by.\n\nI remember being asked by someone—a security guard, I think—just what this guy did to get this kind of attention, and if he’s some kind of a rock star.\n\n“No, he’s a writer,” I said.\n\n“Ah, a writer,” said that person who asked me the question in a rather skeptical voice.\n\nThe festival was the ICon, Israel’s annual science fiction and fantasy convention. The guest of honor was novelist and comics writer extraordinaire Neil Gaiman. One of the special events held as part of the 2006 festival was a celebration of the 10th anniversary of The Israeli Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy, one of ICon’s co-organizers. It was a modest event, consisting of several speeches, some amusing stage-sketches, video greetings from foreign authors and an appearance by Gaiman. But it was enough for the society members present in the auditorium to feel some sort of a collective pat on the back. They made it. For 10 years the society has been a home to genre fans, and keeping any kind of cultural activity going on in Israel for so long is an achievement in its own right, let alone an activity that promotes thinking beyond the limits of the here and now—limits that sometimes appear to be almost sacred to Israeli society at large.\n\nA decade later, the Israeli Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy is still here—and what seemed amazing in 2006 seems almost mundane today. Jam-packed lobbies are a regular sight at the annual ICon festival and the Olamot convention held during Passover. Nobody raises an eyebrow when costumed visitors of either ICon or Olamot sit down for a drink or lunch at one of the many coffee shops and restaurants along the HaArba’a street (where both events are held).\n\nMore Arab Israelis join national service, discovering state benefits, patriotism\n\nThey sound like your average religious Zionist couple in Israel: she serves in the Jewish state’s national service and he is an army combat veteran. Except they are both Muslim Arabs, and she, Bara’a Abed, is from East Jerusalem while her husband (unnamed) is from a village in the north.\n\nAbed, 20, who now does works as a volunteer in an Israeli Interior Ministry office, is part of a fast-growing community of young Arabs who are eschewing decades of anti-normalization with the majority-Jewish Israeli government to both give back and receive from the state.\n\nHistorically, nearly all national service participants were Jewish religious-Zionist women, who wanted to serve their country but for religious reasons didn’t want to be in the army. Such women receive near-automatic exemptions from the military, though the last several years have seen a large increase in those choosing to serve in the IDF.\n\nSix years ago, only 600 non-Jews served in Israel’s national service program, in which participants volunteer for one to two years in public institutions like schools, hospitals, courts or health clinics.\n\nPresently, 4,500 non-Jews are doing national service, of whom 100 are from East Jerusalem. That total is three times more than those coming from the ultra-Orthodox community (1,500), most of whom are men obtained a religious exemption from the army but still wanted to serve their country. There are also 8,500 religious Zionists doing national service, mostly women.\n\nNon-Jewish Israelis, mostly Arab, constitute around 20% of the country’s 8.6 million citizens.\n\nReWalk inventor rolls out revolutionary standing wheelchair\n\nNearly everyone knows about ReWalk, the revolutionary robotic exoskeleton invented in Israel that allows paraplegics to stand, walk and even navigate steps and run marathons.\n\nIronically, ReWalk inventor Amit Goffer cannot use his own device because he is a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the neck down following an accident in 1997.\n\nBut last summer he was finally able to leave home in an upright position, riding the most recent of his inventions — the alpha model of the UPnRIDE.\n\nThe first commercial model, UPnRIDE 1.0, will be unveiled at the Rehacare International trade fair in Düsseldorf at the end of September.\n\n“I have had a long-standing vision that all people confined to a wheelchair should have access to enhanced mobility, and enjoy the many health benefits associated with the ability to transition to a standing position,” Goffer said. “With the introduction of UPnRIDE, that dream has become a reality.”\n\nThe UPnRIDE mobility device is suitable for most wheelchair and scooter users, including paraplegics, quadriplegics and people suffering from multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injury.\n\nWith cardiac surgery, Israeli team saves Afghani boy’s life\n\nA baby boy born in Afghanistan with multiple heart defects received life-saving surgery in Israel thanks to a Facebook friendship and a covert operation that traversed enemy borders and diplomatic lines.\n\nYehia was born to Afghani parents in Peshawar, Pakistan, with major heart defects, The New York Times reported. His parents had no way of paying for the surgery needed to save his life.\n\nDuring a trip to their homeland they spoke with an English-speaking relative, Farhad Zaheer, living in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, who reached out on social media to his contacts. Anna Mussman, 69, a daughter of Holocaust survivors living in Israel, answered his call. According to the Times report, Zaheer remembered Mussman because she had commented kindly on his previous posts.\n\nMussman contacted Simon Fisher, executive director of the Israeli charity Save a Child’s Heart. “I realize helping a child from a country which Israel has no diplomatic relations is not easy, but perhaps possible,” she emailed him. “Thanks so much and Shabbat Shalom.”\n\nIt was not simple to arrange, and involved calling in all sorts of favors and using many different contacts, but ultimately Yehia was brought to Holon’s Wolfson Medical Center, and was operated on in an eight-hour surgery.\n\nIsraeli universities rank among top 100 in the world\n\nThe Technion- Israel Institute of Technology was ranked 69th among the world’s leading universities, up from 77th place in 2015, according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) released on Monday.\n\nThe ARWU is largely considered one of the most objective and most important ranking of the world's leading universities. Since 2003, the annual report, conducted by researchers at the Center for World-Class Universities of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (CWCU) in China, publishes the world's top 500 universities from more than 1,200 ranked.\n\nThe Technion surpassed the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to become the leading Israeli institution on the list. The Hebrew University was still ranked among the top 100 but dropped 20 points from the previous year to 87th place.\n\nThe Weizmann Institute of Science ranked in the top 101-150, while Tel Aviv University ranked in the top 151-200 universities in the world. Ben Gurion University of the Negev ranked in the top 401-500. Bar Ilan University and Haifa University did not make the list in 2016.\n\nAncient ballista ball unearthed by students in Gush Etzion from Bar Kokhba revolt\n\nAn ancient ballista ball used by Jewish warriors fighting against the Roman Empire in the Judean Hills during the legendary Bar Kokhba revolt has been unearthed by high school students in Gush Etzion, south of Jerusalem.\n\nThe rebellion, led by Simon Bar Kokhba between 132-136 CE, was also known as the Third Jewish Revolt, because it was the final of three Jewish uprisings against the Romans due to religious and political persecution.\n\nIt is estimated that over 580,000 Jews died during the revolt, resulting in a massive depopulation of the Jewish communities inhabiting the Judean Hills. Many survivors of the battle were sold into slavery by Roman captors.\n\nOn Monday, Yoran Rosenthal, director of the Kfar Etzion Field School, said the stone ball fashioned for a ballista, or catapult, was discovered by students during an annual excavation in Gush Etzion led by school counselors shortly before Tisha B’Av.\n\n“This is a discovery of historic magnitude because this battle was the last battle fought by a Jewish army in Israel until modern times,” said Rosenthal, noting that the discovery is of great interest to archeologists.\n\n“This finding serves as a mute testimony to the persistent struggle that took place there,” he continued. “The battle that took place there is said to have been fought by brave warriors, and shows the power and greatness of the Jewish fighters.”\n\nAccording to Rosenthal, several school counselors helped students from around the country who gathered for the annual trip searching for evidence of the historic uprising.\n\nWe have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

The articles argued that Koranic passages against the Jews only applied to specific groups during specific time periods, and should not be applied to Jews in general. They added that blind hatred of Jews everywhere has prevented Arabs and Muslims from learning the lessons of Jewish experience and advancement.\n\nIt should be mentioned that these articles came against the backdrop of a heated debate in Saudi Arabia over the issue of normalizing relations with Israel, which erupted after a July 2016 visit to Israel by a Saudi delegation headed by Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Anwar Eshki, chairman of the Middle East Center for Strategic and Legal Studies in Jeddah, and the publication of photos of the delegation with Israeli politicians. While Eshki claimed that he represented only himself and that \"official Saudi elements did not know of the meeting in advance, as it was of a personal nature\" and was the result of an invitation by the Palestinian Authority, he stressed that \"the kingdom does not prevent anyone from holding such visits.\" He also did not rule out indirect Israeli-Saudi intelligence cooperation as part of efforts to combat terrorism.[1]\n\nThe visit, which was seen as a Saudi step towards normalizing relations with Israel, sparked harsh criticism inside and outside the kingdom. Several hashtags attacking the visit were launched on social networks, including \"Saudis Against Normalization.\"[2] Likely as a response to the criticism, the Saudi Foreign Ministry distanced itself from Eshki, arguing that \"people like Anwar Eshki do not represent us, have no ties to any governmental elements, and do not reflect the positions of the Saudi government.\"[3]\n\nHowever, despite this statement, and despite the Saudi regime's denial that the visit heralded normalization with Israel, the publication of Saudi articles attacking antisemitic discourse specifically at this time is no coincidence, and is likely meant to lay the groundwork for public acceptance in the country of normalized relations with Israel.\n\nThe article goes on to include lengthy quotes from the Saudi articles attacking antisemitism.\n\nPerhaps more fascinating is that Iran's state run Al Aram news agency decided to quote the MEMRI article nearly in full - in order to try to discredit the Saudi regime for being too pro-Jewish and too pro-Israel.\n\nAccusing other Muslims of being pro-Israel is a standard weapon in the Islamic arsenal when trying to discredit a political opponent. Funny thing though: it no longer works.\n\nYou'll still see it here and there - Fatah and Hamas accuse each other of \"collaborating\" with Israel, Hezbollah will still use that rhetoric, and some Egyptian or Moroccan papers might show pictures of their rivals with Israelis, and Malaysian politicians still embrace that theme with gusto.\n\nBut the Sunni hate and fear of Shiites, and Iran in particular, is far more potent than their antipathy towards Jews and Israel nowadays. I\n\nIn a very real way, when Iran trots out its \"you are pro-Israel\" card, they are in fact pushing their Muslim enemies into wanting to be more pro-Israel! At this time, Israel represents security when the Arab world has little, it represents a consistent political position when the US has become flaky, and it represents an anti-Iran bulwark when the Sunni world is scared silly of Iran.\n\nAlthough they have no love for the Jewish state, the Gulf states are no longer frightened of being labeled pro-Israel by Iran. And that is a really major change that occurred in only the past couple of years.\n\nWe have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

Working with an Arab cook there, the plan was to insert a poison that would not take effect for many hours after diners ingested it for maximum deaths.\n\nLuckily, the plotters were caught before they could implement the plan. But that failure to murder Jews seems to have been enough to set him free now, even though there is no difference between how he acted in his attempt to murder Jews and how he would have acted had it been successful.\n\nThe Shin Bet said that his bid to kill Jews was to avenge the death of Hamas activist Salah Shehadeh.\n\nAbdo's friends and family in the Jabel Mukaber neighborhood in Jerusalem placed him on their shoulders and cheered his release.\n\nThe first thing he did was to visit the Al Aqsa Mosque and to pray there.\n\nBecause terrorists have more rights on Judaism's holiest site than Jews do.\n\n(h/t Shahar Azani)\n\nWe have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

(Keep in mind 2% of Palestinians are Christians.)\n\n86% are against coeducational secondary schools.\n\n82% say that the Palestinian Personal Status Law should be either fully or partially based on sharia (Muslim religious) law.\n\nThe only answers that seemed consistent with liberal viewpoints was that a large majority is against marriage for women under 18, and about 2/3 were against having multiple wives.\n\nThe poll didn't even ask the most incendiary questions. In 2013, a Pew poll asked questions in the Muslim world about attitudes towards alcohol, honor killings, sharia, stoning for adultery and other topics, and the results among Palestinians were shocking. Yet this truth about Palestinian fundamentalism and fanaticism is rarely discussed in the media or by think-tanks.\n\nThese results are important to understand. When Westerners say that they will propose peace plans, or fund human rights NGOs, or really get involved in any way in the Middle East conflicts, without knowing the mindset of the people involved, the initiatives are probably doomed.\n\nOf course, this applies to Israel as well. Of course there are fundamentalist Jews as well. However, the percentage of Jews in Israel with fundamentalist and closed-minded opinions is far lower than that of Muslims in the territories.\n\nWhile critics of Israel routinely throw around terms like \"theocracy,\" they rarely apply the same standards to Palestinians.\n\nWe have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

But Abu al-Halaweh believes the real number in Palestine is higher - more than 20 percent.\n\n\"In the surrounding areas of Yatta, we believe half of the adult population has Type 2 diabetes. But many of them don't know they have it,\" he told Al Jazeera, blaming the region's high unemployment rates and lack of education for the increased rates.\n\nThe Israeli occupation has exacerbated the diabetes crisis in a number of ways, \"especially the psychological stress that comes from it\", Abu al-Halaweh added.\n\n\"People in Gaza or Palestinian refugees suffer from an even poorer diet,\" he said, noting that one-third of Palestinians are considered to be short of food.\"They may not have nutritional deficits in terms of calories, but the food aid they receive can be pallets of canned tuna eaten for weeks. Such an unvaried diet is not optimal.\"\n\nThe mobile clinic roaming the streets of the occupied West Bank is the only such service in Palestine for screening and treating diabetes patients. It also functions as a tool for educating Palestinians about the dangers of diabetes.\n\nIsraellyCool: Fatah Slams Hamas For Stealing Humanitarian Aid Money & Arresting Journalists\n\nThe following cartoon was posted on the official Fatah Facebook page.\n\nThey seem to be taking a swipe at Hamas for misusing funds earmarked for humanitarian organizations like World Vision and the UN.\n\nInterestingly enough, even though they post everything in Arabic, they accompanied the cartoon with the words “No comment” in English – clearly aiming it at an international audience.\n\nThey have also posted the following – again with an English description.\n\nThis all follows their biting video response to the Hamas video showing how great life in Gaza is.\n\nFatah are clearly on the warpath against Hamas. One can only hope this goes beyond social media and leads to a terrorists vs terrorists war of epic proportions.\n\nMy only concern is whether I have enough popcorn in the house.\n\nHezbollah terror cells, set up via Facebook in West Bank and Israel, busted by Shin Bet\n\nIsrael’s security services broke up two terror cells, which had been created by the Hezbollah terrorist organization, arresting nine suspected members over the past few months, officials revealed Tuesday.\n\nHezbollah operatives from the group’s Unit 133 — its foreign operations unit — working out of Lebanon and the Gaza Strip recruited members in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and within Israel through social media sites, notably Facebook, the Shin Bet security service said.\n\nThe terror cells had planned to carry out suicide bombings and ambush IDF patrols in the West Bank. They received funding from Hezbollah, and some members had begun preparing explosive devices for use in attacks, the Shin Bet says.\n\n“The Hezbollah organization has recently made it a priority to try to spark terror acts, doing so from far away, while attempting to not clearly expressing its involvement,” the Shin Bet said in a statement.\n\nThe terror operatives were arrested earlier this summer, but information about the case was kept under a court-issued gag order. The Shin Bet has credited their operation with thwarting a number of terror attacks against Israeli targets in the West Bank and Israel.\n\nAccording to Israel’s security forces, the ringleader of the West Bank terror cell was Mustafa Kamal Hindi, 18, a resident of Qalqilya.\n\nDuring his interrogation, Hindi told interrogators that he’d been recruited through a Facebook page, “Palestine the Free,” where Hezbollah posted “anti-Israel and pro-jihad content,” the Shin Bet said.\n\nDanon to UN: Designate Hezbollah as a terror organization\n\nIn the wake of confounded attempts by Hezbollah to instigate terror attacks within Israel, the Israeli representative to the UN, Dani Danon, called on the UN Security Commision to officially define Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.\n\n\"Hezbollah terrorists are working as representatives of the Iranian regime, threatening not only Israel, but stability in Syria, Lebanon and the entire region,\" Danon said.\n\nDanon emphasized that \"Hezbollah needs to know that every terror act it does will have serious repercussions for the organization.\"\n\nHe urged the international community to condemn the organization, saying: \"the international community must condemn attempts by Hezbollah to hurt innocent Israeli citizens; the UN Security Commission must proclaim them a terror organization.\"\n\nHezbollah's sting operation\n\nA little more scrutiny in vetting an interview offer from the \"international media\" would likely have prevented the embarrassment felt by Israeli leaders who were tricked into speaking to a journalist working on behalf of the South-Lebanese terror organization.\n\nMonni's Hezbollah handlers attempted to stand by him, claiming he was sent to perform the interviews due to his connections with the Israeli top brass. We found a hook, they explained. The interviewees didn't check his background with thoroughly enough, and the interviewer didn't see the full picture either.\n\nMichele Monni is on his way out. He's already been suspended from his position at Italian news agency ANSA. This was the position that allowed him to receive a journalist certificate from the Israeli Government Press Office (GPO) in Jereusalem. When he took the job – whether he knew he'd be working for Hezbollah or not – he did not inform his superiors or ask their permission.\n\nI assume that expressions of contrition will not help Monni in his disciplinary hearing. He acted dishonestly. When he requested the interviews (with the aid of an Israeli official with ties to the media), he made two promises: The first was that the interviews would be shown on the BBC and Al-Jazeera. The second was that it would be broadcast on \"international media\" outlets. It just so happened that politicians, experts, and one IDF major general casually fell into the trap. Who would give up an opportunity to speak to the \"international media,\" after all?\n\nISIS Copies a Palestinian Tactic\n\nIn my last post, I discussed how Palestinian culture encourages suicidal youngsters to kill by offering a simple bargain: Murder a Jew, and you instantly become a hero. While the West has long turned a blind eye to this behavior, its refusal to look reality in the face is now coming back to haunt it. For today, the Islamic State is making the very same tempting offer to distraught Muslims in Western countries–murder a Westerner, and you can instantly become a hero instead of a failure.\n\nIt’s no accident that several recent terror attacks in Western countries have been carried out by people who apparently had histories of mental illness, including Nice, Orlando, and several attacks in Germany. Nor is it any accident that the Islamic State is cultivating such people. As with many other terrorist techniques pioneered by the Palestinians, ISIS has copied this one precisely because it proved successful–and not just as a means of recruiting assailants.\n\nThis tactic also serves two other important purposes. First, it encourages an already strong Western tendency to ignore the terrorists’ true aims. I discussed this with regard to the Palestinians in my previous post; a classic example concerning the Islamic State was Kenan Malik’s op-ed in the New York Times on Tuesday. “In the past, groups employing terrorism, such as the Irish Republican Army or the Palestine Liberation Organization, were driven by specific political aims: a united Ireland or an independent Palestine,” Malik wrote. “Jihadists are different. They have little or no explicit political aim but are driven by a visceral hatred of the West.”\n\nIn reality, Islamic State is quite open about its aims: It wants to destroy the West and establish a global Islamic caliphate. Indeed, being open about its goals is part of how it attracts new recruits, just as Palestinian organizations attract support by boasting of their efforts to destroy the Jewish state. But at the same time, both the Palestinians and ISIS would prefer that the West not take their goals too seriously since, if it did, it might stop supporting the Palestinians or actually get serious about destroying ISIS.\n\nMedalists arrive back in Israel to Olympic hero’s welcome\n\nWaving flags and singing songs, hundreds of people turned up at Ben-Gurion International Airport late Monday to welcome Israel’s Olympic medal-winning judokas back home.\n\n“I didn’t expect so much craziness,”Yarden Gerbi said upon landing, according to news site Ynet, which reported nearly 1,000 celebrants who came out to the airport outside Tel Aviv.\n\nGerbi and Or Sasson both took away bronze medals in judo in Rio, Israel eighth and ninth medals ever, instantly transforming the two into national heroes.\n\nEntering the cavernous airport arrivals hall, Gerbi and Sasson were showered with flowers, as well-wishers waved flags, sang patriotic songs and held up pictures and posters with the two winners, stopping them every few moments for a selfy or a hug.\n\n“I think I dropped to 57 kilos just from all the craziness here,” said Gerbi, who competed in the 63-kilogram category. “I had a few days of quiet in Rio as I took in the accomplishment. My next dream is some vacation.”\n\nEgyptian Judoka Who Refused To Shake Israeli Competitor's Hand Sent Home By IOC\n\nEgyptian judoka Islam el-Shehaby, who refused to shake hands with an Israeli athlete after a match, has been reprimanded by the IOC and sent home by the Egyptian delegation. The IOC said that el-Shehaby's actions were against the values the Olympic Games stands for, and that Egypt needs to do a better job educating its athletes about the meaning of the Games.\n\n\"The Disciplinary Commission (DC) considered that his behavior at the end of the competition was contrary to the rules of fair play and against the spirit of friendship embodied in the Olympic Values,\" the IOC said.\n\n\"The DC issued a 'severe reprimand for inappropriate behavior' to the athlete. It noted....the shaking of hands after a match is not in the competition rules of the International Judo Federation.\"\n\n\"As well as a severe reprimand, the DC has asked the Egyptian Olympic Committee to ensure in future that all their athletes receive proper education on the Olympic Values before coming to the Olympic Games,\" the IOC said.\n\nOn Twitter, fans encouraged el-Shehaby to forfeit the entire match to avoid fighting an Israeli. El-Shehaby defended not shaking hands after the match, saying he wouldn't shake hands with anyone who represented Israel for \"personal reasons.\"\n\nEgypt officially recognized Israel in 1979.\n\nHonestly, good on the IOC for standing up for athletes. The games are not a time for political statements.\n\nEconomist twists story about Egyptian racism into lie about Israeli “apartheid”\n\nA serious journalist who wished to provide an analysis to news consumers on the recent Olympic scandal involving an Egyptian judoka who refused to shake the hand of his Israeli competitor may have contextualized the incident by noting endemic Egyptian antisemitism. Indeed, though Cairo and Jerusalem signed a peace agreement in 1979, and ties between the two countries (on the governmental level) have never been closer, there is little if any sign that Egyptian animosity towards Jews – not just Israelis, but Jews qua Jews – has waned.\n\nIn 2011, a Pew Global poll revealed that only 2% of Egyptians had favorable attitudes towards Jews.\n\nMore recently, an ADL commissioned poll reported that 75% of Egyptians held antisemitic views – a sign of an entrenched hatred that persists despite the fact that there are almost no Jews left in the country.\n\nYet, remarkably, the Economist’s “N.P.” (presumably Nicolas Pelham), in ‘Politics hogs the Olympic spotlight‘, Aug. 15, ignores Egyptian antisemitism in his report on the conduct of the Egyptian athlete, and does his best to turn the story into one of Israeli hypocrisy.\n\nSigns of Pelham’s impatience with Israeli ‘claims’ of Egyptian racism are evident throughout the article. After citing additional examples of athletes from Egypt (and other Arab countries) refusing to compete with – or otherwise showing disdain towards – Israeli athletes, Pelham derides the suggestion that Israelis are the victims, mocking those “Israeli athletes” who “might cheer the free pass they gain when Arabs refuse to compete against them“.\n\n“Free pass”? For which crimes do Israeli athletes require such impunity?\n\nNew York Times Casts Olympians' Anti-Israel Hostility As Mutual Animosity\n\nIn a sports story on the Egyptian judoka who refused to shake hands with his Israeli opponent, The New York Times misleadingly depicts a pattern of anti-Israel hostility on the part of Muslim and Arab Olympians as \"animosity between Israeli and other Middle Eastern athletes,\" as if the two sides are equally engaged in hostile acts directed against the other side. In his Aug. 13 article about Islam El Shehaby's snub of Or Sasson (\"Egyptian Refuses Handshake After Losing to Israeli\"), Victor Mather writes:\n\nThere is a history of animosity between Israeli and other Middle Eastern athletes at the Olympics, including in judo.\n\nMather helpfully goes on to cite examples, all of which tellingly point to one directional hostility: Arab and Muslim athletes snubbing Israeli competitors. First, he cites last week's incident in a Lebanese team prevented an Israeli team for boarding a bus. Then, he notes that last Tuesday, a Saudi judo player forfeited a match, reportedly to avoid competing against an Israeli. Finally, The Times' Mather cites a 2004 incident in which Iranian judoka Arash Miresmaeili apparently binged in order to be disqualified so as to not to face off against an Israeli.\n\nIndeed, Israeli Olympians are consistently on the receiving end of Arab and Muslim animosity so why misleadingly characterize the hostility as \"animosity between Israeli and other Middle Eastern athletes\"?\n\nReuters Bureau Chief Deletes Tweet Saying Palestinian Leadership Doesn’t Allow Athletes to Train in Israel\n\nThe Jerusalem bureau chief for Reuters deleted a tweet he posted last week about the plight of Palestinian athletes, after engaging in an exchange with pro-Israel blogger Elder of Ziyon.\n\nLuke Baker erased a claim he made last Thursday that Palestinian leaders oppose letting Palestinian athletes train in Israel.\n\nThis was an apparent reference to reports by media outlets such as Mondoweiss, that “Mary al Atrash, a 22-year-old swimmer from Beit Sahour in the West Bank who was part of the largest delegation Palestine has ever sent to the Olympic Games…[had] difficulties to train in a swimming pool that does not match the Olympic standards, and explained that although she technically lives close to Jerusalem, where such swimming pools, exist, she could not go there to train.”\n\nIt turned out, however, that Atrash had never applied for an Israeli entry permit, possibly due to a Palestinian Authority anti-normalization policy.\n\nBaker then modified his comment to: “The conflict is the responsibility of both Israel and the Palestinians, who have opposed letting athletes train in Israel.”\n\nRemoving the radicals\n\nCanada needs to revamp its approach to Islamic extremism if it hopes to prevent another homegrown radical from setting off a bomb, says the founder of an international anti-radicalization think tank.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Postmedia, Maajid Nawaz - a former Islamist radical and founder of the U.K.-based Quilliam Foundation - called for a society-wide effort to undercut the intellectual and theological planks of Islamist and jihadist ideology.\n\n“There certainly needs to be training. Counter-radicalization training involves de-radicalization training on how to disengage somebody from the theory of violence, and it involves taking them beyond that actually and discrediting the theory of Islamism in their minds,” said Nawaz.\n\n“A lot of this, Muslims simply don’t know.”\n\nNawaz was in Niagara Falls Saturday to address the third annual Non-Conference at the Americana hotel as the event’s keynote speaker.\n\nAlthough the event was billed as a conference for non-believers, Nawaz, a Muslim seeking to reform the faith, told his audience he looked upon them as allies in combating radicalization.\n\nObama will leave his successor a ticking time bomb\n\nBarack Obama likes to credit himself with getting America to step back from the abyss of the Middle East. When he shops around the story of his legacy, the president says he was proudest of his decision not to follow the \"Washington playbook\" and commit to toppling the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIt would be a fitting story to tell of the man who ascended to the presidency while simultaneously winning a Nobel Peace Prize. Obama returns America's sword to its sheath, and earns the praise of his fans and admirers. Just as he passed on a better economy to his successor than the one he inherited from Bush, so he passed on a safer world.\n\nUnfortunately this story is a lie from end to end. The world the next president will inherit is full of traps.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Obama has slowed down the pace of withdrawing troops. Corruption is rife, and there seems to be no progress on talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The latter has gained momentum and re-captured parts of the countryside. A continued drawdown after Obama's presidency may make his successor appear to be running from the Taliban.\n\nIn Iraq, American special forces are back on the ground as the U.S conducts airstrikes against ISIS. Although the U.S. seems to be sending ISIS into a smaller corner of the country, Iraq's political settlement is as shaky as ever, with Shia Muslims threatening to revolt.\n\nIn Syria, the U.S. wants to force Assad out of peace negotiations, and so acts to strengthen various rebel groups. The civil war is thus extended indefinitely, leading to increasing death totals. Russia acts to shore up Assad in negotiations, making Syria look more and more like a proxy war between two global nuclear powers.\n\nUN Ignored Desperate Pleas Of Gang-Rape Victims In South Sudan, A New Country Bush Championed And Obama Abandoned\n\nSeveral years after former President George W. Bush facilitated South Sudan’s long-awaited independence, the young nation has fallen, once again, victim to what amounts to a civil war. Sectarian violence fueled by ethnic divisions are tearing the country apart, once-again, as President Salva Kiir’s central government in Juba struggles to fend off long-time rival and former vice president Riek Machar’s paramilitary force stationed outside the city. The international community has so far failed to respond to reports of mass violence. In fact, the UN is actively turning a blind-eye to the war’s most desperate victims: women.\n\nAs the conflict escalates and the country descends into chaos, sectarian militias have fallen back on primal savagery, exercising control over women’s bodies to establish some ill-conceived notion of power.\n\nOne case in particular illustrates the horror inflicted upon South Sudan’s most vulnerable victims.\n\nNearly one month ago several women were gang-raped at a “safe house” by soldiers celebrating their victory over opposition forces. One of the women was raped by 15 different soldiers. The disturbing attack occurred in the Terrain hotel complex, less than one-mile away from a UN peacekeeping force. Despite a deafening cry for help, the United Nations refused to respond, allowing the soldiers to indulge, openly, in sexual violence against their female victims.\n\nGerman bank funds 'Arabs only' water purification plant\n\nThe German bank KfW is funding a waste treatment plant in Samaria - on condition that it only serve the Arab population, the Legal Forum for Israel said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the Forum, this same bank perviously funded the establishment of a water purification plant which has been noted for polluting the water flowing through the nearby valley of Wadi Kelt.\n\nThe Legal Forum warns that the establishment of the new waste treatment plant near the Jewish community of Rimonim will cause serious damage to a nearby archaeological site dating to biblical times.\n\nYesterday, the Knesset held a hearing which addressed an incident this week during which Palestinian Authority police opened fire after a confrontation at the site of the new building plans.\n\nAlthough the Legal Forum and other environmentalist groups have repeatedly appealed to the Civil Administration to stop the construction plans, so far, the Administration has rejected their claims.\n\nPA submits more anti-Israel material to ICC\n\nSaeb Erekat, secretary of the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) Executive Committee, announced on Monday that the Palestinian Authority (PA) transferred to the International Criminal Court in the Hague a detailed file concerning Israeli “settlements”.\n\nIn a radio interview Erekat expressed hope that the court will soon decide to open a criminal investigation into the \"settlement crimes\".\n\n“Palestine” officially joined the ICC on April 1, 2015, and immediately filed a series of legal complaints with the court, including a claim that Israeli “settlements” are “an ongoing war crime”. Additional complaints revolve around the war in Gaza in 2014, the issue of terrorist prisoners in Israel, and others.\n\nPalestinian Arab non-governmental organizations, collaborating with Israeli organizations, have submitted evidence of Israel's alleged “crimes” against civilians and UNRWA schools in Gaza in the summer of 2014.\n\nErekat's announcement comes after a recent report that the PA is mulling more lawsuits against Israel at the ICC.\n\nIn his remarks Monday, Erekat also called on international institutions to act to halt the Israeli moves which harm peace and a two-state solution.\n\nHe added that the PA sent letters to various countries regarding the unprecedented “settlement activities” which takes place in parallel to the “settlers' daily attacks against the Al Aqsa Mosque, the confiscation of land and intensifying attacks against the Palestinian people.”\n\nPreOccupiedTerritory: UN: Israelite Raid After Arad Captures Prisoners ‘Disproportionate’ (satire)\n\nInternational condemnation followed the Hebrews’ military operation to free prisoners taken by the Canaanite ruler of Arad this week, an action deemed out of proportion to the situation.\n\nIn Resolution -2133 the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to condemn the nation for its raid on Canaanite territory after the king of Arad attacked them and captured an unknown number of prisoners. The raid wiped out the cities and towns from which the Arad kingdom launched their attack, and succeeded in freeing the captives, but the Council believed the operation use excessive force and could not be justified under laws of armed conflict expected to come into effect only 3,300 years from now. The United States and Great Britain abstained from the vote, declining to use their vetoes, in a move largely seen as a rebuke to the Israelites for not allowing themselves to be attacked with impunity.\n\n“The ruthlessness of the retaliatory attack cannot be justified,” read the resolution, which was drafted by France. “We call on the Israelite nation and its leader Moses to withdraw at once from the areas it occupies.” The Israelites as yet occupy no territory, but have declared they aim to take up residence in the area presently known as the Land of Canaan.\n\nNumerous UN envoys expressed satisfaction that the resolution passed, but urged further action to prevent more violations. “The Israelites need to be hit with military and economic sanctions, at the very least,” argued EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. “They have to understand this is no way to act in the community of nations. My colleagues and I are concerned that only a firm response will discourage such behavior.”\n\nNew mall for settlers and Palestinians opens in Gush Etzion\n\nPoliticians on Monday afternoon dedicated a new mall for settlers and Palestinians at the Gush Etzion junction, an area that has been a hot spot for terrorist attacks during the last year.\n\n“The opening of this mall sends an unequivocal message to our enemies that you won’t break us,” said MK Nurit Koren (Likud).\n\n“I hope the mall will be a symbol of co-existence based on economic peace,” Koren said.\n\nShe spoke at the small ribbon-cutting ceremony on the top floor of the three-story, 5,000-meter structure with 15 shops, including a clothing outlet and a home goods retailer from the well-known FOX chain.\n\nBelow the ceremony, on the second floor, Muslim women wearing hijabs and traditional dress, shopped along side religious Jewish women in skirts and scarves tied over their hair.\n\nPoliticians call to oust Israeli-Arab MK from Knesset for pro-BDS talk\n\nJoint List MK Basel Ghattas should be sanctioned for calling for a boycott of Israel at a far-left conference in Montreal, Yisrael Beytenu MK Oded Forer said Monday, reacting to the lead story in The Jerusalem Post.\n\nThe lawmaker from Balad, one of the four parties that make up the Joint List, called Israel an oppressive, racist and apartheid state. He said he is pessimistic that there will be peace soon, and international sanctions were the most effective way to combat Israel.\n\n“The theater of the absurd in the Knesset continues and the Joint List continues to prove that its MKs do not belong in the Knesset,” Forer said. “A member of parliament calling Israel racist and calling upon countries to boycott and sanction it is an unheard of act in any sane country in the world. It is not only delusional, it is against the law.”\n\nForer said he checked the laws prohibiting action that would harm Israel via boycotts and he intends to ask the finance minister to remove special tax status from any organization connected directly or indirectly to Ghattas.\n\nParents of terror victim: Razing terrorists' homes is not enough\n\nThe parents of Hallel Yaffa Ariel, a 13-year-old girl who was murdered by a terrorist in her Kiryat Arba home on June 29, said this week that razing the terrorist's home was not enough.\n\nOn Thursday, the home of 17-year-old Mohammed Tarayreh, from the Palestinian village of Bani Naim, near Hebron, was demolished in retaliation for the late June attack. Tarayreh himself was killed shortly following the attack by Kiryat Arba security personnel as he was attempting to flee the scene.\n\n\"The terrorist's family should be deported. We need to generate a reality where terror is entirely not worth the cost,\" said Rina, Hallel Yaffa's mother. \"The ownership of every house like this should automatically be transferred into Jewish hands. The current situation is ridiculous: The terrorist's family is not deported, the house isn't fully demolished, and the areas that we [Jews] can settle aren't being settled. These things actually encourage terrorism.\"\n\nAmichai, Hallel Yaffa's father, added, \"I would prefer that the State of Israel seize the terrorists' property rather than demolishing it. It would serve as a bigger deterrent.\"\n\nThe Sbarro massacre, a Palestinian terror attack in a Jerusalem family restaurant\n\nThe Sbarro massacre, a Palestinian terror attack in a Jerusalem family restaurant, in which 15 civilians were murdered, including 8 children and a pregnant woman, and 130 wounded.\n\nAhlam Tamimi, a terrorist who helped plan the attack, has no regrets. Watch her chilling reaction at the end of this video.\n\nSome 35 Palestinians injured in clashes with IDF near Hebron\n\nSome 35 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with IDF troops in the southern West Bank on Tuesday, according to Palestinian medical officials.\n\nThe clashes erupted when a large convoy of Israeli military vehicles entered the al-Fawar refugee camp, near the flashpoint city of Hebron, witnesses said.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said live fire struck about 10 people after rioters threw large rocks at Israeli troops. It says the 25 others were struck by rubber bullets.\n\nThe IDF said its forces were on an overnight operation “to uncover weaponry” in the camp, when “dozens of Palestinians hurled IEDs (improvised explosive devices), blocks and rocks” at them.\n\nPalestinian Arab organizations call for 'Day of Rage'\n\nA coalition of Palestinian Arab organizations on Monday called for a “Day of Rage” of popular protests in “all districts of the homeland” to take place this coming Thursday.\n\nThe reason for the “Day of Rage” is to protest the Israeli policy towards hunger striking Palestinian Arab terrorists prisoners and to demand their release.\n\nPalestinian Arabs were asked to confront IDF soldiers and Judea and Samaria residents in military checkpoints, in their communities and at other points of friction.\n\nIn a meeting held in Ramallah on Monday, the representatives of the national and Islamic Palestinian Arab organizations called on the Palestinian public to also confront IDF troops on Friday in protest of Israel “harming” the Al-Aqsa mosque, administrative detentions and the treatment of the prisoners.\n\nThe Palestinian organizations expressed opposition to any manifestation of normalization with the \"occupation\" and called on Arab countries to boycott Israel and to refuse to have any relations with it - visible or covert.\n\nGaza merchants say Israel withholding permits, stifling trade\n\nGazan businessmen staged a protest at a crossing point Monday over what they said was the mass cancellation of travel permits by Israel, which they blamed for suffocating trade.\n\nPalestinians accuse the Jewish state of having scrapped hundreds of travel documents allowing them to enter Israel and the West Bank as well as other countries for trade.\n\nThe permits are crucial to the economy of the impoverished Gaza Strip, which some international official say is on the brink of collapse after 10-years of Israeli and Egyptian blockades, imposed following the take over of the enclave by Hamas, considered a terror group by Israel and most Western governments.\n\nIsrael, which allows hundreds of trucks into the Strip each day, says the blockade, which restricts shipments on certain items, is necessary to prevent Hamas and other terror groups from rebuilding its military infrastructure, including rockets and a network of tunnels.\n\nHamas Terrorist Electrocuted in Tunnel as Gaza Families Await Power\n\nThe Palestinian terrorist group Hamas announced that one of its operatives was electrocuted to death while working on a tunnel in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, Israel Army Radio reported. The news comes as residents of Gaza who seek to rebuild their homes face difficulty in securing the necessary electricity and other resources, which are routinely appropriated by Hamas.\n\nIsrael was forced to increase the amount of electricity it sends to Gaza in June after repeated shutdowns at Gaza’s only power plant due to a payment dispute between Hamas and Fatah. Because of this infighting, Gaza residents usually only have six to eight hours of electricity per day. The lack of power has also caused failures at Gaza’s new $100 million sewage treatment facility, which was built with financing from the World Bank.\n\nHamas’ mismanagement and misappropriation of resources meant for civilian construction have increasingly come into the spotlight in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the Shin Bet charged Mohammad el-Halabi, the Gaza director for the international charity World Vision, of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas. El-Halabi admitted under interrogation to diverting World Vision funds to Hamas for the purpose of purchasing weapons and building terror tunnels and military bases.\n\nJohn Bolton: Dismantling the Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nBarack Obama’s cash transfer to Iran of $400 million to trigger the release of four American hostages highlights yet again the strategic errors infecting his entire policy regarding Tehran’s ayatollahs.\n\nAbject and humiliating though it was, however, the real lessons of the January ransom payment are even broader. Obama’s view of the world — and America’s place in it — is fundamentally flawed, as is that of his former secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. To avoid further significant harm to the United States, we should reject their grand strategy at the first opportunity, starting with abrogating the Vienna nuclear-weapons agreement.\n\nObama tried to minimize the significance of the cash transfer (itself only a “down payment” on the $1.7 billion settlement of a long-standing dispute), decoupling it both from the hostage release and the Vienna pact. He knew that pictures of pallets of shrink-wrapped foreign currency being delivered to the world’s largest funder of international terrorism would unravel nearly eight years of his appeasement policy and devastate his carefully-cultivated image.\n\nEndless media interviews by Obama’s press flacks intoning that the payment was not a quid pro quo for freeing some (but not all) of the Americans kidnapped by Iran actually reduced administration credibility both on the deal and more generally. Moreover, the ransom-for-hostages swap was not even the first secret side-deal to the Vienna accord. Just weeks before, we learned of another agreement to allow Iran to swap out its existing uranium-enrichment centrifuges for more-efficient, more-productive centrifuges without violating the supposed commitments to limit its nuclear activities.\n\nOne wonders what else might yet emerge.\n\nWATCH: Smuggler Swapped for U.S. Hostages Plotted to Ship Military Equipment to Iran\n\nA video released last week of a man convicted of smuggling military equipment to Iran has shed new light on the activities of the Iranian national and six Iranian-Americans who were released by the U.S. as part of a deal to free several of its citizens from Iranian captivity, ABC News reported on Friday.\n\nThe undercover video shows Arash Ghahreman and an associate, Ergun Yildiz, discussing the potential sale of sensitive equipment to Iran with two suppliers, who were actually undercover agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nGhahreman was convicted in April 2015 and sentenced to six and a half years in prison for his involvement in the plot. He was one of seven convicted smugglers who were released by U.S. authorities in January for the release Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, former Marine Amir Hekmati, and several others by Iran. The U.S. transferred $400 million in cash to Iran at the time, despite the objections of the Justice Department, which warned that the payment looked like a ransom.\n\nCould Iran Blind Civilian Planes?\n\nNowhere has Iran made greater strides in indigenous military technology than with unmanned aerial vehicles. It flew its first UAV, a crude surveillance drone, over Iraqi trenches in the latter part of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War and in recent years has worked satellite-GPS guidance so as to no longer rely on line-of-sight operations. It has also armed drones with missiles and crafted others for kamikaze operations. Now, Iranian authorities have announced a new capability: counter-electronics and jamming. While the Iranian military might gear these to enemy communications or seek to blind other drones, Iran’s willingness to share UAVs and technology with Hezbollah and other terrorist groups might mean new threats to civilian air traffic in the region.\n\nConsider Bahrain, for example. Iranian leaders have threatened Bahrain openly since 2007, but they have become particularly blunt and virulent with their threats over the past two months. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, for example, suggested he would “remove the barrier” to “radical and armed movements.” The Bahraini opposition has long sought to wage economic warfare against the island because of its discrimination and repression of Shi’ites. Hence, it has encouraged multinational firms to leave Manama and has also protested the Bahrain Grand Prix. Gulf Air, Bahrain’s national airlines, might not have the reach of Emirates or Qatar Airlines, but it still brings significant revenue to the island. Could Iranian drones—operated directly by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or by proxy—be used to temporarily jam air traffic communications over the island’s airport? No accident need occur—just news of the incident would cripple air traffic into Manama.\n\nOr, consider Israel: The Federal Aviation Administration briefly banned U.S. airliners from flying into Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport after Hamas fired a rocket in the direction of the airport. That ban was likely a political decision on the part of the Obama White House and basically rewarded terrorism and put a target over the facility. Hezbollah has already used drones to overfly Israel.

I am here to stay,” she said.\n\nOn Saturday, she was in tears when security officials told her she would have to leave if she kept it. Olympic officials do not allow political statements at the games, though the 41-year-old Safai insists “it’s a gender message.”\n\nHer tears were of joy Monday, when Iran lost in straight sets but her voice was heard.

In addition to being unusual, this difference is important because it is one of elements that that has preserved the Jewish people over the centuries.\n\nWhat's 2000 years?\n\nAmericans think that 100 years is a long time. Many do. There are other nations that know better, for example the Greek and Italians who can see the evidence of their ancient history and know the impact their culture has had on the world.\n\nIt is not the existence of a glorious past or even the sheer number of years that make the difference - it is the way they are remembered. Time is shaped by memory.\n\nOn Tisha B'Av, the 9th day of the month of Av (Jewish calendar) we commemorated the day when both the first and second Temples were destroyed, the first by the Babylonians in 586 B.C.E.; the second by the Romans in 70 C.E.\n\nTisha B'Av is a day of mourning, fasting and introspection. Secular Jews may not fast but do spend the day thinking about hatred (which is what led to the destruction of the Temple) and how we can make our society a better, kinder place.\n\nThe Temple was destroyed in 70 C.E. it is now 2016. Nations rose and fell, borders were drawn and redrawn. Many wars occurred. A number of genocides. The Holocaust. Indoor plumbing, electricity, cars and the internet. It is next to impossible to fathom all the changes that have occurred in that time.\n\nOne thing has not changed. The Jewish people still exist, remember the Temple in the heart of Jerusalem and mourn its loss.\n\nThe Temple that stood on the Temple Mount was built on top of the Foundation Stone, the rock tradition says God used as a foundation for creating the world. The Ark of the Covenant was placed on top of the Foundation Stone, in the Holy of Holies, making the Temple the physical home of God in the world. God is intangible and everywhere but that is the spot that marked God's resting place thus making it the center of the world.\n\nThe Temple was the center of Jewish culture. It was the place the Nation of Israel looked to, gathered in and focused on. Destroying the Temple was meant to destroy the Jewish people. The exile that followed, scattering the Jews across the globe, should have eliminated any cohesive nationhood that existed. The people should have become like the nations they lived amongst and forgotten their Jewishness, that they belonged to Israel and that there is supposed to be a Temple on the mountain in the heart of Jerusalem.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nWhy?\n\nYou could say the religion helped preserve Jewish culture (and it did) but throughout history there have been other nations whose religion was not enough to preserve them. You could say sheer stubbornness. That is also true but many other people are also stubborn so obviously that is not enough either. People of faith will exclaim: \"It is God who made this so! The story of the Jewish people is that of prophesy being fulfilled.\"\n\nI believe most people view the restoration of Israel as miraculous, whether they believe it is a miracle from God or a man-made miracle of sheer determination. Either way the question becomes, how was this possible?\n\nIt is easy to forget. Do you remember what you did this day one year ago? Now try imagining 2000 years ago… impossible right?\n\nJewish time is different. It is fluid in a way no other time is, due to Jewish memory.\n\nEvery year when we celebrate Passover, tradition commands us that we REMEMBER being slaves in Egypt. It is not our ancestors who were saved from slavery, it is each and every one of us. We were slaves. We experienced the Exodus. The Torah was given to us.\n\nNot to people that lived thousands of years ago but to each and every one of us living today.\n\nEver since the Exodus from Egypt Jews have been telling their children that the rise from slavery to a free nation was their own personal miracle. Ever since Jews have been teaching their children to REMEMBER.\n\nToday many Jews have become secular. They may never pray at all or even believe in God and yet they still preserve the tradition of telling their children of the exodus from Egypt in the present tense: \"We were slaves in Egypt and God rescued us.\"\n\nJewish memory is reinforced with Jewish experiences.\n\nJewish women that light the Sabbath candles know that at the very same time there are women throughout their country and around the world doing the exact same thing. This is the same action and ritual that was done by countless women, over the generations, across the globe, for centuries. When I light the Sabbath candles I am not just me, I am also all of those women.\n\nJews lived (and are still living) in vastly different cultures. The experiences of Jews in India were different from those of Jews in France and yet they were also the same, connected by rituals, traditions, holidays, priorities and values that all stem from Judaism. Even the non-religious Jews knew they were connected by mutual heritage. Jews may live in other countries but they all belong to Israel.\n\nIt is the living memory that has preserved the traditions which, in turn have preserved Jewish culture. Our nationhood was not determined by the Temple that was the center of all Jewish experience or even by the possibility of living in the land where our nation belonged. Remembering our connection to God, Israel and each other did. Sometimes it was the nations that Jews lived amongst that helped us remember that we belonged to each other and not to them but it was always our belonging to the same memory that came first.\n\nAfter the re-establishment of Israel as the Jewish State many Jews feel that their belonging to the State can replace their sense of belonging to the traditions or religion. This is dangerous in that it weakens the ties of the collective memory.\n\nThe secular Jew may teach their children of the Exodus from Egypt but forget to teach about the Temple that was once at the heart of the Nation. Religious Jews remember to grieve for the Temple, for the connection to God and the rich culture that was lost. Many secular Jews do not see this as their personal loss and this is dangerous.\n\nMemory is what gave our people meaning and preserved it over centuries. It upheld the Jewish people through terrible experiences. It facilitates belonging, the connections of a nation between people who can live continents apart and still belong together and to the same country.\n\nJerusalem and the Temple Mount are central to all of this. They are what symbolize our connection to God and to the land of Israel. For centuries Jews have yearned for Jerusalem saying every year: \"Next year we will be in the rebuilt Jerusalem.\" Jewish weddings cannot be completed before the groom publically states that Jerusalem comes before all other joys and the destruction of the ancient Temple is commemorated. It is not our holidays or our rituals that have held the Jewish people together (although they have helped) it is our core, the anchor on earth, the center of Jewish consciousness and meaning: Jerusalem and the Temple that once stood in the heart of the city.\n\nIf this is forgotten or neglected what will preserve the nation in the years to come?\n\nWe have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

Mr. Halabi is accused of repurposing over the course of 10 years up to $7.2 million a year, in cash and materials, to Hamas. That’s approximately 60% of World Vision’s total aid to Gaza.\n\nThe broader problem is that due diligence for humanitarian aid in war and terror zones requires the allocation of significant resources and a professional staff capable of detaching itself from the pressures and sympathies of the local environment. World Vision, like most aid groups operating in Gaza, clearly failed in this respect.\n\nWorld Vision’s troubles in Gaza reflect the broader moral failures of the humanitarian-aid industry. The narrow vision of aid workers contribute to a willful blindness to terrorism. The competition for publicity and donations results in alliances with brutal regimes and corrupt warlords. But thanks to the NGO “halo effect,” many donors also neglect due diligence, instead relying on the pure reputation of the recipient organization.\n\nAid groups also need to obtain and use intelligence information, particularly regarding employees and their activities. Some of this can be developed internally, and some can be purchased from consulting firms. And instead of adopting the Palestinian culture of noncooperation with Israeli security, it is in the interests of these organizations to quietly open channels of communication and information sharing.\n\nThe Illiberal Left and Political Islam\n\nThe liberal dread of being labelled Islamophobic, a penchant for tolerating the intolerant, combined with the fear of provoking violence, has effectively silenced intelligent debate about the rise of political Islam in Europe and its impact on secular democratic politics. Over the past decade, not only the media but also the art world has opted for collusion and self-censorship.\n\nThe combination of Islamophobia, balance and the omnipresent threat of violence means that it has become impossible to organise a conference or even a debate on political Islam and freedom of expression on a British or Australian campus. The preoccupation with “safe spaces” on Western campuses, along with the fact that the Gulf States endow chairs in Islamic Studies at Oxford, Princeton and Griffith University in Australia further inhibits discussion. Of 198 member states of the UN, ninety-four have blasphemy laws and the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation regularly pushes for the UN Human Rights Council to recognise the defamation of religion.\n\nThe rising price of political freedom, it seems, is too high for many Western governments to pay. The long war for cultural freedom which began in 1989 is in serious danger of being lost. As Karl Popper observed of an earlier totalitarian threat to the open society, “If we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” We should therefore claim “in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant”. Unfortunately, this argument does not gets much air-time, let alone political support.\n\nThe UK media and the national student union now consider any mention of inconvenient facts about vote rigging in Asian, primarily Muslim communities, or the imposition of sharia law in some UK communities, as “Islamophobic”. Thus the Guardian, the BBC and academe ignore or condone the profound change in the character and conduct of UK politics that the resistible rise of Sadiq Khan and Naz Shah intimates.\n\n“Life imitates art, far more than art imitates life,” Oscar concluded his essay on lying. Yet the slow-motion collision of mainstream Islam with the multicultural transnational Left has led to a Ben Abbes-style transformation of liberal democratic London into a progressively illiberal, Islamophile Londonistan that exceeds even Houellebecq’s fervid imagination.\n\nMichael Lumish: This Week on Nothing Left (August 16, 2016)\n\nThese guys are a breath of fresh air.\n\nNothing Left - Episode 112 - 8/16/16\n\nRev Willem Glashouwer & Andrew Tucker (Christians for Israel)\n\nAussie Dave (Israellycool)\n\nJulie Nathan (Executive Council of Australian Jewry)\n\nMichael Kuttner (The Israel Resource News Agency)\n\nIsi Leibler (Jerusalem Post)\n\nSweden: The Silence of the Jews\n\n\"It pains me to have to admit this but anti-Semitism is not just tolerated in some sections of the British Muslim community; it is routine and commonplace. Any Muslims reading this article – if they are honest with themselves – will know instantly what I am referring to. It is our dirty little secret. You could call it the banality of Muslim anti-Semitism.\"— Mehdi Hasan, The New Statesman.\n\n\"There isn't much of a desire to do anything about it [the problem of antisemitism]. It should also be said that the so-called interfaith outreach work... achieves almost nothing. A couple of old bearded men get together and agree on some dietary thing they've got in common, but it doesn't solve the fact that anti-Semitism mainly comes from Muslim communities these days. ... that that's taught in many mosques and many Muslim schools...\"— Douglas Murray, British commentator.\n\nThe question that arises is, are the elites of Sweden in general suffering from a case of Stockholm syndrome? Are we encouraging our adversaries to Islamize Sweden, which in the long run, might result in the abolition of freedom of religion, forcing Jews and Christians to live as dhimmis [subjugated citizens] in humiliation?\n\nIf by allowing hundreds of thousands of Muslims to settle here -- people much more hateful of Jews than the average German during the Nazi era -- are we not in fact paving the way for another Holocaust?\n\nChristian Summer Conferences Offer Israel Blessings and Curses\n\nA segment of Christians is actually trying to delude the world into thinking the absurd: that the ancient Jews of Canaan and Judea are \"colonialists\" who are \"illegally occupying\" their own native land.\n\nSeemingly undeterred by their 2016 defeats, the Christian anti-Israel coalitions are regrouping for their next attacks, while pro-Israel Christian Zionist organizations -- including Christians United for Israel (CUFI), Friends of Israel (FOI), International Christian Embassy of Jerusalem (ICEJ) and Bridges for Peace, among others, continue to speak out and teach the facts and the truth about Israel to Christians throughout the U.S. and Europe.\n\nStill, the Bible gives us hope and assurance that there is a future day when Israel will be able to bask in the elusive peace it demonstrably continues to offer those who are trying to destroy it.\n\nA changing Crown Heights marks 25 years since Brooklyn 'pogrom'\n\nMuch has changed in Crown Heights in the past 25 years, since the accidental death of a black boy touched off three days of rioting in which black youths attacked religious Jews in the Brooklyn neighborhood.\n\nMany called it a riot. Some Jews call the events of Aug.19-21, 1991, a pogrom. And some blacks call it an uprising.\n\nYankel Rosenbaum, a graduate student affiliated with the area's prominent Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement, was killed when a group of black men stabbed and beat him, shattering his skull. Cars were overturned and set aflame. Bricks were thrown. Residents and reporters were pulled from cars and beaten. Stores were looted.\n\nThe violence left anguish in both communities, but also led to high-profile community programs intended to create racial reconciliation, many of which have since shut down.\n\nAnd some scars, on both sides of the racial divide, have yet to completely heal.\n\nBut today is a very different time in Crown Heights, where charming limestone row houses line side streets and prewar apartment buildings sit tall on the avenues. A growing number of young professionals are moving in from pricier parts of Brownstone Brooklyn and Manhattan in search of more affordable rents. Fancy boutiques and coffee shops are proliferating. There’s even a Starbucks.\n\nToday there is less open hostility between blacks and Jews, residents say, though still a high degree of separation, misunderstanding and suspicion. But there is far better communication between leaders of the respective communities, who are quick to quell misinformation when conflict occurs – which was part of what fed the rioting, according to a state-commissioned report issued in 1993.\n\nAnd today, Crown Heights’ blacks and Jews share a common adversary: gentrification.\n\nTelling It Like It Wasn’t\n\nFormer Times reporter looks back on coverage of the event, and what went wrong.\n\nYet, when I picked up the paper, the article I read was not the story I had reported. I saw headlines that described the riots in terms solely of race. “Two Deaths Ignite Racial Clash in Tense Brooklyn Neighborhood,” the Times headline said. And, worse, I read an opening paragraph, what journalists call a “lead,” that was simply untrue:\n\n“Hasidim and blacks clashed in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn through the day and into the night yesterday.”\n\nIn all my reporting during the riots I never saw — or heard of — any violence by Jews against blacks. But the Times was dedicated to this version of events: blacks and Jews clashing amid racial tensions. To show Jewish culpability in the riots, the paper even ran a picture — laughable even at the time — of a chasidic man brandishing an open umbrella before a police officer in riot gear. The caption read: “A police officer scuffling with a Hasidic man yesterday on President Street.”\n\nI was outraged but I held my tongue. I was a loyal Times employee and deferred to my editors. I figured that other reporters on the streets were witnessing parts of the story I was not seeing.\n\nBut then I reached my breaking point. On Aug. 21, as I stood in a group of chasidic men in front of the Lubavitch headquarters, a group of demonstrators were coming down Eastern Parkway. “Heil Hitler,” they chanted. “Death to the Jews.”\n\nPolice in riot gear stood nearby but did nothing.\n\nProposing ‘extreme vetting,’ Trump says no entry to US for anti-Semites\n\nDonald Trump said he would test would-be immigrants for anti-Semitic beliefs and that Israel would be a key ally in defeating radical Islam, unveiling a proposal for radically stepped up vetting measures for potential immigrants in a policy address Monday.\n\nSpeaking in Youngstown, Ohio, the Republican presidential nominee outlined national security policies that included what he called “extreme vetting” for would-be immigrants, including for those who would reject what he described as American values of tolerance.\n\n“We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people,” Trump ventured, promising to temporarily suspend immigration from “the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world” that export terrorism.\n\n“In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting.”\n\nSoros Hack Reveals Evidence of Systemic Anti-Israel Bias\n\nAccording to one document, for example, the Arab Regional Office Presidential Portfolio Review, dated August 6, 2015, the Soros network has given $2,688,561 in 14 grants since 2001 to Adalah. A self-described “independent human rights organization” that has been instrumental in accusing Israel of war crimes on numerous occasions in international forums, Adalah has called on governments the world over to sever or downgrade their diplomatic relations with Israel. An additional $1,083,000 in nine grants since 2003 went to I’lam, a Nazareth-based Palestinian media center. In a 2014 publication about the Nakba—the name Palestinians give the creation of the state of Israel, literally meaning “catastrophe”—the center accused Israel of ethnic cleansing and argued that “the practical meaning of the Nakba undermines the moral and ethical foundation of Zionism and, hence, of the State of Israel.” Other similar-minded organizations received similarly large grants, sometimes through the auspices of another Soros grantee, the New Israel Fund, which supported many of the same NGOs.\n\nBut perhaps more instructive than the list of grantees itself is Arab Regional Office’s 2014 portfolio review document of the Palestine/Israel international advocacy portfolio, a deep and candid dive into the Soros network’s goals and ambitions in the region.\n\nThe ARO, the report indicates, was motivated in part by what it perceived as “a particular shift in political dynamics particularly in the US reflected by the publication of the Walt and Mearsheimer article ‘The Israel Lobby’ in Spring 2006 which pointe"
