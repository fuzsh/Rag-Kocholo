        "text": "The Challenge\n\nRehovot is near the Mediterranean coast, south of Tel Aviv. Rehovot is a city of science, as it is home to both the Weizmann Institute of Science as well as the Hebrew University’s Faculty of Agriculture. The city is historically known for its citrus groves and today is home to the Minkov Citrus Orchard Museum.\n\nIn 2016 Rehovot had a population of about 132,700, with Ethiopian-Israelis comprising 5.3% of the population at around 7,100 people.\n\nEthiopian-Israelis in Rehovot\n\nThe Ethiopian-Israeli community has tremendous potential, but needs a helping hand to help it in its transition from an agrarian life to Israel’s fast-paced modern technological society. Even Israeli-born children of Ethiopian Jewish immigrants face tremendous challenges, different to those of their immigrant peers, but in some ways, even greater."
