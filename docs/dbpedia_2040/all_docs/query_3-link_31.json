        "text": "How do people get around?:\n\nA lot of people in my city do have cars. I am lucky enough to have a teacher who drives me to school every morning. Some of the other teachers drive me home from school in the afternoon.\n\nWhen I do not have a ride to school or to get around the city, I usually take the bus, which is a popular mode of transportation throughout Rehovot. As I said in my first logbook, we have Rav Kavs, which are monthly bus passes that help us to get around Rehovot. There are buses that will take you throughout the city of Rehovot and also to other major cities and towns, like Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. When traveling to the more distant areas of Israel, like the Golan Heights in the North, the bus is the best mode of transportation. You usually have to take multiple buses to get to your final destination.\n\nSome people ride their bikes around the city of Rehovot. At the moment, electric bikes are very popular in Israel.\n\nPages"
