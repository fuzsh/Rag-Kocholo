That proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card are being furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, in a Report of Foreign Private Issuer on Form 6-K, which may be obtained for free from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and from our website at http://www.evogene.com/investor-relations/. The proxy statement and proxy card are also available on MAGNA, the distribution site of the Israeli Securities Authority, at www.magna.isa.gov.il, and copies thereof may furthermore be obtained by contacting our Company at 13 Gad Feinstein Street, Park Rehovot, Rehovot, 7638517, Israel, Attention: Guy Kofman, Legal Advisor and Nitsan Deutsch, VP Legal Affairs & Company Secretary, e-mail addresses guy.kofman@evogene.com, nitsan.deutsch@evogene.com, telephone number (+972-8-931-1900).\n\nHolders of record of our ordinary shares (including beneficial holders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee that is a holder of record) as of the close of business on Friday, May 3, 2024 are entitled to vote at the Meeting.\n\nAll shareholders are cordially invited to attend the Meeting in person. If you are unable to attend the Meeting in person, you should vote or provide voting instructions remotely in one of the below manners, depending on how you hold your ordinary shares. Detailed voting instructions will be provided both in the proxy statement and on the proxy card or voting instruction form that will be sent to you:\n\n•\n\nIf you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by completing, dating and signing the enclosed form of proxy, which should be mailed, postage-free (if mailed in the United States) in the enclosed envelope to our United States transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company.

We reserve the right to require additional identifying information if you submit your proxy card directly to our Company in that manner.

If you send in your proxy card directly to our registered office, it must be received at least four (4) hours prior to the appointed time for the Meeting on Thursday, June 6, 2024.\n\n•\n\nIf your ordinary shares are held beneficially in \"street name\", that is, in a bank or brokerage account or by a trustee or nominee, on the Nasdaq Stock Market, you should complete and submit the enclosed physical voting instruction form or an online voting instruction form (at www.proxyvote.com) in order to direct your broker, trustee or nominee how to vote your shares.
