        "text": "Two years ago we published Yael Horowitz's article here, about the fascinating life story of a Haifa resident, Dov Kosovsky. This week Dov passed away and he is 88 and a half years old. We bring the article again for your perusal.\n\nMay the memory of Dov be blessed!\n\n\"לDespite the difficulties we went through during the British Mandate period and in the first years of the State of Israel's life - I had the most wonderful childhood and choices in the world.\" This is what Dov (Dubik) Kosovsky told me at our meeting. I knew Dubik in the nostalgic Facebook groups of Haifa, when from time to time he shared fragments of memories from his childhood in Haifa of Once upon a time. I admired the many details he remembered and recommended that he record his memories in the scriptures. Recently, to the joy of all of us, his book was published: \"Three Souls and Love for All.\" For the purpose of this article, the fourth in the series, I chose to edit excerpts from Dubik's fascinating memories.\n\nDescendants of Cardinal Richelieu\n\nArmand Jau de Plessis, commonly known as \"Cardinal Richelieu\", was a French Catholic statesman and churchman. After being appointed in 1616 as the head of the government apparatus in France, he gained great power in the religious and governmental establishment while exploiting the weakness of King Louis XIII.\n\n\"Among the cardinal's offspring from his many wives,\" says Dubik, \"was a daughter he particularly loved. However, she, disgusted by her father's behavior towards the Jewish people, decided to deepen her studies of Judaism and Kabbalah and fled from France to Tsarist Russia. There, in Rostov, she converted, changed her name, inspired by the prophetess Deborah, and married to a local rabbi.\n\nLater, when her father the cardinal felt that his days were numbered, he decided to bequeath her his great fortune. My grandmother, named after Deborah, the cardinal's daughter and I am one of his descendants... In 1905, my grandparents left Rostov with their children: Abrasha (Abraham), Yenia (Yona), Gandi (Gedalia, he is my father) and Kotik (Kelman). They wandered throughout Russia, on a journey following the cardinal's treasure and finally settled in Tbilisi, the capital of today's Georgia. Even when the second Bolshevik revolution broke out, in 1917, my grandfather and grandfather did not stop the search for the treasure, but without success.\"\n\nFather immigrates to Palestine\n\n\"One day, on his return from school, while the calls of the revolutionaries echoed in his ears, father decided to leave Russia and go alone to Palestine. He hitchhiked to Constantinople (today's Istanbul), where he worked in a fish factory, for carp and plamids. About a year later, when he had saved a little money, he managed Bribe the skipper of a fishing ship to smuggle him into an empty saltwater barrel on board his ship. This is how Father arrived at the port of Jaffa... In the summer of 1919, Father arrived at the port of Jaffa and visited the \"Immigrant House\". The 16-year-old boy's clothes reeked of the sour fish smell he had absorbed while there inside the barrel for many days, which caused the escape of those present from the building and the father, rolling with laughter...\"\n\n\"We will be among the builders\"\n\n\"In the immigrant home, father was equipped with a little money and a note for a clothing store in Tel Aviv. Without knowing a word of Hebrew, father found a job as a plasterer's apprentice and later worked in the construction of the Reading station. When Rotenberg was looking for \"Muscovites\" (Russian expatriates) to build the Narayim station, it was only natural that father would be appointed to The staff. In the early twenties of the last century, father also worked for a short time in the \"Labor Battalion\" in Ein Harod and Tel Yosef. With the money that father was able to save, he helped his family members immigrate to Palestine and even found a job for his brother in Israel.\"\n\nDad was injured\n\n\"The construction workers migrated throughout the country following the work. When the national institutions sent young Jews to work in the Haifa port and to dry part of the sea for the purpose of building rigid piers, father found himself working in drying \"Kings Way\", which is today's Haifa's Independence Street.\n\nIt was in 1922, when father was coming down from the direction of Wadi Salib for his work, a young Arab pounced on him on the steps of Ajlon and gouged out his left eye. Father was hospitalized in the government hospital, he is today's Rambam and he was fitted with a glass eye. Despite his severe injury, father returned to work and when Novomeisky founded the Dead Sea factories, father was also called to flag and was on the company's founding team.\"\n\nA beautiful girl with good eyes\n\nIn 1932, at a Purim ball in Tel Aviv, he met Gadalia You Pretty, A beautiful young girl who immigrated to Israel alone from Grodno in White Russia. Later, most of her family members perished in the Holocaust.\n\nAt the beginning of her journey in Israel, Yaffe found shared accommodation with some young Arab women, at the Stairs of the Prophets in Haifa. That's how she learned to cook from them and they learned to sew clothes from her.\n\nAfter their marriage, Yaffe and Gadalia rented a one-room apartment on HaShalom Street 12 in Hadar HaCarmel, where Dubik was born and grew up until the age of 5. His father continued to work in construction throughout the country. Gedaliah's parents lived not far from there on HaShalom Street.\n\nChildhood memories of HaShalom Street\n\n\"The room we lived in,\" says Dubik, \"was part of a large apartment in which other families, Jewish and Arab, lived. The bathroom, the toilet, and the kitchen were shared, and each family had set times to use the shower and the kitchen. The primus and the wicks belonged to the Arab families, and the Jewish families paid a usage fee for them. .\n\nDad left for work at five in the morning, with a sack full of tools on his back. When work was out of town, he slept with his friends in the building where they worked. Among other things, father worked in road construction in the Jezreel Valley and the Jordan Valley. Most of the work was done by hand, when the asphalt was pressed by a press with a chimney. Every evening, when he came home from the hard work, mother and I took off his shoes and socks with asphalt residues on them and mother smeared his burnt hands with cooking oil and dressed them.\n\nOnce a week, my mother would bring a washer from the \"laundry market\". On the large primus on the balcony, there was a huge pot, where mother boiled the laundry. I remember the laundress, sitting in a wide circle and vigorously washing the clothes as she soaps them on the corrugated tin plate placed on the pila, with the help of a block of \"fat\" soap.\n\nFrom a young age I spoke Russian at home, and when I played outside with the neighbor's children, I spoke Arabic. I loved watching the Arab masons, who with incredible skill chiseled curbstones for the sidewalks, stones for the street steps and for the construction of the houses, all with the help of only a trowel and chisel hammer.\n\nEven the horned porters fascinated me a lot as a child. I remember them relatively tall, walking barefoot. Although, they were not particularly broad-shouldered, but their carrying capacity was impressive. Many hired them at that time to move apartments. Each of them, equipped with a huge basket on his back, tied with a ribbon to his forehead, carried a bed alone and sometimes even an oversized closet.\"\n\nLooking forward to the cinema\n\n\"We, the children, used to \"watch\" movies at the Ein Dor Cinema and the Palace Cinema, through the bathroom windows in the courtyard. The translation was projected from a mirror on the wall. A moment after the roof of the Palace Cinema closed and the movie began, fights began between the groups sitting on both sides of the hall: the Arab children on the right wing And us, on the left wing. \"Karna\" cut bottles started flying from side to side and, of course, piles of kernel shells, which we bought at the entrance of the cinema, at the makeshift booth in the donkey-drawn cart. A similar scene was also at the Ein Dor cinema.\"\n\nFather enlists in the British Army\n\n\"With the outbreak of World War II, the national institutions called for young people to enlist and fight the Nazi oppressor. Due to his injury, father was sent to serve in the military camp in Nesher.\n\nMother, who was pregnant, had a miscarriage in the meantime and was admitted to the \"Batar\" hospital, and father received special permission from his commander, the Australian sergeant, to bring me to the camp. Later, my father from the British Army brought me a German shepherd named Rex who from that day accompanied me to school and protected me from stone throwers.\n\nIn order to defend against an attack on Haifa, the British built smoke towers around strategic facilities, including the refineries, the port and the fuel tank in the bay. Every time the smoke mask was activated, there was a heavy smell that made us all shut up in our houses.\n\nOne evening, my father put a disk around my neck with my name and my parents' name on it. The next day, I was sent in a truck along with many of the children of Haifa to a camp south of Haifa, which would be operated by members of the \"Haganah\". About two months later, when the situation allowed, we were returned home.\"\n\nA meeting with the \"children of Tehran\"\n\n\"One day in 1943,\" Dubik recalled, \"the teacher handed us a note meant for parents, in which she asked us to bring to the Hadassah hospital in Hadar, food and items of clothing for children who had just arrived from the Nazi inferno.\n\nFrom all ends of Hadar Carmel we gathered, playful and cheerful as is our custom, with in our hands items of clothing and food prepared by the parents, to give them to the \"children of Tehran\".\n\nWhen we arrived at the place, we suddenly fell silent. Through the windows reflected the image of children with sad faces. We tried to make them laugh through the window, but we didn't succeed. Not a muscle in the children's faces moved. We saw the suffering in their faces but didn't really understand and didn't know how to react.\n\nThe \"Hagana\" people guarding the entrance did not allow us to enter. They took the packages from us and sent us on our way. A few days later, the children were scattered in settlements and kibbutzim.\n\nFor a long time we remained stunned and shocked. This sad sight remains etched in my heart forever.\"\n\nMoving to Tel Amal\n\n\"In 1944, His Majesty's government released soldiers who were not needed for the war effort, including Father, who returned to his job as a plasterer. Upon his release, Father purchased a small apartment with the money he had saved in the \"Diskin Houses\" in the Tel Amal neighborhood (today, Par Street). The neighborhood was built with the aim of cutting between Halisa the Arab and Neve Shanan on the back of the mountain, to maintain a single transportation route between the north and the city of Haifa.\n\nMany of the residents of the neighborhood were members of the \"Haganah\", and my father was among them. On the mountain near us, lives a family Laskov, whose son, Chaim, was a major in the Jewish Brigade and later, Chief of Staff of the IDF. From time to time father would disappear with Laskov for two or three hours and we understood that this was a secret activity.\n\nThe children of the neighborhood studied in different places in Hadar. I, who studied at the Bialik Gymnasium, sometimes walked from Tel Amal, Halisa Road and Rushmiya Bridge. Once every two or three days, I went on foot with some of my friends to the industrial house to buy a quarter of an ice block that was used to cool the food at home.\"\n\nThe war of liberation\n\n\"At a certain point, I and some of my friends were recruited to help the \"Haganah\" members in the Diskin houses: our job was to bring weapons and sandwiches to the positions as well as disassemble, clean and assemble the German Mauser guns.\n\nThe day after the UN resolution in November 1947, fire was opened from the direction of Beit Hanjada on a bus transporting Jewish laborers to work. The Tel Amal neighborhood came under siege and the difficult situation became more complex day by day.\n\nDue to the danger of traveling, I stopped my studies during the war and joined my friends in logistical help for the guards at the positions, in cleaning and maintaining the guns and in providing warm clothing, food and drink. Two days before the eve of Passover in 1948, Haim Laskov came to our house to pick up father. This was the beginning of the battles for the liberation of the city of Haifa, in which Father fought with the soldiers of the IDF (Guards Corps, for later - reserves).\"\n\nThe announcement of the establishment of the state\n\n\"The day the last British commissioner left the Land of Israel on a British destroyer, I remember well. I was 13 and a half years old, we were sitting in our house in Tel Amal. Mother was washing the floors and suddenly we heard on the old Philips radio the announcement of the establishment of the State of Israel in the voice of David Ben-Gurion. A moment mother jumped up, with the mop in her hand, Mary Poppins style... the three of us hugged happily.\n\nThe morning after the announcement, the young country was in an all-out war with the Arab countries and an austerity regime was introduced to ration food, clothing and furniture, which made our daily lives very difficult.\"\n\nAfter the liberation of Haifa"
