        "text": "Event\n\nA rocket fired from the Gaza Strip struck a residential building in Rehovot in the Central District late May 11. At least two people were injured. The rocket also caused significant material damage. The attack comes amid an ongoing conflict between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) militant group. Rehovot is 20 km (12 miles) south of Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli forces will almost certainly launch retaliatory strikes on suspected militant targets in the Gaza Strip. Heightened security measures are likely across Israel, particularly in the Southern and Central districts, over the coming hours. Gaza-based militants may fire additional rockets at communities in southern and central Israel over the coming hours and days; precautionary measures, such as evacuations, are possible in affected areas.\n\nAdvice\n\nMonitor local media and abide by security forces' directives. If incoming mortar rounds or rockets are reported or warning sirens sound in the general vicinity, report to the nearest bomb shelter and await further instructions from authorities. If there is no shelter nearby, stay indoors, away from windows and exterior walls. If possible, move to a ground floor or basement."
