        "text": "CHESS‚Äî‚ÄúThe Queen's Gambit‚Äù - such a beautiful and precious gift from Adam Wojciechowski, an extraordinary artist and friend. __________________________ ‚ú® The chess pieces from this work are made of 925 sterling silver (total weight 1.658 kg, price per gram $0.8096). ‚ú® They are rhodium-plated using the vermeil technique (total weight of rhodium 6 grams, price per gram $282, layer thickness 3.5 micrometers) and fire-gilded using the vermeil technique (total weight of gold 9 grams, price per gram $64.03, layer thickness 6.5 micrometers). It is noteworthy that rhodium is much more expensive than gold and platinum. ‚ú® To create the chess set, 328 precious stones were used, set without glue or soldering, only in the silver mass. ‚ú® The centers of the pieces are made from certified 3,950-year-old black bog oak and mahogany. ‚ú® The chess set consists of 428 elements, which may surprise those not involved in jewelry design. For example, a ring with a stone usually consists of 2 to 5 components. ---------------------- üí¨ A word from the artist: \"Here is the result of two years of work, which began with the first sketches and led to creating a unique chess set. Designing the chess set involved many stages, including 3D design, prototyping, producing rubber molds for lost wax casting, production strategy planning, and various other activities to prepare for artisanal production. I must admit that during the project, I had moments when I thought about giving up, but thanks to God, I could persevere and create a chess set that I am very proud of.\" Adam Wojciechowski #fineart #art #poland #chess"
