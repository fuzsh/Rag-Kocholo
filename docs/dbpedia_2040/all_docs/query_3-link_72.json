Ben-Ami & Associates was established with the ambition to bring a new approach to working with inventors and companies. Members of our staff have a high professional profile and some held high-level managerial and entrepreneurial positions in the industry, and thus are well positioned to evaluate the best patent strategy to achieve your business goals. Ben-Ami & Associates has a team of Patent Attorneys and technical advisors that can handle and provide advice on intellectual property matters in most technological areas, particularly in all fields of Life Sciences and Chemistry including, among others, inventions in the pharmaceutical, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, nanotechnology, material chemistry, diagnostics, cosmetics, agricultural and veterinary areas, as well as in a variety of High-Tech fields, such as Telecommunications, Computer software, Computer hardware, Electronics, Electro optics, Internet-related applications, Business Methods, Medical devices ,and many other areas. Among our clients are leading universities, academic institutions and biotech companies as well as small and mid-size companies and independent inventors.\n\nWe filed a patent in the field of medical devices with the Paulina Ben Ami Patent Attorneys firm. First and foremost, we had the privilege of working with highly professional individuals in a friendly atmosphere with full cooperation. The combination of deep technological understanding, creative thinking, and mastery of the patent field by the team, and especially Zeev, enabled us to file a unique patent. The advice and support in the strategic management of the patent, its registration, and maintenance also allowed us to save a significant amount of money, which is especially critical for a small startup company in its early stages. We are confident that the firm played a very significant role in the success of our patent policy.\n\nDr. Nurit Ayel, CEO"
