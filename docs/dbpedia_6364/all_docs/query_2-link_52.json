        "text": "The Thursday Murder Club movie has been filming since June and still has at least a month to go.\n\nWe might not yet have a confirmed release date for the highly-anticipated adaptation of Richard Osman's bestselling books, but we have been treated to a first look at the titular club.\n\nNetflix released an image of author Richard Osman with director Chris Colombus on set with Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Sir Ben Kingsley and Celia Imrie in character as Elizabeth, Ron, Ibrahim and Joyce, respectively.\n\nWe haven't had any looks at the supporting cast, including David Tennant and Naomi Ackie – but hopefully, we'll get some other teasers before the end of production in September.\n\nAs filming continues, here's everything you need to know about The Thursday Murder Club movie.\n\nThursday Murder Club potential release date: When can we expect The Thursday Murder Club movie?\n\nAs of August 2024, we don't yet have an official release date for The Thursday Murder Club movie.\n\nHowever, we do know that Netflix will now be releasing the movie. Osman has also confirmed that the film will get a cinema release too, before its streaming debut.\n\nAs with most Netflix movies, we'd expect it to be a limited run of around two weeks before it arrives on the streaming service.\n\nFilming is under way, having started on June 27, 2024. Osman previously confirmed on podcast that they'll be filming \"from [the] end of June through to September\" in England.\n\nHopefully, that means we'll get to see the movie in 2025 at some point, but all we can do is watch this space for now.\n\nThere's also a theatre show in the works, but we wouldn't expect to see that before the movie.\n\nThursday Murder Club cast: Who's going to be in The Thursday Murder Club movie?\n\nAs mentioned above, we now know who will play the four crime-solving pensioners.\n\nAfter rumours linking them to the roles, Osman confirmed on April 23, 2024, that Helen Mirren is playing former spy Elizabeth Best, Pierce Brosnan is playing trade union official Ron Ritchie, and Sir Ben Kingsley is playing psychiatrist Ibrahim Arif.\n\nIt was then announced on May 21, 2024, that Celia Imrie will be playing nurse Joyce Meadowcraft, following rumours linking her – and other names such as Dame Judi Dench – to the role.\n\nAs mentioned above, we got our first look at the actors in character on July 12, 2024.\n\nThe first supporting cast members were revealed by Osman on June 18, 2024 as David Tennant, Naomi Ackie, Jonathan Pryce, Danny Mays and Henry Lloyd-Hughes.\n\nWe know that Ackie is playing police officer Donna, while Pryce is playing Elizabeth's husband Stephen.\n\nIt's not yet been confirmed who the other three cast members are playing, but we wouldn't be surprised to see Mays as Donna's boss DCI Chris Hudson.\n\nAnd then shortly after filming started, Osman announced that his wife Ingrid Oliver had joined the cast as Joyce's daughter Joanna, alongside Richard E Grant, Sarah Niles, Tom Ellis, Geoff Bell and Paul Freeman.\n\nNiles is playing Donna's mother Patrice and Grant has been cast as a \"baddie\", but we don't have character details for the other cast as of yet.\n\nBehind the scenes, Chris Columbus – who directed the first two Harry Potter movies, as well as the likes of Home Alone and Mrs Doubtfire – is writing and directing the movie.\n\nAccording to Osman, Colombus praised the cast as \"the greatest British cast assembled since the Harry Potter movies\".\n\nThursday Murder Club plot: What will The Thursday Murder Club movie be about?\n\nWhen the Netflix news was announced, we got our first official synopsis for The Thursday Murder Club movie, but it's vague:\n\n\"The story follows a group of friends in a retirement home who gather to solve murders for fun, but find themselves caught in a real case.\"\n\nRight now, we'd have to assume that the movie will follow the story of the first book.\n\nOsman's debut novel saw the titular group tackle their first-ever live case after a property developer is murdered in their quiet Cooper's Chase retirement village, near the fictional village of Fairhaven in Kent.\n\nThink Death in Paradise, only if it was set in rural England and contained numerous references to Robert Dyas, Holby City and Waitrose.\n\nIt's possible that the movie will see the group investigate a different case, but we have a feeling that if it's going to go away from the book series, it would do that in a sequel once the crime-solving pensioners have been established in the first movie.\n\nThursday Murder Club trailer: Any footage of The Thursday Murder Club movie yet?\n\nFilming has begin, but we don't yet have any footage to show you from The Thursday Murder Club movie yet. But we'll update this as soon as we do."
