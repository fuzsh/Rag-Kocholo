        "text": "The third installment in the A Quiet Place franchise, titled \"A Quiet Place: Day One,\" is on the way, but fans will have to wait a little longer for it to arrive. As the SAG-AFTRA strike continues, Variety reported on Oct. 23 that Paramount Pictures has shuffled its upcoming film releases, including \"A Quiet Place: Day One,\" which has been pushed from spring 2024 to the summertime. However, the movie's buzzy cast may make up for the delay.\n\nPer Deadline, the spinoff film stars \"Black Panther\" star Lupita Nyong'o, \"Stranger Things\"'s Joseph Quinn, \"Oppenheimer\"'s Alex Wolff, \"Shazam!\"'s Djimon Hounsou, and \"American Horror Story\" star Denis O'Hare. Paramount green-lit the movie — which is based on an idea from John Krasinski, who wrote and directed the franchise's first two films — back in November 2020, but details didn't surface until April's CinemaCon, during which Krasinski unveiled the first look at the film.\n\nWhile we aren't sure how \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" will top the massive success of the original and 2020's \"Part II,\" the hope is that it'll set up a universe for more movies in years to come.\n\n\"A Quiet Place\" is a suspenseful horror flick that sees the Abbotts, a family of four, navigate their lives in a postapocalyptic world as they attempt to avoid mysterious monsters who only hunt by sound. The film, which stars Krasinski and his wife, Emily Blunt, opened globally to $71 million at the box office in 2018 but only snagged a single Oscar nomination the following year for best original score.\n\nThe franchise's second film is both a prequel and a sequel to 2018's \"A Quiet Place.\" Not only do we learn how the creepy alien monsters first came to Earth, but we also learn a few of their biggest weaknesses. For one, they aren't able to swim — meaning people who are on an island are safe from their attacks — but they also hate sound.\n\nThere's no telling what other unknowns the third film will reveal. Read ahead for everything we know about \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" so far, including its new release date.\n\n\"A Quiet Place: Day One\" Cast\n\nThe third film's cast includes Nyong'o, Quinn, Wolff, Hounsou, and O'Hare. It's unclear if it will include any of the original \"A Quiet Place\" stars — Blunt, Krasinski, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe. Michael Sarnoski wrote the screenplay and directed.\n\n\"A Quiet Place: Day One\" Plot\n\nNo official plot details for the third movie have been teased yet, but it'll be set in the same universe as the original \"A Quiet Place\" film. According to Krasinski's CinemaCon reveal, it'll diverge from the Abbott family story. The movie will serve as a spinoff, not a sequel, though it's unclear how it'll connect back to \"A Quiet Place\" and \"A Quiet Place Part II.\"\n\nAs Deadline reported, Krasinski noted that the new movie will follow Nyong'o's character as she navigates the first horrifying moments in \"the loudest city in the world, New York.\" The story reportedly \"takes us back to where it all began.\" The last A Quiet Place film concluded with a big cliffhanger with its characters, who find a way to kill the monsters once and for all, which could lead to a potential story clue for \"A Quiet Place: Day One.\" Only time will tell.\n\n\"A Quiet Place: Day One\" Release Date\n\nThe third installment was originally set to hit theaters on March 8, 2024, though its new release date is June 28, 2024, per Variety."
