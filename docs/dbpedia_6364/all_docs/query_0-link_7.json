        "text": "Born Hugh Ryan Conway of Irish ancestry, Jack Conway was one of a team of MGM contract directors (others included Sam Wood and Robert Z. Leonard), who forsook any pretense to a specific individual style in favor of working within the strictures set forth by studio management--as embodied by Irving Thalberg and his production supervisors. The overall MGM strategy was to streamline efficiency and achieve tighter fiscal control by curbing the power of the director. Deeply suspicious of creative, individualistic filmmakers who would jeopardize the \"studio look\", Thalberg and MGM chief Louis B. Mayer hoped to prevent such budgetary excesses as had been perpetrated by directors like Erich von Stroheim during the 1920s. Conway contented himself with working under these guidelines. A thoroughly competent craftsman, he delivered commercially successful entertainments on time and within budget.\n\nConway had started out in the industry as an actor, joining a repertory theatre group straight out of high school. He segued into film acting in 1909. Two years later he became a member of D.W. Griffith's stock company, appearing primarily as a leading man in westerns. In 1913 he made his mark as a director and gained valuable experience at Universal (1916-17, 1921-23) before moving on to MGM in 1925. He directed the studio's first sound picture, Alias Jimmy Valentine (1928). He remained under contract until 1948, often in charge of prestige assignments featuring the studio's top male star, Clark Gable: Der Draufgänger (1940), Ein toller Bursche (1941), Der Windhund und die Lady (1947)--all solid box-office gold. For his most famous film, Flucht aus Paris (1935), Conway utilized 17,000 extras in the Paris mob scenes alone. This spectacular adaptation of the classic novel by Charles Dickens is still regarded by many as the definitive screen version.\n\nAnother popular hit was the sophisticated all-star comedy Lustige Sünder (1936), the \"New York Times\" reviewer commenting on Conway's \"agile direction\" (Oct. 31, 1936). The journeyman director may not have achieved fame as a creative genius, yet the majority of his films remain eminently entertaining to this day. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Vine Street.\n\nKing Vidor was an American film director, film producer, and screenwriter of Hungarian descent. He was born in Galveston, Texas to lumberman Charles Shelton Vidor and his wife Kate Wallis. King's paternal grandfather Károly (Charles) Vidor had fled Hungary as a refugee following the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848 (1849-1849). The Kingdom of Hungary had attempted to gain independence from the Austrian Empire, but the revolutionary troops failed against the allied armies of the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under brutal martial law. Karoly fled the country and settled in Galveston, Texas by the early 1850s.\n\nDuring his childhood, King Vidor was a witness of the 1900 Galveston hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster in United States history. The hurricane caused between 6,000 and 12,000 fatalities in the United States, based on varying estimates. Most of these deaths occurred in the vicinity of Galveston. Every house in the city sustained damage, about 3600 houses were completely destroyed, and an estimated 10,000 people were left homeless, out of a population of about 38,000. King Vidor would later give a somewhat fictionalized account of his hurricane experience in a 1935 interview.\n\nBy the early 1910s, Vidor was working as a freelance newsreel cameraman and cinema projectionist. In 1913, he directed the short film \"The Grand Military Parade\", his directing debut. In 1915, Vidor moved to Hollywood, California and was hired as a screenwriter and short-film director by Judge Willis Brown (1881-1931), owner of the Boy City Film Company in Culver City. Brown had gained fame as a judge of the Utah Juvenile Court and a progressive expert on boys' reformation, but had been kicked out of service when it was discovered that he did not actually have a law degree. Brown had established himself as a film producer in order to produce films depicting his main concerns about American society: juvenile delinquency and racial discrimination. Vidor served as a screenwriter and director of at least 10 films with these topics, while working for Brown.\n\nIn 1919, Vidor directed his first feature film: \"The Turn in the Road\". It was a silent drama film, depicting a businessman who loses his faith in God and any interest in industry, when his beloved wife dies in childbirth. Vidor's first major hit was the feature \"Peg o' My Heart\" (1922), an adaptation of a popular Broadway theatrical play. Following this success, Vidor was signed to a long-term contract for the studio Goldwyn Pictures. The studio was under the administration of Polish-American producer Samuel Goldwyn (1879-1974). In 1924, Goldwyn Pictures merged with Metro Pictures and Louis B. Mayer Pictures into a new company: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Vidor remained on contract with this new company.\n\nIn the 1920s, Vidor's most famous silent feature films were the war film \"The Big Parade\" (1925), the Academy-Award nominated drama \"The Crowd\" (1928), the comedy \"Show People\"\" (1928), and the comedy-drama \"The Patsy\" (1928). His first sound film was the drama \"Hallelujah\" (1929), about the life of sharecroppers. It was one of the first Hollywood films with a cast consisting fully of African-Americans. Vidor expressed an interest in \"showing the Southern Negro as he is\" and attempted to depict African-American life beyond the popular stereotypes of the era.\n\nVidor faced no problem in transitioning from silent film to sound film, and continued regularly working on feature films until the late 1950s. His last major film was the Biblical-romance \"Solomon and Sheba\" (1959), featuring love, court intrigues, and military invasions during the reign of legendary Solomon, King of Israel (estimated to the 10th century BC). Afterwards he worked on short films and documentaries, his last film being the documentary \"The Metaphor\" (1980). The 86-year-old Vidor chose to retire from filmmaking in 1980.\n\nIn 1982, at the age of 88, Vidor died at his ranch in Paso Robles, California from an unspecified heart disease. His remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered in his ranch.\n\nVidor was nominated 5 times for the Academy Award for Best Director, without ever winning. He was nominated for the feature films \"The Crowd\" (1928), \"Hallelujah\" (1929), \"The Champ\" (1931), \"The Citadel\" (1938), and \"War and Peace\" (1956). He won an Academy Honorary Award in 1979. Part of his modern fame rests on an uncredited part as an assistant director. Vidor directed the scenes set in Kansas for the novel adaptation \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939).\n\nEdward \"Eddie\" Cline began his career in the film business as one of the Keystone Kops. The former vaudevillian appeared sporadically in films as an actor until 1922, but became increasingly active behind the camera as a gagman and scenario writer for Mack Sennett. From 1916 he worked on a steady stream of two-reelers, either as director or assistant director, for such comedians as Buster Keaton, Ford Sterling and Mack Swain. An expert in slapstick comedy with an unerring sense of timing, Cline was consistently in demand by Hollywood studios during the 1920s and served short-term contracts with Fox (the \"Sunshine\" comedies), Pathe, First National, MGM and Paramount.\n\nDuring the sound era he had more periods of steadier employment, particularly at Universal (1939-45). He became the favorite director of comedian W.C. Fields. In fact, Fields would often demand Cline's participation, much to the consternation of the studios. In one instance, director Edward Sedgwick was assigned to the Fields comedy Ehrlich währt am längsten (1939), but was replaced by Cline just two days into shooting because he couldn't get along with Fields. Cline frequently worked out comedy routines by standing in for the Fields character in rehearsals. As for being able to get along with the notoriously prickly star, Cline believed in just \"letting him run with it\" and later editing out any unwanted ad-libs (which Fields had a habit of inserting at the end of his lines). Unfortunately, those famous ad-libs often tended to crack up the camera crew and ruin the take . . .\n\nCline directed Fields in some of his funniest comedies, including Mein kleiner Gockel (1940) and Der Bankdetektiv (1940) (the climactic car chase was largely due to Cline's input). He teamed up once more with Keaton for the anachronistic slapstick farce Die Unschuld und der Bösewicht (1940). Cline's output diminished by the mid-'40s and he retired from directing in 1951."
