Fede Alvarez directs this continuation of Ridley Scott's cult film series.\n\nThe clock ticks for an police detective trying to solve a string of murders in this contemporary neo-noir by Wei Shujun.\n\nDirector Ibrahim Nash’at spends a year inside Afghanistan following the Taliban as they take possession of the cache America left behind in this eye-opening documentary.\n\nA bold documentary that chronicles the people and dancers of the National Ballet of Canada as they put on a new production of Swan Lake.\n\nA new teacher at a failing school in Mexico engages his students with an unconventional approach to learning, in the heart warming drama from Christopher Zalla.\n\nShusuke Kaneko’s 1995 blockbuster trades the campy, kid-friendly surrealism of the earlier films for a darker, more realistic tone and innovative special effects.\n\nAn inspiring documentary about the 1971 Women’s Football Cup, and sexism in the football sphere. Directed by Rachel Ramsay and James Erksine\n\nA mother and her teenage daughter are confronted with Death in the form of a talking bird in this fantasy drama.\n\nIn 2016 Godzilla returned to the screen after an absence of over a decade in this dark entry in the franchise, which went on to win the Japan Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nThis darkly hilarious farce is expertly crafted with the distinct visual aesthetic we’ve come to know and love from Wes Anderson, featuring a positively sparkling Ralph Fiennes on spectacular form."
