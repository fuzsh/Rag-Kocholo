McGowan\n\nSynopsis: The Gang and their families plan a fun Sunday picnic but from the outset everything seems to go wrong.\n\nKitty Cameo: At the beginning of the short film the different families are seen gathering their newspapers and bottles of milk from their front porches. At the home of the McTeeter’s, a black and white tuxedo cat is licking the top of the milk bottle on the porch.\n\nThe children, Mickey (Mickey Daniels) and his little sister (Leona Levin) run out the front door, startling the cat away.\n\nFinal Mewsings: Cats just want their Sundays to be calm, too.\n\nRelevant Links:"
