        "text": "full name: Robert Francis McGowan\n\nnickname: \"Uncle Bob\"\n\nborn July 11, 1882, in Denver, CO\n\ndied Jan. 27, 1955, in Santa Monica, CA, of cancer\n\nMcGowan was primarily raised by his older brother after their father died at the hands of juvenile delinquents. He knew fellow Roach director Fred Newmeyer during his early days in Denver. He became a fire fighter and suffered a serious injury which eventually caused gangrene to set into his foot. The older brother refused to allow the doctors to amputate the leg and the injury was treated with morphine instead. McGowan was able to keep his leg, but walked with a limp for the rest of his life. His first brush with the film world was when he bought partial interest in a nickelodeon.\n\n1913\n\nAfter receiving his pension, McGowan moved to California and got into the movie business by selling story and gag ideas to Essanay (presumably at their studio in Niles).\n\nMcGowan was later promoted to chief of staff to the studio carpenter.\n\nMcGowan then moved to Hollywood and became an assistant property man at Universal, where he met future Roach colleague Charles Oelze.\n\nEventually, McGowan sold stories to Universal.\n\n1915\n\nAround this time, McGowan had started to write stories for Al Christie at the Nestor studio, where he also occasionally directed. His filmography for the next few years is incomplete.\n\nIn Search Of A Wife (story)\n\nNov. 23, 1915 - Gold Seal/Universal - 2 reels\n\n©Nov. 15, 1915.\n\n1916\n\nMingling Spirits (story)\n\nJan. 17, 1916 - Nestor/Universal - 1 reel - Betty Compson series\n\n©Jan. 10, 1916.\n\nAfter The Play (story)\n\nFeb. 25, 1916 - Victor/Universal - 1 reel\n\n©Feb. 18, 1916.\n\nTheir Only Son (director/scenario)\n\nMar. 6, 1916 - Nestor/Universal - 1 reel\n\n©Feb. 28, 1916.\n\nHer Celluloid Hero (story)\n\nMay 22, 1916 - Nestor/Universal - 1 reel - Betty Compson series\n\n©May 15, 1916.\n\nAlmost A Widow (story)\n\nJune 19, 1916 - Nestor/Universal - 1 reel - Betty Compson series\n\nAlso listed for 1915. ©June 8, 1916.\n\nHow Do You Feel?

According to Robbin Coons' Jan. 31, 1934, column, he resigned to finish work on a children's book, but it's otherwise pretty evident that he was exhausted from his many years of working with children. He did occasionally return to the studio for non-Our Gang activities.\n\nOn Oct. 15th, the Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine published an article written by McGowan called A Hollywood Gang The Police Can't Stop, in which he talked about his years working as the Our Gang director.\n\n120.
