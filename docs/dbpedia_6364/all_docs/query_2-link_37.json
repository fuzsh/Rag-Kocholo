        "text": "The 2024 Super Bowl is bringing some exciting movie trailers to preview the year’s blockbuster slate. It is estimated that more than 100 million people will tune into Super Bowl LVIII, which pits the Kansas City Chiefs against the San Francisco 49ers in a rematch for the ages. The two NFL football teams previously met at Super Bowl LIV in 2020, wherein the Chiefs bested the 49ers 31 to 20. The Super Bowl is the most-watched American television broadcast of the year, and the numbers have only been on the rise with last year’s event surpassing over 115 million viewers. As such, Hollywood studios have to cough up a hefty price for live Super Bowl commercials, with a single 30-second TV spot now costing about 7 million.\n\nSo, which of the major studios coughed up the dough for 2024 Super Bowl trailers? Paramount had a huge presence, given that the big game aired on sister company CBS. In addition to heavily promoting their Paramount+ streaming service, including an already-released trailer of the Knuckles spin-off series, the studio showcased new looks at the prequel A Quiet Place: Day One, which comes from Pig filmmaker Michael Sarnoski, and writer-director John Krasinski’s new live-action-animated hybrid family comedy IF, starring Ryan Reynolds and Steve Carell. Paramount’s upcoming reggae biopic Bob Marley: One Love also had a presence with a big game spot.\n\nPeople watching Super Bowl 2024 saw actor Ryan Reynolds more than once, as the highly-anticipated first trailer for Deadpool 3 – now officially titled Deadpool & Wolverine – has finally arrived. Featuring the return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, the word on the street is that the sequel will shake up the Marvel Universe (or Multiverse) as fans know it. On the note of Disney, new looks at Pixar’s Inside Out 2 and 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes were revealed. Universal is the third major studio that brought the heat this year, debuting new trailers for director David Leitch’s The Fall Guy, starring Ryan Gosling, Emily Blunt, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and director Lee Isaac Chung’s legacy sequel Twisters, starring Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell, and Anthony Ramos. Dev Patel’s Monkey Man, produced by Jordan Peele, made a surprise appearance with a new teaser as well.\n\nOf course, Universal wouldn’t miss the 2024 Super Bowl without previewing Illumination‘s Despicable Me 4 and DreamWorks Animation’s Kung Fu Panda 4, which are surely going to be some of the biggest theater draws for families this year. The first trailer for Wicked Part 1 also premiered during the Super Bowl 2024. The cinematic adaptation of the hit Broadway musical comes from director Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians) and is on track to be Universal’s largest tentpole release during the 2024 holiday season, so it only made sense for moviegoers to get a first trailer tease during the 2024 Super Bowl.\n\nWarner Bros., Sony, Netflix, and Amazon are skipped out on Super Bowl ads this year, despite blockbusters like Dune: Part Two, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire being just around the corner. Some of these studios usually sit out on releasing Super Bowl movie trailers to save money. Keep scrolling to see all the biggest movie trailers and big game spots released for the 2024 Super Bowl. We’ll keep updating this list LIVE with any surprises or last-minute changes as the Kansas City Chiefs battle the San Francisco 49ers throughout Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nSuper Bowl 2024 Movie Trailers\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nRelease Date: July 26, 2024\n\nDirected by Shawn Levy\n\nWritten by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Zeb Wells, Ryan Reynolds, & Shawn Levy\n\nBased on Deadpool by Fabian Nicieza & Rob Liefeld\n\nProduced by Kevin Feige, Ryan Reynolds, Shawn Levy, & Simon Kinberg\n\nStarring Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Morena Baccarin, Brianna Hildebrand, Jennifer Garner, Leslie Uggams, Karan Soni, Stefan Kapičić, Shioli Kutsuna, Rob Delaney, Matthew Macfadyen, & Emma Corrin.\n\nDistributed by Walt Disney Studios\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One\n\nRelease Date: June 28, 2024\n\nDirected by Michael Sarnoski\n\nScreenplay by Michael Sarnoski\n\nStory by John Krasinski & Michael Sarnoski\n\nBased on characters by Bryan Woods & Scott Beck\n\nProduced by Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, & John Krasinski\n\nMain Cast: Lupita Nyong’o, Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, & Djimon Hounsou\n\nDistributor: Paramount Pictures\n\nWicked Part 1\n\nRelease Date: November 27, 2024\n\nDirected by Jon M.
