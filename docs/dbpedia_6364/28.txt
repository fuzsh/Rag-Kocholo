full name: Robert Francis McGowan

nickname: "Uncle Bob"

born July 11, 1882, in Denver, CO

died Jan. 27, 1955, in Santa Monica, CA, of cancer

McGowan was primarily raised by his older brother after their father died at the hands of juvenile delinquents. He knew fellow Roach director Fred Newmeyer during his early days in Denver. He became a fire fighter and suffered a serious injury which eventually caused gangrene to set into his foot. The older brother refused to allow the doctors to amputate the leg and the injury was treated with morphine instead. McGowan was able to keep his leg, but walked with a limp for the rest of his life. His first brush with the film world was when he bought partial interest in a nickelodeon.

1913

After receiving his pension, McGowan moved to California and got into the movie business by selling story and gag ideas to Essanay (presumably at their studio in Niles).

McGowan was later promoted to chief of staff to the studio carpenter.

McGowan then moved to Hollywood and became an assistant property man at Universal, where he met future Roach colleague Charles Oelze.

Eventually, McGowan sold stories to Universal.

1915

Around this time, McGowan had started to write stories for Al Christie at the Nestor studio, where he also occasionally directed. His filmography for the next few years is incomplete.

1920

The 1920 Motion Picture Studio Directory and Trade Annual states that McGowan had written and produced nearly 100 comedies by this time. In fact, when it comes to the De Haven series, it states that he was 'assisting writing and producing.' By this time, Charles Parrott (later Chase) was also working on the De Haven series, as a director.

Presumably, McGowan had some type of participation on the two McNamara-directed Our Gang shorts "The Cobbler" and "Boys To Board."

With the departure of Tom McNamara around June, McGowan briefly had the Our Gang series to himself.

In August, McGowan began to share his directorial duties with his same-named nephew, Robert A. McGowan, who would soon acquire the pseudonym Anthony Mack.

1933

In mid-April of this year, McGowan took a trip to Europe with Roach, where he did a rare interview.

On April 14th, Movienews of Chicago, IL, reported that McGowan had written a book called The Gangster's Baby.

McGowan was supposed to finally resign from the Our Gang series after "Mush And Milk" (as per a verbal agreement with Roach one year earlier), but remained for two more films before finally calling it quits. According to Robbin Coons' Jan. 31, 1934, column, he resigned to finish work on a children's book, but it's otherwise pretty evident that he was exhausted from his many years of working with children. He did occasionally return to the studio for non-Our Gang activities.

On Oct. 15th, the Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine published an article written by McGowan called A Hollywood Gang The Police Can't Stop, in which he talked about his years working as the Our Gang director.
