Renée Adorée (1898-1933) was a French actress who performed in silent Hollywood films in the 1920’s. Her biggest role in a Metro-Goldwyn Mayar film was as Melisande in The Big Parade in 1925, which is hailed by critics as one of the best films of the silent film age. In 1928 she starred in The Mating Call, for which she stirred up controversy by having a nude swimming scene. While most of the 45 films she had starred in were silent films, she did a handful of talking films before she passed away in 1933.
