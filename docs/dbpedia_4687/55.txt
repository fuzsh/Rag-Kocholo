French actress Renée Adorée (1898-1933) appeared in Hollywood in several silent films during the 1920s. She was the daughter of circus artists. In her teens, she began acting in minor stage productions and toured Europe with her troupe. She was performing in Russia when World War I broke out and fled to London. From London she went to New York City, where she continued to work in the theatre. In 1920 the motion picture business discovered her. She became famous as Melisande in the melodramatic romance and war epic The Big Parade (1925) opposite John Gilbert. It became one of MGM's all-time biggest hits and is one of the classics of the silent film era. In The Mating Call (1928), produced by Howard Hughes, Adorée had a brief nude swimming scene that caused quite some commotion at the time. With the advent of sound in film, Adorée's voice met the film industry's new needs. She starred in talkies opposite Lon Chaney, John Gilbert, and Ramón Novarro. But in 1930 she was diagnosed with tuberculosis and died in 1933, just a few days after her 35th birthday.
