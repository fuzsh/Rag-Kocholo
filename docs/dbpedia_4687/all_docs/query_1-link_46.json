        "text": "As Rachel Carson’s book, “Silent Spring,” first noted, the decrease in sonic activity of an ecosystem may point to larger health issues at play. For example, due to human noise pollution, birds and insects often have to adjust the sound frequency of their calls just to be heard by one another. If soundscape ecology uses sound to monitor the health of ecosystems, what if sonic prescriptions could heal them? In this fictional history, we glimpse rival factions debating this question, including The Resounders, whose Sonic Apothecary emits elixirs for the given ills of the natural urban environment.\n\nCredits: Audio mastered by Billie Seeland. Special thanks to Jmar Reid, our talented ‘Shushers’ voice actor.\n\nCredit to Zapsplat.com for some ambient sound effects as well as Mark Avery (CC BY-SA 4.0) for the Great Tit birdsong audio.\n\nCreated by: The Sousrealists, a creative research collective: MariaEugenia Dominguez, Hannah Rose Fox, Anjali Nair, Miriam Young"
