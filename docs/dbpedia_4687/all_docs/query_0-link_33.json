Renée Adorée as Salome in The Show (Tod Browning, 1927). \n\t\n\tActress <b>Renée Adorée</b> (1898-1933) was born in Germany from British and Belgian parents, but was promoted as being French from the late 1910s onward. She was very popular in silent Hollywood of the 1920s. \n\t\n\tBorn Emilia Louisa Victoria Reeves, Adorée was the daughter of circus artists, who with her family toured Europe, but fled to London when the First World War broke out. In 1918 she performed with Guy Magley in a dance act in Australia, starting to use the name of Renée Adorée and gradually promoting herself as French.  She also played in her first film in Australia, £500 Reward (Claude Flemming, 1918). From 1919 she performed on Broadway and acted in her first American film, The Strongest (Raoul Walsh, 1920). Adorée became a regular film partner of John Gilbert in the early twenties. Opposite Gilbert, she became famous as Melisande in the melodramatic romance and war epic <i>The Big Parade</i> (King Vidor, 1925). It became one of MGM's all-time biggest hits and is one of the classics of the silent film era. Afterward, she continued to act opposite Gilbert (La Boheme, The Cossacks), but also opposite Lon Chaney (The Blackbird, Mr. Wu) and Ramon Novarro (A certain Young Man, Forbidden Hours, The Pagan). In <i>The Mating Call</i> (1928), produced by Howard Hughes, Adorée had a brief nude swimming scene that caused quite some commotion at the time. With the advent of sound in film, Adorée's career broke off in 1930 as she  was diagnosed with tuberculosis and had to undergo treatments in sanatorium. She died in 1933, just a few days after her 35th birthday.",
