        "text": "Rob: (VO) What did Laura mean last night when she said, \"I haven't slept with him yet\"? Yet! What does \"yet\" mean anyway? It means you're gonna do it, doesn't it? Or does it? (At the record store)\n\nRob: Just come on. What would it mean to you, that sentence: \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet\"?\n\nBarry: Well, to me it would mean that you're a liar. You've seen it twice. Once with Laura -- oops -- and once with me and Dick 'member? We had that conversation about that guy making Beretta shotgun ammo off-screen in the 14th century.\n\nRob: Right. But let's just say that I hadn't seen it. And I said, \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet.\" What would you think?\n\nBarry: I'd think that you're a cinematic idiot and I'd feel sorry for you.\n\nRob: All right. But from that one sentence, would you think that I was going to see it?\n\nBarry: I'm sorry, Rob. I'm struggling here. You're asking me what would I think if you told me you hadn't seen a film that you have already seen. What am I supposed to say?\n\nRob: Just listen to me. If I said to you --\n\nBarry: \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet\", yes!\n\nRob: Would you get the impression that I really wanted to see it?\n\nBarry: Oh, uh...well, you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone.\n\nRob: Right. I'm not going to see that movie. (After a pause, Barry looks up again.)\n\nBarry: But the word \"yet.\"......Yeah, you know what? I get the impression that you wanted to see it...otherwise you'd have said you didn't want to go.\n\nRob: But in your opinion, would I definitely go?\n\nBarry: How the f..k am I supposed to know? Probably.\n\nRob: Why?\n\nBarry: Because it's a brilliant film! It's so funny and violent and the soundtrack kicks f..king ass. I never thought I'd say this, but can I go to work now?"
