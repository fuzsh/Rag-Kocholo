        "text": "PREFACE\n\nIn his scholarly work, A WODEHOUSE HANDBOOK [Popgood & Groolley, London, 2006], Norman Murphy quotes Alan Judd in a 1997 review from the Daily Telegraph: “Every generation . . . is doomed to be a sort of secret society, with special thoughts and interests which, like passwords, are well known to its contemporaries but cannot be communicated to its descendants.” Murphy continues: “Very many of Wodehouse’s references and quotations were topical, and the first readers of his books appreciated them more than we do today. He worked for over seventy years and his stories reflect the background, social standards, and events of his time.” Murphy’s point about first readers of the books appreciating the topical references more so than a reader of today is well taken. Wodehouse referred to real people and events of his day and used vernacular terms that were well-known when he wrote them, but which have today faded from the language due to disuse and have since been relegated to the dustbin of obscurity. But his remarkable gifts of prose and timeless context allow readers of any age and time to know why he’s said something and to understand what he meant by it, even though we may not grasp the specific reference he is using. We gloss over the pages, relishing in the story, the characters, the language and the humor, and we don’t have to look up what all these obscure references may mean because his meanings and intent usually come through very clearly.\n\nStill, there is a need to annotate Wodehouse’s work for the benefit of those who are curious today, and even more so for those who will come in the future. Many words and phrases that Wodehouse used that we understand today may well be forgotten by the time our great-grandchildren pick up a copy of The Mating Season — which, my guess is, will still be in print somewhere. His use of “Beatle, Beatle and Beatle of Liverpool” from 1966 is entirely clear to us today — but will it be to the 2066 reader — any more than the songs and singers of Wodehouse’s own day he wrote about?\n\nFor these reasons, I decided to depart from the usual practice of Wodehouse annotators and to aim for a comprehensive inclusion of all of the vernacular terms and other Wodehouse references in the book, rather than limit it to quotations and antiquated references which is the usual custom. Thus, you will find words and phrases that are well-known to you — but may not be so well-known to generations to come. These are the reasons why this annotation of The Mating Season is so lengthy. In essence, I’m writing it for not only a reader of today, but also a reader of many years hence.\n\nFor the man who always gave Bertie the mot juste, it is only fitting that Wodehouse’s language is exact, to the slightest nuance. When he used a word, an adage, a quotation, a reference, an allusion, a bit of vernacular, whether he fractured a figure of speech or mangled a metaphor, he himself always found the mot juste. He wrote, rewrote, edited and polished; and as he wished to be remembered — he did take care. By writing this annotation, I hope that others can more fully appreciate the depth of his talents.\n\n—John Dawson, April 2007\n\nA few notes:\n\n1. I’ve used the Herbert Jenkins first edition of The Mating Season, published September 9, 1949.\n\n2. In addition to the well known and oft-used quotations from Shakespeare, Tennyson, scripture, etc., which are well-documented elsewhere, I’ve also included, where I feel it appropriate, other quotations from both expected and unexpected sources. Some of these are unquestionably the exact source; others may or may not be, but in any event serve to illustrate and explain their context in Wodehouse’s world. I don’t claim that each citation I’ve given is the one Wodehouse had in mind — only that they could have been something he read at one time and used.\n\n3. Some of the quotes and songs have been abridged or Anglicized for brevity and clarity; the aim has been to make the precise meaning clear.\n\n4. There are too many sources to credit each of them. But foremost, I’ve referred to Norman Murphy’s books for a starting point and inspiration. When I’ve quoted from them, I’ve appended a [NTPM] at the end. Other PGW scholars are credited when quoted. Many of the simple definitions come from the Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary, Second ed., 2001 or the OED. Dates in square brackets indicate the earliest known uses of these terms. Special thanks to Terry Mordue, [TM] that Gentleman of Leisure, who has helped extricate me from some fiendish, glutinous mysteries. I also appreciate the inmates at the Yahoo! Blandings discussion group, who will be the first to tell you that they are a completely lovable, if potty, group of fanatics. I’ve had more than a few questions answered for me in their forum.\n\n5.

I did my best, and I’m under no illusions that this is in any way a final, complete or authoritative reference. I’m certain that sharp-eyed Wodehousians will spot many things they wish to comment on, clarify, correct and set the record straight on. I welcome corrections, clarifications, stinkers, advice, or whatever you want to say, and I will keep my upper lip stiff throughout.\n\nChapter 1\n\n(the heart as actually) leaden\n\nDull, spiritless or gloomy, as in mood or thought; “My heart is leaden and hopeless...” Thomas Wolfe (1900–1938)\n\ndo my bit of time\n\ncolloquially, to serve a prison sentence [NM]\n\nDeverill Hall\n\nWhen Wodehouse entered Dulwich in 1894, his parents were in Hong Kong and his ‘home address’ was given as Cheney Court, Box, Wiltshire; Cheney Court is still there, a (Jacobean) picturesque seventeenth-century manor house...in Wodehouse’s boyhood, it was the home of his maternal grandmother and her four unmarried daughters...the memory of the five ladies stayed with Wodehouse a long time, which is why, in The Mating Season, Bertie Wooster’s heart sinks when he learns he is to stay at Deverill Hall, a house infested by no less than five aunts. And it needs little imagination to work out that the five ladies were given the name Deverill because of the five small hamlets in the valley below Cheney Court: Brixton Deverill, Monkton Deverill, Kingston Deverill, Longbridge Deverill and Hill Deverill [NTPM]. Wiltshire is a county in southern England.\n\nchirpiness\n\ncheerfulness, liveliness, gaiety [1830–40]\n\ndecanted\n\npoured, as in wine [1625–35]\n\nAunt Agatha\n\nBertie’s Aunt Agatha, the “human snapping turtle who has savaged Bertie incessantly from childhood up, kills rats with her teeth, devours her young, eats broken bottles, and turns into a werewolf at the time of the full moon. Tall and thin, about 5′9″ topped off with a beaky nose, an eagle eye, and a lot of gray hair, looks rather like a vulture in the Gobi desert.” [Daniel Garrison, Who’s Who in Wodehouse (1989)]. In January 1955, PGW wrote: “Aunt Agatha is definitely my Aunt Mary [Mary Deane (1845–1940)] who was the scourge of my childhood.” [NTPM]\n\none of our most prominent fiends in human shape\n\n“Oh! that fiend in human shape, next to her, knew human—female—nature well. He had played upon her feelings as a skilful musician plays upon an instrument.” [The Scarlet Pimpernel (1903) by Baroness Emmuska Orczy (1865–1947)]\n\nThe phrase can be traced as far back as 1839, in a discussion of Goethe’s Faust, describing Mephistopheles in those words. [NM]\n\njuicier\n\nMore profitable, appealing, interesting, satisfying, or substantive. [1925–30]\n\ntake a pop\n\nTo attempt something; to take a shot at (pop—Br. Slang, to shoot a firearm)\n\nto focus the silver lining\n\nSee look for the silver lining in the notes to Bill the Conqueror.\n\nPeople’s Choice\n\nThe popular choice, by acclamation; the expression of the electorate; “The hind (a female deer) briefly disdained to enlarge on the power of Kings, and their superior charge, as heavens trustees; the Peoples choice Though sure the panther did not much rejoice to hear those echoes given of her once loyal voice” John Dryden (1631–1700) The Hind and The Panther (An allegory wherein the hind is the Catholic church, the panther the Anglican church)\n\nAlso\n\nHerbert Sebastian Agar (1897–1980), American journalist, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1934 for his book The People’s Choice, a critical look at the American presidency.\n\nhalf a jiffy\n\nSee Leave It to Psmith.\n\nhaven’t the foggiest\n\nBlurred or obscured as if by fog; not clear, vague, e.g. “I haven’t the foggiest notion.” [1520–30] A knut locution.\n\npan(s) out\n\nTo turn out, especially successfully.\n\nwhiz(z)\n\na swift movement [1540–1550]\n\noff the mark\n\nto begin from the starting line, as in a race\n\npep\n\nenergy, vigor, animation\n\nginger\n\npiquancy, animation, spirit\n\nmettlesome\n\nspirited, courageous [1655–65]\n\ncharger\n\na horse of a kind suitable to be ridden in battle [1475–85]\n\ninto its routine\n\ngoing into action, i.e. battle\n\nfootnote(s)\n\nexplanatory or documenting note or comment at the bottom of a page referring to a specific part of the text on the page [1835–45]\n\nOld Vic(s)\n\nThe Old Vic, founded 1818, is one of the oldest theatres in London, famous throughout the English speaking world; it has long specialized in Shakespeare’s works.\n\nHants\n\nClassical abbreviation for Hampshire, used in postal addresses. Derives from Old English Hantescire as used in the Domesday Book. [NM]\n\nvillage concert\n\nA rural entertainment consisting of performances of songs and music, etc., put on by local inhabitants, often in aid of the local church. Traditional in England from the 1800s and before.\n\ntouch...with a ten-foot pole\n\nIn the sense of not wanting to get involved or having strong distaste for something, [Late 19th century] e.g. “It’s dangerous or disagreeable, and I intend to avoid it.” This expression may have been suggested by the 10-foot poles that river boatmen used to pole their boats along in shallow water.\n\nyoung Thos\n\nSee Thank You, Jeeves.\n\nthe shape of things to come\n\nWhat will happen; H. G. Wells’ 1933 book The Shape of Things to Come prophesied war in the air and atom bombs.

[NM]\n\nDen of the Secret Nine\n\nA fictional hideout of mysterious criminals; reflecting the popular books (Faceless Fiends, et al.) written by Edgar Wallace (1875–1932) and the mystery thriller genre as a whole [NTPM]. PGW repeatedly employs the upper case for comedic emphasis, as though in a book title or a name of a statue, etc.\n\nAnthony Scerbo thinks it likely that Wodehouse was alluding to the Nine Unknown Men in Talbot Mundy’s 1923 novel The Nine Unknown.\n\n(to) keep the upper lip stiff\n\nTo face misfortune bravely and resolutely; to suppress the display of any emotion. A trembling of the upper lip is a sign of fear or emotion which can be prevented by a deliberate attempt to stiffen it, to make it rigid. [early 1800s]\n\nHaddock’s Headache Hokies\n\nPGW invented many patent remedies through the years. The name seems influenced by hokey: [1815–25] obviously contrived, and hokum: out-and-out nonsense, bunkum. Other PGW nostrums include Old Doctor Gordon’s Bile Magnesia, Park’s Pepsinine, Perkin’s Digestine, Pringle’s Pink Pills, Prosser’s Pep Pills, Reduc-O, Slimmo, Scalpo, etc.\n\n(Jeeves’s) pick-me-ups\n\nThroughout the Wooster/Jeeves novels and stories, beginning with the 1916 story “Jeeves Takes Charge,” Jeeves’s hangover remedy (the complete recipe is never given) contains Worcester sauce, red pepper, and a raw egg (other ingredients, including brandy, are suggested). Drinking the potion has marked effects, such as “if somebody had touched off a bomb inside the old bean...”\n\nmésalliance\n\nFr., misalliance, an improper or incompatible association, esp. in marriage [1730–40]\n\na very old county family...impoverished\n\nWorld War I spelled the end for the ways of many of England’s oldest country houses and castles. Death, expenses and hard times fell upon the heirs; PGW addresses this topic in at least ten other novels, with the heir or owner trying to sell a large house or struggling to maintain upkeep on it. [NTPM]\n\nThere’s gold in them thar Hokies...\n\n“There’s gold in them thar hills,” from the California and Alaska Gold Rush days of the 1840s and 1890s. [NTPM]\n\nchew(ing) the fat\n\nTo converse at length in a relaxed manner; chat. The expression has its origins from the days of 19th century sailing ships. Because of the problem inherent in preserving food for a long journey, food was most often salted so that it would not spoil. One special food liked by sailors then was salted beef or pork. With the scarcity of food aboard ship, every scrap was eaten and relished, even the skin. The skin was given to the crew, and they would chew on the tough skin, especially the fatty portions. Presumably, conversation took place as they ate.\n\na bit of goose\n\nsomething occurring, perhaps unexpectedly, that enriches, energizes, strengthens, or the like; a surprise bonus\n\ngravel soil\n\nSee Summer Lightning.\n\nrelict\n\nWidow [1525–35] from Lat. reliquare, to relinquish\n\nit is not aunts that matter but the courage which one brings to them\n\n“It isn’t life that matters, it’s the courage you bring to it.” Hugh Walpole (1884–1941)\n\nI wonder, by the way, if you recall this Augustus\n\nSee above. The US first edition has an extraneous (and erroneous) opening double quotation mark at the start of this paragraph.\n\nshrink(s) (from the prospect)\n\nto be fearful of; to shy away from\n\ngoofy to the gills\n\nSee Carry On, Jeeves.\n\nThe Larches, Wimbledon Common\n\nFrom its setting adjacent to a large open space in southwest London, we can deduce that this is a desirable residence and that Madeline’s friend Hilda Gudgeon is wealthy. Other prosperous inhabitants of the neighborhood include Ukridge’s Aunt Julia in several stories; Sinclair Hammond (in Bill the Conqueror); Bobbie Wickham’s Aunt Rhoda, Sampson Broadhurst and Dudley Finch (in “Dudley Is Back to Normal”); Lord Tilbury (in Frozen Assets/Biffen’s Millions); Mrs. Wilberforce or Willoughby Gudgeon (in “Joy Bells for Barmy” and “The Right Approach”); Hilda Gudgeon (in The Mating Season); and Mr. & Mrs. Bingo Little in the later stories, after Bingo inherits from an uncle. [NM]\n\ntopknot\n\nhair fashioned into a ball or knob on the top of the head [1680–90]\n\nwoman whom God forgot\n\nPossibly from a 1920 film The Wife Whom God Forgot, written by Lew Wallace (1827–1905), released in England as Tangled Hearts (the title of a PGW story in Nothing Serious, PGW’s next book following The Mating Season). Wallace, a lawyer, soldier, diplomat, and author (Ben Hur, 1880), had dealings with several of PGW’s theater acquaintances, Abe Erlanger and the Shubert brothers among them. It’s said that a meeting with the agnostic Robert Ingersoll (see Chapter Seven) inspired Wallace to write Ben-Hur. There is also a Robert W. Service (1874–1958) poem entitled “The Land God Forgot.” PGW quoted Service often (see Chapters Three and Twenty-One).\n\ncentre-aisling\n\nbecoming wed, i.e., walking down the aisle toward the altar\n\npronounced sentence\n\nBertie likens the clergyman’s proclamation of marriage to a judge’s announcement of a term of imprisonment. [NM]\n\nlaughing Love God\n\nApparently a PGW creation (?), Wodehouse used this locution in several other books, most notably The Girl on the Boat/Three Men and a Maid (1922), in which he pictures a silent movie caption reading:\n\nand so, calm and golden, the days went by,\n\neach fraught with hope and youth and sweetness,\n\nlinking two young hearts in silken fetters\n\nforged by the laughing love-god\n\n[Clearly a reference to Cupid/Eros, often depicted as laughing. One earlier use of the phrase can now be found in Google Books: —NM]\n\nNelly’s smiling! Nelly’s smiling!\n\nThe laughing love-god in her eye,—\n\nAll my former will beguiling,\n\nNever was such dupe as I!\n\n“Nelly’s Smiling” in Fire-Side Melodies (1859) by Sylvan (Samuel Hobbs).\n\nsweating away at the old stand\n\n“Still doing business at the old stand” was a popular phrase at bookmaker’s stands at race courses to advertise reliability and stability. [NTPM]\n\nwith knobs on\n\nan expression of emphasis, similar to “with bells on” or “in spades.” The OED defines it as a jocular slang phrase meaning “that and more,” indicating ironic or emphatic agreement, or in retort to an insult. [TM] The phrase probably originated from highly decorated houses or pieces of furniture in the Victorian era (c.1840–c.1900) that emphasized the owner’s wealth. If one homeowner built a house with some degree or ornamentation, his neighbor, not to be outdone, would add more elaborate decoration to his own, including, for example, knobs on the top of fence posts. [NTPM]\n\nsomeone waits without\n\n“Well! Well—Anselmo waits without for me; I do remember he waits without!”\n\nEva, or the Error (1840) by Lady Emmaline Stuart-Wortley\n\nKing Lear\n\nShakespeare’s tragedy [1603–1606] of the ruler of Britain\n\nMr. Pirbright … old Catsmeat\n\nBertie’s old school friend, now a light-comedy actor and a member of the Drones Club, is first recalled in Thank You, Jeeves and Right Ho, Jeeves; in these and other previous accounts his surname is given as Potter-Pirbright. The simpler form of the surname is used for all his family members in the present book. [NM]\n\nhis sister … Corky\n\nCorky appears only in the present book. [NM]\n\nChapter 2\n\nfizzy\n\nbubbly, effervescent, lively [1850–55]\n\nbird\n\nBr. slang; a person, usually one who is odd or has some peculiarity\n\noomph\n\nenergy, vitality, enthusiasm or sex appeal [1935–40]\n\nespièglerie\n\nFr., mischief, frolicsomeness.\n\nthree squares\n\nA square meal is a nourishing or filling meal [1830–40]\n\nsock and buskin\n\nThe distinguishing mark of actors in ancient Rome. The buskin was a high-heeled, platform shoe which gave the actor presence and was worn with long socks. [NTPM]\n\nknockabout Pat and Mike cross-talk act(s)\n\nwere enormously popular in the USA and UK from about 1870 to the 1930s. They were a staple of the vaudeville/Music Hall scene and audiences reveled in the appalling puns and jokes and the slapstick comedy. They relied heavily on mocking national characteristics and jokes about Cockneys, Scots, and Irishmen in the UK, and of Irish, Dutch, Germans, and Jews in the US. [NTPM/NM]\n\nGroucho Marx\n\n(1890–1977) and the Marx Brothers, vaudeville and film troupe, known for their anarchic comedy; Groucho was particularly known for smart-aleck or wise comments and retorts.\n\nHis brow was sicklied o’er\n\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\n\nIs sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought...\n\nShakespeare’s Hamlet, III, i: the “to be or not to be” soliloquy\n\nRussian drama\n\nPGW frequently parodies Russian literature as overly gloomy:\n\nVladimir specialized in grey studies of hopeless misery, where nothing happened till page three hundred and eighty, when the moujik decided to commit suicide.\n\n“The Unexpected Clicking of Cuthbert” (1921)\n\negg\n\nCommon Br. 19th century term for a person, usually a man; Good egg, bad egg, etc. [NTPM]\n\nBook of Revelation(s)\n\nThe last book of the New Testament; also called the Apocalypse; features plagues, famine, a violent earthquake; the sun turns black, the moon turns red, stars fall from the sky, the sky disappears, corpses lie in the street, and there are dragons, beasts, and fiery pools.\n\nkeen\n\neager, interested, enthusiastic [1930–35]\n\nFarmer Giles\n\nThe only reference I can find is “Farmer Giles of Ham,” (1949) by J.R.R. Tolkien (1892–1973); a medieval fantasy in short story form set in Great Britain.\n\n[PGW and Tolkien were both drawing on nineteenth-century children’s fiction such as this tale of kindness to animals; by the turn of the century political essayists were using the name as a stand-in for rural citizens. —NM]\n\ndish\n\navocation, area of interest, hobby\n\nyokel(s)\n\na rustic, country bumpkin [1805–1815]\n\nYeoman’s Wedding Song\n\nA song popular in England in late 19th and early 20th century, written by Josef Poniatowski (1816–1873) and Maria X. Hayes in 1871. [The sheet music can be found online at this link. —NM]\n\n“Yeoman” has several definitions: a) a farmer who cultivates his own land; b) one of a class of lesser freeholders, below the gentry, who cultivated their own land, early admitted in England to political rights; c) a servant, attendant, or subordinate official in a royal or other great household; d) a subordinate of a sheriff or other official in a craft or trade. From 1919’s A Damsel in Distress up to Bachelors Anonymous in 1973, PGW’s characters often mention the song when a wedding is in the air:\n\nDing dong, ding dong, ding dong,\n\nI love the song,\n\nFor it is my wedding morning,\n\nAnd the bride so gay in fine array,\n\nFor the day will be now adorning.\n\nTho’ I’ve little wealth but sov’reign health,\n\nAnd am only a yeoman free,\n\nWhen heart joins hand, there’s none in the land\n\nCan be richer in joys than we.\n\nDing dong, ding dong, we’ll gallop along,\n\nAll fears and doubting scorning.\n\nThrough the valley we’ll haste, for we’ve no time to waste,\n\nAs this is my wedding morning.\n\nbrass hat(s)\n\nA high-ranking military officer (referring to the gold braid on officers’ caps) [1890–95]\n\nshot wasn’t on the board\n\n“Shot on the board” refers to the betting odds in horse-racing, as, for example: “—— had not raced in nearly a year. He was the longest shot on the board at odds of 27–1.” PGW uses the phrase to mean that something is not going to happen.\n\ntote board\n\nAn mechanical or electronic board, usually in the infield of a track, which posts the odds, amount of money bet, results of a race and the wagering pay-offs.\n\nnymphery\n\nHere’s the only reasonable reference I can find:\n\nIt’s the Chateau de la Caze, usually called the Castle of the Nymphs, for instead of one, eight beautiful nymphs lived in it. But their beauty was their undoing. I don’t quite know why they were called ‘nymphs,’ for nymphs had gone out of fashion when they reigned here as Queens of Beauty, in the sixteenth century. But perhaps in those days to call a girl a ‘nymph’ was to pay her a compliment. It wouldn’t be now, when chaps criticize the ‘nymphery’ if they go to a dance! Anyhow, these eight sisters were renowned for their loveliness, and all the unmarried gentlemen of France—according to the story—as well as foreign knights, came to pay court to them. The unfortunate thing was, when the cavaliers saw the eight girls together, they were all so frightfully pretty. It wasn’t possible to choose between them, so the poor gentlemen fought over their rival charms, and were either killed or went away unable to make up their minds. The sad end was, if you’ll believe me, that all the eight maidens died unmarried, martyrs to their own incomparable charms.\n\nFrom The Motor Maid (1910), by Alice Muriel Williamson (1869–1933).\n\n[Wodehouse used the term only one other time, for the quality of being nymph-like, in Ice in the Bedroom (1961). —NM]\n\nlittle ball of worsted\n\nLiterally, woollen yarn wound in a ball, as for knitting; figuratively, a cute object of adoration. One wonders if the use of yarn balls as playthings for cats influenced this figurative sense.

[Parallel to “Broadway” in American theatrical parlance —NM].\n\npunch\n\nTruncation of “punch line,” the climatic phrase or sentence in a joke or story that produces the desired effect [1920–25]\n\nkick(ed)\n\nto resist, object, or complain\n\nsemi-detached villa\n\nA residence which shares one wall with an adjoining residence; the equivalent American term would be half of a duplex house. The UK text continues “called Balmoral” (named after the UK royal family’s Scottish castle); in the US book the nurse’s villa is unnamed.

PGW’s essay Thoughts on the Income Tax was published in London’s Daily Mail in 1929 and reprinted in Louder and Funnier (1932).\n\nthe bird\n\nTo receive a poor reception from an audience, to be hissed at (as by a goose); dates to the 1500s [NTPM]\n\nno dice\n\nA refusal to accept a proposition; US, early 20th century. Gambling with dice was illegal in many states and so gamblers went to some pains to hide the dice when challenged by the police. Courts would sometimes throw out cases if the dice weren’t offered in evidence. There are several court records where gamblers were alleged to have swallowed dice to avoid arrest.

He Ain’t Done Right by our Nell (1919) was an early silent animated film featuring the comic strip characters Mutt and Jeff; it was produced by Pathé Exchange, which also produced the 1920 film The Prince and Betty, from the 1912 PGW book of the same name.

Experts suspect the phrase might have something to do with the military, and that “to get cold feet” originally referred to soldiers who exempted themselves from battle by complaining that their feet were frozen.\n\nAnother possibility dates back to the 17th century, when “to have cold feet” meant “to have no money,” referring to someone being so poor as to lack shoes. The transition from the “no money” sense to the modern “timid” sense of “cold feet” may be found in an 1862\n\nGerman novel in which a card player withdraws from a game claiming that he has “cold feet” (i.e., no money), when in fact he has merely lost his nerve. “To get cold feet,” goes the theory, then eventually came to mean backing out of any risky situation, whatever excuse was given.\n\nDotty\n\nBr. slang, crazy or eccentric.

In a time when books were relatively expensive to print and bind, publishing longer works had a particular relationship to a reading public who borrowed books from commercial circulating libraries: a novel divided into three parts could create a demand (Part I whetting an appetite for Parts II and III); the income from Part I could pay for the printing costs of the later parts; and the librarian had three volumes earning their keep, rather than one.

If you ever find yourself in England on Boat Race night there are some things which it is absolutely necessary that you understand, if you mean to survive. Boat Race night is that night of nights when Oxford rows against Cambridge.\n\nWhat is important is the adherence to certain cultural protocols. For example, you must be well dressed. If your tailor is anything other than special you may as well not annoy the ancient day with your presence. Once you have succeeded in adding to the beauty of the landscape, you must find yourself a couple of equally well dressed chaps and plunge out in search of one of those most blessed merchants who deal strictly in the wines and spirits. You must be merry. As the psalmist said, “the wines must meet your heart and make it glad.” However, there is a line you must not cross. Yes, you must be somewhat floating in potent fluid, but you cannot impair your mental or physical abilities. You need to be able to walk, and more importantly . . . run. Now remember, this is still before the actual race. You will have ample time to imbibe after the race as well, so pace yourselves. If you drink too much before, then you will have to turn down drinks afterward. I recommend drinking to that perfect equilibrium, where one decides to eschew the consequences and knuckle down to spreading sweetness and light. You now attend the race. Yell and holler until your throat needs a second moistening, and then unaware of the victor, return to the beverages. Here you will remain until the most boat-raced member of your party announces that the time has come to meet the lesser magistrate. It is important that you have removed all means of identification from your person before this phase. It is also crucial that you not be arrested for disturbing the peace just yet, so attempt to restrain yourself from enacting the Barber of Seville for the time being. As I suspect this is your rookie Boat Race, you will be called upon by the others as the first to enact the most ancient and honored tradition the island kingdom has to offer.\n\nYou will be told to pinch a policeman’s helmet. Now some might have ethical qualms about such a deed. Put these aside, if the alcohol has not already done it for you, and move on like a man. If policemen didn’t want their helmets stolen, then why, I ask you, would they wear them on Boat Race night? Bear in mind that the policemen enjoy it in much the same way foxes probably enjoy being hunted. Approach the policeman from the rear. You will of course have to rob whatever policeman the boys have selected but remember that the bigger he is the slower he probably is. The smallish ones can be a bit tricky because they are generally able to run one down after the removal of the helmet.\n\nDo your best to disappear. This of course means that you must stop laughing. Even the morning dew has trouble disappearing on those spring mornings when it’s forever giggling. After assuming a position to the rear of your quarry, and in that last moment of truth, remember above all things not to simply grab the helmet and pull straight back. In such a case the policeman comes with it. This is utter failure. One must always pinch the helmet and never the policeman. If you were to steal a policeman, what on earth could you ever do with him? As for the helmet, when successfully purloined, it will be an heirloom of your family’s for generations to come. So remember, thrust forward on the helmet first, for this disengages the strap from the chin, and then pull back. At this point you run away. But as is normally the case, you will more likely find yourself in a cell for the rest of the night and standing before the local magistrate in the morning. When in the courtroom remember what name you gave the constable when you checked into the facilities the night before. I suggest that you have a name in readiness before the day begins so you are less likely to make one up off the cuff and forget it in the morning. You must now plead guilty as charged and settle for whatever the magistrate imposes. Some will settle for a mere reprimand which is quite reasonable for a night’s entertainment, accommodation, and breakfast in the morning. A most unreasonable fellow will send you up the river for three days, or soak you for five pounds. Upon exiting the courtroom, you are a free man. You may return from whence you came with one Boat Race beneath your belt, now part of a history that runs all the way back to Brude, King of the Picts. Stand tall.

The origin of this term is unclear, but commonly rumored to be because the ‘0’ next to his name on the scorecard resembles a duck egg, thus he has “laid an egg.”\n\nBrowsing and sluicing\n\nTo browse is to eat, nibble at, or feed on foliage, as in grazing in a pasture; Sluicing refers to the movement of water; here, to mean drinking.\n\nChapter 6\n\nRose gardens\n\nKnown in the PGW world as a dangerous trysting place, particularly in the moonlight; once the girl gets the fellow alone in the Rose Garden, it’s all over but the wedding\n\nBozo\n\nA fellow, especially a big, strong stupid one [1915–20]\n\nOne of those faces... which are known as Byronic\n\nAfter the poet Lord Byron (1788–1824). “He is like a solitary peak, all access to which is cut off not more by elevation than distance. His mood reminds us of the fabled Titans... taking up ordinary men and things in their hands with haughty indifference. He exists not by sympathy, but by antipathy.\n\nHe scorns all things, even himself. Nature must come to him to sit for her picture: he does not go to her. There is no ease, no unaffected simplicity of manner, no golden mien. All is strained, or petulant in the extreme.” William Hazlitt (1778–1830) English critic, on Lord Byron. In Chapter 19, Bertie refers to Byron as “A gloomy sort of bird, taking things the hard way.”\n\nAll-in wrestler\n\nAll-in is a type of wrestling without restrictions, with virtually every type of hold permitted.\n\nBlooomsbury\n\nA residential and academic district of London. Artists, writers and students living there have given it a reputation as an intellectual center. The membership of the Bloomsbury group — active from ca. 1904–1939 — is generally taken to include Lytton Strachey, Virginia Woolf, Leonard Woolf, E. M. Forster, Vita Sackville-West, Roger Fry, Clive Bell, and John Maynard Keynes.\n\nCrawling (to his aunts)\n\nTo behave in a remorseful, abject, apologetic or cringing manner\n\n(Facing the toughest aunt and making her) say Uncle\n\nTo concede defeat; a delicious Wodehousian pun\n\nCarbon paper\n\nThin, flimsy paper faced with a preparation of carbon or some other material used between two sheets of plain paper in order to reproduce on the lower sheet that which is written or typed on the upper.

The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.” English-born US statesman Thomas Paine (1737–1809) from The American Crisis, no. 1 (1776)\n\n(My soul is on the) rack\n\nAn archaic instrument of torture consisting of a framework on which a victim was tied, often spread eagled by the wrists and ankles, to be slowly stretched by spreading the parts of the framework\n\nAccept the rough with the smooth\n\nAdage meaning that one has to be prepared to accept the disadvantages as well as the advantages of something\n\nPrincely\n\nGreatly liberal, lavish, magnificent\n\nBrush-off\n\nA refusal to talk or listen to someone; abrupt or final dismissal or rebuff\n\nCricket\n\nfair play, honorable conduct\n\nFreak\n\nperson who has withdrawn from normal, rational behavior and activities to pursue one interest or obsession;\n\nof the first water\n\nthe highest quality, highest rank\n\nKnock(ed) me down with a feather\n\nAn expression of utter surprise, probably from the German”I am so tired and exhausted that it only takes a feather to knock me down.”\n\nTwin souls\n\nPersons who have a strong affinity for each other; soul mates [1815–25]\n\nBrusheroo\n\nTo brush off: Eroo: a suffix that creates familiar, usually jocular variations of semantically more neutral nouns; e.g., smackaroo, switcheroo\n\nLodestar\n\nA star that shows the way, something that serves as a guide or on which attention is fixed [1325–75]\n\nHanded me my papers\n\nSame as handed me my hat\n\nBucked\n\nBr.

Ma ragtime gal, Send me a kiss by wire, baby, my hearts on fire!

[NTPM]\n\nMake a noise like tearing calico\n\nI can’t find the origin of this phrase, or an exact definition, only the following references: “The machine-guns make a noise like a giant tearing calico... but the Bugatti was the sports model, a racer which made a noise often compared to that of tearing calico, or a mainsail splitting in a gale....from the most powerful fortissimo when you feel that the whole orchestra can erupt when it wishes to and the effect is so strong, it’s like tearing calico...the owls night cry is described as a noise like tearing calico... The Sabre sound was said to resemble the noise of tearing calico (i.e. a ripping buzz). .the voice came over the sea, a voice like the clamour of a hundred gulls, thin, rending, fierce as the sound of tearing calico...shouting in their fury, emitting a sound “like the tearing of calico,” they begin to laugh ... four days into her journey, at 11:40 P.M. on the night of April 14, she struck an iceberg.

Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone” Daniel 5:1–4 This banquet, given by Belshazzar, may well be the prototype of the “Babylonian orgy” to which Wodehouse periodically refers. It was during this meal that the “writing on the wall” appeared, announcing Belshazzar’s downfall. [NTPM]\n\nCraven\n\nA cowardly, contemptibly timid or pusillanimous person [1175–1225]\n\nSix Weeks on Sunny Devils Island\n\nFor comic effect, PGW capitalized it as though it were a travel brochure; Devils Island (actually a group of islands off the coast of French Guinea) housed an infamous, disease-infested French penal colony from 1852 until 1953\n\nRev. Aubrey Upjohn\n\nBertie’s old headmaster at Malvern House, mentioned throughout the Jeeves/Wooster canon, and remembered by Bertie mostly for the night: “I used to sneak down to (his) study at dead on night in quest of the biscuits he kept there in a tin on his desk, and there came back to me the memory of the occasion when...I had entered the sanctum in pyjamas and dressing gown, to find him seated in his chair, tucking into the biscuits himself. The What-does-this-mean-Woostering that ensued and the aftermath next morning—six of the best on the old spot—has always remained graven on the tables of my mind...” Jeeves in the Offing (1960) Murphy says that the character is based on PGW’s headmaster when he was at Malvern, Richard Harvey Hammond.\n\nCaptain Bligh\n\nInfamous Royal Navy Officer (1784–1817) and subject of Mutiny on the Bounty, written in 1831 by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall.\n\nPrelim boy\n\nboxing jargon, a “prelim boy” being a boxer who isn’t good enough to take part in any but the preliminary bouts on the program. Also called a “four-round” prelim boy, that being the length of the bouts preceding the main event. Robert E. Howard (1906–1936) used the phrase in a short story from 1931 entitled Kid Galahad.

The poem is a rhyming narrative from the point of view of a British soldier, about a native water-bearer who saves his life.\n\nIn a later chapter, Bertie says he used to recite it at school.\n\nFar, far better\n\n“It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done,” a sentence from the end of A Tale of Two Cities (1859) by Charles Dickens\n\nE’re\n\npoetic “before”\n\nFried to the tonsils\n\ndrunk\n\n...waterfront saloon when the Fleet is in\n\nAlludes to the reputed rowdy behavior of sailors on shore leave in the low dives in the vicinity of the docks\n\nMot juste\n\nFr, the exact appropriate word\n\nChapter 7\n\nSeigneur\n\nFr. , a lord, especially a feudal lord\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nthe time in European history between classical antiquity and the Italian Renaissance, from about 500 A.D. to about 1350\n\nCalling for my pipe and my bowl and my fiddlers three\n\nEnglish nursery rhyme:\n\n“Old King Cole was a merry old soul, a merry old soul was he; he called for his bowl in the middle of the night, and he called for his fiddlers three; Every fiddler had a fine fiddle, a very fine fiddle had he; O, there’s none so rare as can compare with King Cole and his fiddlers three”\n\nScrooched\n\nDrunk\n\nTurn my face to the wall\n\n“Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the Lord.” Isaiah 28.2; PGW used this phrase in the sense of gloom because he assumed his readers would know that the previous verse had said Hezekiah was “sick unto death” [NTPM]\n\nKeeper\n\nA person who assumes responsibility for another’s behavior; a person who guards or watches; esp. in a prison or asylum\n\n(Something) fishy\n\nImprobable or unlikely, i.e., “smelling bad,” as a story [1540–50] the title of PGW’s 1957 novel\n\nTearing off your whiskers\n\nTo unmask, as one in a disguise is identified; a Victorian melodrama cliché as when the hero, disguised for any number of reasons, finally reveals his true identity in a dramatic scene at the end\n\nSquared\n\nBribed\n\nMy bones turned to water\n\n“I stammered and stuttered.

T. Francis, from the 1908 New York production of The Girls of Gottenberg (not in the original 1907 London production nor its vocal score).\n\nThe sheet music is online.\n\nDiego Seguí comments:\n\n(Col.

Indigenous cultures across the globe hold similar myths and beliefs about the bluebird. It’s the most universally accepted symbol of cheerfulness, happiness, prosperity, hearth and home, get well soon, congratulations on the new baby, the renewal of springtime, any and all positive sentiments can be attached to the bluebird with practically no negative aspects. Bluebird mythology in Europe is noted in a fairy tale called L’Oiseau Bleu (The Blue Bird) by Madame d’Aulnoy (1650–1705) This seems to be the root source of most modern accounts of bluebird symbology and myth. In 1908 The Blue Bird was made into a stage play by Maurice Maeterlinck. (1862–1949) that he also called L’Oiseau bleu; an allegorical fantasy conceived as a play for children, it portrays a search for happiness in the world. In a fairy-tale-like setting, two children, the son and daughter of a poor woodcutter, are sent out by a fairy to search the world for the Blue Bird of Happiness. In a complex tale, they visit many magical places, including the Land of Memory, the Palace of Night, and the Kingdom of the Future. Only when they return home do they discover that the Blue Bird has been in their bird cage all along. True happiness, the children learn, is usually found close to home. It comes from making the journey, not from reaching the destination; from seeking and not from finding; and from acting unselfishly, without thought of reward. The Blue Bird was adapted for a 1919 film of the same name by Maurice Tourneur, one of the masters of early cinema. The Blue Bird was made into a successful film in 1940 starring popular child actress Shirley Temple (1928-] In 1916, The Bluebird, a musical composition by Clare Kummer, was exceedingly popular, and there were a rash of “bluebird songs” from Tin Pan Alley in the 1920s: Swanee Bluebird, My Blackbirds are Bluebirds Now, My Bluebird Was Caught in the Rain, Hello Bluebird, My Bluebird of Happiness, etc.\n\nGoose-flesher\n\nGoose flesh is a roughening condition of the skin resembling that of a plucked goose, induced by cold or fear [1375–1425], also known as goose bumps or goose pimples. The term goose-flesher, not contained in OED, may be a Wodehouse creation, which he uses to describe a thriller type of mystery novel so enjoyed by Bertie, so frightful and chilling as to cause goose-flesh (goose bumps). Literally, then, a goose-flesher makes the skin crawl\n\nMurder at Greystoke Grange\n\nA fictional book is a non-existent book created specifically for (i.e. within) a work of fiction. Such a book may provide the basis of the novel’s plot, add verisimilitude by supplying plausible background, or act as a common thread in a series of books or the works of a particular writer or canon of work. A fictional book may also be used as a conceit to illustrate a story within a story, or be essentially a joke title, thus helping to establish the humorous or satirical tone of the work. For Bertie’s library of goose-fleshers, PGW also created The Case of the Poisoned Doughnut, Inspector Biffen Views the Body, Murder in Mauve, The Mystery of the Pink Crayfish, all by an author he called Rex West. The plot scenarios, when given, are parodies of the genre. With Murder at Greystoke Grange, PGW may well have been paying a tribute to Edgar Rice Burroughs, whose stories he admired in his younger days. The ancestral home of Tarzan, whose parents were shipwrecked off the cost of Africa, was Greystoke and Tarzan was, in fact, The Earl of Greystoke.\n\nBlowing-in\n\nArrival\n\nLark on the wing\n\nSee God wasn’t in his heaven, Chapter 3\n\nWrack\n\nA trac"
