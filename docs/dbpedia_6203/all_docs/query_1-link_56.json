His first appearance was in \"Exciting Comics\" #15 (December 1941), published by Nedor Comics. The character was later revived by writer Alan Moore for \"America's Best Comics\".\n\nNedor Comics\n\nThe Liberator is the secret identity of Professor Nelson Drew, a chemistry teacher at fictional Claflin University. He discovered an ancient Egyptian formula called Lamesis that gives him superhuman strength and speed. Drew uses his powers as The Liberator to fight Nazi saboteurs during World War II.\n\nThe Liberator debuted in \"Exciting Comics\" #15, and appeared regularly in that title and \"America's Best Comics\" (not to be confused with the later DC Comics imprint). His last Golden Age appearance was in \"Exciting Comics\" #35 (October 1944).\n\nAmerica's Best Comics\n\nAlan Moore revived the Liberator, along with many other Nedor Comics characters that had entered the public domain, for his Tom Strong series. In \"Tom Strong\" #12 (June 2001), the Liberator was revealed to have been one of the members of SMASH that had been placed in suspended animation after an alien invasion from the moon in 1969. Awakened 30 years later, the Liberator joined his former comrades in the fight against the alien. SMASH disbanded shortly thereafter, but reformed three years later. The Liberator is a member of the reformed group.\n\nee also\n\n*Nedor Comics\n\nExternal links"
