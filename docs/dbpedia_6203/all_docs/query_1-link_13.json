        "text": "OK, now that we have 2 strong votes for MLJ, I will post the rest of my list.\n\nMany hundreds of years ago when I was young, I was interested in Golden Age hero books but poor . I spent a lot of time looking at GA titles/companies to find ones that were worth collecting but not as expensive as Timely and DC. I finally settled on:\n\n1). MLJ. For reasons given above by both me and Shawn. I ended up collecting near complete sets of Hangman and Pep. Both are great titles--easily as good as anything that Timely or DC put out at the time.\n\n2). Fox. Great early GA superhero books and late GA GGA books. I mostly concentrated on All Top (Rulah, Phantom Lady and the Blue Beetle )\n\n3). Nedor. Awesome Schomburg war covers and the Black Terror is one of the most stylish characters of the GA. Also the prehero issues of Exciting have some great early SF work in them. And the late GA issues have Xela covers.\n\nI also added non-hero books from Dell by Carl Barks, John Stanley and Walt Kelly. And some reprint books such as Tip Top with Nancy and Sluggo and Peanuts.\n\nSince that time I have added Airboy (HIllman Pub.) to the list--excellent stories, great covers (especially on Air Fighters) and REALLY cheap!\n\nOh, and Simon and Kirby romance books, too. Great stuff!\n\nThere are just such a huge number of publishers, genres, titles, characters and artists to choose from in the GA. I would urge everyone who is interested in GA books to pick up a few and see for yourself. You may be very pleasantly surprised.\n\n12 hours ago, Electricmastro said:\n\nThe short-lived, but fascinating company known as Rural Home, whom in addition to creating some interesting covers also created some interesting features, such as Maureen Marine, Blue Circle, Green Turtle, Gail Porter, and Captain Wizard.\n\nThat Blue Circle 6 is interesting to me. This is a 3rd known cover variation I have seen. This one says Bugsie Siegel. I recently saw one with Martin Kane. My copy has nothing. Odd, as it would have cost the publisher additional money. The cover would have been printed with probably plate changes throughout the run. They would have had to stop, change the plate, put on another roll of paper several times. Seems more trouble than it was worth.\n\nSeems like all the ones I have seen contain Fox comics. Later Fox comics always have the first page on the inside front cover which is always missing on reprints. They would have to repaginate and maybe drop an ad page to make the first story complete.\n\nNot only is my copy missing the first page but there is even a blank front and back page in back to make it a complete 4 page signature. Mine is a copy of Murder Inc from 1948.\n\nInteresting topic.\n\nTo me, the answer depends on whether you mean unappreciated back in the day or unappreciated now. Because Centaur, Star, Nedor, Fiction House, and just about every other publisher mentioned on this thread so far are highly appreciated by devoted droves of collectors on this very site.\n\nOf the publishers mentioned so far, I'd agree that Quality comics are, by far, the least appreciated by collectors as a whole (with some notable titles as exceptions). But I do think that there is a GA publisher that is ever more unappreciated:\n\nHarvey Comics. Here's why:\n\n* Harvey is a true GA publisher starting with superhero comics in 1940. It published superheros throughout the war:\n\n* Harvey Comics gave us what is perhaps the least appreciated GA superhero of them all: The Black Cat. A superhero in continuous publication from 1941 to 1957 (outlasting many other superheros) and which was revived in 1962 (a better record than Timely's characters). First Black Cat cover:\n\n* In the latter 1940s, Harvey commenced serving up a helping of classic adventure comic strip characters:\n\n* In 1949 Harvey dove into the Romance genre with several long running titles:\n\n* Harvey Comics had a healthy helping of PCH horror in the vein of EC starting in 1951, which features some absolutely classic covers;\n\n* Harvey helped pioneer and dominate kiddie comics starting in 1951. NO pictures necessary.\n\nI could go on, as they published other genres and collectable comics.\n\nBUT, most here just don't appreciate this output, I think, as much as it deserves."
