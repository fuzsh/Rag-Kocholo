Financial support for the Luiz André Barroso Award is provided by Google. Nomination information for the award can be found here.\n\nACM's US Technology Policy Committee has released a “Statement on Mass Cybersecurity Incidents Likely to Recur.” On July 18, 2024, CrowdStrike, a US-based cybersecurity technology company, released a sensor configuration update which caused a global outage affecting an estimated 8.5 million computers. Several critical infrastructure sectors including airlines, 911 emergency systems, banks, government agencies, healthcare, and hospitals around the world were impacted. While CrowdStrike has provided some information as to how the accident happened, ACM USTPC urges that all the details be thoroughly and publicly investigated.\n\nKe Fan of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Daniel Nichols of the University of Maryland are the 2024 ACM-IEEE CS George Michael Memorial HPC Fellowship recipients.The George Michael Memorial Fellowship honors exceptional PhD students throughout the world whose research focus is high-performance computing (HPC) applications, networking, storage, or large-scale data analytics. The Fellowships will be formally presented at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC24) in November.\n\nThe ever-changing landscape of technology, the computing industry, and resulting societal impacts carry great potential for persons with disabilities. On July 10, 2024, ACM DEI Council hosted the panel, \"Accessibility in Computing: Trends, Challenges and Opportunities.\" Panelists explored a range of topics about the current trends in accessibility in computing and how the industry is incorporating inclusive designs to meet diverse needs. Panelists discussed the gaps in accessibility that technology companies and others should address creating a more inclusive digital space.\n\nWe are at the forefront of a technological revolution where generative AI is redefining the boundaries of what's possible within enterprise environments. What are the key challenges enterprises face when integrating generative AI into their existing software ecosystems? And how is generative AI changing the day-to-day work of developers and engineers? For the answers to these questions and more, you can now view \"Generative AI in Enterprise Software\" with host Bushra Anjum and a panel of experts representing diverse fields—Mamta Suri, Elaine Zhou, and Rebecca Sanchez—as they explore the current trends, challenges, and future prospects of integrating generative AI into enterprise software.\n\nACM has joined with the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence to develop \"Computer Science Curricula 2023” (CS2023). CS2023 provides a comprehensive guide outlining the knowledge and competencies students should attain for degrees in computer science and related disciplines at the undergraduate level. Establishing uniform curricular guidelines for computer science disciplines is essential to the ongoing vitality of the field and the future success of those who study it.\n\nIn a major step in its transition to fully Open Access (OA) publication of all content on the ACM Digital Library, ACM will transition the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS) to a fully OA publishing model from January 2024. In the new model, all ICPS papers will be made OA upon publication, and existing ICPS papers will be converted to OA. Some authors who are not at ACM Open institutions will be required to pay Article Processing Charges (APCs). The model will apply to all conferences for which the Call for Papers will be issued on or after January 1, 2024.\n\nACM has created a new Skills Bundle add-on providing unlimited access to ACM's collection of thousands of online books, courses, and training videos from O'Reilly, Skillsoft Percipio, and Pluralsight. ACM’s collection includes more than 60,000 online books and video courses from O’Reilly, 9,700 online courses and 11,000 eBooks and audiobooks from Skillsoft, and 2,000 courses from Pluralsight.\n\nThe new Skills Bundle add-on is available to paid Professional Members only.

The scope of the journal is multi-disciplinary and broad, spanning statistics, machine learning, computer systems, and the societal implications of data science. JDS accepts original papers as well as novel surveys that summarize and organize critical subject areas. The ACM/IMS Journal of Data Science is a Gold Open Access publication, permanently and freely available online for anyone, anywhere to read.\n\nACM publications had an impressive showing in the newest Journal Citation Reports from Clarivate Analytics. ACM Computing Surveys continued its impressive ascent, receiving an impact factor of 23.8, up from 16.6 in 2023, and placing it first out of the 143 journals in the Computer Science, Theory & Methods category. Communications of the ACM boasted continued strong performance, with an impact factor of 11.1, placing it first in the Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture category for the second year in a row; third of 131 titles in the Computer Science, Software Engineering category; and sixth of 143 journals in the Computer Science, Theory & Methods category.\n\nACM has made the decision to cease print publication for ACM’s journals and transactions as of January 2024. There were several motivations for this change: ACM wants to be as environmentally friendly as possible; print journals lack the new features and functionality of the electronic versions in the ACM Digital Library; and print subscriptions, which have been declining for years, have now reached a level where the time was right to sunset print. Please contact [email protected] should you have any questions.\n\nOver the years, computing has progressed remarkably thanks to the contributions of individuals from diverse backgrounds who have incorporated their unique experiences and perspectives into technological advancements. Yet despite these significant contributions, award recognition for individuals from diverse backgrounds remains underrepresented. In \"Science Needs You: Mobilizing for Diversity in Award Recognition,\" co-authors Elizabeth Novoa-Monsalve, David Patterson, Stephanie Ludi, and Daniel E. Acuna offer insights on how to create a more inclusive and equitable system of award recognition within the scientific community.\n\nACM TechBriefs is a series of short technical bulletins by ACM’s Technology Policy Council that present scientifically-grounded perspectives on the impact of specific developments or applications of technology. Designed to complement ACM’s activities in the policy arena, the primary goal is to inform rather than advocate for specific policies. The new edition concerns the proliferation of data collection, advanced algorithms, and powerful computers which have made it easy to piece together information about individuals’ private lives from public information—even as controls over information privacy become increasingly ineffective.\n\nOnce considered science fiction, autonomous weapons systems long ago left the drawing board for the battlefield. Employed in conflicts today, such systems remain controversial and are ungoverned by any broad binding international agreement. The ACM US Technology Policy Committee hosted the HotTopics webinar: \"Death by Algorithm: The Use, Control, and Legality of Lethal and Other Autonomous Weapons Systems\" with Larry Medsker (Moderator), Ronald C. Arkin, Gary Corn, Jack Shanahan, and Jody Westby discussing this timely and critical subject.\n\nIn response to major advances in generative AI technologies—as well as the significant questions these technologies pose in areas including intellectual property, the future of work, and even human safety—ACM's global Technology Policy Council (TPC) has issued \"Principles for the Development, Deployment, and Use of Generative AI Technologies.\" Drawing on the deep technical expertise of computer scientists in the United States and Europe, the TPC statement outlines eight principles intended to foster fair, accurate, and beneficial decision-making concerning generative and all other AI technologies.\n\nIn celebration of Pride Month, ACM hosted a panel discussion centered around technological advances and its importance in connecting LGBTQ+ individuals worldwide. Queer users have utilized virtual reality and social media platforms to create a safe environment for community gathering and authentic self-expression. “Virtual Realities: How Tech Can Empower the LGBTQ+ Community,” featured panelists Andreea Danielescu, Sharone Horowit-Hendler, and Michael Ann Devito with Guo Freeman as the moderator. Panelists shared their research on how LGBTQ+ identities and technology intersect.\n\nElizabeth K. “Beth” Hawthorne is a Full Professor and Graduate Program Director of Cybersecurity at Northeastern University's Arlington, Virginia campus.

The event will be held Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.\n\nACM has relaunched Communications of the ACM (CACM) as a web-first publication, accessible to all without charge—including the entire backlog of CACM articles. First published in 1958, CACM is one of the most respected information technology magazines. The web-first model will allow ACM to publish articles more rapidly than before so that readers can keep abreast of the lightning-fast changes in the computing field. At the same time, researchers will be able to reference and cite valuable information and research from CACM articles more quickly. This marks another important milestone in ACM's ongoing transition to a fully open access publisher.\n\nIn the September issue of Communications of the ACM, Maarten Bullynck and Liesbeth De Mol consider the historical distinction between coder and programmer. It is a stock element in narratives of 1950s computing to distinguish between programmers and coders, the latter considered a “lowly technician” doing the routine job of converting flowcharts or pseudo-instructions into coded machine instructions. This division of labor between coders and programmers is often overlaid with social distinctions of education and gender—creating a discourse that has been influential until today.\n\nMPC (multiparty computation) was introduced to the world in 1982—at about the same time the Commodore 64 was announced. Why are we still talking about MPC more than 40 years later? Well, it turns out MPC is based on some extremely complex math, which is like nectar to anyone in the field of cryptography. And, over the past decade, MPC has come to be exhumed from the archives and harnessed as one of the most powerful tools available for the protection of sensitive data. Here, in a discussion with Nigel Smart, Joshua W. Baron, Sanjay Saravanan, Jordan Brandt, and Atefeh Mashatan, we explore some of the implications of these advances.\n\nACM Queue’s \"Research for Practice\" serves up expert-curated guides to the best of computing research, and relates these breakthroughs to the challenges that software engineers face every day. In this installment, \"Automatically Testing Database Systems,\" Manuel Rigger (Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore) presents three papers. The first focuses on the problem of automatically synthesizing sophisticated test oracles that check whether the outputs of a database history are correct. The second co-designs input generation and test oracle in order to focus strictly on bugs in concurrency control. The last covers a diverse input space of SQL dialects while relying on the \"built-in\" test oracle of system crashes.\n\nACM is excited to announce a new enhancement of to the widely used ACM email forwarding service. Through a partnership with MailRoute, SMTP Auth Relay is now available for member use. To start sending fully authenticated email as your @acm.org address, simply log in at https://myacm.acm.org and click the \"SMTP Auth Relay\" link.\n\nACM recently updated its Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. The revised Code of Ethics addresses the significant advances in computing technology since the 1992 version, as well as the growing pervasiveness of computing in all aspects of society. To promote the Code throughout the computing community, ACM created a booklet, which includes the Code, case studies that illustrate how the Code can be applied to situations that arise in everyday practice and suggestions on how the Code can be used in educational settings and in companies and organizations. Download a PDF of the ACM Code booklet."
