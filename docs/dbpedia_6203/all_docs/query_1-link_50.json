        "text": "Malaysia offers a wide range of tax incentives ranging from tax exemptions, allowances to enhanced tax deductions. Generally tax incentives are available for tax resident companies.\n\nPioneer Status (PS) is an incentive in the form of tax exemption, which is granted to companies participating in promoted activities or producing promoted products, for a period of 5 or 10 years.\n\nThe alternative to the PS incentive is usually investment tax allowance (ITA). ITA is an incentive granted based on the capital expenditure incurred on industrial buildings, plant and machinery used for the purpose of promoted activities or the production of promoted products. This incentive is generally given for a period of 5 or 10 years.\n\nPS and ITA are mutually exclusive. Where income is exempted under the PS incentive, tax exempt dividends may be paid out of the exempted income. Unutilised ITA can be carried forward until fully utilised. However unutilised PS losses can only be carried forward for a maximum period of 7 consecutive YAs after the end of the pioneer period. For unutilised PS losses accumulated as at YA 2018, where the incentive has already expired, these losses can be carried forward for another 7 YAs until YA 2025.\n\nMalaysia has undertaken a review of its tax incentives and excluded royalties and intellectual property income from its tax incentives in line with the requirements of BEPS Action 5 (Counter Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, Taking into Account Transparency and Substance).\n\nAn Approved Incentive Scheme is proposed for high technology activity in the manufacturing and services sectors and other activities which benefit the Malaysian economy. Under the scheme, a concessionary tax rate of not more than 20% is to be prescribed by the Minister of Finance (MoF).\n\nIn the following pages, we provide a summary of the main tax incentives for the relevant industry sectors."
