Existing businesses may also have obligations to provide accessible services under the City of Chicago Human Rights Ordinances (Title 6 of the Municipal Code). For more information, contact the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities (MOPD).\n\nBuilding (New Construction)\n\n2019 Chicago Building Code\n\nUnder the Phase 2 Code Modernization Ordinance, the 2019 Chicago Building Code (Title 14B), based on the 2018 IBC, applies to most permit applications started on or after August 1, 2020:\n\nView full text of 2019 Chicago Building Code from ICC\n\nChicago Amendments to 2018 International Building Code from American Legal Publishing\n\nAdditional requirements may apply to regulated businesses, and these requirements are found in the applicable business license provisions in Title 4 of the Municipal Code.\n\nConveyance Devices\n\nRequirements for elevators, escalators, and other conveyance devices are found in Title 14C (effective October 1, 2018). These requirements are partially based on and incorporate provisions of model codes published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and other standards development organizations. These documents are available for purchase from their respective publishers:\n\nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) http://www.asme.org/\n\nAutomotive Lift Institute (ALI) http://www.autolift.org/\n\nAmerican Society of Safety Professionals (ASSP) (formerly known as the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE)) http://www.assp.org/\n\nAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI) http://www.ansi.org/\n\nElectrical\n\nThe Chicago Electrical Code (Title 14E of the Municipal Code) incorporates provisions of the 2017 National Electrical Code, which is published by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). These provisions are incorporated by reference and not reprinted in the ordinance. A free, read-only document which compiles the model code provisions and amendments adopted by the City of Chicago, hosted by NFPA, can be viewed at:\n\nhttps://link.nfpa.org/free-access/publications/70/2017Chicago\n\nFor frequent users of the code, this compiled version of the Chicago Electrical Code is available for purchase from NFPA in various formats.\n\nFire Prevention\n\n2019 Chicago Building Code and Interim Chicago Fire Prevention Code\n\nUnder the Phase 2 Construction Code Modernization Ordinance, the 2019 Chicago Building Code (Title 14B) and Interim Chicago Fire Prevention Code (Title 14F) apply to most permit applications started on or after August 1, 2020. While the City of Chicago continues to study modernization of the Chicago Fire Prevention Code, many provisions of Title 15 of the Municipal Code of Chicago continue to be referenced in the Interim Fire Prevention Code.\n\nFor more information on these provisions, contact the Fire Prevention Bureau.\n\nFuel Gas\n\nRequirements for fuel gas (natural gas) installations are found in Chapter 18-28, Article XIV, and are based on the 2000 International Fuel Gas Code published by the International Code Council (ICC).

These provisions are primarily administered by the Department of Water Management (DWM).\n\nThese same requirements are referenced in the Interim Plumbing Code (Title 14P).\n\nSigns\n\nSign requirements are found in both the Building Code (Chapter 13-20, Article XIII; Chapter 13-96, Articles I and II) and Zoning Ordinance (Title 17). Electrified and illuminated signs must also comply with the Chicago Electrical Code.\n\nWork in Existing Buildings (Repairs, Alterations, and Additions)\n\n2019 Chicago Building Rehabilitation Code\n\nWork in existing buildings, including repairs, alterations, and additions is not required to meet all requirements for new construction but must meet the requirements of the Chicago Building Rehabilitation Code. Work in existing buildings is also required to meet the applicable energy conservation requirements (see above).\n\nUnder the Phase 2 Code Modernization Ordinance, the 2019 Chicago Building Rehabilitation Code (Title 14R), became optional for permit applications started on or after December 1, 2019, and mandatory for most permit applications started on or after August 1, 2020.\n\nView full text of the Chicago Building Rehabilitation Code from ICC\n\nChicago Amendments to 2018 International Existing Building Code from American Legal Publishing\n\nMinimum Requirements for Existing Buildings\n\nMinimum standards applicable to all buildings are found in Title 14X.\n\nUnder the Phase 2 Code Modernization Ordinance, adopted April 10, 2019, Title 14X superseded older retroactive provisions (primarily Chapter 13-196) on July 1, 2020.\n\nZoning\n\nThe Chicago Zoning Ordinance is Title 17 of the Municipal Code of Chicago. The Chicago Zoning Ordinance is distinct from the Chicago Building Code and is administered by the Department of Planning and Development, Bureau of Zoning. Additional land use regulations administered by the Zoning Bureau are found in Title 16."
