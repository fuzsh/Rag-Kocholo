        "text": "The Los Angeles Public Library is now the home of Angel City Press.\n\nLos Angeles Public Library has acquired Angel City Press, the highly regarded local publisher of non-fiction books focused on the art, architecture, history, and personalities of Los Angeles and Southern California.\n\nThe details of Angel City Press's transfer to Angel City Press at Los Angeles Public Library are currently being finalized. For more information about Angel City Press, visit angelcitypress.com.\n\nVisit Angel City Press\n\nAdditional Information and Frequently Asked Questions\n\nOn December 14, 2023, the Board of Library Commissioners approved the gift agreement with the owners of Angel City Press (ACP) for the management and operation of the Library's \"Angel City Press at Los Angeles Public Library.\n\nThe acquisition, a donation from ACP co-founders Paddy Calistro and Scott McAuley seamlessly transfers the fully operational book publishing entity to the Library. In addition to the publisher's back stock of titles, the gift includes the press's contracted working relationships with numerous Los Angeles-based authors, as well as their books currently in production. the Library will maintain Angel City Press' editorial guidelines, and Terri Accomazzo, who has more than a decade of experience at the press, will serve as Editorial Director.\n\n\"Bringing Angel City Press to the Library is a natural extension of our mission to amplify the voice of authors, celebrate their work, and preserve their stories,\" said City Librarian John F. Szabo. \"This is a publisher that is renowned for its role in helping writers create books that explore all that is quintessentially Los Angeles. As the new stewards of Angel City Press, we are thrilled to continue and expand that tradition.\"\n\nAngel City Press and the Library have a decades-long relationship, which includes ACP publishing books that have been inspired by the Library's holdings, including its special collections of sheet music (Songs in the Key of Los Angeles), menus (To Live and Dine in L.A.) and autographs (The Autograph Book of L.A.), as well as a volume about the historic Central Library (Los Angeles Central Library: A History of Its Art and Architecture). Dozens of ACP volumes are illustrated with images drawn from the Library's extensive collection of 3.5 million historic photographs.\n\nScott McAuley and Paddy Calistro co-founded Angel City Press in 1992 as a publisher of high-quality nonfiction books. The first work, Hollywood du Jour, written by Los Angeles journalist Betty Goodwin, was the first illustrated book to document the recipes and histories of legendary Hollywood restaurants. An instant success, Hollywood du Jour was featured in book and gift store windows throughout the region, and soon the country. Since then, the publisher has engaged more than 100 Southern California authors and produced more than 135 works.\n\nWhen McAuley and Calistro decided to retire and find a new home for Angel City Press, they approached the Los Angeles Public Library. \"As Scott and I enter the next chapter of our lives, after more than 30 years as publishers, we are thrilled that Angel City Press's next chapter is as part of the Los Angeles Public Library,\" said ACP President Calistro. \"We are so proud of the vital role Angel City Press plays in telling the story of so many extraordinary people, places and trends that make Los Angeles renowned the world over. This transition helps ensure that our authors and our readers will continue to enjoy ACP's unique approach. We firmly believe that no single book can ever sufficiently tell the story of Los Angeles. And the Library agrees.\"\n\nThe Library is committed to continuing the legacy of ACP with new books it publishes, as well as extending the reach of titles locally, nationally and internationally. the Library is dedicated to not only expanding access through audiobook and e-book formats but also finding new ways to encourage Angelenos to read about their history. The Library will utilize its staff of librarians and their extensive experience and knowledge to benefit ACP.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
