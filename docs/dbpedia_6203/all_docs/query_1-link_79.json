        "text": "If you have just started doing PvP recently in World of Warcraft, including the Dragonflight expansion, you might find an item called the Mark of Honor in your inventory. You would be understandably confused because these items don’t contribute toward anything currently active in the game. We’re here to show you where they are, listed by each expansion. Here’s where to find every Mark of Honor Vendor in World of Warcraft.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhere to Find All Mark of Honor Vendors in WoW Dragonflight\n\nMarks of Honor are used at specific vendors in every major expansion of World of Warcraft, going back to Burning Crusade. You’ll need to go to specific vendors in each city to cash in your Marks of Honor.\n\nDragonflight Vendor Location\n\nThe PvP vendor for Dragonflight, Seltherex, is located at the back of the Gladiator’s Refuge in the city of Valdrakken. Here, you can purchase the Drakebreaker’s armor set for any of your characters. These require Bloody Tokens to purchase, which you can acquire from bloody battles of the Dragon Isles in the Dragonflight expansion for World of Warcraft.\n\nShadowlands Vendor Location\n\nYou’re looking for Purveyor Zo’kuul or Zo’sorg, both located inside The Enclave in Oribos.\n\nBattle for Azeroth Vendor Location\n\nIf you’re on the Alliance side, talk to Marshal Gabriel inside your War Headquarters, the Salt and Shanty.\n\nHorde players also need to look in their War Headquarters for Xander Silberman.\n\nLegion Vendor Location\n\nLieutenant Surtees and Captain Roberts, inside Greyfang Enclave, will take Alliance marks off your hands.\n\nIf you’re on the Horde side, go to Windrunner’s Sanctuary, where you’ll find Apothecary Lee and Sarah the Savage. You’ll find both of these spots in the newer version of Dalaran.\n\nWarlords of Draenor Vendor Location\n\nAshran is home to the Mark of Honor vendors for this part of the game. For Alliance players, head to Stormshield, and choose one of these vendors: Bregg Coppercast, Ingrid Blackingot, Slugg Spinbolt, Holly McTilla, Li “Crunchpaw” Tsang, and Amelia Clarke.\n\nOver on the Horde Side, you’ll need to go to Warspear and talk to Stone Guard Brokefist, Fobbly Kickfix, Blood Guard Axelash, Malukah Lightsong, Class Dawnstrider, or Tae’loxe Soulshrivel.\n\nMists of Pandaria Vendor Location\n\nAlliance and Horde players must go to their respective parts of Serpent’s Spine. Alliance members can speak to Starlight Sinclair, Ethan Natice, Armsmaster Holinka, Hayden Cristophen, or Lucan Malory.\n\nHorde players can do business with Lol’nor Bloodfist, Doris Chiltonius, Roo Desvin, Acon Deathwielder, and Shonn Su.\n\nCataclysm Vendors Location\n\nCataclysm has faction-exclusive vendors, and one area where both sides can turn in Marks of Honor. Alliance players are allowed in the Champion’s Hall in Stormwind, selling to Edlan Halsing, Lieutenant Tristia, Knight-Lieutenant T’Maire Sydes, and Captain Dirgehammer.\n\nHorde players can purchase in Orgrimmar’s Hall of Legends from Rogoc, Doris Volanthius, Blood Guard Zar’shit, and Sergeant Thunderhorn. In addition, all players can go to Gagetzan in Tanaris, where you’ll find Vixton Punchwhistle, Blazzek the Biter, Tiny Tayger, and Capps Carlin.\n\nWrath of the Lich King Vendor Location\n\nAll players, regardless of faction, will need to check out the Circle of Wills, located in Old Dalaran’s Underbelly. Trapjaw Rix, Blazik Fireclaw, Herwin Steampop, Xazi Smolderpipe, Zom Bocom, and Kylo Kelwin will all accept your Marks of Honor.\n\nBurning Crusade Vendor Location\n\nOnce again, you won’t need to be a specific faction to find these vendors. Go to Area 52 in the Netherstorm, and talk to Kezzik the Striker, Kitzie Crankshot, Blaze Magmaburn, or Izzee the Clutch. The same area also contains a second set of NPCs to give your Marks of Honor: Big Zokk Torquewrench, Grex Brainboiler, Tini Smalls, Leeni “Smiley” Smalls, and Krixel Pinchwhistle."
