Which book agencies are best in New York City? And, what’s the best way to find New York City publishing agencies looking for new writers and clients? Use the free List of Literary Agents below to find all NYC literary agencies. For example, authors have used our literary agent database to get offers of representation with New York City publishing agents including: Jennifer DeChiara with Jennifer DeChiara Literary Agency, Donald Maass with Donald Maass Literary Agency, and Jennifer Lyons with Jennifer Lyons with Jennifer Lyons Literary Agency. The official Directory of Literary Agents™ has bios and contact information for all New York City book agencies, including the Best Literary Agents at the Top Literary Agencies in NYC.\n\nIn addition to New York City literary agencies, you can use our literary agency database for all other Literary Agents Near Me searches. For example: NYC Literary Agents, Los Angeles Literary Agents, and DC Literary Agents. Our Literary Agent Database and Directory has profiles for all writer representatives in the USA, not just New York City. Our list is comprehensive and includes both established and new author representatives. It also includes writer representatives with independent book agents working at Boutique Literary Agencies, as well as large book agencies. Scroll below to find all NYC literary agencies and literary agents. You’ll also find important facts and statistics about New York City book agencies and author representatives.\n\nAre Literary Agencies in NYC the Best?\n\nMost successful literary agencies are located in New York City, but not all of them. Why are most of the best agents in NYC? Because most of the large traditional, mainstream, or secular publishers are located in NYC. Since the main function of literary agents is to sell authors’ books to publishers, it makes sense for serious literary agents to live in New York City. If you want to fish–and get paid to fish–it makes sense to put your boat afloat where there are lots of fish.\n\nIf you’re a literary agent and your agency isn’t in NYC, it’s that much harder to: familiarize yourself with the affinities and proclivities of the editors working at the publishing houses that buy books. And it’s that much harder to develop relationships with those acquiring editors. Agents outside Manhattan can make trips to NYC to meet editors at their offices, meet them at publishing industry events like Book Expo America, and make contact or stay in touch with editors via email and phone–but it isn’t the same.\n\nYou know the expression: Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nThe bottom line is literary agents in NYC have three important advantages, simply because of their proximity to editors and publishers.\n\nThey often get more time for their pitches\n\nThey often get more feedback on their pitches\n\nThey often get better terms for their authors\n\nHowever, before you decide you’re only going to query NYC literary agencies, consider the following:\n\nThere are many successful literary agencies in the areas surrounding NYC such as New Jersey, etc.\n\nSome successful literary agencies and literary agents used to live in NYC, then moved for personal reasons, such as to take care of their ailing mother, etc. They’re significantly better than those who’ve only been to New York occasionally–or never at all.\n\nMany successful literary agencies that have one foot in the book business and the other in the rest of the entertainment world such as television and feature film are headquartered elsewhere. See Literary Agencies in California.\n\nMost faith-based publishers (barring those that are simply “imprints” of the major secular publishers, and, therefore, literary agencies are not located in New York. They’re in Tennessee, and elsewhere.\n\nList of NYC Literary Agencies – Finding a Literary Agent\n\n3 Arts Entertainment\n\nA Literary Agency for Children’s Books\n\nA+B Works\n\nAbrams Artists Agency\n\nAevitas Creative Management\n\nAGI Vigliano Literary, LLC\n\nAnderson Literary Management\n\nAnn Elmo Agency\n\nAnn Rittenberg Literary Agency\n\nAnne Edelstein Literary Agency\n\nAragi Agency\n\nAvenue A Literary\n\nAyesha Pande Literary\n\nBankoff Collaborative\n\nBarbara Braun Associates\n\nBarbara Hogenson Agency\n\nBarbara Kouts Literary Agency\n\nBaror International\n\nBarry Goldblatt Literary (BG Literary)\n\nBeth Vesel Literary Agency\n\nBlanche C.
