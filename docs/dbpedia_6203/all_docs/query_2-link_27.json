        "text": "You already know what happens to textbooks after we use them, as we’ve already written about reselling, donating, or recycling. However, today, we are excited to shift the conversation to the origins of books!\n\nBy “origins,” we are not referring to the warehouses where the books are printed. Instead, we are talking about the publishers who produce and distribute books and information.\n\nAccording to the 2012 study A Research Study on Textbook Recycling in America, “There are currently 33 textbook publishers in the U.S., and 310 “General Education” publishers. Combined, they produce over 4.3 billion books annually, and are also responsible for disposing of obsolete book inventories over which they have control.” You may be surprised by this large number. Among hundreds of companies, five stand out in the publishing industry as powerhouses. These top five educational publishers are:\n\nCengage Learning\n\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt\n\nMcGraw-Hill Education\n\nPearson Education\n\nScholastic\n\nYou might recall some of the names mentioned here if not all of them. Perhaps you remember seeing them at the book fairs you attended as a child (e.g., Scholastic has been hosting great fairs until this day).\n\nYet, while the top five publishers are well-known, they only represent a small fraction of the total number of textbook publishers out there. As we’ve already mentioned, there are at least 310 active publishers specializing in General Education. Yet, exploring them all would be quite a challenge. Therefore, we believe it’s best to present this information in a more manageable way and are delighted to introduce you to twenty great publishers from all around the world!\n\n20 Leading Textbook Publishers\n\n1.

Although they differ somewhat in their specific areas of focus, they all have a significant impact on the book and information industries.\n\nHow Are Publishers Impacted by Changes in the Industry?\n\nWhile publishers make an impact on the industry, the industry is also shifting. Publishers are finding creative ways to hold strong in the book and information industry. As seen above, most textbook companies and publishers have expanded their platforms to include digital publications and tech-based tools to maintain or increase engagement across all users. For professionals and educators, new apps and databases are being developed by publishing companies. Many textbook publishers are increasing their selection of digital book publications for students.\n\nThe demand for lowering education costs is causing the switch from print to digital. Creative solutions like rental and resale companies, as well as price comparison platforms like BookScouter, are also inspiring publishers to be creative on ways to remain in the market. And they have to do it. These massive publication companies are the place of work for thousands and thousands of people and offer writers, educators, scientists, and professionals compensation for their work. They are also responsible for keeping mass information accessible to the public.\n\n‘Cause will sitting down with a good book ever end? We doubt it. Who can resist a great book?"
