Smart Communications can be abbreviated to \"Smart Comm\" and the institution name can be removed from the address all together.\n\nSmart Comm – John Smith/ AB1234\n\nPO Box 33028\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL 33733\n\nWhat return address should inmates use on outgoing mail?\n\nInmates are required to use the Smart Communications address with their name and inmate number as the return address.\n\nSmart Communications\n\nJoe Jones/AB1234\n\nSCI Camp Hill\n\nPO Box 33028\n\nSt Petersburg FL 33733\n\nWhen will inmates receive their mail?\n\nIt can take 6-8 days for inmates to receive their mail. Smart Communications processes the mail within 24 hours of its reception at their processing center in St. Petersburg, Florida. However, it can take the United States Postal Service 3-5 days to deliver the mail to Smart Communications. A reasonable effort will then be made by the DOC mailrooms to ensure that incoming inmate mail is delivered to the inmate within 48 hours from the time the mail is delivered to the prison.\n\nThis excludes weekends and holidays, mail which contains content requiring review by the IPRC and mail that is being held for investigative purposes at the prison.\n\nWhat does Smart Communications do with the original mail?\n\nAll original mail will be retained for a period of 45 days unless otherwise instructed by DOC. After 45 days, original mail will be destroyed.\n\nWhat happens to the electronic copies?\n\nAll scanned mail is uploaded to a database that is organized/sorted by inmate. It is sent to inmates' location six days per week. When the electronic mail reaches the facility, staff can approve, deny or forward mail. Approved mail is printed and delivered to inmates.\n\nHow long is the electronic mail saved?\n\nSmart Communications maintains electronic copies for 45 days.\n\nWhat happens if official documents are included in my mail sent to Smart Communications, such as drivers' license, social security cards, checks, court orders with raised seals, etc.?\n\nSmart Communications will forward all official documents to the SCI business office where the inmate is located.\n\nCan general incoming correspondence sent to Smart Communications be returned to the sender once its' been processed?\n\nNo. All general incoming correspondence will be destroyed after the 45-day retention unless otherwise instructed by DOC.\n\nHow will the senders of mail know when the mail is delivered?\n\nSenders of mail who register with Smart Communications can receive alerts when mail arrives at Smart Communication and when it is delivered to or rejected by the DOC.\n\nWill the general incoming correspondence mail procedures delay the parole process?\n\nGreen sheets, home plans and other time sensitive matters will not be delayed.\n\nWhere can I get more information about Smart Communications?\n\nThe Smart Communications website is great resource of information regarding their services.\n\nI accidentally sent my mail to the Security Processing Center address and not the Smart Communications address; what will happen to my mail?\n\nAll general incoming correspondence needs to be sent to the DOC’s third-party mail vendor Smart Communications. Mail sent to the Security Processing Center will be processed through to the facility where the inmate is located. Upon arriving at the facility mailroom the mail will be denied and confiscated. Upon this denial if the inmate wishes to appeal they have 15 working days to notify the Facility Manager in writing, in accordance with the DC-ADM 804 Inmate Grievance System policy. If the inmate does not wish to appeal they can forward a cash slip with an addressed envelope to the mailroom within 15 working days from the denial to have the publication mailed out of the facility to friend or family member. Otherwise, the photo book will be destroyed.\n\nI sent mail to an inmate through Smart Communications; however, the inmate never received the mail. What should I do?\n\nYou should reach out to the prison mailroom. Please provide the following information in your email:\n\nThe exact address the mail was sent to\n\nThe return address listed on the envelope\n\nThe inmate’s full name and inmate number\n\nThe mail carrier who delivered the mail\n\nDid the mail contain photos?\n\nDid this mail contain publications or materials which open like a book?\n\nWhat happens to my photographs when they arrive at Smart Communications?\n\nUpon arriving at Smart Communications the mail containing photographs will be opened and scanned into an electronic document. The electronic document will be made available to the facility mailroom for printing. The mail containing photographs will then be printed and delivered to the inmate by the facility mailroom. The original mail containing photographs will be securely stored for 45 days. At the end of this 45 day period the photos will be securely destroyed.\n\nCan photographs sent to Smart Communications be returned to the sender once its' been processed?\n\nNo. All general incoming correspondence and photographs will be destroyed after the 45-day retention unless otherwise instructed by DOC.\n\nWhat type of paper will photos be printed on?\n\nStandard 8 ½ by 11 copy paper. Photos will be printed in color.\n\nWill photographs from outside vendors like FreePrints or ShutterFly be permitted?\n\nYes. Photos from outside vendors are permitted. Photo orders from outside vendors are also limited to 25 photos per mailing and all photo orders must be sent to the Smart Communications address. The DOC recommends using the following address format for photos that are ordered from an outside vendor:\n\nInmate Name, Inmate Number\n\nPO Box 33028\n\nSt Petersburg, Florida 33733\n\nWhy is the address for photographs from outside vendors different from photographs sent from a home address?\n\nThe DOC experiences a lot of issues with the way outside photo vendors print their address labels. Although the person ordering the publication enters the full and correct address information photo vendors frequently cut the inmates name/inmate number out of the label. Photo vendors do this because they have a character restraint for their address label. Smart Communications is unable to process a mailing that does not have the inmates name and number on it. To ensure your photos ordered from outside vendors are accepted, please use the abbreviated form of the Smart Communications address listed above.\n\nWhat happens if I send a mailing which contains more than 25 photographs?\n\nPhotographs are limited to 25 per mailing. Any mailing containing more than 25 photos will be denied in its entirety by the facility mailroom. Upon this denial if the inmate wishes to appeal they have 15 working days to notify the Facility Manager in writing, in accordance with the DC-ADM 804 Inmate Grievance System policy.

Otherwise, the photo book will be destroyed.\n\nWhat happens if my photographs are denied because of content?\n\nAt the facility, each photo will be inspected to ensure the photos comply with DOC policy – specifically, photographs containing obscenity, explicit sexual material or nudity, as outlined in Section 2 of the DC-ADM 803 Inmate Mail and Incoming Publications are prohibited. If a mailing contains at least one prohibited photo, the entire mailing will be denied. Upon this denial if the inmate wishes to appeal they have 15 working days to notify the Facility Manager in writing, in accordance with the DC-ADM 804 Inmate Grievance System policy.
