        "text": "In 2020, Brookes releases the anticipated third editions of the Speech to Print textbook and workbook—two highly respected and widely used resources on delivering explicit, high-quality literacy instruction. Created by top expert Louisa Cook Moats (in collaboration with seasoned educator Bruce Rosow on the workbook), these teacher-prep essentials offer accurate, up-to-date, and accessible information on the structure and function of language and the “how” of assessment and instruction.\n\nIn spring 2019, Brookes releases the eighth edition of Children with Disabilities, the authoritative textbook from senior editor Mark Batshaw, M.D. and colleagues. Trusted for four decades by university faculty and professionals from diverse fields, Children with Disabilities is the gold-standard text on working effectively with children and families. The new edition includes comprehensive coverage of contemporary issues, the latest evidence-based practices, and contributions from a who’s who of today’s leading experts.\n\nBrookes continues to lead the way as the publisher of authoritative, progressive voices in the field of inclusive education. Pioneering expert Cheryl Jorgensen—already a two-time Brookes author—takes authentic inclusion to the next level with her guidebook It’s More than “Just Being In.” And exciting new author Nicole Eredics turns her years of classroom expertise into real-world strategies in Inclusion in Action.\n\nASQ®, the trusted screener from renowned experts Jane Squires & Diane Bricker, turns 20! We have lots to celebrate: ASQ is in its third edition, and the social-emotional screener ASQ®:SE is in its second. Thousands of programs in all 50 states have used ASQ to check children’s development and help families celebrate milestones. And new products—from learning activities to new translations—keep the ASQ family growing all the time!\n\nFirst unveiled in a 2003 Young Children article, The Pyramid Model uses three levels of support (universal, targeted, and individualized) to promote social-emotional competence in young children. Brookes leads the way in publishing books and tools on this evidence-based model, including the Preschool-Wide Evaluation Tool™ (PreSET™), the Teaching Pyramid Observation Tool (TPOT™), and The Teaching Pyramid Infant‑Toddler Observation Scale (TPITOS). We also partner with the Pyramid Model Consortium (PMC) to expand access to the model for educators across the country.\n\nASQ Online debuts, offering online questionnaire completion and data management to the thousands of ASQ users across the country and around the world. ASQ Family Access allows par¬ents to fill out questionnaires quickly and accurately on a computer, tablet, or smartphone, and ASQ Pro and ASQ Enterprise give programs access to automated scoring, easy reporting, and more ways to communicate with families.\n\nExpanding our focus on social-emotional development, we partner with a team of educational and mental health experts (led by Kenneth Merrell) to bring teachers the Strong Kids curricula for preK through Grade 12 (now in their second editions). These engaging, age-appropriate curricula help students learn about emotions and develop critical social-emotional skills, from managing anger to reducing stress.\n\nOur new professional development program launches, connecting the developers behind key Brookes resources with the professionals who use them. Brookes On Location brings the experts right to you for hands-on, customized seminars that meet your learning needs. As of 2018, we offer eighteen BOL seminars on some of our most trusted early childhood tools.\n\nTwo important new preschool inclusion resources give early childhood educators real-world strategies for meeting the needs of diverse learners. Sandall & Schwartz’s practical guidebook, Building Blocks for Teaching Preschoolers with Special Needs, makes evidence-based inclusion practices accessible for preschool teachers. And with Blended Practices for Teaching Young Children in Inclusive Settings by Grisham-Brown et al., teachers discover how to blend the best of special education and general education so all children can learn. Both books are in new editions and continue to shape inclusive practices in early childhood.\n\nAs social-emotional competence is recognized as integral to success in school and life, ASQ developers Squires & Bricker give the field a powerful new tool: a screener with a deep, exclusive focus on social-emotional behaviors. With ASQ:SE, programs now have an easy way to find young children at risk for social or emotional difficulties, recognize behaviors of concern to caregivers, and identify any need for further assessment. The new edition, ASQ®:SE-2, expands the age range and makes family engagement easier than ever.\n\nBrookes moves the field forward with seminal titles from renowned autism experts, including Amy Wetherby (CSBS and Autism Spectrum Disorders), Barry Prizant (SCERTS), Kathleen Quill (DO-WATCH-LISTEN-SAY, now in a second edition) and Robert & Lynn Koegel (look for the new edition of their breakthrough 2005 guide, Pivotal Response Treatments for Autism). And Paula Kluth’s practical, teacher-friendly guidebooks paved the way for full inclusion of learners with autism.\n\nAs a reading revolution takes shape, we prepare current and future reading teachers with practical guides (like\n\nMarilyn Adams’ Phonemic Awareness in Young Children) and textbooks (like Louisa Moats’ Speech to Print and Marcia Henry’s Unlocking Literacy). When a 2000 report from the National Reading Panel reshapes our understanding of how to teach children to read, we publish a book that takes an in-depth look at the findings: McCardle’s The Voice of Evidence in Reading Research.\n\nThe product of decades of research by Jane Squires, Diane Bricker, and their colleagues, ASQ® answers the need for an affordable, reliable, way to screen children in the critical early years and identify potential delays. This trailblazing screener is the first to have parents complete the questionnaires—which makes results more accurate and makes screening more efficient and economical.\n\nToday, ASQ is the most widely used and respected developmental screener in the world. More than a million questionnaires are completed every year, and the third edition, ASQ®-3, has been translated into more than 30 languages. New ASQ products have addressed users’ evolving needs, including ASQ Online and the dedicated social-emotional screener ASQ®:SE-2.\n\nIn the landmark study published in their book Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children, Betty Hart & Todd Risley recorded parent-child spoken interactions in 42 families. They discovered that some children heard 30 million fewer words by their fourth birthdays than others—and that this “word gap” has long-term effects on later child outcomes. Meaningful Differences has had a huge impact in the twenty years since Brookes published it, prompting followup studies on the word gap and major projects like the Thirty Million Words® Initiative.\n\nDiane Bricker & Jane Squires develop AEPS® in response to the federal call for curricula to improve the skills of children with disabilities. Much more than just a measurement tool, the innovative AEPS links assessment, intervention, and evaluation to ensure better outcomes for children from birth to six years. It’s the first linked system to advance the idea that assessment is not the end goal—real progress is. (The third edition of AEPS is in production now; stay tuned for updates!)\n\nAs the field of early intervention evolves, so does the belief that interventions should be real activities with relevance to children’s lives. Teaming with experts like Diane Bricker, Kristi Pretti-Frontczak, and JoAnn (JJ) Johnson, we publish new titles on activity-based intervention—weaving intervention efforts into the playtimes and routines of children and their families. Key titles include Bricker et al.’s An Activity-Based Approach to Early Intervention and Squires & Bricker’s An Activity-Based Approach to Developing Young Children’s Social Emotional Competence.\n\nIn the last decade of the twentieth century, we set the stage for the future of inclusive education by launching some of our most enduring textbooks for teachers. Widely adopted texts include Orelove et al.’s Educating Students with Severe and Multiple Disabilities, Wehman’s Life Beyond the Classroom, Downing et al.’s Including Students with Severe and Multiple Disabilities in Typical Classrooms, and Wehmeyer’s A Comprehensive Guide to Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\n\nLed by Mark Fey and Alan Kamhi and featuring luminaries like Steven Warren and Joe Reichle, our CLI textbooks bring future SLPs state-of-the art research and guidance on communication and language intervention.\n\nOur SLP textbook offerings expand in the decades to come; key titles include Miller et al.’s Communication Development in Children with Down Syndrome, McCauley et al.’s Treatment of Language Disorders in Children, and Paul’s Introduction to Clinical Methods in Communication Disorders (now in its third edition).\n\nStarting with the hugely popular guide Steps to Independence, we publish some of the most respected and beloved books for families of children with disabilities. Thousands of parents rely on Brookes books like Turnbull & Turnbull’s Disability and the Family and Pueschel’s A Parent’s Guide to Down Syndrome. We continue the tradition today, with warm and wise guidebooks like Naseef’s Autism in the Family.\n\nIn 1986, the new law PL 99-457 establishes Part C and mandates Part B, Section 619 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This legislation creates the Infant and Toddlers with Disabilities Program, provides new funding for children with disabilities from birth through age two, and incentivizes states to make services available at age three years.\n\nTo help professionals working in the emerging field of early intervention, we publish groundbreaking curricula like the Carolina Curriculum, AEPS®, and the play-based TPBA/I, plus influential early books like Guralnick’s Effectiveness of Early Intervention and Odom & Karnes’s Early Intervention for Infants and Children with Handicaps. We work with forward-thinking experts focused on authentic assessment in natural environments.\n\nWe establish ourselves as one of the only publishers to meet the learning needs of professionals preparing to work with children and adults with disabilities. Early bestsellers include Sailor et al.’s Methods of Instruction for Severely Handicapped Students, Horner et al.’s Education of Learners with Severe Handicaps, Evans & Meyer’s An Educative Approach to Behavior Problems, Batshaw et al.’s Children with Disabilities, and Ford et al.’s Syracuse Curriculum guide. Some of these books have had tremendous staying power—the Syracuse Curriculum influenced the education of children with disabilities for decades, and Children with Disabilities is now in its seventh edition!\n\nBrookes Publishing makes our official debut with Bender & Bender’s Disadvantaged Preschool Children: A Source Book for Teachers. We’re one of the first publishers to develop books that prepare teachers and other professionals to work effectively with children with disabilities.\n\nAnother key early title— Burgdorf’s The Legal Rights of Handicapped Persons—makes a 1,100-page legal casebook affordable to special educators, empowering them to advocate for the students and families they serve."
