        "text": "Ten years ago, you never would have dreamed of getting your book traditionally published without an agent. But these days, the sky's the limit for authors.\n\nThe pros and cons of traditional vs. self-publishing have been hashed out a number of times.\n\nSo you know even though there are plenty of pros to self-publishing a book, there’s something validating about writing a book that’s so good a publishing company wants to claim and sell it as one of their own. Maybe you’re one of the many writers who'd like to have a book published through the traditional route, or you're looking to branch out and try it alongside independent publishing.\n\nYou’re not alone.\n\nIf you’ve ever considered seeking publishing companies to take a look at one of your books, you could find a literary agent, or there are plenty of legitimate publishing companies that accept proposals from authors without agents too!\n\nWho knew?\n\nCaveat: As you all know, I've never traditionally published. So I want to be upfront and let you know that the below is purely research-based and does not imply that I have used the below publishers. You can search for publishers and agents on websites like QueryTracker.net, WritersMarket.com, or PublishersArchive.com.\n\nWhy Am I Qualified to Talk about Publishing Companies?\n\nLet's face it, there are many people out there that write these kind of articles by just doing some research on what others say, and regurgitating it out without firsthand knowledge of the tools in question (or worse, have AI write it for them). That's not the case here.\n\nAs someone who's been publishing books for over 13 years, I've seen a lot companies come and go (most of them scams). There's always the big companies which everyone knows about, but those are hard to get your foot in the door, and there are a lot of smaller options as well.\n\nHowever, choosing the right publishing company isn't just about picking the most popular one. It's about finding a good match.\n\nSo, in order to create a top-notch overview of the best publishing companies out there, I sent out surveys to my readers, and talked to some heavy-hitting authors in the industry – many of which I have been a consultant to as well.\n\nBased on my observations, the results from those surveys, and talking with some of the most well-known authors out there, I feel very strongly that this is a subject I can truly tackle.\n\nSo, with that, let's jump into a list of what I think are the best proofreading tools for authors.\n\nTraditional Publishing & Literary Agents–What’s The Deal?\n\nWhen you think of traditional publishers, the Big 5 might be your first thought:\n\nHachette Book Group\n\nHarperCollins\n\nMacmillan Publishers\n\nPenguin Random House\n\nSimon and Schuster\n\nIf youre shooting for the Big 5 publishers, I've learned they're the apex of publishing prestige, but incredibly selective. They only consider works submitted through agents. For writers like me and you, our writing must be exceptional and fit popular genres. Nonfiction authors need a unique angle, marketable ideas, and a solid platform.\n\nI found the key step is finding an agent who's passionate about my book. A great agent not only improves the manuscript but also tirelessly hunts for the best deal. They act as a business manager, connecting with editors and handling contract negotiations. It's a tough journey, so brace yourself for hard work and dedication.\n\nThe Cons of Using an Agent\n\nIn my experience, finding the right agent involves extensive research to avoid scammers or amateurs. Once you find a legitimate agent who loves your book, remember, a publishing deal isn't guaranteed. Agents, like authors, face many rejections before landing a publisher.\n\nKeep in mind, agents take a 15% cut from your book sales. If you're open to alternatives, consider publishing without an agent. Many reputable medium and small publishers now accept direct submissions, bypassing the need for an agent. This trend is growing, with even larger publishers occasionally opening direct submission periods to discover new authors.\n\nAlthough small publishing houses don't have the same clout with retailers or the same resources for marketing and publicity, most still have talented editors, designers, and passionate professionals for publishing great books.\n\nOne of the book publishing companies on my list is even an imprint of Penguin Random House, and yes, they accept contacts from authors directly. Plus, here's an example of a brand new author who got a contract with Baen Books, another publisher on my list, and his novel has great reviews on Amazon.\n\nPublishers To Consider (Even If You're a New Author)\n\nBelow is a list of 19 book publishing companies that authors can contact directly. For each publishing house, you'll find:\n\nA link to their website\n\nWhat they publish\n\nAny significant notes about their publishing history\n\nA link to their submissions guidelines for authors\n\nWhether they accept proposals via snail mail, electronically, or both\n\nThe estimated response time (if it was given on their site)\n\nA link to their catalog of previously published books, and\n\nLocation of the publisher\n\nWhen you find one that sounds interesting or like it might be a fit for your goals as an author, bookmark it. This could bring you one step closer to becoming a (traditionally) published author.\n\nNote: Be sure to check each of the publishing companies' websites and submission requirements carefully. You'll make a great first impression by applying only to those publishing houses that carry books like yours.\n\nHow to Find Other Publishing Companies\n\nOne of the best ways to find successful publishing companies is to analyze the genre for your book and see what other companies are publishing books in that genre.\n\nIf you're doing this manually, this can take a very long time, and you'll end up finding a lot of other companies that aren't really great.\n\nThankfully, there's a tool that makes it easy to see all of the major publishers for the bestsellers of any genre.\n\nThat tool is Publisher Rocket.\n\nWith Rocket's category analysis tool, you can easily find a list of publishers for any genre by doing the following:\n\nFinding your desired category/genre through the Category Search\n\nClicking on the “Insights” link\n\nHover over the “i” icon under the Large Publisher tile\n\nFind a list of large publishers in that genre\n\nA lot of these publishing companies will be traditional publishers, so you can reach out to them if you want a traditional publishing deal. Or you might find some hidden gems, like lesser known but successful small publishers.\n\nCheck Out Publisher Rocket Here\n\nFormatting Has Never Been Easier\n\nWrite and format professional books with ease.

If they say strongly prefer electronic submissions, give yourself a bonus point and submit your materials electronically.\n\nDo not send your full manuscript unless they explicitly ask for it in their submission guidelines, or after they’ve expressed interested in your query letter.\n\n[clickToTweet tweet=”#GetPublished Rule #1: Follow the stinkin' guidelines!” quote=”#GetPublished Rule #1: Follow the stinkin' guidelines!”]\n\nWrite an amazing query letter. This is like the cover letter you write when you’re applying for job, hoping for an interview. You need to write your best pitch to sell your book in a one-page letter, hoping the editor or agent picks your book to “interview” further.\n\nMany publishers also request a synopsis or a brief summary of your entire story. Sample chapters are another common request for publishing companies. Most guidelines specify if they want one, two, or your first five. Give them what they ask for.\n\nNonfiction authors need to write a killer book proposal to show your book idea will sell, and that you have the credibility to give the advice. Among other things, your book proposal will include a detailed analysis of similar books already on the market, how your book is different, who will buy the book (your target audience), and why they need it, your author bio, a detailed chapter-by-chapter outline, and sample chapters. You’ll want to spend a fair amount of time researching and preparing your book proposal, which will probably end up being between 10 and 25 pages long.\n\nUltimately, send them quality work of what they ask for — nothing more, nothing less.\n\nBe Professional and Polite\n\nIn all of your interactions as an author, you’ll be noticed for being polite and professional. In your letters, emails, social media, phone calls, and in-person conversations, show courtesy and professionalism and people will be more likely to want to do business with you.\n\nIf you come across as rude and unprofessional, people are not going to want to work with you. Editors receive an unbelievable number of submissions every month, so be patient and humble as you’re pursuing a publisher.\n\nBuild Connections\n\nGood old fashioned one-on-one networking with people who work at publishing companies is another way to increase your chances of getting your foot in the door.\n\nPublishers are more likely to at least carefully consider queries from someone they recognize, so bust out of your comfort zone and introduce yourself to people at conferences and summits. You never know where a connection may lead.\n\nMake It Your Best Work\n\nThis is another “should go without saying,” but before you start pitching editors or agents, make sure your work is your best work. This goes for your manuscript as well as all of your submission materials. Read them out loud. Have someone else edit them. This is part of being professional. Don’t waste the publisher's time or yours by submitting sloppy materials.\n\nBe Open to Feedback\n\nAnother tough one for some authors is being open to feedback. If your editor, your agent, and your beta readers give you feedback, have an open mind to it. Consider their point of view and seek more opinions or information if you’re unsure.\n\nYou probably won’t follow every piece of advice given (sometimes they're contradictory), but often I and other authors are so blind to our passionate work that we miss the flashing red lights only outsiders can see. Tweak what’s necessary to create a more compelling book.\n\nBuild Your Author Platform\n\nFinally, and this is especially important for nonfiction authors but doesn’t hurt for fiction authors either, build your author platform.\n\nDesign a professional author website that showcases your previous work if you have any and have your social media author accounts ready to go.\n\nShowing the publishing companies that you have established a place in the world as an author by building a big email list will certainly help. This sends the message that you’ll be more like a partner to them in marketing your book — something they’ll love to see.\n\nAn Important Note About Vanity Presses\n\nApart from the 30 publishing companies on this list, not every company out there has your best interests at heart. Much like in the indie world, there are people out there who are more than happy to use you as a means of earning themselves money. Vanity presses are publishing companies that charge you a fee to publish your book, and do nothing to market it or professionally edit it. Be wary of any company that wants you to pay them to publish your story. If this happens, run for the hills.\n\nIf you're unsure of the difference between legitimate publishing houses and these ‘vanity presses,' check out this helpful guide that will clear things up for you.\n\nGet After It\n\nIf the prestige, validation, greater potential of having your very own book on bookstore shelves, and the potential for literary awards is exciting to you, then researching and contacting publishing houses that seem the best fit for your writing may now be on your to-do list.\n\nIf reading about these publishing companies is exciting to you, or you've always known getting a publishing contract would mean the world to you, then why not go after it?\n\nOne thing I do know is if you never try, you’ll never know.\n\nSide note: if you're interested, I also have an article to help you find the best self-publishing company here.\n\nAnd as you’ve learned, you don’t even have to have an agent. You'll probably get a rejection or five, but don't get discouraged. There are plenty of legitimate book publishing companies out there just waiting to find the next talented author.\n\nWhy not you?\n\nCheers,"
