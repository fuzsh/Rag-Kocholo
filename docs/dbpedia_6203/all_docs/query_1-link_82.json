        "text": "Now Linked to 419 Timelines!\n\nAppended August 16, 2022.\n\nTelevision  Movies  Books  Games  Comics\n\nLibrary  Canadian Library\n\nShare on Facebook  Share on Pinterest  Share on Twitter\n\nHistory is a fascinating subject. There is an almost irresistible draw to look at the bigger picture, the overall course of events, in an attempt to glean some insight or approach some greater knowledge.\n\nPeering into the real past is fine, and in fact I enjoy doing so quite often, but it takes a certain amount of panache to hold an interest in fictional history. Gleaning knowledge from a past that never existed--or a future, for that matter--is simply so much more sublime. That is what this site is all about.\n\nBelow, you will find links to many online chronologies, timelines, and histories (including a few which I myself have had a hand in creating), and in cases where I am familiar with the subject matter, I have added my own commentary beside the link. They are divided into five media categories:\n\nTelevision (130 Timelines) Movies (46 Timelines) Books (109 Timelines) Games (43 Timelines) Comics (91 Timelines)\n\nMost importantly, every one of these links is to a history that never happened. There are only references to actual historical events insofar as they fit into the context of the timeline at hand. Thus, the purity of this pursuit is maintained.\n\nResearch is an ongoing project here. Each category mentions a number of general and specific requests for information that are still pending, and the only order the timelines are listed in is roughly by how detailed they are. Feel free to contact me if you can help add to the archives, or if you have a request of your own.\n\nWhen you're done perusing the fictional history on this site, you can also check out the The Rocklopedia Fakebandica (for fictional musicology).\n\nOn another note, you may also wish to take a look at my personal homepage, or look for me on LiveJournal (yes, still!) and Twitter, where I should be tracking further developments here for those of you who want to keep up with what happens next.\n\nFinally, this site is dedicated to all the other historians of things that never were, those devoted people who are responsible for putting fictional history on the Internet for all to enjoy. May your quests be fruitful.\n\n--Edgar Governo, Historian of Things That Never Were\n\nTelevision\n\nBy its very nature, television provides a rich resource for the development of timelines. Many series rely heavily on their continuity, now more so than ever. Fans of various shows have taken it upon themselves to trace their internal history, and a heavy emphasis can be seen here on genre series.\n\nStar Trek\n\nStar Trek is the quintessential series for pseudohistorical debate. Despite five decades of canonical material, there is still much disagreement, mostly due to the fact that The Original Series never bothered to tell us when it was set.\n\nMy own Star Trek Chronology, Beta Version is available at this site, including dates for every story I could place as well as important events in the history of the Star Trek Universe--though there have been far more stories (canonical and otherwise) with their own interpretations since its last update. Yes, it disagrees with the Okudas. No, there aren't full and complete explanations of my dates. That's why it's a beta version.\n\nAs a complement to that work, I also offer the other side of the coin (so to speak) in the more regularly updated Star Trek: The Mirror Universe Chronology.\n\nCurt Danhauser has written a number of specialised Star Trek timelines in the same format as the Okudas' Star Trek Chronology (Curt did some of the Additional Research for the Okudas' own Star Trek Encyclopedia, Second Edition):\n\nThe Animated Star Trek Timeline, understandably, deals only with The Animated Series.\n\nThe Star Trek: Excelsior Timeline covers the series that could've been.\n\nYou can also find the Star Trek: New Frontier Chronology, covering Peter David's series of novels.\n\nFinally, there is an Early Star Trek Novels Timeline, covering the series of novels published by Bantam Books.\n\nCarolyn Winifred has put together a Star Trek Timeline Continuation, named as such because it expands on the timeline included in Voyages of the Imagination: The Star Trek Fiction Companion, by Jeff Ayers, with information on more recently published works in the franchise. It's also the only Star Trek timeline I know of which includes a placement for my own short story, \"You Are Not in Space,\" from Strange New Worlds 10.\n\nJeffrey Harlan's FedNet Chronology is one of the most exhaustive Star Trek timelines available on the Internet, given how many different sources it uses, but its last listed update was in October 2004.\n\nThe Star Trek Annotated Timeline, by Win Scott Eckert, also tries to be as inclusive as possible, though it is only available as a very large PDF file at this time, and its last listed update was in September 2003.\n\nConversely, the Timeline of the Star Trek Universe compiled by I. Marc Carlson sticks mostly to onscreen sources and reference books closely connected to the series; its last listed update was in January 2005.\n\nMark Weller's Star Trek Timeline Home Page initially focussed on events seen or referred to in Star Trek: Enterprise, but all of the franchise's aired material to date has been added over time. However, its last listed update was in February 2005.\n\nMichael Marek compiled years of research into his version of The History of Star Trek, with special emphasis on Earth and Starfleet-related activities.\n\nThe Chronology Of Written Star Trek Fiction, compiled by Geoff Trowbridge, refers exclusively to events narrated in published Star Trek fiction, treating the franchise as if it existed only in book form. This chronology also contradicts what Geoff calls \"the Okudachron,\" and its last listed update was in January 2006.\n\nA Star Trek Novel Timeline, by Andrew Timson, takes a similar approach, concentrating on making as many of the books work together as possible while acknowledging that some of their continuity issues are irreconcilable.\n\nDavid Young's Star Trek Chronological Reading Project, by contrast, takes a more personal approach, as he is endeavouring to read every printed Star Trek work by the order in which they occur, while offering his own thoughts on the various continuity issues that arise in doing this. As of January 2007, he was about halfway through the 23rd century.\n\nJames Dixon researched and compiled his own Star Trek chronology in contradiction to the Okudas, and the best way to look at his work by far is Kevin Atkinson's adaptation, known as the Fandom Star Trek Chronology. With this searchable version, you can control exactly what sources are included and exclude sources you think are questionable (like, say, \"Tech Fandom\"); look at a specific time or person; and search the database for occurrences of a particular word string.\n\nThere is also a somewhat more updated version of the same timeline (the last one known to be available), which comes packaged as a very large ZIP file, as well as a simple HTML version called the James Dixon Timeline, though the latter has not been updated since May 1994.\n\nThe Christopher Pike Timeline, by S. C. Mollmann, gathers together all available information on Captain Pike and his crew, particularly Pike's two five-year missions aboard the USS Enterprise.\n\nDavid Henderson's Enterprise Chronology, as the name implies, draws its information from Star Trek: Enterprise episodes, novels, and short stories, but it has not been updated since early in Enterprise's fourth season.\n\nDoctor Who\n\nDoctor Who, as involved with time as it is, provides any number of difficulties for historians of things that never were, and only the most intrepid dare to try unravelling all of the series' contradictions. If you thought Star Trek was inconsistent...\n\nWho's Doctor Who?: A Biography of The Doctor is a site tackling the task of chronicling the Doctor's life in the order the Doctor himself perceived it, begun by the late historian of things that never were, Allen Robinson, and now being offered up and maintained by Louise Lobinske. The site sticks to television continuity and is only halfway through the Fourth Doctor at present, but don't be fooled by the introductory description of the series itself--this work is quite fictional.\n\nStephen Gray has his own take on A History of the Whoniverse, spanning from Event 1 to the End of Time. In his words, \"it's always useful to have a second opinion.\"\n\nA general Doctor Who Chronology by Doug A. Scott is available, though compiling a linear Doctor Who history is almost a contradiction in terms.\n\nThe History of the Time Lords, by William B. Swift, attempts to sort out the extremely convoluted history of Gallifrey, using every source of canon possible. It's difficult to follow, even for someone fairly familiar with Doctor Who, and its colour code sometimes proves more confusing than clarifying, but it is extremely thorough.\n\nWilliam has an even more specialised timeline analysing The History of the Daleks, though it is difficult to follow for the same reasons as his other work.\n\nBACK! Another specialised look at Doctor Who continuity is the Cybermen Timeline, by Chris Schuetz, which includes the television series and audio dramas along with some conjectures meant to \"smooth out\" inconsistencies between the various stories in which they appear.\n\nHighlander\n\nHighlander, by definition, is the story of those who live and travel through the centuries, leading many different lives...which are apparently difficult to sort out at times. The consensus amongst its fans seems to be that there can be more than one timeline.\n\nA near-complete look at the life of Duncan MacLeod can be gained in reading Duncan's Timeline, by Nick Peers, which has information through Highlander: Endgame, as well as offering up some real-life historical events for each period covered.\n\nBy contrast, the Series Flashback Timeline, Version 2.57, by Velia Tanner and Julie Beamer (part of the Highlander FAQ), partially overlaps the above work, and it is only complete up to \"Till Death.\"\n\nFor an alternate look at the history of Duncan MacLeod, Paul Edmonds presents Four Hundred Years of the Highlander. Written in narrative form, with pictures, and not as detailed as the above approach, this also includes a number of disagreements on when certain events actually occurred.\n\nThe rise (and fall) of Highlander: The Raven has also given rise to a number of timelines covering the rather sketchy life of Amanda, its central character. The first version of Amanda's Timeline is the most \"complete,\" which just serves to show how little is known about her adventures.\n\nPaul Edmonds's account, A Thousand Years of Amanda, is similar in format to his treatment of Duncan's life.\n\nDuncan and Amanda are hardly the only foci for fans of the series, and the Immortal sometimes known as Adam Pierson is well represented in the Methos Timeline. What is particularly interesting is that this timeline is written from his point-of-view, cynical comments and all.\n\nI was pleased to discover that there is a Darius Timeline, dedicated to the recurring character played by the late Werner Stocker.\n\nChris Wike has put together a timeline of Ceirdwyn's Life, profiling the Immortal played by Kim Johnston Ulrich in the Highlander episode \"Take Back The Night.\"\n\nThe Timeline of the Highlander Universe compiled by I. Marc Carlson is a catch-all chronology which takes information from the series, the movies, the novels, and even the work of other online historians of things that never were in an attempt to fit it all together in a (somewhat) logical sequence.\n\nBattlestar Galactica\n\nAll this has happened before, and all this will happen again, but no matter which version of Battlestar Galactica and its ragtag fleet you wish to follow through the yahrens (or years, depending on who you're following) of searching for Earth and fighting the Cylons, there'll be those who chronicle how it happened.\n\nMark Weller has compiled an impressive set of Battlestar Galactica Timelines, following every conceivable forking path of continuity. Chief amongst these (in terms of interest for the discerning historian of things that never were) are:\n\nthe Classic Battlestar Galactica Timeline, covering the \"base\" continuity of the original series;\n\nthe Galactica 1980 Timeline, which includes the sequel series as well; and\n\nthe Reimagined Battlestar Galactica Timeline, covering the version of the series now produced by the Sci-Fi Channel.\n\nHowever, Mark goes further in detailing various alternate takes on Colonial history, with each one of the franchise's licencees being granted their own continuity:\n\nthe 1978 Theatrical Release Galactica Timeline, extrapolating how the events of the series might have unfolded given the differences between the television and theatrical versions of \"Saga of a Star World;\"\n\nthe Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming Timeline, covering the continuity that surrounds the theatrical trailer made by Richard Hatch for a proposed continuation of the original series' storyline;\n\nthe Glen A. Larson Galactica Movie Project Timeline, covering Larson's proposed cinematic continuation of the original series;\n\nthe Bryan Singer/Tom DeSanto Battlestar Galactica Timeline, covering their proposed revival which also would've continued on from the original series;\n\nthe Berkley Galactica Timeline, covering the series of novelisations and original novels published by Berkley Books;\n\nRichard Hatch's Battlestar Galactica Novel Timeline, covering the series of novels co-written by Richard Hatch and published by Pocket Books;\n\nthe Marvel Galactica Timeline, covering the stories published by Marvel Comics (whose continuity breaks with that of the series early on);\n\nthe Grandreams Annuals Galactica Timeline, covering the stories included in the comic book annuals published by Grandreams;\n\nthe Maximum Press Comics Battlestar Galactica Timeline, covering the stories by Maximum Press using a timeline published in one of its issues;\n\nthe Realm Press Comics Galactica Timeline, covering the aborted runs of stories published by Realm Press; and\n\nthe Encyclopedia Galactica Timeline, recreating the timeline included in the hardcover of the same name by Bruce Kraus.\n\nI. Marc Carlson has compiled his own Timeline of the Galactica Universe for the reimagined series, but it only covers information from the first two seasons.\n\nMeanwhile, the Battlestar Galactica Colonial Timeline, by Adam C. Stacey, acknowledges that the continuity information available for the original series is fairly scant.\n\nEdward Kirk has pieced together the Classic Battlestar Galactica Season 2 Timeline using a variety of unused scripts, synopses, and other proposed continuations of the series.\n\nRobotech\n\nRobotech fans seem to be quite fond of making timelines of the series, due in large part to some major continuity disagreements between the various forms the story has taken.\n\nFirst and foremost, Mark Dutkiewicz has a number of Robotech Timelines, comparing the original Macross with separate compromised, RPG, and novel timelines for Robotech to see how different they really are.\n\nThe original history is outlined on its own in the Macross Chronology, by Egan Loo, which comes in three different versions as part of his very extensive Macross Compendium.\n\nA shorter Robotech Timeline is available, by Peter Walker and Aubry Thonon, with Pieter Thomassen and Robert Morgenstern, although it contains historical references from their fan fiction.\n\nGundam\n\nThe similarly sprawling Gundam franchise actually has two separate histories: Universal Century, used by the original series, Mobile Suit Gundam, and all related stories; and After Colony, used by Gundam Wing and its spinoffs. As can be seen below, both have been outlined in detail by different historians.\n\nMark Simmons originally compiled both The Universal Century Timeline and The After Colony Timeline for his now-defunct site, The Gundam Project.\n\nAnother Universal Century Timeline, by Ben Koshy, also looks at the whole of that continuity.\n\nBy contrast, the Gundam Timeline: Universal Century only covers those events which took place before Operation Stardust.\n\nOther Television\n\nMy Firefly Timeline (still in progress, even now!) is a thorough guide to the universe within the short-lived series created by Joss Whedon, though I struggled with the relative lack of detailed information to draw from. Ruskaia vercia chronologiya toze prigodna!\n\nJill Arroway has her own take on The Firefly Timeline, which includes some information from fan fiction and comments explicitly on my own work, though some of her assumptions about my assumptions are offbase.\n\nMy Kindred: The Embraced Timeline is far too meticulous in describing an eight-episode series, but no one can ever fault me for lack of attention to detail.\n\nI created the Sex and the City Timeline because I couldn't help but wonder how everything fit together chronologically.\n\nThe X-Files Timeline, by Michael Marek, is a work of art. I couldn't possibly hope to do better on my own. It happens to mention me, too.\n\nAs a result of the (cancelled) spinoff series, Michael has also put together The Lone Gunmen Timeline.\n\nFor another take on the franchise, you can also look at The X-Files Chronology, chronicled by Joe Bongiorno.\n\nFor the sake of argument, I. Marc Carlson has also compiled a Timeline of an X-Files Universe, \"including material from Millennium, Strange Luck, and Lone Gunmen,\" but the timeline has not been updated since 2000.\n\nThe Babylon 5 History Page, maintained by Larry King, not only contains a good chronology of the series by I. Marc Carlson (dealing with discrepancies between different episodes and with the novels), but also lists prophecies, visions, and dreams in the series, as well as a number of other things. Ruskaia vercia chronologiya toze prigodna.\n\nThe Twin Peaks Timeline, compiled by Edwin Nomura, is extremely extensive, containing everything from transcribed scenes to floor diagrams of the Red Room.\n\nSam Hughes was so frustrated when he saw the lack of detail and explanation in some timelines for Futurama that he put together his own \"considerably more exhaustive\" Futurama Timeline. I was just pleasantly surprised to discover that there was actually enough continuity to make such a thing possible.\n\nNick Slicer also wanted to research the matter, leading to his Futurama Chronology.\n\nJym Dyer's take on The Futurama Timeline was likely one of the works to which Sam was reacting.\n\nGood news, everyone! Noah Otters has compiled a Futurama Timeline as well.\n\nThe History of Xena: Warrior Princess, by Michael Martinez, Erica Friedman, and Sam Ash-Glover, brings together the sketchy information about Xena's life into a coherent whole.\n\nMichael Howard has outlined the Historical Background for the Bonanza Television Program. He calls it \"a preliminary effort,\" but it is far from being a quick read.\n\nSpurred on by my own cajoling amongst other things, Chris Wike has put together The Buffy the Vampire Slayer Chronology. He calls it a \"Beta Version,\" but it is far more detailed a work in progress than some of the \"complete\" chronologies out there.\n\nUsing similar methods, Chris has also put together a Kolchak the Night Stalker Timeline.\n\nValerie Meachum and Dorothy Elggren have compiled an in-depth timeline of Forever Knight Flashbacks, including those that didn't actually happen.\n\nThe Life and Timeline of Veronica Mars is a thorough work with very good explanations for the specific dates (and occasional lack of same) within it. One particularly useful feature is a drop-down menu that allows readers to select the last episode they have seen, changing the content of the timeline accordingly.\n\nThe official website for Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda contains A Commonwealth Timeline.\n\nI. Marc Carlson has taken said website as well as information from the show itself and compiled his own Timeline of the Andromeda Universe.\n\nThe Stargate Timeline, written by Paul Cryer, has been placed here, despite the original movie that started it all, because it deals largely with events from the series.\n\nAnother Stargate Timeline, written by Philip Colin Lawrence, deals with similar subject matter, but focusses mostly on events which occurred before the series.\n\nThe Smallville Timeline is a work in progress being compiled by a large group of people, but it is already quite detailed and well-annotated.\n\nA very deadpan Red Dwarf Time Line looks at the internal history of this series, with details up to Series VIII.\n\nThere is also an alternative Red Dwarf Timeline which explicitly diverges from the one listed above.\n\nD. G. Valdron has compiled the Lexx Time Line, complete to the end of Series Three, but with no information from Series Four.\n\nMark Weller, mentioned above in connection to Battlestar Galactica, has also put together a Buck Rogers Timeline devoted to the series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, which had much of the same creative staff.\n\nJoe Rovang has compiled a lengthy Timeline to the Power Rangers Universe that is very detailed (although I get a little lost in the midst of his annotation symbols) and only part of his extremely extensive Writer's Guide to the series. Hey, I can't make this stuff up.\n\nThere is another, up-to-date Power Rangers Timeline available, but it seems somewhat less detailed than the first, and contains no annotations at all.\n\nRachel Dawson has put together yet another Universal Power Rangers Timeline, though it is even less detailed and rather dated at this point, only covering events from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers through Power Rangers: Turbo.\n\nThe massive juggernaut of anime that is Dragonball offers a number of opportunities for pseudohistorical study. The Ultimate Dragonball Z/GT Timeline is detailed and nicely laid out in table form, while two other sites deal with the effects of time travel on the timeline, as part of the Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z FAQ (a good explanation with a simple graphical representation) and as a separate Dragonball Timeline by Paul Chang (with less explanation but a more detailed graphical representation).\n\nThe Centre Timeline and the DSA/Flashback List are complementary guides to the history behind The Pretender, compiled by Ashley Michel and maintained by Perri Smith, with contributions from Patricia A. Swan.\n\nKevin McCorry offers A Space: 1999 Chronology which takes information from every aspect of the series' fandom to create not only a cohesive chronology (no mean feat in itself), but a lot of other details about the Space: 1999 Universe.\n\nBy contrast, Mark Weller has put together his own UFO & Space: 1999 Timeline, apparently based on initial publicity for the latter series placing both in the same continuity.\n\nThe seaQuest Timeline, by Michelle Vincenti, has details on all three seasons of the show plus seaQuest 2047, the online continuation of the series.\n\nThe Planet of the Apes TV Timeline, by Mark Weller, deals only with information from that series (as its name implies), as opposed to the films which inspired it.\n\nThe House, M.D. Timeline currently has information (and excellent annotations) through the end of the series' second season.\n\nThe West Wing Time Line, by B. E. Warne, is in its embryonic stages, as it's labelled a \"tentative possible time line,\" but I'm just grateful for its existence, and I'm sure it will grow quickly.\n\nAnother fictional president is featured in the Jack & Bobby Chronology - A Future History of Bobby McCallister's America, compiled by Steve Sanders, which is surprisingly detailed and well-researched considering how recent the series is.\n\nThe Sentinel Timeline, compiled by Kay Lynne Simpson, is similarly embryonic, but it has a bright and promising future ahead of it.\n\nThe Alias Chronology, by Derek Beebe, has very complete information gleaned from the series' first season, but seemed to stop adding information around the beginning of its third.\n\nThe Lost Timeline, by Ben Sledge, provides dates and events centred around the date of the plane crash which begins the series, as well as offering the ability to filter the timeline itself by character.\n\nThe Equalizer Timeline, with information \"collected by members of the Equalizer Discussion Group,\" is presented in a secretive style appropriate to the tone of the series itself.\n\nNot too many other \"mainstream\" television dramas have had their histories sorted out, as you can see, but Catherine Challenger has compiled a Once and Again Master Timeline.\n\nPaul Dempster has put together a fairly thorough Dawson's Creek Chronology, though it would have a higher place on this list if it had been updated more recently.\n\nA She-Wolf of London Timeline, by A. C. Chapin, has a similar obscurity in its episode divisions, but it is very logically organised around the real lunar cycle.\n\nThe Gargoyles Timeline, by Ed Reynolds, covers events in the Disney animated series.\n\nA different Gargoyles Timeline, by Aris Katsaris, has fewer details on it but makes more of an effort to incorporate canon sources outside of the main series itself.\n\nThe Transformers Time Line, by Seth Seidler, is an attempt to amalgamate the continuity of the comics and the television series, including the events of Beast Wars and Beast Machines.\n\nThe Transformers Chronology, by Jeremy H. Pace, is an older speculative work which does not include the latter television series.\n\nThe Sailor Moon Timeline tries to meld the somewhat disparate continuities of the English and Japanese versions of the show.\n\nThe official website for the sci-fi medical drama Mercy Point contains its own Mercy Point Timeline.\n\nThe Neon Genesis Evangelion Timeline covers events before the anime series itself, which is useful since said series is highly dependent on its backstory.\n\nThe Little House on the Prairie Timeline is a short work that is mostly interesting for its reflections on \"soap opera time.\"\n\nJon Curry has compiled a short but well-reasoned Thunderbirds Timeline.\n\nThe Roswell Timeline, written by Damon Moudry, could definitely stand to be expanded, but it's a great start.\n\nThe Space: Above and Beyond Timeline, compiled by Carol Stoneburner, Gil Trevizo, and Pat 'wu' Moss.\n\nAllen W. Wright has put together The Robin of Sherwood Timeline, which serves to highlight its \"confusing history\" by noting where the series contradicts itself and actual historical events.\n\nThe Captain Power Timeline, by Rebecca Lovett, is a good guide to events in the series itself, and it has an explanation for the uninitiated of the dating system, but it seems a little bare in general.\n\nI'm thrilled to be able to offer a timeline for an entirely different kind of captain from the late 1980's--namely, The Captain N Timeline, written by Mark Moore.\n\nStaying with the late 1980's as a theme, Mark Moore has also put together The Jem Series Timeline, which is rather well-researched.\n\nMaureen S. O'Brien has compiled the Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century Timeline, using the Baring-Gould dating of the original Sherlock Holmes stories and applying it to the animated series.\n\nEven those looking for a Married...with Children timeline are in luck, as Andreas Carl has put together the surprisingly well-researched Bundy Life Timetable.\n\nBarbara Walton's Quantum Leap Timelines consist of a primary backstory timeline paralleled with a secondary timeline, which includes irreconcilable dates (like Al's age) and added history (like Sammy Jo Fuller's birth).\n\nVincent Nucaso has put together a short Rumpole of the Bailey Timeline.\n\nThe Avatar: The Last Airbender Timeline seems to cover only events which occurred before the series.\n\nConversely, the Supernatural Timeline, by Joanna Browning, only covers events which occur during the first three seasons of the series.\n\nBACK! There is a fairly scant Charmed Timeline available, without annotations.\n\nThere is a very basic Pokémon Timeline out there, although most of its dates are unofficial.\n\nMovies\n\nMovies, as detailed as they sometimes are, do not create a world or a history as thoroughly as a television series does. Nevertheless, there are a number of timelines out there already, and doubtless more to come.\n\nStar Wars\n\nStar Wars, of course, has garnered a lot of attention lately. With the many new stories being created in various media, a number of people have taken it upon themselves to lay out the history of a galaxy far, far away.\n\n(N.B. Although there are a multitude of these chronologies online, most of them don't provide much more than very basic information, so I have only included the most detailed ones to come across my path.)\n\nA humble Star Wars Timeline for all your research needs, compiled by my friend Bradley Taylor-Pirogov and I, lacks more recent research of its own and still reflects the older Expanded Universe of the \"Legends\" continuity.\n\nThe Ultimate Star Wars Timeline, by Brian James Crewe, is the \"biggest competition\" in terms of thoroughness, using a somewhat different layout from the timelines above and below. It's popular, accurate, and updated often. Time Tales: A Star Wars Chronology, by Christopher McElroy and Michael Potts, which is on the same server, is also similarly detailed, and includes more illustration than the other timelines listed.\n\nThe Star Wars Timeline Gold, created and compiled by Nathan P. Butler, rivals projects such as Time Tales for thoroughness, with over 1200 pages of documentation.\n\nThe Star Wars Expanded Universe Chronology, created and compiled by Rob Mullin, is something of a companion piece to the above work, because \"for every timeline, there is an equal and opposite chronology.\"\n\nJames McFadden has his own Star Wars Chronology, which also includes thorough references describing how he came up with all of his dates.\n\nOnce Upon a Galaxy: A Day-to-Day Star Wars Timeline, by Eddie van der Heijden, has very detailed annotations, but the fact that it is under construction means that as of February 2007, the timeline has only covered events through the end of the Knights of the Old Republic era, using the 10-month Great ReSynchronization Calendar System devised by West End Games.\n\nMichael K. Beidler's Star Wars Literature Compendium not only contains a very good (if now dated) Literature Timeline, but also a number of supplements dealing with Marvel and West End material, and a good discussion of the \"canon question.\"\n\nMatthew Justice currently maintains The Echo Station Timeline.\n\nThe Star Wars Expanded Universe Timeline, chronicled by Joe Bongiorno, offers yet another interpretation, though its formatting is best suited to monitors with higher resolutions.\n\nOn a more specialised note, Jeff Boivin has put together the Star Wars: Era of Rebellion Timeline, focussing on the period between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nOn an even more specialised note, Lou B. Graziani has compiled a Dark Forces Chronology, which details events related to the series of Star Wars games from LucasArts.\n\nOther Movies\n\nMy Fast & Furious Timeline details the history of that franchise a quarter mile at a time.\n\nThe Indiana Jones Timeline, by Allen Lane, deals with events throughout Indy's life, from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles to his old age. (Allen also told me that it was scheduled to incorporate the Marvel Comics series of adventures and have more detailed entries for the books and movies, but quite a bit of time has gone by without an update.)\n\nWin Eckert has written Raiders of the Lost Timeline: The Indiana Jones Chronology, a sketchier version of the information offered in Allen's timeline.\n\nFritz Baugh has compiled the impressively massive Ghostbusters Omnibus Timeline, containing information from both movies as well as The Real Ghostbusters, Extreme Ghostbusters, and more. The only caveat I would offer is that some of the timeline's entries are derived from fan fiction, but luckily, these entries are clearly indicated.\n\nPeople familiar with Kevin Smith's work should enjoy History Askew: A Chronological Guide to the View Askewniverse, by Brian James Crewe, which covers Smith's first four movies (but not the fifth, unfortunately) as well as other work that fits into his continuity. People familiar with his work should also understand why this is the first timeline link to carry a language warning.\n\nThe Godfather Timeline, by Chris Mikula, Jamie Kushner, Jenna Cowley, Rebecca Lerner, and Scott Waldman, was created as part of a website providing information on The Godfather trilogy for an English course at the University of Michigan. Very cool. The Alien Universe Timeline, by Scott Middlebrook, covers the four Alien movies produced thus far.\n\nThe Alien Expanded Universe Timeline, researched and written by Damon Dellamargio and Scott Middlebrook, attempts to incorporate the novels and comics along with the movies, though it is quick to point out how many contradictions this causes.\n\nEdward Kirk has his own take on Alien/Predator Colonial History, which includes information up to Alien vs Predator and Aliens vs Predator: Requiem, but for some reason leaves out Alien Resurrection.\n\nThe 2001: A Space Odyssey Timeline, by Larry Evans, is part of a larger online exhibit devoted to the movie, coordinated by Dennis Gonzales.\n\nKris Naudus has compiled an Atlantis: The Lost Empire Timeline, providing (as she puts it) \"a history of the Shepherd's Journal.\"\n\nSome of the different continuities for Toho's famous movie monster are covered by era in the Godzilla Shōwa Series Timeline, dealing with the original series of daikaiju eiga from 1954 to 1980; the Godzilla Heisei Series Timeline, dealing with the series of films from 1984 to 1999; and the Godzilla Wold Newton Universe Timeline, which takes a series of Godzilla novels by Marc Cerasini and attempts to fit them into that literary universe. All of these timelines are detailed, but have very dense paragraphs which could stand to be broken up.\n\nThe Mad Max Chronology, by Alex Maddison, is useful not only for the reasoned chronology itself, but for the multitude of links relating to post-apocalyptic stories. The site's location in Australia also adds an air of authenticity.\n\nFans of the Highlander movie series can read The Connor MacLeod Timeline, by Chris Wike, which also points out a number of different inconsistencies between the movie and television continuities.\n\nThe Back to the Future Time Travel Chronology avoids the problems inherent in placing the events of a time-travel movie in \"order\" by taking the subjective view of the DeLorean itself.\n\nA Chronological History of The Planet of the Apes, by Mario Silva and Luis E. Fonseca. Need I say more?\n\nDayton Ward created Planet of the Apes: An Annotated Chronology for inclusion in The Planet of the Apes Chronicles. The portion included online covers the period from the earliest known events of the timeline up until the time most closely corresponding with the present day.\n\nEdward Kirk's Planet of the Apes Chronology, by contrast, deals with the continuity created by Tim Burton's film.\n\nThe official website of The Blair Witch Project includes A Timeline of Major Events in the History of the Blair Witch.\n\nThe Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension This timeline for the seminal cult film, compiled by Sean Murphy and Chris Wike, is part of their Buckaroo Banzai FAQ.\n\nThe Spinal Tap Timeline by Chip Rowe definitely blurs the line between real and fictional history.\n\nThe Puppet Master Timeline is actually comprehensive enough to help make (some) sense of the continuity in the Puppet Master franchise.\n\nFriday the 13th: The Timeline Yes, even this movie series can be the subject of pseudohistorical study, as this surprisingly rational timeline proves.\n\nFor a different interpretation, there is another Friday the 13th Timeline available, by Blake Washer and Brenna O'Brien, with information up to Freddy vs Jason.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald has yet another take on Friday the 13th: The Timeline.\n\nSimilarly, The Freddy Krueger Timeline examines the history within the Nightmare on Elm Street series, with information up to Freddy vs Jason.\n\nNot to be left out, the history of Michael Myers is examined in The Halloween Timeline, by Brian Fitzgerald, with information up to Halloween H20.\n\nThe Mummy Chronology, by Edward Kirk, includes material from the current film series and its spinoffs, with information up to Tomb of the Dragon Emperor and The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior.\n\nEdward Kirk has also put together the Judge Dredd Movie Timeline, based on the continuity established in the film as opposed to the comics.\n\nSimilarly, Edward compiled the Lost In Space Movie Timeline based on the continuity established in that film as opposed to the television series.\n\nThe Primer Timeline attempts to make sense of the many time-travel shenanigans going on in that movie...to the extent that that's possible, at any rate.\n\nAlthough the Ferris Bueller Timeline Problem, by Joshua L. Moss, is not a timeline per se, it does demonstrate all the best qualities of analysis in an historian of things that never were, so I included it here anyway.\n\nBooks\n\nAuthors often place multiple stories or novels in the same universe, both for convenience and for the opportunity to create a more complex setting, and some people online have been brave enough to take on the more tedious task of sorting out the internal histories of such book series.\n\nAt the outset, I realise that this section is the farthest from being complete. I have no doubt missed any number of very good timelines, so any help would be much appreciated.\n\nFor a while now, I've noticed that this section (and all the sections, really) are very science-fiction related. I understand that fantasy and sci-fi create more alternate universes than soi-disant \"conventional\" fiction, but there are any number of works that would benefit from the creation of timelines.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\n\"I much prefer history, true or feigned,\" wrote J.R.R. Tolkien, and indeed, his Middle-earth has been expounded upon in so many ways that it is arguably the most seriously studied fictional history in the annals of literature. As such, it is no surprise that several timelines relating to that realm are available online.\n\nStephen Geard has compiled A History and Complete Chronology of Númenor.\n\nAlberto Monteiro's Tolkien Page features a complex and multi-faceted timeline which incorporates Stephen's work, although it isn't as comprehensive as the one above.\n\nJoe Bongiorno has compiled A Chronology of Middle-Earth which endeavours to be as inclusive as possible.\n\nThe Wheel of Time\n\nRobert Jordan's Wheel of Time saga has a huge following and an intricate storyline. Amongst the intense discussions between its fans about every aspect of this series are a number of attempts to set out its varied history in understandable terms.\n\nSeven Spokes: A Wheel of Time Chronology, by Robert Oliver, is the first such study, although it is in fact much more than that. It explains the calendar system used in the books and includes other information about the characters and setting that Robert Jordan has created.\n\nSteven Cooper offers Tellings of the Wheel: The Chronology of The Wheel of Time, which attempts to arrange all of the events in the series into a consistent chronology, presented in table form.\n\nThe third related pseudohistory to look at is actually a set of separate but sequential Wheel of Time Timelines by Emma Pease, which she warns is still rough and incomplete.\n\nCthulhu Mythos\n\nThe journey into ultimate terror that is H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos carries with it the unique terrors inherent in trying to precisely date the actions of dark cosmic forces...\n\nAlberto Monteiro has converted the Lovecraftian Timeline from the alt.horror.cthulhu FAQ to HTML.\n\nThe Cthulhu Mythos Timeline, by Dru Smith, Donovan Loucks, and Daniel Harms, is somewhat more detailed than the above timeline, but it was also derived from the alt.horror.cthulhu FAQ, as it is part of The Official Cthulhu Mythos FAQ, a spinoff of sorts from the original.\n\nComparative pseudohistory is always a good idea, so you can also take a look at When The Stars Are Right: A Timeline of the Cthulhu Mythos, by Jim Hawley.\n\nWold Newton\n\nThe Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology, by Win Scott Eckert, details the history of Philip José Farmer's intertextual novels, although his graphics can take quite a while to load. As tangents to the Wold Newton Universe, Win offers a number of other chronologies, put together by Win himself or (often) in collaboration with others:\n\nThe Tarzan/John Carter/Pellucidar/Caspak/Moon/Carson of Venus Chronology, which \"covers the shared worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs' fantastic creations\" but has a rather unwieldy name; The Doc Savage Chronology, from the character created by Lester Dent (as Kenneth Robeson); The Avenger Chronology, from the character created by Paul Ernst (as Kenneth Robeson);\n\nthe Chronology of Dr. Fu Manchu and Sir Denis Nayland Smith, from the novels by Sax Rohmer;\n\nThe James Bond Chronology and Genealogy, his own version of the life of Ian Fleming's spy, which disagrees greatly with the one further below; The Shadow Chronology, from the works primarily written by Walter B. Gibson (as Maxwell Grant); The Rook Chronology, from the time-travelling comic book character created by Bill DuBay; Parker's P.I.'s: A Chronology of Spenser, Jesse Stone, and Sunny Randall, covering Robert B. Parker's detective novel series; The U.N.C.L.E. Chronology, by Mark Ellis and Win Eckert; The Wild Wild West Chronology, also by Mark Ellis and Win Eckert; Masked Men: A Chronology of the Lone Ranger and the Green Hornet, by Mark Ellis, Matthew Baugh, and Win Eckert, from the related characters created by Fran Striker; The Legacy of the Fox: A Chronology of Zorro, by Matthew Baugh (with updates and additions by Win Eckert), from the character created by Johnston McCulley, which I find intriguing for what it illustrates about the evolution of Zorro; The Shang Chi Chronology, also by Matthew Baugh (with Win Eckert), featuring the son of Fu Manchu created by Marvel Comics; Maureen Birnbaum and the Timeline of Adventure, again by Baugh, a chronology of the Muffy Birnbaum stories by George Alec Effinger; The Life and Times of the Rev. Doctor Christopher Syn, Parson, Smuggler, and Sometime Pirate, once more by Baugh, from the series of novels by Russell Thorndike; The Solomon Kane Chronology, yet again by Baugh (adapted from Richard Toogood), from the stories by Robert E. Howard;\n\nsome short Chronologies of Wold Newton Universe Occult Detectives, also by Matthew Baugh, including:\n\nthe Jules de Grandin Chronology, with Rick Lai, from the stories by Seabury Quinn;\n\nThe Judge Pursuivant Chronology, the John Thunstone Chronology, and the Silver John Chronology, all from the stories by Manly Wade Wellman;\n\nthe Anton Zarnak Chronology, from the character created by Lin Carter; and\n\nthe John Kirowan Chronology, from the stories by Robert E. Howard;\n\nthe Sgt. Jaeger Chronology, by Rick Lai, from a set of three stories by Manly Wade Wellman;\n\nThe Monsieur Lecoq Chronology, also by Rick Lai, from the novels by Émile Gaboriau; The Casca Chronology, by Andrew K. Henry, from the novels by Barry Sadler; The Chronology of Hercule Poirot, by Brad Mengel, from the works of Agatha Christie; and\n\nthe Callahan's Crosstime Saloon Chronology, compiled by Loki Carbis, from the stories by Spider Robinson.\n\nThe French Wold Newton Universe Timeline, by Jean-Marc Lofficier, covers similar territory but offers its own take on the material by bringing in characters from the vast field of French popular fiction. Jean-Marc also offers a few tangential timelines:\n\nLes Habits Noirs: A Timeline, by Jean-Marc himself, from the novels by Paul Féval, père; and\n\nan Arsène Lupin Timeline, by André-François Ruaud, from the stories by Maurice Leblanc.\n\nOther Books\n\nSteve Vander Ark and Michele Worley have compiled an impressive set of Harry Potter Time Lines and Calendars based on JK Rowling's series, centred around \"The Master Timeline of the Entire Saga.\" All of their work is very thoroughly annotated.\n\nMargaret Levine Young has compiled a different take on The Harry Potter Timelines, which includes both a Master Timeline and individual timelines for many of the characters, though it currently only contains information from the first four volumes.\n\nKris Naudus has also put together her own version of the Harry Potter Timeline, though it similarly doesn't extend past the first four volumes.\n\nThe Twilight Timeline features information from all four books in Stephenie Meyer's series, along with information from her website and personal correspondence and corrections from Meyer herself.\n\nDr. Attila Torkos, of the University of Szeged in Hungary, has compiled a Chronology of Anne Rice's World, including up-to-date references from all of her interconnected works.\n\nThe Timeline of the Vampire Chronicles, by contrast, is actually taken from The Vampire Companion by Katherine Ramsland, with the cooperation of Anne Rice. As such, it could stand to be more detailed, and it doesn't include any information from Anne Rice's more recent vampire novels.\n\nDr. Attila Torkos (mentioned above) has also compiled a Timeline of Stephen Kings Multiverse, covering events on Keystone Earth, the Prime Reality, the world of The Stand, and Mid-World, all centred around The Dark Tower. However, his coding appears not to work on older browsers.\n\nThe Timeline of the Dune Universe, once again by Dr. Attila Torkos, makes a point of being based entirely on the published novels (including the original works by Frank Herbert as well as the newer prequels and sequels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson), without containing any information from The Dune Encyclopedia.\n\nThe Dune Chronology, by contrast, is that which appeared in The Dune Encyclopedia, originally written by Dr. Willis E. McNelly, and is now considered an alternate, non-canonical take on the \"Duniverse.\"\n\nMike Carlin's Isaac Asimov Timeline forms just a part of his extensive Encyclopedia Galactica.\n\nDr. Attila Torkos has compiled his own Chronology of the Robot-Empire-Foundation Universe, which updates the timeline first published in David Brin's novel Foundation's Triumph. (A slightly shorter version of Attila's timeline was published in the Robot sequel Aurora, by Mark W. Tiedemann.)\n\nDr. Attila Torkos has also compiled a number of other timelines based on a variety of speculative fiction series:\n\nThe Giants Chronology (A and B), from the series of Minervan Experiment novels by James P. Hogan; The Kronian Legacy Chronology, sticking with James P. Hogan, based on the novels Cradle of Saturn and The Anguished Dawn;\n\na Timeline to the Rama Universe, from Arthur C. Clarke's series;\n\nThe Space Odyssey Chronology, from the epic series also written by Arthur C. Clarke, which remains in this section as opposed to the Movies section because it is based on the novels and includes the latter two of those, 2061: Odyssey Three and 3001: The Final Odyssey; The Riverworld Chronology, from the series by Philip José Farmer;\n\na Timeline of the Mythago Cycle, from the fantasy series by Robert Holdstock; and\n\na Timeline of the Hyperion Cantos, from the series of novels by Dan Simmons.\n\nAlberto Monteiro, that stalwart historian of things that never were, has also compiled a guide to alternate Heinlein Timelines, including specific timelines for his Future History and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.\n\nThe Oz Chronicles, by Tyler Jones and Chris Dulabone, provides what they call an \"Historically Accurate Chronological Chain\" for the various Ozian books written over the years by L. Frank Baum and others.\n\nThe Most Up-To-Date Oz List uses a different set of criteria to determine what belongs in the chronology of Oz--but in doing so, it leaves out many of the books in the above chronicles while including many \"non-commercial books\" which might be considered fan fiction. The Royal Timeline of Oz, by Joe Bongiorno, features his own take on which books should be considered canonical, with notes on each book he looked at, though its formatting is best suited to monitors with higher resolutions.\n\nIt's not quite a complete David Eddings timeline, but Matt Korth has compiled A Timeline for The Belgariad and The Malloreon.\n\nCheryl Beth Miller has put together a Timeline of Major Events on Pern, covering ten books (for now) in Anne McCaffrey's series.\n\nAlexx Kay has put together A Tentative Timeline of Dragaeran History, from Steven Brust's series of fantasy novels.\n\nThe Discworld Timeline, \"moderated\" by Orin Thomas, is a bit messy and could stand to be delineated better, but it does clear up many confusing issues in the series by Terry and Lyn Pratchett.\n\nLeslie S. Klinger has a Sherlock Holmes Timeline in table form, showing major events in the lives of Holmes, Watson, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the history of Western Europe and the rest of the world. Thankfully, it is based on the work of William S. Baring-Gould.\n\nThe Gulliver's Travels Chronology, compiled by Lee Jaffe, uses a similar table form to cover Jonathan Swift's literary classic, providing a history of events in the Travels, Swift's life, and his times.\n\nA timeline for The Life and Times of Richard Sharpe is available, chronicling the protagonist of Bernard Cornwell's series of historical novels.\n\nThe Outlandish Timeline attempts to begin a complete reference work for the Outlander novels by Diana Gabaldon, but it hasn't been updated in some time.\n\nAlthough the Fear Street Timeline, based on the series of novels by R.L. Stine, claims to be incomplete and unedited, it still manages to be rather detailed.\n\nThe Domination Of The Draka, maintained by John B. Geis, is an \"Historical Timeline of the Domination\" described in S.M. Stirling's Drakon series of alternate history novels.\n\nAlex Maddison, the post-apocalyptic fan mentioned above, has also compiled a detailed Deathlands Chronology, from the series of novels by James Axler.\n\nThe Outlanders Timeline, by Alex Maddison, Mark Ellis, and Chris Van Deelen, deals specifically with the series that spun off from Deathlands (and should certainly not be confused with Diana Gabaldon's series!).\n\nThe Up To Date Known Space Chronology, compiled by I. Marc Carlson, covers the extensive universe created by Larry Niven.\n\nThe Chronology of Jerry Pournelle's Future History (not to be confused with Robert A. Heinlein's), by Larry King, chronicles the universe of the CoDominium.\n\nI. Marc Carlson has also compiled the Time Line of the Harry Dresden Universe, based on the stories which make up The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher.\n\nFabrice Rossi has put together an overview of Darkover History as part of an extensive site devoted to Marion Zimmer Bradley's work. Une version française de cet histoire est aussi disponible.\n\nThe Andre Norton Multiverse Timeline, by Maureen S. O'Brien, is (as she puts it) \"possibly the most comprehensive chronology to date. Unfortunately, said date is 1995.\" Tarzan Alive, by Ed Stephan, is really meant as a guide to Philip José Farmer's \"definitive biography of Lord Greystoke,\" but its selling point is a chronology of events bearing directly on the Tarzan story.\n\nChris Adams has compiled his own Timeline of the Burroughs Universe, and offers a copy of Clark A. Brady's Chronology of Events in Burroughs' Fiction for comparison.\n\nWalter von Tagen III has compiled A James Bond Chronology based on the writings of Ian Fleming, without including most of the more recent Bond works.\n\nThe Flashman Chronology, by Brian Siano with additions by Brian Teron and John Walker, details the very realistic life and times of Sir Harry Flashman, the central character in a series of historical novels by George MacDonald Fraser.\n\nThe Timeline of the Honor Harrington Universe, maintained by Scott Deering, covers the military sci-fi series by David M. Weber.\n\nMuffy Barkocy has put together a chronology of Nero Wolfe's Cases, from the series of mystery novels by Rex Stout. Like the Sherlockian timeline above, it is also based on the work of William S. Baring-Gould.\n\nDon Seltzer has put together a timeline for Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin Series, about the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, correlating the books with real historical events. See? Not every timeline has to be about a genre series...\n\nAs a supplement to this, there is also a timeline of Jack Aubrey's Career Prior to the Books in table form, submitted by Richard S. Ellis.\n\nThe Matter of Britain Series Timeline is based on an alternate history work in progress by Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne.\n\nS. Andrew Swann has put together A Moreau Timeline based on his own series of novels.\n\nWould you believe it? Alberto Monteiro has even put together The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Timeline.\n\nThe Looking Glass Wars Timeline, presumably compiled by Frank Beddor himself, parallels events in \"our\" world with events in Wonderland.\n\nMichael Rawdon has compiled A Chronology of Lord Peter Wimsey Stories, from the works of Dorothy L. Sayers, which includes notes on the placement of each story.\n\nMichael has done the same with A Chronology of Albert Campion Stories, from the works of Margery Allingham, which is far shorter.\n\nSteve Sloan contributed and modified the Timeline and History of the Five Galaxies, from David Brin's Uplift series, based on the original timeline found in GURPS Uplift.\n\nThe Deverry Series Chronology, from the sequence of historical fantasy novels by Katharine Kerr, appears to have been put together by Kerr herself.\n\nPaul Hendricks has put together a Chronology of the Anne of Green Gables Books, from Lucy Maud Montgomery's series.\n\nLori Beste has composed a Time Line for Wuthering Heights, from the classic novel by Emily Brönte.\n\nAnna Melashenko has compiled a rather scant Narnia Timeline in table form, chronicling the Chronicles (if you will) by C. S. Lewis.\n\nThe Shannara Timeline by Minnie Gong, from the series by Terry Brooks, is also in table form and is similarly scant.\n\nAnother scant timeline in table form, by David Johnson, outlines much of H. Beam Piper's work with A Chronology of Piper's Terro-Human Future History.\n\nThe 1632 Timeline by Bo Johansson, based on the alternate history series created by Eric Flint, is yet another scant timeline in table form.\n\nI. Marc Carlson has compiled the Timeline of the Nantucketer Universe, based on the similar alternate history series by S.M. Stirling, which is another scant timeline in table form.\n\nI. Marc Carlson has also compiled the Time Line of the Altered Carbon Universe, from the Takeshi Kovacs novels by Richard K. Morgan.\n\nSteve Roth's Hamlet Timeline is an abbreviated version of his full book chapter exploring the chronology of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark by William Shakespeare.\n\nMadeline Ferwerda compiled A Canonical Timeline of the Events of the Corwin Chronicles, from Roger Zelazny's Amber series.\n\nJim Gillogly has put together a fairly basic Modesty Blaise Chronology, based on the book and comic series by Peter O'Donnell.\n\nGames\n\nGames, in whatever medium they are played, present a unique problem for historians of things that never were, since the outcome of any given history is often dependent on the player(s) of the game in question. The universe that a game or series of games takes place in, however, still needs to be set out for these players, in much the same way as it is outlined in other media, and the histories presented in such games are just as worthy of pseudohistorical study as those provided elsewhere on this site.\n\nAs with the other categories, difficulties brought on by the subjectivity of gameplay do not hinder the attempts of these brave scholars to sort out game histories as consistently as possible. In the interests of simplicity, these timelines tend to follow the \"official\" path for the history of a game's setting as described in the sourcebooks, novels, and so forth that are associated with it.\n\nDungeons & Dragons\n\nDungeons & Dragons is the original roleplaying game, and as such, it has the most elaborate history to its name. A number of worlds have been spawned from the D&D setting over the years, and timelines for some of these have been described online.\n\nA Temporal Chronology of the Primes, by Brian R. James, \"is a timeline that links events from D&D's popular campaign worlds into a single historical accounting\" by using known events that link the campaign worlds from official source material.\n\nMystara was the first setting created for Dungeons & Dragons, and although now out-of-print, it still has a number of fans. The best look at this setting is undoubtedly The History of Mystara and its Races, featuring The Unofficial Timeline of Mystara, a main timeline by Daniel Boese, as well as additional timelines by Giampaolo Agosta, Marco Dalmonte, Átila Pires dos Santos, Geoff Gander, Jerry Hovenanian, Matthew Levy, Shawn Stanley, Andrew Theisen, and Steven B. Wilson.\n\nFans of the Dragonlance saga have two timelines to choose from:\n\nThe first version of The Timeline of Krynn, by Laios Basileios, can be found at the University of Crete.\n\nA second, less detailed version, also called The Timeline of Krynn, by Katherine Lau, has a rather garish background.\n\nEric L. Boyd, Ed Greenwood, Steven E. Schend, and \"The Candlekeep Monks\" at Wizards of the Coast have put togeter Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction, \"a complete accounting\" of Forgotten Realms novels, comics, and short stories sorted chronologically.\n\nSeparately, Sylvain Robert has compiled his own, shorter Forgotten Realms Timeline, although it seems to take some of its information from other timelines previously available online.\n\nOther Games\n\nThe Chronology of Quendor, by Robin Lionheart, is a thorough guide to the internal history of the Zork series of text adventures, as well as offering a number of other information resources. It's \"so colossal, even Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive might find it adequate.\"\n\nThe Suikoden Timeline, compiled by Theodore Pastor, is a very complete guide to the continuing history between the different games, although it hasn't been updated to include the newest addition to the series.\n\nThe historical setting of the Ultima series of computer games is outlined by Robert S. Gregg, who has compiled a Chronology of Britannia, actually covering events which took place in both Britannia and Sosaria.\n\nThe Star Fleet Universe Timeline is the official account from Amarillo Design Bureau of the history in Star Fleet Battles, whose setting has long since deviated from the Star Trek canon whence it originated.\n\nThe Biohazard/Resident Evil Timeline, by John Nicholson, covers the mythology of that video game franchise in a series of PDF files with extensive annotations.\n\nWhite Wolf's World of Darkness Timeline, by Jonathan Burt, is somewhat complete but increasingly out-of-date, in light of the Third Edition of Vampire: The Masquerade. The Scroll of Time is a detailed timeline of the Warhammer Universe.\n\nThe Traveller Integrated Timeline, edited by Donald E. McKinney, chronicles the history of that roleplaying universe up to its divergence with the GURPS Traveller universe. (A newer version of the timeline is also available as a Zip file.)\n\nDavid William Butler has put together a guide to the four major continuity theories for The Legend of Zelda series. The version developed by the original Zelda Headquarters has a Standard Interpretation Time Line as well as a modified Zelda.com Interpretation Time Line, while the version based on comments by Zelda producer Shigeru Miyamoto has a Late Imprisoning War Interpretation Time Line and a Early Imprisoning War Interpretation Time Line. Confused yet?\n\nIn turn, Juliet A. Singleton has taken this sort of research and done her own to create the Hyrulian Timeline, which includes information from the comics and TV series as well as the video games themselves.\n\nA number of BattleTech Timelines by Dan Grendell, covering the history of each of the Great Houses and other significant groups, was originally compiled for FASA's official game homepage.\n\nAndrew Timson has put together his own BattleTech Timeline, providing \"one possible order for reading the books.\"\n\nThe Wing Commander Timeline, written and compiled by Andrew Modeen, with contributions from Ben Lesnick, is the most detailed guide to the games' internal history on the Web, though it apparently contains some entries based on fan fiction.\n\nAnother Wing Commander Timeline provides a more scant guide to the games' history.\n\nThe Halo Story Timeline covers the internal history of that very popular game series, largely through the use of tie-in novels and an official backstory provided online.\n\nThe \"spiritual predecessor\" to Halo in the gaming world is also covered with Marathon's Timeline, by Matthew Smith and Hamish Sinclair.\n\nThe CastleVania Timeline, by Andrew Modeen, makes a point of noting the differences between the American and Japanese chronologies for the game series.\n\nRiccardo Raffaelli offers a different look at the CastleVania Chronology, with more dates for events between the games in the series.\n\nYet another interpretation of The CastleVania Storyline is available, by Kurt Kalata, Mike Boyajian, and Mike Benhuri.\n\nFor some reason, the Final Fantasy VII Timeline is arranged backwards, from the most recent events back into the distant past.\n\nFor a more specialised look at the game's backstory, you can also look at The Jenova Project: A Timeline, dealing with the bioengineering experiment at the centre of the game.\n\nThe Final Fantasy VIII Timeline is considerate enough to actually have separate timelines depending on what point in the game you've reached, in order to avoid spoilers.\n\nThe Timeline of Events in Half-Life History, by Chan Karunamuni, \"goes over all the major events and plot points of the saga, from before Half-Life 1 to the end of Half-Life 2.\"\n\nAlthough this Mario Timeline is described as a speculative \"theory,\" it's almost frightening to see how it manages to get all the different games in the long-running Mario series together--even the party games--and have the result actually make sense.\n\nBy contrast, the Super Mario Bros. Timeline, by Chris Waters, focusses on the specific series of the same name, and does so without explaining how he arrived at his dates.\n\nThe Mega Man X Series Timeline is vague in certain places, but appears to be well thought out.\n\nBecause of all of the possible alternate timelines, the Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross Timeline hurts my head a bit.\n\nThe Dino Crisis Timeline, by Edward Kirk, also attempts to deal with the consequences of time travel and alternate outcomes in the games.\n\nThe Contra Timeline, also by Kurt Kalata, Mike Boyajian, and Mike Benhuri. The Metal Gear Timeline, by Brant Wynn and Johnny Soler, attempts to reconcile the contradicting versions of the story on different systems, as well as the apocryphal Snake's Revenge. The Metroid Story, written by T. J. Rappel, is a detailed narrative dealing with the history behind the three Metroid games.\n\nThe Ace Attorney Series Time Line contains information through Apollo Justice.\n\nCory Fischer has put together a very scant Myst Timeline dealing with the history of the D'ni.\n\nThe official website for World of Warcraft features an even more scant World of Warcraft Timeline listing where works of fiction fall between the original games and the current expansions.\n\nComics\n\nWhile comics, like books, provide an array of possible fields of study for the fictional historian, most people do not undertake such a task because of the extensive problems that arise from such practices as trying to tell a long continuous story while keeping all of its characters the same age, or spinning off more and more forking paths of time and alternate Earths (with their concomitant alternate versions of the same people) until the mind boggles with divergent histories.\n\nDespite these quandaries, some people online have still decided to tackle the glaring continuity issues before them and create coherent histories for their favourite comic book heroes.\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe Unauthorized Chronology of the DC Universe, compiled by Chris J. Miller, prides itself on standing out from the crowd, as it were, by being \"complete, comprehensive, canonical, cross-referenced, original, and annotated.\" The Unofficial History of the DC Universe is also meant to chronicle the events of the DC Universe as it now stands, \"spanning from creation to the end of time,\" but at this point, it only covers events up to \"13 Years Ago.\"\n\nLoki Carbis has compiled The Secret History of the DC Universe, starting with the Zero Hour timeline and working from the timelines in Secret Files & Origins.\n\nMichael Kooiman is only slightly more specific in his focus by offering a Chronology of the Pre-20th Century DC Universe.\n\nJim Doty has written A DC Golden Age Timeline, which is just what it says it is, though it only covers the twentieth century.\n\nJohn McDonagh has his own Golden Age Heroes of Earth-1 Timeline, which is explicitly only meant to cover \"certain important events\" as opposed to serving as a comprehensive timeline.\n\nAlong similar lines, Michael Norwitz has compiled a basic Earth-2 Timeline, covering the original Earth on which DC's Golden Age stories were set.\n\nMichael Norwitz has also compiled or otherwise presented a healthy number of alternate timelines, both historical and thematic, which are rather speculative and liberal in terms of choosing characters and events to include in each world:\n\nan Earth-2.5 Timeline, by Rahadyan Sastrowardoyo, featuring the Justice Guild which appeared in the animated Justice League episode \"Legends;\"\n\nan Earth-3 Timeline, featuring evil counterparts of standard DC heroes, particularly the Crime Syndicate;\n\nan Earth-4 Timeline, featuring heroes published by Charlton Comics;\n\nan Earth-5 Timeline, featuring mundane versions of famous superhero characters;\n\nan Earth-12 Timeline, featuring the Inferior 5 and other humourous DC characters;\n\nan Earth-17/Dreamworld Timeline, featuring both Overman & the Justice Project of America and Sunshine Superman & the Love Syndicate, as seen in Animal Man #23;\n\nan Earth-18 Timeline, featuring Marvelman and Big Ben from Warrior magazine;\n\nan Earth-27 Timeline, featuring
