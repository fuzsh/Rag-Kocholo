        "text": "ACM has made the decision to cease print publication for ACM’s journals and transactions as of January 2024. There were several motivations for this change: ACM wants to be as environmentally friendly as possible; print journals lack the new features and functionality of the electronic versions in the ACM Digital Library; and print subscriptions, which have been declining for years, have now reached a level where the time was right to sunset print. Please contact [email protected] should you have any questions.\n\nThe journals of ACM once again had an impressive showing in the latest Journal Citation Reports release from Clarivate, with notable performances across the entire portfolio and fifteen journals receiving their first impact factors—including four titles from the innovative Proceedings of the ACM (PACM) program. ACM's flagship magazine Communications of the ACM (CACM) continued its dominance by receiving an all-time high impact factor of 22.7, placing it first in all three of its categories, and ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) which continued to ascend with an impact factor of 16.6, placing it third in the Computer Science, Theory & Methods category.\n\nIn a major step in its transition to fully Open Access (OA) publication of all content on the ACM Digital Library, ACM will transition the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS) to a fully OA publishing model from January 2024. In the new model, all ICPS papers will be made OA upon publication, and existing ICPS papers will be converted to OA. Some authors who are not at ACM Open institutions will be required to pay Article Processing Charges (APCs). The model will apply to all conferences for which the Call for Papers will be issued on or after January 1, 2024.\n\nACM has opened the articles published during the first 50 years of its publishing program, from 1951 through the end of 2000, These articles are now open and freely available to view and download via the ACM Digital Library. ACM’s first 50 years backfile contains more than 117,500 articles on a wide range of computing topics. In addition to articles published between 1951 and 2000, ACM has also opened related and supplemental materials including data sets, software, slides, audio recordings, and videos.\n\nACM and IMS (Institute of Mathematical Statistics) have announced the publication of the first issues of the ACM/IMS Journal of Data Science (JDS), a new peer-reviewed publication. The scope of the journal is multi-disciplinary and broad, spanning statistics, machine learning, computer systems, and the societal implications of data science. JDS accepts original papers as well as novel surveys that summarize and organize critical subject areas. The ACM/IMS Journal of Data Science is a Gold Open Access publication, permanently and freely available online for anyone, anywhere to read.\n\nThe inaugural issue of ACM Distributed Ledger Technologies: Research and Practice (DLT) is now available for download. DLT is a peer-reviewed journal that publishes high quality, interdisciplinary research on the research and development, real-world deployment, and/or evaluation of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as blockchain, cryptocurrency, and smart contracts. DLT offers a blend of original research work and innovative practice-driven advancements by internationally distinguished DLT experts and researchers from academia, and public and private sector organizations. For more information and to submit your work, visit the journal homepage.\n\nGames: Research and Practice (Games) offers a lighthouse for games research that defines the state of the art on games and playable media across academic research and industry practice. Inclusive in community, discipline, method, and game form, it publishes major reviews, tutorials, and advances on games and playable media that are both practically useful and grounded in robust evidence and argument, alongside case studies, opinions, and dialogues on new developments that will change games. For more information and to submit your work, visit the homepage.\n\nThe inaugural issue of Collective Intelligence (COLA) is now available for download. Co-published by SAGE in collaboration with NESTA, COLA is a global, peer-reviewed, open-access journal that publishes trans-disciplinary work bearing on collective intelligence across the disciplines. The journal embraces a policy of creative rigor to facilitate the discovery of principles that apply across scales and new ways of harnessing the collective to improve social, ecological, and economic outcomes. For more information and to submit your work, visit the journal homepage.\n\nAs of January 2022, and for a two-year period, all papers published in ACM Transactions on Programming Languages (TOPLAS) will be published as Gold Open Access (OA) and will be free to read and share via the ACM Digital Library. During the first two years, authors will be given the option (but not required) to pay the APC. Archival content will be made open access as of January 1, 2022 as well. For those authors financially unable to pay the APC as of 2024, ACM has developed a waiver program to ensure that no accepted articles to TOPLAS go unpublished as a result of financial need.\n\nACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS) is now available for download. TORS publishes high quality papers that address various aspects of recommender systems research such as algorithms, user experience, and the impact and value of such systems. The journal takes a holistic view of the field and calls for contributions from different subfields of computer science and information systems such as machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, web-based systems, data science and big data, and human-computer interaction. For more information and to submit your work, visit the journal homepage.\n\nProceedings of the ACM (PACM) is a journal series that launched in 2017. The series was created in recognition of the fact that conference-centric publishing disadvantages the CS community with respect to other scientific disciplines when competing with researchers from other disciplines for top science awards and career progression, and the fact that top ACM conferences have demonstrated high quality and high impact on the field. See PACMs on Programming Languages, Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems, and HCI.\n\nPublished in celebration of ACM-W’s 30th birthday, Rendering History: The Women of ACM-W is divided into three parts The first section provides a traditional history that details the evolution of ACM-W’s projects. The next section allows the women of ACM-W to tell their own stories. What motivated them to trade personal time and energy for work that would change the face of computing for women and young girls? And final section of the book provides an annotated bibliography of the research that launched ACM-W and continued to inform its projects over the next 30 years.\n\nPick, Click, Flick!: The Story of Interaction Techniques by Brad A. Myers provides a comprehensive study of the many ways to interact with computers and computerized devices. An “interaction technique” starts when the user performs an action that causes an electronic device to respond, and includes the direct feedback from the device to the user. It is written for anyone interested in interaction techniques including computer scientists and designers working on human-computer interaction, as well as implementers and consumers who want to understand and get the most out of their digital devices.\n\nDigital Dreams Have Become Nightmares: What We Must Do by Ronald M. Baecker and Jonathan Grudin offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government.\n\nSpatial Gems, Volume 2, by John Krumm, Andreas Züfle, and Cyrus Shahabi, is a follow-up to the first Spatial Gems volume and a further collection of techniques contributed by leading research experts. Although these approaches were developed by their authors as part of larger research projects, the gems represent fundamental solutions that are generically applicable to many different problems. The goal is to share these useful techniques—not yet in textbooks and often buried inside technical research papers—with software developers, graduate students, professors, and professional researchers.\n\nMPC (multiparty computation) was introduced to the world in 1982—at about the same time the Commodore 64 was announced. Why are we still talking about MPC more than 40 years later? Well, it turns out MPC is based on some extremely complex math, which is like nectar to anyone in the field of cryptography. And, over the past decade, MPC has come to be exhumed from the archives and harnessed as one of the most powerful tools available for the protection of sensitive data. Here, in a discussion with Nigel Smart, Joshua W. Baron, Sanjay Saravanan, Jordan Brandt, and Atefeh Mashatan, we explore some of the implications of these advances.\n\nACM Queue’s \"Research for Practice\" serves up expert-curated guides to the best of computing research, and relates these breakthroughs to the challenges that software engineers face every day. In this installment, \"Automatically Testing Database Systems,\" Manuel Rigger (Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore) presents three papers. The first focuses on the problem of automatically synthesizing sophisticated test oracles that check whether the outputs of a database history are correct. The second co-designs input generation and test oracle in order to focus strictly on bugs in concurrency control. The last covers a diverse input space of SQL dialects while relying on the \"built-in\" test oracle of system crashes.\n\nAnyone listed as Author on an ACM paper must meet certain criteria, including making substantial intellectual contributions to some components of the original work and drafting and/or revising the paper.\n\nAuthors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications will represent that the paper submitted is original; that the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue; that they have the rights and intent to publish the work in the venue to which it is submitted; and that any prior publications on which this work is based are documented appropriately.\n\nRead the entire set of criteria in the Policy on Authorship.\n\nThe Conflict of Interest policy outlines what constitutes a conflict of interest (COI) for ACM publications; who is in a position to identify and report potential COIs; and how a potential COI should be managed. The policy applies to any material that is formally reviewed or refereed as per ACM policy; awards based on content published in ACM venues; and authors, reviewers, editors, conference program committee members, judges, and other persons associated with ACM-published materials.\n\nThe policy provides specific guidelines for common instances with the goal of assisting in the process of identifying and resolving potential conflicts of interest. It also describes how the policy can be augmented, and how exceptions may be approved.\n\nFor at least 40 years, there has been debate and disagreement as to the role of mathematics in the computer science curriculum. In the August Communcations of the ACM, Carla E. Brodley, McKenna Quam, and Mark Weiss take a look at which math classes are required, but at how they are used as prerequisites (and corequisites) for CS coursesat. There is no consensus across US universities as to the placement of discrete math and calculus in the CS course sequence, and indeed early placement can serve as an institutional barrier which impacts students’ discovery, retention, and persistence in computing.\n\nACM is pleased to announce that its Publications Board has approved an updated Peer Review Policy. If you have any questions regarding the update, the associated FAQ addresses topics such as confidentiality, the use of large language models in the peer review process, conflicts of interest, and several other relevant concerns. If there are any issues that are not addressed in the FAQ, please contact [email protected].\n\nACM supports the unrestricted publication and dissemination of scientific, educational, and technical information to the global community of computing professionals and students. However, at the same time ACM is bound to comply with laws and regulations in the legal jurisdictions ACM operates—including in the US, EU, UK, and elsewhere around the world—that have the potential to limit how ACM operates around the world with respect to Publications. Specifically, Geographic Sanctions and Sanctions on Individuals.\n\nThe inaugural issue of ACM Journal on Autonomous Transportation Systems (JATS) is now available for download. JATS aims to cover the topics in design, analysis, and control of autonomous transportation systems. The area of autonomous transportation systems is at a critical point where issues related to data, models, computation, and scale are increasingly important. Similarly, multiple disciplines including computer science, electrical engineering, civil engineering, etc., are approaching these problems with a significant growth in research activity. For further information read the news release, and to submit your manuscript, please visit the journal homepage.\n\nDue to the considerable growth in submissions and publications of ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), the number of CSUR issues published yearly will increase from six to nine. The change will take effect with Volume 54 in 2022. CSUR's comprehensive, readable surveys and tutorial papers give guided tours through the literature and explain topics to those who seek to learn the basics of areas outside their specialties in an accessible way.\n\nIn an effort to better serve—and incentivize—ACM reviewers, ACM has partnered with the Publons Reviewer Recognition Service, which allows reviewers to create a profile and to track, verify and promote their efforts for ACM publications. Publons—operating on over 5,000 scholarly journals—is owned by Clarivate Analytics and offers a verified record of a reviewer’s editorial activity for a publication that can be used for CVs, profiles, tenure packages, and more.\n\nKudos is a free service that you can use to promote your work more effectively. After your paper has been accepted and uploaded to the ACM Digital Library, you'll receive an invitation from Kudos to create an account and add a plain-language description. The Kudos “Shareable PDF” allows you to generate a PDF to upload to websites, such as your homepage, institutional repository, preprint services, and social media. This PDF contains a link to the full-text version of your article in the ACM DL, adding to download and citation counts.\n\nMore precise search. Alerts when new articles in your area of interest are published. Expanded article pages. More informative author profile pages. Integrated journal homepages and expanded content on ACM SIGs and conferences. These are just some of the features you'll find in the new ACM DL. Check out our series of emails about these and other enhancements, and discover more about the new DL experience.\n\nThe August issue of Communications of the ACM includes the 2024 Regional Special Section - Latin America. When it comes to computer science, Latin American researchers have made significant contributions to multiple areas. And these 18 informative, engaging articles run the gamut of countries, subjects, and specialties, including \"Keys to a Comprehensive Computer Science at School Policy in Argentina,\" \"The Digital Degree Certification Revolution in Brazil and Beyond,\" \"Social Robots for Healthcare and Education in Latin America,\" \"Exploring Stereotypes and Biases in Language Technologies in Latin America,\" and more.\n\nHave you always wondered how you can improve your writing and communicate more effectively? Ubiquity, ACM's online magazine of critical analysis and in-depth commentary, offers Communication Corner, a monthy feature by Philip Yaffe, retired Wall Street Journal reporter and Ubiquity editorial board member.
