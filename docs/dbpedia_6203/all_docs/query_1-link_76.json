        "text": "History\n\nThe corporation was originally two companies: National Allied Publications, Inc. (also known as National Allied Newspaper Syndicate, Inc.)[3] which was founded by Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson in autumn 1934[4][5][6][note 1] to publish New Fun, the first American comic book with all-original material rather than comic strip reprints, and Detective Comics, Inc.,[5] formed in 1937 with Wheeler-Nicholson and Jack S. Liebowitz listed as owners. Wheeler-Nicholson remained for a year before being forced out in 1938, and Detective Comics, Inc. purchased the remains of National Allied Publications.[7][8]:20\n\nNational Allied and Detective Comics, Inc. merged to become National Comics Publications, Inc. on September 30, 1946,[9] absorbing Max Gaines' and Liebowitz's All-American Publications as well.[8]:50[10] National Comics was renamed National Periodical Publications, Inc. in 1961.[8]:102[11][12]"
