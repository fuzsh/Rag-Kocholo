        "text": "The accessibility factor.\n\nKeeping up with regulatory requirements, and making compliance documentation accaessible to those with sensory disabilities, is a daunting task. At Newgen, we work closely with a translation company to help meet this challenge. To cite an example, we handled multi-language PDF remediation for over 40,000 pages in a mere 20 days. It involved seven input languages, including complex right-to-left Arabic and Farsi. Rigorous quality checks and file validation using tools like PAC3, JAWS and NVDA were carried out to ensure an error-free output. No wonder we continue to be a preferred partner for the client.\n\nMeeting, and beating, deadlines.\n\nA leading international university press sought to digitize nearly 5,000 academic titles, making it the single largest collection of books on their platform. It would give researchers access to vital content previously unavailable in an electronic format. Then came a nice little surprise. All of it had to be delivered within 45 days, with a weekly target of 1,000 titles starting from the third week.\n\nNewgen got down to work, setting up two teams working in tandem to ensure a smooth delivery. Silk Evolve, our proprietary publishing technology, came in handy along with other conversion, workflow management and tracking tools. The process of automation helped increase our efficiency by a significant measure of 16%, enabling us to complete the entire volume of delivery a week ahead of schedule.\n\nEfficiency is the word.\n\nWhat's common to these books: The Gun Debate, Dangerous Crooked Scoundrels and Art Scents? Well, they were all produced using a unique workflow designed and implemented by Newgen. It came as an answer to the discomfiture of many authors when it comes to different review formats. The manuscript for most books is submitted in Word format, and so is the first step in the copy editing review by the author. But, the moment the content is typeset, the mode of review shifts to pdf files. Many authors are uncomfortable marking their changes and comments in pdf files and find this shift annoying.\n\nNewgen devised a customizable MS Word-based workflow to handle the manuscript submission and copy-editing process. The proof generation process was automated, and a Word-based indexing and tabling process was formulated. Besides leading to a significant reduction in content errors, it enabled us to eliminate an entire round of review, gaining three weeks in time to market.\n\nEver since its introduction, the Word-based workflow has been seamlessly adopted by several authors. And around 90% of them have consistently voiced their approval.\n\nBy the who's who of the medical fraternity.\n\nThe Oxford Textbook of Medicine, Sixth Edition is acknowledged as the ultimate reference book in the world of medicine. To produce this 7,000-page volume, Newgen had to liaise with over 900 of the world's best clinicians and medical scientists. We navigated through content updates right up to the final stages and managed a high level of typesetting complexity with extensive display and design elements. From immaculate production to timely completion, it was just what the doctor ordered.\n\nCrunching deadlines, the Newgen way.\n\nThe Laws of Australia is Thomson Reuter's flagship product published in 36 volumes. Eminent legal professionals contribute 330 titles in this product, with at least five titles to be published every month, both online and in print. In all, a minimum of 1000 pages in a final, publishable state. To fast-track typesetting, we adopted a Word-based workflow where the key legal references and elements are already enriched in the Word file. Upon updating, all the changes are accepted in Word and the file is converted to a print-ready PDF with a click of a button. That's thrice the speed of traditional typesetting!\n\nHow to win authors and influence editors.\n\nA leading legal publisher in the United States showed hesitation in handing over a very sensitive part of their business to Newgen. From a pilot project of five books to 100 products in a short course of time, the client and we have come a long way together. There are many aspects to this fruitful relationship. For one, there's respect and diplomacy on our part in working with every author. Our response is quick, sensitive and nuanced. Our emails, for instance, don't follow a template but are tailored to the author at hand. Above all, we win their trust and deliver when it matters.\n\nA coordination that might have been a nightmare.\n\nFifty State Construction Lien and Bond Law, 2020 Edition, as the name suggests, is an all-inclusive guide to lien and bond law in each state and territory of the United States. It provides authoritative and comprehensive coverage of statutes and analysis of key cases in each state, with valuable information on local requirements and procedures.\n\nThe project called for synthesis as well as speed. Newgen handled all the stages of this product, including developmental editing, copy editing, project management, proof corrections, final PDF and online process. The 'smart chart' used to compare the laws across the United States was also updated by Newgen as a value-add service to our client. A complex exercise, efficiently completed.\n\nEditors' prayers answered.\n\nFor a bulky legal journal, an editor would typically spend an inordinate amount of time in searching the publisher's database for authorised citations. At Newgen, we thought of ways in which we could free up the editor's time for more productive tasks. In consultation with the development and copy editing teams, we decided to come up with an API tool that would do the copy editor's job.\n\nFirst, the technical feasibility had to be checked and any security threat from the program countered. The client's editorial team in Australia was taken into confidence once the technical assessment was done. The resultant interface was tested and fine-tuned to eliminate any glitches.\n\nHere's how the AI copy editor works. When an editor runs the program on an unedited manuscript, it identifies and fetches all the cases quoted in an article. It searches for every identified case on the database, picking up any authorised and media neutral citations. In their absence, the tool looks for second priority citations. If there is none available, the original citation from the author is retained. The program arranges the order of the citations as defined by the publisher and creates a report listing all the cases without the authorised and media neutral citations.\n\nAll this with the editor not lifting a finger.\n\nAny format. Any challenge.\n\nProvided in a handsome box format, the RED BOX®: Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission includes over 40 color-coded booklets ideal for carrying to client meetings. It provides quick access to all the U.S. securities acts and SEC regulations, rules, and key forms. Each classic format (binder or box) comes with a bi-monthly update service, which automatically integrates new sections and revises old ones accordingly. No more delays, gaps, or outdated documents.\n\nThis superbly organized primary reference tool presents a unique technical challenge because there are two print versions, a loose leaf and a boxed set of booklets, which are updated monthly in turn. Newgen developed all the formats simultaneously, with a spine XML created to avoid redundant manuscript preparation. This enables corrections in one format to be carried over to another seamlessly. End to end, the production cycle is a mere 15 days.\n\nMaking travel easy and fun.\n\nFrommer's Travel Guides have been a go-to resource for travellers and explorers, offering vital information and useful tips.\n\nNewgen embarked on the path of converting Frommer's guides into eBooks. In addition to essential information, highlights and suggested itineraries, we devised a host of interactive features that make travel a breeze. These include integration with Google Maps, an offline option to jump between maps and reviews, seamless flipping, quick search capabilities, and embedded links to recommended websites.\n\nWe not only delivered the eBooks to various devices but also to the list of bestsellers on Amazon.\n\nA curious side effect of COVID-19.\n\nFoundations of Global Health and Human Rights was scheduled for release when the pandemic broke out. The authors were of the opinion that the book's subject area should reflect the new reality, and therefore content had to be updated. Moreover, the book had to be published before the US semester cycle. All this meant that Newgen rolled up its sleeves and got down to the task. We validated the changes carefully, streamlined the proofreading process and fast-tracked our production without compromise on quality. The end result: mission accomplished.\n\nExpertise in multiple languages.\n\nThe rise of the digital landscape has led to a dramatic rise in eBook readership. More and more publishers are gravitating towards online publishing and also converting their existing pieces of content into digital versions. In line with the evolving trend, one of the leading aggregators approached Newgen for managing the conversion of nearly 4000+ books in Latin European and Russian languages.\n\nFor Newgen, this was only the first in a long line of successful projects involving multiple languages, leading us to enhance our conversion technology solutions to handle a variety of tongues. Our conversion engine utilises multiple dictionaries and decodes text across languages with minimal human intervention. It captures text as well as tags automatically. This helps in preserving the original print content and improves the fidelity of the eBooks. Over and above, we have dedicated language specialists to ensure accurate and error-free rendition.\n\nToday, nearly 60% of our eBook conversion is in languages other than English, yielding results that are quick and precise.\n\nWhere cute characters live.\n\nWorld Book is a renowned, global enterprise that promotes reading and learning among children of all ages. Newgen brought alive a value-based educational World Book title with 70 lovable character illustrations. These had to be set in 120 different scenes against 160 backgrounds. We prepared a list of notes detailing every action of the characters, with a special emphasis on facial expressions, and tailored the illustrations accordingly. The pose, the props, the environment were all developed in synch. We checked for continuity within each scene and devised a consistent colour scheme for the entire book. Newgen helped the publisher with analysis, planning, processing, design and review, completing the project in a short period of three weeks. By all accounts, scores of kids simply loved the book.\n\nSuper quick delivery.\n\nA leading academic publisher approached Newgen to develop a platform for managing their XML products that were received from vendors across the globe. They had engaged a handful of internal resources to verify, validate and distribute their products on their platform. The work being completely manual, it delayed the publication and the sales. On top of it, coordinating with vendors to manage the project and correct errors was proving to be an arduous task.\n\nNewgen understood the issue at stake and developed a web-based XML portal that helped in faster file validation, while automation hastened the delivery process by correcting Schematron errors. The process of identifying faulty stocks and sending them back for correction, and the distribution and archival processes were fully automated. This project ticked all the boxes, helping the publisher save cost significantly. Delivery to the platform is as much as ten times faster now.\n\nHow a leading legal publisher got it done.\n\nThe annual edition of a legal publication is always a heavyweight. Especially when it's Blackstone's Civil Practice 2020 – the only major civil work to adopt a narrative approach based on the chronology of a claim. Written by a team of expert practitioners and academics, it provides authoritative analysis on the entire process of civil litigation. Besides covering specialist areas such as insolvency proceedings, sale of goods and human rights, the book features a quick-reference guide that's detailed and user-friendly.\n\nManaging this comprehensive full-service volume involved a whopping 10,000 corrections across 2,500 pages. Newgen devised a unique workflow to tackle it. It meant seamless integration of content across the main text, appendices, index and tables – processed in batches, each with its own schedule. Newgen brought in consistency, increased efficiency and established effective coordination between multiple stakeholders. Both the print and electronic versions were issued in record time, done and delivered.\n\nAll your FAQs on M&A.\n\nWhen structuring mergers and acquisitions, there's only one way to be sure that you've thought of all the tax and legal consequences: rely on Mergers, Acquisitions, and Buyouts by Martin D. Ginsburg, Jack S. Levin and Donald E. Rocap. It offers invaluable analysis and guidance, solutions to real-life business problems, and a plethora of checklists and flow charts. Updated with the latest legislation and rulings, this gold-standard resource is available as a five-volume print set, a bundle of print and CD-ROM editions, and as an online edition. Despite the scale of the project, Newgen executed it in just 20 working days. Tight deadlines? We're game.\n\nThe reliable Gatekeeper.\n\nHandling bulk volumes can be a publisher's nightmare. Input files need to be validated before they are taken up for production, and reported back within a short time. It's a critical and challenging task.\n\nFittingly enough, Newgen's solution is called Gatekeeper. It's a platform that downloads and checks files automatically, and employs PDF preflight to check structure, fonts and annotation. It enables real-time tracking of all jobs, with an option to raise and respond to queries, and automated emails for receipt and delivery. It also provides extensive PDF and ePub validation across images, hyperlinks, bookmarks and other essential factors.\n\nGatekeeper achieves validation of input and output files automatically, and takes on huge volumes effortlessly.\n\nTracking on demand.\n\nNewgen produces over 1,500 books every month for a leading book distributor in the European market. As the books span various languages, and authors and editors are spread across the continent, it became imperative to establish a control mechanism for file transaction, quality certification and distribution.\n\nNewgen devised Checkboard, a web-based online platform for facilitating complete tracking and certifying the product for launch. The system supports speedy delivery and quick quality check. From login to final delivery, every product can be tracked on a single page and the live status reviewed at any point in time.\n\nIt's one of our most effective solutions and a prime example of our automation capability.\n\nThe power behind the authority.\n\nAn authoritative guide to civil procedure, The White Book features the sources of law, supplemented by extensive expert commentary. More judges and lawyers turn to this guiding light than any other, both for the quality of advice it presents and for the latest version of rules.\n\nSince 2016, Newgen has published multiple editions and volumes in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and the United Kingdom, tracking and certifying each title for launch. One might say we wrote the book on timely delivery.\n\nChampioning PubMed compliance.\n\nInnovative digital formats come up in the publishing market regularly, forcing companies to be compliant and compatible with new platforms. One such challenge is the PubMed format, developed and maintained by the National Center of Biotechnology Information at the U.S. National Library for Medicine. The platform enables the distribution of various biomedical and dental PubMed journals, helping share valuable medical information.\n\nNewgen has been associated with PMC XML conversion for over a decade. With highly efficient workflow engines and error-free reproduction, we have helped several publishers load their content onto the PMC platform and publish on time. We have even handled conversion of hand-scribbled content into digital formats with the support of experienced and proficient data processing experts. Our rich experience has emboldened us to support different industry verticals like healthcare, dentistry, nursing services and clinical services, regardless of the complexity involved. We know we'll get it right.\n\nProfiles in excellence.\n\nThe Almanac of the Federal Judiciary has built its considerable reputation by providing balanced and responsible judicial profiles. Newgen created a unique online database of all US federal judges, and all key bankruptcy and magistrate judges. This exhaustive compilation contains valuable, hard-to-find material on every federal trial judge and appellate judge in the US. Complete with biographical information and judgement evaluations, this go-to resource is updated and published online monthly.\n\nIt includes:\n\nEach judge's academic and professional qualifications, experience on the bench, noteworthy rulings, and media coverage\n\nCandid, revealing commentary by lawyers, based on first-hand experiences before their local federal judges\n\nHelpful tips for your litigating team in shaping case strategy\n\nImportant insights into each judge's style, demeanour, knowledge, and management of courtroom proceedings\n\nContinuing in-depth research, with semi-annual updates\n\nReal-time and precise publication of multi-edition taxation guides.\n\nThe print and online versions of the taxation guides for this publisher are seamlessly updated using customized processes and tools.\n\nThe integrated modules of Newgen's editorial framework (CE Genius) enable effective and consistent enhancement of content, which then helps the editorial team in updating content efficiently, in conformance with the publisher's style, into the framework of the WMS (Workflow Management System). A module for language editing, NLP (Natural Language Processing), is also plugged in to the WMS.\n\nThe online versions are updated and released within 24 hours of receipt of updates, while the print versions are completed in 8 weeks.\n\nFaster, better, and more economical.\n\nOne of the world's leading book distributors faced the problem of not getting validated e-files from publishers on time. They were receiving as many as 5,000 titles every week from various publishers and authors, with a significant part having validating issues like inconsistent entries, corrupted files and incorrect image resolution. Invariably, they were not able to clean up all files on the same day, leading to a delay in distribution of files.\n\nNewgen developed a web portal that analyses the input e-files, fixes the wrong tags automatically and enables distribution much faster than a manual effort. Our ePub error fixing tool is practically a godsend. It fixes 90% of the titles automatically, validates and sends them back within two hours of receipt. The balance titles are filtered out for manual check, and returned to the distributor within 24 hours of receipt. This not only helps save cost but also quickens distribution and helps distributors increase their sales.\n\nLet's hear it for this Persian language textbook.\n\nModern Persian, Elementary Level is a cutting-edge language textbook with a multitude of engaging speaking activities in each chapter. Newgen created a full-fledged companion website for it, with a complete audio dictionary, over 300 audio and video presentations, and a special appendix with classroom activity material for instructors. To bring alive this interactive experience, we hosted more than 800 rich-media files, linked every word in the dictionary to audio files, and devised a searchable audio dictionary. As one might say, a solution far from elementary.\n\nThe specialists for the job.\n\nClinical Infectious Diseases is a leading journal that publishes articles on a variety of subjects that are of interest to practitioners and researchers. The journal is frequently cited in multi-disciplinary medical circles, and the articles published enjoy international readership within days of submission. Newgen manages the content with meticulous efficiency and speed. We offer full-service management, accommodating multiple reviews, exclusive styles and niche preferences. One of the highlights of our services is the management of advertisements inserted into the issues. In addition to regular high volumes, the journal is also inclined to publish useful supplements every now and then. Subject to late requests from stakeholders and an extremely fastidious editorial office, the journal is one of the best examples of what we can do.\n\nSaying it loud and clear.\n\nCreating Read Aloud eBooks in a fixed layout ePub format involves perfect synchronisation of audio and text. The audio is designed to play when the text gets highlighted. Newgen took up ePub integration with elements of audio, video, puzzles and games for a set of 15 children's books, with the language of the titles that needed to be converted being Dutch.\n\nIt called for understanding, attentiveness and precision. Newgen ensured that the coordinates of every word were marked correctly. We incorporated additional features like letting the listener turn the soundtrack on or off at will. And even provided bookmarking, text search and zooming options, among others.\n\nWe not only delivered interactive eBooks with media-rich content and seamless navigation, but also made them compatible with a host of devices and eReaders like iBook, Readium and Kobo. And guess what? We did it all in a time span of 30 days.\n\nBon travail, as they say in French.\n\nThe Dynamo French educational series is fully integrated with ActiveLearn, UK's no.1 digital learning service. With up-to-date cultural content, these books bring language learning to life with songs, poems, authentic texts and quizzes. Newgen was tasked with developing a multicomponent course that incorporates five richly-designed student books with accompanying teacher guides, various digital resources, workbooks, assessment content and supporting audio. Over a three-year journey, we worked right from content development through all the stages, including native French speaker checks, assessment testing and design. Newgen's well-crafted project management methodology came in handy, with its regular retrospectives, proactive risk management and a genuine commitment to continuous improvement. In all, we delivered over 4,000 print pages and 950 digital assets.\n\nAiding the wheels of learning.\n\nA leading technical institute in the US that provides training in various automotive technologies decided to migrate one of their Adobe Flash e-learning modules to HTML5, as Flash is becoming obsolete. The project involved 25 courses, 24,000 screens and 6,000 animations.\n\nNewgen performed a detailed analysis of the task on hand and prepared a project milestone. Our platform of choice was Articulate Storyline 360, a web authoring tool with built-in SCORM compliance capabilities and compatible with most learning management systems. After demonstrating a proof of concept, we went full steam ahead with the execution. While a project of this scale would typically take up a whole year, we successfully completed it in less than four months. A phenomenal speed that's possible only due to our agile planning and our ability to scale up on demand. No wonder the results drew kudos from the client.\n\nSolutions for a distinct need.\n\nIn a typical journal workflow, the steps are designed to follow one after another until the articles are compiled into an issue. However, in this instance, the client followed the process of putting articles together directly as issues, similar to a book. This part-journal, part-book design presented several challenges: maintaining the repository of reviewed files over a period of time, monitoring completion of articles that form the issue, yet meeting deadlines with the final compiled version. Undaunted, Newgen customized a workflow that accommodated the peculiar requirements of the publisher in a smooth and efficient manner.\n\nAll for the joy of learning.\n\nLadybird Readers offers graded ELT readers to help inspire a life-long love of reading in young learners. They are written specifically for children learning English as a foreign language.\n\nNewgen managed the design and composition of a series of illustrated literacy readers for primary school children. Our responsibilities included commissioning authors, directing a team of artists, and developing cover designs. Our project managers directed every aspect of the titles from initial draft to signed-off content ready for press. Thanks to their unstinting efforts, we successfully handled the complete production for seventeen ELT readers and fourteen accompanying activity books.\n\nAt Newgen, we're proud to have contributed to the rapid growth and tremendous success of the popular series.\n\nPreferably at the speed of lightning.\n\nThe world is heading to an extremely fast-paced content consumption model. The sooner the discoveries are presented to the scientific community, the greater the prestige associated with them.\n\nNewgen champions the Pubkit solution, facilitating fast track progress and ensuring quick publication speeds. With Pubkit, the speed of a journal can be captured in real time as content gets published. Information that is critical to the academic community is delivered on time, and breakthroughs are announced fresh from the oven.\n\nNewgen to the rescue.\n\nOxford University Press is the world's largest university press. Since 1908, its Australia and New Zealand wing has operated as a microcosm of the worldwide organisation, publishing learning materials for primary, secondary and higher education students, plus an extensive range of dictionaries. They needed to produce a marketing sample for a prestigious conference, and had little time to do so. Enter Newgen. We reviewed the content and design, incorporated curriculum changes, and handled the production to a nicety. To speed up things, we deployed a quality control tool that auto-validates pages and proactively guides users to identify and rectify style inconsistencies. This helped us deliver a high quality output in time for the scheduled conference.\n\nDigital content served hot.\n\nNewgen is at the forefront of Event Based Publishing (EBP), delivering digital content instantaneously to customers, updated almost in real-time. By integrating modules of our editorial framework into our workflow management system, we ensure conformity with the publisher's house style. We also meet the required language standards by plugging in a module for language editing and we deliver structured and enriched content in a timely manner with our content processing scripts.\n\nWe provide our clients a positive user experience by moving complex work to the back-end, streamlining the process, and reducing manual intervention as well as the time to market. With the support of customized processes and tools, we ensure a seamless dispatch of legal content in real-time.\n\nWhen the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.\n\nClarity and comprehension are always at the forefront of our design, especially with regard to complicated mathematical and scientific diagrams. This was very evident in our partnership with Cambridge University Press for creating interactive mathematics content for 5-14 programme textbooks. Newgen deciphered and transformed hundreds of graphs and figures into perfect designs and illustrated charts. Our main objective was to enhance the learning experience of students and foster a love for the challenging subject that's mathematics.\n\nThe twin weapons of planning and execution.\n\nThe client, none other than the world's largest university press, faced a quandary. They had awarded a contract to Newgen but their existing supplier failed to cooperate during the transition. So we were left with the unenviable task of creating 300 templates for 60 journals. All within 30 days.\n\nNewgen rose to the occasion by working in multiple teams, each consisting of pre-editors, template engineers, paginators, quality control specialists and XML analysts, and headed by a single point of contact. Roping in offshore as well as onshore copy editing resources, we devised a smooth workflow to stay on top of the situation. The project was delivered without fuss – including a backlog of 3,000 articles that were made ready for publication.\n\nOn a war footing.\n\nPablo Kalmanovitz examines the origins of war and explores its contemporary relevance from a legal perspective. In The Laws of War in International Thought he reconstructs key moments in the intellectual history of the laws of war, from early modernity to nineteenth-century humanitarianism.\n\nThis ambitious title presented Newgen with an equally ambitious deadline. Newgen took on the challenge, managing over 35,000 changes and updates at the proof stage, validating corrections and minimizing the impact on cost and schedule. To the client's immense delight, the book hit the stands right on schedule.\n\nTime compliance for a flagship product.\n\nAcross Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan, Wolters Kluwer's Master Tax Guide is a voice of authority. Packed with tax rates, checklists, commentary and more, the guides are a must-have for accountants, tax lawyers, payroll officers and financial advisors.\n\nNewgen continually updates both print and online versions through the year to ensure that tax professionals have the latest updates on hand. With a five-week turnaround time for changes in print and a 24-hour turnaround time for the online version, we are constantly on our toes. We transfer content updates to the XML using a specialised tool to speed up the processing time. Given that the regional tax guides are high revenue-generating products, punctuality is of the essence.\n\nCreating order and disarray.\n\nThe problem facing the client was of data disarray – information was scattered across departments, without offering a unified view. Adding to the complexity, the process being followed did not allow for generic copy-paste workflow situations.\n\nNewgen created an online portal, a Wiki page that integrated all the available details and provided a transparent and complete picture. It populated information that would otherwise need transmission through a stream of links from one contact to another. The Wiki houses different pockets of the account, everything from style guides and samples to schedules and new requirements. Now, the customer's treasury of information has an easy, one-click stop.\n\nCarrying a teaching legacy forward.\n\nNewgen was commissioned to develop new material and update every unit of the University of Michigan’s Reader's Choice, 6th Edition, one of the world’s best loved ESL/EFL textbooks for the teaching of academic skills. Newgen's responsibilities in managing this complex textbook combining academic study skills and English Language Learning, included editorial project management, copy editing, typesetting, design, proofreading, interactive e-pub mapping and creation. Deadlines were stringent with 405 print pages to be delivered in seven months, with an interactive ePub version to be delivered a month later. Newgen’s hybrid approach was key in meeting the delivery challenge. Resourcing editorial project management and all editorial services onshore, and typesetting and ePub creation offshore, enabled the on-time delivery of this much-loved textbook within budget.\n\nOvercoming the challenges of online teaching.\n\nWhile online classes help teachers deliver lessons safely, there are other issues involved. Keeping students engaged and motivated, assessing and providing feedback, all of it becomes crucial. Newgen helped tackle these concerns in its important project for Pearson. It involved designing a new course for the UK market and reversioning three courses originally developed in the US. In building an online platform and updating video content, we reviewed the existing material and ran editorial checks to ensure appropriacy for the UK market. With deft changes in script and voice-over, we made the transition seamless.\n\nA visual metaphor of bonding.\n\nFive women, once strangers, form a meaningful bond. In essence, that's the storyline of a self-published book for which Newgen was tasked with a bespoke cover design. A heart-breaking yet funny novel, it involves mixed emotions like empathy, strength, and the beauty of love. It is set in modern-day Georgia and tells a tale of friendship that blossoms over time.\n\nOur art directors and visualizers sought to capture the mood of the book, be in tune with the genre, and reflect the aesthetic sensibilities of the intended reader. The award-winning cover design features five coffee mugs of different colours to symbolize the coming together of kindred spirits. Each mug is filled with black coffee, indicative of the things they share in their relationship. The choice of font and the setting of each word in a different size and format serve as a signpost that each character hails from a unique background.\n\nInternational travel during times of health crises.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the national public health agency of the United States. It publishes the Yellow Book (a health-related guide for international travellers) once in two years. This global resource for health professionals is well known for its accurate and up-to-date compilation of the US government's latest health guidelines related to international travel, including vaccination and precautionary measures.\n\nThe CDC Yellow Book is a complex 500+ page compilation with extensive maps, tables, figures, and charts. Newgen devised and managed a consistent, custom workflow across each edition for typesetting, art, XML, manufacturing and project management. There were multiple rounds of review with extended review periods at every stage. Newgen handled the rollout to perfection, accommodating extensive updates until the final stages of production."
