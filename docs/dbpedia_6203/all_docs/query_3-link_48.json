If you previously used UStat, this ID is different from the one your institution used in UStat, which was SUSHI-Exlibris. Ex Libris changed the ID for all existing customers for the May 2017 release. For institutions currently setting up Alma SUSHI accounts while still working in UStat (customers still implementing Alma), contact Elsevier customer support to ensure that your SUSHI-ALMA account is active. For these customers, Test Connection does not work for Elsevier, because Elsevier supports only one active account per institution and the UStat account is still active.
