        "text": "The types of jobs available in publishing vary widely. Graduates of our program are working as book and digital/magazine editors, marketers, and publicists, and in sales and audience development positions at major media and publishing companies. They also are employed at literary agencies and in a wide range of areas including audiobooks, podcasts, video, and more. The industry is so broad that the opportunities are almost limitless.\n\nThe degree differs from others in that we emphasize a knowledge of all key publishing functions, whereas other degrees offer concentrations in a specific area such as design or marketing and publicity. With the team-based focus of the publishing industry in mind, an immersive knowledge of content creation, marketing and distribution, and profitability is critical to student success.\n\nIn addition, we put a very strong focus on real-world, real-workplace industry learning and experience. While other degrees may emphasize publishing theory, the NYU SPS MS in Publishing encompasses both theory and practical, hands-on study of all key topics. Most assignments are simulations of tasks encountered in the workplace. Students are invited to visit publishing and media companies to gain an inside understanding of how businesses operate. Faculty members and guest speakers, all senior industry experts, introduce students to the latest business strategies and practices. A strong emphasis on networking, global trips to book fairs and conferences when available, and elective internships all contribute to a unique, industry-forward approach to preparing students for careers in publishing.\n\nThe skills and attributes required to succeed in publishing include curiosity and an interest in a wide range of topics. Publishing is a world of content and ideas, and a desire to shape and disseminate information is important. Those entering the industry need strong writing and communication skills, a knowledge of digital formats and assets including podcasts and video, and an understanding of marketing and social media, as well as sales and audience development, to name a few areas of expertise. As noted, this is a broad industry and the specific skills may vary according to position and the type of publishing or media business. Generally, digital media management and content management skills are important.\n\nThe NYU SPS MS in Publishing includes courses in book publishing as well as digital/magazine media. While book publishers create physical and digital books and media companies focus increasingly on digital-first (with some print) content, both use many of the same areas of expertise: good writing and communication skills, as well as a knowledge of marketing and audience development, sales, and distribution. Students may choose to focus their studies more on book publishing or digital/magazine media, but the skills are often transferable.\n\nYou need a graduate degree in publishing to enter the industry because this is a complex business with multiple skills and areas of expertise needed. The NYU SPS MS in Publishing degree introduces students to all key aspects of the industry through its areas of study as well as industry outreach. This deep and broad knowledge helps to make students highly valuable to employers. The reputation of the program for providing exceptionally well-trained students with practical skills is an important factor in hiring and promotion. Furthermore, the networking and industry outreach, faculty of leading publishing professionals, and internship opportunities are invaluable in opening doors and providing access that may otherwise be unattainable."
