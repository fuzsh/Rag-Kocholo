        "text": "PvP is as popular as ever in World of Warcraft Classic Season of Discovery, with vendors stocking new and returning items from Vanilla. If you’re looking to spend your gold or Marks of Honor, then you need to track down one of these vendors.\n\nBoth the Horde and Alliance factions have various PvP vendors scattered throughout Azeroth. While two PvP vendors are in either faction capital city, Stormwind and Orgrimmar, others can be found in the nearby leveling regions. If you’re looking for PvP vendors for your faction, here’s where you need to go.\n\nAll Horde PvP Vendors in WoW SoD\n\nHorde players currently have two accessible PvP vendors in World of Warcraft Classic Season of Discovery phase one. The first is Sergeant Ba’sha in Orgrimmar, while another is the NPC Kelm Hargunth in The Barrens.\n\nOrgrimmar PvP Vendor\n\nThe Orgrimmar PvP vendor can be found in the Horde capital city of Orgrimmar in the Valley of Strength. Located on top of the rise, you can find Sergeant Ba’sha just outside a nearby shack.\n\nSergeant Ba’sha sells PvP gear that becomes available as your PvP rank rises. Similar to player level, PvP rank is currently only limited to level three, so the majority of her stock won’t be available. For this vendor, you pay in gold instead of Marks.\n\nHorde Warsong Gulch Vendor\n\nThe Warsong Outriders supply officer can be found in the northern reaches of The Barrens. This vendor sells gear, runes, and other PvP related items that can either help power up your character or give you temporary buffs for combat. This vendor sells items in exchange for Marks rather than gold.\n\nAll Alliance PvP Vendors in WoW SoD\n\nSince PvP is currently limited to only a select few BGs, the Alliance similarly only has access to a few PvP vendors. You can find the general PvP vendor in the human capital city of Stormwind while the Silverwing Sentinels can be found in Ashenvale.\n\nStormwind PvP Vendor\n\nThe Alliance PvP vendor can be found in Stormwind, found near the southern part of the Old Town district. Here you can find Officer Areyn near the entry way to the SI:7. Here you can purchase various pieces of PvP gear sets, although much is still restricted due to the PvP level cap.\n\nSilverwing Sentinels Vendor"
