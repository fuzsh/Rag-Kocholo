No third-party cookies required.\n\nEmpowering publishers to sell audiences via direct deals more effectively\n\nOur publishers are benefitting from using their first-party data to drive direct deals. Trusted Media Brands (TMB) – home to publishing brands such as Reader’s Digest, Taste of Home, and The Pet Collective – were experiencing issues with scale and reaching users on their first visit across all browsers.\n\nPermutive supports TMB to sell more effectively through first-party data. TMB can now proactively bring their advertising partners insights about their audience and provide detailed mid- and post-campaign wrap-ups."
