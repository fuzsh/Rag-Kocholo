        "text": "Monthly Update\n\nOn December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule - PDF making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.\n\nThe Final Rule redefined the “national rate” as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution’s share of domestic deposits. The “national rate cap” is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.\n\nA less than well capitalized institution may use the “local rate cap” in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution’s local market area. The Final Rule redefined the “local rate cap” for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution’s local market area.\n\nIn accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution’s local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC’s request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.\n\nMonthly Rate Cap Information as of July 15, 2024\n\nDeposit ProductsNational Deposit RatesNational Deposit Rates\n\nRate Cap AdjustedTreasury YieldTreasury Yield\n\nRate Cap AdjustedNational Rate CapSavings0.451.205.336.086.08Interest Checking0.080.835.336.086.08Money Market0.661.415.336.086.081 month CD0.230.985.507.357.353 month CD1.532.285.467.307.306 month CD1.812.565.437.277.2712 month CD1.852.605.217.007.0024 month CD1.582.334.946.686.6836 month CD1.442.194.756.456.4548 month CD1.362.114.756.456.4560 month CD1.432.184.566.226.22\n\nThe FDIC began posting the National Rate and Rate Cap on May 18, 2009. Data is not available prior to May 18, 2009. Data from May 2009 through March 31, 2021, reflects the calculation in effect at that time (averages weighted by branch, and not including credit unions), while data posted after March 31, 2021, reflects the calculation described above.\n\nThis historical data can be accessed at Previous Rates.\n\nThe monthly rate cap information will be published every 3rd Monday of each month. When the 3rd Monday falls on a Federal holiday, the rate cap information will be published on the next business day. All published rates and yields are based on information available on the last business day of the prior month end (note: rates and yields published on April 1, 2021, are based on information available as of February 26, 2021)."
