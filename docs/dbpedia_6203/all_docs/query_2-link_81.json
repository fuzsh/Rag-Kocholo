(You can find a full list of traditional publishing companies in the US here.)\n\nWeigh the ins and outs and the pros and cons of hybrid publishing and determine what matters most to you.\n\nIf you’re looking for some options and want to dig a little deeper into what’s included and how much it will cost you, here is a list of publishers to evaluate.\n\nFor each hybrid publisher on the list, there are examples with links to the book page on the publisher’s website (if available) and to the book’s Amazon.com sales page.\n\nAlways do your own due diligence when carefully vetting a hybrid publisher for your book. Individual results may vary.\n\nI was shocked by just how many (and how few) Amazon reviews some of the books had. Some on this list have 7,000+. Others have fewer than 50.\n\nWhat makes a hybrid publisher reputable? How to find a reputable hybrid press?\n\nThe Independent Book Publishers Association (IBPA) spells it out the best."
