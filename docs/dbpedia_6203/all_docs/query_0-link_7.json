        "text": "You can pick up your badge at Will Call in the Crystal Palace the week leading up to and onsite at NYCC. We HIGHLY recommend that you pick up your badges when Will Call is open before the show as our Will Call line on Thursday can get quite long.\n\nWe also recommend you bring a printed copy of your email confirmation. We can accept digital copies, but if the line is long, we will take and keep your confirmation paper to get you out of line faster. Trust us; you’ll want to have a printed copy on hand if this happens.\n\nWill Call Hours:\n\nTuesday, Oct 15 – 5:00 PM – 8:00 PM\n\nWednesday, Oct 16 – 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM\n\nThursday, Oct 17 – 7:00 AM – 8:00 PM\n\nFriday, Oct 18 – 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM\n\nSaturday, Oct 19 – 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM\n\nSunday, Oct 20 – 7:00 AM – 5:00 PM\n\nAt NYCC and all ReedPop events, your health and safety are our top priorities. We’ve implemented new guidelines and policies to help support a safe experience. Every attendee, including fans, exhibitors, artists, guests, crew, and staff, are expected to comply with our health and safety requirements.\n\nHead over to our Safety, Security & Wellness page for our full list of safety guidelines and procedures.\n\nThe safety and security of our staff, exhibitors, and fans is our priority. We work closely with the venue, corporate security, state, local, and federal law enforcement authorities to identify risks, assess them, and develop security plans for our events.\n\nEveryone attending NYCC should be aware that the following are in place:\n\nSecurity may approach you to assist outside, at entry, or inside NYCC\n\nEveryone must wear their NYCC badge at all times. This includes exhibitors, vendors, fans (attendees), speakers, guests, artists, professionals, press, staff, and crew.\n\nSecurity procedures are fully operational at our events to keep the supervillains at bay\n\nBag checks are in operation at our events to keep out tesseracts and the like\n\nWalkthrough or hand held scanners may be in operation at our events\n\nCCTV in operation at our events is monitored and recorded\n\nUniformed and covert (secret identities ftw!)

We have your best interests at heart and want to get you inside the building as quickly as possible\n\nFollow the instructions of NYCC Staff at all times\n\nOn the final day you're attending NYCC, keep your badge as a souvenir or dispose of it inside the venue or when you've returned home. Don't sell it to scalpers who may be outside on the streets. Don't throw it away in trash cans outside the venue. Scalpers are sneaky and will find a way to grab it and upsell it to an unsuspecting fan who doesn't have a badge\n\nCarry a recognized form of photo ID at all times (of your actual identity, not your secret one)\n\nFailure to follow this policy may result in your removal from the convention without refund. This policy applies to any and all venues hosting New York Comic Con events.\n\nHate symbols are not permitted at NYCC, including as part of cosplay, and NYCC will not allow costumes that contain hate symbols or appropriate the symbolism of hate groups, including, but not limited to, historical/comic-related/satirical costumes that are associated with Nazis.\n\nAt the discretion of Security onsite, the following may be allowed:\n\nLightweight Plastic and Metal Shields\n\nLightweight Plastic/PVC Props/Lightsabers\n\nToy guns as long as they do not look like real ones, cannot function or shoot projectiles and have an orange tip on the barrel. The barrel of all prop firearms must be covered with brightly-colored caps.\n\nProp bows will be allowed providing all arrows have soft tips made of foam or cardboard and the bow itself is de-strung. If it is not, our security team will be de-stringing the bow.\n\nIf any of the above items are deemed unsafe by NYCC Security, they will not be allowed inside the building. If you're bringing, buying or selling something that could maim, damage or cause bodily harm, we're going to take issue. They will only be allowed as long as they are deemed safe and will not cause harm onsite.\n\nFor the most part, you’re welcome to take still pictures and video at New York Comic Con. Note that recording (including live-streaming apps) and flash photography are not permitted in panels, concerts or screenings. Recording and photos are also not permitted in certain parts of NYCC’s Autographing Area in Hall 1A. Please understand that guests may or may not pose for photographs with fans. Guests have a right to their privacy and if they ask not to have their picture taken, please respect their wishes.\n\nWe attract local, national and international press including Late Night with Seth Meyers, Entertainment Weekly, MTV, Newsarama, New York Post, People Magazine, The New York Times, TV Guide, USA Today, IGN, Screen Rant, and many more. In purchasing this badge and in consideration for being admitted to the Event, the holder consents to being recorded (by audio, visual and/or other means) for exhibition and exploitation by any means in all media now known or hereafter devised worldwide in perpetuity. Holder also hereby: (1) releases Reed Exhibitions from any liability for loss or damage to persons or property, infringement of any right or any other claim or course of action of any kind; (2) authorizes and permits Reed Exhibitions and its designees which include but are not limited to all sponsors, exhibitors and contractors to use and authorize the use of his/her name, voice, likeness and all reproductions thereof by any means and in all media now and hereafter know for all purposes worldwide in perpetuity; and (3) agrees to comply with all rules and regulations of the event. Holder agrees not to make any recordings of any kind at designated activities without the express written permission of Reed Exhibitions. We reserve the right to deny entry or remove from the event facilities any person who in our sole and absolute discretion is behaving or threatening to behave in a manner which we reasonably consider to be disruptive of the event.\n\nNYCC will feature hundreds of guests that will sign autographs in the Autograph Area, in Artist Alley, in private rooms and at various booths on the Show Floor. Guests will sign your NYCC Program Guide and only officially licensed Blu-rays/DVDs, comics, toys and other collectibles, but they will not sign bootleg merchandise. While some guests will sign autographs at no charge, this is ultimately up to the guests' individual discretion. Please bring only one item to be signed during each autograph session and understand that guests may or may not pose for photographs with fans.\n\nThere are a few reasons this could be happening. Here are a few troubleshooting tips for you!\n\nAlways check your spam folder. Always. And triple check your privacy settings! Whether your email service provider automatically filtered ReedPop emails out or you wanted to take a break, make sure you're set up to receive our incoming newsletters again.\n\nHave you unsubscribed from ReedPop newsletters in the past 2 years? If yes, we promise not to hold it against you. Just subscribe again! When our team adds new subscribers to our database, your email will be added. If not, you can reach out to our customer service team to get you back on track.\n\nPlease note: not all email service providers are created equally. If you are having trouble receiving our emails you may need to update your email or the service provider you use.\n\nFans are welcome to bring gifts for guests. However, we do have some guidelines. Guests will not be able to accept any gifts in Photo Ops. Fans can bring gifts to the Autographing Table where it can be given to the guest or passed along to the guest's handler for the guest to receive later. Guests will not accept food or drink items and outside alcohol is not allowed in the building. For all other gifts, our standard safety policies apply. When working on a gift for a guest, please remember that guests travel to events and are limited with what they can bring back with them. Any big or oversized gifts will most likely be left behind.\n\nTickets and/or badges (“Badges”) for the NYCC event (“Event”) are non-refundable and cannot be reproduced or upgraded. Badges may only be resold through the Lyte Ticket Exchange, and are otherwise non-transferable. The unauthorized resale or attempted resale of the Badge is prohibited and will constitute a forfeiture of the Badge without compensation. Each Badge must be used by the same person (the “Attendee”) for each day of the Event. The Event’s operating hours, schedules, guests and speakers are subject to change or cancellation without notice. Each Badge is a revocable license to attend the Event. All panels, autographing, photo ops, special events, show features and performances are subject to availability and access is not guaranteed and/or may require an additional fee. ReedPOP is not responsible for lost or stolen Badges. The Attendee acknowledges there are hazards and risks of physical injury or illness to Attendees of the Event and that not all such hazards or risks can be fully eliminated. By accepting this Badge and attending the Event, the Attendee freely and voluntarily agrees to assume the full risk of bodily injury or property damage, regardless of severity, or death that Attendee may sustain as a result of attending the Event, whether or not caused by the negligence or gross negligence of ReedPOP."
