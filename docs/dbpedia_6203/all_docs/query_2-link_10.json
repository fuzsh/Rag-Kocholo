        "text": "Welcome to Manhattan Book Group Publishers, award-winning New York City-based book publisher\n\nUnlike other publishers bearing the \"Hemingway\" name, Manhattan Book Group is actually endorsed by a notable Hemingway — Mariel Hemingway, the granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway.\n\nManhattan Book Group is a premier hybrid book publisher, hailed by USA Today as the \"top independent book publisher in New York City.\" We combine important aspects of traditional publishing and self-publishing to offer serious authors a viable full-service book publishing program, with an added twist…\n\nThe traditional side: Books are rigorously edited and professionally designed by an expert team. Titles are returnable via a major wholesale distributor (Ingram), meaning brick and mortar stores are more apt to stock those books. Authors enjoy the prestige of working with a NYC publishing house and receive full-service support.\n\nThe self-publishing side: Authors retain their publishing rights and their creative control. They also keep 100% royalties. Authors do not need representation from a literary agent.\n\nThe twist: Instead of promising our authors the moon and under-delivering, we stand by our services and GUARANTEE that the books of the authors we select for our proprietary author program will land on an Amazon Best Seller list and also garner media placements on major news outlets such as NBC, CBS, and Fox."
