        "text": "An independent media company since 1935, Yankee Publishing produces print, digital, and television media from beloved and enduring brands: The Old Farmer’s Almanac, Yankee, Family Tree, and New Hampshire Magazine.\n\nWe believe in the power of compelling stories and helpful information to inspire our customers and improve their lives.\n\nIn 1792, a farmer named Robert B. Thomas created his first Almanac, a 46-page pamphlet intended to be “useful, with a pleasant degree of humor.” In fulfillment of this mission, The Old Farmer’s Almanac has grown to as many as 288 pages and become the best-selling and most trusted almanac in America. From it has grown a family of publications: calendars, gardening and cooking books and magazines—even an Almanac for Kids! The Almanac has a dynamic digital presence, with e- and digital editions; Almanac.com, with an average of 11.5 million page views per month; and thousands of friends and fans on social media.\n\nTo know Yankee Magazine—and all the media platforms that make up the Yankee brand—is to be immersed in the most unique and cherished region in the country: New England. Yankee is closing in on its 90th year of telling New England’s story and guiding readers to the best travel, food, and secret places. Our NewEngland.com website is filled with curated travel tips, recipes, photos, and stories that you won’t find anywhere else. Users around the country interact with our Facebook and Instagram social media platforms. And Weekends with Yankee, our national PBS television series, brings New England’s most beautiful places and special experiences to life.\n\nYankee Publishing’s New Hampshire Group is the home of New Hampshire Magazine, New Hampshire Business Review, New Hampshire Home, New Hampshire Bride, and 603 Diversity magazine, as well as statewide events and programs such as “Best of New Hampshire” and the BOB (Best of Business) Awards. The New Hampshire Group also produces custom publications for organizations and businesses and executes digital marketing campaigns and services, including Web development, video production, and SEO.\n\nFamily Tree Magazine is America’s premier genealogy publication, highlighting key how-to guidance and resources for family historians of all experience levels. Family Tree shares expert advice about the best genealogy websites, records, software, and strategies through a magazine (both print and digital), an email newsletter, web articles, online courses and webinars, ebooks, digital downloads, and a podcast. We also offer a library of free family tree forms that will help you to organize your genealogy, plus guides to DNA testing and finding your ancestors from specific countries.\n\nJoin our team of creative writers, marketers, artists and professional administrative staff. At Yankee Publishing Inc., we are proud of our inviting and collaborative employee-owner culture, where we work in a hybrid environment, surrounded in an atmosphere of trust, respect, and light-hearted humor. We also take satisfaction in our efforts to protect the environment and in our contributions to our local communities.\n\nYankee Publishing is continuously looking toward the future of publishing, being adaptive to current trends and we are always searching for diverse talent who can bring energy and innovation to our teams and our business."
