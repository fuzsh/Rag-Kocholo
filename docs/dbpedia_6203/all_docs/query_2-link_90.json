        "text": "Dear Readers, Customers, Authors, and Friends:\n\nWe opened our doors in 2006 committed to bringing the world a broad mix of books. With 112 New York Times bestsellers, more than 12,000 books on our backlist, and over 400 titles planned for 2025, we've shown no signs of slowing down since 2011, when Publishers Weekly called us the fastest-growing small publisher in America.\n\nThe core categories of our Skyhorse imprint include outdoor sports, adventure, team sports, nature, and country living, with a strong dose of politics, public health, current events, true crime, history and military history, reference, and humor—practical, literary, and general trade. Whether you are looking for a guide to fly tying, a lively read about organized crime or the world of politics, or are actively trying to save the world, we hope you'll find what you are looking for on our list.\n\nWith twenty-six imprints, we publish children's books as Sky Pony Press, regional sports books from Sports Publishing, practical books for creative professionals from Allworth Press, and literary fiction and nonfiction from Arcade Publishing, including the 2012 Nobel Prize for Literature winner Mo Yan. In fall 2011, we began to copublish the Not For Tourists series of travel guides. In 2012, we introduced the Helios series on philosophy, religion, and psychology. In 2013, we added the science fiction and fantasy publishers Night Shade Books and Talos Press. In 2014, we acquired Good Books, which features the bestselling Fix-It and Forget-It series. In 2015, we launched Hot Books, offering important newsworthy books. In 2017, we added Clydesdale and Racehorse. In 2018, we launched Front Page Detectives and CrimeWise. In 2019, we acquired the World Almanac brand and brought it into the imprint family. Finally, in 2020, we partnered with Children’s Health Defense to create a series of public health books. Finally, in 2024, we acquired Regnery Publishing, incorporating their legendary backlist of conservative titles.\n\nSkyhorse is distributed by Simon & Schuster in the US, Canada, and overseas.\n\nI hope you enjoy reading our books as much as we enjoy publishing them.\n\nTony Lyons\n\nPublisher\n\nAbout President and Publisher Tony Lyons\n\nTony Lyons, President and Publisher at Skyhorse, and an attorney, was Publisher at The Lyons Press between 1997 and 2004. He founded Skyhorse in 2006 and has been involved with every aspect of the book publishing process. Starting with a small team of people, some of whom still work for Skyhorse, Tony has steadily built the company from a start-up to an increasingly prominent mid-sized publisher.\n\nAbout Skyhorse\n\nSkyhorse Publishing, one of the fastest-growing independent book publishers in the United States, was launched in September 2006 by Tony Lyons, former president and publisher of the Lyons Press. The company has had 112 New York Times bestsellers and has over 12,000 titles in print.\n\nSkyhorse is dedicated to publishing books that make people’s lives better, whether that means teaching them a hobby, bringing them a unique and important story, or encouraging them to fight against injustices, conspiracies, or abuses of power. The company maintains a firm stance against censorship and aims to provide a full spectrum of political, theological, cultural, and philosophical viewpoints to counter the increasingly biased environment in mainstream media.\n\nThrough its twenty-six imprints, Skyhorse publishes an eclectic and maverick list of titles. Its imprints — All Seasons Press, Allworth Press, Arcade CrimeWise, Arcade Publishing, Carrel Books, Children's Health Defense, Clydesdale Press, Final Battle Books, Front Page Detectives, Good Books, Helios Press, Hot Books, ICAN Press, Night Shade Books, Not For Tourists, Peakpoint Press, Racehorse For Young Readers, Racehorse Publishing, Regnery Publishing, Sky Pony Press, Sports Publishing, Talos Press, Yucca Publishing, Skyhorse Publishing, WarRoom Books, and World Almanac — cover everything from nature, sports, country living, history, reference, travel, humor, health, art, business, philosophy, religion, current events, politics, investigative and conspiracy, to fiction, literary nonfiction, science fiction, fantasy, and young adult and children’s literature. Its backlist includes more than ten thousand titles. Skyhorse is distributed by Simon & Schuster in the US and abroad.\n\nOur Mission Is:\n\nTo work hard, move fast, have fun, make money, and change lives for the better by publishing superior books on a wide range of topics from as many differing viewpoints as possible. To be passionate about the topics we publish, and to value honesty, integrity, mutual respect, and teamwork. To encourage personal and professional growth, celebrate initiative and creative thinking, and reward success.\n\nWhat others have to say about us:\n\n“Skyhorse is a family, not just a corporation. They work overtime to make every author shine.”\n\n–Elizabeth Cobbs, New York Times bestselling author\n\n“In the era of corporate dominated mainstream media and feckless herd reporting, Skyhorse's willingness to tackle tough issues that other publishers won't touch has made it a critical cog in our democracy.”\n\n–Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman of the board, Children’s Health Defense\n\n“[We] have the highest praise for Skyhorse Publishing and the joy of working with Publisher Tony Lyons and Group Editorial Director Mark Gompertz. Tony’s unconditional support for our book and his deep commitment to making the world a better place gave us the perfect home to create a New York Times bestselling children’s book series and the ability to reach countless families with our message.”\n\n–Julian Lennon & Bart Davis, New York Times bestselling authors\n\n“My experience with the Skyhorse team has been fantastic. They produced the book in record time before the scheduled date. It looks beautiful and is accurate in all respects. The editorial, technical, promotion, distribution and publicity teams have worked seamlessly together with great energy, talent and commitment. Thank you so much.”\n\n–Alan Dershowitz, New York Times bestselling author\n\n“You (Tony Lyons) are the last radical publisher left in the United States. It was once such a celebrated role. Now it’s reviled. But history will vindicate your commitment to free speech.”\n\n—Tucker Carlson\n\n“I've been writing exclusively for Skyhorse since 2008, when Tony Lyons published my first of five books with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. That's because Skyhorse is willing to take a chance on bringing out stories that other publishing houses shy away from. Their motto might be: Truth needs to be told, no matter how controversial. In my case, that's ranged from environmental criminals to alternative approaches for mental illness to who really killed JFK. I couldn't be more pleased with the results.”\n\n–Dick Russell, New York Times bestselling author\n\n“I can’t begin to tell you how gratifying it is to have such enthusiasm and great support from everyone at Skyhorse.”\n\n–Terry Goodkind, New York Times bestselling author\n\n“My first series became a New York Times bestselling children’s series, and that would have never happened without Skyhorse. . . . It’s a great feeling, having them at my side.”\n\n—Mark Cheverton, New York Times bestselling author\n\n“I now believe the best word to describe me as an author is spoiled. That’s because the folks at Sky Pony have truly made me feel special about being in their stable. My editor is top-notch, and has a unique way of making me feel like her most important author.”\n\n—Nancy Krulik, New York Times bestselling author\n\nTo Tony Lyons, Jon Arlan, Hector Carosso, Mark Gompertz, and my Skyhorse team who guided me through this morass of details to help me tell my story. I cannot imagine a more professional team exists in the publishing world.\n\n—Paul Manafort, author\n\n“Love working with you and your team!!”\n\n—Natalie Bubnis, Executive Producer, The View\n\n“I was fortunate enough to meet Tony Lyons, the publisher of Skyhorse Publishing through my literary agent, Jarred Weisfeld, last year. We struck the deal but kept it quiet until I had made significant inroads into finalizing the manuscripts. I say this with the greatest amount of respect to Tony: He is as much a rogue and renegade as I am. I am in awe of the work he does at Skyhorse to publish such a diverse and deep slate of titles each year. He is not afraid of printing what others won’t. That’s an amazing quality to possess as a publisher. Tony and I have big visions for the future, and we talk almost daily. He is a true storyteller and wants to publish books that make arguments in support of and against all kinds of controversial opinions and narratives. He is a rare commodity.”\n\n—Dylan Howard, VP and Chief Content Officer at American Media Inc., investigative journalist, and author\n\n“Tony Lyons is the perfect embodiment of an entrepreneurial spirit. He and his team at Skyhorse continue to take chances with authors and books in a way that others do not. Their fearless support and clever marketing of publications they believe in, can be especially appreciated by new authors trying to break through. My experience has been first rate from the beginning. Tony takes a personal interest in each of Skyhorse’s projects and his team is made up of professionals who bring a human touch to a process which can be unnecessarily brutal in other firms. Maybe one of the most impressive things about Skyhorse is that they not only bring wisdom and guidance to their publications, but they also listen. They allow the author to be heard and to be a part of the process. For me, the book I wrote was an adventure for sure—but the fun of working with Tony and his team in actually going through and understanding the art of getting a book published and marketed was equally meaningful. That was completely unexpected and greatly appreciated.”\n\n—Kent Heckenlively, author\n\n“First and foremost, Skyhorse took a chance on me as a first-time author, for which I'm extremely grateful. . . . The experience of working on and selling the book felt like an honest-to-God collaboration, and at no point did I feel like my voice was not being heard.”\n\n–Mike Bockoven, author\n\n“From the get-go, the Skyhorse editorial, marketing and sales, and publicity team championed my novel, The Promise. Two years after the first publication, the team continues to push the book with the same heartfelt and determined enthusiasm.”\n\n–Ann Weisgarber, author\n\n“I received this morning the latest (and second) book written by me and published by Skyhorse/Sports Publishing. I've had the great pleasure of working with a number of creative, multitalented, and sensitive book editors over my many years in the publishing world, but none more creative, more multitalented, more sensitive and a complete pleasure to deal with than the editor of this book, Jason Katzman. And it was Jason who early on saw the possibilities in Baseball's Best Ever, and then edited it with a fine, firm head, hand, and heart.”\n\n—Ira Berkow, author\n\n“My experience working with Skyhorse is always a positive collaboration. The editors are first-rate professionals, and my books receive top-shelf treatment. I truly appreciate our working relationship and hope it continues for years to come.”\n\n–David Fischer, author\n\n“It has been a pleasure watching Skyhorse Publishing develop into one of the largest and fastest-growing independent publishers over the last decade. Trident does a good deal of business with Skyhorse. Skyhorse has become a cornerstone of independent publishing and has taken its rightful seat in the world of major trade publishing.”\n\n–Robert Gottlieb, chairman of Trident Media Group, LLC\n\n“Skyhorse leads the book business in their categories with quality publishing and driven entrepreneurial spirit. Skyhorse customers, authors, and other business partners can expect high-energy relationships and a personal touch.”\n\n–Phil Ollila, President, Ingram Publisher Services\n\n“With our book in production, I want to acknowledge what should be obvious–your team has been excellent in every aspect. On our end, we’ve produced the book we hoped to at the start–in quality, title, cover, design…”\n\n–Mark Green, author, former public official, public interest lawyer\n\n“What a pleasure it has been for me to watch Skyhorse grow from an idea and a small loft room and a lot of sweat equity to a full-blown, diverse, exciting, and successful book-publishing firm. It has met a host of challenges, as all small publishers in their growing years have, and it has continued its commitment to publishing a broad range of books—from helpful practical books, like those on, say, gardening and cooking, to books with the widest possible public interest such as its edition of THE MUELLER REPORT. I take immense pride in my son Tony's vision and accomplishment. Startup publishing houses fail by the handful from the wicked challenges they face on all fronts. Tony has built a free-wheeling yet firm shop. It is the kind of place where any ambitious, talented, and hardworking editor, production or sales person can flourish. As a young editor, I'd have loved the excitement of working at Skyhorse.”\n\n—Nick Lyons, former founder and publisher of The Lyons Press\n\n\"I have had a long association with Tony and his father, Nick, both of whom are outstanding members of the publishing industry....Skyhorse Publishing is remarkably successful.\"\n\n—Martin Levin, former publisher of Times Mirror Publishing and a mergers and acquisitions guru\n\n\"I represented Tony and his father, Nick, when they sold their successful book publishing company, The Lyons Press. Tony was the CEO and head of the publishing program and did an extraordinary job as head of editorial and as head of operations. A few years ago, Tony started Skyhorse Publishing and it has grown into a recognized presence in the publishing industry.\"\n\n—Robert Halper, Publishing and mergers and acquisitions attorney\n\n\"I have watched Tony build Skyhorse from a start-up to a strong independent firm and his work ethic, negotiating skills, and intelligence are impressive.\"\n\n—William Rusin, VP and Director of Sales & Marketing, WW Norton\n\n\"Tony is a highly respected and successful member of the publishing world. Together with his father, Nick, he built and ultimately sold one of the finest small publishing companies in American. Then, in 2006, Tony founded Skyhorse Publishing, which, nurtured by his great determination, is one of the fastest growing publishing companies in the America.\"\n\n—M. Anthony May, former Managing Director, BNP Paribas\n\n\"Tony Lyons is a gentle rebel with a maverick spirit...Wise and whimsical, he's the antithesis of the corporate CEO...Loyal to the concept of presenting both sides of the argument, he's the Jacques Cousteau of publishers, setting up the building blocks for deeper exploration of an issue...\"\n\n—Randee Mia Berman, Huffington Post Blog\n\n“I was drawn to Arcade, the fabulous literary imprint of Skyhorse, for their tradition of publishing the most talented authors of our time – Samuel Beckett, John Irving, Umberto Eco, Mo Yan – an extraordinary list of names that I was humbled to join. . . And when it came time to package and sell the book, the whole Skyhorse team was onboard, from cover design to publicity to scheduling media. Skyhorse punches above its weight, I'm proud to be in their stable.”\n\n—Brian Castner, author\n\n\"I have worked with Skyhorse for almost five years, currently on my fourth book. Collaborating with Skyhorse feels like a partnership, rather than an employee-employer dynamic. They allow me to have a voice in the entire publishing process, from contract negotiation to editing, design/layout, printing, and promotion. Issues are tended to swiftly and efficiently. Skyhorse is generous with distributing review copies.\"\n\n—Susan Crowther, author\n\n“As a first-time author, the attention to detail by the editors, the engagement of the publicist, the gorgeous cover design, and the continuous contact of the Skyhorse team with me before, during, and after publication have been major factors in the success of my book. Skyhorse Publishing is going places.”\n\n–Sabeeha Rehman, author\n\n\"I think, as an author, the two things you want from a publisher are the freedom to pursue a project in the way you envision it, but also the guidance to help navigate the thorny questions that always come up in the process of writing. That's been the great part of working with Skyhorse--the freedom you are afforded to carve your own path, but the wisdom offered when needed to make the work as good as it can be.\"\n\n–Sean Deveney, author\n\n“It is heartening to know that Skyhorse is capable of presenting outdoor titles with a respect that is exceptional in today's publishing industry.”\n\n–Thomas McIntyre, author\n\n“Publishing my first trade book with Skyhorse was a great experience. They gave me tremendous creative freedom and yet offered superb editing assistance. I’m so happy with the final product and have benefitted greatly from Skyhorse’s respected reputation and publicity network.”\n\n–Henry Hughes, author\n\n“Skyhorse allowed a lot of creative freedom to produce the food shots as I wanted, yet gave me great feedback to make the final product fantastic. . . . They communicate what they need and respond back quickly if I have questions.”\n\n–Bonnie Matthews, author/photographer"
