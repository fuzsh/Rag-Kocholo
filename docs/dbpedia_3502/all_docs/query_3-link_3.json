        "text": "The Bravo limited series SWV & XSCAPE: The Queens of R&B is taking us all on a journey back through some of the best of '90s R&B music. But while both girl groups became icons in that decade, their hits are still reliably played today. In fact, SWV is still performing its top songs before thousands of screaming fans three decades later.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nCatch up on SWV & XSCAPE: The Queens of R&B on Peacock or the Bravo App.\n\nListen to the best SWV songs now and learn more about the inspiration behind these hits.\n\n\"Weak\" by SWV\n\nSWV has been nominated for three Grammys over the years and has seen 12 songs make it on Billboard’s Hot 100, including four top 10 hits. Among those number one hits is “Weak,\" which first debuted on April 24, 1993 and peaked at number one for two weeks, spending 26 weeks total on the chart.\n\n\"Weak,\" SWV's most well-known song, was written and produced by Brian Alexander Morgan for the group’s debut album It’s About Time. In an interview with Complex in September 2014, Morgan admitted it’s a love song he wrote borne out of a crush on artist Chante Moore — and she still might not know it’s about her.\n\n“I’ve had that conversation with people in her life, but not her directly,” Morgan told Complex.\n\n“Weak” was originally written for singer Charlie Wilson, but he passed on what turned out to be a hit song for SWV. SWV confirmed this rumor when they spoke with 107.5 WBLS radio station in New York in January 2016.\n\n“It made it to him, but it’s just one of those songs that didn’t get it,” Leanne “Lelee” Lyons said, to which Tamara “Taj” Johnson-George added, “Thank God!”\n\nMorgan also admitted he initially had Wilson in mind for the ballad.\n\n“With 'Weak,' I was trying to capture Charlie Wilson’s vibe. For my whole life, Charlie and the Gap Band had influenced me so much, and there was a record they had out at that point called ‘Wednesday Lover,’” Morgan told Complex. “I was just fascinated with that record.”\n\nSoon after writing the hit, Morgan got a FedEx package of demos from a group of girls who turned out to be SWV.\n\n“I heard Coko’s voice. And I was like, ‘Uh oh. This girl gonna be a problem,’” Morgan told Complex. “And again, I thought about the connection between ‘Computer Love’ and ‘Weak.’ I wrote the song for Charlie [Wilson], but I thought Coko’s voice sounded like Shirley Murdock, who was on ‘Computer Love’ with Charlie. So, Kenny is like, ‘Would you please come to New York and record them so I can get them this deal?’ So, I recorded the demos, they got the deal, and then we just started making the album.”\n\n“Weak” ended the two-months long reign of Janet Jackson’s “That’s The Way Love Goes” on the Hot 100, selling more than 1 million copies in the U.S. The song was also awarded a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nIn fact, Billboard named the song number 72 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.\n\nThe song has transcended decades and generations: It was covered by teen artist JoJo on her self-titled debut album in 2004.\n\nBut that’s not the only song fans know and love from SWV.\n\n\"Right Here (Human Nature Remix)\" by SWV\n\nSWV's song “Right Here (Human Nature)” peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of Oct. 2, 1993, falling just behind “Dreamlover” by Mariah Carey.\n\nThe song evolved out of “Right Here,” the debut single from the group’s debut album. While \"Right Here\" was a hit, the remixed version, which was based on a sample of Michael Jackson’s 1982 song “Human Nature,” sold 1 million copies and earned a platinum certification from the RIAA.\n\nIn 2017, Billboard named it number 17 on their list of “100 Greatest Girl Group Songs Of All Time.”\n\nRELATED: How To Follow The SWV & XSCAPE: The Queens of R&B Cast on Instagram (And Why!)\n\nThe song may have spent 22 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, but it wasn’t initially a hit with the group.\n\n“We hated that song,” Cheryl “Coko” Gamble said in a 2014 interview with “Sway’s Universe” on Sirius XM. “We thought it was going to mess up our career. That remix right there? Oh, we were so upset.”\n\nLeLee agreed with Coko — while Taj protested she liked it.\n\n“It just sounded boring,” LeLee said during the radio interview. “And we were like, if it didn’t have a hot beat, they were going to kill us, we’re representing the hood.”\n\nThe group conceded their judgment on the song’s popularity was off, with Coko admitting, “We were wrong many times.”\n\n\"You're The One\" by SWV\n\nSWV’s song “You’re The One” peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, spending 20 weeks on the chart. The single sold 900,000 copies domestically and was certified Gold by the RIAA.\n\nThe song, which from the group’s second album \"New Beginning,\" has remained popular for decades. The hit has been sampled in 10 other songs and remixed in six songs, according to the website WhoSampled.com.\n\nWhile you're on an SWV song kick, make sure to check out more of SWV’s biggest hit songs, including, “I’m So Into You,” “Use Your Heart,” “Someone,” “It’s All About U,” “Always On My Mind,” “Can We,” “Rain” and “Right Here.”"
