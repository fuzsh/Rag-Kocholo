        "text": "ABOUT ERIC\n\nEric Knight is a world-class veteran saxophonist who has recorded, performed, and toured major acts such as The Rolling Stones, Prince, J. Lo, Etta James, Hiram Bullock, Randy Brecker, and the list goes on….\n\nEric grew up 40 miles north of NYC in Rockland County. He started playing the saxophone and studying music intensely at the age of 11 when he entered 6th grade. By 7th grade he was playing in the high school bands and by 10th grade he was invited to play in Nyack College’s Orchestra. Knight attended Western Michigan University on a music scholarship from 1996 through 1998. His focus was on jazz studies and performance.\n\nAt the age of 16, Eric started venturing out to perform in public by “sitting-in” with jazz, blues, and rock bands at dozens of different NYC venues to start honing his craft. One of his favorite memories is sitting in on a few tunes with the legendary Doc Cheatham and his band at the old famous jazz club “Sweet Basil’s” in Greenwich Village which closed in 2001.\n\nAttending all these types of “jam sessions” led to Knight making relationships with some of the top working live & session musicians in NYC during the late 90’s. Then the professional gig calls started coming in! One awesome gig that comes to mind was playing horn section parts with Mark Pender (Trumpeter with Max Weinberg 7) for Glen Burtnick’s Xmas Xtravaganza which put Eric on stage performing with Patty Smyth, Phoebe Snow, STYX, Patti Smith, Marshal Crenshaw, John Waite, among many others!\n\nAnother epic and unforgettable experience for Knight was having the honor and privilege to open for Grover Washington Jr. for a few shows in New Jersey. In Eric’s opinion, Grover was the Godfather of the smooth jazz format and will always be one of his top musical heroes.\n\nDuring the spring of 2000 he was given the opportunity to audition for the 1st national tour of a Broadway Show called, “SWING!” that debuted at the St. James Theatre in 1999. After being offered and accepting the Alto sax chair he went on to perform in the show from the fall of 2000 through the spring of 2003 touring all over the US and for a couple of months in Japan during the summer of 2002.\n\nIn 2004 he received a call from Hiram Bullock and was asked to play horn section parts on a few tracks along side Randy Brecker and Donny McCaslin on Hiram’s 2005 release called “Too Funky 2 Ignore”. Eric is also a featured soloist on the title track of the record, “Too Funky 2 Ignore”.\n\nWhile traveling on tour Eric became close friends with the shows musical director & pianist, Doug Oberhamer as well as one of the shows guitarist’s, Sean Harkness. In 2008 Sean and Eric paired up and recorded a Contemporary Jazz album called, “Harkness Knight” which was released in June of 2009. Besides Sean & Eric, this album featured the talents of some amazing drummers such as Joel Rosenblatt (Spyro Gyra), Jonathan Mover (Marillion & GTR), Ricky Lawson (Michael Jackson & Stevie Wonder), Simon Phillips (Toto, Jeff Beck) Thierry Arpino (Larry Coryell & Jean-Luck Ponty), and Jeff Haynes (Pat Metheny & Harry Belafonte) on percussion.\n\nThen in 2022, Eric and his long time friend Doug Oberhamer got together and created a smooth jazz band called KnightHammer! Their first single called, “Kickin’ It” debuted in July and has been played on radio stations all over the world. Then in September they released their 2nd single called “Afterglow” which is a more intimate feature of Knight’s sound and approach on sax. KnightHammer will be releasing two more single’s before this year is up, the first one of which will be an original Christmas song called “Christmas, I Love You” followed by another original called, “Beyond the Vista”.\n\nIn early 2023 Eric will be releasing his debut album called “Cover to Cover - Vol. 1” which is being co-produced and mixed by Multi-Platinum Drummer/Programmer Steven Wolf (Grover Washington Jr., David Bowie, Chaka Khan, P!nk, Katy Perry, Beyonce, Aretha Franklin, Miley Cyrus), Yaron Fuchs (Herbie Hancock, John Mayer, Sting, Paul Simon, Brian McKnight), and Spencer Hattendorf (Ariana Grande, Megan Thee Stallion, Jimmy Fallon)."
