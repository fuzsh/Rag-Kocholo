        "text": "For better or worse ’90s R&B will forever be associated with the excesses of the New Jack Swing (NJS) movement. The bright colors, puffy seams and gaudy jewelry became par for the course as hip hop and a revival of vocal harmony swept through R&B.\n\nNew Jack Swing was initially a boy’s club, but the ladies would soon prove that rap’s posturing and bravado could be done with a feminine touch. SWV or Sisters With Voices would be a fitting acronym for one of the first and most successful female NJS acts. Composed of Cheryl Gamble, Tamara Johnson and Leanne Lyons the New York based trio first met as a gospel group then were discovered by Teddy Riley the presumed father of NJS. Their chemistry together helped make them one of the biggest R&B acts of the ’90s and it all started with It’s About Time.\n\nThe album’s title could have been as much a statement about the status of R&B’s male dominated monopoly on R&B and the NJS movement. SWV’s debut employed a team of producers some of whom worked on hits for established artists like Martha Wash and Lalah Hathaway. SWV’s timing was important in that they were one of the first female NJS acts, but they were not limited to the styles limitations.\n\nTracks like ‘I’m So into You” is classic NJS, but the trio’s ability to combine the gruffer elements of a pertend street life with the slickness of R&B made their appeal spread beyond one genre. There was something for nearly everyone, the guys especially who formerly had to watch their girlfriends swoon over a twinkish Bobby Brown or Teddy Riley.\n\nOne of the albums high points came late with a the single “Right Here” featuring a Teddy Riley remix of Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature”. That single put SWV on the pop charts after other singles were still lingering at various points of the R&B charts for what seemed like a solid year. The string of singles that came before “Right Here” established SWV as something of a crossover act, a sign of things to come as hip hop was carrying R&B with it on to the mainstream pop charts (and pop radio).\n\nThe album has some odd repetitions in the form of acappella and or instrumentals that suggested a shallow bench of original material. It makes me wonder if the plan was to initially release a few singles and be done with it as was the case with most single centered R&B of the day. Instead, Sony Music found themselves with a surprise hit with 6 successful singles and unusually strong album sales for a pegged R&B act.\n\nFor early ’90s R&B, It’s About Time has aged better than torn jean shorts and stain washed jackets in the album’s cover photo. That’s likely because attempts at rap like “SWV (In the House)” were cut to a minimum while vocal performances on tracks like “Anything” are kept front and center. Ironically the short rap from “In the House” was credited to a very young Pharrell Williams. I suspect that many of the studio musicians were the same ones who worked with Teddy Riley and were always in the background somewhere. That Riley influence could be heard on tracks like the wonderful “You’re Always On My Mind”.\n\nStill, if you were old enough to remember it when new, It’s About Time was one of the better examples of the merger of hip hop and R&B. SWV essentially became the template for many other girl groups that projected the street hardness of hip hop while emphasizing the smooth harmonies of R&B. They were one of the first of their kind and remained one of the best until the gold sheen of New Jack Swing faded by the decade’s end."
