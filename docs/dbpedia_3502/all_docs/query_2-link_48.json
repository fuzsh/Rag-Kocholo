        "text": "The Christmas season is upon us and you've probably already grown tired of hearing the radio and your local stores playing all the same Christmas songs over and over again. Our goal here is to broaden your horizons and help you find an R&B Christmas album that will help get you into the holidays again.\n\nWe're not playing favorites here, just helping you track down the albums you might want to listen to. In the coming weeks, we will like offer a follow-up list of the best R&B Christmas albums. But for now, we'll let you discover it for yourself.\n\nThis list has it all. For traditionalists, you've got stuff like Christmas with Babyface, which features mostly conventional classic Christmas songs with an R&B twist. For the adventurous, we have fun, creative albums like 12 Soulful Nights of Christmas featuring a variety of artists from So So Def.\n\nNo matter your tastes, there is bound to be a great R&B Christmas album for you. So check them out below and be sure to share your favorites!\n\nReleased in 1988, My Gift to You is very much a product of the 80s, featuring synthesizers and programmed rhythms alongside its takes on classic songs like Winter Wonderland and Little Drummer Boy.\n\nFeaturing the group's great harmonies, An All-4-One Christmas provides the 90s R&B group sound to classic Christmas songs.\n\nChristmas Fantasy was the final studio album by Anita Baker, and was released in 2005. It features some originals like \"Moonlight Sleighride\" and \"Family of Man\" as well as your usual numbers like \"I'll Be Home For Christmas.\"\n\nHamilton provides a mix of classic Christmas songs and originals, but is able to fit each track to his welcoming voice. It's a great line-up of tracks that will get you ready for Christmas.\n\nThe first of two Christmas albums by Ashanti, the album features several originals like \"Christmas Time Again,\" \"Hey Santa,\" and \"Time of Year.\"\n\nBabyface's voice provides that soothing sound that is perfect for a Christmas album. There aren't many original tracks on here, but he does the classics like only Babyface can.\n\nBoyz II Men's Christmas album features a lot of original productions by the group, and included a lot of collaborations with other legend, Brian McKnight.\n\nBrian McKnight regularly features a religious song on his albums, so it should be expected that he would have a holiday album. A family affair, Brian McKnight features a lot of his family and friends on this line up of tracks.\n\nFor his second Christmas album, Brian McKnight explored more commercial Chistmas tracks, but they sound as good as ever.\n\nReleased in 2017, Chante Moore offers some sultry sounds for a Christmas album. The album's lead single \"Cover Me In Snow,\" offered more allure than you might normally expect for a Christmas record.\n\nDestiny's Child puts some hip feel into their Christmas album, fully embracing the commercial side of the holiday. It's a fun album that fits with the group's style.\n\nThis album isn't for those who are looking for the classics, but if you're tired of hearing the same old Christmas songs, it's the perfect album for you. A wide variety of original songs tailored to their singers (including Alicia Keys, Gerald Levert, Xscape, and more) makes for a unique Christmas album.\n\nA blend of classic and original Christmas songs, this record brings together the team of artists at LaFace. Toni Braxton, Usher, and A Few Good Men are just some of the voices featured here.\n\nA short EP, but with great sounds. White Christmas by Silk is such a fun listen, it's worth the admission just for it."
