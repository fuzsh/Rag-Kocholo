        "text": "\"My Favorite Things\" is a popular show tune, originally from the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music. In recent times, due to the winter-related imagery in the lyrics, it has become popular as a Christmas song.\n\nContents[]\n\n[hide] *1 The Sound of Music version\n\n1.1 John Coltrane\n\n1.2 A Christmas song\n\n2 Other cover versions\n\n3 References\n\n4 External links\n\nThe Sound of Music version[edit][]\n\nThe song was first introduced by Mary Martin and Patricia Neway in the original Broadway production and sung by Julie Andrews in The Garry Moore Show's 1961 Christmas special and the 1965 film.\n\nIn the musical, the lyrics to the song are a reference to things Maria loves, such as \"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens\". These are the things she selects to fill her mind with when times are bad.\n\nThe original Broadway musical places this song in the Mother Abbess's office, just before she sends Maria to serve Captain von Trapp's family as governess to his seven children. However, Ernest Lehman, the screenwriter for the film adaptation, repositioned this song so that Maria would sing it with the children during the thunderstorm scene in her bedroom, replacing \"The Lonely Goatherd\", which had originally been sung at this point. Many stage productions also make this change, shifting \"The Lonely Goatherd\" to another scene.\n\nThe first section of the melody has the distinctive property of using only the notes 1, 2, and 5 (Do, Re, and So) of the scale. Rodgers then harmonized this same section of the melody differently in different stanzas, using a series of minor triads one time and major triads the next. This song has 16 bars of D minor 7, followed by eight bars of E b minor 7 and another eight of D minor 7. Thus, it has an AABA structure.\n\nThe happy, optimistic lyrics---\"Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudel\"---are just a counterpoint and cover up an undercurrent of fear. As noted above, the song was written to be sung by a young woman scared of facing new responsibilities outside the convent. In the film script the song is repositioned, with Maria singing it to the von Trapp children during the thunderstorm; but the terror contained in the melody is still the dominant emotion.\n\nThe song ends with a borrowed line of lyric and notes from Rodgers' earlier composition with Lorenz Hart, \"Glad to Be Unhappy\", a standard about finding peace in the midst of unrequited love. Using the same two notes for the phrasing of \"so sad\" in the original song, Rodgers brings the gloom of my \"Favorite Things\" to a similar upbeat ending-–-\"and then I don't feel so bad.\"\n\nIn 2004 the movie version of \"My Favorite Things\" finished at #64 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.\n\nJohn Coltrane[edit][]\n\nJazz artist John Coltrane did an extended, close to fourteen-minute version in E minor on his 1961 album taken from the title of the song. It became a jazz classic and a signature for Coltrane in concert, also appearing on Newport '63 in 1963, Live at the Half Note: One Down, One Up in 1965 and Live at the Village Vanguard Again! andOffering: Live at Temple University in 1966. Coltrane's version differs significantly from the song as originally conceived, using modal patterns and being much darker and more frenzied in feel.\n\nA Christmas song[edit][]\n\nThe wintertime imagery of the lyrics has made \"My Favorite Things\" a popular selection during the Christmas Holiday season. It has appeared on many Christmas albums, including:\n\n1964: Jack Jones on his album The Jack Jones Christmas Album\n\n1965: Eddie Fisher on his album Mary Christmas\n\n1965: Diana Ross and the Supremes on their album Merry Christmas\n\n1965: Andy Williams on his album Merry Christmas.

The lyrics in the bridge also directly satirize the lyrics of My Favorite Things.\n\nSoul Jazz pioneer Grant Green covered the song on his 1979 album Matador."
