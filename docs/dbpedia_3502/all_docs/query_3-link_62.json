        "text": "Okay, Verzuz must have read my last article about how I felt the series was on the downslide because the last few matchups have been lackluster, because they have been stepping it up and it looks like the momentum for interest in the \"battle\" series is at a fever pitch.\n\nJust days after revealing that The Isley Brothers will go up against Earth Wind And Fire on Easter Sunday, Verzuz revealed its next R&B matchup which will feature two of the 90's biggest selling girl groups!\n\nOn May 8th, SWV will head up against XScape to see who had more HITS in their catalog!\n\nSWV aka \"Sisters With Voices\" exploded onto the scene in the early 90s with their brand of R&B infused with hip hop. They went on to sell over 25 million records worldwide with smash hits like \"I'm So Into You\", \"Right Here (Human Nature Mix)\" and the timeless classic \"Weak\".\n\nWhile SWV repped NYC, down south in ATL at around the same time, XScape got the ball rolling on their monumental success. The group formed in 1992 and the ladies gained success quickly even though they only released 3 official albums together and the group broke up in 1998 (the same year SWV disbanded), all of their albums sold over 1 million copies. With hits like \"Just Kickin It\", \"Who Can I Run To?\" and \"Understanding\" XScape's catalog still holds up strong!\n\nSo WHOOO you got in this battle?"
