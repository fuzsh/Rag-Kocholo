Check ’em out!\n\nGotta shout out Olu for today’s entry – SWV’s A Special Christmas is one of my mom’s Christmas staples. Olu’s definitely got good tastes.\n\nOlu said: “Simply put, true R&B artist’s soulful voices are tailor-made for Christmas music. Their Christmas album separated itself from the pack with Coko’s incomparable, heartfelt rendition of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.” You *felt* every note. Listen to the rest of the album (complete with original songs) and realize why these ladies absolutely embodied the mid-90’s R&B scene. Let’s cherish that special times time when artists briefly departed from the commercially popular to bring heart & soul to the greatest holiday.”"
