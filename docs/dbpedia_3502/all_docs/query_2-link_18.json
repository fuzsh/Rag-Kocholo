        "text": "SWV have a new hit single, the sultry “Ain’t No Man.” What they no longer have is their reality TV show, “SWV: Reunited.” The group announced that its We TV run has ended after two seasons.\n\nWe TV has been mum on the situation.\n\n“When we started production on that show we thought it would be a way to introduce our fans to another side of us, but it wasn’t the side we wanted them to see,” says member Tamara “Taj” Johnson-George. “In our minds we think it hurt us more than it helped.”\n\nRELATED: Jill Scott comes home for a holiday concert\n\nThe second-season premiere of “SWV: Reunited” scored over a million viewers in August 2014. But, “no more acting,” says member Cheryl “Coko” Clemons.\n\nTV aside, the New York City-raised songbirds — whose 1990s hits include “Weak,” “You’re the One,” and “I’m So Into You” — will play Saturday with Jill Scott,New Edition, Tyrese and Jazmine Sullivanin the WDAS Holiday Jamat the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nThe Sisters also have the upcoming album, “Still,” due Feb. 5 on Entertainment One Music. That date is also New Edition member Bobby Brown’s birthday, Johnson-George notes.\n\n“I didn’t plan that,” says Johnson-George, a big New Edition fan, “but God must have heard me!”\n\nSee them live:"
