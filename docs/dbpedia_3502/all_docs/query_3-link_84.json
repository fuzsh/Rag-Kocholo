They were an R&B girl group from the 90's.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWV\n\nTheir big hit was Weak:\n\nI like a lot of the 90's New Jack/R&B sound so I bought their Best Of compilation on a whim...\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/best-of-swv-mw0000015629\n\nand I was surprised at just how good they sounded on these hits! There's really not a bad song on this compilation. I'll have to pick up their first two proper albums.\n\nHighly recommended if you're into 90's R&B and want to hear something that may have passed under your radar the first time around!\n\nI picked up their first two albums \"It's About Time\" and \"New Beginning\" on Amazon Marketplace cheap because they both got good reviews on AllMusic.com.\n\nWell worth the $8 total I spent for both of them. Both are solid throughout.\n\nThey apparently released a comeback album in 2012 called I Missed Us that got a very positive review on AllMusic.com.\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/i-missed-us-mw0002320271\n\nAlso, the title track samples music from The Legend of Zelda of all things (!). It's pretty cool.\n\nThe Zelda music:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IljKQ1BdHKI"
