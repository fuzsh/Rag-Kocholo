        "text": "Popular singer Brenda Lee, known as \"Little Miss Dynamite,\" stood 4 foot 11 inches tall — but was 5 foot 6 if you counted her beehive hairdo, Topekan Marshall Barber jokingly recalls.\n\nLee made history this week when her song “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” topped the Hot 100 singles chart maintained by Billboard Magazine for the first time, 65 years after being released.\n\nThat set a record for the longest wait between a song's release and it first topping the charts.\n\nBarber recalled Wednesday how Lee signed autographs in the early 1960s at Topeka's Katz Drug Store as part of a promotional event arranged by KTOP-AM Radio, where his father, Bob Barber, was a disc jockey.\n\nMarshall Barber, who accompanied his father to that event, went on to become a well-known Topeka radio announcer. He now works as a Realtor.\n\nBarber said he also saw Lee perform in the 1990s at Horton's Golden Eagle Casino, “and she was tops!\"\n\nThat performance took place on Dec. 4, 1998, says an online database documenting her concerts in the 1990s.\n\nTwenty-five years later to the day, on Monday, \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\"New Old-Fashioned No. 1\" said the headline for Billboard's online story sharing that news while referring to her use of the phrase \"new old-fashioned way\" in \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.\"\n\nHow old was Brenda Lee when she sang 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree'?\n\nLee was 13 years old when she recorded \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" in 1958.\n\nIt was written specifically for her by Johnny Marks, who also created other Christmas classics that included \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" and \"A Holly Jolly Christmas,\" according to Billboard.\n\n\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" first hit the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960, when it topped out at No. 14.\n\nThe song was played prominently in the 1990 classic Christmas movie \"Home Alone.\"\n\nIt spent nine weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 at different times during the holiday seasons between 2019 and 2022.\n\nWho is in Brenda Lee's video for 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree'?\n\nMeanwhile, Lee has enjoyed a long career that's included hitting No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 twice, in 1960, with \"I'm Sorry\" and \"I Want to be Wanted.\"\n\nThat makes \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" her third song to top the Hot 100.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard, Lee credited her record label, UMG Nashville, with going to bat for her to help her top the charts this month.\n\nTo mark this year's 65th anniversary of the song, Lee at last put out an official music video for \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" featuring herself and country stars Tanya Tucker and Trisha Yearwood.\n\nLee's song is among five Christmas songs currently on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe others are Bobby Helms’ \"Jingle Bell Rock\" (No. 4), Wham!’s \"Last Christmas\" (No. 5), Burl Ives’ \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" (No. 6) and Andy Williams’ \"It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" (No. 10).\n\nContact Tim Hrenchir at threnchir@gannett.com or 785-213-5934."
