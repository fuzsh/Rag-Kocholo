        "text": "As someone who emblazons his social media profiles with the harshest disses he's ever received, rather than hiding from them, I can really relate to the artwork on Money Makin Nique and Reese's new jam. Their \"SWV\" artwork consists of a screenshot of angry texts directed at Nique, and the song itself is just as entertaining.\n\nSampling a song by the '90s Atlanta girl group its title references, \"SWV\" slows things down to a syrupy pace, letting the two young bucks spit over the downtuned vocals for the entire song. Nique's Bimmer Candidate Project arrives later this year, and be sure to check out Reese's recent \"Yesterday\" video.\n\nLookin' at you lookin' at me stunt from the outside\n\nPants all unzipped and got your honey on my southside\n\nBezel on my westside, ring on my eastside\n\nPistol tucked in case I gotta flip you on your b-side"
