The trio sold over 25 million albums worldwide, making them one of the best-selling female R&B groups of all time.\n\nAside from remarkable performances from Xscape and SWV, the Queens of R&B also features outstanding sets from esteemed soloist Mya, who was basically it girl of the 90s and 2000s. She dropped several iconic Billboard Hot 100 hits like “It’s All About Me,” “Take Me There,” “Case of the Ex,” and “Lady Marmalade.” Mya continued releasing new music, with her latest single, “Anytime,” released in 2024.\n\nSee Mya, along with beloved girl groups 702 and Total, as they hype up the crowd for Xscape and SWV.\n\nWitness these queens provide top-tier entertainment as they light up the Blossom Music Center with outstanding music!
