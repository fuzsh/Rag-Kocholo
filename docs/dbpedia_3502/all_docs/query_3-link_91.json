        "text": "I cling to the fact that I’m an 80’s baby, even though I was introduced to the world in the last month of the last year of the decade. So, musically speaking, I was really “born into the 90’s” (like R. Kelly’s debut album), and I thus have a special fondness for the R&B of that era.\n\nAside from the nostalgia factor, the music was actually good and the singers really sang. R&B fans were given timeless music by solo artists like Brian McKnight, Monica, Babyface, and Mary J. Blige, in addition to groups such as Boyz II Men, SWV, Dru Hill and En Vogue. We fell in love with gems created during that time period including Whitney Houston’s powerful rendition of “I Will Always You” (1992), Montell Jordan’s instant party starter, “This is How We Do It” (1995), Kenny Lattimore’s wedding staple, “For You” (1997), and Deborah Cox’s soul-stirring “Nobody’s Supposed to Be Here” (1998).\n\nSadly, though, the last decade (the mid 2000’s to now in 2014) has hardly produced R&B classics of that magnitude. There have been more than enough catchy radio hits but not enough songs that will stand the test of time. To that end, several artists have weighed in on “the state of R&B” conversation in recent years, most of whom say there’s been a tremendous change in the music, namely, digression instead of progression.\n\nFor instance, the style has become diluted because nobody’s really singing from the soul now. Rappers are singing (thanks to auto-tune) and singers are rapping, or at least trying to. Also, artists who had started out strictly urban i.e. Ne-Yo have concentrated their efforts on pleasing the pop crowd and are just now coming back to their R&B fan base. That said, I believe there are many differences in R&B music from the 90’s/early 2000’s to the latter 2000’s to 2014 but I’ll discuss one – quality of content.\n\nNowadays, mainstream music that’s branded as “R&B” is more vulgar and lacks lyrical depth. Speaking of vulgarity, it used to be that only Hip-Hop/Rap albums had the label, “Parental Advisory: Explicit Content”; but now R&B artists need the same thing because their singles are just as dirty. Yes, R&B will forever be inextricably linked to Hip-Hop/Rap because of how the two genres feed off of each other naturally in music, but there’s hardly a distinction between the two styles anymore.\n\nJust think about the fixation with the ‘f-bomb’ in today’s R&B lyrics, i.e., the original/explicit titles of Cee-Lo’s “Forget You” (2010) and Chris Brown & Nicki Minaj’s “Love More” (2013), as well as the unedited chorus of Miguel and Mariah Carey’s duet, “#Beautiful” (2013). In addition, today’s “R&B” songs refer to women as “hoes” and b*****s, as if they’re solely objects of men’s sexual gratification. In 90’s/early 2000’s R&B, though, women were spoken of with more respect.\n\nWhile the decade obviously had its fair share of raunchy tracks, women were caressed with love and adoration in the average R&B song. In Jodeci’s “Forever My Lady” (1991), for example, K-Ci takes the lead in praising the love of his life who’s also the mother of his newborn child, calling her a “lady”, not a garden tool or a female dog. That celebratory regard for women is sorely lacking right now, having been largely replaced with a flippant and condescending disregard for them.\n\nSwitching gears to lyrical depth, let’s compare two songs based on a woman’s conversation with her boyfriend. In Brandy’s “Almost Doesn’t Count” (1999), she sings, “You can’t get to heaven half off the ground. Everybody knows, almost doesn’t count.” That’s depth. A life lesson is beautifully woven inside a tale of heartbreak. Though specifically referencing a romantic relationship, anyone can take this advice in life: If you want to achieve your goals, almost doesn’t count; you have to put your all into an endeavor to get what you want out of it.\n\nOn the other hand, in Mila J’s 2014 single, “Smoke, Drink or Break-Up”, she tells her boyfriend, “Either we gon’ smoke, drink or break up ‘cause the only time we don’t fight is if we drunk or we high (oh my).” Oh my, is right! There’s absolutely no depth in those lyrics whatsoever, and look at what type of behavior is being promoted to avoid a break-up – smoking and drinking. Moreover, if a relationship is only stable when both parties don’t have full control of their mental faculties, there’s a serious issue! With content like that making up the R&B of today, there’s no wonder that Bobby V (an artist who got his start in the 90’s group, Mista) said in an interview with rollingout.com, “R&B is in a weird place.” It definitely is!\n\nJust with that little bit of analysis, it’s obvious that “the soul is gone” in today’s brand of R&B. Part of the reason is because, as I’ve heard it said lately, the lines between pop, hip-hop/rap and R&B have become blurred. Furthermore, the usage of foul/derogatory language is indicative of, not only a lack of creativity in writing, but also the respect for what the essence of R&B is. Our beloved genre, which is rooted in storytelling about the struggles and victories in life and love, is in critical danger of losing artists who are willing to put out music that adheres to its true nature. There are some who aim to keep R&B/Soul music alive, including Noel Gourdin, Leela James, Anthony Hamilton and Ledisi, but the majority of popular R&B singers fail in this department today.\n\nThis is why modern songs that have classic soul qualities strike a special chord within us — tunes like Raphael Saadiq’s “Love That Girl” (2008), R. Kelly’s “When a Woman Loves” (2010), Beyonce’s “Love on Top” (2011), Melanie Fiona’s “Wrong Side of a Love Song” (2012), Chris Brown’s “Fine China” (2013), and Tank’s “You’re My Star” (2014). Each composition personifies “feel good” music because it actually makes you feel good. Rather than brim with vulgarity or mediocrity, the lyrics come from the heart and the melodies breathe soul. That’s what R&B is all about, and that’s what true fans yearn for.\n\nI can say with surety, then, that as sure as my last name is Samuels, the 90’s/early 2000’s was the last period of time that brought that kind of music on a consistent basis. If I had to sum up my comparison of R&B today and back in the day, what better way to do so than in the words of a song? For that, I quote Atlanta-based singer/songwriter/producer, Jaye Berry, aka “Jahah”, who said in his 2014 single, “Soul Music”, “What happened to the music and the songs that take you higher? Now everything they play just sounds the same (lately) and the artists don’t inspire.” I strongly encourage you to listen to “Soul Music” in its entirety (You can watch the video below). If you have become numb to it, you’ll quickly be reminded of just how much heart and soul R&B music has been missing lately!"
