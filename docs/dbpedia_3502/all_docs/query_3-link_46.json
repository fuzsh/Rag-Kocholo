        "text": "Summer Walker’s most recent EP, Life on Earth, features a collaboration with NO1-NOAH on a song called “SWV”. The track’s name pays homage to the R&B group from the 90’s that consists of Coko, Taj, and Lelee. In this song, Summer and NO1-NOAH share a message about a love that is so strong it keeps a partner from leaving, giving the listener a taste of Walker’s signature sound.\n\nAbout SWV\n\nAs mentioned, “SWV” is a collaboration between the American singer-songwriter Summer Walker and NO1-NOAH. The track appears on the five-song EP, Life on Earth, which was released in July 2020. The title of the song is a reference to the R&B trio consisting of Coko, Taj, and Lelee, who were popular in the 90s. SWV was known for their sultry R&B sound and hit songs like “Weak” and “Right Here”.\n\nThe song itself is about a love so strong it is difficult for one partner to leave the other. The first verse of the song highlights the strength of this love, with the lyrics, “Baby, don’t you know I’m trying to be the one / To never let go, to hold you so close”. Summer and NO1-NOAH’s vocals blend perfectly together, creating a harmonious tone to match the beautiful lyrics.\n\nSummer, known for her captivating voice and subdued sound, is at her best in “SWV”. She effortlessly delivers lyrics about a powerful love that can withstand anything, making the listener feel the raw emotions behind the words. NO1-NOAH, on the other hand, is an emerging artist with a unique voice – his contribution to the song adds an extra layer of depth and texture. Together, they create a captivating harmony, making “SWV” a song worth listening to on repeat.\n\nThe instrumental production of “SWV” matches the smoothness of the vocal work in this song. With laid-back beats and a soft melody, this tune becomes a perfect backdrop to the messages of love delivered through Summer and NO1-NOAH’s vocals. The track offers a unique blend of R&B and contemporary pop tones, creating a sound that is fresh and modern. The transitions between verses and choruses are seamless, making the three-minute and twenty-one-second song feel almost too short.\n\nWhile “SWV” is not an anthem for the ages, it is an excellent representation of what Summer Walker can deliver as an artist. As an emerging star in the world of R&B and soul music, the EP Life on Earth is a snapshot of what we can expect from this talented young performer in the future. Fans of the genre should take the time to listen to this song and explore the depth of musicality that Summer has to offer.\n\nIn short, “SWV” is a fresh and modern blend of R&B and pop, featuring Summer Walker and NO1-NOAH’s beautiful vocals. The track’s name is a callback to the R&B trio that was prominent in the 90s, while also featuring a new take on the genre. The song is about a love that is so strong it is difficult to let go – the lyrics, vocals, and instrumental work come together to create an emotional and captivating track that offers a glimpse into the future of R&B music."
