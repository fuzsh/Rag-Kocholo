        "text": "1993 single by SWV\n\n\"Weak\" is a song by American R&B vocal trio SWV from their debut studio album, It's About Time (1992). It was written and produced by Brian Alexander Morgan, who composed the lyrics based on a young person falling in love for the first time.[2] Inspired by his crush on singer Chanté Moore,[3] Morgan originally wrote the song for Charlie Wilson, but he later decided to give the song to SWV. Morgan later revealed that lead singer of SWV, Coko, did not like the song and gave him attitude during the recording of the single.[4]\n\n\"Weak\" was released in April 1993 by RCA Records as the third single from the album. It topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in July 1993, as well as the Cash Box Top 100, and sold over one million copies domestically and was awarded a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also topped the Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart for two weeks. Outside the US, the single reached number six on the New Zealand Singles Charts and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart.
