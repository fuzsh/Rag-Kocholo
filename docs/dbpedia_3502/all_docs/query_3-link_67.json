        "text": "Sisters with Voices, better known as SWV, is an American female R&B, Grammy nominated trio from New York City. Formed in 1990 as a gospel group,[1] SWV became one of the most successful R&B groups of the 1990s. They had a series of hits, including \"Weak\", \"Right Here/Human Nature\", \"I'm So into You\", and \"You're the One\". The group disbanded in 1998 to pursue solo projects, and reunited in 2005.\n\nBiography[edit][]\n\nEarly life and big break[edit][]\n\nSWV (an abbreviation for Sisters With Voices) was formed by Cheryl Gamble, Tamara Johnson and Leanne Lyons (with Lelee and Coko as founding members).[2] After getting their demo together, the trio sent out demo tapes along with bottles of Perrier (\"We couldn't afford champagne\", says Taj) to catch the attention of record execs all over America. In 1991, after being invited to sing live in front of RCA executives, SWV was signed to an eight album record deal.\n\n1992–1995: It's About Time and The Remixes[edit][]"
