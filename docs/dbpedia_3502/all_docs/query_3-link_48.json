        "meta_description": "While there aren't any popular girl groups today, back in the 1990's there were plenty and SWV was the cream of the crop. Touting members Tamara \"Taj\" Johnson-George, Cheryl \"Coko\" Clemons and Leanne \"LeLee\" Lyons, the New York City threesome gave us some of R&B's most memorable hits like \"Weak,\" \"Right Here\" and \"You're The One.\" In April 2012, the ladies released their fifth album \"I Missed Us,\" and since we did long for SWV, here's a look back at the trio's history. \r\n\r\nMake sure you get your tickets to see the ladies at the 2012 ESSENCE Music Festival!",

        "text": "Here the ladies are, giving early 1992 tough sweetness for their debut album “It’s About Time” cover. Little did we know that at the time LeLee had two young children at home and Taj was battling her own demons.\n\n“I lost my mother at age 14 and had nothing or anyone to step in for her. I fell in many traps and have tons of scars. I was emotional, scared of everything, lacked self-esteem and confidence immensely and suffered from anxiety,” Taj told the Huffington Post when asked what advice she’d give her younger self. “I would have told myself that the only person able to deter you is you! You’re strong enough to nurture yourself. Everything that you think of yourself was filtered to you through people who feel that same way about themselves. It only matters if you believe it yourself.”\n\nIn 1998 SWV disbanded. Coko went on to release her debut solo album 1999’s “Hot Coko” to moderate success.\n\n“SWV were going through some changes,” Coko told MTV radio in 1999. “You know, we had communications problems. The unity was gone and the friendship was gone, basically. That’s the whole thing in a nutshell. It was either we were gonna get it together or we weren’t. And we couldn’t get it together, so we had to go. And that was it.”\n\nCoko then began a career in Gospel music, releasing 2006’s “Grateful.” Marrying Mike Clemons, the couple have a son along with Coko’s son from another relationship.\n\nTaj married husband Eddie George in 2004 and welcomed a son as well as a stepson through their union.\n\nHere the ladies are reuniting at the 2010 Soul Train Awards in November 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia."
