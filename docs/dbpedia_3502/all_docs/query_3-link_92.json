Coko/SWV were know for doing remixes remember 'anything' the uptempo version with a rare guest appearance by Wu Tang, 'You're The One' Allstar Remix still sounds so good today!! you guys heard the unreleased 'triflin' swizz beats remix??\n\nPost by perfecto on\n\ni hope its by a superproducer she has worked with timbaland, neptunes and darkchild in the past, she has credibilty among the people that know about R'n'B and this could get HUGE for her\n\nbut i don't mind as long as they do a good job...\n\nmikecheck12 keep us updated!!\n\nPost by marcjm on\n\nThis does sorta sound like a Mary Mary track, but she has a different vocal style and approach which brings a new definition to the song. I'm feeling it because this girl can blow. I hope that Urban wakes up and accepts this joint.\n\nPost by perfecto on\n\nmore news is emerging about the album its got production by Warryn \"Baby Dubb\" Campbell, super producer Rodney Jerkins, and J. Moss & PAJAM, 'clap your hands' is darkchild production? Lil' mo and faith evans feature plus kirk franklin, i like the sound of this they are balancing the gospel and r'n'b"
