It really is all-around a great Christmas CD, aside from Sinatra and Mariah, it's probably my favorite Christmas album. It was released quietly with no promotion, no advertisements, no single, nothing. The reason I like it so much is because it's traditional, simple, and festive. The album is mostly standard Christmas songs, which is what I prefer in a Christmas album. I really recommend checking it out if that's what you look for in a Christmas album... because these days you usually have to put up with a bunch of cornball new songs on Christmas albums.\n\nPost by Pink Champagne Ricochet on\n\nI found it at Big Lots for $2.99, but I haven't listened to it yet.\n\nIt also has \"My Favorite Things\" from The Sound of Music, but i've seen that on a lot of Christmas albums."
