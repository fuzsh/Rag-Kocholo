        "text": "It's no secret that Jimmy Fallon has a history of recording fun holiday tunes with A-list musicians, such as \"Almost Too Early For Christmas\" with Dolly Parton in 2022. One year later, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Host kept up the tradition with the November 17 release of his Christmas song, \"Wrap Me Up,\" with pop star Meghan Trainor.\n\nAnd on December 13, Fallon premiered the official \"Wrap Me Up\" music video on The Tonight Show. This video has everything: Over-the-top, Santa-adjacent looks, unwavering commitment to the red-and-green color palette, fake snow, flocked trees, dancers in candy-cane-striped gloves and giant bows, and an animated snowman. Every single frame is a visual treat for Christmas lovers.\n\nFallon and Trainor's holiday revelry isn't over yet: Trainor is joining the festivities on the Password Holiday Special, airing on Monday, December 18 at 10/9 CT on NBC. Featuring Emmy-nominated Host Keke Palmer and starring Jimmy Fallon, the special holiday-themed edition of the game show comes before its Season 2 premiere. They'll be joined by Jon Cryer, star of NBCâ€™s newest comedy series, Extended Family.\n\nRELATED: Watch Niall Horan Read a Christmas Poem in Seven Amazing Accents On The Spot\n\nHow Meghan Trainor and Jimmy Fallon's wrote their Christmas song, \"Wrap Me Up\"\n\nOn a November 13 episode of Tonight Show, Fallon explained the backstory behind what Fallon described as a \"Christmas banger.\"\n\n\"If you know me, you know that I love the holidays. I love holiday music, and if it were up to me, I would listen to 'Jingle Bells' in August,\" Fallon said. \"I've always wanted to do something with Meghan Trainor. She's a friend of the show, she's an amazing performer, songwriter, and she said, 'Yeah, I'd be down to do something with you. What ideas do you have, for like a holiday song?'\"\n\nFallon continued, \"So I sent her a voice memo of me on the phone. I go, 'Maybe it's something about wrapping gifts...'\"\n\nFallon added, \"I didn't hear back from Meghan. Then all of a sudden, a few weeks later, I get a call from Meghan. And she goes, 'Hey, I took your idea, and instead of Wrap It Up, I made it into Wrap Me Up, like I'm the gift.\"\n\nRELATED: This Clip From Dolly Parton's New Christmas Special Will Get You in the Holiday Spirit\n\nFallon loved the idea instantly, saying, \"She played me this song, and let me tell you something, she can sing. This song is a bop. This song is a banger. This song eats. This song slaps. This song's a Christmas banger!\"\n\nJimmy Fallon and Meghan Trainor performed \"Wrap Me Up\" on Kimmel\n\nOn the November 28 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, hosted by Fallon's friend and former podcast co-host Jimmy Kimmel, the duo delivered \"Wrap Me Up\" amid a snowy winter wonderland set packed with gifts and pink Christmas trees, with help from some backup singer elves.\n\nWhile Fallon looked fully festive in a burgundy blazer and a plaid tie that matched Trainor's headband, Trainor's all-read getup honestly won with a hoop skirt festooned with Christmas cookie-style designs."
