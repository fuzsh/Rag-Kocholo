        "text": "The chance to see two of the top R&B groups of the ’90s — hitmakers SWV and Xscape — share the stage together proved to be a huge draw, pulling in a capacity crowd of some 13,000 fans on opening night of the Queens of R&B Tour on Thursday (June 27) at the Toyota Pavilion in Concord.\n\nAnd the show turned out to be as great, and maybe even better, than fans could have hoped for, as the two trios mixed and matched songs — and, most wonderfully, occasionally shared vocals — during the course of a thoroughly entertaining co-headlining set that touched on (at least parts of) some 30 songs.\n\nFans who are planning to catch this tour — also featuring fellow ’90s R&B favorites Mya, 702 and Total — as it continues through other parts of the country, before winding to a close at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles on Aug. 18, should expect to have a ball.\n\nThat’s because, only one night into the run, this SWV-Xscape package is shaping up to be the R&B roadshow to beat in 2024.\n\nOne could feel the energy of the occasion well before they got to the Pavilion, as cars inched along Kirker Pass Road and passengers prepped for the show with shared laughter, smiles and passionate vocal work. Even though the traffic was horrendous, causing the Pavilion to use its overflow parking and shuttle service, people still seemed to be in a great mood (even though, in many cases, it caused them to miss some/many of the acts who were listed lower on the bill).\n\nYet, SWV and Xscape would make dealing with the traffic and parking issues feel very much worthwhile as they two acts combined for a performance that felt so different — and so much more vibrant — then what we often get with co-headlining treks.\n\nInstead of the usual approach of the top two artists simply putting on their own sets of music — and perhaps rotating who gets to close the show each night — these two iconic R&B trios completely sewed their sets together and constantly volleyed the spotlight between them.\n\nXscape — featuring Kandi Burruss, Tameka “Tiny” Harris and Tamika Scott — would appear for a few minutes, running through such favorites as “Feels So Good,” “Can’t Hang” and “Keep On, Keepin’ On.” Then SWV — consisting of Tamara “Taj” George, Cheryl “Coko” Gamble and Leanne “Lelee” Lyons — would pop up and croon through the likes of “I’m So Into You” and “Right Here.”\n\nOf course, this kind of a show doesn’t work — at all — if the groups don’t jell well onstage. Fortunately, SWV and Xscape songs flow together like a masterful ’90s mixtape and, just as importantly, the two teams seem to like each other and enjoy combining forces.\n\nIt’s the latter that may surprise viewers of the 2023’s “SWV & Xscape: The Queens of R&B,” a reality TV mini-series on the Bravo channel that focused on the two acts as they prepped for a big tour. The two sides had a massive falling out during the show — fueled by the regular celebrity trappings of ego and trash talk — which left viewers with the impression that SWV and Xscape probably wouldn’t be sending each other Christmas cards anytime soon, let alone hitting the road together.\n\nThe two sides eventually talked things out, clearing the air as well as the runway to embarking on the road with the Queens of R&B Tour in 2024.\n\nThe result is that fans can now witness a show that has so much going for it — from a two-level stage that offers up plenty of zippy video elements to an energetic dance team to a steady supply of cool wardrobe changes.\n\nYet, none of that is nearly as important as the amazing vocal work that you get to hear during the course of the set. All six of star vocalists sound great, nicely conveying the same type of emotion and conviction that fans first enjoyed way back on their respective debut albums (Xscape’s “Hummin’ Comin’ at ‘Cha” in 1993, SWV’s “It’s About Time” in 1992).\n\nThey sounded terrific in their own individual spotlights, as Xscape relived such triumphs as “Who Can I Run To” and “My Little Secret” and SWV brought back the likes of “Right Here” and “You’re Always on My Mind.”\n\nYet, the most memorable moments came when the two vocal crews took the stage together, with six voices joining in glorious harmony to lift up 13,000 fans on the Clark sisters powerful gospel number “You Brought the Sunshine (Into My Life),” the gorgeous Xscape ballad “The Arms of the One Who Loves You” and the fun show-closing cover of Lil’ Kim’s “Not Tonight (Ladies Night Remix).”\n\nSetlist:1. “Can We”2. “Feels So Good”3. “Can’t Hang”4. “Keep On, Keepin’ On”5. “I’m So Into You”6. “Right Here”7. “Love on My Mind”8 “What’s Up”9. “Don’t Think I’m Not”10. “You’re the One”11. “You’re Always on My Mind”12. “Use Your Heart”13. “My Little Secret”14. “Hold On”15. “The Arms of the One Who Loves You”16. “Is My Living in Vain”17. “You Brought the Sunshine (Into My Life)”18. “It’s About Time”19. “Downtown”20. “Softest Place on Earth”21. “Do You Want To”22. “If Only You Knew”23. “Tonight”24. “Rain”25. “Who Can I Run To”26. “Weak”27. “Anything”28. “Understanding”29. “Just Kicking It”30. “Not Tonight (Ladies Night Remix)”"
