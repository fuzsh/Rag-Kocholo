With old skool ‘90s RnB peaking in influence and popularity across generations, the RnB Xmas Ball promises to be a sell-out show when tickets go on pre-sale 27th September and general sale on 29th September here, bringing the heat to legions of London fans this Christmas.\n\nMulti-platinum selling artist Joe will be performing his most loved hits for his fans including ‘Stutter’, ‘All The Things (Your Man Won’t Do)’ and ‘Don’t Wanna Be A Player’.

Meanwhile, iconic 90s vocal trio SWV (aka Sisters With Voices), consisting of Cheryl ‘Coko’ Gamble, Tamara ‘Taj’ Johnson, and Leanne ‘Lelee’ Lyons, have sold over 25million records globally, making them one of the most successful R&B groups of the 1990s. So it will be a rare treat for London fans to see SWV perform their timeless string of hits, including ‘Weak’, ‘Right Here (Human Nature Remix)’, ‘I’m So Into You’, and ‘You’re The One’.\n\nJoe said “The UK always shows me the most love and I can’t wait to get on stage for three shows to perform live and connect with my British fans again, the vibe is so cool and y’all show know how to get down!”\n\nMonica said “It will be amazing to return for the first time in 30 years for the RnB Xmas Ball, it feels so right to spend Christmas with you London, I’m not gonna leave it so long next time!”\n\nSWV said “We are all so incredibly excited to come back to London for the RnB Xmas Ball, we’re gonna light it up. Are y’all ready for the RnB Xmas Ball?”\n\nJoe, Monica & SWV + 112, Next, Bobby V & J Holiday\n\nDecember 17th OVO Arena Wembley\n\nJoe, 112, Next, Bobby V & J Holiday\n\nDecember 15th Birmingham Academy\n\nDecember 16th Manchester Victoria Warehouse\n\nTickets: Pre-sale 10am 27th September & General sale 10am 29th September here."
