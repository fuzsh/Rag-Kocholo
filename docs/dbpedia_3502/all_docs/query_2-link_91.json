        "text": "The recent (April 28) Singersroom sponsored R&B Spotlight paid homage to the golden era of R&B, the 90s, with a special performance from New Jack Swing trio, SWV. Hosted by founder Cory Taylor and indie singer-songwriter Shaliek, the event, held at New York's SOB’s, kicked off on the dance floor before performers took the stage. With drinks in tow, guys are girls showed off their best dance moves to 90's anthems such as \"Poison, \"Tell Me,\" \"Creep,\" \"You're The One For Me,\" \"Candy Rain,\" \"No Diggity ft Dr. Dre & Queen Pen,\" and many more.\n\nBefore SWV hit the stage, four local talents gave the crowd an eargasmic warm up session. Each singer sang one song from the 90's, including songs from Jon B, Faith Evans and Mary J. Blige, and one of their original works. The opening acts were Felicia Temple, Gaetano, Bradd Marquis, and Suzy Q, who was a fan favorite after her rendition of Mary J's \"Reminisce.\"\n\nOnce the opening acts performed, everyone was pumped and ready to see the one and only SWV! These ladies didn't need an introduction as Coko, Taj, and Lelee stepped on stage, sending the crown into a frenzy. After Coko received some welcoming love for a recent surgery, the ladies performed \"I'm So Into You,\" \"Weak,\" \"Right Here (Human Nature),\" and \"Anything.\"\n\nFollowing their set, Coko, Taj, and Lelee thanked fans for coming out and taking the time to hear other artists perform. Cory also chimed in, telling everyone that well-established stars in R&B shouldn't be the only focus when you attend concerts. He said, \"aspiring singers should be given an opportunity to deliver their talent because it's not easy performing on stage. The biggest names in music had humble beginnings so we should acknowledge the next generation of singers.\"\n\n\"Celebrating the 90's\" concert gave everyone a chance to go back in time and reminisce on REAL music. The 90's was an important era because many artists introduced their unique sounds. Some of the biggest names during that time were SWV, TLC, En Vogue, R. Kelly, Blackstreet, Total, Jodeci, Usher, Brandy, Monica, Jon B, Mary J. Blige, Toni Braxton, and the list goes on. Everyone looked forward to hearing their favorite jam on the radio when they heard these artists. 90's music will forever reign because it still has a huge impact on R&B today. It reminds R&B artists to understand why music should be meaningful. So, let's make a toast to the 90's because you should give respect when it's due.\n\nThe 90’s was a time of incredible music and memorable experiences. On Saturday night, fans had the pleasure of reliving these memories as they celebrated with R&B trio SWV at R&B Spotlight in Los Angeles. From their iconic dance moves to hit songs like “Weak” and “Right Here/Human Nature,” the audience was brought back to those special moments from decades ago. It was an unforgettable experience that no one wanted to end!\n\nThe energy inside the venue was electric as soon as SWV stepped on stage. The crowd cheered loudly for every song performed and sang along word-for-word. Lead singer Coko even took a moment to thank everyone for coming out and supporting her group throughout its career. She also gave a shoutout to all the other talented performers who were part of that amazing 90’s era.\n\nBy the end of the show, it seemed like everyone had gone back in time – it was clear just how much people had enjoyed themselves by looking at their bright smiles and singing voices! For those lucky enough to be there, this will certainly remain one of the most cherished musical events ever experienced.\n\nOverview Of Swv’s 90s Music\n\nSWV, which stands for Sisters With Voices, is an iconic American R&B girl group that rose to fame in the early 90s. Composed of Cheryl “Coko” Clemons, Leanne “Lelee” Lyons and Tamara “Taj” Johnson-George, their smooth harmonies and catchy hooks have earned them numerous hits on the Billboard charts throughout the decade. Their signature sound has been featured on several hit songs including “Right Here,” “Weak” and “You’re The One.” Recently, SWV celebrated their legacy with a special performance at the R&B Spotlight concert series.\n\nThe show was filled with all of SWV’s biggest hits from the 90s as well as some new material they’ve released over the years. This allowed fans to relive memories of when these songs were first released while still getting to experience something fresh and exciting. Between each song, there was plenty of time for Coko, Lelee and Taj to tell stories about how certain songs came together or what inspired them to write it in the first place. Fans really got an inside look into SWV’s creative process and it made for a truly unique and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe night concluded with SWV performing one last song before taking a final bow in front of their adoring audience. It was clear that everyone in attendance had enjoyed themselves immensely, singing along every step of the way — proving why this trio continues to be so beloved decades later. As they left the stage, you could feel just how proud everyone was not only for being able to witness such amazing talent but also having experienced firsthand how timeless music can bring people together regardless of age or background.\n\nHighlights Of R&B Spotlight Performance\n\nThe R&B Spotlight performance was truly a night to remember for both SWV and their fans. From the moment they hit the stage, it was clear that this wasn’t just another concert; it was an experience filled with nostalgia and excitement. With each song, Coko, Lelee and Taj seamlessly blended old classics with more recent material while engaging in conversation between songs.\n\nOne of the main highlights of the show had to be when SWV performed their classic ‘Right Here’ which brought everyone back to 1991 when the track first dropped. Although it’s been over two decades since its initial release, hearing this timeless single still felt as fresh and exciting as ever — all thanks to SWV’s impeccable vocals. There were also plenty of other standout moments such as when they sang their heartfelt ballad ‘You’re The One’, or their empowering duet ‘Rain’.\n\nAt the end of the night, there was no denying how special this event really was. Not only did people get to enjoy music from one of the most influential groups in R&B history but they got to have a glimpse into what makes them so unique as artists — something that will surely stay with us for years to come.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 90’s was an era of great music, and SWV certainly brought some of the best. Their performance at R&B Spotlight was a reminder that their music still resonates with fans today. It was a night to celebrate all the amazing hits from the past, while also looking forward to what they have in store for us next.\n\nI had so much fun at this show! From start to finish, it was filled with energy and nostalgia. I especially enjoyed singing along to my favorite classics like “Weak” and “Right Here”. It felt like I was back in the 90s again, just dancing away without a care in the world.\n\nOverall, attending SWV’s performance at R&B Spotlight was definitely an experience I won’t soon forget. The band reminded me why I fell in love with their music all those years ago and reignited my passion for R&B. It truly was a magical evening celebrating the best of the 90s!"
