        "text": "Next in our Top 10 Best Songs showcase we celebrate the legendary legacy of SWV by revisiting their discography. As with all of these features, our goal is to highlight what we consider to be the best songs they’ve given us over the years.\n\nChoosing the best SWV songs was no easy task since Coko, Taj and Lelee are true legends and have given us such a strong catalog of music so far. While it might have been easy to just select all of the singles, we made sure to include a lengthy honorable mention so that we could include some of the overlooked gems as well.\n\nSWV have been in the game for nearly three decades but unfortunately have only given us five albums so far due in part to their lengthy hiatus in the 2000’s. That has not stopped them from solidifying their place as arguably the top female R&B group who emerged out of the 90’s.\n\nClick Here to check out all of our Top 10 Lists. Click any of the song titles to hear that song.\n\nWithout further ado, here is our list in chronological order:\n\nRight Here/Human Nature (from the “It’s About Time” album)\n\nThe original version of the song was already dope, but the remix took it to another level. The song still remains in heavy rotation at R&B parties.\n\nI’m So Into You (from the “It’s About Time” album)\n\nA funky New Jack Swing anthem that is one of the many legendary songs writer/producer Brian Alexander Morgan created for the group.\n\nWeak (from the “It’s About Time” album)\n\nOne of the most outstanding vocal performances of the 90’s. This song is a touching and timeless R&B staple.\n\nAll Night Long (featuring Babyface) (from the “Waiting to Exhale” soundtrack)\n\nThis song was not a single but easily could have been. A signature Babyface produced ballad.\n\nYou’re The One (from the “New Beginning” album)\n\nThe first single from the group’s second album proved to us there would be no sophomore slump.\n\nDon’t Waste Your Time (from the “New Beginning” album)\n\nThis Chucky Thompson produced, Faith Evans written gem was tucked towards the end of the “New Beginning” album. Lelee really shines on this one.\n\nCan We (featuring Missy Elliott) (from the “Release Some Tension” album)\n\nTimbaland and Missy gave SWV some of their best work with the song “Can We”.\n\nRain (from the “Release Some Tension” album)\n\nOne of the most soothing and relaxing R&B jams of the 90’s.\n\nLove Unconditionally (from the “I Missed Us” album)\n\nThis Carvin & Ivan produced song was a real standout on the group’s return album after a nearly 15 year hiatus.\n\nI Missed Us (from the “I Missed Us” album)\n\nOne of our favorite album cuts from the group which gets bonus points for the Legend of Zelda sample.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\n-You’re Always On My Mind (from the “It’s About Time” album)\n\n-Anything (featuring The Wu-Tang Klan) (from the “Above the Rim” soundtrack)\n\n-Fine Time (from the “New Beginning” album)\n\n-Use Your Heart (from the “New Beginning” album)\n\n-Love is so Amazing (from the “New Beginning” album)\n\n-On & On (from the “New Beginning” album)\n\n-Tell Me How You Want It (from the “Money Talks” soundtrack)\n\n-When U Cry (from the “Release Some Tension” album)\n\n-Lose Myself (from the “Release Some Tension” album)\n\n-Co-Sign (from the “I Missed Us” album)\n\n-Aint No Man (from the “Still” album)"
