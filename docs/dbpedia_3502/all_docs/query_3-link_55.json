It looks better than the usual arguing women show though.\n\nEdit: just started watching the first episode and no... they're not ignoring I Missed Us. Never mind, then. It seems like the show is mainly about them on the road.\n\n'Weak' is such a classic! 'Anything' is my favorite from them. There were about fifty different versions of the song but this is the definitive one for me:\n\n[video=youtube;6BEsBFQ8s_Y]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BEsBFQ8s_Y[/video]\n\nMy jam! I can't believe the didn't have a thread on here before. I don't think I'll bother with the show, though.\n\nI have their first album which i love. I first got into them when I bought the 'Im So Into You' cd single and the B side was 'Weak' which I fell in love with and ended up buying the album. Don't know much of them after the 1st album though apart from 'Anything'.\n\nI'm So Into You, Weak, and the single mixes of Right Here and Anything (I love rapping along to Wu Tang!) are sooo good - it's one of the strongest runs of singles from a debut album ever (yes, I know I'm ignoring Downtown, but it's not as good, and mucks up the singles run a bit).\n\nYou're the One and It's All About You were amazing too. As was Can We. I still haven't got around to getting I Missed Us, but I must do soon.\n\nWatched this out of pure curiosity and found it absolutely brilliant! I was never a fan of SWV (I was like 4 when they came out) so was never old enough to really know their music, but being a fan of TLC and Destiny's Child I've quite often hear references to SWV so thought it would be worth a watch. Lelee is absolutely hilarious! I can't wait to watch the next episode and I'm gonna check out some of their music as I recognised a couple of the tracks featured in the show.\n\nI own Coko's failed solo album on CD!!!! I paid quite a lot for a US import too!\n\nI've never listened past Sunshine and I don't even listen to that anymore.\n\nHowever, I'm calling Can We as their greatest single... made me a Timbaland obsessive anyway...\n\nI loved Coko's album... this was at the time where i hoovered up female r&b albums in hmv but it had some decent tracks. Triflin', Dont Take Your Love and He Back back were all quite good (not amazing mind you) late 90's r&b.\n\nITV should have got them on the Big Reunion... arguably they have some of the most memorable 90's r&b hits and they clearly have issues with each other and personality!\n\nIt made me laugh when they said it in the show they were playing Wembley and it showed the stadium... only to be the Arena they ended up playing instead sharing a bill with Blackstreet, Dru Hill and Changing faces all just doing a few songs each\n\nI own Coko's failed solo album on CD!!!! I paid quite a lot for a US import too!\n\nI've never listened past Sunshine and I don't even listen to that anymore.\n\nHowever, I'm calling Can We as their greatest single... made me a Timbaland obsessive anyway...\n\nTotally agree with you. Can We is fantastic. It should have been a bigger smash. I bought the Platinum & Gold collection because it was listed as a track but it turns out it's a completely different track - it was an error.\n\nI remember Coko's album but Sunshine was the standout. I don't remember the rest.\n\nI've just finished their reality show. Lordy, Lordy... Coko is so unlikeable, she comes across as so self-entitled. In fact, none of them come across as particularly endearing, even though the show itself is great entertainment. I was shocked at some of their live performances though - am I the only one who thinks their harmonies sound disastrous these days?\n\nI must say though, as much of an ego-maniac she is, Coko's new gospel single is incredible.\n\n[video=youtube;Bvelo1gMybs]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvelo1gMybs[/video]"
