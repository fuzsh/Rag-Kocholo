Coko Clemons, known as the lead singer of 90’s R&B sensation SWV is set to celebrate the Holiday season with her latest release, A Coko Christmas. Featuring 14 special guests including American Idol Alum George Huff, David Caton, Lady Tibba and Sir Jalen, “A Coko Christmas” follows the singer’s Grammy nominated gospel debut, Grateful, released in 2006. Serving as a segway for her soon-to-come second studio album, “A Coko Christmas” is set to hit stores Oct. 14. For those who have followed Coko through her career they will rediscover SWV-inked Christmas tunes âOh Holy Night,â âThis Christmas,â and âThe Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire) from their 1997 release of A SPECIAL CHRISTMAS. Coko also reached back to her first gospel album to share holiday inspired tracks âHolyâ and âGratefulâ. The title track offers an R&B influenced beat with a spiritual overlay while âHolyâ highlights her silky voice laced over such a powerful and majestic tune. Both share in universal appeal and translate gracefully during the Christmas and holiday season. Some new tinsel is sprinkled onto the project, presenting original and remixed Christmas songs produced by David Caton. Starting the album off is the jazzy standard and single âWe Thank Youâ which features Deon Kipping; American Idol finalist, George Huff, joins for an appearance on âGive Love On Christmas Dayâ; âThe Greatestâ is the up-tempo, techno-pop dance tune; however, the most memorable track on the album would undoubtedly be âSilent Nightâ where Coko is joined by her mother and gospel singer, Lady Tibba and youngest son, Sir Jalen. Just as the song ends Coko asks âJalen can you sing this for mommyâ and as the five year old sings âSilent Night, Holy Nightâ the awe inspiring moment showcases three generations of musical talent. “A Coko Christmas” hits stores October 14.
