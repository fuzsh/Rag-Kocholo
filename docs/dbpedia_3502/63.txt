The recent (April 28) Singersroom sponsored R&B Spotlight paid homage to the golden era of R&B, the 90s, with a special performance from New Jack Swing trio, SWV. Hosted by founder Cory Taylor and indie singer-songwriter Shaliek, the event, held at New York's SOB’s, kicked off on the dance floor before performers took the stage. With drinks in tow, guys are girls showed off their best dance moves to 90's anthems such as "Poison, "Tell Me," "Creep," "You're The One For Me," "Candy Rain," "No Diggity ft Dr. Dre & Queen Pen," and many more.

Before SWV hit the stage, four local talents gave the crowd an eargasmic warm up session. Each singer sang one song from the 90's, including songs from Jon B, Faith Evans and Mary J. Blige, and one of their original works. The opening acts were Felicia Temple, Gaetano, Bradd Marquis, and Suzy Q, who was a fan favorite after her rendition of Mary J's "Reminisce."

Once the opening acts performed, everyone was pumped and ready to see the one and only SWV! These ladies didn't need an introduction as Coko, Taj, and Lelee stepped on stage, sending the crown into a frenzy. After Coko received some welcoming love for a recent surgery, the ladies performed "I'm So Into You," "Weak," "Right Here (Human Nature)," and "Anything."

Following their set, Coko, Taj, and Lelee thanked fans for coming out and taking the time to hear other artists perform. Cory also chimed in, telling everyone that well-established stars in R&B shouldn't be the only focus when you attend concerts. He said, "aspiring singers should be given an opportunity to deliver their talent because it's not easy performing on stage. The biggest names in music had humble beginnings so we should acknowledge the next generation of singers."

"Celebrating the 90's" concert gave everyone a chance to go back in time and reminisce on REAL music. The 90's was an important era because many artists introduced their unique sounds. Some of the biggest names during that time were SWV, TLC, En Vogue, R. Kelly, Blackstreet, Total, Jodeci, Usher, Brandy, Monica, Jon B, Mary J. Blige, Toni Braxton, and the list goes on. Everyone looked forward to hearing their favorite jam on the radio when they heard these artists. 90's music will forever reign because it still has a huge impact on R&B today. It reminds R&B artists to understand why music should be meaningful. So, let's make a toast to the 90's because you should give respect when it's due.

The 90’s was a time of incredible music and memorable experiences. On Saturday night, fans had the pleasure of reliving these memories as they celebrated with R&B trio SWV at R&B Spotlight in Los Angeles.
