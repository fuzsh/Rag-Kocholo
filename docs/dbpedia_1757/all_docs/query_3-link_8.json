        "text": "This week marks the return of Cowes Week on the Isle of Wight, an all-singing, all-dancing sailing competition attended by the great and the good of high society. The annual festivities have had a royal connection as early as its second year, 1826, when King George IV showed his approval of the event by presenting the King's Cup.\n\nQueen Victoria, who ascended to the throne 11 years after it was established, was another notable royal patron. There is even a famous old British joke about her fondness for the island: 'Why did Queen Victoria never ride a horse?' 'Because she preferred Cowes'.\n\nYet it was two of Victoria's descendants who have perhaps the most significant history at Cowes, her son Prince Edward (future King Edward VII) and her grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who regularly clashed there in the 1890s.\n\nOn his annual trip to see his British relatives, Wilhelm was reportedly loud and aggressive, with his sense of humour leaving much to be desired. Meanwhile from the other side, it has been speculated that his British relatives mocked his attire, which was not right for the summer-casual aesthetic at Cowes, with its boat shoes and striped blazers.\n\nThe kaiser and the future king tried constantly to one-up each other with bigger, faster, flashier boats, with the German nephew desperate to impress his English uncle, who of course was known for his great fleet of naval ships.\n\nIn 1896, the kaiser had the biggest yacht yet built, the 121-ft long Meteor II, which he pitted against Edward's Britannia. After it won, the future king retired from racing at Cowes.\n\nIn 2008, reports emerged via the descendant of a bystander that the future king had punched his nephew, after he laughed at him for losing in a race. As Henry Brasted, son of local yachting specialist William Brasted, told the Daily Gazette: 'Kaiser Bill jeered King Teddy about the result, where straight away King Teddy hit him in the mouth, knocked him down, then stormed into the club.\n\n'My father watched all this from the beaten rowing cutter. That episode was never printed in the papers at that time - imagine the consequences if they had.'\n\nHistorian Maldwin Drummond confirmed that there was a frostiness between the two royals, telling the paper at the time: 'There was certainly a considerable amount of bad blood. They were never pals because the kaiser was always trying to be one up. This irritated the Prince of Wales at first but later on it became more annoying, and there was no love lost between them.'\n\nOf course, by the 1910s, relations between the uncle and his nephew were truly in a bad way, with the outbreak of the First World War looming in 1914.\n\nSubscribe now for a trial offer of 3 issues for £1 plus free digital editions and home delivery.\n\nMore from Tatler"
