        "text": "Outstanding Referees Program\n\nThe Outstanding Referee program was instituted in 2008 to recognize scientists who have been exceptionally helpful in assessing manuscripts for publication in the APS journals. By means of the program, APS expresses its appreciation to all referees, whose efforts in peer review not only keep the standards of the journals at a high level, but in many cases also help authors to improve the quality and readability of their articles â€“ even those that are not published by APS.\n\nThe highly selective Outstanding Referee program annually recognizes about 150 of the roughly 91,600 currently active referees. Like Fellowship in the APS, this is a lifetime award. In this year, 2024, 156 Outstanding Referees were selected. Our Editors select the honorees based on the quality, number, and timeliness of their reports, without regard for membership in the APS, country of origin, or field of research. Referees are rewarded for their work carried out since 1978, the earliest year for which we have accurate data on referee reports returned. The decisions are difficult and there are many excellent referees who are still to be recognized.\n\nThe honorees come from over 58 different countries. All listed in the table have been notified, offered the option of anonymity, and will receive a lapel pin and a certificate.\n\nThe Outstanding Referees are to be congratulated and thanked for their outstanding service to the physics community.\n\nShift-click to sort on multiple columns"
