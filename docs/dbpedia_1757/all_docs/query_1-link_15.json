        "text": "Most Nebraskan are familiar with the name Sartor-Hamann when it comes to buying jewelry so I was tickled to learn that my great-great grandmother Louise Hamann-Baruth was the aunt of William (‘Bill’) Hamann who joined up with Ernest Sartor in 1955 to found Sartor-Hamann jewelers.\n\nThe first members of this branch of the Hamann family were John C Hamann (Johann Karl Hamann) and his wife Marie Dorothea Claus.\n\nAccording to their son August’s passport application in 1912 they emigrated to the US aboard the Germania from Hamburg on 15 April 1866.

I would love to hear from any potential family!\n\nThis has always been on my favorite ancestor photos. I am not sure of when exactly it had to be taken but he turned 18 in 1863 and immigrated to the US in 1872 so somewhere in that time frame was this striking photo taken. Sadly the lovely gentleman who possessed this photo, LaVon Bienhoff, passed away early this year and I never got a chance to contact him but I wanted a chance to pass on some more of the things I’ve learned about my Van Lengen ancestors thanks to his work.\n\nReemt was the youngest of five children born to Dieke Janssen Van Lengen and Mettje Mimken Saathoff. The family was settled in Riepe, Ostfriesland, Hannover, Germany. For most of his childhood Riepe was part of the Kingdom of Hannover and in 1866 the Kingdom of Hannover was incorporated into Prussia and in 1871 became part of the German Empire.\n\nChildren of Dieke and Mettje :\n\n(1) Geeske Dieken van Lengen – She born on 25 January 1835 in Riepe. She died on 2 October 1904 in Riepe and was buried there.\n\nShe married 1 May 1859 in Riepe to Jann Hinrichs Klüver (b. 16 September 1835 Riepe; d. 21 December 1875 “bei”, Rorichum, Ostfriesland, Hannover; bur. Riepe), son of Hinrich Hinrichs Klüver, and Wilhelmine Charlotte Siemsen.\n\nThey had children.\n\n(2) Mimke Auts Dieken van Lengen – He was born on 4 August 1838 in Riepe. He worked as a “Dienstknecht” (farm servant) in Wolthusen.\n\n(3) Hiske Dieken van Lengen – She was born on 10 April 1840 in Riepe. She died on 30 November 1904 in Uphusen.\n\nShe married on 6 May 1865 to Willem Lueberts Endjer (b. 26 October 1838 Riepe; d. 17 December 1915 Uphusen), son of Luebbert Willem Endjer, and his first wife Anke Janssen.\n\n(4) Janna Dieken van Lengen – She was born on 24 December 1842 in Riepe. She died on 20 March 1926 in Simonswolde, Schwerinsdorf, Ostfriesland, Germany and was buried there.\n\nShe married on 20 August 1864 in Riepe to Johann Harm Meenken Kruse (b. 19 August 1836 Oldersumer-Neuland, Ostfriesland; d. 24 January 1906 Simonswolde, Schwerinsdorf, Ostfriesland; bur. Simonswolde), son of Dirk Uffen Kruse, and Klara Janszen Harms.\n\nThey had children.\n\n[Köster, Folkert u. Harm Harms, Die Familien der Kirchengemeinde Riepe von 1712 – 1909, (Aurich, Selbstverlag, MMV), Seiten 273 u. 274]\n\nIt appears that Reemt would be the only Van Lengen of this generation to make the journey to the United States. Reemt and his siblings were also orphaned at a fairly young age – Their father died in May 1847 and their mother in August 1845. It would be interesting to know who raised these children with the oldest, Geeske, being twelve at the time of her father’s death and the youngest, Reemt, being just shy of two years old at the time.\n\nReemt himself was born on 10 May 1845 and baptized on 18 May 1845 at the Evangelical Church Resterhafe (Schwittersum), Aurich, Hannover.\n\nHe died on 17 March 1923 in Nebraska and is buried in the St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery, Assumption Road, Adams County, Nebraska (about two miles west of Glenvil, Nebraska).\n\nReemt immigrated in 1872 and like many German settlers of that time frame first came to Illinois and then to Nebraska.\n\nHe married a Moderina Peters, daughter of Jann Campen Peters, of Riepe, who was an innkeeper of the “Middle House” (Mittelhaus) and his first wife Trientje Hinrichs Kramer.\n\nModerina was 29 July 1848 in Riepe. She died 13 June 1924 in Nebraska and was buried in the St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery.\n\nSeveral of Moderina’s siblings would also come to the Glenvil, Nebraska area, including, Peter Helmer Peters, Ude Peters, and Hero (who ran a saloon in Glenvil that was robbed at least three times in three years! A third robbery was reported in 1904 with seven bottles of whisky taken and $15 in cash from the meat market of Gus Kissenger.]\n\n1880 Census – Reemt and Moderina are living at at 272 Chestnut St., Minonk, Woodford County, Illinois. He is a farmer.\n\n1900 US Census – They are living in the Blaine Township, Adams County, Nebraska. He is farming. He can read and write and speak English (German is his native tongue).\n\n1910 US Census – They are living in the Blaine Township, Adams County, Nebraska. He is farming. They have been married 46 years.\n\n1920 US Census – They are living in the Blaine Township, Adams County, Nebraska. He is a retired farmer and owns his farm. He immigrated in 1872 and was naturalized in 1880.\n\nR.D. VanLengen appears in the Atlas Adams County Nebraska of 1919. He owns 80 acres [square 26]. Kate O Hildebrand borders him to the west, F.R. Hoagland to the north, Tena Janssen to the east, and Peter Labrie to the south.\n\nReemt and Moderina had five children :\n\n(1) Trientje (‘Tena’) Van Lengen\n\nShe was born on 6 January 1873 in Minonk, Woodford Co., Illinois. She died on 19 October 1944 in Glenvil, Clay Co., Nebraska and is buried in the St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery, near Glenvil, Adams Co., Nebraska.\n\nShe married first on 10 February 1892 at the St Paul’s Lutheran Church, Glenvil, Adams Co., Nebraska to Gerhard Gottlieb Hinrichs (b. 8 November 1870 Aurich, Niedersachsen, Germany; d. 2 November 1903; bur. St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery, near Glenvil, Adams Co., Nebraska), son of Hinrich Classen Gandschaal Hinrichs, and his wife Wilma Trientje Hippen.\n\nShe married second on 1 March 1906 at the St Paul’s Lutheran Church, near Glenvil, Adams Co., Nebraska, as his second wife, to John Evert Janssen (b. 8 May 1873 Aurich, Niedersachsen, Germany; d. 15 May 1962 Hastings, Adams Co., Nebraska; bur. St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery, near Glenvil, Adams Co., Nebraska), son of Johann Evert Janssen, and his wife Fentje Margarethe Bruns.\n\nShe had children with both husbands.\n\n(2) Dirk (‘Dick’) Van Lengen\n\nHe was born on 8 November 1875 Minonk, Woodford Co., Illinois. He died on 19 March 1959 in Nebraska and was buried in the St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery, near Glenvil, Adams Co., Nebraska.\n\nHe married on 9 November 1902 to Elsie/Elise (‘Lizzie’) Heye (b. 5 November 1875 Nebraska; d. 12 August 1932; bur. St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery, near Glenvil, Adams Co., Nebraska), daughter of Johann (‘John’) Dietrich Heye, and his wife Antje Margarethe (‘Anna’) Boltjes.\n\nThey had children (including my great-grandfather John Dietrich Van Lengen!)\n\n(3) Mettja (‘Mattie’) Van Lengen\n\nShe was born on 11 April 1878 in Minonk, Woodford Co., Illinois. She died on 2 October 1952 and was buried in the St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery, near Glenvil, Adams Co., Nebraska.\n\nShe married in 1894 to Renetius Reent Claussen Hinrichs (b. 24 February 1865 Westerende, Aurich, Niedersachsen, Germany; d. 25 April 1902 Glenvil, Clay Co., Nebraska), son of Hinrich Classen Gandschaal Hinrichs, and his wife Wilma Trientje Hippen.\n\nThey had children.\n\n(4) Johann (‘John’) Van Lengen – He was born on 4 October 1881 in Minonk, Woodford County, Illinois. He died on 27 January 1921 and was buried in the St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery, near Glenvil, Adams County, Nebraska with his parents. He never married.\n\n[The Nebraska State Journal, 29 Jan 1921 – Hastings, Jan 28. – John Vanlengen, thirty-nine, was found by his aged father R.D. Vanlengen dead in the barn on the Vanlengen farm five miles northeast of Hastings last night. The top of his skull had been blown off by the charge from his shotgun, which lay beside the body. Whether it was an accident or a suicide is not known. The man left the farm house about 4 o’clock, going hunting. He was never known to be despondent, nor did he have business entanglements, love affairs or anything else that he was known to worry about. When he failed to return from hunting his father went to the barn to do the chores and then found the body.]\n\n(5) Reemt Van Lengen – He was born on 14 December 1884 in Minonk, Woodford Co., Illinois. He died on 6 September 1885 in Adams Co., Nebraska and was buried in the St Paul’s Lutheran Cemetery, near Glenvil, Adams Co., Nebraska.\n\nAs always I love to hear from any descendants or anyone with more to share or add! E-mail : thebluetiger16 (no spam) at gmail.\n\nGenealogy is often a game of luck and patience and being in the right place in the right time. My luck was finding a land grant on my ancestor Fred Wehnes which opened a wealth of information on him and his wife.\n\nHis son had settled in Adams County and his wife had died in Gage County in Nebraska so it was quite a surprise to find Frederick had actually settled in Cass County – luckily their historical society is just a 30 minute drive away so some research was in order! I was able to add a little more meat to the bones to not just Frederick but his wife Dora.\n\nCATHERINE MARY DORETHEA (‘DORA’) OEHLERKING\n\nShe was born in February 1835 in Lüneburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. She died on 4 June 1901 and was buried in the Marsh Cemetery, Clatonia Township, Gage Co., Nebraska.\n\nMarsh Cemetery in Gage County\n\n[The Marsh Cemetery is located at 40.486730, -96.818525. It is north on SW 72nd Road in Gage County, just east of Clatonia. The cemetery is to the west just past Clatonia Creek and the Union Pacific railroad tracks.]\n\n“Dora Oehlerking Helms came to America from Germany with her four year old daughter, Dora, in 1863. She had been told women were scarce in America, and that there were German men who wanted to marry German women. She married Fred Wehnes Jan. 10, 1864. They had a son Henry Wehnes born September 3, 1865 and a son Fred Wehnes. After William and Dora were married the two Wehnes boys, Henry and Fred, lived with them. John, the baby of Anna and William, came back to live with them, William’s three older children, as well did Dora’s oldest daughter Dora. Lizzie and Dora became very good friends. They all lived on the Marsh farm two miles east an done half mile north to Clatonia, Nebraska. William and Dora raised eight children. Dora married Phillip Fix……… Henry Wehnes was born September 3, 1865, and died March 10, 1929. He married Anne. …… They had eight children. 1. Henry Wehnes: 2. Elmer Wehnes, Killene,Texas: 3. Art Wehnes, Red Cloud, Nebraska: 4. Lillian Wehnes, St. Louis, Missouri 4. Lillian Wehnes, St. Louis, Missouri: 5. Sylvia Gartner, Hastings, Nebraska: 6. Ethel Duden, Hastings, Nebraska: 7. Alma Davis, Ayr, Nebraska: 8. Rose Mercer, Omaha, Nebraska.” [Dora’s Obit – I lost the original source for this and would dearly love to find it again!]\n\n“Phillip (Fix) met Dora Katherine Marie Helms who was born February 7, 1859. When she was four years old, she came to America from Hanover, Germany with her mother and ten other women who came to find husbands. (that would be 1863) Men were scarce in Germany as many had been killed in earlier wars. They were very poor and had heard of rich opportunities in America about men needing wives.\n\nThese immigrant women came to Plattsmouth, Nebraska by train. As they got off the train they were chosen by men from the surrounding farming community. All found husbands, remained friends, and their children married each other and they were soon related in many ways.\n\nDora was living with her mother, Dorothea, and stepfather, William Marsh who were married in 1870. ”\n\nPhoto of Dora Oehlerking-Helms-Wehnes-Marsh\n\nDora was a sister to Jurgen Heinrich (‘Henry’) Fredrich Oehlerking who emigrated from Lüneburg and settled in the Murdock area, Cass Co., Nebraska and left descedants. She was the daughter of J Oehlerking and Katherine Demly.\n\nKatherine ‘Kate’ Oehlerking nee Demly was living in the Center Precinct, Cass Co., Nebraska in 1876 and 1877 with her son Henry Oehlerking in the Nebraska State Censuses. Henry and his wife are buried in the Emmanuel Evangelical Cemetery, near Louisville, Cass Co., Nebraska. She then appears in the 1885 Nebraska State Census with Dora. She probably died in Gage County, Nebraska somewhere after 1885.\n\nDora’s first husband was Johann Helms. He died in Germany. They had a daughter, Dora Kathrine Marie Helms.\n\nDora seems to have come to the United States around 1863 with a large group of other German women. Her brother came to the US in 1856 and settled in Illinois. He took out citizenship papers in 1859. Henry Oehlerking eventually come out to Cass County, Nebraska. [Many German settlers first settled in Illinois and then moved to Nebraska during this time period].\n\nShe married Fred John (Frederick Johann) Wehnes on 10 January 1864.\n\nFrederick Wehnes was granted 160 acres in Cass County through the warrant of Mrs. Louisa Thompson, widow of Harris M Thompson on 2 April 1866. [as pictured above]\n\nFrederick died unexpectedly on 1 February 1869 in Cass County.\n\nI was fortunate to find several newspaper references to his death and the disposal of his estate and the probates filed at the Cass County Courthouse by his son Henry. His children’s guardian appears to be Erhart Heebner. Erhart was one of many German settlers who came from Illinois to Nebraska. [I am not sure what the connection between Fred Wehnes and Erhart Heebner is – neighbours? friends? Did they know each other in the old country …?]\n\nShe would re-marry for a third time on 19 April 1869 in Cass Co., Nebraska, to William Marsh (Wilhelm Marsch) [she would have been pregnant with her son Frederick at this time as he was born in August of 1869!]. William was born on 23 September 1832 and died on 3 February 1915 in Gage Co., Nebraska and was buried in the Marsh Cemetery, Clatonia Township, Gage Co., Nebraska. [I have a copy of Dora’s marriage certificate to William Marsh – it is difficult to read but I would be happy to scan it for anyone interested.]\n\nWilliam Marsh’s first wife was Anna Maria (Mary) Steinmeyer. Her marker inscription in the Marsh Cemetery notes that she died on 19 September 1869 which would make her still living when Dora and William married. Her father, J. Henry Steinmeyer’s entry in History of Gage County, Nebraska notes she died in the year 1868 which seems much more likely.\n\n1870 US Census – She is living with her third husband in Gage Co., Nebraska (as Doris). His children by his first marriage : Henry (aged 12, born Hanover), Elizabeth (aged 1861, born Ohio), William (aged 7, born Ohio), John V Marsh (aged 4, born Nebraska). Also present are her daughter by her first marriage Dora Helms (as Doris Marsh, aged 11, born Hanover), her daughter from her second marriage, Mary (as Mary Marsh, aged 6, born Nebraska) and her sons by her second marriage, Henry Wehnes (as Henry Marsh, aged 4, born Nebraska) and Frederick Wehnes (as Frederick Marsh, aged 2, born Nebraska).

He has no profession listed.\n\nIn March of 1902 the people of the peaceful town of Alma, Nebraska along the banks of the Republican River would have even more reason to stay behind their doors aside from the chilly temperatures of late winter in the Great Plains. An unusual specter had taken to flitting about the streets.\n\nShe was no hand-wringing, sobbing specter in white, but unusually for the time she was clad from head to toe in black garments, a veil concealing her face and any attempts to correlate the specter to any past living soul. She was silent and quick, disappearing into thin air almost as fast as she would seem to make her presence known.\n\nAnd she made her presence known – to several of Alma’s most upstanding citizens, citizens whose honesty and integrity would normally make the among those scoffing at such an outlandish tale as a black-garbed ghost roaming the streets at night – but instead gave the stories a weight they might not otherwise have.\n\nOne of the first to see it was the local newspaper editor, Horace Stanley Wetherell. Working late one night at the newspaper office he looked up to see the figure glide past his window. He would follow it visually until it just vanished into the night, neither turning left nor right, just simply folding into the night. Maybe he was tired? Maybe he had imagined it.\n\nBut she would appear again several more times. The state Congressman, Ashton Shallenberger, would see her while back in town for business. The founder of the Bank of Alma he was working late into the night. Heading for his home on Fourth Street the black figure suddenly emerged from an alley and breezed past him – no douby raising the hairs on the congressman’s neck – and disappeared into the night some thirty feet past him.\n\nShe would make two separate appearance to both a father and his son : Frank Grigsby, the local carriage dealer, and his son, Bruce, a student at the state university. Frank Grigsby briefly turned ghost chaser one night as the specter whipped past him. He had almost caught up to the elusive figure when a horse and carriage appeared in the intersection. Undeterred the specter glided through the body of the horse, but Frank was also undeterred in his pursuit of the truth of the mysterious black figure. He would again close the gap when a young boy on his bike would come between him and the figure. The young boy, startled by the predicament of coming between a ghostly lady and the man in hot pursuit crashed into a nearby fence post. Frank stopped to help the young boy and the specter made its get-away … or so he believed.\n\nFrank headed back toward home but had only made it two blocks when the lady in black appeared. This time she was the pursuer. Grigsby ran for home, slamming and locking the bolts of the door, no doubt scaring his wife Annie to death.\n\nOne of the early scoffers of the “Nightwalker” tale was Wiley Schwartz. He was a local grocer and a deacon of the Methodist church. Leaving a prayer meeting one night, Schwartz would quickly turn into a believer. He had only gone a few feet into the night, walking home, when the hairs on the back of his neck prickled and turning to look over his shoulder he saw her – head to toe black, silent and swift – and she was heading toward him! Wiley made the rapid dash to his home, heart pounding, now very much a believer!\n\nTwo suppositions were put forth as to the identity of the mysterious figure, but no names seemed to come down to posterity and one seemed to be discounted. One belief was that a local man was either being haunted by the ghost of his late first wife or his current, unhappy second wife was taking a sort of revenge. The tale has that the first wife extracted a promise that he would not remarry – a promise he broke within two years. But his second marriage was far from blissful. Local wags wondered if the second wife had heard of his promise and had taken on the stark black garb and veil and become a specter to ‘haunt’ her husband. But the second wife’s had had her alibi being surreptitiously confirmed. Another story has that she was the ghost of another local lady that died in great suffering and continued to suffer into death. But this ghost was silent – no moans and shrieks one would expect from a specter in pain even after death.\n\nAs March gave away to April and the snows melted away and the bone-chilling winds that sweep the Plains states died down, so too did the tales of the Alma Nightwalker. Maybe she moved on, whatever earthly ties kept her there vanishing with the coming of Spring. Or maybe someone quietly responded to the plea for help posted in The Courier and performed the correct incantations or rituals to guide the black lady off into the night eternally.\n\nCongressman Ashton Cokayne Shallenberger would go on to become the 15th Governor of Nebraska not too long after this, serving from 1909 to 1911. He would serve off and on as a Congressman and would pass away in 1938. He is buried in the Alma Cemetery.\n\nHorace Stanley Wetherell – I found him transcribed in several sources as H.S. Wetherald which made him a bit of a challenge to pin down. He was born in Logan Co., Illinois in 1856. He eventually moved to Post Falls, Idaho and would die and be buried there.\n\nWiley Schwartz lived in Alma until at least 1920. In 1900 he is listed as a grocer and in 1910 and 1920 as a whole goods merchandiser. He moved to Colorado and is buried in Longmont.\n\nFrank Grigsby (spelled Griggsby in several accounts) was the local carriage dealer. By 1910 he was in Kansas working as a loan broker and in 1920 he was in Los Angeles where he would die in 1930. His son Bruce would follow him out to California.\n\nSources :\n\n(1) The Courier, Lincoln NE (01 Mar 1902)\n\n(2) Lincoln Star Journal (15 March 1902)\n\n(3) The Red Cloud Chief (21 March 1902)\n\n(4) Haunted Heartland; Beth Scott and Michael Norman; pp. 360-362\n\n(5) wikipedia (Ashton Cokayne Shallenberger)\n\n(6) U.S. Censuses\n\nThis post contained an error – Albert Wesley Garcia does in fact belong to the OTHER Kinzie-Garcia family of Fairbury.
