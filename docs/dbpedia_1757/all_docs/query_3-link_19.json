        "text": "At this period of my life, I know not how an impartial judge would have decided the doubtful question of my being--my powers of intellect had shot beyond those of my compeers, while yet my form threatened to take a strongly feminine development. My complexion was singularly delicate, and my hair, though continually cropped, would retain its silky softness, and fell in many curls around my neck and brow. At long intervals, my usually robust health was interrupted by fits of indisposition, each of which seemed a sort of crisis, a struggle between death and life. Strange to say, nature had endowed me with rare beauty. I grew tall and slender, my limbs were finely moulded, and my head might have been cited as a perfect model of classic grace. This beauty, under other circumstances, might have been a blessing; as it was, it proved the curse and torment of my life. In vain would I have shrunk into obscurity--I could nowhere show myself without being observed and pointed out of all. Women often gave me proofs of a stronger interest than any inspired by mere benevolence, while the eyes of men so scrutinized me that I was fain to hide myself from them with a perturbation for which I could scarce account to myself. I was anxious to propitiate the good will of all, but any intimacy beyond that of ordinary friendship was incomprehensible to me. For man or woman, as such, I felt an entire indifference--when I wished to trifle, I preferred the latter, when I wished to reason gravely, I chose the former. I sought sympathy from women, advice from men, but love from neither. Like all other young creatures, I was gladly in the company of the gay and of the gentle, but I could not be in it long without learning that a human soul, simply as such, and not invested with the capacity of either entire possession or entire surrender, has but a lame and unsatisfactory part to play in this world.\n\nIn the village that surrounded us, my college companions had many female friends, among whom I gradually became known. These pretty moths consumed no small portion of our learned leisure, and our holidays were entirely consecrated to their service. On these occasions, we often arranged parties of pleasure to various caves, ruins, and woods in the romantic neighbourhood, in which every youth was cavalier to some fair maiden, and the time was improved by most of them for the establishment of relations of a more or less intimate nature. Of these, some were passionate, some sentimental, some transitory, some of life long duration, but all partaking of a feeling which was to me utterly incomprehensible. I enjoyed as keenly as any one a gallop on the greensward, or a ramble in the woods--our feasts and frolics, our songs and dances were all delightsome to me then in vivid reality, as now in softened remembrance--my eye was gratified by the grace and loveliness of the young girls, and my heart expanded in the sunshine of their gentle, happy nature, but they were to me even as the flowers, their sisters, and as the birds, their cousins, and as the distant clouds of heaven, and as all things else that were changeful and beautiful like unto them.\n\nIt was sufficiently easy for me to vie with my fellow-students in rendering every courtesy to these fair creatures. Like all the rest, I led their gentle feet over rocks and mountain paths, or bent my knee that they might spring from it into the saddle--I twined chaplets for their festivals, and verses for their songs, but no passionate thought or wish was interwoven with either. The enthusiasm expressed in my verses was vague and abstract in its character, and though of warmer blood and more generous nature than most of my fellows, I yet in comparison with them seemed cold and statue-like. The innocence and purity of the young girls did not however lead them to suspect any peculiarity of kind in me. They found me ever gay, affable, and gracefully bold--they often turned from the amorous gabble of a stupid lover, to seek amusement from me, and I can still recall the rage of a sentimental youth whose disdainful sweetheart, wearied, angry, or alarmed at the suit he was pressing, broke from him, and took refuge beside me, saying: I shall go to Laurence, for he never makes love.\n\nChapter 2nd\n\nThe relations which I have described lasted through a series of quiet, pleasant years, devoted otherwise to study, and marked by a gentle growth in the powers of thought and of action. Happy and golden do those days now look to me, though at the time, I was conscious of little more than a vague bien être, sometimes interrupted by deepest melancholy, and a hope of some thing far brighter and better, which methought time must soon bring me, but for which I am waiting still. Thus it is that we begin life in the expectation of positive enjoyment, and look impatiently for the day which shall see us very great, very rich, or very happy. It is reserved for the positive evils of life to teach us that the negative happiness of early youth has in it more of actual delight than any thing else that awaits us; and that, from the toils and responsibilities of active life, and from the satiety of luxurious indulgence, we are fain to turn back, and remember with longing the days in which we were neither oppressed with business, nor worn out with anxiety nor ennuyé by the absence of either.\n\nYet the struggle from childhood to comparative maturity had had for me its secret agonies, its hours of depression and desolation--of these, I do not speak--I have never revealed them--I have never willingly laid upon another the lightest portion of the burthen which it was given to me to bear through life. Thus far, at least, God has ever been my friend, he has ever given me courage to support it.\n\n\"Laurence\" said he \"you have passed, thus far, a better examination than any of us. Are you not satisfied with your success? Do you still intend to present your poem for the prize tomorrow?\"\n\nI replied in the affirmative. [H]e continued: \"I implore you to listen to me. You are sure to receive the prize, and from Emma's hand. But for you, this happiness would be mine, but for you, I should still be as once I was, her favored one.\"\n\n\"As once you were?\" repeated I, with contemptuous disbelief.\n\n\"Yes, but let me say all that I have to say. You do not love this woman, you have never loved her, you are but playing with her, and here stands one who would peril his life to obtain the boon which to me were blessedness, which to you will be but a trifling and transient gratification.\"\n\n\"What is the end and aim of this discourse?\"\n\n\"It is briefly this--name your price, and sell me your poem.\"\n\n\"I am no Judas, to sell my soul for thirty pieces of silver.\"\n\n\"It shall be no mean price, my patrimony is large, ask whatever you will.\"\n\n\"If I should sell it thrice over, I could not make it yours\" said I, with some haughtiness. \"Children will claim their own parents.\"\n\n\"Then thus do I commit your first born to the flames,\" and before I could spring forward to prevent it, the excited youth had held my manuscript, which lay upon the table, in the blaze of the lamp--he waved it, flaming, around his head until nearly consumed, and then threw it from the window with a yell of triumph.\n\nI stood and smiled upon him. \"I will give you your revenge, if you wish it,\" said he.\n\n\"A demain\" said I, courteously waving my hand, \"I am in no hurry about it.\"\n\nHe looked at me in embarrassment and surprise, and was glad to seek the door.\n\nThat very evening and late into the night, I sat and talked with Emma Von P. Our conversation had wandered hither and thither, as freely as our thoughts, but these, though widely discursive, ran ever in parallels. She had sung her sweetest, looked her beautifullest, and her discourse had been, as it ever was, full of point and of meaning. We had entered into a playful battle, tilting with golden lances, and pelting each other with rose leaves. At length, we became silent, she from very weariness, while I grew absorbed in painful forebodings. The conviction had forced itself more and more upon my mind that beneath Emma's jests there lurked a deep & dreadful earnest. I had begun to experience a malaise, an anxiety in her presence, for I felt the hidden strength of her nature, and I knew that it would soon be turned against her own happiness, and my peace. It was well, methought, that the hour of our separation was so near at hand.\n\n\"We have been very merry, and yet I am so sad!\" sighed my companion from her corner of the causense.\n\n\"Your ladyship has then a fearful habit of deception, for I have observed that whenever you have been gayest, you turn to me with the smile yet on your lips to tell me that you are so sad!\"\n\n\"Sadness and mirth are ever as near to each other as life and death\" answered she musingly, \"and there is always something of the one in the other.\"\n\nAnother pause: \"what am I like?\" said Emma to me.\n\n\"You are like a beautiful flower on an iron stem. [T]he flower will fade, the iron will kill, so that you are mortal in yourself, and mortal to others.\"\n\n\"Thanks for a very bad compliment--shall I tell you what you are like?\"\n\n\"Most certainly\"--\"You are like this marble against which I lean my head, whose pulses throb so that there seems to be a pulse in the cold stone itself--thus, a heart that is near you may think to feel the presence of one in you, but it is all marble, only marble.\"\n\nAfter a moment's silence, she continued: \"How old are you, Laurence?\"\n\n\"Nigh upon twenty one.\"\n\n\"Nearly twenty one? quite a man then, and still a trifler.\" Exquisitely touching was the tone in which this gentle reproach was uttered. I durst not betray the emotion it caused me, and my reply was cold and almost rude. \"You have always invited me to trifle\" I said, \"and I thought that it was altogether to your taste, but since you have had enough of it, good night.\"\n\nOh, Emma! this should have been our last good night. As I left the house, she called me back. I heard her steps as she ran to overtake me, but I hastened mine, and did not look back. She returned and closed the door abruptly, but I heard a sob, as I passed near her window, on my way home.\n\n_____________________\n\nOn the afternoon of the day following, we were marshalled in the chapel of the college, for the reading of the prize poems. As we entered, we found the area filled by the members of the junior classes, the faculty of the college, our young friends of the neighbourhood; and some distinguished guests from the castle. At the upper end was the rostrum from which, by turns, we were to make our appeal to the favour of the audience--upon either side of this was a raised seat, on one of which was seated the chancellor of the University, and on the other, as upon a throne, our fair queen of love and beauty, Emma Von P. to whom men forgave the pangs she sent to their hearts, for the delight she gave their eyes. It is so great a pleasure to see a woman finely trained and developed in person and in character. Your crude ore is cumbrous to carry, and difficult of estimation, but though Emma bore the guinea stamp of high breeding, she was yet of virgin gold, for a' that.\n\nThe compositions were really of a more respectable order than I had anticipated. There was unavoidably some pedantry displayed in the choice of subjects, and the young authors were obviously more familiar with their humanities than with humanity. It is true that we had a disquisition on the sufferings of Dido, and an ode commemorative of the constancy of Penelope, but I have often seen both of these heroines much more unkindly treated. There were several other productions, of which the theme alone could be called classic. A revolutionary poem followed, flaming and captious, at which the venerable Chancellor and other wigs there present winced somewhat. Then came a theological argument in blank verse, dogmatical, ambitious, and exceeding tedious to the young girls, delivered by a youth of pale complexion, red nose, and very indifferent digestion. After these exhibitions, Wilhelm really appeared to the greatest advantage, as he recited with a feeling voice a graceful lyric upon the ever old and ever new subject of love, into the closing lines of which was wrought an unmistakeable tribute to the charms of Emma. Universal applause followed his performance. He looked at Emma and at me, and seemed surprised to see a smile on my lips, and none on hers.\n\n\"I am the last, at least,\" said Wilhelm, with an air of satisfaction.\"\n\n\"You forget that the best and worst is yet to come, here is Laurence\"--Wilhelm hastily replied: \"Laurence has no poem.\"\n\nEmma overheard him, and changed colour, while she stole at me an anxious and inquiring glance.\n\n\"How know you that, Wilhelm?\" said I--the countenance of my rival was instantly darkened. As my name was called, I ascended the platform, stated to the audience that my manuscript had accidentally been destroyed and requested permission to repeat memoratà, instead of reading my poem. This was granted me, as a matter of course. Then, with a voice of silvery sweetness, and in a measure peculiarly my own, I sang the sufferings of a soul exiled from heaven, and sent into this world invested with the semblance, but not the attributes of humanity. I told of its solitary wanderings on earth, how it could nothing make, nothing possess--how its abstract orphanhood could establish no relationship, and extort no sympathy from the souls of men, veiled in a flesh of whose wants and powers it knew nothing. The alternative was then offered to it of becoming utterly mortal, or of returning to its ghostland, and I closed with some thrilling numbers descriptive of the noble scorn with which the pure spirit refused to bear the unworthy burthen of the flesh, once contemplated and understood, and the free and fearless courage with which it spread its wings, and flew back to the bosom of its God. My audience was deeply and attentively silent, and when my voice ceased, one long-drawn breath betrayed the interest with which I had been heard.\n\nThe committee appointed to decide upon the adjudication of the prize did not include (Deo sit gratias) the faculty of the college. It was composed of several gentlemen of the neighbourhood, among whom was the well accomplished Baron L--, who was present with several foreigners, his friends, and guests. The committee retired into an anteroom, whence they shortly returned, having been quite unanimous in their decision. The Baron, as foreman of the Jury, addressed the chancellor, and informed him that they had agreed, without one dissenting voice, to adjudge the prized to M. Laurence de --. The Chancellor at first replied by a well bred stare and the whole Council of Pedagogues unhesitatingly expressed their disapproval.\n\n\"The poem of M. Laurence bears no marks of historical research,\" murmured the expounder of Sallust.\n\n\"In a theological point of view, it is an entire fallacy,\" growled the Doctor Divinitatis.\n\n\"There is nothing in it which would lead one to suppose that the author had been thoroughly grounded by me in trigonometry, integral calculus, conic sections, et alia,\" remarked the man of cubes and decahedrons.\n\n\"It is at least highly, beautifully poetical,\" rejoined the Baron, in his courtliest manner, \"and as we came hither to listen to poems, and to decide upon their merits as such, you must allow me in the name of my friends of the Committee, to announce to the company the name of M. Laurence as the recipient of the prize, and to offer him our warmest thanks and congratulations upon his public desert of it.\"\n\nA loud burst of applause confirmed the sanction of the whole assembly upon his decision. Some reply on my part seemed necessary, but I could only say to the Baron: \"I have as yet small pretensions to knowledge of any kind. [T]hanks to you, who have recognized in me the presence of the poetic power.\"\n\nTurning from him, I knelt at Emma's feet to receive the prize--it was a crown woven of velvet oak leaves with golden acorns. I felt the tremulousness of the hand that placed it on my head, I saw by the tearful smile with which she greeted me, that her heart was moved at once to joy and grief. She was proud and happy in my triumph, but that another should have dedicated his services to her, while the poem of her chosen one bore no trace of her, this grieved her deeply. Yet she was alike incapable of feeling or of showing a petty vexation, and when she spoke to her[sic], her voice and her words were deeply sympathetic.\n\n\"Oh, Laurence, your flight is lofty, and the heaven you dwell in is beautiful, but why do you take no one with you?\"\n\n\"Could you not follow me then, Emma?\"\n\n\"Did you expect it?\"--\"Yes--at least I hoped it. I have often wished to talk with you of the relations of pure spirit.\"\n\n\"Laurence, I hope that you are not one of those unsexed souls.\"\n\n\"Have you never been one?\" said I.\n\n\"Never,\" she replied, \"since I have learned what it is to be a woman.\"\n\nThese words made a strong impression upon me--\"what is it to be a woman?\" I asked of myself: \"It is obviously a matter of which I have small conception.\"\n\nAs I looked from Emma's countenance, I saw that Wilhelm stood near, and glared on us with angry eyes. I went up to him, and offered him my hand.\n\n\"Come, Wilhelm, you cannot be angry that I have taken my revenge--I am at least glad that it is one which involves no injury to you--\"Why do you look so savagely upon me?\" I continued. \"I have entirely forgiven your foolish freak of last night.\"\n\n\"I shall never forgive you,\" muttered Wilhelm between his teeth.\n\nI was was [sic] ordered to wear my wreath through the evening. Music now sounded in the hall, and couples stood up to dance. I gave my arm to Emma, and led her to the head of the Quadrille. Her momentary sadness had passed away, and as she began to tread her graceful measure, she turned upon me a look of love and delight so radiant, that it sent a strange thrill to the very core of my frozen heart, and again I asked of myself: \"what is it to be a woman?\"\n\nAs we stood together in an interval of repose, I could not avoid overhearing the conversation of two strangers who occupied a place behind me, and of whom one spoke with a strongly marked Southern accent.\n\n\"What a beautiful antique head is this of the young Laureate's,\" remarked one, \"so delicately chiselled, so finely set, one might say an Antinoüs, a Mercury, almost an Apollo.\"\n\n\"None of these\" replied the Italian \"his beauty is of a more vague and undecided character--it is a face and form of strange contradictions--the eye and brow command, while the mouth persuades.\"\n\n\"The motions and gestures too are peculiar.\"\n\n\"Do you not see a striking resemblance to the lovely hermaphrodite in the villa Borghese?\"\n\nI heard no more--a mist came before my eyes, and a deadly faintness over my heart. With a hurried apology, I resigned Emma to the eager Wilhelm, and staggered to the open air--some minutes passed before I could recover strength to regain my room.\n\nChapter\n\nOnce alone, in my own room, I could breathe more freely, but my whole being had received a shock, an impetus that hurried it to some deed, some resolution, I knew not what. A sort of galvanic agony had taken possession of my body, and forces foreign to itself were playing wildly with it. My vestments seemed to gird in my swelling heart, and I tore them off, half resolved to wear them no more. I was incapable of thought or of reason, but my brain was in a state of the highest spontaneous action, and a thousand horrible images of disgrace, despair, and utter confusion crowded each other in and out of my mind, like figures in a fever dream. Every thing around me seemed instinct with life--the very walls had eyes to spy out my secret, and tongues to betray it. I hurried hither and thither to escape the scrutiny of mocking spectres, who, all unseen, were yet present to me, and with hideous laughter followed me every where. At length, in very desperation, I threw myself, half undressed, on my bed, and drawing its covering around me, attempted to close my eyes, and compelled myself to lie still. Gradually, the confusion of my thoughts became greater, but less painful--the sounds of music and laughter became fainter in my ears, and soon ceased altogether. I know not how long it was before a light footstep at my bedside, told me that I must have been asleep.\n\nA light footstep? oh how light! a gliding form, a gentle but fervent voice. Could it be? I rubbed my eyes, I was fully awake, and Emma, in all her brilliant beauty, stood before me.\n\n\"You were ill, dearest Laurence, and I could not rest until I had seen you--you are to leave tomorrow, and I could not live without one kind farewell from you. Oh Laurence, Laurence, do not look at me thus--you know well, you have long known what I am here to tell you.\"\n\nI raised my head from the pillow and looked into her eyes. That look must have expressed the horror I felt, for it seemed to destroy the momentary courage which had given firmness to her step, and clearness to her voice. She sank upon her knees beside me, she buried her face in the curtain that hung near us, and was silent for a moment--then, raising it again, she clasped my knees, and spoke with a rapid, unequal, faltering intonation, as if she feared that her strength would desert her before she could speak out her meaning. \"Listen to me Laurence\" she said: Atwo deaths were before me. If I sought you not, I died of longing, if I came to you, I died of shame. The first I have long endured, it is slowly feeding upon my life--if the second fate must be mine, be merciful, and kill me quick.[\"] In stony silence, I sat and listened--she continued: \"I do not ask you to marry me, Laurence, I am still young, rich, and perhaps handsome, but I do not pretend to be worthy of you--had I such a hope, I should scarce be at your feet, but look you, I am here alone, in your room, in your power, at dead of night--you cannot misinterpret this, it must convince you that I love you better than life, better than honour, better than my own soul and God. Give me but this one night, but this one hour--do you ask where I shall be tomorrow? I can die tomorrow--I shall have been happy.\"\n\nI roused myself at length from my stupor--\"Emma,\" said I, laying on hers a hand so cold that she started. \"Emma, as you value your soul's peace, fly--fly from me, and think of me only as you think of the dead.\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried Emma: \"you may smite me, you may kill me, but I will die here at your feet--my last look shall be on you--my last prayer shall bless you.\"\n\nI pointed to the time piece on the mantel, and said: \"Emma, this is madness--to yield to it would be fatal to both of us. One of us must leave this room for the night, I give you five minutes to decide which it shall be.\"\n\nShe sprang to her feet, and stood before me, a beautiful impersonation of scorn and fury. Lightnings flashed from her eyes--a curse rose to her lips and died there--those lips were made for blessings only--tears and convulsive sobs burst forth instead, and brokenly these words: \"you cannot cannot--cannot!\"\n\n\"Listen to me, dearest Emma,\" I said, and drew her to a seat beside me--\"listen to me--can you bear to hear the truth? will you hate me for telling it to you?\"\n\n\"Tell it gently\" she replied, with averted eyes. I continued: AEmma, your love is too beautiful, too glorious a thing to be thrown away upon one who can never make you his. There lies between us a deep, mysterious gulf, seek not to fathom it--with me, your human destiny would be hopelessly imperfect--were I to wed you, I should indeed deserve your curse.\" She was silent, and I proceeded: \"there are between human beings relations independent of sex, relations of pure spirit, of heavenly sympathy, of immaterial and undying affinities--such are the only relations that can exist between us, dearest Emma.\"\n\n\"Liar!\"--\"slanderer!\" such words are not often exchanged with impunity. \"I will die in defence of Emma's honour\" cried I. \"You shall die to avenge it,\" shouted Wilhelm. Another moment, and we closed in mortal combat.\n\nWilhelm fought with the ferocity of a tiger, almost it seemed to me, with the strength of one. At first, I was quite overwhelmed by the fury of his attack, yet scarcely daunted by it for I felt that his very rashness and violence must, in the end, defeat themselves. I cannot say whether it was by greater coolness, quickness of eye, or agility of body that the struggle was decided in my favour--this only I remember, that Wilhelm lay before me, prostrate and disarmed while with the point of my weapon at his throat. I held him at my mercy. At this moment, I paused. The steel that had let out our blood had perchance let out with it some of our madness, but, be that as it may, I could not slay the man now that I held him, defenceless in my grasp. I looked earnestly in his face, it was not the face of a coward. Even in the presence of death, his cheek blanched not, his look quailed not, and in his desperate danger, he even strove to taunt me.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to kill me\" said he, with a bitter laugh: \"it is safest, dead men tell no tales.\"\n\nI threw away my sword: \"I am not afraid to let you live,\" was my only answer. Wilhelm arose, and stood in silent surprize.\n\n\"Ask any thing of me but thanks,\" he said at length \"you have made the boon of life too worthless to me that I should thank you for it.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to ask of you for myself, but Wilhelm, as I have spared you, so I pray you to spare one whose reputation is in your power, even as your life has been in mine.\"\n\n\"Curses on her! she has trifled with me, scorned me, ruined herself. Is there any earthly reason why I should spare her?\"\n\n\"Because you have loved her, because she is dying, most of all, because she is innocent.\"\n\n\"Prove to me her innocence, and I swear to respect it\" replied Wilhelm.\n\nI was silent. I saw clearly that the fates demanded an expiatory sacrifice, but the victim appointed was neither Wilhelm nor Emma. It was my own pride, almost my own life that I was called upon to immolate in behalf of one who had not hesitated to give up every thing for me. I must myself endure that fearful crucifixion. I must tear off that innermost sacred veil that shielded from scorn and pity the secret of my fate, and wrap it around Emma's defenceless honour. I was silent, but only for a moment. Oh Truth! oh Emma! thank God, in that hour of trial, I loved you better than myself.\n\n\"Prove it--\" repeated Wilhelm, in a defiant tone.\n\n\"I will do so,\" I replied, [\"]but let me first tell you that the secret I am about to impart is not entrusted to you as a mark of confidence, you have deserved nothing of the kind from me. It is my desire to do justice to Emma alone that induces me to inform you of a fact, which, but for her unhappy position, would concern none but myself. Tell me now, Wilhelm, have I fought like a man?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Have I treated you like a man?\"\n\n\"I must say that you have.\"\n\n\"Have I, in all my college life maintained the integrity, the courage, the honour of a man?\"\n\n\"Truly, I think so.\"\n\n\"Wilhelm, in all save these, I am none.\"\n\nI did not repent me of my words, once spoken, but I felt that time, that eternity could never wring from me a confession more agonizing.\n\nI turned me to depart, but I had not gone far, before Wilhelm came up to me, and laid his hand on my arm. He looked earnestly in my face, with an expression of doubt and wonder.\n\n\"You are no woman,\" said he, after a deliberate survey of my face and person.\n\n\"No\" I replied, with a horrible sort of calmness: \"I am no man, no woman, nothing. Let me go,\" and I pushed him from me, but he again seized me by both hands, and I saw in the cold moonlight that tears stood in his eyes.\n\n\"Laurence\" he cried: \"the sacrifice you have just made is heroic, and however lightly you may esteem me, I fully appreciate it--you have spared me, you have shielded Emma, and you cannot know that you have not ruined yourself. Hear me then while I swear, by the bloody agony of Christ, that the words you have spoken are, to all save me, as though they had never been uttered.\"\n\nWilhelm spoke in a tone of the deepest feeling, and as he did so, raised his right hand to heaven, so that his promise had all the solemnity of an oath.\n\n\"The vow is now registered in heaven\" continued he, \"and now tell me, what can I do to evince my gratitude for your forbearance, my appreciation of your noble conduct?[\"]\n\nI pointed, as nearly as I could, in the direction of Emma's dwelling--Wilhelm well understood the signal. \"Remember her, and forget me,\" I said.\n\nWe parted sadly, but in perfect kindness.\n\nCold as duty, and stern as fate, the moon looked down upon me--and I was alone.\n\nHome! I might indeed have been wise enough to know that no such place existed for me. What hearth, what heart would welcome me as its cherished guest? The only breast that had ever harboured my love had been as fearfully punished for its fondness as though it had opened its doors to a fiend, in the form of an angel.\n\nDim and vague indeed were my impressions of the scenes and companions of my childhood; cold and repulsive my remembrance of those who had borne to me the relation but scarcely the love of parents. The mother that bore me was dead to me long, long before the day that bade me mourn her death. And my father? It was with reluctance that I gave him even the name. In many years I had not once seen him, or heard from him otherwise than through the medium of my tutor. He had indeed written to order that I should return to him immediately upon the close of the term, and had enclosed a sum of money amply sufficient for my expenses, but his letter was perfectly innocent of any hypocrisy of affection, and on reading it, I could not but acknowledge that he at least was entirely candid and constant in his indifference to his child. His parental tenderness, if any thing in his horny heart deserved the name, was doubtless monopolized by my younger brother, in whose person, but for my rights of primogeniture, would have been combined the succession of two princely estates.\n\nStill, in my slowly weaned heart there dwelt the vision of a place where I had played in happy freedom, before I had borne the burthen of life, and learned how doubly heavy it was destined to be for me. There came to me images of trees that I had climbed, of waters that had held me in their sunny embrace, of grassy meadows on which I had laid me down to watch the gorgeous glory of sunset or the quiet beauty of a starry night. There lingered yet in my ear the echo of merry voices, and I thought that the laughing playmates who had so often caressed and tormented me still formed a rosy garland, of which I was the only blighted flower. The horrible event too which was still too fresh in my mind to be a memory, how did it chase me to some ark of safety, some spot sacred to kindest affections, to some heart whose sympathy should be spontaneous, whose love should be the involuntary tribute of nature. It was then with feelings of a mingled nature that I sought my father's house, yet in them hope predominated, and the very desperation of my condition, the sore need of my heart inspired me with a certain confidence in the ready succour and compassion of those nearest to me.\n\nOnce arrived, it needed little observation to dispel these consoling illusions. Cold and brief was my father's greeting, icy cold seemed the family circle that had been gathered to receive me. If the dinner that followed was not cold, it was at least utterly chilling and ungenial in its effects. The wine warmed no one, the food nourished no one--there were long pauses which nobody dared to interrupt, and brief remarks to which no one cared to reply. Paternus seemed to be the Evil Genius, the master magician of the feast, and one could have dreamed that the other figures around the table had been so many automata, animated only by his will. When he ate, the company ate, their very knives and forks keeping time with his. When he spoke, they listened and replied--when his voice ceased, they subsided into sympathetic silence. The dessert having been got through with, my health having been formally proposed and mechanically drunk, I wondered whether he would leave them rooted in their places until the next day, at the same hour; but he gave the signal of command, and they rose in concert, and marched like well drilled soldiers back to the drawing room.\n\nI found my sisters changed past all remembrance, the world, matrimony and maternity having had full sway over them. The elder of them had married money, the younger had married love. Money was of course stupid and tedious, Love was a pretty man, but had probably seen his best days. Lady Money was cold and haughty, and iced me with a glittering smile. Lady Love was shy and timid, yet she glanced kindly at me when Paternus was not looking. Their children were not introduced at desert [sic], kept away doubtless in the fear lest they might catch their death of cold of their grandfather.\n\nAfter having endured for an hour or two this purgatorial entertainment, it was a relief to hear a bounding step in the entry, and to see on the opening of the door, the glowing countenance of a beautiful boy. This was my brother, Philip, whom I had never before seen. The grim visage of Paternus relaxed into a smile at his approach, and patting him on the head, bade him go and shake hands with his brother. The boy glanced around the room, and having singled me out from the company, ran up to me, threw his arms about my neck and gave me, after his childish fashion, the heartiest welcome. Having hugged me to the extent of his ability, he drew back and took a survey of my person. It seemed on the whole not to displease him.\n\n\"Is your name Laurence?\" he asked. I nodded affirmatively.\n\n\"I though so; my name is Philip, but they call me Phil. I have been wanting a brother for a long time, but I am afraid that you are too old to play with me.\"\n\n\"No indeed, I can shew you many fine games.\"\n\n\"Then you will be very kind--pray tell me what you have brought in that big trunk.\"\n\n\"We will go and see, Phil,\" and by a sort of joint diplomacy of the child=s and of mine was effected a speedy escape from the forbidding presence in which, as no one seemed to be wanted, it was scarcely possible that any one should be missed.\n\n\"Somehow I have never much to say before papa\" observed Phil confidentially, when we were once out of sight and of hearing. AHe doesn't talk much himself and it seems to me that he does not like to have other people talk.[A]\n\n\"Is he in one of his best moods tonight? I carelessly inquired.\n\n\"Verbs have moods,\" said master Phil, proud to show his newly acquired grammatical knowledge. \"Father is a common noun.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven, an uncommon one. Is he as pleasant as usual tonight?\"\n\n\"I don't think that he ever is pleasant.\"\n\n\"Well, is he in a good humour, or in a bad one?\"\n\n\"Why, brother Laurence, there is little difference in him when he is in a good humour and when he is not that I never can tell how it is.\" Truly, a satisfactory answer.\n\nBut we were not to be so easily let off from the family penance. Phil was soon deep in the mysteries of my dressing case and busied himself in opening every box drawer and inquiring its use. I was gazing with a mournful pleasure upon his fair face, and as I drew him to me, and looked in his eyes, I said to myself: \"thou art indeed my own brother, my eyes and heart tell me so; but are we, can we be the children of that domestic iceberg?\"\n\nAt this moment a summons came to us from the drawing room, where coffee and cards awaited us. Excusing myself from the latter, I entered into conversations with a young man, the chaplain of the family, and Phil's tutor. He seemed to me an amiable and genial person, and was anxious to be informed of my course of life and of study at the University. Thankful to pursue any subject which should lead me away from the unpleasant realities by which I was surrounded, I answered very fully all his questions, related anecdote after anecdote, and became so entirely emancipated from the yoke of the present that I was quite surprised at the end of the evening to find a knot of listeners gathered around us, and had been equally unconscious of the fact that Paternus, ensconced behind his evening gazette, had not lost a word of our conversation.\n\nWelcome indeed was the nod of the master that released us all from further attendance upon us [sic] and dismissed us like a band of culprits, silent and ashamed, to the shelter of our bed chambers. I said to myself as I bade him good night: \"I am glad that I do not love him--if habits of early intercourse had rendered him dear to me, I should feel a pang at every cold word and look of his.\"\n\nAn hour later, and the dirge is hushed. The mourners have gone their way to sleep and to forget--the saddest of them shall arise tomorrow, glad that the dead is buried out of their sight, glad that the mystic being they love and dread has no longer any claim upon them, any fellowship with them. Can you blame them? God himself--is not a God of the dead.\n\nDid I say that she was buried? not yet, thank God, not yet. She lies before the high altar--its consecrated torches lend a gentle, life giving light to her dead beauty. She lies here alone with God, and the faithful priest who watched her remains, who will ask no reward to pray for her sweet spirit. Yield thy place to me, holy man--thou cannot pray for her as I can, thou art not bound to her as I am. Dost thou ask where I shall be tomorrow? I may be mad tomorrow.\n\nA desperate man knelt at Emma's feet, as Emma had knelt at his--tears, groans and prayers he offered up at that holy shrine--when these were exhausted, he was mute and listened to voices heard never before. It is long but blessed, a night that we pass with the dead we love, and the dawn that succeeds it may usher in a better day than that which follows upon a bridal feast. No lover in the arms of his mistress ever received consolation so divine as that which came to me from the lips of that silent one, that night. Promises of divine guidance, of angelic companionship, assurances of immortal blessedness, and encouragements to a life of earnest striving and hope--all these were poured upon me as from a full urn, from the heart that had so loved me. Does any one doubt whither [sic] the souls of the dead have power to bless us? Let me tell such an one, solemnly and truly, that in my best hours, when the passionate music and the angry discords of life have been hushed and silent enough for the soul to hear other sounds than those of earth, then the holy dead, the living dead have walked with me, have spoken with me, and my heart and life have borne the record of their heavenly messages.\n\nLet me say moreover that to these our periods of reception are appointed corresponding periods of reproduction. The sacred fire shall not merely afford us light and heat--it is like the genial warmth of Nature, quickening, fruitful, life-giving. The abstract truth revealed to us in our hour of agonizing prayer, of rapt meditation, grows into strength and courage in our day of trial and of action, and heavenly wisdom, the soul of our soul, becomes mortal and visible in heroic conflict in holy words and deeds, in patient labour, in calm endurance.\n\nThus did I pass the night. When the grey light of dawn warned me to recommence my journey, I arose and went on my way with gladness. I had laid down at Emma's feet the burthen of my humanity. I had taken up the heavier but more precious one of immortality. Upon her bosom I laid my poet's wreath--upon her lips I imprisoned the first, last kiss that woman and woman's love ever wrung from mine.\n\nChapter\n\nCome, earnest labour, earnest thought,\n\nLife must fulfill, and not destroy;\n\nA noble sorrow, nobly borne\n\nIs better than a vulgar joy.\n\nI wearied of my travels ere they were well begun. The unrest of the soul is fed, not subdued, by change of scene and of place. Go where I might, I sought always something that I could not find, and carried with me something that I could nowhere lay down. Cities, churches, palaces, the pride and show of the ancient world, spread themselves in vain before me. I wandered among them with listless gaze and languid movements, wondering only to find each new place so like the last, so unlike any thing that I wished or cared to see. It was a new thing to me, the utter despondency, this worm feeding at the heart and ever devouring, and never satisfied. I asked myself why I had never before known it--Nature had wronged me from my birth, my father's heart had repudiated me from my early childhood, how was it then that I had hitherto been happy? Ah! it was that I had been a child, and the kind Providence of childhood had surrounded me with its bulwarks of ignorance and innocence. Now, I had been loved, and the sweet dream was gone. I had been wronged, and the cruel sting remained. Was there aught that could fill the void of the one, or heal the wound of the other? I shook my head, shut back the proud tears in my heart, and went sullenly on my way, scarce knowing or caring whither.\n\nIt was not long before I found the very spot I sought. Having stopped one day at a village inn to repair some damage sustained by my travelling carriage, I was tempted by the beauty of the surrounding country to leave the dingy atmosphere of the Gasthof, and stroll forth to the green shades that lay beyond the town. I did not long continue to hold the fair landscape in my eye. That introversion of thought which is called absence of mind had grown so habitual to me, that I wandered in this lovely place even as in a desert waste, or crowded street, glad only of the cool air, the loneliness, and the silence that permitted me to hold undisturbed converse with myself. I had followed a narrow side path that led me into the recesses of the wood, and ere I was well aware, I had wound myself deep into its gentle secrets. The little path still hurried me on, now dodging behind the trees, now showing itself again, like a shy but friendly fairy, till having conducted me to a little wilderness of shade, it made an awkward bow and left me. Here was shade so deep that the sun scarcely pierced it, and I reluctantly abandoned the idea of proceeding further, lest I should quite lose myself in the leafy labyrinth. I was about to retrace my footsteps when I caught a glimpse of something like a stone wall, beyond the thick screen of underwood. With some little trouble, I forced myself a way between brambles, bushes, and low hanging boughs and soon emerged into an open space in the midst of which stood the object that had attracted my attention. This was a low and ancient structure of unhewn stone, overgrown with mosses and ivy. It stood in the centre of the little lawn, a neglected garden was on one side of it, on the other a spring of pure water flowed into a venerable stone basin. It appeared to me the very beau-ideal of a hermitage, and before I had crossed the threshold, I longed to take possession of it. The main entrance to the building was open to wind and weather, but it led only to a ruinous gallery on the left. On the right my progress was impeded by a solid oaken door, which resisted all my efforts to force it open. Nothing remained for me but to find my way back as well as I might to the little path, and then to the high road, and then to the village inn, where I straitway began to question the host concerning the history of the Lodge in the Wilderness. I learned from him that it had been for many, many years the property of a noble family holding large possessions in the neighbourhood. The right wing of the building had been fitted up and occupied from time to time by the late Count _________, an eccentric representant [sic] of the family, who had died unmarried, bequeathing his large estates to his nephew. The Count had been, said the Host, a man of wondrous learning, but much study had made him mad. He had distinguished himself in public life, but often retired hither from the cares and tumult of the great world, to enjoy the silent companionship of books. He had done so too often for his own good, the host mused, and quoted the authority of the village priest, to the effect that the noble Count would have enjoyed a longer life, and would have made a more edifying death, if he had married a wife, gone to mass, and settled the affairs of his soul with a jolly confessor over a flask of Rhenish, instead of choosing to settle them alone with the devil as (he opined) had been the case. It had even been thought by some that the Count did not rest quietly in his grave--here the narrator doubly crossed himself, and waited for a word of encouragement to pour forth a flood of ghost stories bottled up to suit the demands of his customers. I carefully refrained however from drawing the cork, and proceeded to inquire for some one who should be able to unlock for me the oaken door, and let me into the secrets of the solitary abode. The present Incumbent had long been travelling in foreign parts, they told me; and had rarely if ever visited the spot in question. His agent was easily found, and persuaded to accompany me thither, and having provided ourselves with the key, we set forth together for the wood, whose outskirts by this time where softly tinged with the golden light of sunset.\n\nWe were soon there, and my sudden conceived passion for the little spot returned with renewed force, as I saw it in the lovely summer twilight. The door once opened, we passed into an apartment of moderate size, but of beautiful proportions, fitted up as a study. The pointed windows, curiously carved woodwork, and ancient furniture of the room were all in perfect keeping with each other. The walls were adorned with well filled bookshelves, a massive writing table occupied the centre, and a few heavy chairs of the most antique fashion completed the appointments of the room. Beyond it lay a small bed chamber, scantily, almost meanly furnished, and from the further door of this, a narrow corridor led to a chapel of small extension, finished in the old Gothic style.\n\nThis chapel bore the only traces of luxe to be found in the whole anchoritic establishment. Its floor was paved with precious marbles, and its screen was richly and wondrously carved. Behind the altar, a window of magnificent stained glass shed throughout the place a truly magical light; but the altar itself was scarcely such as one might have expected to see there. It was simply hewn of pure white marble, and upon it stood only a marble cross. No portraits of saints, no luxury of religious symbols appeared on the walls, but that upon the left of the altar supported a strange monumental conceit. This was a sculptured bas-relief, describing the head and bust of a female figure. The forms of the neck and shoulders were delicately chiselled, and the graceful hands were tenderly clasped upon the rounded bosom; but a strange caprice of art concealed the features that should [have] given the charm of soul to such perfect physical beauty. The sculptor, and his patron, had kept their secret--a marble veil covered the face, as hopeless as the grave. Beneath it was simply inscribed the name: Angela.\n\nMy companion was a man of some understanding and had seen something of the world beyond the bounds of his native village--he seemed anxious to show himself superior to vulgar prejudice and superstition. \"You know, Sir\" said he \"the follies of these poor rustics who have had neither experience nor education--this appears in nothing more than in their judgements of those above them. The Count was one who dwelt much alone, ergo, he was mad. He followed his own ideas in matters of religion, ergo, he was a skeptic and an infidel. He studied late into the night and his light always appeared at midnight in the chapel, ergo, he was in the habit of practicing unlawful arts, and had evil spirits for his familiars. I remember him only as a boy remembers one greatly his superior in years and in rank, but the image I have of him in my mind is so noble and so stately that I should grieve to lose it.\"\n\n\"Did you ever speak with him?\"\n\n\"He has often spoken with me. My father was his agent and I have brought many a message to him here. I found him sometimes at his books, sometimes walking in the garden. His face was often pale and haggard, and his eye looked sometimes bloodshot and sleepless, but he always greeted me kindly.\"\n\nFurther conversation shewed that the Count had been an earnest and thoughtful man, grave and at times devout. Yet had he led a varied life, and had done the state good service with sword and with pen. He had been familiar alike with court and camp and in his ancestral castle was wont to exercise a generous hospitality. By a scrupulous and exact division of his time and his duties, he had accomplished much in many ways. A part of every year he devoted to his Sovereign--part to society, a part to travel, and a part to prayer, solitude, and abstinence. In this little retreat, he kept his yearly Ramadan. Flying alike from luxury and from worldly labour, he found here a welcome refuge, green, cool, and melodious with the songs of many birds. During his annual visit to this sacred spot, he had ever lived in entire seclusion, and with the most ascetic simplicity. The garden and the spring supplied his frugal meals, his own hands administered to his necessities, and he slept upon a bed to the hardness of which my aching limbs were able, after one night, to testify. A cursory glance at the bookshelves confirmed the statement that this had been a place specially devoted to religious study and devout contemplation. I saw there no maps or charts, no books of history, political economy or romance. The library was a collection of tracts and treatises, metaphysical and theological, of all ages and in all languages.\n\nPlatonics and Mystics of the ancient time were there, and the early Christian fathers. The chroniclers and expounders of the Roman church had their niche, but near to them in flagrant contradiction were the works of the sturdy Reformers, who had been to them Anathema Maranatha--these, in their turn were forced to submit to a close juxtaposition with the doubting, questioning speculations of the modern Teutonic theologues. The Revelations of Jacob Boehme, and the visions of Swedenborg seemed to be as much at home here as Papist, Calvinist, or inspired Heathen. It was quite impossible to gather from the Count's choice of books any satisfactory idea of his creed--one thing only was evident therein, and this was the fact that upon the mysterious questions of the soul's relations with God, he had studied and thought for himself. It was strange enough to behold assembled here such a Congress of all Saints, and as I mused upon their mutual differences, and excommunications, I imagined that the Count had spoken thus with himself:\n\n\"God hath sent them all into the world, why should I not receive them into my library? He hath seen them in his garden as so many various seeds of good and wisdom, why should I not gather the harvest they have borne? All of them that was not peace and love is dead, and the truth which they have illustrated and which still survives is one on earth as it is one in heaven.\"\n\nMethought too that these silent Saints had each a voice, and that each spake to me, and all invited me to come and dwell there, and be acquainted with them, and all promised me that I should find peace and comfort in so doing. The mystic said: \"I will teach thee how to believe--\" the reformer said: \"I will teach thee how to reason--\" the sublime heathen and the Godlike Nazarene said: \"I will teach thee to suffer, to love, and to forgive.\" And I replied to each and all of them: \"I will come.\"\n\nTowards the little chapel too, my heart felt a peculiar yearning. The white altar and the white cross that consecrated it were to me the emblems of a pure and simple faith, while the mysterious entablature on the wall appeared to me a monument of expiation. Was Angela a victim, and had the Count wept and mourned and agonized, even as others?\n\nI was aroused from my reverie by the voice of the Intendant, who warned me that it was growing late, and suggested that as there would be no moon, it would be wisest for us to make our way through the forest before night should be further advanced.\n\nIn reply, I communicated to him my desire of fixing my residence there for a time, and inquired of him the terms upon which I might hire the hermitage, for my own use and occupation.\n\n\"The hermitage cannot be hired\" answered my friend, \"but it is free to any one who will comply with the Count's terms as recorded on the wall before you.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he directed my attention to a wooden tablet fastened upon the wall. I looked, and read an inscription in Latin verse, which I have rendered thus:\n\n\"Who would inhabit this cell of mine,\n\n\"He must eat no flesh, he must drink no wine.\n\n\"No goodly garment his state shall shew,\n\n\"No steel his locks and his beard shall know.\n\n\"No menial here his hest shall wait,\n\n\"In his stall no steed, in his bed no mate.\n\n\"In holy study his days must pass,\n\n\"At the noon of night, he shall say his mass.\n\n\"To gold and blood he must bid farewell.\n\n\"Who liveth thus may keep my cell.\n\n\"In body and soul shall good betide him,\n\n\"And the angel of peace shall watch beside him.\"\n\n\"And is this intention carried out in the Count's will?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"I joyfully accept the terms, but how shall I first procure for myself the simplest food in this place?\"\n\n\"Bread and [pulce?] can be daily supplied you from the village. When you shall feel that you require more generous diet, it will be time for you to return to the world.\"\n\n\"Let me then enter into possession this very night\" I said. \"You can easily send my baggage from the Inn, with a provision of bread, a lamp, and some oil. I think that the dead branches in the wood will supply me with material for a fire.\"\n\nThe good Bourgeois expressed some surprize at my determination. Finding me inclined to persist in it, he kindly aided me to gather some branches, and to kindle a blaze on the long vacant hearth. Having thus imparted an air of some comfort to the somber apartment, and recommending me not to expose myself heedlessly to the damp night air, he took his leave. When he had left me, I drew my chair near to the hearth, and sat watching the fire, until its bright flame died away. As I looked listlessly into its embers, I reasoned thus with Life.\n\nEven thus did sorrow lead me from the world. Turning away in very heartsickness from the aims and pursuits of actual life, and shrinking painfully from the lonely and desolate future, I tried to fathom the problems of the world that lies beyond our sight, and to anticipate its revelations. Methought I held there an invaluable treasure, the inalienable sympathy of a devoted heart. Methought I had there an object of unceasing, of boundless interest, the destiny and happiness of her who had laid down her beautiful life, a willing sacrifice, at my feet. Thus she who would have led me into the inner sanctuary of earthly love, still held me in her power. Death had not relaxed, had but more firmly locked her hold upon me; and as the priestess of mysteries yet more divine, and as the Genius of love that could not die, she grew to me an object of mystic reverence and wonder, devoutly shrined in my inmost soul--revered and worshipped, perhaps, all the more for being no longer seen, for having never been possessed. Yet, as study succeeded to vague imagining, and reflection to emotion, my ideas of another life gradually lost somewhat of their personality. Truth soon became to me greater than hope or happiness, and in the pursuit of it I lost much of myself that I never found again.\n\nIt is a matter of no small interest to watch the origin and progress of religious faith in a world, a nation, or an individual--the conception of the mighty idea of immortality in the narrow breast of man--the pigmy, unequal to the subjugation of his toy-world, and yet claiming a share in infinite capacities, and endless existence--the child, trembling in the power of the elements and yet raising his rod of compulsion to draw down, harmlessly to himself, the fire of heaven. It is a history of various orphans, in which blind reverence and daring or sorrowing doubt succeed each other, till from the ruins of these is reared the structure of an earnest and reasonable belief, which neither doubt nor fear can destroy. Nor can this be easily obtained, without a severe struggle against our own cowardice, and against the despotism of other minds. The time for this struggle comes to all when belief is thoughtful, as well as sincere, but few meet it bravely--the most shrink terrified away, and after one look at the enemy, are well content to leave the field uncontested. Spiritual cowardice has ever been the virtue most extolled by the church. But what then? Shall Conscience be afraid, and Reason ashamed? Shall we dare to derive our creed from the teachings of one like ourselves? Shall we be satisfied to perceive the highest truth through the cloudy medium of other men's superstitions and prejudices? Ah! no one of the great processes of life can be performed by proxy. That soul only is alive in God which has had its own revelation from Him, upon which He has graven in the characters of its own experience, the law of Fear, the gospel of Love, the Apocalypse of infinite Hope that were appointed to it.\n\nSuch a revelation I sought in all my readings, in all my musings, in all my efforts of mind and of soul; for my studies were all thoughts, and my thoughts were all prayers, and my prayers, at first dim, chaotic, unutterable, gradually took to themselves form and distinctiveness and breathed themselves in such words as these:\n\n\"Oh God! grant me a new baptism,\n\nThe baptism of the new Jesus, of the living Jesus,\n\nOf the victor, not the victim.\n\nShew me the human rising to the divine,\n\nNot the divine vanquished, destroyed in becoming human.[A]\n\nIt is not my purpose to dwell in detail upon all that I learned, enjoyed and suffered during the period I am attempting to describe--neither can I give a definite idea of its length. It is marked in my remembrance by states, rather than by days; and its light and darkness were other than that of the evening and of the morning. A few words suffice for its history, because it is one for which we possess few words. It is not always easy to find fitting expression for matters which are open to the experience and comprehension of all men, but for those truths which then tasked my weak powers to the utmost, I feel that thought is inadequate to think them, and speech to utter them. The eternity which will make these Divine ideas clear to us, will give us also a Divine language in which to clothe them.\n\nThough I can neither comprehend nor explain the unseen influences to which I was, at this time, subjected, yet I can never disown or disclaim them. The whole state of painful blessedness has since then become as a dream to me, and I have by turns doubted the infallibility of many of the propositions which then seemed to be announced to me by such superhuman authority, while yet my whole life has been insensibly molded by them. Like all else to which man can attain, my religion was imperfect in theory, wild and exaggerated in practice. The temple of thoughts, deeds and aspirations which I raised to the unknown God was utterly defective, unsound, and tottering as a child's palace of cards, but the God has been there, and has overthrown the altar only that I might worship at a holier one.\n\nAgain, I dreamed in my frozen sleep. I thought that I stood alone, suspended between the elements. Above were the heavens, gorgeous as in the glory of sunset; beneath, and parted from me by the frailest bark, were the waters, wildly beautiful. But my eyes rested not upon them, for a mighty volume was spread open upon the clouds above me, and I read therein as it were the words of truth, illustrated by the visions of faith. My thoughts were rivetted upon the page, and I wished that I might read and read forever, so great was the delight of the wondrous and beautiful things that were written thereon. But even while I looked upon them, the book was gently closed before my eyes, and it was as though an angel received it up into heaven, for it was veiled from me not in darkness, but in light, which my sight could not endure. And as I stood in sorrow and in wonder, a voice spake to me from out the cloud, and said a little child shall lead thee. I looked down, and a beautiful child arose from the deep--its garments were dripping with colours, and the water that it shook from its locks glistened like golden rain. It took me by the hand and led me, even as Christ led Peter on the water. The waves changed to dry land and the ground grew form beneath my feet, and mine eyes beheld once more the beauty of the earth, as it is when the trees and shrubs are bearing their fullest and fairest.\n\nI awoke, but I could hardly believe myself awake. I was lying before the cross, upon the cold pavement of the chapel, but my head was supported by one who had raised it from the marble floor, while a sudden thrill of terror made me aware of the presence of a pair of stranger eyes, that looked intently into mine. Incapable of speech or motion, I silently returned their gaze until their gentleness had subdued my fear, and their beauty had sunk into my soul. That first look was not the last, but had it been, it would have contained in itself the germ of something not to be forgotten.\n\nThe eyes in question belonged to one whose sex disclosed itself in a form of perfect beauty. It was of youthful proportions, but its lightness and grace gave the promise of manly strength, even as the ingenuous features gave their earnest of steadfastness and truth of soul. The white forehead so serene and unmarked seemed to defy life to put any save her noblest stamp upon it. The hair was of dark hue and strong growth, and the mouth, crowned with its nascent line of black, seemed as yet to have drunk only at the cup of innocent enjoyment--but the eyes of deepest, mournfullest blue were the glory of the face. Oh! if truth, if love, if soul have a colour, it can be none other than the blue of those mysterious eyes.\n\nThe boy (he could scarce have outnumbered sixteen summers) still watched in my countenance the fluctuations of returning life--he held my frozen hands in his, and warmed and chafed them until I had recovered strength enough to withdraw them from his hold--this done, I made a feeble effort to raise my head from his knees, and aided by him, sat upright on the ground, looking at him and at all things as through a mist.\n\nAt length returned to me the power of speech, but scarcely that of thought. My brain still wavered between its symbolic visions and the sights and sounds of earth, and my first words were:\n\n\"Art thou human?\"\n\n\"If you could see yourself,\" replied the boy \"you would think that I might far better ask the question of you.\"\n\n\"I found you here\" he continued \"quite alone, stretched on the floor, stiff and cold as the marble itself. At first I was terrified, and would have called for help, for I thought you dead. I looked in your face, and could not leave you. I felt of your heart and found that it had still a little motion; then I knelt down by you, and tried to recall you to life.\"\n\n\"I wished to die when I lay down here, yet I thank you.\"\n\n\"But come, you must not remain any longer in this icy vault, let me lead you into the outer room--the fire there has died out from the hearth long ago, but I can try to kindle it again.\" And leaning on him, I left the haunted chapel for the study. My guide gathered upon the hearth some fragments of decayed pine, and struck a light from his flint and steel, but I impatiently interrupted his labours.\n\n\"Not here, not here!\" I cried, for the air of the place was grown baneful to me, and I longed to escape from it as from a tomb; Anot here--nothing can live, or breathe, or burn in this dwelling. Do you not see that the quiet which prevails here is the repose of death? Do you not see that I have been living with the dead until I am almost become one of them? Let me go forth into the living world once more--let me hear once more the voices of living men.\"\n\n\"Come home with me then--my father will gladly receive you as his guest, and all our household will wait upon you--come with me, Madam.\"\n\n\"Madam?\" cried I, starting back, \"do you take me for a woman?\"\n\nThe boy replied not, but led me to a mirror that hung upon the wall. I was terrified at my own appearance. It was not the long hair, nor the deathlike countenance, nor the wild, haggard eyes that startled me, it was that in my long robe de chambre, and with the wild profusion of my locks, I looked a woman.\n\nI turned to him and spoke. \"I am weak as a child, and as you have well said, I look like nothing human, but I swear to you that I am no woman--can you help me to cut off my hair?\"\n\n\"Do not, do not cut it off!\" exclaimed the boy, \"it is the most beautiful hair that I ever saw. I can aid you in concealing it, but I will not suffer you to cut it off.\"\n\nHalf pleased, half vexed, I allowed him to gather my hair in a sort of knot, and to conceal it beneath the collar of my robe de chambre. He next bethought him of my clothes, and charged himself with the valise which contained my sometime wardrobe. Thus equipped, we set forth together, at the quickest pace compatible with my state of weakness. Phantom voices seemed to ring around me as I crossed the threshold, and the clang of the ponderous door as it closed upon us had for me something supernatural in it. I breathed more freely when we had passed the outer enclosure, and clung to my young guide, feeling that he had rescued me from deadly peril.\n\nHow changed was the world without! how little had I heeded or recked of the change! The green leaves of summer had changed, and withered, had fallen and been swept away, the diamond snow fruit hung in their place. Like to a festal carpet, the green covering of the lawn had been drawn away, and in its place appeared the icy pavement of winter. As I looked mournfully upon the frozen earth, there struck me a thought more sharp and bitter than the frost itself.\n\nThis was the first snow that had fallen upon Emma's grave. But I smiled as the dreadful remembrance smote me. I made it welcome to my heart--horrors were at home there. The boy saw the smile, and shuddered. \"If you look so, you will make me mad,\" he said.\n\n\"Pardon me; I will do so no more.\"\n\nAs I walked on, I trembled before the physical discomfort of life, even as I had once shrunk from its spiritual burthens. The keen air that called up the blood to the fresh cheek beside mine, struck to my heart the deadliest chill. His elastic step scarce broke the crust of the snow, while my heavy feet sank continually below the glittering surface, and soon grew wet and benumbed. Fitfully there came to us a cold wind from the North, that visited every part of my feeble body, like a cunning champion whose lance seeks every where to pierce the weak joints of his adversary's armour. No combatant was I, but a willing victim. There was no strength in me to oppose to the pitiless force of nature, and soon, yielding to utter discouragement, I sank upon the ground, and prayed that I might be left there.\n\n\"Come on, come on--it is madness to delay here.\"\n\n\"No, no. I am struck with a mortal disease. Death has long been busy with my heart, I will struggle with him no longer. I could not die in that fearful place, where every thing was already dead; but here in the free air, I can lie down on this pure winding sheet of snow, and depart in peace.\"\n\nTears stood in the gentle eyes of the youth, as he persuaded me to rise and resume my journey.\n\n\"Do not, do not talk so;\" he said, \"you are too ill to reach my father's house today, but you cannot think that I will leave you here to perish. There is help nearer at hand than the castle--we are not far from the dwelling of Lischen, my old nurse, who lives hard upon the skirts of the wood. She will tend you like a mother until you shall be able to set forth again, and then I will bring the carriage for you.\"\n\n\"No woman shall tend me\" said I eagerly: \"I cannot suffer the presence of a woman.\"\n\n\"But Lischen is an angel of kindness.\"\n\n\"I will rather die here, than look upon a woman.\"\n\n\"What a strange fancy! I have then but one other resource. Yon little path on the left leads to a sort of hut, inhabited by one of my father's huntsmen. It is but a rude place, and he is a rough man for one so delicate as you, but if you will, we can but try his entertainment, such as it is.\"\n\nSilently assenting to his proposition, I rose once more to my feet, and essayed to follow the gentle guidance of my companion. It was not long before we reached a narrow path, half dug, half trodden in the snow--my progress now became less difficult. We were soon in sight of the little hut, a few moments more of pain and weariness, and we stood before the door.\n\n\"Who waits without there?\" cried a sturdy voice from within, in reply to a rigorous knock.\n\n\"One who needs your aid, good Rudolf. Come, stir yourself, be quick, unbolt, unbar.\"\n\n\"Can it be you, Master Ronald?\" exclaimed the huntsman, as he threw back the rude door.\n\n\"Yes, good friend, and I bring with me a sick stranger whom I found lost in the wood. Provide for us straitway fire, and food, and wine. He is faint with hunger and half dead with cold.[\"]\n\n\"That is a very excellent Scripture,\" gravely remarked the hunstman, who at the mention of the sweet singer of Israel had reverentially uncovered his head. \"I wonder I never heard it before, but I am sure that it was said by some wise man and not by the rascal who came home from hunting, and took bean-porridge for his breakfast.\"\n\n\"What food is that which you are preparing over the fire?\"\n\n\"Tea, blue groats (blaue grötze), a slice of toast, cursed stuff indeed.\" answered Rudolf, with a distasteful smirk.\n\n\"Yes indeed, let us give it to the dogs. But what have you got in the cupboard for your own breakfast, lovely Rudolf?\"\n\n\"Let me see--there is a good bit of venison, cold boar's ham, black bread, and Universal Consolation.\"\n\n\"The last, I suppose, is derived from your grandmother's Bible.\"\n\n\"From my grandfather's hunting flask, you mean.\" glibly returned the forester, holding up to view the article in question, from which his reverence for his grandfather's memory barely allowed him to separate himself.\n\n\"Well, I shall breakfast with you this morning.\"\n\nRudolf speedily arranged the meal upon his coarse wooden table, and for the first time in many months, I sat at meat with a being of my own kind. We fell to with a good grace. I was half famished by my unwonted exertions, and if I had ever before feasted on more sumptuous viands, the fact did not at that moment suggest itself to my remembrance. Rudolf eyed me with a sort of savage glee, and encouraged me both by precept and example to make a blessed repast. It would hardly have been for the advantage of his larder that I should have made many such.\n\nThe day passed after quite a new fashion. I wandered forth again and occupied myself by gathering mosses which here and there pushed up from beneath the melting snow. I gathered up in my mind some fragments of botanical knowledge, as one may gather from a tomb the scattered bones of a friend. \"Is it possible\" I asked myself, \"that there was ever a time in which I knew anything that it was not sorrow to know? [T]his lesson of anguish has lasted so long that I have forgot all else--but now I remember my poor professor of Physical Science, that rusty high priest of nature--I remember his well-marshalled army of suns and stars, of laws and affinities, of elemental substances, primitive forces, e tutti quanti. I can remember how my head has ached with the jangle of his learned words and how my limited powers of memory have endeavoured to accommodate themselves to the length of his endless sentences--how difficult it was to know at once what he was saying, and what he was talking about, and how often I deemed it a pity, even a cruelty that God had made the world as it was, if I must needs understand it. I meditated upon these things, they gradually rose up before me clothed in a majesty, and invested with an unity which in earlier days, had never been revealed to me. Seen as a multitude of disconnected facts, they had confused and frightened me. But as they now appeared to me, the various members of one great body of truth, I saw their grandeur, their harmony, and thought it quite time that I should renew my acquaintance with them. Thus is it ever. The child must dissect, the man is able to combine--analysis is the task of the first, synthesis that of the second--the one stimulates to unrest, the other elevates to peace--the one is the legitimate gratification of the child's destructiveness, the other is the exercise of the Creative principle which constitutes one of the strongest sympathies between the narrow mind of man and the infinite mind from which it emanates.\n\nAs for the first time, I was able to reason upon those days gone by. I marvelled that the thoughts which had filled them now seemed to me crude and childish, while the emotions that animated them were still too mighty, too terrible for me to look back upon. How was it that when I had understood and reasoned as a child, I had felt as a man? Why was it that long ere experience had taught me to rein in the fiery steed, he had been loosed from his stall, and sent flinging madly about at wildest random, as if commissioned only to fling his rider to destruction?\n\nOh feeble child, sent weeping to the great school of this world, learn there thy lesson even as thou mayst. To learn it diligently, to get it by heart is thy business. For the modus-in-quo, thank God, thou will not be held responsible.\n\nWearied with my morning ramble, I returned to the Lodge, and threw myself upon the rude settle that always stood before the fire.\n\n\"Shall I bring you some of your books?\" said Rudolf, \"the young Baron sent them here, long since, but you have not even unpacked them.\"\n\n\"Not those books!\" said I, with an involuntary shudder. \"Have you nothing of your own that one might read?\"\n\nHaving retired to make the speediest toilette possible I opened with a hasty hand the valise which contained my vestments of former days. Alas, its glory was departed, the moth and the rust had corrupted it. Equivocal insects came flying out upon me as I lifted the dusty lid, and seemed in their angry agitation to expostulate with me after this fashion: \"you have been dead these six months, and have bequeathed to us the legacy of your broad-cloth; it is an unheard of act of impudence in you to arise from your grave and molest us in the possession of your property.\" Moreover, nothing seemed to fit me as of old--my form had both shrunk and expanded, and as I submitted myself once more to the tyranny of coat, vest, and breeches, I breathed a last sigh over the worn out relics of my poor old dressing gown. With a little patience, however, I contrived to equip myself decently, and after an affectionate farewell to Rudolf and the dogs, I started under Ronald=s guidance for the castle. We had crossed the threshold when Ronald, in boyish fashion, seized a stone of some size, and hurled it at a rude target that stood near the house. I took up one of a double size, and hurled it to a double distance. \"That's no woman's throw,\" I said, and Ronald could not contradict me.\n\nAs we walked side by side through the wood-path, Ronald endeavoured to prepare me, in some degree, for the new surroundings in which I was about to find myself. I gathered from his words the following facts. His father was a nobleman, and the proprietor of large landed estates in the neighbourhood--he was moreover a man of genial and liberal nature, delighting in the society of intelligent men and in the exercise of hospitality. He had long known of my residence in the neighbourhood, and his curiosity had been much excited by various reports of my eccentric mode of life. The peasants had spoken of me with a sort of superstitious reverence, first as a sorcerer, then as a saint, or at least as one holy, harmless and incomprehensible. The castle was, at this time, filled with guests, and among more worthy themes of conversation, my character and habits had been made a subject of discussion. That very morning at breakfast, it had been proposed to invite me to take up my abode among them for a short time, and those present had playfully defied each other to bear me the invitation, and to induce me to accept it. The youngest and bravest had accepted the challenge, and was not a little proud and happy in his success.\n\nThe castle was old and grim enough to be altogether to my taste--it was beautifully placed on a slight eminence, and commanded an extensive prospect. The eccentric outline of its exterior suggested the idea of tortuous passages, winding stairs, and turret chambers in which an owl like myself might safely take shelter, and build himself, with books and parchments, a most congenial nest. Yet as I paused on the terrace to survey all the beauty that lay spread at my feet, it occurred to me that I had played the owl quite long enough, and that my wits might be somewhat sharpened by a little communion with living things and living men. But the wide portal opened to admit us, and I followed Ronald to the dining-hall, where the guests were all assembled. As we approached, we heard the sounds of conversation and laughter--as we entered, several voices cried out: \"here is Ronald\"--they were obviously not prepared for the apparition that followed, and all eyes were turned upon me as upon something new and strange. Anxious to prevent the utterance ofany word or jest which might greet me unpleasantly, Ronald led me at once to the master of the house, who sat in a capacious armchair at the head of a long table covered with wine, fruits, and confections, and surrounded by a sufficiently numerous party. He was a man of noble appearance,in the very prime of life, and clothed with a dignity far beyond that of rank or wealth.\n\n\"Father, I bring you the stranger,\" said Ronald and the stately Count arose to receive me.\n\n\"You are welcome,\" he said in the friendliest manner \"we have long desired to see you--pardon me if, by way of introductions to the company, I ask how we may name you, and whence you come.\"\n\n\"That I come from the Hermitage in the wood is well known to you\" I made answer; \"but since I have surrendered myself prisoner at your summons, you must remember that I am not bound to make any disclosures on my own part until I have been informed wherefore and by whom I have been summoned hither.\"\n\nInstantly every one present, including the host, gave me in a loud voice his name, rank and place of abode.\n\n\"And we have sent for you,\" said they \"to laugh with us, and to drink with us and to be one of us.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" I replied \"I am gratified by your frankness, and entirely satisfied with the statements you have made--permit me in return to say that my name, at your service, is Laurence, my nature, masculine, my habits anti-gregarious, my tastes anti-bibulous. I am your servant for all good and pleasure.\"\n\nIt is ever a questionable thing, the introduction of a new unknown element into a social compound already in a high state of fermentation. Who does not know that the admixture of one ungenial drop may reduce the whole distillation to flatness and acidity? A dinner as well as a kingdom, has its destiny to the which sudden revolutions are, for the most part, fatal. Let us suppose then that you have composed your dinner after the best receipt with sufficient preponderance of wit and sentiment, benevolence tempered by a slight infusion of malice, not forgetting a grand pièce de resistance of learning and obstinacy; which latter, attacked by each in turn, proves itself too much for demolition and promises to be good, cold, another day. Let us suppose all this, and who does not perceive the madness of risking the happy eventuation of the whole by intermingling with it an ingredient which has neither been tried by your self, nor recommended by others?\n\nIn the present instance, however, I cannot say that the experiment was unsuccessful. It was a company of genial men, into the midst of which I had fallen, like a man from the moon, or the stony corpse of a meteor. I found myself surrounded by an atmosphere of learning and intelligence, and I had scarce seated myself at the table before the thread of the discourse broken by my arrival was cunningly mended, and I found myself called upon to join in the discussion of questions of high and noble interest. At first, I sat among them cold and impassive--soon, I found my attention rivetted upon that which I heard--at length, my very tongue untied itself--I too entered the lists, and defended with warmth and courage the truth that was truth to me. My words were received with attention, and skilfully answered--then, the conversation assumed a lighter and merrier character--stories were told, keen jests and graceful personalities were allowed to relieve the fatigue of graver arguments--then we left the table, and the party was some what broken up. While others sought diversion in whist, billiards, books, or conversation, I ran out upon the lawn with Ronald. Finding him quite wearied with the themes of the dinner table, I made for him a caricature of the whole conversation. I imitated by turns the poet, the antiquarian, and the theologian, until the youth lay upon the ground in fits of inextinguishable laughter. I ran with him, wrestled with him, sang, swore, and shouted, until our insane gaiety had exhausted itself, and we bade each other a cordial and unwilling goodnight. Ronald left me at the door of my room; it was the very turret chamber I had coveted, and beautifully from its window showed the moonlit park, the river and the outline of distant hills. Yet, as I looked out upon it all, a strange pang shot through my heart, and I asked of God why the angel with the bright wings came down to me no more from the moon, and why the brightest star sent not, as formerly, its pencil of rays to my soul, and why the fair woman in white arose no more from her bier before the altar in that old church, nor came as she was wont to clasp me in her gentle arms, and to print upon my forehead her kiss of heavenly forgiveness. As I mused thus, and sought more fondly for my sacred sorrow than I had ever sought for its consolations, I heard an unwonted voice in the corridor beyond. They were carrying the poet, incapable of independent locomotion, to his sleeping-chamber. He was sublimely drunk, and loudly declaimed various verses, among which I could distinguish this line:\n\n\"Let the dead past bury its dead.\"\n\nAGod, does the past die?\" I cried out to heaven; \"if aught that bears the stamp of thy truth and our love can die, what immortality have we?\"\n\nChapter\n\nLet not the reader imagine that I had more sympathy with the condition than with the sentiment of the poet. I was, as I have said, anti-bibulous by inclination, if not by necessity. It had needed little experience to teach me that in my best days, any extraneous stimulus would hasten to madness the swift current of my blood. It is the cold and dull of temperament who need the genial flow of wine. For them it may quicken the fancy, warm the heart, and give to the sluggish brain the impulse of a more living life than that which tinges all their days with its somber monotony. Some men grow wise, and witty, and even generous in their wine, who without it are ever crabbed, sordid, stupid. For such, the dancing devil of the grape juice is a friendly genius, almost a ministering angel, while to finer, quicker natures, it becomes the most cruel and brutal of the tyrants.\n\nI too had ever my seasons of dullness and depression, and as I have grown older, the slow torture of my torpid state has become a greater bugbear to me than were the acute suffering of my earlier life. But I have learned the nature of these slumbers of the soul, have learned to bear them patiently, and to beguile them by the exercise of the more mechanical powers of mind, memory, comparison, perception and imitation, while waiting for the divine voice to awake me to higher and nobler musings.\n\nI have become convinced that to all the innumerable subdivisions of the human race, there are two which may yet be added. Among thinking men at least I have observed two very distinct classes--those belonging to the first are ever awakened, ever capable of thought and action; they ever possess themselves, and there will never appear any wide discrepancy between that they were yesterday and that which they will be tomorrow. In those who constitute the second class, the brain is capable only of a spasmodic action, and presents alternately the phenomena of an intense and concentrated activity, and of entire inertia. The intellectual life of the latter is marked by a series of crises, more or less remote, and ever followed by an interval of exhaustion and repose without which Nature could scarce resist the too lavish expenditure of her forces, or prepare herself for renewed exertion and fruition. I had just passed through one of these crises (and its somnabulic influences still lingered around me), veiling from me in part the reality of the external world, while the mystic visions of my introverted life still presented themselves, unbidden, before me, and seemed in their eternal truth to mock at men as phantoms, and to deride their aims and desires as dreams worthy only of children. Still, while regretting these hours of rapture and of inspiration, I knew that it was well for me that the spell was broken. Death, madness, or a return to the common life of humanity had been the only alternatives presented to me. I had not deliberately chosen the latter, but Heaven had kindly chosen for me and had sent the gentle Ronald to form a kind of rainbow bridge between my terrible ghostland and the fair earth which I am still content to inhabit.\n\nTo that earth I now returned with a terrible & exaggerated fondness. As wildly my imagination had spread its wings and soared in pursuit of the highest Ideal, so now I stretched out my hands to grasp the real, the tangible, the mathematically demonstrable. As boldly as I had ventured into the deepest mazes of speculation, hoping to conquer there the unconquerable truth, so now was I content to tread the beaten track of other men, and to deem myself rich in the inheritance of their discoveries. The question had hitherto been with me: \"is it possible?\" I now asked: \"is it certain?\" I had clung savagely to my solitary life--I was glad now of the sympathy and companionship of one younger and feebler than myself; and the words of my dream were soon fulfilled, that a little child should lead me.\n\nMy reader may be surprized that I speak of Ronald as of a child, while yet I have said that my years scarce exceeded his by half a lustre. Still, the distance which experience had placed between us seemed to me more than that of many years. The precocity of my temperament and the strange sorrows of my early life had too soon awakened in me those dangerous powers which in Ronald's heart still slept the innocent sleep of childhood. This very ignorance and unconsciousness of his made him but the more beautiful to me. I rejoiced to think that his reason would be nobly developed ere his passions were aroused; that it would be granted him to learn the shoals and the harbours, the true aims and ends of life before he was launched on its rude and stormy waters. In this hope, I watched over myself with jealous care, that no fervid breath from my own soul should invite the budding sympathies of his to unfold themselves before their time.\n\nRonald became very dear to me, dear rather as himself than as a part of myself. It was not difficult for me to understand and minister to the necessities of his nature. Without knowing, without understanding, the boy had soon more than repaid the debt. He attached himself to me with almost feminine fondness, and his presence chased the phantoms from my brain, even as a nursling will often draw away the poison from the sick heart of its mother. His age was not so much removed from mine but that its wants and perplexities were still fresh in my remembrance, and claimed my fullest sympathy. I endeavoured to give him the clue to labyrinths in which I myself had sometimes lost sight of hope and patience, and to resolve for him those weary questions of the days of elementary study: \"why should I learn it? what is it good for? what shall I do with it when I have learned it?\"\n\nI have said that, at this moment, the remembrance of my recent experience of exaggerated spiritualism had given my mind a strong impulse towards the real and positive. I still sought for God every where and in all things, but methought I would now learn of Him in the records of the world He had made. I was fain to lose sight of my own soul, with its narrow powers and destinies, and to think of the Infinite in His relations with the Universe. It was time that I should give myself up to the teachings, of Nature, to the study of its old testament, graven on tables of stone, and its ever new testament of organic life, springing from the dead past, and bearing the living future in its bosom. It was time that I should better understand this gospel of hope and beauty and renewed life which is preached every spring in the dull ear of the sleeping earth, and which, by the Autumn, has revolutionized the world.\n\nRonald was as yet incapable of comprehending the true aim of these studies, but he was easily led to participate in them. He gladly became the companion of my geological and botanical excursions, and with evident benefit to himself. The exposure and fatigue attendant upon our wanderings supplied the necessary vent to the restless activity of his age, while our researches, such as they were, gave the happiest direction to those powers of perception and observation which are so clamorous for exercise in the earlier periods of life, and which suppressed or misdirected, are sources of evil and discomfort.\n\nRonald's father, whom I shall call Raimond, interfered little in my intercourse with his son neither to stimulate or restrain. It was nevertheless easy for me to see that he watched with interest and satisfaction the new interests which had now interwoven themselves in Ronald's life. To me, he was the kindest of hosts--he treated me less as a stranger than as one long known and esteemed. He placed at my disposal all the resources of his generous establishment, of which however, I availed myself of three only, the library, Ronald, and my own little turret chamber which had been transformed into the most charming of dens. If I ever spoke of my departure, he answered: \"you are very well here, young gentleman.\"\n\nBut all were not as indulgent to me as the good Raimond. The poet, the antiquarian and the theologian had hither been the pedagogues of the young Baron, and had been jointly entrusted with the care of his education. They had failed to excite in him any love for the studies over which they presided, and their teachings, as well as themselves, were utterly tedious to him. They soon saw in me a dangerous rival, nor was it long before they had formed themselves into a league, offensive and defensive, against me, their animosity being all the more bitter because I had carefully avoided giving them any excuse for it. As it was, Ronald passed the first half of every morning under their jurisdiction--these weary hours once over, he bounded from them like a hound let loose, and led me forth to the woods and hills of the neighbourhood. Here we gathered plants, and dissected them; we searched for stones, and classified them; we plaited garlands, we sang, we improvised dramas--we were the gayest of all the children of the Spring. Then, at table, I would argue against the three pedants, to his great delight. I answered the poet's verses by verses of my own, and puzzled the theologian by arguments more subtle, though less learned than his own.\n\nOne eccentricity of mine sometimes troubled Ronald--one morbid impression still retained its dimension over me. I could not bear the sight of a woman. Fortunately the lord of the Manor was himself no woman-fancier, and within his walls, the fair sex had no representative, save in a menial capacity. The presence even of the maid occasioned in me that feeling of faintness and malaise which is felt by some individuals at the approach of a cat. Ronald had observed this, and had taken pains to guard against the recurrence of the evil. The women of the household were refused all access to my room, and one of the valets was induced to take charge of it. If in the course of our wanderings, I descried at a distance the outlines of a female form, I instinctively turned my steps in an opposite direction. Ronald soon learned to avoid them even as I did, a course of conduct which did not find any great favour in the eyes of the village belles, to whom the fair youth, with his graces and his expectations was not altogether unattractive. It was a pleasure to me, in all else, to show myself gentle and tractable with Ronald, and to obey his innocent caprices as if he had been the stronger, and I the weaker of the twain. I had resources for all his leisure hours, and consolations for all his discontents, only when he would have kissed me, I shrank from him with a horror quite incomprehensible to myself and to him.\n\nYet while it was a delight to me to yield to the gentle magnetism of his will, I was glad to find on the other hand that my mind had acquired over his a certain ascendancy. I had taught him to reason, while he had taught me to hope and to enjoy. I soon felt that he had grown, had put on strength, had learned in some measure to read the meaning of earthly things, to comprehend their uses, to feel their beauty. Encouraged by me, he had caught glimpses of a land of promise beyond the driest of his studies. I had taught him to believe that from the dull chrysalid of science would come forth the lovely spirit of art, with her troop of butterflies. From childish love to manly knowledge, from manly knowledge to illuminated love, this was my idea of mental progress, and I hoped to have the happiness to see it realized in Ronald.\n\nI learned at a later day that I had not understood all that was passing at this period in the mind of my pupil. Some seeds were ripening there which I had never desired to sow, and Nature was slowly arousing in his breast some impulses with which I could not sympathize.\n\nOne day when he was lying at my feet on the mountain side, he said to me: \"does not your brain grow weary of thinking in these long pauses, when you are still and silent, and neither hear nor see me?\"\n\n\"One must have many thoughts before one learns to think.\"\n\n\"And what is the use of so many thoughts, is it not enough for us to live?\"\n\n\"We must know how and for what we live.\"\n\n\"Oh\" said Ronald \"I understand that full well. I know that I live because I love you, and I live to love you.\"\n\nThese words, and the tone in which they were uttered, struck a sudden pang to my heart. I changed colour, and Ronald's eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"You do not wish me to love you, Laurence, and yet you have changed my whole heart to love for you--you seem at once to hold me fast and to spurn me.\"\n\n\"Ronald, do you know that we have been out all this morning, without having found one new mineral? take up the basket, and give me the hammer, we have played, now we must work.\"\n\nHe stood before me for a moment in most expressive silence, and fixed his eyes upon mine.\n\n\"Already?\" said he, and his look told the rest.\n\n\"To work already? must I begin the task of life so early? Are there not scores of years for labour, and do you scourge me to it in the first hour of the morning?\"\n\nThere is little to be said of the time that I passed with Ronald at the University, save that it glided by, for the most part, tranquilly and happily enough. Ronald sustained with honour the ordeal of his preparatory examination, and entered upon his course under the most favorable auspices. Once admitted into his class, he was of necessity enrolled among the members of the various students' societies, and the companionship of these young men, and such friendship as they had to give, were entirely at his service. I cannot say that he was in any haste to avail himself of the priviledges [sic] that extended to him--the wild, shaggy foxes of H. possessed few attractions for him, and there were few points of sympathy between their rude and boisterous manière d'être, and his own refined and thoughtful nature. Drinking, gaming, and fighting were as uncongenial to him as to myself; and these were the only amusements which beguiled the elegant leisure of those gentle beings. Still, it was my wish that Ronald should mingle with them. I sometimes thought that their follies, their passions, their very vices might in the end be less dangerous to him than those too grave and mystic habits of thought which had so grown upon me, and which I feared to communicate to him. Far from fostering the reserve of his character, I availed myself of every possible argument to induce him to make some more intimate acquaintance with the strange world by which he was surrounded. I descanted to him upon the advantages of studying men of all characters, habits, and dispositions, and even exaggerated to him the importance of the knowledge he would thus acquire. But Ronald's soul was yet enwrapped in its virgin garments of purity and tenderness, and he clung to me, like a child to its mother.\n\n\"What would you have me do among those savages, Laurence? What can they teach me that were not better unlearned? I have no vacant time, no idle thoughts to bestow upon them. Here I have you to talk with, I have my notes of today to copy, my lessons of tomorrow to prepare. If we get through in time, we can take a moonlight walk among the ruins of the old castle--you will sling the guitar over your shoulder, and we will make music as we walk, even as we were wont to do at home.\"\n\n\"But Ronald, you might as well have staid at home, if you intend to shut yourself up with me for your only companion.\"\n\n\"I could have been well-content to have staid there alone, alone with you forever,\" answered Ronald with fervour. In spite of my attempts to wean him from his too exclusive dependence upon me, I could not but be glad to retain in some degree, the guidance of his immature youth. I rejoiced in the persuasion that the destiny of this beautiful being would be all purity and love, all marked by high impulse, and earnest thought. \"He need not fall,\" I said to myself, \"he need not sin and repent. God has given his angels charge over him, he will live but to bless and be blest.\"\n\nAs a natural consequence of our quiet and studious mode of life, we became daily more popular with the professors and more odious to the students. They made us the subject of impertinent songs and epigrams, they invented a thousand petty insults for our daily annoyance--finally, they became such a trouble and vexation to us, that I thought it best to absent myself for a time, and to try whether Ronald, once left alone with his classmates, might not be led to cultivate more friendly relations with them. I became distrustful "
