        "text": "Biblical Aromatherapy\n\nby Robert Bike\n\nThe Bible mentions about 232 plants by name, or closely enough to figure out what plant is meant. Of these, 24 are aromatic plants; that is, parts of the plants can be pressed or distilled to get an essential oil. Essential oils are the lifeblood of plants and have tremendous healing capabilities.\n\nThe healing power of plants is the basis for modern medicines.\n\nBiblical Aromatherapy discusses how the plants were used in biblical days and how you can use the essential oils from biblical plants.\n\nOriginally published in manuscript form in 1999, I completely revised the book and added illustrations.\n\nTo order Biblical Aromatherapy in paperback,\n\nClick here.\n\nList price $24.99; introductory offer $19.99\n\nTo order the pdf version and download to your computer or phone,\n\nClick here."
