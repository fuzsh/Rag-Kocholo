        "text": "This historical work builds upon (with specific critiques) the emerging field of the study of global health which has begun to more broadly define its central term to include various intellectual traditions in medicine and development, private and philanthropic interests, and transnational health movements. There have been explorations of the socio-economic approaches to the health of specific populations, the solutions to technical problems and globalised health security threats, the role of international legal systems in health, goals for both communicable and non-communicable diseases, and the metaphors, visions, and cultural norms of universal and collective action in health improvement. These studies have brought out the tensions in global health between differing national health systems and contexts, between varying experiences and priorities for health, and between rival meanings and performances of ‘health’ as well as its social determinants. Structural issues, such as the flow of financial resources from the so-called Global North to the Global South, inequalities in knowledge production, and clashes over the power of the pharmaceutical industry have also been brought to the fore. Finally, global health has been distinguished as having a concern for health equity over help or aid, multi-disciplinarity beyond the health sciences, and the health needs of the whole planet rather than the control of diseases and sanitation across borders alone; Jeffrey P. Koplan et al., ‘Towards a Common Definition of Global Health’, The Lancet 373, no. 9679 (June 2009): 1993–5 [PMC free article: PMC9905260] [PubMed: 19493564].\n\nThey define ‘international health’ as referring to the control of epidemics through public health policy that extended across national boundaries, such as in the International Sanitary Conferences between 1841 and 1938. By contrast, in their definition, ‘global health’ is different in approach and scale. Global health ‘in general implies the consideration of the health needs of the people of the whole planet as an agenda above the concerns of particular nations’. This definition accommodates the growing significance of non-state actors, though they note that there were times when ‘global health’ visions existed in who and US policy well before the proliferation of ngos in the 1990s. While their understanding of this distinction is nuanced, their frequent focus on the who and its archives restricts the possible periodisations of global health; Theodore M. Brown, Marcos Cueto, and Elizbeth Fee, ‘The World Health Organization and the Transition from ‘International’ to ‘Global’ Health’, in Medicine at the Border: Disease, Globalization and Security, 1850 to the Present, ed. Alison Bashford (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006), 76–7; Theodore M. Brown, Marcos Cueto, and Elizabeth Fee, ‘The World Health Organization and the Transition from “International Health” to “Global” Public Health’, American Journal of Public Health 96, no. 1 (January 2006): 62–72 [PMC free article: PMC1470434] [PubMed: 16322464].\n\nAnother notable example is the Nigerian psychiatrist T.A. Lambo, who was both who assistant director-general and a key part of the formation of the World Council of Churches’ Christian Medical Commission; see James C. McGilvray to Thomas Adeoye Lambo, ‘Consultation on the Subject of Health and Salvation’ (12 July 1966), 4215.0.3 World Council of Churches: Christian Medical Commission, History of the cmc 1-9, wcc Archives (Geneva, Switzerland); ‘3. T. Adioya Lambo: Traditional Healing and Scientific Medicine: Some General Problems of Adjustment’, Master File of Material for Consultation on Health and Salvation’ (Tübingen, 1967), 4215.0.3 World Council of Churches: Christian Medical Commission, History of the cmc 1-9, wcc Archives (Geneva, Switzerland). For more on West African leadership in health and international organisations, see Adell Patton Jr, Physicians, Colonial Racism and Diaspora in West Africa (Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 1996); Matthew M. Heaton, Black Skin, White Coats: Nigerian Psychiatrists, Decolonization and the Globalization of Psychiatry (Athens: Ohio University Press, 2013) [PubMed: 27454564]; for Ghanaian agency as patients and assistants, see Jean Allman and Victoria Tashjian, “I Will Not Eat Stone”: A Women’s History of Colonial Asante (Portsmouth, nh: Heinemann, 2000).\n\nGenerally, the material focus of the early missions in the Gold Coast was on conversion, primary education, and basic industries, especially cocoa production. The first mission doctor, C.F. Heinze of the Basel Mission, died six weeks after his arrival in 1832. This untimely demise discouraged any further discussions of a professional medical mission presence until 1865 when a Gold Coast government medical officer pushed the missions to provide their own doctor, having spent a lot of his time keeping missionaries healthy. After the 1882 health survey of the Gold Coast by the Basel Mission, Dr Rudolf Fisch was posted to Aburi on the Gold Coast in 1885 and Dr Alfred Eckhardt was posted to Christiansborg in 1887. With Eckhardt and his nurse dying within four years, Fisch was left responsible for all missionary health and the fledgling outpatient clinics for locals at Aburi and Abokobi.\n\nIn contrast to many African colonies where medical mission was the vanguard of health, in the Gold Coast the colonial state began medical work first and missionary medicine was informal. Beginning with the Bowdich missions to Ashanti in 1817 and again during the war with the Ashanti in 1863 and 1864, the British colonial government had a medical presence on the Gold Coast. However, until the formal establishment of the colony in 1874 this was minimal, mostly for the military, and entirely for Europeans. In 1878 the first civil colonial hospital was founded and more followed by 1880. Moreover, between the 1890s and the early 1900s, the British population tripled. In the 1890s there was some concern to improve sanitation in the towns, with Governor Griffith proposing raising duties in 1891, but these efforts did not flourish until 1908–12 when the West African Medical Service (wams) began a concerted effort to create indigenous medical and sanitary services. From 1912, Governor Hugh Clifford had aimed to extend the medical services to the local populations beyond administrative stations, and in 1916 he sent his criticism of the exclusion from basic medicine of tax-paying Africans to the secretary of state for the Colonies; see Stephen Addae, Medical Histories Volume I: From Primitive to Modern Medicine (1850–2000), 12–19, 23–4, and 29–33; Noel Smith, The Presbyterian Church of Ghana, 1835–1960: A Younger Church in a Changing Society (Accra: Ghana Universities Press, 1966), 183–9; Clare Pettitt, Dr. Livingstone, I Presume? Missionaries, Journalists, Explorers and Empire (London: Profile Books, 2007). See also Christoffer H. Grundmann, ‘Mission and Healing in Historical Perspective’, International Bulletin of Missionary Research 32, no. 4 (October 2008): 185–8, and the introduction to the key volume, which provides important regional studies but which does not extend far into the postcolonial world, David Hardiman, Healing Bodies, Saving Souls: Medical Missions in Asia and Africa (Amsterdam and New York: Rodopi, 2006) [PubMed: 17132180].\n\nThis was both a result of the increased cost of commodities and increased quantities – for example, in 1920 the value of cotton goods imported doubled from the 1919 level to around £4,000,000. This continued with the total trade between 1920–26 being double that of 1913–19, and revenue improving by 100 per cent. In spite of a slump in cocoa, revenue increased by over £1,000,000 from 1919 to 1920. Moreover, the cocoa price recovered and in the 1920s was consistently around £50 a tonne, reaching £80 and even £120, compared with an average of £20 to £30 a tonne in the 1930s; H.E. Governor Guggisberg, ‘A Review of 1920: Speech in the Legislative Council’, Gold Coast Pioneer 1, no. 1 (Accra: February 1921): 10–11, NEWS8145, NP000449727, British Library (Boston Spa, uk). It must be noted that the 1920–23 depression did mean that the initial development plan costing £24,000,000 had to be reduced to £16,648,848: Florence M. Bourret, Ghana: The Road to Independence, 1919–1957 (London: Oxford University Press, 1960), 26–32.\n\nThe government sent the African Dr Tagoe to take charge of the hospital and operating theatre at Dunkwa in 1927. Tagoe was greeted by formal protest from Dunkwa’s local Europeans. The state demanded that Tagoe remain in place in order to ‘give the lie direct to any possible assertion by ill-advised persons that any British Government shows any racial prejudice in dealing with the governed’. At the time, there were only three African medical officers out of the sixty-seven total medical staff in the wams. ‘The Case of Dr. Edward Tagoe’, Gold Coast Colony Legislative Council Debates, no. 1 Session 1927–8, 188–9, Balme Library, University of Ghana (Accra).

Given the obvious links to Christ’s ministry of healing outcast lepers, Vongsathorn has noted how ‘missionaries wrote often that in healing they were following in the footsteps of Christ, and this was truer of leprosy than other ailments’; Kathleen Vongsathorn, ‘Gnawing Pains, Festering Ulcers, and Nightmare Suffering: Selling Leprosy as a Humanitarian Cause in the British Empire, c. 1890–1960’, The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 40, no. 5 (December 2012): 863–78 [PMC free article: PMC4055987] [PubMed: 24932060]; Kathleen Vongsathorn, ‘“First and Foremost the Evangelist?”’\n\n‘Appendix X: Development and Welfare Schemes Initiated or in Progress in 1949’, Colonial Office: Annual Report on the Gold Coast for the Year 1949 (London: His Majesty’s Stationery Office, 1950) British Library (Boston Spa, uk). It must be noted that the focus of the colonial government on yaws, smallpox, and sleeping sickness may have been to do with the relative ease of tackling these diseases. In the case of yaws it may also have been related to its similarities to syphilis which was a major concern for many British colonial officers and missionaries in interwar colonial Africa. On syphilis and yaws in early colonial Uganda see Shane Doyle, Before hiv: Sexuality, Fertility and Mortality in East Africa, 1900–1980 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), esp. 123–38.\n\nHowever, reliance or otherwise on patient fees was only very loosely linked to a mission’s location and was connected to a wider set of factors. The significance of patient fees makes it worth considering whether or not some missions had to be positioned in areas where patients had access to cash in order to pay for the service. The appendix shows that the Catholic missions in the Upper East, Upper West, and North were generally more dependent on government grants and in many cases smaller percentages of their funding came from patient fees. At Jirapa, Nandom, and NavrongoBolgatanga (all in the North) the patient fees for hospital contributions are paltry compared with those at St Joseph’s Clinic in Ashanti and the Holy Family Hospital at Berekum. Northern mobile clinics such as at Jirapa do have a far higher patient fee contribution, and at the clinic at Yendi, 100 per cent of contributions came from patient fees. Perhaps in the North, where the cash economy was less developed because the area had been colonial labour reservoir, patient fees were less reliable, whereas in the South, in Asante and Brong-Ahafo, some missions fared better at relying on clients. Though again, during the 1980s, ready cash was scarce across most of the nation. Overall, however, there is no strong correlation shown in the available data between patient fees as a percentage of overall income and regional location. There was also very little correlation between the size of the population in a 10 km radius from the institution and patient fees percentage. While these may have been factors they certainly cannot be regarded as determining ones. Instead, there was a range of factors such as urban connections, mobility, sizes, foreign funding, and government links in play; location seems to have made only some difference to the makeup of contributions.\n\nThank you to the Grant family, particularly Anna Mary, Francis, and Mary Grant, for their support. There is not scope within this book to fully cover how the diverse array of Achimota alumni relate to Aggrey’s legacy, or how other eminent schools and colleges in Ghana have formed postgraduate networks and international diasporic connections in dialogue with past eminent teachers and students. Further work on this would be illuminating, especially in relation to the University of Ghana and other kinds of tertiary education development. Suffice it to say here that the Achimota oft-repeated statement that graduates go out to be ‘living waters to a thirsty land’ (echoing Jesus Christs words in the Gospel of John) is one of the many foundational principles that appears to still shape the lives and work of this globally influential community.\n\nActing Secretary, ‘Memorandum for the President, Subject: Relations with Ghana’, 1–2 14.A.1 Internal Security Assessment, rg0059, Department of State, Bureau of African Affairs, Office of the West African Affairs, ca.1960–1985, Entry# A1 3112A, records relating to Ghana, United States National Archives II (Maryland, usa); From S.

Olukoshi, The African Union and New Strategies for Development in Africa (New York: Cambria Press, 2008), 190.\n\nThis new approach has been possible through the analysis of previously unexamined papers in the Misereor archives in Aachen, the National Catholic Secretariat in Accra, the archives of the Medical Mission Sisters in Philadelphia, and the archives of the World Council of Churches in Geneva. Comparing the caches in these various depositories enables the evidencing of historical arguments which go beyond the simplistic narratives of international organisations or national governments alone. It also offers the possibility of challenging common historical categories of ‘development’ which have not taken into account the complexity of the term’s production across many contexts and by many actors, especially in the postcolonial period.\n\nKatherine Marshall has shown clearly the tensions between international organisations, such as the World Bank, and the religious ‘assets’ with which they have been keen to work; Katherine Marshall, Global Institutions of Religion: Ancient Movers, Moderns Shakers (New York: Routledge, 2013). In her ethnographic analysis, Susan R. Holman has drawn out the paradoxes and hostility that exist as the relationship between the religion and global health polarizes; Susan R. Holman, Beholden: Religion, Global Health, and Human Rights (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015). As Katherine Marshall and Sally Smith experienced, clear health damage resulted from religion’s neglect in the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea in 2014–16; Katherine Marshall and Sally Smith, ‘Religion and Ebola: Learning from Experience’, The Lancet 386, no. 10005 (2015): e24 [PubMed: 26159395]. By contrast, on aids and religion, see Marian Burchardt, Faith in the Time of aids: Religion, Biopolitics and Modernity in South Africa (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015); Rijk Van Dijk et al., Religion and aids Treatment in Africa: Saving Souls, Prolonging Lives (Farnham, Surrey, and Burlington, vt: Ashgate, 2014)."
