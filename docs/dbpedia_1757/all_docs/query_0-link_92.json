        "text": "5 August 2024: Newsletter of the Network of European Restitution Committees No. 18\n\nThe latest newsletter is published by the UK Spoliation Advisory Panel and can be read here or here as a PDF. It includes an introduction by Gabriele Finaldi, Director of the UK National Gallery and Chair of the UK Spoliation Working Group of the National Museum Directors’ Council (NMDC) and news of the publication of Nazi-era Provenance of Museum Collections: A research guide by Jacques Schuhmacher, Senior Provenance Research Curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), which is downloadable for free. There are sections on substantive changes at the French Commission for the Compensation of Victims of Spoliation (CIVS) and Germany's Advisory Commission, and changes of personnel at the Dutch Restitutions Committee. It includes details of various recent restitution decisions and exhibitions in Austria and the Netherlands. There is also an account of the 23 May 2024 Network of European Restitution Committees Spoliation Conference at the V&A in London, where the five European Restitution Committees et to discuss the ongoing work of the network. This was followed by a public conference of a panel discussion by representatives of each committee led by Dr. Charlotte Woodhead, Associate Professor at the University of Warwick. The conference highlighted and discussed the recent 'Best Practices for the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art’, focusing on their relationship to the work of the European restitution committees.\n\nDutch Restitutions Committee Binding Opinion to restitute Matisse 'Odalisque' to the heirs of Albert Stern\n\nOn 25 June 2024, the Dutch Restitutions Committee announced their binding opinion that the Henri Matisse painting ‘Odalisque’,1920-1921, be restituted to the heirs of Albert Stern (1861-1945) represented by the Commission for Looted Art in Europe. The painting has been in the collection of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam since 19 July 1941 when it was sold under duress by Albert Stern in an ultimately failed effort to save the lives of all his family. The Committee stated that the investigation conducted by the Commission for Looted Art in Europe conclusively demonstrated that the family was subjected to persecution from 1933 onwards, first in Germany where they lived and then from 1937 in the Netherlands where they had fled and where they were gradually stripped of their possessions and their livelihood. They made several unsuccessful efforts to escape and eventually were forced to sell their remaining possessions to try to survive. Most of the family including Albert Stern and his two sons did not survive.\n\nThe Binding Opinion is available here in Dutch (and as a PDF here) and here in English (and as a PDF here).

Bührle Bericht von Prof. Dr. Raphael Gross\n\nProfessor Dr Raphael Gross has published his much anticipated independent report on provenance research into the E. G. Bührle Collection in the Kunsthaus Zurich. The report was commissioned in 2023 by the City of Zurich, the Canton of Zurich and the Zurich Society of Fine Arts following lengthy criticism of the research that had been undertaken. The report finds significant problems with the previous research, some of which was very superficial leading to false conclusions, amongst them that works with particularly incomplete provenance and Jewish owners were classified as unproblematic. He identifies five works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, Kalf and Gauguin which exemplify this approach. He makes three recommendations: 1. that research continue but with the aim of clarifying previous Jewish ownership and persecution-related confiscation; 2. that an interdisciplinary panel be set up to identify Nazi-related confiscations in the Kunsthaus's own collection and its long term loans within the context of the Washington Best Practices document of March 2024; 3. that the Kunsthaus conduct a public debate on the Bührle Collection of 633 works of art and, in particular, on whether its presentation at the Kunsthaus can be squared with a public institution's moral and ethical responsibilities. To read the report, please see here.\n\n4 June 2024: A fair and just restitution agreement for a Kirchner painting from the Wallerstein Collection in the Brücke-Museum Berlin\n\nThe Commission for Looted Art in Europe and the Berlin Senate Department for Culture and Social Cohesion jointly announced the restitution of the German expressionist painting 'Erich Heckel and Otto Müller Playing Chess', 1913, by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, which had entered the collection of the Brücke-Museum Berlin in 1973. The heirs agreed that the painting will stay in the museum which houses the largest collection of works of the Brücke, the German expressionist movement.\n\nThe painting belonged to Dr Victor Wallerstein (1878-1944), a great art historian, gallerist and patron of German modernism who in 1919 founded the Galerie Goldschmidt-Wallerstein in Berlin with Dr Fritz Goldschmidt. Forced to close the gallery in 1934, in 1936 he and his wife sought refuge in Italy, only to suffer persecution first under Italian racial laws and then again under the Germans. With no means of livelihood, the painting had to be sold in c.1940 to pay for food and lodging. Dr Wallerstein died in Florence in 1944, following arrest by the SS.\n\nHis heirs said that it was fitting to leave the painting in the museum in order permanently to mark the contribution of Dr Wallerstein to the movement of which he was a great patron and to keep Dr Wallerstein's memory alive in Berlin where he was such a remarkable and notable figure. ‘For the heirs, the fair and just solution of this restitution claim represents an acknowledgement of the pain, terror, and tragedy to which the innocent Wallerstein family was subjected. It is also a recognition of the cultural contribution that Victor Wallerstein and his siblings made to the arts and society in Germany which was the very essence of who they were. The heirs are pleased that the forthcoming exhibition, 'Biographies of Modern Art. Collectors and Their Works' will pay tribute to Dr Victor Wallerstein as one of the leading patrons of German Expressionism'.\n\nTo read the press release, see it here in English and here in German.\n\n30 May 2024: Declaration on the protection of archives, libraries, museums and heritage places during armed conflicts and political instability\n\nThe joint declaration of the International Council on Archives (ICA), the International Council of Museums (ICOM), the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) expresses the institutions' profound concern about the escalating destruction of life and cultural heritage during armed conﬂict and political instability.

Key aspects involved include improving \"the possibility of initiating proceedings vis-à-vis public cultural property preservation bodies, the inclusion of claimants in the proceedings and a binding evaluation framework for decision-making. Transparency and consistency should be guaranteed for all parties involved in the procedure at all times\".\n\nKey elements are:\n\n1. Replacement of the Advisory Commission with an arbitration tribunal\n\n2. New rules of procedure and a comprehensive, differentiated assessment framework.\n\n3. Decisions to be legally binding and reviewable by a further body.\n\n4. Unilateral access by a party\n\n5. Provenance research to be strengthened with the possibility of commissioning additional expert reports during proceedings\n\n6. Cultural institutions to clearly label cultural property confiscated as a result of Nazi persecution; and the often forgotten fates of art owners to be made visible to the public and appropriately honoured, this to apply particularly to confiscated works whose heirs cannot currently be identified.\n\n7. Cultural institutions to consistently report restitutions and other just and fair solutions to the German Lost Art Foundation with the wish of restitution recipients for confidentiality to be fully honoured. Private individuals also be called upon to report fair and equitable solutions to the German Lost Art Foundation.\n\nBoth points 6 and 7 are to be implemented immediately. Points 1-5 will be implemented by the end of 2024 at the latest.\n\nTo read the paper, see here.\n\nBest Practices for the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art 5 March 2024\n\nThe U.S. State Department has released 'Best Practices for the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art' prepared by a network of Special Envoys and Representatives for Holocaust Issues from 14 countries in recognition of the 25th anniversary of the Washington Conference Principles. The Best Practices document defines 'art' as all kinds of cultural property; defines 'confiscated' as all methods of dispossession; states that all sales by a persecuted person between 1933-1945 can be considered equivalent to an involuntary transfer of property; and states that 'just and fair solutions' means just and fair solutions primarily for the victims of the the Nazis and their heirs, and that the primary just and fair solution is restitution.\n\nThere are 15 Best Practices set out in the document which can be viewed here and on the US State Department website here.\n\nAlso issued on 5 March 2024 was a Press Release by the US State Department here, Video Remarks by US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken here, and Remarks by Stuart Eizenstat, Special Adviser on Holocaust Issues, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, available here. The entire event is available as a transcript here and with a video here\n\nHolocaust-Era Looted Cultural Property: A Current Worldwide Overview 5 March 2024\n\nThe World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO) has issued a report on art restitution achievements and failures over the 25 years since the 1998 Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets. The WJRO states that \"while seven countries have made major progress in art and cultural property restitution, 24 countries from among the 47 surveyed have made minimal to no progress. Additionally, the report emphasizes the critical need to direct attention toward art and cultural property in private collections, signaling a vital area for future focus\".

Since he had to send the original requests back to the office, he made detailed excerpts of these requests so that his decisions could be traced. He meticulously recorded the information about the applicants and suppliers of the pictures as well as the key data about the paintings to be imported. He creates very precise sketches based on the photos submitted by the applicants.\n\nSome of the envelopes with Righini's excerpts have been preserved in the archives of the Righini-Fries Foundation. Unfortunately, the record is incomplete and only represents a part of the actual volume of requests. Nevertheless, this source is significant. Research in the Federal Archives has shown that art imports during the period in question are only fragmentarily documented. The original requests were destroyed after the then applicable retention period of 10 years. The documents in the possession of the Righini-Fries Foundation therefore represent a unique source. They shed light on the art trade in Switzerland in the 1930s and can provide valuable information for provenance research.\n\nFor further information: www.righini-fries.ch/die-forschung/provenienzforschung/ / katalog.kunstimporte.righini-fries.ch/intro/\n\n24 January 2024: Announcement of a collaboration between the OFP Project Berlin-Brandenburg and lootedart.com\n\nThe lootedart.com database now includes details of 230 seized artworks, mainly paintings and works on paper, as well as sculptures and a carpet, belonging to 13 German Jewish families, and which should be restituted. They were identified as a result of the work of the OFP Project Berlin-Brandenburg, funded by the German and federal state governments, which has been researching the 42,000 persecuted victim files of the Nazi Vermögensverwertungsstelle (Asset Realisation Office) established at the beginning of January 1942. The files record the systematic liquidation of victims' assets, and contain detailed information on the art objects that were seized and then disposed of by the Reich.\n\nThe collaboration with lootedart.com has enabled the publication of these seized artworks which include images of 34 of the artworks and the identification of the current location of six of the seized artworks. The OFP Project has compiled detailed files for each artwork which will be made available to the families so that they may pursue and recover the artworks.\n\nBackground: In 2019, the OFP Project Berlin-Brandenburg at the Brandenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv (Brandenburg Main State Archive) (BLHA), Germany,began systematically researching the 42,000 persecuted victim files (Rep. 36 A Oberfinanzpräsident Berlin-Brandenburg (OFP) (II)) of the Vermögensverwertungsstelle (Asset Realisation Office).\n\nThe Vermögensverwertungsstelle was established at the beginning of January 1942 as the mass deportation of Jews began, and was part of the Oberfinanzpräsident Berlin-Brandenburg (OFP) (Berlin-Brandenburg Finance Office) which was responsible for enabling the seizure of property of people persecuted by the Nazis as Jewish or hostile to the Reich. The victim files record the systematic liquidation of their assets, and, in some cases, contain detailed information on the art objects that were seized and then disposed of by the Reich.\n\nAs a result of the OFP Project’s work, many seized artworks have been identified, as well as the current locations for some of them. All the artworks are subject to restitution. The OFP Project has compiled digitised files and evidence of ownership and loss for each identified seizure, and will make those available to families whose art objects have been identified so that they may pursue claims.\n\nIn order to make this information widely available, the OFP Project sought a collaboration with lootedart.com, the Central Registry of Information for Looted Cultural Property 1933-1945. All the object information identified to date has now been published in the Central Registry database on this website. Further work by the OFP Project to identify more seized artworks and their current locations is ongoing and will be added to the lootedart.com database as it becomes available.\n\nThere are currently 175 individual entries of artworks seized from 13 different German Jewish families in the lootedart.com database. The 175 entries comprise a total of some 230 objects, and include mainly paintings and works on paper, as well as sculptures and a carpet. Images of 34 of the artworks have been identified by the OFP Project and are published. The current location of six of the looted artworks has also been found by the OFP Project.\n\nThe objects in the lootedart.com database are fully searchable by artist name, title of the artwork and by provenance. All identified artworks can be viewed by entering ‘OFP Project’ into the ‘Source’ field in the ‘Provenance’ section on the lootedart.com search page.\n\nThe names of the original owners have not been published as a matter of privacy. But any families seeking further information may contact either the OFP Project ofp.provenienz@blha.brandenburg.de or the Central Registry info@lootedart.com.\n\nAnyone with further information on the current location of any of the artworks published in the Central Registry database should also contact either the OFP Project ofp.provenienz@blha.brandenburg.de or the Central Registry info@lootedart.com. All contact details are provided with each entry.\n\nThe OFP Project is funded by the German federal and state governments and will run until 2026. For full details of the Project please see here for the English language text and here for the German text.\n\nDigitisation of the seizure records of the Vermögensverwertungsstelle (Asset Realisation Office)\n\nOn 24 January 2024, lootedart.com announced the publication in its database of 230 seized artworks, mainly paintings and works on paper, belonging to 13 German Jewish families, and identified as a result of the work of the OFP Project Berlin-Brandenburg (see below for further details). The OFP Project has now made available online digitised copies of the approx, 40,400 source files. These are from the Nazi Vermögensverwertungsstelle (Asset Realisation Office), established at the beginning of 1942, and which documented the systematic sale of the victims' assets. The files are in the Brandenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv (Brandenburg Main State Archive) in record group Rep. 36A Oberfinanzpräsident Berlin-Brandenburg (II).\n\nThe OFP Project hope the digitised files will 'promote a serious and critical examination of the Nazi era, an engagement with one's own family history and the creation of a democratic, pluralistic and diverse culture of remembrance'. The files will also provide evidence of loss due to persecution and therefore will be essential documentation in any claims made by the families. The OFP Project encourages any family, researcher or interested party to contact them with any questions at ofp.provenienz@blha.brandenburg.de\n\nAmsterdam: New Master Specialisation in Provenance Research and Restitution\n\nThe Universiteit van Amsterdam is offering a new Master specialisation in provenance research and restitution within the Dual Master’s programme Heritage and Memory Studies. This unique and interdisciplinary programme is now open for registration through March 1st, 2024. For more information and eligibility requirements follow the link: https://ow.ly/4lls50QCzkB\n\n22 February 2024: Application for Turnover Warrant filed by the Manhattan District Attorney\n\nMatthew Bogdanos, the Manhattan District Attorney, on Friday 22 February filed a turnover motion for the return of the Egon Schiele artwork 'Russian War Prisoner' from the Chicago Art Institute to \"its lawful owner, the heirs of Fritz Grünbaum: Judge Timothy Reif, David Fraenkel, and Milos Vavra\". Chicago is contesting an earlier court order to return the drawing.\n\nIn the motion, the DA wrote that \"the documented inventorying, impounding, and eventual sale of Fritz Grünbaum’s stolen art collection is one of the most flagrant Nazi-era lootings of a Holocaust victim’s cultural property yet uncovered. The evidence demonstrates that Grünbaum’s art collection, particularly his 80-plus works by Egon Schiele, were systematically stolen from Grünbaum after he was imprisoned in the Dachau Concentration Camp for the crime of being Jewish and then sold for personal profit as part of a conspiracy involving at least the following two individuals. First, was Nazi-looted-art trafficker and launderer Eberhard Kornfeld, who operated out of his Bern, Switzerland, auction house. The evidence will show that not only was Kornfeld known to have dealt in Nazi-looted art throughout his career, most especially in the post-war years, but also it was through his machinations that Fritz Grünbaum’s Schieles were laundered for so long.. Second, was gallerist Otto Kallir, who operated out of his New York City gallery. The evidence will show that Kallir had known Grünbaum personally in Vienna between the two world wars and had coveted Grünbaum’s Schiele collection prior to Grünbaum’s 1938 arrest by the Nazis. As a result, after Grünbaum’s Schiele artworks, including Russian War Prisoner, were stolen by the Nazis and laundered by Kornfeld, many were brought to the United States by Kallir, and ultimately purchased from his New York City gallery by American museums or private collectors.\n\nTo read the 160 page application, please see here.\n\n17 January 2024: 'Just and Fair Solutions – From Principles to Law', a paper by Ambassador James Bindenagel\n\nAt the online conference 'Restitution of Nazi-Looted Art: The Next 25 Years' on 17 January 2024, marking the conclusion of a three-year joint project of the Bonn and Tel Aviv Universities, Ambassador James Bindenagel, former US Ambassador for Holocaust Issues (ret), gave a paper titled 'Just and Fair Solutions – From Principles to Law' .\n\nAmbassador Bindenagel worked with Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat to formulate the 1998 Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. His paper explores the two critical problems that he identifies as having emerged over the last 25 years. These are firstly the 'hoarding' by governments of information about provenance and the implications of this widespread lack of transparency in thwarting justice; and secondly the treatment of Holocaust-era confiscated property by governments as their own property and the necessity of this ceasing to happen. He calls for all governments adhering to the Washington Principles to mandate that any property in government or museum possession where Holocaust-related transfer or confiscation cannot be ruled out be deemed held in perpetual trust. He also calls for governments and museums, as custodians of this property, to publish each year a list of all works in their trust, all associated provenance information and details of steps taken to contact any rightful owner(s) identified.\n\nTo read the paper in full, please click here.\n\nJanuary 2024: Publication of second annual issue of online journal 'transfer' – Zeitschrift für Provenienzforschung und Sammlungsgeschichte / Journal for Provenance Research and the History of Collections\n\nEdited by Ulrike Saß and Christoph Zuschlag, and published at https://doi.org/10.48640/tf.2023.1, articles fall into four categories: Interviews, Research Articles (Peer Review), Research Reports and Case Studies. For a complete list of the contents and links to all the articles, please see here.\n\nPhD/Masters programme RMIT University Melbourne: Restitution for missing property - art, objects and land - consequent of genocide, war, natural disasters\n\nFor students interested in examining the socio-legal and economic ramifications for when property goes missing during war, genocide or man-made/natural disasters. After these events, there may be a misalignment of ownership and possession of art, objects (chattels) or even land. It may be contentious as to whether such property was sold, abandoned, stolen and so on. These are uncomfortable conversations at the national and international levels. There are international treaties to be considered, sometimes local laws, as well as many lessons to be learnt from the horrific experiences from the Shoah (Holocaust), Cambodia, Rwanda, Darfur, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as earthquakes, tsunamis and other impactful man-made/natural disaster events. For full details, see here.\n\nJanuary 2024: Obermayer Award for Anneke de Rudder\n\nA provenance researcher and historian at the Hamburg State and University Library, Anneke de Rudder has done exhaustive research on the lives of Jews in the Lower Saxony town of Lüneburg and elsewhere for many years. She has focused on researching objects looted by the Nazis, finding and contacting the rightful owners or their heirs. Many of these descendants have come to Germany, and she has introduced them to their ancestors’ hometowns and built connections between them and contemporary Germans. This includes, at the request of the Lüneburg Museum, leading efforts to find almost 60 heirs of a once-prominent Jewish citizen of Lüneburg, Marcus Heinemann, and helping organize a restitution ceremony attended by several dozen descendants. She is also developing a digital database of Lüneburg’s Jewish famlies, featuring names, dates, stories, and photographs. It will serve as a resource for descendants, local residents, and researchers worldwide. The Award will be presented in Berlin on 29 January 2024.\n\nThe Obermayer Awards, organized and administered by Widen the Circle, honor German individuals and groups that have illuminated the vital role Jews played in German society for hundreds of years before the Nazi era.

The Commission will deal with cases of both Nazi-looted art and colonial heritage. The Council said that during the National Socialist era, numerous Jewish-owned cultural assets were directly or indirectly expropriated. Such looted art also found its way to Switzerland, among other places. Restitution and compensation claims have been asserted since the end of the Second World War. This regularly leads to legal uncertainties and disputes. Dealing with such historically burdened cultural heritage is an important goal of the Confederation's cultural policy. The Federal Council supports the transparent processing of burdened testimonies of the past and the implementation of fair and equitable solutions. With the independent expert commission, the Federal Council is setting up a body that can provide advice in controversial cases and make non-binding recommendations in individual cases. To read the Decree establishing the Commission, see the PDF here.\n\n30 October 2023: Digitisation of the Commission de Récupération Artistique section of the French Diplomatic Archives\n\nThe Diplomatic Archives now offer fully searchable access to the inventories and digitized archives of the Commission de Récupération Artistique (Commission for Art Recovery) (CRA) section in the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs files.

S. Drey gallery in Munich for a Byzantine ivory relief entitled Hodegetria or Virgin and Child (maker unknown), which is currently held by Rotterdam City Council and is in the collection of Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. The Committee stated that research by the Expert Centre Restitution (ECR) had shown that this artwork came from the collection of the gallery in Munich, which until 1936 was in the hands of the German-Jewish Drey family and that it had become sufficiently plausible that possession of the work was lost involuntarily due to circumstances directly connected with the Nazi regime.

It is available here in full in Hebrew and here as a summary in English. The Team's website is here.\n\nThe team involved the Ministry of Culture and Sport, the Ministry for Social Equality, the Ministry of Heritage, the Administrator General, and the Counselling and Legislation Department in the Ministry of Justice.\n\nAt the basis of the recommendations is \"the aspiration to conduct provenance research i.e., to identify the owners of the works and cultural assets appropriated during the Nazi era, to locate their heirs and current rightful owners, and to formulate relevant just and fair solutions\", which so far have not been available nationally in Israel.\n\nThe key recommendations are:\n\n1. That 'Recognized Museums' (by the Ministry of Culture and Sport) be obliged to conduct provenance research on 'plastic artworks' - paintings, drawings, graphic works, sculpture - supported with funds from the Ministry of Culture. Failure to conduct research may lead to a reduction of financial support for the museum. The researchers must have proven experience and specially designated training on Holocaust-era spoliation.\n\n2. That the Administrator General in the Ministry of Justice be authorised to conduct research to locate the rightful owners of looted artworks, legally verify their inheritance rights and reinstate their rights to the looted artwork.\n\n3. That an Appeals Committee of a former judge, qualified lawyer and art expert be established by the Minister of Justice with jurisdiction over decisions of the Adminstrator General, disclosure obligations, the issuing of inheritance orders, etc.\n\n4. That the individual museum finalise the settlement with the rightful owners or heirs either through restitution or other just and fair solutions agreed with the heirs.\n\n5. That a dedicated website publish research, the location of rightful owners, the determination of rights, and the outcomes.\n\n6. That where heirs cannot be traced, the work remain where it is and its history be commemorated.\n\n7. That good faith acquisitions and statute of limitations be no defence against claims.\n\nAn Overview of the 2023 Israeli Inter-Ministerial Report about Looted Art in Israel by Eyal Dolev\n\nEyal Dolev, an independent provenance researcher in Israel and moderator of the joint academic course \"Nazi looted Art\" (co-organized by Bonn University and Tel-Aviv University) has written an article commenting on the Israeli government proposals set out above.\n\nHe notes that the report prioritizes research of artworks once held by US collecting points. Also that until now, no governmental budget was allocated for provenance research but this research might be financed by the Israeli government in the future. Legislation to enable restitution is necessary in order to overcome the current protection provided by the Israeli law to bona fide purchasers. While some claims have been agreed in Israel, others have been rejected and the report 'genuinely suggests that a new mechanism will be deployed in settling these claims'. As for the future of the draft legislation, Dolev says that it is still unclear whether Yariv Levin, the Israeli Justice Minister who is currently extremely busy with promoting his controversial \"legal reform,\" will find enough time to regulate the artworks issue in due course.\n\nEyal Dolev's article is available to read here.\n\nRoyal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium to start 4-year research project ProvEnhance - three posts available\n\nThe aim of ProvEnhance is to lay a global scientific and methodological frame for provenance research in Belgium for artworks acquired around WWII.

Application deadline 30 June 2023.

Decisions on restitution will be made by the Commission pour l’indemnisation des victimes de spoliations (CIVS) after an assessment of the circumstances of loss. Till now, an individual law has had to be passed to enable restitution in each successful claim. To read the press release issued by the Ministry of Culture, see here.\n\nApril 2023: Restitution for missing property - art, objects and land - consequent of genocide, war, natural disasters - New PhD Program/Masters by Thesis at RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia\n\nFor students interested in examining the socio-legal and economic ramifications for when property goes missing during war, genocide or man-made/natural disasters.

It is 20 years since the Commission was founded, and Professor Papier states that Germany needs comprehensive legislation on restitution which has long been promised. The political and moral commitments are not sufficient, particularly in view of Germany's ultimate responsibility. He also says the Commission's recommendations need to be binding which would have a more powerful impact, and that the Commission itself should be assigned guaranteed autonomous status regulated by law. Lastly, he says that it is untenable that cases can only come to the Commission if both parties agree. In too many cases, states or institutions refuse. There must be, he states, the option of unilateral requests for restitution.\n\nAlso in the Newsletter are articles on the work, procedure and approach of the Commission as well as interviews with longstanding member Prof. Rita Süssmuth and Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat. There is case news from the Netherlands (Gutmann), France (Stern), Austria (Hirschenhauser, Illner) and Switzerland (Bührle), information about memorialisation and reconciliation projects in Austria and Germany, and a report on the project to facilitate and digitise access to Wiedergutmachung (compensation and restitution) records and the creation of a new online Wiedergutmachung platform which aims to enable research into the personal histories of the persecuted as well as into Germany's handling of post-war claims.\n\nTo read the Newsletter, click here.\n\nApril 2023: Intellectuals Displaced from Fascist Italy\n\nigrants, Exiles and Refugees Fleeing for Political and Racial Reasons is a\n\nfree-access portal that tells the life stories of intellectuals, women and\n\nmen, Italians and foreigners, who left Italy as a result of Fascist\n\npersecution and racial laws.

This may also include, following in-depth investigation and clarification of specific circumstances, artworks sold by emigrants in what are termed ‘safe’ third countries outside the area of Nazi rule, such as Switzerland.\n\nThe strategy includes an ongoing systematic review of collection holdings, a systematic review of new acquisitions and loans, transparent and solution-oriented approach to sales outside the area of Nazi rule, active education, specialist networking and online publication of archive holdings, as well as a proactive approach where there are suspicions of cultural property confiscated as a result of Nazi persecution and, where the circumstances are clear, a firm approach.\n\nDecisions regarding a ‘just and fair solution’ will be taken by the Director’s provenance committee on the basis of the results of provenance research. The committee will comprise the Director, the Collection Curator, the Head of Provenance Research and a legal representative. It will be assisted by an independent body in the form of an international commission of experts to provide advice and formulate proposals. It will then submit a proposal regarding further action to be taken to the Board, headed by the Chair.\n\nThe paper is available to read here.\n\nDetails of Switzerland's Independent SKKG-Appointed Commission for the Clarification of Nazi Persecution-Related Claims (Unabhängige Kommission der Stiftung für Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte zur Klärung NS-verfolgungsbedingter Ansprüche)\n\nThe Independent Commission SKKG, recently established, is autonomous and makes its decisions independently of both the Stiftung für Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte (SKKG) (Foundation for Art, Culture and History) board and the in-house Provenance Research Team. It is composed of five to seven people per term, with the option of a one-time re-election for another three years. Since the Commission's work deals with cultural property lost due to Nazi persecution, it is diverse in terms of religious as well as legal, ethical, cultural and historical background. President is Dr. Andrea Raschèr, and members are Dr. Claudia Kaufmann, Prof. Dr. Stefanie Mahrer and Olaf Ossman, Attorney-at-Law. From 1995-2006 Dr. Raschèr ran the department of legal and international affairs at the Swiss Federal Office of Culture.\n\nIn the initial phase (July 2022 to December 2023), a team of seven researchers headed by Carolin Lange and Thomas Schmutz is examining up to a maximum of 700 paintings. The Independent Commission SKKG will assess how to deal with the results of the provenance research. The Independent Commission’s work is subject to the SKKG’s principles for dealing with cultural objects lost due to Nazi persecution, as well as its procedural rules. All details of its Guidelines and Principles, as well as its contact details, are available here.\n\nWhat is the provenance of this 17th centry Dutch iron chest or 'armada' in the Dutch NK collection\n\nThe Dutch Cultural Heritage Agency (RCE) is investigating many objects in the Dutch NK collection whose ownership is unknown. (NK works were retrieved from Germany after the war and brought back to The Netherlands.)\n\nThe chest, NK 245, measures 41 (h) x 76 (w) x 38 (d) cm, is covered in polychrome paint richly decorated in many shades of green and yellow. Dutch scenes with ships, landscapes with trees, windmills and haystacks are surrounded by tulips and other flowers on the lid and front plate. An inscription on the metal band on the lid reads: ‘Whoever saves finds something in the pot’, with the date ‘Anno 1691’.\n\nThe chest has a complicated closing mechanism with hidden keyholes and false panels and can only be opened by performing actions in a certain order. The contents are unknown, because it has yet to be opened. Money, jewelry and valuable papers can often been found in this type of chest.\n\nIt was taken to Germany during the occupation of the Netherlands and returned on 10 July 1946.\n\nIf you know to whom it belongs or have any additional information on this chest, please contact restitutie@cultureelerfgoed.nl.\n\nDutch Restitutions Committee: Unanswered Questions\n\n23 February 2023: There are several unanswered questions hanging over the Dutch Restitutions Committee, despite it now being almost one month since the sudden and dramatic resignations of the Chairman Jacob Kohnstamm and Vice-Chairman Els Swaab over an \"internal matter\".\n\nA former State Secretary, Jacob Kohnstamm was the chair of the government-appointed Evaluation Committee which created 'Striving for Justice', the new restitution framework in the Netherlands adopted by the Dutch government. In September 2021, he was appointed chairman of the Restitutions Committee. To the outside world, his appointment and that of Els Swaab represented the unambiguous commitment of the Dutch government to implement in full that new framework and approach.\n\nSince 2021, under its new leadership, the Restitutions Committee had flourished and provided the transparent and thoughtful decisions that did much to restore confidence within the international community in the fairness and justice of the Dutch restitution process which had previously been fundamentally eroded.\n\nHowever, the still unexplained resignations have had a damaging impact both nationally and internationally on the trust that is esential to the restitution process in the Netherlands. Claimants are concerned about how their cases will be handled; they are reluctant to submit to what is now an opaque process in an uncertain framework; and the suggestion, made last week, that new appointments will be made, but outside any timetable, leaves the Restitutions Committee in effective limbo for months to come.\n\nThe chair and vice-chair were central to the restored faith in the Netherlands restitution process. It is essential that there be an explanation of what occurred and how an \"internal matter' was allowed to destroy the international confidence that had been rebuilt with such care over the last three years.\n\n10 February 2023: Dutch Restitutions Committee attempts to allay concerns over its future direction\n\nFollowing the sudden and unexplained resignations of the Chair Jacob Kohnstamm and the Vicechair Else Swab announced last week, the Restitutions Committee has issued another statement. Jacob Kohnstamm was not only the Chair but also the Chair of the Evaluation Committee which created the new assessment framework, and his departure has raised grave concerns. The statement is reproduced in full below:\n\n'Restitutions Committee sets course and carries on working flat out\n\nFollowing the recent departure of two of its members, the Restitutions Committee (RC) is taking all possible steps in order to continue its task of striving for the restoration of rights relating to art that was lost involuntarily during the Nazi era.The current substantive approach will be maintained.\n\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) is giving priority to filling the vacancies in the RC that have arisen (see Appointment of RC members below). In the interests of continuity, the independent RC is continuing its activities unabated. State Secretary for Culture and Media Gunay Uslu attaches great importance to this.\n\nSo that the RC can continue its work without delay after the departure of two of its members, lawyer and former notary Dick Oostinga has taken on the task of vice-chair, supported by the other committee members. The RC currently has five members. At least three members are required for handling cases, including the chair or vice-chair.\n\nCommittee takes comments seriously\n\nThe RC understands that the departure of two members referred to above can give rise to questions about the course it is following, and it takes comments about the issue seriously. The departures relate to an internal matter that the RC cannot discuss in the interests of due care. It explains the course it is following in more detail below.\n\nA critical evaluation of the restitution policy in 2020 by the Second World War Nazi Looted Art Restitution Policy Evaluation Committee resulted in significant changes, which the RC welcomed and has meanwhile implemented. These changes were aimed at uniform and clear decision making, and an open and engaged approach to restitution applicants.\n\nNew assessment framework\n\nThe advisory report Streven naar Rechtvaardigheid (Striving for Justice) was prepared by the Evaluation Committee after consultation with, among others, the members of the Restitutions Committee. They furthermore contributed to the drafting of the new assessment framework, which has been in force since 22 April 2021. In it, for example, there is no longer a defensible step of weighing up interests as part of the substantive handling of restitution applications.\n\nThis assessment framework continues unchanged as guiding and determining in the preparation of recommendations and rulings. In accordance with the Washington Principles, assessment is aimed at reaching ‘a just and fair solution’.\n\nAppointment of RC members\n\nThe Decree Establishing the Restitutions Committee states that the RC may have a maximum of seven members. The State Secretary of OCW appoints the members of the RC and its chair. The State Secretary is supported in this by an appropriately qualified appointments advisory committee. The RC itself has no influence on the appointment process.\n\nCandidates must comply with specified profiles that contain the requirements. Advertisements in widely read daily newspapers invite candidates to apply. The Ministry of OCW has meanwhile initiated preparation of the recruitment process for filling both of the vacant positions.\n\nWe will keep you informed about progress with the procedure.'\n\nTwice Expropriated: Poland and Spain misrepresent 'restitution' of two paintings\n\n4 February 2023: Last week, AP together with various other news agencies and outlets reported the apparent 'good news story' that Spain had ‘returned' to Poland two Nazi looted paintings seized in Warsaw in 1941.\n\nThe paintings, a diptych attributed to the 15th century Flemish painter Dieric Bouts, Mater Dolorosa and Ecce Homo, had been located in the Pontevedra Museum in Galicia which acquired them in 1994 from a Spanish private collector. The first documented reappearance of the paintings after the war had been on the Madrid art market in in 1973 when they were acquired by the private collector.\n\nIn 2020 Polish officials made a claim for the paintings and the museum decided to send them back to Poland. This took place once the Spanish government issued the export permits.\n\nThe slightest effort to check the story would have shown that the paintings do not belong to Poland but to the Czartoryski family whose entire Gołuchów collection was seized by the Nazis in 1941. The seizure of the collection was famously described and given as an example of Nazi art plunder by the American prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trials in 1945-6 where art looting was prosecuted as a war crime.\n\nThere could have been no doubt in Spain or Poland about the rightful ownership of the paintings which are published by the Polish government’s Ministry of Culture and National Heritage both in volumes of wartime losses and in their online database as owned by the Czartoryski family collection of Gołuchów.\n\nChecking the story would also have shown that the Polish government’s claim for the paintings was in contravention of the rights of the family, the rightful owners, whose agreement was never sought by Poland. On the contrary, the family were forced to seek the support of other European governments and make a counter-claim to prevent this second expropriation of their paintings.\n\nHowever, Spain, like Poland, decided to ignore the family’s ownership rights, as well as the Washington Principles which require Nazi looted artworks to be returned to their individual owners, and agreed to ‘return’ the paintings to Poland. This ‘return’ contravenes both the Washington Principles and the Terezin Declaration as well as all other post-war commitments and laws. It is to be hoped that no other country or institution will enable the Polish government, whose attachment to the rule of law is notoriously fickle, to abrogate the rights of private individuals to seize their property and take it to Poland.\n\nThe rightful owners, whose legal challenge was ignored by the Spanish authorities, said: ‘It is sad to see that eighty years after the paintings were seized, the governments of both Spain and Poland show no regard for the rights of individuals'.\n\n1 February 2023: Chair and Deputy Chair of Dutch Restitutions Committee Resign\n\nJacob Kohnstamm, chair, and vice-chair Els Swaab have submitted their resignations to Gunay Uslu, the Dutch State Secretary for Culture and Media, 'due to an internal matter'. The State Secretary announced that Dick Oostinga, a lawyer and former notary, and a member of the Restitutions Committee since 2018, has been appointed Vice-Chair with immediate effect and will supervise the Commitee temporarily to 'enable the independent Restitutions Committee to continue its important work, to which the State Secretary attaches great importance, without interruption. The State Secretary is responsible for appointing committee members and she will initiate the process of selecting a new chair and a new committee member in the near future.' The State Secretary noted: 'The Restitutions Committee will do everything it can to continue to discharge its tasks in full. I would like to stress that the policy, as amended in 2021, will continue to serve unchanged as the Restitutions Committee’s guiding principle'. It was Jacob Kohnstamm who chaired the Evaluation Committee which created the amended policy and assessment framework in 2021.\n\nJanuary 2023: Newsletter no. 15 of the Network of European Restitution Committees\n\nThe latest Newsletter, produced by Germany's Advisory Commission, focuses on Switzerland with four special articles: a report on the Schweizerischer Arbeitskreis Provenienzforschung (Provenance Research Association) set up in 2020 and its two sets of guidelines for provenance research published at https:// www.museums.ch/publikationen/standards/; information about a new research project at Zurich's Swiss Institute for Art Research on 'Players in the Swiss Art Trade' to be published in 2026; an Interim Report on the Round Table on the Evaluation of Bührle Collection Provenance Research; and an article 'Taking fair and just decisions based on findings leading to an incomplete or uncertain state of evidence: The decision of the Kunstmuseum Bern in the restitution claim asserted by the heirs of Dr. Ismar Littmann'\n\nThe body of the Newsletter has extensive other news and information, including news of five Austrian restitutions (with case studies) and of two Dutch restitutions (to the heirs of Johanna Margaretha Stern-Lippmann and of Emma Budge); this year's programme of seminars at Paris's Institut national d‘histoire de l‘art (INHA), news of the forthcoming important Lost Lift database showing confiscations and auctions of Jewish property at the ports of Bremen and Hamburg which will be online in spring in German only initially; details of another German government funded restitution practice project, this one at Frankfurt's Europa Universitát Viadrina, to investigate the restitution principles practised in the post-war period and their afterlife in today's German Guidelines with the aim of 'providing fresh impetus for how restitution procedures can be handled in future' and 'to systematically record current uncertainties in applying the verification guidelines and to analyse historical case law concerning reimbursement issues ..in order to produce a commentary on the Guidelines'; and a report on the April 2022 symposium “The spoliation of musical instruments in Europe, 1933-1945”.\n\nTo read the Newsletter, please see here.\n\n8 January 2023: Free and searchable records of all immigration to Palestine/Israel from 1919 till today now online\n\nThe 1.7 million records were made available to MyHeritage by the Israel State Archives and include all surviving records of all those who immigrated to Palestine and, from 1948, to Israel by ships and planes from all over the world from 1919 onwards. All the records were scanned and a searchable index created. The collection is available for all to search and view for free; there is no obligation to sign up to MyHeritage.\n\nThe records include the name of the immigrant and the names of relatives who immigrated with them, country of origin, the name of the ship they arrived on, the date of arrival, names of parents, names of relatives who were expecting them in Palestine/Israel, and their destination city. The records also include the arrival of tourists, or the return of Palestine/Israeli residents from a trip abroad. Pedestrian arrivals are also listed, i.e. those who came in through border crossings in the north or south.\n\nAlthough most of the data in the collection is in Hebrew, MyHeritage’s Global Name Translation Technology™ allows the collection to be searched in English and other languages.

Their press release records that '2023 marks the 25th anniversary of the Washington Principles – an international agreement that opened a new era of transparency with respect to art lost or stolen during the Nazi period between 1933 and 1945. Throughout the year, Christie’s Restitution Department will honour this landmark moment with Reflecting on Restitution, a global programme of events. During 2023, scholars, legal experts, researchers and interested parties will meet in Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna, Berlin, London, New York as well as throughout the United States, and Tel Aviv, to share and discuss important stories, ideas and perspectives.\n\nChristie’s Reflecting on Restitution programme begins on 27 January, when visitors will be welcomed to an inaugural public exhibition by French contemporary artist Raphaël Denis, held at Christie’s galleries on Avenue Matigno, Paris. The exhibition will feature a series of installations that form an extremely precise fragmentary reconstitution of artworks lost to confiscation, looting, or forced sale by Jewish collectors in France. To mark the opening, Christie’s will host a panel discussion on the Washington Principles and on post-war restitution efforts, including presentations by leading experts David Zivie, Head of France’s Mission for Research and Restitution of Spoliated Cultural Property between 1933 and 1945, and art historian Emmanuelle Polack, together with Claire Gimpel Touchard, descendant of René Gimpel, Didier Schulmann, emeritus curator, and the artist Raphaël Denis.\n\nThroughout the year, global audiences will be invited to engage with the programme through other in-person opportunities as well as Christie’s dedicated website, featuring recordings of selected events, stories of important restitutions, as well as a virtual walking tour of historic sites throughout Berlin. For further details and the calendar of events, see here.\n\nWebsite of the French government 'Mission de recherche et de restitution des biens culturels spoliés entre 1933 et 1945'\n\nThe newly launched website of the French Ministry of Culture's Mission de recherche et de restitution des biens culturels spoliés entre 1933 et 1945 (Mission for the Research and Restitution of Cultural Property Spoliated between 1933 and 1945) contains extensive information about research and restitution of cultural property, documentation and other research tools in France at www.culture.gouv.fr/spoliations-restitutions-1933-1945.\n\nSections include Request for restitution or compensation, Looted cultural property, Cultural property MNR and Base Rose Valland (MNR-Jeu de Paume), Historical and legal documentation, Provenance research, tools and method, Museum and library professionals. Within each section are further defined areas explaining laws, process, procedures and definitions, and providing resources, databases, bibliographies, contacts and other valuable information.\n\nThe pages of the site are in French with automatic translation into English and German and other languages.

Correspondence with foreign museums and other archival records important for provenance research, such as acquisition files from the 1920s that are directly adjacent in time, were also processed and made searchable in detail. Records include those of the Department of Culture and the Mayor, and extend beyond the Rhineland. They show, for example, connections to the occupied territories of the Netherlands and France at the beginning of the 1940s. \"It is a milestone to now be able to search the Düsseldorf files for people, art market institutions, artworks, places, events such as auctions or even subject-specific keywords, independent of time and place. In many cases, they offer information that one would not necessarily have expected to find in the Düsseldorf files,\" said Jasmin Hartmann, head of the Coordination Office for Provenance Research in North Rhine Westphalia.\n\nThe overview of the files is accessible here and the keyword search is accessible here. For full details see here.\n\n30 November 2022: Belgian government announces two provenance research initiatives\n\nAt the launch of Geert Sels's book Kunst voor das Reich (Art for the Reich), Belgian Minister for Science Policy Thomas Dermine announced two initiatives. The first is an independent project by the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and the Technical University of Berlin with the Belgian State Archives who are working with the Museum of Fine Arts of Brussels to develop a methodology for provenance research in the museum's art collection.\n\nSeparately, Dermine is setting up a government-funded centre of expertise for provenance research. Its mission is to actively search for the provenance of works of art. This applies to both colonial looted art and Nazi looted art. The centre will be housed in the Royal Institute for Art Heritage in Brussels (KIK-IRPA).\n\nTerezin Declaration Conference, Czernin Palace, Prague, 2-4 November 2022\n\nAll statements, speeches and sessions at the Conference have now been published or are available on this site and on YouTube - links are on our Conference webpage here.\n\nAmbassador Robert Řehák, chair, in his Closing Statement recorded that while “the Terezín Declaration established both a goal and a benchmark that drew attention to the needs of survivors and encouraged governments to move forward. There is no doubt that much restitution and compensation work remains to be done in some countries and, with sufficient political will, can and must be done”.\n\nWith regard to looted art the statement said: \"The need for continued provenance research and the difficulty of matching looted art with original owners and heirs, as well as the reluctance of institutions and individual owners to surrender their holdings, has very much limited the implementation of the Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art which were reaffirmed and broadened in the Terezín Declaration and at this November 2022 Conference. States were urged to implement those Principles as well as to advocate for their adoption in general. Other forms of looted Jewish movable property including religious objects and cultural property have also not been adequately identified and efforts to return them to their communal or individual owners have often been blocked. These are important elements of Jewish heritage, and participants emphasized the need for urgent action to be taken to resolve this issue and to provide in rem restitution or compensation through a process that is expeditious, simple, transparent, and non-discriminatory”.\n\nAll statements, speeches and sessions at the Conference have now been published or are available on this site and on YouTube - links are on our Conference webpage here.\n\nVideos of all the discussion panels and national statements can also be found on the website of the conference: https://www.mzv.cz/terezindeclaration\n\n13 December 2022: Complaint of Schoeps et al v Sompo Holdings et al for Restitution and Unjust Enrichment of Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers'\n\nThe 98-page suit filed by the heirs of German Jewish banker Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy against Sompo Holdings et al in the Illinois District Court on 13 December is available here. The heirs claim that Mendelssohn-Bartholdy relinquished the painting in Berlin in 1934 as a result of Nazi persecution and that Sompo Holding’s corporate predecessor – the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company – acquired Sunflowers at auction in 1987 in reckless disregard of the Painting’s provenance, including Mendelssohn-Bartholdy’s forced sale of the painting in Nazi Germany in 1934.\n\n'70 Years of Holocaust Compensation and Restitution' international conference November 14-16, 2022 at Tel Aviv University now online.\n\nThe entire conference was recorded on video and the lectures are now available through the Goldstein-Goren Diaspora Research Center’s YouTube Channel here. The full programme of the event as well as the biographical notes of the conference’s participants are available here.\n\n15 December 2022: Complaint of Silver et al vs Basil and Elise Goulandris Foundation and the Metropolitan Museum\n\nThe suit was filed by the heirs of Hedwig Stern who was forced to flee Munich to California at the end of December 1936 and was barred by the Gestapo from taking her artworks with her which were then sold by Nazi appointed agents. One was a Van Gogh acquired by the Metropolitan Museum New York in January 1956 and subsequently sold by the Museum in May 1972 to Basil and Elise Goulandris. The complaint seeks restitution, injunctive relief, damages and punitive damages for recovery of personal property, restitution of unjust enrichment and conversion.

The report was completed in 2020 based on the archives of the KOMZA (Commission for the Gathering and Protection of Cultural Monuments and Antiquities) that were made accessible the previous year by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia.\n\nThe report is now being released in cooperation with the Croatian government and WJRO. It was originally scheduled to be released in 2020 but was delayed partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the 2020 earthquake in Zagreb. The Croatian Ministry of Culture has recently established an expert group on provenance research. A process for claims has yet to be established.\n\nFor full details and to read the report, please click here.\n\n29 September 2022: Newsletter no. 14 of the Network of European Restitution Committees on Nazi-Looted Art\n\nPublished this time by the German Advisory Commission, the editorial, 'Taking on Historical Responsibility', focuses on similar cases having given rise to divergent decisions at national and international level in relation to Fluchtgut, or flight assets. The authors note that \"there is still no generally accepted definition of the term\" and \"the question of how to deal with “flight assets” remains extremely controversial to this day... even where cases are supposedly of a similar nature, it has not yet been possible to elaborate criteria for establishing comparability\". Nor do the 1999 German Guidelines mention the conditions under which such a legal transaction is to be considered the result of Nazi persecution. Hence \"it is regularly up for discussion as to whether the causal connection between persecution and sale is sufficient to justify restitution – whether or not an item was sold as a result of economic hardship caused by forced emigration, for example.\" The authors' view is that the focus on the economic situation of the seller is \"morally dubious\". They conclude:\n\n\"The term “flight assets” invites us to take a more fundamental perspective: where does National Socialist persecution begin and where does it end? Didn’t such persecution also have a broader impact, not just across borders but also over the years? But does this make the search for a transnational, European consensus in dealing with persecution more plausible? Wouldn’t this suggest comparability at the price of historical accuracy? Different countries had starkly differing roles to play with regard to National Socialism – first and foremost Germany, of course. The fact that the various countries today respond in different ways here does not seem to be a violation of a postulate of equality: it is simply the taking on of historical responsibility, something which may vary according to place and time. This can hardly be reflected in a set of Europe-wide rules.\n\nBy restituting cultural property, we address the past, but even more the present: we are seeking to make a difference today. Our aim is to admit to those who were persecuted that traumatisation can continue for generations, and that for this reason, healing may be called for generations later, too. We are endeavouring to be a society that deals with the past differently than used to be the case.\"\n\nThe wider contents of the Newsletter include information on new research resources and publications, recent decisions in the Netherlands and elsewhere, recent restitutions, case studies, reports on conferences, on the use of language in dealing with Nazi-looted art, on the Max Ginsberg Collection research project, on the OFP (Oberfinanzpräsident) Berlin-Brandenburg Project on the 42,000 files of the Nazi Vermögensverwertungsstelle(Property Liquidation Office), each on a victim of the Nazis. The files document how the Nazi state liquidated confiscated property for the profit of the state treasury and the project focuses on the art and cultural assets mentioned in the files.\n\nThe Newsletter includes much else from a range of countries.

The 35 members of the group include government, museum, art trade personnel, claimants and independent researchers. As an inclusive research group, they are interested in a variety of approaches: \"apart from applied provenance research and juridical restitution, we address memory, holocaust and genocide studies, and museological, curatorial and cultural heritage perspectives\". Its main goal is to organize lectures, expert meetings and discussions on a regular basis, about ongoing (PhD) research and other current issues. For full details, please click here.\n\n31 August 2022: Table of Paintings at the Kremsmünster Depot now online\n\nA table of the paintings recorded in the Reichskunstdepot Kremsmünster (\"K numbers\") is now available on the website of Leonhard Weidinger at https://leonhard.weidinger.wien/daten/kremsmuenster-gemaelde. The source of the information is BDA-Archiv, Restitutionsmaterialien, Kiste 13-4, Mappe 14 and the transcription of the list is supplemented with data such as origin, time and destination of removal, Iv numbers, Mü numbers, etc. Kremsmünster Benedictine Abbey in Upper Austria, founded in 777, was seized by order of the Gestapo "
