        "text": "People\n\nA\n\nAbbott, Robert\n\nRobert (Bob) A. Abbott was born in Houston, TX. on May 5, 1945. He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara. After experience on the 1101 Static RAM, in 1970 Abbot was assigned the task of designing the improved version of the 1102 (a custom product for Honeywell), the 1103, that became the industry's first commercially successful DRAM. He took the product as far as tape out after which it became the responsibility of John Reed. Later he designed the 2107, Intel's first 4096-bit DRAM.\n\nAdcock, Willis\n\n( November 25, 1922 - December 16, 2003)\n\nWillis Alfred Adcock was born in Canada. He immigrated to the United States in 1936 and became an American citizen in 1944. Dr. Adcock was an inventor, physicist, electrical engineer, and educator. Adcock graduated from Brown University with a degree in physical chemistry in 1948. He was recruited by Gordon Teal to work on silicon transistors at Texas Instruments in 1953 and was involved with TI's development of the portable transistor radio for Regency Radio, their supply of transistors to IBM and to the military for the Atlas and Minuteman missiles. Adcock hired Jack Kilby to work on miniaturized circuits and Jay Lathrop who developed photolithography techniques. He retired from TI at age 65 and served as a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Texas until 1993.\n\nAgusta, Ben\n\nBenjamin J. Agusta joined IBM in 1956 as a manufacturing engineer with an MSEE from MIT. He earned a PhD in electrical engineering from Syracuse University on an IBM scholarship and retuned to the company in 1964 where he joined the Components Division in East Fishkill, NY, under William Harding. Augusta promoted the concept of integrated circuit memory and designed IBM's first dedicated semiconductor memory chip, a 16-bit bipolar device for the System/360 Model 95, in 1965.\n\nAndrus, Jules\n\nFrom 1955 to 1957, Andrus worked with Walter L. Bond at Bell Labs on applying the photoengraving techniques used in making printed circuits to adapt photolithography to silicon processing. In this approach, photoactive chemicals called \"photoresists\" deposited on the silicon-dioxide surface layer are used in a photographic process to define precision openings in the layer through which impurities are diffused into the underlying silicon, thus establishing the required electrical properties there. Andrus was awarded a patent on this technique in 1964.\n\nAtalla, Martin M. (\"John\")\n\nBorn in Port Said, Egypt, Atalla earned master's and doctor's degrees in mechanical engineering at Purdue University, the latter in 1949, before beginning work at Bell Labs. There he did pioneering research on the silicon-dioxide layer, which serves as a protective coating on semiconductor silicon. This research led to the development in 1960 of the metal-oxide-semiconductor (or MOS) transistor with Dawon Kahng. The MOS transistor has since become the central active component of semiconductor memories and microprocessors; millions of them can be found on every microchip made today. After leaving Bell Labs, Atalla co-founded Hewlett-Packard Associates to provide the Hewlett-Packard Corporation with solid-state capabilities. In 1973 he founded his own company, the Atalla Corporation, to address the security requirements of banking and financial institutions.\n\nB\n\nBaker, Orville\n\nOrville Baker earned a BS in engineering physics in 1956 and joined IBM Federal Systems in Owego NY where he met Bob Noyce and Tom Bay of Fairchild on their mission to sell core driver transistors. In 1959 he moved to Fairchild R&D in Palo Alto, CA. Two years later he left to join the founders of Signetics as employee number 5. Baker adapted a discrete diode-transistor logic circuit he had worked on at IBM to a monolithic IC configuration that was introduced as the SE 100 series. He rose to the position of vice-president for technology and was a board member from 1965 to 1970 when he founded Signetics Memory Systems, later renamed Scientific Microsystems. He later worked for National Semiconductor on the COPS microcontroller products and joined Western Digital as vice president where he designed a Pascal microprocessor engine.\n\nBalletto, Jack\n\nJack Balletto received a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Santa Clara in 1967. He worked at Lockheed in electronic countermeasures and joined Fairchild Semiconductor in an MOS marketing role 1969. With two associates from Fairchild, Balletto co-founded Synertek, an MOS supplier to video game and PC vendors that was acquired by Honeywell in 1978. Mr. Balletto was a founder and the first CEO of VLSI Technology, Inc. He later worked in Hambrecht & Quist's (H&Q) venture capital group before forming the Sunrise Capital funds in 1996.\n\nBardeen, John\n\n( May 23, 1908 - January 30, 1991)\n\nBorn in Madison, WI, Bardeen is the only person to have won two Nobel Prizes in physics: in 1956, for the invention of the transistor at Bell Telephone Laboratories (shared with Walter Brattain and William Shockley); and in 1972, for a developing a fundamental theory of superconductivity (shared with Leon Cooper and J. Robert Schrieffer). Raised in Madison, Bardeen received two degrees in electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin before attending Princeton University, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1936. He taught physics at the University of Minnesota until 1941, leaving to work in naval ordnance during World War II. In 1945 he joined a new Bell Labs solid-state physics group led by Shockley. The following year he and Brattain invented the point-contact transistor. In 1951 Bardeen accepted a joint position as professor of electrical engineering and physics at the University of Illinois, Urbana. Intrigued by superconductivity since 1950, he began working seriously on a theory of this phenomenon with Cooper and Schrieffer in 1955. They published the successful \"BCS theory\" of superconductivity two years later. He spent the last four decades of his life at the University of Illinois in Urbana, IL, where he died in 1991.\n\nBeckman, Arnold O.\n\n( April 10, 1900 - May 18, 2004)\n\nBorn in Cullom, Illinois, Beckman received degrees in chemistry and chemical engineering from the University of Illinois before earning his doctorate in chemistry from California Institute of Technology in 1928. While a professor at Caltech, he developed a pH meter and spectrophotometer; he founded Beckman Instruments, Inc., in 1935 to make and sell these and other scientific instruments. Together with William Shockley in 1956, he founded the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in Mountain View, CA, as a division of Beckman Instruments. Beckman eventually invested over a million dollars of his company's capital in this venture, which never managed to realize a profit. After its best scientists and engineers departed en masse in 1957 to found the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, he gradually became disenchanted with Shockley and sold the struggling firm in 1960. For his scientific and business contributions, Beckman was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1989. In later years he turned to philanthropy, establishing the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation to support education and research.\n\nBennett, Thomas\n\nThomas H. Bennett was born in Mauston, Wisconsin and received a BSEE from Marquette University in 1960. He worked as a co-op student at Centralab, Milwaukee from 1957 to 1960 and on graduating joined the Automatic Electric Labs, division of GTE as a research staff engineer where he developed transistor and TTL IC-based computers for electrical utility & gas pipeline systems. From 1966 - 71 Bennett was manager of calculator development at Victor Comptometer. At Motorola Semiconductor Products Division in Phoenix from 1971 - 1978 he proposed, defined the basic system and internal architecture, and managed the design project for the 6800 MPU and variants. Known as the \"Father of the 6800,\" from 1978 - 2000 he consulted with universities, Motorola and other users on 6800 architecture and system implementations.\n\nBiard, J. R.\n\nJames R. Biard worked in the Semiconductor Research and Development Laboratory (SRDL) of Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX on GaAs varactor diodes used in X-band radar receivers. Together with Gary Pittman, in 1961 he discovered infrared light emission from a GaAs tunnel diode for which they received U.S. patent 3,293,513 for the GaAs infrared (IR) light-emitting diode, the first practical LED. In 1962, Texas Instruments announced the first commercial LED product (the SNX-100), which employed a pure GaAs crystal to emit a 900 nm light output. Dr. Biard served on the staff of Texas A&M University as an Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering beginning in 1980.\n\nBirkner, John\n\nJohn Birkner earned an MSEE from the University of Akron, OH in 1971 and worked for Goodyear Aerospace, Philco Ford, and Computer Automation before joining Monolithic Memories, Inc. in 1975. Together with H.T. Chua, he adapted the company's PROM technology to develop a form of programmable logic under the trade name PAL and created a simple PC-based assembler program (PALASM) design tool for users. With Chua and product engineer Andy Chan he founded Peer Research, later renamed QuickLogic Corporation, in 1988.\n\nBlank, Julius\n\nJulius Blank earned a BS in mechanical engineering from City College, New York in 1950. He joined Western Electric, Kearny, NY in 1952 to work as a machinist where he met toolmaker Eugene Kleiner. Blank and Kleiner were hired in 1956 by William Shockley to build transistor production capabilities at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories in Mountain View, CA. He left with seven others to found Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957 where he designed and built facilities. The last founder to depart, Blank left Fairchild in 1969 and consulted for several years before helping to start Xicor in 1978.\n\nBond, William L.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1957, Bond worked with Jules Andrus at Bell Labs on applying the photoengraving techniques used in making printed circuits to do photolithography in silicon processing. In this approach, photoactive chemicals called \"photoresists\" deposited on the silicon-dioxide surface layer are used in a photographic process to define precision openings in the layer through which impurities are diffused into the underlying silicon, thus establishing the required electrical properties there.\n\nBoone, Gary W.\n\nGary W. Boone was co-developer with Michael J. Cochran of the TMS1802 calculator chip in 1971, and, per a 1996 Texas Instruments press release, the inventor of the single-chip microcontroller. This was issued after the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office reversed a 1990 patent issued to Gilbert P. Hyatt. Mr. Boone moved to Litronix, Inc., of Cupertino CA in the early 1970s to work on calculator chip designs. In 1998 he commented the \"most minimal processor I know of was made at Litronix circa 1976, for use in digital watches. As I recall, this processor could only count, not even add. The architect was Steve McCrystal.\"\n\nBose, Jagdish Chandra\n\n( November 30, 1858 - November 23, 1937)\n\nJagdish Chandra Bose was born in Mymensingh (now in Bangladesh). He moved to England in 1880 where he earned a degree in Natural Science from Christ's College, Cambridge. On his return he lectured at Presidency College, Calcutta where, after 1894, he devoted himself to research in refraction, diffraction, polarization, and wireless telegraphy, with emphasis on the study of coherers (devices that detect radio waves). He also founded the Bose Institute at Calcutta, devoted mainly to the study of plants.\n\nBoysel, Lee\n\nLee Boysel earned an MSEE from the University of Michigan in 1963. He worked at IBM, McDonnell Aerospace Corporation, and Fairchild Semiconductor where he built some of the industry's highest density MOS LSI memory and CPU devices using a four-phase clocking scheme. He founded and served as president, CEO, and chairman of Four-Phase Systems, Inc. in 1969 to exploit the technology to produce low-cost distributed processing computer systems using in-house designed custom devices. Motorola purchased Four-Phase in 1982.\n\nBrattain, Walter Houser\n\n( February 10, 1902 - October 13, 1987)\n\nBorn in Amoy, China, to American parents, Brattain served as a physicist at Bell Telephone Laboratories from 1929 until 1967. After that he returned to teach at his alma mater Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA, where he died in 1987. Raised in Washington state, Brattain earned his M.S. degree in physics at the University of Oregon after attending Whitman and his Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota in 1928. At Bell Labs he worked first with Joseph Becker on the physics of copper-oxide rectifiers. After working on anti-submarine warfare during World War II, he returned to Bell Labs and in 1945 joined a solid-state physics group headed by William Shockley. In 1947 he invented the first transistor, called the point-contact transistor, with John Bardeen; they were awarded a patent on this breakthrough invention in 1952. Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley then shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics for the invention of the transistor.\n\nBraun, Karl Ferdinand\n\n( June 6, 1850 - April 20, 1918)\n\nFerdinand Braun never used his first name or first initial, the use of Karl is a recent affectation of historians. He studied at the Universities of Marburg and Berlin and graduated in 1872. He worked as an assistant at Würzburg University and in 1874 accepted a teaching appointment in Leipzig. Two years later he was appointed Extraordinary Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Marburg and in 1880 filled a similar post at Strasbourg University. Braun was made Professor of Physics at the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe in 1883 and joined the University of Tübingen in 1885. Ten years later he returned to Strasbourg as Principal of the Physics Institute. Braun's discovery of the point-contact diode and invention of what is called Braun's electrometer in Germany (a cathode-ray oscillograph) is overshadowed by his work on wireless telegraphy for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Guglielmo Marconi in 1909.\n\nBrokaw, Paul\n\nPaul Brokaw earned a BS in Physics from Oklahoma State University. He worked for Wells Surveys Inc, Arthur D. Little Inc., and Communication Technology Inc. In 1971 he joined Nova Devices, which became the semiconductor division of Analog Devices. As an Analog Fellow he designed a variety of products and holds upward of 100 U.S patents in areas including monolithic A/D and D/A converters, sensors, voltage references, amplifiers, power management circuits, and ASICs. He was selected in 1993 as \"Innovator of the Year\" by the readers of EDN magazine and elected to the Electronic Design Magazine \"Hall of Fame\" in 2002.\n\nBuehler, Ernest\n\nBuehler served as a technician under Gordon Teal at Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he implemented many of Teal's ideas on growing single crystals of silicon and germanium. Working with Teal and Morgan Sparks, Buehler grew and doped the germanium crystals from which the first truly successful junction transistors were fabricated in 1951. After Teal left for Texas Instruments, Inc., in 1952, Buehler remained with Bell Labs, working for other chemists including Henry Theurer.\n\nBuie, James L.\n\n( 1920 - September 25, 1988)\n\nJames (Jim) Buie earned a BSEE from the University of Southern California (USC) in 1949. In 1954 he joined Pacific Semiconductors, Inc. where he worked on high-speed discrete transistor switching circuits. In 1961 he designed a monolithic circuit with a multi-emitter input structure that he called transistor-coupled-transistor logic (TCTL), later known transistor transistor logic (TTL). Buie's prior art prevailed in a patent interference proceeding with Thomas Longo's work on TTL at Sylvania. Buie remained with the company as a senior scientist after it was acquired by the TRW Components Group in 1962 where contributed to processing innovations in dielectric isolation and triple-diffused bipolar devices and their applications to LSI multipliers and data conversion devices. He retired in 1971 and continued to work as a consultant until 1983.\n\nC\n\nCamenzind, Hans\n\nHans Camenzind earned a BSEE in Switzerland, joined Standard Telephone in Zurich as a junior engineer and on moving to the US earned an MSEE from Northeastern University Boston, MA. Following work at Transitron and Tyco Semiconductor (acquired by P. R. Mallory) he joined Signetics in 1968. He founded semicustom IC design house Interdesign, Inc. in 1970 that he sold to Ferranti (later GEC Plessey) in 1977 when he became responsible for the development of linear ICs at Array Design Inc. Designer of more than 100 standard, custom, and semicustom linear circuits, including the popular 555 timer for Signetics, and holder of 20 patents on linear ICs, Camenzind has written numerous articles and several books on circuit and system design.\n\nCastrucci, Paul\n\nPaul H. Castrucci was born in St. Johnsville, New York and joined IBM in1956 after earning a BS in physics from Union College, NY. He managed a semiconductor pilot production line in the Components Division, East Fishkill, NY facility where he worked with Ben Agusta to produce IBM's first 16-bit bipolar memory in 1965 and contributed to the development and production of the successor 64 and 128-bit devices. After managing the Burlington, VT, semiconductor plant Castrucci moved to SEMATECH, Austin, TX as Chief Operating Officer in 1988.\n\nCavlan, Napoleone\n\nBorn in Italy, Napoleone Cavlan earned a BSEE degree from Northeastern University, Boston, Ma. After brief stints with Fairchild and AMS in Silicon Valley, Cavlan jioned Signetics in the mid-1970's as a worldwide evangelist promoting the use of FPLA-based programmable logic products in place of standard logic IC's. Cavlan collaborated in 1975 with design engineer Ron Cline in the definition of Signetics 82S100 FPLA - the first commercially successful field programmable logic array including cascaded AND-OR gate arrays, both programmable. In 1978, he also introduced the first field programmable gate array - Signetics 82S103 FPGA - consisting of a single programmable NAND array. Later, in 1979, as manager of Advanced Products & Applications at Signetics, Cavlan developed and patented advanced programmable architectures in Signetics IFL (Integrated Fuse Logic) family, including registered FPLA's with dynamically reconfigurable flip-flops (FPLS) for optimizing either state machine or data flow-through designs. In 1985, he also patented Signetics PML (Programmable Macro Logic) family consisting of a core fold-back NAND array interconnecting a periphery of locally configurable functional blocks. Subsequently, Cavlan managed new PLD development for MMI and, after that company merged in 1987 with AMD, he joined National Semiconductor as Programmable Logic marketing manager.\n\nChan, Andy\n\nAndrew (Andy) K. Chan earned a BSEE in Electrical Engineering from Washington State University and an MSEC in Electrical Sciences from the University of New York, Stonybrook.

He was a recipient of three RCA Laboratories Outstanding Achievement Awards.\n\nN\n\nNagel, Laurence W.\n\nWhile earning his BS, MS, and PhD degrees at the University of California, Berkeley, Laurence W. Nagel developed the SPICE circuit simulation program with direction from his research adviser Donald Pederson. When released into the public domain in 1972 as SPICE 1, it launched a cottage industry of SPICE simulation tools. On graduating, Nagel began a 20 year career at Bell Laboratories which included developing the ADVICE circuit simulation program; designing analog circuits for submicron NMOS processes; and working in the AT&T Intellectual Property Division on assertion of patents and of patent licenses. He joined Anadigics, Inc. in 1995, where he worked on supporting simulation of RF integrated circuits. In 1998, Nagel founded his own company, Omega Enterprises, to offer consulting services in analog and RF integrated circuit design.\n\nNall, James R.\n\nWhile at the National Bureau of Standards/Harry Diamond Laboratories (also known as DOFL - Diamond Ordnance Fuse Laboratories), James R. Nall worked together with Jay Lathrop on the microminiaturization of solid-state circuits for the Department of Defense. In 1959 Nall joined Fairchild Semiconductor in Mountain View where he worked in the team led by Jay Last which developed the Micrologic family of planar integrated circuits. Based on his pioneering experience with photolithography at DOFL, Nall made important contributions to the project including significant improvements in the step and repeat control of mask alignment equipment. In 1962 he co-found Molectro with Fairchild colleague D. Spittlehouse.\n\nNarud, Jan A.\n\nJan A. Narud graduated with a PhD in electrical engineering and physics from Stanford University in 1954. He taught engineering physics at Harvard before moving to the IBM Research Labs at Yorktown Heights, NY for five years. In 1961 he was hired by Lester Hogan as Director of the Integrated Circuit Research & Development Department at the new Motorola Semiconductor Products Division in Phoenix, AZ. He established Motorola as a leader in Emitter Coupled Logic (ECL) circuits for high-speed computing applications. Narud joined the University of California to pursue semiconductor technology research in 1970. He retired in 1988.\n\nNewton, Richard A.\n\n( July 1, 1951 - January 2, 2007)\n\nA. Richard Newton was born in Melbourne, Australia where he received BS (1973) and MS (1975) degrees from the University of Melbourne. He worked with Donald Pederson, UC Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences, on an enhancing Larry Nagle's version of SPICE and he became a major force behind the project when he joined Pederson at Berkeley in 1975. He earned a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from Berkeley in 1978 and was appointed to the engineering faculty later that year. In 1985, he was promoted to full professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. Newton served as chair of the department from 1999 to 2000 and was dean of the College of Engineering and the Roy W. Carlson Professor of Engineering from 2000 until his death. In addition to his academic role, Newton played an active role in industry by helping to found a number of design technology companies including SDA Systems (now Cadence Design Systems), Synopsys, PIE Design Systems (now part of Cadence), Simplex Solutions and Crossbow.\n\nNorman, Robert\n\nRobert (Bob) Norman graduated from Oklahoma A&M University in 1954 with a BS in electronic engineering and math. In his undergraduate year he worked for the Sperry Gyroscope Advanced Weapon Systems Department on the application of transistors to computer design where he first conceived the idea of using transistors for memory storage. He joined the company full time in 1957. In 1959 Vic Grinich hired Norman to head up the device evaluation section at Fairchild Semiconductor in Mountain View, CA where he designed the DCTL circuit configuration for Fairchild Micrologic the first planar IC family. He co-founded two early MOS companies, General Microelectronics in 1963 and Nortec Electronics in 1968.\n\nNoyce, Robert\n\n( December 12, 1927 - June 3, 1990)\n\nRobert N. Noyce was born in Burlington, Iowa and grew up in Grinnell, Iowa. A physics major at Grinnell College, he graduated with a PhD in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1953. William Shockley hired him from Philco Corporation to work at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories in 1956. With eight other employees he left to found Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation in 1957. As general manager of the Fairchild semiconductor operation and a vice president of Fairchild Camera and Instrument, he presided over a decade of innovation in semiconductor technology including co-invention of the integrated circuit.
