The fourth child, Christiana Johanna was the first to be born at Kohlhohe so it would appear that the family settled at Kohlhohe about 1840.\n\nKohlhohe was a small village not far from Seckerwitz, possibly only about 2-3 miles from Profen, with the villages of Bersdorf and Gross Rossen between. The closeness of the villages allowed resident farmers to travel to their farms each day to work the rich agricultural land. Although the farms were of varying sizes, it is thought that Carl Samuel’s farm was one of the smaller properties. He later sold this to come to Australia.\n\nOn October 16th, 1830, Johanne Eleonore died and was buried at Kohlhohe leaving Carl with a family of 6 children — the eldest being 16 years of age. He remarried to Charlotte Schmidt, born November 28th, 1819, at Graben near Striegeu, Silesia; a small village not far from Kohlhohe. It would appear that Charlotte lived at Graben for some time and had a daughter, Ernestine Auguste Beate, who was six years of age at the time of her mother’s marriage to Carl.\n\nIn 1853, Carl decided to bring his family to Australia but before this was possible, he had to get a release from the Royal Prussian Government. The release document reads: “. . . and for the purpose of his emigration to Australia was granted discharge from the Society of Prussian Subjects. This discharge document however will cause the loss of being a Prussian Subject only to the persons especially therein and from the point of time of delivery.”\n\nBRESLAU. June 1st, 1853. Government Seal.\n\nCarl August, the eldest son, and Johanne Caroline, the eldest child were not mentioned on the release document. On May 17th, 1853, Carl August left Hamburg on the ship Wilhelmsburg and arrived in Melbourne on August 25th, 1853- Johanne Caroline arrived on the ship San Fransisco landing in Melbourne on September 1st, 1854. Carl August was only 17 years of age and if he had waited much longer, he would have turned of age to be conscripted into the Pmssian Army. This would be the reason for him coming to Australia before the rest of the family.\n\nLater that year, Carl Samuel and the rest of his family journeyed to Hamburg, Germany, where they boarded the ship Australia, which left on July 1st, 1853 and arrived in Melbourne on November 16th, 1853. Carl’s profession is shown on the passenger’s\n\nlist as a Landmann. The Australia was a vessel of 530 tons and carried 92 passengers, 82 of whom were second and third class passengers.\n\nOn arriving in Melbourne, they settled at Hawthorn in Weinberg Road, and within a few months of Carl’s arrival, he became naturalised; a necessary prerequisite for those wishing to own land. His naturalisation papers dated January 23rd, 1854, give his profession as a farmer. He lived at Hawthorn for 3-4 years until he purchased property in 1858 in Victoria (Bismark) Street, Doncaster, from his son-in-law Henry Finger. His name appeared on the first Electoral Roll for the Colony in 1856. AUMANN Karl; Upper Hawthorn, labourer — freehold- house and land.\n\nThere is no record of him buying land at Hawthorn or how long he actually lived there. Carl’s\n\nCarl Samuel Aumann’s Confirmation Certificate. Dated October 15th, 1821.\n\ndaughter, Caroline, had married Henry Finger in 1854 — the year after the family arrived in Melbourne.\n\nThe Doncaster land consisted of 14 acres, for which the sum of ninety seven pounds was paid. The purchase was made on September 1st, 1858 at a quarter to 12 o’clock in the forenoon. Carl Samuel lived there until his death on October 29th, 1882, and was buried in the Waldau Cemetery, Doncaster. Part of his land is now occupied by the present Lutheran Church Manse.\n\nCarl Samuel played an important part in the early Lutheran Church: some of the early services being held in his home before the first church was built. He was known among his friends as “Father” Aumann. The second Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Victoria was held on January 6th-7th, 1857, and he was numbered among the delegates. In I860, at a meeting held in his home, it was resolved to found a school and he was chosen with F. Meyer and Gottlieb Thiele to act as a school committee.\n\nBoth Carl and Charlotte were middle aged when they purchased the Doncaster land and their children ranged in age from 16 to 24 years. The eldest daughter was married and some of the family would have worked elsewhere, however those at home were old enough to assist their parents in the task of making a new home and clearing the thickly timbered land.\n\nTo conserve water, wells would have been sunk, and later, underground tanks dug to assure a plentiful supply of water for household purposes. Orchards were soon established, and vegetable gardens planted to supply fresh food for the family. Much work was done using the hand hoe and with all the family helping. Cereal crops were sown and harvested by hand, using a sickle to harvest the crop. Ploughing would have been done with a single furrowed plough drawn by a horse or bullock.\n\nPoultry was kept for eggs and a cow for milk and butter. The milk was set in large dishes for the cream to rise, which was then made into butter and both eggs and butter became an additional source of income for the family.\n\nCharlotte faced the forbidding task of cooking without any of the conveniences known to the present day housewife. She would have baked her own bread in an oven made especially for the purpose, and made Kuchen for special occasions. The killing of a pig meant Weiswurst and Leberwurst, and these sausages and hams were smoked above a fire which was kept smouldering on the floor of the smoke house. Some meats and vegetables were pickled and kept in storage for future use.\n\nWashing was a back breaking ordeal, with dirty clothes soaked in tubs, then washed by hand, boiled in huge boilers and hung out to dry. The home made soap ingredients included caustic soda\n\nand tallow. Making and mending clothes was all done by hand.\n\nOne by one, the family married and Carl and Charlotte were left on their own. After Carl’s death, Charlotte lived alone, but as she aged, some of her grandchildren visited and kept her company by spending their nights with her. She remained at her old home until her death on September 27th, 1908, at the age of almost 89 years. She was buried in the Box Hill cemetery.\n\nTheir eldest daughter, Johanne Caroline, married Carl Heinrich (Henry) Finger, an orchardist, and they lived first at Deepdene but later moved to their property in George Street (German Lane), Doncaster, and later again to North Balwyn. They had a family of four sons and five daughters.\n\nCarl August married Johanne Eleonore nee Hanke, and they lived on their orchard property in Doncaster Road, Doncaster — just east of the present Council Chambers. Their family consisted of two sons and six daughters.\n\nErnst August married Caroline Ernestine nee Hanke. Their home was on their orchard property in George Street, Doncaster East, on the westside of the Dehnert property. Their family consisted of nine sons and two daughters.\n\nChristiana Johanna married Rheinhold Traugott Dehnert, a successful pear grower. Their home was on their orchard property in George Street, Doncaster East, — off Dehnert Street and next door to Ernst August. They had a family of seven sons and three daughters. Rheinhold died at the age of 103 years.\n\nHeinrich Wilhelm (Harry) married Johanne Eleonore nee Baum. He did not follow his elder brothers as orchardists but took up land at Murtoa and became a successful farmer. In 1890 the farm was given 1st prize by the Agricultural Department for being the best developed farm in the Colony. Harry and Eleonore had a family of seven sons and eight daughters.\n\nThe youngest son, Wilhelm Heinrich (Bill), married Margaret nee Walshe and was a blacksmith in Banksia Street, Heidelberg, for most of his life. They had a family of five sons and one daughter.\n\nCarl Samuel’s step daughter, Ernestine Auguste Beate, married Johann Rosel, but she died at an early age on October 23rd, 1872, and was buried in the Waldau cemetery. They had a family of one son and four daughters. Three of these daughters died at an early age and two are buried in the Waldau cemetery.\n\nMany of Carl Samuel’s descendants are still found today throughout the City of Doncaster and Templestowe and the Aumann name is well known in the Murtoa district.\n\nIn remembering our ancestors, we should also remember and be inspired by their Christian faith and principles.\n\nCAJRL SAMUEL AUMANN\n\nThe undersigned royal government hereby certifies, that the freehold owner Carl Samuel Aumann from Upper Gutschdorff, district Striegau, together with his wife (the former Charlotte Schmidt) and the following children under his care:\n\n1. Ernst August, born on the 25th of November 1838\n\n2. Johanna Christiane, born on the 17th of March 1842\n\n3. Ernestine Auguste, born on the 12th of February 1845\n\n4.

They lived in country east of Jawor (Jauer), which has since been absorbed into Poland.\n\nCarl Samuel Aumann was born at Siekierzyce (Seckerwitz), about 2 miles out of Jawor. Johanne Caroline was born at Maciwjow (Profen) which is about a mile north of Seckerwitz. Charlotte was bom at Graben, near Strzegom (Striegan), about 5 miles south-east of Jawor. Another place name linked with our family history is Goczalkow (Kohlhohe), which is about 2 miles north of Strzegom. Ludoradz (Lederose) was the birth place of Johanna Eleonor and Ernestine Caroline Hanke, and is situated some miles east of Jawor. (see top right hand comer of map).\n\nMany Silesian farmers lived in the villages and travelled to work on their farms each day. When the writer visited the area in 1985, I was surprised to see the close proximity of the villages — 90% of which were destroyed during the second World War. The homes have since been rebuilt with two or three\n\nPhoto right: Gothic Town Hall — Wroclaw; Carefully rebuilt after the war having suffered much damage.\n\nHome of Caroline Aumann (Finger), Dittersdorf, Silesia, Prussia.

There were no buildings and public places of any age to be seen so that it was difficult to trace the exact location of the original houses.\n\nThe Church where my Uebergang ancestors worshipped is one of the few buildings remaining. This is Rogoznica (Gross Rosen), which has been\n\nrestored and there is another new church built not far away. Rogoznica is between Jawor and Strzegom. It was in this locality that the Germans built a large and ill famed concentration camp during the War. The camp stands today as a memorial to the many who suffered there.\n\nThe country is situated in the fertile agricultural plains of Lower Silesia between the Odra (Oder)\n\nMap of Southern Silesia, now Poland.\n\nRiver and the Sudety (Sudetic) Mountains, which once supported rich farmers on large farming properties, and of course, the poorer farm workers. Known as Garners, (Hausler) or Day Labourers (Tagelohners), they were among those forced to migrate. Crops today are probably much the same as when they left; wheat, oats and sugar beet.\n\nWhen visiting this area, I travelled from Wroclaw (Breslau) and passed through farming land which appeared to be in need of attention and fertiliser —\n\nland which would have undoubtedly been under heavy production in our ancestor’s time.\n\nThe terrain was flat to undulating, rising to mountains to the south. Admiring the scenery as I passed through the villages, I noticed ancient and beautiful trees which alone had withstood the wartime destruction and probably beautified this same countryside for our ancestors.\n\nEric Uebergang 1985\n\nHistoric Burghers houses in Wroclaw’s Market Place today.\n\nCARL SAMUEL AUMANN\n\nCertificate to Naturalize, under the Provisions of an Act of the Governor and Council, XI.

Five generations have worked in the fruit growing industry of the Doncaster districts, and if the Melbourne suburbs had not spread into the area, further generations would possibly have carried on the tradition with some families working the same land.\n\nDating back to man’s link with the Biblical apple, history continues to refer to the introduction of fruit across the ages. In the 3rd Century B.C, Cato identified seven varieties of apples and the oldest known variety was the Apple Api brought to Rome by Appius Claudius and grown for generations in France. Peaches grew wild in China and were grown in ancient Persia while early conquerors of Western Asia found pears, plums and cherries and introduced them to Europe.\n\nIn most communities the collection of wild plants and edible fruits went on for generations, the results being cherished through the Middle Ages in gardens of monasteries and noblemen. Later these plants were sometimes exchanged between countries as curiosities and grown experimentally in new environments.\n\nWhen settlement began in Australia, fruit trees were regularly introduced by the government and private settlers. Many emigrants brought young trees with them on the voyage, but lost some through the heat of the tropics. On taking up land, they learned by trial and error where their surviving plants could best be expected to succeed. Small homestead orchards appeared near country homesteads and primitive orchards and vineyards developed around the more densely populated areas.\n\nChief centres of development included the East and North-East of Melbourne, and Doncaster in particular, where the timbered land was hilly to undulating. The box and Stringy bark trees had first to be cleared. Depending on financial circumstances, this was either done by hand or those with enough money hired a man with a team of oxen.\n\nSpecial ploughs were invented with long pointed plough shares, which cut the roots left in the ground after clearing. These ploughs were long and single furrowed; often pulled by a pair of horses, work which wore out both man and beast.\n\nThe fruit trees were planted 20’ x 20’, cultivated in the centre and dug by hand around the trees. Later the ploughs were designed with the handles and hitch bar offset to allow the plough to run to one side. The horse walked clear of the trees and strong arms of the plough-man guided the plough under the trees. As years went by, the singled furrowed plough\n\nwas replaced by two furrows and occasionally three — these later to be pulled by a pair of horses.\n\nDisc ploughs were invented, including one which was an old T model Ford chassis with front and back wheel being steered independently by a man seated on the plough, allowing the discs to go right under the trees. This plough was improved on and manufactured under the name of “The Harvey Petty Plough”, being popular for many years.\n\nSleds were used to take fruit to the packing shed but were replaced by a “Jingle”; a cart with a pair of low wheels which made it easily accessible among the trees. These were also used for other jobs in the orchard.\n\nPests became more prevalent as the years went by and spraying was essential. This was done by hand and then by a pump set on a cart operated by one man while a second sprayed the trees. On a warm day, the energy of even the best pumper flagged and his fatigue resulted in his offsider calling for more spray. As time went on, a machine was invented by John Russell which was the first power sprayer in Australia and called the “Bave U”. This type of machine was used for some 40 years. The operator still had to drag the hose around the trees and if the horse was impatient, the sprayer was left with half a tree sprayed. This was particularly tiring work as the man spraying the trees was looking into the foliage while walking over ploughed ground, unable to see the big clods beneath his feet. As orchards enlarged, sprayers also became larger, and today orchards are sprayed by large blast pumps operated by one man on a tractor.\n\nWhen tractors first appeared to replace horses in orchards, they were iron wheeled — large and awkward, so that in some cases orchardists reverted to horses until the tractor was made to suit the orchard.\n\nIrrigation was done initially by carrying water by buckets until mechanical pumps arrived and the water was pumped to the top of the row of trees and run through tin pipes to each tree. On finishing the row, the pipes had then to be carried across to the next row of trees. Many forms of irrigation are now used, watering large areas in a short time.\n\nThe trees were pruned in winter and the sticks collected and burnt, but today, the disc ploughs turn the material back into the soil.\n\nFruit was taken to market by cart, through Kew and Richmond to Melbourne. The horses walked steadily with their driver often asleep and would reach the market early, in the morning. Covered wagons were then used until the advent of the motor tmcks. The first tmcks were covered like a wagon and were fitted\n\nBismark Street (Victoria Street), Doncaster, Victoria. 1895.\n\nOrchards, early 1900s Doncaster, Victoria.\n\nDoncaster Shoppingtown now stands in the foreground of this photograph.\n\nwith hard tyres, but later, pneumatic tyres allowed the fruit to be transported in a gentler and less damaging manner. Later again, the characteristic orchard truck was uncovered but built with high sides. The grower’s stands were designed for wagons. These stands became too limited once fruit yields increased and trucks replaced the smaller wagons.\n\nExtracts from an item in the Illustrated Australian News of July 5th, 1879, gives a description which applied equally well for the next half century:\n\n“ Our Illustration of the Victoria Market is a striking picture of real life to be witnessed every Saturday and on a somewhat more limited scale every Wednesday morning, by anyone sufficiently curious and\n\nTemplestowe Cool Stores, about 1928.\n\nPicking fruit on H.

One fell asleep while counting his money on the return journey, and was still sleeping soundly when his horse pulled in at the blacksmith’s shop. The blacksmith’s role was important in meeting the needs of orchardists and farmers, as horses were\n\nnecessary for all sorts of farm work and for transport. The early blacksmith would merely have had a fire, anvil and water barrel set up in the open where horses were shod and implements repaired. By the late 1880’s each locality had its own busy forge. Wagon wheels, tools, farm equipment, and in fact all ironware came to the smith for attention. The darkness of his forge allowed him to see the colour of the hot iron. Large bellows sent air hissing through the fire which glowed and spat and the ring of the heavy hammer on the anvil echoed around the countryside. Wagons, jinkers and drays took shape under his skilled hands — hands as tough as\n\nthe leather apron he wore for protection.\n\nThe blacksmith filled an important role in the community, being responsible for the manufacture and maintenance of orcharding and farming equipment and various forms of transport — coach building being included in his skills.\n\nAfter Major Mitchell’s party had gone through the Wimmera, the aborigines were terrified of their endless wheel tracks. They are recorded as having thought that the bullock prints were made by the European women.\n\nThe early settlers who followed in the path of those tracks came overland from South Australia in old German wagons drawn by four horses. These wagons with their heavy wooden wheels and a pole\n\nVictor and Ivy Aumann with their children, Shirley, Ron and Bruce. Box Hill, Victoria.\n\ninstead of shafts, transported the families and their goods to selections.\n\nBetween the late 1870’s and late 1920’s, bullock teams and draught horses were the main means of transportation in the Wimmera and the decision to choose between bullocks and horses was at first ruled by the financial position of the settler.\n\nEarly settlers hauled grain by horse and wagon to the nearest rail head, a journey which often took days. A 5 inch tyred wagon fully loaded with 80 bags of wheat would amount to 8 tons, plus the weight of the wagon. This was drawn by 8 horses comprising of 2 groups of 3, known as leaders, and 2 horses in the shafts, known as shafter horses. Some farmers owned only 2 1/2 -3” rimmed wagons and these lighter vehicles were drawn by 5 horses, 1 group of 3 as leaders and 2 in the shafts. Loads of baled wool amounted to 3-5 tons, including the weight of the wagon. Larger loads of wheat were drawn by 11 horses in groups of 3, with 2 shafters, and the total tonnage plus wagon was approximately 10-11 tons, with a tyre width of 6”.\n\nBefore 3 bushel bags (180 lbs) were in use, the standard weight was 4 bushels (240 lbs) and bags were generally loaded by hand. Three bushel bags were all sown and loaded with a bag loader fixed in a pivot securely attached to the side of the wagon. This was operated by being pulled by one horse which swung the bag of wheat over the side of the wagon to be caught on the shoulder of the driver or teamster and then placed in position.\n\nAllowing for good weather conditions, the average speed with horses would have been 3-4 miles per hour. The horses had no respite, as flour, groceries and other supplies were packed on the wagon for the return journey.\n\nBy the late 1920’s, motor trucks were to replace the patient, stout hearted animals to whom the settlers were so indebted.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Market, North Melbourne.\n\nMembers of the Aumann family would have had stands in this market for at least four generations.\n\nillustrations of Victorian History, Vol 11 — Markets.

She was the eldest child of Carl Samuel Aumann and Johanne Eleonore nee Sommer. Her parents lived at Kohlhohe, Silesia, and Caroline would have grown up in this village and been educated in Silesia.\n\nWhen her mother died she was fostered by Gottlieb Guder who lived at Dittersdorf not far from Kohlhohe.\n\nShe did not come to Australia with her family as her foster-parents objected at the time her father came. Dittersdorf was a village just north-east of Kohlhohe so she would have had a close relationship with her father, brothers and sister. It was a relationship that caused her to miss them when they migrated and a year later her foster-parents allowed her to migrate to Australia against their wishes and stated that she would receive no inheritance from them. She was accompanied to Australia in the care of friends. It may be presumed that Gottlieb Guder was a brother-in-law of Carl Samuel Aumann.\n\nWritten in the inside cover of a book given to Caroline:\n\nIn Remembrance from my very loved Foster-Father GOTTLIEB GUDER\n\nof Dittersdorf for Caroline Anmann 20years old.\n\n22nd May 1854.\n\nThis was just prior to when Caroline left to come to Australia on the ship San Fransisco which departed Hamburg on June 1st, 1854 only 9 days after her Foster-Father gave the book. The ship arrived in Melbourne on September 1st, 1854, 11 months after her father and family arrived.\n\nHer journey out was not a smooth trip as the ship struck a hurricane between South Africa and Australia, causing the main gallant mast, jib boom to be carried away. Also crippled the main mast and split the fore topsail, this happened on July 7th.\n\nCaroline met and married Carl Heinrich (Henry) Finger, born July 20th, 1831, son of Christian Benjamin Finger and Caroline Friedericke nee Rummler.\n\nShe was the first of the Aumann children to marry, and the wedding took place at the German Church, Melbourne, on October 16th, 1854, when Caroline was 20 years of age. The ceremony was conducted by Pastor Matthias Goethe and the witnesses were Wilhelm Finger and Auguste Finger.\n\nHenry was born at Schmiedeberg, Silesia, Prussia, and arrived in the Port Phillip district in 1830 with his parents and their other children. Their ship was the Pribislav which departed from Hamburg on August 9th, 1849, and arrived in Melbourne in February 1850.\n\nHenry worked on his father’s farm at Hawthorn until he was 21 years of age, when he undertook extra work and saved enough money to buy a horse and dray for wood cutting and carting. With money earned in this way, he purchased 10 acres of land at Deepdene, Victoria, (near the corner of Whitehorse and Burke Roads) where he built a two roomed cottage.\n\nThis is where Caroline and Henry began their married life, and also where their first seven children were born. Henry cleared the land, planted fruit trees and vegetables and later started a nursery for fruit trees. He was a successful grower and was particularly interested in water conservation.\n\nDrought, bushfires and strong winds caused damage to the orchard, so he moved to Waldau, Doncaster, where he found suitable soil and purchased 50 acres of land on the north side of Waldau lane (George Street) and east of Bismark Street (Victoria Street). He cleared this land and resumed farming and horticulture and built a house of bricks handmade from local clay.\n\nBy 1870 he had built a large brick house which stood for over a century, being demolished in 1974; at which time it was owned by the Rieschieck family who purchased portion of the land in 1920. The home had 10 rooms with verandahs, two rooms in the attic and a large cellar, surrounded by implement sheds, fruit packing shed, stables, a large barn (now rebuilt beside Schramms Cottage) and a brick smoke house. The bricks for the house were made from clay quarried from his land along Ruffeys Creek behind the house.\n\nThis is the house where the last two children were born. The family comprised of four sons and five daughters, the youngest son being William David, who was born February 3rd, 1874, and died on April 12th, 1875, and was buried in the Kew Cemetery, Victoria.\n\nHenry was badly hurt while demolishing an old house, and as a result of this injury combined with hard work, he died at the age of 53 years on December 3rd, 1884, and was buried in the Waldau Cemetery, Doncaster, Victoria. His grave is situated close to that of his father-in-law, Carl Samuel Aumann.\n\nCaroline spoke German all her life and only knew a few phrases of English. Living as she did in the close knit German community of Waldau there was little need to learn English. To help her when English speaking visitors arrived at her home she had several suitable English phrases listed on the back of the door. Thus she was able to greet visitors with “Good Morning”; “How are you”; “Come in” and so on.\n\nSometime later Caroline moved to a smaller house built up the hill at the back of the large\n\nfamily home. In later years her grand-daughter, Emily Fankhauser lived with her in this small house, to look after her and the housework. She was known to many as “Gros-mutter Finger”. She is remembered by a great grand-daughter as a tiny lady, always dressed in black — and who made good Kuchen.\n\nGreat grand-daughter, Sigrid Bogle’s Memories, recorded 1993:\n\n“When we were young, she lived in a small brick house above the home they all helped to build and where Willie Rieschieck used to live, we walked passed his home and up a small hill to this house, think it could have been only four rooms. One of her grand-daughters, Emily Fankhauser, daughter of George and Martha lived with her to look after her and the house. We used to visit them sometimes of a Sunday morning after Sunday School and while Mum and Dooey perhaps were at church. There was\n\nalways fresh Kuchen for us to eat, can still remember how good it tasted.\n\nThe house faced south and at the back was a verandah with a seat under it and it was always lovely to sit in the sun. I think there was a small piece of land between the house and wash house and toilet. I guess this area was bricked, someone had spent time laying them”.\n\nInscription on the headstone of Carl Heinrich Finger which stood in the Waldau Cemetery until vandals smashed the headstone during the 1939-43 war.\n\nHier ruhet bis zum Anferstehungsmorgen.\n\nCARL HEINRICH FINGER\n\nGeboren 20 Juli 1831 gestorben 3 Dezember 1884.\n\n“Ich weiss dass mein Erloser lebet und meine Augen wereden Ihn schanen ”\n\nHiob 19 v.25.\n\nLieder Vater ruhe wohl Du verschlafst viel Sorgen Bis dich einst erwecken wird Jenerfrohe Morgen\n\nThe old smoke house at Finger’s home, George Street, Doncaster, Victoria.\n\nKew Cemetery, Victoria.\n\nHenry and Caroline Finger’s home George Street, Doncaster, Victoria.

Ernst Ferdinand was only 14 years of age, when he planted two acres of young lemon trees, grown and nurtured by his father, and pioneered the growing of lemons in the Doncaster district.\n\nThe property was later divided between the brothers, Ernst Ferdinand and John Traugott. Caroline and Ferdinand stayed in the old home and John built a new home just west of the original building.\n\nWhen Ferdinand married, Caroline moved to the small house on the hill and Ferdinand stayed in the old home and raised his family there. Later\n\nFerdinand built “Tannanwald” at North Balwyn, and Caroline went to live with him and his family in the new home. It was here that she died, at the age of 88 years, on December 12th, 1921.

He then joined his father on the orchard and worked for various orchardists in the district. Later, he purchased land in King Street, East Doncaster (then Wilhelm Street).\n\nOn October 26th, 1876, Henry married at the Lutheran Church, Doncaster, to Maria Christina nee Schuhkraft, who was born on May 19th, 1856 at Camberwell, Victoria; the eldest child of Gottfried Freidrich Schuhkraft and Maria Theresa nee Fankhauser.\n\nGottfried Schuhkraft had come from Heilboun, Wurtemburg, Germany, in 1853 on the ship Mobile which departed Liverpool, England.

Her name appears on a school roll dated April, 1861. She was a sister to Anna who married Charles Aumann, and Theresa, who married Charles’ brother, August Adolph Aumann.\n\nHenry and Maria lived the early part of their married life at Hawthorn, where their first five children were born. The family moved to King Street, East Doncaster, where their other seven children were born. Henry built his own home, cleared the land and planted a well managed orchard, setting an example of efficiency to his sons.\n\nIt is believed that on one occasion, one of the family ran to Maria to say that one of the younger children had fallen into the dam. Although Maria could not swim, she was able to rescue the child, her petticoats keeping her afloat. However, she subsequently had a miscarriage and lost twins.\n\nAt this time, the Lutheran Church were not prepared to listen to the concerns of many members who objected to services being in German. Because of this, many families went elsewhere to church. Henry and his family set about looking for a church\n\nsimilar to their own, but in English. They tried the Church of England, Presbyterian and Wesleyan Methodist, where they felt comfortable and stayed.\n\nBefore Maria married, she worked as a nurse maid for J.J. Kitchens of Lever and Kitchens, the soap manufacturers, caring for their two children. During the time of her courtship, Henry had to walk to Box Hill to see her, as his parents could not spare a horse.\n\nIn 1902, Henry purchased 84 acres of land in Wantirna, where he developed an orchard and a home known as “The Pines” on the corner of Boronia Road and Bayswater Road. He later transferred 18 acres to Bert in 1905, 18 acres to Ern in 1908 and 21 acres to Alf in 1912, and some to Arthur Richard Pike. Bert, Henry and Fred also bought land. Herb later received 20 acres as wages and bought another 20 acres. Henry and his sons cleared virgin bush and planted orchards, owning between them a large section of Wantirna.\n\nHenry and Maria moved to a home in Mountain Highway, Bayswater, in 1919, with their two youngest daughters, Joe and his family took over the old orchard. Henry continued to help his sons until he was 80, often choosing to walk up from\n\nHenry and Maria Finger.\n\nBayswater. He worked steadily, maintaining the same pace as the boys working on Herb’s orchard. He and Herb both liked to stretch out on a form at lunchtime for a brief snooze.\n\nHenry was associated with the school committee at Wantirna when the school commenced in 1912 and also encouraged the establishment of the Bayswater Methodist Church. He was Superintendent of the Bayswater Sunday School for 24 years, ably assisted by his two daughters in teaching. He commenced a Sunday School Service in the State School at Wantirna and later donated a block of land on which he helped build the Wantirna Church.\n\nTwo of Henry and Maria’s children became clergymen, while another two, Henry and Herb served in the 1914-18 War.

She played the organ at Church and taught Sunday School, where her father was Superintendent for\n\nVictoria Beatrice Finger.\n\nmany years. She also taught music and her pupils excelled in exams.\n\nBeatrice looked after her parents for a few years before they died and during this time, took a course in English. Both she and her sister, May, always spoke and wrote well.\n\nDuring World War 1, she was Secretary of the Red Cross in her area and was involved with the Ringwood Children’s Hospital Auxiliary.\n\nShe also worked for the Leper Mission and for various avenues with the women of the Church.

Their Aunt, Christiane Winter, was midwife and 47 years of age at the time. She was a fine horsewoman, and six year old Herbert looked on with admiration as she came into the yard driving a big horse drawn dray. She tied the horse to the verandah post and went inside the house. She delivered the baby, then came out and untied the horse and whisked off home again.\n\nMay’s schooling started at East Doncaster State School, continued at Bayswater and at the age of 11 years, she became a pupil at the Wantirna State School which opened in 1912.\n\nAs a child, she remembers her grandmother Schuhkraft, who lived not far away on the corner of King and Victoria Streets, Doncaster. Her grandmother was blind and was cared for by Aunt Lydia (later Mrs Burnham, Rosebud). She also recalls visiting her Aunt Anna (Mrs Charles Aumann) and enjoyed her pea soup.\n\nShe also remembers walking to school at Bayswater, before the Wantirna School was opened, along a road massed with stones which were being broken up by men with mallets, and being passed on the same road by a bullock team.\n\nAfter leaving school, May served as the sewing and singing mistress for the younger grades. When Mr Sudgen, the headmaster, was away, May took the whole school — some of the children being her nieces and nephews.\n\nShe made and sold pickles and sauces for a while, then worked as bookkeeper for Normans,\n\nGrocers of Bayswater, for 17/4 years. After her mother died, she cared for an aged person in Croydon for some months.\n\nOn her 80th birthday, the family held a reunion, when 170 out of a possible 350 people attended. She lived in the home on Mountain Highway, Bayswater, until 1988, when she sold her home and moved to Selford Park, Wantirna. She is still living there today and is now 92 years of age.\n\nAlexander May Finger.\n\nGathering of the family at May Finger’s Ninetieth Birthday.

On April 15th, 1880, Emma was married by Pastor Schramm in the old Lutheran Church on Waldau hill, to Matthias Johann Heinrich Thiele. Henry was born on February 29th, 1857, at Doncaster, Victoria; the only surviving child of eight children born to Johann Gottfried Thiele and Anna Maria nee Goethe. Anna Maria was a sister to Pastor Goethe, the first Lutheran Pastor in Melbourne.\n\nHenry’s father, Johann Gottfried, owned property in Wilhelm Street (King Street), East Doncaster. This land was sold in I860, 15 acres to Johann Gottfried\n\nUebergang, a Prussian immigrant. The name Uebergang was to reappear in the Aumann family history. Gottfried Uebergang’s purchase of this land was in February I860, following his return from a trip to Prussia in 1859. Henry spent the early part of his life on this property and would also have been educated at Pastor Schramm’s school as his name appears on the roll of the first Lutheran School in Waldau, Doncaster.\n\nOn leaving school he went to Tanunda, South Australia, to serve a carpenter’s apprenticeship with J. Basedow Bau and Moebel Tischler of Tanunda, South Australia. Eventually, Henry took over his mother’s shop, having worked there following the completion of his apprenticeship. The shop stood just east of the present Council Chambers in Doncaster Road.\n\nEmma helped in the shop, as well as rearing their children. The couple had a family of seven sons and two daughters. One son, Friedrich Wilhelm, died on August 2.3rd, 1889 at the age of two years, and another son, Johann Adolph, died on August 25th, 1889 at the age of nine months. Of their two daughters, Martha Elizabeth, died at the age of 14 years on May 29th, 1896. All were buried in the Booroondara Cemetery, Kew, Victoria.\n\nHardware and kitchenware were sold on the lower level of’the shop, while the newer section stocked groceries and sweets on one side and haberdashery on the other. A large coffee grinder stood beside balance scales, at one end of the upstairs counter.\n\nEmma had grown up in German Lane, Waldau, in a typical German home where rules were strict. This influence reflected in the way she managed the shop, and her reputation for firmness caused troublesome children to avoid her. However, well behaved youngsters found her generous with sweets, and every new child was given a gift of lollies wrapped in a twisted paper cone.\n\nDuring busy times, Henry’s habit of calling “Shop Emma!” resulted in Emma being affectionately referred to by many as “Shop Emma” or “Mrs Shop Thiele”. This shop was demolished in the 1960’s.\n\nHenry took an active part in community life, being a member of the Doncaster Shire Council for 7 years, in which time he was President for a term.\n\nHe was librarian of the Athenaeum Library for a short time.

After clearing the land of timber which was carted to the wood market in Melbourne, August planted an orchard with his first income coming from strawberries. The first fruit trees planted were pears and later apples, cherries, peaches and lemons.\n\nOn June 12th, 1912 at the Lutheran Church, Doncaster, August married Anna Marie Elizabeth nee Rieschieck who was born on September 14th, 1884 at Tanunda, South Australia; the daughter of August Ferdinand Reinhold Rieschieck and Henriette Augustine nee Finger. August and Anna made their home on the property at East Doncaster.\n\nAnna had come from South Australia with her parents when they settled at Balwyn in 1901, where her father established an orchard in Greythorn Road Greythorn, Victoria.\n\nAugust and Anna had a family of two sons and three daughters, one son carried on the home property after his father.\n\nOver the years August became known as a good fruitgrower which he took great interest in all his life. He was a founding Director of the Orchardists Cool Stores established on Main Road, East Doncaster in 1914. This store at one stage was the largest cool storage in the Southern Hemisphere. He later built a Cool Store on his property in 1938.\n\nAugust and Anna retired into a new home in Doncaster Road, Doncaster, opposite the old shop which his parents and grandparents owned. His son, Robert, then took over the running of the orchard. The couple took great interest in the flower garden of the new home, August having great success in growing gladioli, dahlias and vegetables.\n\nThe family had a holiday house in Boneo Road, Rosebud where they enjoyed many holidays, including fishing with the Burnham family who were commercial fishermen and lived opposite the Thiele home.\n\nAugust and Anna were devout members of Trinity Lutheran Church, Doncaster where they took an active part in church life.\n\nAugust and Anna Thiele.
