Haas, a noted trial lawyer who enjoyed a long and distinguished career serving the people of Multnomah County and the state of Oregon in all three branches of government, died peacefully in his home surrounded by loved ones on Sept. 21, 2013. He was 80.\n\nHaas was born on Dec. 24, 1932, in Cape Girardeau, Mo. He called Oregon home beginning in 1958, when he came west to attend law school. After military service and undergraduate study at the University of Montana and South East Missouri State, Haas graduated with honors from Willamette University Law School in 1961. He was proud to be a 52-year member of the Oregon State Bar.\n\nHis occupation was trial lawyer; his avocation was public service. He was able to combine the two in a long and distinguished career serving and representing Multnomah County and the state of Oregon in all three branches of government as a legislator, district attorney and circuit court judge.\n\nHaas’s motivation to enter public service was a true desire to improve the lives of the people he represented. In 1974, as district attorney, his office created the first Rape Victim Advocate Program to ease the trauma and protect the dignity of rape victims as they assisted the prosecution of the accused. In 1975, he implemented the first Victim’s Assistance Program to require restitution and protect the rights of crime victims. In 1991, as circuit court judge, he started the S.T.O.P. Drug Court to recognize and minimize the impact of drug addiction in the administration of justice. These programs became models for the nation, and he went on to promote them nationally, speaking at legislative and judicial conferences in nearly every state and in Congress.\n\nHe was an invited guest of President Clinton in 1994 at the signing of the National Crime Bill at the White House. Haas was a proud Democrat and skilled politician who practiced his craft in a time when differences of opinion created opportunities for compromise and progress.\n\nAlong with his public service came public notoriety. Haas knew how to differentiate the two. He made appearances on “60 Minutes,” “The Phil Donahue Show” and Court TV and was covered by many local and national publications.\n\nFamous trial lawyer Gerry Spence tried a case in front of Judge Haas in 1987 that became the subject of Spence’s book, The Smoking Gun. Speaking of Haas, Spence said, “He was patient. He was a loving judge. He ruled with love not power. He created a court in which the atmosphere was one of caring and redemption. These are inadequate words I write for a great man who has made immeasurable contributions to my life over the years.”\n\nHaas is survived by his wife, Mary Lou, a daughter, three stepchildren and three grandchildren.\n\nRetired labor lawyer Monica A. Smith died Oct. 9, 2013, at the age of 62.\n\nShe was born March 16, 1951, in Tacoma, Wash., and grew up as the fifth of eight siblings. She graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor’s degree in English language and literature. Following college, Smith worked at a variety of jobs, including packing crabs in Alaska, waiting tables, keeping bees, counseling migrant workers and teaching English as a second language. She also studied Spanish and traveled extensively in Latin America.\n\nAn experience with a bad employer eventually convinced Smith to overcome her resistance to her father’s advice to become a lawyer. She graduated from Lewis & Clark Law School in 1982. Smith worked as a labor lawyer for 26 years, forming the firm of Smith, Gamson, Diamond & Olney. She had the opportunity to represent unions of all sizes and employees in a wide range of fields, including education employees, firefighters, state and county employees, stagehands, patternmakers and restaurant workers, as well as the Oregon AFL-CIO.\n\nAfter retiring from her practice of law in 2008, she continued to work for the Oregon Education Association, proudly supporting public education through the empowerment of education employees. Smith was a singer, gardener, swimmer and bicyclist. She was always active in her community, as a volunteer at Franklin High School, IRCO (the Immigration and Refugee Community Organization) and especially with the Willamette Valley Law Project, which supports the work of PCUN, the Northwest Farmworkers Union.\n\nSmith lived well with cancer for four years.

He received his law degree at the University of San Francisco Law School and was a member of the Order of the Coif.\n\nAfter passing the Oregon bar, Dooney worked as a deputy district attorney in Clatsop County and went on to establish his private law practice in Seaside, where he continued to practice law until the time of his death.\n\nDooney’s friends said he had a genuine interest in others and a sincere love of people, often remembering even the smallest details about their families, work or past conversations. He was a talented musician and an accomplished woodworker. He loved spending time in the woods and outdoors, especially on the family property in Jewell. A devout Catholic, he was a longtime member of the Knights of Columbus.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Lisa, their four children and six siblings.\n\nRoss Shepard, whose work helped establish a national model for public defender services, died on Oct. 22, 2013, at his home in Eugene of a sudden heart attack.

He was a graduate of the Columbus Academy in 1964, of Colgate University in 1968 and the Ohio State University College of Law in 1971. He married Betsy Kearns in 1970 and moved to Eugene, where their two sons were born. Their marriage ended in 2001, and he was engaged to be married on Nov. 27, 2013, to his longtime friend and fiance, Peggy Lazarus.\n\nShepard began his legal career as a VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) lawyer at Lane County Legal Aid in 1971. He then started a private law practice that provided legal services to many individuals and organizations. He was especially proud of helping to incorporate the Eugene Growers Market. In 1977, Shepard and Robert Larson started the first Lane County Public Defender Office in Eugene, to provide criminal defense for indigent clients.\n\nHe became the public defender in the early 1980s, and under his leadership, the office grew to become one of the largest law firms in Lane County and was recognized by the U.S. Department of Justice as a model public defender organization. Shepard was an original and founding member of the Oregon Criminal Defense Lawyers Association (OCDLA) in 1979. He served as president in the late 1980s and then as legislative representative for the association. He continued to support OCDLA efforts both locally and at the state level until his death.\n\nHe left his role as public defender in 2004 and continued his legal work as a consultant and senior associate for the Spangenberg Group, an organization that provided assistance to public defender offices throughout the country. He also served as director of defender legal services in 2004 for the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA) in Washington, D.C. Following his retirement, Shepard continued to lobby in Salem for indigent defense and to volunteer his time and expertise to many in need of legal assistance.\n\nShepard had many and varied interests throughout his life. He had a passion for rugby after joining the Ohio State University Rugby Club during his law school years. In Oregon, he was an original member of the Eugene Rugby Club.
