        "text": "Campbell, Rebecca\n\nÂ Â It becomes my duty to record the death of sister Rebecca Campbell.Â She departed this life in the eighty fourth year of her age.Â She joined the Methodist church in early life.Â About thirty years ago being taught the way of the lord more perfectly by one of our preaching brethren, she took her stand upon the Bible, which profession she adorned unblemished to the close of her life.Â I knew her well and am certain that she did not have an enemy on the earth.Â Her life was so exemplary that the wicked were ashamed, having no evil to speak of her.Â She was the mother of 11 children; seven of them passed into the spirit world before her, leaving four old gray headed sons to mourn her loss.Â But we sorrow not as those who have no hope, for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.Â May our last end be like hers.\n\nA. Kyle., Ioni, Anderson Co., Tex. July 18th 1877.\n\nGospel Advocate,Â August 2, 1877, page 474\n\nCarnes, Cynthia\n\nDear Brethren: - I write to inform your readers of the death of a much esteemed and beloved sister in the Lord--Cynthia Carnes.Â Sister C. was a daughter of our well known deceased Bro. Dr. Gowen, of Cannon county, Tenn., and consort of Bro. A. B. Carnes.Â She died last 23rd Feb., at her home near Woodbury.Â Sister C. had been for a considerable time in poor health, and was fully aware of the approach of the last enemy.Â Her sufferings during her illness were at times great, but she bore them with fortitude, saying, \"if it is right to wish it, I desire to be relieved from my sufferings, let the will of the Lord be done.\"Â One of her favorite passages was \"they that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be moved,\" and when friends were weeping around her she quoted the lines--\n\n\"To sleep in Jesus, blessed sleep,\n\nFrom which none ever wake to weep.\"\n\nÂ Â Sister C. had been a woman of prayer, daily, secret prayer, and when called to pass through the dark valley it was in prayer and faith that she entered its gloom, not fearing nor doubting.Â Her chief regret, she said, was that she had not done more for her Master in Heaven.\n\nÂ Â Sister C. had been for nearly thirty years in the church of God, having been immersed by Bro. Frederick E. Becton.\n\nÂ Â She often talked with her children about dying and her most fervent desire was that they might be trained for the skies, and so live as to lay up treasures in Heaven.Â For them chiefly she seemed desirous of living longer, but such was not the will of God.Â But though dead she can yet speak to them by the memory of her piety, her counsels and prayers.Â Thanks be to God, his word declares that He is the God of all comfort.Â May that word which was the staff on which the wife and mother leaned in the journey to the tomb be the constant support of the husband and the children through all the pilgrimage of life.Â\n\nIn hope of eternal life, yours,\n\nJ.

M.Â\n\nÂ Â Dear Brethren: On the morning of the 4th of this month God sent down and took from me my darling wife.Â She was a good wife, indeed, and all who knew her well loved her.Â She was truly an example of purity and goodness, and if it was not for the sweet hope that I have in the future of meeting her in that land where God is, my grief, yes, agony, would be unbearable, but thanks be to God there will be a time when I can meet her in that happy land where there shall be no more parting.Â My wife loved your paper and seemed to welcome its weekly arrival with pleasure.Â May God bless you all and at last save us in heaven is my prayer.\n\nEd.

Carney., Greenbriar, Ala., May 13, 1877\n\nGospel Advocate,Â May 24, 1877, page 327\n\nCarruth, Walter\n\nWalter Carruth was born in March 1812 and died Sept. 12th 1874.Â He was the last of four brothers to leave this earth.Â He was identified with the reformation at an early day, and lived a faithful Christian until the Heavenly Father called him home.\n\nÂ Â He was a quiet and unassuming man with kindness of heart unequaled.Â I doubt whether a more patient man has lived since Job.Â I have known him ever since I can remember and never saw him out of humor with any one.Â He has lived with his wife for near fifty years and never gave her a cross word.Â He ruled his house by love, and his children loved him.Â He had truly learned in whatever state he was to be content.Â He never murmured at any thing.Â He was an active man--working hard to support his family.Â He could always find work to do.Â In his final sickness, which lasted nearly two weeks, he was quiet, never complaining of pain or fear.Â He loved the assembly of the saints and often rode several miles in the heat of Summer to be with them.Â He leaves his aged companion and a family of children behind who will feel his loss.Â Let them imitate his example and meet him in the land beyond the river of death.\n\nR. C. Horn., McKinney Texas Oct. 1875.\n\nGospel Advocate, October 22, 1874, page 1000\n\nCarver, Lizzie C.\n\nÂ Â Fell asleep in Jesus, our sister Lizzie C. Carver.\n\nÂ Â She was the daughter of James Yeargain, born Dec. 4th, 1835.Â At the age of sixteen, she embraced the religion of Jesus Christ, was translated into His Kingdom, and added to the church at McMinnville.Â She was married to Bro. P. Carver, Oct. 7th, 1857; and united, by letter, with the church at Silver Springs, in the summer of 1865.\n\nÂ Â She was a woman of no ordinary force of character; firm in her convictions of duty, and active in the discharge of all her obligations, whether to her God, family or friends.\n\nÂ Â We sincerely sorrow at the loss we have sustained.Â We sympathize with our brother in his bereavement, and our heart is especially touched, as we look upon the five motherless children, she left him, as pledges of her early and lasting love.Â May the recollection of Lizzie, be to him a green spot in memory's waste.\n\nÂ Â Having lived the life of a Christian, she died in the triumphs of the Christian's hope, after a short, but sharp illness, in which she showed great patience and arsignation, on the 22nd December, 1869.\n\nJ.

Carver, son of Mary A. W. and Archibald Carver, who crossed the Jordan of death more than half a score years ago, Bro. Jonas was born June the 29th, 1841.Â Departed this life November the 20th, 1879.Â Bro. Jonas, obeyed the Gospel under the preaching of old Bro. Sandy Jones, during the late war.Â He ever afterward lived a devoted life to the service of his Master.Â He has worshiped with the band of disciples at Corinth in Rutherford county, for several years.Â He was always at his post on Lord's day meetings as long as he was able to go.Â He was to the writer a brother in the flesh, and we might say a father, too, for such he was to us, for our parents died when we were quite small, and it fell to his lot to raise us.Â He gave us much good advice and tried to raise us \"in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,\" and we thank God that we fell into such hands.Â Bro. Jonas was a dear lover of his Bible, a book he studied much during his illness.Â He was a devoted husband and a kind parent.Â He was conscious of the fact some time before his death, that his stay on earth would be but a short time, his desire was to get his worldly affairs into such a shape that they would give as little trouble as possible to the one into whose hands it was left.Â He was not conscious of anything for several days before his death. He was highly esteemed by all who knew him.Â He leaves a vacancy in the church that cannot be filled by everyone.Â He leaves a bereaved wife and five children besides a host of friends and relatives to mourn his loss, but he fell asleep in Jesus, it is a consolation to us to know that he \"shall have a part in the first resurrection and those who have a part in the first resurrection will not be under the power of the second death.\"Â May God help the wife and sister to live a Christian life, and to teach her children to try and imitate the example of their father, and may he help many of us who knew him to try the same, is our prayer.\n\nS.

Casey, aged twenty-two years.Â The deceased was carried to an early grave by that fell destroyer consumption.Â One month before his death I buried him in baptism from which he arose to walk in a new life and to rejoice in hope of everlasting life.Â Oh, how full of comport are those words of Jesus our Savior, he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.Â Though we part here we shall meet again, is the consolation of the bereaved ones.Â As I live, you shall live, says Jesus.\n\nJ. A. Carter., Belles Station, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate,Â July 25, 1872, page 722\n\nCasey, Purlina J.\n\nÂ Â It is my painful duty to communicate to the living the death of Purlina J. Casey,Â a loving, kind and affectionate mother and sister in Christ, who fell asleep in Christ July 20th, 1879, in Lamar county, Texas, at her son-in-law's, John A. Wade.Â She was born Dec., 19th, 1812, in Davidson county, Tennessee.Â She was the daughter of W. N. and Mary Hamilton.Â At an early age, joined the Baptist church, and was in the division at the Antioch congregation in Davidson county, about the year 1831 under the ministry of Bro. Peyton Smith.Â Sister Casey was a true, brave, and valiant soldier in the great battle for glory, honor, immortality and eternal life; and she is now gone to wear the crown that is ever awarded to those who are faithful unto death.Â We would say to all, we have lost a true friend; to the church a faithful member, to her children devoted, to her neighbors kind and obliging.Â Sister Casey \"is not lost, but gone before.\"\n\nH. C. BoothÂ\n\nGospel Advocate,Â February 12, 1880, page 107\n\nCater, John J.\n\nÂ Â Bro. Lipscomb:Â The church at Boiling Springs, S. C. has lost one of its best members, John J. Cater,Â he had been identified with the reformation almost from its commencement in this State.Â He will be missed in the community in which he lived, for he was noted for his benevolence.Â He will be missed in the church of which he was a member, where his seat was always filled.Â He took a deep interest in the cause of education and religion in his own neighborhood, and was always ready to aid the cause of Christ by his counsel and his means.Â But he has gone to his rest.Â He died in the full hope of a resurrection to eternal life, on the 31st of October 1872.\n\nJ.

Cathey of inflammation of the brain after a painful illness of five days.\n\nÂ Â She died unconscious, not even recognizing her own children, who watched around her bed of affliction and death.Â She was for many years a devoted Christian and always a friend to those in distress.Â Being a widow her children, she said, were the only tie that bound her to this earthly tabernacle.Â She often said if she could but be spared to raise her children to the years of maturity she would be willing to go.Â Her desire was consummated.Â She has gone and we miss her.Â Â All seems dreary and desolate around the place where we spent our childhood; but when we think of her home by the side of the river of light it is a sweet consolation to us to know that we can meet her in that home where angels vie around the throne of God, and there will be no parting there, and where all is joy and peace forever.\n\nJ. B. Cathey., Duck River Tenn.Â May 14th, 1873.\n\nGospel Advocate, May 22, 1873, page 498.\n\nCathey, James\n\nBros. L. & S:Â It becomes my sad duty to record the death of our aged and highly esteemed brother, James Cathey.Â He died at his residence on Cathey's Creek in Maury County, Tenn., of Typhoid fever after an illness of 17 days, Oct. 5, 1874.Â Was born March 15th 1804, made the good confession over fifty years ago was baptized by a Bro. whose name was Abner Hill.Â This was in the early days of the reformation when those who obeyed their Savior in his ordinances were looked upon with contempt, and in this portion of the County were called by the odious name of schismatic.Â He was a devoted and consistent Christian from that day forward until he departed to be with Christ which for him is far better. Â Bro. Cathey's membership has been with the Church of God worshipping at this place known as the Cathey's Creek Congregation, during his Christian service.Â He leaves his second wife to mourn his departure, who is a kind hearted and devoted Christian lady.Â He left no children by his last wife.Â He leaves one son behind, the only member remaining of his family, who is a pious Christian gentleman.Â He has left only one grandchild, little Willie Stanfill. The son has lost a fond father, and little Willie a kind grand-father, his relatives and neighbors a kind associate, the County a valuable citizen, and the church one of its brightest ornaments, Bro. Cathey remarked to his friends who were attending his bedside during his illness, that he had no fears of death, and that the gloom of the grave presented no terrors to him; because he had lived in all good conscience before God, and that he had not wronged, cheated nor defrauded any one.Â He now sleeps in the old grave yard with his first companion, and the eleven children that God had given them.Â Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord they cease from their labors and their works do follow them.Â\n\nR.

Brents at Cross Roads in Bedford County in September 1866, since which time down to the day of his death which was on the 16th day of February 1873, he lived and walked according to the law of the Lord, spending much of his time in reading and meditating on the Sacred word.Â He only lived nine days after his attack of Pleuro Pneumonia.\n\nÂ Â The congregation at Cross Roads has lost a member that was good and true.Â He only visited the church a few times before he moved out of Bedford into Rutherford County where he lived to the day of his death.Â Â He leaves a pious wife and two orphan children they have raised, together with many friends who mourn their loss.\n\nÂ Â He now sleeps at Millersburg, the place of his choice to await the last trump.\n\nSmith Bowlin., Millersburg Rutherford Co. Tenn. Sept. 18th 1873.\n\nGospel Advocate, October 9, 1873, page 980.\n\nCathey, Thomas Dickey\n\nÂ Â Thomas Dickey Cathey died at his residence in Maury County Tenn. June 16th 1872.Â He left no family never having married.Â He was born at Greenfield's station (an Indian Fort) near Hartsville Tenn., on the 14th of March 1796, prior to the admission of the State into the Union, and lived under the administration of every president our government has had since its organization.Â In early life he moved with his brothers into Maury County, and being placed under the instruction of the best teachers in those times he received a liberal education and excelled as a student, especially in the Latin and Greek languages, and moral and intellectual philosophy.Â His mind was of a logical cast and he had a pleasant vein of humor in his conversation that made him attractive in the social circle.Â He was modest and unaspiring, and often sacrificed his own for the good of others.Â He loved what is right and practiced it in his life.Â He confessed the Savior and was baptized by bro. J. M. Pickens at a meeting held on Cathey's Creek soon after the close of the late war.\n\nÂ Â He was an exemplary Christian, punctual in his attendance at the weekly meetings of the church.Â He was well versed in the facts and principles of the Bible, and took delight in meeting and worshipping with the brethren.Â It is the common voice of all that a good and worthy man has gone to his reward.Â As a hightoned member of Society, the community misses him, as a friend to humanity his neighbors miss him, as an exemplary Christian, the church misses him.Â But we are consoled and comforted with the thought that a pure and noble spirit has gone to the home of the redeemed in Heaven.\n\nA. B. C.\n\nGospel Advocate, August 29, 1872, page 804\n\nCayce, Emma\n\nÂ Â Died, on the 7th day of March 1872, at her father's residence, little Emma,Â the youngest daughter of George W. and Amanda Cayce, of Christian Co., Ky., in the 14th of her age.\n\nÂ Â It is seldom that we witness such patient and Christian fortitude, with the consoling evidences of unwavering confidence in God, as was presented by our little Sister Emma Cayce during the recent fatal spell of Typhoid Pneumonia with which she suffered.\n\nÂ Â Through many days of unremitting attention with watchful and painful anxiety by the family and friends in attendance she often gave the brightest manifestations of a heart rich with all the divine influences of Christian piety and faith in her divine Master, Him who has said, \"But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in his wings.\"\n\nÂ Â Every effort to check the prostrating and fatal tendencies of the disease, both by kind attention and medical treatment seemed unavailing and she died on the 23rd day from the commencement of her sickness, in the full triumph of faith, without a struggle - without dread, calm, conscious and tranquil.Â The grave presented no terror to her.Â NO! when the sad harbinger death came, she was ready and reconciled to the solemn dispensation of God's providence.\n\nÂ Â In view of approaching dissolution she admonished us that her time had come, called her aged mother to the bedside and with words of sublime resignation and sweet innocence told her, \"Ma, ma, your angel is gone.\"Â What a commentary and what a picture is exhibited by this little child of that solemn reality, death, that awaits those she has left behind.\n\nÂ Â Cut down in the young tender years of childhood, the budding springtide of life, she who but a short time since in the vigor of health, and gave evidence of such bright promise in the future, has left us.Â In her death, the church has lost an ornament and a pattern, society a favorite, and the family one of whom they were justly proud.\n\nJ. S. Grubbs\n\nGospel Advocate,Â April 4, 1872, page 337\n\nCayce, Martha\n\nDied in Franklin, on the 7th inst., at the residence of her son--G. W. Hicks--Mrs. Martha Cayce, consort of Wm. Cayce, Esq.\n\nÂ Â Calmly and sweetly as an infant lulled to sleep, sank my Mother to rest in the arms of that Savior whom for 30 years she had loved, trusted and served so faithfully, at 6 o'clock when all nature awakened and rejoiced in the bright beauties of early Spring, her favorite hour and season.\n\nÂ Â Angles thronged the portals of Heaven, and in softest cadences sang the glad anthems of the Redeemed.Â An angel lost on earth, but found in Heaven.Â Methinks the brightest of this celestial band is eager to bear back the pure spirit of a devoted wife, a true mother, a zealous Christian.\n\nÂ Â This Mother came a stranger to us seven little children in the fresh bloom of youth and beauty, and with all the firmness and gentleness which ever characterized her every word and act, she gathered us around her knee, saying:\n\nÂ Â \"I come to take the place of a mother.Â I court not the smiles, nor fear the frowns of society.Â Â I will do my duty.\"\n\nÂ And, Oh! how nobly and truly she filled that responsible mission, only the agonized hearts of the bereaved husband and children can tell.\n\nÂ Â Although for seven weeks she was unable to turn her head or move her feet, no murmur ever escaped her.\n\nÂ Â When her last hour drew near, and that sweet voice, ever filled with kind advice and wise counsel should be stilled forever in death, as her eye lingered upon her loved companion, on whose bowed head the frost of many winters rested, sacred tears rolled down her pallid cheeks.Â But no shadow could darken that Heaven-illumed countenance.Â With a last look of love she closed her eyes to open them beyond this vale of tears, where parting will be no more.\n\nÂ Â Oh! What a beautiful exhortation, to see a Christian die thus!\n\nM. A. Hicks.\n\nGospel Advocate, May 5, 1870, page 421.\n\nChamberlain, Elizabeth J.\n\nÂ Â Departed this life, at her residence in Maury county, Sister Elizabeth J., wife of Bro. Lafayette Chamberlain, and daughter of James Johnson, April 14th, 1870, aged about thirty years.\n\nÂ Â Sister Chamberlain was a devoted member of the Church of Christ for about twelve years, and died in the triumphs of a living faith.Â She has thus passed over the dark river, leaving her husband, five children, and many friends weeping on the shore. To them we would say: Sorrow not as those who have no hope, but follow her example in faithfully serving the Lord, that you may meet her where parting is no more.\n\nE. G. S.\n\nGospel Advocate,Â May 5, 1870, page 421\n\nChamblin, Martha A.\n\nMartha A. Chamblin, wife of John C. Chamblin, departed this life on the 11th of March 1858, in the 37th year of her age, after a painful illness of five days.Â She obeyed the Gospel in 1836 in the State of Missouri, was immersed by Bro. Wilks.Â She moved thence to the State of Tennessee, and thence to Chatooga county, Ga.Â She lived an exemplary Christian life, and has left an affectionate husband and ten children to mourn her irreparable loss.\n\nA. Chamblin.\n\nGospel Advocate, August 1858, page 255.\n\nChapline, Isaac\n\nAnother pioneer has fallen.Â Died at his residence in Hart Co. Ky. in the 81st year of his age on Apr. 4, our venerable and beloved bro. Isaac Chapline.Â Bro. Chapline was born and raised in the upper part of Ky.Â He had just commenced preaching in the Baptist church, at the beginning of the reformation by Bro. Campbell and others.Â Being the first to see the light he laid down the traditions of his fathers, and boldly and defiantly took up the cross of his blessed redeemer, and went forward preaching the Gospel to his dying countrymen with zeal and fervor, characteristic only of the faithful servants of our blessed Master.Â The furious storms and raging persecutions peculiar to that time, only imparted Christian valor and courage to his buoyant spirit.Â Many embraced the Gospel through the instrumentality of his preaching.Â \"They that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars.\"Â Bro. Chapline was an invalid for the last fifty years of his life.Â For twenty-five years before his death, his afflictions were so great and so incessant as to disqualify him for preaching.Â Still he entreated his brethren not to forsake the assembling of themselves on the first day of the week to attend to the institutions of the Lord's house.\n\nÂ Â He disfellowshipped alike all human inventions of men for the perfecting the saints, or the conversion of the world, implicitly relying on the word of God as an all-sufficient rule of faith and practice for the subjects of his kingdom.Â It is needless to state how he met the grim monster of death, having lived a Christian life, he died a Christian's death.Â Having put on the whole armor of God in the morning of life, he only laid it by in his dissolution.Â For months before he died he prayed to his heavenly Father to take him home from this stricken world of sin, sorrow and affliction; to that rest which remaineth for the people of God.Â Though his sufferings were great in his last hours, still he bore them with Christian patience and resignation.Â Bro. Chapline leaves a devoted wife and eight surviving children to mourn his loss, and while he has left them no liberal patrimony of earth, he has left them an example, which if imitated will lead them to that inheritance that fadeth not away, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.Â May his family find comfort in the words of eternal life.\n\nÂ Â \"Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord for they rest from their labors and their works do follow them.\"\n\nC. W. Smith., Rowletts Hart Co. Ky. Apr. 19th, 1873.\n\nGospel Advocate, May 1, 1873, page 429.\n\nChapline, Virginia\n\nÂ Â Died, in the eighty-sixth year of her age, on Feb. 11th, 1881, at the residence of her son-in-law, A. L. Woodson, in Hart county, Ky., Virginia Chapline, widow of Isaac Chapline deceased.Â She was the daughter of Jack Woodson of Mercer county, Ky., and was born in same county, July 4th 1795.Â She was married in that county in 1812 to Isaac Chapline, and in 1815 they moved to Hart county, in which she spent the residue of her life.Â Sister Chapline with her husband in the primeval days of A. Campbell, Barton W. Stone and others, was amongst the first to throw off the yoke of human traditions and the innovations of Roman Catholicism and take her stand upon the Bible alone as an \"all-sufficient rule - the only infallible guide of faith and practice.\"Â And so firm and unwavering was her faith through life, that she remarked on her death-bed, \"I want it understood that I die a strong believer in the reformation.\"Â She was that caliber of intellect that made her apprehensive of evil.Â There seemed to be a proneness in her mind to dwell on the dark side of the pictures of life; but when laden with sorrow, trouble or grief, she fled to the bosom of her Savior for help, in whom she found an effectual antidote for all of the ills, sorrows and disappointments of life - reconciled with Christian complacency to the providence of God.Â She was \"easy to be entreated, ready to distribute to the necessity of the saints,\" or minister to the afflicted.Â After a long life well ripened with Christina graces, she fell asleep in the arms of her Savior.Â Then let her sons and daughters, relations and friends, with a firm faith and unfaltering step, emulate her saintly virtues, that when we shall have received our summons to enter the great charnel-house of death,\n\n\"We may gently draw the drapery of our couch around us,\n\nAs one who lieth down to peaceful slumbers.\"\n\nC.

John Chapman of Lynnville Giles Co Tenn.Â He died on the 12th inst. of heart disease, aged about 58 years, had been a member of the Church of Christ about twenty years.Â He left a wife and eight children besides a number of brethren, sisters and friends to mourn his loss.Â He bore his affliction with patience and fortitude, spoke often and freely of his departure to his friends, and especially to some of his own family who are out of Christ, admonishing them to turn to God.\n\nÂ Â The Congregation at Lynnville has lost one of its most zealous members, earnest workers and pious brothers.Â To his bereaved wife and children we say, grieve not as those who have no hope, he cannot come to you, but continue faithful in well doing until death, and you can go to him where parting is no more, where God will wipe away all tears, and grief is unknown.\n\nÂ Â So then brethren and sisters let us all so live and act that when we come to die, that we may die as did our brother, in the triumphs of a living faith, for it is sweet to die with Jesus nigh, the Rock of our salvation.\n\nH.

Charlton, of Davidson county, aged 30 years.Â The deceased had been a member of the Christian Church for several years, and left this world with entire resignation, fully in the faith of the gospel and in the hope of eternal life.Â She left a kind husband and five little children to mourn her departure, and who has sustained a loss that this life can never repair.\n\nR.\n\nÂ Â We should offer much violence to our views of propriety, were we to neglect adding a word in regard to our Sister Charlton.Â It was our privilege, with Bro. T., to instruct her in her school days--we witnessed her marriage with Dr. C., have intimately known her since, and were present at her funeral.Â A more frank and affectionate woman is seldom found, and as to her devotion to God, no one could be more sincere.Â We do most heartily sympathise with the afflicted husband and children, as well as with our Bro.

Lindsey, August 22, 1877, was baptized into Christ some time in August 1878.Â Bro. Chisholm was one of the best men we ever knew, strictly honest, industrious, and truthful; he had many friends; none knew him but to love him.Â We have no idea that he left an enemy on earth.Â He leaves a devoted, almost heart broken wife, and two little children, beside a large circle of relatives and friends, to mourn his untimely death.Â To his weeping widow I would say, cheer up dear sister, Johnson has only preceded you a little way to the grave, if you are faithful you will meet him beyond the rolling river, in the sweet by-and-by, where God will wipe all tears from your eyes.Â May we all cling closer to the cross of Christ that we may be ready, when death calls to go where hopes never wither, and hearts never bleed, is the prayer of your sister,\n\nM.

H. Wharton who baptized him into Christ, and through whose instrumentality under God he was led to appreciate the power of the gospel and its glorious promises - desired to be at rest with him.\n\nÂ Â He leaves behind a faithful wife of fifty-five years - children and grand-children to battle on through the storms of life, and strive to reach that haven of rest in reserve for the faithful.\n\nÂ Â Truly the end of the righteous is peace.\n\nC.

Wilkinson, with whom he lived most happily, for there was great congeniality between them.Â In 1887 he moved with his family to Williamson County, Tenn., near Hillsboro, having purchased a splendid farm from M. L. Bond.Â He was not long in gaining the confidence and friendship of almost the entire community - both white and black; and why so?Â Because he in all of his dealings was frank and honest, because he was neighborly and charitable; because he was liberal and enterprising; because he had a kind word and a helping hand to all that were in need and deserving of help.Â He united with the Leiper;'s Fork congregation in the fall of 1890 under the preaching of Bro. Elam, and his only regret was that he had not earlier in life entered into the church.Â But though a babe inChrist he tried faithfully to do his duty.Â We feel that Leiper's Fork congregation, and the community in which he lived has sustained a great loss, but to the heart-broken wife and children the loss is irreparable.Â He leaves a wife, five sons and one little daughter.Â May God comfort and sustain them by his grace.Â The very large number who attended the funeral services in Leiper's Fork church testify as to the esteem in which he was held by those who knew him best.Â Bro. Elam preached a comforting sermon, full of comfort to the bereaved and warning to the unconverted; and after a few brief words from Bro. Anderson, gentle hands, prompted by loving hearts laid his body away to rest in Leiper's Fork cemetery.\n\nE. B.

Cook lived to see all his children members of Christ's kingdom, and two of his sons preachers of the Gospel.Â He was ever ready to give counsel as an elder and rebuke the unruly and erring brother.Â Bro.

C. I. Dabney and meeting withÂ Bro.

Corbin requests me to write the obituary of his lamented wife, Mary E. who died in the city of Nashville, on the 6th inst., full of faith and in the hope of the glory of God.Â Â\n\nÂ Â Sister Corbin was born near Lexington, KY., in the year 1832, the eldest of five children of Eld. Jacob Creath, Jr.Â She was educated at Monticello Seminary, Illinois; was married to Wm. A. Corbin 1852, at Marion, Ala., where she spent a large part of her married life.Â She was as near faultless as a Christian wife, mother, neighbor, friend, as any one I have ever known.Â Her's was the victory of faith which subjected an entire life to the will of God.Â She had a thorough acquaintance with the Bible, and was remarkably familiar with the throne of grace.\n\nÂ Â Her indefatigable labors in the church at Marion, Ala., so endeared her to the brethren, that when, in 1868, she was separated from them to find a home in Selma, the question upon the tongue of every disciple was \"what shall we do, or how shall we get along without Sister Corbin?\n\nÂ Â To the little church at Selma she was a ministering angel.Â They were without a leader either in the church of Sunday-school; but she urged Bro. Corbin to take up his cross and go forward in the capacity of leader and teacher of the little flock, and eternity only can reveal the full measure of good he accomplished there.\n\nÂ Â Again, be it spoken to her praise, when the little band of disciples at Selma were about to be turned out of doors, on account of an old debt which had become a lien upon their house, Sister C. urged her husband to canvass the city and country for money to pay off the indebtedness, which he consented to do, and in a few months they were relieved of embarrassment.\n\nÂ Â Many brethren in Kentucky and Tennessee have, I doubt not, preserved those eloquent letters which she wrote from her Southern home, appealing in them with language well calculated to melt the heart, for help in behalf of the noble poor who were struggling for life in the midst of vindictive foes.Â God grant that her example may be a living power upon this generation.Â She has left for her four children no silver nor gold, but she has left them untold wealth in that life which was all, all given to Jesus.\n\nÂ Â God bless the stricken family, and give them grace commensurate with their day of sorrow.\n\nJ.

H. and sister C. F. Curry, of this city.Â Sister Annie died of consumption, but endured her protracted illness with great patience.Â She was for a number of years a member of the church of Christ, and had endeavored to do her duty as a Christian, and died without fear of the consequences of death.Â So her bereaved parents, sisters and brothers are not left to grief alone.Â They have the bright and cheering hope of immortality and eternal life for her, to comfort them in their affliction.\n\nÂ Â Alas, how uncertain is life; how sure is death.Â But to those prepared, death is but a passport from a world of toil and uncertainty, to a home of endless peace and happiness.Â So farewell sister Annie, till we meet at the judgement seat of Christ.\n\nE.

S.\n\nGospel Advocate, July 10, 1873, page 645.\n\nCurry, Mary Josephine\n\nIt has been said the archerÂ deathÂ loves a shining mark, and it was never more fully verified than when the winged arrow from his drawn bow reached the heart of our gentle sister, Mary Josephine, the lovely and beloved daughter of our Brother John H. and Sister C. F. Curry of this city, on the morning of the 3d of November.\n\nÂ Â Possessed as she was of a well balanced mind, a cheerful and buoyant spirit, a heart without guile and full of human sympathy, she had attracted to herself many warm and sincere friends to whom she was strongly attached: to her eye, undimmed by sorrow, the world looked fair and beautiful, and if a cloud occasionally threw its shadow across her path, she looked up and saw it brightened with the silver bow of promise.Â Yet notwithstanding all that loving friends could minister, or the world could give, there was left an aching void in her soul that they could not fill, and a longing thirst in her spirit no water-brooks on earth could satisfy.\n\nÂ Â Happily for her, she turned to the living fountains of God's word; she read with diligence her Bible; she heard the apostle's teachings, and like Lydia of old, the Lord opened her heart, and she attended to the things they spoke, and was baptized.Â From that hour her whole being seemed to be changed; the love of God was shed abroad in her heart by the Holy Spirit given her; her countenance beamed with joy; she never grew weary in talking upon the subject of her reconciliation to God, her thoughts dwelt upon it and it was the theme of her conversation.Â Throughout the long, weary sickness that terminated her earthly trials, no murmur of complaint ever passed her lips; all was willing submission and patient waiting for her anxious departure; her hope entered within the vail and was fastened on the rock of ages.Â It was the anchor of her soul, sure and stedfast, and as the dew of death gathered on her brow, and its chill reached her heart, she fell into a gentle, quiet slumber, and at 8 o'clock the gates of Paradise were opened and angels bore her liberated spirit there to the \"REST\" of her Redeemer.Â\n\nW.\n\nGospel Advocate, November 18, 1869, page 1079\n\nCurtis, JohnÂ\n\nÂ Â It pleased God to remove from our midst on the 26th of July last, Brother John Curtis, aged about seventy-five years.Â Brother Curtis was for many years a member of the Christian Church, and until the time of his death was one of the Elders of the church.\n\nÂ Â It was the great desire of his life to learn his Master's will, and to perform the same, as well as to teach and enforce it to others by precept and example.Â In the death of Brother Curtis the church has lost an efficient and zealous Elder.\n\nÂ Â The cordial sympathy of the congregation is tendered to our aged and widowed sister in the Lord, and also to the children and relatives of the deceased.Â Although we mourn the departure of our beloved Brother, yet we do not mourn as those who have no hope.\n\nÂ Â Resolved, That the editors of the Gospel Advocate and Millennial Harbinger be requested to publish the above, done by consent of the church, on Lord's day, August 22, 1858.\n\nS.

Campbell.Â The deceased was only a little past sixty-four years of age.Â He was born near Ramelton, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1814, and came to this country in 1837.Â From the first he won for himself an honorable place in this community where he settled, and maintained it until his death.Â He served the community as teacher, banker and farmer, and always well.Â He was President of the National Bank of Franklin at the time of his death.Â For more than a year he had been confined to his room, and has been a sufferer from disease for several years.Â His death carries sadness throughout the large circle of his acquaintances and friends.Â The large and sympathizing attendance at his funeral testify the high regard in which he was held.Â He was universally esteemed as a good and useful citizen, a kind and benevolent friend, a fond father and most affectionate husband.Â He was once actively enlisted in the ranks of the Christian church in this place, and never lost his interest in its aim and welfare.Â He was an intelligent, cultivated gentleman, and well acquainted with the Christian Scriptures.Â Taken all in all he was a most remarkable man--a man of a hundred.Â His death leaves a sad vacancy in our midst.Â He is mourned by this community, his host of personal friends, his affectionate kins-people, two deeply distressed brothers, a family of dutiful children, and a devoted Christian wife.Â May she with her beloved children, find grace of the Lord to comfort them in this most trying sorrow, and take this sore chastisement as the evidence of our Heavenly Father's adoption and love.--\n\nThis dear one form thy life is riven,\n\nTo draw thy heart from things of little worth,\n\nTo give it wings and lift it high as heaven,\n\nTo loose the chain which hold it to the earth.\n\nJ.

Huffman and Hoover.Â October the 3rd, 1875, and lived a true Christian.Â She had been a great sufferer for three years, but had borne her suffering with Christian fortitude.Â Her genial, cheerful, disposition had endeared her to many hearts.Â It was the writer's privilege to be with her at the last, and she died in full hope of immortal glory.Â She knew everything, and recognized all her friends, to the last moment.Â She called her husband, and mother, and shook them by the hand, bidding them \"good bye,\" asked them not to weep, smiled sweetly and said clearly twice, \"I'll soon be happy.\"Â To her bereaved friends, we would say; live right and you can see Maggie again in the \"bright forever.\"\n\nMary Aust., Gordonsville, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, November 6, 1879, page 711.\n\nCartwright, Ella Neece\n\nIt is with sadness that I write a short tribute to the memory of Mrs. Ella Neece Cartwright, who died very suddenly at her home, near Shelbyville, Tenn., on October 8, 1900, aged about thirty years.Â At the early age of thirteen years she became a member of the church of Christ, and lived a pure, noble, Christian life.Â Her lovely and modest disposition won for her many warm friends, who are deeply grieved that her life was ended just in the prime of her young womanhood.Â To her sorrowing father, mother, sisters, brother, and the bereaved husband I would say: Sorrow not as those who have no hope, but be comforted with the thought that your loved one has only gone on before, and is enjoying the bliss of a land where sorrow, suffering, and death are unknown.\n\nA Friend., Flat Creek, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, January 17, 1901, page 46.\n\nCarver, Mollie Holloway\n\nMollie Holloway was born Dec. 27th, 1867, married to John Carver in May, 1885, was baptized into Christ in September of the same year, and died of consumption July 26th, 1887.\n\nÂ Â She leaves a mother, husband and many friends to mourn her departure, and a little girl, less than two years old, who can never know a mother's love.Â She was a kind and obedient daughter, a faithful wife, a true friend and a devoted Christian.Â Those who knew her best loved her most.Â We rejoice to believe she has gone to a brighter world than this; a world where sickness can never come.Â \"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.\"Â\n\nÂ Â May the heavenly Father watch over and protect the motherless child, and may she be taught to love and respect the memory of her departed mother, and to walk in the ways of life, that she may meet her on the other shore.\n\nS.

Cayce in 1831, united with the church soon after marriage and was a consistent Christian until her death.Â I have known her for many years and can say with pleasure that I have known but few as faithful earnest Christians, always ready in word and deed to minister comfort to the weary.Â She lived to raise a large and useful family, most of them, however have preceded her to the better land; all that remain are members of the Church of Christ.Â Sister Cayce was a great lover of the Bible it was her daily companion, she drew rich lessons from it and taught it to those around her.Â She also thought a great deal of the Gospel Advocate sending it for many years to her children who were not living with her.Â She leaves a large circle of friends and relations to mourn her departure.Â But none will miss her like her aged companion.Â Cheer up then, fight on, the battle will soon be over and we will all soon meet on that beautiful shore where weeping and parting will be no more, forever to be with the Lord and our loved ones.\n\nV. M. Metcalfe., Hopkinsville, Ky.\n\nGospel Advocate, August 22, 1878, page 520.\n\nCayce, William\n\nDied at Cayce's Springs, Williamson county, Tenn., December 15th, 1878, Bro William Cayce aged 75 years and eight months.Â Bro. Cayce was born in Buckingham county, Virginia, but removed at a very early age with his parents to this State.Â He has resided near the place of his death for nearly his entire life.Â He was baptized in 1833 and for forty five years he held steadfastly to the faith.Â He was zealous in his study of the Scriptures, free and outspoken in his convictions and ready always to give a reason for the hope that was in him.Â When in health he was found in the assembly of the saints and in no case was ashamed of the Gospel.Â He was the father of Bros. A. and Eldred Cayce, the later a faithful preacher --and of sister Elizabeth Thompson, all earnestly serving in the kingdom of God.Â He leaves also a bereaved wife who was faithful to his latest hour.Â To all these he was devoted and true as husband and father.Â In his last years Bro. Cayce was sorely afflicted with disease but as its power grew on him, he developed a marvelous resignation.Â And when he felt death's approach he did not fear, but gave himself entirely over to the will of the Lord.Â He spoke of his dying as if it were only his departure on a pleasant journey, and breathed his last as gently as an infant slumbers.Â Thus one and another of the rear-guard of our old pioneers who stood the trial of faith so bravely in the stormy days of our persecution, are passing away, the last one will soon join the ranks of those glorious dead.Â Â May God raise up multitudes who shall keep the faith as worthily.\n\nJ.

Chambers, on Nov. 3, 1895.Â Sister Chambers' maiden name was Holman.Â She was married in 1866.Â She had been a faithful, conscientious member of the church of God for twenty-one years.Â It was my happy privilege to visit the family often, several years ago, when I first began to preach. It was truly a delightful Christian home, with a God-fearing Christian wife and mother.Â Her greatest anxiety was for her children, to see them as they grew old enough to obey the gospel.Â I baptized three of them.Â She lived long enough to know they had all obeyed the gospel.Â The two youngest obeyed during her last sickness; while she could not be present to witness it, it was a great comfort to her in her sickness to know they were all in the church.Â It is certainly a matter of rejoicing to any mother to know all her children are trying to go to heaven.Â Sister Chambers will be missed in her neighborhood, in the church at home, but greatest by the family at home.Â Her sister, who has lived with her ever since I knew the family, writes me: \"We all miss her, and it is no home without her; but we would not call her back.Â Our great desire is to be ready to meet her when the time shall come to go.\"Â 'Tis sweet to believe that there is a home where parting is not known, where trouble can never come, where we can meet our friends, our loved ones, and all the pure and good, and be forever with the Lord.Â May the Lord deal gently with their sorrowing children, their aunt, and the afflicted husband.Â Added to this bereavement, Brother Chambers has been sick for sometime.Â The Lord restore and comfort him.\n\nF.

Chambers with whom she lived supremely happy until her death.Â We sympathize with her bereaved husband and relatives, for they have lost one of earth's brightest jewels.Â We would gladly have kept her with us, but God in his glory and wisdom saw proper to call her away, for her mission on earth was fulfilled, and he has a work for her up there, though being plucked from our midst in the springtime of life.Â She wielded her influence among many friends; for she had nothing harsh, malignant, or vindictive in her nature, but she was tender and forgiving, she possessed all things requisite to a true woman.\n\nJ.

Cherry on April 14, 1878, and was baptized in October, 1881.Â Aunt Lillie's illness was of long duration, and she suffered intensely.Â She was a diligent student of the Bible, and tried to exemplify the religion of Christ in her life; she was ready and earnest in helping all in need within her reach; she was always ready to help in the sick room, and took pleasure in administering to the wants of the suffering; she was a paragon of neatness and taste, and was skillful in domestic affairs.Â She leaves a husband, two sons, and many relatives to mourn their loss.Â Farewell, dear aunt; we miss your gentle voice and your blessed presence, but we would not be so selfish as to wish you to leave your home of happiness for this world of sorrow, pain, and death.\n\nJavie Weaver.\n\nGospel Advocate, December 26, 1901, page 826.\n\nCody, Micheal\n\nBro. Micheal Cody, died at his home in this place Sunday morning November 10th.Â He was one of the oldest men among us, being born in Virginia in 1796.Â He had by reason of strength reached his four score years.Â He died in his eighty-third year.Â For thirty-five years he has been a member of the church of Christ.Â He was a quiet, undemonstrative man, speaking rather in deed than word but was a man of decided character.Â A faithful husband and father, a good citizen, a true friend, a consistent Christian.Â He left a deep impression on his community, his life stopped suddenly as a clock.Â The sun set on him in health--It rose on his lifeless form.Â But we felt he was ready.Â His own sorrow, but not as those who have no hope.\n\nJ.

Cole was born March 5, 1857, obeyed the Gospel about two years ago, fell asleep in Jesus at his widowed mother's near Daysville, Todd county, Ky., March 5, 1878.Â The funeral services were conducted by the writer in the presence of a good audience.Â I don't think I ever saw more sympathy manifested on any similar occasions, such was the high esteem in which he was held.Â He was an earnest, faithful disciple, as such he lived, and as such he died, and has gone to his reward.Â To the sorrowing family I would say live so that you may meet Bro. Wesley where the saints die no more.\n\nJ. W. Gant.\n\nGospel Advocate, May 9, 1878, page 297.\n\nCollins, Mollie\n\nMrs. Mollie Collins, wife of William L. Collins, a worthy and consistent member of the Church of God worshiping at Salem, Tenn., died of Consumption on 1st day of April 1877.Â She was baptized into Christ in the Fall of 1861, by that faithful evangelist, Jesse L. Sewell.\n\nÂ Â She manifested much patience during her sufferings and always expressed her willingness to depart and be with Christ, was perfectly resigned to death, and only regretted parting from her husband and children.Â She leaves six children.Â She was a good wife and kind mother.Â She tendered her children to the watch care of her husband, brethren, sisters and friends, and cherished the hope of meeting them in that bright world where \"sorrow and signing shall flee away.\"Â She leaves a mother, brothers and sisters to mourn her loss--but not without hope.Â \"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.Â For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.Â Â For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.Â Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.Â Wherefore comfort one another with these words.\" See 1 Thes. iv:14-18.\n\nGospel Advocate, May 17, 1877, page 311.\n\nCone, Victor Ordelia\n\nOn yesterday evening between one and two o'clock the last remains of Sister Victor Ordelia Cone, wife of E. B. Cone, were consigned to their lone grave home until the resurrection.Â She lived in North Alabama but was on a visit to her father and mother, Bro. Hiram Courtney and wife, of this county.Â I was called upon to be present and make some remarks.Â I did so, but think, just six years ago yesterday evening, she and her husband stood before me and I pronounced them husband and wife.Â How uncertain are human affairs!Â I will not attempt to tell of her virtues.Â Â A large concourse of relatives, old neighbors, brethren, sisters and friends spoke her worth in language mournful but easily understood.\n\nJ.

Conoley was born in Essex county, Va., in the month of February 1779, thus being at the time of his death nearly eighty-three years of age.Â He moved from Virginia to the State of Alabama in 1836.Â In 1839 he became a member of the church of Christ, joining the congregation of disciples at that time meeting in the town of Triana.Â Thus it will be seen that, for more than forty years, this noble old soldier of the cross has steadily fought under the banner of King Emmanuel; and it is the verdict of all who knew him, that he made a good fight.Â Â No man in the community in which he lived possessed a more enviable character for honesty, sobriety, integrity and industry.Â His word was as good as his bond, and, even in his old age, although the thrift of his earlier years had placed himabove want, he could not bear to eat the bread of idleness.Â His example, in fact, was one worthy of imitation by all.Â Although during his earthly pilgrimage, he was more sorely tried than falls to the lot of most men, yet with calm, Christian fortitude he faced all the envenomed shafts of relentless fate, and cast his heavy burdens down at the foot of the cross.Â And now at last he has gone to his reward.Â Respected by all who knew him, trusted by foes and friends alike, full of years, this honest, faithful old father in Israel has \"crossed over the river to rest under the shade of the trees.\"Â May he rest in peace.Â We tender to his bereaved family our sympathy in their great loss, but we feel sure their loss has been his eternal gain.Â\n\nJ.

Cotton after long continued sickness.Â His disease was not understood by any of the physicians.Â But as to the cause of his death it is a matter of the past, and \"in the midst of life we are in death.\"Â The great disposer of all events in removing from the community Bro. Cotton has caused a void in society which cannot be easily filled.Â As a neighbor Bro. Cotton was beloved by all who knew him.Â As a physician very skillful, as a member of the Church, he was zealous and charitable.Â As a friend he was ardent and sincere.Â He was a kind and affectionate husband.Â To the partner of his bosom the shock is truly afflicting.Â When the hour of departure came it was indeed a trying one with sister Cotton.Â The attachment between them was very great.Â They had lived long enough together for the tie of love to grow very strong.Â May the God of Israel be unto the afflicted family a father, friend and guide, and through his wise dispensations convert their sorrow into joy unspeakable and full of glory.Â Bro. Cotton well knew that his recovery was hopeless for some time before his death; and man never waited more patiently for the time when he would be made free from all his pains.Â He suffered almost constantly for more than one year.Â He was never heard to murmur, but at all times manifested the most perfect resignation to the divine will.\n\nT.

Couch was a good man in a true sense of the word, and was much beloved by all who knew him.Â He leaves a wife and four little children, an aged father and mother, besides five sisters and many friends and relatives to mourn his loss.Â But we all feel sure that our loss is his gain.Â May God in his infinite goodness and mercy help us all to live so that we can meet our dear brother in that home where there will be no parting.Â Where all can join with the redeemed of earth in songs of praise which will make glad the city of our God.Â\n\nR.

October__, after a lingering and painful illness, Mrs. Ida Crofton.Â About three or four years ago, sister Ida was united in marriage by me to Bro. Daniel Crofton.Â She was then about entering her 17th year--beautiful--lovely accomplished--she stood arrayed in her beauty before a large assembly of friends and neighbors who came to rejoice with her.Â About one year or less thereafter, it was my privilege to pronounce over her the holy sacred formula of Christian baptism, thus uniting her by faith and obedience to Christ--and a more happy earnest conversion I think I have never seen.Â So when the end came she was ready.Â She selected the hymns that she desired her friends to use at her burial.Â As I stood before that weeping audience my heart was filled with sadness and sorrow in thinking how soon human hopes are blasted forever.Â Oh! it was a sad scene.Â Very many of those who came together in the church last evening to mourn over her early departure, were there just a few years before to rejoice with her.Â But thank God with all our sorrow we \"sorrow not as those who have no hope.\"Â She leaves a father, mother, grand-mother and one sweet prattling boy, many friends to weep over this sad event.Â But surely we may truthfully say our loss is her gain.\n\nE.

Cullom, in the sixty-ninth year of his age.Â He over thirty years ago, obeyed the Gospel of Christ and united with the church, worshiping at Sam's Creek.Â He remained a member of this congregation until about the close of the war, then removed his membership to the South Harpeth congregation.Â He was a kind hearted true man, was always promptly at meeting when in reach;Â He always manifested his love for the cause of God, a willingness to do whatÂ he could for its advancement, and a fondness for those who loved and honored his Master.Â He never succeeded in amassing property, but was esteemed and loved by all who knew him as a good and true man.Â He sickened with pneumonia and died in a few days.\n\nÂ His wife, A. E. Cullom, four years his junior, and his partner and companion from youth, was attacked with the same disease while he was yet sick, and survived him but five days.Â She died on December 25th.Â She also had been a disciple of Christ for many years, and persevered in her fidelity to the end.Â The doubly bereaved family have our sympathies.\n\nD.

Wharton\n\nMany have been the occasions, in the history of the scarcely vanished scourge of Yellow Fever, among our neighboring cities and towns, for the sad recital of death; death of stranger and friend, of dear acquaintance and beloved relative.Â The subject of this sketch, our brother, in Christ, C. Wharton Currey, has added another name to the long list of victims, who have yielded up their lives to the messenger of death.Â About the first of August this year, he engaged in the noble effort to assist his suffering fellow-men, at Chattanooga, in their unequal conflict with the invisible pestilence, and by his services, as a valued prescriptionist in a leading drug-store, thus voluntarily met the foe in an encounter on its own battlefield and face to face.Â He stood manfully and courageously at his post for nearly three months seemingly unharmed in the midst of danger; but at last the fatal poison, as the venom of some malignant serpent, in its almost expiring throes, reached the citadel of his life and he was beyond the tender help of kind and experienced nurses or skillful physician, or any earthly friend.Â He died after eleven days sickness at ten o'clock P. M., October 31, 1878.Â He leaves a wife and two children to mourn.Â He was visited by his brother Henry, who thus bravely fulfilled a brother's part, remaining with him till death, without power to aid him.Â May the life and hope and death of this member of our brother John H. Currey's family be for the eternal good of those that remain, and so prove the wisdom and goodness of him who \"gave and hath taken away.\"\n\nW.\n\nGospel Advocate, November 14, 1878, page 713.\n\nCabaniss, Lucy Dodd New\n\nÂ Â Lucy Dodd New was born on July 4, 1836, near Elkton, Todd County, Ky.; was married to Dr. John N. Cabaniss on February 10, 1856.Â In 1885 she was baptized into Christ and lived a consistent Christian life until October 28, 1899, when she fell asleep in Jesus, and her spirit has gone to live with his in the Father's house of many mansions, where he has prepared a place for all those who love him.Â Most of her life was spent in and near New Providence, Tenn., where she was universally beloved and admired for her many noble traits of character.Â Sister Cabaniss had been an invalid for a number of years, and the ills and pains of this life were borne with a Christian fortitude that was sweet to behold, and in this she taught us a lesson of patience and trust in a loving Father, who will do all things well.Â Now to the loved ones that are left I will say: Be of good cheer, for the time is not far distant when father, mother, brother, and sister will be reunited in that beautiful home beyond the skies, where pain, sorrow, and separation are unknown, and where all is one eternal day of joy and happiness with all of the redeemed of the earth in the presence of our Heavenly Father.Â A great many sorrowing relatives and friends followed the remains to Greenwood, where she was buried beside her husband and son, who had preceded her only a few short years.Â \"Blesses are the dead which die in the Lord.\"\n\nJ.

H. Parker, in Willow City, Texas; was married while quite young to John Caddell, with whom she came to Texas in November, 1849.Â Ten children blessed this union--six sons and four daughters.Â Two sons died in infancy, and three lost their lived in the war of 1861-65.Â She was left a widow in February, 1852.Â \"Grandma,\" as she was familiarly called, lived a sad life, yet no purer spirit ever shone through a tabernacle of clay than that of Grandma Caddell.Â She was gentle and retiring in her nature and strong in her attachments to loved ones and friends.Â As a wife and mother, she was unselfish, self-sacrificing, loving, and faithful.Â She became blind and very feeble during the last years of her life, but bore her afflictions with the greatest patience, scarcely ever a murmur escaping her lips.Â O, what were life if life were all!Â Â Farewell, dear grandmother.Â It is hard to say, but such it must be.Â The world that knew you is better for your earthly sojourn.Â As the sun sinking behind the western hills sends back its golden shafts of light, giving beauty to the close of day, even so in death the influence of her pious life makes better those left behind.Â She left many relatives and friends to mourn her departure, but we sorrow not as those without hope, for we believe that all who fall asleep in Jesus will God bring with him; and while she cannot come to us, we can go to her if we follow in the footsteps of the Savior she loved and obeyed.Â With this assurance, let us be comforted and prepare for the happy reunion in the beautiful home beyond.\n\nDollie Skinner., Weatherford, Texas.\n\nGospel Advocate, June 15, 1899, page 378.\n\nÂ Â \"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.\"Â One more of the mothers of Israel has passed through the gate of life.Â My dear grandmother, Mrs. Sarah Caddell, has laid down the cross to receive the crown, on March 7, 1899, at the home of her daughter, Mrs.Â A. H. Parker, near Willow City, Gillespie County, Texas, the curtains of death gently closed round the scene of her life.Â Grandmother obeyed the call of her Master in the days of her youth and was ever a zealous Christian.Â She bore the burden and heat of the day and labored far into the evening, being eight-five years of age.Â Truly a mother in Israel has fallen, and although her work was nobly done, we sadly mourn our loss.Â Though dead, she yet speaketh; for the kind, gentle, sweet disposition that characterized her made a lasting impression on the hearts and lives of those who came in reach of her hallowed influence.Â Realizing that her work on earth was done, she anxiously waited for the Lord to call her from her earthly house to the home where changes never come.Â Such a life purifies the heart, ennobles the soul, and gives a clearer conception of what we should be; and we are thankful we had such a mother (and grandmother) to guide us so long in the weary way.Â So let us be earnest and prayerful, walking in the footsteps of Jesus, that we may meet her in the sweet by and by.\n\nOne who loved her.\n\nGospel Advocate, June 29, 1899, page 413.\n\nCarmack, George W.\n\nÂ Â Brother George W. Carmack was born in Overton County, Tenn., on January 5, 1811, and died in his native county on July 27, 1899, at the ripe old age of eighty-eight years, six months, and twenty-two days.Â Brother Carmack was married to Mahaly Mayfield on February 21, 1837, who survives him.Â They had no children of their own, but reared many orphan children.Â Brother Carmack obeyed the gospel over fifty years ago in Missouri, where he lived for about seven years, after which he returned to his old home, where he spent the remainder of his life.Â He lived a consistent Christian, meeting regularly with the brethren at Livingston each Lord's day, when not prevented by sickness, except for two or three years when the brethren had no house in which to meet and worship at this place.Â During those years Brother Carmack and his wife rode across the hills about six miles every Sunday, when the weather would permit, to meet with the brethren at Flat Creek.Â A good old man is gone to rest, and the church at this place will miss his familiar face; the town and community will miss him, for he was known and loved by all; but we will not mourn as those who have no hope, for we hope to meet the dear old brother again in that bright beyond, where parting will be no more.Â I will say to his aged companion who is left behind: Cheer up, Aunt 'Haly; you will soon meet your husband, if you will be faithful, where sorrow and death never come.\n\nR. L. Burks.\n\nGospel Advocate, October 5, 1899, page 638.\n\nCastleman, Edgar\n\nÂ Â Edgar Castleman died at his home near Donelson, Tenn., on September 11, 1899, of typhoid fever.Â He obeyed the gospel five years ago, and was about twenty-six years old when he died.Â He endeavored to live the Christian life after coming into the church, and was wonderfully hopeful and cheerful as death approached, looking forward to a better and more enduring home, and was not the least afraid of the consequences of death.Â He made a faithful husband and father, and leaves a wife and child behind to mourn their loss of him, besides a father, several brothers and sisters, and many friends.Â But they are comforted and cheered by the hope of the gospel, and if they will serve the Lord faithfully in this life, they may meet him in that happy home that knows no ending, and where death can no more take the dear ones from their midst.Â A large crowd of relatives, friends, and neighbors were at the funeral to weep with those who weep, and to show the respect they held for the departed.Â His last remains were laid to rest in the family graveyard at his father's place.\n\nE. G. S.\n\nGospel Advocate, September 28, 1899, page 618.\n\nCathey, A.\n\nÂ Â It is with a sad heart I write of the death of Brother A. Cathey, who passed away very suddenly and almost without a struggle on May 18.Â He had not complained of being sick, and awoke early, telling his wife that he had slept better than usual, and would rest longer in bed.Â She left him, but, hearing him groan, she returned to his bedside to find him dead.Â He was seventy-seven years old and leaves a wife, six children, many relatives, and scores of brethren and sisters to mourn his death.Â Brother Cathey was of a quiet and retiring disposition, and only those who knew him well could appreciate him properly.Â He had lived a consistent Christian life for fifty years, and was a good man in the truest and best sense of the word \"good.\"Â Eternity alone can reveal the great blessing that such a life is to the world.Â The happy home circle has been broken and hearts are left bleeding and desolate; but he has gone to join a family circle that shall never be broken, where God will wipe away all tears, where there will be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying.Â It will not be long till we all pass over the river.Â Se we should give heed to Paul's admonition: \"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.\"Â For\n\nYouth and vigor soon will fail,\n\nÂ Â Blooming beauty lose its charm;\n\nAll that's mortal soon shall be\n\nÂ Â Inclosed in death's cold arms.\n\nR.

Compton was born on May 30, 1844: obeyed the gospel in 1868; died on July 26, 1899.Â In the presence of a large concourse of loving, sympathizing friends the writer conducted the funeral services at the Baptist church, at Milton, Tenn.Â Brother Compton made the Bible his constant study through life, being very familiar with its teaching.Â He lived the life of a Christian, died the death of the righteous, and received the reward of a faithful servant.\n\nW. L. Logan.\n\nGospel Advocate, November 9, 1899, page 714.\n\nCouch, R. W., Dr.\n\nÂ Â The church at Murfreesboro sustains a very great loss in the death of Dr. R. W. Couch, which occurred on July 7, 1899, at his residence on Maney avenue.Â Brother Couch was born on March 13, 1834, having just passed over the threshold of his sixty-fifth year when death came to him.Â At the time of his death he had been a member of the church of Christ for thirteen years.Â Ever after being baptized he was true to the obligations thus imposed upon him.Â He ever listened to the voice of God, believed what was spoken, and obeyed that which was commanded.Â\n\nW.

L. and Jeffie Coward.Â How sad it is to give up such a sweet little flower!Â But she has gone where there is no more suffering.Â May we all be prepared to meet her in the bright forever.\n\nAuntie., Maysfield, Texas.\n\nGospel Advocate, August 10, 1899, page 512.\n\nCurlee, Cullen E.\n\nÂ Â Near Woodbury, Tenn., August 23, 1899, the death angel visited and took from our midst our beloved father, Cullen E.
