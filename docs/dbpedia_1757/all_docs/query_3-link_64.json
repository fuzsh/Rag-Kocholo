We are at last implementing our History Gateway and on the verge of taking first small, then big steps toward the Capitol Master Plan.\n\nI’m excited about these two projects because they are the main directives of the statutes under which the Foundation operates. They are directly connected to taking care of Oregon’s very special Capitol building and its history.\n\nAt the recent Hello Again Capitol Social, there was a lot of excitement, enthusiasm and happy socializing with old and new friends. It felt like a positive beginning for an auspicious voyage.\n\nThanks to everyone who attended and supported the event. I look forward to working with all of you.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHello Again Capitol Social a Success\n\nThe Foundation hosted their first Hello Again Capitol Social on February 5th. The purpose of the event was to welcome new, returning and former legislators to the Capitol, renew friendships and celebrate our stately Capitol. The event was a success with nearly 400 in attendance and raising money for the Foundation and its efforts. The evening included a raffle drawing and the reveal of the newly installed exhibit designed by the Oregon Historical Society. Click here to view a slideshow of the event.\n\nThe event ticket included a one-year Capitol Friend membership with proceeds supporting the Foundation’s work. Event Co-Chair Joan Plank felt that becoming a Capitol Friend was an obvious decision; “Helping preserve the building and its history is so important. When the opportunity came along to help by becoming a Capitol Friend, it was a perfect fit”. Co-Chair Frankie Bell shared similar feelings, “I feel so strongly about the work of the Foundation and its goal of preserving Capitol history, as well as, supporting Legislative Administration in their effort to care for the building. I would certainly encourage others who have similar feelings to join the Foundation and support our objectives by joining or renewing your 2013 Capitol Friend membership”.\n\nBack to Top\n\nRaffle Winner Announced\n\nCarl Christoferson of Portland was the winner of a limited edition bottle of kentucky bourbon, donated by Foundation member and Capitol Friend Lifetime member Ginny Lang and Phil Lang. A history buff, Carl is on the board of the Oregon Historical Society. Thank you to all who contributed to the Foundation's fundraiser.\n\nBack to Top\n\nThank You Event Sponsors\n\nThe Hello Again Capitol Social would not have been possible without the generous sponsors who helped underwrite the event costs for food, beverages and decorations. By partnering with the Foundation, they played a part in celebrating the preservation of this grand Capitol, a historical landmark, and its history for generations to come.\n\nPresenting Sponsors\n\nCapitol Club\n\nOregon Home Builders Association\n\nOregon Anglers Research Society\n\nBP America\n\nAmazon\n\nOregon Beer & Wine Distributers\n\nDavis Wright Tremain\n\nState Representative Brian Clem\n\nNW Natural\n\nRPD Company\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\n\nJD Anderson Associations\n\nOCAPA\n\nDave Barrows & Associates\n\nLen & Betsy Bergstein\n\nThe Victory Group, Inc.\n\nGardner & Gardner\n\nNan Heim/Associates\n\nOxley & Associates\n\nJohn Powell & Associates\n\nOregon Bankers Association\n\nAM:PM PR\n\nYoung’s Market\n\nSilver Sponsors\n\nCobaCo\n\nGovernment Affairs\n\nMartin & Associates\n\nBarrie Hughes Group\n\nOzzie Rose Ron and Jane Cease\n\nPAC/WEST Communications\n\nVanNatta Public Relations\n\nIn House Graphics\n\nClaudia Black and Carl Hosticka\n\nLegislative Advocates\n\nBack to Top\n\nFoundation’s Goals Approved\n\nOver the last few months, the Foundation has been refining their strategic plan and approved the following goals:\n\nGoal One: Encourage public engagement with the Oregon State Capitol and its grounds as the “people’s building”.\n\nGoal Two: Support forward progress for eventual approval of the State Capitol Master Plan.\n\nGoal Three: Encourage “social capital”, connecting leaders to the Foundation’s purposes.\n\nGoal Four: Strengthen the Foundation as an organization with new and improved structures, policies and procedures.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBack to Top\n\nWelcome New Foundation Members\n\nSenator Ted Ferrioli\n\nSenator Lee Beyer\n\nSenator Arnie Roblan\n\nRepresentative John Huffman\n\nMs. Joan Plank\n\nBack to Top\n\nGuest Option - Achieving Sustainability through Historic Preservation\n\nSince 1938 the State Capitol has held an undeniable place in Oregon’s political and social history, not to mention the building’s, shall we say, eclectic modernistic design. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the Capitol is an emblem of our state’s cultural heritage. However preservation of the building isn’t just about protecting our past, preservation is about sustainability.\n\nFor the economy, 75% of the financial benefit generated by building rehabilitation stays within the local community, creating more jobs per dollar spent than manufacturing or new construction. For the environment, preservation maximizes energy already expended to produce, transport, and assemble the materials embodied in a building. Even with today’s technologies, it can take up to 80 years for a new building to recoup, through energy efficiency, the harsh environmental impacts related to demolition and construction.\n\nA 2012 report, Resilient Masonry Buildings, identified practical ways to translate the tangible benefits of preservation into policies supporting the upgrade of buildings here in Oregon. The report recommends “Preservation plans for all public masonry buildings should be prepared by 2020. The legislature should support these plans with special funding strategies and a timeframe for upgrades.” The Historic Preservation League of Oregon looks forward to a dialogue about preserving the Capitol, not only to protect the past, but to invest in the future.\n\n-Brandon Spencer-Hartle is the Field Programs Manager at the nonprofit Historic Preservation League of Oregon\n\nBack to Top\n\nInterpretative Planning and Program Design Team Selected\n\nBucy Associates, experts in interpretative planning, have been selected to design and formalize the History Gateway Interpretative Plan. The interpretative plan will be used as the roadmap for future exhibits and interpretative programing in Oregon’s History Gateway at the Capitol.\n\nDr. Dave Bucy has studied, practiced and taught interpretation since 1975. With over 25 years working in the field, Dave has developed extensive knowledge of how to plan effective networks of orientation, way finding and interpretive information to facilitate, enhance and enrich a visitor’s experience.\n\nFollow the project at www.oregoncapitolfoundation.com\n\nBack to Top\n\nInterpretative Planning Next Steps\n\nThe interpretive planning process is driven by a desire to attract more visitors to the Capitol (both onsite and electronically) and to use these visits as a way to excite people about our government and Oregon history which may spur them on to embark on their own journey of discovery.\n\nSince people invest in experiences with time - their most valued resource - a key part of the interpretative planning process is looking at what experiences different audiences will engage in through the 21st century so we can determine other ways to deliver the Capitol’s stories. The consultant hired to develop the interpretive plan and programming specializes in a visitor experience based approach. The planning process will be collaborative, with numerous opportunities for everyone to be involved.\n\nLook for project updates in future newsletters or follow the project online at www.oregoncapitolfoundation.com and find out how you can be involved.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCapitol Volunteers\n\nThe Oregon State Capitol Volunteer Program was officially established in 1985. Today there are 58 volunteers who serve in the kiosk, Gift Shop, and as tour guides and House and Senate doorkeepers. They contributed nearly 5,000 hours in 2012. The volunteers have a vast array of experience and community involvement, and come from many walks of life including students, veterans, retired business professionals and school teachers. There are many reasons these individuals contribute their time, but overall it’s because of their love for Oregon, its history, and their desire to serve the people who come together at our State Capitol.\n\nBack to Top\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nSenator Kenneth Allen Jernstedt, passed away at the age of 95 on February 5, 2013 of age-related causes. Ken was born July 20, 1917 to Fred and Mae Jernstedt in Carlton, where he spent his childhood years on a farm on the Yamhill River and graduating from Yamhill High School in 1935. After graduating from Linfield College in 1939, where during his senior year he met his future wife, freshman Laura Elliott of Boring, he enlisted with the Marine Air Corps where he gained his aviator's wings in 1941.\n\nSenator Jernstedt lived his adult life in Hood River. Ken first served as mayor of Hood River in 1959, followed by service in the Oregon House and the Oregon Senate from 1966 to his retirement in 1989. He was again elected mayor of Hood River in 1989. He is survived by his wife of 50 years Gen; sons Ken (Jill) Jernstedt of Lake Oswego and Jeff (Ann) Jernstedt of Bend; daughters Sybil (Bob) Ford of Springfield, Greta (Keith) Sheppard of West Linn, Meredith (Kent) Frigaard of Wilsonville, Laurie Mason of Vancouver and 22 grandchildren.\n\nExcerpts originally published in the Oregonian on February 10, 2013\n\nBack to Top\n\nLifetime Capitol Friends\n\nJohn & Sandra Allen, Kathleen Beaufait, George and Frankie Bell, Rep.
