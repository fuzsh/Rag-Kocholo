The Society for Research on Biological Rhythms announced the awards at their biennial meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico in May 2024. Congratulations to Jennifer and Jay for this high honor!\n\nJosé Delgado & Hannah Opalko receive\n\n2023 E. Lucile Smith Award for Scientific Excellence in Biochemistry\n\nThe Department of Biochemistry & Cell Biology is pleased to announce José Delgado and Hannah Opalko as the recipients of the 2023 E. Lucile Smith Award for Scientific Excellence in Biochemistry. The Smith Awards honor the ground-breaking career of Dr. E. Lucile Smith, the first woman to attain the rank of Professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. José and Hannah received this award in recognition of their exceptional research accomplishments during the past year. The Dr. E. Lucile Smith awards are funded by the generosity of Dr. Smith’s nephew Gray Parker, his wife Mary Kay, and the Booth-Bricker Fund.\n\nJosé is being recognized for his accomplishments as a Ph.D. candidate in the lab of Dr. Christopher Shoemaker. José successfully defended in January 2024 and graduated with his Ph.D. in March 2024. José combines functional genomics, fluorescence microscopy, and biochemistry to dissect mechanisms of autophagy. His work focuses on mitochondrial autophagic degradation, dubbed mitophagy, mediated by tail-anchored proteins. This cellular process is often dysregulated in human pathologies, including cancer. José’s work, recently published in The EMBO Journal, demonstrates new mode of protein regulation of a key tail-anchored protein that mediates mitophagy. Overall hinting at a novel regulatory axis that is utilized to meet the metabolic demands of the cell.\n\nHannah is being recognized for her accomplishments as a postdoctoral research scientist in the lab of Dr. James Moseley. She graduated with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Cell Biology from Dartmouth and continued in the Moseley lab to perform her postdoctoral work. Hannah’s work sought to understand how the cell positions clusters of the protein Cdr2 which are involved in mitotic signaling and cytokinetic ring formation. Cdr2 localizes to the plasma membrane at the cell center. Hannah and her co-authors found that the cell uses multiple redundant mechanisms for Cdr2 positioning. The nucleus and a tether known as Arf6 act as positive cues holding Cdr2 in the center, while an inhibitor kinase and membrane flow prevent Cdr2 from accumulating at the cell tips. Collectively, this work can help inform how other spatial patterns are created within a cell. This work was published in Molecular Biology of the Cell in 2023. Hannah currently works as a Scientist at Celdara Medical.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nJennifer Loros Receives the 2023 B. O.

Lucile Smith Award for Scientific Excellence in Biochemistry\n\nThe Department of Biochemistry & Cell Biology is pleased to announce Chenhui Deng and Frieda Kage as the recipients of the 2022 E. Lucile Smith Award for Scientific Excellence in Biochemistry. The Smith Awards honor the ground-breaking career of Dr. E. Lucile Smith, the first woman to attain the rank of Professor of Biochemistry at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. Chenhui and Frieda received this award in recognition of their exceptional research accomplishments during the past year. The Dr. E. Lucile Smith awards are funded by the generosity of Dr. Smith’s nephew Gray Parker, his wife Mary Kay, and the Booth-Bricker Fund.\n\nChenhui is being recognized for his accomplishments as a Ph.D. candidate in the labs of Dr. Duane Compton and Dr. Kristina Godek. Chenhui joined the Compton and Godek Labs in June 2019, where his research focuses on the causes and consequences of aneuploidy with incorrect numbers of chromosomes during early human development using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a model system. Previous studies have shown that chromosome segregation errors are surprisingly common in human totipotent and pluripotent embryonic cells, resulting in aneuploidy being the leading cause of miscarriages and birth defects. Yet, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood, especially for mitotic errors. Combining quantitative microscopy, live-cell imaging, and biochemical approaches, Chenhui found that the most frequent mitotic error in hPSCs is lagging chromosomes caused by improper microtubule attachments. He further investigated the strategies using small molecules to reduce mitotic errors in hPSCs. Collectively, Chenhui’s work demonstrates that a low mitotic fidelity is an inherent and conserved phenotype of hPSCs. Importantly, chromosome segregation fidelity depends on developmental state in normal human cells, with mitotic error rates increasing upon gain and decreasing upon loss of pluripotency. This work was recently published and featured as the cover in the February 2023 issue of Stem Cell Reports.\n\nFrieda is being recognized for her accomplishments as a postdoctoral research scientist in the lab of Dr. Harry Higgs. She graduated with her Ph.D. in Molecular Cellular Biology from Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms University and joined the Higgs Lab in February 2019. Frieda’s projects in the Higgs lab encompass two different actin-based structures, “Calcium-induced actin” (CIA) assembled on endoplasmic reticulum, and “Acute damage-induced actin” (ADA) assembled on mitochondria. CIA and ADA are controlled by different actin-binding proteins upon different stimuli, resulting in different cellular consequences. CIA causes mitochondria to divide. ADA occurs when mitochondria fail and appears to be important in maintaining cellular energy supply during this situation. Mitochondria dysfunction is associated with many diseases of aging, including neurodegeneration, so they feel understanding these actin-based structures will help in understanding the aging process. In Frieda’s work published in Molecular Biology of the Cell in 2022, she combined gene-editing tools, such as CRISPR, with quantitative microscopy and biochemical assays to reveal how CIA promotes mitochondrial division. In her work published in Current Biology in 2022, she uncovered the converging pathways leading to ADA formation on mitochondria.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nCongratulations to the Biochemistry & Cell Biology Program 2022 Graduates!\n\nAdrianna De La Torre (Chang Lab)\n\nSenior Associate at Clarion Healthcare\n\nBrooke Brauer (Kettenbach Lab)\n\nSenior Scientist at Mass Spectrometry\n\nBrae M.

Lucile Smith Award for Scientific Excellence in Biochemistry\n\nThe Department of Biochemistry & Cell Biology is pleased to announce Adrianna De La Torre and Kristi Miller as the recipients of the 2021 E. Lucile Smith Award for Scientific Excellence in Biochemistry. The Smith Awards honor the ground-breaking career of Dr. E. Lucile Smith, the first woman to attain the rank of Professor of Biochemistry at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. Adrianna and Kristi received this award in recognition of their exceptional research accomplishments during the past year. The Dr. E. Lucile Smith awards are funded by the generosity of Dr. Smith’s nephew Gray Parker, his wife Mary Kay, and the Booth-Bricker Fund.\n\nAdrianna is being recognized for her accomplishments as a Ph.D. candidate in the lab of Dr. Ta Yuan Chang. Adrianna successfully defended in April 2022 and will formally graduate with her Ph.D. in June. Adrianna’s research focuses on developing nanoparticles encapsulating acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors. ACAT is involved with cholesterol regulation and homeostasis by converting free cholesterol into cholesteryl esters for storage in the cell. Previous studies from the Chang lab and others have shown the benefits of inhibiting ACAT in atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and certain forms of cancer. ACAT inhibitors are readily available, however, methods to encapsulate and deliver ACAT inhibitors by nanoparticles have not been reported. In her most recent work, Adrianna developed and characterized a stealth lipid-based nanoparticle system to facilitate the delivery of a potent ACAT inhibitor. This work was recently published in J Neurosci Methods.\n\nKristi is being recognized for her accomplishments as a postdoctoral research scientist in the lab of Dr. James Moseley. She graduated with a Ph.D. in Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology from The Ohio State University and joined the Moseley Lab in June 2019. Kristi’s initial project in the Moseley lab revealed a new mechanism of t-SNARE regulation in fission yeast. Combining quantitative microscopy and genetic approaches, Kristi and co-authors found that clustering of a conserved t-SNARE Psy1 (S. pombe Syntaxin) into multi-protein nodes at non-growing fission yeast cell sides restricts exocytosis to growing cell tips. Collectively, this work identifies a new mechanism that contributes to spatial control of polarized cell growth. This work was published in Molecular Biology of the Cell in 2021. Kristi’s current research focuses on how cells control their size.\n\nApril 2022\n\nElaina Melton Selected as Associate Director of Research Projects in the Department of\n\nPathology and Laboratory Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine\n\nCongratulations to Elaina Melton, PhD on her new role as Associate Director of Research Projects in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine. Elaina spent 7 years in the Biochemistry and Cell Biology department at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. She completed her post-doctoral training, then served as a Research Scientist, with Ta Yuan Chang and Cathy Chang. Elaina’s research aims to understand the mechanisms linking cholesterol metabolism to inflammation. After departing Dartmouth in 2019, Elaina spent two years as a Research Assistant Professor at Georgia State University.\n\nDecember 2021\n\nBCB Labs Present Research at the 69th ASMS Conference\n\non Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics\n\nThe Kettenbach and Gerber Labs recently returned from the American Society for Mass Spectrometry’s (ASMS) 69th national conference in Philadelphia, PA.
