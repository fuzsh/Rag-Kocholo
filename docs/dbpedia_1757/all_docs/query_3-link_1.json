Your Foundation members are excited about the progress on the History Gateway, with the Capitol as the center of its own history, and links to Oregon history all over the state. The Gateway's primary goal is increased participation in Oregon's democracy. We'll kick off the first phase together with Oregon's 155th birthday on February 14, 2014.\n\nSpeaking of birthdays, our Capitol, that is, the 1938 part, will be 75 on October 1 this year. Read about the birthday party in this newsletter and online at www.oregoncapitolfoundation.org and remember to put it on your calendar.\n\nWe're excited about the Gateway and the birthdays, but we're absolutely ecstatic about the approval of $34.5 million for the design phase of the Capitol Master Plan. Thank you to all who have helped with this and especially to Gary Wilhelms, Fred Van Natta, and our Foundation's \"Marble\" Committee who have been working on this, providing information to legislators and doing a very outstanding job of it. It's the beginning of saving the Capitol building, and all the people who work in it and visit it, from the big earthquake that we know is coming. Please say thank you to your legislators if they voted for SB 5507.\n\nReturn to top\n\nCapitol's 75th Birthday Announcement\n\nSomething amazing is happening this fall! The Capitol will turn 75. We all know that Oregon has had three capitols. The first was destroyed in December of 1855 by fire, the second again devastated by fire on April 25, 1935. Our current - and most unique Capitol - was designed by Francis Keally with the New York firm of Trowbridge & Livingston and dedicated on October 1, 1938.\n\nIn celebration of 75 years the Foundation is holding a celebration on Oct 1. The festivities will include Capitol tours, presentations from the Historic Preservation Office, live music and a well-deserved birthday gift for the Capitol. The Capitol's birthday cake will be presented at 2:00 p.m. The most spectacular element of the festivities will be the massive \"candles\" on the Capitol dome that will shine over the Capitol Mall.\n\nThe Foundation's Special Events Committee members deserve a special thanks for their work in planning the event!\n\nIn addition, the Capitol will open on Saturday, September 28th, and Saturday, October 5th with activities for visitors. Keep up-to-date on the celebration's activities by visiting the Capitol's Facebook page: www.facebook.com/OregonCapitol\n\nReturn to top\n\nThe History Gateway and Interpretive Plan - Goals and Context Report Approved\n\nApproved goals for the interpretive network were developed working from mandates adopted in the History Gateway Strategic Plan.\n\nPrimary Goal: Increase participation in Oregon's democracy.\n\nThe range of current involvement in Oregon's democracy for those visiting the Capitol will include every level from running for office to those who don't vote. Rather than identifying a specific level of involvement to be achieved, the program will focus on motivating each visitor to increase his or her level of participation.\n\nSecondary Goal: Increase interest in Oregon's history, and especially in the history of government.\n\nAs an important state historical site with significant attraction power located in the center of Salem, the Capitol can function as a hub for a network of interpretive opportunities focused on Oregon's history, especially as it relates to government. In other words, it will function as a 'gateway' to Oregon's history by capitalizing on interest generated through telling the story of Oregon's government.\n\nWith the goals and messages approved, the next step in the process for developing the Interpretive Plan focuses on the Context Report. The report is not the plan for communicating those messages, rather it is a description and analysis of the context within which the Interpretive Network must function.\n\nTo read the Context Report and Executive Summary go to www.oregoncapitolfoundation.com and click on Oregon's History Gateway at the Capitol.\n\nReturn to top\n\nThe Plate is Half-Full\n\nThe Driver and Motor Vehicle (DMV) Services Division reports that they have sold just over half of the Pacific Wonderland plates. There is a threshold of 40,000 plates that may be issued, and as of June 30, 2013, over 20,000 have been sold. There is a one-time surcharge of $100 per set of plates, in addition to the $24 plate fee and regular registration fee. But as we all may know, 50% is directed to the Oregon State Capitol Foundation and 50% to the Oregon Historical Society for their projects. Visit www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV for further details.\n\nReturn to top\n\nShining a Light on the Capitol\n\nWhat better way to celebrate a birthday than with candles on the cake!\n\nThanks to generous donation from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the Capitol will be appropriately decorated for its 75th Birthday Celebration on October 1, 2013.\n\nA shout-out to IBEW's Tim Frew and the Capitol's Volunteer Coordinator Lora Howden for their coordination with this event. The candle display will be one of several events that will occur during the Capitol's birthday. Among those events will be the opportunity to visit the Capitol on Saturday, September 28th and October 5th; both are dates the Capitol would normally be closed to the public.\n\nPlease visit the Oregon State Capitol Foundation's website for more details about all of the activities.\n\nReturn to top\n\nA Capitol Volunteer!\n\nFoundation member Lenore Kipp began volunteering for the Capitol in 1993. She has a rich family history. Lenore's grandmother danced in the Ziegfeld Follies, her mother was related to Adlai Stevenson, and her native Oregonian father, Clark, had a twin brother named Lewis. In 1937 Lenore's father, Boring's grade school principal, took her and several other children to view FDR's caravan as the president made his way to Timberline Lodge for the New Deal-era building's dedication.\n\nLenore's love of Oregon, the Capitol, and its history makes her an enthusiastic, knowledgeable, energetic guide - still climbing the tower after 20 years as a volunteer!\n\nThank you for 20 great years as an Oregon State Capitol Volunteer!\n\nReturn to top\n\nCapitol Master Plan\n\nDuring the 2013 Legislative Session, legislators approved bonding authority to begin the Design Phase of the Capitol Master Plan. As the Master Plan project enters the next phase, consultants (Architect & Engineer, Construction Manager/General Contractor, and Owners Representative) will form the core project team, and help ensure that the Master Plan project moves forward successfully.\n\nAdditional information on the Capitol Master Plan project is available online at: www.leg.state.or.us/mp.\n\nReturn to top\n\nCapitol Foundation Partners with the Oregon State Fair\n\nAs part of the 75th Birthday Celebration, the Foundation has partnered with the State Fair to sponsor a Cake Design Competition. The event will be judged on August 24th at 3:30 p.m. State legislators have been asked to judge the contest along with representatives from the Foundation.\n\nThe winning cake design will be replicated and featured at the Capitol's 75th Birthday Clelebration on October 1 in the Capitol Rotunda. The winning contestant will be recognized at the event.\n\nTo enter the contest, sign up at the State Fair's website: www.oregonstatefair.org/competition/fair-time.\n\nReturn to top\n\nC apitol Friends Lifetime Members\n\nJohn & Sandra Allen, Kathleen Beaufait, George and Frankie Bell, Rep.
