Intangible Contributions

His leadership, defensive tenacity, and overall versatility made Wallace one of those players who set an example for the rest of his team or perhaps even shaped the NBA landscape. He was the ultimate glue guy, so he was a viable addition to any roster based on factors that could extend past traditional metrics he enhanced while between lines.
