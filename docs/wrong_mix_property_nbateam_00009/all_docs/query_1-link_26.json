        "text": "It remains to be seen if Rasheed Wallace will help make the New York Knicks a force in the NBA this season.\n\nBut the former Detroit Pistons forward has already done one thing: He's made the Knicks the oldest team in NBA history.\n\nWallace ended his one-year retirement today, when he signed a one-year deal with the Knicks for the veteran's minimum of $1.7 million, according to a story by the New York Post.\n\nThe Post said \"it is unclear how much money is guaranteed, pending whether he makes the team.\"\n\nWallace joined the Knicks for practice today.\n\nThe 38-year-old Wallace makes the Knicks the oldest team in NBA history, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"The 2012 Knicks will be almost five years older than they were last year, when the average player was 27 years and 300 days old,\" The Journal wrote prior to Wallace's signing.\n\n\"Assuming Wallace signs, their top 13 players would be, on average, 32 years and 240 days oldâ€”the oldest team in NBA history, according to Stats LLC. No team has ever gotten so much older from one season to the next.\"\n\nWallace spent six of his NBA seasons with the Pistons, helping them win the 2004 NBA championship.\n\nIn 1,088 career games, he has averaged 14.6 points and 6.7 rebounds.\n\nEmail Brendan Savage at bsavage@mlive.com and follow him on Twitter at twitter.com/BrendanSavage and like MLive.com's Pistons page on Facebook."
