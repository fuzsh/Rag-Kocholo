        "text": "This is the second of a series of Detroit Pistons \"what-if\" stories, analyzing moments in the history of the franchise and what could have happened had events gone a different way.\n\nDid Robert Horry’s wide-open 3-pointer cost the Detroit Pistons a championship?\n\nRasheed Wallace’s decision to help off of “Big Shot Rob” in Game 5 of the 2005 NBA Finals — leaving the Spurs forward to drain the winning 3-pointer in overtime and give the Spurs a 3-2 series lead — is often cited as the moment that prevented the Pistons from winning their second consecutive ring.\n\nThe Pistons actually rallied to win Game 6, 95-86, and tie the series, but the Spurs closed it out in front of their home crowd.\n\nHad Wallace stuck with Horry, who was the inbounder, it would’ve lessened his odds of getting off a clean 3-point shot. Would it have guaranteed a championship? If so, how would it have altered the legacy of the \"Goin’ to Work\" Pistons?\n\n‘That was brutal’\n\nWith 9.4 seconds remaining in overtime, San Antonio had the ball while trailing 95-93. Horry inbounded the ball to Manu Ginobili, who received the pass in the left corner.\n\nWallace, who was tasked with defending Horry, rotated over to help Tayshaun Prince double-team Ginobili.\n\nGinobili immediately found Horry, who stepped inbounds to the left wing and nailed the open triple as Prince ran over to contest the shot.\n\nHorry’s shot still weighs heavily on the psyche of that Pistons team. In 2018, Chauncey Billups joined the \"Lowe Post\" podcast with ESPN’s Zach Lowe and discussed the play.\n\n\"The darkest day of my career as a pro was when Horry hit that shot in Game 5 on us,\" Billups said. \"Oh man, that was brutal.\"\n\nBillups absolved Wallace of responsibility for the gaffe, pinning blame instead on then-head coach Larry Brown.\n\nThe Spurs went with a lineup of point guard Tony Parker, shooting guard Ginobili, small forward Bruce Bowen, Horry and Tim Duncan for their final offensive possession. When Billups saw that Brown was subbing in guard Lindsey Hunter, he assumed Hunter would sub in for Wallace so that Prince could defend Horry.\n\nInstead, Hunter subbed in for Billups. Hypothetically, Prince would’ve been a better fit to defend Horry. They’re both 6-foot-9, and Prince is a more mobile defender. Brown opted to stick with Wallace on Horry.\n\n\"Buzzer goes off and (Lindsey) says, 'Chauncey, I got you,’ \" Billups said. “And I'm like, 'What the hell?' I just didn't understand it. So obviously, there's no time, it's time to win the game, worry about it later.\n\n\"For so many reasons, it's just crazy, I didn't have any issues defensively. Not only that, what happens if the rebound comes off and your free-throw shooter is not in the game? I mean, there's just so many different ... I really think, for real, I think Larry (Brown) just kinda choked in that moment. ... I don't know, that was crazy.”\n\n\"I'm the MVP of the series if we win again,” Billups continued. “It's over. I'm the MVP of the series if we win it again. That's two times, back-to-back.\"\n\nRare territory\n\nIf the Pistons won championships in 2004 and 2005, it would make them only the fourth NBA franchise to win back-to-back titles on more than one occasion. They would join the \"Bad Boys\" Pistons, who won in 1989 and 1990.\n\nIt also would have been their fourth franchise championship, moving them past the Sixers for the sixth-most among NBA teams.\n\nIt’s fun to predict how the impact of winning consecutive championships would’ve altered the rest of the decade.\n\nWould the Pistons have bought out Brown in July 2005? During the Pistons’ playoff run, rumors spread that Brown was weighing opportunities with other teams — rumors that he didn’t quell. If Brown remained as coach, the Pistons would not have hired Flip Saunders.\n\nDoes Ben Wallace leave the Pistons in free agency for the Bulls in 2006 if he has two rings instead of one?\n\nIf Ben Wallace stays, do the Pistons lose to the LeBron James-led Cavaliers in six games in the 2007 Eastern Conference finals? A series win would’ve set up a rematch against the Spurs in the Finals.\n\nWould Joe Dumars have been as eager to shake up the core in 2008 by trading Billups if he had won a second Finals MVP?\n\nAnd then there are the various macro and micro decisions that would have been affected — draft positions, picks, free-agency signings and all of the related roster developments that are impossible to predict.\n\nA championship wasn’t guaranteed, though\n\nEven if Wallace had closed out on Horry, it’s possible the Spurs still would’ve won Game 5.\n\nWith nearly 10 seconds remaining, they had plenty of time to get a shot off. The Pistons preferred to give up a game-tying 2-pointer rather than a game-winning 3-pointer, but who’s to say the Spurs wouldn’t have engineered another way to get off a 3-pointer?\n\nEven if the Spurs tied the game and sent it into a second overtime, it’s possible they would’ve won in the extra period. It’s tempting to give the Pistons the benefit of the doubt because they were at home, but it was an evenly matched game within the final minutes.\n\nWe should also consider that a Rasheed Wallace contest might not have stopped Horry from hitting the 3-pointer. After all, he earned his “Big Shot Rob” nickname from hitting numerous clutch shots in playoff games, many of which were well-defended.\n\nIt’s easy to blame Wallace for Horry’s shot. In actuality, the Pistons had numerous opportunities to win that game. Regardless, the Spurs had plenty of time to engineer a winning play."
