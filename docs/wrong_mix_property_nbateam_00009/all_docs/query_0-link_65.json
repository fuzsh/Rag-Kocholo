        "text": "Rasheed Wallace’s long-awaited comeback lasted all of 3 minutes and 50 seconds.\n\nWallace will not be a factor for the Knicks in the playoffs after all – or on the basketball court ever again.\n\nThe forward announced his second retirement on Wednesday as the Knicks were set to begin their playoff run vs. the Celtics on Saturday. The 38-year-old power forward had come out of retirement to play for Mike Woodson this year, but missed most of the season, first with a stress reaction, then a broken foot that required surgery in late February.\n\nHe attempted to return for the postseason and tried to use Monday’s game against the Bobcats as a warmup, but played 3:50 before leaving with a sore left foot. Woodson indicated at the morning shootaround Wednesday that Wallace was in too much pain to play and one hour later the retirement announcement was made.\n\n“Rasheed has given this team everything he had,” Woodson said in a statement. ““He is a winner, true professional and leader on and off the court. Due to his injury, he will not be available to play for us during the playoffs. We owe this season’s success to veterans like Rasheed.”\n\nWoodson was an assistant when Wallace starred for the Pistons. Before the retirement announcement, Woodson said: “We’re still evaluating him. It’s soreness. As long as I’ve known him, he has a high tolerance for pain so it must really be bothering him.’’\n\nThe Knicks signed 7-footer Earl Barron to take Wallace’s spot on the roster. Barron, 31, played seven games for the Knicks in 2009-10, averaging a double-double and was on the Wizards earlier this season, playing most recently on Dec. 21. With the Knicks, Barron averaged 11.7 points and 11 rebounds in 33 minutes a game.\n\nWallace played in 21 games this season, averaging seven points per, and provided a boost on the defensive end. He proved to be a good locker-room guy, motivating his teammates while he was out. After one victory last month, he scrawled “50” on the locker room greaseboard to put out the goal of 50 wins.\n\nFellow banged-up big men Tyson Chandler and Kenyon Martin are both expected to practice Thursday when the Knicks start preparing for Boston. The first-round series against the Celtics starts Saturday at the Garden. The Knicks have been extremely busy the past four days. They signed big man Solomon Jones last Friday. He played just two games before they cut him to ink swingman Quentin Richardson, also an ex-Knick. ."
