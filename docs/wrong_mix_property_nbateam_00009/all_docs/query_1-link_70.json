        "text": "DETROIT — Michael Curry will be the Detroit Pistons head coach next season after only one year as an assistant.\n\nA former teammate is not surprised.\n\nCurry is set be introduced as Detroit’s new coach at a news conference today, Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars told The Associated Press.\n\nDallas Mavericks guard Jerry Stackhouse, who played with Curry in Detroit, said Curry was like a player-coach during his career on the court.\n\n‘‘It was just a matter of time,’’ Stackhouse said a telephone interview with the AP on Monday. ‘‘Everybody who knew Michael from his playing days knew this is where he would end up.\n\n‘‘He’s going to do great for Detroit because he already has great rapport with those players, who will give him a different kind of respect because he played in the league.’’\n\nCurry was an assistant last season in Detroit under for Flip Saunders, who was fired last week.\n\nThe Pistons and Curry agreed on a three-year deal worth $2.5 million a season. The team holds an option for a fourth season.\n\nBefore going to the bench, Curry was the NBDL’s vice president of player development following a playing career that started as an undrafted free agent during the 1993-94 season in Philadelphia and ended during the 2004-05 season with the Indiana Pacers.\n\nHe averaged 41⁄2 points, 1.6 rebounds and 20 minutes a game over his career, which included two stops in Detroit along with stints in Milwaukee, Toronto and Washington. His defense and leadership kept him in the league despite averaging less than seven points a season.\n\n‘‘I think he has a lot of good qualifications,’’ Phoenix Suns coach Terry Porter, who was a Pistons assistant with Curry last season, told the AP. ‘‘It’s a pretty good jump going from assistant to head coach, but like Stackhouse said, he’s been a player-coach most of his life.\n\n‘‘I don’t know what his staff will be like, but that’s important when you don’t have a lot of experience.’’\n\nThe 39-year-old Curry played with Dumars more than a decade ago and with current Pistons Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince during the 2002-03 season, when the franchise started its active streak of appearances in the Eastern Conference finals. He also played with Detroit center Rasheed Wallace in Washington.\n\nCurry might not coach all of those players next season because Dumars publicly put his whole team, other than Rodney Stuckey, on the trading block last week when he fired Saunders.\n\nCurry played professionally in Germany, Belgium and France as well as the CBA and USBL after he was a standout at Georgia Southern.\n\nToward the end of his NBA career, Curry was president of the players’ association and earned a masters degree from Virginia Commonwealth University. The native of Augusta, Ga., is married and has three children, including Deon, a wide receiver at Michigan State."
