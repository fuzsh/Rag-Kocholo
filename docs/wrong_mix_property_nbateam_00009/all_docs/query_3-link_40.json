        "text": "MEXICO CITY — When the Detroit Pistons take the floor Thursday night at Mexico City Arena, it won’t be the first time playing a game within the United States’ southern neighbor.\n\nOn Oct. 30, 1995, the Pistons faced the Washington Bullets in a preseason game at Palacio de los Deportes, another Mexico City venue, in the franchise’s first international foray.\n\nThe Pistons won — an Allan Houston four-point play was the key play late in the 110-99 victory — the game that featured budding stars Grant Hill for the Pistons and Juwan Howard for the Bullets.\n\n[ Derrick Rose starting to show why Pistons signed him ]\n\nLindsey Hunter and Joe Dumars combined for 41 points — 10 coming from Hunter late in the game.\n\nA Washington Post report describes quite the scene.\n\n“The 12,523 fans at Mexico City’s Palacio de los Deportes, which had been reduced to booing and hissing in the first half due to a series of Detroit air balls and turnovers, gave the two teams a standing ovation at halftime and spent most of the second half on their feet cheering,” the Post reporter wrote.\n\nBut three participants reached by the Free Press couldn’t remember that exact detail.\n\nNot surprising, considering Howard, now the coach at Michigan, Pistons director of team operations Mike Abdenour and former Don Reid have witnessed thousands of games.\n\nBut they all recalled other little details.\n\nFor Abdenour, he recalls the logistics.\n\nFor Howard, the game came early in what became the best season of his 19-year NBA career.\n\nFor Reid, he remembers a late-game confrontation against a fellow rookie.\n\nWrestling with Rasheed\n\nReid was the 58th overall pick of the 1995 NBA draft, a roster afterthought.\n\nBut he also was accustomed to long odds.\n\nHe didn’t pick up the game until his freshman year at Largo High in Maryland, not making the varsity until the second half of his 10th-grade season.\n\nHe entered Georgetown at 16, a lightly regarded recruit as part of the Class of 1991.\n\n“I really didn’t start playing basketball until the ninth grade, so I was always on a four-year pattern of starting over from scratch,” Reid said.\n\nBut by the time the Pistons headed to Mexico City toward the end of the preseason, some four years later, Reid was closing in a spot because of his position.\n\n“I think I was an afterthought until nobody wanted to play center,” Reid said. “That’s all I did. I played against Alonzo (Mourning), Patrick Ewing, whoever it is. That’s all I knew.”\n\nWhen asked about the game — Reid scored six points — he instantly remembered a late-game beef with Bullets rookie Rasheed Wallace.\n\nIt was nine years before Wallace was acquired to become the missing piece for the Pistons’ 2004 world title.\n\nAt that point, Reid was trying to make a point to a lottery pick.\n\n“It was a loose ball or something at midcourt and we were just wrestling around on the floor and the coaches came over,” Reid said. “I remember (Pistons coach) Doug Collins coming out on the floor, right in the middle of half-court.”\n\nHe can’t recall what set it off — although he brought up Wallace and North Carolina eliminating Georgetown in the NCAA tournament earlier that year.\n\nReid has remained in the Detroit area since his retirement in 2003.\n\nDid he ever bring the incident up with Wallace when he was brought to the Pistons?\n\n“Never discussed it,” Reid said with a laugh.\n\nReid recalls a dark arena in Mexico. He also remembers the police escort traveling with the team bus to the game, something he thought was a routine occurrence.\n\nIt wasn’t.\n\n“It was my rookie year, I had no expectations,” he said. “I didn’t know any different.\n\n“Without knowing or playing the season before, it seemed normal.”\n\nHoward’s career season\n\nHoward couldn’t recall much from the game in which he scored 23 points on 7-for-16 shooting — aside from a good meal at The Palm.\n\nBut he can easily recall the events from nine days before the game.\n\nChris Webber, also his teammate for two seasons at Michigan, suffered a dislocated shoulder.\n\nWebber was still out when the Bullets arrived in Mexico — he would eventually have shoulder surgery and miss the entire season.\n\nIt created an opportunity for Howard, who was entering his second season.\n\n“I was the only frontcourt player, last man standing so I had to raise my level of play,” Howard said. “I’ve always been able to do that because I’m a team player. I’m a guy that does whatever to help the team and I sacrifice, and I don’t mind what role it is. I’m more of a giver.”\n\nHoward would average 22.1 points and 8.1 rebounds, which earned the only All-Star Game appearance of his career and third-team All-NBA honors.\n\nWhen Webber returned the following season, he re-assumed the top role — just like it was when the duo were members of the Fab Five.\n\nHoward recalled the criticism when he became the first player to sign a contract worth at least $100 million the following offseason.\n\n“When Webber was more of a go-to guy on our team, so I sat back, embraced my role of being the No. 2 or No. 3 guy,” Howard said. “I was still consistently delivering the same results.”\n\nThis is not Canada\n\nWith the NBA playing its first game in Mexico City in 1992, Abdenour, who was Pistons' trainer, noticed the stark differences in the two different cultures.\n\n“You don’t think of Toronto as a foreign experience and yet it is a foreign country,” Abdenour said. “When you think of Mexico, it is a foreign experience because we’re so far north of the Mexican border that we don’t realize folks in California roll into Mexico like we roll into Canada.\n\n“You knew there was a cultural difference. Language wasn’t a barrier, but it was something you had to deal with.”\n\nThe team spent the night in Mexico City before departing right after the game.\n\n“The people down there were tremendous, really good hosts, really enjoyed us being down there,” Abdenour said.\n\nThe NBA began playing regular-season games in Mexico City in 1997, and this will be the first time for a doubleheader. The San Antonio Spurs and Phoenix Suns will play Saturday in the 30th NBA game held in Mexico City.\n\nBecause it’s in the books as a Pistons home game, the team is responsible for providing game-day operations staff, and some members of the Pistons entertainment team will perform.\n\n“The NBA comes to us and says do you want to be the home team, and we agreed,” Pistons spokesman Kevin Grigg said.\n\nThe Pistons lose one of their 41 home gates, but the league makes the team whole for any lost revenue.\n\nMexico City Arena is impressive, and seats 22,300.\n\nThe Pistons practiced Wednesday and conducted a basketball camp for youths afterward.\n\nAbdenour and Pistons chief of staff Andrew Loomis conduced a site inspection in May before the agreement — it is their fourth time participating in the NBA Global Games program. The previous appearance was in 2013, when the Pistons lost to the New York Knicks in London.\n\n“This place is massive,” Abdenour said. “It will have 22,000 screaming NBA fans and I’m looking forward to the whole thing.\""
