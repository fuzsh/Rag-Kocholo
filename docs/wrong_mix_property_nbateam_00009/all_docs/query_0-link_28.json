Simple basketball,\" said Wallace, who also stayed out of the foul trouble which has plagued him in the series.\n\nThe Pistons had led 41-39 at half-time in by far the most physical game of the series so far.\n\n\"We kept them out on the perimetre and put ourselves in a position where we didn't have to foul Shaq late in the game,\" said Pistons coach Larry Brown.\n\nKarl Malone started for the Lakers but played little after the first quarter due to his right knee injury.\n\nBryant struggled all game with his shooting, going 8-for-25, but nailed a three-pointer with 1.9 seconds left to pull the Lakers within two points at the half.\n\nGary Payton scored six points in the first quarter but added just two in the second half.\n\nDetroit shot just 42.6% but capitalised on the Lakers' 35 fouls.\n\n\"In the first half they would have been out of the game if they didn't get to the free-throw line,\" said Lakers coach Phil Jackson."
