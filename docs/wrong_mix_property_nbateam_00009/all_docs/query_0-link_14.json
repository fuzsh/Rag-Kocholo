        "text": "Seven go-karts roared around the Novi track Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe race was never in doubt — the No. 6 car dusted all six pursuers.\n\nBut the outing at JD Racing wasn’t about competition.\n\nIt was a moment of celebration.\n\nThe Pistons Gaming Team was enjoying downtime after clinching a playoff spot in the inaugural season of the NBA’s esports league.\n\nAfter wrapping up at the track — gamer Fred Mendoza took the flag — Pistons GT esports manager Adam Rubin and the organization was going to treat the team to a bowling outing.\n\nNot exactly a Champagne bath, but when the NBA 2K team won’t have another off day until its playoff journey ends, team members will take it.\n\nThe berth represents validation for Rubin, who devised the team’s draft strategy.\n\nHe was confident the team — which sits third at 9-4 in the 17-team league with one week remaining in the regular season — would be good.\n\nBut he didn’t feel vindication.\n\nHe felt relief — and he thinks the best is yet to come.\n\n“We've learned — and I constantly remind them — that we still have yet to play our best game without any mistakes and it's going to come a time where they all click at the right time,” Rubin said.\n\nRising to occasion\n\nThe Pistons were struggling to seal the spot.\n\nIn their first chance to clinch on Saturday, second-place Philadelphia 76ers crushed Pistons GT by 24 points at the league’s New York City studio where games are played each weekend.\n\nThe team had a second chance against Orlando Magic Gaming, which sits in fifth place.\n\nThe teams were locked in a tight game when a member of the Magic trash talked the Pistons’ best player, power forward Ramo Radoncic.\n\nIt was on.\n\n“That kind of got me riled up,” Radoncic said. “I wanted this even badder than I did before so I had to make the next big play.”\n\nAnd when one his teammates nailed a key 3-pointer, Radocic let the Magic player hear about it.\n\n“You talking?” he taunted.\n\n“That was basically the play of the game. The whole game was a dogfight, especially in that fourth quarter. Just to get that win was so much adrenaline, so much emotion for all of us.”\n\nIt was extra special for Radoncic because his older brother was there to watch. Radoncic and his family are from Brooklyn.\n\nAfter the game, social media started promoting Radoncic for the league’s first MVP award.\n\nRubin promoted Radoncic’s candidacy, citing how the four players selected before him in the inaugural draft will likely fail to lead their teams to the playoffs.\n\nRadoncic, 26, who is among the league leaders, averaging nearly 20 points, 9.6 rebounds and nearly two steals per game, isn’t worried about individual goals.\n\n“It would be an honor to be the MVP of the league,” Radoncic said. “It just lets you know you’re one of the top players in the league.\n\n“Honestly, I don’t care about it too much. I just want to win the championship. That’s the main goal.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe Pistons have a chance at gaining the second seed of the eight-team postseason, which begins Aug. 17.\n\nAt 9-4, they are tied with the 76ers, who hold the tiebreaker.\n\nThe Pistons finish Friday against the lowly Golden State Warriors (yeah, that’s right) Gaming Squad (2-10).\n\nThe 76ers face the Utah Jazz Gaming in the game before the Pistons’, so the game could hold meaning.\n\nThe quarterfinals will be single-elimination, while the semifinals and league finals will be best of three.\n\nThe entire prize pool for the playoffs is $600,000 and the champion receives $300,000.\n\nA nice potential bonus for the players, who are under contract for six months and salaries of more than $30,000.\n\nThe league hasn’t determined how it will approach expansion and how franchises will be able to protect top players.\n\nThe players, who gathered as strangers in April shortly after the draft, will head home as close friends. The players share two residences.\n\nSome left steady jobs. Mendoza said recently he will earn money via ridesharing when he returns to the Washington, D.C area.\n\nBut it might be a short break.\n\nRubin said the league is also exploring an earlier start to next season after the first season kicked off in May — maybe as early as January.\n\nAn earlier start would allow for seasons to more closely align with the release of NBA 2K, which occurs annually in September.\n\nIt would also allow for players to feel more part of organizations with infrastructure designed to be active during the regular NBA season.\n\nBut first, there’s a title to win.\n\nRadoncic said Pistons vice chairman Arn Tellem has promised a special memento.\n\nTellem will get Radoncic a championship belt — Rasheed Wallace-style — if the team can win it all. Tellem confirmed this via text.\n\nRadoncic told Tellem he likes to talk trash — kind of like Wallace when he was starring for the Pistons.\n\nWallace would wear a title belt after the Pistons won the 2004 NBA title.\n\n“He told me he was going to get me the Rasheed Wallace belt,” Radoncic said. “He told me if you win, I promise I can get you that belt. That’s an add on right there.”\n\nFollow Vince Ellis on Twitter @vincent_ellis56. Download our Pistons Xtra app on iTunes or Android!"
