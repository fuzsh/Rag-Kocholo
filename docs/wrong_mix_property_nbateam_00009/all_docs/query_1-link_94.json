        "text": "Persons with first-hand knowledge of the organizations’ plans confirmed today that Chauncey Billups and Ben Wallace will have their numbers retired at two separate game-night ceremonies later this season. […] The plans have been in the works for some time, and Billups (No. 1) and Wallace (No. 3) were officially informed the past few days.\n\nBefore (he was traded in November 2008 for Allen Iverson), Billups, 39, was the unquestioned leader of the team and was the MVP of the 2004 Finals. […] The Pistons’ decline can be traced to the day he was traded to the Denver Nuggets and the news comes with the current Pistons generating excitement because of a 2-0 start.\n\nIf Billups was the leader, Wallace, 41, was the heart of that group of Pistons. The defensive anchor of a team that smothered opposing attacks, “Big Ben” was a four-time Defensive Player of the Year. […]Reggie Jackson currently wears Billups’ No. 1; rookie Stanley Johnson wears Wallace’s No. 3."
