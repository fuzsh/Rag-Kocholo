Sign up for it here, or by using the form below.\n\nWelcome to the Pistons Pivot Newsletter, our newest ClickOnDetroit offering for Pistons fans!\n\nI‚Äôm Ken. I write a bunch of newsletters here at ClickOnDetroit, but I‚Äôm an avid basketball fan. So this will be a little extra special for me. We‚Äôll send this periodically with some breaking news, analysis -- maybe a rant or two. If this is something you‚Äôd enjoy, welcome aboard! If not, you can manage your subscription right here.\n\nüèÜ Catching up with 2004 Pistons\n\nFor me, my biggest Detroit Pistons team is the 2004 championship squad. I know, the Bad Boys were amazing and I know all about them -- don‚Äôt you worry. But I didn‚Äôt get to watch them as they were winning.\n\nSo, the nostalgia takes me to the Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton era of Pistons basketball, commonly known as the ‚ÄúGoing to Work‚Äù era, a product of the Bad Boys Pistons era.\n\nI often end up going down a rabbit hole with athletes, wondering what happened to them, where they ended up, and so on. So, I figured, let‚Äôs take a look: Where are key members of the 2004 Pistons team now?"
