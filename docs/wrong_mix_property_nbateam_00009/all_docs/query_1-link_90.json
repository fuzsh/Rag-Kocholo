        "text": "Rasheed Wallace had a lot to dish about when he appeared on Underdog NBA. But you couldn’t let ‘Sheed’ go without talking about his dirtiest technical fouls. The former Bad Boy Piston was an instigator of technical fouls, deserved and undeserved. He’s one of the NBA players with the most techs in history and even inspired the NBA to alter rules because of his behavior.\n\nThe host of Underdog NBA even recalled that the NBA player would instigate the referee to call it just to rile up his teammates and opponents. So they had to talk about one of his most infamous calls from the 2004 NBA Finals.\n\nRasheed Wallace instigated a foul in the 2004 Finals\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nCurrent NBA players couldn’t get away with the on-court antics Rasheed Wallace used to pull. He holds the record for the most single-season technical fouls in NBA history, with 41 technicals in the 2000-01 season. The 48-year-old retired with 317 techs on his record, third in NBA history after Charles Barkley and Karl Malone.\n\nHe had so many fouls and ejections in every game that the NBA enforced a rule change in 2006, which suspended a pro if they received more than 16 technical fouls in a season.\n\nREAD MORE: Former NBA Champ Overawes At Dwyane Wade While Turning Back The Clock To “A Hell Of A” Time\n\nThat never stopped Wallace from being his intensely expressive self. Underdog NBA relived one of his dirtiest fouls during the 2004 NBA Finals from Wallace’s perspective. It happened during on June 13, when Wallace and the Detroit Pistons were up against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nTempers flared that day and Wallace was in a foul mood (pun intended). Even Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal were picking up technical fouls. As he watched that game during the interview, Wallace narrated what went through his mind during his on-court altercation with Slava Medvedenko during that game.\n\nDuring the game, Wallace was called for a foul after Medvedenko’s elbow apparently hit him and they got in each other’s faces. “I’m not gonna play you dirty so don’t try to play me dirty right there. And then boom shot me a little elbow.”\n\nHe’s doubling down on that point today. He said he can’t stand “playing dirty,” which he claims Medvedenko did. So he said, “I was like all right and I told the rest I said ‘I’m gonna make y’all call this foul now, y’all want to call that ticky-tack on me I’m gonna make y’all call it.’”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAnd he did make them call it.\n\nWallace hit the Lakers Hard\n\nAfter the initial altercation with Medvedenko, Rasheed was out for blood. He called what Slava did “unnecessary” right after the game and wanted to go after Malone, but had this young Laker on him, which seemed to infuriate Wallace. He also claims the Lakers were targeting him because he was hot-headed on the court.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n‘Sheed’ used that anger to lead the team to victory. The Pistons won 88-80 over the Lakers. Yet Wallace wasn’t having the last laugh, though. He carried that sour mood even through the celebration. Just proves you can’t out-foul Rasheed Wallace."
