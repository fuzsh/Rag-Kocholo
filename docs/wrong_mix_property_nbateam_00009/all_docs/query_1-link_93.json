They have high hopes for both Cade Cunningham and Jalen Duren, and Monty Williams already seems to have this team pointed in the right direction, but it‚Äôs very early.\n\nüñ•Ô∏è Watch this full episode on YouTube\n\nCheck out the rest of the Yahoo Sports podcast family at https://apple.co/3zEuTQj or at Yahoo Sports Podcasts\n\nThis article contains affiliate links; if you click such a link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission."
