        "text": "Rasheed Wallace may be headed back to the NBA.\n\nThe four-time All-Star and former Portland Trail Blazers big man could join the coaching staff of new Los Angeles Lakers head coach Darvin Ham, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic.\n\nAfter initially reporting Wallace agreed to a deal with the Lakers, Charania made a correction later Monday to say he is a candidate to join the staff. The two sides have not connected on a contract yet.\n\nHam confirmed Wallace is a candidate to join his coaching staff at his introductory press conference with the Lakers this afternoon.\n\nWallace, who played alongside Ham with the Detroit Pistons, spent part of last season as an assistant coach under Penny Hardaway at the University of Memphis. Wallace and Ham are familiar friends, as they won an NBA title together (ironically against the Lakers) with the Pistons under head coach Larry Brown in 2004.\n\nHardaway told the Commercial Appeal on Monday that Wallace’s plan from the beginning was to join Ham all along.\n\n“I think Rasheed might be going to LA with Darvin Ham. That was the deal from the beginning,” Hardaway said. “If Darvin had gotten a job last year, Rasheed had already promised him that he was going to go with him. So, I’m thinking this year, with him getting the Lakers job, (Wallace) might still be going along with that process.”\n\nAssuming the two sides work out a deal, this is the second time Wallace will join the NBA coaching sidelines. He previously served as an assistant for the Pistons in 2013-14 after retiring.\n\nWallace, 47, played 16 seasons in the NBA after starring at the University of North Carolina. He played for Washington, Portland, Atlanta, Detroit, Boston, and New York during his career.\n\n- Aron Yohannes"
