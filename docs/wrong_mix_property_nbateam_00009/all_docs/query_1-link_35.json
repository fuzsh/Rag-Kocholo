        "text": "FLINT, MI - A forest green Ford Bronco, with North Carolina plates, arrived at Dion's Party Store Friday afternoon - with three truckloads full of fresh water.\n\nA massive 6-foot-11, 42-year-old man was behind the wheel.\n\nOnce he opened the door, everyone in the concrete parking lot quickly identified Rasheed Wallace, the former Detroit Pistons star.\n\nBut the retired NBA veteran didn't waste much time to stand around and chat.\n\nHe quickly got to work, as the large group trailed him to deliver water, baby needs and other supplies door-to-door to a pair of low-incoming housing apartments on the north side, helping residents because of the city's ongoing water quality issues.\n\n\"We don't do all this media coverage and all,\" Wallace said. \"It's not for that. Why? Because after the media leaves, who is still here? The people.\"\n\nWallace partnered with the New Era Detroit community activist group to orchestrate the most recent trip.\n\nThis wasn't his first visit to Flint, though.\n\nLast summer, he personally delivered water with ESPN's Rachel Nichols and former NBA player Stephen Jackson. He also donated water to a local church with former Toronto Raptor and Flint native Morris Peterson on another occasion.\n\nIn October, he penned a fiery letter to The Players' Tribune titled \"The Truth About Flint\" where he urged others not to forget about the problems people are facing in the city.\n\n\"The sh*t don't stop. It was in national news for about a week or two, but after that it died out,\" Wallace said. \"It's the same thing people do ... outta sight outta mind with a whole bunch of everyday news - or you get a lot of BS news to try to mask the real problems of what's going on.\n\n\"But nah, it's not stopping up here for us.\"\n\nWallace was joined by Detroit's one-time NBA All-Star Derrick Coleman and a host of other volunteers from Motown, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Charlotte.\n\n\"When I look at the people in Flint, I see myself,\" Coleman said. \"It's about helping and caring for people who can't do for themselves. We're going to always keep a light on what's going on in Flint.\"\n\nStore owner Dion Savage Jr. was overjoyed by the strong support of the former athletes, but doesn't plan on stopping with this one event.\n\nSince Savage reopened the store in March of 2016, he has hosted free food giveaways and is planning to start his own boxing promotional company with a gym on the vacant side of the store.\n\n\"Dealing with this community we just have to be persistent with it,\" Savage said. \"It's a good outlook.\n\n\"We're so used to hating one another, so it's going to take a process of learning how to love one another all over again. So it has to be consistent and continuously showing love to one another, and that's what will bring a change to the community.\""
