        "text": "The Detroit Pistons fired head coach Maurice Cheeks on Sunday following a 21-29 start to the season.\n\nWith a roster made up of talented players like Brandon Jennings, Josh Smith, Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond, the Pistons were supposed to contend for one of the top playoff spots in the East. Instead, they spent the first 50 games dragging their feet and it resulted in Cheeks losing his job.\n\nMORE: All-Star Game jerseys through the years | ASG rosters | Rising Stars rosters\n\nWhile no replacement coach has been named, there are early reports that former Memphis Grizzlies head coach Lionel Hollins could be targeted to replace Cheeks.\n\nBut Piston fans have someone in particular that they would like to see as the next head coach.\n\nAccording to an official petition on the White House's government site, Detroit fans want former player and current assistant coach Rasheed Wallace to be the next man in charge of the Pistons.\n\nWallace would certainly be a fun choice for the fans, but the former power forward has less than a season worth of experience as an assistant coach.\n\nWe've already seen how difficult it has been for Jason Kidd to handle the rigors of being a head coach without any formal experience, and while Wallace may be able to win over the players with his energy and passion, he is probably not the right man to turn this sinking ship around.\n\nBut it would be fun, and right now, there is nothing fun about the Detroit Pistons."
