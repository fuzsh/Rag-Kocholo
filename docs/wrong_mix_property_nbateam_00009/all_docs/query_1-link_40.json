        "text": "Rasheed Wallace, a former NBA player known for his emphasis on defense, recently shed light on how the NBA changed its rules after the Detroit Pistons secured the 2004 NBA title against the Los Angeles Lakers. Wallace, a key player for the Pistons during that championship run, believes that the league implemented rule changes to discourage the kind of defensive strategies employed by his team.\n\n\"We hung our hat on defense, and instead of trying to make it better, they implemented new defensive rules to make this sh** worse for us. No more hand checking, no more forearm checking, and this and that.\n\n\"They changed it that next year after we won. They changed a lot of them rules. We were bad for business.\"\n\n\"Everybody tuning in to see dunks and three-pointers. We ain't going for none of that sh**.\"\n\n\"We ain't letting you get no dunks. We ain't letting you get no threes. If I know that you getting a dunk or hitting a three is going to spark your team? We cutting that. We ain't going for that.\"\n\n(1:08:15)\n\nThe 2004 Pistons, often celebrated for their defensive prowess, prioritized preventing opponents from executing highlight-reel dunks and three-pointers, tactics commonly associated with sparking momentum for opposing teams.\n\nIn the current era of basketball, the emphasis on defense has diminished compared to the past. The rule changes, initiated in response to teams like the Pistons, were aimed at creating a more free-flowing and high-scoring game to cater to the preferences of basketball fans. Despite the changes, Wallace remains proud of the defensive identity that defined the 2004 Pistons team.\n\nThe 2004 Pistons Would Be Ashamed Of The 2024 Pistons\n\nThe stark contrast between the 2004 Detroit Pistons and the 2024 Pistons is a testament to the drastic changes the franchise has undergone over the years, with the latter leaving much to be desired. In terms of defensive performance, the 2024 Pistons are a far cry from the defensive juggernaut that characterized the 2004 Pistons.\n\nThe defensive ratings tell a telling story – the 2004 Pistons boasted the second-best defensive rating in the league at an impressive 93.9, showcasing their ability to stifle opponents effectively. In contrast, the 2024 Pistons find themselves languishing with the 28th worst defensive rating, a glaring 120.7, highlighting a significant defensive deficiency.\n\nNet ratings further emphasize the disparity. The 2004 Pistons held the second-best net rating at a commendable 6.5, indicative of their overall effectiveness on both ends of the court. Conversely, the 2024 Pistons are saddled with the second-worst net rating, a dismal -11.2, underscoring their struggles on both offense and defense.\n\nThe 2003-04 Pistons clinched the third-best record in the Eastern Conference with an impressive 54-28 record. Fast forward to the 2024 Pistons, and their record is nothing short of disastrous – a mere 3-36 as of the third week of January. The team's recent achievement, or rather, the dubious distinction of enduring the worst single-season losing streak with 28 consecutive losses, further amplifies the team's struggles.\n\nThe stars of the 2004 Pistons, including defensive stalwarts Ben Wallace and Rasheed Wallace, along with offensive catalysts Rip Hamilton and Chauncey Billups, would likely look upon the current state of the franchise with a sense of disappointment and even shame.\n\nWhile no one expected an exact replication of the 2004 glory, the stark contrast in performance levels leaves fans and former players alike disheartened by the current state of the once-proud Pistons."
