        "text": "Pontiac — Ex-Piston Rasheed Abdul Wallace is back on the court — Oakland Circuit Court, that is.\n\nThe ex-wife of the 7-foot-tall Wallace, a fan favorite here for six seasons, is seeking to overturn a divorce decree Wallace won this month in North Carolina.\n\nFatima Labretta Wallace says the state Wallace claims as his home lacks jurisdiction on whether to grant the divorce. She’s also challenging whether Wallace even lives in North Carolina, where he’s building a home and owns a house his mother lives in.\n\nFatima Wallace says her ex-husband’s driver’s license, bank account and tax returns are all in Michigan. And he has been living in a rented Troy apartment since September 2013, she claims.\n\nWallace left his wife in 2013 and both filed divorce papers last year, he in North Carolina, she in Oakland County. His net worth from his professional basketball career and real estate and other investments is an estimated at $75 million.\n\n“Our marriage became seriously troubled in 2013 and our separation began in February 2013 when, after retiring from the New York Knicks, Rasheed failed to return home to Michigan, would not talk to me and would communicate only by text over cellphone,” Fatima Wallace said in a 2014 affidavit filed in Oakland Circuit Court.\n\nAccording to filings, Fatima Wallace also seeks to have a July 1998 prenuptial agreement she signed on their wedding day declared invalid because it was “procured by fraud”; it allegedly misrepresented terms and undervalued her husband’s financials; and she was counseled into signing by an attorney being paid by her husband. She is asking the court for a “fair division” of the estate.\n\n“(Wallace) is a very nice man who has been very generous to her and to his children,” said attorney Richard S. Victor, who, along with Gerald Cavellier, is representing the ex-Piston.\n\n“There have been several misstatements of fact in this matter,” Victor said.\n\nFatima Wallace and the couple’s two children, a 10-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son, have lived in a 19,000-square-foot house in Rochester Hills for more than a decade.\n\nUnemployed, Wallace lives in North Carolina when his children are not in his custody, Cavellier said.\n\nFatima Wallace’s attorney, Henry Baskin, described the civil case as “a complicated divorce proceeding.”\n\n“The history of the marriage is they were married in Pennsylvania, moved to Baltimore when he was with the (Washington) Bullets, then to Oregon where he played with the Portland Trail Blazers,” Baskin said.\n\n“He was traded to Detroit and moved to Rochester Hills. After 10 years, he went to Boston but she and the children stayed here. He went on to play briefly in New York and then returned to work with the Pistons (as an assistant coach until last year).”\n\n‘Classic case’\n\nRobert Sedler, a professor of constitutional law at Wayne State University Law School, described the elements of the Wallace situation as a “classic case” of due process and jurisdictional law with Michigan being the marital state where decisions must ultimately be made concerning physical child custody, support, any and all property division and the validity of any prenuptial agreement\n\n“If it can be established one party moved to North Carolina and established a domicile there, then North Carolina can grant the divorce but nothing else,” Sedler said.\n\n“Since (residency) is being challenged by one party who remained here and there was an earlier custody decree in Michigan then that, along with all the other issues, will ultimately be decided by Michigan law and a Michigan court.”\n\nThe Wallace estate is substantial, according to court filings.\n\nIt includes property in several states; a monthly budget of $150,000 to $200,000 for property payments and maintenance; automobile payments; insurance premiums; private school and college expenses; and living and personal expenses. Fatima Wallace is also provided $10,000 a month in interim support.\n\nHis attorneys also stressed any prenuptial agreement between the couple had been discussed and negotiated “for weeks” before their wedding, and there was no conflict of interest concerning attorneys who were involved in the pact.\n\nIn court filings, Wallace indicated his ex-wife is living with a boyfriend. His attorneys declined to comment on that other than to say the couple separated four years ago. The confidential prenuptial agreement states cohabitation is a termination provision of financial support, according to court documents.\n\nMediation scheduled\n\nEvents in the pending dispute span Wallace’s 16-year NBA career and his play with several teams, including the Pistons (2004-09) where he helped lead them to a National Basketball League championship and six successive Eastern Conference Finals. He returned to Detroit as an assistant coach in 2013 for one year but was not rehired by the team’s current coach, Stan Van Gundy.\n\nWallace, a four-time NBA All-Star and the league’s all-time leader in technical fouls, is unemployed. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and played on the basketball team from 1993-95.\n\nThe 2014 Oakland Circuit filing is assigned to Judge Lisa Langton. Baskin said both sides agreed to mediation to begin Feb. 11. A pretrial date has been set for March 26.\n\nMediation will include the validity of the prenuptial agreement, child custody, parenting time and support, as well as the question of jurisdiction of North Carolina versus Michigan, according to court documents.\n\nFatima Wallace indicates in filings she has no objection to joint custody of their minor child provided Wallace agrees not to consume non-prescription drugs or prescription drugs without a doctor’s instructions, and will not drive with the child in the car within four hours after consuming alcohol.\n\nVictor said implications of drug or alcohol use were addressed in a court hearing in December before Judge Lisa Gorcyca, who was assigned the case prior to Langton.\n\n“These were found not to be issues,” Victor said.\n\nmmartindale@detroitnews.com\n\n(248) 338-0319"
