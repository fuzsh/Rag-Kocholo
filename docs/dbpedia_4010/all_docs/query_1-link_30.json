        "text": "Mill’s thanks for the donation are expressed in lavish terms: the gift is a “…strangely kind instance of your Lordships goodness and Friendship to me, (for so I shall ever account it, as long as I live, and take care to register it to Posterity)” and he prays that “God continue your Lordship’s Life and health for ye perfecting your excellent and Public Designs.”\n\nFittingly in response to a gift to the Hall Library, Mill focuses on the Bishop’s own project to build a new Cathedral Library in Carlisle, which had recently been completed in 1691. This is, Mill says, “as useful and considerable a Benefaction, as your Lordship could have thought upon” and “the best method of benefaction I know in the world.”\n\nIn his praise he makes several points. One thought, that the Library will be a “growing thing and will always improve” as members of the Cathedral Chapter will donate books and also that it is easier to convince people to give books over money (“for every body has a book for the Public, though they can spare no money”), is notable in terms of the way the Hall’s own Library mostly grew from Aularian donations. Mill also stresses the importance of the establishment of the Library as a public good and mark of distinguishment for the Cathedral: “a Library is a thing that will universally please; and at all public times of Assizes & Sessions, will reflect an honor not only upon your Lordships memory, which I am sure is the least thing you mind, but upon our Church and Religion.” Again, it is interesting to consider this alongside the motives of Stephen Penton in the construction of Hall’s Chapel and Library which were completed under Mill. The last sentiment of praise in the letter is perhaps more unfortunate. Mill enthuses that even “if Irreligion and Atheism should prevail even to ye demolishing our Cathedrals, yet a Library will be safe. Fanatics and Pagans will be ambitious to save that.” As the medieval Cathedral Library had been destroyed by Parliamentary forces during the Civil War, this is, to say the least, tactless.\n\nAlso in 1697, when Thomas Hearne compiled the first catalogues of the Old Library, the collection contained around 500 volumes, divided roughly 50-50 between large folio volumes and smaller quartos and octavos. We still hold the vast majority of these items and they are currently shelved in the same sequence of shelf marks as they were in the 1690s (another part of Emden’s re-organisation of 1931). Currently all of these books are on the lower floor shelves, however originally the large books were downstairs and the smaller in the gallery: “The lower part… contains only folio’s…There are five rowes of Shelves in the Gallery, which are designed for Quarto’s and Octavo’s”. As the drawing shows eight bays of shelves in the lower floor and ten in the gallery, one cannot help thinking that the shelves must have been rather bare."
