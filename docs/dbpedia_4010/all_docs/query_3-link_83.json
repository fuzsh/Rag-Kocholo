        "text": "XA.YING THE r OUNDA.TION-STONE OF THE\n\nROMAN CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL OF SC\n\nMARY.\n\nThe benediction and laying of the foundation-atone of St. Mary's\n\nBomui Catholic Cathedral, or at least of that portion of the in\n\ntended edifice which is at present in the coarse of erection, took\n\npiece on Tuesday, on, and immediately adjacent to, toe actual site\n\nof the old building. The principal part in the accustomed cere\n\nmony was, according to the Roman Pontifical, performed by tbe\n\nArchbishop, the Most Rev. John Bede Folding, who was assisted\n\nby hie suffragan prelates, the Roman Catholic Bishops of Mait\n\nland, Bathuret, Goulburn, and Eaos, by a large body of the\n\nclergy, and many thousands of the laity.\n\nIt is intended, for the present, to go on with the choir, tran\n\nsepts, and nave of this spacious and magnificent structure\n\nto the length of about 2.0 feet in the clear — so as ta\n\nfully complete tboee parts of the sew cathedral before\n\ncommencing the remaining portion towards Woolloomooloo\n\nstreet; and it ie not too much to state that the\n\nprogress of the work already made was yesterday found by the\n\npublic tc De sucli as luuy to jusuty the conclusion tnat it will\n\nnot be many years before such a completion must come to pass,\n\nand the church be ready for use. In regard to the exact position\n\nof the building, It may be proper to observe that what is com\n\nmonly called ' orientation ' has been altogether disregarded.\n\nFrom the necessities of tbe situation, arising chiefly out of the\n\ngreat size of the intended structure, the new cathedral of St.\n\nMary will f ange from north to south ; the choir being towards tbe\n\nnorth, and the western side of the church in the College-street\n\nline of frontage, lu entire length, when completed, will be 350\n\nfeet, its leait breadth being about '4 feet. Thus finished St.\n\nMary's will, it i« believed, be larger than either tbe cathedrals of\n\nChester, Rochester, Carlisle, Bristol, or Oxford, and not much In\n\nferior, in its dimensions, to the cathedrals of Hereford, and\n\nor Wells The portion it is proposed to immediately complete\n\nwill be of about tbe length of Carlisle Cathedral, and be very con\n\nsiderably larger than either of the cathedrals of Bristol and\n\nOxford.\n\nThe design (from the accomplished and experienced pencil of\n\nMr. W. W. Wardell, of Victoria), is cruciform in its general\n\nplan, and comprises a nave and aisles, two transepts and aisles,\n\nand a choir with (astern and western uielei One of the distin\n\nguishing features of the general design of the church will be its\n\nvn usual breadOi, in which it will bear a somewhat close analogy\n\nto the Cathedral of Lincoln. The entire length is to be about 350\n\nfeet, and the width, within the transepts, 118 feet ; the width\n\nacioeg the nave and aisles being about 74 feet between\n\nthe walls. It will, when fully complete, nearly occupy tbe\n\nentire length of the ground from fit Mary's Road to WooUoo\n\nmooloo-etreet. Viewed from the Domain gate, the northern front\n\n(in which there ie to be a very large altar window) will have a\n\nvery striking effect. Indeed, from the commanding situation\n\nwhich the Cathedral is to occupy, and the grandeur of the whole\n\ndesign. 6t. Mary's cannot fail to prove a most remarkable and\n\nBeautiful ornament to the city. The space within the choir\n\n?dotted for the high altar and sanctuary will be about forty-five\n\nfeet in length, and will be surrounded by the aieles and lateral\n\nchapels. Ine organ chamber is to be on the east side of the choir,\n\nand opining iron the choir uiel.s by pillars and arches, The\n\nnave, choir, and transepts will be about ninety feet in height from\n\ntliefloorof thecburoh and will be divided from the aiBles re\n\nrpFCiivcly by pillars end arches about Udrty-five feet in height.\n\nOver the aisles, and opening Into tbe nave, choir, and transepts\n\nthroughout, will be a triforium, and above the triforlum a spacious\n\nclerestory. There will, moreover, be a central tower or lantern at\n\nthe intersection of the nave and tmnecpts with a clear Interior\n\nheight from tbe floor of the churohof 120 feet; and at the\n\ncontbern end of tbe church, next Woolloomooloo-rtreet, there\n\nwill he two towen with spires, about 260 feet hi height. Oiring\n\nto the paramount moesslty for economising the expenditure as\n\njnuch as powlble-s nocestltv made still more urgent from the\n\ncost entailed by the extraordinary depths to which it m essential ?\n\nto fso 'fur fovBdutions — tbe erchitect bas. it is understood, been\n\ncompelled to abandon the Introduction of Btone vaulted oeillnirs,\n\nand to have recourse to the ordinary wooden roof. Tbe founds,\n\nlions, however, are Bo eoliily constructed that these vaulted\n\nceilings may yet be built, If it should be deemed desirable. Mr,\n\nJohn Young is the contractor for the works, which are being\n\ncarried out under the supervision o[ Mr. TbomlB Eves, the\n\ntteeident Clerk of tbe Works. The Architect, as we have already\n\nIntimated, is Mr. Wardell. Hr. Young's present contract will\n\ncarry ibe walls to the height of forty feet— about one-hull' of their\n\nintended height. It is impossible to speak too highly 67 the work,\n\nor of the material upon which it has been exhibited. The stones\n\nused have all been hewn out of the Fyrmonl Quarries ; of enor\n\nmous size without a single fault to be found in them— the very\n\nbest that could be got.\n\nIn addition to the cathedral proper, the design includes two\n\nlurpe sacristies, each tl feet by 20 feet, with strong room for\n\nchurch plate, and other necessary offices, a spacious chapter\n\nhouse, and a residence for tbe Archbishop. This will comprise\n\ntbe usual offices tor the Vicar-General anu Private Secretary, be\n\nsides accommodation fur the resident clergy, and the apartments\n\nfor the Arcbbisbop, libraries, domestic chapel, reception\n\nrooms, &c Tbe a- eign of tbe whole pile is of tbe early deco\n\nrate or geometrical period of painted architecture, and, though of\n\ntbe eimpleei character, bid; fair to realise a thoroughly cccle\n\npiutlfcal and commodious edifice, well suited to its purposes and\n\nnot unworthy of the Metropolitan city in these Australian cola\n\nnit s.\n\nTbe people began to assemble In tbe nortn-eastein portion\n\nof the tucloture of Et. Mary's shortly after 10 o'clock—\n\nin obedience to the summons of a iojful peal from\n\nthe belli of the Cathedral, wbicb are now hung in\n\nthe si.uih-wcstcrn tower, the only portion or the old\n\nmince that has not been utterly destroyed. From that hour to\n\ntot commencement of the service perions continued to anive in\n\nsreut numbers, until between two and three thousand persons\n\nmust have beeii present. To the northward of the exact site or\n\nthe luture bigh mur of tbe Church— marked by a cross standing\n\nabout twelve feet bigb— wub a large tent for the accommodation\n\nof tbe m~yor and aim-risen of the city, and numerous other gen\n\ntlemen, who bad bet n specially invited to attend. Amongdl tbe\n\nvast concourse who witnessed tbe ceremony were Mousieur L F.\n\nKii.tis (the French consul), Bcnor Don E. San Juat (tbe Spanish\n\nconsul), tbe Captain of the Marjeau, Captain Purcell, Mr.\n\nCropper, Hr. Justice Fauceit. the Hon. T. A. Marr.y,\n\nMr. W. B. JJullev, Mr. W.

Mr. Jere\n\nniiuh Donovan! Mr. JumiB Curtis, Mr. William Curtis. Mr. Kubie,\n\nMr. Jeremiah Moore, Mr. John Uourigan, Mr, M'Cirlhy, and\n\nruuny other gei'tienien and citizens taking an interest in Ibe cere\n\nmony. Tbe Most Rev. tbe Areubitbop, on bis arrival at the\n\nmod southernmost lent, was accompanied by Dr. Murray, the\n\nBubopolMnitland; Dr. M, Quiuu, tbe Bishop ol Bathurst ; Dr.\n\nLuDigiin, the Bisbop of Goulbuin; and Monsclgneur d'Enos, the\n\nVicar Apostolic of Uceanica. The Vicar-General (Dr. Sheeny) and\n\nabout bixty other priests of the archdiuce-se were also\n\npretext, and took part in tbe proceedings. The Archbishop\n\nand Blesops wtre vested with rochet, amice, alb, girdle, and\n\nstole, and wore white copes and mitres. Each prelate was accom\n\npanied by his chaplain. Tbe ruiiro and robes of the Archtmoop\n\n«tre magnificent in the extreme. Four or five of the principal\n\nclergy likewise wore copts, but mo&t of tbe priests appeared in\n\ntbeir catsocks and surplices. The cantors were the Vicar-General,\n\nand the Kcv. Messrs unyer, O'ConncU. and Quirk. These gen\n\ntlemen were assisted by Mr. Cordner, the organist of the\n\nCathedral.\n\nHiB Grace fully robed, and holding the crosier in his left hand,\n\nfirtt blested the salt and water in the appointed form, after which\n\ntbe cboir chanted the an'iptaon Signum calutls pone, and tbe\n\nPsalm Quam dilecta. This being ended, tbe Archbishop, stand\n\ning towards tbe place wbereon he had already spriBkled the\n\nwater which had been blessed, recited the prayer, ' O Lord\n\nGod, who, although the heaves and earth cannot con\n\ntain thce, tc.' In this prayer the name of tbe Virgin Mary\n\nwas expreesly mentioned as being that of tbe saint after whom\n\nthe church was to be called, and a blessing was invoked upon\n\ntbe place, and upon the work.\n\nThe Rev, Pabee Babsaxti preached an eloquent sermon in\n\nEnglish, taking for his text the 16th verse of the 28th chapter or\n\nIsaiah :— ' Therefore-, thus saith tbe Lord God : Behold I will\n\nlay a stone in the foundations of Ziou ; a tried stone, a corner\n\nstone, a precious stone, founded in the foundation He that\n\nbelieveth let bim not hasten.' The reverend preacher, although\n\ncalled upon to address a vast audience in a language wherein his\n\ndifficulties were obviously those of pronunciation alone, was\n\nlistened to throughout bis discourse with a breathless interest.\n\nBe began by informing bis hearers from what portion of the\n\nSacred Scriptures it was that he had selected his text, which\n\nthey would find in a chapter of the Prophecy of\n\nIsaiah ; a chapter sublime and deeply interesting to\n\nthem, and to all members of tbe Catboiic Church.\n\nThat chapter, he said, was sublime, interesting, and suggestive\n\nof elevated thoughts; and sublime, also interesting, and sigbiy\n\nsuggestive was that ceremony which they had begun, and were\n\nabout to complete upon that ever memorable day consecrated by\n\nthe Church to the Immaculate Conception of the ever Blessed\n\nMother of God. In the presence of tbeir beloved and venerable\n\nArchbishop, and of bis respected suffragan prelates, he was there\n\nto address a few words to them upon that occasion, and fervently\n\nhe prayed that God night cause the truth to sink deep into all\n\ntheir hearts. The laying of a foundation eurae to such an edifice\n\nas that wa6 no common task, but a work with sncha bigh object\n\ntbat the eye of faith might see much more in it than the mere\n\noutward act ; for by tbe thoughts which tbat outward act sug\n\ngested, they might find themselves readily furnished with argu\n\nments on behalf of their most holy religion, Tbe action of laying\n\nthe foundation stone of a church was something truly great\n\nand elevated; and their assembling for such an object\n\nwas naturally calculated to move their beans, to quicken their\n\nmemories, and to awaken their liveliest regrets. Who of them\n\nall, at such a time, could help turning himself back in thought to\n\ntbe old St. Mary's — the church where they had so often come to\n\nprey to Almighty God, and there to enjoy communion with Him\n\non earth, as He hod been pleased to provide. It was Impossible\n\nfor them to stand there and tot be carri d back to the high\n\nmasses at which it had be-n their privilege to be present, to tbe\n\nvespers, and to all the other ordinances of their Church, in which\n\nthey had in that edifice so long served their God. In the midst\n\nof the concourse of the faithful who were there wont to assemble\n\nfrom all pans of the country (like God's peopleof old), how\n\npleasant it was to spend one day of prayer and of praise. No;\n\nthey could not forget their old cathedral with its happy days, and\n\nits hallowed associations. But God's ways in his dealings\n\nwith man were inscrutable, they were not as our wayB ; a fire\n\nburst out and consumed tbat edifice, destroying what they loved\n\nso much in a few brief moments. It had been hard for them to\n\nsee the band of God in that, and yet it bad, most unquestionably,\n\nbees there. They, in the first anguish of their feelings under\n\ntbat blow, bad, indeed, deemed it a disastrous and most calamit\n\nous conflagration, but from henceforth let them rather esteem it\n\na happy fire, for from the flames of that fire blessings, through\n\nthe loving mercy of their God, bad arisen to fall upon the Catho\n\nlic Church throughout all the land. God, as tbe great St.\n\nAugustine hud well said, knew how to bring good out of evil,\n\nand it had been His will to do so in this present instance. The\n\nburning of St, Mary's Cathedral, although it had so grieved\n\nthem all to tbe very heart, bad been the means of furnishing\n\nproof of the kind feelings entenained for them by tnousands who\n\nwere cot with them in tbe unity of the faith, and by persons in\n\nhigh station and influence who were known to be of other re\n\nligions. And then, tbe calamity which hid occurred had, in God's\n\nprovidence, proved to be a means for the strengthening of their\n\nfaith and trust in bim. It had stirred them up to lend a ready\n\nsnd a liberal hand to the work that was set before them ; it had\n\nshewn them the greatness of the sacrifice demanded of them, and\n\ntbe true extent of tbeir Christian duty ; it bad exacted from the\n\nfaithful the willing admission that they were clearly called upon\n\nto erect another, more spacious and more beautiful structure than\n\nthat which the fire had consumed— a church more suitable to its\n\nintend d use, more worthy of the worship of Almighty God.\n\nThey were called upon to do ibis, too, in an infidel age ;\n\nas age in which the faith of some had waxed dim,\n\nwben tbe speculations of error were boldly put\n\nforth to be substituted for the unwavering reception\n\nof fundamental truth. The material constructions of the Church\n\nwere all correct and significant representatives of the Spiritual\n\nChurch of Christ. ' Behold I will lay a stone is the foundations\n\nof Sios, a tried Btone, a cornerstone, a precious Btone, founded ia\n\nthe foundation.' It was of that stone, of which St Peter and St.\n\nPaul had also spoken, that he desired to speak to them that day.\n\nChrist, our Lord, had been pleased to declare Himself in the\n\nHoly Scriptures to be a stone because there were some particular\n\nattributes of His Divine nature, ef which we could not otherwise\n\nhave been made fully aware, or have beep at all benefited by such\n\nknowledge, had He not so revealed Himself. St. Cvpriansaid\n\ntbat Christ was the Stone seen by tbe prophet Zacharias, upon\n\nwbich were seven eyes, which were the seven sacraments\n\nof ChriBt; a stone of wbich it was written:— 'I will\n\ngrave tbe graying thereof, saith the Lord of Hosts, and I will\n\ntake away the iniquity of tbat land in one day.' Christ was the\n\nstone prefigured by that upon which the wearied Patriarch Jacob\n\nreposed his bead, when he saw, as in a prophetic dream, a ladder\n\nreaching down to it from heaven, eo that the angels could descend\n\nand reascend thereby. Be, too, was the Stone upon which Moses\n\nwrote the tables ot tbe law, and presented them to the people of\n\nIsrael . It was by Him that we came to know the law, and it was\n\nin Him that we saw the law fulfilled unto a perfect obedience.\n\nHe, also, was the Bt/rae struck by Moses, from the striking of\n\nwhich came forth the waters of life, flowing freely for the refresh\n\nment of His people. Christ— said the) preacher— is that Stone\n\nwbich David, by faith, took out of a running stream, and with wbicb\n\nhe mortally wounded Goliath the great enemy of the people of\n\nGod ; for Christ is the glorious warrior, who, on our behalf, has\n\nstruck down the devil. He is the. stone that Josias set up as i\n\ntestimony unto the people of Israel for ever. He is the tried\n\netone, tbe cornerstone, the precious Btone — the foundation stone\n\nupon which rests all the superstructure of our Sion.\n\nTbe prcocker further proceeded to say that the text appeared\n\nto him to be as a frame, in wbich, like a picture, or like a mirror,\n\nwas presented to our view all the great truth b of the Catholic\n\nreligion. As a houEC could not stand without a solid and sure\n\nfoundation, so, of course, it was with the Church of Christ. The\n\nApostles were not primary, but secondary, stones in the Church ;\n\nthe primary stone was Christ, upon whom the whole fabric was\n\nicared. On Him, the great foundation stone, the first and the\n\nmost excellent, was the weight of the whole building imposed.\n\nIf this was so, bow blind must nottbose men be of tbo so-called\n\nll- formed Religion, who bad departed from tbe old faith— who\n\nhad abandoned tbe original and true foundation, — who bad at\n\ntempted to found their new structures without the clear sanction\n\nof a sew revelation. But tbat Church which was built upon\n\nChrist be its foundation must stand fast for ever, and those who\n\nbuilt upon any otber were only too like the foolish man who\n\nbuilt his bouse upon the sumi. Christ was not divided, and his\n\nChurch was one ; as He, Himself, had said: 'He that is not\n\nwith me is against me.' Our Lord had selected Peter\n\nfrom amongst bis disciples to represent him ; it was\n\nto St. Teter that he bad given tbe keys or heaven ;\n\nit was to. bim that He bad promised that His Church should\n\ncontinue to stand to tbe end of time. It was St. Peter also who\n\nbad been appointed to feed Christ's sheep and lambs. Our Lord\n\nhad appointed Peter to be tbe representative of Him, the\n\nprimary stone. When Cbriet bad said u to Peter, ' Tbou art\n\nPeter, and upon this rock will I build tny Church,' He spoke\n\nnot merely to that first of the apostles, but to all the Roman\n\nPontiffs who should come after that apostle, succeeding him in\n\nn gulur und uninterrupted succession in the chair of St. Peter.\n\nEach one of these, in bis turn, bad been primary stones re\n\npresenting. Christ, the great primary stone upon which\n\nthey all rested ; neither wind nor wave could ever sweep\n\nwhat bad been to fitly builded away. It was\n\nestablished on a rock, raised upon a foundation that could not be\n\nother tban secure. But tbe enemies of Christ denied the truth of\n\nthis y and sot only did His open enemies do so, but even amongrt\n\ntbe faithful there were those who were thus being led astray.\n\nThey must do as they listed, but for all this they would, most\n\nassuredly, be brought unto judgment.\n\nIn hi- text, Chrirt was spoken of is three different terms— as\n\nthe 'tried' stone, as the 'corner' stone, and as the 'pre-\n\ncious' stone. He would touch upon tbe first two of these some\n\nwhat briefly, that he might have tbe more lime to insist upon the\n\nthird. The preacher here proceeded to print out that in tbe days\n\nof the old low there was tbe Jew and tbe Gentile— tbe one the\n\nelect of God; the other, tbe reprobate and cast\n\naway. Christ had changed all that— for he came into\n\ntbe world to save the Jew and tbe Gentile alike.\n\nChiist in his body bad united the Jew and tbe Gentile together,\n\nand bad given to both an equal right to the blessings which He\n\ncame to dispense. Christ became tbe Father of all that believed\n\nin Him, whether Jew or Gentile. But the Jews had rejected\n\nOur Bleeeed Lord, and then He bud turned to tbe Gentiles.\n\nTruly He was tbe tried stone, the sacred and tbe mystical stone\n\n—the stone tbat bad been beth rejected and eboten— tbe great\n\ncorner stone upon which rested the whole weight of tbe Church\n\nof God But Christ was, moreover, called a '? precious' stone\n\nbecause hi Him were united the two natures— tho nature of God\n\nand the nature of man, In Els body (suca a« He wag\n\npleased to take upon him) there was to be seen tbe\n\nwonderful union of two natures, and therefore He wu,\n\nby a figure, called tnePrrdous Stone. Christ wu also the Living\n\nBtone, or the Btone of Life, having light and life in himself, and\n\nbring the author of light and life for others. By a similar\n\nfigure St. P.ul also spoke of Christians as 'living stones.'\n\nCbriet was indei d tbe tried stone, a etone rejected by the builders.\n\nVi bat had not the Wicked One done since He was made manifest\n\nin ibis world to ussbuU the strength of our mystical 8ion ! Toe\n\nJtws at Jerusalem had tried the myetical stone ; they had rejected\n\nit. and with bitter revilings had crucified the Lord of Glory.\n\nThen csme tie cruel persecutions of the Pagans tgsinst the\n\nearly Church ; then the simibarbariNn and immorality of several\n\nsuccreduig ages ; then the so-called Reformations of England and\n\nof Germany in the 16th ccstury, and lastly the wide-spread in\n\nfidelity of the present cay. All these things had, in succession,\n\neortlv tiled the Head Corner Stone, but still it stood in its place\n\nunchangeable and unchanged.\n\nTbe rev. preacher next proceeded to refer at some considerable\n\nkrgth. to the mystery of the dream of tbe King of Babylon,\n\nepi dally reveal* d to ibe prophet Daniel, as recorded in the second\n\nchapter of Daniel He described to his hearers, in animated\n\ntiims, the terrible statue of gold, silver, brass, iron, and da;,\n\nand expatiated upon the destruction of that sym\n\nbolical colossus by 'a stone cut without hands.' Daniel\n\nsaid tbat the stone had struck the statue on\n\nthe fret that were made of iron and day, and broke then all to\n\n, iices— tbe destruction so caused continuing until the whole\n\nstatue was broken up and swept away, the stsne which bod\n\nstruck that emblem becoming a mountain, filling the whole earth,\n\nTbe learned divine argued tbat this stone wa* also Christ, who\n\nshould put all things beneath Dim and reign over tbe whole\n\nearth, utterly destroying thd unsightly and incongruously cotn\n\npoundid Colossus of Error, Wicked and fo-illub were those\n\nsectarians and ucbelie.era who attempted to establish the\n\nreign of their delusions on the vainly expected fall of the\n\nkingdom of Christ. Whosoever should full upon that\n\nsioi/e it would hurt bim ; but upon whomsoever that st me\n\nshould fall it would grind bim to powder. There was neither\n\nxniebt, nor power, nor strength against tbe Lion of Juelah.\n\nTbe preacher farther explained that the 'Stone cut without\n\nbands,' was clearly meant for Christ,— who of his own free will,\n\nand moved only by his love to man, took upon him our nature,\n\nand assumed the task of our redemption. Tbe rev. father here\n\nmade a pointed allusion to tue dogma of tbe Roman Catholic\n\nChurch, to which tbat day was specially consecrated, and spoke\n\nin tloquent terms ef tbe happiness enjoyed by the Archbishop\n\non that day. Surrounded by his suffragan bishops, the\n\nbeloved representative of tbe representative of Christ, tbe Arch\n\nbirhop might, after that day, almost exclaim with Simeon,\n\n' Lord, now let thy servant depart it pence, according to thy\n\nword, tor mine eyes bava seen thy salvation.' ^2?ne Benson\n\nconcluded with a very striking appeal to all the members of the\n\nKoman Catholic Church then present, iuviting them to come\n\nforward with liberal contributions. To them who rightly\n\nbelieved in Cnritt, tbat Stone of wbich he had spoken was given\n\nfor life and for salvation ; but to them who believed not, that\n\nnone was no means of strength, but a stumbling block, and a\n\nrock of perdition.\n\nTbe h in on being ended, Mr, Robert Coveny and Mr. James\n\nMullins approached the Archbishop, and on behalf of the com\n\nn litre (as the honorary treasurers of tbe same) presented his\n\nGrace with a splendid gold trowel, manufactured for the occa\n\nsion4 by Mr. Delarue, of George-street. This very beautiful work\n\nof an excited universal admiration. The metallic part, or blade\n\nof thetlowelis of solid gold, weighing about twelve ounces.\n\nTbe handle is of ivory, handsomely finished, but of a somewhat\n\ngiuin and simple pattern. At the junction of the blade with the\n\nandle is a shield bearing the Archbishop's arms, blazoned with\n\nthe arms of the Arcbiepifcopal See. Near this skield (and con\n\nnecting it with the handle) isai-olid figure of an angel with\n\nexpanded wings. On tbe broadest portion of the trowel-blade\n\nare representation* ot the. late, and of the intended. Cathedral of\n\nSt. Mary. Tbe whole workmanship demands the highest praise.\n\nBelow the bas-reliefs is tbe following inscription :—\n\n' Arpo Sidneienei et Hetrop.

O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, who art true God\n\nAlmighty, the splendour and image of the Eternal Father, who\n\nart the cornersiunecut out from the mountain without hands ;\n\nand the unchangeable foundation; establish this stone to be\n\nplaced in thy name ; and thou who art the beginning and the end,\n\nin wbicb beginning God tbe Father created all things from the\n\nfirEt ; be tbou, we beseech tbee, the beginning and the increase,\n\nand the finishing of tbe work itself, which is to be begun to the\n\npraise and glory of thy name. Who, with the Father and the\n\nHoly Spirit, livest and reignest, God, world without end. Amen.'\n\n*' Holy Lord, Father Almighty, everlasting God, vouchsafe to\n\nblese this stone for the foundation of a church in\n\nhonour of Saint N. Through our Lord Jews Cbriet, thy\n\nSon: a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious etone,\n\nfonnded in tbe foundation, concerning which tbe\n\nApostle saith, But the Rock was Christ. Who, with Thee and the\n\nHoly Ghost liveth and reigneth, God, world without end.\n\nAmen.'\n\nHis Grace then blessed the stone, using the words ' Benedic\n\nDomine creaturam istam lapidie, &c.' Next was said er rather\n\nchanted, the Litany of the 6oints, the priest chanting the\n\ntuflrageE. After that the Archbi-hop began tbe antiphon,\n\n'Mane snrgess Jacob, &c.,' tbe cboir following him\n\nand chanting the Psalm 'Nisi Dominns.' This having\n\nbees done, tbe Prelate, standing in bis mitre touched\n\ntbe Etone, and placed it in the foundation, saying\n\ntheEe words :—' In fide Jesu Christi collocamus lapidem istum\n\nprimarium in hoc fundamento : In nomine Fatris, et Filii, et\n\nKpiritue Sascti. ut vigeat vera fides hie, et timor Dei, frateraaque\n\ndilectio, et sic hie locus destiuatus oration}, et ad invocandum,\n\net laudasdumnomenejusdemDomisi nostri JesuChristi, qui cum\n\nPatre, et 6piritu Sanaa vivit et regnat Den.', per omnia scecula\n\nt&culorom B Amen '\n\nTbe stone was then properly set by the mason, and the\n\nPsalms 'Miserere mci Deus,' ' Fundaments ejus,' and\n\n' Laitatus sum,' with the appropriate antipbons, were\n\nsung by the choir. Tbe Archbiehjp, with tbe bishops and clergy\n\nfollowing, then went round tbe foundations. After some further\n\nprayers the 'Veni Creator SpirituB' was sung, at the end of\n\nwhich the service was concluded by two appropriate prayers,\n\noffered up by the Archbishop.\n\nThe inicriptien on the brasB plate affixed to the foundation\n\nstone of St. Mary's is as follows :—\n\nIn nomioe Jesu Christi,\n\nPrimarium bunc lapidem\n\nEcclcsitc Cathedralis Stoe Marisc,\n\nprope 6itum prioris acdificii,\n\nconflagratione die xxix Junii. 1.1. uocccLxv,\n\npenitue diruti,\n\namplificandee tamen et 6umptuosius in6taurandasf solemni ritu\n\nbenedixit et posuit.\n\nIllmus et Rmus Johannes Beda Polding, O.S B.,\n\nArpus Eidneieneii necnon Metrop.

A committee which had been ap\n\npointed at a public meeting to prepare an address of congratula\n\ntion to bis Grace then approached, headed by the Hon. J. H.\n\nPlunkctt, who presented to him the following address, stating\n\ntbat the pleasure he felt in doing so was enhanced by the recol\n\nlection that thirty-three years ago r e had on nearly tbe same\n\nground presented an address to his Grace on his arrival in tbe\n\ncolony.\n\n?? To the Most Reverend John Bede Polding, Archbishop of\n\nSydney and Metropolitan.\n\n' May it please your Grace,—\n\n?? On this most solemn and eventful occasion, we, the Catholics\n\nof the dioceEe of Sydney, beg to offer to your Grace the expression\n\norourheerty congratulations on the auspicious undertaking of\n\nto-dsy.\n\n' Tbe sorrow arising from the calamity by which in a few\n\nhours we were deprived of tbe sacred edifice which for upwards\n\nof thirty years had been tbe mother chuich of Australia,\n\nwas to us the more difficult to bear, because we knew\n\nbow bitter end bow deep would be the suffering of\n\nyour Grace for tbat great Iocs. With the edifice then\n\ndestroyed all tbe dearest and holiest associations of your\n\nEccles astical Government of thiB portion of Christendom were\n\nintertwined. It was itself a great historic fact testifying the\n\nvitality and self-sscrificing spirit of our faith, by manifesting\n\nhow, under the darkest and most discouraging circumstances, a\n\nworthy temple to the Moet High bad been raised and adorned by\n\nthe piety and munificence of a former generation.\n\n' It was, however, our great consolation that your Grace was\n\nnpbeld in the midst of your affliction by the generous asd noble\n\nsympathies of the people of this country. Not to us alone\n\nwho were bound by the bondB of faith and obedience\n\nbelonged tbe exclusive privilege of manifesting how largely your\n\nGrace bad won the confidence and esteem of the people of this\n\ncountry. Ton had then the unspeakable happiness of discovering\n\nthat your tolerance, your charity, your thirty years of blameless\n\nand exemplary life among our fellow colonist*, who do not recog\n\nnise your spiritual authority, had borne fruit in the universal\n\nexpression of sympathy with your Grace's sorrow and with ours.\n\n' And now tbe moment has arrived when, assisted by the\n\ngenerosity of many of tboee separated from us in religious\n\nopinions, we have commenced the erection of a building, the pro\n\nportions and magnificence of wbich will be tbe noblest monument\n\nof yoor Grace's rule, and the most enduring testimony of our\n\nfaith and love.\n\n' We owe- much to these who have so aided us ia our effort!\n\ntoward b the erection and completion of a structure which, while\n\nit will be to ub tbe House of God, Bill only be to them a great\n\narchitectural adornment of this city- We acknowledge thU great\n\nobligation, and the consciousness of it has assisted us to bear for\n\nlhiir sekes much thatin recent times we have been called upon\n\nin tbe good Providence of God to endure. In your Grace's\n\ncharacter and public services, as the head of our Cburcb in Aus\n\ntralia, we have found ample refutation of the calumnies of those\n\nunhappy people wbo would represent our faith as a conspiracy\n\nagainst loyalty and human liberty, and who are ever prepared to\n\nhear, to receive, snd to circulate, any rumours, however ground\n\nless, that d av prejudice us in the eyes of our fellow colonists.\n\n' In conclusion wo beg your Grace te convey to tbe venerable\n\nbishops wbo have eurrounded you in the solemn ceremonial which\n\nhas just taken place our bumble acknowledgments of their ser\n\nvices, and our assurances of profound sympathy wltb them in the\n\ngreat labours in wbich they are engaged. The short period of\n\ntbeir episcopal ministration amongst ua bas already afforded sum\n\ndrst opportunity to appreciate and admire the true apoBtolic\n\nspirit by wbich they are animated, and we cberUh the devout\n\nbopc tbat tbeir labours may be crowned with success.\n\n' With our prajers that Almighty God mBy preserve you in\n\nthe enjoyment of health and of all blessings, till the great object\n\nef your Grace's life shall bo attained.\n\n' We bove the honour to subscribe ourselves your Grace's\n\nfaithful servants.\n\n'John H. Tlvkkett, President of Committee.'\n\n[For the Catholics of the diocese. 1\n\nTo thiB his Grace was pleased to return the following reply .—\n\n' Dear Friends,— Your congratulations are a comfort and\n\nhappiness to me. I am thankful, firBt of all to our good God,\n\nwho bus wrapped me round with such kind sympathy in my\n\neorroys and joy ; and next, to you who, with such true Instinct\n\nof filial friendship, bave ever chosen the most opportune moment\n\nto cbd r and strengthen my heart, by showing me what was in\n\njour own. May God blcs- ;ou with every form of temporal and\n\nspiritual recampencc! This is, indeed, as you soy,\n\na solemn and eventful occasion ; and It is to me\n\npeculiarly an occasion of coneolatitn and happiness, It proves to"
