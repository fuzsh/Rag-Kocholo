        "text": "The name Caldbeck comes from the Norse for 'cold stream', one of many signs of the Norse settlers from Cumbria's past. The How Bobbin Mill is a hidden gem, hidden away by trees with the River Caldew and the 'fairy pools' running alongside it.\n\nThe mill began production in 1857 and mainly made spinning and threading bobbins for the cotton industry. This helped meet the huge demand of the Lancashire textile industry. At its peak, the mill employed 60 men/boys, it was one of the largest in the Lake District area.\n\nAt one point, it had the largest overshot wheel in the country- a staggering 3ft wide with a 42ft diameter structure. The wood for the bobbins was sourced from the ancient coppices' woodland nearby. Horse and cart were used to transport raw and finished products.\n\nOther countries were also producing cloth much cheaper than in Britain. This resulted in the decline of the British textiles industry. Caldbeck Howk Bobbin Mill closed in 1924 and began to deteriorate. After a turbulent few decades the textile industry in Britain had all but vanished by the 1980s. All that was left of the once pride of British industry was empty factories and the towns which has sprung up around them due to the boom.\n\nWhere To Park For Howk Bobbin Mill?\n\nShow Parking On Google Maps\n\nLat / Long\n\n54.749394, 54.749394\n\nWhat three words\n\ntowel.snoozing.says\n\nParking is found at the village car park which is signposted, this is free to park but donations are welcomed for its upkeep.

I'm extremely passionate about history, especially anything to do with local history. Although I visit anywhere with history, I enjoy visiting lesser known sites and getting their histories told.\n\nMore Places from Jonny"
