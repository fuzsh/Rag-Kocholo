Construction is now underway after almost a year of planning.\n\nhttps://www.garagejournal.com/forum/showthread.php?t=442443\n\nGarage internal dimensions are 24' deep by 23' wide. The ceiling is cathedral with R-38 batts and the walls will be 2x6 with R-19 batts.\n\nThe interior will be drywall finished.\n\nBelow is a 3D Diagram of the space.\n\n* The height of the wall is a 9'5\" at the door and 15' at the peak.\n\nDEllis-Diag-Car-up-wpfc by duncanrellis, on Flickr\n\nScreen Shot 2020-02-02 at 5.02.14 PM by duncanrellis, on Flickr\n\nOther notes:\n\n* The garage door faces East. There are no windows or doors on the southern end of the building.\n\n* The garage door is 10' x 8' insulated.\n\n* Two 36\" wide insulated exterior doors.\n\n* One 36\" x 36\" double pane insulated window.\n\n* Floor is 4\" concrete with foam insulation on the foundation wall and 1 ft of interior foam on the perimeter of the slab.\n\nI've looked at a couple of sizing charts, but the cathedral ceiling complicates it for me. I've been looking at sizes between 18,000 BTU and 24,000 BTU.\n\nI live in SE Pennsylvania, which I believe is in climate zone 5. Winters here rarely drop below 0F and the summers sometimes creep into the 90s.\n\nMy plan is to condition this space year round so that my tools don't rust.\n\nHere's one unit I was considering.\n\nhttps://www.acwholesalers.com/LG-LS180HSV5/p81405.html\n\nAnd another.\n\nhttps://www.acwholesalers.com/LG-LS243HLV3/p106690.html\n\nI'm surprised with the 18k-24k rating. I'm in Texas. I'm cooling 2400 sqft with 2 x 24K Daikins. My ceiling walls are 16', but my insulation isn't as good (R15) and I have 3 big doors that aren't very insulated.\n\nWe did do a 600 sqft boat house with an 18k unit that really wasn't enough - however, it wasn't insulated and basically leaked through the floor... Fixing it involved installing insulation.\n\nHere's what I don't know - my main function is cooling. Heating is not an issue. Perhaps your calculations are based on being able to heat that space with those high ceilings? If so, I don't have any experience with it - but I would caution you too look at performance curves of the units you are considering in \"heat\" mode. Heat pump efficiency has gotten much better, but it's not at all unusual to see units drop by 50% BTU capacity as temps dip below freezing... Note, there are \"hyper heat\" models designed for cold climates.\n\nMy advice for \"go head and over-BTU\" in regard to ductless splits has been criticized on this forum.. That's OK, but I continue to sorta give that advice. As these units have inverter technology and variable speed fans, I'd rather put one in that is too large versus one that is too small. I'd not see the same of traditional ducted HVAC.\n\nDid they do a load for the spaces ? How big is the attic ?\n\nThat's in the ball part for that equipment ... I installed the same unit outside in two different houses with 3 x 12BTU heads. 13k or so\n\nIt's important to have a load done and match the outputs ... especially with the multi heads. As you see above I have 36k BTU on a 30BTU unit.\n\nNothing out there will match that equipment -- it's the best. Hyper heat compressor and the duel split head with eye. If you felt energetic you could always place a DIY unit in the garage and have the other done for the attic.\n\nWith labor costs what they are -- installing cheaper equipment gets you cheaper equipment ... same labor costs for each.\n\nThere's no attic, it's one large space. The footprint of the garage is 23' deep by 24' wide. There's 2 36\" insulated exterior doors, and one 10x8' insulated garage doors The space is 10' high at the lowest, and extends to 16' at the ridge.\n\nR-38 in the ceiling and R-19 insulation in the walls. I don't know if the first contractor did a proper load calculation.\n\nthanks,\n\nDuncan\n\nI'm about 30 miles south of you with a 22x21 attached garage with almost 10ft ceilings and an east facing door and I'd also recommend a Mr Cool DIY.\n\nI have an 18k unit and have it set to 72 degrees 24/7 and have no problems at all maintaining that temp. And this is in a garage built in the 70s with leaky single pane windows and poorly insulated (almost no insulation in the attic above and likely minimal in the side walls) and the indoor unit not optimally placed. Impact to the electric bill has been minimal and I have the 2nd gen version which is rated lower seer than the new ones.\n\nWithin reason it would be hard to oversize one of these units. On a traditional heat pump because they are on/off an oversized unit might hit desired temp before the humidity is removed. On the MR Cool and other inverter style mini splits it will continue to run at a lower speed maintaining temp but removing the humidity. Also agree with using one indoor unit - it is plenty powerful to launch the air 20ft across the garage\n\nFor the price difference and the vaulted ceilings I would recommend the 24k. If you can drill a hole and use a wrench you can do it yourself and save a ton of $. I believe Ingrams Water and Air in Kentucky is the distributor for these units (the bracket i ordered through HD came direct from Ingrams) Give them a call or chat with them on their website - my previous sales person was Doug.\n\nGot it -- no spray foam .....\n\nDon't be surprised as you go through the process. This is a common problem ..... prices all over the place and three different recommendations ... sometimes more. Often the first quote will be matching what is in the house and the next will be some guess. People are busy now ... and the week coming up they will be more so.\n\nInstalls are all over the place ..... did you make some provisions for the unit when you built? electric .... placement of the compressor. Running electric from far away can add tot he cost .... distance from compressor to head .. etc...\n\nDo you have natural gas -- how is the house heated?\n\nIn PA there is a need to size for heat .. so that my be driving the size. It is hard to figure in some spaces ... a leaking door or poorly insulated one can change everything.\n\n7.5k seems high .... is there something difficult about the install ?\n\nThere is a 100 amp sub panel in the garage 50 ft away so the electric should be pretty simple. New construction so I think the install is straight forward.\n\nThe heat unit and compressor can go on the same wall. No obstructions\n\nWe are electric only so this unit needs to be the sole source of heat.\n\nIâ€™m thinking about asking the first contractor that recommended the dual head install if they could quote an 18k unit"
