        "text": "This report presents the results of archaeological monitoring by the Museum of London Archaeology Service on the site of St Paul’s Cathedral south churchyard, London, EC4. The report was commissioned from MoLAS by the Cathedral Archaeologist Dr John Schofield on behalf of the client, the Dean and Chapter of St Paul’s Cathedral. The watching brief followed an earlier evaluation of the site by MoLAS (2005), comprising of targeted trench excavations, which had exposed areas of the cloister and chapter house of the medieval cathedral. Landscaping in the south churchyard was monitored between 26th July and 29th September 2006. Parts of the medieval cloister were exposed and protected within the landscaping (which includes a partial representation of the cloister and chapter house). Areas surviving to a higher level than had previously been exposed were protected within the foundation of new walls representing the cloister. All remains were surveyed onto the Ordnance Survey National Grid Projection via a direct link traverse to OS control stations and levels recorded to OS datum, the records of which should assist their future preservation. Significant new details were added to historic observations and the remains exposed in evaluation trenches. These included the external threshold and the western range which had 3 long panels of diagonally laid Purbeck slabs, 2 slabs wide towards the outside, 1.5 in the centre and 1 slab wide to the inside. This contrasts with panels of equal thickness on the eastern range (1.5 slabs wide). This is the first time this detail has been recorded. Detailed drawings were made of architectural mouldings which may be compared with historic records. A previously unknown area of good preservation lay in a constructed void below steps to the previous southern garden gate. Comparison of stone from the cloister wall with the Museum of London’s historic building materials specialist comparative collection indicated that the yellow limestone of which they were made came from Taynton (from near Burford, Oxfordshire) rather than Caen, as indicated by a geologist during the field evaluation. However, detailed examination of the fabric of the masonry indicated reused material in the walls so their immediate source was probably buildings which stood nearby, or on the spot, before the cloister was built. It is entirely possible that the stone came from more than one source. Also exposed was a large stone and red brick curved foundation, possibly temporary work for Inigo Jones or Wren St Paul's construction, measuring 1.8m by 9m+. This has never before been recorded and its precise function is unknown but had it been a permanent structure in this location it is thought there would have been a record of it. Below it was a large red-brick culvert built by Wren. It is moot whether the foundation was built over the culvert (and was therefore later) or the culvert was tunnelled beneath the foundation. The “Gas Chamber” a subterranean concrete room associated with the provision of town gas to the cathedral was uncovered and recorded, as was an old ragstone foundation at its base."
