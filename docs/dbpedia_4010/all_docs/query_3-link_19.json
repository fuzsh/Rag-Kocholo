The Methodist Church and the subject buildings are substantial structures along Wigton Road, occupying a commanding position with the junction of Stanhope Road. To the east are residential dwellings including the converted original vicarage.\n\nA terrace of small and mostly independent retail units are located nearby with B&M in the locality.
