        "text": "Choose from the 7 Bible encyclopedias freely available online at StudyLight.org for sermon, Bible study, and Sunday school preparation.\n\nAn encyclopedia (also spelled encyclopaedia or encyclop√¶a) is a type of reference work, a compendium holding a summary of information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge.\n\nEncyclopedias are divided into articles or entries, which are usually accessed alphabetically by article name. Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries. Generally speaking, unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information to cover the thing or concept for which the article name stands."
