        "text": "In Carlisle we were looking forward to the return of orchestral concerts after an absence of four years; but reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) has been found in the roof of the auditorium at the Sands Centre, so all events have been cancelled. Perhaps the Northern Sinfonia could play in Carlisle Cathedral instead? Unlikely that there’s any Raac there.\n\nIan K Watson\n\nCarlisle\n\nOne of my three babies slept like all the books tell you babies should – he had a wonderful routine (Letters, 30 August). The other two did not – they slept, or not, on their own terms. I came to the conclusion that it is the people who are lucky enough to have amenable babies who have the time and the energy to write all the books.\n\nGina Purrmann\n\nBlairgowrie, Perth and Kinross\n\nA simple rule explains much in politics: follow the money (Owners of 100,000 properties held by foreign shell companies unknown despite new UK laws, 3 September). It seems likely to me that the Tories continue to fight hard against transparency on the dirty money of Russian oligarchs and corrupt dictators for one reason: because they’re up to their necks in it.\n\nStephen Psallidas\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne\n\nThere’s nothing new in the world: I came across a newspaper from 29 June 1967. Front-page headlines included “Last chance for rail talks” (NUR on strike) and “Young doctors to meet BMA” (threat of strikes by junior doctors). Incidentally: Mick Jagger was in custody and Liverpool bid £90,000 for Tony Hateley.\n\nJim McManners\n\nTrimdon Grange, County Durham\n\nWelcome back, Martin Rowson (Guardian Opinion cartoon, 5 September). You were missed.\n\nJennifer Parkhill\n\nIsleworth, London\n\nThe penultimate letter was amended on 8 September 2023. The footballer in question was Tony Hateley, not “Hartley” as an earlier version said.\n\nHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section."
