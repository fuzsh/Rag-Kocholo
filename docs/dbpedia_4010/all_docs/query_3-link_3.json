        "text": "Pages\n\ndescription Page 3\n\n[figure]\n\nTHE CITY OF CARLISLE.\n\nTHE traveller approaching from the south, has the best view of the city, seat∣ed on a fine eminence, gradually emerging from an extensive plain of rich cultivated land. The waters of the Frith are seen on the one hand, with the ad∣jacent levells; the back ground of the landscape is beautifully variegated by the irregular swells of the whole Scotch promontory, extending towards the Irish sea. The walls strengthened with an arrangement of buttresses at irregular distances, lies upon one angle to the view; in part, concealing the houses of the city, and boldly overtoped by the square tower of the castle, and the august and solemn structure of the cathedral. This view of Carlisle is the more striking, as there is no adjacent eminence; from which cause the city looks more majestic, as it crowns so beautiful a plain.\n\nThe city is walled round, the fortifications towards Scotland appearing the most modern; they are formed of better squared stones than several other parts of the works. The east and south sides are supported by a multitude of buttresses, which, we presume, have been built up occasionally, to strengthen the decaying parts of the wall. It is watered by three fine rivers, the Eden on the north, the Peterill on the east, and Caude on the west. There are three gates to the city, which, from their different aspects, are called the English, Irish, and Scotch Gates. On\n\ndescription Page 4\n\nthe approach from Penrith, on the south, you enter the English Gates; on the ap∣proach from Wigton, on the south-west, is the Irish Gate; and the Scotch Gate, to the north, opens upon the bridges. The walls are embrazured, but without any earth-work. The English Gate is guarded by a very strong machicolated gate, flanked by circular towers of great strength; the guns mounted therein in several tiers, would effectually sweep every approach. This gateway, with its towers and other works, is commonly called the Citadel, and was erected by the order of King Henry VIII. The castle consists of various works, but being kept up as a garrisoned place, we conceive it imprudent to describe them minutely. The donjon, or great tower, more properly deserves the title of the citadel, being surrounded by the other works; it is square and very lofty, and the walls of vast strength and thickness, being constructed agreeably to the old modes of defence, before the use of cannon: it was strengthened by a draw bridge over a wide ditch, and defended by modern works; a half-moon battery mounted with cannon, and a very large platform also mounted with cannon, under cover of the outward wall. The top of the tower being embrazured and lined with turf, and mounted with large cannon, this part of the fortress could make a good defence, and sustain a formidable attack. By a well of vast depth constructed within the great tower, and said to be of Roman work, the supply of water for the garrison could not be cut off by an enemy. This well is not unlike that in Bambrough Castle in Nor∣thumberland, and has been constructed at the same time the great tower was built. In the outer castle is a fine grass plot, a garden and governor's house.\n\nBut it will be expected by our readers, that we give a more particular descrip∣tion of this city, and collect the historical facts relative to it.\n\nThe name of Carlisle has been deduced by several authors, from different ety∣mologies. The British chronicle informs us, this city was built by a British potentate, called Luel. Leland says,\n\nthe Irishmen call bale a town, and so peradventure did the old Scottes: thus might be said that lugabalia soundeth Luel's-town.\n\nThe Romans called it Lugovallium, or Luguballum, from its si∣tuation on Severus' wall, and from the troops and people garrisoned there. Ptolemy calls it Leucopibi, Nennius Caer Lualid. The Saxons retained the old name Luel; the Welsh writers give it the name of the city of Duballus. Some derive the name\n\ndescription Page 5\n\nfrom the ancient British Llu-gyda-gwal, which implies an army by the wall; from whence it is asserted the Romans framed their appellation of Lugovallium; others from Lagus, or Lucus, which, in the language of the Celtae and Britains, signified a tower; and which, with the Roman compound, expressed a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum: to the Saxon name was added, the word caer, or city; and from these, Caer Leuel, the present name of Car-lisle, seems to come by an easy corrup∣tion. It is reasonable to apprehend, that in so fine a situation, on the confluence of three rivers, and the grand estuarie of the Frith, this place was of some strength and distinction before the coming of the Romans: it will naturally follow, that the name was given antecedent to the building of Severus' wall, or the vallum of Hadrian; and we conceive that Leland points out the most probable etymology. Camden and his editors have taken great pains on this subject,\n\nThe Romans and Britains called it Luguvallum and Luguballium, or Luguballia; the Saxons, as Bede writeth, Luel; Ptolemy, as some think, Lucopibia, (which seems rather to be a corruption of 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 i. e. white houses, and to be Candida Casa, or Whithorn in Galloway) Nemicus Caer Lualid; the ridiculous Welsh prophecies, the city of Duballus; we Carlisle; and the Latins, from the more modern name, Carleolum. For that Luguballia and Carlisle are the same, is universally agreed by our historians. But as to the etymology, what pains has our countryman, Leland, taken about it, and at last he is driven upon this shift, that Ituna might be called Lugas, and that Ballum came from Vallis, a valley, and so make Lugu∣vallum, as much as a valley upon the Luge. But to give my conjectures also, I dare affirm, that the vallum and valia were derived from that famous military vallum of the Romans, which runs hard by the city. For Antoninus calls Lugu∣vallum ad vallum; and the Picts wall, which was afterwards built on the wall of Severus, is to be seen at Stanwicks, a small village a little beyond the Eden. It passed the river over against the castle; where, in the very channel, the remains of it, namely, great stones appear to this day. Also, Pomponius Mela has told us, that lugus or lucus signified a tower among the old Celtae, who spoke the same language with the Britains; for what Antoninus calls lugo augusti, is in him turris augusti; so that luguvallum, both really is, and signifies a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum. Upon this foundation, if the French had made their lugdunum signify a tower upon a hill, and their lucotetia (so the ancients called what we call lutetia) a beautiful tower; for the words import so much in the British, they might possibly have been more in the right, than by deriving the latter from lutum, dirt; and the former from one Lugdus, a fabulous king. As to the present name, Carlisle, the original of this is plain enough, from the British, caer, a city; and Lual, Luel, Lugubal, Leil, or Luil, according to the several appella∣tions, antient or modern, importing as much as the town or city of Luul, &c.\n\ndescription Page 6\n\nIt has been the opinion of several judicious visitants, that the river Eden has shifted its course and channel since the time of the Romans, and that formerly it passed nearer to the castle; for it should seem an inconsistent task for that wise people, to make their work traverse a rapid and broad river, otherwise than in a direct line. Both Mr. Horsley, and Mr. Warburton join in this opinion.\n\nIt may safely be determined, that the Romans found this a place of some im∣portance; but that it was, in their time, rather a place of recess after the toils of warfare were over, than a place of chief strength, appears from the vicinity of Stanwix, the station in course upon the wall. It is not to be doubted, but Caer-Luel was fortified, as it lay too near the borders not to be subject to perils and alarms; but we have no Roman authorities, to denominate it a regular Roman city or station; as we find those nearest to the wall, on the south, were Olenacum, now called Old Carlifle, near Wigton; and Bremetenracum, called old Perith. The words of Camden and his editors are,\n\nThat this city flourished in the time of the Romans, appears plainly enough from the several evidences of antiquity, which they now and then dig up; and from the frequent mention made of it, by the writers of those times. And even after the ravages of the Picts and Scots, it retained something of its ancient splendor, and was accounted a city.\n\nWe have no authority to determine what was the size or form of this place in distant antiquity. Leland says in his Itinerary, vol. VII. p. 48.\n\nThe hole site of the towne, is sore chaungid.q For whereas the stretes were, and great edifices, now be vacant and garden plottes. The cite of Cairluel stondeth in the forest of Ynglewood. The cite ys yn compace scant a myle, and ys walled with a right fayre and stronge wal, ex lapide quadrato subrufo. In diggyng to make new buildyngs yn the towne, often tymes hath bene, and now alate fownd diverse foundations of the old cite, as pavimentes of stretes, old arches of dores, coyne, stones squared, paynted pottes, mony hid yn pottes, so hold and mauldid, that when yt was stronly touchid yt went almost to mowlder.\n\nPage 49,\n\nIn the feldes about Caerluel, yn plewhyng hath be fownd diverse Cornelines, and other stonys wel entaylid for seals, and yn other places of Cumberland yn plewhyng hath be fownde brickes conteynyng the prints of antique workes.\n\ndescription Page 7\n\nAfter the retreat of the Romans, we may naturally conceive, this city would soon be evacuated by the Britons, and destroyed and laid waste by the northern nations, who made constant irruptions, and at length extended their rapine and devastation into the southern, and interior parts of Britain, till repressed by the coming in of the Saxon allies. It would even be a considerable time after their introduction, before they could extend their arms to these western parts. During this period, and in the darkness in which the history of those ages is involved, we are left to conjecture, that this now flourishing city lay in ashes and ruin, till ******* Egfrid possessing the diadem of Northumbria, carried his conquest to the western ocean. The Britons in this mountainous country, long retained their natural ferocity, and supported their uncivilized liberty and independance. Egfrid had Cumberland as a tributary province of his kingdom; and from that period we gain some degree of certainty in the history of this place.\n\nThe first certain account we have of Carlisle, is in the seventh century of the Christian aera. It appears, that in Egfrid's reign, it became a place of consider∣able strength and consequence; he having caused it to be rebuilt, and fortified with a wall. Camden says,\n\nin 619, Egfrid, King of Northumberland, gave it to the famous St. Cuthbert, in these words: I have likewise bestowed upon him the city called Luguballia, with the lands fifteen miles about it,\n\nand quotes Symeon Dunelm. This is a palpable error, for Cuthbert's consecration was in 685. The words of Symeon are,\n\nEt quia illa terra minus sufficiens erat, Lugubaliam que Luel vocatur, in circuita xv. miliaria habentum in augmentum suscepit; ubi etiam sanctimonialium congregatione stabilita. Reginam dato habitu religionis consecravit, et inprofectu divinae servitutis scolas instituit.\n\nBede says, the citizens carried Cuthbert to see the walls of their city, and a well of admirable workmanship, built in it by the Romans.\n\nSeveral writers of St. Cuthbert's life, tell us of that holy man's founding here, A. D. 686, a convent of monks, a school, and an abbey of nuns; but from Bede's Life of St. Cuthbert, cap. 27. it seems as if the monastery here, to which Queen Emenburga retired, was in be∣ing before St. Cuthbert's coming to Carlisle.\n\ndescription Page 8\n\nAfter Egfrid's having restored the city, and fortified it with a wall, it became an appendage to the see of Lindisfarn, by the royal gift thereof to St. Cuthbert; and so continued till the year 1130, when King Henry I. constituted it a separate bishoprick. By Dugdales Monasticon, it appears, that in 1082, in the acts of William Carilepho, bishop of Durham, it was stiled part of the diocese of the bishop of Durham. It is asserted, that in 1066, William the Conqueror issued his mandate to the inhabitants of Cumberland at large, and of Carlisle in particular, that they should continue subject to the bishop of Durham as their diocesian, from whose predecessors they had received Christianity.\n\nSo far we are allowed to speak of this city from the loose records of antiquity; from the time of the Conquest we have more certainty, and evidence of undenia∣ble authenticity to guide us. Camden's description of the site of Carlisle is to this purport,\n\nBetween the confluence of these rivers (Peteril and Cauda) the ancient city of Carlisle has a delightful, pleasant situation; bounded on the north with Eden, on the east with Peteril, and on the west with Caude; and, besides these natural fences, it is fortified with a strong stone wall, a castle, and citadel. It is of an oblong form from west to east: to the west is a pretty large castle, which was built by William the second, and repaired by King Richard III. as should seem by the arms.\n\nThe period of time between the reign of Egfrid, and the coming of the Danes, affords a sufficient number of years to support a presumption, that this place would greatly improve in importance and power, before the pro∣gress of those ravagers; but the advance only served to aggrandize its woe; for when those invaders had possessed themselves of these northern parts, we find Carlisle again smoking in her ashes: and so complete was the destruction, that she lay overwhelmed in her desolation, till the time of William the Conqueror, when one of his followers is said to have rebuilt some parts of the city, founded, or restored the ancient religious society there, and dedicated the house to the honour of the Blessed Virgin, of which he became the chief: and, in consequence of these pious works, it was, that the Conqueror issued the foregoing mandate, in which Carlisle was particularly specified; that this body of religious should be\n\ndescription Page 9\n\nsubject to the episcopal jurisdiction of Durham, as were the adjacent lands of Northumberland.\n\nKing William Rufus having entertained a perfect idea of the importance of this place, on the western part of the frontier, as he saw Newcastle was on the eastern; and seeing the infant works of Walter proceeding prosperously, he un∣dertook to restore the city, and caused many public buildings to be erected; the whole of which, he directed, should be defended by a complete circumvallation, and a strong fortress: the care of executing his plan he consigned to Walter, and under his inspection, it is alledged, the works were carried on. From the appear∣ance of several parts of the fortifications, one is led to determine, they are the work of that aera; for the Normans brought into this country, some of the best workmen the island ever possessed, as appears by the remains of many of the northern castles, whose dates are well ascertained: and there is so great a simili∣tude of the form and mode of architecture in the great tower of the castle of Car∣lisle, that thence, by a common observer, its date may be ascertained. In the sides of this tower, in several parts, are placed the arms of England, but these seem to denote no more than the reparations made by the several sovereigns.\n\nIt is said he first placed here a colony of Flemings, and most probably they were the artificers who raised the fortifications; for soon after, we read of the city being restored and walled, with the defence of a fortress added thereto: we find the Flemings were removed to North Wales, and the isle of Anglesea, and the king replaced them with a colony of South Britains, men used to husbandry, and\n\ndescription Page 10\n\nthe culture of lands, who should till this part of the forest of Inglewood, which hitherto had lain in its original state; and teach the natives the mode of reaping from the natural fertility of their country, the many comsorts of life; and the progressive treasures to be won by industry; of which they do not, from any thing mentioned by historians, appear to have conceived a previous idea. To this colony all the records existing attribute the first tillage that was known in the fertile plains of Carlisle. Bishop Gibson, in his edition of Camden, speaking of the evidence touching this matter in the Saxon Chronicle, says,\n\nIt has it 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 which at first sight should seem to be an error for; 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉: but in truth, this seems rather to be an error of the librarian, for 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, and on that supposition the words would imply, that a great number of husbandmen were sent thither, and not Englishmen; for, before that time the inhabitants of Carlisle were English: and what follows in the Saxon Chronicle, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, strengthens the conjecture, as expressing the errand upon which they were sent, viz. to cultivate those parts.\n\nThis was deep policy in William, as it was in∣troducing a certain employment, which would naturally call together many settlers; and render his kingdom less subject to annoyances from a northern enemy, by the increase of population, and consequent strength of the frontiers. The cultivation introduced by William, had not made so rapid a progress in the course of seventy years, as to have cleared the neighbourhood of Carlisle of wood; for by the char∣ter of King Henry II. the citizens had the privilege of taking fuel, and building timber from the Royal Forest of Carlisle.\n\nCamden says,\n\nLugubalia now grown populous, had, as they write, its Earl, or rather Lord Ralph Meschines, from whence descended the earls of Chester.\n\nAfter the death of Richard, Earl of Chester, who was drowned with the king's children, Ranulph Meschines removed to Chester. and was Earl thereof. Pre∣sently after King Henry I. died, and King Stephen usurping the state, gave this county to David, King of Scots, to procure his aid against King Henry II. right heirs to the late king, as son to Maud the Empress, daughter and sole heir to Henry I. But the Scots secretly favoured him for his right's sake; and for that he had made the said Henry Fitz Empress knight at Carlisle. Yet accepting the gift of the county, whereunto he pretended his own right, before granted to his ancestors by the Saxon kings, he made his eldest son, Henry Fitz David, Earl of Huntington and Carlisle; which Henry founded the abbey of Holm Cultram in the time of King Stephen, his father confirming the grant of the revenues wherewith he endowed that house, and so his son Malcom, King of Scots, after David. After Henry Fitz David and King Stephen were dead, King Henry Fitz Empress took Carlisle and the county from the Scots, and granted to the city the first liberties I hear of, that they enjoyed after the Conquest. But his charter was burned by a casual fire that happened in the town, which defaced a great part of the same, and all the records of antiquity of that place.\n\n—DENTON.\n\nThe next person we read of in history, who had the title of Earl of Carlisle, was Andrew de Harcla, whom King Edward II. for his good services against Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and his adherents, and for subduing those who were\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[figure]\n\nCARLISLE CASTLE.\n\ndescription Page 11\n\nin rebellion, and delivering them prisoners to the king, created him Earl of Car∣lisle. From the time of his degradation, the title of Earl of Carlisle was never revived till the Restoration of King Charles II. when Charles Howard, son of Sir William Howard, in the 13th year of that reign, was created Lord Dacre of Gils∣land, visc. Howard of Morpeth, and Earl of Carlisle, in reward for his having been highly instrumental in that happy restoration: in which honours he hath been suc∣ceeded by his immediate descendants to this time.\n\nIn the wall be iii gates, Bocher (south) gate, Caldew (west) gate, and Richard (north) gate. The castle being within the towne, is yn sum part as a closer of the wall.\n\n—LEL. ITIN. vol. VII. page 48.\n\nThe parts of Carlisle castle are particularly mentioned in the report made of the state of it, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, given in the notes. The cita∣del,\n\ndescription Page 12\n\nas it is said, was erected in the reign of King Henry VIII.; and it is surpris∣ing that the whole castle and fortifications should so soon fall into such decay, as to be in the state represented by that report, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It appears thereby, that the works consisted of a donjon, whose walls are twelve feet\n\ndescription Page 13\n\nin thickness, an inward and outward ward; the walls of the outward ward, nine feet in thickness, and eighteen feet in height; and the walls of the inner ward, twelve feet, having a half-moon bastion. A tower, called the Captain's Tower. Two gates, one to each ward. In the castle a great chamber and a hall, but no\n\ndescription Page 14\n\nstorehouse for amunition. In the walls of the town, three gate-way towers, a se∣micircular bastion, called Springold Tower: and add to these, the citadel. But besides those mentioned in the report, the walls were garnished with several square towers, particularly a tower at the western sally port, and a tower called the Tile Tower, of particular strength.\n\nBefore we quit the subject of the castle, we must remark the beautiful and ex∣tensive prospect which you command from the great tower. The foreground is formed of level meads, washed by Eden; in one part, insulated by a separation of the river. This plot is ornamented by two fine stone bridges, one of four, the other of nine arches, the great passage towards Scotland. The hanging banks are crowded with the village and church of Stanwix, and the distant ground filled with the mountains of Bewcastle. To the south, you command the plains to∣wards Penrith, shut in on either hand by a vast chain of mountains; over which Cross-fell and Skiddaw are distinctly seen, greatly eminent. To the east, a varied tract of cultivated country, scattered over with villages and hamlets, mingling beautifully with woodlands on the extensive landscape: the distant horizon form∣ed by the heights of Northumberland.

Itin. vol. VII. page. 48.—but since his days, it has undergone great change, as will be shewn in the sequel. The present edifice consists of the east limb of the cross, being the chancel, and the cross aile or tran∣sept, with the tower: the greatest part of the west limb of the cross, having been pulled down in the civil wars, 1641: with the materials they erected a guard∣house at every gate of the city, and one in the market-place; and two batteries in the castle. The circular arches and massive round columns,\n\nwhose shafts are only fourteen feet two inches high, and circumference full seven and a half,\n\nwhich remain of the west limb and transept, are of the heaviest order of the Saxon architecture; and at the first sight, testify the different ages in which this part and the chancel were erected: indeed the architecture denotes an earlier aera than the time of William Rufus, and probably here is a part of the work of the age of St. Cuthbert: but there is no corroborating evidence to attend the mode of building, which might prove so ancient a date. The west end is said to have been, in length, 135 feet from the cross aile, of which 43 feet remains, it being dismembered of 92 feet. It is not in our power to determine how often this church was restored; it is evident that the Danes laid this city in ashes, and that King William Rufus, under his trusty nominee Walter, restored the city and the public buildings: but so early as the reign of King Henry H. the city was laid waste by the Scots, and the public records were burnt, which most probably, a∣greeable to the custom of those days, were deposited in the archieves of the eccle∣siastics: conceiving this to be the fact, then we must admit of some considerable change in this sacred edifice; for in 1292, we are told, an accidental fire consum∣ed the church, with half of the city, to the number of 1300 houses, as far as the north gate. In the reign of King Edward III. it was rebuilt by contributions. The editor of Camden's words are,\n\nAlmost in the middle of the city, stands the cathedral church; the upper part, whereof (being newer) is a curious piece of workmanship, built by King Henry VIII. but the lower is much more ancient.— The lower west part is the parochial church, and as old as St. Cuthbert; or as Walter, who came in with the Conqueror, was a commander in his army, rebuilt the city, founded a priory, and turning religious, became, himself, the first prior of it. The chancel was built by contributions, about the year 1350, and the belfrey was raised, and the bells placed in it, at the charge of William de Strick∣land, bishop in the year 1401.\n\nThe expression used by this learned editor, is so indefinite, that we own we are not able to determine, whether he meant to imply that King Henry VIII, built the present chancel. By a writer in the\n\ndescription Page 16\n\nGentleman's Magazine 1745, p. 674, it is said,\n\non the 14th Richard II. near 1500 houses were destroyed, with the cathedral, and suburbs,\n\nby an accidental fire; and he adds, this account is taken from the Magna Britannia Antiqua et Nova. If this account has any foundation, the last conflagration happened forty\n\n[figure]\n\nA Ground Plan of the CATHEDRAL CHURCH of CARLISLE.\n\nA The Bishop's Throne.\n\nB The Pulpit.\n\nC The Governor's Seat.\n\nD The Mayor's do.\n\nE The Litany Desk.\n\nF The Reading Desks.\n\nG The Bishop's Stall.\n\nH The Dean's do.\n\nI The Prebendaries' Stalls.\n\nK The Entrance, above which is the Organ.\n\nL The place where the Bells are rung.\n\nM The place where the Legend of St. Anthony is painted.\n\nN The place where the Legend of St. Augustine is painted.\n\nO The Clock.\n\nP The Doors, the south one of which opened into the Cloisters.\n\n1.

These contradictions and ambiguities, we are at present obliged to leave unsolved.\n\nThe choir is 137 feet in length, and, with the side ailes, 71 feet broad: the cross aile or transept is 28 feet broad, so that the length of the church, when entire, was exactly 300 feet within. The choir is of fine Gothic architecture, with light columns, remarkably beautiful. The stalls are garnished with taber∣nacle work; (the organ is placed at the cross screen, which contains but a narrow and low entrance, and is a great injury to this fine edifice.) By late repairs it is greatly embellished, being wainscotted with oak, from the stalls round the whole east end of the choir, in a simple stile, after the old order. The open gates leading into the side ailes, are old and much broken, but shew excellent light Tracery work, finely ornamented. The bishop's throne is not magnificent, but yet elegant and stately. The breadth of the choir and ailes being 71 feet, corresponds well with the height, which to the center of the ceiling is 75 feet. The roof was originally lined or vaulted with wood, painted and orna∣mented with arms and devices of the several patrons and contributors to the work; with the arms of France and England, were those of the Piercys, Lucys, Warrens, and Mowbrays. The old wood lining remains in the cross aile, and shews what was the former figure, and the ornaments of the choir: but the outward roof and wood ceiling of the choir having gone greatly to decay, when repairs were made, in 1764 the ceiling was stuccoed, in the form of a groined vault, which is a great advantage to its appearance. The east window is large, being 48 feet in height, and 30 in breadth, ornamented with fine pilasters: but it has no cast of solemnity, by means of a border of coloured glass thrown round it, of yellow, red, and green, which looks gaudy.\n\nIn the ailes on each side, are some strange legendary paintings of the history of St. Anthony, St. Cuthbert, and St. Augustine: one represents the saint vi∣sited by an unclean spirit, who tempts him in a most indecent manner.\n\nAbove every picture is a distich relative to the subject.\n\ndescription Page 18\n\nTo give the reader an idea of these strange compositions, we have transcribed the legends of St. Anthony, St. Cuthbert, and St. Austine.\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[figure]\n\nLegend of St. Anthony.\n\n[figure]\n\nLegend of St. Austin.\n\ndescription Page 19\n\nThe cross aile from north to south, is 124 feet; in the center is a tower, in height 127 feet, which originally supported a spire of lead, thirteen or fourteen feet high, which being gone greatly to decay, was totally removed soon after the Restoration.\n\nThe pillars of the choir are clustered, and in excellent proportion; the arches are pointed; in the inner mouldings of the capitals, are figures and flowers in pierced work, of light carving, and the inside of the arches are prettily ornamented. Two galleries run above the side ailes, but with windows only in the upper: that in the east end has a magnificent simplicity.\n\nWhen the choir was rebuilt in the reign of King Edward III. indulgences were issued, the common and most effectual claim of assistance; which were of forty days penance to such laity, as should, by money, materials, or labour, contri∣bute to this pious work: and the bishop's register abounds with letters patent, and orders for the purpose.\n\nAt the west end of the church, is a large plain altar tomb, called the Blue stone; on this the tenants of the dean and chapter, by certain tenures, were obliged to pay their rents.\n\n—PENNANT.\n\ndescription Page 20\n\nSeveral parts of the abbey were enlarged or improved by Prior Gondibour, who occurs in 1484; the initial letters of his name appearing in several parts. In the vestry is preserved an old oak aumery or chest, with an inscription in the old English letter.—See the Plate, p. 598.\n\nPrior Senhouse, who occurs in 1507, repaired the square tower within this priory; and on the beams of the middle room are inscribed many sentences, with a moral maxim often used by him, Loth to offend.\n\nPrior Slee built the west gate-house, and in a fillet round the arch, in the side towards the court, in an excellent character of raised letters is cut, Grate pro anima Existopheri Slee Prioris, qui primus hoc opus fieri incipit, A. D. 1528.\n\nThe door with its ornaments, on the south side of the choir, near the bishop's throne; and also the throne was the work of Prior Haythwaite, about the year 1480, his name having been on the backside of it: and the opposite door with its ornaments, is supposed to have been erected by Prior Senhouse, about the year 1500, by the sentence inscribed thereon, \"Vulnera quinque dei sint medicina mei,\" which was that prior's common adage. The tabernacle work in the quire was done at the expence of Bishop Strickland, who came to the see, A. D. 1400.\n\nThere were two chapels, and two chantries, founded within this church; the chapel of St. Catharine was founded by John de Capella, a citizen of Carlisle, which he endowed with certain burgage houses, some lands and rents. In 1366, there being an unjust detention of the rights of this chapel, Bishop Appleby gave notice for restitution in ten days, under pain of excommunication by bell, book, and candle. This chapel was on the south side of the church.\n\nThe chapel of St. Alban in 1356, was on inquiry, found not to have been con∣secrated, and thenceforth divine offices and sepulture were prohibited to be longer performed therein: this appears by an entry in Bishop Welton's register. On the dissolution, King Edward VI. granted the lands and tenements appertaining to this chantry, unto Thomas Dalston and William Denton.\n\nBishop Whelpdale founded a chantry, and endowed it with 200l. for holy offices, for the souls of Sir Thomas Skelton, Knt. and Mr. John Glaston.\n\nThere was a chantry of the holy cross, but who was the founder, and when it was endowed, is not known; King Edward VI. granted the lands and tenements thereto belonging, in Carlisle and Kirklinton, to Hen. Tanner and Tho. Bucher.\n\nIn the middle of the choir, is a monument of Bishop Bell, with his effigies in his pontificals in brass; and an inscription on a marginal fillet of brass.—See\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[figure]\n\ndescription Page 21\n\nthe plate.—He departed this life, A. D. 1496. Bishop William Barrow was buried in St. Catharine's chapel; he died at Rose Castle, A. D. 1429. Bishop John Best was also buried here; he departed this life, A. D. 1560. Bishop Henry Robinson was also buried in this church. There is this remarkable entry in the parish register of Dalston, that he died at Rose Castle, on the 19th day of June, 1616, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and was buried in this cathedral, the same evening about eleven o'clock. In taking down the old hangings and orna∣ments of the high altar to make the late repairs, at the north corner was discover∣ed, a brass plate finely engraven, which had been put up to his memory. The bishop is there represented in his pontisicals, kneeling before one church in ruins, and another lately or newly erected: upon the former is inscribed,\n\nInvenit de∣structum, reliquit extructum et instructum:\n\non the latter,\n\nIntravit per ostium, per mansit fidelis, recessit beatus.\n\nThe devices on the plate are whimsical and grotesque.\n\nUnder the engraving,\n\nHenrico Robinsono Carleolensi S.

Smith, in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1749, we have an account of part of a monumental inscription, found below the bishop's throne.\n\n〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉\n\nThere is no attempt to explain what person was here interred; it is possible the tomb was made antecedent to the building of the throne.\n\nThe whole of this noble edifice is of red freestone, ornamented with pilasters and pointed arches. There have been some statues on the eastern turrets, but they are mutilated, and gone greatly to decay.\n\nNo circumstances are come to our knowledge, touching the religious founda∣tions here, before, or in the time of St. Cuthbert, other than the mention made of them by ancient writers; probably they did exist as several persons speaking of St. Cuthbert's life, tell us he founded, A. D. 686, a convent of monks, a school, and an abbey of nuns: but from Bede's Life of that saint, chap. xvii. it appears the nunnery here, to which Queen Emenburga retired, was existing before St. Cuthbert's visiting Carlisle. Mr. Denton's account of these religious foundations is to the following effect:—\n\nWhen the city was replenished with people, for to maintain better policy in the same; and to inform the people, instead of a nunnery which had been there before, and which William Rufus had translated thence, and established at Ain∣staplighe; or rather in recompence for the lands to that nunnery belonging, had In the 81st year of his Age, and the 13th of his Consecration.

His Deportment in all human Relations and Positions was squared by the Rules of Morality and Religion, under the constant Direction of a consummate Prudence; whilst his Equanimity amidst all Events and Occurrences in an inviolable Adherence to the golden Medium made him easy to himself and agreeable to others, and had its Reward In a chearful Life, a serene old Age, a composed Death. His excellent Pattern Was a continual Lesson of Goodness and Wisdom, and remains in his ever reverable Memory an illustrious Object of Praise and Imitation.\n\ndescription Page 23\n\nfounded another at Ainstaplighe, endowing the same with other revenues there. King Henry I. founded a college of secular priests in the second year of his reign, and made Athwald his confessor or chaplain, (prior of St. Botophs) first prior of Carlisle, dedicating the church to the honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and endowed them with the tithes of the churches then founded in the Forest of Englewood; but being hindred by the tumults and troubles of his time, he could not perfect all things before the 33d year of his reign, and then strucken with grief for the loss of his children, that were drowned coming from Normandy, by the counsel of the Prior Athelwold; and to appease God for his sins, as he thought, he erected a bishop's see at Carlisle, and made the said Athelwald, first bishop thereof, whom the Archbishop of York named Thurstan, did consecrate in the year 1133: and in his stead, another chaplain of the said King Henry, named Walter, was made the second prior of that house, who, a little before his election, had taken upon him, by the king's license, a religious habit, viz. of a regular canon there, which order of canons the king and bishop Athelwold had placed in that house, banishing the secular priests immediately upon his consecration. The said Walter gave to the church of Carlisle for ever in pure alms, his lands in Lynstock, Richardby, Crosby, Little Crosby, Walby, Brunskeugh, Carleton, Little Carleton, and the wood; and the churches or rectories of St. Cuthbert in Carlisle and Staynwings, which the king had given him; and the same gift was confirmed unto them both by the king and bishop Athelwold.\n\nThe rectory of St. Cuthbert's in Carlisle, was founded by the former inhabi∣tants of Carlisle before the Danes overthrew the city, and by them dedicated to the honour of St. Cuthbert of Duresm, who of antient times was lord of the same for fifteen miles about Carlisle. At the first foundation of the church every citi∣zen offered a piece of money, which was a coin of brass then current, which they buried under the foundation of the church steeple there as was found to be true at the late re-edifying of St. Cuthbert's steeple, A. D. ****, for when they took up the foundation of the old steeple, they found well near a bushel of that money.\n\nAfter the said priors, Athelwold and Walter, succeeded John, who gave Water∣croft in Flimby, to the Lord of Workington, son of Gospatrick; and after John, Bartholomew, who, in the time of Bishop Hugh, confirmed Orton in Westmor∣land to the prior of Coneyshead. After him Radulph was prior, who confirmed the impropriation of the rectory of Burgh to the abbey of Holm Cultram, in the time of Walter, bishop of Carlisle.—After Radulph these were priors suc∣cessively: Robert Morvill, Adam Felton, Alanus, Galfridus, John de Horncastle, John de Penrith, William Dalston, Robert Edenhall, Thomas Hoton, Thomas Barnaby, Thomas Hathwaite, Thomas Gudybour, Simon Senhouse, Christopher Slee, Lancelot Salkeld, last prior and first dean.\n\nAfter King Henry VIII. had changed the priory into a deanry and cathedral church of a new foundation, at the suppression of abbeys, adding thereunto, for their better maintenance the revenues of the dissolved priory of Wetheral, a cell\n\ndescription Page 24\n\nof St. Mary's abbey York, dedicating the church to the honour of the holy and and indivisible Trinity.\n\nAfter Salkeld succeeded in the deanry as follows:—\n\n1 Lancelot Salkeld last prior and first dean.\n\n2 Sir Thomas Smith, A.

Waldeive also gave other antient buildings, called Lyons Yards, often remembered in the history of Arthur, written by a monk; the ruins whereof are still to be seen, as it is thought at Ravenglass, distant from Carlisle, accord∣ing to that author, fifty miles, placed near the sea; and, not without reason, thought therefore to be the same,\n\n—DENTON's MS.\n\nMr. Denton's account of the money found in rebuilding the sleeple of St. Cuthbert's church, is rendered uncertain by some late discoveries; and it is most\n\ndescription Page 25\n\nprobable it was a concealed treasure, intended to be secured against the Danes, or some other ravagers: for when the foundations were making for the present new edifice, and the workmen had gone below the foundations of the old church, they discovered the remains of a still more ancient erection, and took up several pieces of broken sculpture; among the rest the figure of a nun with her veil or hood, well cut and in good preservation, which we saw in the garden of George Mounsey, Esq. of Carlisle; so that it should seem the old nunnery stood there. It seems that Walter's foundation was entirely a new one, and not a revival of St. Cuthbert's institution; for, in Tanner we find\n\nHere was a house of Gray, or Franciscan friars,\n\nbefore A. D. 1390; and also a house of Black friars, founded here 53d Henry III.\n\nWalter, the Norman, laid the foundation of the priory, which he dedicated to the Blessed Virgin: it is said he became the head of the society which he had in∣stituted; but authors of great authenticity, speak of his work as being incomplete at the time of his death; and that King Henry I. in the second year of his reign, took it under his patronage, finished it, and endowed it, A. D. 1101, and therein placed regular canons of the order of St. Augustine, appointing Athelwald his confessor and chaplain the first prior. Notwithstanding Denton's account, we are convinced there was a succession of thirty priors after Athelwald, before the time of the dissolution. Athelwald afterwards being made bishop of this diocese, was succeeded in the priory by Walter, another chaplain of the kings', who had taken upon him the regular habit; and being a rigorous disciplinarian, he banished all\n\ndescription Page 26\n\nthe secular priests from that religious house. The original possessions of this priory were very considerable; but the foundation of the see succeeding so im∣mediately almost to that of the priory, there is no possibility of distinguishing them\n\ndescription Page 27\n\nat this time. The property of the prior and bishop were so blended and mingled, that several contentions and disputes arose, touching them; till Gallo the Pope's legate, at their mutual petition, made partition of their lands. The castle of Lin∣stock,\n\ndescription Page 28\n\nin the parish of Stanwix, the capital house of the barony of that name, was for a long series of years, the only palace of the bishops of Carlisle; and in 1293. Johannes Romanus, Archbishop of York, was entertained there, whilst he visited this diocese. The priory was dissolved 9th of Jan. 1540, and the revenues were then valued at 418l. 3s. 4d. ob. 9. according to Dugdale; and 481l. 8s. 1d. Speed. There were cloisters appertaining to this religious house, and also a chapter house, which the dissolute mob, under Cromwell, destroyed: part of the seats, or stalls, of the cloister remain.\n\ndescription Page 29\n\nTHE EPISCOPAL SEE OFCARLISLE\n\nwas instituted and founded by King Henry I. in the year 1133, two and thirty years after the foundation of the priory. By the gift of Egfrid, Carlisle became\n\ndescription Page 30\n\na member of the see of Lindisfarne, and followed the translation of that bishoprick to Chester, and finally to Durham. The cause alledged for dismembering Carlisle, and constituting there a separate see, was on account of the distance from Durham,\n\ndescription Page 31\n\nthen the seat of the episcopacy, and the consequential delays of episcopal duties there. According to Camden, the monks of Durham looked upon this act of the\n\ndescription Page 32\n\nsovereign, as a grievous infringement of their ancient rights and privileges; but from the abject disposition of mind, peculiar to that age, they avoided pointing\n\ndescription Page 33\n\nthe accusation where it was due, and alledged that\n\nwhen Ralph, bishop of Dur∣ham was banished, and the church had none to protect it, certain bishops joined\n\ndescription Page 34\n\nCarlisle and Tiviotdale to their diocese.\n\nIt is observable this is the only Episcopal chapter in England, of the order of St. Austin.\n\n—TANNER.\n\ndescription Page 35\n\nKing Henry constituted Ethelwald, or as he is some times called, Adeluph, then prior there, the first bishop of this new see: and the church of St. Mary then became a cathedral church.\n\ndescription Page 36\n\nEPISCOPUS I.\n\nIN the distant age in which the first Bishop of Carlisle arose, little can be gathered of the virtues of memorable actions of men, though even thus eminent: this obscurity is greatest in a country which was almost a constant scene of military exploits, depredations, and bloodshed. Carlisle, though a chief barrier against the Scots, suffered many changes of fortune, and the life of its bishop was frequently disturbed and full of trouble. From such causes, there is but little historic matter handed down to us, personally rela∣tive\n\ndescription Page 37\n\nto this prelate, and several of his immediate successors. We find him indeed busy in one ecclesiasti∣cal matter, in which he was immediately adversary to the will of his sovereign. He was one of the electors of Henry Murdac, abbot of Fountanis to be archbishop of York. The king's displeasure was such at this transaction, that he denounced vengeance against all those who were concerned in it: but such was this prelate's contempt of the sovereign's menaces and self-confidence, that he received Murdac as his metropolitan, when he came to visit David King of Scotland, then resident in this city. He departed this life, A. D. 1155, and was succeeded by\n\nEPISCOPUS II.\n\nBERNARD, of whom we know little but his episcopal acts.—In 1169, he dedicated the church of St. Mary Magdalene of Lanercost. He remained bishop of Carlisle to the time of his death, which hap∣pened, A. D. 1186. From the long continued vacancy of the see, it appears evidently, that it was in a sad unsettled state, and full of discord and troubles, as well as meanly revenued; for, by the register of Wetheral, it is shewn that King Henry II. being present at Carlisle, tendered the bishoprick to Paulinus de Leedes, and (as such was even an early influence in the ecclesiastical affairs) offered to augment the income with 300 marks out of the churches of Bambrough and Scarbrough, with the chapel of Tick∣hill, and two manors adjacent to Carlisle: but even with such augmentations Paulinus refused it. It continued vacant to the beginning of the 13th century, and King John gave the revenues of the bishop∣rick to support the archbishop of Sclavonia. In 1203, the Pope intermeddled with the income of the see, granting it to the archbishop of Regula, who was obliged to abandon his own, and was destitute of support. This act of the papal authority was confirmed by the king. The continued vacancy let in a flood of enormities among the religious here. The canons publickly announced their contempt of the papal authority, and the censures of his legate: in defiance of all the interdicts and sentences denounced to the contrary, they persisted in celebrating divine services, and all holy offices of the sacraments: but their arrogance and impropieties did not cease there; they swore fealty to the king of Scots, an avowed enemy to the crown of England, and one in open opposition to the authority of the holy see. In conse∣quence of these licentious acts, they set up an interdicted and excommunicated clerk for their bishop, con∣trary to the will of their lawful sovereign, and the pope's legate; and seizing the revenues of the bishoprick, applied them according to their own will. Enormities like these were to be corrected with the severest measures. The council of King Henry III. applied to Pope Honorius III. totally to remove these offensive canons, and place prebends in their room; to augment the revenues of the see, which were so small that no able and loyal person would accept of the bishoprick, and to displace the person who had\n\ndescription Page 38\n\nbeen thus obtruded, to the episcopacy. In consequence of which application, the Legate Gallo, at the pope's command, and with the sovereign's assent, constituted Hugh bishop of this diocese; he being at that time abbot of Belieu; and the canons were banished.\n\nEPISCOPUS III.\n\nHUGH, abbot of Belieu, the elect of Gallo the legate, came to this see when distracted with the offen∣ces of the clergy; yet we do not find that religion was the least abbetted by this prelate: the manners of the religious were not improved, or the errors of those under him reformed; nay, he seemed even doubt∣ful of his own authority, when in the grant made by him to the convent of St. Mary's in York, A. D. 1220, he styles himself, \"Hugo dei gratia Karleolensis ecclesiae vocatus sacerdos;\" so the register of Wetheral shews. He had the favour of his sovereign, and was one of his sureties, in the treaty entered into with Alexander, King of Scotland. The pope was petitioned to assist in the restoration of the churches of Penrith, Newcastle, Rothbury, Corbridge, and Whittingham, to the see; and in the king's letters on this occasion, he stiles him, \"Fidelis noster, cui multo tenemur debito\"—\"ac sanctae Romanae ecclesiae devotissimus.\" There cannot be a more certain channel for obtaining the true history of any man's life, than the writings of cotemporaries and neighbours; by such, this prelate so much devoted to the church, as he is stiled by the king, is accused of alienating the possessions of the see; nay, of making fraudulent distributions thereof; and the chronicle of Lanercost passes this dreadful sentence on his un∣timely death.\n\nThat by the just judgment of God he perished miserably, at the abbey of le Forte, in Bur∣gundy, as he was returning from Rome.\n\nEven if this is the language of truth, it is not that of charity; and shocks the reader, when he perceives it comes from the records of the scriptores of a re∣ligious house:—there is a rancour in it that gives a jealousy, some latent cause had dictated the severe asseveration; and we find by the register of Holm Cultram, that about the year 1220, this bishop of Carlisle caused the convent of Lanercost to relinquish a reserved rent, issuing out of the church of Burgh upon Sands, as not having been obtained by canonical rules. If such a cause dictated the rancorous con∣demnation and judgment, what detestation ought we not to hold these impious men in.\n\nWe do not find that the episcopacy of this place was to be better filled by the successor of Hugh, whose want of learning gave him even a name of disgraceful distinction, that of Malclerk.\n\nEPISCOPUS IV.\n\nWALTER was consecrated, A. D. 1223.—He appears in history, before his episcopacy, in an unpro∣mising character, the friend and intimate counsellor of the base King John; his ambassador to Rome against the dissident barons; and the instigator of those projects which rendered that sovereign's memory detestable for ever; yet we find him promoted by King Henry III. to this see, enriched by the grant\n\ndescription Page 39\n\nof the manor of Dalston: to this, in 1232, by the king's charter, was added, the office of treasurer of the exchequer of England; with power of executing that duty, by deputy of his own nomination. But Walter held this distinguished office but a very short time, though his charter contained an appointment for life; he was discharged in a disgraceful manner without any cause assigned; his grants, the instru∣ments of his office, were ordered to be cancelled, and he was fined 100l the king appointing Peter de Rival his successor; and commanded S. de Segrave, his justiciar, to put him in possession of the treasury, in case Walter refused to deliver the keys, and all things belonging thereto, by inventory and view, and testimony of true men. The affections and frowns of princes are so fluctuating and uncertain, and their causes so frequently arise from the secret influence of villains, who sport with their sovereign's weaknesses, that we should not from thence deduce the character of any man; this reverse of fortune, some attribute to the intrigues of Peter, Bishop of Winchester, who had great influence with the king. Walter would have repaired to Rome for redress, but having got on board a vessel at Dover, he was arrested by the officers of the crown, and brought on shore. The Bishop of London was a spectator of this outrage, and immediately pronounced a sentence of excommunication against those concerned in this arrest: and so earnestly did he engage in this business, that he hasted to Hereford where the king held his court, and with the assistance of several bishops there present, renewed his sentence. But it was not long before Walter was restored to royal favour, being a suitable instrument for the times, in the power of his prince. He was a chief instrument in the contract entered into between the king and the Earl of Winchester's daughter. We find his name among the witnesses to the king's ratification of the great charter: and such confidence was at length placed in him, that he was appointed spiritual tutor to Prince Edward, A. D. 1249. He was joined in commission with the Archbishop of York and William de Cantelupe, as lords justices of the realm in the king's absence. This is the last public character we find him in; and in 1246 he resigned his bishoprick, and became one of the order of preaching friars at Oxford, where he died, A. D. 1248.\n\nEPISCOPUS V.\n\nSYLVESTER DE EVERDON was his successor, being advanced from the archdeaconry of Chester, 9th November, 1246.\n\nHe protected the rights of his bishoprick with ardour, and in his political character, was highly re∣spectable: he opposed the innovations and incroachments the crown attempted against the privileges of the church; particularly in that of the election of bishops; and was one of the prelates, who, in the presence of the king, pronounced the anathema with bell, book, and candle, against those who infringed the liberties of England. He died in 1255, by a fall from his horse; and was succeeded by\n\nEPISCOPUS VI.\n\nTHOMAS DE VETRIPONTE, of the house of the earls of Westmorland, on the 5th Nov. 1255; but of him we have no account further, than that he departed this life in the month of October next, after his consecration, and was immediately succeeded by\n\nEPISCOPUS VII.\n\nROBERT DE CHAUNCY on the 12th of February, 1258, he being advanced to this see from the arch∣deaconry of Bath. He fell into an unhappy opposition to the sherift of Cumberland, which occasioned\n\ndescription Page 40\n\nhis representing to the lord chancellor on the accession of King Edward I. that the bishop had forbidden his tenants to make their fealty to the king. The bishop soon vilified the false representation, and shewed that he had requested the sheriff, by message, to receive their fealty; and made an avowal for himself and his tenants, that they were ready to give every assurance of their duty and fidelity to his majesty. The bishop's character seems to be discovered by his taking occasion, on the application of the abbot of Holm Cultram, who had suffered a distress by the sheriff for the dues of the crown, more through resent∣ment than the necessity of the case, to pronounce a sentence of excommunication against him, which was revoked by the operation of a writ of prohibition. On his death\n\nEPISCOPUS VIII.\n\nRALPH IRTON succeeded to the see, A. D. 1280, He was elected by the prior and convent; but it being alledged they had proceeded therein, contrary to the ordinary rules of their privilege, they were attached to answer the king therein: under the papal authority the dispute was terminated, by conferring the bishoprick on the person elected, by Bull, dated 5th April, A. D. 1280; the holy see claming to have a provisionary power therein; and with which King Edward I. acquiesced.\n\nRalph was of a Cumberland family, and was advanced to this see from the abbacy of Guisburne in Cleveland. He was a steady maintainer of the rights of his church, and supported a suit against Sir Michael de Harcla, by which, A. D. 1281, he recovered the manor and church of Dalston. He was also party in a suit for tythes of new cultured lands, within the forest of Inglewood, claimed to be granted to the church of Carlisle by King Henry I. who enfeoffed the same, \"per quoddam Cornu Eburneum;\" but the grants given in evidence not extending to such tythes, either expressly or by im∣plication, the right was adjudged to the king, and he afterwards granted the same to the prior and convent, as before-mentioned.\n\ndescription Page 41\n\nThis bishop was in great confidence with his sovereign, and received several marks of his royal favour. He was joined in commission with the bishop of Caithness, to collect tenths within the kingdom of Scot∣land. He was one of the king's most confidential commissioners, for adjusting the claims to the crown of Scotland, on the 13th of June and 14th of August, 1291. He appears a witness to the king's claim of right to the kingdom of Scotland, on the death of Queen Margaret, which was subscribed at Nor∣ham, on the 12th of May, 1291. He was one of the plenipotentiaries impowered to contract Prince Edward with the before-mentioned princess; and was an active agent in many other of the most impor∣tant state transactions of his time. Notwithstanding his coming to the see, in the singular manner he did, we do not discover that he ever betrayed any undue influence of the holy see, or any sinister attempts to aggrandize the papal authority in this country, by acts which could infringe the rights of his sovereign, or the people, through any undue extention of the authority of Rome here In March 1291-2, be suf∣fered great fatigue in his journey from London, in deep snow, where he had been to attend parliament; he reached Linstock, where reposing himself after a little refreshment, a blood vessel broke and suffo∣cated him in his sleep. He was succeeded by.\n\nEPISCOPUS IX.\n\nJOHN HALTON, who was a busy man in spiritual, as well as secular concerns. He was one of the canons of Carlisle, and probably of the same political principles with his predecessor, as we see him suc∣ceeding that prelate, in the commission for determining the claims to the crown of Scotland; and he was present in November 1292, when sentence was given for John Baliol, and he did homage for his kingdom. In 1294, he was emissary of King Edward to the court of Scotland, and had letters of safe conduct for his journey. By the pope's authority he was the collector of tenths in the Scotch diocese. He entertained the king and his train at his castle of Rose for a considerable time. He was governor of the castle of Carlisle, A. D. 1302, and had the custody of the Scotch hostages and prisoners. He was joined in commission with the archbishop of York from the holy see, A. D. 1305, to pronounce sentence of excommunication, by bell, book, and candle, against Robert Brus, Earl of Carrick, for the murder of John Cumyn in the church of Dumfries. In the year following, he was one in the commission to ab∣solve all persons for their offences against King Edward's enemies in Scotland, wounding the clergy and spoiling their churches. He was petitioner to the pope for the canonization of Sir Thomas de Cante∣lupe, late bishop of Hereford. In 1308, he was summoned to attend the coronation of King Edward II. He was shut up in Carlisle by the blockade formed by Edward Bruce's forces in 1314, and obliged to appear by proxy in the parliament at Westminster. He was one of the plenipotentiaries of the king, in the treaty of peace with Robert Brus, in 1320, which is the last public capacity, out of his episcopal office, in which we find him on record. He departed this life, A. D. 1324, and was succeeded by\n\nEPISCOPUS X.\n\nJOHN ROSS, 1325, who was imposed upon this see, by the arbitrary disposition of the pope, contrary to the election of the chapter, who had nominated William de Ermya, canon of York; and which elec∣tion had received royal confirmation.\n\nHe was of a refractory and contentious disposition; and though not employed in a political capacity, had business enough upon his hands, in his disputes and litigatious with his clergy. He disturbed the prior and convent in the enjoyment of their revenue, seized their tents and other effects, and interfered with their appropriate churches, insomuch that they were obliged to appeal to the see of Rome; from whence a delegation was sent to the prior of Durham, to hear and determine the complaint. As he was avaricious and refractory, so was he malevolent and revengeful; for taking advantage of some slight omis∣sion,\n\ndescription Page 42\n\nin the prior of Carlisle not paying up certain tenths, or other dues, he pronounced sentence of ex∣communication; the dreadful scourge which was put into the hands of such men, by the powers of the church.—He died at Rose Castle, A. D. 1332. The see was immediately supplied by\n\nEPISCOPUS XI.\n\nJOHN KIRBY, prior of Carlisle, being elected and confirmed, 8th of May, 1332. He came to this episcopacy in a most unhappy aera, both in regard to the public troubles and agitations in the state, and the litigious and unhappy disposition of the clergy. He was continually subject to alarms from the Scots, in consequence of the king of England's unfortunate expeditions and unsuccessful arms; and, added to this, he had gained the contempt and hatred of that people before the advancement to the see: so that, it is said, his ordinations were held in very distant quarters of the kingdom, and he was frequently out of this diocese; and to render his life still more distressful, he was involved in innumerable suits with his clergy.\n\nIn 1337, he was beset by ruffians as he passed through Penrith, who would have assassinated him; and in the fray several of his retinue were wounded. In the month of October, his palace of Rose Castle was burnt by the Scots, and the adjacent country swept of its cattle and flocks, the crops destroyed, and the whole adjoining lands laid waste. He had great trouble in the collection of tenths: he suffered a severe sentence from the court at York, upon his refusing an established vicar to St. Mary's in Carlisle. He was a defaulter in the payment of a large sum to the pope, for tenths in Lincolnshire, for which he suffered suspension and excommunication: but in 1343, we find him again acting in the public capacity of commissioner with Richard, bishop of Durham, and others, to treat with the Scots, touching the set∣tlement of peace and commerce. In 1348, he was appointed to attend the princess, Joan, to Alphonsus, king of Castisle, her contracted confort, for which he was allowed five merks a-day, as board wages, out of the king's exchequer.—He departed this life, A. D. 1352. He was succeeded by\n\nEPISCOPUS XII.\n\nGILBERT WELTON, a person consecrated by the arbitrary authority of the see of Rome, contrary to an election made by the chapter (under the royal licence and confirmation) of the prior of Carlisle, John de Horncastle; but the king was pleased to revoke those powers, in compliance with the dictates of the holy see, and to confirm the consecration of Gilbert.\n\nHe was one of the commissioners appointed by the king to treat for the ransom of David, king of Scotland, and for the establishment of peace between the two nations. In 1359, he was joined with Thomas de Lucy as wardens of the western marches; and in the succeeding years, was one of the com∣missioners in the memorable treaties for acknowledging David king of the Scotch dominions, and for making a renunciation of King Edward's claim of sovereignty over the crown of Scotland.—He died in the latter end of the year 1362, and was succeeded by\n\nEPISCOPUS XIII.\n\nTHOMAS APPLEBY, who, under the king's licence, was elected by the prior and convent out of their own canons; but by an interposition of the papal authority the election was annulled, and he came to the see by provision from the holy see, 18th of January, 1363.\n\ndescription Page 43\n\nHe appears in several commissions of great moment, and was joined with several men of high rank in the wardenship of the west marches: and shortly before his death, he was in the commission for proclaim∣ing on the borders, the articles of a truce concluded with France and Scotland. His particular cha∣racter is not delivered down to us; he appears to have been peaceful with his clergy, and steady in his loyalty.—He departed this life, A. D. 1395. The chapter, with the usual licence, proceeded to an election for a successor, and they accordingly chose one William Strickland; but here the pope shewed an absolute disapprobation, and refused to consecrate him; and, of his own nomination, placed in this see\n\nEPISCOPUS XIV.\n\nROBERT REED, A. D. 1396, who was translated to Chichester in the course of the same year, and was succeeded in Carlisle by\n\nEPISCOPUS XV.\n\nTHOMAS MERKS.—We have no evidence before us, whether he was the nominee of the chapter, or otherwise: he was one of the monks of Westminster, and a great adherent to the unhappy monarch, Richard II. in whose will he was named an executor. The history of that particular aera is not wanted to shew the reader from what principles he stood an advocate in parliament for the deposed king: his attachment was so warm, and his temper so regardless of every thing but truth, that in the first sessions under King Henry IV. he pronounced the severest condemnations on the measures and the men, by which the revolution had been effected; and even treated the reigning prince with that derogation and con∣tempt, that he was committed for high treason, and deprived of his bishoprick. On the 23d of January, A. D. 1400, the king consented he should be removed from the Tower to Westminster. This relaxation of offended majesty was soon after followed by a permission, under letters patent, to obtain from the pope, in benefices of the court of Rome, appointments of the yearly amount of an hundred merks; but episco∣pacy was excepted. In 1404, we find him get institution to the rectory of Todenham in Gloucestershire. The king made his petition to the holy see, that the bishoprick of Carlisle might be supplied by the consecration of\n\nEPISCOPUS XVI.\n\nWILLIAM STRICKLAND, who, in 1363, had been rejected by his holiness; and who now came to this see, 24th of August, 1400. It cannot be doubted, from the channel by which he had his advancement, that he was a strict adherent to the interests of the reigning prince; and accordingly we find his name among the prelates who subscribed the act of succession, and assurance of the crown of England, to the sons of King Henry. We also find him in the commission issued for the arrest and imprisonment of all persons, professing their dissatisfaction in the then settlement of the crown; and who, to encourage faction and disorder, caused it to be reported, that King Richard II. lately deposed and dead, was still living within the dominions of Scotland, by means of which evil reports, the late adherents of that monarch were spirited up to tumult and rebellion. In fact, this was a commission of persecution: the family of the unhappy monarch deposed, had considerable interests and connections of blood in the northern parts, and also much power; so that this commission was sent forth as a scourge at once to repress and humble them; and also to put them in the power of the minions of a court, whose interests on such occasions, may well be devised, and whose use of such an instrument is known.—Bishop Strickland departed this life on the 30th day of August, A. D. 1419, after having held the see near twenty years. He was in∣terred in the cathedral of Carlisle, his monument and effigies being in the north aile. He was succeeded by\n\nEPISCOPUS XVII.\n\nROGER WHELPDALE, of a Cumberland family, a man (allowed by all writers) of great learning. He had his education in Baliol College, Oxford, where he gained a fellowship; he removed into Queen's College, where he was made provost; and on the 12th of October, 1419, he was elected bishop of this diocese, having previously obtained the provision of the see of Rome in his favour, his election followed of course.\n\nAs bishop of Carlisle, we do not find him an active character in church or state. The dispositions made by his will were to pious uses; and his writings, though not numerous, were well received in the age he appeared in.—He died in January, A. D. 1422, and was succeeded by the translation of\n\ndescription Page 44\n\nEPISCOPUS XVIII.\n\nWILLIAM BARROW from the see of Bangor, by the sole authority of Rome. He was doctor of Canon Law, and chancellor of the university of Oxford.\n\nWe have few materials from whence to deduce his character, whilst he held this bishoprick; we find him named in the commission, for entering into a truce with the Scots, at Hawden Stank; and in 1429, he appears among the bishops who protested against Cardinal Beaufort's executing the office of prelate of the garter at Windsor on St. George's day, in right of his bishoprick at Winchester.—He departed this life on the 24th day of September, A. D. 1429, at his Castle of Rose, and was buried in the cathedral of Carlisle. His successor was\n\nEPISCOPUS XIX.\n\nMARMADUKE LUMLEY, who had election by the chapter, but for want of the pope's consent, had not restitution of the temporal rights of the see till the 15th of April, 1431. He was one of the noble family of Lumley in the county of Durham.\n\nHe suffered great injuries and losses by the depredations committed by the Scots repeatedly within his diocese; insomuch, that it is said, he was straitened to support his episcopal dignity. In 1435, he was one of the commissioners to treat with the delegates of Scotland. In 1449, he was translated to the see of Lincoln, by virtue of the pope's provision.\n\nEPISCOPUS XX.\n\nNICHOLAS CLOSE, the king's chaplain, and archdeacon of Colchester, succeeded to this bishoprick: he had been chancellor of the university of Cambridge, and there had the degree conferred on him of doctor of divinity. He had gained the esteem of his sovereign, by his excellent conduct in the treaty of peace, concluded with the king of Scots, the year before his advancement to the episcopacy, in which transaction he was joined in commission with the lord privy seal, the lord treasurer, and comptroller of the household, and others. He was a commissioner to examine into the conduct of the wardens of the marches, and conservators of the truce; that their irregularities and offences might be punished. In the succeeding year, 1452, he was one in the commission for receiving the homage of James, Earl of Douglas, and others of the Scotch nobility, who should make application for that purpose. In the same year he was translated to Litchfield, but departed this life in the month of November, possessed of the accustomed provisionary instrument.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXI.\n\nWILLIAM PERCY succeeded to the see. We know nothing of his political or episcopal character; he was son of the Earl of Northumberland, and was for some time chancellor of the university of Cambridge. He departed this life in the year 1462. The profits of the bishoprick, during the vacancy of the see, were granted by King Edward IV. to Doctor John Kingscott, in part satisfaction of a royal debt, with the specious countenance of a reward for singular services: and soon after, he was consecrated bishop of the see, before he could either be reimbursed the debt, or receive a gratuity out of the revenues.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXII.\n\nJOHN KINGSCOTT came in by the election of the convent, with the royal assent and papal confirmation, notwithstanding any sinister views there might be in his being put into the receipt of the revenue origi∣ginally. But he did not live to enjoy the dignity long, departing this life, A. D. 1463, and leaving his exalted station without any memorable or characteristic events. The king was not dilatory in appropriating\n\ndescription Page 45\n\nthe profits of the bishoprick, granting the temporalties to Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick and Salisbury. The chapter proceeded to an election, and by the provision of the holy see,\n\nEPISCOPUS XXIII.\n\nRICHARD SCROOP was advanced to this bishoprick, A. D. 1464, and enjoyed it four years; depart∣ing this life 16th of May, 1468.—He was one of those prelates, whose episcopacy furnishes the historian with nothing more than the dates of consecration and exit.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXIV,\n\nEDWARD STOREY succeeded to the see, by the election of the chapter, with the other confirming powers, A. D. 1468. He was a man of a liberal and benevolent spirit, and was one in whom com∣missions of great trust were reposed. His munificence was singular, though the bishoprick of Carlisle seems to retain the fewest distinguishing marks of it. He bestowed considerable possessions on Pembroke Hall in Cambridge. He was a liberal benefactor to the church of Ely. He founded, at Chichester, a free school, one of his most distinguished acts of charity. He augmented the revenue of the see of Chichester, with valuable gifts in lands; and the dean and chapter there had considerable donations. The most mistaken appropriation his benevolence dictated to him, and which from his opulence took place, was building the new cross in the market-place of Chichester, and giving to the corporation there an estate for its repairs and perpetual maintenance In 1471, we see him named among the prelates who took an oath of fealty to Edward, then Prince of Wales. He was a commissioner in several of the treaties with the Scotch, and particularly in that of the marriage of the Princess Cecily, second daugh∣ter of the king. He was translated to the see of Chichester in the year 1477, where he died and was interred. By the ordonance of the holy see, he was succeeded in the bishoprick of Carlisle by\n\nEPISCOPUS XXV.\n\nRICHARD BELL prior of Durham, who received the temporalties of this see, 24th of April 1478. Though he possessed this bishoprick to the time of his death, which happened in 1496, in the course of eighteen years we collect nothing singular in his life. Whilst he was prior of Durham he was in several royal commissions of treaty with the powers of Scotland; but his name, during his episcopacy, has not occured to me in any record of moment.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXVI.\n\nWILLIAM SEVER, his successor, was abbot of St. Mary's in York. He had his education at Oxford, and seems to be derived from mean parentage from the place of his birth, a village near the city of Dur∣ham. He was made bishop of Carlisle, A. D. 1496, and by royal licence held his abbacy in commen∣dam. He was in commission to treat about the marriage of the Princess Margaret, daughter of King Henry VII. with James, King of Scotland. In the year 1497, he was in the general treaty with James of Scotland; and in 1499, he was one of the conservators of the truce, signed and sworn to by both the sovereigns. He was translated to Durham, A. D, 1502, and succeeded in this bishoprick by\n\nEPISCOPUS XXVII.\n\nROGER LEYBURN, who was consecrated 1st of September, 1503. He is one of the vacant characters in our history, departing this life, A. D. 1507. He was of a Westmorland family, had his education at Cambridge, was master of Pembroke Hall, and some time archdeacon and chancellor of Durham.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXVIII.\n\nJOHN PENNY was his successor in 1508, and he died in 1520. He had his education in Lincoln col∣lege, Oxford; was abbot of Leicester, and bishop of Bangor, from whence he was translated; the pope's bull bearing date at Rome, the 21st day of September. We now advance to a busy and significant character in his successor.\n\ndescription Page 46\n\nEPISCOPUS XXIX.\n\nJOHN KYTE, who was a man of distinguished parts; though his parentage is not handed down to us, or the nature and place of his education, yet he figured in the offices of the church, in an age when many great characters flourished, without any other advantages than great powers of genius and servility of principles. In the reign of King Henry VII. he was ambassador to Spain: he was also subdean of the royal chapel; and in the year 1513, he was made archbishop of Armagh in Ireland. The influence of Cardinal Wolsey obtained him many dignities; and he was devoted to his service in return; he consulted our bishop on his most momentous concerns, and conversed with him on matters of the highest nature with the greatest familiarity. In the melancholy reverse of his fortune, the friendship was not broken, and the cardinal received his support from the bishop's hands. In 1521, Bishop Kyte, on his installation at Carlisle, resigned the archbishoprick of Avmagh, and took the titular bishoprick of Thebes in Greece. He was one of the commissioners of King Henry VIII. to treat for a cessation of hostilities with Scot∣land, and in 1526, he was one of the plenepotentiaries for establishing peace with King James V. In the year 1529, we find his name among those who signed their approbation of the king's scruples con∣cerning his marriage; and acquiescing with the vices and enormities of that monster of impiety and arro∣gance. Launched so far in the intrigues of a corrupt court, we see his name mixed with those minions, who servilely courted the king's smiles with the forfeiture of virtue. He was one of the four bishops who addressed Pope Clement, the seventh, in the matter of the king's divorce: but in the latter years of his life, after the cardinal was removed, and the political countenance of the court changed, he was wavering in his principles. He was a strong opposer of Cranmer, and the rising spirit of reformation; and in that department, was a public adherent to the archbishoprick of York.—He died in London, 29th of June, 1537, and was buried at Stepney.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXX.\n\nROBERT ALDRIDGE succeeded to the see, A. D. 1537. As he lived in a busy age, and was present to many great changes in church and state, one should expect from a man of so great a character, as to his learning, one whom Erasmus called in his early years, \"blanda eloquentiae Juvenis,\" a poet and ora∣tor of more than ordinary note, that he would have been a shining figure in the multiform business of this part of Henry's reign: but we may judge from his constantly holding the appointments he had, that he temporized with the vereing measures of the prince; and like the notorious, though perhaps, imagi∣nary character of the vicar of Bray, still keeping the saddle, let the object of the pursuit be what it might. The servility that strikes the idea, when one conceives such a character, in the time of this monarch, in∣inspires aversion. It may be a harsh sentence, but it proceeds from a fact, that produces large and na∣tural inferences. Let us attend to his progress in life. Buckinghamshire was the place of his birth, and\n\ndescription Page 47\n\nhe received his education at Eaton, till the year 1507, when he was appointed a scholar of King's col∣lege, Cambridge. He was once proctor of that university; and from thence he became master, fellow, and provost of Eaton. About the year 1529, he was made bachelor of divinity at Oxford, and the fol∣lowing year took up his doctor's degree. Soon after, he was appointed archdeacon of Colchester; and in the year 1537, was installed a canon at Windsor, and made register of the order of the garter. He was an opposer of Cranmer, and adhered to the Romish profession of faith; indeed, in the work called the Bishop's Book, containing the godly and pious institution of a christian, it is said he joined with that archbishop; but touching the doctrine of the seven sacraments, his opinion was immediately opposite: and he promoted the act of 31st King Henry VIII. touching the six articles, contrary to every effort of Cranmer.—He departed this life, 1555, and was succeeded by\n\nEPISCOPUS XXXI.\n\nOWEN OGLETHORP; who, by the inconsistencies in his public actions, seems to have been a very weak man. He received the temporalties of this bishoprick in the month of October, in the year 1556; but the pope's confirmatory bull did not arrive till the month of January following. He was born at a small village, near Tadcaster, in the county of York, of inferior parents, and had his education in Magdalene College, Oxford. In the year 1531, he was proctor of the university, and soon after was entered bache∣lor of divinity. In the year 1535, he was chosen president of the college; and in 1551, had the distin∣guished office of vice chancellor. He was made a canon, and soon after dean, of the royal chapel at Windsor; and in the first year of Queen Mary's reign, he was appointed secretary to the order of the garter: this was a year of great honour to him, for in it he held the presidency of Magdalene College, the rectories of Newington and Hassely, in Oxfordshire; together with the deanry of Windsor. In 1554, he was one of the appointed disputants in the controversy with Cranmer, Latimer, and Rydley; and shewed himself a most inveterate adversary to the principles of reformation, and even to that humane rule, toleration. In 1558, we see him acting in the inconsistent character I intimated; for, during the vacancy of the see of Canterbury, when all the bishops had refused to officiate in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth: he only, the lowest of the tribe, the bitterest in the measures against reformists, and the inte∣rests of the protestant church; he only could be found to place the crown on the head of that illustrious princess: the lords of the council, willing that the ceremony should have every outward dignity, sent for all the pontifical robes, and ensigns of high office, used by the archbishop on that solemn occasion, that our prelate might be duely habited for the occasion. It is not to be reconciled, how Oglethorpe could be influenced to this office; the character of the princess, and her sentiments in religious matter, were no secrets; and the bishop's faith and sentiments were publicly avouched: the inconsistency is not to be reconciled, but by the discovery of those influences and private springs of the state, which are long since locked up in the impenetrable regions of oblivion. How must he have been shocked and confounded, whilst the ceremony was performing, by the command of the queen not to elevate the consecrated host, in the celebration of mass, usual in this solemnity, \"because she liked it not. Wood, with a voice of commiseration, would palliate the error with his pity:\n\nFor the fact, when he saw the issue of the mat∣ter, and both himself and the whole tribe of his secret order deprived, the churches holy laws, and faith against the conditions of her consecration, and acception into that royal office violated, he fore repented him all the days of his life, which were, for that special cause, both short and wearisome.\n\nIn the first parliament he gave his vote against the bills for restitution of first fruits, for restoring the supremacy, exchange of bishops lands, and uniformity of the common prayer. He would willingly, by his adherence to his old partizans, have recovered a reputation he had lost, by being a tool to the pre∣vailing party; and, by his unsteadiness, he dropt to the ground between the two. The council fined him 250l. for non-attendance at Sewel's challenge in disputation, A. D. 1559, as her majesty had commanded; and shortly after he was deprived of his bishoprick, worth 268l.\n\nHis death was sudden, but the cause uncertain; the popular report was, that it happened in an apo∣plexy. He was privately buried at St. Dunstan's in the west. By his will, he ordered the foundation of a school and hospital, at Tadcaster, with an ample endowment.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXXII.\n\nJOHN BEST who succeeded to the bishoprick, was a man of a different cast, of the true reformists principles; and one who had lived obscurely during the reign of Quen Mary, to conceal himself from\n\ndescription Page 48\n\nthe rage and intemperate zeal that distinguished that short, but unhappy period. He was born in the northern parts of Yorkshire, of parents of a low station, and had his education in the university of Oxford. He was consecrated, A. D. 1560, when he was 48 years of age. The unsettled and turbu∣lent estate of the north was such, that he was obliged to have a commission to arm himself and depen∣dants within his bishoprick, against the tumultuous and enraged populace. He was one of those who was created doctor in divinity by Doctor Humphreys, the queen's professor at Oxford, at a private con∣vention in London; and he subscribed the Saxon homilies. —He died 22d of May, 1570, and was in∣terred in this cathedral.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXXIII.\n\nRICHARD BARNES was his successor. From this period of time, the business and importance of bishops in secular affairs declined: in their spiritual powers they were so reduced, that only within their respec∣tive bishopricks, they held the authorities consistent with the ancient rules of the common law, without the superlative aid of the see of Rome; so that, from this aera the history of our prelates becomes little more than personal. Bishop Barnes was born in the county of Lancaster, and educated in Brazen Nose College, Oxford, where he took a degree of master of arts, and was elected a fellow. He had a degree of bachelor of divinity at Cambridge, was chancellor of the cathedral at York, and residentiary canon there for the prebendary of Loughton. In 1567, he was eonsecrated suffragan bishop of Nottingham; and in 1570, was consecrated bishop of Carlisle. By Rymer, it appears, so soon as he was possessed of the church of Rumaldkirk, he should vacate Stokesley, which he held with his bishoprick, together with Stonegrave. In 1577, he was translated to the see of Durham where he died.—He was succeeded by\n\nEPISCOPUS XXXIV.\n\nJOHN MEYE, who was consecrated bishop of this see, A. D. 1577. In 1560, he was master of Catharine Hall, and 1570, was vice chancellor of Cambridge. He is marked by some writers as being intemperately anxious after worldly wealth. That he attempted to obtain from the chapter some bene∣ficial leases for relations. Under pretence that Rose Castle was held by the warden of the marches, in these times of eminent hazard from the Scots, he endeavoured to obtain, in commendam, the living of Darfield, as a place of retreat and security. —The annexed note is extracted from the Dalston register.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXXV.\n\nHENRY ROBINSON, his successor, was born in the city of Carlisle, and was educated in Queen's College, Oxford, where he had a fellowship, and had an excellent reputation for learning and piety. Whilst he was master of arts, in 1576, he was chosen principal of Edmund hall, and in 1581, he was made provost of Queens, in which office he exerted himself in the reformation of certain innovations and improprieties, which had crept in by the negligence of his predecessors; he saw the college return to its former splen∣dor and significance; and in eighteen years attendance, brought it back to its once flourishing state. He was consecrated bishop of Carlisle, in 1598, having enjoyed the degree of doctor in divinity for eight years.—He died at Rose Castle, the 19th day of June, 1616, as it is supposed, of the plague, as he was interred a few hours after his exit.—His successor\n\nEPISCOPUS XXXVI.\n\nROBERT SNOWDEN, was a Nottinghamshire man by birth: he was consecrated bishop of Carlisle, in November 1616. Before this advancement, he was prebendary of Southwell. He departed this life in London, in the spring of the year 1621, and was succeeded by\n\ndescription Page 49\n\nEPISCOPUS XXXVII.\n\nRICHARD MILBURNE, a native of Gilsland, who was translated from St. Davids' to the see of Chester, in September 1621. He was vicar of Sevenoak in Kent; sometime dean of Rochester, and from thence was advanced to the bishoprick of St. Davids'. He left 600l. for the endowment of an hospital and school, and departed this life, A. D. 1624. There is a single sermon of his extant, on the subject of the imposition of hands, preached and published whilst he was vicar of Sevenoak.—His successor\n\nEPISCOPUS XXXVIII.\n\nRICHARD SENHOUSE was a native of Cumberland, of the Netherhall family, and came to the see in June 1624. He was a student in Trinity College, Cambridge, was elected a fellow of St. Johns', and in 1622, obtained a degree of doctor of divinity. He had his promotion from the crown; for, from a chaplainship in the Bedford family, he became chaplain to Prince Charles, and afterwards to King James, who appointed him to the deanry of Glocester, and from thence to this bishoprick.—He died by a fall from his horse, in May 1626, and was interred in the cathedral of Carlisle.\n\nEPISCOPUS XXXIX.\n\nFRANCIS WHITE succeeded to the see in December 1626. From a state of obscurity we see him emerging to fame, by the zeal with which he preached against the church of Rome, and by his book against Fisher. From the ruins of the ancient church, arose innumerable sectaries; the great stock was hewn down, and from the roots issued a multitude of ungrafted shoots, bearing unprofitable fruit; among others, the Arminian principles were introduced: this bishop even taught them on the solemn festival of Christmas, in the chapel-royal, in the hearing of his sovereign, and soon after was translated to the see of Norwich: so formidable was the growth of innovations in religion, and arminianism in particular, that they occasioned a parliamentary inquiry. From his fervour against the papists, he was employed by the king, as a spy upon the conduct of the countess of Denbeigh, who was much inclined to listen to the rules of that faith; to reward him for his assiduity in that duty, he first was made dean of Carlisle, and then appointed to the bishoprick. He did not stop at Norwich, but was advanced to the see of Ely in 1631, and departed this life six years afterwards. Upon his translation to Norwich, he was succeeded in the see of Carlisle by\n\nEPISCOPUS XL.\n\nBARNABY POTTER, who, in those days of division and new devices in the sacred temple, arose to signi∣ficance by his zeal as a puritanical preacher. He was born in the county of Westmorland, within the barony of Kendal, was a student in Queen's College, Oxford, where he held a fellowship. In 1615, he took his degree in divinity, and was elected provost after he had distinguished himself in Devonshire by his puritanical doctrines. He was one of the king's chaplains, and was consecrated bishop of this see in March 1628, and died in the year 1641.\n\nEPISCOPUS XLI.\n\nJAMES USHER his successor in the bishoprick of Carlisle, was a man of deep erudition, and a zealous protestant, without bigotry and fanaticism, too much the lincture of the age. He held the revenues of this bishoprick, in commendam, by the grant of King Charles I. as a compensation for his great suffer∣ings in his archbishoprick of Armagh in Ireland, by the commotions in that kingdom. He was, by birth, an Irishman, and had his education in the university of Dublin. He was promoted to the bishop∣rick of Meath in 1620, and four years afterwards was advanced to the archbishoprick. With difficulty, and a parsimonious hand, he subsisted on the revenues of our see, diminished and exhausted as they were by the armies of England and Scotland, alternately quartering in this county; at length the seizure which was made by parliament on all the lands of bishops, brought him to great distress. In consideration of his eminent character, his learning and virtuous zeal, he had a pension of 400l. a-year granted to him, by parliamentary order, but it was paid very ill, insomuch that he never received it above once or twice.\n\nHe died in March 1655 at the countess of Peterborough's, at Rygate, Surry, in the 76th year of his age: Cromwell, from what principle it cannot be divined, not agreeable to his character, from some sini∣ster view or private influence, ordered him to be buried at the public charge, in Westminster abbey; to defray the expence of which, he gave a draft upon the treasury for 200l.\n\nAnd this he did out of an\n\ndescription Page 50\n\nhonourable respect to the memory of so learned a champion of the Protestant cause, as the archbishop was,\n\nso say our authors, Nicholson and Burn. But he was a wretch whose soul could not be touched with such sentiments; hypocrisy, or some low and selfish view intitled him to display this honour and pomp, at the interment of a man, whom he and his creatures had starved to death; inconsistent and abo∣minable are the two contrarieties. Cromwell gave-directions that the bishop's library should not be sold without his consent; but it was plundered of many of the valuable manuscripts; the soldiers took many choice books at a price of their own making, and in the confusion which then distracted the state, the collection was mutilated and greatly prejudiced. The books which escaped the hands of ruffians were given by King Charles II. to the college of Dublin.—On the restoration of King Charles II. this see was supplied by\n\nEPISCOPUS XLII.\n\nRICHARD STERN was elected, a person of little note by birth. He had his education in Cambridge, was master of Jesus College, and took the degree of doctor in divinity. He was domestic chaplain to archbishop Laud, and attended on the scaffold at his execution. He was a prisoner in the tower with several others, upon a complaint made by Cromwell, who was then one of the burgesses of Cambridge, that they had conveyed the college plate for the king's relief at York: from this cause he was dispossessed of his several appointments, and lived in obscurity till the restoration. In 1664 he was translated to York, and died there in 1683. The character given of him by bishop Burnet, we think ought to receive great credit from the known integrity of the writer; and he intimates that\n\nhe was a sour, ill-tempered man, and was chiefly studious of measures to enrich his family: he was particularly attached to the court and servile in adopting the measures then moved in; that he was zealous in the affairs of the duke of York, and was strongly suspected of popery.\n\nNicholson and Burn have attempted to rescue his character by the publication of a letter which they say was written from York to his successor at Carlisle; but is anonymous, and if it is from the hand of any person of note, it was as easy to subscribe the name, to give it weight and authority, as to publish the sentences to give him a superficial character.\n\nHe was greatly respected, and generally lamented. All the clergy commemorate his sweet condescensions, his free communications, faithful counsels, exemplary temperance, chearful hospitality, and bountiful charity\n\n; such is this epistolary panegyric; and which is only equalled by his monumental inscrip∣tion. Bishop Burnet must have been basely inveterate or deceived. But pursuing our authors, we find them speak of him in language not so very full of praise, on the following occasion. His suc∣cessor\n\ndescription Page 51\n\nsettling at Rose-Castle\n\nthe only remaining habitable house then belonging to the see; and finding even this in a most miserable condition, a great part of it having been burnt by the Scots in the late rebellion, and the chapel (which was the only repair bishop Sterne pretended to, notwithstanding what is said in the flattering epitaph above-mentioned, although he had received the immense advantages of coming to the see, when all the leases were either totally or near expired) being so ill done that it was necessary to take it entirely down, the bishop thought it expedient to proceed against his metropolitan a"
