        "text": "We are currently busy dealing with our ACU License holders only for the first half of the year, so if you have an ACU licence and would like to be booked in for a fitting, please get in touch at race.dept@rst-moto.com for availability. We will be taking bookings for Non-ACU License holders from approx May onwards, so please get in touch with us for appointment availability.\n\nMost of our products carry a standard 2 year warranty, with the exception of our heated glove batteries: which carry a 12 month warranty. Please note if any item is queried under warranty we do require a proof of purchase to clarify the date - this can be a receipt or a card statement. For further information please contact our support team by visiting https://www.rst-moto.com/product-warranty-registration\n\nFor more information on RSTâ€™s In&Motion integrated airbag systems then please follow the below link https://uk.inemotion.com/en/support/topic/moto/ This link has the answers to all of your airbag queries.\n\nHere is a link to the In&Motion instructions via PDF. This manual shows you everything from setting up your box, learning how to keep it up to date and learn what your lights mean when there is a fault. https://us.inemotion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/User-Manual-Inbox-USA-2020-V1.pdf\n\nIf you are experiencing a warranty issue with any of your items purchased, then the first step to take is to source out your proof of purchase and contact the store you purchased this from. They will ask for you to return the faulty item for them to see. Once back they will fill out a return application with us and we will collect this to have it inspected by one of our technical advisors. This processing time can vary dependant on the time of the year, so we usually quote a 7-10 working day time frame, this includes shipment timing too."
