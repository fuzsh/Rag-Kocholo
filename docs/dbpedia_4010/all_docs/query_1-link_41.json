        "text": "August 15 we went to the Cathedral in the morning, the service is well performed the Cathedral is nice but not very striking part of it is converted into\n\na parish church the only one in Carlisle; we then inspected the objects worthy of notice which appears the bridge the Castle and the session house part of the castle have been rebuilt at different times Mary Queen of Scots was confined in one of the towers for nearly 2 years It was founded by William 2nd the session house and bridge are built by Smirke in the evening we again attended the Cathedral\n\nOBSERVATIONS & COMMENTS:\n\nCarlisle Cathedral was begun in 1122, during the reign of King Henry I, as a community of Canons Regular, influenced by the ascetic practices of the Cistercians. Many large churches of Augustinian foundation were built in England during this period as the Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, was a member of this order, but Carlisle is one of only four Augustinian churches in England to become a cathedral, most monastic cathedrals being Benedictine. The church was begun by Athelwold, an Englishman, who became the first prior. In 1133, the church was raised to the status of cathedral and Athelwold became the first Bishop of Carlisle.\n\nThe castle now houses the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment and the Border Regiment Museum. Excavations have dated the Roman timber fort constructed at the site of present Carlisle Castle to the winter of AD 73, Until 400, the Roman occupation fluctuated in importance. At one time, it broke off from Rome when Marcus Carausius assumed power over the territory. He was assassinated and suffered damnatio memoriae, but a surviving reference to him has been uncovered in Carlisle. Coins excavated in the area suggest that Romans remained in Carlisle until the reign of Emperor Valentinian II, from 375 to 392. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle_Castle\n\nSession House: There is no specific reference to the Session House, but Joseph Massey, Curator of The Wordsworth Trust and Tullie House., in Carlisle’s Historic Buildings refers to Smirke: “The Citadel was in poor condition by the early 19th century and so it was rebuilt to the plans of Robert Smirke."
