        "text": "High Sheriff of Cumbria\n\nJulie Barton, 2020/2021\n\nJulie Barton grew up in Ulverston, attending St Mary’s RC Primary School and Ulverston Victoria High School. She went on to study at Durham University. After graduation in 1989, Julie returned to Furness and started her career as a teacher at Holy Family School, Barrow-in-Furness. Julie and Peter married in 1990 and have two grown up sons.\n\nIn 1993 Julie actively supported Peter in setting up Forge Europa, an LED lighting company based in Ulverston and Dalton-in-Furness. They started the business in the spare room at home from a standing start with no customers, no suppliers and no financial backers. Together they led Forge Europa to become an innovative lighting company with customers in over 20 countries. Julie was instrumental in the company winning a Queen’s Award for Outstanding Innovation in 2009. She continues to lead the way on corporate and social responsibilities across an international supply chain and in excellence in environmental management.\n\nJulie has always taken an active role in community involvement both in her personal and professional life. She led Forge Europa to be the first manufacturing company in the North-West to be awarded the CommunityMark. Julie has many years’ experience as a supporter of various charities, as a governor of Furness College, a parish councillor, a catechist in her home parish, as a supporter of Ulverston’s festivals and as a fundraiser.\n\nAs High Sheriff, Julie has chosen to focus on tackling social isolation and loneliness as the theme for her shrieval year. She will also be actively supporting Cumbria Community Foundation.\n\nNews & Events 2020/2021\n\nHigh Sheriff Charity Cross Bay Walk\n\n31 July 2021\n\nI am very pleased to let you know that the High Sheriff of Cumbria Cross Bay Walk, which was postponed in 2020, will now go ahead on Saturday 31st July 2021 at 10:45am. This iconic 8-9 mile walk across the sands from Arnside to Grange Promenade, Grange-over-Sands, will be led by Guide over the Sands, Michael Wilson, who has guided thousands of walkers safely over the bay. I am delighted that we will also be joined by this year’s High Sheriff of Cumbria, David Beeby.\n\nTickets are on sale now from the Cumbria Community Foundation with entry fees of only £13 per adult and £8 for those 16 years and under (minimum age is 9 years). Advanced booking is essential, and tickets are likely to sell out fast.\n\nDavid Beeby is installed as the new High Sheriff of Cumbria\n\n31 March 2021\n\nDavid Beeby is installed as the new High Sheriff of Cumbria in a virtual installation ceremony. Accompanying photos were taken in preparation on 29th March 2021.\n\nThank you to everyone for sharing in my year as High Sheriff and celebrating all the amazing volunteers, organisations, communities, charities, businesses, frontline workers, faith and church groups and individuals who have stepped forward during the pandemic and helped to make Cumbria a better place. Thank you for liking and sharing my posts, I have reached more people with their remarkable stories, than I could ever have hoped to do on my own.\n\nI have lived in Cumbria for nearly all my life, but in the last year I have gained an incredible and humbling new insight into the county I thought I knew so well. Cumbria is amazing! It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as the High Sheriff of Cumbria.\n\nWith many thanks and very best wishes, Julie Barton\n\n29 March to 31 March 2021\n\nI was delighted to meet with the three outstanding award-winning businesses and most of the excellent charities who had received High Sheriff Awards on 24th March.\n\nHigh Sheriff of Cumbria Awards Celebration Event\n\n24 March 2021\n\nI was privileged to organise and host an online awards event and present awards to three outstanding businesses and fourteen excellent charities.

It was fascinating to meet virtually and learn so much about the residents of Haverigg HMPS from Custodial Manager, Dawn Hawthorne. The rehabilitation culture at Haverigg stood out through its shared aspirations of providing residents with the right skills, expectations, social care, and the best attitudes to meet their sentence plans and become ready for release. With many older prisoners, Dawn talked about healthcare provision in prison. Her job satisfaction comes from people successfully integrating back into the community. Thank you to Dawn and her colleagues in the prison service for their frontline work. I thoroughly enjoyed our meeting.\n\nHaverigg HMPS – A Multifaith Chaplaincy\n\nIt’s always great to chat with Fr Bob (Fr Robert Halshaw) and hear about his prison ministry. He is the Senior Chaplain at Haverigg, where chaplains of different faiths work together to support residents. Lockdown has paused communal worship in prisons, but pastoral care continues through phone and socially distanced face to face meetings, newsletters, and shared faith materials. With no visitors allowed due to Covid, the chaplaincy facilitates Purple Visits (approved meetings for residents with their loved ones via the internet). Listening to how the chaplains of different faiths support anyone who asks, regardless of their religious preference, reflects the chaplaincy’s collaborative work, respect and understanding.\n\nCivil Nuclear Constabulary in Cumbria\n\n22 March 2021\n\nCumbria is one of only 10 areas with a Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) and with hundreds of officers, the Cumbrian Unit is the largest in the UK. Based at Sellafield, they are patrolling 24/7 with authorised firearms officers, armoured vehicles, and specialist police dogs to protect our communities. Their ethos is Deter, Defend, Deny and Recover. Some of their highly trained officers can be deployed to where there is an immediate need; G7 Summit, Olympics, party conferences, or potential threats in our cities. Training and retraining are key. At Sellafield, the CNC has one of the best indoor firearms ranges in the world, where 360-degree live firing skills can be practised. The CNC also provides armed escorts for nuclear materials around the UK and the world. Its police medics and community engagement efforts help to save the lives of locals every year. Thank you to Superintendent, Tim Needham for a fascinated virtual guide to our Civil Nuclear Constabulary and a big thank you to all the CNC officers, who operate on the frontline to keep us safe.\n\nThanksgiving Mass, St Mary's of Furness RC Church\n\n21 March 2021\n\nIt was very special to attend a Thanksgiving Mass in my home parish of St Mary’s of Furness RC Church in Ulverston today, to celebrate my shrieval year. Thank you to my chaplain, Canon Paul Embery and to my fellow parishioners for their support and prayers.\n\nCumbria Criminal Court Swearing In Ceremony\n\n19 March 2021\n\nIt was a privilege to observe the swearing in of new magistrates this morning. Congratulations to all those who have joined the Office of Justice of the Peace. They have generously volunteered for this ancient office that plays an important role in today’s Justice System. Thank you.\n\nHigh Sheriffs historically enforced law and order in their counties. If you look closely, at the centre of the High Sheriff’s Badge of Office are crossed swords; one is sharp for justice and one is blunt for mercy. I wish all our new JPs good judgment and wisdom in their new roles.\n\nEgremont – Kind-hearted and close to the stunning Lakeland Fells and Coastland\n\n17 March 2021\n\nAs well as Egremont’s beautiful location, the town is so fortunate with its fantastic community volunteers and generous community-spirited businesses. I enjoyed meeting with Sam, Michael and Neil yesterday from Egremont Town Council and hearing about places to visit as well as the hopes for the future for Egremont. The town has exciting ideas and is putting together a town team to draw up plans together to maximise potential for residents and visitors. I look forward to visiting.\n\nZoom Meeting with Cumbria Chief Constable, Michelle Skeer\n\n16 March 2021\n\nIt was a pleasure to catch up with Michelle Skeer, to hear about the increase in community policing in Cumbria and gain an understanding of the role Child Centred Hubs play in prevention intervention.\n\nThe last 15 months have been a time of unprecedented change and challenge, but some positives to come out of this time are an increase in collaboration across strategic organisations in Cumbria and through more online meetings, a greater reach across communities. Many more people are now engaging in online support forums and meetings.\n\nMichelle is proud of both the agility in working that her constabulary has achieved, and the level of support given to home workers, which is embedded in Cumbria Police’s culture and processes. The importance of staying in touch to support wellbeing is so important.\n\nOur Chief Constable is a Cumbrian who is proud of her home county. Cumbria has weathered many challenges from Foot and Mouth to floods and Michelle has been impressed by how quickly communities across Cumbria adapted to the current pandemic and supported others.\n\nCumbria Police is hopeful that later this spring, we will be moving forward from acute response to recovery. Our constabulary is looking forward to working with many organisations across the county to continue to protect and help Cumbria to recover and thrive.\n\nTea and Biscuits in Kirkby Stephen and Brough\n\n12 March 2021\n\nI enjoyed meeting today with people from Kirkby Stephen and Brough for a chat over tea and biscuits (via Zoom.) Their beautiful area is full of generous volunteers who find lots of creative ways to support others. They are also looking to work collaboratively to develop more exciting community spaces and projects for the future.\n\nWigton and its Wonderful Community Spirit!\n\n9 March 2021\n\nI enjoyed chatting with Wigton Mayor, John Crouch and finding out more about this welcoming community, with its Wigton Covid-19 Mutual Aid, its Free4All Community Recycling Group, its Early Intervention Programme, its Fair Share, and the Nelson Tomlinson School. Asking John what makes Wigton special, he answered, “the community spirit, with people working together, the friendliness and that there are so many talented local people.”\n\nInternational Women's Day - Women in Justice, Women's Injustice\n\n8 March 2021\n\nI have just spent an uplifting afternoon, listening to a range of inspiring speakers including CC Michelle Skeer from Cumbria Police, Sarah Ward and Rachel Reed from HM Prison and Probation Service, Rachel from Women Out West, Rachael from Women’s Community Matters and Vanessa from Gateway 4 Women. It was a privilege to speak alongside such awesome women. It was so good to see women celebrated and to witness the care and concern shown for others. Going forward, the group shared a commitment across the justice system in Cumbria to drive improvement and to continue to develop a more equal future for all.\n\nCumbria Fire and Rescue Service\n\n5 March 2021\n\nCumbria Fire and Rescue Service is serving our communities in so many vital ways.\n\nMeeting virtually with Cumbria’s Chief Fire Officer, John Beard and hearing his vision for the service was inspiring. Not only has our Fire and Rescue Service already trained ten firefighters in administering Covid-19 vaccinations, but it has also helped schools with lateral flow test training, and collected, arranged the refurbishment, and delivered a large number of laptops to young people to support their learning, as well as delivering hundreds of food parcels across Cumbria during the pandemic.\n\nHMP Haverigg – Keeping Spirits Up during the Pandemic.\n\n5 March 2021\n\nHMP Haverigg is Cumbria’s only prison and changed to Category D ‘Open’ status in December 2019.\n\nDid you know that HMP Haverigg was the first prison in the world to introduce a park run for staff and residents? Did you know that HMP Haverigg has a Cancer Research shop for residents, which will reopen when restrictions permit? These are some of the insights I gained during discussions with Head of OMU, Governor Karl Moir, in the first of a series of virtual meetings with prison staff. It is certainly helping me to better understand and appreciate their strategies and frontline work during the pandemic.\n\nHMP Haverigg is a large site, where some of the land has been turned into a nature reserve, vegetable allotments, farm, and a memorial to former prison officers. In normal times, groups of residents work in the community with litter picks, path restoration, cutting grass in churchyards and gardening at a local hospice, but this is on pause currently. Governor Moir said that the struggles caused by the Covid-19 restrictions had enhanced the culture between staff and residents. He was impressed by the mutual empathy shown for the challenges each faced, which has helped keep spirits up. He felt residents had been appreciative of the support prison staff have provided throughout the pandemic.\n\nPrison officers work towards enabling residents to be recommended for temporary release, and towards successfully integrating people back into the community. Their work makes a positive difference to individuals, their families, and the public. They work closely with Cumbria Police and the Probation Service to protect and support our communities. Thank you to all the staff at HMP Haverigg for their frontline work.\n\nMagistrates are Key Workers and Vital Volunteers\n\n4 March 2021\n\nIn Cumbria, our courts have never closed. There are 79 Magistrates on the North and West Cumbria Bench. They have kept serving the community throughout the pandemic and are pleased to welcome 15 new magistrates this month to serve in our county.\n\nI was delighted to meet with Chris Drouet, JP who is Chair of the North and West Cumbria Bench today and gain a greater insight into how magistrates make a difference in our communities. Chris also acknowledged the excellent work carried out by HMCTS court staff in Cumbria throughout the Covid-19 Crisis. Thank you to all these unsung heroes. If you are interested in becoming a magistrate, please visit https://magistrates.judiciary.uk/\n\nMeeting with the Buddhist Community in Cumbria\n\n26 February 2021\n\nI had the privilege of meeting virtually with Venerable Pidiville Piyatissa who is head of the Ketumati Buddhist monastery in Manchester and has been teaching and supporting the Buddhist Group of Kendal (Theravada) and the Keswick Buddhist Group for over twenty years. During our meeting, Venerable Pidiville Piyatissa shared much about the precepts and teachings of the Buddha. Also attending the meeting were Venerable Galpottayaye Pemananda from Ketumati and Jacquetta Gomes from BGKT.\n\nDid you know that Cumbria is likely to be the only county in England where Buddhism is the second largest religion?\n\nAs High Sheriff my role includes lending support to all recognised church and faith groups. Increasing my own appreciation of how much church and faith groups contribute to our communities has been one of the highlights of my year in Office to date.\n\nSaving Lives with the Gift of Time\n\n24 February 2021\n\nMeeting virtually with North West air Ambulance showed me how they bring the hospital to the patient whether that is at a roadside or on a fellside. They fly at 140mph to save lives. Lead paramedic, Andy Duncan named his favourite piece of kit as a portable ultrasound machine, which is used to penetrate trauma, aid diagnostics, and help treatment. North West Air Ambulance believes that their biggest impact is in rural areas such as Cumbria, which are further away from major trauma centres. NWAA is not part of the NHS and relies on fundraising. Each mission costs £3,000 on average. To find out more visit their website at https://www.nwaa.net/\n\nRookhow\n\n24 February 2021\n\nLovely Rookhow is now welcoming subsidised bookings for groups working with people with mental health issues. Rookhow is an idyllic, peaceful place set in a picturesque rural location near Colton. In the past I have enjoyed walks and concerts there. Today, I met virtually with Sue Nicholls, Rookhow’s Development Manager who is brimming with enthusiasm and ideas to make the place accessible. Rookhow has a bunkhouse, Meeting House and woodland. There’s even a yurt, being renovated thanks to Cumbria Community Foundation\n\nThey host All Age Zoom Socials and a Zoom Cafe and are supported by Colton Parish Council and the Quaker Mental Health Fund UK. To find out more about this hidden gem, visit www.rookhow.org.uk\n\nCongratulations to Lauren Boow!\n\n23 February 2021\n\nI was delighted to join Cumbria Girlguiding Awards to present the High Sheriff Girlguiding Cumbria South Shield Award to this year’s worthy recipient, Lauren Boow. Lauren has been outstanding in her creative hard work with Crosscrake Rainbows, Brownies and Guides. Her engaging zoom meetings are a real highlight. She has also planned and delivered large events at county level and taken on the shared role of Division Commissioner for Kent Lune Division.\n\nCongratulations to Girlguiding across Cumbria. They have adapted so successfully and still run so many great events for hundreds of members and their families during the past year. Their Virtual Guide Camp was one of my favourite events of 2020.\n\nA Wonderful Community Welcome from Dalston\n\n23 February 2021\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed meeting with Dalston Parish Council today. I was treated to a virtual tour of beautiful Dalston with its square, river walks, community gardens, wildflower meadow, Rose Castle and Forge Green. What shone through was the whole council’s pride and affection for their parish. I was really interested in the way the community has developed the Dalston Neighbourhood Development Plan. This is a parish that is planning for its future with its electric charge points for cars, play areas and conservation plans.\n\nMost of all, I was impressed by the neighbourliness and support for others shown during the pandemic. It was so heartening to hear of the many ways in which volunteers in the Dalston community have helped others.\n\nCumbria Neighbourhood Watch High Sheriff Shield awarded for Outstanding Neighbourliness and Selfless Acts of Support\n\n22 February 2021\n\nToday I was very pleased to attend Cumbria Resilience Forum. At the meeting I had the privilege of presenting the High Sheriff of Cumbria Neighbourhood Watch Association Shield to Community Resilience Coordinator, Carolyn Otley on behalf of all the volunteers and NHS, care sector and frontline workers.\n\nI am very pleased to announce that this High Sheriff Shield is awarded in 2021 to celebrate the neighbourliness generously shown by so many people across Cumbria towards others, often complete strangers, during the pandemic. It also commemorates the selfless efforts of NHS, care sector and other frontline workers. Congratulations and a huge thank you to everyone who is working to support others, especially the vulnerable.\n\nWorkington - Ancient Market Town and Fascinating Industrial Heritage\n\n18 February 2021\n\nToday, I enjoyed meeting virtually with the Mayor of Workington, Janet King. We discussed the important support West Cumbria Carers provide to young carers and the incredible Hospice at Home, West Cumbria.\n\nThank you to both for the vital way they help others in our community. As Janet said, what makes Workington a great community is the people.\n\nMeeting virtually with Allerdale Mayor, Cllr Hilary Harrington\n\n17 February 2021\n\nI enjoyed a very positive meeting today. What shone through was as Hilary put it, ‘the great people of Allerdale, their resilience, resourcefulness and sense of humour.’ It’s what makes Allerdale such a special place. It was so good to hear about the work of the Mayor’s chosen charities; Allerdale Disability Association and We Will, Ewanrigg.\n\nWestmorland County Show and Agricultural Society\n\n13 February 2021\n\nIt was very heartening to attend Westmorland County Agricultural Society’s AGM via Zoom this morning and see their fantastic ‘can do’ attitude, flexibility and positivity in action. Congratulations to all on what they have still managed to achieve over the past, difficult year. I wish them all the very best for the year ahead.\n\nCelebrating Windermere and Bowness\n\n5 February 2021\n\nIt was wonderful to meet virtually with town mayor, John Saunders today and hear about fabulous community groups and businesses and the amazing acts of kindness, neighbourliness, adaptability and resilience going on in Bowness and Windermere.\n\nThis small community rose to the challenge of a first lockdown followed by a period of unprecedented visitor numbers and two subsequent lockdowns. They have come together to support the socially isolated and those shielding with shopping, prescriptions and food parcels. They have generously volunteered to support the vaccination programme.\n\nJohn and I discussed the wonderful local attractions and businesses who are ready to give a warm welcome to visitors after lockdown and when restrictions permit.\n\nCarlisle Key\n\n3 February 2021\n\nI would like to highlight the work of Carlisle Key who work with young people 16-25 in Carlisle, who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. No referral is needed. Anyone who is experiencing problems related to housing and is 16-25 can access their drop-in service by calling in or phoning 01228 595566.\n\nMeeting with their CEO, Clare over Zoom this morning, I was very impressed by how Carlisle Key empowers young people by giving them knowledge, support, counselling, skills and confidence to help them move towards independent living. I was also very impressed at how they have adapted to the challenges of Covid-19 to keep on supporting young people throughout the pandemic. Their mix of good quality housing and one to one support is helping to alleviate hardship for around 300 young people in our community.\n\nhttps://www.carlislekey.co.uk/\n\nCumbria Neighbourhood Watch Association\n\n1 February 2021\n\nI enjoyed talking to Joe Murray, Chair of Cumbria Neighbourhood Watch Association to better understand how the association supports our communities, especially the socially isolated. It was good to find out about their use of Alert System to ensure the vulnerable are supported and about how they keep others informed of potential scams and risks. CNWA has also been working with Cumbria Constabulary’s neighbourhood policing teams, as well as Victim Support, Crimestoppers and Ring.com to provide victims of crime and domestic abuse with video doorbells for reassurance and an element of safety. For more information, visit their website here.\n\nMeals on Wheels, Cumbria\n\n29 January 2021\n\nIt was heartening to meet virtually with Trish from Meals on Wheels, Cumbria, and find out more about how they are regularly delivering meals to over a hundred people. They are happy to welcome more customers who struggle to cook for themselves. They provide nutritious meals five days a week to people’s homes in Carlisle, Brampton, Longtown, High Hesket, Wigton, Thursby and everywhere in between. They can be contacted directly here.\n\nTheir wonderful volunteers operate 8 regular rounds of deliveries. Trish says they are also looking for generous businesses or individuals who would be willing to sponsor the travel costs of each round of deliveries. Anyone able to help, please contact Meals on Wheels, Cumbria. Thank you to all involved in making a fantastic difference to the lives of those who are often most isolated in our communities.\n\nThe Great Border City of Carlisle\n\n29 January 2021\n\nToday, I should have been enjoying a walking tour of Cumbria’s only city, Carlisle, with the Mayor, Marilyn Bowman. Fortunately, we were still able to meet virtually and discuss the amazing communities and innovative businesses of Carlisle. As Marilyn says, “it is the people of Carlisle that make it the wonderful place it is.”\n\nCarlisle is over 2,000 years old and has a fascinating history, and in non-lockdown times has some great places to visit, like Carlisle Cathedral, Carlisle Castle and Tullie House\n\nHigh Sheriff Association Webinar\n\n27 January 2021\n\nI was delighted to be a panellist at the High Sheriff Association Webinar for those in nomination for 2021. It was a pleasure to be able to share about my year in Office to date and emphasise how there are still so many opportunities, even during a pandemic, to lend support, get to know your county better, and enjoy the privilege that is being a High Sheriff.\n\nDianne Oxberry Trust\n\n15 January 2021\n\nI had a fascinating meeting online this weekend with the Dianne Oxberry Trust. They raise awareness and hope in tackling ovarian cancer. Early diagnosis is so important, and I recommend following and sharing their Facebook page to ensure as many women as possible know the symptoms to look out for. Ovarian cancer is not picked up by a smear test so recognising symptoms early on and seeing a GP can help saves lives. The Dianne Oxberry Trust is a small charity operating across the North West to support women in Dianne’s memory.\n\nNational Probation Service in Cumbria\n\n15 January 2021\n\nI just had an enjoyable ‘virtual’ meeting today with Emily and Lisa from the National Probation Service in Cumbria. As we all know the world has changed in the last year, but our probation frontline workers have kept going throughout to keep us safe. Their work often goes unseen by the public, but I was hugely impressed by their dedication, adaptability and commitment as well as their collaborative work with other agencies and third sector groups in the criminal justice system. They safeguard and support our communities.\n\nSilverdale and District Woodbank\n\n8 January 2021\n\nIt was a pleasure to talk with Lesley from Silverdale and District Woodbank today and learn more about how this volunteer community group are dedicated to helping look after lots of different local woodlands.\n\nHigh Sheriff of Cumbria Covid-19 Business Innovation and Community Awards\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nThe High Sheriff of Cumbria, Julie Barton, is launching the High Sheriff of Cumbria Covid-19 Business Innovation and Community Awards to recognise the incredible ways businesses across Cumbria have confronted the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic since March 2020. The communities of Cumbria rely on their businesses and these awards aim to thank, acknowledge, and celebrate those business teams who have demonstrated great resilience.\n\nThe benefits of the awards can be to raise a business’s profile, to receive recognition from the ancient Office of High Sheriff and to thank and acknowledge the efforts of a great business team. The High Sheriff plans to work with local and social media to celebrate Cumbria’s businesses. Find out more here.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral\n\n24 December 2020\n\nI was delighted to attend the Festival of Carols and Readings at Carlisle Cathedral today. What a fantastic start to Christmas!\n\nBarrow Magistrates Court\n\n22 December 2020\n\nIt was a privilege to visit Barrow Magistrates Court. Magistrates are volunteers who play a vital role in our justice system and support our community. They come from all walks of life and need no legal background. They decide cases in family and criminal courts. Thank you to this very special group of volunteers. To find out more visit the website.\n\nHigh Sheriffs Go21 Challenge for North West Air Ambulance\n\n19 & 20 December 2020\n\nI have just completed the High Sheriffs Go21 Challenge in all weathers for North West Air Ambulance. They save lives 365 days a year in all weathers and have been called to over 22,000 missions since 1999. I’ve walked a long way (22.5 miles) from Coniston to Furness General Hospital in Barrow around the time of the shortest day to highlight how our Air Ambulance gives advanced medical care and relies on donations. Best parts of the walk were the beautiful landscape, the sandwiches (obviously) and the company. Thanks Peter and John! The worst part was the weather, especially the large hailstones at Lowick.\n\nI am part of a Posse of High Sheriffs across the North West each walking to raise awareness and funds. Good luck to the High Sheriff of Merseyside, His Honour John Roberts, and to the High Sheriff of Lancashire, Catherine Penny, who are both undertaking their respective Go21 Challenge Walks.\n\nUpdate – Thank you to everyone who supported the fundraising – around £13,000 has been raised – a terrific effort!\n\nBarrow’s Financial Wellbeing Virtual Summit\n\n16 December 2020\n\nToday, I was so pleased to open Barrow’s Financial Wellbeing Virtual Summit. It was a great collaborative and open forum, involving law enforcement agencies, emergency services, local authorities and the third sector working effectively together and sharing information about all the services available with those who need to access them. The pandemic has changed lives and been very challenging, especially for the financially vulnerable. Innovative and proactive ideas flowed during the summit with the aim of ensuring no one falls through the gap and that information, money advice, courses and help reach those who will most benefit from them. As communities we are stronger together. Thank you to everyone involved for a great collaborative forum.\n\nWomen's Community Matters, Barrow\n\n15 December 2020\n\nI’m definitely feeling festive after spending the morning delivering Christmas parcels with Women’s Community Matters in Barrow. They are helping to ensure lots of people have a better Christmas, thanks to generous donations from local people. They are a one-stop shop giving all sorts of support to all women of any age so they can move forward with their hopes and dreams. Thank you to their team for the fantastic difference they make to the lives of others and the kindnesses they share.\n\nCarlisle Combined Court\n\n14 December 2020\n\nIt was a privilege to spend the day at Carlisle Combined Court with HHJ Barker. Historically, the role of High Sheriff held law enforcement powers and judged cases in court. Today, the role is about lending active support to the principal organs of the Constitution within Cumbria which of course includes the judiciary. Spending time gaining a better understanding of our justice system has increased my admiration for the vital and difficult role the judiciary plays within our communities.\n\nTo find out more about our justice system and how our country’s constitution is unwritten but found in the statutes passed by Parliament and in the common law, click here.\n\nThe Well Community, Barrow\n\n11 December 2020\n\nSome days as High Sheriff are amazing. Visiting The Well Community in Barrow was one such day. Together, The Well Community support people recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. What a vibrant and supportive group!\n\nI listened with admiration to Mark and Leon’s stories which were full of hope and resilience, as they had both come so far to get their lives back on track. It was also good to film my positive thoughts on Barrow’s exciting New Constellation – a project for the people of Barrow to co-create a great future.\n\nI can recommend The Well-Fed Community Grocers on Dalton Road. All the money made goes back into supporting The Well Communities. Thank you to all the team at The Well for the support they give to others.\n\nCharity Auction Thank You\n\n7 December 2020\n\nThank you to everyone who supported the High Sheriff of Cumbria Online Charity Auction and Prize Draw which raised a fantastic £8,310 for the High Sheriff Fund, administered by Cumbria Community Foundation to support charitable organisations across Cumbria\n\nUlverston Rotary Zoom\n\n30 November 2020\n\nIt was a pleasure to be the guest speaker via Zoom at Ulverston Rotary. I enjoyed sharing a little of the history and modern role of a High Sheriff. It was also a pleasure to join in a quiz and finding out more about their charitable projects both locally and internationally.\n\nSuicide Awareness Course\n\n17 November 2020\n\nI completed the Suicide Awareness Course online today with www.every-life-matters.org.uk. It’s effectively a first aid course to keep people safer and I now feel better informed. My theme for my year in Office as High Sheriff is ‘tackling loneliness’ – the offer of a chat not only tackles loneliness, but listening could also help someone find that glimmer of hope. Importantly, the course shows how we can all play a role in helping people whose mental health is at risk. Showing you care, offering support and a listening ear can all go a long way. Talking about suicide saves lives. Trust your gut instincts. If you are at all worried that someone is having thoughts of suicide, ASK them. And Ask directly. “Are you thinking about suicide?” It won’t put ideas in their head and being there to listen could be a lifesaver. Thank you to all at Every Life Matters.\n\nSt Mary’s RC Primary School, Ulverston\n\n13 November 2020\n\nIt was lovely to return to my old primary school and meet virtually with Class 4. The pupils asked such great questions and had prepared so well for our meeting. I thoroughly enjoyed the visit.\n\nCumbria Virtual Business Awards\n\n12 November 2020\n\nCongratulations to everyone who was nominated, shortlisted, or won at the In Cumbria Virtual Business Awards. It was wonderful to see the Cumbrian resilient spirit in action, adapting to these most challenging of times, and finding opportunities and ways to be innovative.\n\nInterfaith Week\n\n11 November 2020\n\nI had the pleasure of taking part in Interfaith Week by meeting virtually with members from South Lakeland Equality and Diversity Partnership and the South Lakeland Interfaith Forum.\n\nWhat a great group of people working together to promote tolerance, understanding and awareness between people of religious and non-religious beliefs. It was a real celebration and a welcoming space to listen, share ideas, and help each other as one community.\n\nAs High Sheriff, my role includes lending support to church and faith groups though I feel at this meeting I was the beneficiary, as I developed a better understanding from those I met. Thank you especially to Michael, Jacquetta, Karen and Saimma.\n\nRemembrance Day\n\n11 November 2020\n\nIt was an honour and a privilege to privately lay a wreath in Ulverston today to acknowledge and thank so many for their service and sacrifice. We will remember them.\n\nCumbria Young Farmers AGM – Virtual\n\n6 November 2020\n\nCongratulations to Cartmel YFC for winning the High Sheriff Award this year for the best community project. Young Farmers play a generous and active role in our communities across the county, thank you. It was a pleasure to join the AGM, even if it was only by video.\n\nHealth Watch Cumbria\n\n5 November 2020\n\nIt was fascinating today to meet virtually with members of the public and health professionals who together shared ideas and concerns to improve support for all, especially during the second lockdown. Feedback was welcomed.\n\nHealthwatch Cumbria is there to help people in Cumbria get the best out of local health and social care services by talking and listening to people in every part of Cumbria and then telling local services about people’s experiences.\n\nMaryport – A Great Community in a Stunning Location\n\n28 October 2020\n\nIt was a privilege to visit Maryport with Mayor, Peter Kendall.\n\nI enjoyed learning about The Settlement at Castle Hill which is run by volunteers for the benefit of the local community. So many of their groups and activities work to tackle social isolation, but they need more volunteers please. I did not meet any of the groups, but I was delighted to visit their outside accessible gardening project.\n\nI was so impressed to hear about the commitment and achievements of Maryport Sea Cadets. Despite the current pandemic, they have supported young people to achieve 127 hours of sailing time this summer. In fact, Maryport Solway Sea Cadet Unit gives over two thousand hours in volunteer time each year to work with young people. Congratulations and thank you to all involved. Pictured are some of the cadets’ boats.\n\nAnother great group of dedicated volunteers is Maryport Inshore Rescue.

It’s a real parish community effort.\n\nThe English can now re-enact with their Scottish neighbours the sailing across and stealing of church bells which originally took place in 1626. I’m hoping as High Sheriff that nowadays, this will be without taking any bells!\n\nCaldbeck - Visit to Northern Fells Group\n\n29 September 2020\n\nI very much enjoyed meeting the hard working team from Northern Fells Group, a community owned, volunteer led charity which supports those who are socially isolated or in need of a little help in one of Cumbria’s most isolated areas.

Janice is grateful for the support the project has received from Cumbria Community Foundation\n\nThe foundation of a baby’s social and emotional wellbeing begins during pregnancy and continues throughout the first 1001 days of life. It is the special parent-infant relationship that is crucial to a baby’s developing mind. This special bond helps generate the necessary brain development needed to become social and emotionally resilient throughout life. Sometimes a parent’s life experiences create a psychological barrier making it less easy to connect emotionally with their baby. Good Enough Start’s core purpose is to support parents who experience difficulty creating a secure parent infant relationship.

Good luck to everyone involved.\n\nYou can follow their adventure here and read stories of how the fund is supporting communities in Cumbria.\n\nIf you can, please support them here.\n\nThe Moon at The Coro, Ulverston\n\n31 July 2020\n\nFantastic visit to the moon last night. What can I say? It’s out of this world!\n\nThis awe-inspiring installation is an exact replica of the Moon we see in the sky at night and has been seen by over 3 Million people world-wide. Measuring seven metres in diameter, the inflated Moon features 120dpi detailed NASA imagery of the lunar surface.\n\nDo book a visit this August to The Coro in Ulverston and explore the far side of the moon. Book here.\n\nAge UK Barrow and District\n\n28 July 2020\n\nIt was a pleasure to visit Age UK Barrow & District this week to find out more about the excellent support they provide in the local community. I was particularly pleased to meet and thank Vickie Martin together with some very special volunteers, Lorna Simpson, Barbara Wild, Stuart Walker, Naomi Doherty, Neil Ward and Sandra King. It was great to put faces to the names of those whose acts of kindness have been brought to my attention. The organisation, Age UK Barrow and District also received a certificate as their volunteers have assisted the vulnerable via a helpline and befriending service, as well as coordinating volunteers to ensure shopping, hot food deliveries, hearing aid battery collections, prescription collections and reassurance have been provided to those who are vulnerable. Thank you to Marie Connor for arranging the visit.\n\nEden Rivers Trust\n\n27 July 2020\n\nThank you to Eden Rivers Trust for some fascinating site visits to Bessygill site, Lowther Estate and Greystone and Little Beck on the Lyvennet, to understand their work on natural flood defences and creating habitats for wildlife.\n\nEden Rivers Trust works on river restoration, natural flood management, water friendly farming and engagement activities. Some of its more community-based projects are supported by Cumbria Community Foundation. To find out more and for volunteering opportunities click here.\n\nI enjoyed meeting Elizabeth Radford of Eden Rivers Trust and David Bliss (Lowther Estate Manager) at the Bessygill site on the Lowther Estate, which is a tributary of the River Leith. We saw a fascinating stage zero restoration (where a modified channel is blocked and the river is left to find its own way in the line of the historic channel) and a pond which is for off line storage. It fills in flood conditions and temporarily slows the flow, so reducing peak flow on the River Leith in heavy rain. We also saw the habitat for wildlife on the wetland created by stage zero and the pond. The wetland also cleans and filters the water. Lowther Estate is planting a thousand acres of trees and reducing stock.\n\nAt Greystone and Little Beck on the Lyvennet ( which joins the Eden at Temple Sowerby), Elizabeth and I met Chris Addison who farms the land there and visited three rapids built in the river to create new habitats, rapids and pools. These raise water levels so in heavy rain the three ponds or ‘scrapes’ either side of the river fill with water and hold it back to slow peak flow. It amazing how something so natural can ensure water empties more slowly and help protect communities further downstream from flooding. I really liked the pond on the left bank which had vegetated up well and had an amazing ‘crop’ of butterflies!\n\nThe Fratry, Carlisle\n\n21 July 2020\n\nI was delighted to attend coffee at the Fratry at Carlisle Cathedral. The restoration work is outstanding and has created a world class space. The new cafe is so light and attractive and after all, Carlisle Cathedral is just stunning with so much history. If you have not seen it yet, do make a visit!\n\nIan Gaynor and St John’s Ambulance\n\n17 July 2020\n\nSupporting the NHS – Thank you to Blood Bikes Cumbria and Ian Gaynor from St John Ambulance.\n\nI’m so pleased to acknowledge all the volunteer support given to the NHS by the people of Cumbria during the pandemic. Some recipients of the High Sheriff Special Recognition Certificates have made huge amounts of PPE whilst others such as Blood Bikes Cumbria and Ian Gaynor and his fellow volunteers at St John Ambulance have helped the NHS directly and protected lives across the region. A huge thank you to all of them.\n\nHeron Corn Mill\n\n16 July 2020\n\nI was delighted to meet the team at Heron Corn Mill on Thursday and help deliver Powsowdie boxes to older people in the community. The Powsowdie Project is a fantastic example of adapting and thriving under lockdown. Normally, this older group would meet at the Heron Corn Mill and share a meal, music, themed activities and reminiscences. Instead, with support from Cumbria Community Foundation and the Papagallino Fund, they have creatively combined all these aspects into a box containing delicious fresh food, a CD of music and poems, activities, a newsletter, interesting resources for reminiscence, and even a stamp and paper to share their stories. Members told me time and again how much they looked forward to receiving their boxes and how much fun the contents were. This project certainly raises spirits, especially for those with memory issues or who are digitally isolated.\n\nPowsowdie is just one of many community groups that are part of Heron Corn Mill. I recommend everyone to visit this Living Heritage site when it reopens. Thank you to Creative Project Manager, Audrey Steeley and her team of volunteers.\n\nThe Beggar's Theatre and Moore Arts Millom\n\n2 July 2020\n\nI very much enjoyed meeting virtually with Jakki Moore to understand about all the ways young people in Millom engage in drama and theatre. I was impressed by the way they tackle difficult subjects through drama, such as bullying and isolation. Drama can so help build confidence, help people make friends and develop so many transferable skills. Good luck to Jakki as she plans and prepares for reopening. She certainly has a lot of exciting and creative ideas. Visit the Beggar’s Theatre Facebook page here.\n\nLove Barrow Families\n\n30 June 2020\n\nI was so impressed by the charity Love Barrow Families when I met virtually with Alison Tooby this week. They bring support under one roof, with adult and children’s health and social care services working together to meet the complex needs of some families in Barrow. The kindness, pragmatic support, and active citizenship they promote is very impressive. Thank you for all they do in the community. Do visit their website to see the inspiring difference they make.\n\nGood News – Special Recognition Award Update\n\n30 June 2020\n\nTuesday 30th June marks the hundredth day since the UK went into lockdown. The good news is that many volunteers, voluntary groups, and individuals in Cumbria have given such outstanding support to others during the Covid-19 Crisis.\n\nIt has been a privilege to be able to acknowledge and honour those who have done so much to help others. View the growing list of certificate holders here and see just how they’ve been helping the community. Thank you to everyone. We can all be so proud of our community spirit in Cumbria.\n\nRotary Club of Bassenthwaite - 30 Years' Charter\n\n29 June 2020\n\nI had an enjoyable ‘virtual’ evening at the Bassenthwaite Rotary Club’s Charter Celebrations on Zoom. President Albert Johnson was joined by 55 members from across Cumbria, Lancashire and over the border in Scotland. It was good to hear of their activities to support communities both locally and internationally. They are great community volunteers.\n\nUlverston Self Isolation Group\n\n25 June 2020\n\nWhat could be nicer than enjoying the Cumbrian sunshine with volunteers from Ulverston Self Isolation Group and giving out sweet boxes to some of the amazing children in the town? Hearing different children’s stories of resilience and acts of kindness under lockdown was very inspiring. I hope they enjoyed the sweet boxes. Thanks to the group for their kindness.\n\nKirksanton Village Hall & Millom Network Centre\n\n23 June 2020\n\nKirksanton Village Hall\n\nYesterday I ‘zoomed’ across to Kirksanton and met with their village hall committee members, Helen, Vicky, and Anne. Together with their other committee members, they have worked tenaciously to raise funds to renovate their village hall. They have received a number of vital grants including one from Cumbria Community Foundation and successfully completed the building upgrade last year. It is a fantastic community facility.\n\nMillom Network Centre\n\nI so enjoyed a virtual tour of Millom Network Centre and meeting virtually with so many volunteers including Mayor Angela Dixon, Paul Stewart, Tony, Richard, and Terry. The Food Pantry based at MNC is providing great support to the local community during the pandemic. The facilities at the centre also support those trying to get back into the workplace, businesses, and community groups.\n\nMillom Recreation Centre\n\n22 June 2020\n\nThis morning it was a pleasure to meet virtually with Marion Giles from Millom Recreation Centre. I was so impressed with her enthusiasm and long service. Under normal circumstances, the Millom Recreation Centre committee ensures that so many different groups are able to use the centre from gymnastics and youth clubs to carpet bowls, tumbletots, gym membership and badminton. The committee members are currently busy getting the centre ready with social distancing measures in place, so that when they can reopen, they will be able to welcome people back to the centre safely. I wish them all the best in their preparations.\n\nKillington Sailing Association\n\n19 June 2020\n\nIt was lovely to visit stunning Killington Reservoir today and meet Geoff from Killington Sailing Association. KSA plays an important role in our community, enabling 4000 people to access the sailing and lake facilities. They encourage and support groups, including those working with disabled and disadvantaged young people, to have access to water and sports facilities.\n\nBorder TV\n\n18 June 2020\n\nITV Border featured the High Sheriff of Cumbria Special Recognition Award on 19th June 2020. It was interesting being interviewed at home in the garden by Matthew Taylor. Fortunately, the rain held off …just!\n\nCockermouth Linking Lives\n\n11 June 2020\n\nThis morning, it was so interesting to discuss with Terry from Linking Lives Cockermouth about their volunteer telephone befriending service, Two’s Company that currently supports 43 people. In the wake of Covid, the group’s home visiting service has been stopped temporarily, but their 28 volunteers are still busy supporting those who are lonely and isolated by regular phone calls. Your support makes such a difference, thank you. Volunteers need to have good listening skills, but it sounds really interesting and rewarding work. If other parts of Cumbria are interested in setting up similar support services do get in contact with Terry or visit the Linking Lives website.\n\nFind out more using the links below.\n\nLinking Lives Facebook here.\n\nCockermouth Cumbria Facebook here.\n\nCumbria Churches Together Facebook here.\n\nNews and Star Facebook here.\n\nSpring Mount Walney and Walney Community Trust\n\n10 June 2020\n\nToday I joined Ros Harrison from Spring Mount Walney via Skype and so appreciated hearing about all the amazing ways that Walney Community Trust and its team of volunteers have tackled the challenges of lockdown. Six days a week their team is helping in their community from providing food supplies, shopping and collecting prescriptions to helping house those released from prison and supporting families in crisis. Spring Mount have helped 1325 households to date. They have also collaborated so well with other organisations across Barrow. It’s one of the things I love about Barrow – great cooperation and community spirit. Thank you to everyone for all you do.\n\nVisit to Grange Community Food Store\n\n6 June 2020\n\nWhat a wonderful time I had visiting Rahina Borthwick and the team. Not only did I get to put on an apron, lend a hand and see how FareShare ensures food that would have gone to landfill is instead shared amongst those in the community who will benefit most, but I also got to meet and chat with lots of residents. As volunteer, Natalie Beadle said, ” this little ex-bank does so much more than redirecting bags of rescued food- it’s touching to see it forming a pillar in a fair few calendars.” Thank you for the support you give. See the latest updates from the Food Store here.\n\nCongratulations to Carlisle Street Pastors\n\n5 June 2020\n\nCongratulations to Carlisle Street Pastors on their 10 year anniversary of giving support, through patrolling our great border city of Carlisle late at night each weekend and keeping people safe. The kindness, care and help you have given over such a long period is commendable. I’m so sorry your tenth anniversary dinner celebrations this weekend could not go ahead as planned due to the current restrictions, but I wanted to nevertheless mark your achievements and say thank you. I’ve therefore baked some celebration cakes to remember your ten years of service. Congratulations and thank you! Find out more about Carlisle Street Pastors here.\n\n1st June 2020\n\nI am delighted to launch The High Sheriff of Cumbria Special Recognition Award.\n\nThere are so many amazing stories of acts of kindness and selflessness made by local people who are supporting their fellow Cumbrians during the Covid-19 Crisis and I want to honour those who are making an outstanding contribution in our community. This new award is being launched at the start of Volunteers’ Week UK to honour volunteers and individuals across Cumbria going above and beyond in their work, who give outstanding support to others during the current pandemic.

It was great to hear how Arnside Sailing Club is a thriving community club which promotes sailing through training schemes available to everyone. Grants from Cumbria Community Foundation have helped it purchase a catamaran suitable for older teenagers enabling them to continue sailing with the club as they grow older and progress their skills. I was also interested to hear of their new plans to offer paddle boarding to local children; a sport that can be taught and enjoyed whilst maintaining social distancing. Considering the strong winds today, for once I was happy to meet virtually and appreciate from a distance all the good work their volunteers do. I plan to rearrange my postponed visit in the future.\n\nHeron Corn Mill\n\n19 May 2020\n\nI should have been visiting Heron Corn Mill, but instead I had a really interesting phone call with Audrey from their organisation. They are finding lots of ways to support their local community remotely with their Make Yourself at Home newsletter initiative, Powsowdie Special Boxes for elderly, vulnerable people, volunteering and Zoom meetings for their 808 group. I hope to have a Mill and Hydropower Tour later in the year but in the meantime thank you for sharing your positive story and good luck with all your fantastic work.

Getting flowers in lockdown was not possible, but the local garden centre helped out by making me a planter, however I still couldn’t get any Union flags. Croftlands Junior School came to my rescue and made me some flags. They look fantastic and add to the VE Day Celebrations.\n\nIt made me feel that the spirit of wartime of helping one another, creative problem solving and tenacity, lives on in lockdown. Thank you to all the pupils who helped.\n\nRead more from the local press here.\n\nView VE Day Facebook video here.\n\nForge donates Oxygen Concentrators to St Mary’s Hospice\n\n4 May 2020\n\nCumbrian businesses are really stepping up and supporting Cumbrian charities during lockdown despite it being an incredibly difficult time for everyone.

I am delighted to say that I did however have a virtual meeting with over twenty Barrow charities entitled ‘Love Barrow.’ I have already got to know so much about these organisations from being part of the Barrow Community Resilience Group and seeing their care and concern in action.

(1:02:48)\n\nInstallation of High Sheriff of Cumbria\n\nMarch 2020\n\nMy installation was originally planned to be in the magnificent Barrow-in-Furness Town Hall. Sadly we realised it was necessary to cancel this due to the Covid-19 crisis. Instead, I held a tiny but unique event outside on the patio of my garden at Rosside, Ulverston. The Lord-Lieutenant, the Undersheriff, my son Joseph and a few other guests all attended virtually via Skype. All Skype guests were dressed in suits and Claire Hensman (Lord-Lieutenant) wore a lovely hat. I could see them all on the screen as I made my declaration. Marcia Reid Fotheringham (outgoing High Sheriff), Canon Paul Embery (Chaplain) and Les Johnson (Justice of the Peace) were present, though at social distancing lengths of course. Fr Paul brought the church lectern to add to the formality (well, he did ask if he could bring anything) and we took some photos.\n\nIt was not the big installation I had planned originally but it went well, nonetheless. Peter, my husband read a paper on behalf of Claire Hensman, Lord-Lieutenant. Our younger son, John stood in and read the script in the place of the Undersheriff, Tim Cartmell under his instruction. My older son, Joseph stayed online after the ceremony to join us for a virtual fizz and canapes reception and we chinked glasses virtually and toasted the occasion. All very 21st century and special. By the day of the installation, I had changed the date to much earlier, the venue and was on version 7 of the Order of Service but I was also extremely lucky. It may well mean that I am one of the only High Sheriffs in the country to have been able to hold an installation so far this year.\n\nClick here to read more about my virtual installation ceremony.\n\nMeet Cumbria's New High Sheriff\n\nMarch 2020\n\nThe Queen has given her official approval at a Privy Council meeting at Buckingham Palace for the new High Sheriff of Cumbria to take up office.\n\nOn the 26th March 2020 Julie Barton will be appointed as High Sheriff of Cumbria for the next 12 months.\n\n“The role of High Sheriff may be a very old one, but I hope to play a modern, proactive and positive role in today’s Cumbria and to promote my county during my year.”\n\n“It is an honour and a delight to serve as High Sheriff of Cumbria.”\n\nRead the local press article here.\n\nA Tour of Carlisle and Eden with Cumbria Community Foundation\n\nIn preparing for my year in office I was delighted in February 2020, to visit some of the charities and not for profit organisations that make such a difference to many in Carlisle and Eden Districts. I am grateful to Cumbria Gateway and Gateway for Women, Rebike Cumbria, The Farmers Network and Upfront Arts Charity for taking the time to show me all that you do to help fellow Cumbrians to thrive.
