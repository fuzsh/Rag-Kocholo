        "text": "OS Grid ref:- NY2659\n\nThe north Cumbrian village of Drumburgh is situated 8 miles (13 kilometres) to the northwest of Carlisle and stands on the course of Hadrian's Wall, near to Burgh-by-Sands. The village lies in the old Barony of Burgh, dating from 1092. The barony was a bulwark against the Scots invading across the Solway.\n\nThe village's name means 'Ridge near the fort' and derives from the Brtythonic Celtic once spoken widely in the north of England combined with the Anglo-Saxon word 'Burgh'.\n\nCoggabata Roman fort was located opposite a ford over the Solway, the site has been both partially built over by modern housing. The antiquarian John Leland visited the site in 1539 and commented that stone from the wall had been taken to use for buildings in Drumburgh. Excavations carried out in the early twentieth century by Haverfield, revealed the width of the Wall foundations at Drumburgh to be 9Â½ feet wide. It also determined that Drumburgh fort was added to the Wall following its original completion.\n\nDrumburgh Moss Nature Reserve ( OS Grid reference- NY 255 586 ) which lies to the south of the village, is one of four peat bogs on the south side of the Solway estuary, which together are considered the best in England.\n\nThe reserve was purchased by the Cumbria Wildlife Trust in 1981. The moss a site of international importance, dominated by an expanse of lowland raised mire, one of Western europes's most threatened habitats. The nature reserve, is a haven for all sorts of wildlife, curlew and red grouse and redshank breed there, short-eared owls, adders and roe deer can be sighted. In winter the nature reserve often plays host to small numbers of geese from the huge flocks on the Solway. Waymarked trails provide a way to safely explore the peat bog.\n\nTowns and villages of Cumbria\n\nHistoric Buildings"
