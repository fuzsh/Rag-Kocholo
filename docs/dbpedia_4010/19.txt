During the 11th and 12th centuries, there was a tempestuous seesaw of control for Carlisle between Scotland and England. Carlisle was in the Scottish domain when the Domesday book was compiled in 1086. The area was conquered from the Scots by William I 's son William II (1057 to 1100) AKA Rufus meaning red, so it is assumed he had ginger hair. It is said he had a bellicose temperament, so these conditions suited him. After he died, his younger brother became Henry I (1068 to 1135) and in 1122 founded an Augustinian Priory here.

The information board gives the lowdown, and you can see one arch that is all that remains of the priory.

Eleven years later in 1133, the church became a cathedral. You can still see some of the handsome 12th-century stonework. It is local red and calciferous squared sandstone blocks. Much of Carlisle used this in its buildings which can still be seen today.

Henry I was exerting his authority to contain those feisty Scots only 10 miles away and forever attacking England. He died in 1135 and King David I of Scotland (1084 to 1153) took the area under his watch until Henry II (1133 to 1189) took it back in 1157. Since then, it has been in England, but was still raided by the Scots.

A Dominican and Franciscan friaries were founded near the Cathedral in 1233, so it was certainly an ecclesiastical mecca.

Some alterations to the bit in front of the altar called the choir were in progress until a catastrophic fire in the city in 1292 caused the cathedral to be partly rebuilt and refurbished.

Inside the cathedral, a detailed tracery (window with whirly stone framework) in the east end was in place around 1350. The stained glass window is complex and is a big 'un at 51 feet high and 26 feet wide. According to Wikipedia 'It has nine lights, and tracery, which, it has been calculated, was drafted from 263 points.' That is impressive, eh? There is original stained glass at the top depicting the last judgment of Jesus. The lower 9 'Lights' depict the life of Christ and date from 1861.

The reformation saw that the cathedral was surrendered to the Crown in 1540. Henry VIII (1491 to 1547) a year later Founded the Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity; this is its official title.

During Elizabeth I (1533 to 1603) and James I's (1566 to 1625) reign the Deanery was secularised, referring to transforming ecclesiastical possessions for civil purposes.

There are many pleasing aspects here and the barrel-vaulted celestial ceiling is a marvellous creation by Owen Jones (1809 to 1874). It replaced a false ceiling from 1764 and was painted blue with stars and coats-of-arms of local gentry in 1856. It is close in likeness to the medieval period ceiling. It was during this period (1853 to 1857) that a major restoration was undertaken.

There is much to admire in the Choir especially the organ with its 4000 pipes. Notice the ornate carvings and The Bishops Throne is a showstopper, and yes, it is where the Bishop sits. This one was carved out of wood by George Street in 1880.

At the back of the choir stalls are 4 painted panels dating from 1485 to 1490. They have depictions of the Twelve Apostles, the lives of St. Anthony of Egypt, the founder of monasticism, St. Augustine of Hippo, and St. Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, To help you recognise them, there are display boards.

Down below there is a treasury with some interesting artifacts. Ceiling bosses from the 14th Century got my attention and a bell.

It was amusing to find a strategically placed collection box just outside this room..

Having now done some research, I missed a few things, so on your visit see if you can spot the wonky pillars due to subsidence, and the gargoyle of George Russell who was a brave policeman. One visit is never enough.

Below is the 'Blessed Virgin and Child' by Josefina de Vasconcellos, which I didn't spot the lacework.

Thanks for reading through and getting to the end of this post. I enjoy exploring the Fabulous North (Especially as a Southerner residing up North). I like 'snippets' of information, and more so, if they are obscure, amusing or meaningful. The photographs are taken on a mobile phone, without any enhancements.
