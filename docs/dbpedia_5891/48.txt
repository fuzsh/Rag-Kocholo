Born in 1949, Antony Sher was raised in South Africa before going to London to study at the Webber-Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art between 1969 and 1971. After performing for the Gay Sweatshop theatrical group in "Thinking Straight" (1975), "The Fork" (1976), and "Stone" (1976), he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1982. Three years later, his performance in the title role of "Richard III" won him a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and, in 1997, he won another Laurence Olivier Award for "Stanley".

Although he spent more time onstage, Sher appeared in a number of films and TV series, including The History Man (1981), Shadey (1985), Das Handbuch des jungen Giftmischers (1995) and Sturm in den Weiden (1996). He gave a charming performance as Benjamin Disraeli in Ihre Majest√§t Mrs. Brown (1997), and played "Dr. Moth" in Shakespeare in Love (1998).

Sher was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2000.
