Among his his most notable stage performances was the lead role of Willy Loman for the RSC's revival of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, again co-starring Walter.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe and his partner, Gregory Doran, with whom he frequently collaborated, were one of the first couples to register for a civil partnership in the United Kingdom."
