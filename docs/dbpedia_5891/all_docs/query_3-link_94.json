        "text": "I was nervous because all of the above can make certain actors rather dismissive. But this wasn’t the case with Sir Antony – he couldn’t have been more engaged, thoughtful, eager even to reveal the wolf under his Shakespearian costume. And, as his life story is as fascinating as his characters, it was a riveting interview.\n\nBorn in a suburb of Cape Town, Antony Sher knew from an early age that to follow his acting dreams he’d need to leave South Africa. What he didn’t know was that once he got to England he’d never leave. Their loss is our gain of course, because Sir Antony has graced our stages ever since, bringing to life all the great leads, boosting the RSC ranks and enjoying a healthy helping of film roles to boot.\n\nCut him in half and he’d have the complete works of Shakespeare running right through his middle, and with interesting work coming in thick and fast, Sir Antony’s still in demand. And yet he’s relishing playing Freud in Hysteria, reaching the Oxford Playhouse next Monday.\n\n“Hysteria swings from one extreme to the other and it’s been fascinating to watch the public come on the journey, shaking with laughter one minute and then silent during the darker side,” he says. “And while it’s difficult to explain, it’s not hard to perform, because the comedy is brilliant and that’s what makes Hysteria fly. It’s such an effective way of making salient points.”\n\nSo had he seen it before? “Not the original but I saw the a production in South Africa, so when I was offered it I went ‘wow’. Not only is it a great play but not one I’ve done, so it wasn’t one of those situations where you have to sit down and decide if you want to do it.”\n\nBased on real-life events, when the great surrealist painter Dali met father of psychoanalysis Freud and they did a sketch together, it’s set during Freud’s last few days (he died soon afterwards of mouth cancer).\n\nHappy as Larry on-stage, off-stage is more of a problem, which is why Sir Antony is such a prolific writer and painter. “I’m easily bored so three careers works better for me,” he admits, “because once a play is on, you’re only on stage for two to three hours in the evening. I paint and write during the day.”\n\nWhat about the cities along the way? “I don’t explore on tour – unless Greg’s with me I’m very unadventurous. When I’m with him I really enjoy it but alone I’m much more timid,” the 63 year-old admits.\n\nGreg Doran, Sir Antony’s partner of 25 years, has just accepted the post of artistic director at the RSC. “We get a house in Stratford with the job, a bit like being the Prime Minister!” he laughs. So he’s delighted? “I veer between bursting with pride and worrying I won’t see him for the next 10 years. Because wherever Greg is is home for me and it’s our silver anniversary this year.”\n\nThe pair return to Africa every year to visit Sir Antony’s relatives. “We love it, stepping off the plane... it still feels so familiar,” he says. So does he ever regret leaving? “No, I left in 1968 – it was too safe, cosy and white. And I left out of ambition and at that time it had to be London to do drama. And when I arrived it was intoxicating because South Africa then was a cultural backwater. I saw legends Olivier and Gielgud, fell in love with it and stayed.”\n\nEven so, it’s still a big deal to leave family and set off into the unknown? “It was exciting,” he says. “I was 19 and going off on a scary adventure. By nature I’m an outsider, being a gay, Jewish, white, South African means I cornered the market in minority groups early!” he beams, “although those are now the aspects I celebrate and who I am.”\n\nHis mother must have been thrilled then when he was knighted? At this he roars with laughter: “She was the archetypal ambitious Jewish mother, but even she didn’t have a knighthood on the radar.” And then he pauses: “She’s got Alzheimer’s now so it was moving she could come with me to Buckingham Palace – she was fully compos mentis for that.”\n\nBut mention his films, of which there are a few (Shakespeare in Love, Mrs Brown, The Wind in the Willows and The Shadow Line), and he’s quite dismissive: “My career has been theatre,” he says. “so I don't regard it in the same league as my film career.”\n\nBack in the day Julie Andrews called their days in Liverpool “anarchy years.” He laughs: “Well we were at the Everyman Theatre with Jonathan Pryce and Pete Postlethwaite, and the company had an anarchic air. It really was ‘people’s theatre’ and totally unconventional.\n\n“It had a profound effect on my career. That’s where I got my best piece of advice: Don’t be passive as an actor, think what you want to say and say it. You have to have passion.”\n\nAs for what’s next, he’ll be back at his beloved RSC, to play what? “There’s not a lot left,” Sir Antony grins. “I’m too young for Lear. I don’t worry about age – work keeps coming, the way it’s always been.”"
