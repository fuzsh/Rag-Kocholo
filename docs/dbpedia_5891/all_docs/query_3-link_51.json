        "text": "It’s fascinating to read an autobiography by a successful actor (and writer, and artist) that dwells so much on a lack of success. Antony Sher isn’t unduly modest – he’s happy to acknowledge the moments of satisfaction that come with ‘having a success’ – but in the vivid prose of Beside Myself, these successes emerge unexpectedly from a malaise of insecurity. A short, ‘scruffy’, gay, Jewish, South African actor who can’t sing, who was rejected from all the drama schools he originally applied to, who develops a brutal cocaine habit – Sher’s life is constantly tinged by his sense of outsiderness and of inadequacy.\n\nGiven he’s previously appeared on Booker longlists, as well as having achieved success with his rehearsal diary books, it shouldn’t be any surprise that Sher’s autobiography is a delight to read. It’s innovatively structured too. The first section, ‘Now’, takes an early 2000 trip to South Africa to bury his father as an organising principle for revisiting his childhood, the fifty-year-old Sher reflecting from his position as a returning adult on what it was like to grow up in South Africa as a white Jew during apartheid. This is an important thread throughout the book as Sher struggles with his identity, increasingly seeing his family and community as lazily complicit in the abuses of the country, yet also needing to work to get the necessary perspective to understand the conflict. This duality – a recurrent theme throughout the autobiography, with Sher placing a lot of stock in his being a Gemini – offers a fascinating, honest account of reckoning with one’s own privilege and culpability, while also working to grow as an individual.\n\nThe central and longest section, ‘Then’, is a more traditional biography of Sher’s time as an actor in Britain. This is presumably what most readers are here for, and it’s a lively insider’s account of the golden age of twentieth-century British theatre, from his days at the Everyman to his first West End engagement (as Ringo Starr!), to his stints at the RSC and the National, to his fleeting grasp at television and film stardom. The major successes – especially Richard III – don’t get nearly as much of a look-in here, though, as the failures (albeit there’s a whole separate book on his Richard III). One of the most exciting chapters reveals just how close he came to playing Chaplin in the Richard Attenborough film, and the agonising potential here of something that could have been clearly weighs on Sher. It’s also a genuinely educational chapter in giving a sense of how these major film castings might come about – and then not happen.\n\nRunning alongside the professional highlights – all handled deftly – is Sher’s personal life, which is inextricable from the professional, especially as he comes out to himself and then increasingly to others and embarks on his two long-term relationships. The complexities of Sher’s attempts to live a queer life – including, at one point, in a four-way relationship that allowed him, at the height of his status, to have his cake and eat it – are some of the most obviously confessional aspects of the book, but part of the joy of the book is that Sher’s immersion in Britain’s artistic communities introduces no end of fascinating characters, from the hellraisers of the RSC rep seasons to Sher’s personal nemesis Simon Callow to a rotating ensemble of therapists, muses, lovers, family members, and more. There’s plenty of gossip here, even if he inevitably shies away from some personal information (the name of the woman he married, and indeed the whole marriage, are withheld).\n\nThrough it all is a deep love of craft. Sher is as prone to talking about the details of constructing novels or the mixing of paints for a new canvas as he is to explaining the intricacies of acting, but he really is fascinating – not least in his insistence that nothing ever works twice. The detailed research processes that lead him to triumphs in some roles become useless in others; his Malvolio was a particular (self-declared) disaster; and sometimes he simply has to walk away from a project that isn’t working. But when it works, he’s enormously insightful. His triumphs as Macbeth and Leontes provide some great insights into both Shakespeare and acting, and his deep love of the role of Stanley Spencer captures something of the euphoria of disappearing into a role. The book doesn’t teach you how to be a good actor, but it’s hard to imagine a more raw or honest account of the ups and downs of trying to make a go of it.\n\nAnd then, in part 3, ‘And Then Again’, Sher revisits parts of his professional career but with a more confessional air, as he admits the role that cocaine (‘Charlie’) played in much of his success. This section, which refocuses Sher’s story as one of recovery, is often moving. He captures in vivid detail the learned behaviours that lead to him calling his dealer, and after having spent so much time with his self-doubt and insecurity, the lure of a drug that inhibits the negative parts of the brain is easy to understand. Greg Doran comes into clearer focus here as a supportive, worried partner, but what also becomes clearer is Sher’s own duality, as he reckons with his demons. The book also doesn’t offer an easy end – while the epilogue to the revised edition marks thirteen years without cocaine, there’s no sense that this is a battle that has been definitively won. In Being Myself, Sher positions himself as his own greatest performance, a combination of careful curation and strategic openness that gives a sense of a complete character, and one who Sher has determined to live with."
