        "text": "British theatre director (born 1958)\n\nSir Gregory Doran (born 24 November 1958)[1] is an English director known for his Shakespearean work. The Sunday Times called him 'one of the great Shakespearians of his generation'.[2]\n\nDoran was artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), succeeding Michael Boyd in September 2012. In an interview, announcing his appointment, Doran said that whilst Boyd had concentrated on the 'Company', he would be concentrating on the 'Shakespeare' in the Royal Shakespeare Company logo.[3] Since April 2022 he is director emeritus at the Royal Shakespeare Company.[4]\n\nHis notable productions include a production of Macbeth starring Antony Sher, which was filmed for Channel 4 in 2001,[5][6] as well as Hamlet in 2008, starring David Tennant and Patrick Stewart.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nDoran was born in Huddersfield, but his family moved to Lancashire when he was six months old.[7] He was educated at St Pius X Catholic Preparatory School and Preston Catholic College.[8] He attended Bristol University studying English and Drama, where he set up his own theatre company with fellow student Chris Grady, presenting Shakespeare and related classics. He then trained as an actor at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.\n\nHe received an honorary doctorate from Bristol University in July 2011[9] and an Honorary Degree from the University of Warwick in July 2013.[10]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDoran left the Bristol Old Vic School early having been invited to direct A Midsummer Night's Dream at Jamestown Community College in upstate New York. He then went to Nottingham Playhouse as an actor, before becoming Assistant Director then Associate Director, directing his own productions, including Waiting for Godot and Long Day's Journey into Night.\n\nAfter a very brief acting career in TV, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1987 initially as an actor (as Solanio in The Merchant of Venice and Octavius Caesar in Julius Caesar) then became Assistant Director the following season.\n\nHe directed his first RSC production in 1992,[11] commissioning Derek Walcott to write an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey which was performed at The Other Place.\n\nIn 1995 he directed his partner Antony Sher in the lead role of Titus Andronicus at the Market Theatre, Johannesburg, South Africa. This controversial production, which toured to the National Theatre, is the subject of their book, Woza Shakespeare!\n\nHe returned to the RSC in 1996, becoming an Associate Director, and directing Jane Lapotaire, Ian Hogg and Paul Jesson in All is True (or Henry VIII), his first Shakespeare for the company. Since then, Doran has directed over half of Shakespeare's plays for the RSC.\n\nDoran took compassionate leave from his role at the RSC in September 2021 to care for his husband, Antony Sher, who was terminally ill. His deputy, Erica Whyman, became acting artistic director.[12] The RSC announced Doran was formally stepping down as artistic director in April 2022, becoming artistic director emeritus until the end of 2023.[4]\n\nTV and books\n\n[edit]\n\nDoran contributed to Michael Wood's BBC series In Search of Shakespeare, and filmed a documentary for BBC Four, called A Midsummer Night's Dreaming.\n\nIn 2009, Doran's Shakespeare Almanac was published.[13][14]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe and frequent collaborator Sir Antony Sher had, when they entered into a civil partnership in 2005, been together since 1987.[15] They married 10 years after their civil partnership, on 30 December 2015. Sher died in December 2021.[16][17]\n\nDoran was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to the Arts.[18]\n\nTheatre productions\n\n[edit]\n\nRSC productions\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Production Playwright Venue Notes 1999 The Winter's Tale William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre Timon of Athens William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre with Michael Pennington[19] 2000 Macbeth William Shakespeare Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon also made into a Channel 4 film 2001 King John William Shakespeare Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon 2002 Much Ado About Nothing William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre with Harriet Walter and Nicholas le Prevost Doran supervised a season of seldom-performed Jacobean plays, including the debatedly Shakespearean Edward III and works by Philip Massinger, John Fletcher, Ben Jonson, John Marston and George Chapman[11] which earned Doran a Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement of the Year[20] 2003 Taming of the Shrew William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre 2003 The Tamer Tamed John Fletcher Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon with Alexandra Gilbreath and Jasper Britton[21] 2003 All's Well That Ends Well William Shakespeare Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon with Judi Dench whose first time back to the RSC after 25 years[22] 2004 Othello William Shakespeare Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon with Antony Sher and Sello Maake Ncube[23] Venus & Adonis William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre Puppet based performance 2005 A Midsummer Night's Dream William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre 2006 Antony and Cleopatra William Shakespeare Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon with Harriet Walter, and Patrick Stewart who both returned to the RSC after 24 years Merry Wives The Musical Based on the play by William Shakespeare, adapted by Gregory Doran, music by Paul Englishby, lyrics by Ranjit Bolt Royal Shakespeare Theatre with Dame Judi Dench and Simon Callow 2007 Coriolanus William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre with Will Houston, Janet Suzman and Timothy West which toured to Madrid and Washington DC (the final production in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre before it closed for redevelopment, re-opening in winter 2010/11) Venus & Adonis William Shakespeare Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon Revival of 2004 production 2008 A Midsummer Night's Dream William Shakespeare Courtyard Theatre Revival of 2005 production Hamlet William Shakespeare Courtyard Theatre with David Tennant and Patrick Stewart, also transferred to the Novello Theatre and adapted into BBC 2009 film Love's Labour's Lost William Shakespeare Courtyard Theatre 2011 Written on the Heart David Edgar Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon\n\nDuchess Theatre\n\nto mark the 400th anniversary of the publication of the King James Bible. 2012 Julius Caesar William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre for the World Shakespeare Festival, which played in Stratford-upon-Avon, London, Moscow, New York and Ohio. 2012 The Orphan of Zhao Ji Junxiang Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon 2013 Richard II William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre\n\nBarbican Centre\n\nwith David Tennant 2014 Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2 William Shakespeare Royal Shakespeare Theatre\n\nBarbican Centre\n\nThe Witch of Edmonton William Rowley, Thomas Dekker and John Ford Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon with Eileen Atkins 2015 Death of a Salesman Arthur Miller Royal Shakespeare Theatre\n\nNoÃ«l Coward Theatre\n\nwith Antony Sher in the role of Willy Loman, Alex Hassell as Biff and Harriet Walter as Linda Loman.
