        "text": "Morning routine My days are completely defined by what I'm doing. If I'm rehearsing a play I get up early to learn lines, because I find the best line-learning time is from 6 to 8am. I love writing early too. But if I'm in a play I might get up a little later, nine o'clock at the latest.\n\nChildhood ambition My ambition was to be an artist, but it somehow changed from art to drama school in my teens. I was a very introvert, shy kid, and, as a lot of actors will tell you, becoming other people can be very liberating.\n\nInterests Greg and I are great wildlife enthusiasts and we're often going off to places to see animals, whether it's whale-watching or safaris. After our civil partnership in 2005 we went to see the mountain gorillas in Uganda. We're about to go and see orang-utans in Borneo.\n\nBest present We take these expensive holidays as gifts to each other. We recently spent three weeks in Turkey for our 20th anniversary, hired a private yacht and sailed around the Mediterranean, just us and a little crew to do everything.\n\nSouvenirs We bring back stones and bits and pieces from places we visit. We've got a bar of soap from Robben Island. I went there when it opened as a museum and picked it up. It could have been used by Mandela!\n\nOn the wall A mixture of things: photos, props, one of my framed First Night cards – I always do cartoons of the company. I've got my knighthood up there next to a photo of my father's father. He moved from Lithuania to South Africa in 1900, and worked as a smous, basically a pedlar. I also have a photo of me at Middlepost, the settlement where he ended up – our family had holidays there.\n\nMoving to Britain In 1968 Britain was everything South Africa wasn't. I had come from one of the most repressed and repressive societies on earth, and this was my first experience of a proper democracy. I pretended not to be white South African because I felt very ashamed of the society that I had come from. I decided I'd better not be Jewish because I couldn't see any Jewish leading actors, and for the first few years here I wasn't gay either.\n\nRitual We bought Ganesh on a big Indian trip we went on in 96 or 97. Ganesh is the god of new beginnings, so whenever either of us is starting a play we make a little wish.\n\nFavourite painting Often after finishing a production I will do a painting as a way of remembering it. I have sold a lot of them, but I will never sell the one of me and Harriet Walter as Lady Macbeth in the production that Greg directed at the RSC in 1999. I felt that I was able to capture the dark, dangerous, unpredictable play in a very spontaneous, fast-painted work.\n\nFavourite films My all time favourite is Fellini and his film Satyricon. It is the best recreation of Ancient Rome I have ever seen. In the early 1970s in London I remember watching John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday, about the triangular relationship of an older couple with a young bisexual man. When the boy and the man, played by Peter Finch, meet for the first time they kiss. The combination of seeing that on a cinema screen and hearing the entire audience gasp in horror made a huge impression on me. I was in a freer society but one that still had a long way to go.\n\nMusic I have a lot of compilation tapes of South African music – Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, the Soweto String Quartet. Whenever we visit (my two brothers and my sister still live there), we buy new supplies.\n\nFavourite homecooked meal I can't cook at all, one of the disadvantages of having been brought up white South African, with servants. Greg is an awfully good cook. He learnt my favourite South African dish, tomato bredie, a traditional tomato and lamb stew. It's absolutely delicious and he makes it better than any South African now."
