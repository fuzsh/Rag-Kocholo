        "text": "Denmark is setting a global standard. The Danish national football team has taken a monumental step towards financial equality between men and women. This wasn't just a symbolic gesture. It was powerful and transparent. Standing together for a better world and equality in sport. During negotiations for their new four-year contract, the men's team decided to forgo additional pay until the women's bonuses were raised to the same level. They succeeded: After the European Championship, the gender pay gap in Danish football will be history. Additionally, female footballers will enjoy enhanced insurance coverage and benefit from a new development fund. Yes, they were giving up privileges, including raising their paycheck. But this isnâ€™t about debating the revenue of women's football. It's about envisioning what we can achieve when we stand together for our rights. The #Indeed Survey, #WorkNeedsWomen (https://lnkd.in/ecTF6bRy) highlights the critical role of the joint effort in achieving global equity. Now is the time to act. Empower your employees, close the pay gaps, and foster a workplace where everyone can thrive. Together, let's drive this change forward. #salarytransparency #equalsport #equalopportunities ID!: Picture the Danish Men's Football Team, standing as a team together, with a statement from the author Ute Neher: Congratulations, Denmark: Champions of Equality in Football and a symbolic trophy.\n\nRECORD NUMBER OF WOMEN IN THE CABINET AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. Now, we need a majority of women in power for a happier, fairer and kinder country. Ten years ago, Alan Bennett, one of our greatest writers, was asked what would make England a happier, fairer, and more caring country to live and work in. He answered, \"Abolish private education.\" For thirty years, we've voluntarily and unpaid campaigned for a more level playing field on behalf of 5.2 million #startups, self-employed people, freelancers, and micro business owners. We've yet to make progress. The rich have got incredibly richer, but independent, enterprising people have found it progressively harder to make ends meet. There is serious debt, a mental health tsunami, the use of food banks normalised, 3 million children in poverty, 3.8 million #ExcludedUK and no #payin30days or less. \"Growth\" is the mantra of political parties. Yet an unhappy, sick, and tired working population struggles to keep their heads above polluted water because they must reduce the outrageous basic living and business costs. There is no \"magic money tree\" for us, but we know there is for the elite. It's the Bank of England. The banks were bailed out during the financial crisis, major employers and suppliers to the Government were bailed out, and many were enriched during the pandemic. Courtesy of Brexit, we were promised Â£350 million a week for our NHS and forty new hospitals. Yet, NHS waiting lists have increased to 8 million, and the wait for treatment kills enterprising people. The elite have private healthcare as well as private education for their families. Alan Bennett said, \"Private education is not fair. To educate according to the social situation of parents is both wrong and a waste\". We don't believe fairness is an aim of the elite. It's why they talk about 'late payment; and we talk about 'unfair payment terms and practices'. Perpetuation of their exclusive, male-dominated 'club', increasing personal power and wealth are the priorities. This exclusive male-dominated club is all-powerful, and more people want to join it every year. This exclusive club includes 65% of senior judges, 59% of permanent secretaries, 57% of Lords, 52% of diplomats, 52% of junior ministers, 45% of public policy chairs, 44% of newspaper columnists, and so forth. Only 7% of the UK are privately educated. Nearly half of the CEOs in the FTSE 350 and the majority of the Cabinet are in this exclusive club. Fewer than 10% of FTSE 350 CEOs are female. Alan Bennett's proposed private education reform didn't appear in any General Election manifestos. However, we don't think the ruling elite wants to change its game, so we must. In the video, we explain why kind leadership, trickle-up rather than trickle-down, and a happier, enterprising country is possible through self-educated, highly professional, and practically competent women holding the reins of power.\n\nSome of the best ideas are dreamed up in the bar. Just like the Homeless World Cup. This life-changing international event was the brainchild of Mel Young MBE after a chat over drinks with a friend. However, unlike like most pub conversations? Mel acted on it. And Netflixâ€™s The Beautiful Game tells his epic story. Truth be told, Iâ€™d never been much of a football fan. But then I met Mel and volunteered for the Homeless World Cup (HWC) tournament in 2005. I quickly realised. Itâ€™s not just about the game. Itâ€™s about the people. Football is a simple, shared language. HWC's impact reports highlight the power this beautiful game has: âš½ 94% of players say the Homeless World Cup positively impacted their lives. âš½ 77% say that it changed their lives significantly. âš½ 83% think it improved their social relations with family and friends. I subsequently got the chance to meet some of the national players in Kenya, when I was out there doing voluntary work. The first question I was asked: â€˜Do you know David Beckham?â€™ At the time, the team played from a piece of land in Kibera, the largest urban slum in Africa. Their ball was fashioned out of scrunched up plastic bags and string. But they were a national team. And they mattered. And they were celebrated. Many great initiatives have been established around football. Like Inverness-based former professional footballer Mark Holmes who set up childrenâ€™s football academies in Ghana, Zambia, and Kenya. Football is the door for these youngsters to get out of poverty - even if they donâ€™t become professional players. Placing an importance on education, the rule is that the youngsters always have to finish their homework before they can train! (If you're wondering, that's a pic of me with the Kenya HWC team coaches from 2006!) Want to learn more? A few links in the comments ðŸ‘‡ #socialdevelopment #football #sport"
