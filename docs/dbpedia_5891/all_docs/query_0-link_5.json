        "text": "Antony Sher as Falstaff\n\nYouth and age, the passing of time, are among the themes in explored by Shakespeare in Henry IV parts 1 and 2, and watching Gregory Doran’s production for the RSC at the Lowry last week the decades slid away and I was a youth again, turning the pages of the play we studied for A-level, never imagining I could ever be as old as Falstaff or Justice Shallow.\n\nNow freed from the chains of toil at desk or workbench, we can join the silver-haired throngs and spend an afternoon watching Part 1, and then see Part 2 in the evening. Seeing the plays back to back like this showed how much Shakespeare was on a roll: having kicked off his series about the rise of the House of Lancaster with Richard II in 1595, a year or so later, in Henry IV Part 1, he produced one of his most popular plays, introducing comic characters who reappeared in the equally successful sequels that followed in quick succession – Henry IV, Part 2 (1598) and Henry V (1599).\n\nBoth of the Henry IV plays mix serious history and politics with riotous comedy in a way that has probably never been done so seamlessly and so successfully. In fact, for most of us what lingers after seeing these plays is the memory of the comedy scenes – and of the character of Falstaff in particular. Ever since their first performance, it has been the boisterous rowdiness of the tavern scenes presided over by that ‘ squire of the night’, that ‘sweet creature of bombast’ Falstaff that have won the hearts of audiences.\n\nIn this production Falstaff is played by Antony Sher – not a man of great stature – who is bulked up and padded out in a fat suit and enormous wig of white flowing locks. Sher’s movements are not only those of a fat man (there’s an hilarious moment on the battlefield when, legs waving in the air like a beetle, he struggles to get off his back), but also those of a gouty, arthritic old man. Sher’s Falstaff enunciates his words with an educated precision and a throatiness that often sounded as if he was gargling. Sher delivers Falstaff’s lines in a manner that eliminates any sense that the fat man is at all lovable. Quite the opposite: Sher’s performance makes it abundantly clear that he is a schemer and a rapacious deceiver, every riposte and criticism answered with a sharp and deliberative wiliness. Not so ‘fat-witted’, then, but the ‘villainous abominable misleader of youth’ and ‘old white-bearded Satan’ that Prince Henry calls him. This means that any sympathy you might feel for Falstaff when he delivers this speech is eliminated:\n\nBut to say I know more harm in him than in myself,\n\nwere to say more than I know. That he is old, the\n\nmore the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but\n\nthat he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,\n\nthat I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,\n\nGod help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a\n\nsin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if\n\nto be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s lean kine\n\nare to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,\n\nbanish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack\n\nFalstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,\n\nvaliant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,\n\nbeing, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him\n\nthy Harry’s company, banish not him thy Harry’s\n\ncompany: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.\n\nFalstaff is also quite clearly an alcoholic. While there’s obviously a great deal of sack quaffed in Shakespeare’s text, Antony Sher gives us a Falstaff whose hand shakes with delirium tremens as he pours yet another glass. One of the highlights of Sher’s performance is his delivery of Falstaff’s celebration of good sherry, and assertion that if he had sons the first humane principle he would teach them should be ‘to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack’:\n\nA good sherris sack hath a two-fold\n\noperation in it. It ascends me into the brain;\n\ndries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy\n\nvapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,\n\nquick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and\n\ndelectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the\n\nvoice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes\n\nexcellent wit. The second property of your\n\nexcellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;\n\nwhich, before cold and settled, left the liver\n\nwhite and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity\n\nand cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes\n\nit course from the inwards to the parts extreme:\n\nit illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives\n\nwarning to all the rest of this little kingdom,\n\nman, to arm; and then the vital commoners and\n\ninland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,\n\nthe heart, who, great and puffed up with this\n\nretinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour\n\ncomes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is\n\nnothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and\n\nlearning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till\n\nsack commences it and sets it in act and use.\n\nHereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for\n\nthe cold blood he did naturally inherit of his\n\nfather, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,\n\nmanured, husbanded and tilled with excellent\n\nendeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile\n\nsherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If\n\nI had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I\n\nwould teach them should be, to forswear thin\n\npotations and to addict themselves to sack.\n\nAs always, the Falstaff scenes are great entertainment. But I also particularly enjoyed the long scene in Part Two between Silence and Justice Shallow (a soulful Oliver Ford Davies) in which they reminisce about the days that used to be. Shallow is wonderfully eloquent about the loss of youth and the rewards of friendship:\n\nBy the mass, I was called any thing; and I would\n\nhave done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.\n\nThere was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,\n\nand black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and\n\nWill Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such\n\nswinge-bucklers in all the inns o’ court again: and\n\nI may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were\n\nand had the best of them all at commandment.\n\n(‘Bona-robas’, by the way, were prostitutes.) At times I thought their exchanges sounded almost as if they might have been written by Beckett:\n\nSHALLOW:\n\nJesu, Jesu, the mad days that I\n\nhave spent! and to see how many of my old\n\nacquaintance are dead!\n\nSILENCE:\n\nWe shall all follow, cousin.\n\nSHADOW:\n\nCertain, ’tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,\n\nas the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall\n\ndie. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?\n\nSILENCE:\n\nBy my troth, I was not there.\n\nSHALLOW:\n\nDeath is certain. Is old Double of your town living\n\nyet?\n\nSILENCE:\n\nDead, sir.\n\nAnother scene of dissoluteness and debauchery in Part Two that caught my attention was the one in which Mistress Quickly – in a stream of consciousness torrent of words that might have come from the pen of James Joyce – rages about all Falstaff’s unpaid bills:\n\nI am undone by his going; I warrant you, he’s an\n\ninfinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,\n\nhold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not\n\n‘scape. A’ comes continuantly to Pie-corner – saving\n\nyour manhoods–to buy a saddle; and he is indited to\n\ndinner to the Lubber’s-head in Lumbert street, to\n\nMaster Smooth’s the silkman: I pray ye, since my\n\nexion is entered and my case so openly known to the\n\nworld, let him be brought in to his answer. A\n\nhundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to\n\nbear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and\n\nhave been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed\n\noff, from this day to that day, that it is a shame\n\nto be thought on. There is no honesty in such\n\ndealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and a\n\nbeast, to bear every knave’s wrong. Yonder he\n\ncomes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,\n\nwith him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master\n\nFang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.\n\nTime passing, and old age creeping on. With maturity comes responsibility, atheme explored by Shakespeare in his depiction of the central relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal (Alex Hassell) as he frequents the taverns of Eastcheap. In some productions, Hal is portrayed as a dissolute youth Lacking any sense of his future kingly role, but here Gregory Doran has JHassell play Hal as much more self-aware: a young man who knows he’s not being particularly princely, but fully intends to change his behaviour when the moment comes.\n\nThe most surprising feature of Doran’s production of Part One is the treatment of Hotspur. Though Henry IV rebukes his son for haunting taverns and playing truant from honour while Hotspur is valiant and battle-hardened, Trevor White’s unusual performance presents him as a near-autistic hothead, impatient to the point of derangement, who continually prances around in anger, unable to listen to other people. He is far from being the dutiful son King Henry wishes Hal would be: rather than embodiment of chivalry and valour, he is more like a violent overgrown child.\n\nHenry IV part I: tavern scene\n\nWhat is so remarkable about these plays is the way in which Shakespeare weaves together low-life scenes with serious themes of politics and kingship. What makes a ruler legitimate? Which qualities are desirable in a ruler? When it is acceptable to usurp a ruler’s authority? In the programme, there’s an interesting essay in which the historian Ian Mortimer notes how Shakespeare had to be very careful in how he approached that last question. Henry’s seizure of the throne from Richard II might have removed a tyrannous ruler, but he had been the rightful king of England:\n\nHenry had saved England from tyranny by removing Richard from the throne but such a strategy was anathema to ElizabethI, who locked up one historian in the Tower of London simply for writing a book about Henry IV. To portray such usurpation as not only succesful but blessed by God was far too dangerous. So Shakespeare downplayed the role of Henry IV. He focussed on the people around the king. There was no danger in celebrating the king’s son, Henry V, the hero who led the English to victory at Agincourt.\n\nUneasy lies the head that wears a crown. We might add that Shakespeare’s portrayal of Henry IV (played here by Jasper Britton) is of a man wracked by guilt, determined – as soon as the rebel alliance of Percy, Mortimer, Glendower and Douglas has been put down – to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem (he only gets as far as the Jerusalem chamber in the palace of Westminster). In the dramatically-staged opening scene, with a candlelit background of chanting monks, Henry IV is a tormented usurper, seen beneath the figure of Christ prostrate in self-abasing prayer. Stephen Brimson Lewis’s set design was sombre throughout, the stage lined on all sides with wooden slats, like unplastered lath walls, though perhaps not best suited to bringing out the rambunctiousness of the tavern scenes.\n\nWith recent political events in Scotland and the growing restiveness in places far-flung from London fresh in mind, I found myself tuning into Shakespeare’s portrayal of a kingdom not only disunited but also one of great diversity. The presentation of the accents, culture and traditions of the North, and of Wales and Scotland forms a key element of Part One. Shakespeare incorporates into the play many different languages, dialects and manners of expression, from Welsh and Scots dialect to the rough language Hal encounters in the taverns of Eastcheap. Gregory Doran emphasises this beautifully in the scene from Part One in which the Welsh leader Owen Glendower is present with Lord Mortimer and his Welsh wife, Glendower’s daughter. She can speak only Welsh, her husband only English. Shakespeare’s stage directions read: ‘Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same’. Doran treats us to an extended interchange between the the three characters, with Glendower’s daughter speaking expansively in Welsh. This was a captioned performance and it was lovely to be able to see, as well as hear, the Welsh words.\n\nShakespeare was obviously fascinated with the accents, traditions, and legends of the various nations of the British Isle, though his portrayal of the Welsh Glendower and the Scottish Douglas does also obtain laughs from what would have been for his audience recognisable stereotypes – Glendower the magician (looking like Ian McKellen’s Gandalf complete with staff) and Douglas as the hotheaded warrior:\n\nGLENDOWER:\n\nI can call spirits from the vasty deep.\n\nHOTSPUR:\n\nWhy, so can I, or so can any man;\n\nBut will they come when you do call for them?\n\nNevertheless, the range of language and forms of expression in these plays is astonishing: in addition to high speech and low speech, there is poetry and prose, as well as various regional accents.\n\nIn the first play there is a running debate about the nature of honour. For the quick-tempered Hotspur, honour means glory on the battlefield and the defence of his reputation and good name against perceived insults:\n\nBy heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,\n\nTo pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,\n\nOr dive into the bottom of the deep,\n\nWhere fathom-line could never touch the ground,\n\nAnd pluck up drowned honour by the locks;\n\nFor the troubled king, on the other hand, honour is bound up with the well-being of the nation and his legitimacy as ruler. It lies at the root of his anxiety about how usurpation of Richard II, which won him the crown, might be seen as be a dishonourable act:\n\nAnd is not this an honourable spoil?\n\nA gallant prize?\n\nThen there is the matter of a son bringing honour to his father, when the king speaks of ‘Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes’ :\n\nMy Lord Northumberland\n\nShould be the father to so blest a son,\n\nA son who is the theme of honour’s tongue;\n\nAmongst a grove, the very straightest plant;\n\nWho is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride:\n\nWhilst I, by looking on the praise of him,\n\nSee riot and dishonour stain the brow\n\nOf my young Harry.\n\nThe Prince attempts to calm his father’s fears in a speech that reveals his certainty that he can regain his honour at will:\n\nIn the closing of some glorious day\n\nBe bold to tell you that I am your son;\n\nWhen I will wear a garment all of blood\n\nAnd stain my favours in a bloody mask,\n\nWhich, wash’d away, shall scour my shame with it:\n\nAnd that shall be the day, whene’er it lights,\n\nThat this same child of honour and renown,\n\nThis gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,\n\nAnd your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.\n\nFor every honour sitting on his helm,\n\nWould they were multitudes, and on my head\n\nMy shames redoubled! for the time will come,\n\nThat I shall make this northern youth exchange\n\nHis glorious deeds for my indignities.\n\nThe best speech on the subject is given to the man who has no honour, the amoral rogue Falstaff, for whom the idea is nothing but hot air:\n\nWell, ’tis no matter; honour pricks\n\nme on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I\n\ncome on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or\n\nan arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.\n\nHonour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is\n\nhonour? a word. What is in that word honour? what\n\nis that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?\n\nhe that died o’ Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.\n\nDoth he hear it? no. ‘Tis insensible, then. Yea,\n\nto the dead. But will it not live with the living?\n\nno. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore\n\nI’ll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so\n\nends my catechism.\n\nAlex Hassell as Prince Hal, trying on the crown in Henry IV part two\n\nIn the afternoon, in Part One, we saw the king preparing for war against the insurrectionists and Prince Hal coming to terms with his responsibilities as heir to the throne. In the evening, in Part Two, the King’s health is fading and Hal finally chooses between duty to his country and loyalty to an old friend: ‘I know you not, old man’. While Henry IV Part II lacks the power of Part One, this production contained some wonderful moments and was as entertaining as the earlier play, especially in the comic scenes featuring Falstaff as well as the red-nosed Bardolph (Joshua Richards), Mistress Quickly (younger than I had imagined her to be, energetically played by a spikyPaola Dionisotti), the wild, anarchic, incomprehensible Pistol (Antony Byrne), and Justice Shallow.\n\nAnother scene that played well was when the dying king wakes to find Hal has taken the crown. Angry at first, he is reconciled with his son before he dies. A new, mature Hal accepts the crown as King Henry V and turns his attention to war with France, having been urged by his father ‘to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels’. It’s a line that never seems to lose its pertinence.\n\nThe moment when Prince Hal, in procession to his coronation, finally denies Falstaff is quite shocking in the severity of Alex Hassell’s delivery of the line ‘I know you not, old man’ and the cursoriness of his manner. Doran dispenses with Shakespeare’s ending – an ‘epilogue spoken by a dancer’ – which reveals that the sequel was already planned:\n\nOne word more, I beseech you. If you be not too\n\nmuch cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will\n\ncontinue the story, with Sir John in it, and make\n\nyou merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for\n\nany thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,\n\nunless already a’ be killed with your hard\n\nopinions.\n\nInstead, after Prince John has uttered the promise of foreign wars –\n\nI will lay odds that, ere this year expire,\n\nWe bear our civil swords and native fire\n\nAs far as France: I beard a bird so sing,\n\nWhose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.\n\nCome, will you hence?\n\n– Doran has the stage darken, a single shaft of light illuminating the figure of a small boy.\n\nAfter nearly six hours of drama we emerged into the unusual warmth of a Salford October night well satisfied with a production that had brought out the richness of Shakespeare’s plays and his remarkable ability to present audiences with the full range of human experience."
