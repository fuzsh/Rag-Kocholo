MEANS OF EXPRESSING CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY A TREATY\n\nThe consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be expressed by signature,\n\nexchange of instruments constituting a treaty, ratification, acceptance, approval or\n\naccession, or by any other means if so agreed.\n\nArticle 12. CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY A TREATY EXPRESSED BY SIGNATURE\n\n1. The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is expressed by the signature\n\nof its representative when:\n\n(a) The treaty provides that signature shall have that effect;\n\n(b) It is otherwise established that the negotiating States were agreed that signature\n\nshould have that effect; or\n\n(c) The intention of the State to give that effect to the signature appears from the\n\nfull powers of its representative or was expressed during the negotiation.\n\n2. For the purposes of paragraph 1:\n\n(a) The initialling of a text constitutes a signature of the treaty when it is established\n\nthat the negotiating States so agreed;\n\n(b) The signature ad referendum of a treaty by a representative, if confirmed by his\n\nState, constitutes a full signature of the treaty.\n\nArticle 13. CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY A TR\"ATY EXPRESSED\n\nBY AN EXCHANGE OF INSTRUMENTS CONSTITUTING A TREATY\n\nThe consent of States to be bound by a treaty constituted by instruments exchanged\n\nbetween them is expressed by that exchange when:\n\n(a) The instruments provide that their exchange shall have that effect; or\n\n(b) It is otherwise established that those States were agreed that the exchange of instruments\n\nshall have that effect.\n\nArticle 14.

The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is expressed by acceptance or\n\napproval under conditions similar to those which apply to ratification.\n\nArticle 15. CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY A TREATY EXPRESSED BY ACCESSION\n\nThe consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is expressed by accession when:\n\n(a) The treaty provides that such consent may be expressed by that State by means\n\nof accession;\n\n(b) It is otherwise established that the negotiating States were agreed that such consent\n\nmay be expressed by that State by means of accession; or\n\n(c) All the parties have subsequently agreed that such consent may be expressed by\n\nthat State by means of accession.\n\nArticle 16. EXCHANGE OR DEPOSIT OF INSTRUMENTS OF RATIFICATION,\n\nACCEPTANCE, APPROVAL OR ACCESSION\n\nUnless the treaty otherwise provides, instruments of ratification, acceptance,\n\napproval or accession establish the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty upon:\n\n(a) Their exchange between the contracting States;\n\n(b) Their deposit with the depositary; or\n\n(c) Their notification to the contracting States or to the depositary, if so agreed.\n\nArticle 17.

OBLIGATION NOT TO DEFEAT THE OBJECT AND PURPOSE\n\nOF A TREATY PRIOR TO ITS ENTRY INTO FORCE\n\nA State is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose\n\nof a treaty when:\n\n(a) It has signed the treaty or has exchanged instruments constituting the treaty\n\nsubject to ratification, acceptance or approval, until it shall have made its intention\n\nclear not to become a party to the treaty; or\n\n(b) It has expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty, pending the entry into\n\nforce of the treaty and provided that such entry into force is not unduly\n\ndelayed.\n\nSECTlON 2. RESERVATIONS\n\nArticle 19. FORMULATION OF RESERVATIONS\n\nA State may, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a\n\ntreaty, formulate a reservation unless:\n\n(a) The reservation is prohibited by the treaty;\n\nVol. 1155, 1-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n1980 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unies - Recuell des Traites 337\n\n(b) The treaty provides that only specified reservations, which do not include the\n\nreservation in question, may be made; or\n\n(c) In cases not falling under sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), the reservation is incompatible\n\nwith the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\nArticle 20. ACCEPTANCE OF AND OBJECTION TO RESERVATIONS\n\n1. A reservation expressly authorized by a treaty does not require any subsequent\n\nacceptance by the other contracting States unless the treaty so provides.\n\n2. When it appears from the limited number of the negotiating States and the\n\nobject and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its entirety between\n\nall the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound\n\nby the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties.\n\n3. When a treaty is a constituent instrument of an international organization\n\nand unless it otherwise provides, a reservation requires the acceptance of the competent\n\norgan of that organization.\n\n4. In cases not falling under the preceding paragraphs and unless the treaty\n\notherwise provides:\n\n(a) Acceptance by another contracting State of a reservation constitutes the reserving\n\nState a party to the treaty in relation to that other State if or when the treaty\n\nis in force for those States;\n\n(b) An objection by another contracting State to a reservation does not preclude\n\nthe entry into force of the treaty as between the objecting and reserving States\n\nunless a contrary intention is definitely expressed by the objecting State;\n\n(c) An act expressing a State's consent to be bound by the treaty and containing a\n\nreservation is effective as soon as at least one other conti:acting State has accepted\n\nthe reservation.\n\n5. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 4 and unless the treaty otherwise provides,\n\na reservation is considered to have been accepted by a State if it shall have raised\n\nno objection to the reservation by the end of a period of twelve months after it was\n\nnotified of the reservation or by the date on which it expressed its consent to be\n\nbound by the treaty, whichever is later.\n\nArticle 21. LEGAL EFFECTS OF RESERVATIONS\n\nAND OF OBJECTIONS TO RESERVATIONS\n\n1. A reservation established with regard to another party in accordance with\n\narticles 19, 20 and 23:\n\n(a) Modifies for the reserving State in its relations with that other party the provisions\n\nof the treaty to which the reservation relates to the extent of the reservation;\n\nand\n\n(b) Modifies those provisions to the same extent for that other party in its relations\n\nwith the reserving State.\n\n2. The reservation does not modify the provisions of the treaty for the other\n\nparties to the treaty inter se.\n\n3. When a State objecting to a reservation has not opposed the entry into force\n\nof the treaty between itself and the reserving State, the provisions to which the reservation\n\nrelates do not apply as between the two States to the extent of the reservation.\n\nVol. 1155, l-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n338 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unies - Recueil des Traltes\n\nArticle 22. WITHDRAWAL OF RESERVATIONS\n\nAND OF OBJECTIONS TO RESERVATIONS\n\n1980\n\n1. Unless the treaty otherwise provides, a reservation may be withdrawn at any\n\ntime and the consent of a State which has accepted the reservation is not required for\n\nits withdrawal.\n\n2. Unless the treaty otherwise provides, an objection to a reservation may be\n\nwithdrawn at any time.\n\n3. Unless the treaty otherwise provides, or it is otherwise agreed:\n\n(a) The withdrawal of a reservation becomes operative in relation to another contracting\n\nState only when notice of it has been received by that State;\n\n(b) The withdrawal of an objection to a reservation becomes operative only when\n\nnotice of it has been received by the State which formulated the reservation.\n\nArticle 23. PROCEDURE REGARDING RESERVATIONS\n\n1. A reservation, an express acceptance of a reservation and an objection to a\n\nreservation must be formulated in writing and communicated to the contracting\n\nStates and other States entitled to become parties to the treaty.\n\n2. If formulated when signing the treaty subject to ratification, acceptance or\n\napproval, a reservation must be formally confirmed by the reserving State when expressing\n\nits consent to be bound by the treaty. In such a case the reservation shall be\n\nconsidered as having been made on the date of its confirmation.\n\n3. An express acceptance of, or an objection to, a reservation made previously\n\nto confirmation of the reservation does not itself require confirmation.\n\n4. The withdrawal of a reservation or of an objection to a reservation must be\n\nformulated in writing.\n\nSECTION 3. ENTRY INTO FORCE AND PROVISIONAL APPLICATION OF TREATIES\n\nArticle 24. ENTRY INTO FORCE\n\n1. A treaty enters into force in such manner and upon such date as it may provide\n\nor as the negotiating States may agree.\n\n2. Failing any such provision or agreement, a treaty enters into force as soon\n\nas consent to be bound by the treaty has been established for all the negotiating\n\nStates.\n\n3. When the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is established on a date\n\nafter the treaty has come into force, the treaty enters into force for that State on that\n\ndate, unless the treaty otherwise provides.\n\n4. The provisions of a treaty regulating the authentication of its text, the\n\nestablishment of the consent of States to be bound by the treaty, the manner or date\n\nof its entry into force, reservations, the functions of the depositary and other matters\n\narising necessarily before the entry into force of the treaty apply from the time of the\n\nadoption of its text.\n\nArticle 25. PROVISIONAL APPLICATION\n\n1. A treaty or a part of a treaty is applied provisionally pending its entry into\n\nforce if:\n\n(a) The treaty itself so provides; or\n\n(b) The negotiating States have in some other manner so agreed.\n\nVol. 1155, 1-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n1980 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unies - Recuell des Traltes 339\n\n2. Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the negotiating States have otherwise\n\nagreed, the provisional application of a treaty or a part of a treaty with respect\n\nto a State shall be terminated if that State notifies the other States between which the\n\ntreaty is being applied provisionally of its intention not to become a party to the treaty.\n\nPART 111. OBSERVANCE, APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION\n\nOF TREATIES\n\nSECTION I. OBSERVANCE OF TREATIES\n\nArticle 26. \"PACTA SUNT SERVANDA\"\n\nEvery treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by\n\nthem in good faith.\n\nArticle 27. INTERNAL LAW AND OBSERVANCE OF TREATIES\n\nA party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its\n\nfailure to perform a treaty. This rule is without prejudice to article 46.\n\nSECTION 2. APPLICATION OF TREATIES\n\nArticle 28. NoN-RETROACTIVITY OF TREATIES\n\nUnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established,\n\nits provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or\n\nany situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty\n\nwith respect to that party.\n\nArticle 29. TERRITORIAL SCOPE OF TREATIES\n\nUnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, a\n\ntreaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory.\n\nArticle 30. APPLICATION OF SUCCESSIVE TREATIES RELATING\n\nTO THE SAME SUBJECT-MATTER\n\n1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and\n\nobligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter\n\nshall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.\n\n2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered\n\nas incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty\n\nprevail.\n\n3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty\n\nbut the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the\n\nearlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those\n\nof the later treaty.\n\n4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the\n\nearlier one:\n\n(a) As between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in paragraph 3;\n\n(b) As between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one of the\n\ntreaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their mutual rights\n\nand obligations.\n\n5. Paragraph 4 is without prejudice to article 41, or to any question of the termination\n\nor suspension of the operation of a treaty under article 60 or to any quesVol.\n\nll55, 1-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n340 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unies - Recueil des Traltes 1980\n\ntion of responsibility which may arise for a State from the conclusion or application\n\nof a treaty the provisions of which are incompatible with its obligations towards\n\nanother State under another treaty.\n\nSECTION 3. INTERPRETATION OF TREATIES\n\nArticle 31. GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary\n\nmeaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its\n\nobject and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise,\n\nin addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in\n\nconnexion with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the\n\nconclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument\n\nrelated to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of\n\nthe treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the\n\nagreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the\n\nparties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties\n\nso intended.\n\nArticle 32. SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the\n\npreparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to\n\nconfirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the\n\nmeaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\nArticle 33. INTERPRETATION OF TREATIES AUTHENTICATED\n\nIN TWO OR MORE LANGUAGES\n\n1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is\n\nequally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree\n\nthat, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.\n\n2. A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the\n\ntext was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides\n\nor the parties so agree.\n\n3. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each\n\nauthentic text.\n\n4. Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1,\n\nwhen a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the\n\napplication of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles\n\nthe texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.\n\nVol. 1155, 1-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n1980 United Nations - Treaty Serles • Nations Unies - Recueil des Traites 341\n\nSECTION 4. TREATIES AND THIRD STATES\n\nArticle 34. GENERAL RULE REGARDING THIRD STATES\n\nA treaty does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its\n\nconsent.\n\nArticle 35. TREATIES PROVIDING FOR OBLIGATIONS FOR THIRD STATES\n\nAn obligation arises for a third State from a provision of a treaty if the parties to\n\nthe treaty intend the provision to be the means of establishing the obligation and the\n\nthird State expressly accepts that obligation in writing.\n\nArticle 36. TREATIES PROVIDING FOR RIGHTS FOR THI.RD STATES\n\nI. A right arises for a third State from a provision of a treaty if the parties to\n\nthe treaty intend the provision to accord that right either to the third State, or to a\n\ngroup of States to which it belongs, or to all States, and the third State assents\n\nthereto. Its assent shall be presumed so long as the contrary is not indicated, unless\n\nthe treaty otherwise provides.\n\n2. A State exercising a right in accordance with paragraph 1 shall comply with\n\nthe conditions for its exercise provided for in the treaty or established in conformity\n\nwith the treaty.\n\nArticle 37. REVOCATION OR MODIFICATION OF OBLIGATIONS\n\nOR RIGHTS OF THIRD STATES\n\nI. When an obligation has arisen for a third State in conformity with article\n\n35, the obligation may be revoked or modified only with the consent of the parties\n\nto the treaty and of the third State, unless it is established that they had otherwise\n\nagreed.\n\n2. When a right has arisen for a third State in conformity with article 36, the\n\nright may not be revoked or modified by the parties if it is established that the right\n\nwas intended not to be revocable or subject to modification without the consent of\n\nthe third State.\n\nArticle 38. RULES IN A TREATY BECOMING BINDING ON THIRD STATES\n\nTHROUGH INTERNATIONAL CUSTOM\n\nNothing in articles 34 to 37 precludes a rule set forth in a treaty from becoming\n\nbinding upon a third State as a customary rule of international law, recognized as\n\nsuch.\n\nPART 1v. AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION OF TREATIES\n\nArticle 39. GENERAL RULE REGARDING THE AMENDMENT OF TREATIES\n\nA treaty may be amended by agreement between the parties. The rules laid down\n\nin Part II apply to such an agreement except in so far as the treaty may otherwise provide.\n\nArticle 40. AMENDMENT OF MULTILATERAL TREATIES\n\nI. Unless the treaty otherwise provides, the amendment of multilateral treaties\n\nshall be governed by the following paragraphs.\n\n2. Any proposal to amend a multilateral treaty as between all the parties must\n\nbe notified to all the contracting States, each one of which shall have the right to take\n\npart in:\n\nVol. !155, l-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n342 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unles - Recueil des Traites 1980\n\n(a) The decision as to the action to be taken in regara to sul.'.n proposal;\n\n(b) The negotiation and conclusion of any agreement for the amendment of the\n\ntreaty.\n\n3. Every State entitled to become a party to the treaty shall also be entitled to\n\nbecome a party to the treaty as amended.\n\n4. The amending agreement does not bind any State already a party to the treaty\n\nwhich does not become a party to the amending agreement; article 30, paragraph 4(b),\n\napplies in relation to such State.\n\n5. Any State which becomes a party to the treaty after the entry into force of\n\nthe amending agreement shall, failing an expression of a different intention by that\n\nState:\n\n(a) be considered as a party to the treaty as amended; and\n\n(b) be considered as a party to the unamended treaty in relation to any party to the\n\ntreaty not bound by the amending agreement.\n\nArticle 41. AGREEMENTS TO MODIFY MULTILATERAL TREATIES\n\nBETWEEN CERTAIN OF THE PARTIES ONLY\n\n1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement\n\nto modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:\n\n(a) The possibility of such a modification is provided for by the treaty; or\n\n(b) The modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:\n\n(i) Does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under the\n\ntreaty or the performance of their obligations;\n\n(ii) Does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is incompatible\n\nwith the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty as a\n\nwhole.\n\n2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph l(a) the treaty otherwise provides,\n\nthe parties in question shall notify the other parties of their intention to conclude the\n\nagreement and of the modification to the treaty for which it provides.\n\nPART v. INVALIDITY, TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION\n\nOF THE OPERATION OF TREATIES\n\nSECTION !. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 42. VALIDITY AND CONTINUANCE IN FORCE OF TREATIES\n\n1. The validity of a treaty or of the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty\n\nmay be impeached only through the application of the present Convention.\n\n2. The termination of a treaty, its denunciation or the withdrawal of a party,\n\nmay take place only as a result of the application of the provisions of the treaty or of\n\nthe present Convention. The same rule applies to suspension of the operation of a\n\ntreaty.\n\nArticle 43. OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW\n\nINDEPENDENTLY OF A TREATY\n\nThe invalidity, termination or denunciation of a treaty, the withdrawal of a party\n\nfrom it, or the suspension of its operation, as a result of the application of the present\n\nConvention or of the provisions of the treaty, shall not in any way impair the duty of\n\nany State to fulfil any obligation embodied in the treaty to which it would be subject\n\nunder international law independently of the treaty.\n\nVol. 1155, l-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n1980 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unies - Recuell des Traites 343\n\nArticle 44. SEPARABILITY OF TREATY PROVISIONS\n\n1. A right of a party, provided for in a treaty or arising under article 56, to denounce,\n\nwithdraw from or suspend the operation of the treaty may be exercised only\n\nwith respect to the whole treaty unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties\n\notherwise agree.\n\n2. A ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending\n\nthe operation of a treaty recognized in the present Convention may be invoked only\n\nwith respect to the whole treaty except as provided in the following paragraphs or in\n\narticle 60.\n\n3. If the ground relates solely to particular clauses, it may be invoked only with\n\nrespect to those clauses where:\n\n(a) The said clauses are separable from the remainder of the treaty with regard to\n\ntheir application;\n\n(b) It appears from the treaty or is otherwise established that acceptance of those\n\nclauses was not an essential basis of the consent of the other party or parties to\n\nbe bound by the treaty as a whole; and\n\n(c) Continued performance of the remainder of the treaty would not be unjust.\n\n4. In cases falling under articles 49 and 50 the State entitled to invoke the fraud\n\nor corruption may do so with respect either to the whole treaty or, subject to\n\nparagraph 3, to the particular clauses alone.\n\n5. In cases falling under articles 51, 52 and 53, no separation of the provisions\n\nof the treaty is permitted.\n\nArticle 45. Loss OF A RIGHT TO INVOKE A GROUND FOR INVALIDATING,\n\nTERMINATING, WITHDRAWING FROM OR SUSPENDING THE OPERATION OF A TREATY\n\nA State may no longer invoke a ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing\n\nfrom or suspending the operation of a treaty under articles 46 to 50 or articles\n\n60 and 62 if, after becoming aware of the facts:\n\n(a) It shall have expressly agreed that the treaty is valid or remains in force or continues\n\nin operation, as the case may be; or\n\n(b) It must by reason of its conduct be considered as having acquiesced in the validity\n\nof the treaty or in its maintenance in force or in operation, as the case may be.\n\nSECTION 2,INVALIDITY OF TREATIES\n\nArticle 46. PROVISIONS OF INTERNAL LA w REGARDING\n\nCOMPETENCE TO CONCLUDE TREATIES\n\n1. A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has\n\nbeen expressed in violation of a provision of its internal law regarding competence to\n\nconclude treaties as invalidating its consent unless that violation was manifest and\n\nconcerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance.\n\n2. A violation is manifest if it would be objectively evident to any State conducting\n\nitself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith.\n\nArticle 47. SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS ON AUTHORITY TO EXPRESS\n\nTHE CONSENT OF A ST A TE\n\nIf the authority of a representative to express the consent of a State to be bound\n\nby a particular treaty has been made subject to a specific restriction, his omission to\n\nVol. 1155, 1-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n344 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unles - Recueil des Traites 1980\n\nobserve that restriction may not be invoked as invalidating the consent expressed by\n\nhim unless the restriction was notified to the other negotiating States prior to his expressing\n\nsuch consent.\n\nArticle 48. ERROR\n\n1. A State may invoke an error in a treaty as invalidating its consent to be\n\nbound by the treaty if the error relates to a fact or situation which was assumed by\n\nthat State to exist at the time when the treaty was concluded and formed an essential\n\nbasis of its consent to be bound by the treaty.\n\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the State in question contributed by its own\n\nconduct to the error or if the circumstances were such as to put that State on notice of\n\na possible error.\n\n3. An error relating only to the wording of the text of a treaty does not affect\n\nits validity; article 79 then applies.\n\nArticle 49. FRAUD\n\nIf a State has been induced to conclude a treaty by the fraudulent conduct of\n\nanother negotiating State, the State may invoke the fraud as invalidating its consent\n\nto be bound by the treaty.\n\nArticle 50. CORRUPTION OF A REPRESENTATIVE OF A STATE\n\nIf the expression of a State's consent to be bound by a treaty has been procured\n\nthrough the corruption of its representative directly or indirectly by another\n\nnegotiating State, the State may invoke such corruption as invalidating its consent to\n\nbe bound by the treaty.\n\nArticle 51. COERCION OF A REPRESENTATIVE OF A STATE\n\nThe expression of a State's consent to be bound by a treaty which has been procured\n\nby the coercion of its representative through acts or threats directed against\n\nhim shall be without any legal effect.\n\nArticle 52. COERCION OF A STATE BY THE THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\n\nA treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force\n\nin violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the\n\nUnited Nations.\n\nArticle 53. TREATIES CONFLICTING WITH A PEREMPTORY NORM\n\nOF GENERAL INTERNATIONAL LAW (\"JUS COGENS\")\n\nA treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory\n\nnorm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a\n\nperemptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by\n\nthe international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation\n\nis permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international\n\nlaw having the same character.\n\nSECTION 3. TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF TREATIES\n\nArticle 54. TERMINATION OF OR WITHDRAWAL FROM A TREATY\n\nUNDER ITS PROVISIONS OR BY CONSENT OF THE PARTIES\n\nThe termination of a treaty or the withdrawal of a party may take place:\n\n(a) In conformity with the provisions of the treaty; or\n\nVol. l lSS, I-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n1980 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unles - Recueil des Traites 345\n\n(b) At any time by consent of all the parties after consultation with the other contracting\n\nStates.\n\nArticle 55. REDUCTION Of THE PARTIES TO A MULTILATERAL TREATY\n\nBELOW THE. NUMBER NECESSARY FOR ITS ENTRY INTO FORCE\n\nUnless the treaty otherwise provides, a multilateral treaty does not terminate by\n\nreason only of the fact that the number of the parties falls below the number\n\nnecessary for its entry into force.\n\nArticle 56. D.E:NUNCIATION OF OR WITHDRAWAL FROM A TREATY CONTAINING\n\nNO PROVISION REGARDING TERMINATION, DENUNCIATION OR WITHDRAWAL\n\n1. A treaty which contains no provision regarding its termination and which\n\ndoes not provide for denunciation or withdrawal is not subject to denunciation or\n\nwithdrawal unless:\n\n(a) It is established that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation\n\nor withdrawal; or\n\n(b) A right of denunciation or withdrawal may be implied by the nature of the treaty.\n\n2. A party shall give not less than twelve months' notice of its intention to denounce\n\nor withdraw from a treaty under paragraph I.\n\nArticle 57. SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF A TREATY UNDER\n\nITS PROVISIONS OR BY CONSENT OF THE PARTIES\n\nThe operation of a treaty in regard to all the parties or to a particular party may\n\nbe suspended:\n\n(a) In conformity with the provisions of the treaty; or\n\n(b) At any time by consent of all the parties after consultation with the other contracting\n\nStates.\n\nArticle 58. SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF A MULTILATERAL TREATY\n\nBY AGREEMENT BETWEEN CERTAIN OF THE PARTIES ONLY\n\n1. Two or more parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement to\n\nsuspend the operation of provisions of the treaty, temporarily and as between\n\nthemselves al.one, if:\n\n(a) The possibility of such a suspension is provided for by the treaty; or\n\n(b) The suspension in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:\n\n(i) Does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under the\n\ntreaty or the performance of their obligations;\n\n(ii) ls not incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\n2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph l(a) the treaty otherwise provides,\n\nthe parties in question shall notify the other parties of their intention to conclude the\n\nagreement and of those provisions of the treaty the operation of which they intend to\n\nsuspend.\n\nArticle 59. TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION\n\nOF A TREATY IMPLIED BY CONCLUSION OF A LATER TREATY\n\n1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a\n\nlater treaty relating to the same subject-matter and:\n\n(a) It appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended\n\nthat the matter should be governed by that treaty; or\n\nVol. !!55, l-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n346 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unies - Recueil des Traites 1980\n\n(b) The provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the\n\nearlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same\n\ntime.\n\n2. The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in operation if it appears\n\nfrom the later treaty or is otherwise established that such was the intention of\n\nthe parties.\n\nArticle 60. TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION\n\nOF A TREATY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ITS BREACH\n\n1. A material breach of a bilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles the other\n\nto invoke the breach as a ground for terminating the treaty or suspending its operation\n\nin whole or in part.\n\n2. A material breach of a multilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles:\n\n(a) The other parties by unanimous agreement to suspend the operation of the\n\ntreaty in whole or in part or to terminate it either:\n\n(i) In the relations between themselves and the defaulting State, or\n\n(ii) As between all the parties;\n\n(b) A party specially affected by the breach to invoke it as a ground for suspending\n\nthe operation of the treaty in whole or in part in the relations between itself and\n\nthe defaulting State;\n\n(c) Any party other than the defaulting State to invoke the breach as a ground for\n\nsuspending the operation of the treaty in whole or in part with respect to itself if\n\nthe treaty is of such a character that a material breach of its provisions by one\n\nparty radically changes the position of every party with respect to the further\n\nperformance of its obligations under the treaty.\n\n3. A material breach of a treaty, for the purposes of this article, consists in:\n\n(a) A repudiation of the treaty not sanctioned by the present Convention; or\n\n(b) The violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of the object or\n\npurpose of the treaty.\n\n4. The foregoing paragraphs are without prejudice to any provision in the\n\ntreaty applicable in the event of a breach.\n\n5. Paragraphs 1 to 3 do not apply to provisions relating to the protection of the\n\nhuman person contained in treaties of a humanitarian character, in particular to provisions\n\nprohibiting any form of reprisals against persons protected by such treaties.\n\nArticle 61. SUPERVENING IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMAt-.Cl:.\n\n1. A party may invoke the impossibility of performing a treaty as a ground for\n\nterminating or withdrawing from it if the impossibility results from the permanent\n\ndisappearance or destruction of an object indispensable for the execution of the treaty.\n\nIf the impossibility is temporary, it may be invoked only as a ground for suspending\n\nthe operation of the treaty.\n\n2. Impossibility of performance may not be invoked by a party as a ground for\n\nterminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty if the impossibility\n\nis the result of a breach by that party either of an obligation under the\n\ntreaty or of any other international obligation owed to any other party to the treaty.\n\nYol.1155, 1-18232\n\nAnnex 1\n\n1980 United Nations - Treaty Series • Nations Unies - Recueil des Traites 347\n\nArticle 62. FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES\n\n1.

In the case of a treaty which becomes void and terminates under article 64,\n\nthe termination of the treaty:\n\n(a) Releases the parties from any obligation further to perform the treaty;\n\n(b) Does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created\n\nthrough the execution of the treaty prior to its termination, provided that those\n\nrights, obligations or situations may thereafter be maintained only to the extent\n\nthat their maintenance is not in itself in conflict with the new peremptory norm\n\nof general international law.\n\nArticle 72. CoNSEQUE1'CES Of THE SUSPENSION\n\nOF THE OPERATION OF A TREATY\n\n1. Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwise agree, the\n\nsuspension of the operation of a treaty under its provisions or in accordance with the\n\npresent Convention:\n\n(a) Releases the parties between which the operation of the treaty is suspended\n\nfrom the obligation to perform the treaty in their mutual relations during the\n\nperiod of the suspension;\n\n(b) Does not otherwise affect the legal relations between the parties established by\n\nthe treaty.\n\n2.

Thus the security of the African\n\npeople, their land and property must be safeguarded to ensure\n\nstability, development and cooperation of African countries.\n\n(d) The security of each African country is inseparably linked to that\n\nof other African countries and the African continent as a whole.\n\n(e) The plight of African Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons\n\nconstitutes a scar on the conscience of African governments and\n\npeople.\n\n(f) Africa’s strategic and natural resources are the property of the\n\npeople of Africa and the leadership should exploit them for the\n\nAnnex 2\n\nCollection of Official Texts on African Borders from 1963 to 2012 | 45\n\ncommon good of the people of the continent, having due regard\n\nfor the need to restore, preserve and protect the environment.\n\n(g) Uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons as well\n\nas the problem of landmines constitutes a threat to peace and\n\nsecurity on the African continent.\n\n(h) Good governance including, accountability, transparency, the\n\nrule of law, elimination of corruption and unhindered exercise of\n\nindividual rights as enshrined in the African Charter on Human\n\nand People’s Rights and those of the Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights is a prerequisite for sustainable peace and security\n\nin Africa as well as a necessary condition for economic development,\n\ncooperation and integration.\n\n(i) A fundamental link exists between stability, human security,\n\ndevelopment and cooperation in a manner that each reinforces\n\nthe other.\n\n(j) Sustainable Stability in Africa demands the establishment and\n\nstrengthening of democratic structures and good governance\n\nbased on common tenets.\n\n(k) The rejection of unconstitutional changes of government in any\n\nAfrican country as a threat to order and stability in the African\n\ncontinent as a whole.\n\n(l) Respect and promotion of human rights, the rule of law and equitable\n\nsocial order as the foundation for national and continental\n\nstability.\n\n(m) The eradication of corruption, which undermines Africa’s quest\n\nfor socio-economic development and the achievement of sustainable\n\nstability on the continent.\n\n(n) No political organisation should be created on the basis of religious,\n\nsectarian, ethnic, regional or racial considerations. Political\n\nlife should be devoid of any extremism.\n\n(o) The conduct of electoral processes in a transparent and credible\n\nmanner and a concomitant obligation by the parties and candidates\n\nto abide by the outcome of such processes in order to\n\nenhance national and continental stability.\n\n(p) Development is about expanding human freedoms. The effort of\n\nMember States at achieving development is aimed at the maximum\n\nexpansion of the freedoms that people enjoy.\n\n(q) The freedoms that Africans seek and deserve, inter alia, include\n\nfreedom from hunger, freedom from disease, freedom from\n\nignorance and access to the basic necessities for enhancing the\n\nquality of life. These freedoms can best be achieved through\n\nexpansion of the economic space including the rapid creation of\n\nwealth.\n\nAnnex 2\n\n46 | From Barriers to Bridges\n\n(r) Economic development is a combined result of individual action.\n\nAfricans must be free to work and use their creative energies to\n\nimprove their well-being in their own countries. The state’s involvement\n\nin the activities of individual economic actors should\n\nbe supportive of individual initiatives.\n\n(s) Acknowledgement of the important role of the State in economic\n\ndevelopment not only in providing regulatory frameworks but\n\nalso through active cooperation with private sector, and civil\n\nsociety, including business associations and organisations as\n\npartners of development to promote economic growth, social\n\nand economic justice.\n\n(t) All priorities in economic policy-making shall be geared towards\n\neliminating poverty from the continent and generating rapid and\n\nsustainable development in the shortest possible time.\n\n(u) Cooperation and integration in Africa is key to the continent’s\n\nsocio-economic transformation and effective integration into the\n\nworld economy.\n\n(v) Harmonisation and strengthening of the Regional Economic\n\nCommunities (RECs) in key areas as an essential component of\n\nthe integration process, through the transfer of certain responsibilities\n\nas well as effective reporting and communication structure\n\ninvolving the RECs in continental initiatives.\n\n(w) Strong political commitment including the involvement of all\n\nstakeholders, the private sector, civil society, women and youth\n\nas a fundamental principle for the achievement of regional economic\n\nintegration and development.\n\n(x) Investment in Science and Technology as a fundamental input\n\ninto the development of all sectors and raising living standards.\n\nII.

Such programmes\n\nshould, through the harmonisation of criminal and penal\n\ncodes and effective information sharing system, promote, strengthen\n\nand foster joint strategies for the management and control of all forms\n\nof crimes within the region. The programme should incorporate a\n\nmechanism for annual performance assessment.
