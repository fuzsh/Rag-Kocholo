        "text": "Christopher Robert Evans is an American actor, film producer, and director. Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.\n\nHe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative Mike Capuano. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister, Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother named Scott Evans, who is also an actor, and a sister named Shana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.\n\nOn the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on Auf der Flucht - Die Jagd geht weiter (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in Sex oder stirb (1999) and Newcomers - Neue Freunde (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in Boston Public (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, Nicht noch ein Teenie-Film (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.\n\nAfter filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - Voll verheiratet (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, Voll gepunktet (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, Final Call - Wenn er auflegt, muss sie sterben (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, Final Call - Wenn er auflegt, muss sie sterben (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four (2005), 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.\n\nThe year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance. Nanny Diaries (2007), where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie Street Kings (2008), playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie Das Mädchen mit dem Diamantohrring (2008).\n\nCarl Lumbly is an actor respected for his steadfast talent, versatility and class.

He starred as 'Dick Hallorann,' the role originally played by Scatman Crothers. The gripping film was directed by Mike Flanagan from his own screenplay based upon King's best-selling novel.\n\nLumbly has reunited with Mike Flanagan in his highly anticipated upcoming horror miniseries for Netflix, \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" based on various works from Edgar Allan Poe. In his initial casting announcement for \"Usher,\" Flanagan tweeted: Rounding out our first wave, as Poe's legendary investigator C.

Produced by American Masters, \"Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool\" made its television debut nationwide on February 2020 on PBS, in honor of Black History Month.\n\nHis impressive feature credits include a role opposite Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. in \"Men of Honor,\" portraying the father of the first black diver in U.S. Navy history.

Like many immigrants, his parents stressed education and reading, as the gateway to respect, success and achievement. A self-described 'library geek to this day,' Lumbly worked in libraries to earn money and have ready access to the larger worlds of literature, world history and art, which inspired his early appreciation for literature. An English major in college, Lumbly's first love was writing. He worked as a journalist in Minneapolis, early on. Through a series of 'happy accidents,' he took a short break from writing and worked in a political -satire comedy theatre. After a couple of years, Lumbly moved to San Francisco intending to continue his work as a journalist for the Associated Press. Just two days after arriving, he came across a newspaper ad seeking \"two black actors for South African political plays.\" He went to the audition and met the other actor already cast -- an unknown Danny Glover. He landed the part and toured with Glover in productions of Athol Fugard's \"Sizwe Bansi is Dead\" and \"The Island.\"\n\nThe plays brought Lumbly to Los Angeles, where he signed with an agent, followed by a move to New York. He landed his first significant on-screen role in a movie-of-the-week, \"Cagney and Lacey,\" which turned into the hit series. More importantly, CBS cast the beautiful and talented actress, Vonetta McGee, as his wife on the show. They fell in love, married and had a beautiful son, Brandon and a beautiful life together. Lumbly starred as 'Detective Marcus Petrie' for the show's seven-year run.\n\nLumbly's versatility spans a range of characters, from his NAACP Image Award-nominated work in TNT's \"Buffalo Soldiers,\" produced by Danny Glover, to a wealthy, black entrepreneur in \"Oprah Winfrey Presents: The Wedding,\" starring opposite Halle Berry.

States the Huffington Post, \"Pops is portrayed with torrents of fury and flashes of gentleness by the marvelous Carl Lumbly. He is one of seven characters in Stephen Adly Guirgis's play, which won this year's Pulitzer Prize for drama, but he provides the fuel that energizes all.\"\n\nIn 2013, Lumbly starred Off-Broadway at Romulus Linney Courtyard Theatre in New York's Pershing Square Signature Center in \"stop. reset,\" directed by Regina Taylor. \"stop. reset.\" tells the story of 'Alex Ames' (Lumbly), the owner of Chicago's oldest African American book publishing company.\n\nHe starred in the Lorraine Hansberry Theatre's (LHT) 2012 production of British playwright Joe Penhall's comedy drama \"Blue/Orange\" in San Francisco.

Hugo has an older brother, Simon, and a younger sister, Anna, who both also live and work in Australia. During his early childhood, the Weaving family spent most of their time traveling between Nigeria, Great Britain, and Australia. This was due to the cross-country demands of his father's job in the computer industry. Later, during his teens, Hugo spent three years in England in the seventies attending Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School in Bristol. There, he showed early promise in theater productions and also excelled at history, achieving an A in his O-level examination. He arrived permanently in Australia in 1976 and finished his education at Knox Grammar School, Sydney. He graduated from NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art), a college well-known for other alumni such as Mel Gibson and Geoffrey Rush, in 1981. Since then, Hugo has had a steadily successful career in the film, television, and theater industries. However, he has illustrated that, as renowned as he is known for his film work, he feels most at home on stage and continually performs in Australian theater productions, usually with the Sydney Theater Company. With his success has also come extensive recognition. He has won numerous awards, including two Australian Film Institute Awards (AFI) for Best Actor in a Leading Role and three total nominations. The AFI is the Australian equivalent of an Academy Award, and Hugo won for his performances in Proof - Blindes Vertrauen (1991) and Das Interview (1998). He was also nominated for his performance in Priscilla - Königin der Wüste (1994). He garnered the Best Acting prize for Das Interview (1998) at the Montreal Film Festival in 1998 in addition to his AFI Award and, that same year, won the Australian Star of the Year. More recently, roles in films such as The Matrix trilogy as Agent Smith and The Lord of the Rings trilogy as Lord Elrond have considerably raised his international profile. His famous and irreplaceable role in The Matrix movies have made him one of the greatest sci-fi villains of the Twenty-first Century. With each new film, television, or theatrical role, Hugo continues to surpass his audience's expectations and remains one of the most versatile performers working today. He resides in Australia and has two children with partner Katrina Greenwood. Though Hugo and Katrina have never married, they've been a committed couple for over 25 years; while Hugo was quoted as saying marriage \"petrified\" him in the 1990s, by middle of the following decade he said he no longer felt that way, and that he and Katrina have toyed with the idea of marrying \"when we're really old\".\n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally, Toby Edward Heslewood Jones was born on September 7, 1966 in Hammersmith, London. His parents, Freddie Jones and Jennie Heslewood, are actors as well. Toby has two brothers: Rupert, a director, and Casper, a fellow actor. He studied Drama at the University of Manchester from 1986 to 1989, and at L'École Internationale de Théâtre in Paris under Jacques Lecoq in Paris from 1989 to 1991. Naturally, his career began on the stage (and continues there), but film and television roles came soon after his studies.\n\nToby made his film debut with a small role in Sally Potter's experimental take on Virginia Woolf's novel, Orlando (1992), starring Tilda Swinton. Other small film roles included the doorkeeper in Les Misérables (1998) and a memorable turn as the Royal Page in Auf immer und ewig (1998) with Drew Barrymore.\n\nRoles in the acclaimed Victoria & Albert (2001) and the Helen Mirren-starring Elizabeth I (2005) were balanced with film work, from his voice role as Dobby the House Elf in Harry Potter und die Kammer des Schreckens (2002) to supporting appearances in Der Duft von Lavendel (2004) (co-starring his father, Freddie), Wenn Träume fliegen lernen (2004) and Lady Henderson präsentiert (2005).\n\nHe continued stage work during this period, appearing on Broadway in The Play What I Wrote in 2003, a year after winning the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in the London production.\n\nKaltes Blut: Auf den Spuren von Truman Capote (2006), directed by Douglas McGrath and released in 2006, was Toby's first starring role. His acclaimed portrayal of Truman Capote remained mostly in the shadow of Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance of the author in 2005's Capote (2005).\n\nA steady stream of film roles followed with appearances in Der Mann, der die Welt veränderte (2006), Der bunte Schleier (2006), Nightwatching - Das Rembrandt-Komplott (2007), Der Nebel (2007), and Die Girls von St. Trinian (2007). Toby then appeared in three successive films that could have been commercial breakthroughs: kid-lit flop City of Ember - Flucht aus der Dunkelheit (2008), the Oscar-nominated Frost/Nixon (2008), and Oliver Stone's W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008).\n\nHe reprised the voice-role of Dobby in Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 1 (2010), appeared in the St. Trinian's sequel, as well as the Charles Darwin biopic Creation (2009) and Dustin Lance Black's post-Milk (2008) directorial outing, Virginia (2010). More Hollywood roles followed with appearances in The Rite - Das Ritual (2011), Your Highness - Schwerter, Joints und scharfe Bräute (2011), and his first big live-action breakthrough as Red Skull's biochemist Dr. Arnim Zola in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).\n\nEven before Toby was announced as Claudius Templesmith in the adaptation of the novel Die Tribute von Panem - The Hunger Games (2012), his star was on the rise after Captain America, with roles in three Oscar-nominated films: Dame, König, As, Spion (2011), My Week with Marilyn (2011), and Die Abenteuer von Tim und Struppi - Das Geheimnis der Einhorn (2011). Though chances are he will forever be known by many as Claudius, the announcer for The Hunger Games with the booming voice and penchant for ending his statements with the phrase, \"And may the odds be ever in your favor!\"\n\nToby followed up this massive success with his mesmerizing tour-de-force interpretations as a sensational multifarious \"chameleon\" of substantial acting mastery in films such as Red Lights (2012) for Buried - Lebend begraben (2010) director Rodrigo Cortés, Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), Die Tribute von Panem - Catching Fire (2013) reprising his role as Claudius Templesmith, Peter Strickland's Berberian Sound Studio (2012), Susanne Bier's Serena (2014) and Journey's End (2017). Among others, The Girl (2012), a BBC/HBO co-production in which he starred as Alfred Hitchcock, Titanic (2012), The Secret Agent (2016), Wayward Pines (2015), Zeugin der Anklage (2016) and Sherlock (2010) are also included in the brilliant performances of his exquisite TV work.\n\nToby lives in London with his family."
