        "text": "In the month of December these humanities focused podcasts delved into the system of democracy, philosophical inquiries, theatrical interventions, non-profits, and the conceptualization of difference.\n\nDemocratic Perspectives\n\nThe Democracy in Question? Podcast of Central European University and the Albert Hirschman Centre on Democracy in Geneva covers democratic issues globally analyzing the challenges facing democratic institutions in order to recognize the ways to preserve democratic practices around the world. CEU President and Rector Shalini Randeria explores these issues in the December episode, “Populism and Democracy’s Critcal Infrastructure.” This episode features Jan Werner Muller defining the role of populism and its relation to democracy. The connections between representation, nativism, and intermediary institutions are explored to identify this era of populism.\n\nBoston University Center for the Humanities podcast, the BUCH podcast, released a new episode titled, “Roya Hakakian on her book A Beginner’s Guide to America: For the Immigrant and the Curious”. In this episode Roya Hakakian describes her new book as creating a patchwork of experiences of refugees and immigrants to highlight how these groups are not viewed as individuals. She wanted to counter popular rhetoric that paints immigrants as a threat through representing their perspectives in an accessible way for non-immigrant readers and to encourage further dialogue.\n\nIn the December episode of the Ben Franklin’s World’s podcast titled, “American Jewish Historical Society, Jews in Early America” Gemma Birnbaum, the Executive Director, and Melanie Meyers, Director of Collections and Engagement, at the American Jewish Historical Society. The American Jewish Historical Society is the oldest ethnic and cultural archive in the United States; its mission is to document the history of Jewish people in the Americas. They detail the misconception that Jewish history within the Americas begins in the nineteenth century, but their archive contains information and artifacts that predates the founding of the United States.\n\nPhilosophical Approaches\n\nThe Humanities Now of the Humanities Center at Texas Tech released a new episode titled, “Dr. Sebastian Ramirez on the Importance of Philosophy to Anti-Racism”. Dr. Sebastian Ramirez, the Humanities Center 2021-2022 Post-Doctoral Fellow in the Humanities, discusses his primary research question addressing white supremacy that began as a result of the connections between capitalism and white supremacy that were represented throughout Trump’s political campaign. Drawing upon the work of W.E.B. DuBois, Ramirez notes how white privilege operates to further economic inequality.\n\nThe Cogut Institute for the Humanities at Brown University hosts the podcast Meeting Street: Conversations in the Humanities. In their December episode, “Happiness in Psychology and Philosophy,” Joachim Krueger, Professor of Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences, and Bernard Reginster, Professor of Philosophy, discuss the concept of happiness. Although there has been an increase in research surrounding the topic of happiness, the disciplines of psychology and philosophy have very different frameworks and methods in conducting research on the topic.\n\nTheatrical interventions\n\nTo honor the life of Sir Antony Sher this month the Folger Shakespeare Library of the Folger Institute broadcast an interview with the late actor on their Shakespeare Unlimited Podcast. In the episode, “Sir Antony Sher,” Sher shares how he has prepared for his roles and how this process was captured within his diaries. He details his preparation for King Lear and the stimulating and scary experience of performing Shakespearen plays.\n\nThe podcast of the Trinity Long Room Hub Arts and Humanities Research Institute of Trinity College Dublin’s podcast TLRH The Hublic Sphere released, “Creating Together: Before, During, and After the COVID-19 Pandemic” with Jenny Macdonald and Melody Chadamoyo about their work with the SoloSIRENs Collective. They discussed the importance of recognizing theater as more than the performance itself and forms of participation beyond being an audience member. Their collective works to create connections and they detail their need to transition to a virtual format as a result of the pandemic.\n\nNonprofits and Public Humanities\n\nHumanities Without Walls hosts the podcast PhD Futures Now based at the Humanities Research Institute at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The December episode,“Non-Profit Careers for Humanities PhDs,” features Dawn Opel, J.D., Ph.D., Director of Research & Strategic Initiatives, and General Counsel at Food Bank Council of Michigan. Opel details her educational background and how her academic pursuits led to her non-profit work. She asserts the collaborative academic research within graduate school prepares PhDs for the critical community work that is the basis of non-profit careers.\n\nThe College of the Humanities at the University of Utah produces the Humanities Radio podcast. The latest episode, “Utah AIDS Foundation Holiday Program” features Elizabeth Clement, associate professor of history, The Holiday Fund started in the 1980s to provide food and resources for people impacted by HIV/AIDS. Clement discusses how her public history project on the history of AIDS in Utah led her to get involved with the Utah AIDS Foundation Holiday Program. She notes the conservative stances of the state impacted AIDS treatment, but there are powerful stories from the medical field and the community of those who provided services for those diagnosed with AIDS and some of these are captured in oral histories. These community programs persevere and provide much needed resources.\n\nHighlighting Difference\n\nThe Being Human Podcast from the Humanities Center at the University of Pittsburgh released a December episode, “The Poetics of Difference: An interview with Mecca Jamilah Sullivan,” featuring Mecca Jamilah Sullivan, professor of English at Bryn Mawr College discussing her book, The Poetics of Difference: Queer Feminist Forms in the African Diaspora. Sullivan begins with a discussion of the concept of intersectionality to contextualize Black feminisms. In defining the poetics of difference she notes genre experimentation and destabilizing conventions as tools of representation and expression."
