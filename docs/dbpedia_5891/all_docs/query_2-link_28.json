        "text": "Harvey Fierstein, playwright\n\nAs soon as I started writing, other writers stopped wanting me acting in their shows – maybe they thought I was going to rewrite them. So I wrote the first play in Torch Song Trilogy for myself, and the next two to continue the life of those characters. The first play is a very naked examination of falling in love for the first time. The second features two couples, one gay, one straight; it's a statement that gay and straight relationships are exactly the same. The third play has characters who have evolved not because they wanted to, but because the outside world has crashed in.\n\nThey were not written for a straight audience: they are about people struggling with their sexuality, and heterosexuality is not struggled with. And yet it was the gay critics and gay culture that rejected the plays, while heterosexual audiences accepted them. It took me years to find someone to produce them. At first, we couldn't give tickets away; no one wanted to sit through a four-hour gay play. We were getting ready to close, and then two critics came: Rex Reed of the Daily News and Mel Gussow of the New York Times. They both published raves and all of a sudden we were a hit. We moved from the fringe to off-Broadway, where tickets were sold as fast as we could print them. I accepted an offer to move it to Broadway, but only because I didn't think it could exist on Broadway and I was ready to leave. I had my next play ready, and I was writing La Cage aux Folles. But the show lasted there another four years.\n\nI chose to absent myself from the London rehearsals to see what the director, Robert Ackerman, would come up with. His production was very like the original, except that New York and West End actors are very different. An English actor has no problem cutting somebody's bowels out with a sword, but has a lot of trouble yelling at their mother. Antony Sher was gorgeous in the show, but one of the notes I gave was about the confrontation scene in the third play. The mother is saying to her son: \"If I knew you were going to be queer I wouldn't have bothered giving birth to you.\" Isn't that the most horrible thing? But Tony and Miriam Karlin were holding hands. I said: \"Are you fucking kidding me? They should be holding knives to each other's throats.\" When I took over playing the role, I was awful: I didn't blend with the rest of the company – I was overdoing it. I'd been doing it so many years. I didn't want to do it any more.\n\nAntony Sher, actor\n\nI knew the play had been a hit in New York, but thankfully I didn't see that production. As soon as I read it, I fell in love with it.It's a remarkable piece of work: Fierstein takes the most exotic of creatures, a New York drag queen, and turns him into Everyman. It begins as a very gay play, but then the second act talks about straight relationships, and the third talks about parent-child relationships, so that by the end, the play has wrapped its arms around every single person in the audience.\n\nThe material was moving and fun, and the cast were a very happy group; I met Miriam Karlin, who was playing my mother, for the first time, and that became one of the great friendships of my life. My character, Arnold, and Miriam's have a fight about his gayness and his desire to adopt. Fierstein gives her very persuasive and passionate homophobic arguments, so the audience really go back and forth between each character. and I ended up being very proud of the kind of acting that I was doing. I'm not sure he greatly liked my performance. He took over when I left the London run: his was a real Broadway-sized, scenery-eating, audience-eating, giant performance – I can understand that he might have found mine a bit restrained."
