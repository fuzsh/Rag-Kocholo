        "text": "This is the second in a series of 8 newsletters about thinking and working differently—accompanying the web series The Making of Resignation. Thanks for reading!\n\n***\n\nFor you've watched HBO's Succession, you know the scene. Though even if you haven’t, I bet you’ve seen this one in real life:\n\nThe boss walks in.\n\nHe (‘course it’s a he; it’s Succession) tells his Minion,\n\n“Go make this crazy thing happen.”\n\nThe Minion says,\n\n“Uh… I don’t think that’s possible…”\n\nThe boss says,\n\n“F***ing do it, Greg, or I’ll feed your face to piranhas!”\n\nThe Minion exhales and says,\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe Minion then walks into the room of a worker lower on the totem pole.\n\nThe Minion says,\n\n“I need you to make this impossible thing happen.”\n\nThe Worker says,\n\n“Uh… but it's not... possible…”\n\nThe Minion insists:\n\n“Just… just do it!”\n\nThen the Minion walks away.\n\nThe Worker then works overtime to do the job, pulls it off in a barely-acceptable way, and now is ready to accept any recruiter’s cold INmail about another job.\n\nWe can’t push boundaries if we don’t push; but there’s a right and wrong way to do it with our teams.\n\nI’m a huge proponent of taking on ambitious, dare I say impossible, challenges.\n\nAnything that’s been done the same way for a long time is in danger of me saying, “this can be better.”\n\nI like it because impossible challenges force us to use lateral thinking. Great ideas can come out of forcing ourselves to do things that can't be accomplished by simply spending more hours doing the same.\n\nHowever, if we just lob impossible challenges at people and walk away, that’s called “being terrible,” not “being innovative.\n\nThis is the meta theme of today's webisode of The Making Of Resignation. If you missed it, yesterday I shared the opening episode of an 8-part web series about how we used new technology to make a TV show outside of Hollywood, using Star Wars-style virtual production techniques. For the next few workdays, I'll be sharing each episode along with innovation lessons from them—things we can all take away as teams even if you're not in the video/film business.\n\nThe first episode ended with a teaser for what was to come:\n\nAfter using storytelling to get a great team on board with our ambitious vision, we then had to execute something that felt impossible…\n\nThe only way to proceed in this kind of situation, I strongly believe, is for leaders to dig in and take on the “impossible” challenges together with the troops. No one should be treated like a Minion on Succession.\n\nSo as you’ll see, in Episode 2 below, my partners and I—the director, producers, and department heads—personally went in to collaborate with our team on finding the solutions to challenges rather than pushing them off. And when someone did need to come in for extra hours to figure something out, we made sure that we leaders were the ones to do it.\n\nThis is not to say that my team wasn’t frustrated with me at various points. I’ve still got plenty of room to grow and miles to go. But if there's one thing that motivates me, it's to not be Tom Wambsgans.\n\nWithout further ado, here’s Episode 2 of The Making of Resignation:\n\n***BTW, if you missed Episode 1, it's here.***\n\nStay tuned next week for Episode 3.\n\n— Shane\n\nP.S.
