        "text": "Grandiose Irish stage, film and television character player Max Adrian, a noted classical performer and musical comedy revue star with a highly distinctive voice and \"old school\" acting style, was born Guy Thornton Bor on November 1, 1903, in Kilkenny, County Kilkenny, Ireland. The son of Edward Norman Cavendish Bor and wife Mabel Lloyd Thornton, Max studied at the Portora Royal School and showed early interest in the performing arts. An intermission singer/dancer at a silent film theatre, he made his stage debut in the chorus in 1925 and proceeded to gain experience on the West End.\n\nFollowing extensive repertory experience, Adrian (who was occasionally billed as Max Cavendish) enjoyed his first transcontinental stage hit with \"First Episode\", which toured throughout England and later transferred to Broadway in 1934. He went on to find wide personal success with his roles in \"Troilus and Cressida\" and \"The Doctor's Dilemma\" toward the end of the decade. Joining the Old Vic company in 1939, he scored as \"The Dauphin\" in \"Saint Joan\", then continued supremely with John Gielgud's company at the Haymarket Theatre in the mid-1940s as \"Puck\" in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"Osric\" in \"Hamlet\" and \"Tattle\" in \"Love for Love\".\n\nA founding member of both the Royal Shakespeare Company and, much later, Laurence Olivier's National Theatre, Adrian earned widespread admiration for his work on the lighter side as a singer/comedian on the post-WWII musical revue stage. Many were produced by his long-time companion Laurier Lister (1907-1986). He also later performed eloquently, if outrageously, in one-man shows about George Bernard Shaw and the lesser successful \"Gilbert and Sullivan\".\n\nFollowing his revue success, the often-bespectacled actor traveled to America in 1956 to appear in Leonard Bernstein's operetta, \"Candide\", on Broadway. Adrian stayed and pursued a career working in such summer stock productions of \"Pygmalion\" as Alfred as Doolittle, \"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\" as \"Jourdain\", \"The Merchant of Venice\" as \"Shylock\", and \"The School for Scandal\" as \"Sir Peter Teazle\", but never established a strong footing. He returned to London in 1959 to appear in Noël Coward \"Look After Lulu!\", which later was taken to Broadway.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Adrian became a member of Peter Hall's nascent Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in Stratford-upon-Avon, wherein he appeared in \"As You Like It\", \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Troilus and Cressida\", as well as the non-Bard productions of \"The Duchess of Malfi\", \"The Devils\" and \"The Hollow Crown\". He also was a founding member of Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic from 1963, wherein he supported Peter O'Toole \"Hamlet\" as \"Polonius\". He also went on to appear in \"Saint Joan\", \"Uncle Vanya\", \"The Recruiting Officer\" and \"The Master Builder\".\n\nLess renowned for his work on film, Adrian's made his debut in 1934 with two films: The Primrose Path (1934) and Eight Cylinder Love (1934). Film highlights during this earlier period came with his roles in the historical pieces Kipps - Roman eines einfachen Menschen (1941) and Der Gouverneur von Pennsylvanien (1942) and as \"The Dauphin\" in Olivier's classical masterpiece, Heinrich V. (1944) (aka Henry V). Post-war films included lesser parts in Her Favourite Husband (1950), Unterwelt (1951) and Die Geschichten des Mr. Pickwick (1952). In later years, he showed some minor flash in Die Todeskarten des Dr. Schreck (1965) and Anruf für einen Toten (1967), and capped his cinematic career as a favorite actor of visionary director Ken Russell and his mesmerizingly bizarre films Tschaikowsky - Genie und Wahnsinn (1971), Boyfriend (Ihr Liebhaber) (1971) and Die Teufel (1971). He fared much better on TV with several Shakespearean and other classical roles, notably as a delightful \"Fagin\" in \"Oliver Twist\", impressive Benjamin Disraeli in \"Victoria Regina\", and as composer \"Fredrick Delius\" in \"Song of Summer\".\n\nDying of a heart attack in 1973, the prolific stage actor, survived by his partner, was paid tribute by such luminaries as Laurence Olivier, Alec Guinness and revue co-star Joyce Grenfell.\n\nEmmy Award winner Ted Allen is host of the hit prime-time competition series Chopped - Die Küchenmeister (2007) on the Food Network, and a frequent contributor to Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate (2009). He was a judge on the first four seasons of Bravo's Top Chef (2006) and Food Network's Iron Chef America: The Series (2004) and was the food and wine specialist on the groundbreaking Bravo series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy (2003). He is the author of \"The Food You Want to Eat: 100 Smart, Simple Recipes\" (Clarkson-Potter), a collection of vibrant, all-natural dishes, and will publish a second cookbook for Clarkson in spring 2012. He also co-wrote the New York Times Best Seller \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy: The Fab Five's Guide to Looking Better, Cooking Better, Dressing Better, Behaving Better, and Living Better\".\n\nSince 1997, Ted has been a contributing editor to Esquire magazine, where he writes about food, wine, style and everything else the American man needs to know. He was a finalist for a National Magazine Award for his Esquire feature on the little-known phenomenon of male breast cancer. Ted also writes for such publications as Bon Appetit, Epicurious and Food Network Magazine. Before joining Esquire, Ted was a senior editor and restaurant critic at Chicago magazine. Ted holds an M.A. in journalism from New York University, with an advanced certificate in the school's Science and Environmental Reporting Program, and a B.A. in psychology from Purdue University. He lives in Brooklyn with his longtime partner, Barry Rice.\n\nThe most internationally acclaimed Spanish filmmaker since Luis Buñuel was born in a small town (Calzada de Calatrava) in the impoverished Spanish region of La Mancha. He arrived in Madrid in 1968, and survived by selling used items in the flea-market called El Rastro. Almodóvar couldn't study filmmaking because he didn't have the money to afford it. Besides, the filmmaking schools were closed in early 70s by Franco's government. Instead, he found a job in the Spanish phone company and saved his salary to buy a Super 8 camera. From 1972 to 1978, he devoted himself to make short films with the help of of his friends. The \"premieres\" of those early films were famous in the rapidly growing world of the Spanish counter-culture. In few years, Almodóvar became a star of \"La Movida\", the pop cultural movement of late 70s Madrid. His first feature film, Pepi, Luci, Bom und der Rest der Bande (1980), was made in 16 mm and blown-up to 35 mm for public release. In 1987, he and his brother Agustín Almodóvar established their own production company: El Deseo, S. A. The \"Almodóvar phenomenon\" has reached all over the world, making his films very popular in many countries.\n\nAmstell was born on 29 November 1979 and was raised in Gants Hill, London.
