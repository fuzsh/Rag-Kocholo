        "text": "MIDDLEPOST By Antony Sher. Illustrated. 383 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $19.95.\n\nThis novel, written by the South African-born London actor Antony Sher and illustrated with five of his excellent line drawings, tells the story of Smous (his name means peddler in Afrikaans), a Lithuanian Jew in his 30's, who journeys to Cape Town in 1901, and thence into the interior of South Africa. Smous is in search of a new and better life, which he believes he will find with relatives who live in a town called Calvinia. Before reaching Calvinia, however, Smous stops in a small frontier settlement, and, for a variety of reasons - the chief of which seems to be that he has no common language with anyone there - remains in Middlepost for most of the book.\n\nLanguage is an important issue here because many of the characters do not share one, or, like Smous, will not learn a new one at all. The Babel conceit makes its metaphorical point quite clearly in the South African context, but it also makes for some narrative clumsiness. In his first novel, Mr. Sher uses the language problem as one device, among others, to provide history, both real and fictional - much of it standard immigrant travail - and to fit bits of local lore and custom into the story. People harangue one another in monologues comprehensible only to the reader.\n\nFurther, when actual dialogue does show up, it is often histrionic and extravagant, in a style reminiscent of commedia dell'arte. Here is one British civil servant addressing another on the subject of Smous' arrival in Cape Town (remember, the year is 1901, not 1750): ''Here I am, ready and able for duty, eager only to discover that neither you nor your faithful coolie runner saw fit to exaggerate when coining the following summons - 'A matter, Mister Polchard, of the gravest urgency and import!' ''\n\nSmous himself is a sort of antihero. In flashbacks, Mr. Sher fills us in on his unpromising and indolent childhood and adolescence. As a man, Smous is incurious, inert, more done to than doing. For the purposes of the plot, he acts as a foil to the bizarre cast of characters Mr. Sher gathers around the peddler: Hottentot whoremongers, a Bushman servant who is more like a slave, a Shakespeare-spouting Xhosa, a murderous Boer, a homosexual British officer and on and on. But turning a novel on such a character carries the danger - quite real here - of making the reader ask, ''So what?'' Smous is a schnook. And his journey to Calvinia turns out not to be ''The Pilgrim's Progress.''\n\nBy contrast, Naoksa, his female Bushman companion, is quite engaging, even if it is in the cute-primitive style of the film ''The Gods Must Be Crazy.'' She has a sweetness and delicacy of spirit about her, spouts all sorts of interesting Bushman wisdom in her own Bushman language, uses her Bushman know-how to help Smous survive the desert through which they trek together, and, even more than Smous, is puzzled by the mad and violent behavior of the white, black and brown people they encounter.\n\nViolence and cruelty suffuse ''Middlepost,'' as, one might argue, they do South Africa. There is rape, torture, a severed head, a servant first deafened and then blinded by his master, a donkey stabbed with a knitting needle, women treated and spoken of throughout with extraordinary violence and loathing. Strangely, it is in the cruel and violent episodes - even the gratuitous ones, those thrust upon the story - that Mr. Sher seems most at home. His prose becomes urgent and vigorous.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
