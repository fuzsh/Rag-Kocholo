He has written several novels and a couple memoirs, but this is his first play. I.D. concerns a piece of South African history. On Sept. 6,1966, South African Prime Minister Hendrick Verwoerd was stabbed to death in Parliament by messenger Demetrios Tsafendas. Sher, who grew up in Cape Town, will play the assassin to Marius Weyers' Verwoerd. Nancy Meckler directs.\n\nAntony Sher's numerous theatrical credits also include his breakthrough roles in John Paul George Ringo and Bert and Mike Leigh's Goose Pimples. His Richard III put him on the map as a leading actor of his generation and led to a book about his experiences playing the evil king. Other roles include The Glad Hand, Prayer for My Daughter, Cloud Nine, King Lear, Moliere, Tartuffe, Maydays, Red Noses, The Merchant of Venice, The Revenger's Tragedy, Hello and Goodbye, Singer, Tamburlaine the Great, Travesties, True West, The Trial, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, Uncle Vanya and Titus Andronicus. He has spent two decades with the Royal Shakespeare Company."
