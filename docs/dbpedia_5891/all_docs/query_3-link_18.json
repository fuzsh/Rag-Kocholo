        "text": "STRATFORD-UPON-AVON, England — “What does a black man think has happened since South Africa had democratic elections in 1994? What does a white man think?”\n\nJohn Kani, one of South Africa’s most celebrated actors, posed the questions rhetorically, with characteristic gravel-voiced resonance, while Antony Sher, another celebrated actor born in South Africa, looked on.\n\nThe subject: Mr. Kani’s new play, “Kunene and the King,” which opened at the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Swan Theater on April 3.\n\nIn “Kunene,” directed by Janice Honeyman, Mr. Kani, 76, and Mr. Sher, 69, reincarnate the black/white divide under apartheid that dominated their youth.\n\nMr. Kani, who grew up in a township outside the city of Port Elizabeth, began to act in 1965 with a group that included Athol Fugard and Winston Ntshona. The three men began working on material together and wrote “Sizwe Banzi Is Dead” and “The Island,” a pair of one-act plays that helped bring the realities of apartheid to the world; it won Mr. Kani and Mr. Ntshona a joint best actor Tony Award in New York in 1975.\n\nWhen they returned to South Africa, they were arrested and placed in solitary confinement for several weeks. Ten years later Mr. Kani lost an eye (he wears a prosthetic one) after a beating by the police. He continued to write, and played South Africa’s first black Othello in a contentious 1987 production.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
