        "text": "About the Program\n\nIn recognition of ASG Founding Co-Chairman Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft’s dedication to the Aspen Strategy Group and his legacy of distinguished public service, the Aspen Strategy Group launched the Brent Scowcroft Award Fellowship program in 2003. The program is designed to prepare a new generation of foreign policy practitioners to take a leading role in our increasingly complex world. Scowcroft Fellows have the unique opportunity to experience first-hand how today’s preeminent politicians, leaders, and thinkers set aside differences and exchange ideas and insights for open and cooperative dialogue. Through immersion in the planning and execution of high-level discussions on foreign policy challenges, Scowcroft Fellows learn the critical place of track II initiatives in the setting of American foreign policy, as well as the skills required to execute conferences and communicate effectively with national security leaders.\n\nScowcroft Fellows typically join the ASG team for a period of 6 months, during which time they are encouraged to develop practical skills and build knowledge in the field of foreign policy and national security while having the opportunity to establish a rapport with members of the group. Given a great deal of responsibility and an environment in which to thrive, Scowcroft Fellows constitute an integral part of the ASG.\n\nTo learn more about General Scowcroft’s legacy and what he means to the ASG, please read the Group’s tribute to him here.\n\nCurrent Fellows\n\nMathilda Silbiger\n\nMathilda joins the Aspen Strategy Group as a recent graduate of Brown University, where she concentrated in International and Public Affairs on the Policy and Governance track.
