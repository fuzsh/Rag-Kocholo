        "text": "Hmmm!\n\nYesterday I posted some photos of the recent snowfall here on the Saanich peninsula in BC. Anyone who accesses this blog directly will have been able to view them as expected.\n\nI am extremely fortunate in that there are also a decent number of good folk out there who subscribe to these meanderings and thus receive the latest updates routinely by email. The digest that was sent out automatically yesterday – however – for some reason contained no content at all (I send myself a copy just to ensure that all is working smoothly and I too was the recipient of an empty message).\n\nI am sending this post to check that all is in fact well – and I offer my apologies to anyone who sat scratching their heads after yesterday’s episode, wondering what the heck was going on.\n\nThis also gives me a chance to post a couple of further photos taken this morning after yet another night of snow. I am just waiting for the flakes to stop falling so that I can go out and clear our drive (once again!).\n\nI should also take this opportunity to correct an egregious error in yesterday’s post. The Girl pointed out – in the strongest possible terms – that I made myself look like an idiot my miss-spelling ‘tuke‘. It is – of course – ‘tuque‘… or ‘touque‘… or ‘toque‘…\n\n…but definitely not ‘tuke‘!\n\nSorry!\n\nIn my last post I promised further and better snow images – should the Arctic Outflow oblige by providing the requisite white stuff as it threatened to do. Yesterday evening it duly delivered. Herewith the evidence:\n\nThe inclement weather produced by the outflow led to a number of record low temperatures across the province, a notion which – given that large tracts of Canada are already notorious for bitterly cold winters – should cause the mind to boggle somewhat. Fortunately the worst of these records were set in parts of British Columbia to which right minded folk do not venture, should they be able at all to avoid so doing. Here in Victoria we reached a mere -5C yesterday – though the wind chill factor dropped that to a much less balmy -13C.\n\nThe Girl and I went for a swift walk around our neighbourhood yesterday and that gave me an opportunity to try out what has already become a favourite amongst her Christmas gifts to me – this fetching and most excellent tuke (for non-Canadians a tuke is a beanie!). This thing is awesomely warm which is clearly achieved by the appliance of some wonder of science or other… or possibly of magic. Either way it is a life (and ear) saver when the temperatures dip below -10C.\n\n…a white(ish) Christmas!\n\nWell – on the night of Christmas Eve there was fairly widespread snowfall here in western Canada. Naturally it wasn’t that widespread here at the southern end of Vancouver Island – because it usually isn’t. We did – however – wake on Christmas morning to enough of a dusting that we could officially declare it a White Christmas (though possible not the one of which Bing was dreaming!).\n\nNo need to be disappointed though. We are apparently trapped on the edge of yet another Arctic Outflow (I do love this modern weather terminology, which appears to come to us courtesy of the worlds of film or TV drama). It is so much more dramatic than simply saying ‘cold weather’. Anyways – this Arctic Outflow will doubtless dump a bunch more snow on us over the next week at some point and when it does I will take bigger and better (and much more dramatic!) snow pictures for your delectation and edification.\n\nIn a fit of supreme prescience I popped down to Sidney Tires (or ‘tyres’ should you prefer UK spelling) on the night before Christmas Eve and had them pop on our snow tires (or ‘tyres’ should you… etc, etc) – so we feel well prepared for anything that Mother Nature might care to throw at us.\n\nThat – and the fact that we intend remaining steadfastly indoors in the lovely warm over the coming days, rather than venturing out into the Arctic… well – that’s quite enough of that!\n\nHoping that all gentle readers continue to enjoy their Christmas (and/or other) holidays – and are getting in some serious relaxation.\n\n…Not so sure about the ‘jolly’ though!…\n\nWho would have thought when I was writing this last year:\n\n“There is no getting away from the fact that this is a Christmas unlike any that we have known. In fact, unless one is old enough to remember the Second World War it is highly unlikely that such a level of disruption to the normal cycle of celebration will have been experienced before. None the less, we will persevere – because that is what we do. And come next year – when much has returned to a state considerably closer to the ‘old normal’ – we may find it difficult to recall just how weird this one was.”\n\n…that a year down the line I could easily have found myself writing exactly the same thing!\n\nFunny old world – ain’t it?\n\nStill…\n\n…to friends, acquaintances and gentle readers…\n\n…from the Kickass Canada Girl and the Imperceptible Immigrant…\n\nwe wish you a safe and peaceful Christmas and a Happy Hogmany!\n\nChristmas piccies…!\n\nOne of the dubious ‘pleasures’ of ‘getting on a bit’ – and in particular if one takes a diuretic (for hypertension or suchlike) – is that it is much harder to sleep through the night. The call of nature is loud, clear and impossible to ignore.\n\nThus it was that I was up at 4:00am this morning, availing myself of the facilities!\n\nI had just got back to bed and was drifting off into much appreciated slumber when – all of a sudden – I heard through the quiet of the night a rapidly growing bass rumble. I felt the bed move under me as the crescendo ended in a loud-ish thump and all manner of things on walls and in cupboards rattled vigorously. Then all was at once quiet again.\n\nIn my sleep be-fuddled state two thoughts made it though to my consciousness. The first was that a truck had hit the front of the house; unlikely because it was the middle of the night and we live in a place where trucks are not wont to go. The second thought was that there had been an earthquake!\n\nNow – one’s first response to such an eventuality is meant to be to leap from one’s bed and to take shelter underneath some well-reinforced structure. My first thought was to grab my iThing and to look up ‘earthquake‘ on Google. There it was – within 30 seconds of the thing occurring – an entry much like that at the top of this jotting.\n\n“Goodness me…” – thought I – “that’s jolly efficient!”\n\nI guess I really should do some more work on my priorities.\n\nIt has been more than six years now since we moved to the part of the Pacific Rim that forms the North Cascadian subduction zone – one of the well-known hot-spots for tremors that make up this part of the ‘Ring of Fire’. I figured that at some point I would experience a quake – even if it were a small one like this (for those who wish to know the details this one registered 3.6 on the Richter scale, with the epicentre some 10 miles beneath Galliano Island – about 15 miles north-west of us here. To The Girl – who is, naturally, an old hand at such things – it was hardly worth waking up for. To me it was an experience…\n\n…which – having had – I wouldn’t mind not having again!\n\nBy a strange co-incidence this quake occurred on the same night that a very different (metaphorical!) quake shook the folks back in good old Blighty! I am referring, of course, to the Liberals defeating the Tory candidate in the North Shropshire by-election… which seat had been held by the Tories for more than two hundred years! As a judgement on the performance, record, behaviour and character of Prime Minister Johnson I find it hugely encouraging that the electorate has finally spoken with such eloquence and clarity.\n\nLet us have much more of the same, say I…\n\nIt is, arguably, a little bit sad that if I look back over the years that I have been churning out entries for this journal, a regular subject of the December offerings has been just how busy everything has been, how tired we are and how much we are looking forward to some quiet downtime over the Christmas break.\n\nI didn’t actually look back to the archive of any previous December’s postings before making that statement. I didn’t have to. I just know that it is true!\n\nThe reason that it is a little bit sad is because The Girl and I are notionally retired and should thus probably have time on our hands rather than finding things a bit of a grind. Let’s face it – we are clearly not tuckered out because of our wild round of pre-Christmas socialising. The pandemic has seen to that!\n\nOh well!\n\nFor me the term at College has just finished, the final exam has been sat and marked, term projects have been submitted and assessed and I am just in the process of wrapping things up and recording grades and suchlike. At the point at which in days of yore I might have been enjoying a little post-term social relaxation I am instead contemplating the next term (what here in Canada is pessimistically – if realistically – called the Winter term). The course that I was scheduled to teach has – for the second year running – been heavily under-subscribed (wonderful to be so popular… not!). My Chair has offered me a different course; one which I have not taught before and which would – once again – require that I mug up afresh on another curriculum and set of practices.\n\nAm I getting too old for this sort of thing? Feels as though I might be.\n\nThe Girl (who is of course but a youngster) is also finding work something of a grind and – though she has been able these past two years to work almost exclusively from home – there are threats from her volunteer service that everyone might be dragged back into the office for the New Year.\n\nThe Omicron variant may, of course, have a considerable say in how things actually pan out for either or for both of us. How will it all end up? In truth – nobody knows!\n\nSo my message to good and gentle readers out there is this: Take good care of yourselves, stay safe and don’t take any foolish risks (in particular not for misguided ideological reasons)…\n\nAs Bette Davis didn’t quite say in ‘All About Eve’ – “Buckle up – it’s going to be a bumpy ride“…\n\nEver since arriving in Canada (more than six years ago now) I have – twice a week – taken part in a fitness class for those over 55 years of age. I do not do so because I enjoy this particular form of exercise but because I am determined to keep everything going for as long as possible. If that means doing some work – so be it.\n\nThe majority of of the group are ladies, with whom – naturally – I now have reasonably good relationships. We often go for a coffee after the class, to the delightfully named “Fickle Fig” farm shop on the outskirts of Sidney. We sit outside around a huge table – for the (by now) usual COVID protection reasons.\n\nSometimes we are not alone. Sometimes the wildlife wants to join in – as with this cheeky chappie!\n\nHe – or she – doesn’t seem to care for coffee but does quite like the pastries (which, of course, I can’t eat).\n\nHe – or she – cared not a jot that I was taking pictures of him/her!\n\nAntony Sher\n\n1949 – 2021\n\nRIP\n\nIt is, sadly, that time of year when those who are elderly or infirm – or who have been fighting against illness or disease – are perhaps at their most vulnerable. It should come as no surprise that amongst the number of those who pass at this time there will inevitably be found great men and women whose loss – though no more profound than those less known – may touch a greater number of those of us who remain.\n\nIt is but a few days since Stephen Sondheim was mourned in these jottings – and of course in many other fora. Now comes news of the passing of the great Shakespearean actor – Antony Sher. Sher was born and brought up in South Africa in the 1950s and 60s, before fleeing to London to train to be an actor. His record as a great Shakespearean – with the Royal Shakespeare Company and with other prestigious companies – is detailed splendidly in many other places and one could do worse than to start with Wikipedia.\n\nSher also wrote a number of books and his memoir of the year in which he played Richard III at the RSC – a role that cemented his reputation – was published in 1985 as “The Year of the King“.\n\nSher was married to Greg Doran – the Artistic Director of the RSC. I had the very great fortune to meet both men whilst working at my penultimate school. Doran had – as I recall – been invited to judge one of the School’s many competitions and Antony Sher accompanied him. At the dinner that inevitably follows such events I found myself sitting beside the latter for a while. I had just read his autobiography – “Beside Myself” – in which he wrote movingly about his relationship with his late father. At that point (in the early 2000s) my father had also recently died and we had a conversation about the effect that this has on one. He was entirely gracious and thoughtful and I was most grateful that he had been prepared to be so open with someone that he had not previously met.\n\nRegular patrons of these marginalia will doubtless greet as old friends those posts that recur – in some form or another – on a regular basis. Into this distinguished category fall the annual November reports of our most recent outing on the Cariboo Express, courtesy of the engineer in chief – Barney Bentall.\n\nWe enjoy these evenings (in support of the Sidney Lions Foodbank) so much that we are quick to purchase tickets each year as soon as they become available. This we did as per usual last year (2020).\n\nOn that occasion, of course, the concert did not take place – for reasons that require no further elucidation. The dates were once postponed – and then postponed again. This was deeply sad but necessary. The run-in to Christmas just wasn’t the same without this jolly evening out, but we were not prepared to take any risks that might endanger our (or other people’s) health and well-being.\n\nThe final postponement of the event resulted in us being offered the chance to let the tickets spill over to become valid for this year’s equivalent pageant – and fortunately this time the precautions were deemed to be adequate (vaccine passports and photo IDs thoroughly checked) and we were able once again to gather at the Mary Winspear Centre in Sidney – well be-masked and well-behaved – for a most welcome live performance.\n\nIt really was quite moving to suddenly find oneself once again in the proximity of real live musicians and singers – and, of course, in a real audience. An object lesson – I think – in the need that we all (many of us anyway!) have to experience live performance… something else of which we clearly need a regular shot! A good evening was quite clearly had by all!\n\nAt this juncture we do not have anything much else of a similar nature in the calendar and – with new COVID variants looming – who knows how things will pan out or when we will next get to sit in a theatre watching a live show.\n\nWe are (said he through gritted teeth) determined to remain optimistic…\n\nStephen Sondheim\n\n1930 – 2021\n\nRIP\n\nSad news yesterday of the passing of the last of the four iconic creators of what is almost certainly the best musical ever conceived – West Side Story. Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Laurents were all in their late thirties at the point at which the show was created in the late 1950s, whereas Sondheim was the baby of the quartet at just 26 years of age.\n\nI was slightly (though entirely unreasonably) shocked to learn that Sondheim was 91. Time really has flown! West Side Story has been with us for pretty much all of my life and – though I have not myself been involved in a production – I have been close to those who have on numerous occasions.\n\nSondheim is also, of course, renowned for many other groundbreaking productions in music theatre in addition to West Side Story (Company, Follies, Into the Woods, Sunday in the Park with George, A Little Night Music etc). Others far more qualified will write far better valedictions than can I; and I commend them to you.\n\nWay back in the mid 1980s I saw Sondheim give a most erudite platform at the National Theatre in London, to accompany the National’s production of Sunday in the Park with George. If ever I find myself musing that his work tends to be rather too cerebral (and clever!) and not to carry a sufficiently direct emotional charge I remind myself that he also wrote the immortal ‘Send in the Clowns‘.\n\n‘Nuff said. Respect!"
