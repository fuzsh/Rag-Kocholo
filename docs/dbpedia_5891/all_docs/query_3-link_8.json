        "text": "The cast and creative team for Kunene and the King met at The Fugard Theatre for the first time this week, as rehearsals began for the world premiere of John Kani's new play.\n\nKunene and the King features Antony Sher and John Kani as two very different men reflecting on life in South Africa since the first post-apartheid democratic elections 25 years ago. As a co-production with The Fugard Theatre, the play will run in Stratford-upon-Avon next month before transferring to Cape Town at the end of April.\n\nKunene and the King is a true UK-South African collaboration, rehearsing in Cape Town before opening in Stratford. Both John and Antony are South African, together with many of the show's creative team, including Director Janice Honeyman.\n\nTo mark the start of the production's journey, the theatre's owner Eric Abraham, hosted a dinner, with guests including the satirist and activist Pieter-Dirk Uys and our Artistic Director Gregory Doran.\n\nKunene and the King plays in the Swan Theatre from 21 March to 23 April 2019."
