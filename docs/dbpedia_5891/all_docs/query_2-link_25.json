        "text": "The broadcast, according to a \"Great Performances\" mailer, is set for April 24 at 10 PM ET; check local listings.\n\nPrimo, directed by Richard Wilson, features Antony Sher as Italian chemist and Holocaust survivor Primo Levi. The play is based on Levi's 1947 memoir that chronicles the time he spent in a concentration camp during the final year of World War II.\n\nPrimo was a hit at the National's Cottesloe Theatre in 2004, subsequently playing Cape Town, South Africa, before returning to London at the Hampstead Theatre. The production, starring Sher, opened on Broadway in July 2005.\n\nThe piece plays 90 intermissionless minutes and features Sher in plain clothes as a postwar Levi directly telling the audience of his horrific life in the Nazi death camp. Sher was the first person given permission by the Levi estate to adapt the late author's work, \"If This Is a Man,\" for the stage.\n\nThe creative team for Primo comprised Hildegard Bechtler (set and costume design), Paul Pyant (lighting design), Rich Walsh (sound design) and Jonathan Goldstein (music).\n\nAntony Sher received Olivier Awards for his performances in the London productions of Torch Song Trilogy and Stanley and an Evening Standard Award for his work in Richard III. His numerous theatrical credits also include roles in John Paul George Ringo and Bert, The Glad Hand, Prayer for My Daughter, Cloud Nine, Goosepimples, King Lear, Moliere, Tartuffe, Maydays, Red Noses, The Merchant of Venice, The Revenger's Tragedy, Hello and Goodbye, Singer, Tamburlaine the Great, Travesties, True West, The Trial, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, Uncle Vanya and Titus Andronicus.\n\nSher made his Broadway debut in 1997 in Stanley, earning a Tony Award nomination for his performance.\n\nFor more information visit www.pbs.org."
