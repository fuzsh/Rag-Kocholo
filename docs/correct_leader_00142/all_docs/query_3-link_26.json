He has what may be a last chance to save increasingly fragile peace moves begun with Maoists five years ago.\n\nHe also denied India played a crucial role in his appointment in August.\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that the tenure of Nepal's constituent assembly, which is supposed to write the new constitution, cannot be extended beyond the end of November.\n\nHowever, Dr Bhattarai suggested the assembly's term could be extended on the basis of what he described as the \"doctrine of necessity\".\n\n\"I have been given a timeframe of the end of November to complete the peace process and make the first draft of the constitution.\n\n\"I will do my best to meet that target,\" he told the BBC Nepali service."
