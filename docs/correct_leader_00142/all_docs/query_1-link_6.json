        "text": "Political and Internal Developments\n\nDr. Baburam Bhattarai has been Elected as the 35th Prime Minister of Nepal: The Constituent Assembly (CA) of Nepal, which has also been working as a legislature parliament elected the UCPN (Maoist) Vice Chairman Dr. Baburam Bhattarai as the 35th Prime Minister of Nepal.\n\nHe got elected to the top executive post of Nepal after defeating his rival, Nepali Congress Parliamentary Party leader Ram Chandra Poudel, in the election held at the parliament on August 28, 2011. Dr. Bhattarai bagged 340 votes while Poudel received 235 votes. Before the election, the major political parties had several bi-lateral and multi-lateral discussions in order to form a consensus government.\n\nThe Nepali Congress, during discussions, asked the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) to give in their weapons immediately and make ‘irreversible progress’ on the peace process, primarily the integration and rehabilitation of combatants, first before they could be supported to lead a government. The Maoists asked for government leadership first, and promised to move on the peace process subsequently.\n\nThough there were 595 members in the Constituent Assembly, altogether 575 lawmakers participated in the voting. In addition to his party UCPN (Maoist) which has 237 lawmakers, Dr. Bhattarai was supported by the Samyukta Loktantrik Madhesi Morcha (SLMM)—an alliance of five Madhes-based parties with 66 lawmakers in the Parliament—and Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) fringe parties. However, Ram Chandra Poudel was supported by the Nepali Congress, Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist, and few other parties in the voting. Before supporting Dr. Bhattarai’s candidacy, the SLMM had signed a four-point deal with the UCPN (Maoist), according to which the first responsibility of the new government was towards completing the peace process and writing a new constitution. The both parties also agreed to revise the proposal forwarded by UCPN (Maoist) on August 25, 2011 stating that the issues that have not yet reached political consensus will be further clarified and revised; and all decisions on Maoist combatants will be made by the special committee as specified in the constitution.\n\nThe post of the Prime Minister had remained vacant after the erstwhile Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal tendered his resignation on August 14, 2011. Dr. Bhattarai is the fifth Communist Prime Minister of Nepal. Also, he is the second Prime Minister of the country from the Maoist party since the peace process began in 2006. Dr. Bhattarai served as Finance Minister for nine months under Pushpa Kamal Dahal government in 2008.\n\nIn the meantime, President Dr. Ram Baran Yadav administered the oath of office and secrecy to the newly elected Prime Minister Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, amid a ceremony at the President's Office in Sheetal Niwas in has been sworn-in on August 29, 2011. Dr. Bhattarai subsequently administered the office and secrecy to newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Bijay Kumar Gachhadar in the presence of President Dr. Yadav.\n\nAs per the agreement, the SLMM has been allocated 11 ministries, and the remaining 15 have are the share of the UCPN (Maoist). The Maoist party plans to give four of these ministries to other small parties, including the MPRF led by Upendra Yadav.\n\nHowever, Dr. Bhattarai is yet to come up with a cabinet. It is due to inability to settle the distribution of ministries among rival factions in the Maoist party, and also with coalition partner SLMM. Though there has been a tentative agreement between the UDMF and UCPN (Maoist) regarding the number of ministries to be shared between the two sides, they are yet to finalize the allocation of ministerial portfolios. There also seems to be a difference between the two sides regarding the number of deputy prime ministers in the cabinet. According to reports, there are at least five aspirants for the posts of deputy prime minister and that has put the prime minister in a difficult situation. The SLMM has stated that if the Maoist party appoints a Deputy Prime Minister, it would for its part send three more Deputy Prime Ministers including Hridayesh Tripathi, JP Gupta, and Mahendra Yadav.\n\nAlso, the Maoists were busy trying to resolve their own internal differences over cabinet formation. It is said that the major bone of contention in the UCPN (Maoist) is who it should nominate as Deputy Prime Minister from the party. According to reports, Vice President Mohan Baidya has floated the name of party Secretary CP Gajurel as Deputy Prime Minister who will also hold the Foreign Ministry portfolio, whereas General Secretary Ram Bahadur Thapa and Standing Committee member Netra Bikram Chand have argued that the position should be given to Vice-chairman Narayankaji Shrestha, who was Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister in the last cabinet led by Jhalanath Khanal. However, the party establishment seems to be in favour of making Posta Babadur Bogati as deputy prime minister. The party also to be undecided over the minister of finance. In the previous cabinet, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Mohan Baidya had taken four ministries each and Dr. Bhattarai was given three ministries.\n\nForeign Relations\n\nA Jumbo Chinese Delegation Visits Nepal: A high-level Chinese government delegation of five dozen members led by Zhou Yongkang, a member of Standing Committee of Political Bureau of Chinese Communist Party visited Nepal from August 16 to 18, 2011. According to reports, Zhou is one of the top ten leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. The 60-member delegation also includes three ministers and four assistant ministers.\n\nThis was the highest level Chinese government delegation to visit Nepal since December 2003. Earlier Jia Qinglin, also a Politburo Standing Committee member and chief of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) visited Nepal in December 2003. Jia is China’s top official responsible for Tibetan affairs, while Zhou is the head of the Central Political and Legislative Committee. Before that the then Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and President Jiang Zemin visited Nepal in 2001 and in 1996 respectively. Then onwards, no president or prime minister of China has visited Nepal so far. About one-and-a-half dozen senior army officials led by Chinese Army chief Chen Bingde had visited Nepal some four months ago. The visit was reported to have led to the appointment of a senior most security expert Yong Houlan as China’s ambassador to Nepal.\n\nDuring the visit, the delegation held separate meetings with President Ram Baran Yadav, caretaker Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Upendra Yadav,the UCPN (Maoist) chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress (NC) president Sushil Koirala and leaders of Madhesi parties. During the meetings with the leaders, the Chinese delegation not only expressed its concern over ongoing peace process and constitution drafting, but also hoped that the parties would be able to forge consensus by August 31, 2011 when the Constituent Assembly's term comes to a close and conclude the peace process successfully. Also, different memorandums of understanding of grant and loan assistance worth three billion rupees were signed during the visit of the Chinese delegation. The major agreements signed by the Chinese delegation include Economic and Technical Cooperation, Framework Agreement on Provision of Concessional Loan for Nepal, Letter of Exchange on Security Equipment for Nepal and Concessional Loan Agreement for Upper Tamakoshi 'A' Transmission Line Project. These agreements were signed in the presence of PM Khanal and Zhou. According to Lal Shankar Ghimire, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Finance, Government of Nepal, the Chinese aid include a grant of 150 million Chinese Yuan (Rs 1.69 billion) under economic and technical cooperation grant, 154 million Yuan (Rs 1.73 billion) for the extension of Upper Trishuli transmission line as soft loan and 6 million Yuan (Rs 67.4 million) for security equipments of Nepal Police.\n\nIn the meantime, the security had been beefed up around Tibetan settlement areas across the Nepali capital in order to avoid possible Tibetan protest against the visit of a high-level Chinese delegation. It is reported that at least eight Tibetan were arrested by Nepal Police from Kathmandu on August 15, 2011, a day before the Chinese delegation’s arrival. Initially the local Nepali officials called upon the Voluntary Co-ordinator of Tibetan Welfare Office, Thinlay Lama to ensure that there would be no forms of protest from the Tibetan community during the visit.\n\nRelations with India\n\nNew Indian Envoy Arrives in Nepal: New Indian Ambassador to Nepal Jayanta Prasad, who arrived in Kathmandu on August 25, 2011, has submitted his credentials to President Dr Ram Baran Yadav and formally assumed office on August 26, 2011. Upon his arrival at the Tribhuvan International Airport, Prasad said India gives high priority to its relations with Nepal. “There is no bilateral relationship for India of such multi-faceted nature. Our leaders attach the highest importance to this relationship,” Prasad told media persons. \"Our progress and prosperity are intertwined. India and Nepal today share the same challenges, of peace, of stability, of national integration, and of bringing the fruits of development to their peoples,\" he said, adding, \"Nepal's success in meeting these challenges will be, equally, India's success.\" On his priorities in Nepal, the new Ambassador Prasad said, “It shall be my constant endeavour to do whatever I can to nurture a strong, productive and mutually beneficial relationship between our two countries.”\n\nPrasad, 58, a career diplomat, was special secretary at India's Ministry of External Affairs before being appointed ambassador to Nepal. He had also served as Indian ambassador to Afghanistan and Algeria. He is Indian Foreign Service's 1976 batch. He has been appointed as Indian Ambassador to Nepal after his predecessor Rakesh Sood, the former Indian ambassador had left Nepal two weeks ago after completing his three-year tenure in Kathmandu."
