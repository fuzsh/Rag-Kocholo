        "text": "On August 29, 2011, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao sent a congratulatory message to Baburam Bhattarai on his taking office as Nepalese Prime Minister.\n\n\"China and Nepal are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and waters and the friendship between the two peoples has a long history,\" Wen said in the congratulatory message. No matter how international and domestic situation changed, bilateral relations have witnessed healthy development since the two countries established diplomatic ties more than half a century ago. Bilateral ties are good enough to serve as an excellent example of how two countries of different size could treat each other as equals, coexist peacefully and carry out mutually beneficial cooperation, said Wen. The Chinese government and people cherish China-Nepal friendship and always view and develop bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, Wen said. Wen expressed the hope that the two sides will work together to further deepen good-neighborly friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Nepal, and to push forward the long-term and steady development of their comprehensive cooperative partnership."
