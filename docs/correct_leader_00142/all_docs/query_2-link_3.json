        "text": "Political leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai has registered a new party with the Election Commission. His new party has been named Nepal Samajbadi Party.\n\nDr Bhattarai, a former Prime Minister and Maoist leader, recently broke away from the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal.\n\n\"Nepal Samajbadi Party has been registered after amending the statute of the Samabeshi Loktantrik Party earlier registered with the EC. Now, the party has got legal status,\" said party leader Ramesh Pokharel, who is close to Dr Bhattarai.\n\nThe newly registered party has proposed the 'eye' as its election symbol. Party's first meeting would conclude its leadership, he said. \"Party meeting is taking place in a day or two. It will conclude party leadership and office bearers.\""
