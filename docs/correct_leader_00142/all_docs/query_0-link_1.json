        "text": "Baburam Bhattarai (born June 18, 1954, Belbas, Nepal) is a Nepali Marxist scholar, politician, and former guerrilla leader who served as prime minister of Nepal from August 2011 to March 2013.\n\nBhattarai was raised in a small remote village in the vicinity of Gurkha (Gorkha) in central Nepal. His family was poor, but he was an excellent student and was able to attend college in India on scholarship through the Colombo Plan (economic development forum for South and Southeast Asia). Bhattarai received a bachelor’s degree in architecture from Punjab University in Chandigarh in 1977 and a master’s degree in planning at the School of Planning and Architecture in New Delhi in 1979. He then earned a Ph.D. in regional development planning from Jawaharlal Nehru University (also in New Delhi) in 1986; his doctoral thesis was published in 2003 as The Nature of Underdevelopment and Regional Structure of Nepal: A Marxist Analysis.\n\nBhattarai became involved with Nepali antimonarchy politics while he was a student in India, and he joined a pro-Maoist faction of the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) in 1981. He became politically active in Nepal after returning to the country in 1986 and gained respect for his intellectual achievements. Bhattarai rose to a leadership position in the CPN (Unity Centre) faction that had been established in 1990, and in 1994 he joined with Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), who had formed a splinter party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), or CPN (M). Bhattarai again attained a high-ranking office in the party and had become its top ideologue by the end of the decade.\n\nIn 1996 the CPN (M) launched what became a decadelong insurgency against the monarchy, and the Nepali government responded by outlawing the party. Bhattarai, Prachanda, and other insurgents went underground and operated clandestinely for several years. Peace negotiations between the Maoists and the government began in the early 21st century, Bhattarai emerging as the leading insurgent spokesman in 2003. In early 2005, however, Bhattarai and Prachanda disagreed on strategy, and Bhattarai spent several months under virtual house arrest before being reinstated by midyear. Bhattarai was instrumental in the negotiations between the insurgents and the government that led to peace in 2006 and, in 2008, to the end of the Nepali monarchy and the establishment of a republic in the country.\n\nIn April 2008 Bhattarai won a seat in the elections for a new national legislature, and the CPN (M)—which in 2009 changed its name to the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), or UCPN (M)—gained the largest share of seats in the chamber (though not a majority). Prachanda became prime minister of a coalition government in August and named Bhattarai as finance minister. The government lasted only nine months, however, with Prachanda resigning in May 2009 and Bhattarai leaving office as well. In August 2011, following two short-lived governments headed by prime ministers from the opposition CPN (Unified Marxist-Leninist), Bhattarai was elected prime minister by the parliament.\n\nAs with his predecessors, he faced the major challenges of finishing the drafting and ratification of a new constitution, determining how to reintegrate into the Nepali military or civilian life thousands of former Maoist rebel fighters who were living in supervised camps, and reviving a stagnant economy. Some 1,400 former fighters were inducted into the military in 2012, thus concluding the peace process. No headway was made on the new constitution, however. In May 2012 the assembly was dissolved, and the members of Bhattarai’s government resigned. He stayed on as a caretaker until he stepped down in March 2013 and was succeeded by Khil Raj Regmi, chief justice of the country’s Supreme Court.\n\nIn 2015 Bhattarai left the UCPN (M), and the following year he founded a new leftist party, Naya Shakti Nepal (New Force Nepal). In 2019 he oversaw the party’s merger with the Federal Socialist Forum Nepal, resulting in the formation of the Samajbadi (Socialist) Party Nepal."
