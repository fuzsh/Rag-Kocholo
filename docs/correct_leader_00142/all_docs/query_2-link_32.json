        "text": "KATHMANDU, NOV 29 –\n\nIn a bid to ensure a healthy, green urban environment in the Kathmandu Valley, Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai on Wednesday initiated the Green Kathmandu campaign by planting a Jamun (Black plum) sapling along the Koteshwor-Lokanthali road.\n\nIn the presence of high-level government officials, including the chief secretary, ministers and police personnel, members of the government-led campaign planted 545 plants.\n\nThe saplings included species of Jamun, Karbir, Rajbriksha, Dhupi, Tejpat and Kamini and were planted in open spaces in the centre of the road section beginning from Koteshwor in Kathmandu to Suryabinayak in Bhaktapur.\n\nInaugurating the campaign, Bhattarai said that in the present context of building a New Nepal, it is equally important to improve the greenery of the city to control rapid urbanisation and desertification. However, the government’s road expansion drive has chopped down many tall trees that lined the city streets. The latest campaign is an attempt to replenish greenery and improve the deteriorating urban environment.\n\n“Maintaining and improving a green and clean environment is not possible through just government efforts. It is equally important for each citizen to become aware and active in planting trees in their homes and open spaces,” said Bhattarai.\n\nAs part of the campaign, around 1,500 trees will be planted along the 6.8 km road section and along the footpaths. Of the total estimated budget of Rs 2.5 million for the campaign, the Bhaktapur Municipality, Kathmandu Metropolitan City and Madhyapur Thimi Municipality invested Rs 600,000, Rs 200,000 and Rs 100,000 respectively. The remaining funds will be allocated by the government itself.\n\nAccording to Krishna Hari Banskota, secretary at the Prime Minister’s Office and the Council of Ministers, caretakers will be appointed to look after the saplings and they will be responsible for watering and gardening them. “Each sapling will be planted three metres apart,” said Banskota. Traffic police working in the area will also be responsible for looking after the trees once they are planted.\n\nBanskota further said that besides the government, various partners, including private organisations, trade unions and non-government organisations, are expected to participate in the greenery drive. “We want to make Kathmandu as beautiful and green as Indian cities like Dehradun and Delhi,” said Banskota.\n\nClick here for Original Post\n\nRAMESH PRASAD BHUSHAL\n\nKATHMANDU, Nov 20:The government is preparing to launch a green Kathmandu initiative in a couple of weeks with the planting of 500 trees along the Koteshwor-Suryabinayak road in a first phase.\n\nPrime Minister Dr Baburam Bhattarai had directed the government secretaries two weeks ago to start a long term initiative to make the capital green again following the felling of trees in the course of the still ongoing road widening drive.\n\nKrishna Hari Banskota, secretary at the PM´s office, said that the PM had directed a meeting of high-level officials to start the initiative as soon as possible, most likely in a couple of weeks.\n\nThe preparations for launching the green initiative are now proceeding rapidly. “We are very serious about this as the public has been complaining about the increasing dust pollution with the rapid cutting of trees during the road widening. So the PM´s office will coordinate while other ministries implement the initiative to turn Valley roads green,” said Banskota.\n\nSecretaries from the Ministries of Forests and Soil Conservation; Physical Planning and Works; and Urban Development and the commissioner of the Kathmandu Valley Town Development Authority had a meeting immediately after the meeting with the PM and decided to launch the initiative through coordination among the ministries and municipalities concerned.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation, it has already directed the district forest offices in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur to prepare 500 plants to be planted along the six-lane Koteshwor-Bhaktapur road.\n\nThe plants would be between 4 to 6 feet high during planting and they have all been readied at the Department of Forests. “We need to plant trees of that height as it´s very hard to take care of smaller saplings and the trees will be flowering to make the city not only green but also beautiful,” said a high-level official at the Ministry of Forests.\n\nAccording to Banskota, the next meeting of the secretaries and heads of municipalities will be organized within a couple of days to finalize the date for launching the initiative. The Department of Roads will take care of the trees as roads are its brief but the other ministries will help maintain the greenery.\n\n“We will also deploy caretakers for the trees planted and local communities will be mobilized to act as watchdogs to ensure that the trees grow properly,” Banskota added.\n\nAccording to the Department of Roads, 75 kilometers of road have been widened in the Valley to date since the campaign kicked off in September but the department said that there had been no plans for planting trees.\n\n“We need to have a long term plan to promote greenery in the Valley as it is slowly turning into a concrete jungle; the campaign will be robust and will continue in future also. It´s not a one-off tree-planting event,” said Banskota.\n\nClick here for Original Post\n\nSTEPHEN MIKESELL\n\nPrashanta Khanal wrote an excellent article in the The Kathmandu Post (Cities for People, Oct. 18). I will add that the direct costs of the automobile on society which Khanal outlines represent a small portion of the economic and social costs that will be incurred by the Baburam government’s construction of new bypasses, widened roads and flyways.\n\nMost autos and all the energy required to move them are imported and will incur an ever upward spiraling cost to Nepali society, particularly as the world´s petroleum reserves are declining as predicted more than half a century ago by M. King Hubbert, a geophysicist with Shell Oil Company. All societies that have committed themselves to automobile transport will be increasingly drained of their resources and leveraged of wealth of every kind. Hubbert predicted that with the beginning of the global decline, which he projected for c. 2010, a petroleum-based transport will invariably become nonviable by mid-century.\n\nIf you want to see Nepal’s future, look no further than the US, the petroleum-based culture par excellence. From being the world’s creditor, the US has put itself $16,190,905,174,000 into debt, most of that within the last decade (which increased another $2 billion by the time I finished writing this). This represents more than $51,000 debt for every US citizen. Even China, despite all its exports, has begun to experience negative balance of trade due to petroleum imports.\n\nAs another example of cost, on the same morning Khanal´s article appeared, a heart specialist interviewed on National Public Radio in the US said that the US spends billions of dollars on treatment of heart disease, the primary cause of which is Americans´ shift to the automobile. Similarly, a study of Pacific Islanders found direct correlation between the introduction of the automobile and rising rates of obesity and diabetes, life-style diseases now epidemic worldwide, but particularly among Asian populations. In Nepal, INGO’s are pushing for increased health resources to go to the “non-communicable diseases” (heart problems, diabetes, etc.), rather than focusing on the preventable lifestyle changes (auto culture, pre-processed unhealthy foods, soft drinks, etc.) that are bringing about this changing disease profile.\n\nPitfalls of auto transport\n\nThe growing middle class in Nepal, which perhaps more truthfully should be called “new petroleum consumers,” sees diabetes almost as a natural consequence of maturation. They applaud the construction of heart and cancer hospitals. The cardiac doctor on Public Radio said a simpler, healthier, less costly, and I´ll add, even time-saving solution is for people to get onto their feet and bicycles.\n\nMy wife, Jamuna Shrestha, who came out of Nepal’s middle class, used to tell me that she could not afford to ride a car. She even took a second job so she could afford her first car, which she insisted was necessary to get to this second job. I pointed out that for an average American worker, operation of a car requires two or more days of labor a week. What kind of saving is it when 25 percent of your time is consumed by the car? In addition, diabetes shortens a human life span by 15 years, which means the auto significantly reduces potentially productive and creative output over a lifetime.\n\nWith growing traffic congestion and time spent looking for parking, bicycling becomes faster than riding a car. As Khanal pointed out, and has been proven many times over in the US, road expansion only increases congestion. It is like a never ending process of hooking large pipes into small hoses, which then themselves back up and must be enlarged. Until you bulldoze and pave over much of your country in the manner that the US has done to 51,000,000 acres of farmland—enough roads to circle the earth 157 times.\n\nOver the course of the life of a car, just the time earning the money to pay the direct costs along with the transportation time approximately equals the time it would take to go the same distance by bike. And if the bike rider can avoid getting hit by a motorist (bike deaths are still only 10 percent of auto ones), she will receive 15 to 20 years extra lifespan—which is healthier and more vital to boot.\n\nIn Nepal most people with cars are not laborers, which means that villagers and urban workers must be the ones producing the goods exported for foreign exchange to buy the cars. Car drivers thus are necessarily transferring much of the direct cost of car ownership to non-car owners, adding greater social burden for the people who don’t drive.\n\nIt is thus ironic that Nepal’s prime minister, whose party claims it is not only fighting inequality, but also constantly sloganeers against feudalism, is promoting automobile transport. The primary burden of feudal society was the requirement of the serf to give up two or more days of labor to the lord. Today we have a similar petroleum serfdom of the car. Furthermore, Dr. Bhattarai always talks about his theories and practices as being scientific, and yet what kind of science ignores the laws of thermodynamics, the most basic precepts of the universe and life and culture on this planet?\n\nMy wife, after watching her relatives being knocked down one after the other by diabetes, has taken to daily walking 10 km to work or else riding 25 miles on the bicycle, and often she rides 80 to over 160 km in one day. She has gone down one dress size, and at sixty-four looks younger and enjoys more energy than car-encumbered teenagers in the Nepali expat community in Madison, Wisconsin. Nor does she have to waste money and time at the gym, the latest symbol of middle-class social status popping up in Nepal and another example of the strange avatars taken by the real social costs of widespread adoption of the automobile.\n\nOne last word on energy inefficiency, which is especially relevant in a world of declining petroleum reserves. Walking consumes three times less energy than a car, while the bicycle, which was described by the visionary astronomer Karl Sagan as the most efficient form of transport ever invented by humankind, will go over 450 kilometers on the same amount of energy that a car requires to move a passenger less than seven kilometers, most of which is lost to heat. And if that energy is fed by local organic peasant cultivation rather than American-style petroleum-based agriculture (also being promoted by Nepal’s government), then none of that transportation energy is imported and all is renewable.\n\nFinally, the smoothest riding, most elegant, and most expensive bicycle frames in the US are made out of bamboo by California-based Calfee Designs, with the addition of little more than human labor—there are ample supplies of both in Nepal. What can be a more beautiful status symbol for a socially and environmentally conscious person of Nepal’s middle class than whisking along on a domestically manufactured bamboo bike, that most of us bicyclists in the US can only dream about? Under a joint project undertaken by Cornell University and Calfee Designs, street children in Africa are being trained to build excellent bamboo bikes for villager and working-class use, providing an example for Nepal to become manufacturers of the world´s most efficient and beautiful transportation rather than producer of migrant laborers in the Gulf and beyond. Such an initiative is already appearing in Cambodia. In place of flyways to rush the sedentary middle class to heart and diabetes treatment centers, envision bicycle lanes for Nepal–produced, domestically fueled, health-giving transportation. Now that would be a real step along the road to independence and the application of “scientific socialism.”\n\nThe writer is an anthropologist who studies Nepali economy and politics.
