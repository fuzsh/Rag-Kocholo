        "text": "Synopsis\n\nFormer Prime Minister of Nepal Baburam Bhattarai feels that it is in India’s interests that Constitution of Nepal should be framed at earliest and made durable.\n\nHe once accused India of being an expansionist power. He had said that the Westminster form of democracy did not truly represent the will of the people. But today, former Prime Minister of Nepal Baburam Bhattarai feels that it is in India’s interests that the Constitution of Nepal should be framed at the earliest and made durable and the Westminster model improved upon can make the political system more inclusive. Bhattarai, a moderate among Nepal’s Maoist leaders, who met President Pranab Mukherjee, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, NSA AK Doval, tells Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury and Akshay Deshmane that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been more engaging with South Asian countries, including Nepal, than the previous government and it is in India’s interests not to allow the peace process to fail. Excerpts:\n\nWhat is your opinion about Prime Minister Narendra Modi?\n\nPrime Minister Modi has been different than the preceding government – the way he is leading it and the way he is engaging with South Asian nations including Nepal. In the last one year, Modi has shown deeper engagement with India’s neighbours and this is a positive development for South Asia and India-Nepal bilateral relations.\n\nNepal is a sovereign country. It should be looked at in equal terms, so those statements of Prime Minister Modi were taken very positively.\n\nWhat kind of political support are you seeking from India to end the political impasse in Nepal?\n\nI have not come here to seek India’s support. I wanted to acquaint myself with the political changes taking place in India and appraise the Indian leadership of the developments there. Framing of the constitution and success of the peace process is also in India’s interest. If the peace process fails, it will go against India’s interest. I wanted to update the leadership here on what is happening in Nepal, to seek the views of our friends in India.\n\nDo you think agitation in Nepal may transform into ‘Jana Andolan 3’?\n\nYes this protest movement against the government could be transformed into a huge agitation and take shape of Jana Andolan 3 to foil motives of the current leadership that is treating the constituent assembly as Parliament.\n\nThey are going against historical norms and standard international practice of utilising the constituent assembly in framing the constitution. The Maoist party has threatened a three-phase decisive agitation if the government does not reconvene talks and accept its conditions by the end of this week.\n\nWhat is the reason for the United Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist’s change in attitude towards India?\n\nMonopoly capital does not have any nationalism, you see. It tends to expand, go anywhere it can make super profit and exploits the local population – Whether it is Indian, Nepali, American.\n\nWe are against monopoly capital’s exploitation. We are still against a section of Indian monopoly capital where it exploits. But what has changed is, these things can be modified or corrected through diplomatic moves or the decision of our government when we are in power. So that situation has changed, not the exploitation.\n\nNepalese people are strong enough to resist any wrong manoeuvering, whether from within or outside. Nepal is basically a secular society, there is no going back on secularism in Nepal.\n\nWhat did you discuss with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal?\n\nWe had good exchange of ideas on promoting alternative politics. Politics has generally degenerated. There is a lot of corruption and politics has developed an anti-people character. So how can democracy be strengthened and good governance ensured? We have been raising these issues in Nepal and so we had an exchange of ideas.\n\nThis was our first meeting, but I think he is a common man’s chief minister. Aam Aadmi Chief Minister, that is my first impression.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n4 reasons why MFs are stocking up on CreditAccess Grameen and other microfinance lenders\n\nOnce declared dead, Nifty Next 50 is up 70%.
