        "text": "Former Prime Minister and Chairperson of Nepal Socialist Party, Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, has said the alliance with Nepali Congress was not only for election but for the country's prosperity.\n\nLeader Bhattarai said it while addressing a joint gathering of the cadres of the left-democratic alliance in Gorkha on Saturday. He reminded me, \"We came together against regression. It was imperative indeed.\"\n\nHe further said without collaboration between leftists and Nepali Congress, the country would not see durable peace, and the absence of durable peace results in elusive national unity. National unity is essential for a country's development and prosperity, Dr. Bhattarai argued.\n\nThe former prime minister also stated that collaboration with NC had long-term significance. \"Don't regard it only as an electoral alliance,\" he urged the participants, adding that it is the holiest alliance for the country's development.\n\n\"It was the matter that I could not get an election ticket from Gorkha. I was willing to hand over the election ticket which I became successful too,\" the former prime minister stressed.\n\nHe also asserted that leader Prachanda had come to Gorkha to make history.\n\n------"
