        "text": "January 2: A meeting of the UCPN-M Standing Committee concluded with few decisions on revision of responsibilities of some top party leaders, reports Nepal News. \"The meeting took a few decisions on the party's organisational set-up and work division of some leaders,\" Maoist spokesperson Dinanath Sharma told reporters after the meeting.\n\nThe chairman of UCPN-M Prachanda clarified that the party has not decided to take action disciplinary against Vice-chairman Baburam Bhattarai. Speaking at a programme in Kathmnadu, Prachanda said, \"The reports appearing in the media that our party has decided to take disciplinary action against Bhattarai are false. We have not taken any decision on this regard yet.\"\n\nJanuary 4: The UCPN-M sent a second missive strongly objecting to the Government request for transfer of UNMIN assets along with arms and ammunition of the Maoist combatants cantoned in seven different camps under UN supervision. The second Maoist letter comes after the contents of the Government letter sent on December 31, 2010, to the world body became public.\n\nJanuary 5: The Central Committee meeting of the UCPN-M failed to reconcile Chairman Prachanda and Vice Chairman Baburam Bhattarai. Bhattarai stuck to his stand on the immediate action plan, peace and constitution, organisational reshuffling and other issues, where as Prachandas new document stressed on peace and constitution, but Bhattarai termed it unclear and wrote a note of dissent.\n\nPrachanda said that the ruling parties as well as India are trying to scotch the peace and constitution writing processes. Speaking on the last day of the three-day CC meet, Prachanda said, \"NC, CPN-UML and foreign forces want to prolong the tenure of the caretaker Government even after May 28.\"\n\nJanuary 6: UCPN-M proposed for a different unit of the UN to take over the role of UNMIN after its term expires on January 15 as its efforts to convince the other parties and the UN to extend the UNMIN term failed.\n\nUCPN-M said that it can accept a domestic mechanism to replace UNMIN if other parties give continuity to the monitoring of both the NA and the Maoist PLA. In the three-party talks at the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction, UCPN-M Chairman Prachanda proposed the mechanism be assigned to replicate UNMINs core task  monitoring NA and PLA and their arms.\n\nJanuary 7: Chairman of the UCPN-M Prachanda and the vice-chairman Mohan Baidhya made a fresh call for a struggle to achieve the partys mission  national independence and Peoples Republic. On the other hand, Vice-Chairman Baburam Bhattarai proposed to tread the middle path between the two extremes  parliamentary system of NC, CPN-UML and other parties and peoples democratic system of UCPN-M.\n\nJanuary 10: UCPN-M is likely to remove its ANTUF President Salikram Jamarkattel for his malpractices and incompetence. The move is part of an internal power struggle that has led to the demand for reshuffling by the party's two Vice Chairmen Mohan Baidya and Babauram Bhattarai to remove powerful individuals close to the party chairman Prachanda from lucrative wings of the party. The Baidya and Bhattarai factions have threatened they will form a parallel trade union if Jamarkattel, who is close to Party Chairman Prachanda, is not removed.\n\nThe chairman of the UCPN-M Prachanda said that his party is prepared to hand over the command control of cantonments to the Prime Minister-led Special Committee overseeing the Maoist combatants before UNMIN scheduled departure on January 15. The three steps he suggested include organising a special ceremony to formally mark the transfer of the chain of command to the Special Committee, the regrouping of combatants into two different categories (those opting for integration and those opting for rehabilitation), and finalising the norms and modalities for integration.\n\nThe UCPN-M and CPN-UML forged a consensus to vote against the only Prime Ministerial candidate Ram Chandra Poudel if the latter's candidacy was not withdrawn, informed the UCPN-M vice chairman Narayan Kaji Shrestha.\n\nJanuary 11: The three major parties UCPN-M, NC CPN-UML have given a final shape to the taskforce they formed to forge consensus for a political mechanism to complete the task of army integration and advice the Government on various issues related to the peace process after UNMIN scheduled departure on January 15\n\nJanuary 16: The standing committee meeting of the UCPN-M decided to hold parleys with the parties for a Maoist-led consensus Government. President Ram Baran Yadav on January 15 asked the parties to decide on a consensus Government within a week. \"The party will stick to its previous decision to present Chairman Prachanda as the new Prime Minister (PM),\" said UCPN-M Spokesperson Dinanath Sharma after the meeting. Standing Committee member close to Vice-Chairman Baburam Bhattarai, Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, proposed Bhattarai as the leader of the parliamentary party and new PM.\n\nJanuary 17: Intra-party rivalries deepen within the UCPN-M as the Vice Chairman Baburam Bhattarai and his supporters boycotted the party cadres' training session held at Bhrikuti Mandap of Kathmandu after the party establishment barred him from airing his views. Seven other leaders, including party spokesperson Dinanath Sharma and Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who had signed the note of dissent along with Bhattarai, also boycotted the session. Party Secretary C. P. Gajurel later termed the incident 'a mishap'.\n\nThe chairman of the UCPN-M Prachanda suggested that the party would go for four preparations and four bases for the people's revolt to achieve the party's tactical line of people's federal republic. A cadre of the UCPN-M also claimed that Dahal was for expanding the number of YCL up to 500,000. He also claimed that the bases for revolt were ripe and preparations were a must.\n\nJanuary 18: The Supreme Court stayed the Government's move to arrest and prosecutes 21 cadres of the UCPN-M on murder charges during the insurgency period. A division bench of Justices Top Bahadur Magar and Mohan Prakash Sitaula issued the order. The bench directed, \"Not to arrest and detain the defendants and to maintain the status quo till the limitation of time of submitting written explanations from the defendants or till the expiry of limitation of time.\"\n\nThe chairman of UCPN-M Prachanda agreed to hand over the PLA camps to the Special Committee for Supervision, Integration and Rehabilitation of Maoist combatants on January 22. Prachanda set the date for the handover ceremony at Shaktikhor, during his meeting with the Prime Minister.\n\nPrachanda claimed that vice-chairman of UCPN-M Baburam Bhattarai misinterpreted the decision of the party's Central Committee (CC) regarding management of dissenting views within the party. The Standing Committee (SC) has decided to convene a meeting of the politburo and the CC both on January 19 and 20 respectively to discuss the tug-of-war between Prachanda and Bhattarai factions.\n\nJanuary 21: Vice-chairman of the UCPN-M Baburam Bhattarai wrote yet another 'note of dissent' at the party Central Committee (CC) meet, expressing reservations over the conclusion that he breached the party discipline. Leaders close to Bhattarai bloc lashed out at the party decision after a majority of Maoist central members said Bhattarai made a mistake and should apologise for that.\n\nJanuary 23: An unknown armed group shot dead a cadre belonging to the UCPN-M Bhojpura State Committee, identified as Rukshana Khatun (35), in Rautahat District.\n\nChairman of the UCPN-M Prachanda claimed that the country would get a consensus Government under his party leadership within five days. \"The chances of the Maoist-led consensus Government within five days are high. There is sufficient ground for this,\" the Maoist chief told media persons at a conference organised by Revolutionary Journalists' Union in Hetauda.\n\nJanuary 24: The inauguration of the Upper Tamakoshi Hydro Electricity Project got postponed due to the protest threat by Dolakha wing of the UCPN-M. The Dolakha District committee of UCPN-M had demanded that the organiser call off the programme in a press conference in Charikot, Dolakha. They had even threatened to obstruct the programe if the organiser went ahead with the programme. They alleged Government irregularities in organising the inauguration.\n\nJanuary 25: Cadres belonging to the UCPN-M abducted six activists of both NC and CPN-UML in Udayapur District. According to reports, UCPN-M cadres abducted NC activist Dik Bahadur Thapa (45), CPN-UML Lafa village committee chairman Kamal Rai (28), CPN-UML activists Parsuram Thapa (30), Kesar Rai(16), Karna Bahadur Rai (25) and his father Chunuklal Rai. The abduction followed the beating of Dhan Bahadaur Rai at the wedding ceremony of Ram Bahadur Rai, a local.\n\nJanuary 30: The chairman of the UCPN-M Prachanda claimed that the new Government would not be formed even by February 6, 2011. He claimed that other parties were hatching conspiracies, despite Maoists efforts to form the new Government on time. \"Some parties are trying to foil our efforts by convincing their lawmakers to cast invalid votes,\" he alleged.\n\nStating that his party would continue its struggle until peoples rights have been ensured, vice-chairman of the UCPN-M, Baburam Bhattarai, warned other political parties not to hope for his party surrender. He claimed that parties had been plotting to prevent the single largest party from leading the next Government.\n\nFebruary 1: 10 students of Mahendra Higher Secondary School in Gorkha District were injured in an attack by the YCL. UCPN-M Gorkha constituency-1 in-charge Sakar, sub-in-charge Nischal, YCL Gorkha chairman Ramesh Pokhrel were present when the students were assaulted.

At a program organized by the Reporters Club in Kathmandu, Gurung said that Maoists will only support the Government but will not be a part if that UML does not keep its vows.\n\nThe UCPN-M chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda refuted the reports that the Cabinet could not take shape on February 6 owing to differences between CPN-UML and UCPN-M over sharing powerful portfolios. After a meeting between the two parties at the UML parliamentary party office in Kathmandu, Prachanda claimed that his party has not staked claim to any particular ministries, and made it clear that his party is not going to make power-sharing an issue.\n\nFebruary 8: The UCPN-M and the CPN-UML agreed to offer a \"common explanation\" of the seven-point deal before the formation of the Cabinet.\n\nFebruary 9: A group of about 10 discharged combatants of the PLA ransacked the Dhagadhi-based office of the UNHCR in Kailali District.

In the meeting, Dahal is known to have proposed Krishna Bahadur Mahara as the leader of the Maoist team in the cabinet. PM Khanal also communicated to chairman Dahal that his party, the CPN-UML, would retain eight ministries including defence and water resources, a source at Prime Ministers Office revealed. However, the MJF is also learnt to demand the energy ministry in case it decides to join the Government.

He also called upon all the factory workers affiliated to the Maoist party to make \"final preparations\" for people's revolt with all their power and might.

Those most responsible for drafting the constitution including the major parties, chairmen of the Constituent Assembly and Constitutional Committee are not serious about drafting the constitution on time, he added.

Stating that all parties must accept the deal, PM Khanal said that proper consultation with other parties and UCPN-M has not been done on the issue of who gets the Home Ministry. \"Security is Government's top priority at present.

The remaining 35 days for the promulgation of the new constitution is more than enough.

In such a case, we will lead the movement.\" Pun, nonetheless, said promulgating the statute by May 28 is very much possible, provided the parties forge consensus.

Shrestha remarked that without the PLA integration, the peace process will not complete. \"Concluding the peace process by integrating the combatants is the first priority. Promulgation of a new constitution comes second,\" he said, adding, the Maoists were for an honourable integration of the PLA. Saying that his party is not standing in the way of integration, he argued, \"These status quoists don't want to see the combatants that fought for the people's right and republic turned into the state army.\"\n\nDuring his meeting with French Ambassador to Nepal Jean-Charles Demarquis, Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal said the integration model for former Maoist combatants was being discussed at an advanced stage. \"There are encouraging signs from the UCPN-M regarding the peace and constitution writing processes.

Senior Maoist leader Dev Gurung later said that party vice-chairman Mohan Baidya, who had tabled a separate proposal in the CC meet vigorously advocating the revolutionary path, filed a note of dissent against Dahal's proposal. Gurung further said that the party's CC meet also concluded that there's no alternative left but to go for the second extension of the Constituent Assembly's term since the May 28 deadline for promulgation of the new constitution is not likely to be met. He, however, said that the party is in favor of an integrated draft of the new constitution by May 28. The vice chairman Baburam Bhattarai faction backed Dahal's document.\n\nThe major three parties - UCPN-M, NC and CPN-UML - have agreed to speed up the constitution-drafting process.

Maoists raised the demand for CA and initiated the peace process and we cannot see the CA and the peace process aborted, said Dahal.

We have also joined the democratic politics. Do not doubt in it,\" Pun said. Hinting at the approval of democratic line for peace and statute by the recent Maoist Central Committee, Pun, also a former PLA combatant said the party has decided to move forward as per the demand of time and age.

Emerging from the meeting, UCPN-M vice-chairman Narayan Kaji Shrestha said, \"The meeting concluded that there is no alternative left but to extend Constituent Assembly's term. But the duration will be fixed after consultations with other political parties.\"\n\nPrime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal said the constitution drafting process can move ahead smoothly only after the peace process is taken to a logical conclusion. Stating that the coalition partner UCPN-M's role is crucial to ensure successful conclusion of the peace process, he said without the active participation and involvement of the Maoist party that task is next to impossible.

Dahal said such are plotting to dissolve the assembly as they are alarmed by the possibility of a constitution dominated by Maoist agendas. He said there is no alternative to extending the CA's term to draft a 'people's constitution' and that the Maoist party would fight till last minute to make sure that the constitution is written from the CA. He, however, did not clarify for how long the CA's term would be extended.

The labour union leaders had formed three parallel bodies few days ago.\n\nUCPN-M vice chairman Baburam Bhattarai said the CA term extension will be futile without a clearly designed package deal among the three largest parties and Madhesh-based parties regarding the formation of a national unity government and statute drafting process, reports Himalayan Times.

They were brought to the camp for treatment, as they were injured in the incident,\" said Sangram Thapa, 'secretary' of the PLA first division camp. Police also said five youths had sustained minor injuries.

Sharma Oli said that the plot to kill UCPN-M Vice Chairman Baburam Bhattarai by his own party cadre was the latest example of violent nature within the Maoists.

Most of these cases were registered during the insurgency. We have been asked to find the status of the cases pending in various courts,\" an official said. This is not the first time that the Maoist leadership has tried to get their party workers off the book. In October 2008, the Maoist-led Government withdrew 349 criminal cases against its cadres, according to official records. In February 2011, the Attorney General Yub Raj Sangraula went on record saying he would oppose any request from the Government for the withdrawal of court cases.\n\nThe UCPN-M politburo member Nawaraj Subedi said the country may grapple with serious crisis if the tenure of the CA is not extended, according to Himalayan Times. He said counter revolutionaries are now making ploy to not prolong the tenure of the CA.\n\nPrime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal asked the UCPN-M to come up with a concrete proposal on integration of the cantoned combatants at the earliest. Khanal stated that integration and adjustment of the Maoist combatants is a must for taking the ongoing peace process into a logical end and requested the Maoists to float integration proposal without further delay. PM Khanal said that it would be impossible to proceed with the constitution-drafting and peace process if no prior agreement on PLA integration is forged among the major parties, and said UPCN-M has major say in this regard. He also asked all the parties, including the main opposition, the NC, to support the amendment proposal of the Interim Constitution for extending the current deadline of the CA by one more year that the Khanal''s government tabled at the Parliament Secretariat last week. He mentioned that it would be impossible to prepare new statute by May 28, saying that nothing as such can be achieved in less than two weeks.\n\nMay 18: NC rejected the Maoist proposal of forming a separate security force, including PLA fighters, and prepared its own document, which will be handed over to the UCPN-M said NC sources. \"Since the Maoist idea does not comply with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, it is not acceptable to us,\" said NC General Secretary Krishna Prasad Sitaula. NC has its own formula of managing Maoist fighters and has floated it as a pre-condition for extension of Constituent Assembly term.\n\nThe UCPN-M has decided to submit a \"more acceptable proposal\" for their Army integration that would incorporate the suggestions forwarded by Nepal Army. \"We will soon come up with a next alternative. We are inclined to accept the modality suggested by Nepal Army with some changes,\" said an unnamed Maoist leader, adding, that the upcoming standing committee of the party would finalise a proposal.\n\nMay 19: The (UCPN-M) has decided to adopt the Army integration proposal floated by the NA. The Standing Committee meeting of the party decided to accept the NA's proposal on the integration of its combatants - a key part of the peace process. \"Nepal Army's proposal on integration is suitable,\" said Maoist Standing Committee member Barsa Man Pun after the meeting, adding, \"This proposal can be taken as the base of consensus.\" The Maoists has also hinted that it could depict flexibility on the number of combatants to be integrated. Earlier, the NA had submitted a proposal to Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal suggesting that a joint security body be constituted incorporating 50 percent former Maoist combatants and fifty percent personnel of all three security agencies- Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force.\n\nDefense Minister Bishnu Poudel urged the UCPN-M to hand over all weapons possessed by the party's cantoned PLA combatants at the earliest. Poudel said the PLAs can no longer keep the weapons with them, adding that \"the cantoned combatants and their weapons will not be useful for any sort of battles.\" He also asked the party to surrender all illegal weapons in its possession, if any. According to him, the peace process would remain as it is unless the UCPN-M decides to hand over all weapons before agreeing on any integration model. In another context, Poudel also accused the coalition partner, the Maoist, of not being serious towards completing the ongoing peace process by May 28 and unveiling the new statute.\n\nMay 20: Minister for Home Affairs Krishna Bahadur Mahara said that politically motivated cases registered against the (UCPN-M) cadres during the insurgency period would be withdrawn. Mahara said withdrawal of such cases will not breach the Comprehensive Peace Accord. \"However, political consensus is a must for the withdrawal of such cases,\" Mahara conceded. There are more than 300 cases filed throughout the nation against the Maoists cadres. Asked whether the government would drop the case against Maoists lawmaker Balkrisha Dhungel, Mahara said Government will withdraw only politically motivated cases. Dhungel has been implicated in a murder of one Ujjwal Prasad Shrestha in Okhaldunga District seven years ago during the insurgency. The Supreme Court (SC) had slapped a life sentence on Dhungel, in addition to seizure of his property in September 2010.\n\nMinister Mahara said there are several cases, many of them politically prejudiced, against UCPN-M leaders and cadres filed during the conflict, adds Nepal News. \"I am the Home Minister, but there are cases even against me,\" he noted. He maintained that cases of criminal will not be withdrawn.\n\nA day after UCPN-M Standing Committee decided to accept the modality proposed by Nepal Army on integration of PLA combatants, the General Staff meeting of PLA on May 20 put its stamp of approval to the party's decision,. PLA Chief Nanda Kishore Pun, his deputy Chandra Parkash Khanal and commanders of the seven divisions of the PLA concluded that the party had made a \"correct decision\" on May 19. \"There was a unanimous response for the decision taken by the party,\" PLA spokesperson Khanal said, adding, \"We expressed commitment to support the implementation of the decision.\"\n\nUCPN-Maoist vice chairman Narayan Kaji Shrestha hinted that his party might reconsider its stance on integrating 10,000 combatants into the state security agencies, Nepal News reports. \"We have said up to 10,000 [can be integrated]. But, we are ready to talk on that. If they agree for more than 7,000 then we will go for integration. We are still flexible on that,\" Shrestha said. On May 19, the Maoist standing committee proposed to integrate (at least) 10,000 combatants. He also said his party would maintain flexibility in state restructuring and federalism to make sure that the constitution is written at the earliest, but made it clear that the party would not be ready to change its stance on form of governance. In another context, Shrestha clarified that the seven-point agreement between his party and the CPN-UML will not be annulled as demanded by the Nepali Congress. He maintained that the agreement was meant to facilitate the constitution-drafting and defend the sovereignty of the nation. \"However, if the NC wishes to join the government we can have another agreement,\" he added.\n\nThe sub-committee under the (CC) agreed not to include the provision of compulsory military training to citizens above 18 years of age in the new constitution, according to Nepal News. A meeting of the sub-committee formed to settle disputed issues in constitution drafting on May 20 reached a decision to this effect. Talking to the media, coordinator of the sub-committee and UCPN-M chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda informed that they have agreed not to include the provision of compulsory military training in the new constitution. Before this, the Maoists had taken an adamant stance on including this provision of compulsory military training to the population of above 18 years in the new constitution. A meeting of the sub-committee on May 19 decided to name the new constitution as 'The Constitution of Nepal'. The sub-committee is yet to resolve 21 more disputed seen in reports submitted by various thematic committees of CC and which includes the governance system, restructuring of the state and electoral system.\n\nMay 21: Three coalition partners decided to put forth common proposal to take the peace process to a logical conclusion.

Therefore, we decided to take action against him,\" said party secretary C. P. Gajurel.\n\nThe chiefs of the largest three political parties in the ruling coalition have prepared a proposal for army integration and constitution drafting,. A meeting, among Prime Minister and t (CPN-UML) chairman, Jhala Nath Khanal, (UCPN-M) chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda and MJF chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Upendra Yadav, prepared the proposal and has decided to discuss it with NC and other Madhesh based parties. According to the proposal, the three leaders have agreed to integrate 6000 to 8000 combatants into Nepal Army as per the integration proposal forwarded by the Army. The three leaders have proposed to have a separate general directorate under the command of a Nepal Army officer. They have also proposed to adopt some flexibility in age, marital status and educational qualification during the integration. For the combatants who want to retire or go for a rehabilitation package, the three leaders have proposed to provide cash or package worth INR 0.5 million to 1 million depending on the rank of the combatants. The three leaders have agreed to complete the integration and rehabilitation process in 12 weeks.\n\nUCPN-M Vice Chairman Mohan Baidhya, Secretary C. P. Gajurel, Dev Prasad Gurung and Netra Bikram Chand signed note of dissent on the last day of the standing committee meeting of the party. \"We have opposed the party chairman's [Prachanda] proposal to step back from all earlier decisions on army integration,\" said C.

Stating that there is a wrong impression among the people that the ongoing processes of constitution drafting and peace process has not seen any progress, Dahal said the fact that more than 250 disputed issues seen in constitution drafting has come down to a mere 21. The ability seen in political parties to effectively monitor the peace process after UNMIN's departure and Maoist People's Liberation Army coming under the jurisdiction of the Army Integration Special Committee has shown that there has definitely been notable achievements and progress in constitution drafting and peace process. He also declared that the lawmakers from his party will not take the salary and other allowances during the extended time period of CA and urged other political parties to follow suit.\n\nMay 27: The UCPN-M 'chairman Puspha Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda ruled out submission of weapons possessed by the Peoples Liberation Army cadres to the state authority, saying the process would be \"illogical and immature\".

P. Gajurel declared that his party would not hand over the arms and ammunition to the Government as demanded by NC prior to forging consensus among the parties on the army integration modality,.

It has proposed to have a President directly elected from the people and a Prime Minister elected by the parliament with shared executive authority as the future form of governance of Nepal. The taskforce decided to have a mixed model to find middle-path between the mutually exclusive proposals of UCPN-M and NC. UCPN-M had proposed to have a directly elected President with full executive authority and NC had decided to have a Prime Minister elected from the parliament and accountable to the parliament and a ceremonial President as the future form of governance for Nepal.

Shrestha also claimed that NC is ready to accept rotational leadership with the Maoists in two phases--the peace process will be concluded in the first phase and general elections would be held in the second phase. \"NC is ready to let the Maoists lead the Government in the first phase provided they make progress in the peace process.
