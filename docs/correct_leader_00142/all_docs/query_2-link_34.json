        "text": "Surkhet, July 28\n\nWhat is the difference between CPN-Maoist Centre and washing powder? Not much, according to former Maoist ideologue and Naya Shakti Nepal Coordinator, Baburam Bhattarai.\n\n“Sometimes CPN-UML uses the CPN-Maoist Centre to clean itself. Some times, the Nepali Congress uses it for the same purpose. As such, there’s not much difference between the Maoist party and washing power,” Bhattarai said in Surkhet district on Thursday.\n\n‘Congress and Maoist Centre should respond to widespread rumours that India is behind the NC-Centre alliance’\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Birendranagar on Thursday morning, Bhattarai said the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre should respond to widespread rumours that India is behind the NC-Centre alliance.\n\n“A foreign power has been associated with the formation of a government in Nepal. This is sad for the country,” Bhattarai said, adding that the parties owe an answer to the people.\n\nBecause of the parliamentary system, dirty games are going on in the Parliament now, the former prime minister said, reiterating the need for the rule of a directly-elected executive Pressident in Nepal. Even parties winning a few seats eyed prime ministership, thus giving rise to dirty games in the House, Bhattarai said, adding that this will end only after the rule of directly-elected executive president.\n\nEven a party with one seat in the Parliament drives a hard bargain to join government in parliamentary politics, Bhattarai noted, adding: First we should develop a culture in which only the first party — the largest party in the House — gets to lead the government.\n\nBhattarai said his party has adopted leftist-democratic ideology, pointing that every ideology undergoes change."
