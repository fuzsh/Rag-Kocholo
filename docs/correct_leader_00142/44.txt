According to Bhattarai's aide Bishwodeep Pandey, police personnel treated the leaders badly by hauling them into a truck after their arrest.

Five political parties registered with the EC, including Naya Shakti Nepal, staged a sit-in outside the poll panel's office in protest against 'the election holding body's refusal to grant election symbol'.

Prior to this, the agitating parties had submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Chief Election Commissioner Ayodhee Prasad Yadav.

While submitting a memorandum in this regard to Dahal on Thursday, Naya Shaki Nepal had issued a 48-hour ultimatum to him demanding allocation of an election symbol for their party.

Naya Shakti, among others parties, staged a two-hour sit-in on Sunday outside the EC offices across the nation to press their demand.
