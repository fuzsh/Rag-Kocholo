Birth of Gary Cooper

Cooper’s family had a cattle ranch outside of town where they spent their summers riding horses, hunting, and fishing. In 1909 Cooper and his brothers traveled to England to attend grammar school.

Cooper’s film career began in 1925 when he appeared in the silent movies The Thundering Herd, Wild Horse Mesa, Riders of the Purple Sage, The Lucky Horseshoe, and The Trail Rider. Over time Cooper found the stunt work to be tough, as it often led to injuries. He decided to seek greater acting roles and arranged for a screen test. Because there were other actors known as “Frank Cooper,” he changed his name to Gary, after his agent’s hometown of Gary, Indiana.

Cooper became a star with his first sound film, The Virginian. He acted mainly in action films and comedies. Cooper was offered the male lead in Gone with the Wind, but turned it down because he thought the film would be “the biggest flop in Hollywood history.” In spite of that faulty prediction, his career didn’t suffer. He starred with some of Hollywood’s most famous actresses such as Marlene Dietrich, Ingrid Bergman, and Audrey Hepburn.
