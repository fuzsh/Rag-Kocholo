        "text": "This week we look back to when Borehamwood was visited by one of the legendary names from the golden era of Hollywood who worked at Elstree Studios.\n\nGary Cooper started off as an extra in cowboy movies in 1925 and went on to make nearly 100 films, winning two Oscars.\n\nHis parents were both English and emigrated to America, where Frank, to use his birth name, was born. However, his father decided he should be educated in England, and in 1910 Gary passed through Borehamwood by train on his way to school at Dunstable. He apparently hated the experience.\n\nWhen Gary arrived in Hollywood the movies were still silent and, no doubt, he never dreamed of the success that lay ahead. He embarked on a series of affairs with a number of well known actresses and gained a reputation as a ladies' man.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, he starred in a range of well known films and cinema-goers fell in love with his laid-back style of acting.\n\nIngrid Bergman once told me: \"When I watched Gary on set filming a scene, he seemed to put nothing into it and at first I thought it would come out on screen awfully flat.\n\n\"However, when I saw the dailies the next day it was obvious the camera just loved him, because his appearance was transformed into the effortless style we all grew to love.\"\n\nPerhaps Gary is best remembered today for the classic 1950s western High Noon, which won him an Oscar. The film was directed by the late Fred Zinnemann, who told me: \"The studio originally wanted Gregory Peck, who declined, and John Wayne just hated the story of a town turning their back on helping their marshall at his time of need against the villains.\n\n\"Coop liked the idea but the pained look on his face in the film was not so much acting as the fact he was suffering from a hernia and ulcers.\"\n\nIn 1959 Gary was offered a role in The Sundowners, to be filmed in Australia with interior shots at Elstree. But, on doctors orders, he declined and the part was taken by Bob Mitchum.\n\nIn 1960 he was operated on for cancer, but was not told the true nature of his illness and assumed it was related to ulcers. After recovering, he came to Elstree to film a murder mystery entitled The Naked Edge.\n\nThe director was Michael Anderson, whose previous successes included The Dam Busters and Around the World in Eighty Days.\n\nMike told me: \"I started at Elstree in 1936 as a boy actor and then decided there was more security behind the camera, and so became a runner.\n\n\"I used to bicycle each day from St Johns Wood and eventually worked my way up to first assistant director just before the war. It was a privilege to direct Coop and his illness never for one moment interfered with filming.\"\n\nCameraman Erwin Hillier recalled: \"We knew how ill he was and so my job was to photograph him in such a way to help disguise the drawn look on his face. He often used to lay down in his dressing room between takes.\"\n\nDeborah Kerr said: \"He was such a lovely man and my main reason for agreeing to do the film was the opportunity to work with Coop. He was a real gentleman and the epitome of the Hollywood star.\"\n\nGary returned to Hollywood in December 1960 but his health deteriorated rapidly and he died in May 1961, before the film was released.\n\nThere was an interesting footnote for a man who had travelled widely: death did not stop him repeating the habit. Gary was originally buried in Los Angeles but in 1974 his family had him moved 3,000 miles to Long Island."
