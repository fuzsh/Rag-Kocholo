        "text": "My Classic Hollywood crush is Gary Cooper so to find a photo of him with my great-grandmother, Ida Mayer Cummings, at his side (and about half his height) is such a fun start to 2016. I found this photo in Ida’s massive scrapbook, which documents several years of her decades of philanthropic and civic duty activities via letters, telegrams, programs, photos and cards.\n\nStanding at the microphone, with a roomful of adoring women hanging onto his every word (I sure would be), Gary Cooper was clearly a special guest at one of Ida’s many gala fundraising events. And by the way, the name of the young woman to his right was written below the pic but I was so star struck to see my Mr Cooper that I completely ignored it.\n\nHave pity on me!\n\nLet me know if you recognize her otherwise I’ll pull the scrapbook out again – eventually…\n\nAnd by the way, WHO is your Classic Hollywood crush? And would you want to have breakfast, lunch, or dinner with them? And at what famous old Hollywood watering hole – the Cocoanut Grove, Café Trocadero, Ciro’s, Mocambo, the Brown Derby?\n\nJoin me on Facebook here.\n\nCopyright 2016 Alicia Mayer.
