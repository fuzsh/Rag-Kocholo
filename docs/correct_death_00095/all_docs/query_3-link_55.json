        "text": "Gary J. Cooper\n\nFebruary 24, 1952\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nKnowing that one day we all must leave still does not make it any easier when that time comes for someone like Gary. Gary recently left us to be in peace.\n\nHis two sons, Robert and Daniel, were with him up until that time.\n\nThose who knew Gary best know of his great sense of humor and he was able to keep this with him all the way to the end.\n\nAlthough we did not have more than a few days from when learning of his final journey to when we could no longer be with him, many of his friends and family were able visit and say one last “Good Bye”. There is no question this meant a great deal of joy and comfort to him.\n\nIt should be no surprise that Gary also made a lasting impression to those who he had just met and took final care of him.\n\nGary is and was a caring father and a great friend.\n\nHe is already sadly missed beyond words and even though we can no longer be with him we can all imagine that wherever he is, Gary is making new friends and surely reconnection with old ones, as that is how we knew him to be.\n\nAnd that is how it will be for Gary; forever in loving memory as we will always be wondering what he may be up to next.\n\nHe is survived by\n\nSons, Daniel M. Cooper, his wife: Kathleen Cooper, Robert C. Cooper, his wife Tori Cooper,\n\nGrandchildren: Abigail Cooper, David J. Cooper Grace Cooper, Claire Cooper\n\nhis precious dog, Molly"
