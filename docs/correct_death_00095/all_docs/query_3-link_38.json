        "text": "Hollywood icon Gary Cooper never recovered from his life-threatening tumour – symptoms\n\nGARY COOPER is remembered as the all-American movie cowboy, famed for Westerns such as High Noon (1952), but the film star died when cancer took hold.\n\nBy Chanel Georgina, Senior Reporter\n\nLink copied Bookmark\n\nProstate cancer: Doctor outlines symptoms you might experience\n\nA notable Hollywood icon, Gary Cooper starred in classics such as Mr Deeds Goes To Town (1936), Sergeant York (1941), and The Pride Of The Yankees (1942). Dying from cancer, aged 60, which type of tumour took his life? Cooper's death was not attributed to one cause, as the two-time Oscar winner had two tumours – one in his prostate and another in his colon. Shortly before his death on May 13, 1961, Cooper received an Academy Honorary Award for his career achievements.\n\nThroughout his 28-year marriage to Veronica Balfe, he gained a reputation as a womaniser.\n\nCooper had multiple affairs, even after having a child – Maria – with his wife.\n\nIn fact, Cooper was involved in a number of romantic scandals; most of his entanglements were with his film co-stars.\n\nWhile chronically unfaithful, Balfe stood by her husband's side till the very end.\n\nREAD MORE: Covid cases ‘starting to go up again’ warns expert – top five symptoms in current cases\n\nProstate cancer\n\nA tumour in the prostate can grow ever so slowly that there may be no signs in the earliest stages of disease, the NHS says.\n\nWhen the tumour is \"large enough\" to affect the urethra – the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the tip of the penis – symptoms can begin to emerge.\n\nNoticeable symptoms of prostate cancer can include:\n\nAn increased need to pee\n\nStraining while you pee\n\nA feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied.\n\nThese symptoms can replicate those caused by prostate enlargement, which is a normal part of ageing.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nHowever, if you don't get the symptoms checked out, if there is a cancerous tumour, it is then allowed more time to grow and spread.\n\nCancer Research UK notes that when cancer spreads from the prostate to elsewhere in the body, it is known as \"advanced prostate cancer\".\n\nThe tumour can spread to numerous body parts, such as the lymph nodes, the liver, or lungs.\n\nOr, like it did with Cooper, it can spread to other organs, including the colon.\n\nREAD MORE: Covid cases ‘starting to go up again’ warns expert – top five symptoms in current cases\n\nStage three and stage four prostate cancer are defined by a tumour that has spread outside of the prostate.\n\nA person's chance of survival depends on the stage of cancer when it was diagnosed.\n\nTreatments can involve radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, and hormone therapy.\n\nFor some people, medical professionals will inform them that their cancer can not be cured.\n\nAs such, treatment is then used to help prevent the cancer from spreading elsewhere in the body.\n\nTreatment is also utilised to help relieve symptoms of the life-threatening tumour.\n\nAdvanced prostate cancer is likely to cause physical changes in your body, such as:\n\nChanges to the way your bowel and bladder work\n\nFeeling very tired and lacking in energy a lot of the time\n\nChanges can affect your relationships and sex life.\n\nGary Cooper starred in Distant Drums, which shows on Film4, on Wednesday, September 14 at 2.50pm."
