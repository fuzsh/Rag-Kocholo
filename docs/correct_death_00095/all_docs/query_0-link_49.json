        "text": "Gary Cooper wins Oscar for Best Actor for High Noon:\n\nUnderstated Acting Style of Gary Cooper:\n\nPersonal Quotes that Stand Out:\n\n\"The general consensus seems to be that I don't act at all.\"\n\n\"Naturalness is hard to talk about, but I guess it boils down to integrity.\"\n\n\"I've learned that if you want to reach the top, you can't compromise. You've got to keep moving up, and you can't say, 'I'm tired.'\"\n\n\"I don't like to see myself on the screen. I can't stand myself in reels.\"\n\n\"People hang on after they've lost their natural way of behaving and end up acting out of memory, and the memory is often imitative of something they’ve seen and liked.\"\n\nWhat Others Said about Gary Cooper:\n\n\"Gary Cooper had a presence, a charm, and a naturalness that made the camera love him. He made everything look easy.\"\n\n\"Cooper’s strength as an actor was his ability to make the audience believe in his character. He never had to shout or gesticulate to convey power and authority.\"\n\n\"Mr. Cooper’s strength lay in his complete naturalness. He was not only a convincing actor but also a truly sympathetic and appealing personality.\"\n\nAwards and Recognition:\n\nHigh Noon (1953)"
