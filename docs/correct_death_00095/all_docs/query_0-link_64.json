        "text": "Saddle up for a trip through entertainment history with a weekly highlight from Santa Clarita’s Walk of Western Stars! This week, Hollywood legend Gary Cooper.\n\nBorn Frank James Cooper on May 7, 1901, as the son of a prominent English Layer in Helena, Montana, Gary Cooper was living the Western life even early on. After spending his early education in English boarding school, Cooper graduated from high school in Montana, and went on to study art in college.\n\nWhen his parents moved to Los Angeles, Cooper went with them. Thanks to his experience ranching and horsemanship skills, Cooper soon began picking up work as a film extra and stunt rider in the background of silent films. Hoping for consistent work, he took on the stage name “Gary” after his casting agent’s hometown of Gary, Indiana. Before Cooper, Gary as a first name for boys was so rare it was practically nonexistent.\n\nAfter several years doing various support roles, Cooper landed high-profile roles in “Children of Divorce” (1927) and “Wings” (1927) thanks to the help of silent film star Clara Bow. “Wings” would go on to win Best Picture at the very first Academy Awards.\n\nThrough the next several decades, Cooper would establish himself as a strong leading man, helping to establish the mythos of the Western hero. In his first talking picture, “The Virginian (1929) – which was later remade in 1949 starring fellow Walk of Western Stars alum, Joel McCrea – Cooper and his deep, drawling voice defined the classic cowboy of American media.\n\nCooper’s career would span nearly four decades, with leading roles in 84 films. Some of his famous features include “A Farewell to Arms” (1932), “The Pride of the Yankees” (1942), and “For Whom the Bell Tolls” (1943).\n\nCooper died on May 13, 1961 after a long battle with cancer. Before his death, he had received many messages of farewell from major world leaders, including telegrams from Pop John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II and a telephone call from then-President John F. Kennedy.\n\nWhere is Gary Cooper’s Walk of Western Stars plaque?\n\nHonored in 1983, Cooper is remembered as a man who defined Hollywood through his work not only as an actor but also as a philanthropist.\n\nCooper’s plaque on the Walk of Western Stars can be found on Main Street (west side) just south of 8th Street.\n\nCheck back next week for another highlight from Santa Clarita’s Walk of Western Stars!\n\nLast week’s feature, Claude Akins.\n\nSponsored Articles\n\nDo you have a news tip?
