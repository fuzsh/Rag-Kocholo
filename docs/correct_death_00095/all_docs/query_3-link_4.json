        "text": "Gary Cooper (born May 7, 1901, Helena, Mont., U.S.—died May 13, 1961, Los Angeles) was an American motion-picture actor whose portrayal of homespun characters established him as a glamorized image of the average man. He was one of Hollywood’s most consistently popular and beloved stars.\n\nThe son of a Montana Supreme Court justice, Cooper left Grinnell College, Iowa, in 1924 and went to Hollywood, where he earned a living as a cowboy extra and stunt rider. His agent changed his name, and he advanced to leading parts in modestly budgeted westerns that were often box-office hits. A major stroke of luck was his being cast in The Winning of Barbara Worth (1926). He rose to stardom in The Virginian (1929), one of his first talking pictures, and became one of Hollywood’s leading male actors with his appearances in such films as Morocco (1930), A Farewell to Arms (1932), Design for Living (1933), The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935), Desire (1936), The Plainsman (1937), Beau Geste (1939), and The Westerner (1940).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nCooper often played a brave, laconic, and somewhat reticent man whose upright character compels him to perform heroic actions that he does not purposely seek. He typified the role of the unsophisticated man fighting for what he thought was right in two films directed by Frank Capra, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) and Meet John Doe (1941). Among Cooper’s other important films were Sergeant York (1941), Ball of Fire (1941), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), and The Fountainhead (1949). His role as the aging town marshall in High Noon (1952) is considered Cooper’s finest performance and the film one of the greatest westerns ever made. Among his last films are Friendly Persuasion (1956) and Love in the Afternoon (1957)."
