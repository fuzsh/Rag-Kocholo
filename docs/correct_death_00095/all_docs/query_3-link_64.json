        "text": "Gary Cooper, age 79 years, resident of Thunder Bay, passed away peacefully at St. Joseph's Hospital on Saturday, July 06, 2024. Born on February 23, 1945, he was raised and educated in Fort William and attended Selkirk High School. He was employed as a Constable with the Ontario Provincial Police, retiring after 38 years of service. Gary enjoyed watching the local Thunder Wolves hockey games, Thunder Bay Border Cats baseball and occasionally attending Toronto Blue Jays live games. He always enjoyed spending time with family at the celebrated occasions, trips to the annual Fisherman's Picnic, family BBQs, or just a coffee time in the backyard. Most of all he looked forward to travelling with Betty-June, his beloved wife of 56 years.\n\nGary loved helping people and was a volunteer to the extreme. In early years he was M/C at the Cystic Fibrosis Mother's Day Telethons, M/C at local Canada Day celebrations at the water front, and M/C at the local Santa Claus parades. His volunteer work continued as a spokesman for MEMO organization, board member and bingo caller for HAGI, live auctioneer for the Salvation Army and the Adult & Teen Challenge Thrift Stores. Gary could also be found serving at church Sunday mornings either as an usher, or kitchen helper, reading announcements or as an M/C at special events.\n\nAs a two-time liver transplant recipient, Gary was very grateful for the gift of 28 years of added life that resulted from his transplants in 1996 and 2010. With the unselfish act of families donating organs, he was able to appreciate extended life with his own family. As a result, Gary became very connected to the pay-it-forward motion and he extended into a new area of volunteering. He became a board member with Trillium Gift of Life and began his mission of promoting organ transplant awareness in northwestern Ontario through presentations and media events. He was also a volunteer for the Northern Ontario School of Medicine and in 2013 became a Patient Family Advisor for the TBRHSC.\n\nGary is survived by his loving wife Betty-June, his son Todd Cooper (Susan), son Chris Cooper (Barb), mother Hazel Cooper, and sister Cheryl Kibsey (Sam).\n\nGary is predeceased by his father George Cooper, sister-in-law Sheila Hardy (Wilf), sister-in-law Donna Andersen (Finn) (Peter Hardy), and niece Kelly Daberer.\n\nCremation for Gary has taken place. A celebration of life for family and friends will be held at the Italian Cultural Centre on Thursday, July 25, 2024 from 1:00 pm until 4:00 pm. Green ribbons will be available at the hall entrance to give everyone the opportunity to acknowledge organ and tissue donation awareness.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations to the Northern Cancer Fund or TBRHSC would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCondolences may be made through www.nwfainc.com"
