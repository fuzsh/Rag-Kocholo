        "text": "Gary E. Cooper was born on September 3, 1940 in Roanoke, Virginia. He passed away at the age of 83 on December 6, 2023 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nGary is survived by his sister Louise C. Lee, his loving daughter Susan A. LaDue, his son-in-law Gary R. LaDue, his grand-daughter Nicole A. LaDue, his grandson, Garisan C. LaDue. Gary was pre-deceased by his dear wife Merle Cooper, his mother Mable Blevins, his father Clarence Cooper, his brother David Cooper, his sister Wanda Cannon, and his brother Lonnie Cooper.\n\nGary spent his childhood in Cooper's Cove, Virginia, and lived most of his adult life in Upper Marlboro, Maryland with the love of his life, Merle. Gary had a successful career as a Chief Pilot for the CIA, and he continued his love for all things aviation into retirement; he loved to share stories about the powerful people that he chauffeured through the skies, and he had an impressive collection of toy airplanes.\n\nGary will be remembered as a man who loved music and was very talented on many stringed instruments, including the guitar and the banjo. He spent many years playing and singing with his Bluegrass band, Gary Cooper and High Noon, and he played with some of the best bluegrass musicians around. Even after he stopped playing, he continued to attend bluegrass festivals to listen to the music and see his friends. We will always love and miss him - fly high, Papa Cooper."
