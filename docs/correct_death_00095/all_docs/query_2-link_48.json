        "text": "Dr. Gary Gitnick, known as “Doc Hollywood” for his medical and philanthropy work and treating major celebrities, has died. He was 82.\n\nGitnick died Nov. 4 at UCLA Medical Center after a long illness, daughter Tracy Gitnick Herriott said in an email.\n\nDr. Gitnick and his wife, Cherna, started the Fulfillment Fund in 1977 after spotting a troubling trend of students from underrepresented communities not transferring to a college or even graduating from high school, according to Gitnick Herriott.\n\nLaunched as a holiday party for children with disabilities, the event was transformed into a mentoring organization that promoted higher education with annual concerts — which hosted A-list celebrities, including actors Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro.\n\n“He directly helped thousands upon thousands of children find a pathway to college and beyond,” his daughter wrote, “when it otherwise would not have been possible, and in doing so, inspired those around him to do the same.”\n\nIn 1989, The Fulfillment Fund began offering a college scholarship program and, later, a mentor program, followed by a college counseling program, classroom instruction, financial aid support, college trips and experiential learning opportunities.\n\n“A college education is important,” De Niro during a 2018 event hosted by the Fulfillment Fund, “but education without humanity is ignorance.”\n\nThe organization has offered mentoring programs and college scholarships to more than 2,000 students each year from educationally and economically underserved communities, with the goal of helping children lift themselves out of poverty through education.\n\nGary Gitnick was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1939 to Nathan and Ann Gitnick. He earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of Chicago and his MD at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine.\n\nHe completed his internship at Johns Hopkins University Hospital and gastroenterology subspecialty training at the Mayo Clinic. Gitnick also spent three years as a research associate at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nGitnick joined the UCLA faculty in 1969 and later became chief of staff of the UCLA Medical Center, medical director of the UCLA Health Care Programs and, starting in 1993, chief of the division of digestive diseases.\n\nDuring this successful career, Gitnick also produced more than 300 publications and authored or edited 64 books on gastroenterology and hepatology. He retired from UCLA as the emeritus chief of the Vatche and Tamar Manoukian Division of Digestive Diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine.\n\n“Gary Gitnick’s leadership over more than two decades helped the Division of Digestive Diseases become the best in the world,” Dr. Alan Fogelman, chair of UCLA’s Department of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine, said in a UCLA Health article on Gitnick’s death. “His work will continue to benefit the lives of many for decades to come.”\n\nGitnick’s moniker, “Doc Hollywood,” stemmed from his treating multiple major celebrities and studio chiefs, Gitnick Herriott said.\n\nHe also served as president of the Medical Board of California and as a member of its executive committee. He chaired the Board of Trustees of the Health Professions Education Foundation, developed by the California Health Corps, which enables doctors, nurses and allied health workers to provide care to underserved populations in exchange for educational loan repayment.\n\nGitnick is survived by his wife of 57 years, Cherna; children Neil Gitnick, Kim Gitnick, Jill Steinberg and Tracy Gitnick Herriott; and grandchildren Thomas, River, Sydney, Charles, Dani, Chloe and Charlie."
