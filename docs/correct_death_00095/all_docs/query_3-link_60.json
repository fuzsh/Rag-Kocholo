        "text": "MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - On this warm Wednesday evening -- it’s a bittersweet gathering for friends and family of Major General Gary Cooper -- known in so many circles for not only his service to country but life-long service to community.\n\n“Service was core to who he was and core to who we are. He was absolutely adamant that you don’t have a right to be here unless you serve others,” said Joli Cooper, Major General Cooper’s daughter.\n\nMajor General Cooper lived that motto. A decorated veteran -- serving in Vietnam -- he was the first black officer in the Marine Corps to lead an infantry company into combat -- receiving a Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry three times. His other military decorations also include the Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit.\n\nIn 1974 he was elected to the Alabama’s House of Representatives. He was one of the first African-Americans since the Reconstruction era elected to the Legislature from South Alabama.\n\nAnd while his career led him to work under two U.S. Presidents -- including as the U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica -- he was always larger than life to his three children.\n\n“I think it’s more than an honor because you always felt as if he was a great man but to us -- he was just dad -- because he was a single father even more so,” said Joli.\n\nWhile his children are very proud -- they say his commitment to family knew no bounds.\n\n“What I’ll remember most about him is -- that he gained custody of me and my two younger sisters. He was single. And it was unusual back in the 70s to have a single man raising three wild little kids on his own. And he did a good job,” said son Patrick Cooper.\n\nInside Prince of Peace Catholic Church -- veterans filed in to do a final salute to Major General Cooper -- then his Psi Phi Fraternity paid special tribute to one of their own.\n\nUp until retirement in 2022 -- the General helped build Commonwealth National Bank -- one of only 14 black-owned banks in the country.\n\n“He cared for people. He was stern. He was firm. But you knew his heart -- he had a heart of gold,” said Sidney King, President & CEO of Commonwealth National Bank.\n\nHe hired King in the late 90s -- grooming and growing him to be a better leader.\n\n“He told me do not to look for shortcuts -- get things done the right way! If you can’t find time to do it right -- where are you going to find time to do it over,” said King.\n\nHis was certainly a life well-lived -- leading by example -- his legacy lives on.\n\n“He walked so I could run. He gave me the opportunity to go to a grand institution like he did -- Notre Dame. And be able to get into industries that many people in the African American community usually don’t. I feel like he really set this all up for the later generation who came behind him,” said grandson Anthony Nelson.\n\nIn addition to his three children and many grand children -- Major General Cooper is survived by his wife Beverly of 33 years. He will be laid to rest at the Alabama State Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Spanish Fort.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Kay Ivey has ordered U.S. Flags be flown at half-staff in Mobile County (Thursday, May 2nd) in honor of Cooper."
