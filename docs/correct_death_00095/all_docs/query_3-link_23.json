        "text": "Gary Robert Cooper, Sr. completed his earthly journey on Saturday, February 10, 2024 at home in Forest, VA. Gary was born in Pulaski, VA on March 24, 1944 to Merit Jordan Cooper and Peggy Howell Cooper. In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his brother, Merit Jordan Cooper, Jr. and his sisters Marie Cooper Craig, Jaquita Cooper Edney, Ellen Cooper Carty, and his brother-by-choice Joseph Lepre, Sr.\n\nGary is survived by his wife of 59 years, Peggy Hoffman Cooper; son Gary R. Cooper, Jr of Forest, VA; Eric Cooper (Cindy) of Charlottesville, VA; and Elizabeth Cooper Wayt (Michael) of Ashburn, VA. He leaves broken-hearted grandchildren Cameron Wayt, Cooper Wayt, Donovan Cooper, and Coraline Cooper. He leaves many beloved nieces, nephews and extended family.\n\nGary studied Building Construction and Business at Virginia Tech and remained an avid Hokie fan throughout his life. His entire career was in construction, both residential and commercial; and he had his own construction company. In his retirement Gary's passion was genealogy and he spent a lot of time researching and compiling family trees for family and friends.\n\nGary participated as a football and basketball coach during his time in Vienna, VA - touching the lives of many young men who played for him. He has been able to reconnect with many players he coached over the years and he loved being remembered as \"Coach Coop\".\n\nGary's legacy is not measured in wealth or accomplishments but in the moments he leaves with his treasured grandchildren. He forged a special bond with each grandchild. He was an architect of countless pillow talks and the teacher of profound lessons. His love for his grandchildren was unwavering, an unspoken assurance that they were cherished beyond measure. Rest in peace \"Gangraddy\", knowing that your legacy lives on in the hearts and minds of the grandchildren you loved so much.\n\nA visitation will be held on Sunday, February 18, 2024 from 2:00-2:45pm at North Bedford Baptist Church.
