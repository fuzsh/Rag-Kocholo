        "text": "THUNDER BAY – Long-time HAGI TV Bingo host Gary Cooper will be remembered as a passionate volunteer in numerous organizations.\n\nCooper passed away peacefully last Saturday at the age of 79.\n\nHe was a well-known community champion - serving as a board member of the Handicapped Action Group Incorporated.\n\nCooper spent 38 years with the Ontario Provincial Police and was a school bus safety advocate. He was also a Patient Family Advisor at the hospital who was known for his dedication to educating staff and new hires.\n\nThe flags at the hospital will be lowered to half-mast on July 25 in honour of Cooper.\n\nHe will also be remembered for the desire he had to help anybody in need.\n\nRyley Hlady, president of HAGI's board of directors, said Cooper was part of HAGI for a long time and before that he was with the OPP.\n\n“I can remember seeing Gary as a kid when he used to do the public service announcements for the OPP. Recently, he had just completed his 20th year of calling our Saturday night bingo.\n\n“Gary has volunteered I think just about everywhere he could in the city,” Hlady said.\n\nAlthough Cooper knew his health was not great, he was determined to be well enough to come back and call bingo, he said.\n\n“He did his own thing. Gary always managed to throw in some comments, something special in the community going on or birthdays.\n\n“He always made sure that he brought some colour to it.”\n\nCooper was very passionate about bingo, Hlady said.\n\n“Making sure that it ran well. Everybody in the community that would see him out in the street would often comment about the last week's game.\n\nThey would “tell him they were waiting on one number or just want to chat with him. Gary would sit and talk to anybody – just that wonderful kind of personality.”\n\nHe was on TV just about every Saturday he could be, Hlady said.\n\n“We've had various other callers on the schedule over the years, but none more remembered than Gary.\n\n“He was just very passionate about helping anybody.”\n\nHlady said Cooper was a wealth of experience over the years.\n\n“He's done a lot in community. He couldn't go places without somebody saying, ‘hey, there's the guy from bingo.’”\n\nCooper brought a lot of experience to the board at HAGI, too.\n\n“He knew a lot of people in the community, which was sometimes a big help to us. I know he volunteered in a lot of different places.\n\n“Everybody loved him. I don't think you can find anybody out in the community that could tell you something awful about him or say a bad thing about the man.\n\n“It was a big part of his life and he was a big part of our bingo as well.”\n\nHlady said Cooper was very big on volunteering at the hospital and a lot of people there loved him.\n\n“I remember seeing him as a kid in the public service announcements on television with the OPP and then getting to meet him when I became a part of HAGI.\n\n“It was nice to be able to sit and talk with him, get to know him a little bit better. I wish I had more time to know him.”\n\nHlady said Cooper will be missed by many, leaving a big hole in their hearts.\n\n“All I can say is thank you, Gary.\n\n“His contributions here, his friendship, his knowledge, his leadership – it's going to leave us with a big hole,” Hlady said."
