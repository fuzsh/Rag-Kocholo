        "text": "Cooper, Gary\n\nPeople > Cooper, Gary\n\nGary (Frank James) Cooper was born on 7th May 1901 in Helena, Montana, USA. His father, Charles, was part of a Bedfordshire family. Gary's grandfather, John, lived at Manor Farm, Tingrith, and his father was born at the White House in Houghton Regis.\n\nCharles emigrated to the USA when he was 19, where he met and married Alice Brazier. They had two sons, and when in 1910, Gary's mother was advised to take a sea voyage for her health, she went to England with the boys.\n\nGary went to Dunstable Grammar School (now Ashton Middle School). They stayed with relatives Mr & Mrs W.H. Barton, High Street North, on the corner of Waterlow Road. During the weekends the boys stayed with relatives in Houghton Regis and regularly visited the local church. Gary and his older brother Arthur were baptised together in December 1911 at Houghton Regis parish church. The boys returned to the USA in 1913 (although some sources dispute this) with their mother, but Gary returned on visits to Dunstable in 1932 and 1936 and in the 1950s.\n\nGary Cooper died on 13th May 1961 in Los Angeles. He had been suffering from prostate cancer. During his career he won 2 Oscars, for Will Kane in High Noon (1952) and Sgt Alvin York in Sergeant York (1941).\n\nThere is a plaque showing where Gary lived in High Street North, while attending Dunstable Grammar School. The inscription reads:-\n\nDunstable Town Council\n\nGary Cooper\n\nFilm Star\n\nand\n\nDunstable Grammar\n\nSchool Pupil\n\nlived here\n\n1910 - 1913\n\nSources:\n\nDunstable in detail, by Nigel C. Benson (Book Castle, 1986)\n\nThe Internet Movie Database\n\nThe Gary Cooper Scrapbook\n\nGary Cooper, by Bedfordshire Libraries, 2012\n\nPage last updated: 24th January 2014"
