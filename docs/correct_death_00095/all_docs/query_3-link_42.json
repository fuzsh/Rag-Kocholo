        "text": "Gary Cooper, age 60, passed away May 7th after fighting a courageous battle with cancer. But cancer did not win, because on May 7th Gary made his most significant home run. He was always dressed up and dressed out to play and, on this day, he got the chance to lay down his trophies for a crown.\n\nGary was involved and never content to let the world pass him by. He loved spending time with his family, friends and being involved with his community. He was a member of the Statesboro Jaycees and managed the Empty Stocking Fund for underprivileged children. He loved golf, football and softballâ€”not necessarily in that order. He also loved pulling the chains for the Statesboro High School football games. He loved watching western movies on television, but his favorite pastime was watching the Georgia Bulldogs. Go DAWGS!\n\nGary is preceded in death by his parents, Henry and Carolyn Cooper, and his brother, Carlton Cooper.\n\nHe is survived by and will be greatly missed by his wife, Kandi Odom Cooper; his daughter, Brittany Morgan Cooper; his brothers, David Cooper (Brenda), Steve Cooper (Linda); mother-in- law, Mickie Odom; sister-in-law, Lynette Cooper; brother-in-law, Michael Odom; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nThe Family will receive friends at Deal Funeral Directors on Sunday, May 9, 2021 from 6:00-8 PM.\n\nThe funeral service will be Monday, May 10, 2021 at 11:00 AM in the Chapel of Deal Funeral Directors with Dr. Max Alderman and Pastor Brian Cooper officiating. Interment will follow at Bulloch Memorial Gardens.\n\nHonorary Pallbearers will be co-workers from First District RESA. Pallbearers will be: Greg Hendrix, Kenny Johnson, Jimmy Ward, Jim Scott, Jerel Scott, Joel Scott and Donnie Epperson."
