        "text": "(1901–61). U.S. motion-picture actor Gary Cooper became one of Hollywood’s most consistently popular stars with his portrayal of homespun characters. He won an Academy Award for best actor in 1941 and 1952, and in 1961 he received a Special Academy Award to honor his career and the international reputation he won for the film industry.\n\nFrank James Cooper was born on May 7, 1901, in Helena, Mont. He left Grinnell College, Iowa, in 1924 and went to Hollywood, where he earned a living as a cowboy extra and stunt rider. Soon afterward his agent changed his name. Cooper began to land leading parts in modestly budgeted westerns that were often box-office hits, including The Winning of Barbara Worth (1926). He rose to stardom in The Virginian (1929), one of his first talking pictures, and became one of Hollywood’s leading male actors with his appearances in such films as Morocco (1930), A Farewell to Arms (1932), Design for Living (1933), The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935), Desire (1936), The Plainsman (1937), Beau Geste (1939), and The Westerner (1940)."
