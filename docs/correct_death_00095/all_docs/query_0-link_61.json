        "text": "I confess, I fell hook, line and sinker in love with Gary Cooper at the age of 13 when I watched the 1941 Frank Capra/Robert Riskin political drama MEET JOHN DOE on television. I became so engrossed in the film that I even started yelling at the TV screen trying to tell John Doe not to jump off the building. My parents were probably wondering what was happening to their usually quiet daughter.\n\nCooper was the complete package. He was tall, gorgeous with beautiful blue eyes and had “It”— that magical star quality that leapt off the screen and made him a star for over three decades. And he was the perfect Everyman, whether he was playing the vulnerable poet in his first film with Capra, MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN (’36); the World War I hero Alvin York in SERGEANT YORK (’41), for which he received his first Oscar for Best Actor; the beloved New York Yankee Lou Gehrig in THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES (’42); and the brave sheriff Will Kane in HIGH NOON (’52), for which he was awarded his second Oscar.\n\nWhen I interviewed film historian/writer/documentarian Richard Schickel for my 2002 Los Angeles Times piece on Coop’s centennial, he explained the actor still resonated with contemporary audiences “[because] I don’t know if there is another actor, maybe in all of movies, who had more good movies to his credit. There are maybe 15 or 20 movies of Cooper’s that really continue to be movies that you watch with pleasure. I don’t know anybody other than Cary Grant who had a similarly strong filmography.”\n\nPlus, Schickel added: “I think that inherent sense that this was a nice guy has made him wear well. People who have a more adverse edge to them wear out their welcome sooner, whether they are dead or live. Cooper has movies that are played constantly, commented upon, kind of iconic movies of their type.”\n\nIn celebration of what would have Cooper’s 118th birthday on May 7, I want to highlight two of my favorite Cooper films: William Wyler’s FRIENDLY PERSUASION (’56) and the underrated Western THE HANGING TREE (’59).\n\nFRIENDLY PERSUASION is also one of Maria Cooper Janis’, Cooper’s daughter, favorite films of her father’s. She described it as a “film I love. Willy Wyler was a wonderful director, my father loved working with Willy on that.” She told me in 2001 that her father always wanted his characters to illustrate “’the best a man can be – the best human behavior as possible.’ So, I think he chose roles that exemplified that. Being a hero doesn’t mean you are unflawed. We are all very human.” But when push came to shove, Coop’s characters would “behave in a noble way where you put right and wrong and principals before personal needs or satisfaction or comfort.”\n\nBased on Jessamyn West’s best-seller and nominated for six Oscars including Best Film, Director and Supporting Actor for Anthony Perkins, FRIENDLY PERSUASION casts Cooper as Jess Birdwell, the patriarch of a Quaker family living on a farm in rural Indiana in the 19th century. Their family’s peaceful existence is upended when the Civil War invades their lives, leading their son (Perkins) to sign up to fight.\n\nThe drama marks the first time Cooper played a parent with grown children and initially he didn’t think his fans would accept him in such a role. But they did. Cooper beautifully portrayed Birdwell’s complex feelings when his son goes off to war and his own desire to avenge the death of a friend.\n\nAccording to the TCM.com overview of the film, Cooper thought his character should take up arms and fight. “There comes a time in a picture of mine when the people watching me expect me to do something,” he told West. The author told him that refraining from violence was doing something. “You will furnish your public with the refreshing picture of a strong man refraining,” West told Cooper.\n\nThanks to TCM and Warner Archive, Cooper’s fans are getting a chance to see THE HANGING TREE, a fabulous Western that was not a hit upon release. Cooper again stretches his range as the mysterious Dr. Joseph Frail who arrives in a Montana mining town and sets up his practice. Though Frail is compassionate to his patients, he also can transform into a man capable of violence.\n\nCooper wasn’t in the best physical shape at the time (he was suffering from a bad hip), but he still proved he could be a romantic lead in his scenes with Maria Schell, as a young woman who was temporarily blinded in a stage coach attack he takes in and nurses back to health. Karl Malden, who took over directorial duties when director Delmer Daves was hospitalized, is at his slimy best as a miner who also has eyes on Schell. And Ben Piazza plays an injured young thief who is also taken in by Frail.\n\nCooper died just six days after his 60th birthday on May 13, 1961 of cancer. His final film, THE NAKED EDGE (’61), was released posthumously. Despite his tremendous success, Janis said her father always regretted that his fans wouldn’t let him play the bad guys. “He had to end up being the good guy,” she said. “I think, sadly, the last film he made, THE NAKED EDGE, didn’t work for that very reason. The whole movie hinged on you believing Gary Cooper was a murderer. Well, no way. The public didn’t buy it and rightfully so, you might say.”"
