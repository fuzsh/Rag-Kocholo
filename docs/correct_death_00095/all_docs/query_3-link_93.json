        "text": "It is with profound sadness that we share the news of the passing of our esteemed colleague and friend, Gary Cooper.\n\nA Patient Family Advisor (PFA) since 2013, Gary was not only an active member of the PFA Council, but a cornerstone of our community. As a two-time transplant recipient, he was the face and the voice of many presentations and media events for Trillium Gift of Life throughout Thunder Bay and Northwestern Ontario.\n\nGary’s passion, commitment and unwavering support was truly inspiring, and his dedication to Patient Family Centred Care (PFCC) was second to none. Whether he was providing PFCC orientation to the new hires or introducing current staff to the PFAs and driving home the importance PFCC, Gary was in his element as an educator.\n\nWhen Gary wasn’t teaching, he was volunteering his time with NOSM University, working with student doctors to help them develop their skills, efficiency and interview skills, by roleplaying the part of a patient.\n\nHis many contributions have made a significant impact in our organization and beyond, leaving an indelible mark. His absence will be felt greatly by all of us. Gary’s kindness, wisdom and positive spirit touched many lives and we are grateful for the time that we had with him.\n\nIn this difficult time, let us remember Gary and the legacy that he leaves behind. As a PFA Council, we will continue to honour his memory by striving to uphold the values and standards for which he so passionately advocated.\n\nWe send our deepest condolences to Gary’s family, friends, and all those affected by this loss.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be taking place Thursday, July 25, 2024 at 1:00 p.m. at the Italian Cultural Centre (132 Algoma St. S).\n\nThe flags at the Hospital will be lowered to half-mast at noon on July 25 in honour of Gary."
