        "text": "Since hearing about Gary Cooper’s recent death, long-time Ambridge sports fans have reminisced about an extraordinary athlete whose life turned tragically sad when he was just 24.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Cooper starred in basketball and football for the Bridgers. Although basketball was his favorite sport, it was football that gave him a chance to land a scholarship.\n\nCooper got that full ride at Clemson, a major-college power at the time. After starring for the Tigers as a three-year starter, he hoped to latch on with an NFL team before that fateful night of June 4, 1991. That’s when he was involved in a car accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down. The young man who ran so fast and fluidly would never walk again.\n\nTwenty-four years later, his life came to an end. Cooper died Friday in Columbus, Ohio, where he had been living with his aunt/care giver. He was just 48 years old.\n\nCooper died about a year after his mother, Gloria Cooper, passed away. Ever since that accident in 1991, Cooper’s mother had been taking care of her wheelchair-bound son. Copper’s close friends say that when his mother died, his spirits began to wane.\n\nWhile at Clemson, Cooper started on teams that went 10-2, 10-2 and 9-2. He played on teams that beat Penn State in the 1987 Citrus Bowl and West Virginia in the 1989 Gator Bowl. His Clemson teammates, knowing that Cooper had the same name as a famous actor, started calling him “High Noon” and “Pride of the Tigers.”\n\nGary Cooper the actor won an Oscar in 1953 for his role in the movie “High Noon” and was nominated for an Oscar when he portrayed Lou Gehrig in “The Pride of the Yankees.”\n\nBut when Gary Cooper, the 1985 Ambridge graduate, played for the Bridgers, he was known as “Super Dooper.”\n\nAt 6-foot-4 and 185 pounds, he was good enough in basketball that the likes of Maryland and Stanford at least expressed interest in him. But after sitting out his sophomore and junior seasons of football, he went out as a senior and became one of the top prospects in Pennsylvania.\n\nSHENANGO VS. SOUTH SIDE AMONG WPIAL’S TOP GAMES\n\nIn Week 6 of the WPIAL football season, it’s showdown time. This weekend’s schedule features several blockbusters with first place on the line.\n\nIn Class AAA, it’s 5-0 Ringgold vs. 5-0 Belle Vernon in the Big 10 Conference and Hampton (5-0) vs. Franklin Regional (4-1) in the Greater Allegheny.\n\nIn Class AA, it’s 5-0 South Fayette vs. 5-0 Steel Valley in the Century Conference and Highland (5-0) vs. Freeport (4-1) in the Allegheny.\n\nIn Class A, it’s 5-0 Clairton vs. 5-0 Jeannette in the Eastern Conference, 5-0 Frazier vs. 4-1 Beth-Center in the Tri-County South and 4-1 Shenango vs. 4-1 South Side in the Big Seven.\n\nAll 14 of the teams I just mentioned are ranked in The Times 10 poll in their respective classes.\n\nLast year, South Side finished third in the Big Seven at 5-2 behind Neshannock (7-0) and Shenango (6-1)\n\nIf South Side pulls off a mild upset over Shenango and Neshannock (4-1) beats Vincentian (1-4) as expected, they’ll be a three-way tie for first place in the Big Seven. The Rams, Wildcats and Lancers would all be 4-1 in conference play.\n\nRIVERSIDE NEEDS A WIN\n\nAs Riverside prepares for Friday’s game against Union, there’s encouraging news on the injury front.\n\nQuarterback Jason Dambach appears ready to go despite suffering a thumb injury in last week’s 65-3 loss at North Catholic.\n\nAlso, Lance Fisher, a junior running back/linebacker, is expected to return after missing several games due to injury.\n\nAt 1-2 in Big Seven play, Riverside is basically in a must-win situation against Union (2-2) if it wants to make the WPIAL Class A playoffs for the second year in a row.\n\nAfter playing Union, Riverside plays two of the Big Seven’s top teams in first-place, Shenango and South Side. If Riverside can beat Union, there’s a good chance the Panthers will finish in a three-way tie for fourth-place with Union and Rochester. If that happens, the Modified Gardner Points system will be used to break the tie and determine the fourth-place playoff team out of the Big Seven.\n\nAfter a 2-0 start, Riverside, hit hard by injuries, has lost its last three.\n\nSTRONG WEST A. CONTINGENT AT GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nWest Allegheny’s golf team will be well represented Thursday at Southpointe Golf Club for the WPIAL Class AAA boys championship. Of the 36 contestants, three play for the Indians: seniors Jacob Gazella and Sean Weber, and junior Chasen Claus.\n\nThe only other golfer from The Times’ circulation area in the field is Moon senior Noah Firmstone.\n\nThe low 14 scores advance to the PIAA Regional that will be held Oct. 19 at Tom’s Run Golf Course in Blairsville.\n\nMEMORABLE 3 FOR ROMAN\n\nJerry Roman, the chairman of the WPIAL’s golf steering committee, recently knocked his tee shot in the hole at the par-3 17th at The Club of Shadow Lakes. But it wasn’t a hole-in-one.\n\nOn his first tee shot at 17, Roman hit his ball into a pond situated right of the green. So he had to reload, and now hitting 3 from the tee, launched a shot that headed straight toward the flagstick. His ball landed on the green a few feet from the cup and then bounced in.\n\nRoman, a Raccoon Township resident who once coached Beaver’s boys basketball team, plays a pretty good game of golf. He’s a 3 handicap."
