        "meta_description": "A five-disc collection of Keaton's 32 extant silent short films, presented in 2K restorations, newly scanned using archival film elements from around the world. This set includes the short comedies that Keaton made with pioneering silent comedy genius Roscoe Arbuckle, as well as all 19 of his independently-produced silent shorts that have cemented his reputation as one of silent cinema's most unique and respected artists.  BUSTER KEATON: THE SHORTS COLLECTION includes 13 of the Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle comedies produced between 1917-1920, in which Keaton co-starred alongside Arbuckle and Al St. John. In these formative works, Keaton honed his craft performing for the camera, and learned the art of filmmaking from Arbuckle, an extremely gifted comedy performer and director who, at the time, was second only to Chaplin among the screen's most popular clowns.  The set also showcases all 19 of Keaton's independently-produced silent shorts, made between 1920 and 1923, including such classics as One Week, which follows the disastrous efforts of Keaton and his new bride to put together a prefabricated house; Cops, in which Keaton finds himself pursued by the entire city police force; and The Playhouse, a technical tour-de-force with Keaton playing all of the members of the cast (and audience) of a theatrical show. This edition also features the restored version of Hard Luck, Keaton's own favorite of all his short comedies, which includes the ́missinǵ ending with the final sight gag intact. These films, all of which were co-directed by Keaton, show him emerging as a fully-formed film artist, demonstrating both his remarkable slapstick abilities as a performer, and sophisticated visual style as a filmmaker. The films in this collection are presented with orchestral scores by Frank Bockius, Neil Brand, Timothy Brock, Antonio Coppola, Stephen Horne, Robert Israel, The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, Dennis Scott, and Donald Sosin.",
