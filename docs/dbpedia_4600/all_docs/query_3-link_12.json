However, \"silent movies\" or \"silent films\" is how they became known and all we can say is that these terms are \"misnomers\".\n\nAn error in naming a person or place.\n\nExamples of misnomers:\n\n\"dial\" or \"redial\" - we hardly find any rotatory phone these days.\n\n\"catgut\" - not made from cat's gut.\n\n\"starfish\" are not fish.\n\netc.\n\nThe correct name for a thing, however, is the name we call it, be it a misnomer or not. But if you ask me what more descriptive term might have been coined for \"silent movies\", I would suggest \"films without synchronized sound\"\n\nanswered Aug 20, 2016 at 15:46\n\nCentaurusCentaurus\n\n50.2k4848 gold badges169169 silver badges295295 bronze badges"
