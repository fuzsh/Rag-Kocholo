A recording of the song was released prior to the film's opening, and several reviews mention that it became a hit without the aid of the film. A reported three million copies of the record and 700,000 copies of the sheet music were sold as of 1949, when orchestra leader and songwriter Freddie Rich filed a plagiarism suit over the song. Paramount, Jay Livingston and Ray Evans, Decca, Famous Music, RCA Victor, Columbia Records and Capital Records were named as defendants in the half-million-dollar suit. After \"Buttons and Bows\" was used in the film's 1952 sequel, Son of Paleface, Rich, who claimed portions of the song were taken from his score for Paramount's 1942 film Wildcat (see below, added $250,000 to his estimate of damages. According to various sources, twenty-two to thirty-two bars of \"Buttons and Bows\" were in question. A jury turned in a verdict in favor of Paramount, and Rich lost a later appeal in Feb 1955.\n\nAs noted above, in 1952, Hope and Russell starred in a sequel to The Paleface called Son of Paleface, directed by Frank Tashlin. In 1968, The Paleface was remade into The Shakiest Gun in the West, with Alan Rafkin directing and Don Knotts and Barbara Rhoades starring. Among the many other films featuring Martha Jane Canary, popularly known as \"Calamity Jane,\" are: the 1923 Famous Players-Lasky film Wild Bill Hickock, directed by Clifford S. Smith and starring Ethel Grey Terry and William S. Hart (see AFI Catalog of Feature Films, 1921-30; F2.6360); the 1936 Cecil B. DeMille film The Plainsman, starring Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur (see AFI Catalog of Feature Films, 1931-40; F3.3472); the 1949 film Calamity Jane and Sam Bass, directed by George Sherman, and starring Yvonne de Carlo and Howard Duff (see above); and the 1995 United Artists film Wild Bill, directed by Walter Hill, and starring Ellen Barkin and Jeff Bridges.\n\nLess\n\nSharpshooter and outlaw Calamity Jane is released from prison in order to catch renegades who have been smuggling guns to the Indians.

Painless talks tough and gives Joe until sundown to get out of town, and Jane decides to let him be killed in order to get rid of him. At the last minute, as Painless walks out into the street to meet Joe for a duel, Jane decides to save Painless in order to use him as bait, and shoots for him from a window, killing Joe. Hank later enters Jane and Painless' room with an arrow in his back and tells her that the dynamite is in the undertaker's parlor. Jane sends Painless after the dynamite, and he bravely holds up the renegades, but then is abducted by an Indian. He and Jane are then taken hostage at an Indian camp, where she confesses that she married him to aid her in catching the outlaws, but now loves him. Also at the camp is the white turncoat, Jasper Martin, whom Jane recognizes as one of the governor's aides. As Jane is tied to a stake and prepared for burning, Painless, transformed by Jane's love, rigs the dynamite to blow, and they escape. Later, as Jane and Painless leave for their honeymoon, she is pulled from the wagon by one of the horses and dragged off into the distance.\n\nLess"
