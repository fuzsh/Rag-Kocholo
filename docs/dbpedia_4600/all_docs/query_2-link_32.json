        "text": "Blu-ray Release Date: July 14, 2020\n\nPrice: Blu-ray $17.99\n\nStudio: Kino Lorber\n\nThe Wild West gets its comeuppance in the 1948 comedy farce The Paleface, which introduced the Academy Award-winning song “Buttons and Bows.”\n\nIn one of his most popular roles, comedy legend Bob Hope (My Favorite Spy) plays “Painless” Peter Potter, a timid correspondence school dentist earning a shaky living in the lawless West. When “Painless” is seduced into agreeing to a quickie marriage by the voluptuous Jane Russell (The Outlaw), he thinks his luck has changed. Little does he suspect that Russell is actually sharpshooter Calamity Jane, hot on the trail of a dangerous renegade gang and that she is simply using “Painless” as her cover and unwitting dupe….!\n\nBrightened by Technicolor and lots of slapstick, this burlesque went on to become one of Hope’s best-loved films and his biggest box-office hit. Directed by Norman Z. McLeod (My Favorite Spy) and co-starring Robert Armstrong (King Kong), the film’s popularity inspired a 1952 sequel, Son of Paleface.\n\nHere the expansive bonus package:\n\n-NEW Audio Commentary by Film Historian and Critic Sergio Mims\n\n-Entertaining the Troops\n\n-Command Performance 1945\n\n-“Buttons & Bows” Sing-Along\n\n-Theatrical Trailer\n\n-Optional English Subtitles"
