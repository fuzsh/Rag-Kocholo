        "text": "I am so ignorant about the technical details of old cameras, and film formats.\n\nThe only thing I can do is analyze images of old films and try to deduct things about them.\n\nMy first observation is that I have never seen a background so blurry, a DOF so shallow on a silent film that looks like an f1.4 on a 50mm lens. It seems apertures are much smaller.\n\nHere is a screen capture of a search of 50mm f1.4 portraits. I am converting it to grayscale.\n\nNow let me compare it to some scenes of \"The Kid\" movie. Almost every scene has the background in focus. Even in some scenes that look that were shot from far away using a \"long\" lens. The only exception is the image in the top right corner. But even that looks like can be achieved with let's say f4.\n\nOne reason for this could be that the cinema language has evolved. Using a shallow depth of field is to have more expression, whereas a wider all-in-focus approach would be necessary to capture an overall situation occurring across a scene.\n\nMy second observation is that you do not need a super-sharp lens.\n\nThese two observations, + common sense tell me that you should try shooting some tests with the current gear you have. I am assuming you have a kit lens. Try that one, and try to recreate specific looks, mainly the perspective and the DOF of specific scenes you want to mimic.\n\nWe do not know if you are shooting in exteriors or interiors. Probably it will become more important to turn your attention to illumination setups. Hard lights (because they were very hot)\n\nMakeup is important because of the low dynamic range of the old films.\n\nTry some DIY filters on your current gear. Some vaseline, a silk over the lens. see if there is some filter pack to add imperfections or noise in post.\n\nAlso in post, you will need to adjust the contrast. High contrast, or lower dynamic range is a really distinct feature of old films. That is why makeup was so important Features of the face were lost, so they needed to increase shadows on the eyes and mouth to rescue the expressions of the actors.\n\nSome noise to simulate film grain will also be a good touch.\n\nAlso, keep in mind the aspect ratio.\n\nIMHO, do not get lost in limiting yourself for example using only one fixed focal length. I am assuming you do not have the luxury of building a stage. There are so many parameters to mimic, that no one will notice if you used 30mm or 35, if the light, the contrast, the makeup, is not right.\n\nWhile lenses were on average softer in the era of silent movies than they are now, they are not soft enough to produce the effects you want, at least not the average ones. Anastigmats were readily available by the 20s and many if not virtually all cinematographers were using those designs if not \"better\". Look on Flickr for any picture shot with a Cooke Triplet or a Tessar - I can't say if these were typical for cinema lenses in that day, but the designs were decades old by the 20s and in mass production.\n\nAs for focal length, bear in mind that even \"35mm\" cinema negatives are not always the same size as 35mm still negatives. In your link, David Mullen says these were frequently shot on 4-perf. This is half of an 8-perf 24x36mm negative and half of a modern \"full frame\" sensor. If what he says about focal lengths is true, you'll need to match the perspective/focal length of those lenses on 4-perf instead of full frame.\n\nFor diffusion, many movies were shot using nets. I don't know the evolution exactly, but this started by stretching stockings over lenses to create a pattern that diffracted and softened the image. Stockings are not \"perfect\" distracting materials, and in addition to the softening of the image and the small puffy \"glow\" around highlights, will usually create halations and lower the contrast of the image. I cannot find any information confirming it, but Pandora's Box sure looks like a net to me.\n\nModern brown through white nets will give a similar effect to stockings, although more controllable, and not as strong. Black nets will resist halating and lowering contrast."
