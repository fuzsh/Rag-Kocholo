        "text": "Alternate Title: Judith of Blue Lake Ranch\n\nDirection: Colin Campbell & George C. Bertholon (assistant)\n\nAdapted Scenario: Winifred Dunn\n\nBased on: Judith of Blue Lake Ranch by Jackson Gregory (novel)\n\nProduction Manager: R.J. Tobin\n\nCamera: Dev Jennings\n\nEditing: Pauline Frederick (editing supervisor), Colin Campbell, & Dev Jennings\n\nStudio: Robertson-Cole (Production & Distribution)\n\nPerformers: Pauline Frederick, Tom Santschi, Charles Clary, Dave Winter, Eugene Pallette, Billy Elmer, Jack Curtis, Jim Barley, Sam Appel, Otis Harlan, Clarissa Selwynne, Jean Calhoun, Tom Bates, Lydia Yeamans Titus, Frank Clark, Bud Sterling, Elise Collins, Joseph Singleton, & Stanhope Wheatcroft (not mentioned after release, but listed during production: L.C. Shumway)\n\nPremiere: Opened at Loew’s State Theatre on 3 February 1922; preview screenings for reviewers in NYC, 27 January\n\nStatus: presumed entirely lost\n\nLength: 6 reels, ~6,000 feet (a few sources say 5, most say 6)\n\nSynopsis (synthesized from magazine summaries of the plot):\n\nJudith Sanford (Frederick) inherits the sizable Blue Lake Ranch after the unexpected death of her father. Upon her arrival, she discovers that the ranch’s manager, Trevors (Clary), has been systematically undermining the value of the ranch. Judith confronts him, fires him, and wings him with her pistol as severance.\n\nThe horse foreman, Bud Lee (Santschi), had suspected Trevors’ dirty dealing, but questions if he can work for a woman. Regardless of his doubts, Bud respects Judith’s goals and remains loyal to the ranch.\n\nAs there are still men working on the ranch loyal to Trevors, Judith’s employees are divided. One of Trevors’ hires, Quinnion (Curtis) rebukes Judith and suggests she can’t even ride. She challenges him to bring her a horse he thinks she can’t ride. Judith successfully rides the wild broncho and Quinnion is cowed, leaving the ranch bitterly. The incident wins Judith the respect of the men, including Bud and Carson (Pallette), the cattle foreman.\n\nJudith’s next point of action is tracking down the staff Trevors ousted, most importantly the ranch vet, Doc Tripp (Clark). Tripp returns and uncovers that disease-infected animals have been intentionally introduced to the ranch’s stock. Judith runs Trevors’ vet, Crowdy (Appel), off the ranch.\n\nHampton, a city boy and one-third owner of the ranch, is unhappy when he hears of Trevors’ firing and decides to pay a visit to Blue Lake. (In reality, he’s dodging his creditors.) The visiting socialites are rankled by Judith’s cowgirl togs and no-nonsense demeanor. Alternately, the ultra ladylike Marcia (Calhoun), Hampton’s fiancee, finds a new devotee in Bud.\n\nOn the night of their arrival, Judith learns that the employee she sent to collect the payroll has been robbed. Bud races to the bank overnight to return to pay the staff the following day. As Bud is on his way back, his horse is shot out from under him, but he manages to reach the ranch just in time.\n\nThat night, Bud and Judith set out to track down the bandits and recover the stolen payroll. At a cabin in the mountains, they catch the robber after a shootout and find it’s the discharged vet, Crowdy. They agree to stay overnight to guard the injured Crowdy. To pass the time, Judith pulls a book from an unexpectedly well-stocked library in the cabin and sees that the books belong to Bud! They’re interrupted when Quinnion attacks to save Crowdy and another shootout ensues.\n\nFortunately, Judith’s absence from the ranch was noticed by Hampton. He has mounted up with Bud’s assistant, Tommy, and they arrive in time to save the pair and manage to capture another of Trevors’ agents, Benny (Barley). Benny is locked up, but is freed overnight, meaning there are still more of Trevors’ men lurking. Bud pledges his loyalty to Judith, but then has a romantic foray with Marcia.\n\nDespite the hubbub, the annual Blue Lake dance is held. Carson kits out the workers in suits mail-ordered from Sears-Roebuck, which they accessorise with guns and ammo belts. Bud, it turns out, has a tailored suit of his own that he unpacks and presses for the occasion. He is bewildered when he arrives at the dance and sees a perfectly feminine Judith in a fashionable Parisian gown. Fully enamored with “the real Judith,” Bud whisks her off to the porch and kisses her.\n\nJudith is surprised to find an urgent note from Doc Tripp awaiting her after the dance. The note explains that he has uncovered another Trevors mole and has been wounded. Judith rushes to Tripp, but is waylaid and kidnapped. She manages to remove the mask from one of her abductors and it’s Trevors himself!\n\nThree days pass. Hampton suddenly orders Carson to prepare 500 head of cattle to be sold at a loss. Immediately suspicious, Bud rides to the ranch house and is told that Judith left for San Francisco three days prior. Given Hampton’s fishy assumption of command, Bud and Carson tie him up while they investigate Judith’s real whereabouts. They discover the forged note and confirm with Tripp that he didn’t write it. With mistrust toward Hampton building, they place him under guard and ride to confront Trevors.\n\nIn all that time, Judith has been kept prisoner in the mountains by Quinnion. When Quinnion attacks her, Judith seizes an opportunity to escape, but quickly learns that her prison is set among perilous cliffs. Quinnion gives chase, they struggle, and he plummets to his death. Hopelessly lost and exhausted from her ordeal, Judith makes a last ditch effort for rescue by lighting a signal fire before losing consciousness.\n\nBud and Carson find Trevors and a wild fist fight breaks out. Bud trounces Trevors and Trevors is forced to leave town for good, but not before revealing where he’s hidden Judith. Bud rescues Judith and they all return to the ranch. After they have had time to recover from their respective tribulations, Bud and Judith reunite and embrace.\n\nPoints of Interest:\n\nPauline Frederick made 55 silent feature films in her career. Of those 55 films 45-6 of the films are presumed lost or mostly lost. [One film’s status is unclear ATM.] Of the 9 known to survive, 3 are incomplete (2 are missing at least one reel and the 3rd survives in an abridged cut). Of the surviving 9, three have had home video releases [Three Women (1924), Devil’s Island (1926), and Smouldering Fires (1925)]. Of the 6 surviving films that haven’t had home-video release, 2 have been screened publicly in the past decade [The Love the Lives (1917) and The Moment Before (1916)]. A very rough record for a big star (who didn’t spend most of their career at Fox) to only have a 16-18% survival rate.\n\nWinifred Dunn, prolific writer from a young age working in many genres, wrote/edited 33 silent features, 20 of which are presumed lost.\n\nTwo Kinds of Women was part of the schedule of R-C Pictures’ releases for early 1922. This was a crucial moment in the history of the company, as it was soon after re-organized into F.B.O. The founders exited the company, but so did Pauline Frederick, Sessue Hayakawa, Tsuru Aoki, and Doris May—their biggest stars going into 1922.\n\nWhile the contemporary critical response to TKoW was generally positive and exhibitors across the US and Canada cited good ticket sales, it didn’t leave much of a legacy. At least one contemporary critic, Laurence Reid, considered the film of decent quality but ultimately forgettable. Whether TKoW would have stood the test of time or not, we can’t know. Lost or not, I’m sure the re-organization of TKoW’s distributor affected its potential for long-term popularity. There is at least one instance from after the re-org of a theatre owner receiving a faulty print of the film. So, even by 1923, it was hard to come by a decent print of TKoW.\n\nThe reason I’m confident in placing blame on R-C/F.B.O. is that, of the slate of 20 films they released in late 1921 and early 1922, 16 are currently presumed lost and only 3 appear to be completely extant:\n\nLost: The Lure of Jade, The Sting of the Lash, The Foolish Age, Eden and Return, Five Days to Live, The Vermillion Pencil, A Wife’s Awakening, Silent Years, The Call of Home, The Barricade,Two Kinds of Women, Boy Crazy, Salvage, The Glory of Clementina, Gay and Devilish, and At the Stage Door\n\nExtant: Where Lights Are Low, The Swamp (would live to see this one BTW), and Beyond the Rainbow\n\n☕Appreciate my work? Buy me a coffee! ☕\n\nTranscribed sources & annotations below:\n\npresented chronologically\n\nThe Picturegoer, March 1921\n\nTHEY CALL HER POLLY\n\nPhoto captions: In her pictures Pauline Frederick rarely smiles; in real life she rarely does anything else.\n\nOn the screen she is Pauline Frederick, Queen of Tragedy. But the studio folk call her Polly!\n\nIf you go to interview Pauline Frederick expecting to find the tragic figure she is on the screen, you will be disappointed.\n\nThe play was Madame X. I was watching it at a big theatre—one in which the large symphony orchestra, the lights, and all of the stage hangings combined to lull the senses and to carry you away to suffer or be happy with the heroine.\n\nDistracted for a moment by a remark made by my companion, I happened to look around; and never have I seen an audience more spellbound. They were what you might call pye-eyed. Or, if you prefer, hypnotised. Almost everyone in the great auditorium was sitting absolutely motionless; every eye was riveted to the screen; handkerchiefs were quite in evidence.\n\nA whisper from behind me pierced the silence.\n\n“Those ain’t real tears—they’re glycerine. I know. They’re—”\n\nAt a whispered “s-h-h-h-h!” the comment subsided. But it set me thinking. I began to recall other comments I had heard about Miss Frederick which I happened to know were quite as untrue. “They say she starves herself till she’s in a perfect frenzy,” was one of them. “Before she makes a scene where she’s supposed to look crestfallen they tell her that her last picture was a failure,” was another.\n\nI wondered if a great many of Miss Frederick’s admirers in that audience—and thousands of other audiences—wouldn’t be interested in knowing just what she does do that enables her to reach out from the silent screen and send such waves of feeling over the breathless crowds.\n\nIn one way, though, I rather dreaded the job. You—who have suffered and wept with her, but never interviewed her—may think that to get the fair Pauline to talk about the technique of emotion would be an easy matter. I happened to know better.\n\nIf you go to interview Pauline Frederick, expecting to find her the stately, poised, and almost tragic figure that she is on the screen, you will be disappointed—or, maybe, you will be elated. In her pictures she rarely smiles; in real life she rarely does anything else. At the studio they call her “Polly.” And she doesn’t particularly care about indulging in soul-searching sentiments.\n\nI once stood by as an innocent spectator when a dyed-in-the-wool interviewer approached her and asked what she thought of the advancement of the silent drama.\n\n“For Heaven’s sake,” she whirled on him, “I don’t think anything about it! Ask me something sensible, such as, do I answer my fan mail myself, and we’ll talk!”\n\nSo I leave it to you, how was I going to ask her point blank how she achieved her emotional effects? I didn’t want her Heaven-saking me, but I knew that’s what would happen if I didn’t proceed with caution.\n\nI finally found out what I wanted to know while seated beside her at lunch. But I flatter myself that she didn’t know what was happening. I approached the subject tactfully through the medium of tomato salad, cheese sandwiches, and raisin pie.\n\n“You should have been here yesterday,” she told me, “I was sobbing out my heart from ten in the morning until five in the afternoon with only an asparagus salad at noon to break the monotony. We are making The Mistress Shenstone, and I ruined two handkerchiefs weeping make-up on them.”\n\nWeeping! There was the subject of the interview right in my hand. I wanted to come out in the open and ask her what she thought of the psychology of emotion, but instead I artlessly complimented the tomato salad and followed up by inquiring, nonchalantly, whether or not she had used music to start the flow of tears.\n\n“Yes, I’ve been using music a lot lately,” she answered all unsuspectingly. “I remember I once said that I didn’t think music was necessary or artistic; but I’ve changed my mind since then, and I find that with certain pieces I can get very definite results. Yesterday I had the orchestra playing ‘Jest Wearyin’ for You,’ ‘Waiting for Ships that Never Come In,’ and ‘The Rosary’ all day long. When one of those three pieces is played I can understudy Niobe herself.”\n\nThe conversation, skillfully manipulated, switched to Madame X., the role in which Pauline Frederick so recently surpassed herself.\n\n“Talk about weeping,” she said—although we had really been talking about lemon pie, cause and effects—”at the end of that picture I was a wreck, but it was wonderful! I liked it better than any picture I have ever made. It took us only five weeks to do it, and the reason for its success, I believe, was because it was rushed along at top-speed with every one working on high tension. That, to my mind, is one secret to emotional acting. The heavy scenes should be made as quickly as possible without all this wretched waiting around for electricians to get the lights in order or carpenters to finish up the set. The lights and the sets should be in order so that when you have an emotional scene to do, and are in the mood to do it, everything is in readiness for you.”\n\nWell, anyway, that was one secret, and if the pie held out long enough I had hopes of []ing some of the others. At the risk of being also Heaven-saked I remarked on her wonderful make-up as the dope fiend. “Make-up!” she said, turning on me quickly. “I didn’t have any on.”\n\nI stared at her in amazement. And if you will remember those scenes in which the unfortunate woman drinks absinth and ether, if you recall her haggard face and sunken eyes, you will understand my astonishment at her declaration.\n\n“That is to say,” she qualified, “I had no make-up on other than that which you see on my face to-day.” That make-up to which she called my attention was of the most ordinary sort, with pink “fleshing” and an outer coating of powder, black above her eyes, pencilled eye-brows, and reddened lips. My surprise made me almost sceptical.\n\n“But the lines that were in your face,” I insisted. “And your eyes—they were absolutely blank.” She shrugged her shoulders in a way characteristic of her.\n\n“I felt the part, that’s all,” she said. “More than that, I lived it. If you can make you part get inside of you until it becomes you—you don’t need make-up. Your face will portray the role you are playing. That is what is wrong with so many of the pictures you see on the screen to-day. The actors rely on make-up instead of thought to get their part over.\n\n“The day we made the scenes where I drank absinth and ether in the room at the inn, I came on the set in a sort of daze. We had been working all the night before, and I was utterly and completely exhausted.\n\n“I remember that my director, Frank Lloyd, looked at me rather queerly when he asked if I was ready to make the scene, and I heard my own voice as from a great distance saying, ‘Yes, I guess so.’ I don’t think there was any rehearsal—at least I can’t remember any. I sat down at the table, and to this day I can’t tell you what I did. My one thought was, ‘I mustn’t make it repulsive.’ But outside of that everything was a blank.\n\n“And the huge joke of it was,” she laid her hand on my arm and laughed at the remembrance, “the ether they had me drinking was lemon juice and sugar; and when I finished off that bottle, I was absolutely dopey! Talk about the power of suggestion—”\n\nEMMA-LINDSAY SQUIER\n\nPhoto captions: Above: Polly and “The Picturegoer.”\n\nRight: Pauline Frederick as the screen knows her.\n\nShe takes a keen interest in the mechanical side of her movie work.\n\nNOTE: The Mistress Shenstone (1921, extant at Filmoteca de Catalunya in an abridged form)\n\nMadame X (1920, extant at Eastman House)\n\nMoving Picture World, 17 September 1921\n\nR-C Pictures Visualizes New Year; Foresees Great Film Achievements\n\nOutlining plans for the coming year and giving promise of big achievements, especially in production, the announcement mailed recently by R-C Pictures Corporation to 14,161 exhibitors owning 15,425 theatres, strongly reflects that company’s faith in the future of the industry.\n\nA minimum of twenty-six productions will be made with especial attention to stories and their fitness for the star.\n\nMiss Frederick, who is now at work on “The Lure of Jade,” will star in six subjects. The first will be “The Sting of the Lash,” written by Harvey Gates and directed by Henry King. “The Lure of Jade” will be her second vehicle of the new season. It is based upon the story by Marion Orth, directed by Colin Campbell. Her third will be “Judith of Blue Lake Ranch,” by Jackson Gregory, and there will be three other big society and outdoor pictures.\n\nDoris May, who recently became an R-C star, will be introduced soon in “The Foolish Age.” She will appear in a series of six pictures to be known as Hunt Stromberg Productions. The first will be released in October and is now being directed by William A. Seiter. She will be widely exploited and advertised and will be given a great volume of publicity in newspapers, fan magazines and other publications.\n\nSessue Hayakawa will again be the star in six big productions. His first offering will be “Where Lights Are Low,” written by Lloyd Osborne and directed by Colin Campbell. It will be followed by “The Swamp,” which Hayakawa wrote himself. “The Street of the Flying Dragon,” by Doris T. Goodfellow; “The Vermillion Pencil,” by Homer Lee, and two other productions will be produced during the year.\n\nM. Gasnier, the maker of ‘“Kismet” and other notable productions, will also produce five big pictures. The first to be released will be “A Wife’s Awakening,” with Fritzi Brunette, William P. Carleton and Sam De Grasse. The second will be “Ma’mselle Jo,” from the story by Harriet Comstock. Mr. Gasnier is now at work on this, filming many of his exteriors amid the natural beauties of Lake Tahoe. His third will be “Drifting Souls,” from the novel “Home,” by George Agnew Chamberlain.\n\nFour William Christy Cabanne productions, as a part of the Directors’ Productions series, will be released. The first is “The Barricade,” from the novel by Dr. Daniel Carson Goodman, author of “The Wonder Man.”\n\nNOTE: The Lure of Jade (1921, presumed lost)\n\nThe Sting of the Lash (1921, presumed lost)\n\nThe Foolish Age (1921, presumed lost)\n\nThe Doris May-William Seiter film is probably Eden and Return (1921, presumed lost)\n\nWhere Lights Are Low (1921, extant at CINEMATEK and the Yugoslav Film Archive)\n\nThe Swamp (1921, extant at Gosfilmofond)\n\n“The Street of the Flying Dragon” was released as Five Days to Live (1922, presumed lost)\n\nThe Vermillion Pencil (1922, presumed lost)\n\nKismet (1920, extant)\n\nA Wife’s Awakening (1921, presumed lost)\n\n“Ma’mselle Jo” was released as Silent Years (1921, presumed lost)\n\n“Drifting Souls” was released as The Call of Home (1922, presumed lost)\n\nThe Barricade (1921, presumed lost)\n\nCamera, 1 October 1921\n\nfrom “Pickups By the Staff”\n\nPhil Hubbard is at present playing “Doc Tripp” in “Judith of Blue Lake Ranch,” starring Pauline Frederick.\n\nNOTE: This role was presumably re-cast, as Frank Clark played Doc Tripp in the film.\n\nExhibitor’s Trade Review, 8 October 1921\n\nR-C Pictures Are Booked by Big Circuits\n\nThe R-C Pictures Corporation contract for its entire output of twenty-six special productions is proving a proposition of attractiveness to exhibitors in all parts of the country, judging from the volume of contracts received at the home office.\n\nIn addition to the large number of circuit buyers who have already contracted for the complete program of R-C subjects, many other important circuits fell into line this week and will show their patrons every one of the productions released by R-C Pictures Corporation.\n\nAmong the most important of the big circuits which have contracted for the full program of twenty-six pictures is the Southern Enterprises. The Wells Circuit of the South also has contracted for the full output of R-C subjects as has the Stanley Company of Philadelphia; Ruben and Finklestein of Minneapolis and the Harry Grampp circuit.\n\nIncluded in the group of twenty-six pictures will be the Pauline Frederick series, the first of which is “The Sting of the Lash” written by Harvey Gates and directed by Henry King. Her second starring production will be “The Lure of Jade,” which has just been completed under the capable direction of Colin Campbell. The story is by Marion Orth. “Judith of Blue Lake Ranch” by Jackson Gregory will be the third and there will be three other stories for Miss Frederick.\n\nThe first of the series of Doris May pictures is scheduled for release October 16, on which day the National Doris May Joy Week will be observed throughout the country. Miss May’s initial starring vehicle will be “The Foolish Age,” written for her by Hunt Stromberg. Other May productions will follow.\n\nThe first of the Sessue Hayakawa productions is “Where Lights Are Low,” already being played on the big circuits throughout the country. It was written by Lloyd Osborne and directed by Colin Campbell. It will be followed by “The Swamp,” “The Street of the Flying Dragon” and others of equally strong drawing power.\n\nL. J. Gasnier, the noted French director, and William Christy Cabanne also will supply R-C patrons with a series of subjects.

Allow us to present some one you have always known—to be different.\n\nBy Gordon Gassaway\n\nPhoto caption: Pauline has changed forever from a down-Easterner to a dyed-in-the-wool out-Westerner.\n\nNEVER again will Pauline Frederick play roles which call for doubtful doings, for questionable pasts, and lurid presents. She has shed the Zazas, Fedoras, Mrs. Danes, and Irises with whom she climbed to fame as a butterfly sheds its drab cocoon, and so far as Pauline is concerned all her future roles are to be as sweet as that of Little Eva.\n\nWhen we met for the very first time, in the luxurious managerial offices of the neat, flower-bedecked Robertson-Cole studios in Hollywood, a small figure garbed in riding breeches and coat jumped from a deeply upholstered chair to greet me. It was Miss Frederick, and she extended a slim, tanned hand which took mine in a grip which might be termed a knuckle cracker. Where I had expected to find a languorous lady of haughty mien, garbed in a low and behold gown, the sort of lady who looks as though she has a past, I found a blithesome, girlish imp with a Western frankness you could almost scrape off.\n\n“You are just in time to hear about my next picture,” she exclaimed. “I’m going to make a real ‘Western’ with cowboys and lariats and a big ranch. I’m so happy about it I can hardly sit still!”\n\nPauline Frederick playing the role of a Western ranch hound! Could this be the same actress, I muttered to myself, who had given us the vibrant Iris, the zippy Zaza, and the dubious Mrs. Dane? I could remember her in slinky gown, with narrowed eyes and many jewels and in the black shawl of the sorrowful Madame X, but it took a mental right-about-face to visualize her in the great, open spaces of the West.\n\n“What’s the big idea?” I stammered inelegantly. “What is it that has worked this change in you? We thought you were a thoroughly Ritzed N’Yorker, epitomizing Fifth Avenue, and all of a sudden here you are bubbling with Western enthusiasm minus all camouflage, and about to play a real outdoors Western story. How come?”\n\n“Horses!” she replied with her famous smile, which is as inclusive as June sunshine.\n\nThere is no doubt about it, cow ponies have worked a miracle in the life of Pauline Frederick—Boston’s fairest flower. Of course Will Rogers has had something to do with it. Oh, no, she has no matrimonial designs on Will; he just taught her how to “rope,” and he plays hooky from the studio to come over and play cow-puncher in her back yard. He has been a part of the great Western ameliorating process which has changed Pauline forever from a down-Easterner to a dyed-in-the-wool out-Westerner.\n\nSans lip rouge, sans powder, sans hairdress, sans every feminine first aid to beauty, save a brilliant manicure, she greeted me with a cowboy yip-ay-aye upon our second meeting. This was on the day I had flivvered out to her Beverly Hills estate to see her as is. She came galloping across a broad field rimmed with eucalyptus, and I knew that she was mistress of all she surveyed, for she has spent money in California with lavish hand when it comes to increasing her private domain so that she and her hard-riding friends would have plenty of space for their petit rodeos.\n\nEvery day’s a rodeo in the life of Pauline Frederick now. She staged one for my benefit that late afternoon of which I speak. I was carried to the opposite side of the broad acres adjoining her luxurious home, riding “double” on a pony behind her uncle and manager, Mr. Pettingill. Deposited in the shade of the eucalyptus rim, I found a seat on an upturned barrel and grandly ordered the ropin’ to commence. In the little group before me were the men who attend to the Frederick requirements in the way of stabling and grooming the wiry ponies she rides, Miss Frederick herself—and Uncle Pettingill, That was all. And then she started to rope. She roped everything from a barrel to uncle. And I am here to say that she throws a mean lariat! Will Rogers has taught her thoroughly and well, and one of her grooms is a cowboy roper of no small ability. Besides which, she is at it, they told me, from early morning until dusk. She doesn’t know what the mystic “tea hour” is any more. And she gets up with the dawn to go out and see the ponies eat their breakfast grapefruit or whatever it is they feed cow horses.\n\nWestern winds and California zephyrs are sweeping the memories of a rather hectic career from the fair Pauline’s mental pabulum. She is through with vicarious marriage, with late parties and with society snickers and snickerers, her uncle confided to me as we sat on adjoining barrels and watched the Mistress of Shenstone toss a snaky spiral of rope about two horses as they galloped abreast across the field. She abhors the sight of a newspaper. She feels that all news sheets are enemies of hers.\n\n“They never print anything nice about me,” she said later as we perched atop the brick wall which separates her “rodeo field” from the magnificent gardens of her home. “It is only the unhappinesses to which they give space. I no longer have time or patience to read headlines of murders, divorces, and filth. My horses and the pictures take all my time.”\n\n“Are you going back to stage?” I asked rather fatuously, since this has been a moot question for some weeks in Hollywood anent the penitent Pauline.\n\n“I can go back on the stage with a sixty-day notice to my company,” she replied rather seriously, I thought, “and if I can find a rip-snorting good play, there is no telling what I might do. An animate audience affects me like a herd of cattle affects my ponies—I’m rarin’ to go!”\n\nEven her vocabulary has undergone a change out West. She has adopted the chatter of the corral, and it falls naturally from her lips as you see her wearing her natty little leather “chaps” and her cowboy shirt, but the soft, cultured modifications of her voice give Boston a boost every time she speaks.\n\nMiss Frederick is allowed to choose her own stories for the screen. It was she who elected to do “Madame X,” and a hot time she had of it persuading the studio to sanction the deed. It was she who selected “The Lure of Jade,” that torrid South Seas story, and “The Sting of the Lash.” And now she has made a real ‘‘Western,” as Westerny as anything Tom Mix ever got mixed up in.\n\nWhat will she do next? There was a time when the New York reporters were asking this question, but for a far different reason. Now it refers only to the expansion of her cinema repertoire, for there is apparently nothing at which this marvelous actress hesitates when it comes to characterizations. I feel that she would not balk at slapstick comedy if she thought she would get a kick out of it—or that the public which she loves would like it.\n\nPhoto captions: When she gallops out across her fields, she is mistress of all she surveys, for she has spent money with a lavish hand to provide plenty of space for her rodeos.\n\nPauline Frederick practices with her lariat from morning until night.\n\nIn an attempt to finally settle the reason for this remarkable return to the soil of one of America’s greatest drawing-room beauties, I asked, as we wended our way toward the house through the twilight shadows:\n\n“Are you a throwback? Were, perhaps, some of your family farmers or Western ranchers?”\n\n“Yes,” she replied. “My grandfather was a farmer in northern New York State. My family are really of the soil, but I was born in Boston. My style was cramped after I went on the stage in N’York, and I became as much of a drawing-room drone as any of the rest of them there, but I see now that my heart always longed for the outdoors. In California I have found a larger and more real outdoors than ever existed in northern New York State. My family was not a stage family at all. I was ‘just a nice girl from Boston,’ and then I took up the theater because it gave me the widest possible scope for the outlet of my temperament. And now the pictures give me even a greater horizon.\n\n“I am happier than I have been ever in my life. The past can bury itself so far as I am concerned. I want to be left alone with my ponies and my picture work. I am not discussing the private affairs of other people, and why should they bother with mine?”\n\nBut one gathers the idea that there will be no more “private affairs” so far as Pauline Frederick is concerned. The slate is clean. Oxygen and ozone are great purifiers of pasts, and ozone is Pauline’s middle name. Her greatest pleasure, outside of straddling a horse in the good old Western way, is to spend the afternoon downtown in Los Angeles shopping. And is she purchasing ribbons and hair nets and perfume and cosmetics? She is not! She is buying bridles and new cinches that will not rub the ponies’ tummies, and chaps and gauntlets. She only wears one evening gown in her new Western ranch picture, and her modiste had an awful time getting her to “sit” for that.\n\nPerhaps her manner of extending hospitality is the best indication of her great Westernization. After our petit rodeo that afternoon she invited me, a poor reporter, to “stop for dinner.” In New York they would never do that, but on a Western ranch the most casual acquaintance is never turned out into the twilight —hungry. Of course one doesn’t accept, and it was with the memory of her little cowboy “Aye-yip-ay” ringing in my ears that I left.\n\nNOTE: Zaza (1915, presumed lost)\n\nFedora (1918, presumed lost)\n\nMrs. Dane’s Defense (1918, presumed lost)\n\nI guess Frederick must have been on a bit of a Western bent at that moment in time as The Sting of the Lash had been released in the fall of 1921 and TKoW was about to be released when this article was published. Oddly, this article is definitely referring to TKoW as the western Frederick was making, but never states the title of the film!\n\nThis article implies that making movies was just more fun for Frederick at the time than theatre work, which other sources, including interviews and various secondary sources reiterate. She was obviously still interested in theatre, but was committed to sticking where she was having the most fun. Sure enough, when sound came to movies, Frederick didn’t enjoy film work anymore and she returned to the stage. She really had such an interesting career trajectory!\n\nIf you’re wondering about the intimations about her private life made in this article, Frederick had already been married and divorced twice when this article was written and she would marry her third husband later that year. That marriage would also end in divorce in 1924.\n\nChecked up on Frederick’s family and her mother’s family, the Fishers, were in fact farmers in Madrid, NY, a town near the Canadian border.\n\nCamera, 7 January 1922\n\nR-C STUDIO.

On the contrary preparations are being made for increased activity shortly after the first of the year. The following official statement was given out at R-C offices:\n\n“It has been decided not to start any new productions during the Christmas holidays because of the thoroughly human penchant of actors for seasonal enjoyments away from work at that time of the year. But the R-C organization will be expected to make up for lost time in the first few weeks of 1922.\n\nPrepares Two Pictures for Publication\n\n“Sessue Hayakawa has two productions which are now being prepared for release. ‘Five Days to Live,’ which was made under the name, ‘In the Street of the Flying Dragon,’ and in which the star is supported by his wife, Tsuru Aoki, has received the final touches of the film editors and a finished print is being awaited.\n\n“Final scenes in ‘The Vermilion Pencil’ in which Hayakawa is supported by Bessie Love, will be completed within a few days, and the star is expected to start upon another picture about January 9.\n\nCut Frederick Picture\n\n“Pauline Frederick is also supervising the cutting of her latest production, ‘Two Kinds of Women,’ adapted from Jackson Gregory’s novel, ‘Judith of Blue Lake Ranch.’ Miss Frederick will begin work January 9 on a film presentation of William J. Locke’s novel, ‘The Glory of Clementina.’ Two other big stories, both written directly for the screen, have been purchased for Miss Frederick.\n\n“Doris May is nearing the close of her third R-C starring vehicle, ‘Boy Crazy.’ She will be started upon her next picture, ‘Gay and Devilish,’ about the same time the Hayakawa and Frederick companies begin work again.\n\nLeaving for New York\n\n“R.

He had live [sic] to realize his dream, to see his daughter emerge from hoydenish girlhood to cultured, beautiful womanhood. Then had come his untimely death. The ranch is left to Judith, but Bayne Trevors the ranch manager has planned to get control of the property.\n\nInto this hostile atmosphere comes Judith to take control of the ranch. The cowboys are surprised, some of them admire Judith’s pluck, others side with Trevors. Trevors gets nasty with Judith and she clips his arms with a bullet, after she has discharged him for trying to sell a string of fine horses for a tithe of their real value.\n\nBud Lee, horse foreman has in the meantime refused to “crowd the horses over to the Western Lumber Company”, who are in leage [sic] with Trevors, hoping to gather in the million dollar property for a quarter of its value, and make a cleanup on its splendid timber reserves.\n\nJudith assumes full control of the property and is immediately confronted by a divided camp—enemies within, among her own employes [sic] making even life itself unsafe on the property. A few loyal and true to the daughter of their old employer whom they had idolized.\n\nLuke Sanford has lavished a fortune on the farmhouse to make it a suitable and beautiful home for his daughter. Her eyes take in every detail of the old place with loving wistfulness, as old Jose, the half-breed Mexican servant enters.\n\nJudith goes to the cook shack to get food, and all the men but Lee leave without finishing their meal. Lee is about to follow, when she asks him to remain, He admires her direct methods but disapproves of such methods in a woman, he considering that they are not “ladylike”.\n\nShe asks him if he is allied with the crooks, and he says he is not, but that he is going “on his own”. She asks him to stay. He agrees to remain until she can get another foreman.\n\nHearing Trevors urging the men to leave, she confronts him and them. She tells them that she has shot Trevors because he had tried to man-handle her. Carano, the cattle-foreman instantly takes sides with her. Quinnion, ugly and crooked-faced, sneers openly. She tells him to “put up or shut up”. He says that she couldn’t even ride a horse. She defies him to bring a horse she can’t ride, and he takes her at her word, bringing a wild broncho that had never been mastered. Judith rides the horse to victory, breaking the animal’s spirit. Then she orders Quinnion to either ride the horse or leave the ranch. He is afraid, and moves off, threatening to “get even”.\n\nJudith wins the admiration of Bud Lee who becomes a loyal helper. Others of the old force hired by her father rally to her support. She locates many of the old force whom Trevors has fired, as possible, and hires them at their old jobs. Among these is the veterinarian, who had served for years. He reports to her that disease has broken out among the livestock, as soon as he gets back on the job. Diseased stock had been imported by Trevors to ruin the flocks and herds, and thus hasten the destruction of the property.\n\nJudith calls Carson into the ranch office and asks him if he has had a fight in some time. He says he has not. She says he will have his chance for a real battle if he will stay by her. He agrees. His first job is to clear the ranch of Trevor’s men.\n\nJudith rests an hour in a rose bowered boudoir which faithful Jose has prepared for her. She has phoned to the nearest town for a maid and housekeeper. They arrive on the ranch.\n\nAfter a brief rest she plunges into the task before her. Mounting her horse she rides to the lower end of the ranch and finds that Dan Crowdy, who had replaced Dr. Tripp, her father’s veterinarian, is giving sulphur fumes to calves suffering from lung worms. She orders the treatment discontinued, and later finds that Crowdy had turned diseased calves among the healthful ones. Crowdy is fired, and Tripp takes charge of the situation.\n\nReturning to the ranch house, she goes to answer a telephone bell and finds Quinnion spying on her, Hampton, owner of a third interest has wired disapproval of Trevor’s discharge and has telegraphed that he and a party of friends are on the way to the ranch for a short stay. These guests arriving a few days later are dismayed by Judith’s appearance in her riding clothes, chaps and broad brimmed hat. The women are particularly disdainful. Hampton has come to evade his creditors. The members of the party are Marcia Longworthy Hampton’s fiance; her father, Major Langworth; and her aunt Mrs. Grimley.\n\nMarcia Langworthy strikes up a pitiful sort of friendship with Bud Lee who is blinded by her feminine graces and pretty clothes. Judith sees the bye-play between Marcia and Bud and is scornful. Carson asks Judith if she has money on hand for the monthly payday is at hand. She is puzzled and tells him that Miller had gone for it the night before. Dr. Tripp calls her later on the telephone and tells her Miller had been held up and robbed. Bud comes in and suggests a plan to have the money on hand by 5 o’clock, the customary pay hour. Bud goes.\n\nHampton is entertaining guests on the front porch when she arrives again at the ranch house. Among his guests is Trevors. She is furious and turns cold at his diabolical cunning. She is determined he shall not outwit her, so she telephones orders for relays of fresh horses for Bud. Bud rides thunderingly toward the ranch with the money he has obtained from the bank when a bullet kills his horse. He runs pantingly to his next relay point, mounts and is off again. He arrives safe, and the men are paid on time.\n\nThe dinner hour comes and the guests are carefully dressed. Judith alone is not at the table. With a rifle on her arm she has gone bandit hunting. She finds Bud Lee on a similar mission. He tries to send her back to the ranch but she will not give up her chase. Judith remembers an old cabin in the mountains and suggests that the robbers may be hiding there. They go to the cabin and find the tracks of a man. They are tracking him when a concealed enemy opens fire on them. Bud is wounded slightly. They put up a game fight, and wound the man who had fired at them. It is Crowdy, who had been fired. They drag him into the cabin and find the Blue Lake Ranch payroll money in a bag at his belt.\n\nBack at the ranch Hampton is beginning to worry over Judith and at length leaves with Tommy, one of the boys, to find her.\n\nJudith impresses upon Bud that Crowdy will prove an invaluable witness and there’s nothing to do but guard him until morning. Bud agrees reluctantly. The cabin is neat and comfortable and there are a few first class books on the shelf, Judith picks one up and turning the flyleap [sic] finds that the book—and the cabin—are Bud’s. He looks sheepishly away.\n\nQuinnion lays siege to the cabin and demands Crowdy’s release. They tell him to come and get him. He fires at them. She and Bud fight shoulder to shoulder, shot for shot. Other shots are heard in the distance. It is Hampton and Tommy coming to the rescue. Crowdy attempts to escape and is shot Hampton captures his confederate Benny the cook. Benny is taken back to the ranch and locked in the grain house but during the night someone on the outside liberates him. Judith lets Trevors know that his henchmen have been captured and has the satisfaction of seeing his apprehension.\n\nThe next day Bud tells her that he is going to stick through with her to the end of the game—and that they’ll win if it’s in human power to win. Hampton and Judith are alone together, and Hampton half proposes to her while Bud has a foolish interlude with Marcia.\n\nThe date for the annual Blue Lake dance approaches. Carson orders twenty five dress suits, assorted sizes, from an Eastern mail order house. They arrive and the cowpunchers and horse wranglers dress in them in the most outlandish combinations of ranch clothes, guns, ammunition belts and dress clothing that can be imagined. The dance is a success. Bud digs out a dress suit from his trunk and presses it, after changing his mind several times as to whether or not he wants to go to the dance. He really wants to see Marcia in her pretty clothes, and expects to see Judith in chaps and sombrero.\n\nJudith enters from the balcony, a vision of loveliness in a Parisian creation as beautiful as it is becoming. Bud tells himself he has been cheated—that his is the real Judith and that he had never guessed it. She dances that first dance with Bud—and he has forgotten Marcia. Bud leads her from the crowded room to the porch. Bud snatches her to his arms and kisses her.\n\nThe dance over, Judith goes to her room. She finds a note from Dr. Tripp saying her [sic] has been shot through the hand by one of Trevors’s men. She leaves for his cabin, but is waylaid, dragged from her horse and led into the mountain wilderness. The note was a forgery. Two masked men were her captors. She leaps on an impulse, and snatches the mask from the face of the man nearest her. It was Trevors!\n\nThree days later Hampton rides briskly down the cattle headquarters and orders Carson to drive 500 beef cattle. Hampton says it is Miss Sanford’s instructions. Bud Lee goes to the house to make an investigation and conform [sic] the order. He is told that Judith had gone to San Francisco three days earlier. Bud finds Hampton at Judith’s desk, having assumed authority. He is suspicious. He says he will not sell a head of stock without Judith’s personal order. They return to the house and take Hampton by surprise. Bud telephones to the telegraph office and orders him to communicate with every hotel in San Francisco and get Miss Sanford in touch with the ranch.\n\nBud and Carson got to Judith’s room. Hampton having turned nasty, they drag along. They look for a clue to the mystery and find the letter purported to have come from Tripp. Bud gets in touch with Tripp to telephone and learns that Tripp was not injured and did not write the note. Hampton is gagged and bound and made prisoner in Bud’s cabin. Tommy is left on guard.\n\nJudith has been locked in a dark, windowless shack for three days and nights, with Quinnion on guard. Trevors came to caunt [sic] her from time to time. Quinnion attacked her and she defended herself with a club. Escaping him she dashed from the cabin to the sheer wall of a cliff that dropped hundreds of feet, Feeling her way carefully she began the descent. Then she heard Quinnion following. She dropped to a ledge twenty feet below. He slid to her side. There was a sharp struggle and he pitched headlong into space.\n\nCarson and Bud go to the offices of Western Lumber Company and find Trevors and Melvin, a confederate. Carson warns Bud to be careful for Trevors is treacherous. Bud and Trevors fight like mad dogs. Trevors uses his heel on Bud’s hand in a wrestling struggle. Carson tries to interfere by Trevors’ friend friend holds him back. Trevors has the advantage but Bud knows he has to win, Trevors levels a brutal kick at Bud’s stomach but Bud outwits him gripping him with his knees while with his sound hand he throttles Trevors. Trevors gasps Judith’s whereabouts, and Bud Leaps to his feet to go save Judith.\n\nJudith has fallen in a stupor in a tangle of weeks. She rises and tries to get her bearings. She is lost but she is freed. She is probably 50 miles from home but she strikes off in what she hopes if [sic] the right direction. Her knees given way under her, A tall pine oozing with pitch stands in a little clearing. This is her one chance. Taking the single match she had found in the cabin, she starts a gignal [sic] fire.\n\nShe is wakened from a deep sleep of exhaustion by the sound of Lee crashing through the under-brush. She pretends to sellop[?]. She feels his arms slipping tenderly under her and drawing her in his close embrace. Holding her like a child in his arms he mounts his horse and starts for home. Bud gives her into the care of Mrs. Simpson and leaves. Going back to the bunk house, he dresses his wounds and begins to pack his kit. Old Carson is amazed, but with astonishing diplomacy he induces Bud to see that he should call and inquire about Judith.\n\nHe finds her in the great living room, pale, but lovelier than ever. She comes toward him. He stares at her blankly then suddenly she is in his arms. She clings to him a moment, then tenderly touching his hand and his bruised face, she says “ I know all about it—Carson told me.” Nestling her head against his shoulder, she has a heart-felt cry. Bud Lee, looking happily down at her seems about to say, but doesn’t—”it always does ladies good to cry.”\n\nTHE END\n\nNOTE: I’m glad I read the novel before this because, even though I can’t see the finished product, this synopsis shows how skilled and efficient Winifred Dunn was at adapting prose for the screen. The only major changes in evidence here involve the climax being more focused on Judith than Bud, which makes sense both because Judith’s abduction and escape has more compelling action to it and also because, in purely practical terms, Frederick was the star of the film, not Santschi.\n\nNow, one thing I do wonder if Dunn & Co. preserved from the book is the mildly suggested homo-erotic tension between Marcia and Judith?\n\nVariety, 3 February 1922\n\nFrom “FILM REVIEWS”\n\nTWO KINDS OF WOMEN\n\nJackson Gregory’s “Judith of Blue Lake Ranch” is the novel from which Robertson-Cole have supplied the latest film for Pauline Frederick featuring, it appearing under the title of “Two Kinds of Women,” shown at Loew’s State for the first half of the week.\n\nIt’s a “western,” but not the western of the old type, that of the rolling plains, the dead-shot sheriff and the types of the wild and wooly. It is set in the Sierras, with some picturesque long-shots here and there and one lake scene that is a scintillating exception. That footage is a night scene, the lake surface being so softly pictured that it resembled glowing white satin.\n\nJudith Sanford (Miss Frederick) arrives at Blue Lake Ranch, which is devoted to horse breeding, some time after the death of her father. She has traveled far and wide as surcease to her grief. But getting down to business, she has a pretty good idea that Bayne Trevors, the ranch manager, is not on the level. She believes with good proof that he has been selling colts to a favored company for a nominal price. So it’s curtains for Trevors when she takes the reins. Some of the camp bunch vamp with the manager, but Bud Lee, the horse foreman, a college man by the way, sticks with the regulars.\n\nNot being an old type western, this ranch house has most of the conveniences of a country show place. Judith’s long residence in San Francisco makes it natural that she hold a dance, with guests from the coast cities. The ranch boys are invited, which permits a telling bit of comedy to be introduced. One of them writes to Sears-Roebuck for a mess of “evening dresses for men—assorted sizes—ages 20 to 50, everything complete from tail to horn.”\n\nThere are three fight episodes through the five reels. One has Judith and Bud Lee hunting down some of the ex-ranch men, turned bandits at Trevors’ orders. The payroll had been taken that, according to the story, is all-important to Judith, whose men would walk out if not paid off on the six o’clock bell. Money is secured from the bank in the meantime. The battle with the bandits takes the couple up and down rocky crags, with a successful but not especially thrilling action.\n\nThe second scrap is one in which Judith battles against a bestial guard, after having been decoyed and hidden away by the Trevors gang. The third has Bud Lee handing the villainous Trevors a lacing and extracting the promise of leaving the country. Judith resting at the ranch house after the terrifying ordeal in a shack under guard is waiting—for Bud and happiness.\n\nEmotionally, Miss Frederick’s fire is not given the opportunity of some of her other roles. Her Judith is a somewhat tired girl, even though there is undeniable determination in the character. The early scenes between her and Bud show the flint of skepticism on both sides. He tells her there are two kinds of women, She answers “Some that can and some that can’t.” Thomas Santschi builds a strong Bud, but a rather solemn one. That in a way matches Miss Frederick’s direct manner. Charles Clary as Trevors is smooth, but always working in the background, as called for in the story.\n\n“Two Kinds of Women” is a different kind of western and interesting. Colin Campbell has directed well. There are no lagging moments, Apparently the picture was retitled plentifully, some of the titles only being illuminated and holding the R-C seal.\n\nIbee\n\nNOTE: More than one review brings up this one particular night shot of a lake as especially beautiful.

A large and efficient cast appears in her support.\n\nExhibitors Herald, 4 February 1922\n\nfrom “REVIEWS”\n\nPAULINE FREDERICK IN\n\nTWO KINDS OF WOMEN\n\n(R-C PICTURES)\n\nA well produced, convincing story of the West, picturing the struggles of a woman suddenly thrust into the business of running a cattle ranch. One of the best vehicles Miss Frederick has had in some time. Six reels of well-sustained action. Directed by Colin Campbell.\n\nPauline Frederick makes a very appealing and real Western woman in the role of Judy Sanford, the proprietress of a large ranch, in this story which has been very cleverly worked out. It tells of a business feud between rival factions attempting to gain possession of the property. Judy takes possession and through the loyalty of Carson and Danny Lee; her foreman, they thwart the efforts of Bayne Trevors and his gang to demoralize the ranch hands and sell the property. Trevor’s gang holds up and robs the paymaster at Judy’s ranch, but Danny Lee gets other money in time to pay off the men. Then he proceeds to hunt up the thief and eventually finds he is one of Trevors’ men. An amusing bit is the dance given at Judy’s Blue Lake Ranch, at which everyone is supposed to wear full dress. The cowboys, through a mail order house, come fully and wonderfully equipped. There are several realistic fistic encounters between Danny and the villain, Trevors, and between Pollock Hampton and Trevors man.\n\nThe acting is very good all around. Miss Frederick gives her usual excellent performance and is ably supported by David Winter, as Hampton and Tom Santschi as Danny Lee. A good comedy bit is contributed by Eugene Pallette as Carson. Charles Clary is the villain.\n\nThe scenic effects are very good indeed and the photography of a fine quality.\n\nNOTE: “realistic fistic encounters” is a wonderful phrase.\n\nExhibitors Herald, 4 February 1922\n\nPhoto caption: WINIFRED DUNN, who adapted “Silent Years,” the L.J. Gasnier production, and also “Two Kinds of Women,” Pauline Frederick’s latest R-C Picture vehicle.\n\nMotion Picture News, 4 February 1922\n\nThe Billboard, 4 February 1922\n\n“TWO KINDS OF WOMEN”\n\nStory by Jack Gregory, scenario by Winifred Dunn, directed by Colin Campbell, starring Pauline Frederick, released by R-C. Pictures Corporation, shown in projection room, New York, January 27.\n\nReviewed by MARION RUSSELL\n\nA totally different picture for Pauline Frederick. She does full justice to the\n\nvigorous character of a ranch woman and proves her ability to portray a typically dominating Westerner.\n\nTHE CRITICAL X-RAY\n\nWe are constrained to say that the title is a misnomer, for at no time are we convinced of the other side of the woman’s character. Captioned as “Two Kinds of Women,” Miss Frederick impersonates only one feminine role. Perhaps the author intended to show glimpses of her dual nature by interpolating the softness of a real womanly heart. But it is evident to the beholder that Judith Sanford is simply a straight, out-and-out sensible woman. It is not necessary for her to be a rough-and-ready type in order to control a band of roughneck cattle rustlers. That she does subdue them, stamps the fact in our minds that a woman’s dominance over rough undisciplined males is not to be sneezed at.\n\nThe picture contains a number of villains, society men and hardened brutes who conspire to rob Judith of the big ranch inherited from her father. She is in possession of two-third interest in the entire business, but the remaining share of one-third, is held by Pollock Hampton, a wasteful society drone. Arriving at the big house she learns that Bayne Trevor, the ranch manager, is secretly allied with the Western Lumber Company, a rival concern which is endeavoring to despoil Judith of the ranch by running her into debt and buying out for a fraction of the value of her property. Trevor has replaced her father’s faithful employees with his own gang of crooked men. Bud Lee, foreman, is one of the faithful but objects to women doing men’s work. Judith finds it necessary to use rough methods with the gang and discharges Trevor and a number of the other malcontents. Trevor, later on, has his men rob the pay-roll carrier, which gives Bud Lee an opportunity to prove his friendship for the mistress of the ranch by braving all dangers, recovering the money in time to settle with the men. For a little diversion, a ranch ball is held, in which Judith appears in a magnificent evening gown, electrifying her guests and workmen by the beauty of her appearance. Later Trevor’s men kidnap her by a ruse and hold her captive in a lonely cabin. After great suffering she escapes, while her pursuer accidently falls to his death. Bud Lee, with a searching party, finds her half-crazed among the rocks of the desert. He rounds up Trevor and his accomplices, driving the clique of conspirators away from the ranch. Judith, realizing the manliness of her foreman, gives him her band in marriage.\n\nThis is a better grade of Western melodrama, full of action and a lot of hard riding. It is only once or twice in the middle of the story that the action slumps and it seems an effort for the scenarioist to pick up the threads and add another reel or two of suspense. The outcome of the story is obvious, but there is sufficient entertaining qualities embodied to please the average theatergoer. The cowboys supply a lot of comedy and the men entrusted with these minor roles bear the names of some very clever actors. Therefore they carried the various scenes with a great deal of realism. This afforded a relief from the tension of the dramatic action in which the star was constantly prominent. Miss Frederick looked very fetching in riding togs, sombrero and leather chaps. She played with a vigor and firmness that made the role of the sorely-tried heroine stand out vividly.\n\nA splendid supporting cast was noted, in which Tom Santschi, as the foreman-hero, gave one of his virile and interest-holding impersonations, He also rides as tho born to the saddle.\n\nCharles Clary, Dave Winter, Eugene Pallette, Billy Elmer, Clarissa Selwynne, Lydia Yeamana Titus, Stanhope Wheatcroft and others helped to round out the interesting picture.\n\nSUITABILITY\n\nAll theaters.\n\nENTERTAINMENT VALUE\n\nGood.\n\nThe Film Daily, 5 February 1922\n\nPauline Frederick the “Boss” of a Ranch in Latest Feature\n\nPauline Frederick in\n\n“TWO KINDS OF WOMEN”\n\nR-C Pictures\n\nDIRECTOR ………….

Woman ranch owner, with the help of a loyal superintendent, successfully fights partner and former boss, who try to get the ranch for themselves\n\nLENGTH OF PRODUCTION….. About 6,000 feet\n\nThe situation in the main is not unfamiliar, but by reversing it and having a he-woman instead of a he-man as the boss of the ranch they succeed in making “Two Kinds of Women” a good western offering that should please many. It is a little out of the ordinary to have a woman playing a regular hero role, but Pauline Frederick makes the part of Judith Sanford both convincing and impressive, and it is a good bit different from anything she has appeared in lately.\n\nDirector Campbell offers an attractive atmosphere and tells the story evenly and in a manner that holds the attention nicely all the way through. He does not bid for much suspense, although there are several opportunities where it might have improved the action somewhat if the spectator were less certain as to what the outcome was going to be. For instance, it is evident very early in the story that Tom Santschi will help Pauline in her fight with Trevors (played by Charles Clary), former boss of the ranch. A little doubt as to Santschi’s leaning would have been better.\n\nThere is but one incident in the development that seems a bit incomprehensive and that is just why Pauline should tolerate her enemy as a guest in her home. She was two-thirds proprietor and owner and had the ruling hand. The climax works up a fair degree of action and there is interspersed comedy touches and one humorous sequence that provides some laughs even if the incident itself is a bit far-fetched—the ranch hands attending a formal dance in evening clothes bought from a mail order house.\n\nJudy Sanford takes over the management of the ranch in which her late father had a third share. She buys out another owner and holds two votes to Hampton’s (the other owner) one. Trevors, superintendent, refusing to bow to Judy’s orders, is fired, while Bud Lee, foreman, admires Judy and remains. Trevors then attacks Judy in various ways finally by robbing her pay-roll carrier. That fails to stop Judy and he kidnaps her. Meanwhile, Hampton, in league with Trevors, plans to sell the ranch in her absence. Lee is told by Hampton and Trevors that Judy is in San Francisco. Lee starts investigating and eventually rescues Judy. Together they return in time to save the ranch, give the conspirators what is due them and complete their growing romance.\n\nAverage Offering With Pleasing Atmosphere. Should Satisfy\n\nBox Office Analysis for the Exhibitor\n\nIt might be well to boost this picture from the peculiar angle of the story, or the reversing of the hero situation. Say: “Instead of the usual he-man ‘boss’ of the ranch, see how Pauline Frederick handles the job. Her latest picture will show you what the ‘Two Kinds of Women’ are.” Or, “Is the management of a ranch a man’s job or can a woman do it? Let Pauline Frederick show you the answer at the blank theater.”\n\nThe star’s last picture was “The Sting of the Lash,” should you care to recall it. The title of this one will probably attract considerable attention and might be more effective if worked in conjunction with a teaser campaign prior to the showing. The R-C publicity sheets will provide details for this purpose.\n\nNOTE: Before this title caught my eye for this series, I only had second-hand knowledge of Pauline Frederick—since so many of her films are lost, that’s not too surprising. But, I watched the three silents of hers that I could find and read about a few others and Frederick quickly became a compelling star. Frederick’s roles were highly varied and she was so well respected by exhibitors, despite quite a lot of her films (seemingly) having a feminist bent. The ranch might be an uncommon setting for Frederick, but Judith seems to have had more than a few things in common with other characters Frederick took on. Judith is a character that is capable in the face of challenges both professional and personal but also multi-dimensional, she’s not simply a hero, but also someone who has flaws and with whom you can sympathize.\n\nIt’s also interesting to consider her in comparison to Nazimova, who was a contemporary who also got into movies relatively late—both starting on stage. Obviously Frederick wasn’t quite as creatively ambitious as Nazimova, but the way they are treated in the press and trades is so wildly different. I’d have to dig deeper to know for sure if it was a matter of xenophobia or a response to differences in star image (Frederick’s being dignified but down-to-earth, Nazimova’s being artsy and intellectual, though also dignified). It also could be something purely mercenary as expense of film rentals made a big difference in the way distributors/exhibitors responded to the work. I don’t have any conclusions to draw yet, it’s just something I’m going to keep in the back of my mind as I keep researching!\n\nVariety, 10 February 1922\n\n[CW: g-slur]\n\nfrom “CORRESPONDENCE”\n\nPITTSBURGH\n\nBy COLEMAN HARRISON\n\nPICTURES—Pitt, “Orphans of the Storm,” fourth week; Grand and Regent, “Gypsy Blood”; Olympic and Alhambra, “Saturday Night”; Savoy, “Why Girls Leave Home”; Liberty and Blackstone, “Rent Free”; Cameraphone, “Two Kinds of Women”; Lyceum, “The Hunch”; Aldine, “Shadows of the Sea”; Garden, “Fightin’ Mad”; Kenyon, “Connecticut Yankee.”\n\nNOTE: Orphans of the Storm (1921, extant)\n\nGypsy Blood a.k.a Zigeunerblut (1920, presumed lost)\n\nSaturday Night (1922, extant)\n\nWhy Girls Leave Home (1921, presumed lost)\n\nRent Free (1922, presumed lost)\n\nThe Hunch (1921, presumed lost)\n\nShadows of the Sea (1922, presumed lost)\n\nFightin’ Mad (1921, presumed lost)\n\nA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court (1921, mostly lost with 3 of 8 reels extant)\n\nThe Pitt Theatre opened as an opera house in 1912, but became exclusively a movie theatre by 1916. It was closed in 1951 but the area remains a theatre district with multiple performing arts spaces.\n\nThe Grand Theatre opened in 1918 and remained in operation until the 1980s. After closing the building was renovated and repurposed, but they preserved the facade and lobby that can still be seen today.\n\nThe Regent Theatre in East Liberty was opened in 1914 and is still in operation as a performing arts venue. (Now called the Kelly Strayhorn Theater.) And, I’m pretty sure I went to a concert there when I still lived in Pittsburgh!\n\nThe building that once housed the Olympic Theatre was built in the 1800s, but was renovated into an entertainment complex in 1908, including a theatre. A theatre was in operation there until 1930 when the building was converted into retail space. At some point it was demolished and, while the lot still houses mixed-use retail, it’s in a new construction.\n\nThe Alhambra Theatre was in operation from 1907 to 1948. The area has been renovated for retail use.\n\nThere have been multiple Liberty Theatres in Pittsburgh’s history, but I believe the one in operation in 1922 was in East Liberty. It was in operation from 1915 through the 1960s. It has since been demolished and the lot is currently occupied by a retail store.\n\nThe Blackstone Theatre had a relatively short run as a theatre—opening in 1919 and closing in 1927. It was redeveloped for retail use, was demolished and the new construction on the spot is also retail.\n\nThe Cameraphone Theatre was in operation from 1913 through the 1960s. Personally, I’m dying that there was a theatre with this name in the nineteen-teens! The building may have been redeveloped into retail or demolished and replaced.\n\nThe Lyceum Theatre was destroyed in a flood (!!) and the O’Reilly Theatre now stands in its place. I saw a play at the O’Reilly ages ago and it’s a really cute venue!\n\nThe Aldine Theatre seems to have pivoted from performing arts to film around the time of this listing. It continued both as a performing arts and movie theatre until the 1970s. There is now a new construction on the lot, The August Wilson African American Cultural Center. Very cool that the area is still dedicated to the arts!\n\nThe Garden Theatre was in operation from 1914 to 2007 and, while the building still stands, it’s currently in the midst of redevelopment.\n\nThe Kenyon Theatre opened in 1909 as a mixed vaudeville/movie theatre, switching fully to movies 10 years later. It was in operation until the 1960s and the whole area has been thoroughly redeveloped.\n\nExhibitors Herald, 11 February 1922\n\nJury to Remain As R-C’s English Agent\n\nCompany’s Complete Output Is Involved in the Transaction\n\nJury’s Imperial Pictures, Ltd..

An R-C picture\n\nMotion Picture News, 11 February 1922\n\n“TWO KINDS OF WOMEN”\n\n(R-C Pictures )\n\nPauline Frederick Scores in a Western\n\nIT may seem strange to picturegoers to discover Pauline Frederick in a Western. That she is able to give color and personality to the character of a breezy ranch owner goes without question. One naturally expects her to shine in any portrayal. Indeed, the star makes “Two Kinds of Women” more vital than it would appear with a less capable actress. The story is one of conflict between this girl, her champion, a rough and ready cowboy, or, rather, horseman, and the villainous henchmen who are the secret tools of a rich lumber company whose object is to undermine her property so that she would sell for a fraction of its value.\n\nThere is some good incident established when this Eastern girl arrives on the ranch and determines to manage it in her own way. She owns two-thirds of the ranch in association with a wealthy Easterner who appears later on the scene and becomes the unconscious tool of the discharged foreman. The boys take exception to this Eastern girl bossing them around. And it isn’t until she gives them a display of horsemanship that most of them accept her as a worthy employer and good fellow. The crooked foreman is discharged on the spot and the cook in the ranch house is thrown out bodily by a rough champion of the heroine, The plot then takes up the complications with the villains determined to embarrass her in every way possible. Interspersed with the intimate scenes are a group of marvelously beautiful long shots—one in particular showing a lake silhouetted against the distant mountains.\n\nThe heroine fits up the interiors of the ranch-house like a Fifth Avenue drawing room. Which is in good taste if you remember that she is a product of the effete East. A counter-plot introduces the other owner arriving with some of his society friends and he comes under the domination of the crooked foreman. The love interest is merely suggested, but it comes into the open when the new foreman discovers that his ideal can bedeck herself in the manner befitting society. He expresses his love in a crude manner and is humiliated over his lack of refinement. The big scene has the heroine kidnapped by the villains and the hero rescuing her from a mountain cave after a day or two of hardship and starvation. The villains are duly punished and the girl, out of gratitude, shows her love for her faithful foreman. The picture is a colorful Western even though it goes over the beaten track in its development. There is a big assortment of characters all of whom are interpreted by a worthy cast that comprises Jack Curtis, Otis Harlan, David Winter, Charles Clary and Eugene Pallette. The exteriors are marked by good photography and the tempo of the story is adequate enough to keep one interested. The leading male role is played by Tom Santschi in his customary vigorous fashion.—Length, 5 reels.—Laurence Reid.\n\nTHE CAST\n\nJudith Sanford… Pauline Frederick\n\nBud Lee… Tom Santschi\n\nBayne Trevors….

Mr. Gregory is famous for his stories laid in the West and this particular vehicle is in his best vein. “Two Kinds of Women” introduces Miss Frederick as part owner of a cattle ranch. She hustles out West, suddenly appears at the ranch, discharges the foreman and takes the management of the big place in her hands. From that moment on things begin to happen with dramatic swiftness, and how Judith with the help of a mysterious cowboy checkmates the ex-foreman’s attempt to ruin the ranch makes an absorbing adventure story. The star is supported by a large cast of competent players that includes Tom Santschi, Charles Clary, Dave Winter, Eugene Pallette, Billy Elmer, Jack Curtis, Lydia Titus, Otis Harlan and many others.\n\nPROGRAM READER\n\nBrilliant in characterization vivid with the life of the open country of the West. “Two Kinds of Women,” with Pauline Frederick in the stellar role, stands forth as one of the really big productions released during the last several months. The picture is an adaptation of Jackson Gregory’s novel, “Judith of Blue Lake Ranch,” and gives to the emotional star a splendid vehicle for the expression of her abundant emotional talents. The picture offers several thrills, good incident, and a fine romantic flavor. It also presents one of the largest and most capable casts ever assembled—a cast that includes Tom Santschi, Charles Clary, Dave Winter, Jean Calhoun and many others. “Two Kinds of Women” will appear at the —— theatre next ——.\n\nNOTE: In the book, Judith and Hampton are from the Bay, city-folk yes, but not “Easterners.” I’m not sure if this was a change made in the adaptation or if the reviewer got mixed up.\n\nMoving Picture World, 11 February 1922\n\nfrom “Newest Reviews and Comments” by Fritz Tidden\n\n“Two Kinds of Women”\n\nPauline Frederick Featured in a Role of Sportsmanship and Daring by Robertson-Cole\n\nReviewed by Mary Kelly.\n\n“The kind of a woman who can,” contrasted to the kind who can’t, is rather sternly characterized by Pauline Frederick in this picture of California ranch life which shows woman in a comparatively new office, that of ranch owner and manager. There may be a divided opinion as to the popularity of this type of heroine depending upon whether the clinging vine or the woman of initiative is the preference of your patrons, for Miss Frederick’s “Judith Sanford” is far removed from the languid lady who has enjoyed so long a reign in fiction and drama. While this will probably result in the criticism of her being unwomanly, it is more likely that her performance will bring admiration.\n\nSplendid directing and the star’s remarkably vital personality have an effect like a tonic on scenes and circumstances that would otherwise be like many of our heroic Westerns. The horse taming scenes, her descent along the rocks and the fight—particularly the “grand-stand” effects during this—are especially effective. There is one shot, that for scenic and lighting splendor is one of the most strikingly beautiful even seen on the screen and that is the scene on the slope a minute before dawn, at the time of the abduction. The cast is especially competent, one of the best selections being Tom Santschi for the leading role.\n\nThe Cast\n\nJudith Sanford………… Pauline Frederick\n\nBud Lee……… Tom Santschi\n\nBayne Trevor………….
