        "text": "Actor : Bob Hope, Jane Russell, Robert Armstrong, Iris Adrian, Robert Watson\n\nDirector: Norman Z. McLeod\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nYear: 1948\n\nStudio: Universal Studios\n\nLength: 91\n\nReleased: June 1, 2010\n\nRating: Not Rated (MPAA Rating)\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nMisc: NTSC, Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, French\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThe Wild West has never been wilder - or funnier - than in this classic six-shootin' farce which introduced the Academy Award - winning song \"Buttons and Bows.\" In one of his most popular roles, Bob Hope plays \"Painless\" Peter Potter, a timid correspondence school dentist earning a shaky living in the lawless West. When \"Painless\" is seduced into agreeing to a quickie marriage by the voluptuous Jane Russell, he thinks his luck has changed. Little does he suspect that Russell is actually sharpshooter Calamity Jane, hot on the trail of a dangerous renegade gang and that she is simply using \"Painless\" as her cover and unwitting dupe! This Old West burlesque, brightened by Technicolor and uproarious slapstick, went on to become one of Bob Hope's best-loved film vehicles and his biggest box office hit. Saddle up for the wild comic ride!\n\nSpecial Features :"
