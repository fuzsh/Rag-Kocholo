Cline, 1922) con el objetivo de conocer cual es la representación de los agentes de policía que aparecen en cada uno de los films, así como mostrar la herramientas a través de las cuales se construye esa representación. De tal forma, a partir de una contextualización histórica de los orígenes de la Policía moderna en Estados Unidos y mediante un análisis del discurso hecho desde una perspectiva sociológica que parte de los preceptos de la Teoría Crítica, así como de las cuestiones de la identidad y la clase social, se ha llevado a cabo el análisis que nos ha mostrado unos resultados en los que se observan que la representación de los agentes en los films ha sido negativa, mediante el uso en los guiones de el rol violento de la policía, el miedo de los agentes, la distinción de clase de la policía respecto a la clase trabajadora y la muestra de la incompetencia de éstos para cumplir sus objetivos. Todo esto nos ha llevado a afirmar que el discurso de ambas películas se enmarcaría en el antiautoritarismo propio de la época previa del Código Hays en el cine de Estados Unidos, siendo un producto cultural contrahegemónico.\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this artycle we have analyzed the short films Easy Street (Charles Chaplin, 1917) and Cops (Buster Keaton and Edward F. Cline, 1922) in order to know which is the representation of the police officers in each shor film, as well as show the tools through which this representation is constructed. In such a way, from an historical context of the origins of modern Police in the US and by analyzing the speech made from a sociological perspective of the precepts of Critical Theory, as well as from issues of identity and social class, the analysis has shown that the representation of the agents in these films has been negative by using in the scripts the violent role of the police, the fear of the agents, the police class distinction towards the working class and the incompetence of these to meet their goals. All this has led us to conclude that the speech of both films would be framed in the proper anti-authoritarianism of the time before the Hays Code in the US cinema, being a counter-cultural product.\n\nPublished in HARTS&Minds Journal, December 2017.

Expanding on this, in this essay I engage theories of the ludic body and object as ‘thing’ with Keaton’s work (e.g. Engell, Merleau-Ponty, Bergson), arguing that Keaton’s multimodal play of props and body creates a carnivalesque space of mutable identities. Drawing on historical studies, I show how white North American masculinity at the turn of the 20th Century was constructed through the navigation of acute and shifting anxieties related to labour and increased mechanisation. Masculine identity in the period was not only changeable in itself, but also vulnerable to notions of change (Hilkey, Kimmel). I argue that Keaton plays on this vulnerability in ‘The Playhouse’. I begin by arguing that the establishment of machine systems in the film allows Keaton's character to negate the social obligations of his work place. In this way, he enacts the literal displacement of social and manual labour with mechanical play: his machines are a replacement society. Keaton’s integration of work/play objects into a system of comedic, repetitive, machinery undermines their specific identities, making them thing-like. This highlights the instability of objects/things in general, mirroring and impinging the unstable position of masculine identity.\n\nThe two great comedians in the history of cinema, Charlie Chapin and Buster Keaton, embody the two extremes of comic excess.

Despite their contemporaneousness, Chaplin and Keaton produce opposing forms of comedy, and in this way, they show how comedy can emerge through exclusion from the social order or through that order’s internal contradictions. Chaplin embodies exclusion, while Keaton exposes an internal excess within society.\n\nThis thesis examines the distinct relationship between Buster Keaton’s characters and their modern, twentieth-century environment.

In accounting for the operations of this environment, this thesis positions Keaton’s films within a theoretical framework known as the Modernity Thesis. These debates focus on characterising early twentieth-century modernity in an urban environment as being fuelled by industrialisation, and as creating a faster-paced, over-stimulated world. This was a world in which the individual was subjected to a new barrage of stimuli obtained through a plethora of new technologies and amusements. These included, among others, cinema and faster forms of transport. This new, modern landscape provided the individual with a transformed physical and psychological experience of modernity.\n\nThis thesis investigates this new experience of modernity as it manifests itself in Keaton’s films. Keaton positions his on-screen characters in a state of victimisation by their own environment, often overpowered by the chaos of the modern city. This position calls on Keaton to undertake a process of adaption to his environment in order to achieve his particular goal, or simply to keep up with the pace of those around him. I argue that it is through a close examination of these moments of adaption and the logic that governs them that we can see how the ideas expressed in the Modernity Thesis can be seen to take on cinematic form through slapstick comedy. Importantly, this thesis characterises Keaton’s stunts, in these moments of adaption, as actively involving the participation of director, performer, environment and, by extension, the audience.\n\nAn earlier version of this was published in two parts in THE KEATON CHRONICLE in 2008 under the title \"Fitting In: Racial Stereotypes in Keaton Films,\" Part One and Part 2 .

Part One is already posted on Academia.edu as a pdf of the Chronicle issue. Here I've combined Parts One and Two into a single paper and revised the title to be more specific. This article examines the way Keaton used racial stereotypes in two short films and a feature. In these films the Keaton hero persona identifies with the Other and triumphs as such. In his usage and variation on the standard stereotypes, Keaton the filmmaker undermined the assumptions of the stereotypes.\n\nIn Cinema’s Baroque Flesh, Saige Walton draws on the philosophy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to argue for a distinct aesthetic category of film and a unique cinema of the senses: baroque cinema.

Combining media archaeological work with art history, phenomenology, and film studies, the book offers close analyses of a range of historic baroque artworks and films, including Caché, Strange Days, Trouble Every Day, the films of Buster Keaton, and many more.\n\nWalton pursues previously unexplored connections between film, the baroque, and the body, opening up new avenues of embodied film theory that can make room for structure, signification, and thought, as well as the aesthetics of sensation.\n\nThis essay contends that young Americans were so omnipresent as performers and audience members during the nineteenth century that virtually all forms of popular theater from this period—including the pantomime, the extravaganza, the... more\n\nThis essay contends that young Americans were so omnipresent as performers and audience members during the nineteenth century that virtually all forms of popular theater from this period—including the pantomime, the extravaganza, the melodrama, and the minstrel show—can profitably be considered children’s theater. HUMPTY DUMPTY, UNCLE TOM'S CABIN, RIP VAN WINKLE: many of the century’s biggest theatrical hits were enacted by mixed-age casts for mixed-age audiences, because the general population was not yet convinced that children needed to be shielded from paid labor and provided with their own separate and specially sanitized leisure activities. Too often, we presume that nineteenth-century children were so strongly associated with innocence, dependency, and vulnerability that no significant conflict over this bourgeois ideal took place. Yet as the controversies that swirled around all-child troupes such as the Viennoise Children in the 1840s and child stars such as Buster Keaton at century’s end attest, the nineteenth-century stage was a site of struggle over how to define the categories child and adult. Just as conflicting attitudes about women and African Americans were on display in burlesques and minstrel shows, so too deep uncertainties about what it meant to be a child played themselves out in nineteenth-century productions aimed at “children of all ages.”\n\nNo Kidding!

Clown as Protagonist in Twentieth-Century Theater examines the way clown was transformed into a serious character in twentieth-century theater. Modernist theater practitioners recognized that clown's approach to performance is profoundly different from other modes of theatrical representation. The paradox of clown, a traditionally marginal, comic character thrust into center stage as the focus of the agon, provided a stimulating new way to renovate tragedy. Experiments with clown by Jean Cocteau, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Bertolt Brecht, Samuel Beckett, Giorgio Strehler, Dario Fo, and Roberto Benigni are examined as a means of exploring how and why clown became, in contemporary theater and film, a character from whom audiences expect philosophizing, angst, or political criticism as much as physical comedy and fractured language.\n\nA cura di Gabriele Gimmelli, con la collaborazione di Astrid Ardenti e Andrea Sanarelli.

The names of Marceline Orbes and Francis “Slivers” Oakley mean almost\n\nnothing today, but these comedians were hugely influential, inspiring not only Chaplin but also Buster Keaton. Orbes and Oakley shared a focus on pathos and the mime that helped to provide Chaplin and Keaton with their comic framework. Though their careers were destroyed by the rise of cinematic comedy (and the performers whom they had helped to inspire), a development that led to their suicides, the influence of Orbes and Oakley was long lasting thanks to those successful big-screen comedians who understood and internalized their works.\n\nThe work aims to re-read Lunario del paradiso through the essay Su Beckett, l'interpololazione e il gag, included in Finzioni occidentali (1975).

Comparing the comic techniques adopted in Beckett's writing and slapstick comedy (i.e. the themes of permutation and expulsion, the idea of \"wandering\") with those adopted by Celati in Lunario, we will try to show how the novel constitutes its extreme attempt to transform the written page into a sort of mimicry performance. An attempt that, if on one hand it can be considered \"failed\", on the other it opens up Celati's writing to new perspectives."
