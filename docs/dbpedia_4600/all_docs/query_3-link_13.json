        "text": "Meaning of silent movie in English\n\nExamples of silent movie\n\nsilent movie\n\nA black-and-white silent movie that creates the most modern kind of witty and entertaining fun.\n\nThe 1920 multireel, silent movie was rediscovered and restored a few years ago.\n\nUsually they are amazed by the experience of watching a silent movie, which is another form of expression.\n\nIf people didn't moan, it would be a silent movie.\n\nIt \"demands of the audience to let go of their normal expectations for storytelling\" and \"plays essentially like a silent movie,\" he explained.\n\nBut, around the time of the transition from silent movie to talkies, she began taking on bit parts and extra work, and never really went back.\n\nNo discussion of silent movies is complete without mention of -- and tribute to -- those silver-screen pioneers.\n\nThrowing foam pies has been a way of scoring easy laughs since the slapstick rule book was written in the days of silent movies.\n\nThe result is somewhere between single exposures and films, and the stories play out like silent movies -- touching, funny, sad, irreverent and full of surprise.\n\nParticipants were instructed to ignore the stimuli coming through the overhead speaker while they relaxed and watched a self-selected silent movie.\n\nIn contrast, during the electrophysiological task, the participants were instructed to ignore the speech sounds and focus on a silent movie playing on a computer monitor in front of them.\n\nIndeed, several theaters, including one in the old city, played silent movies.\n\nHe hadn't seen even pictures of such things since the few silent movies run in some of the little art theaters.\n\nThese examples are from corpora and from sources on the web. Any opinions in the examples do not represent the opinion of the Cambridge Dictionary editors or of Cambridge University Press or its licensors.\n\n{{#randomImageQuizHook.filename}} {{#randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}}\n\nTest your vocabulary with our fun image quizzes\n\nTry a quiz now\n\n{{/randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}} {{^randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}} {{/randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}} {{/randomImageQuizHook.filename}}\n\nWord of the Day\n\nleft-click\n\nUK\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio\n\n/ˈleftˌklɪk/\n\nUS\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio\n\n/ˈleftˌklɪk/\n\nto press the button on the left of a computer mouse in order to make the computer do something\n\nAbout this\n\nBlog\n\nSimply the best!
