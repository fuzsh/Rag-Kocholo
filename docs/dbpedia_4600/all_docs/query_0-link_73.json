        "text": "The Edison Studio collective, with the support of Cineteca di Bologna (Film Archive of Bologna), and SIAE - (Società Italiana degli Autori e Editori) for the project SIAE – Classici di Oggi, with the collaboration of the Romaeuropa Festival, since 2016 announces an international music composition contest for moving images every year. The aim of the competition \"Sounds of Silences\" is to stimulate musical creativity in its interaction with the audiovisual media, particularly for the reinterpretation of historical silent films and the creation of new soundtracks, with a special concern for timbre as in today’s instrumental, electronic and electroacoustic music.\n\nSounds of Silences organizers aim is to stimulate the finalists to make a valid contribution towards redefining the meaning, aesthetics, and conceptual structures of cinema before the advent of soundtracks, not simply by “accompanying” the images on the screen, but by revealing their original hidden content, thereby giving a new voice to what was previously silent.\n\nThe competition takes place in various stages: in the preliminary stage of the competition, entrants must submit an audiovisual work the musical part of which they themselves have composed. Participation in the contest is free. An international jury will then select three finalists among the entrants, who will be invited to create a soundtrack for a medium-length silent movie chosen by Edison Studio in collaboration with the Cineteca di Bologna. A second international jury awards cash prizes to the finalists during a public event as part of the Romaeuropa Festival.\n\nParticipation in the competition, both individual and collective, is open to all young composers under 35 of any nationality.\n\nThe next edition of the competition is scheduled for 2022.\n\nOn 21 October 2020 at the Foyer 1 of the Ex Mattatoio (Testaccio), Rome, as part of the RomaEuropa Festival 2020, the final evening of the 5th edition of the \"Sounds of Silences\" competition took place.
