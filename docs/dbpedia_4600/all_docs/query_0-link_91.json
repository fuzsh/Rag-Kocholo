It has all the features up until 1928. All the really famous ones. And, like the Chaplin set, it has a number of featurettes, a few of Keton's shorts, and some other curios from Keaton's career. With the low dollar, I am not sure that it is actually much cheaper than the Kino set, but you can keep an eye out for a better price. I think I managed to get it somewhat cheaper than this, although I can't remember.\n\nOr, start out with the Complete Short Films from MoC. Then, at least you have that part of Keaton's career covered in the best and most complete edition I imagine we will see for a very, very long time. That set also includes select commentaries, and one of the most informative and exhaustive books of any DVD release, ever!!\n\nQuote\n\n#27 Post by malcolm1980 » Sat Jun 09, 2007 2:58 pm\n\nI actually have a region-free DVD player so it's no problem.

In most of these instances, Keaton obviously had no control over the basic concept & structure, but he appears to have had a lot of control over the details.\n\nThe distinction is one of character, not necessarily quality (again Welles is a close parallel). The films in group (a) no doubt vary in standard, but they all have the distinctive character we know as \"Keatonesque\". The films in group (b) are not so \"Keatonesque\", but some of them are impressive films if you're prepared to accept their genre, and Keaton's acting is often one of the things that makes them impressive (I'm thinking, e.g., of The Saphead, San Diego I Love You, In the Good Old Summertime, Film...).\n\nFor group (a), my personal suggestions would be just about the same as Scharphedin's: the MK2 Silent Features box; the MoC Complete Short Films; and the TCM Keaton (the only legal source for the last two silent features -- I thoroughly agree that The Cameraman is an essential purchase). This would give you good-quality transfers of all the group (a) silent shorts and features plus The Railrodder. For anyone wishing to go a little further, The Home Owner is in the Industrial Strength Keaton set (though much of the other material in that is inferior), and the new Looserthanloose box might possibly be the option of choice for the Educationals. (It's doubtful whether we're ever going to have really good-quality transfers of those, or even whether good-quality source material exists.) Of the group (a) films, only Paradise for Buster remains unavailable on DVD. (Unfortunately, it's an extremely important and totally Keatonesque film.)\n\nOf course a totally complete Keaton would have to include not only everything I've mentioned above, but also the various 1930s-40s films which contain moments of \"pure Keaton\" because he gave backstage advice, even though he never appears in front of the camera. The exact limits would be impossible to define. Thus e.g. I'm positive that Keaton worked as an advisor on Henry Koster's MGM Two Sisters from Boston. I've never heard any mention of the fact, but I'm sure it is a fact. One faint in that movie by June Allyson, and one fall from a ladder by Peter Lawford, couldn't possibly have been achieved unless Keaton had rehearsed them: I know that as certainly as if I'd seen him do it. (Lawford also does a form of Keaton's picking-up-an-unconscious-woman routine, but I don't regard that as so conclusive, because it might conceivably have been learnt from observation of Keaton's films.) When the world eventually issues The Complete Works of Buster Keaton alongside The Complete Works of Shakespeare, Two Sisters from Boston will have to go into it!\n\nQuote\n\n#30 Post by BenCheshire » Tue Jun 19, 2007 4:08 am\n\nThanks for those specs. I will put that in my \"MAYBE\" list. I wonder why they just don't release them regularly like they did the Chaplin movies.\n\nForgotten Goldfish wrote:On their home page, looserthanloose are advertising a complete 6-DVD-R set of Keaton's Educational Pictures shorts. ...

For the same reason, I've only just ordered the Looser Than Loose release. I expect it will be several weeks before I've checked everything in it. But in the meantime, I can describe the films themselves.\n\nQuestions about the relative merits of Keaton's films (even in the silent period) elicit bewilderingly different responses -- even from sympathetic, careful professional critics. College is \"the least successful of the silent features\" -- Daniel Moews; \"possibly the greatest of the features\" -- David Shipman. Ditto is \"embarrassingly bad\" -- Leonard Maltin; \"a minor masterpiece\" -- Jim Kline.\n\nSo, as far as possible, I'll try simply to describe the characteristics of these films, leaving it to individual readers to judge for themselves whether they'd be likely to enjoy them.\n\nEducational Pictures was a very low-budget company, and Keaton's Educationals all have a cheap, underrehearsed look. Pacing feels erratic, and the virtual absence of incidental music doesn't help (one line or gag, then an awkward silence, then the next). Picture quality would probably look undistinguished even if we could see pristine negatives -- which we can't, because the company went out of business early and nobody bothered to care for its assets. Truly complete prints of some Keaton Educationals may no longer survive. In some cases, I'm not even sure whether 35mm material survives. Nevertheless, in the available 16mm prints, the action (including facial expressions) is always clear and the dialogue always intelligible. Some of Keaton's silent classics survive in much worse shape.\n\nBut at such a minor company, Keaton was by far the biggest â€œstarâ€\n\nQuote\n\n#32 Post by BenCheshire » Thu Jun 21, 2007 9:39 pm\n\nForgotten Goldfish wrote: I've only just ordered the Looser Than Loose release.\n\nDamn.\n\nForgotten Goldfish wrote: College is \"embarrassingly bad\" -- Leonard Maltin\n\nHe didn't!\n\nForgotten Goldfish wrote: Nevertheless, in the available 16mm prints, the action (including facial expressions) is always clear and the dialogue always intelligible.

I just got The Great Stone Face, an Australian release of the Mk2 restorations of College, Three Ages, Steamboat and General, and they're fabulous. Absolutley stunning, as the DVDBeaver comparisons show. I can see Buster's face so much better now.\n\nForgotten Goldfish wrote: He contributed largely to the scripts and direction, and he chose many of the actors. The Educational casts include many ex-colleagues, friends, family members -- experienced professionals familiar with his style and capable of fitting in with it. Result: the Educationals give us a rare opportunity to see Keaton working after 1929 not just as an actor, but as a true creator of films -- an auteur, if you like.\n\nIs Tom Dardis (\"Man Who Wouldn't Lie Down\") wrong on this point? I heard there were technical innacuracies, being as he was the first researcher getting his information mainly not from the horse's mouth... But Dardis claims that Grand Slam Opera is the only Educational which Keaton did more than star in. I'd love to hear this was wrong, where did you hear your information, or are you just inferring from comparing the films to the silents?\n\nForgotten Goldfish wrote: If you're looking for â€œKeatonesqueâ€\n\nQuote\n\n#33 Post by tryavna » Fri Jun 22, 2007 11:39 am\n\nBenCheshire wrote:\n\nForgotten Goldfish wrote: College is \"embarrassingly bad\" -- Leonard Maltin\n\nHe didn't!\n\nHe didn't.

Dardis was probably referring to credits; I was referring to contributions. If I remember correctly, Grand Slam Opera is indeed the only Educational on which Keaton takes screen credit for the script. But at all stages of his career (including the silents) Keaton contributed to many things for which he took no credit. Charles Lamont, the credited writer & director of most of the Educationals, says that Keaton contributed largely to them. In fact, Lamont's description tallies with what, in the documentary Buster Keaton Rides Again, we can actually see Keaton doing on the set of The Railrodder. As for choice of actors, the list speaks for itself: the Educational casts include Dorothy Sebastian, Al St. John, Keaton's father, mother, sister, brother, the acrobats from Neighbors, etc. Nobody but Keaton would have hired most of those. I don't imagine Dardis would disagree with these points.\n\nOf course the crucial issue is not who made the films, but what they are. A \"Rembrandt\" painting may drop dramatically in market value if someone discovers that it was actually painted by someone else. But the painting itself -- and the quality of the painting -- remain the same regardless of who painted it. Likewise with films. If we discovered tomorrow that Laughton was sick while Night of the Hunter was filmed, and that it was actually directed by Ed Wood, the movie itself wouldn't alter.\n\nQuote\n\n#36 Post by BenCheshire » Fri Jun 22, 2007 8:53 pm\n\nForgotten Goldfish wrote: I don't have Dardis to hand at the moment, but there may not be any conflict on this point.

But I secretly don't think Dardis even watched any of the Educationals before writing his book, and just based his research on the screen credits, because the language he uses here assumes the credits relate to what actually happened on set, which, as we all know, is often wrong. Not just Buster, but a lot of people in Hollywood did script work they didn't get screen-credit for.\n\nDardis p244 \"One sign of his better health can be seen in his next Educational film Grand Slam Opera, for which he received the co-writing credit, the only one of these films for which he did anything but act.\"\n\nIf Dardis was suspicious of the crediting system he would have phrased it \"the only one of these films for which he was credited with anything but acting.\" If Dardis had that quote from Lamont about Buster contributing a lot he would have used it, instead he paints Buster in the previous chapter as dead to the world drunk and depressed just going through the motions in this period.\n\nForgotten Goldfish wrote:A \"Rembrandt\" painting may drop dramatically in market value if someone discovers that it was actually painted by someone else.

Ah well, I guess if you're writing a groundbreaking book on a vast subject, you can't research every aspect with equal thoroughness -- or write up every aspect with equal precision. I'm not much of an author myself, but I suffer agonies whenever I look back over any book I've had published -- they all contain sentences just as careless as \"the only one of these films for which he did anything but act.\"\n\nThe sentence does make the valuable point that different Educationals were filmed under very different circumstances. This was true not only in terms of Keaton's health (and the amount of blood that managed to get into his alcohol stream), but in other important respects too -- some were done in NY, some in Hollywood, etc. No doubt the conditions of filming (and the extent, and value, of Keaton's contributions) varied considerably.\n\nBenCheshire wrote:I think Laughton's position in film history would change completely, at least for us scholars and buffs, if that was found out.

He goes on to describe a scenario in which some researcher discovers a long-lost letter of Faulkner's that shows that Faulkner believed himself to be an Eskimo foundling and how that belief on Faulkner's part (regardless of whether or not it were true) would be enought to transform Faulkner studies forever.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Goldfish's Ed Wood scenario.

The way the advertisement is worded makes it sound more like alternate versions of two of Keaton's films, rather than any entirely new discoveries. Does anyone know anything about this?"
