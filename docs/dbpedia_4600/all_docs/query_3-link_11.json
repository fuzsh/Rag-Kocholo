        "text": "“Silent movies? You like silent movies?”\n\nIt’s a conversation that I’ve had all too many times in my career as a silent movie fan. Many modern filmgoers just can’t comprehend why anybody would willingly watch a silent movie, let alone multiple silents.\n\nMy reasons for liking silent films have to do with obscurity, rooting for the underdog and the fact that a good silent movie is an entirely unique experience. Because we as viewers are required to supply so much of our imagination, a good silent movie will root itself in our brains far deeper than a sound film. At least that has been my experience.\n\nWhat about you? What is it about silent movies that appeals to you?\n\nNaturally, this is all going to depend on your point of view and if your answer is, “I like grown men hitting one another with cotton clubs” well, that’s fine by me!\n\n***"
