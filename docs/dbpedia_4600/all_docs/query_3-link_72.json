        "text": "Have you recently scrolled past a video on your favorite social media site only to notice that the sound is off? You try clicking on the video to turn the sound back on, only to realize that the video you’re trying to watch is silent.\n\nA silent video is a video that does not rely on sound to communicate its message. These videos are becoming increasingly popular, especially on social media sites. Silent videos are often shorter than traditional videos and sometimes feature text on the screen, known as captions, that helps to tell the story when the imagery isn’t enough.\n\nWhile silent videos may seem like a new trend, they have a long history. Silent films were some of the first movies ever made and were incredibly popular in the early 20th century, featuring black and white film, no audio, and a few key sound effects. Messages did appear on the screen, but they were very short and were used in place of traditional dialogue.\n\nWhile silent films are considered a staple of the early film industry, it’s been some time since they’ve been popular. However, when researching popular video production trends, silent videos seem to be coming back.\n\nAre Silent Videos Relevant Today?\n\nWhile silent films are a thing of the past, the concept of silent videos seems to be gaining traction in today’s modern age. Those in the video production industry are starting to see the value of silent videos and the benefits they can bring to their clients, especially those in the business world.\n\nMarketing teams are always looking for ways to increase their reach and keep their audience engaged. However, with so much noise out there, it can be hard to get noticed. So, many are now turning to silent videos instead of contributing to the noise.\n\nSilent videos are an excellent way for businesses to communicate their message without being too “in your face.” They can be used to promote a new product or service and even show off the company culture. And, since they don’t rely on audio, they can be viewed by anyone anywhere.\n\nResearch shows that approximately 69% of consumers view video with the sound off. Why? For several reasons, actually, including:\n\nViewing videos in public places.\n\nViewing videos while doing other things.\n\nViewing videos in a quiet environment (such as the workplace) without access to headphones.\n\nViewers don’t enjoy ads or videos auto-playing when scrolling social media or reading the news.\n\nWhile some may write silent videos off as a passing trend, there are actually many benefits to incorporating them into a video marketing strategy.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Silent Videos?\n\nSilent videos have just as much value as their audible counterparts. Just because there isn’t any audible dialog or fancy music playing in the background doesn’t mean they aren’t a powerful marketing tool. Below are just a few benefits of including silent videos into your content mix:\n\nAccessibility\n\nSilent videos can be enjoyed by a wider audience, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Since they don’t rely on dialog or sound cues, they can be enjoyed by a wider audience. This makes them a great choice for marketing to a global audience.\n\nBy catering to those with and without hearing difficulties, you are showing your audience that inclusivity is something you genuinely care about. You can, of course, choose to include closed captioning or subtitles in your videos to ensure everyone can enjoy your content.\n\nBuild a Deeper Connection Through Imagery\n\nWhen done correctly, silent videos can help you foster deeper, more emotional connections with your viewers. Since they rely heavily on visual imagery, they can be very evocative and provoke strong emotions in viewers. This can be a great way to connect with your audience personally and get them emotionally invested in your brand.\n\nShowing Not Telling\n\nIn the age of social media and short attention spans, marketers have to work extra hard to engage their target audiences. And one way to do that is by using silent videos. Silent videos are an excellent way to show, not tell, your audience what you do or what you have to offer. They force marketers to be creative and devise ways to engage their audiences without using words.\n\nThis is an excellent opportunity for brands to connect with their audiences in a way that feels more genuine. Modern consumers don’t want to feel like they are being sold to. They want to feel educated, and when you eliminate dialogue, you’ve eliminated the possibility of overselling your product or service. What they see is what they get.\n\nWhich Platforms are Best Suited for Silent Videos?\n\nIf you’re considering creating silent videos, you might wonder which platforms best suit this type of content. The answer is: it depends.\n\nIf your marketing team is considering adding silent videos to your content mix, then you’ll want to consider the following platforms:\n\nWebsites\n\nA website is a great place to incorporate silent videos. They can complement other types of content, such as blog posts or stand alone. You can also use them to highlight a specific product or service by showing your audience how it works.\n\nOther common uses for silent videos on a website include header videos, product or service walkthroughs, or giving a behind-the-scenes look at a company or organization.\n\nIf you’re thinking of using silent videos as part of your advertising, you may be able to incorporate them into video or banner ads on other websites.\n\nFacebook\n\nSilent videos are an excellent option on Facebook. The video format is native to the platform, and videos autoplay without sound on most devices. This means that your audience is more likely to watch a silent video than one with sound. In addition, Facebook allows you to add subtitles to your videos, which is another way to ensure that your audience can follow along.\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram is another great platform for silent videos, as it is a visually-driven platform. People flock to the platform to see images and videos, but given the scrolling nature of the platform, videos are best served as a silent, visual experience. This way, viewers aren’t startled by the sudden sound of a video.\n\nOf course, you can always enable sound on your videos if you want. However, it would be best to turn auto-sound off on your videos to help increase your view count. If users want to experience the video with sound, they can tap on the sound icon at the bottom of the video to turn it on.\n\nSilent Video Production Help with NG Production Films\n\nWhile silent videos may not be for everyone, they can significantly add to your content mix. If you’re thinking of incorporating silent videos into your content strategy, consider the platform and the message you’re trying to communicate. With a bit of creativity, you can create silent videos that are both informative and visually appealing."
