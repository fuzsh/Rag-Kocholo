        "text": "Since its first performance at the Globe in 1599, Shakespeare’s Henry V has been adapted many times for the stage over the years. In addition there have been a handful of major film adaptations of the play that teachers can easily obtain for use in their classrooms. The following is an overview of the major film adaptations of Shakespeare’s Henry V.\n\nHenry V (1944)\n\nIn 1944, the first major film adaptation of Shakespeare’s Henry V was released. It was directed by and starred Sir Laurence Olivier. The film was infamously created at the behest of Winston Churchill who requested that Olivier, a famed Shakespearean actor, make a film adaptation of the play to boost the morale of the English troops toward the end of World War II.\n\nFilmed in British Technicolor, this adaptation’s vibrant costuming and settings drum up the glory of war and has overt nationalist and patriotic tones. The depiction of war and battle in this film may be perceived as highly unrealistic and fanciful considering modern audience’s taste for realism, but the goals of this adaptation were never to highlight the reality of war. Instead, this production does an excellent job of raising spirits and providing an idealistic view of the virtues of war for a noble cause.\n\nBesides the abundance of English nationalism and Laurence Olivier’s eloquent delivery of Henry’s monologues, a noteworthy feature of this film is the opening of the play that sought to recreate Henry V’s original performance at the Globe in 1599. Teachers can find a link to this opening scene under “O for a Muse of Fire” (1.1) in video resources or by clicking here.\n\nHenry V (1989)\n\nThe next major film adaptation of Henry V was released in 1989, directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh. When released, the film garnered critical acclaim and is now one of the most popularly viewed Shakespeare film adaptations.\n\nUnlike Olivier’s version, Branagh’s film adaptation of Henry V was a gritty and realistic depiction of war. Instead of the sunny field where Olivier staged the battle of Agincourt, the battles in Branagh’s film are filled with mud, sweat, and gore. The overall tone of this film is somber with even the comedic scenes of the original play presented as drama.\n\nOf particular note in this film adaptation is Branagh’s depiction of Henry. Despite the emphasis on the harsh realities of war, Branagh plays the king as a man willing to do what needs to be done in wartime, but retains his integrity and virtue.\n\nThe Hollow Crown: Henry V (2012)\n\nThe most recent film adaptation of Henry V was produced only a few years ago by the BBC. This television film was directed by Thea Sharrock and stars Tom Hiddleston as King Henry. This film belongs to a mini-series, The Hollow Crown, which was an adaptation of Shakespeare’s second tetralogy including television film adaptations of Richard II and Henry IV Parts 1 and 2.\n\nThe production of this film is similar to Olivier’s as The Hollow Crown mini-series was developed by the BBC as part of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad which celebrated Britain’s culture and the arts in anticipation of the 2012 England hosted Olympics. As such, this version is similarly filled with nationalist imagery.\n\nThis production’s tone lies somewhere between Olivier’s lighter adaptation and Branagh’s grittier successor. Hiddleston portrays King Henry at his noblest, depicting the king as though he were just an ordinary man striving to do what is best for his country, always conscious of the immense weight of leadership.\n\nOverall, the many film adaptations of Henry V each present their own interpretation of the glory and the costs of war. Although none of these film adaptations were produced with the actors in modern dress, such as in OSU’s production, they each are a product of their time and the socio-political context in which each of these films were produced had a great bearing on their outlook of war. OSU Theater’s Henry V is just as much in conversation with these previous film adaptations as it is with our own political situation and attitude towards war, demonstrating the continuing relevance of Shakespeare’s play in our world today."
