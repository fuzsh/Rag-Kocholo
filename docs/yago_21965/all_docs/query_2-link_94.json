        "text": "It's been a busy month for Kenneth Branagh. Earlier this February, his film Belfast received seven Oscar nominations, including nods for best director and best original screenplay. The film, and Branagh, won a single award: original screenplay.\n\nBranagh also stars in the new film adaptation of Agatha Christie's mystery novel Death on the Nile. For that movie, Branagh reprises the role of Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. He previously played Poirot in 2017's Murder on the Orient Express.\n\nCBC RADIO: Edmonton AM's Screentime column discusses Death on the Nile\n\nBranagh was busy way back in 1991 too, when he appeared on CBC's Midday to promote Dead Again, a movie he had both directed and starred in.\n\nMidday's Tina Srebotnjak interviewed Branagh for the program in August of that year.\n\n\"You've had such a spectacular career for someone so young,\" said Srebotnjak to Branagh.\n\nAt the time, he was just 30 and had already adapted, directed and starred in a film version of William Shakespeare's Henry V. That film earned him two Academy Award nominations in 1990.\n\nTaking his work home\n\nIn Dead Again, Branagh co-starred with his then-wife, Emma Thompson. Each played two parts in the movie. As he told Midday, that was a welcome acting challenge.\n\n\"This came along, and I couldn't put it down,\" he said. 'I just loved the script. I thought it was a fine piece of writing.\"\n\nLater in the interview, Srebotnjak asked Branagh about working with Thompson, who had also played a part in Henry V.\n\n\"You're a wonderful on-screen couple,\" she said. \"You find that's a totally a workable relationship, you're not worried about getting too locked in?\"\n\nBranagh shook his head.\n\n\"We won't do it forever,\" he said, noting separate projects that each had worked on. \"We never set out to be some kind of show-biz couple ... We'd stop the moment it started to get, you know, difficult because we were married. If we couldn't put it away at the end of the day, I, for one, wouldn't be able to deal with it.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the pair announced their separation in October 1995.\n\nThis year, Branagh became the first person to have been nominated in seven different categories at the Academy Awards, according to Variety magazine. He has never won, but will have a chance to break that streak when the awards take place on March 27, 2022."
