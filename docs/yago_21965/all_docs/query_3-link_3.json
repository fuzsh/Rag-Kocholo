        "text": "Henry V, British dramatic film, released in 1944, that was an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s historical play of the same name. It marks the triumphant directorial debut of Laurence Olivier, who also coproduced and starred in the film. It is widely considered among the best film adaptations of Shakespeare’s works.\n\nThe film, shot in Technicolor, opens with a panoramic view of Elizabethan London and then narrows to the Globe Theatre, where a performance of Henry V is about to begin. The film gradually dissolves into a cinematic depiction of the play instead of the Globe performance. Henry, king of England (played by Olivier), proves his mettle by leading a weary, divided, and vastly outnumbered English army of unarmoured archers to victory over the French knights of Normandy at the Battle of Agincourt (1415) in the Hundred Years’ War. On the night before the decisive battle, Henry delivers his stirring “Saint Crispin’s Day” speech, inspiring his men with the promise that “the fewer men, the greater share of honour.” Upon achieving victory, Henry courts Princess Katherine (Renée Asherson), the French king’s daughter, whereupon the film returns to the setting of the Globe Theatre.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
