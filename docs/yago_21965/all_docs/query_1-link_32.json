        "text": "by Sam Juliano\n\nThis is the first entry in the ‘Exceptional 80’s Cinema’ series that is planned to run once every three or four days during Allan’s countdown. Most of the choices will be films that did not make Allan’s top 50, but in my eyes deserved that lofty designation. Branagh’s ‘Henry V’ from 1989, is the first up in the series. Tony d’Ambra may possibly contribute to this venture as well.\n\nBut he’ll remember, with advantages, what feats he did that day. Then shall our names, Familiar in his mouth as household words–Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester–Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb’red. This story shall the good man teach his son, and Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by, From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be remembered, we few, we happy few, we band of brothers…\n\nIn the pantheon of filmed Shakespeare, two versions of the rousing history play, Henry V now stand at the forefront of cinematic conscription, and in a number of ways they are like day and night. Laurence Olivier’s wartime version was exactly what one might expect to see in 16th century Elizabethan England, where men played female roles, wore authentic period garb, and where there was an underpinning of patriotism, intended to impress the monarchy with the dramatization of English military might and bravery. Of course, Olivier, who starred as Henry and directed the 1944 film had far more than loyalty to the Bard in mind, as Britain was engaged in World War II, and Sir Larry did his own version of a cinematic Churchill. The set design was exquisite with the overhead pan of a Globe Theatre replica which preceeded the opening an inspired choice. Olivier’s version was traditional, and impeccably executed in a way that would have done Shakespeare proud.\n\nBut in 1989, upstart Kenneth Branagh arrived from his ‘Renaissance Theatre’ with a limited budget and some venerated marquee players ready to take on a work with with some of Shakespeare’s most popular lines, including the Agincourt St. Crispin’s Day Speech to the English troops, printed in part above. Branagh’s take on the play was far more earthy, raw, brutally realistic, and emotional. The young thespian was at the height of his powers, and this film, his first, has never been bettered, even if the flawed Hamlet pushes close. Branagh purportedly had spent several years getting the part down perfectly, tirelessly studying voice patterns, delivery and character immersion, and his success was complete. He received a number of acting prizes and won an oscar nomination for Best Actor, and another for Best Director, a rare feat. But it was Branagh’s ‘interpretation’ that set his Henry apart from any other. His realization that Shakespeare was, after all, a modern playright, perhaps even ‘post-modern.’ Henry imparted a variety of traits that made the character one of the Bard’s most multi-faceted: charm, ruthlessness, demonic brutality and angelic chivalry, and evincing strains of populism and imperialism. Branagh employs a number of devices in this film that releases it from the constrictions of fidelity, incorporating humor, a one man chorus played by the incomparable Derek Jacobi, and the employment of snippets from Henry IV, Parts I and II, to be used as strategic flashbacks intended to illustrate Prince hal’s high-profile “wilder” days. Of course this would serve to inform the novice just how far Henry has advanced by way of maturity, responsibility and kingly demeanor, and what he may have forfeited by turning his back on the rogue, Sir John Falstaff.\n\nTime and again throughout the film, Branagh’s rich vowels and bristling consonants add a cinematic vocabulary that enriches an already formidable verbal arsenal, that showcases some of drama’s most splendid speeches and soliloquies, including the famed “Not today O Lord, not today” gem he delivers on his knees on the night before the battle, in reflecting on his personal suffering. Of course the violent language Henry employs in haranguing the besieged townsmen of Halfleurs is absolutely shuddery.\n\nBut the battle with the French, which results in the most astounding verdict in English history, a battle where only sixteen English soldiers are killed, is rightfully the film’s thematic and visual centerpiece. Fought on a wet field in the muck and mire, and often filmed in slow-motion, Branagh makes his own anti-war statement in a powerful and poignant display of lost lives and senseless carnage. The scenes are in large measure reminiscent of the Battle of Shrewsbury in Chimes at Midnight or even in Kurosawa’s Ran. The director’s master stroke here is the use of a Latin hymn, Non Nobis Domine, an indescribably moving, epic and beautiful homage to fallen soldiers that begins acapella with a single voice and is later joined by vocal support and full musical accompaniment. This is one of those rare moments where the use of a single composition can virtually dictate the audience response, regardless of the visual tapestry, which is still rendered as captivatingly as could be imagined, with a besieged Henry surveying the field of dead, bloodied and humbled by the miracle that he credits “God” for extending to him and the English. The entire score of the film, composed by Patrick Doyle (whose finest work this is) is infused with an exhilarating blend of rousing bravado, and lyrical poignancy, the former, as the background soundtrack for the St. Crispin’s speech, and the latter during an extraordinary series of flashbacks near the conclusion, when Henry meets with defeated French king Charles to set the terms for surrender. The battlefield deaths of so many Frenchman are chronicled in the footage of the actual battle seen earlier in the film. On the British side, the death of the Duke of York and the young boy played by Christian Bale in his second film after Empire of the Sun, resonates emotionally.\n\nTechnically, the film is accomplished, particularly the contributions of cinematographer Kenneth MacMillan and celebrated costumer Phyllis Dalton, who collaborate on a ravishing color tapestry that re-creates the period with remarkable minimalism and which makes effective use of outdoor scenery. Similar to any stage play of this popular work, it’s the dialogue that really carries the day (pun intended) and the visual embellishments need not be more than modest.\n\nWhile this is Branagh’s show throughout, as he is the central star, director and artistic coordinator, he managed at the time to win the services of a number of the greatest British thespians, among them Brian Blessed, Ian Holm, the aforementioned Derek Jacobi and Christian Bale, Robbie Coltrane, Judi Dench, Emma Thomson as the French queen and Paul Scofield in a characteristically distinguished turn as the French king. The whole lot are divine, no doubt inspired by what was at the time unrivalled Branagh infectiousness. The star/director is so charismatic that he virtually dominates all the scenes he appears in, regardless of the splendid support he received throughout. It’s the way drama should be played: full-bodied, in your face and with a certain degree of bravado, that Branagh was able to give at the time without coming off as too self-assured. The result is a masterpiece of cinema, and a film that rightfully challenges Olivier’s version as the best cinematic version of Henry V."
