        "text": "Henry V, with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh\n\nIn our publication Land & People, 2014, we told the story of Jack McNamara taking part in the making of the film, Henry V with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, in Wicklow in 1943. We have since discovered that Barney Lynch of Lissane and his cousin Pat Lynch of Latoon were also involved. Also involved were Denis Hayes of Limerick, father of Seamus Hayes of Aonach an Chláir, with his brothers Jim and Paddy. Kevin Burke of Ballycar was another horseman who took his horse to Wicklow to join in the battle scenes in the film. So quite a contingent from Clare. The men and their horses earned £1 a day and shooting of the film took about six weeks.\n\nExtract from Land and People below\n\nBarney Lynch Jn.\n\nNora McNamara\n\nSeamus Hayes\n\nSeamus Hayes\n\nBarney Lynch Jn.\n\nSeamus Hayes\n\nSeamus Hayes\n\nEnnis Museum\n\nSeamus Hayes\n\nNora McNamara"
