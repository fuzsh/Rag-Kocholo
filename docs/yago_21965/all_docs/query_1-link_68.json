        "text": "The San Jacinto College South Theatre and Film program presents Henry V, an epic, swashbuckling, and funny tale of a rebellious young prince blossoming into a king at war, played in a new plain-English adaptation of the original William Shakespeare play.\n\nFor this adaptation, theatre professor Dr. Jonelle Walker flips the theatre experience on its head placing the audience on the stage and the action of the performance among the seats in the auditorium.\n\n“While this is a play about war, it is just as much a play about imagination,” said Walker. “Thoughtful scenery, costumes, and lighting will make the auditorium feel like 15th century France.”\n\nAdjunct professor Janessa Harris takes on the lighting challenge with enthusiasm.\n\n“Bold is my angle,” said Harris. “I desire to have my designs leave the stage with an impact. I leave my heart on the stage. Emotional connections lead me through my designs from feeling it to seeing it. I’m an architect breathing in a story and out into reality for many to consume and reflect.”\n\nSave the date and look for more information to come.\n\nHenry V presented by San Jacinto College Department of Theatre and Film\n\nWritten by William Shakespeare\n\nAdapted and directed by Dr. Jonelle Walker\n\nWhen:\n\nFeb. 29, March 1, 7, and 8 at 7 p.m.\n\nMarch 1, 2, and 9 at 2 p.m.\n\nWhere:\n\nSan Jacinto College South Campus\n\nFlickinger Fine Arts Center (Building 15)\n\nSan Jacinto College South Campus\n\n13735 Beamer Road, Houston, TX 77089\n\nAdmission:\n\nFree for San Jac students, staff, and faculty\n\n$5 for community members\n\nTickets available at sjcstheatrefilm.ludus.com\n\nCast:"
