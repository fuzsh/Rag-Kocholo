        "text": "(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nKenneth Branagh’s semi-autobiographical Belfast premieres this week (November 12). While Branagh doesn’t star in the film, he wrote and directed, with the story based on his childhood growing up in Northern Ireland.\n\nThis is just Branagh's latest project, with him being quite accomplished as an actor, writer and director.\n\nWe’ve compiled a roundup of his work, illustrating his growth as an entertainer and moviemaker (it even comes with a check list to keep things straight):\n\n1. Henry V\n\nWhen we think of Branagh, our mind goes straight to Shakespeare. One of his earliest roles was in 1989’s Henry V, with him portraying the young king. Set during the Hundred Years’ War, we see the English monarch set out to conquer France, where he meets Princess Katherine (Emma Thompson).\n\nIn addition to starring in the title role, Branagh adapted Shakespeare’s words for the screen and handled directing.\n\nActor = ✔\n\nWriter = ✔\n\nDirector = ✔\n\n2. Dead Again\n\nIn 1991, he teamed up with Thompson once again, with the two starring as love interests in Dead Again. Thompson portrays a woman with amnesia, and through hypnosis she witnesses a past life, where a woman, who looks very much like her, is murdered. She believes the killer to be Branagh’s character.\n\nThis time around, Branagh starred and directed, leaving the writing to Scott Frank.\n\nActor = ✔\n\nDirector = ✔\n\n3. Much Ado About Nothing\n\nCircling back to Shakespeare, Branagh starred in the 1993 comedy Much Ado About Nothing. He takes on the role of Benedick, a man who is tricked into admitting his love for another, Beatrice. She, on the other hand, is happily single… at least, that’s what she says. You can look for Thompson as Beatrice.\n\nFor this adaptation, Branagh handled the acting, writing and directing once again.\n\nActor = ✔\n\nWriter = ✔\n\nDirector = ✔\n\n4. The Gingerbread Man\n\nSwitching gears, we saw Branagh in the 1998 legal thriller The Gingerbread Man, based on John Grisham’s story, with Clyde Hayes writing the screenplay. He plays an attorney whose judgment is clouded after he falls for his client. He helps put her father in prison, proving dangerous for all involved.\n\nHe took the lead in this one, but before signing on, he asked to agree to the director (Robert Altman), reports EW.com.\n\nActor = ✔\n\n5. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nSince Harry Potter was already in full force by the time Branagh joined the franchise in 2002, we can easily say he did not write this one, as it’s based on J.K. Rowling’s fantastical novels. He put all of his attention on his character, portraying Gilderoy Lockhart, with Steve Kloves handling the screenwriting and Chris Columbus directing.\n\nActor = ✔\n\n6. Listening\n\nWe’re seeing a pattern — it seems that for every project Branagh directs, he casts himself in the lead, which… we don’t blame him. But, in 2003 he did write and direct a short film, entitled Listening, that he chose not to act in. It’s based at a spa where talking is not allowed, but falling in love is okay.\n\nWriter = ✔\n\nDirector = ✔\n\n7. Wallander\n\nOne of Branagh’s most recognizable roles is as Kurt Wallander in the crime series Wallander, which ran from 2008-2016. The series revolves around Swedish police officer Wallander, who puts all of his good stuff into his work, solving violent crimes. It doesn’t leave a lot for his personal life, causing problems in that area.\n\nWith Branagh taking on the title role, the directing was left to nine different directors, handling one or two episodes each.\n\nActor = ✔\n\n8. Murder on the Orient Express\n\nIn 2017, Branagh turned to Agatha Christie’s work, taking on the role of Belgian detective Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express. Set during the 1930s, Poirot is traveling on the transcontinental train when a murder takes place. He’s called on to investigate, with all of the passengers considered suspects.\n\nIn addition to starring, Branagh handled directing duties, with Michael Green writing the screenplay.\n\nActor = ✔\n\nDirector = ✔\n\n9. Tenet\n\nWe saw Branagh pop up in the sci-fi thriller Tenet in 2020. He takes on the role of a baddie named Sator. He’s a Russian businessman who is working to collect artifacts, which could destroy the Earth once all together. John David Washington’s character, simply known as Protagonist, is on a mission to stop him.\n\nChristopher Nolan wrote and directed Tenet, giving Branagh the chance to be all actor.\n\nActor = ✔\n\n10. Belfast\n\nAnd, going back to where we started, Branagh has written and directed the forthcoming film Belfast. The story takes place during the 1960s, revolving around a young boy growing up in Northern Ireland. His childhood is interrupted when the city is taken over by political unrest during a civil war.\n\nJude Hill takes on the role of 10-year-old Buddy, with Jamie Dornan starring as his Pa and Branagh staying behind the camera.\n\nWriter = ✔\n\nDirector = ✔"
