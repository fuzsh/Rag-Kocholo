        "text": "No, I wasn’t kidding about the Shakespeare last post. But is it wrong to call a film adaptation of a Shakespeare play a historical drama? I don’t think so, not when it’s an adaptation of one of his histories. The Bard wrote several plays meant to adapt real-world events, namely based on the lives of past kings of England. I don’t know why Macbeth and Julius Caesar are counted as tragedies instead of histories considering Macbeth and Caesar were also real guys, but I guess the academic types have their reasons for the classification.\n\nFor now I’m looking at the 1989 adaptation of Henry V, featuring Kenneth Branagh as director and in the title lead role King Henry V of England. Shakespeare’s histories generally focused on certain interesting periods and events of these kings’ lives, and for Henry that was his successful invasion of France and winning (or usurpation depending on how you see it — see Joan of Arc) of the French crown.\n\nAt the start of the play, Henry is holding court and hearing a legal argument from the Archbishop of Canterbury about why it’s cool for him to invade France because he’s the true heir of the French throne through his mother or father’s mother etc. Something about Salic law that disallowed matrilineal claims, only France isn’t part of the Salic land, which lies in Germany.\n\nThe Archbishop encourages Henry to invade, promising the Church will provide serious financial support, and Henry’s uncle Brian Blessed (aka the Duke of Exeter) backs him up. And then the messengers from the Dauphin, the French crown prince, arrive and make absolutely sure France gets invaded.\n\nThe rest of the play and film follow Henry and his inner circle as they lead an army into France and nearly get themselves captured/killed before facing the French armies at Agincourt. Even if you haven’t seen Henry V, you may already know the Battle of Agincourt of 1415, being one of the most famous battles in European history thanks to a lot of rain and mud that made the expensive, fancy French cavaliers totally ineffective against guys with longbows. After steamrolling the Dauphin, the Marshal of France, and several other major enemy nobles and their knights, Henry and his guys proceed to Paris where he marries King Charles VI’s daughter (played by his then actual wife Emma Thompson) and becomes his heir. (In reality, this took five years and a lot more negotiation than we see here probably, but who wants to sit through all that.)\n\nThe history is already interesting, but Shakespeare tells the story dramatically and adds a lot of nice fervor to it. Shakespeare is Shakespeare, anyway — you don’t need my opinion about his writing. This adaptation is also great, however, one of my childhood favorites from back when I was a boy as interested in knights beating each other with swords as you’d expect. The film has a monster cast: together with the excellent Branagh and Thompson, we get Brian Blessed (also Augustus), Ian Holm as Captain Fluellen (or properly Llywelyn — those Welsh names with all the extra consonants), Paul Scofield as the French king, Derek Jacobi as the Chorus (and also Claudius), Judi Dench as the tavern lady Mistress Quickly, a young Christian Bale as “Robin the Luggage-Boy”, and a lot of other great actors. And don’t forget Michael Maloney as the Dolphin.\n\nHenry V is mostly a war drama with some comedic breaks featuring a drunken group of thieves and bastards that Henry himself used to hang out with when he was still just the Prince of Wales. It’s important to take the play in context with what comes before it chronologically: the two-part Henry IV, about the reign of his father who usurped the throne from the previous Richard II (also depicted in the play Richard II.) Richard sucked as a king for all kinds of reasons, but the title of usurper still weighed on Henry IV and stained his rule, and on top of that his son Henry (aka Prince Hal) was a rowdy kid who seemed to have no interest in being a good king.\n\nBranagh gives us a few flashbacks to Henry IV to show just how much Henry has changed, becoming a serious, no-nonsense ruler who rejects his old friends who probably expected him to hold orgies at the palace or something. It’s too bad we don’t get more Sir John Falstaff, one of Shakespeare’s best characters (and most popular, since from what I’ve read Falstaff would bring crowds to the theater back then.) But then we get plenty of him in Henry IV, along with Orson Welles’ great movie Chimes at Midnight. This clip doesn’t have to do with Henry V, but I just really like it:\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Henry V the play, looking back at it, is just how much your opinion on Henry can change depending on where you’re standing. To the English, he was a hero who cleansed himself of his father’s stain of usurpation by beating up France and winning the position of heir. But to the French, I can only imagine. Henry’s war is just one part of a much larger conflict, the Hundred Years’ War, with a lot of fighting both before and after Agincourt — Henry’s far less capable son would lose all his gains, also depicted in Shakespeare’s Henry VI plays, and including a twisted version of Joan of Arc as a witch.\n\nI get the impression that modern versions of those plays show Joan in a more sympathetic light considering the dominant modern view of her as a great hero fighting to free her country from occupation. But that’s just what Henry V does. He doesn’t seem to me like the good guy here, even if he does have that complicated legal argument from the Archbishop about how he should be the king of France — his pursuit of that kingship gets a lot of people killed, including his own. To his credit, Shakespeare does address that, and though I don’t agree with the conclusion he reaches, I also didn’t grow up as the subject of a divinely appointed king (and I also wasn’t writing to puff up the ancestor of Queen Elizabeth or the following King James like Will was. But then I don’t blame him for that either. I probably would have done the same given how much of a police state England was back then.)\n\nBut if you want a historical piece that cleans up a past king a little (see the baggage train incident, which is still controversial even 600 years later) you couldn’t do better than Shakespeare, and if you want a Shakespeare adaptation, the same goes for Kenneth Branagh. This version of Henry V totally holds up and is worth watching, even with some newer adaptations like the BBC’s more recent Hollow Crown series taking on all the historical plays and a 2019 movie just titled The King.\n\nAnd if you want more Shakespeare talk from me, and why wouldn’t you, I’ve started watching The Hollow Crown. It’s very well done judging by the first entry, Richard II, which I have some things to say about. I hope you don’t mind the slight change in format with these posts, but history was always a favorite of mine, and dramatized history is fun to watch and pick apart — the more dramatized the better. Until next time, when it will be back to the usual for a while."
