        "text": "In 1989, a new movie adaptation of Shakespeare's play, \"Henry V\" was released. This was an impressive accomplishment for a couple of reasons. First of all, it was the first time since 1944 that the play had been filmed. The 1944 version starred- and was directed by- Lawrence Olivier. It must have been a daunting prospect to attempt a remake which would automatically be compared to that classic film. Incredibly, the task was undertaken by first-time director 28 year old Kenneth Branagh who, like Olivier before him, starred in the film as well as directed. And did a pretty amazing job at both.\n\nOf course, we should probably give a nod to William Shakespeare, who wrote the play in 1599. His brilliant writing provides the source material for Branagh's impressive directorial debut. Shakespeare's \"Henry V\" was the fourth in a series of plays, which started with Richard II, followed by Henry IV Parts I & II.\n\nAudiences of the time would therefore already be acquainted with the title character of King Henry V, as he had already appeared in Henry IV, portrayed as a somewhat wild and ungoverned young man.\n\nIronically, it is this back story which causes what I think is the biggest flaw with the movie. The scenes and flashbacks with Falstaff are rather draggy, slowing down the action. Of course, Branagh was in a bit of a hard place... he couldn't leave Falstaff out completely, because he's mentioned in the play (although he's on his death bed) and the character of Henry is more effective if contrasted with his younger self, Hal. The thing is, I don't think the flashbacks really do this effectively, so they just seem to be needless cutaways from the interesting story. This is also problematic because if someone watched the movie without knowledge of the previous plays, these flashback scenes would essentially be meaningless- there's not enough background information included to give them an emotional punch. But this really is a pretty minor complaint, and there is a lot to love about Branagh's \"Henry V\".\n\nThe character of Henry is an extremely interesting one. For much of the earlier plays- Henry IV Parts I & II- Henry is portrayed as wild-living, hanging out in taverns with lowlifes and criminals. He is dismissed by many- including his father- as being unsuited for kingship. His maturing into a skilled and effective leader can be viewed in two ways, the first being a prodigal amending his behaviour and growing into his responsibilities. The second way to view this radical character change is the way Henry himself suggests it occurred: his previous wild behaviour was mostly a pose, to provide a greater contrast when he resumes his rightful place and responsibilities at court, exciting admiration for his \"reformation\". So- genuine transformation, cynical maneuver, or a bit of both... you decide.\n\nOne result of this former behaviour, intentional or not, is that those around Henry tend to underestimate him. Whether the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Dauphin of France, or the conspirators attempting to assassinate him... they all find that Henry is no dilettante or pushover. Interestingly, it is King Charles, arguably the weakest character in the play, who sees Henry's character most clearly, warning the Dauphin not to underestimate him.\n\nAnother result of Henry's checkered past is that he is able to relate to people at all levels of society. He can be regal and kingly when he needs to be, or get down and dirty with the lowest soldiers in his army- for example, almost coming to blows with one of his soldiers while in disguise. It makes him seem more human, and able to talk to and inspire men of all ranks.\n\nHenry's character is a complex one. He is capable of warmth and charm- as we see in his scenes with Catherine- but also of being calculating and ruthless. This is exemplified by his execution of the conspirators and his willingness to condemn an old friend to death. Also, during the siege of Harfleur, Henry intimidates the citizens into surrendering by threatening to let loose his soldiers to rape and pillage if they keep resisting. I'm inclined to think that this was a tactic to terrify the people into surrendering, since everywhere else he forbade his soldiers to pillage, on pain of death... and after all, he wanted to become king of this land, so he probably didn't want to start off by making everyone hate him. Still, it was a nasty, nasty thing to threaten to do.\n\nHenry is also capable of self-doubt, almost verging on self-pity, as we see on the eve of the Battle of Agincourt when he is brooding on the burdens of leadership and his responsibility for the lives of his men. Yet there is no sign of this doubt the next day, when he climbs upon a wagon and rallies his tired and frightened men with words of utmost confidence. A very complicated man, is Hal.\n\nAs far as historical accuracy goes, Shakespeare- and consequently the movie- sticks fairly close to the events leading up to the Battle of Agincourt. Henry did base his claim to the French throne on Salic Law, and there was a plot by some of his nobles to have him assassinated. Reports of Henry's wild youth seem to have been greatly exaggerated, though not so much by Shakespeare as by some of the king's contemporary critics, apparently in an attempt to discredit him. If this was their intent, it backfired when Henry became such a competent leader, because it made him look like he reformed himself- and who doesn't like a good redemption story?\n\nKing Charles VI of France was indeed a weak king and, if anything, Shakespeare underplayed this. In reality, Charles was mentally disturbed and delusional... he went through periods when he thought he was made of glass, and ordered his clothes made with metal rods inserted to keep him from shattering. He also had fits of violence, during which he killed a few people, and almost killed his brother. This is what led to a lot of infighting and jockeying for position in France- and England- over who would be the next king. And Henry did marry Charles' daughter Catherine, but this wasn't his bright idea when he was discussing terms with the vanquished king... the possibility of a match between the two of them had been floated years before by the powers that be, when Catherine was only 13. She was, I think, 19 when they married.\n\nAs for the Battle of Agincourt itself, it was indeed an amazing victory for the English army. The French had every reason to expect to win: they outnumbered the English army by a ratio of at least five to one, and they were well-armed, well-mounted, and well-rested. Henry's army was hungry, sick, and had marched almost 300 miles in two and a half weeks. The French commanders were trying to delay the start of the battle, because there were even more of their troops on the way (hence the herald being sent to discuss the finer points of ransom). Henry would no doubt have preferred to avoid this particular fight entirely, given the state of his army, but instead goes on the attack. To wait would have meant even more troops arrayed against them, with more of his own men ailing and starving.\n\nIn the movie/ play, Henry gives the stirring Saint Crispin's Day speech which rallies his men to fight and triumph against overwhelming odds. In reality, the win had more to do with Henry's skill as a leader than with his brilliant oratory. He positioned his army in the narrowest part of the terrain, which meant the French troops couldn't make effective use of superior numbers, as they got congested and driven together, their mass actually becoming a detriment. As well, the huge French cavalry was hampered by the fact that the ground there was a mud pit, and the horses got bogged down. Also, Henry's army was making use of the English tactic of sharp stakes driven into the ground to repel the horses. Stuck in the mud, jammed together, and unable to retreat due to the enormous number of their own men charging behind them, many of the French were sitting ducks...er, canards... for the skilled and experienced English bowmen. Those who survived the onslaught of arrows were not out of danger... unhorsed, the French knights who were wearing heavy armour were no match for the much lighter arrayed Englishmen. Some eyewitnesses described seeing French knights stuck in the mud and unable to get up, drowning in their own helmets. This is a vastly simplified description of what went on, but does give you an idea of how the French army managed to lose what looked like a sure thing.\n\nThere are three film adaptations of \"Henry V\" that I know of: this one, the 1944 version by Olivier, and a 2012 made-for- TV version which I haven't seen, starring Tom Hiddleston as Henry. The 1944 Henry V is very different from Branagh's 1989 version, for a very good reason. WW II was going on, and the British government partially paid for the production of the movie, which was intended as propaganda to fire the patriotism of the Blitz- battered British, to encourage them \"once more unto the breach\". Thus, the nobility of Henry and the cause are played up, and scenes such as the execution of the conspirators and Henry's nasty threats at Harfleur are left out. Also, the battle takes place on a sunny, grassy field, not the rainy, mud and blood soaked terrain Agincourt actually would have been. I'm not criticizing this- more power to them- just noting how and why this movie was filmed the way it was.\n\nBranagh's film goes for a grittier, more realistic tone in the battle. The men are dirty, bloody, and exhausted. This exhaustion is demonstrated by a skillful use of slow motion during one scene in the battle... the action slows, and you feel the strain and effort it takes to keep lifting and striking with those heavy weapons, which seems to take forever. While not overly graphic, the film manages to portray the violence and terrible injuries and deaths which are the result of this type of warfare, and also the confusion of the battlefield. At the end of the day, Henry admits he doesn't know if they've one or lost- not until Mountjoy comes to offer the French army's surrender. Branagh's version also emphasizes the human aspect, more so than the 1944 film. If you watch that one, there are a lot of sweeping, distance shots, while Branagh filmed most of the battle scenes very close-up and personal. The same applies to the Saint Crispin's Day speech- a lot of Olivier's is shot from a distance, while with Branagh's, the camera is pretty much in his face- or in those of his men- for the entire time.\n\nOn the topic of that epic speech, I watched all three men's- Olivier, Branagh, and Hiddleston - versions of it while preparing this post, and of the three I must say that Branagh's interpretation of it is my favourite. He gives life and feeling to it in a way the other two don't... in my opinion, anyway... his speech has a humanity and warmth to it, which I could believe would actually make his men feel, down to the lowliest baggage boy, that they were a band of brothers.\n\nIf you couldn't tell, I really enjoyed this movie. I'm a history junkie and an Anglophile, so this sort of thing is tailor-made for me. While it's not without a (very) few flaws, it's an amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's work, and one I'll be watching again.\n\nI'm going to post all three versions of the Saint Crispin's Day speech below, so you can compare and decide for yourself which you prefer:"
