Directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, Henry V is a gritty adaptation of Shakespeare’s epic and brutal play. The BAFTA and Academy Award-winning film is widely considered one of the best Shakespeare film adaptations ever made, commended for the performances and direction as well as the accessibility of its Shakespearean language.\n\nPart of BFI presents Shakespeare on Film programme."
