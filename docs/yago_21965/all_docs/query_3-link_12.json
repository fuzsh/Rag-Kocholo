        "text": "Criterion Collection Spine #41\n\nHenry stepped out on stage, he said he was ready to kick ass, he kicked some French ass, and he brought home the motherfucking bacon! .... I am not used to my Shakespearean plays being so victorious!\n\n\"We charge you in the name of God, take heed how you awake our sleeping sword of war.\"\n\nIf you have seen Henry V you will surely know I am fluffing up the snooze fest that is the first half of this Laurence Olivier adaption. When it comes to Shakespeare it is best to know the story going in, but in this case I knew zip about old Henry V .... so let's see how that went....\n\n\"Self-love, my…\n\n☆\"Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,\n\nFrom this day to the ending of the world,\n\nBut we in it shall be rememberèd;\n\nWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers!\"☆\n\nLaurence Olivier brings the Bard to the big screen in the vibrant and epic Henry V from 1944, a not-so-subtle rendition made to rouse the British during wartime that also takes interesting creative turns while generally staying true to the original play.\n\nGenerally regarded as the first commercially successful film adaptation of a William Shakespeare play -- Olivier would follow this in 1948 with the much-lauded Hamlet that has since seen more muted acclaim by contemporary critics -- Henry V is not the most well-known production of Shakespeare (though…\n\nwe open our eyes to toys in a toyshop, men in silly dress-up in a make-believe land etching out the story of a lonesome bard. bright, warm pastel colours are the love language of this retelling of the past, and elongated speeches are the swords and shields (as much as knights here are willing to draw swords at the slightest sign of conflict, there's almost always a cause to use verbal rapiers instead and stick it to the opponent where it hurts). a neverending war between theatre and film, two incarnations of the same drive to express and tell stories, nears its climax as the characters inside the narrative, too, go clash swords. the battlefield, however beautiful to look at…\n\nI must admit I didn't see coming the whole opening and final shot. It was very immersive and surreal.\n\nLaurence Olivier has had some bad days at work, but thanks to works like this you can see he was indeed a thespian. It feels a bit too theatrical, though that makes all the sense of the world, not only because its based on a play, but like its established on the film itself, we're kinda watching a \"live\" version of a play.\n\nThe story, I mean, its Shakespeare... so it was pretty interesting and filled with some nice action and great dialogues. Personally I feel this one has the best, most genuine, less poetic dialogue from all the films I've…\n\nWinston Churchill asked Olivier for a patriotic wartime Henry V and he delivered. It's the invasion of Normandy, as Henry calls upon his men \"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or close the wall up with our English dead.\", While the enemy insults them, \"If the English had any apprehension, they would run away,\" and that \"You may as well say, that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.\" But the last word on the subject is Henry V and his St. Crispin's day speech, and I'm sure you've heard the phrase Band of Brothers? That's Shakespeare:\n\nWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers;\n\nFor he to-day that…\n\nMy kingdom for a wig!\n\nYou expect old and dusty, and you get full technicolor, playfulness, beautiful pre-Raphaelite paintings suddenly brought to life, cardboard cut-out castles and proudly presented painted backdrops, what could you want more?\n\nAs you can gather, I really enjoyed the experience, which started with a panoramic view of London in 1599-1600, at the time when Henry V was first performed. Lots of meadows, and then... there it is: the Globe! Which the audience watching this in 1944 got a tour of (it was not rebuilt in our era before 1993).\n\nActors are getting ready to perform their play. There is a wonderful game of showing us viewers the tricks of the trade, with onstage/backstage comings and…"
