Fresh to the throne, King Henry V launches England into a bloody war with France. When his campaign encounters resistance, this inexperienced new ruler must prove he is fit to guide a country into war.\n\nCaptured live from the Donmar Warehouse in London, this exciting modern production directed by Max Webster explores what it means to be English and Britain’s relationship to Europe, asking: do we ever get the leaders we deserve?\n\n“In this game of thrones Kit Harington’s young king is subtle, precise, steadily growing in resolution.”\n\n—Susannah Clapp for the Guardian (UK)\n\nAbout the filmmaker:\n\nMax Webster is a celebrated British theatre director who specializes in new work, opera and live music events.
