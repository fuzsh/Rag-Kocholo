        "text": "“Henry V” is a wonderful screen rendition of Shakespeare’s classic play penned in the late 1500's. Kenneth Branagh directs himself in this blockbuster film also featuring Derek Jacobi and Emma Thompson.\n\n“Henry V” is a tale of honor, perseverance, loyalty, and romance. King Henry the Fifth of England (Kenneth Branagh), thinking he has a right to the French throne, matches military forces against the French. The English forces are out numbered nearly 5-1, but they love their king and are willing to lay their lives down for him.\n\nIn his play, Shakespeare calls Henry the Fifth the “mirror of all Christian kings.” This film shows seldom seen or heard tributes to God and his sovereignty. Henry’s trust is in the Lord for the outcome of the battle.\n\nThe extent of the bad language in this film is the use of the word bastard occasionally. Near the end of the film, Henry courts the French Princess Katherine (Emma Thompson). This short and sweet courtship features a proposal that climaxes (to Shakespeare’s and the film writers credit) only with a kiss.\n\nThe reason for not recommending this film to younger viewers is a graphic battle scene between the English and French armies. There is also a short scene where a soldier is hanged for stealing, which would not be suitable for young viewers. Also, many children will not understand most of the dialogue, as it is spoken in Old English as it was written.\n\nKenneth Branagh as Henry the Fifth portrays the king in a breathtaking manner. Henry’s soliloquies, including the famous speech on Saint Crispin’s Day, could not have been better performed. The musical score adds to this film’s excellence.\n\n“Henry V” is both an educational and entertaining film, and promotes many Christian values. Rent this movie for your family to watch, and then read the original play!"
