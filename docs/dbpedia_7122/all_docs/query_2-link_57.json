        "text": "For commuters who wish to leave their vehicles behind and take the metro once the line to Gurgaon becomes functional, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has made adequate arrangements.\n\nParking facilities have been provided at all the five metro stations in the Gurgaon area, which will include the second largest parking lot on the metro network. According to DMRC officials, parking space will be available at HUDA City Centre, IFFCO Chowk, MG Road, Sikanderpur and Guru Dronacharya metro stations.\n\n“The HUDA City Centre metro station will have a parking space of 6,500 sq. m., which will be the second largest on the metro network after the parking lot at Kanaiyah Nagar of 7,042 sq. m. The other four metro stations in Gurgaon will have parking space of 5,950 sq. m. (IFFCO Chowk), 876 sq. m. (MG Road), 1,577 sq. m. (Sikanderpur) and 4,572 sq. m. (Guru Dronacharya),” said the spokesperson.\n\nWith this the total available parking space provided by DMRC is about 1,70,000 sq. m. in which about 15,000 four-wheelers and 20,000 two-wheelers can be accommodated. “At present, 59 of the 83 operational metro stations have parking lots for the convenience of commuters. The total parking lot in the Delhi Metro will go up to 63 after the Gurgaon section is opened to the public,” said the spokesperson.\n\nApart from Kanhaiya Nagar and HUDA City Centre, the other major parking lots of the DMRC are at Janakpuri West (6,383 sq. m), Yamuna Bank (6,300 sq. m) and Patel Chowk (6,065 sq. m.). So far the DMRC has provided three parking spaces on its National Capital Region network i.e. at Noida Sector 16, Botanical Garden and Noida City Centre metro station.\n\n“About 7 km of the elevated Gurgaon section of the Delhi Metro forms part of the under-construction 27-km-long Central Secretariat-Gurgaon corridor of the Delhi Metro which will be an extension of the Jehangirpuri-Central Secretariat line. Once the Central Secretariat corridor is opened to the public, it will roughly form a 45-km-long metro line connecting North Delhi, South Delhi and Gurgaon in one network,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe 12.53 km Central Secretariat-Qutub Minar section will be fully underground while the 14.47 km Qutub Minar-Gurgaon section will be fully elevated section of this line."
