The band consists of Bono (lead vocals), The Edge (guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass) and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion).\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe band formed in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical skill. By the mid-80s U2 had become one of the largest bands out there. They've worked a lot with Brian Eno, who has produced many of their albums. They were also one of the major contributors to Negativland's U2 single-slash-lawsuit. They're continuing to put out records and are staying popular.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nAlbums[]\n\nBoy\n\nOctober\n\nWar\n\nThe Unforgettable Fire\n\nThe Joshua Tree\n\nRattle And Hum\n\nAchtung Baby\n\nZooropa\n\nPop (U2)\n\nAll That You Can't Leave Behind\n\nHow To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\n\nUnder A Blood Red Sky\n\nU2 Love: Live From The Point Depot\n\nU2.Communication\n\nMelon\n\nThe Best Of 1980-1990\n\nThe Best Of 1990-2000\n\nThe Complete U2\n\nU2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky(video)\n\nRattle And Hum(video)\n\nAchtung Baby(video)\n\nZoo TV: Live From Sydney '\n\nElevation: Live From Boston\n\nU2 Go Home: Live From Slane Castle\n\nVertigo: Live From Chicago\n\nEPs[]\n\nThree\n\nWide Awake In America\n\n7\n\nExclusive (Stuck In A Moment Acoustic)\n\nLive From Under The Brooklyn Bridge\n\nSingles[]\n\nOrdinary Love\n\nInvisible\n\nAppears On[]\n\nCompilations[]\n\nSoundtracks[]\n\nThe Family Man\n\nThe Million Dollar Hotel\n\nMix CDs[]\n\nFurther Reading[]"
