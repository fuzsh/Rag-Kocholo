        "text": "Bono took this lyric from one of his key influences: King David, who wrote the Psalms. “I was always interested in the character of David in the Bible because he was such a screw-up. It’s a great amusement to me that the people God chose to use in the Scriptures were all liars, cheaters, adulterers, murderers. I don’t know which of those activities I was involved in at the time, but I certainly related to David. I was writing my psalm.” U2’s version of Psalm 40 (“I waited patiently for the Lord”) gave War its big finale and became one of their trusty concert-closing singalongs.\n\n“Sweetest Thing” began as Bono’s apology to\n\nhis wife, Ali, for spending her birthday in the studio, but it became so much\n\nmore. After releasing it as a B side to “Where the Streets Have No Name,”\n\nthe band gave it a face-lift with rejiggered vocals and new guitar textures for\n\na 1998 best-of compilation. U2 also made a video for the song that featured\n\nBono wooing Ali. After albums like Pop and Zooropa, it signaled a\n\nsongful return to form, paving the way for All That You Can’t Leave Behind. “It’s\n\npop as it should be – not produced out of existence, but pop produced with a\n\nreal intimacy and purity,” the Edge said.\n\nCo-produced by British trip-hop artist Nellee\n\nHooper, “Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me” dates back to the Zooropa\n\nsessions – on the album’s cover, it’s referred to in distorted purple\n\nletters spelling “ISSMEKILLM.” It emerged in 1995 as the lead single\n\nfrom the Batman Forever soundtrack – a rare move into blockbuster work\n\nfor Bono and the Edge, who had previously done music for artier films by directors\n\nlike Wim Wenders and Robert Altman. Though Bono originally balked at the idea,\n\nthe Edge said, “I figured it’d be good for us to be involved in something\n\nthat’s basically throwaway and lighthearted.” The gamble paid off, and it\n\nended up a bigger hit than anything off Zooropa, thanks to a track that\n\ngave their Nineties dance flavors a woozily anthemic feel. Bono sings, “They’ll\n\nwant their money back/If you’re alive at 33.” On the PopMart tour, the\n\nband made stark reference to the dark side of fame by projecting Warhol-esque\n\nimages of celebrities, many of whom had died young, including Jim Morrison, Ian\n\nCurtis, Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur.\n\nU2 began work on what would become No Line on the Horizon in 2006 with veteran producer Rick Rubin. But when those sessions proved unsuccessful, they soon returned to their longtime collaborators Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, traveling to Morocco to began recording as a six-piece band. They nailed the album’s pulsating title track – about a “girl, a hole in her heart” – in a single take. “It’s very raw and very to the point,” the Edge told Rolling Stone. “It’s rock & roll 2009.” Said Bono, “You could have called this album ‘The Pilgrim and His Lack of Progress,’ because all the characters are struggling to stay true to their values or want to realize their potential.”\n\nWhen Bono came up with the understated, soul-kissed “In a Little While,” he thought he’d written a simple little tune about stumbling home after a night out drinking and facing the inevitable hangover to come (“Friday night running/To Sunday on my knees”). But the song took on a new meaning when Joey Ramone died of cancer only a year after its release; the singer was a huge U2 fan who loved All That You Can’t Leave Behind, and he had been listening to “In a Little While” in the hospital during his final moments. “Joey turned this song about a hangover into a gospel song,” Bono said later. “That’s the way I always hear it now, through Joey Ramone’s ears.”\n\nFor 2014’s Songs of Innocence, U2 created a concept album based on their experiences growing up in Dublin. “We wanted to make a very personal album,” Bono told Rolling Stone. “Let’s try to figure out why we wanted to be in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys – first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually. And that’s hard. But we went there.” “Volcano,” which kicks off with a throbbing bass hook written by the Edge, taps the anger Bono felt as a teenager until he joined his band. “You were alone,” he sings. “But now you are rock & roll.”\n\nThis pulsating, celestial-effects ballad, the concluding track on Achtung Baby, wasn’t originally intended for U2; Bono wrote the song (on piano, which he rarely did) with R&B-soul diva Nina Simone in mind before U2 kept it for themselves. The Edge has said the song has “probably one of Bono’s finest lyrics”; the reference to “a little death,” Bono has said, “can be taken to mean a faint during orgasm but also works as an image of terrorism. … I was mixing up the personal and the political.” The personal factored into the music as well: Recording his solo, the Edge, who was separating from his wife, “played until the strings came off,” Bono said.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the Stooges’ raucous,\n\nproto-punk classic “1969” (hardly the stuff of hit singles in 1988),\n\nBono and the Edge wrote a song that made the Billboard Top Five and earned U2\n\none of their first Grammys. Bono has said the tune displayed “the\n\nreligiosity of rock & roll concerts” as well as his own “lust for\n\nsuccess.” Driven by a thunderous Bo Diddley rumble and capped off with\n\nBono’s searing harmonica solo, it provided a sharp contrast to the uplifting\n\nexpansiveness of The Joshua Tree, let alone anything else on the radio. “I\n\nliked the fact that it was totally not what people were listening to,” the\n\nEdge has said. “It was a rock & roll record – not a pop song.”\n\nThis dense, tribal-stomp track – which Bono described as being inspired by “a conversation between Jesus and Judas” – defines U2’s nothing-is-simple dictum when writing songs. Bono initiated the riff for a song called “Fat Boy,” but it didn’t go anywhere – until the Edge picked up on it and refashioned the part as the band’s contribution to the soundtrack for Wim Wenders’ film Until the End of the World. Not only did the re-recorded, revved-up new version wind up on U2’s own album as well, but, as the Edge has said, “We told Wim, ‘You can have it, but we want it too. … By the way, we’re borrowing your title!'”\n\n“I’ve written a song now that’s like a\n\ntwo-finger salute to the people who tried to foist a sense of guilt on us\n\nbecause we’re successful,” Bono said. “The thing is, we always wanted\n\nto be one of the biggest bands in the world.” On “Gone,” he\n\ntakes on the price of fame (“You get to feel so guilty/Got so much for so\n\nlittle”) over guitar that’s like a drill boring into glass. “The\n\nsounds that a guitar is capable of creating are, at this point, cliché,”\n\nthe Edge said. “The challenge is to find things you can do with the\n\ninstrument that are not already used up.” On the PopMart Tour, “Gone”\n\nwas occasionally dedicated to late INXS vocalist Michael Hutchence. Said Bono\n\nat one show, “Going … going … but never gone.”\n\nBono was a close friend of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, and the singer’s 1997 suicide impacted him very deeply. On the soulful “Stuck in a Moment You Can’t Get Out Of,” Bono carries on a conversation that he never got to have with his departed friend. “I just knew that if Michael had hung around an extra half an hour, he would have been OK,” Bono said. “I feel the biggest respect I could pay to him was not to write some stupid, soppy fuckin’ song. So I wrote a really tough, nasty little number, slapping him around the head. And I’m sorry, but that’s how it came out of me.”\n\nU2 began work on “City of Blinding Lights” during the Pop sessions, but they didn’t get around to finishing it until How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb seven years later. Bono’s lyrics were inspired by his first trip to London with his wife, when they were teenagers, and the band’s first trip to New York, in 1980. “It’s an area of Bono’s lyric writing that I really like,” the Edge said. “It’s cinematic, conjuring up a place and time. New York is a city that really brings you somewhere, a state of mind.” The song got a second life when Barack Obama used it during campaign events in 2008.\n\n“We had a great life, we’re listening to a lot of dance music, staying up all night,” Bono told Rolling Stone. “We’re young, our friends around. It was just a wonderful time, and\n\nwe tried to capture this in songs like ‘Discothèque.'” As the first single\n\nfrom 1997’s Pop, “Discothèque” was the initial volley for the\n\nband’s brief late-Nineties foray into electronic music, perhaps the most\n\npolarizing moment of U2’s career. The song – which Bono called an “earnest\n\nlittle riddle about love … just disguised as trash” – came equipped with a\n\nbrittle techno feel and a music video where the band dressed up like the\n\nVillage People. “We’re actually trying to make a kind of music that doesn’t\n\nexist yet,” Bono said of U2’s new sound. “That is a terrifying place\n\nto be.” His trepidation was not unwarranted: Reception to the bold change\n\nwas mixed (“U2 sounded inspired,” said The New York Times. “Now\n\nit sounds expensive”); and though Pop debuted at Number One, it\n\nfell out of the Top 10 three weeks later, leading some to believe U2 had lost\n\ntheir commercial instincts. “We don’t just live in the U.S.,” Bono\n\ntold Rolling Stone. “It was Number One in 28 countries. I can’t believe\n\npeople think that’s not enough. What do they want from us?”\n\nThis searing, cathartic song from No Line on the Horizon originally had two competing sets of lyrics: one about Nelson Mandela and the other a more personal tale of redemption inspired by James Joyce’s Ulysses. The second version ultimately won out. Co-producer Brian Eno estimated the song went through 80 incarnations in the studio. Live, it was a nightly highlight of the 360 ̊ Tour, even as many other songs from No Line fell by the wayside. “There’s this theme running through the album of surrender and devotion and all the things I find really difficult,” Bono said. “All music for me is worship of one kind or another.”\n\n“It was a soundtrack piece I’d been messing around with on the piano at home,” said the Edge of this powerfully atmospheric, multilayered song, which weaves together multiple verse and chorus melodies – “It’s classical, almost.” The title was taken from an exhibit of the same name at Chicago’s Peace Museum, a collection of art by survivors of the U.S. bombings of Japan during World War II that left a strong impression on the band. The song, a favorite of Bono’s father, is “very evocative of a city, in this case Tokyo,” said the singer, “coming like a phoenix out of the ash.” But it’s also a love song, with lyrics – “your eyes, as black as coals” – that may refer to Bono’s wife, Ali.\n\nOne of Bono’s most heartfelt love songs, the glimmering ballad “All I Want Is You” is a tender tribute to his wife, Ali. “That’s a song about commitment,” he said. The Edge worked out its pensive chord progression around the same time he and Bono wrote “Desire,” but it took the cinematic string arrangements of Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks to push the song over the top. (Edge called Parks’ contribution “haunting” and “gorgeous.”) “‘All I Want Is You’ is probably the best of what we were trying to do with [Rattle and Hum], in that it has a traditional basis, but it was a truly U2 song,” the Edge said.\n\nThe spare, elegant sound of Zooropa‘s third and final single was a successful attempt at a tribute to Frank Sinatra. “I mean, no one is going to mistake us for Frank Sinatra’s backing band,” said Clayton. “A very humble little combo sound is what we ended up with, and that really worked.” The song originated in the Achtung Baby sessions, and was revived when German filmmaker Wim Wenders needed a title track to his 1993 movie Faraway, So Close! “The film was about angels who want to be human and want to be on Earth,” said Bono. “But to do so, they have to become mortal. That was a great image to play with – the impossibility of wanting something like this, and then the cost of having it.”\n\n“We spent months farting around with it,” said Clayton about “Mofo.” “And then we said to Flood, ‘Let’s hip-hop it, let’s strip it back, let’s get a beat together, let’s see where it goes.'” They ended up with the hardest-hitting electronica experiment on 1997’s Pop, big-beat techno redolent of contemporary acts like the Crystal Method and the Future Sound of London. But while the music shot toward the future, Bono mined his past. “It was as if my whole life was in that song,” he said. “It was extraordinary playing ‘Mofo’ live. The song would come to a shuddering halt, and there I was, just speaking to my mother in front of 50,000 of my closest friends.”\n\nThe opening track of The Unforgettable Fire – U2’s first collaboration with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois – was worked up in\n\nBono’s actual home, a converted 19th-century Martello defense tower on the\n\nIrish coast. Fittingly, the song feels like a military march, albeit one\n\nascending into heaven. It was inspired by the Romanian-Jewish poet Paul Celan,\n\nwho – like U2 – wrestled with notions of spiritual faith in his work, and who\n\nfamously described poems as paths “for projecting ourselves into the\n\nsearch for ourselves. … A kind of homecoming.” Above the Edge’s guitar\n\nabstractions are some of Bono’s most potent verses, a paddle wheel of images,\n\npledges and chants that conjure a ravaged battlefield of the heart. “A lot\n\nof rock & roll is banal ideas well-executed,” Bono humble-brags. “Whereas\n\nI think a lot of what we do is really very interesting ideas, badly executed. ‘A\n\nSort of Homecoming’ involved a lot of very interesting ideas, well-executed.”\n\nU2 superfan Chris Martin concurred: “I know [it] backward and\n\nforward. … It’s so rousing, brilliant and beautiful. It’s one of the first\n\nsongs I played to my unborn baby.”\n\nU2 were still in their teens when they introduced themselves with “Out of Control” – the song was written on Bono’s 18th birthday. But they were already earnest young men, brooding over childhood angst with lines like “Monday morning/Eighteen years of dawning.” It appeared on their debut release in September 1979, a three-song seven- and 12-inch that cracked the Top 20 of the Irish singles charts. Like a lot of the tunes on Boy, it echoes the goth punk of bands like Joy Division or Siouxsie and the Banshees. Bono once mused, “I would like to do that album again, if nothing else to stop singing like Siouxsie Sioux.”\n\nIn an essay Bono wrote for Rolling Stone to honor the late Lou Reed in 2013, he cited “Running to Stand Still” as “redhanded proof” of U2’s debt to the hugely influential musician. Lyrically, it’s one of several U2 songs that take on the subject of addiction. Opening with a Delta-steeped slide guitar, the song turns into a fragile benediction with a melody similar to Reed’s Velvet Underground classic “Heroin.” “Running to Stand Still” was improvised almost whole-cloth live in the studio; producer Daniel Lanois later recalled “a really wonderful communication happening in the room at that time.” Said the Edge, it’s “amazing in one go to get that much of a song.”\n\nInspired by the plight of Burmese political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi, “Walk On” is about the strength it takes to make a great sacrifice for a just cause. A section from the song’s spoken-word intro gave U2 the title for one of their most inspirational albums: “And love is not the easy thing/The only baggage you can bring/Is all that you can’t leave behind.” “It is a mantra, really, a bonfire of the vanities,” Bono said. “Whatever it is you want more than love, it has to go.” Aided by a soaring guitar melody (one of the Edge’s best of the 2000s), “Walk On” charted all over the world and won a Grammy for Record of the Year. Live, it became a nightly tribute to Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released in 2010.\n\nIn 1991, it would have been hard to imagine U2 as anything close to a dance band, but “Mysterious\n\nWays,” a Top 10 hit from Achtung Baby, proved that was more than\n\npossible. Brian Eno, who played a huge role in their transformation, aptly\n\ndescribed the song as “heavy bottomed and lightheaded.” The track was\n\nbuilt out of Clayton’s swooping bass part, which had been taken from an\n\nunreleased song called “Sick Puppy,” and the rhythms on the finished\n\ntrack, complemented by co-producer Daniel Lanois’ congas, give the song a swaying\n\npulse. Bono’s lyrics – an ode to the power of female allure – are as joyful as\n\nhe would ever get.\n\nOriginally conceived around the same session as 1988’s “Desire” – and based around a riff the Edge called “about as close as we could or would ever want to get to the Rolling Stones” – the song, first called “The Real Thing,” was transformed during the sessions for Achtung Baby. Starting with its whirring-siren intro, the track took on a shadowy, throbbing energy, driven by the Edge’s effects pedal. Bono said his lyrics were “reflective of the times we were living in, when people were no longer looking for the truth. We are all looking for instant gratification.”\n\n“It’s coming from a very dark place,” Bono said of the opening track – and crowning moment – on U2’s debut, noting that it was inspired by “real anger and an enormous sense of\n\nyearning.” Written about the love between a son and his mother (Bono’s\n\ndied when he was a teen), it gave stomping U.K. post-punk a heraldic urgency. “I\n\nremember picking up Edge’s guitar and playing the two-stringed chord … to show\n\nthe others the aggression I wanted,” Bono recalled. “The percussion\n\nin the drop was a bicycle spinning, wheels upside down and played like a harp\n\nwith a kitchen fork.” “I Will Follow” quickly became their live\n\ntrump card; the Edge recalled a Boston gig where they played it three times, as\n\nset opener, closer and encore, to a rapturous crowd. “We left the stage\n\nfeeling incredible.”\n\nThe standout track from U2’s 2009 album, No Line\n\non the Horizon, and the song that ended nearly every show of their two-year\n\nU2 360 ̊ stadium odyssey, is a seven-and-a-half-minute meditation on addiction.\n\n(The term “moment of surrender” is Alcoholics Anonymous lingo for the\n\ninstant in which an addict admits helplessness.) “The character in the\n\nsong is a junkie, so that’s where I got it,” Bono told Rolling Stone in\n\n2009. “I know a lot of people who have had to deal with demons in\n\ncourageous ways. Maybe there’s a part of me that thinks, ‘Wow, I’m just an inch\n\naway.'” Producer Daniel Lanois, who has struggled with his own addiction\n\nissues in the past, came up with the chorus melody. The rest of the song was\n\nwritten during an impromptu jam, with the band improvising the version that\n\nended up on the album out of thin air in one take. “That spirit blows\n\nthrough every now and then,” Bono told Rolling Stone as U2 were preparing\n\nto release No Line on the Horizon. “It’s a very strange feeling. We’re\n\nwaiting for God to walk into the room – and God, it turns out, is very\n\nunreliable.”\n\n“It doesn’t sound like anything else of its time,”\n\nthe Edge said of the first single from The Joshua Tree. “It’s not\n\ncoming from an Eighties mentality. It’s coming from somewhere completely\n\ndifferent.” With its stark sound and low-key video, “With or Without\n\nYou” cut through the bloat and slickness of Eighties rock (“It\n\nwhispers its way into the world,” Bono said), giving U2 their first Number\n\nOne hit in the U.S. and turning the band into reluctant pop stars. “You\n\ndon’t imagine hearing it [on the radio],” Clayton said. “Maybe in a\n\nchurch.” The song’s lyrics were sparked by heroes of the U.S. civil rights\n\nmovement and the “new journalism” of the 1960s. Yet “With or\n\nWithout You” – rooted in a simple bass groove and an ethereal guitar that\n\nframes Bono’s yearning vocals – remains one of U2’s most universal songs to\n\ndate, a meditation on the painful ambivalence of a love affair. Bono insisted\n\nit was “about how I feel in U2 at times: exposed. I know that the group\n\nthinks I’m exposed and that I give myself away. I think if I do any damage to\n\nU2, it’s that I’m too open.”\n\nOpening with nearly two minutes of the Edge’s shimmering guitar, the first song on The\n\nJoshua Tree is an evocation of freedom at its most open-ended. The Edge\n\ncame up with the basic track in his home studio, with the finished product\n\ngrowing out of a characteristically painstaking process that proved so trying,\n\nco-producer Brian Eno later said half the time recording the album was spent on\n\nthat song. “We had this giant blackboard with the arrangement written on\n\nit,” Daniel Lanois told Rolling Stone. “I felt like a science\n\nprofessor conducting them.” Bono later said, “It contains a very\n\npowerful idea. You can call it ‘soul’ or ‘imagination,’ the place where you\n\nglimpse God, your potential, whatever.” For its iconic video, an homage to\n\nthe Beatles’ final performance, the band played atop a Los Angeles liquor\n\nstore, tying up traffic for hours. “It’s been ripped off hundreds of\n\ntimes,” recalled director Meiert Avis. “But the excitement comes from\n\nthe rebellion; the taste of freedom lights up the fans and the band.”\n\n“Bad” is a powerful song about a painful\n\nsubject. Bono wrote it to address the rampant heroin abuse that was crippling\n\nrecession-plagued Dublin during the early Eighties, basing his lyrics on the\n\nexperiences of people he knew personally. “I’ve always had a real respect\n\nfor responsible people,” Bono said, discussing the song. “But I also\n\nhave a real respect for irresponsible people. There is that side of me that\n\nwants to run.” The hypnotic, Velvet Underground–inspired track took just\n\nthree takes to record, with Brian Eno adding keyboards and minimal overdubs.\n\nBut “Bad” really took off live as a surging communal hymn; radio DJs\n\nhave been choosing the version on the 1985 concert EP Wide Awake in America over\n\nthe studio version for decades, and the triumphant 12-minute version U2 played\n\nat Live Aid in 1985 (during which Bono brought a woman out of the crowd and\n\ndanced with her) became one of the festival’s most memorable moments. Recalled\n\nAdam Clayton, “It’s only after six months of touring it and talking to\n\ndifferent people that you get to the inner truths of the song.”\n\n“There’s been a lot of talk about this next song,”\n\nBono famously tells the crowd in the version of “Sunday Bloody Sunday”\n\nthat appeared in Live: Under a Blood Red Sky. “Maybe too much talk.”\n\nIt was a new level of ambition for U2: “We were trying to be the Who meets\n\nthe Clash,” Bono later said. His inspiration: the 1972 massacre when\n\nEnglish soldiers shot and killed 14 unarmed protesters in the Northern Irish\n\ntown of Derry. “We realize the potential for division in a song like that,”\n\nthe Edge told a journalist. “So all we can say is that we’re trying to\n\nconfront the subject rather than sweep it under the carpet.” It wasn’t the\n\nfirst song about Bloody Sunday – John Lennon and Paul McCartney both had\n\nprotest records in stores before 1972 was over. But U2 made it a grand\n\nstatement of militant Christian pacifism, with Larry Mullen Jr.’s martial\n\ndrums, violin from Steve Wickham – a stranger the Edge met at a Dublin bus stop\n\n– and Bono waving a white flag onstage. As Bono told Rolling Stone at the time,\n\n“I’m not interested in politics like people fighting back with sticks and\n\nstones, but in the politics of love.”\n\nAfter spending the Nineties creating music that didn’t\n\nsound anything like the anthemic albums that had won U2 a massive audience\n\nduring the Eighties, the band decided to kick off the 2000s by getting back to\n\nbasics. “There was a big debate over the guitar sound on ‘Beautiful Day,'”\n\nthe Edge said. “That was really the sound of U2, the sound we made our own\n\nand abandoned. Whether or not we should bring it back became a real talking\n\npoint.” The group ultimately combined an unmistakable stripped-down sound\n\nwith co-producer Brian Eno’s electronic flourishes, and Bono wrote a set of\n\nlyrics about the importance of embracing painful moments that were inspired by\n\nAustralian preacher John Smith. “He talked to me about how depression is a\n\nnerve end,” said Bono. “Pain is evidence of life.” “Beautiful\n\nDay” exploded onto radio in late 2000; it won U2 a Grammy for Song of the\n\nYear and helped their transcendent comeback album All That You Can’t Leave\n\nBehind win Record of the Year. When Bono accepted one of the awards, he\n\nsaid the band was “reapplying for the job of the best band in the world.”\n\n“The music that really turns me on is either running toward God or away from God,” Bono told Rolling Stone. U2’s second Number One single revels in ambivalence – “an anthem of doubt more than faith,” Bono has called it. The song was typical of the arduous sessions that went into creating The Joshua Tree: Originally called “Under the Weather,” it began, like most U2 songs, as a jam. “It sounded to me a little like ‘Eye of the Tiger,’ played by a reggae band,” the Edge recalled. “It had this great beat,” producer Daniel Lanois said. “I remember humming a traditional melody in Bono’s ear. He said, ‘That’s it! Don’t sing any more!’ – and went off and wrote the melody as we know it.” The song’s lyrics were full of religious allusions, classic images steeped in the tradition of American gospel music that the band filled with new meaning and purpose. “I was rooting around for a sense of the traditional and then trying to twist it a bit,” Bono told the magazine in 1987. “That’s the idea of ‘I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For.'”\n\nIn a catalog devoted to exploring romantic love, spiritual faith and social justice, no single U2 song unites all these themes as potently as this supreme soul ballad. “It’s [about] coming together, but not the old hippie idea of ‘Let’s all live together,'” Bono said. “It is, in fact, the opposite. It’s saying, ‘We are one, but we’re not the same’ … [and] we have to get along together in this world if it is to survive.”\n\nThe lyrics, informed by tensions within U2 at the time, “fell out of the sky, a gift,” recalled Bono. “‘One,’ of course, is about the band.” The music, born of paired Edge guitar riffs, was painstakingly sculpted by producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who added tension to the gentle beauty. The result is an immaculate balance of the intimate and anthemic. The understated rhythm section and Edge’s rainbow hues map Bono’s journey from the near-whispered opening (“Is it getting better?”), to the bridge where he declaims “love” in a cracked holler, to the falsetto outro, all pain and fierce hope. “One” reflects many geopolitical rifts – it was recorded in Germany, as the Cold War was coming to an end, and mixed in Ireland. Bono later recalled “going around Europe when stuff was going on in Bosnia, sometimes 300 miles from where we were playing.” Released as a single to benefit AIDS research, it spoke to families riven by the disease and to all embattled lovers. Singers from Johnny Cash to Mary J. Blige have covered it, Michael Stipe memorably sang it at an MTV event celebrating Bill Clinton’s inauguration, and Axl Rose called it “one of the greatest songs that’s ever been written,” adding that, when he first heard it, “I just broke down crying.”"
