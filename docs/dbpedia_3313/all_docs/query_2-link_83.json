        "text": "24 To Fight For: U2\n\nListen To The List – https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1G0W5DCJt5XSBJgYPc1eaW\n\nImagine if you had to choose a desert island playlist for a band you really love. Imagine if for some reason you were going away and could only take a single 24 song playlist with you for that beloved group and that those would be the only songs by that artist that you could ever listen to again. What would you choose? What 24 songs would you fight for and say that these songs are your personal favorites and/or the best that the artist has to offer. That is the premise of my 24 To Fight For playlists. For this project I will choose my personal favorites from an artist and make the tough call of ranking those songs from #24 to #1 (trying to NOT let the fact that some songs may be overplayed influence me but basing them on my original feelings are much as possible). This is my list and I would love to see you play along and make yours too! What songs would you fight for?\n\nAUTHOR’S NOTE: This one was a beast. U2 has a huge and deep discography that spans many different styles and sounds and in the end there were at least a dozen more songs that I really wanted to include. In fact, two albums – October and How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb – are completely unrepresented. However, rules are rules and 24 is the limit I have set. I think fans of the band will find many of the classics and hits here but they may also be surprised (and possibly shocked) at some of the songs I left off my list and some of the ones I included. Here are my 24 songs that I would fight for from U2.\n\n#24 – “Zooropa” – From the album Zooropa\n\nThe Zooropa album was originally meant to be an EP that would be released to introduce fans to a few new songs that the band was going to add to their mammoth Zoo TV tour. However, while recording it U2 were struck with a creative spark and ended up recording a whole album’s worth of material. The loose, almost haphazard manner in which the album was created can be felt across the record as the band allowed themselves to indulge in a further exploration of the trashy, Euro-centric, junk culture tone of Achtung Baby that was full of experimentation, strange detours, and a few classics. Overall, I have always felt that the Zooropa album works better as a whole than it does as individual parts. That said, one of its standout moments is the opening title track “Zooropa”, a song that manages to marry the anthemic and cinematic feel of The Joshua Tree era U2 with the dance-inflected and ironic Achtung Baby. Indeed, nowhere does the sound and tone of U2’s two masterpiece albums fuse better than on “Zooropa”.\n\n#23 – “Red Hill Mining Town” – From the album The Joshua Tree\n\nNearly every song on The Joshua Tree is absolutely stunning and it is likely that if I asked 50 other U2 fans to make their lists that every single song would be included by someone. Ultimately, I only included four songs from The Joshua Tree but one of them is “Red Hill Mining Town”. I love Adam Clayton’s bass work on the track which beats like a living heart, while Bono sings one of U2’s more overtly political songs (outside of War); singing about the 1984 National Union of Mineworkers strike in the United Kingdom. Bono’s impassioned vocal creates both a sense of empathy for the workers while also giving us a sense of their desperate plight as they struggle against the government’s decision to close the mines and end their livelihood. The genius of “Red Hill Mining Town” though is that while it is clearly inspired by this event it has enough depth to also be interpreted in other ways.\n\n#22 – “Staring At The Sun” – From the album Pop\n\nPop was a divisive album for U2’s fans. It was the moment where U2 took the trashy and ironic dance-rock of their 90’s sound and twisted it inward to its ultimate, and probably inevitable, conclusion. I always liked Pop better than most and thought it was a solid album. That said, it was also obviously the end of that era of the band. However, at the heart of Pop, buried amidst the dance experiments and junk culture rock of the bulk of the album was “Staring At The Sun”, a song that always felt to me like U2’s attempt at a Beatles song. Sure, it has some production flourishes and The Edge’s guitar sounds like The Edge as it noodles around the melody, but at its heart “Staring At The Sun” feels like the sunny, psychedelic pop made by The Beatles over the back half of their career. Indeed, U2 seems to have decided to dip their toe into the Britpop scene’s love for danceable rock and British Invasion era-influenced pop and beaten many of those bands at their own game.\n\n#21 – “Seconds” – From the album War\n\nI have always loved songs that have a pulsing, driving bassline that carry the song and “Seconds” fits that bill perfectly. Larry Mullen’s drumming has a crisp martial feel that interweaves deftly with Clayton’s bass part and the two working together really make “Seconds” a song that is dominated by the rhythm section; a difficult feat in a band that usually features The Edge’s textured guitar and Bono’s incredible voice. Thus, “Seconds” is the rare U2 song that really showcases Clayton and Mullen over their bandmates. The album War finds U2 embracing big themes and big sounds and “Seconds” is a Cold War era anti-nuclear war anthem that feels perfectly at home on War with its focus on conflicts of all kinds. I also think the sampled American military chant is perfectly placed and makes the song even stronger.\n\n#20 – “Stay (Faraway, So Close!)” – From the album Zooropa\n\nAs I mentioned above when discussing the song “Zooropa”, I think that the Zooropa album as a whole is greater than the sum of its individual parts, but “Stay” is the exception to the rule. A sweeping, building ballad “Stay” is the one song on Zooropa that really rises above the album and feels like a classic U2 song. That said, “Stay” also has enough sonic trickery to feel at home in the Zoo TV era of the band. A classic track that is often overlooked because it is on Zooropa rather than Achtung Baby.\n\n#19 – “Walk On” – From the album All That You Can’t Leave Behind\n\n“Walk On” is both inspired by and dedicated to Burmese pro-democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi and was the Grammy award in 2002 for Best Song (marking the first time in history a band had won that award in consecutive years for two songs from the same album as “Beautiful Day” had won in 2001) who lived under house arrest separated from her husband from 1989-2010. The heart and soul of U2’s very good 2000 album All That You Can’t Leave Behind “Walk On” is an uplifting and anthemic song of hope and change that is rooted in the sincerity of U2’s early career rather than the irony of their 90’s work. I have especially always like the “all that you…” coda of the song which somehow takes a very good, if a little safe, song and makes it stand out.\n\n#18 – “Every Breaking Wave” – From the album Songs of Innocence\n\nWhen U2 dropped their album Songs of Innocence into everyone’s iTunes accounts for free without asking, it rubbed a lot of people the wrong way and many never gave the album a fair listen. In fairness, Songs of Innocence is not a classic album, but it is better than it is usually given credit for and its second track “Every Breaking Wave” is both a late career highlight and a near-classic. The song is both melodic and a touch melancholy, and it feels like classic U2 without ever really recalling an earlier, better song in their discography. Indeed, if “Every Breaking Wave” had been on Rattle & Hum or All That You Can’t Leave Behind, the two albums it sounds most like, it would have been a hit, but U2 were too far past their commercial peak and too wounded by the iTunes debacle for the song to get the attention it deserved, which is too bad because “Every Breaking Wave” is great.\n\n#17 – “Desire” – From the album Rattle & Hum\n\nAs is fitting for a song written for Rattle & Hum, U2’s homage to American rock and its influences, “Desire” is built up from a shuffling Bo Diddley beat. However, “Desire” is no mere rewrite or copycat of an earlier style. Indeed, “Desire” rushes forward with an almost punk-like recklessness that captures the desperate need of one who feels the heat of desire and is looking for release. “Desire” feels sweaty and fevered and has a punch to it that makes it a deserved hit and one of the few moments on Rattle & Hum that really rises above the concept of the record and shines on fully on its own merits.\n\n#16 – “An Cat Dubh” – From the album Boy\n\nMany casual fans of U2 don’t realize that U2 started life as a post-punk band not too far removed from groups like Siouxsie & The Banshees, Joy Division, The Cure, and others. Indeed, The Edge’s textured, processed and wiry guitars are deeply rooted in the sound of post-punk and much of U2’s debut album Boy has a gloomy, atmospheric tone. Nowhere is that early sound more prevalent than on the amazing album cut “An Cat Dubh”. While sung in English the title means “The Black Cat” in Irish Gaelic and this early career moody masterpiece features guitars that whine and moan like a distraught feline while Bono sings an ode to a predatory lover that he both wants and knows he should avoid. The song has a dark menace and sexy slink to it that is rarely heard on later U2 songs and is an interesting look into what a less commercial U2 might have sounded like in an alternate universe. Quite frankly, I have always loved it (Adam Clayton’s bass work is great too) and sort of wished U2 had pursued this direction more often. “An Cat Dubh” is sequenced on the album to run nearly as one track with “Into The Heart”, the song that comes after it, and they are almost always played together when played live as well; however, for whatever reason I prefer “An Cat Dubh” without “Into The Heart” tacked on.\n\n#15 – “Mysterious Ways” – From the album Achtung Baby\n\nWhen U2 reinvented themselves in the 90’s as ironic, electro-rock post-modernists they undertook what proved to be one of the most successful and complete transformations of a bands sound, look, and raison d’être in rock and roll history. And while the first glimpse of the new U2 2.0 was “The Fly”, it was “Mysterious Ways” that really cemented this new sound and image as a successful transformation. Built up from Larry Mullen’s funky, dance-inspired drum part and featuring The Edge’s huge, processed guitar riff as a hook “Mysterious Ways” was strange, exotic, and very modern feeling, while also still echoing the U2 of the past in its cinematic grandeur and in Bono’s passionate singing. It was enough to make the song a huge hit and allowed people to embrace the new U2, becoming one of their signature songs in the process.\n\n#14 – “Red Flag Day” – From the album Songs of Experience\n\nWhile in no way a truly bad album, U2’s fourteenth album Songs of Experience is the uneven and somewhat unfocused album that many accuse its sister album Songs of Innocence to be. There are some good tunes to be found on it though and my clear cut favorite is “Red Flag Day”. While obviously the work of a veteran band, “Red Flag Day” draws heavily on U2’s post-punk origins for its musical inspiration with its jagged guitars, staccato rhythms, and ghostly backing vocals and is the album’s clear highlight, largely because it isn’t trying to live up to the lofty expectations of being U2 but is simply drawing on the band’s past to create something visceral and interesting. Another mostly overlooked late-career near-classic track.\n\n#13 – “All I Want Is You” – From the album Rattle & Hum\n\nYes, the lyrics of “All I Want Is You” are somewhat clichéd and unoriginal. And yes, the symphonic backing seems somewhat old-fashioned and cheesy and goes on way, way too long at the end. Indeed, “All I Want Is You” is a song made up of overused and outdated musical motifs and lyrical sentiments and shouldn’t be any good. And yet, The Edge’s chiming guitar still draws me in, the symphonic scoring lends the song the cinematic sweep of classic cinema (after all, it was the music for the closing of Rattle & Hum which was a movie as well as an album), and Bono’s emotional plea and beautiful voice make the old words feel alive and new. I shouldn’t like “All I Want Is You” but I do. It is an amazing love song in the purest sense of that phrase and a classic song.\n\n#12 – “Until The End of the World” – From the album Achtung Baby\n\n“Until The End of the World” was a song that did not originally grab me when I first listened to Achtung Baby. I needed a few listens before the song began to sink in and grab me but eventually it did. The guitars feel like they cascade inward and create a claustrophobic feeling, like someone is trying to escape and quite can’t manage to do it. However, it was only after several listens, when the lyrics fell into place and I realized that “Until The End of the World” was in fact telling the story of the Last Supper and the betrayal by Judas Iscariot at the Garden of Gethsemane from the perspective of Judas that the song’s genius really came through. Then, the chaos and claustrophobic feel made sense and perfectly served the song. “Until The End of the World” is one of U2’s great unheralded songs and definitely a personal favorite.\n\n#11 – “Running To Stand Still” – From the album The Joshua Tree\n\n“Running To Stand Still” is a quiet and beautiful song that draws lightly on American musical influences like gospel and folk to create something timeless and lovely. “Running To Stand Still” is, I think, the kind of songs U2 were aiming to make when they originally envisioned the later Rattle & Hum project; songs that took U2’s blueprint and wove the Americana influences they respected and loved into them rather than the often bombastic homages that it came to be. Regardless of whether that is true or not “Running To Stand Still” is a spark of a song that briefly catches fire, burns bright, and then fades away. It is haunted, but much more powerful because of the sense of loss and lack of direction that pervades it.\n\n#10 – “Drowning Man” – From the album War\n\n“Drowning Man” may well be the most classically post-punk track U2 ever recorded. Musically it features wiry, sharp guitars, tribal percussion, pulsing bass, and atmospheric keys and/or synth-strings. Bono sings in a pained lament and the eerie near-falsetto backing vocals sound like they were borrowed from Siouxsie & The Banshees. It is a sound and style U2 never really explore deeply elsewhere except to some degree on the two preceding albums (with the exception of “An Cat Dubh”) and even there they rarely seem so committed to the form. Furthermore, because the rest of War is so different, so anthemic and big, it makes “The Drowning Man” stand out more. It is the sound of an alternate reality U2 that might have been. The irony of it all is that this darkly beautiful song could be a song about devotion to a lover, but it feels more like a Christian allegory about the saving love and mercy of Christ when one really listens closely.\n\n#9 – “Miss Sarajevo” – From the album Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1\n\nI debated whether or not to include “Miss Sarajevo” on this list as upon its release it was not credited to U2, but to a U2 side project known as Passengers. However, since over the years the band has increasingly treated the Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1 album, and the song “Miss Sarajevo” in particular, as part of the U2 discography I have as well. Besides, Passengers is just the four band members and their longtime friend, producer, and associate Brian Eno. The original purpose of Passengers was to allow the band and Eno to really indulge the experimental muse they had been having a dalliance with throughout the 90’s to its fullest extreme without having to carry the weight and expectations of the name U2. This proved to be both a blessing and a curse: A blessing because U2 and Eno were able to create something similar, but also very different, from their normal, more commercial work as U2; a curse because almost nobody ended up paying any attention to it. For most of the album, which is mostly atmospheric and moody near-instrumentals or dance/rock experimentation, this is not a big problem, but for the album’s most structured moment and clear highlight “Miss Sarajevo” this was sad as the song was just too good to be overlooked. A moody U2 ballad not too far removed from some of the quieter moments of both Achtung Baby and Zooropa, “Miss Sarajevo” sets itself apart in two ways. First, it deals with the mid-90’s culture clashes that were sweeping Europe after the falls of the communist east: Eastern Europe and Western Europe and their attendant cultures and ideologies, the religious and the secular, the decadent and the holy, Christianity and Islam, war and peace, the rich and the refugee, and so on. Second, the song departs from “normal” U2 balladry by including a solo from famed opera singer Luciano Pavarotti over its bridge, the inclusion of which is a masterstroke that elevates the song from very good to a haunting, unique, classic.\n\n#8 – “With Or Without You” – From the album The Joshua Tree\n\nU2 had been gaining momentum with the mainstream for some time but it was “With Or Without You” that really broke them into that mainstream, especially in America. A masterpiece of tension and atmosphere that speaks to the inherent conflict of loving someone who can’t or doesn’t love you back. “With Or Without You” simmers and smolders for a long time before finally giving full voice to its pain. It was such a big hit and is still such an omnipresent song that it can be difficult to hear it with fresh or new ears, but it still is a powerful and pained masterpiece for those who can.\n\n#7 – “If You Wear That Velvet Dress” – From the album Pop\n\nProbably not too many U2 fans would have this song even in their top half of Pop, let alone in their top 10 for the band, but I have always loved “If You Wear That Velvet Dress”. It’s so quiet and hushed that it has a built in intimacy that matches the feel of love, lust, sex and obsession that permeates the song. The bass slowly and softly thumps and The Edge’s guitar provides a shimmering texture that serves Bono’s lyrics perfectly. Indeed, the protagonist is so in awe of his lover, especially when she wears that certain dress, that could be happy just looking at her from afar; and even more amazed that he doesn’t have to. It’s subtle and beautiful and the type of small song that U2 rarely makes.\n\n#6 – “Moment Of Surrender” – From the album No Line On The Horizon\n\nIn my opinion No Line On The Horizon is a very good and underrated album. I also believe though that, like Zooropa, it works better as a whole album than it does in individual parts. The one major exception to that being “Moment of Surrender” which, in my opinion, is the best U2 song of the 21st century. Yes, better than “Walk On”, better than “Vertigo”, even better than “Beautiful Day” (which I have always thought was quite overrated and, you’ll notice, not on this list). “Moment of Surrender” is almost a hymn or a mantra, and it feels like one built up from an organ drone and a circular and repetitive drum part. “Moment of Surrender” is, in turns, both sexy and sacred and an excellent showcase both for Bono’s still great voice and some superb backing vocals by the band that lend the song an almost gospel-tinged feel. Admittedly, I like when U2 adds a touch of darkness to their cinematic sweep and defiant optimism, and this song smolders like a ember, burning long and slow and hot.\n\n#5 – “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” – From the album The Joshua Tree\n\nA song about searching and the beauty of the journey, rather than the destination, “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” sounds and feels like one of those songs that have always existed. Even though it was written by U2 in the late 1980’s it feels timeless. One can imagine it being sung by slaves in the American south while they worked the fields pre-American Civil War, or by the Pilgrims in a New England church, or by a blind beggar singing for coins to eat, or by a Harlem gospel choir (as U2 did with the version on Rattle & Hum), or by pioneers pushing west, or refugees looking for a better life, or mourners at a funeral, and on and on. “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” could be a Christian parable, an agnostic’s journey, or a wanderer’s motto. It is a song that feels like it has always been there and that has near universal meaning. That is quite a feat.\n\n#4 – “One” – From the album Achtung Baby\n\nI read somewhere once that Achtung Baby is a treatise on the many varieties of love. If that is so, and I personally believe that it is, the “One” is about the love that endures in a committed relationship. “One is about the love that has survived the hard times, endured the years, overcome the obstacles, and is stronger and fiercer because of the fact that two people have chosen to love each other rather than allow the world and its circumstances to pull them apart. “One” is one of Bono’s best vocals and it has always felt so personal to me, like he is singing to and for his wife Ali, who he has been married to since just after high school. Whether that is true or not that message of a bond created over time through service, work, love, mistakes and forgiveness, is one that speaks to me and “One” is yet another classic U2 slow song.\n\n#3 – “Love Is Blindness” – From the album Achtung Baby\n\nIf Achtung Baby is a collection of songs about the many varieties of love then “Love Is Blindness” is an ode to love’s darkest form: Love for a cause. Darkly radiant and eerie, “Love Is Blindness” seems to be about loving an ideal so much that one is willing to die for it, such as terrorism. With lyrics like “In a parked car/In a crowded street/You see your love made complete/Thread is ripping/The knot is slipping/Love is blindness” and “Love is clockworks and cold steel/Fingers too numb to feel/Squeeze the handle/Blow out the candle/Love is blindness” leave little to the imagination. However, Bono’s lyrics also show both the allure and the sickness of this kind of love when he sings it is “A dangerous idea/That almost makes sense”. For me “Love Is Blindness” has always been a master work of meaningful lyrics, emotional depth, and musical atmosphere all working to create something powerful and disturbing.\n\n#2 – “The Fly” – From the album Achtung Baby\n\nU2 introduced the new, ironic, Eurocentric, nasty, U2 version 2.0 when they released “The Fly” as the lead single ahead of the release of Achtung Baby. Without the context of the album I think most people thought “The Fly” was just a strange detour, and while they were eventually proven wrong it was a shock that most people were either not ready for or simply didn’t like (at least at first). I was not one of those people. From the first time I heard “The Fly”, when MTV world premiered the song and video, I was hooked. I loved the distorted, fuzzy guitars, the fast, danceable tempo, the junk culture lyrics and falsetto vocal hook, all of it; and it has never gotten old for me. “The Fly” is still a personal favorite and easily my favorite fast and rocking song by U2.\n\n#1 – “Bad” – From the album The Unforgettable Fire\n\nFor a band that is so well-known for so many classic songs, U2 often makes their best albums as albums. I have already mentioned that I think both Zooropa and No Line On The Horizon work far better as albums than as song collections; I feel similarly about The Unforgettable Fire. The Unforgettable Fire is a great listen and it has great individual moments like “Pride” and the title track, but overall it works much better together than apart. For that reason I only have one song from The Unforgettable Fire on this list, but that song – “Bad” – my #1 song by U2. Chiming, textured guitars, masterful and subtle work by the rhythm section, and meaning lyrics sung perfectly by Bono create a near-perfect moment that captures the sound and vision of 80’s U2 perfectly. “Bad” is anthemic, cinematic and sweeping, yet it also feels personal and impassioned and pained, and by the time it crescendo of “-tions” – “This desperation/Dislocation/Separation/Condemnation/Revelation/In temptation/Isolation/Desolation/Let it go…” it can still make me feel powerful emotion after all these years and listens."
