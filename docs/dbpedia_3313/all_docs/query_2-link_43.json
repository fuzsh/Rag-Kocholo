        "text": "What’s next for the band that’s done it all? The answer for U2, a relic of an era when the designation of ‘Biggest Rock Band in the World’ still meant something, was to go to Las Vegas. Yet the relentlessly ambitious Irishmen were determined not to traverse the stereotypical late-career path of a traditional Sin City residency.\n\nInstead, they silenced the skeptics and signed on as the opening act for Sphere, an eye-popping new $2.2 billion, 366-foot-tall, 516-foot-wide purpose built venue that has dramatically reshaped the Las Vegas skyline and upended the live music business.\n\nIt’s been 13 years since I last chatted with Bono. My most vivid memory of speaking to him, standing in the bowels of a Roman stadium hours before he took the stage for yet another mammoth show with U2, was how openly eager he was to remain relevant.\n\n\"We're experimenting to discover different sides to us,\" he told me that night. \"And I think we're at one of those moments. We're fighting for relevance. Being successful is a lot easier than being relevant. We may be about to do our best-ever album or we may be about to be irrelevant.\"\n\nBono was feeling his mortality back then. It was 2010; several months earlier, a slipped disc in his back punctured a ligament and broke into pieces. After hobbling around for days, he realized he needed emergency surgery.\n\n“It turns out I was in grave danger,\" he said. \"Those little bits that had broken off were starting to sever nerves in my spinal canal. I was losing the ability to walk.\"\n\nHe eventually shrugged it all off, of course. Rehabbed. Got match fit again. Hopped on the stadium rock carnival once more and by the time we spoke, he’d been traversing Europe’s soccer stadium circuit again for months.\n\nA few days after the show in Italy, Bono called my house at midnight on a Saturday from his home on Killiney Bay, near Dublin, and we chatted for more than an hour.\n\n\"The biggest challenge now will be getting a song on the radio,” Bono told me. “That's our drug of choice now. I don't know if we will achieve it. It takes a radio programmer saying, 'I want that feeling on my station.' And they may not. It will be very hard for U2 to dominate the radio now... But we're going to try.\"\n\nNo matter how many highs they reached, something continued to nag at the Irish quartet: the unquenchable desire for relevance.\n\nRolling Stone senior editor Andy Greene says this energy is what helped ensure the band overcame the many obstacles it encountered to get to the Sphere residency in Vegas earlier this year.\n\n\"They always think of how to scale things up,\" he says, \"how to surprise the fans and how to continue to be the biggest band in the world. When Sphere was looking for a new band, there's no group that was a more natural fit. They spent a lot of time thinking about what was possible. And then with COVID, there was suddenly a lot of uncertainty around when this could even happen.\"\n\nU2 had been here before, of course. The group spent a significant portion of their career openly striving to be The Biggest Band In The World —a title they held for much of the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThere were endless tours and iconic albums filled with seminal songs like “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” “With or Without You,” “Where The Streets Have No Name,” and “One” that sold tens of millions of copies.\n\nThe band fell out of favor with the wider public with 1997’s obtuse “Pop” album, but they bounced back bigger than ever in 2000 with the “Beautiful Day” single. A true era-defining hit that came just as they entered their forties, it catapulted them back to the top of MTV and pop radio rotations alongside Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. Another smash hit, “Vertigo”, followed a few years later.\n\n“It was kind of a miracle,” Rolling Stone's Greene says of the band’s last great radio and record sales run.\n\nBy 2010, the music world had changed a lot. And a hit single ultimately eluded U2 in the streaming era.\n\n“It's just a different world than it used to be,” Greene said. “I think they didn't accept that for a long time.”\n\nA move to automatically add U2’s 2014 album “Songs of Innocence” to every Apple iTunes account fomented a massive customer backlash and eventually forced something of a public retreat from the band.\n\n“There's something uncool about ambition and rock bands,” Greene says. “They got crushed for the Apple thing and I think it wounded them… But they also (ultimately) accepted that they're not gonna get songs on the radio like ‘Beautiful Day’ again.”\n\nIt leaves them once more in a conundrum: What does U2, the band that basically invented the modern stadium rock show experience as we know it, do in 2023?\n\nIn the end, they decamped to the Sphere. Madison Square Garden impresario James Dolan began noodling on the concept of a “spherical IMAX theater on steroids” in 2015, seeking a bespoke, cavernous arena with boundary-pushing audio and visual technology.\n\nU2 was deemed an ideal fit to usher in live music’s next phase via an immersive audio and visual experience anchored by colossal 16K resolution screens.\n\nThe timing was auspicious, as it coincided with the rise of a post-pandemic consumer mindset that values spending voraciously on premium, unique experiences. Fans are now more willing than ever to empty their wallets and travel vast distances to see their favorite acts, a trend that has upended the live music business in recent years.\n\nBy the time I flew to Las Vegas in October to take in a U2 show at this eye-popping new Sphere venue, the buzz was beginning to grow.\n\nThe band’s most recent studio output is telling. Its last recording project, a quickly forgotten acoustic album, was recorded seemingly to ensure injured drummer Larry Mullen Jr. did not have to exert himself while recovering from surgery to his elbows and knees. (Mullen was too sore to play in Vegas and the band ended up using Dutch percussionist Bram van den Berg as a replacement drummer for the shows).\n\n“Atomic City”, a perfunctory new single the band recorded this year to mark the Sphere shows, felt like an old-fashioned U2 banger, but the world mostly shrugged. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny likely gets more streams in an hour on Spotify than “Atomic City” averaged over its first week.\n\nU2’s last great tour — a celebration of the 30th anniversary of its seminal \"Joshua Tree\" album — was unapologetically grounded in nostalgia anyway. So, how best to embrace that and still look forward?\n\nRolling Stone’s Greene, who Zoomed regularly with U2’s band members in the lead up to the Sphere shows, said this is something the band wrestled with in preparing for the 40-night run.\n\n“They worked really hard on it for years,” he says. “They always think of how to scale things up. There's no bigger venues than stadiums, but they've sold all the big ones out — even on tours for the albums that didn't sell well. So the next step was to (embrace) technology.”\n\nEntering the Sphere as a concertgoer, what strikes you is the clean lines, the minimalist design and the diminutive size of the record player-shaped stage.\n\nU2 most definitely did not go overboard on visuals with this production. In fact, as the show progresses, the visuals become even more modest as the interplay between the band and Bono’s performance become the show’s most potent force.\n\nOn the night I attended in October, 18,600 people fans walked out exultant after a two-and-a-half hour set that included the “Achtung Baby” album played in its entirety and a mini trove of most of the band’s biggest singles.\n\nA few weeks later, the band announced they would extend their Sphere residency for two more months. The last show is scheduled for March 2. I asked Greene if he thought the band’s Vegas run would end as currently scheduled.\n\n“My gut tells me this is it,” he says. “They don't want to be known as a Vegas act. They don't want to be Celine Dion and camp out there year after year. As much as Vegas has changed in huge ways in the past 20 years, there's still a stigma.\n\n“The money for them to stay there (and keep playing) is psychotic, but it's sort of quicksand…. They always want to look ahead, but the lure of nostalgia is so strong. The more years that go by, the more you’re dragging behind your past.”"
