        "text": "I'm actually a pretty big fan of U2 and I think they're amazing songwriters/musicians... On that same token nobody can be be credited for killing rock more than them IMO. They're the first band in history that is considered a rock band yet they don't really play rock music in a traditional sense...\n\nPretty much every indie \"rock band\" you hear after the post-grunge of the late 00's is a branch off the U2 tree sound-wise...\n\nI know it's a hot take but let's hear what you guys think...\n\n“Killed” might be too strong a word here. I prefer “caused an inflection point”. As a kid, I remember hearing Black Sabbath for the first time in 1970, on a jukebox at the YMCA. I had never heard a sound like that before. It sure wasn’t 60s music. It was new and unique, and to me, looking back, represented the birth of metal. Some time later in the late 70s, I remember hearing the Sex Pistols - God Save the Queen for the first time. I had asked my mom to get me an advance copy when she was in London, before it was released n the US, I found their sounds new and unique. For me, this represented the birth of new wave/punk. Earlier, the Beatles and Jimi changed things too. All of these for me have been inflection points - Places in time where a new sound is created, where the body of musical sound becomes enriched and widened. I consider myself fortunate to have experienced these broadening forces. 50s Rockabilly was great, but it nice to have more options today because of inflection points.\n\nWhat killed rock (your version of it specifically) was all the corporate widdlydiddly spandex and hairspray stuff. But fear not, Nirvana and RATM rocked, too.\n\nI don’t think that U2 sits atop the indie family tree. Not alone, at least. There’s plenty of 80s bands that would be up there with U2. REM for example.\n\nJoshua Tree is one of the greatest 80s albums, though. Believe it or not I never heard it in its entirety until a couple years ago. I’d only heard a couple of the singles.\n\nJust my opinion, but I beg to differ. Sorry to pull some provincial rank, but as the LA Basin's radio stations went, so did the world. In the 1980s 105.5 KNAC and 106.7 KROQ had an incredible amount of clout in classifying music. KROQ was all things indie including goth, and KNAC was all things rock with nothing else (at least not until Alice in Chains took a jackhammer to The Strip and ears turned to Seattle). U2 never saw KNAC airplay. As far as us hessians were concerned, U2 was just a bad imitation of rock and not worthy of our ears. I don't see them having much lineage nor much relevance when it comes to the development of glam nor thrash, and likewise very little to do with their demise. Glam and thrash both overextended and ran their course. At some point you're going to have an organic reversion to lyrics that matter, and simpler riffs that just sound tasty which the PNW was willing to provide in many forms.\n\nI read this thread to see where it may go and why the finger is pointed at U2. After doing so, I say pointing at U2 as the death of rock seems very random and very arguably a moot point as IMO, rock is far from dead.\n\nMusical styles, like most popular things (fashion, cars, etc.), are IME, cyclic. They come and go.\n\nHead bangin' may have suffered a bit, but I also see that cycle returning to a high point with Gen Z and now aging Gen Xers."
