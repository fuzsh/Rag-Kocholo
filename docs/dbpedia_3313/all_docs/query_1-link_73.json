        "text": "Green light, Seven Eleven\n\nYou stop in for a pack of cigarettes\n\nYou don′t smoke, don't even want to\n\nHey, now, check your change\n\nDressed up like a car crash\n\nYour wheels are turnin′ but you're upside down\n\nYou say when he hits you you don't mind\n\nBecause when he hurts you you feel alive\n\nOh, no, is that what it is?\n\nRed lights, grey morning\n\nYou stumble out of a hole in the ground\n\nA vampire or a victim\n\nIt depends on who′s around\n\nYou used to stay in to watch the adverts\n\nYou could lip-sync to the talk shows\n\nAnd if you look, you look through me\n\nAnd when you talk, you talk at me\n\nAnd when I touch you, you don′t feel a thing\n\nIf I could stay then the night would give you up\n\nStay, and the day would keep its trust\n\nStay, and the night would be enough\n\nFaraway, so close\n\nUp with the static and the radio\n\nWith satellite television\n\nYou can go anywhere\n\nMiami, New Orleans\n\nLondon, Belfast and Berlin\n\nAnd if you listen, I can't call\n\nAnd if you jump, you just might fall\n\nAnd if you shout, I′ll only hear you\n\nIf I could stay, then the night would give you up\n\nStay, then the day would keep its trust\n\nStay with the demons you drowned\n\nStay with the spirit I found\n\nStay, and the night would be enough\n\nOh-oh-oh, ooh\n\nOh-oh-oh, ooh\n\nOh-oh-oh, ooh\n\nOh-oh-oh, ooh\n\nThree o'clock in the morning\n\nIt′s quiet, there's no one around\n\nJust the bang and the clatter\n\nAs an angel runs to ground\n\nJust the bang and the clatter\n\nAs an angel hits the ground\n\nWriter(s): Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen, Dave Evans, Paul David Hewson<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
