        "text": "U2 are an Irish rock band founded in Dublin in 1976. The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitars), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). U2 was formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School, when a 14-year old Mullen Jr. posted a note on the school's notice board looking for musicians for a new band. Though they had limited musical proficiency, punk's popularity convinced them that it was no barrier to success. Within four years, U2 signed with Island Records and released their debut album, Boy (1980).\n\nU2's third album, War, became their first number-one album in the United Kingdom. It's songs helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group, particularly the singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\". Their fifth album, The Joshua Tree (1987), catapulted them to international stardom, and remains their greatest commercial success to date. It also produced the hit singles \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", \"With or Without You\", and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\"; the latter two are currently U2's only number-one US singles.\n\nStruggling with creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary/double album Rattle and Hum (1988), U2 reinvented their sound with their seventh album Achtung Baby (1991) and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, Pop (1997), and the PopMart Tour; both proved to be mixed successes. In 2000s, U2 regained commercial favor with All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), the former also spawning the successful single \"Stuck In a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\". Their 2009–2011 U2 360° Tour of was the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour at the time. U2 most recently released the companion albums Songs of Innocence (2014) and Songs of Experience (2017). In 2021, the group recorded and released the single \"Your Song Saved My Life\" for the film Sing 2, while Bono voiced Clay Calloway."
