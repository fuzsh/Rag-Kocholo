Those bands surely fit into small, neat little genres.\n\nsandorski\n\nNo Lifer\n\nOct 10, 1999\n\n70,174\n\n5,697\n\n126\n\nMar 2, 2003\n\n#21\n\nU2 is basically Rock, but it's mostly Original.\n\nTheir history is quite entertaining in itself, they were a band before they could sing or play instruments. They thought it would be cool to be a Rock band so they made one! How shizzled is that?\n\nU2 is certainly one of, if not the, the best bands in the last 20+ years. I love them, also love Tom Petty(and the Heart Breakers), REM, Tragically Hip, and other Original types.\n\nSherEPunjab\n\nDiamond Member\n\nOct 23, 2002\n\n3,841\n\n0\n\n0\n\nMar 2, 2003\n\n#22\n\nthank god for these posts. the other thread of what bands suck or whatever was getting me sick. U2 bashers. idiots. U2 ownz all.\n\nU2 IS the best band in the past 20 years, for sure. they're probably the best band ever, but i'm not familiar with music before 20 years ago.\n\ni would consider U2 a blend between rock and alt.\n\nPop sucked, but most other stuff was awesome. Joshua Tree was the best album ever in history.\n\ngodmare\n\nDiamond Member\n\nSep 25, 2002\n\n5,121\n\n0\n\n0\n\nMar 2, 2003\n\n#23\n\nMan, that's hard.. no one really sounds like U2, they're very distinctive. they've got loads of music to keep you busy, though\n\nI know, check out David Bowie (His new one-heathen is good, grows on you ) and maybe Sting?"
