        "text": "From their songs to their vision to their constant evolution, U2 have earned their place as one of the most popular and innovative rock bands of all time — and they have an astounding 22 GRAMMYs to show for it.\n\nWith their earthy, tactile first three albums, 1980's Boy, 1981's October, and 1983's War, the band positioned themselves at the vanguard of post-punk. Summarily, they hurtled past its parameters with a little help from producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, culminating in their 1987 masterpiece The Joshua Tree.\n\nAfter ripping up the rulebook with 1991's deconstructionist Achtung Baby, U2 spent the rest of the decade throwing electro-tinged curveball after curveball with Pop and Zooropa. The band then settled into something of an elder-statesmen role with 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind and its consolidative, substantive follow-ups.\n\nToday, U2 remain intact without a single lineup change — save drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. having to sit out a Vegas residency due to recovery from surgery. Partly as a tribute to their astonishing longevity, U2 released the Songs of Surrender — the third in their Songs of… series — on Mar. 17.\n\nPart retrospective, part reimagining, Songs of Surrender culls 40 songs from their past — including some of their biggest hits, like \"One,\" \"Pride (In the Name of Love\" and \"With or Without You\" — and renders them in soft-focus minimalism.\n\nAccompanied by a memoir by Bono, Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story, the album acts as a panorama of U2's singular landscape — the spiritual searches, the self-conscious reinventions, the sociopolitical grandstanding, the triumphs and travails.\n\nWith the band back in the ether, here are some answers to common questions about Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr.\n\nWhat Does U2 Stand For?\n\nWhile the band shares a name with an American spy plane, the exact origin of the name is unclear. What's established, however, is that they were previously known as Feedback — one of the only musical terms they knew — and the Hype before settling on the name.\n\nIn a BBC interview, Bono and the Edge explained that a friend curated a list of names for them, and they chose U2 because they hated it the least. Bono remarked that the name gave off \"futuristic\" images of \"the spy plane\" and \"the U-boat.\" (The name still makes him \"cringe.\")\n\nWhat Is U2's Latest Album?\n\nAfter Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, U2 have released Songs of Surrender, which shrinks down the often grandiose arrangements of their past work and examines them with a new lens. Produced by the Edge, the album is spread across four discs, each named after a band member.\n\n\"I just need to be more silent, and to surrender to my band as being at the core of what I'm trying to do with my life, surrender to my wife,\" Bono recently told NPR. \"And when I say 'surrender,' I do not mean making peace with the world... I'm trying to make peace with myself, I'm trying to make peace with my maker, but I am not trying to make peace with the world.\n\n\"The world is a deeply unfair place, and I'm ready to rumble,\" he continued. \"I'm keeping my fists up for that one.\"\n\nWhat Is U2's Latest Book?\n\nBono has characterized the operating principle behind Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story as such: \"I was hoping to draw in detail what I'd previously only sketched in songs. The people, places, and possibilities in my life.\"\n\nOrganized around the 40 selections in its attendant album with plenty of off-ramps and asides, Surrender illuminates hidden corners of Bono's history, faith and psyche like never before.\n\nWhy Is Bono Called Bono?\n\nBorn Paul David Hewson, Bono was nicknamed Bono Vox as a teen in Dublin, when he and his friends were part of a surrealist street gang named Lypton Village.\n\nAs they were all assigned nicknames, Hewson assumed the moniker Bono Vox — the name of a hearing-aid store near where they grew up, which itself came from the Latin word Bonavox, which means \"good voice.\"\n\nAre U2 Touring In 2023?\n\nCome fall 2023, U2 will return to the stage after a four-year absence for a Las Vegas residency focusing on their classic Achtung Baby album.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Mullen won't be part of the proceedings, though the band looks forward to his return.\n\n\"No one is more disappointed than us that Larry won't be joining us in Vegas,\" the Edge told The Telegraph, adding: \"In the history of U2, you can count the shows we've missed on the fingers of one hand.\"\n\nWhat Was U2's Biggest Hit?\n\nFrom a Billboard Hot 100 standpoint, the U2 song that's made the biggest commercial splash is \"With or Without You,\" that skyscraping, eros-meets-agape wonder from The Joshua Tree. (That song stayed at No. 1 for three weeks; \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" remained in the same position for two.)\n\nAnd when you listen to the hushed, humbled rendition of \"With or Without You\" just released on their new album, you hear not only how their artistic achievements have resonated through the decades.\n\nInstead hear the four men not as rock titans, but as human beings — searching, striving, and ultimately surrendering.\n\nLiving Legends: Van Morrison On New Album Moving On Skiffle, Communing With His Roots & Reconnecting With Audiences\n\nMary J. Blige’s tireless work ethic, extraordinary singing talent and soul-level relatability are the secret ingredients to her longevity as a recording artist. Her discography includes nine GRAMMY wins and 37 nominations, and the multi-hyphenate artist continues to demonstrate that there's no limit to her creativity.\n\nBlige is nominated for six awards at the 2023 GRAMMYs, including Album Of The Year and Best R&B Album for Good Morning Gorgeous (Deluxe). The title track is nominated in three categories: Record Of The Year, Best Traditional R&B Performance and Best R&B Song, and \"Here With Me\" is up for Best R&B Performance.\n\nGood Morning Gorgeous encapsulates the true self-love Blige felt after healing from divorce, abusive relationships and depression. As she explains on an album interlude \"good morning gorgeous\" is the affirmation Blige now says to herself in the mornings — and, for the first time, she believes it. And when it comes to the odds of adding to her GRAMMY wins on Feb. 5, it’s safe to wager that Blige thinks they’re sound.\n\n\"Bet on me, why not?\" Blige sings in the chorus of the album’s \"On Top.\" \"Don’t act like I never left on top.\"\n\nFor her resonant musical messages, Blige has been crowned the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. But she’s also an industry professional who deftly sets and iterates on trends, keeping even her earliest releases relevant and exciting.\n\nBlige became a record label boss when she released Good Morning Gorgeous as a joint venture between Lyor Cohen’s 300 Entertainment and her own Mary Jane Productions. She’s a frequent executive producer of her albums and multimedia projects and is set to executive produce two fictional films for Lifetime in 2023 through her production company Blue Butterfly. Real Love and Strength of a Woman are both named for her songs. Real Love is described as a romantic drama set in an upstate New York college.\n\nContrary to the music industry’s sophomore slump stereotype, Blige’s second album is a seminal work. 1994's My Life became career-defining, and an album that she has subsequently reflected on to show her growth.\n\nThe album is a reflection of her volatile relationship with singer Cedric \"K-Ci\" Hailey, Blige explained in Mary J. Blige’s My Life, a documentary she executive produced for Amazon Studios in honor of the album’s 25th anniversary. Throughout, Blige keenly pairs heights of happiness with depths of her despair on songs like \"You Bring Me Joy,\" \"I’m Goin’ Down,\" \"I Love You\" and \"Be Happy.\"\n\n\"The whole 'My Life' album is, 'Please love me, don’t go, I need you,'\" she said in the documentary. Combs, then known as Puffy, continued: \"When she made that album, she was fighting for her heart.\" (Combs and Harrell served as executive producers of My Life.)\n\nBlige and Combs never collaborated quite so closely again, though they remained friends. Combs didn’t produce 2011’s My Life II… The Journey Continues (Act 1), but he appears in a telephone skit to open the album, similarly to how he did on My Life. The sequel features guest stars such as Nas, Beyoncé and Drake.\n\nThough her earlier works hinted at the potential, My Life most firmly established Blige as a beacon for hurt hearts everywhere. In a 2021 interview with Trevor Noah, Blige described how childhood physical and mental abuse, as well as her relationship with Hailey, led to substance abuse and depression. When she used the songs on My Life as a way of saying she needed help, \"four million people responded and said, ‘'We need help, too.'\"\n\nCovers, Collaborations And Remixes\n\nCover songs have been an acclaimed — and long-lasting — part of Blige’s career ever since she sang \"Sweet Thing\" by Rufus featuring Chaka Khan on What’s The 411? Blige released her hugely popular version of Rose Royce’s \"I’m Goin’ Down\" in 1994, which reached No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100, and she beat Beyoncé to the punch in 2000 with her take on Maze’s \"Before I Let Go.\"\n\nBut her ascension to rock star status has a lot to do with her scene-stealing covers of songs of stadium-level acts. Blige has delivered epic versions of songs by Led Zeppelin (\"Stairway To Heaven\") and Sting (\"Whenever I Say Your Name\"), and when she collaborated with U2 on a new version of \"One,\" there’s an audible battle with Bono as to whose song this is now.\n\nBlige collaborates with rap, R&B, rock, country, electronic and classical artists with equal ease, and her discography includes work with late legends, including \"Holdin’ On\" with Aretha Franklin and a cover of Stevie Wonder’s \"As\" with George Michael. She won her first career GRAMMY in 1995 for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for \"I'll Be There For You / You're All I Need To Get By,\" a collaboration with Method Man that covers Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.\n\nA dance music collaboration with London duo Disclosure called \"F for You\" in 2013 helped to catalyze an entire album from the Capital of England called The London Sessions. The 2014 album features a second collaboration with Disclosure (\"Right Now\"), a cameo from UK garage DJ/producer MJ Cole (\"Nobody But You\") and guest vocals from Scottish singer Emeli Sandé (\"Whole Damn Year\").\n\nBlige has long understood the potency of both hip-hop and dance music remixes, which remain a part of her single roll-outs. Over the years, she created a remix album of songs from What’s The 411?, and in 2002 released club-focused reworks of songs from No More Drama, Mary and Share My World on Dance For Me.\n\nBlige's remixes also pay homage. On her cover of First Choice’s \"Let No Man Put Asunder,\" Blige honors singers who came before by featuring guest vocals from the group's lead singer, Rochelle Fleming.\n\nHer Rap Alter Ego\n\nMusic's Biggest Night, the 54th Annual GRAMMY Awards, will air live from Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday, Feb. 12 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the telecast, we will take a stroll down music memory lane with GRAMMY Rewind, highlighting the \"big four\" categories — Album Of The Year, Record Of The Year, Song Of The Year, and Best New Artist — from past awards shows. In the process, we'll examine the winners and the nominees who just missed taking home a GRAMMY, while also shining a light on the artists' careers and the eras in which the recordings were born.\n\nJoin us as we take an abbreviated journey through the trajectory of pop music from the 1st Annual GRAMMY Awards in 1959 to last year's 53rd Annual GRAMMY Awards.\n\n48th Annual GRAMMY Awards\n\nFeb. 8, 2006\n\nAlbum Of The Year\n\nWinner: U2, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\n\nMariah Carey, The Emancipation Of Mimi\n\nPaul McCartney, Chaos And Creation In The Backyard\n\nGwen Stefani, *Love. Angel. Music. Baby.*\n\nKanye West, Late Registration\n\nAfter trumping Michael Jackson's Bad for the Album Of The Year trophy in 1987, U2 cleared yet another hurdle by beating out one-fourth of the Beatles, 2012 MusiCares Person of the Year honoree Sir Paul McCartney [http://www.grammy.com/news/paul-mccartney-to-perform-at-2012-musicares-person-of-the-year-gala\\]. How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, said to be the group's return to the big-anthem classics produced in the '80s, charted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and garnered seven additional GRAMMYs in 2004 and 2005, including Best Rock Song for \"City Of Blinding Lights\" and \"Vertigo.\" Also making a comeback of sorts was Carey, whose 10th studio release, The Emancipation Of Mimi, won her three GRAMMY Awards, including Best R&B Song for the No. 1 hit \"We Belong Together.\" In 1990 Carey won her first two GRAMMYs, including Best New Artist. For Chaos And Creation In The Backyard, produced by GRAMMY winner Nigel Godrich, McCartney returned to the one-man band style exhibited on his self-titled solo debut, playing nearly every instrument on the album from guitars and keyboards to bass and drums. Stefani earned a nomination for her solo debut effort, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. The album spawned four additional nods and featured her first No. 1 single as a solo artist, the infectious \"Hollaback Girl.\" West's sophomore release, Late Registration, marked his second Album Of The Year nod (he also received recognition for production work on Carey's The Emancipation …). The album topped the Billboard 200 in 2005 and featured the No. 1 hit \"Gold Digger.\"\n\nnode: video: U2 Win Album Of The Year\n\nRecord Of The Year\n\nWinner: Green Day, \"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\"\n\nMariah Carey, \"We Belong Together\"\n\nGorillaz Featuring De La Soul, \"Feel Good Inc.\"\n\nGwen Stefani, \"Hollaback Girl\"\n\nKanye West, \"Gold Digger\"\n\nRock reigned supreme in the Record Of The Year category as Green Day won for their hit \"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams.\" The track appears on American Idiot, which won the group a GRAMMY for Best Rock Album the year prior and gained them presence on Broadway when it was later made into a musical in 2009. Carey's \"We Belong Together\" skyrocketed to the top of several pop charts in 2005 and earned her two GRAMMY wins, including Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. Adding variety to the field was virtual hip-hop group Gorillaz with the viral \"Feel Good Inc.\" featuring De La Soul. The track earned them a GRAMMY for Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals and a virtual duet with Madonna on the GRAMMY telecast. Stefani's \"Hollaback Girl\" scored a nomination with the help of GRAMMY-winning producers the Neptunes. West's \"Gold Digger,\" which features Jamie Foxx sampling pieces from Ray Charles' \"I Got A Woman,\" garnered the 14-time GRAMMY winner a win for Best Rap Solo Performance.\n\nnode: video: Green Day Win Record Of The Year\n\nSong Of The Year\n\nWinner: U2, \"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\"\n\nMariah Carey, \"We Belong Together\"\n\nJohn Legend, \"Ordinary People\"\n\nRascal Flatts, \"Bless The Broken Road\"\n\nBruce Springsteen, \"Devils & Dust\"\n\nThe second Song Of The Year win for U2, the emotional \"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own,\" was written by Bono and U2, and also garnered the self-proclaimed best band in the world a GRAMMY for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal that year, beating out Coldplay, Foo Fighters, Franz Ferdinand, and the Killers. Carey's third nomination in the General Field was co-written with an all-star cast that included Johnta Austin, Babyface and Jermaine Dupri. Making his GRAMMY debut this year was Legend, who co-wrote \"Ordinary People\" with Black Eyed Pea will.i.am. The singer/pianist's debut studio album, Get Lifted, won a GRAMMY for Best R&B Vocal Album, a trophy that was replaced [link to: http://www.grammy.com/news/legend-gets-a-do-over\\] in 2010 by The Recording Academy after an incident involving Legend's nephew. One of the first country groups in recent memory to receive a Song Of The Year nomination was Rascal Flatts' \"Bless The Broken Road,\" written by Bobby Boyd, Jeff Hanna and Marcus Hummon. The track, previously recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, won for Best Country Song. The final entry, Springsteen's self-penned \"Devils & Dust,\" which appears on the No. 1 album of the same name, earned the Boss five GRAMMY nominations this year, including a win for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.\n\nnode: video: \"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\" Wins Song Of The Year\n\nBest New Artist\n\nWinner: John Legend\n\nCiara\n\nFall Out Boy\n\nKeane\n\nSugarland\n\nNeo-soul artist Legend, who made two big debuts in 2005 with his first studio album and first appearance at the GRAMMY Awards, picked up Best New Artist honors. Get Lifted also broke the Top 5 on the Billboard 200. Texas-native Ciara, named the \"First Lady of Crunk and B\" by producer Lil Jon, scored a nod. She also took home a Best Short Form Music Video GRAMMY for \"Lose Control.\" Pop/punk outfit Fall Out Boy received their only GRAMMY nomination to date. The group's 2005 album, From Under The Cork Tree, peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard 200. Piano-driven pop/rock group Keane added more variety to the diverse field, and picked up a second nomination the following year for \"Is It Any Wonder?\" The second country act to garner a nod in the General Field was the then-trio Sugarland, featuring Kristian Bush, Kristen Hall and Jennifer Nettles. The group won a GRAMMY two years later for Best Country Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal — minus Hall —for the tear-jerker \"Stay.\"\n\nnode: video: Carrie Underwood Wins Best New Artist\n\nCome back to GRAMMY.com tomorrow as we revisit the 49th Annual GRAMMY Awards.\n\nFollow GRAMMY.com for our inside look at GRAMMY news, blogs, photos, videos, and of course nominees.
