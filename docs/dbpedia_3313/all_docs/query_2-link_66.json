We get to carry each other.\"\n\nA ctress Julia Roberts attended the event wearing a custom-made dress adorned with photos of George Clooney.\n\nSpeaking at the formal presentation of the awards at the US State Department, Dave Evans, otherwise known as The Edge, said U2 were incredibly grateful and proud to receive the honour named after former president John F Kennedy.\n\nM r Evans noted U2 played their very first US concert 42 years ago on 6 December 1980.\n\n\" We had big dreams and like so many people in Ireland, America was the focus of those dreams,\" he said.\n\n\"There is such a close bond between U2 and this country, and we can't fully explain it but since that very first gig, we've always felt warmth and love, but this tonight goes way above and beyond.\"\n\nMade up of Bono, Adam Clayton, The Edge and Larry Mullen Jr, U2 formed in Dublin in 1976.\n\nThroughout their career, the band have won 22 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year for The Joshua Tree in 1988.\n\nIn 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen."
