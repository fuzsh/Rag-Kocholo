It´s just the very first second of each line, and maybe not even that much, and the feeling of \"deja vu\" quickly fades as soon as Bono continues his lines. So, apart from the very first second(s), the following lines don´t bear a tonic resemblance at all.\n\nA much more obvious influence is that old U2 song where Prince seemed to have borrowed a bit for his song \"Guitar\" . Check out U2´s \" I will follow\" video on youtube and you will see what I mean. THAT sound much more like a rip off.\n\nAnother example would be Marc Bolan´s or T-Rex´s song that sounds heavily like Prince´s song \"Cream\"...don´t remember the title, something like Bang Sha Bong or whatever....other orgers probably could give you the title of that song.\n\nAnd I´m still trying to figure out whether Prince ripped off of Laid Back´s \"White Horse\" when he wrote \"Erotic City\", or whether Laid Back had already heard \"Erotic City\" first ( as a promo release ?) and then wrote \"White Horse\". I heard that there is a very rare maxisingle with Prince on the A-side and Laid Back on the B-side,and I know that they had briefly met in the early 80s and hung out a bit but other than that, I can only speculate.\n\n\" I´d rather be a stank ass hoe because I´m not stupid. Oh my goodness! I got more drugs! I´m always funny dude...I´m hilarious! Are we gonna smoke?\"\n\nwasitgood4u\n\nKoolEaze said:\n\nI see what you mean though it did take me a bit of time to feel what you feel.
