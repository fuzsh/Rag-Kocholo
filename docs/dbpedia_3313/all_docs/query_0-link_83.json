        "text": "U2 brought their Sphere residency in Las Vegas to a close over the weekend. As expected, the total amount of money brought in by the legendary band is mind-blowing.\n\nPer Ultimate Classic Rock, the revenue for the 40-show residency is estimated to be $256 million. The outlet also noted 661,456 tickets were sold for the residency. Additionally, tickets were going for upwards of three times their face value on the secondary market. Needless to say, U2’s Sphere residency was a massive success.\n\nAs previously reported, the venue cost $2.3 billion to build. In December 2023, The Hollywood Reporter noted the 17 shows U2 performed through Nov. 30 generated $30.7 million in revenue, which is an average of $1.8 million per show.\n\nAdditionally, The Sphere has screened Darren Aronofsky’s film Postcards From Earth. Through Nov. 30, the state-of-the-art venue has hosted 111 screenings of the film, which has resulted in $44.5 million in revenue. This averages to $400,000 per screening. Altogether, these two attractions have generated over $75 million in revenue for the new venue.\n\nAfter U2, Who’s Coming to Sphere Next?\n\nWith U2’s residency officially in the books, Phish will be the next band to perform at The Sphere. Their show dates are currently April 18-21. After Phish, Dead & Company’s “Dead Forever” residency will begin on May 16 and include the following dates.\n\n-May 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26, 30 and 31.\n\n-June 1, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21 and 22.\n\nAfter Dead & Company, it’s unknown who will have the next Sphere residency. However, rumors surfaced last week that The Eagles could be next. The band is in talks for a Sphere residency, but a deal has yet to be finalized.\n\nThe Eagles, of course, are currently in the middle of their farewell tour, which is appropriately called “The Long Goodbye.” The band announced their farewell tour in July 2023. They confirmed the tour is “currently in the planning stages” and will be rolling out dates and venues once they are confirmed.\n\nAs of publishing, there is no set end date for the tour.\n\nU2: Their 50 Best Songs, Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
