        "text": "When I started this Battle of the Bands series, my plan was to compare two rock bands that were of equal stature and which competed for roughly the same audience in the same decade. My previous entry, which put The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac into the death-match cage, certainly met these criteria.\n\nThis entry, however, might seem a bit of a stretch. U2 and Bruce Springsteen were arguably the best rock acts of the 1980s. Not only were they hugely popular concert bands (as the great Reggie Jackson once said, they put “more asses in the seats”), they also produced the most consistently beautiful music of the period. Yes, there were many other great artists in the 80s: Michael Jackson, Madonna, Sting, John Mellencamp, R.E.M., the Talking Heads, the B-52s, Peter Gabriel, and on and on. But none of these acts had quite the dominance of either U2 or Springsteen, either in commercial terms or in critical reputation. More importantly, no other musical artists captured the imagination of the public as consistently—and with such varied offerings—as U2 and the Boss. These were the bands that risked the most, aimed the highest, and pulled it off.\n\nSpringsteen came first. He was already a rock star when I started high school in 1981, having hit the big-time with that one amazing, surging anthem, Born to Run, way back in 1975. It’s a great song about freedom and escape and the urgency of youth, and it rocked the consciousness of 1970s pre-punk America like a nuclear bomb.\n\nEven so, I have to confess that as a kid growing up in Gainesville, Florida—not exactly the deep south, but close enough—Springsteen was pretty much off my radar. He was from somewhere “up there” in the northeast. He was big city. He was working class. In short, I didn’t know Bruce Springsteen from Rick Springfield.\n\nU2 was a different story. I first became of aware of them in 1983, when their classic song New Year’s Day came out and went into immediate, heavy rotation on the local rock stations. This instant success was paradoxical since, as far as I can tell, New Year’s Day isn’t really a rock song at all. Nor is it pop. Like Springsteen’s, U2’s work is difficult to pin down.\n\nClearly, they fell somewhere into the realm of post-punk British Prog-Rock that was experiencing a renaissance at the time. (U2 is Irish, of course, but I didn’t know the difference.) But what really made U2 stand out from the rest of the FM prog-Rock crowd was the sheer power of their sound. Paul Hewson (a.k.a. Bono) has a BIG, HEROIC VOICE, which seemed destined to fill a concert hall (or maybe a cathedral). And backing him up on guitar was David Evans (The Edge), whose trademark “tapestry” effect made use of extreme delay technique that was a true innovation at the time. The guys had real passion, and (more importantly) the musical chops to back it up.\n\nU2 hit even bigger with their next album, The Unforgettable Fire, in 1984. The title track remains one of U2’s best songs (my personal favorite, actually), and it marked the beginning of the band’s collaboration with the weirdo genius Brian Eno, who produced the album. Many rock historians give Eno credit for helping the band achieve that soaring, dramatic sound for which the band became known. I was seventeen at the time, and I didn’thave a clue about Brian Eno. Nor did I have any awareness of the album’s heavy political themes (concerning everything from Martin Luther King to the Hiroshima bombings of World War II). I just knew I loved the sound. Bono wails through it like some outraged angel, and the Edge’s searing guitar licks (especially on Wire) marked him as one of the great guitarists of his generation.\n\nIn case you hadn’t guessed, listening to The Unforgettable Fire was as close I would come to a religious experience for many years.\n\nAnd where was that yank Springsteen during all this? He had fled to wastelands of Nebraska.\n\nWell, that was the title, anyway, of his 1982 solo album, recorded by himself in his New Jersey home on a simple 4-track cassette machine. It’s hard to imagine a more stripped-down work than this; most of Nebraska’s songs feature Springsteen alone, howling mournfully like Woody Guthrie on a three-day bender. He is accompanied only by his acoustic guitar and harmonica (both of which he plays beautifully).\n\nBut if the sound is folk-like, the sentiment is 100% pure country. Johnny Cash in his darkest hour could not have conjured up more disturbing material. The title track is inspired by nineteen-year-old serial killer Charles Starkweather, who went on a killing spree through rural Nebraska (a nightmarish event that also inspired a 1970s film with Martin Sheen called Badlands). The rest of the album is likewise populated by a series of Godforsaken of characters: criminals, gamblers, crooks, and losers.\n\nLet’s face it: there’s a fair amount of pretentiousness in a east-coast guy like Springsteen singing dirges about killers in the mid-west, as there is with U2 singing about Martin Luther King. But like U2, Springsteen makes it work through the sheer beauty of his art. All of his characters are poor and desperate, and the poetry with which he describes them is genuinely haunting.\n\nIn fact, I think the real secret to the success of this album—and to all of Springsteen’s best work—is compassion. He obviously feels for these poor saps, and it shows on every heart-wrenching chord. He actually howls on State Trooper. Only one song on the album, Atlantic City, bears even a hint of that familiar Springsteen defiance (so much in evidence on earlier songs such as Born to Run and Hungry Heart).\n\nSpringsteen’s greatest success of the decade, of course, was 1984’s Born in the USA with its amazing line up of hits, including the fine title track (probably the best song ever about the Vietnam War), and Glory Days. But I think Nebraska is a better album.\n\nIt was also an influential one. Across the Atlantic, Bono and the Edge took notice. Supposedly, they credit Nebraska as being at least a partial inspiration for U2’s next album, The Joshua Tree, in 1987. Like Nebraska, The Joshua Tree marked a journey into the darker regions of the American psyche, and the thematic comparisons between these two great albums are almost too obvious. The signature song, Where the Streets Have No Name, feels like a sequel to the Springsteen’s Mansion on the Hill, albeit amped-up with U2’s own soaring, operatic style.\n\nWhen I look back at these two albums, however, I am struck by two key differences between them, and between the artists themselves. Musically, The Joshua Tree is almost a transcendent experience. Even when Bono sings his darkest lyrics, you feel a tremendous sense of uplift, an almost spiritual gleam. You find yourself lost in his heroic vocals, and in The Edge’s tapestry of guitar sound.\n\nNebraska isn’t like that. It leaves you on the same empty dirt road you started on.\n\nThe other difference is how detailed—how literary—Nebraska feels when compared to The Joshua Tree. Both albums are deep and ambitious artistic creations, but only Nebraska is filled with novelistic details. If The Joshua Tree is set in some hypothetical America where the streets have no name, Nebraska is set in real, gritty places like Lincoln and Atlantic City. The narrator of the title song drives through the countryside with a “sawed off .410 on my lap,” and Springsteen describes The Mansion on the Hill so vividly that you can almost picture it as an Edward Hopper painting.\n\nIn short, Bono might have “held the hand of the Devil,” but Springsteen smoked a joint with him."
