        "text": "U2 have joined an elite hitmakers' club that has only three other members: Michael Jackson, Madonna, and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. What do all those artists have in common? They've all landed Top 40 hits on the charts in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s. U2 join the club by way of \"XXX,\" their Kendrick Lamar collaboration that just debuted at number 33 on Billboard's Hot 100.\n\nJackson's most recent Top 40 hit was the posthumous Justin Timberlake duet \"Love Never Felt So Good,\" which made the top ten in 2014. Madonna went to number 10 with \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" (featuring Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.) in 2012, while \"Weird Al\" most recently hit the Top 40 with his Robin Thicke parody \"Word Crimes\" in 2014. (Billboard)\n\nCountry is the druggiest genre\n\nWhat music genre includes the most references to drugs? It's country music, according to an Addiction.com analysis. The other genres studied, in descending order of drugginess, are jazz, pop, electronic, rock, \"other,\" folk, and — in last place — hip-hop. According to the analysis of 1.41 million songs, certain drug-obsessed hip-hop acts (Kottonmouth Kings, The Game, Cypress Hill) create a false impression that rappers in general talk about drugs all the time. In fact, according to this analysis, it's far more likely you'll catch a reference to weed or cocaine in a country song than in a rap (or a folk) song. (Noisey)\n\nHaim announce new album\n\nHaim have finally, officially, announced their sophomore album. Something To Tell You will be out July 7, and a first single — \"Right Now\" — is already out, with a video directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. (Pitchfork)\n\nStevie freakin' Nicks is on the new Lana Del Rey album\n\nPitchfork is reporting that none other than the legendary Stevie Nicks makes an appearance on the new Lana Del Rey album. We may have to wait until the album's release date — which still hasn't been announced, but is supposedly \"soon\" — to learn more. The album will also feature contributions from the Weeknd and Sean Lennon.\n\nAretha takes Dionne beef to the fax level\n\nIt's getting serious now: Aretha’s fired up the fax machine. The Associated Press says it received \"a lengthy fax\" from the Queen of Soul, detailing her complaints regarding her peer Dionne Warwick. Franklin is miffed at comments made by Warwick at the funeral of Whitney Houston, when Warwick — by way of apologizing for the absent Franklin — falsely said that Franklin was Houston's godmother.\n\nWhether Warwick meant that literally or spiritually, the gloves are off. Franklin says the two have never been friends, and goes so far as to call Warwick's comments \"libel [...] I don't think that Dionne has ever liked me.\" When the two crossed paths at the recent screening of a Clive Davis documentary, Warwick tried to give Franklin a hug. By Franklin's own account, she said, \"Oh, hell no. You can't be serious.\" (Rolling Stone)\n\nDave Grohl's middle school report card read aloud on national TV"
