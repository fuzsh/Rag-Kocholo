        "text": "For the aircraft, see Lockheed U-2.\n\nU2 is an Irish rock band. The four members of the band are lead singer Bono (born Paul David Hewson), lead guitarist The Edge (born David Howell Evans), bassist Adam Clayton, and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. U2 are a very popular band all over the world and have been since the 1980s. They have sold more than 170 million albums and have won 22 Grammy Awards. This is more than any other rock band.\n\nU2 formed in Dublin in 1976, when none of the members were very good musicians. However, they got better as they got older. They were more popular for playing live shows than for releasing albums. This changed with their hit record in 1987, The Joshua Tree. In 1991, U2 released a new album called Achtung Baby. This album sounded very different from their other albums because it was inspired by alternative rock and dance music. Achtung Baby and its worldwide Zoo TV Tour were both very popular. U2 experimented for the rest of the 1990s, making two other very different albums, Zooropa and Pop.\n\nIn the 21st century, U2 returned to a more traditional sound, but they continue to be very popular and successful. They are involved in charities and helping people with groups such as Amnesty International, Make Poverty History, the ONE Campaign, Live Aid, Live 8, Bono's DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade in Africa) campaign, and Music Rising.\n\nIn 2014, the group won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for their song Ordinary Love which was used in the movie Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.\n\nHistory\n\nFormation (1976-1979)\n\nU2 was formed in the city of Dublin, Ireland on September 25, 1976. It was founded by 14 year-old drummer Larry Mullen Jr. He posted a note on his school's notice board, asking for musicians to create a new band. There were seven teenage boys who went to their first practice. At first, the band was called \"The Larry Mullen Band\", but they later changed their name to \"Feedback\" and then \"The Hype\". The band became smaller over time, eventually becoming just four people, and they finally changed their name to \"U2\" once Bono, The Edge, Clayton, and Mullen were left.\n\nAlbums\n\nBoy (1980)\n\nOctober (1981)\n\nWar (1983)\n\nThe Unforgettable Fire (1984)\n\nThe Joshua Tree (1987)\n\nRattle and Hum (1988)\n\nAchtung Baby (1991)\n\nZooropa (1993)\n\nPop (1997)\n\nAll That You Can't Leave Behind (2000)\n\nHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004)\n\nNo Line on the Horizon (2009)\n\nSongs of Innocence (2014)\n\nSongs of Experience (2017)\n\nImages for kids\n\nThe band formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin in 1976 when the members were teenagers.\n\nSteve Lillywhite produced the band's first three studio albums: Boy, October, and War.\n\nU2 performing at the US Festival in May 1983\n\nU2 performing in Sydney in September 1984 on the Unforgettable Fire Tour\n\nThe tree pictured on The Joshua Tree album sleeve. Adam Clayton said, \"The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record.\"\n\nBono in March 1992 on the Zoo TV Tour portraying his persona \"The Fly\", a leather-clad egomaniac meant to parody rock stardom.\n\nContrasting with the elaborate stadium productions of the band's previous two tours, the Elevation Tour was a scaled-down affair, featuring a heart-shaped ramp around the stage.\n\nU2 perform during the Elevation Tour in Kansas City in 2001\n\nThe outdoor stage of the Vertigo Tour, pictured in June 2005, featured a massive LED screen.\n\nAt 164 feet tall, the stage structure from the U2 360Â° Tour was the largest ever constructed. It allowed for a 360-degree seating configuration.\n\nU2 performing at the Apple product launch at which Songs of Innocence was announced in September 2014\n\nU2 takes a curtain call during a 7 November 2015 performance on the Innocence + Experience Tour (from left to right): the Edge, Bono, Mullen, Clayton\n\nU2 performing in 2009.
