        "text": "\"Kyrgyzstan has its product niche which can compete with other countries of EEU,\" member of the board of the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) Sergei Sidorsky told journalists.\n\nAccording to him, the economy of Kyrgyzstan has a competitive advantage. For example, the Kyrgyz Republic can deliver to the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union spring vegetables and fruits. The country can give the alliance partners a good run for money in agriculture sector.\n\n\"You should use this niche. It is necessary to see what you can do today as \"Kyrgyzstan - an export-oriented country\" for the internal market of the Union. It is worth to study what we do not produce or import from countries outside the EEU. In such a way Kyrgyzstan will be able to increase exports. Take these questions on board. Also, you may have a well-developed energy economy. Today, many energy projects are implemented, including ones on the green economy, the economy of the future. This is a very promising direction,\" Sergei Sidorsky said.\n\n\"The cost of industrial and economic activity in the EEU today is two- three times higher than in individual sectors of the economy. We have vast resources within countries. Throwing away all the useless that has been hanging over the economy for years, we would make a qualitative leap. We will at once see our own large market and export markets for our countries,\" he added."
