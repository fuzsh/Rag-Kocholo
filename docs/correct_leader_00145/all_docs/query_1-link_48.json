        "text": "MINSK, May 29 The future of Belarus can no longer depend on Russia, President Alexander Lukashenko declared on Friday, a day after talks between the once close ex-Soviet allies ended in acrimony.\n\nMr Lukashenko, whose government was dubbed Europe's last dictatorship by the United States but is now courting closer ties with the European Union, said the days of Minsk “bowing down” to Moscow were over.\n\nHis extraordinary anti-Moscow tirade came a day after his talks with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in Minsk were overshadowed by bitter disputes over Russian loans to Belarus and recent Belarussian overtures to the EU.\n\n“It's not working out with Russia. We don't need to bow down. We don't need to whine and cry,” his press service quoted Lukashenko as telling his government.\n\n“We need to look for our happiness on a different part of the planet. I consciously say this in public. From this day on, that time has come to an end and another time has started.”\n\nTensions were already brewing thanks to Belarus's moves to join the EU Eastern Partnership plan to foster closer ties between the EU and six ex-Soviet states, an initiative Russia regards with the greatest suspicion.But Mr Lukashenko's ire appeared to have been sparked by Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin who during Mr Putin's visit said the Belarussian finances were in such a dire state it could default on its debt by the end of the year.\n\nKudrin also said Belarus had refused the next 500 million dollar tranche of a Russian loan to Minsk because it did not want to receive the money in Russian roubles.\n\nThe president expressed outrage that while he had a “normal discussion” with Putin, Kudrin had at the same time given a briefing “whose aim was to sow panic in Belarus”.\n\nHe also gave a public dressing-down to Prime Minister Sergei Sidorsky for pursuing close ties with Russia.\n\n“Sergei Sergeyevich, stop taking your ministers along this trodden path,” Mr Lukashenko said.\n\n“Why are you sidling up to Russia, where we get kicked? Don't you understand that this is not the first time when they want to take us naked with their bare hands?”\n\nHe also expressed certainty that comments by Mr Kudrin, the Russian finance minister, had been agreed in advance with Putin. The Russian prime minister late on Thursday had ticked off Kudrin for his “extreme assessments”.\n\nLukashenko — a former collective farm manager proud of posing on a pair of skis or ice skates — has ruled the ex-Soviet republic of 10 million people in an authoritarian fashion since 1994.\n\nHe last week launched an attack on Moscow for reneging on pacts, expressing himself in characteristically earthy terms. However, the latest tirade appeared to show a new level of anger.\n\nThe EU had placed Lukashenko on a travel blacklist, but this was lifted in October amid warming ties and the Belarussian leader in April met Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican.\n\nBelarus — which borders EU members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland — has been a close ally of Russia since the Soviet collapse and has close military cooperation as well as a joint customs union with its giant eastern neighbour.\n\nIt has also received financial help from Russia, including a multi-billion dollar credit package agreed in Dec 2007, of which the disputed 500 million dollar tranche was the latest part.\n\nKudrin also said Minsk has requested nine billion dollars to build a nuclear power station. But he warned it was too early to say whether Belarus would receive any money.\n\nBut Lukashenko said his country would now “look to other places, where people are waiting for us and we will trade — be it ten tractors, a combine harvester, a spoonful of sugar”.\n\n“If we don't stand tall... we are going to be running in a sweat to the right and the left in the hope that someone is going to throw us a piece of bread from the table,” he commented. —AFP"
