In August 1991, the country declared independence from the Soviet Union and renamed the country as the Republic of Belarus. In March 1994, Belarus adopted a new constitution, which officially ended the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Between the 1991 Declaration of Independence and the drafting of the Constitution in 1994, the Prime Minister served as the head of government but with the 1994 Constitution, most of the functions of the Prime Minister were given to the President of Belarus.\n\nPrime Ministers Of Belarus\n\nSergei Sidorsky, The Longest Serving PM Of Belarus\n\nSergei Sidorsky was the longest-serving prime minister in the history of the Republic of Belarus, having served 2,728 days between July 2003 and December 2010.
