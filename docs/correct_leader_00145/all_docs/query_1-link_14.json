        "text": "Belarus would like to use the Russian agrarian technologies to the maximum, Prime Minister of Belarus Sergei Sidorsky said at a meeting with Russian Agriculture Minister Aleksei Gordeyev in Minsk on December 11. The agricultural industries of Belarus and Russia have long-standing relations, “all the issues are constructively addressed, rational decisions are taken”, the Premier said. Belarus has been closely following the implementation of the Russian national programmes. The country is interested in taking part in federal and regional programmes of Russia including in the agrarian industry, Sergei Sidorsky said. The Gomel and Mogilev oblasts of Belarus have been closely cooperating with the Russian border regions, including the Bryansk oblast. This collaboration is an evidence of deep integration and exchange of the advanced technologies. “There are good prospects for us to implement national and the Union State programmes designed for the next decade. It is especially important today taking into account the global financial crisis,” the Prime Minister said. According to Sergei Sidorsky, the Russian ruble can be used as a regional currency. The expansion of mutual deliveries of goods including staples, enhancement of technological regimes between the companies of Belarus and Russia can be implemented through the currencies of the two states, Sergei Sidorsky said. “This is a forward-looking idea we should consider,” he emphasized. The Belarusian Premier said that the previous joint session reached rational decisions. He also informed that, as agreed with Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin, the two sides will hold regular joint sessions and not only in Moscow and Minsk but also in other cities. “The main thing is to continue working, exchange technologies, reach the goals set out by the presidents of the two countries, especially in the food sector of the economy. The security of the two countries will depend particularly on the diversity of the goods we trade in, which is vitally important for the economic development of Belarus and Russia,” Sergei Sidorsky said. Russian Agriculture Minister Aleksei Gordeyev said that Russia is interested in increasing the imports of Belarusian staple products. In his words, Belarus is Russia’s key partner in several trading positions. “We are interested in stepping up the imports of Belarusian food and cutting down the imports of staples from other countries,” the Russian Minister said. Belarusian products are of high quality, they meet Russian sanitary and hygienic requirements. According to Aleksei Gordeyev, the joint session of the Agriculture Ministries of Russia and Belarus in Minsk was fruitful enough. “The most important issues of trade, veterinary barriers were discussed in a calm and constructive atmosphere. The two sides decided to hold such meetings annually,” he said. The integration with Belarus has “a high political background what can become the basis to form the Eurasian Economic Community and develop the economies of the EurAsEC states”. The cooperation between the agrarian services of Belarus and Russia can also serve as an example for other industries, Aleksei Gordeyev said.\n\nБЕЛТА\n\nAll news"
