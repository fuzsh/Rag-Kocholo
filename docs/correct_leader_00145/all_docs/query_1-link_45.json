(Xinhua/Lan Hongguang)\n\n\"Developing good relationship with Belarus is a policy that China highly values and will never change, regardless of the fluctuation of international and regional situations,\" said Xi.\n\nChina is willing to further deepen and broaden bilateral ties with Belarus, said Xi.\n\nEconomic cooperation is an important component of Sino- Belarusian strategic cooperation, which has transformed from commercial trade to economic and technological cooperation, said the Chinese leader.\n\nIn order to further enhance bilateral economic cooperation, China and Belarus should pay close attention to the implementation of major comprehensive projects, and give full play to the role of the Sino-Belarusian cooperative committee of economy, science and military technology.\n\nThe committee should step up guidance and coordination on bilateral cooperation, as well as map out priorities in practical bilateral cooperation under new circumstances, said Xi.\n\nXi also suggested China and Belarus draw on each other's comparative advantages and explore new growth areas such as technological cooperation.\n\nSidorsky, for his part, spoke highly of the intensified cooperation between the two countries in recent years on economy, science, energy and others.\n\nBelarus heartily thanked China for its help in Belarusian economic and social development, said Sidorsky, expressing confidence that Xi's fruitful visit would add new and strong momentum to the development of the friendly cooperative relationship between the two countries.\n\nAfter their meeting, Xi and Sidorsky witnessed the signing of a series of cooperation agreements between financial institutions and enterprises from both countries, with a total worth of 3.4 billion U.S. dollars.\n\nXi, who came here on an official visit, also met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the meeting, Xi hailed the Sino-Belarusian ties as a prototype for nation-to-nation relations.\n\nIn order to further advance bilateral ties, China and Belarus should maintain high-level interactions, strengthen mutual support, promote practical cooperation, enhance cultural exchange and reinforce coordination in international collaboration, said Xi.\n\nXi and Lukashenko on Wednesday also attended the signing ceremony of cooperation documents in such areas as economy, technology and finance, and met with entrepreneurs from both countries.\n\nXi left Belarus on Thursday afternoon and headed for Helsinki, Finland, the third leg of his 12-day, four-nation European tour that also included Russia and Sweden."
