According to him, the baby food manufacturers have been increasing the output. However, while upgrading, the producers are not diversifying the recipes. There are around 1.5 million cans stored at warehouses. This means the product is not that popular on the domestic market. “Why increase the output if the warehouses are stocked up to the roof?” the Prime Minister asked. “A demand for a product is an indicator of its quality, Sergei Sidorsky stressed.- Therefore the Health Ministry and Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs need to boost the production of high quality baby food, first of all, by means of improving the recipes so that Belarusian products enjoy demand in the domestic market first of all. The money should be assigned for promising projects”."
