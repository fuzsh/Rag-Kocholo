        "text": "Weeks after Ottawa refused to let aplane from Belarus stop for refuelling, the former Soviet state plans to ban Canadian and U.S. flights over its territory.\n\nOn April 20, aplane carrying Belarusian Prime Minister Sergei Sidorsky was on its way to Cuba for an official visit when both Canada and theUnited Statesrefused to let it land and refuel. Ottawa cited human rights concerns.\n\nThe Belarusian Foreign Ministry announced the ban onThursday, after it wasproposed thisweek byPresident Alexander Lukashenko.\n\n\"Belarus strictly observes symmetry in adopting any sort of retaliatory measures,\" a foreign ministry spokesman,Andrei Popov, told a news conference.\n\n\"These restrictions will apply only to two countries: the United States and Canada.\"\n\nPopov said it hasn't been decided whether to ban all Canadian and American flights or only flights carrying official delegations.\n\nIt's not clear how many flights would be affected by the move. Canada and theUnited Statespay roughly $200,000 to Belarus each year for the use of its airspace, west of Russia and north of Ukraine.\n\nForeign Affairs has not commented on the decision.\n\nStopover refused because ofcrackdowns\n\nOttawa refused to let the plane land on April 20because of concerns about \"the current regime's commitment to democratization and human rights,\" a foreign affairs spokeswoman, Pamela Greenwell, said at the time.\n\nLukashenko has come under increased international criticism following his controversial election win in March and subsequent crackdown on protests against the vote, which critics claim was rigged.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators have been arrested since Lukashenko's victory. The European Union has called on governments around the world to refuse to recognize the vote.\n\nIn early April, a Canadian journalist spent 15 days in prison while covering an anti-Lukashenko demonstration.\n\n\"In light of these concerns, we were not prepared to facilitate the entry of senior-level representatives of the Belarusian regime onto Canadian soil,\" Greenwell told CBC News Online.\n\nGreenwell said she didn't know what alternate arrangements the plane made in order to land safely. The Cuban newspaper Granma said the plane had been carrying Sidorsky and a number of other government officials."
