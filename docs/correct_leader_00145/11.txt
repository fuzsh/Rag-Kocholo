Sidorsky, Putin to meet in Brest in March

GOMEL, 3 February (BelTA) – A meeting between the prime ministers of Belarus and Russia is scheduled for 16 March in Brest, Prime Minister of Belarus Sergei Sidorsky told reporters in Gomel. The sides are expected to consider the fuel and energy cooperation between Belarus and Russia. Belarus and Russia have recently signed a protocol to the 2007 agreement which spells out the areas of further development of trade and economic relations between the two countries in oil refining in 2010. “In accordance with the agreement, Belarus will get 6.3 million tonnes of Russian oil duty-free for domestic consumption. This volume is enough to satisfy the demand of the Belarusian market,” Sergei Sidorsky said. The rest will be supplied to Belarus with 100% duties which are effective in the Russian Federation until the single customs territory comes into force within the framework of the Customs Union of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. “Common customs tariffs became effective on 1 January this year. From 1 July 2010 we will have a single customs territory and by 2012 we will finish creating the single economic space. The second and third steps presuppose new scenarios of cooperation in fuel and energy. They should be reflected in the new programme of Belarus-Russia cooperation in fuel and energy,” Sergei Sidorsky said. The relevant document and proposals of Belarus are being coordinated with Russian partners. The draft programme is expected to be submitted for consideration of Sergei Sidorsky and Vladimir Putin during their meeting in Brest.
