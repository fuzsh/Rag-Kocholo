The following list and accompanying photographs identify those iconic ironmaking blast furnace stacks that remain standing in the United States. Most of these monumental structures were built between the 1770s and 1880s. The quality of their construction (mostly with a cut stone exterior and a fire brick interior) is a testament to surviving time, wear, vandalism, neglect, and weather since being shut down. A number of others have been lovingly and painstakingly restored by local, state, and federal historic preservation organizations.

Reasons for iron furnaces being taken out of blast (shut down) ranged from depleted resources (both iron and/or timber); financial downturns and panics, both locally and nationally; and the development of new techniques for producing iron and steel products, such as the Bessemer process.

Any additions, suggestions, or corrections to the list below are most appreciated. The list does not include those furnace stacks that have been destroyed, removed, demolished, or have deteriorated into ruins as a simply a base or rubble. Sadly, there are many examples of stone iron furnace stacks that have been lost to time and history.
