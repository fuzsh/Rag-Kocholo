Really, the edges. Pacem in Terris, just off Route 94 on Fancher Road in Warwick, is a few acres on the edge: of the Wawayanda Creek, of the railroad, of a junkyard, at the intersection of three rural roads. Situated over a fresh water spring, an old stone grain mill has been turned into a “trans-religious” sanctuary. There are regular musical events, sculpture gardens and sitting areas. Enchanted? How could it help being so!\n\nOn the day I visited, it was a multi-sensual event. The air was thick with the smell of fresh creosote from new railroad ties mixing with dying lilacs. The rains had swollen the creek and the old stone watermill was being rebuilt. A tractor trailer was chugging up the driveway to the junkyard, or “recycling center,” next door. The ironic vitality of the place was overwhelming.\n\nPoet Lynn Hoins first visited in 1982 and immediately felt that “land speaks and how at times in life you encounter places that offer just what you need, just where you need to go.” She’s written about this in her book, Called by Stones.\n\nPacem in Terris, named for the major work of Pope John XXIII, was the home of spiritual teacher and writer Frederick Franck (1909-2006) and his wife Claske. I first met them in 1972, just after his now classic book, The Zen of Seeing, was published. A few quotes:\n\n“I have learned that what I have not drawn I have never really seen, and that when I start drawing an ordinary thing, I realize how extraordinary it is, sheer miracle.”\n\n“Art is neither a profession nor a hobby. Art is a way of being.”\n\nPacem in Terris is a living, growing testimony to the importance of the spiritual, the natural, the cultural and the idiosyncratic. It’s open every day from May to October. You must go there. frederickfranck.org. Thin places beguile and inspire.

Trees are creatures that invite us into thin places: that zone where we feel something “else”. For the Celts, trees were entrances to the Otherworld, the Land of Fae. Because of their size, their longevity, their generosity with shade, wood and food, trees have always been an intimate part of human life. They have a trunk and limbs – like we do. Human history is full of special trees: Council Trees, Treaty Trees, Wisdom Trees, Scary Trees, Sacred Trees.\n\nBut since Hurricane Irene and that October snowstorm, most people around here do not see trees as kindly. People’s fear and anger at trees have resulted in quite a bit of pre-emptive cutting in the last months."
