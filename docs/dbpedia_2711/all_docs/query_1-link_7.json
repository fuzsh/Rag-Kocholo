The dark line on the horizon is the Breezy Point jetty built in the early 1970s.\n\nFigure 186. Stone Indian artifacts washed up on the New York beach after storms. The occurrence of these materials on area beaches is an indication that sea level is progressively rising. A rich archeological record is probably submerged offshore. Artifacts are made from chert derived from the Valley and Ridge region, and local granite and schist. The Swiss army knife is four inches for scale.\n\nFigure 187. Map of Jamaica Bay, Coney Island, Rockaway Spit (Brooklyn and Queens).\n\nFigure 188. Peat exposed by beach erosion at low tide at Floyd Bennett Field. Note the new marsh grass growth about a meter above the high tide line. These peat deposits are another indication that sea level is rising.\n\nFigure 189. A wrackline of broken surf clam shells along mud flats exposed at low tide along Plumb Beach in Brooklyn. Beach and shore dunes are on the left\n\nFigure 190. Shell hash accumulations exposed high in the shore dunes at Plumb Beach. These storm deposits formed during nor'easters in the early 1990s.\n\nFigure 191. The Cyclone at Coney Island has been terrorizing riders since the late 1920s.\n\nFigure 192. Map of Fire Island National Seashore with Robert Moses State Park along the south shore of Long Island.\n\n.Figure 193. Aerial photograph map of Robert Moses State Park. Note the location of the end of Fire Island in 1825 when the lighthouse was built.\n\nFigure 194. Layered bedding exposed by storm erosion of the shore dunes. The top of the Fire Island Lighthouse is in the distance.\n\nFigure 195. A runnel is formed on the beach as a bar migrates on shore in the spring (after much beach erosion during the previous winter) at Robert Moses State Park.\n\nFigure 196. Westward view from the Fire Island Lighthouse observation deck of the \"new land\" that has formed since the lighthouse was built in 1825. This new land is now Robert Moses State Park.\n\nFigure 197. Eastward view from the Fire Island Lighthouse observation deck of the increasingly narrow Fire Island.\n\nFigure 198. Clam-bored peat eroded from submerged deposits offshore from Westhampton Beach. One indication that sea level is rising and that the barrier islands are migrating shoreward.\n\nFigure 199. Aerial photographs of the disaster area at Westhampton Beach.\n\nFigure 200. An operation to modify the groins at Westhampton Beach.\n\nFigure 201. A Holocene time line for the New York City region showing growth and changes of the human population.\n\nFigure 202.

Note the buildup of sky scrappers in the Wall Street area in the distance.\n\nFigure 204.
