        "text": "Introduction\n\nOne of the most important causes of disease and premature death in the world is environmental pollution. According Landrigan et al. (2018), it is responsible for approximately 9 million deaths per year, 16% of all deaths worldwide, three times more deaths than those related to AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. In Mexico, specifically air pollution has been an important issue for the country’s administration, since in addition to having contributed to climate change (Silva Rodríguez de San Miguel 2019), it harms the health of Mexicans through various ways (Calderón-Garcidueñas et al. 2015; Mamkhezri et al. 2020). The pollution problem can be explained by excessive industrialization in the largest and most densely populated areas of the country (Paquette 2015) and mobile sources (Camacho-García and Flamand 2007). On the other hand, water pollution also produces negative impacts on ecosystems and human health. Palacios Nava et al., 2018, mentions that in the country, approximately 73% of water bodies are polluted; 80% comes from discharges from urban sources and 85% from industrial discharges that do not undergo prior treatment.\n\nThe Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is one of the most affected by pollution, it was declared the most polluted city in the world in 1991 and although, in recent decades, the authorities have developed strategies for the reduction of air pollution, the current levels of particulate matter (PM) and ozone are still above what is established by the World Health Organization (Calderón-Garcidueñas et al. 2015; García-Franco 2020). Bell et al. (2006) mentions that there are several studies that have identified the relationship between air pollution and health, for example, particulate matter (PM) has been associated with mortality, including infant mortality, and with heart rate variability in the elderly. On the other hand, ozone levels have been associated with mortality, increased school absenteeism in children, emergency consultations for asthma and other respiratory problems. Likewise, poor management of urban, industrial, and agricultural wastewater leads to the water consumed by millions of people being contaminated with chemical substances and/or pathogenic microorganisms, which can cause severe damage to their health (WHO 2019).\n\nAir pollution is a harmful phenomenon for the environment and human health; it is formed by a mixture of gases and particles in harmful quantities that are released into the atmosphere mainly due to activities of natural or anthropogenic origin (Dodman et al. 2010). Within the gaseous pollutants are inorganic compounds, for example, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2), there are also metals such as lead (Pb) and chromium (Cr), as well as volatile organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Tiotiu et al. 2020). On the other hand, the smallest particulate matter (PM) of a specific size is a complex mixture of dust, soot, smoke and liquid droplets. The size of the particles is very important, as it determines their impact on the respiratory tract. Depending on their diameter, they are divided into three categories: PM10 coarse (2.5 to 10 µm), PM2.5 fine (0.1 to 2.5 µm), and PM0.1 ultrafine (less than 0.1 µm). Coarse particles are deposited mainly in the nasopharynx or primary bronchi; fine particles may be deposited in the alveoli and terminal bronchioles, and ultrafine particles cross cell membranes and interact directly with cellular structures (Kelly and Fussell 2012). One of the biological mechanisms that may explain the association between air pollution and respiratory disease is oxidative stress. Pollutants can act directly by forming reactive oxygen species (ROS) that diffuse from the airway surface, or indirectly by inducing inflammation (Kim et al. 2019). On the other hand, the liver being an important organ in the metabolism and biotransformation of inhaled air pollutants, liver function could be directly or indirectly affected by them or their metabolites, causing damage to major liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Qiu et al. 2021). In a study by Kim et al. (2015), they found that short-term exposure to air pollutants such as PM2.5, NO2 and O3 is associated with increased liver enzyme levels in elderly adults.\n\nIn relation to water pollution, toxic substances present in water bodies, such as pesticides, emerging pollutants, metals, and POPs, can cause countless damages to human health and affect the balance of ecosystems; they enter through several pathways, including effluents from wastewater treatment plants, untreated wastewater, urban runoff, and leaching from agricultural land and open dumps (Inostroza et al. 2016). There is a strong relationship between contaminants present in water and human health problems, due to the continuous interaction with freshwater supplies impacted by contamination. The adverse effects caused by exposure to the toxics described above are the following: immunological, neurotoxic, endocrine, reproductive, and genetic effects (Larrea Poma 2013). According to the World Health Organization, water pollution contributes to 70% of different diseases and 20% to cancer worldwide (Khan et al. 2021). One of the groups of contaminants have been detected in drinking water are metals, which generally exceed the limits recommended by regulatory systems worldwide. There are a number of adverse effects on human metabolism that has resulted from exposure to drinking water contaminated with metals such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg), and the general mechanism of toxicity is through ROS production, oxidative damage and subsequent health effects (Fu and Xi 2020). Metal toxicity is also associated with cancer, dermatitis, cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and liver dysfunction (Islam et al. 2011).\n\nDespite the importance of reservoirs as providers of drinking water for the population, many of them are deteriorated in Mexico, such is the case of the Madín dam (Pérez-Coyotl et al. 2019). This reservoir is located between the municipalities of Atizapán de Zaragoza and Naucalpan de Juárez, its geographical coordinates are 19°31′37″ North latitude and 99°15′33″ West longitude. The mainstream that feeds the dam is the Tlalnepantla River, which is one of the most important in the Valley of Mexico. Along its course, it receives a series of streams, including the El Muerto and El Polvorín. This reservoir was built to control the flow of the Tlalnepantla River and convert part of the volume of stored water into drinking water. The reservoir has a maximum capacity of 25 million m3, but generally stores only 13 million m3, in order to anticipate higher flows; a small part of this volume, approximately 600 L/s, is pumped to the Madín water treatment plant for distribution through the municipal water supply. This plant is operated by the National Water Commission (CONAGUA) and uses an aluminum-based treatment to coagulate organic matter. It supplies 2% of the drinking water to some neighborhoods in the municipalities of Naucalpan de Juárez and Atizapán de Zaragoza; the remaining neighborhoods receive drinking water from the Cutzamala system or from wells (Galar-Martínez et al. 2010). Various contaminants have been detected in this water body, such as metals, emerging contaminants, pesticides, and persistent organic pollutants (Pérez-Coyotl et al. 2019). In addition, contaminants in Madín Dam water have been found to induce oxidative stress, genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and embryotoxicity in aquatic organisms (Galar-Martínez et al. 2010; González-González et al. 2014; Morachis-Valdez et al. 2015; Pérez-Coyotl et al. 2017).\n\nThe presence of pollutants in both water and air contribute to the deterioration of the health of human populations; due to this, the objective of the present study was to evaluate in clinically healthy subjects the oxidative stress through the degree of lipoperoxidation (LPX), as well as the modification of serum enzyme levels, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) associated with air and drinking water pollutants in three zones of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City, two of them related to the Madin Dam.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA study was conducted to evaluate the alteration of the main liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH) and the level of LPX associated with the levels of ambient air and drinking water pollution in the Mexican population related to the Madin dam, State of Mexico. Among the results, it was observed that the areas of Gustavo A. Madero and Naucalpan de Juarez have higher levels of pollutants (PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO) than those observed in the area of Atizapan de Zaragoza (Nuevo Madin). Regarding the drinking water samples, it was observed that the highest levels of metals are found in the drinking water intakes of Naucalpan de Juarez for Fe, Al, and total Cr. On the other hand, it was obtained that the ALP and LDH enzymes presented significant differences in the research subjects from Nuevo Madín with respect to the subjects from Naucalpan and Gustavo A. Madero. LPX levels showed a significant difference between the different study groups, being much higher in the subjects from Naucalpan.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of the Environment (SEDEMA 2022), the sector that contributes with the highest emission of air pollutants (ozone precursors and particulate matter) is transportation, contributing 40% of PM10, 43% of PM2.5, 86% of NO2, and 22% of CO. Other important sectors related to the above are industry, urban development, and livestock and agricultural activities. Local pollutant sources in Mexico City contribute about one third of the emissions generated in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico.\n\nWith respect to surface water pollution in Mexico, the main sources have been identified as those related to agricultural practices, where agrochemicals are used that can be washed into water bodies by rain and soil erosion; as well as municipal wastewater, which is created from untreated domestic and public waste, in addition to industrial discharges, which are generated by the activities of extraction and transformation of natural resources that at the end of the whole process are used as consumer goods. These discharges may contain synthetic organic substances or metals that do not degrade easily under natural conditions (Ibarrarán Viniegra et al. 2017), leading to the contamination of various water bodies, including aquifers. This could explain the presence of metals in the drinking water received by the urban reference group and the Nuevo Madín group. In particular, the present research focused on metals because the presence of these contaminants in reservoirs that provide water to populations is often a problem, such is the case of the Madín Dam, since water potabilization processes do not eliminate them, leading to a risk to human health (Canpolat et al. 2020).\n\nThere are different studies that have shown that contaminants are capable of causing liver dysfunction due to the central role played by this organ in the metabolism of xenobiotics (Lawton et al. 1985; Emmett et al. 1988; Kumar et al. 2014). Classical biochemical tests commonly used in clinical medicine involve the measurement of a number of serum enzymes (ALP, ALT, AST, and LDH) that together indicate the pathophysiological status of the liver (Kumar et al. 2014). We observed that ALP activity increased significantly in the New Madin group with respect to the other groups studied, as did LDH; however, the other two enzymes (AST and ALT) evaluated did not show significant changes between the groups. ALP is mainly produced in the liver and is responsible for the dephosphorylation process. It is distributed throughout the body, being in higher concentration in the kidney, bones and liver, when elevated plasma levels are present it is usually indicative of bile duct obstruction or other liver diseases (Kumar et al. 2014). In recent years, this enzyme has also been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (Nannipieri et al. 2005; Haarhaus et al. 2017).\n\nIn addition, following exposure to environmental pollutants, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and arsenic, the levels of this enzyme are increased in plasma (Islam et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2014). In the case of the Nuevo Madín group, it was found that 17% of the subjects presented abnormal ALP values; however, when estimating the risk of presenting alterations in the normal levels of the enzyme considering as a control group the subjects coming from the area identified as Gustavo A. Madero, no increase in the risk was observed. On the other hand, in LDH there was an increase in risk, 21.13 times more in comparison with the subjects from the Gustavo A. Madero group, since this group presented higher values than the rest of the areas studied. LDH is an enzyme found in a wide variety of tissues; an increase in blood levels of this enzyme is usually indicative of tissue lesions in the heart, kidney, or liver, as well as in a wide variety of cancers (Wu et al. 2021). In addition, it has been proposed as a useful biomarker for early prognosis of organ or tissue damage in people chronically exposed to metals in water and environmental pollutants (Karim et al. 2010; Saeed 2017; Pejhan et al. 2019). On the other hand, there are also reports of changes in this type of enzymatic biomarkers in populations exposed to various environmental pollutants through air, water, or food consumption. Multiple chemical substances have been identified, including metals, hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, particulate matter, and gases such as NOx (Yorita Christensen et al. 2013).\n\nAlthough the underlying physiological mechanisms that explain the positive association between elevated level of enzymes such as ALP and LDH with various pollutants remain unclear, oxidative stress offers a plausible process for understanding this relationship. Oxidative stress is caused by a disturbance in the balance between ROS production and antioxidant defenses (Sies 2015). There is evidence that various pathophysiological processes, habits and lifestyle can trigger an increase in ROS, but also environmental pollutants can cause oxidative deterioration in organisms (Aslan et al. 1997; Carraro et al. 2018; Rafiee et al. 2021). The elevation of ROS production leads to an increase in the level of lipid peroxidation; during this process, polyunsaturated fatty acids with double bonds react with ROS, particularly the hydroxyl radical (HO −) and the reactive nitrogen species peroxynitrite (ONOO −), through a chain reaction mechanism. This allows the formation of hydroperoxides that degrade to low molecular weight products, including MDA (Ayala et al. 2014; Morachis-Valdez et al. 2015). In the present study, it could be seen that MDA levels in the subjects from Nuevo Madín and Naucalpan de Juárez presented much higher levels than in the group from Gustavo A. Madero, the risk was significant, particularly for the people from Naucalpan de Juárez. MDA accumulation has been extensively investigated and implicated in many toxic tissue injuries and pathological processes (Ayala et al. 2014). This biomarker presented a correlation between pollutants found in air and water, in particular SO2 and the metals Fe, Cr, and Al. Ambient air is a complex of various individual pollutants that are either free radicals, such as NO2, or have the ability to drive the free radical reaction, such as O3 and particulate matter (Jung et al. 2013). In the case of SO2, its inhalation reduces the activity of antioxidant enzymes and leads to lipid peroxidation that can damage the brain (Meng 2003). SO2 pollution is caused by the combustion of fossil fuels, including sulfur, and by pollutants resulting from warming and released from smokestacks (Saygin et al. 2017). The three groups studied are located in the northeastern region of the MCMA, which is characterized by regular SO2 levels (26 to 110 ppb), with a tendency to present a good category (> 25 ppb), so it has been identified as an area with higher levels of this type of pollutants than in the rest of the Valley of Mexico (Ramos 2019). It is known that exposure to SO2 is associated with a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing and shortness of breath, so it affects the quality of life of populations, mainly in children (Nascimento et al. 2020). While there are a number of pollutants present in daily life to which people are exposed, the conditions under which the study was conducted (during the COVID-19 pandemic), contributed to participating subjects remaining in their homes 24 h a day, reducing exposure to other substances and leaving a clear geospatial residential exposure of the groups studied. The relationship between air pollutant levels with some effect on human health has been demonstrated in several studies. For example, two prospective cohort studies in Taiwan and Europe found generally positive associations between geospatial residential exposure to PM and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and liver cancer risk (Pan et al. 2016; Pedersen et al. 2017).\n\nOn the other hand, metals such as Fe, Al, and Cr can generate oxidative stress; iron is essential for many cellular functions; however, it also has the capacity to gain and lose electrons. This characteristic allows it to participate in reactions that can generate free radicals (RL), producing the OH– radical through the Fenton reaction (Graf et al. 1984); this ROS is reactive and can cause damage to lipids as mentioned above. In the case of Al, the most abundant metal in the earth’s crust; its presence in drinking water is mainly due to water treatment processes, since it is used as a flocculant. Its ability to generate oxidative stress has been widely documented it is known that within its mechanisms is its ability to produce damage in mitochondria, to form colloidal aluminum and bind to pro-oxidant metals (Fe or Cu) and, therefore, promote oxidative events based on pro-oxidant metals, as well as inhibition of the activity of antioxidant enzymes (Kumar et al. 2009; García-Medina et al. 2010; Kumar and Gill 2014). In the case of chromium, two valence states occur in nature (haxavalent chromium and trivalent chromium). Cr (IV) is commonly used in industrial processes such as chromium plating, welding, painting, metal finishing, steel manufacturing, alloying’, and cast iron. Also, it has been identified as a known mutagen and carcinogen, its mechanism by which it exerts its toxic effect is not yet well established, but it has been reported to be capable of inducing oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell death, and modification in gene expression in proteins associated with the process of apoptosis (Bagchi et al. 2002; Xu et al. 2018). In contrast, chromium (III) is essential for proper insulin function and is necessary for normal protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, and is recognized as a dietary supplement (Bagchi et al. 2002). Human exposure to this metal is low in drinking water (0.2 to 2 μg Cr (VI)/L), according to the Mexican Official Standard PROY-NOM-127-SSA1-2017 should not exceed 0.05 mg/L total chromium (Secretaría de Salud 2019). The levels presented of metals in drinking water varied, depending on the system that provides drinking water to the three areas studied, noting that the concentrations of metals were lower in the samples from Nuevo Madín, followed by the group from Gustavo A. Madero and finally, the highest levels were found Naucalpan de Juárez, exceeding the limits of the Mexican standard for Fe and Pb (Secretaría de Salud 2019).\n\nFor this study, subjects from Gustavo A. Madero were considered as a control group since they are an urban population, just like the subjects residing in Nuevo Madín and Naucalpan de Juárez and are exposed to a similar level of environmental contaminants, particularly with Naucalpan de Juárez, but receive water from different systems. Such is the case of the subjects of Nuevo Madín, which belong to the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, where 75% of the potable water supply comes from three external sources, which are operated by the Comisión de Agua del Estado de México, these are the Cutzamala macrocircuit, the Sistema Barrientos aqueduct, and the Sistema Madín aqueduct. The remaining 25% of the supply comes from 33 deep drinking water wells located in different areas of the municipality; in the case of the Nuevo Madín neighborhood, this receives water mainly from wells (Farrell Baril 2008). With respect to the municipality of Naucalpan de Juárez, of the 3,150 L of water per second supplied, only 28.0% comes from its own sources (40 deep wells), the rest is supplied from sources outside the territory, mainly from the Lerma-Cutzamala System which provides about 66.6% and finally from the Madín Dam which contributes 5.4% (SEDUV 2007). The neighborhoods sampled in this study that belong to this municipality receive drinking water from the Cutzamala System and the Madín Water Treatment Plant. The Cutzamala System is one of the largest drinking water supply systems in the world. It provides 17% of the supply for all uses in the Mexico Valley Basin, calculated at 88 m3/s, which is complemented by the Lerma System (5%), groundwater extraction (68%), rivers and springs (3%) and water reuse (7%). It supplies 11 delegations of Mexico City and 11 municipalities of the State of Mexico and is composed of seven diversion and storage dams, six pumping stations, and a water treatment plant that uses conventional treatment (CONAGUA 2018). Based on the concentrations quantified in the different samples, it can be appreciated that the contamination of the Madín reservoir contributes to the quality of drinking water, and the presence of metals such as Pb, Fe, and Al, the latter two have been reported in several points of the reservoir and usually exceed the maximum allowable limits for the protection of aquatic life (González-González et al. 2014; Pérez-Coyotl et al. 2019).\n\nFinally, it was observed that for Nuevo Madín, the correlation with the levels of contaminants present in the air and water was low; however, an increase in the frequency of subjects with altered values of ALP and LDH enzymes, as well as LPX, was observed. Unlike the other groups studied, the inhabitants of this area usually have direct contact with the reservoir, because some of them consume the carp that inhabit the water body (57%) or animals that drink water from the dam (6%). For the consumption of carp from this water body, it was found that there is a 2.6 times greater risk of presenting an alteration in the ALP levels when consuming carp from the reservoir. It is known that aquatic organisms, such as common carp, can bioconcentrate contaminants and be a source of exposure for human populations implying a potential risk for consumers, particularly with metals (Yi et al. 2017). In this sense, Morachis-Valdez et al. (2015) found that the fish present in this reservoir contained high concentrations of metals such as Fe and Al, as well as some drugs found in the different points of the reservoir, so consuming fish coming from this water body may be an important factor in the modification of the enzyme. In addition, the organisms sampled during the study presented high levels of these two metals, thus confirming what was reported by Morachis-Valdez et al. (2015). Similarly, in LDH and LPX, where a risk of 5.46 and 1.97, respectively, was found.\n\nThere is evidence from previous studies on liver toxicity and oxidative stress of chemicals that showed an association with the biomarkers evaluated. Among environmental pollutants such as SO2, an increase in MDA levels of 100% has been found after an eight-week exposure to 15 ppm SO2 in rat (Zhang et al. 2006), while metals such as Al have been shown to cause significant increases in blood AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, and bilirubin levels, as well as an increase in LPX in rat liver tissue exposed to 30 mg/kg aluminum chloride for 21 days (Al-Kahtani et al. 2020). In the case of chromium, it has been reported that chromium caused a perturbation in biochemical parameters, altering the levels of blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, ALP, ALT, AST, and LDH, as well as an increase in oxidative stress in male rats exposed for 30 days to 15 mg/kg Cr (Saidi et al. 2020). In rats treated with iron (8.3 mg/L FeSO4 for 60 days), significant increases in MDA and nitric oxide (NO) levels in the liver have been demonstrated (Badria et al. 2015).\n\nIdentifying environmental exposures that negatively affect health is an important public health problem (Yorita Christensen et al. 2013); this pilot study was proposed to explore whether the inhabitants related to the Madin dam presented any changes in biomarkers of early damage, before the onset of a disease, due to the environmental problems that have been evidenced in the area. However, being a population that is located north of the metropolitan area of Mexico City, with reports in recent years of high levels of air pollution (Ramos 2019), the contaminants present in the air could not be ruled out. Exposure to multiple environmental chemicals and classes of substances complicates understanding the biological processes that these mixtures trigger, as well as the consequences on human health (Yorita Christensen et al. 2013); however, the results found are a start to continue investigating and at the same time taking measures to avoid more serious consequences on the health of the inhabitants.\n\nTo improve the understanding of the role of pollutants on the effects on human health in order to make important changes and reduce the probability of the occurrence of pollution-related diseases, citizens as well as authorities could follow the following suggestions: establish personal education programs regarding environmental pollution issues. Encourage reasoning about environmental concerns in the work and home environment by asking certain questions (Chance 2001), for example: Is waste production minimized? Is waste disposed of properly? Is plastic separated from materials to be incinerated? Are all appropriate materials recycled? Encourage the use of public transportation, as well as the substitution of less polluting vehicles, in addition to restricting traffic, prohibiting the circulation of a private vehicle for one day a week, making use of renewable energies, improving wastewater treatment, reducing the use of plastic, oils and batteries, and generating “green” spaces in the city. Promote healthy lifestyle habits and improving diet, as well as reducing alcohol and tobacco consumption, encouraging regular and moderate exercise, and considering the biomonitoring of some substances periodically.\n\nThere are some limitations to this study. Because it is a cross-sectional study, there is no way to evaluate the evolution of the response with the temporality of exposure, on the other hand, the study was performed during the quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, factors such as diet, alcohol consumption, smoking, and exercise were modified in the population and could affect some of the responses evaluated; however, we adjusted for several important covariates in our analyses. The sample was taken at the home of the individuals, so the collection and transport of the samples to the laboratories for analysis could compromise the sample, although measures were taken to preserve and conserve them, such as temperature control during transport."
