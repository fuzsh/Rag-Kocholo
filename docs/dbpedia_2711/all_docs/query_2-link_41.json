        "text": "12 Van Houten Street\n\nOur house was a small house as we look at houses today, but in those days growing up it seemed quite sufficient for our family. The front of the house faced Van Houten Street and the lot ran back to Canal Street. It had sort of a sub-basement where the kitchen was located as well as the dining-room. There was a hall that led from the kitchen to the upstairs rooms. In the dining-room there was another entrance toward the front of the house that also led upstairs. In later years, when we got sewers, we put in an inside toilet in the hall, but no bath. Upstairs there were two bedrooms and a parlor. The bedrooms were occupied by my parents and the other room by my two sisters, Ann and Mary.\n\nAnother big room took up most of the attic with a small hallway that housed a closet. This is where the boys slept; my older brother Mike in one bed and Andy and I shared the other. The attic had a sloping ceiling. That's the side Andy slept on generally because he was smaller and didn't bump his head on the ceiling.\n\nThere was a front entrance to the house by way of a small porch to the upstairs rooms and another entrance to the hall in the basement. There was also an entrance on the east side by way of some steps and a small porch. In the back there was an entrance to the kitchen.\n\nIn the back of the lot there was a fairly large shed which housed the wood and coal, as well as such sundry items as our barrel of sauerkraut in the winter and various other articles.\n\nGrowing up we all had various chores to do daily. One job that I dreaded was cleaning the windows on the downstairs windows in the dining-room. They had these small 8 by 10 panes of glass and the only time I didn't have to do it was in the very cold weather, or when it rained. How I hated that job!--and no matter how much I tried to get the corners cleaned, it was very rarely that it satisfied my mother.\n\nAnother job I detested was cleaning the grass from between the bricks in our front and side sidewalks. Somehow or other the grass would always come up between the bricks and I had to take out the grass and apparently I wasn't getting the roots because within the next few days the grass came back up again.\n\nIn the summertime my job after supper was to fill three washtubs with water. We didn't own a hose: nobody in our neighborhood had such a thing. I had to carry pails full of water from the kitchen sink, up two or three steps and out to the garden where the tubs were placed in various sections of the garden. The watering of the flowers and vegetables was generally done by my mother and father, geneÂ­ rally y mother who had great pride in her garden. In fact, she had one of the nicest flower gardens in the area, which contained many varieties of flowers, from the spring till the fall. My mother boasted that she didn't buy any seeds. She would save the seeds from her best flowers and vegetables for the next year. Oftentimes on her way to church or visiting someone, she would see a flower she didn't have and she would go and knock on the door of that particular person and ask for a slip or some seeds in the fall of the year when the flowers went to seed.\n\nThe Haverstraw Garden Club, or whatever the name was, gave a prize for the best garden in the village, and my mother for two years straight won the first prize, which was a $5.00 gold piece. I remember those two gold pieces very well. I know there were times when we could have used that money, for there were many lean years when my father wasn't working, but she would never part with them. I have often wondered since she passed on whatever happened to them or what she used them for.\n\nPerhaps I should describe the interior of the house. As you entered the house in the kitchen to the left was a coal and wood burning range or kitchen stove. As I recall, it was an \"Acorn\" brand. To the right of the door near the east wall was a sink and between the sink and the kitchen door was a kitchen table and chairs. There was a door to the hall, which later became our bathroom, and in the middle of the room there was another door leading to the diningÂ­ room.\n\nI recall the kitchen being lit by two kerosene lamps. The dining-room contained our dining-room table and chairs and a pot-belly stove. Upstairs was the parlor which housed a few chairs and another parlor stove. One of the chairs was what they called in those days a Morris chair, and the other chair was similar to it but that one had rockers on it. I remember writing to the Larkin Company in Buffalo when we got, I believe, the rocking chair, which we obtained after acquiring a certain number of trading stamps similar to the green stamps that were dispensed by some stores and gas stations a few years ago. The room was lit by a nice rose decorated kerosene parlor lamp. We also had one-somewhat similar for the diningÂ­ room.\n\nUpstairs in the attic was a fairly large closet and in the attic room there were two beds, one on the south side and the other on the north. In between I recall a couple of storage trunks and some bureaus. The two bedrooms on the second\" floor had a double bed each and some bureaus. I believe there was a closet in each room also.\n\nThere was no central heat in the house, and in the wintertime the boys undressed in the parlor, put on our pajamas and, after getting our backsides warm, ran up the stairs and jumped into bed under the big featherbed covers (perini). It didn't take long to get snug and warm.\n\nAnother job of mine was to keep the wood box under the back porch filled with wood from the shed, and in the wintertime to bring two scuttles of coal into the house. During the day we would generally use wood for the three stoves, but at night coal was shoveled on the fire, the dampers closed after the cog! gas burned off, and bahkeu for the night. In the morning the stove would be shaken down, the dampers opened, and in a few minutes the stoves would warm up.\n\nSaturday night was bath night. One of the washtubs would be filled with water and we would undress and bathe in the kitchen. In the winter, of course, the water was heated. While we were bathing, the other members of the family would be in the dining-room awaiting their turn.\n\nI remember my mother on wash day, heating the water on a kitchen stove, then dumping it into a washtub and scrubbing the clothes on one of those old-fashioned washÂ­ boards. Why her knuckles weren't skinned off I'll never know. When she finished the wash, my job was to dump the water in the garden, as this was good for the soil: of course, in the summer time on some of the plants. I used to watch the worms come up, apparently not appreciating the soapy water.\n\nLooking back, it seems there were always clothes on the line, since my father worked on the brickyard in those days and the clothes were red from the red paint they put in the bricks.\n\nShe also had another tub of cold water which was used to rinse the clothes.\n\nIn the wintertime, he clothes were brought in off the line and thawed out in the kitchen. I can recall standing some of the frozen clothes up all by themselves. It would certainly chill the kitchen when you brought them in. We didn't get any sort of washing machine until we moved to Sharp Street. I can't recall that we ever had a wringer, mostly the clothes were wrung out by hand.\n\nOnce in a while the clothes-line would break and all hell would break loose, first that the clothes-line should have been replaced, etc.\n\nThe day after the wash was done, which was usually Monday unless it rained, was ironing day, and again the old stove would have two or three old irons which my mother would use, putting one back on the stove when it was getting cold and picking up another hot one.\n\nSpeaking about the frozen clothes, I'll never forget one fright I got one night. I had gone to a basketball game or party, I don't recall which, but we were coming home when the car that Biscuit Burton was driving had battery trouble. The lights would go out and we would lose power. I remember we all had to get out and push the car to the hill on Route 202 in Mt. Ivy. Then we coasted down the hill all the way to Mt. Repose Cemetery traffic light, where it stalled for good. We walked home, and as I came in the front gate and walked to the rear, there were clothes on the line and a full moon lighted up the back yard. There was a little breeze blowing, so when I looked up the clothes were waving and it gave the appearance of a man sawing a woman's head off. As if that wasn't enough, I caught hell because I was out after 12.\n\n(The bracketed sect1on is on a separate, unnumbered page, at the bottom of which is written, Insert in proper place. This seemed as good a place as any.)"
