        "text": "One of many blast furnaces in this iron ore-rich region, Clove Furnace opened in 1854, producing some 5,000 tons of iron by the following year—and 101,000 tons in the decade between 1871 and 1881. Iron produced here was used for the manufacture of stoves and other hardware. The furnace was shut down in 1885 and now serves as headquarters of the Orange County Historical Society. The restored stack, spillway, and other buildings provide a rare glimpse into an important 19th century industry in the Hudson River Valley, while the adjacent museum explains the iron-making process and offers displays about other aspects of Orange County history. Hiking trails in Harriman State Park pass many of the mines that supplied this and other furnaces.\n\nAmenities: Passport Stamp, Family Friendly, Greenway Trail Access, Public Transportation, Restrooms"
