By her getting the word out that the British soldiers were coming, everyone was able to get ready to fight them and they were not taken by surprise.\n\nHow can Sybil Ludington be compared with Paul Revere?\n\nYou might have heard of the famous poem, that lyrically shares about the midnight ride of that patriot, who vigorously rode his horse to let the soldiers know about the approaching British. Similarly, Sybil did the same, but she did it at the age of 16, and she rode more than twice the distance that Revere did. She road 40 miles on the horse.\n\nWhere is the Sybil Ludington Statue located? Is it open to the public?\n\nThe Sybil Ludington Statue is located at 15 Gleneida Ave, Carmel Hamlet, NY 10512, and supposedly is open to the public 24 hours a day. Have you been to see it already?\n\nHow can an organization go about getting one of those blue and yellow historical markers for their spot in New York State?\n\nDo you like visiting historical markers?
