        "text": "A Mill Dam Falls (LaChute River)\n\nThere are several dams on the LaChute River in the hamlet of Ticonderoga as it travels from Lake George to Lake Champaign. They are lettered from A through D. This one is at the outlet of Lake Gorge to the south. The dam appears to be 20 ft high with a natural cascade over large boulders just below it. Park on Alexandria RD, just south of the dam and walk the footpath. 1 man-made dam and waterfall – Map\n\nAdirondack Mountain Reserve\n\nThe ADR is a 7,000 acre private wildlife reserve owned by the Ausable Club. An easement allows for hikers to access most of the property, with some restrictions (such as no pets). The reserve contains the Upper & Lower Ausable Lakes and the upper reaches of the East Branch Ausable River. There are numerous notable waterfalls in this area, and countless small unnamed and unmapped falls. Artists Falls, Beaver Meadows Falls, Gill Brook Steps, Gill Brook Flume, Fairy Ladder Falls, Pyramid Falls, Rainbow Falls, Wedge Brook Cascades, and Wedge Brook Falls are all listed below. Multiple waterfalls – DEC Trail Map\n\nAlice Falls\n\nAccess is through Clinton County.\n\nAllen Falls\n\nA mountain runoff cascade on Allen Brook. It’s a few hundred feet up Allen Mountain from Skylight Brook. It can be seen from the last stretch of the Allen Mountain Trail.

They are lettered from A through D This one is just north of A Mill. There is an L-shaped dam up top, but since it is long since decommissioned, water often doesn’t flow over the top, rather the sides where there are open spillways. From there it falls gradually about 15 ft over the upper section, then a more dramatic drop 10ft downstream, and then about 50 ft further downstream is a very small cascade, almost rapids. Access is from a parking area off of Lord Howe St. 1 man-made dam and 3 waterfalls – Map\n\nBeaver Meadows Falls (Adirondack Mountain Preserve)\n\nA beautiful 60 ft cascade falls on a tributary to the East Branch of the Ausable River within the Adirondack Mountain Reserve Conservation Easement Tract. It can be found on the West River Trail, at the north end of the marsh downstream from Lower Ausable Lake. Beaver Meadow Trail will also get you there. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nBeede Brook Falls\n\nA steep gully in Keene Valley. A nearby “Dipper Pond” may be why it’s often called Dipper Brook, but GIS info shows this is the source of Beede Brook, not a tributary. About a half mile up the gully from NY-73 is a roughly 30 ft high bridal-veil-style falls that cuts through a steep cliff. There are a few additional, but small waterfalls to encounter downstream. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nBeer Walls Falls\n\nA 150 ft cascade down a sheer cliff in the Keene Valley, just west of Chapel Pond. The cliffs here often used by both rock and ice climbers. It’s accessible from NY-73 where a trailhead with a wooden footbridge takes you westward into the woods.

There are several waterfalls along Gill Brook. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nGill Brook Steps (Adirondack Mountain Reserve)\n\nVery small and uneven drops along Gill Brook in the Adirondack Mountain Reserve Conservation Easement Tract. It’s not much to look at, but they are one of many stops along Gill Brook one can easily see. They are located near the north end of the Gill Brook Trail by Lake Rd (private road, foot traffic only). Several very small drops – Map\n\nHague Brook Falls\n\nA 15 ft high and a 10 ft high roadside falls on Hague Brook near Hague. 2 waterfalls – Map\n\nHanging Spear Falls\n\nA beautiful 80 ft high, horsetail falls and pool on the Opalescent River near Calamity Mtn.

Multiple falls – Map\n\nHoisington Brook Cascade\n\nA small (6 ft) cascade under a footbridge in Lee Park in the hamlet of Westport. This park is also a great place to access Lake Champlain. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nHorseshoe Falls (Ausable Chasm)\n\nSee Ausable Chasm.\n\nHulls Falls\n\nTwo drops (totaling about 20 ft high) falls on the East Branch of the Ausable River, south of Keene. The lower can be seen from the Hulls Falls Rd (13A) bridge, the drop that’s under the bridge can be seen via short scramble below. 2 waterfalls – Map\n\nIndian Falls\n\nA 25 ft high sloping falls on Marcy brook in the town of Keene, that overlooks the MacIntyre Mountain Range and is a popular rest stop for hikers on their way to Mt Marcy; NY’s highest peak. Either the Indian Falls/Lake Arnold Crossover Trail or the Van Hoevenberg/Indian Falls Trail will get you there. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nJay Falls\n\nThe East Branch of the Ausable River drops roughly 8-10 feet down this rock outcropping in the village of Jay. While the falls itself isn’t much, just upstream is a large wooden covered bridge, making this a very picturesque scene. Parking is available on both sides of the bridge and there’s a small gravel parking area and path downstream from the falls that leads to the the rock outcropping and nice views. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nKnob Lock Mountain Falls\n\nTwo large cascades along this tributary to The Branch, in the Green Mountain Wilderness area. The hike to see them would involve scaling about halfway up Knob Lock (about 600 ft ascent max). Start from the North Trail trailhead off of NY-9N and head south. Keep and eye out for a western trail offshoot that heads to this creek. Best in early spring. 2 waterfalls – Map\n\nLee Park (Westport)\n\nSee Hoisington Brook Cascade.\n\nLake Arnold Outlet Falls\n\n3 cascades can be found on this small outlet from an equally small lake tucked away in the valley east of Mt Colden.

It’s where 3 trails meet and offers a breathtaking view of the lake. 1 man-made dam – Map\n\nLinsey Falls\n\nA stretch of very mild rapids on the Schroon River in the town of North Hudson. The USGS has this listed as “Falls,” but it’s very far from that. It’s barely noticeable as a rapids. It’s more of a “babbling brook” section of the river. I’m only listing it for informational purposes. Access is questionable. Rapids – Map\n\nLower Ausable Lake Dam (Adirondack Mountain Reserve)\n\nA 4 ft dam at the north end of the Lower Ausable Lake within the Adirondack Mountain Reserve Conservation Easement Tract. It can be seen on the way to Rainbow Falls. 1 man-made dam – Map\n\nMacIntyre Brook Falls\n\nThe journey along the Algonquin Peak Trail to Wright Peak in the Town of North Elba will lead you to this 15 ft cascade on MacIntyre Brook. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nMill Brook Falls (Port Henry)\n\nMill Brook creates several cascades as it makes it’s final descent towards Lake Champlain in the hamlet of Port Henry.

More info is needed. The Northville-Placid Trail runs along the northern bank of the river. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nMink Falls\n\nSeveral waterfalls (possibly 3) on the Nate Pond Brook as it becomes the outlet from Mink Pond in the town of Minerva. The gradient increases drastically as the outlet approaches the Hudson River just west of Virgin Falls. The first of these falls is often a quick stop for Hudson River rafting tours. I know of no other way to access the falls on foot. At least 1 waterfall – Map\n\nMonument Falls\n\nA 6 ft high cascade on the Ausable River, near Lake Placid and High Falls Gorge. It’s named for nearby monuments erected to commemorate the state’s preserve system. They are located just a few hundred ft south at the parking area. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nMossy Cascade\n\nA 40 ft high cascade in Mossy Cascade Brook, a tributary to East Branch of the Ausable River, North of St. Huberts. Another 10 ft cascade is found further downstream.

Multiple falls – Map\n\nNew Russia Falls\n\nA small (5 ft) cascade (composed of 2 distinct drops) on the Boquet River in the hamlet of New Russia. It’s on private property so this one may only be for paddlers. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nNichols Brook Tributary Falls\n\nSee Black Mountain Chute.\n\nOlmstedville Dam\n\nA 5 ft tall manmade dam on Minerva Stream on the west side of the hamlet of Olmstedville in the town of Minerva. There’s parking off of A P Morse Hwy on both sides of the bridge and a small park along the stream. 1 man-made dam – Map\n\nOpalescent Falls\n\nA 15 ft cascade on the Opalescent River in the town of Newcomb, just upstream from Hanging Spear Falls. The East River Trail runs along the Opalescent and passes quite a few waterfalls along the way. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nOpalescent Falls (Upper)\n\nThis one is tough to see, but with the other falls present along this trail, it’s worth a shot. This is located between Opalescent Falls and Hanging Spear Falls (both on the East River Trail). You can spot it through the trees. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nOpalescent Flume\n\nThis steep flume falls inspired the classic painting The Flume of the Opalescent by Alexander Helwig Wyant. It’s found on the section of the Opalescent that flows northwest through the mountains south of Mt Colden towards Lake Colden. It’s a very narrow falls that flows through a steep fissure in the rock, estimated at 20-30 ft high, although some of it is obscured from view. There is a small cascade just downstream. It’s accessible from the Mount Marcy Trail. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nOrd Falls\n\nA set of class II rapids on the Hudson River south of Newcomb. Access may be for paddlers only. Rapids – Map\n\nOutlet Dam Falls (La Chute)\n\nSee A Mill Dam (La Chute). Unknown number of waterfalls – Map\n\nParadise Alley\n\nA few small cascades on Hewitt Pond Brook, just west of Hayes Mountain in the town of Minerva. Multiple waterfalls – Map\n\nPhelps Falls\n\nA multitiered cascade (estimated 6 ft high) on Phelps Brook northeast of Keene Valley. This waterfall is named after Orson “Old Mountain” Phelps (1817-1905), an Adirondack pioneer guide who named many of the high peaks. The falls appears to be on private property, but it’s possible it can be spotted form the Barret Road side. 1 Waterfall – Map\n\nPyramid Falls (Adirondack Mountain Reserve)\n\nPyramid Creek, a tributary to the East Branch of the Ausable River, has a 20 and 15 ft drop at a bend in the creek. The falls fan out from a notch above the bulbous cliff-face, forming a pyramid shape. After a pool at the bottom, the water drops again in a narrow crevice. This is one to see in early spring or after heavy rain. It’s accessed from the loop that takes you to Cathedral Rocks from the West River Trail. 2 waterfalls – Map\n\nRainbow Falls (Adirondack Mountain Reserve)\n\nA spectacular 150 ft cascade on Cascade Brook, a tributary to the East Branch of the Ausable River at Lower Ausable Lake. The falls is in a deep and secluded gorge in the Adirondack Mountain Reserve Conservation Easement Tract, which it often fills with mist. The A. W. Weld Trail, which can be picked up at the Lower Ausable Lake Dam, leads to the Rainbow Falls Trail. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nRainbow Falls (Ausable Chasm)\n\nSee Ausable Chasm.\n\nRices Falls\n\nA series of cascades (totaling about 20-25 ft in height) on The Branch just west of the hamlet of Elizabethtown. There’s a roadside parking area off of NY-9N and a pathway that leads down the the stream. Multiple waterfalls – Map\n\nRichards Dam\n\nAn old mill dam on the LaChute River in Ticonderoga. The mill sits atop a sloping slab of bedrock, thus the dam’s height varies along it’s length. In High flow, more water spills over onto this stone. On the north end is an old mill wheelhouse. There’s a parking area off of Adirondack Park. 1man-made dam – Map\n\nRoaring Brook Falls\n\nA tall and narrow falls that drops nearly 300 ft in two segments. The flow is low and it looks best in spring or after heavy rain. It’s located southeast of Saint Huberts in the Giant Mountain Wilderness Area. A trail leads from a parking area just west on NY-73. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nRocky Falls\n\nA small 6 ft falls over a massive rock outcropping on the Indian Pass Brook near Heart Lake in the town of North Elba. The Heart Lake Parking lot is the best place to start. Take the Indian Pass trail to get to an offshoot to the falls. 1 waterfall – Map\n\nRussell Falls\n\nA small falls and remands of a power dam and plant on the East Branch of the Ausable River, adjacent to the Ausable Club Building. It’s partly on private property and off limits. 1 waterfall and man-made dam – Map\n\nSchroon Falls\n\nA tiny drop on the Schroon River in the middle of Schroon Falls, NY. At one time there was a stone mill dam here. While there are some ruins left of the dam, all that’s left is this tiny drop, nothing I would consider a “true waterfall.” Nonetheless, hopefully I saved you some time hunting for it. 1 small ledge (barely a waterfall) – Map\n\nSplit Rock Falls\n\nA popular and picturesque multitiered cascade over a beautifully jagged rock that tends to split the first drop into two. They rejoin at a pool at in the middle and then fall a second time as a single cascade. Further downstream a rock outcropping creates another cascade of about 10 ft high. Located on the Bouquet River in the southwest corner of the town of Elizabeth town. A parking area is on the shoulder of US-9. 2 waterfalls – Map\n\nStag Brook Falls\n\nAt least 1 sizable waterfall on this mountainside stream at the Whiteface Mountain Ski Resort. The stream is small, so it’s best to visit in early spring when there’s plenty of water. Park in the main lot and head over the bridge, past the main lodge (on your left) and then the Edu center (on your right). Look for a marker denoting the trailhead. The main falls, which is a 30 ft high horsetail cascade comes right after the start of the trail. There are plentiful smaller cascade upstream, but I’m not entirely sure of they are accessible. Multiple waterfalls – Map\n\nStaircase Falls\n\n4 drops lined up on Putnam Creek near Crown Point Center in the town of Crown Point. They vary in height from 3 ft to one over 15 ft high. They seem to be on posted land, so seeing them all is a matter of getting on the right road for the best vantage point. There’s a small pull-off on Middle Rd next to the bridge that leads to a pathway to one of the falls. Multiple waterfalls – Map\n\nUnderwood Falls\n\nNot an official name. See Unnamed Falls (Bouquet River near Split Rock).\n\nUnnamed Falls (Ausable River in the Adirondack Mountain Preserve)\n\nWhile there are many unnamed falls on the Ausable in the Adirondack Mountain Preserve, this one stands out. At over 20 ft high, it pours out of an isolated bend in a deep section of the gorge.
