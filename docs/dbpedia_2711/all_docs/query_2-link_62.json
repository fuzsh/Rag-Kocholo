Governments act on the commercial and industrial development of a nation no less than upon its public and private customs. They are the head of the social body. In them originate all great plans of usefulness to the community. To direct that community into the path of improve­ ment, is their great mission and duty. Of all the modes of action which governments possess, there is none more energetic than tariffs. In proportion as they elevate or depress this powerful lever, they may create, sustain, and develop, or leave inactive, arrest in its course, or even destroy national enterprise, the source of public prosperity. It was with the aid of tariffs that Colbert laid the foundation of the manufacturing industry of France ; by them Napoleon secured to her the whole of Europe for a m arket; and by them recent legislation has restricted this market to our own frontiers. While, with a view to favor the industry of France, we have thought it necessary to enclose it within narrow limits, a neighboring nation, with * The following article is translated from the “ Bulletin of the Industrial Society of Mulhouse”—“ Le Bulletin de La Societe Industrielle de Mnlhouse”—a Magazine of the highest repute among the manufacturers of both France and England.

Occurring to the translator that others might feel an interest in it, he forwarded the manuscript to us for publication in the Merchants’ Magazine.

M e r c h a n t s ’ M a g a z in e .] 20 The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. the same end in view, adopts a course widely different. Two hundred years ago, her public men projected a plan, as gigantic as any ever con­ ceived by the human mind—that of securing to a little island, in the North of Europe, destitute of natural advantages, the exclusive privilege of supply­ ing the rest of the world with manufactured articles of the first necessity, for the wants of life. Since then, without relaxation, every possible effort has been made to attain this result. In vain have opposing parties succeeded each other in power. The same spirit has animated them all. Diplo­ macy, violence, wars, alliances, treaties of peace, all have tended to this single end—the improvement of the productions of the country; until what had seemed at first but a dream, is at length realized. In England and France, the governments have started from two points directly opposed. In England, the principle is laid down, that “ we must secure to the laborer his raw material at the least possible price, in order that he may afford, at the lowest possible price, the article which he pro­ duces —in France, that “ the laborer shall pay well for the raw material which he uses, but the home market shall be reserved for his products exclusively.” Which is the most reasonable of these two systems of economy, it is not our purpose now to discuss. There is no doubt that the respective conditions of the two countries are very different, and it will be easily ad­ mitted that each of these two principles has been appropriate to the epochs and the circumstances in which they have been applied. What cannot be~ denied is, that the system adopted by Great Britain has elevated that country to the high industrial position which constitutes the foundation of her pre­ sent wealth and power. This system she has lately extended, almost to its extreme limits. Her policy herein is consistent; namely, to persevere in the course which has been, thus far, successful. Since 1844, English tariffs have ceased to affect the importation of wool. In 1845, cotton, and five hundred articles, considered as raw mate­ rials, were admitted into England free of duty. The protective system was next attacked, and the duties reduced on all the manufactured articles which are of direct importance to the wants of the great majority of the people. By these measures, the British government removed the only obstacle which prevented the producer from attaining the end he has constantly in view, to w it: that of producing at the lowest possible price. At the point at which the industry of the country had arrived, this appeared the only way of progress which remained open to i t ; and, notwithstanding the interests which stood in the way, so soon as it appeared useful to that great interest, which rules all others in England, it was without hesitation adopted. By the free importation of cotton, flax, and wool, the basis of the prin­ cipal manufactures ; of iron, and other metals, which render these elements available ; and of coloring matters, and all the other materials necessary to transform the simple elements into manufactured articles, the English manufacturer possessed all the advantages which it seemed possible to secure to him. But the solicitude of the government did not cease here. The restrictive system, for the protection of the agriculture of the country, was still in force, burdening the operative with an expensive subsistence, and maintaining wages at a high price. The whole system is abandoned. The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. 21 It falls before the interest of production, which demands labor at a lower price as the last element of prosperity still wanting to it. For, it must be carefully remembered, the direct consequence of the economical reform, proposed in Parliament by the distinguished statesman who held the rudder of government, was the reduction of the rate of wages. It is of no use to object, that this idea is not once advanced in the exposi­ tion of his plan. It is in vain to assert, that he appealed to the generosity of the great landholders, from whom he asked the sacrifice of their privi­ leges, alleging that “ their tenants and farmers could thus obtain, in greater abundance, the necessaries of life.” This, Sir Robert Peel well knew, was not to be the ultimate result of the suppression of the protective du­ ties which he proposed. To obtain for the laboring classes a more abun­ dant and cheaper means of subsistence, what is this but to open the door for a reduction of wages ? The conditions of subsistence regulate wages, always and everywhere. Like merchandise, competition regulates the difference between its cost and its market price. We say, then, that when the English minister declared in Parliament, that his plans had for their object the improvement of the condition of the laboring classes of the kingdom, he likewise proposed to himself an ob­ ject, very desirable and very able, that of giving the recommendation of humanity to plans dictated in reality by interests less generous, indeed, but still national, the improvement of the condition of production in Eng­ land. In this measure, as in all the political measures of that country, we shall find more of patriotism than of philanthropy. II. T h e P r o m in e n t C ause op t h e R ed u c t io n of t h e D u t ie s in E n g la n d . W hat is the necessity which has occasioned, in England, a change thus hostile to powerful interests ? Why have we seen that country pass, suc­ cessively, from the restrictive principles of her maritime code, from those celebrated navigation acts, under the protection of which her industry has prospered, first, to a reduction of duties on the raw materials, and then, to a wide and almost complete application of the doctrine of commercial free­ dom ? Was it to do homage to the economical principles of Adam Smith, and add commercial toleration to the existing political and religious tolera­ tion, of which she also gave the first examples to the world ? N o : for England is not the country of theories or abstractions. Was it because the English aristocracy wished to anticipate the pre­ tensions of a democracy, which was aroused, and sought, by despoiling it­ self, to disarm it ? No : for no symptoms had been manifested, which need alarm it seriously. Was it, finally, the famine, with which the country was menaced, which called for the adoption of these new measures ? No : for it was by no means certain that they would be efficacious to remedy that evil. We must seek some other origin for these new doctrines of economy which have sprung up in England. It is not probable that the men who originated them acted spontaneously, but that, being the guardians of the public prosperity, which is inseparably connected with that of industry, they were compelled to bend their restrictive sympathies before the exi­ gency of new events. It was the opposition and the increasing greatness of a rival industrial production, which forced her to renounce a system which was possible in England only so long (and no longer) as she had no rival to contend with. 22 The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. While, on the continent, industry, struggling under the burdens imposed! upon it, strove feebly, although with courage, against unfavorable circum­ stances, a remote nation, descending late into the arena of industry, ad­ vances there with a firm and rapid step—a nation, placed in an admirable physical position; possessed of a great extent of maritime coast, with a soil which gives, at the lowest prices, coal, iron, and cotton, the three great elements of manufactures ; possessing, in the highest degree, those qualities, necessary to success in industry, as well as in commerce—love of labor, enterprise, and hardihood; practising, upon a grand scale, the fruitful principle of association ; and aided, finally, by those powerful in­ stitutions of credit, which furnish the means of execution to the grand conceptions of commercial genius. Who does not recognize, in this por­ trait, the United States of America? During the short period since its birth, American industry has made a progress, the rapidity of which will not surprise us when we consider the conditions of vitality grouped about it. We may say that it had no in­ fancy. It passed, without any interval, to the strength of a vigorous ma­ turity ; and at this moment it has the honor of alarming England, spite of her two hundred years of industrial domination. Already, in the markets of South America, of Asia, in all those, in fine, which offer her a competition on equal terms, the productions of the Uni­ ted States dispute the ground with those of Great Britain. Only one step more is needed, to establish an equality between these two rivals. This step is, the diminution of the wages of labor in the United States. Up to this moment, the high price of labor has acted as a counterpoise to the other favorable conditions which the United States eminently pos­ sess. But, is the moment far distant, when the agricultural employments being no longer sufficient to employ the surplus labor, a superabundant population will seek occupation in manufactures, and consequently reduce the price of labor ? Whoever compares the population of the United States, in 1815, with the population in 1846, will not consider that time very remote. There can be no doubt, that the rivalry of this country, possessing, as it does, on its own soil, not only the raw materials of industry, but like­ wise the greater part of its agents, and admitting, freely, the small num­ ber of those which she lacks—uniting, in fine, all the elements of labor, excepting one, only, at the lowest price, has, for some time, excited the secret apprehensions of the government of Great Britain, which is always awake to her commercial interests. There can be no doubt, that these fears were the real motive which induced that government to abandon, piece by piece, the restrictive system which guarantied the revenues to the great proprietors, in order that it might place the country on the same footing as its rival across the ocean. The foresight of this constantly in­ creasing danger suggested to an able minister, and obtained from an en­ lightened aristocracy, those new measures, of which the manifest purpose was, to procure for British industry the elements of production at a cheaper rate than before. Thus has England endeavored to increase the distance between herself and the rival who threatens to overtake her. III. T h e I n flu en c e on F ra n c e , of t h e s e N ew M easures o f E ng ­ la nd . Is France entirely uninterested in this severe struggle which is going The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. 23 on between those two powerful industrial rivals, England and the United States ? If the phrase, which we sometimes hear among us, is true, that the home market is sufficient for the production of the country, then France need not concern herself with the measures which England is adopting to reduce her cost of production. But what will be the actual consequence ? Protected, -by her prohibi­ tory and protective duties, from all danger of foreign competition, is she not certain of seeing the whole of her products thrown upon the home market, at prices proportioned to the expensiveness of production which her tariffs have occasioned ? Is she not like a lake, situated among moun­ tains, of which the level is neither regulated by rivers nor surrounding seas ? But if it is rare, in the natural world, that a lake should have no com­ munication with rivers or oceans, it is no less rare, in the social world, for the industry of a people to be entirely isolated from that of surrounding nations. It is given to a government to create an industrial movement, but it is not given to it to say, “ so far shalt thou go, and no farther.” To limit it, is not its province. It has been asked, what imports it, to the French producer, whether he pays a high price or a low one for the elements of his labor, provided he receives a proportional reward 1 In reasoning thus, -one thing is overlooked, namely, the surplus production. When once the impetus had been given to industry, in France, it natu­ rally grew and increased. Establishments were at first erected, with a view to supplying the wants of the country. But who could mark the limits of these wants 1 Encouraged by the perspective of a privileged market, the production went on increasing, until it became out of all pro­ portion to the wants of the home consumption. There was but one reme>dy for this evil, and that was exportation. Spite of the principles of that sect of political economists, which en­ deavored to limit our industry to the supply of the home market, exporta­ tion became, at first, a remedy' for excessive production, and afterwards, an element of French industry. Under the rule of those legislations, which for some time encouraged exports, our manufactures received a development which very far exceed­ ed the wants of the country. Henceforth, exportation became necessary for them. The home market is no longer sufficient for them. Outlets for the enormous surplus of its production have become an imperious neces­ sity. For this surplus of products, exportation offers a healthful mode of relief. Let this be checked, and the industrial body will suffer a plethora which must be productive of the most serious disorders. It would certainly be unwise for us (since we are thus outstripped, by England and the United States, in supplying those parts of the world which do not manufacture for themselves, and since the condition of these two manufacturing nations is firmly established) to attempt to dispute their position with them, or to create products solely with a view to foreign con­ sumption. Yet it would be as unwise to deny ourselves the advantage of throwing into foreign markets the surplus of our production, when it ex­ ists, (and it exists too often,) or to deprive ourselves of the faculty of em­ ploying, for foreign consumption, those means of production, which are not needed for the home consumption, and which the want of a foreign 24 The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. market has for some time left unapplied, to the great detriment of all in­ dustrial operations. Though it would be imprudent to make the foreign trade the basis of the national industry, still it must be clearly understood, that the exporta­ tion of our manufactured products to foreign countries, by increasing the production, has become, in France, a constituent element of public wealth. The governments which have swayed us during the past thirty years, have, from necessity, professed the doctrine, declared from the tribune and elsewhere, that it would be dangerous to encourage, in France, any ten­ dency to the creation of products, designed expressly for exportation. Yet it would seem that, in our day, even this doctrine has received, among our public men, important modifications ; at least, we may conclude so, from the increased activity of our foreign agents in sending home instructions useful to our industry, as well as from the embassies which have been sent to distant countries to negotiate commercial treaties. But it is not enough to suggest a remedy. It must also be made avail­ able. To leave French production in such a condition that exportation is impossible, at the same time that it is needed and demanded, this would be to point out the end, and at the same time prevent its attainment. Yet this is precisely the condition, at this moment, of our manufacturing indus­ try, and it has been occasioned by the tariffs on the elements of our indus­ try. The cost of manufacturing has increased, and consequently the out­ lets for our products are daily d o sin g ; for it is a singular contradiction, that, while the official returns of the customs exhibit an increase of our exports, taken in the mass, (owing to the old estimates of their values being used as a basis, though this estimate is now very exaggerated on account of the fall which most articles, manufactured in France, have experienced,) yet it is notorious that the exports to foreign countries, of the prominent articles of our production, have, during the last ten years, been gradually diminishing. Our fine broadcloths, formerly in demand through­ out the world, and our coarser woollens of the South, at one time so much sought after in the Levant, have now scarcely any outlet. Our exports of silk goods have fallen off, since 1840, from 160,000,000 to 110,000,000 francs. Germany, and North and South America, have ceased to take the large quantities of our calicoes which formerly flowed thither to the great relief of the home trade. Spain seeks elsewhere, mainly, for the large supplies of cotton fabrics which she formerly purchased at Bayonne and Beaucaire. India and China took, formerly, a much greater amount of our products than they receive at present. The once important expor­ tation of the cloths of Picardy and Brittany, has, in fact, ceased altogether. The increase (when any has taken place) has been, in the supplies for our colonies, which, enriched by the monopoly which we have granted them, in our market, compensate, by their consumption of our fabrics, for the premium which we pay on their natural productions. The fact, that a great number of our former outlets for goods have failed, during the past few years, is unfortunately too plain. Nor is it difficult to point out the cause of this evil. Established in all parts of the globe, wherever money is current, Eng­ lish commerce has endeavored to wrest from us, as well as other nations, all the commercial advantages which we enjoy in foreign markets. In this industrial warfare, it must be confessed, she has been completely sue- The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. 25 cessful. Indeed, such have been her tactics, that she could hardly fail of success. From necessity, no less than from preference, French manufacturers have given their attention to the production of fabrics of a substantial quality. This course has been dictated by the expensiveness of the raw materials, and by the severity of the tariffs, which, shutting out from our ports fabrics of an inferior quality, have completely prevented their use. Hence, those of our fabrics which were exported, were distinguished for their good taste and excellent quality. To imitate these, by disguising an inferior quality under a specious exterior, has been the means by which British enterprise has reaped great benefits, and a distaste for our fabrics been created wherever they have been offered. Foreigners have not been willing to pay the difference in price, between our products and the Eng­ lish, which, though actually inferior, present nearly the same appearance, with a very great advantage in respect to cost. Thus have English merchants, scattered through all the markets of the world, vigilant and active pioneers of the industry of their country, suc­ ceeded, at first, in becoming our rivals, and finally, in replacing our fabrics altogether with those of British manufacture, which have the capital ad­ vantage, over ours, of a cheaper production, owing to a more favorable system of duties. The effect of this cessation of exports to foreign markets—exports, which assisted, most remarkably, the industry of our country—has not been slow in making itself felt. Our manufacturers, not being themselves the exporters of their goods, and not knowing, often, whether they were to be exported, or to what market, were surprised to find their sales rapidly diminishing, and their goods encumbering their warerooms. The evil has been gradually increasing, and at this moment is almost general. Just in proportion as the cost of the raw materials has diminished in Eng­ land, have we seen English fabrics take the place of our own in foreign markets. The evil threatens to become still greater, now that the meas­ ures of Sir Robert Peel have received the sanction of Parliament. W hat shall be done to drain off the surplus over and above the wants of our home m arket? This surplus cannot be regarded as an evil, for it represents a good part of the active industry of F ran ce; or, at least, if regarded as an evil, it cannot be restricted without serious danger. Shall this surplus be sent to our colonies ? It is true, that, considering their small extent, their consumption is considerable, and maintains some ac­ tivity for our foreign trade ; but what is the future prospect of this outlet for our goods ? Can we much longer compel these colonies to supply themselves with French fabrics 1 Is it not admitted that a new organiza­ tion of labor must soon be yielded them ? Will not the effect of such a change, on the few colonies which our political disasters have left us, be, to render the agricultural production more costly and uncertain ? Such has been the experience of the colonies of other nations. Will their prosperity stand the test of such a trial, any better than Jamaica and the Isle of France have ? Or will it be said that, in order to preserve these few important markets, we should raise still higher the differential duties which assure to our colonies our market for their coffee and sugar? But the danger to their productions is not, alone, from similar foreign products. The indigenous industry of beet sugar, is a competitor not less alarming to them. And, in truth, has not the whole system of heavy duties had 26 The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. its day in France ? Will the tendency of things permit them to be re­ vived ? It must be confessed that, whichever way we turn our eyes, there ap­ pears, in the actual condition of our production, evil, at present, and threat­ ening evil in the future. IV . r ia l s T h e N e c e ssit y of R ed u cin g t h e D u t ie s on t h e R aw M a t e ­ I m po r ted in t o F ra n c e . In view of the facts which we have stated, will it be said, “ our na­ tional industry has nothing to fear from the measures adopted in England, to reduce the cost of production; and that our inhibitive duties, by pre­ venting all foreign competition, sufficiently guarantee the safety of our in­ dustry '!” There can be no doubt that the continuance of the prohibitive duties, in France, is not only necessary, but also perfectly just, so long as the conditions of labor here are not the same as in other rival nations ; for, so long as one, or many of these rivals, possess advantages over us, ac­ quired by conditions of labor more favorable than among ourselves— so long as they are capable of controlling larger capitals, at a lower rate of interest—in fine, so long as they have the elements of production, derived from their soil, or the elements of commerce, derived from their geo­ graphical position, on better conditions than ourselves, they cannot offer us reciprocity, the only equitable basis of a system of exchanges. In this state of things, the exclusion of foreign products similar to our own, is not conferring a monopoly, but rendering strict justice to our manufac­ turers. Let the prohibition, therefore, remain. It prevents, in our home market, the fate which has befallen our products in foreign markets, that of being imitated and discredited, by fabrics of a poorer quality, but of specious appearance, and which are rapidly substituted for ours, owing to the tendency of the majority of people to prefer a poor article, at a low price, to more substantial goods, at an advanced price—a tendency inju­ rious to their best interests. Against this abuse, prohibition is the only sufficient barrier. A protective duty is not sufficient to prevent it, for this is not a struggle of price, merely, but of bad quality with good—a strug­ gle, which the French manufacturers are not prepared nor disposed to sustain. Let the prohibitive system, therefore, be retained upon the articles which it protects, since imperious circumstances demand i t ; and, if it is found that, the principle once admitted, it is unjust to make exceptions, let the protection continue to extend to the home productions of iron and coal, the two principal agents of all industry, and which it is most important to have at the lowest price, but for which, circumstances so grave make a favoring exception on our own soil. Let England proceed from the theory, to the practice of the system of commercial liberty, which she alone is in a condition to carry out. It is, indeed, a brilliant spectacle which she is giving to the world, thus proving that she is sufficiently strong to defy all her rivals. We cannot but admire and envy the position, which the foresight and sagacity of her statesmen have secured to her, and which permits her to apply the most healthful principles of political economy to the regulation of her interests. But let us beware of imitating her—we, who are very remote from the industrial position which she has won, and who cannot aspire to reach it. That which offers no danger to British industry, would be a death-blow to The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. 27 our own. Let her able minister still cherish the hope of inducing other nations to follow the example which England has given ; let him promise himself that a reciprocity will be established in foreign markets, which would be, in fact, a monopoly established in favor of England ; neither these hopes, nor these promises, should engage or seduce us. Our in­ terests ought to be our only rule, in the matter of tariffs, and those in­ terests are traced for us by our peculiar situation. The system which will answer for an industry arrived at maturity, will not answer for an in­ dustry yet in its infancy. Moreover, there is one fact, which ought to be borne in mind here. Even in England, the system of entire commercial freedom has not been adopted. In those branches of industry where there is anything to fear from foreign competition, it is still considered necessary to maintain the aegis of protective duties. The same prudence is extended to the colonies of Great Britain. The fabrics of wool, of silk, and the higher qualities of linen goods, are still subject to a duty of 10 to 15 per cent on their value; the duty on imported woods, remains unchanged; a differential duty continues to protect the sugar of the British colonies ; while wines and brandies, those rivals of the English brewed liquors, are burdened— the former, by a heavy duty, and the latter, by an exorbitant one, of three to four times their original values. England, therefore, does not admit the practice of entire liberty, except when there is no danger of injuring her interests. This is a good exam­ ple to follow. We see that the doctrines, professed in that country, are not so different from our own as they at first appeared. Her only advan­ tage over us, consists .in the greater number of branches of industry there, which admit of the application of those doctrines. It ought not to be forgotten, that the route which has conducted Eng­ land to the haven of commercial freedom which she now enjoys, has been, first, the adoption of the prohibitive, and afterwards, of the protective sys­ tem, and that we are pursuing the same route. But if the whole of the system of duties which has recently been es­ tablished in England, is, unfortunately, not adapted to our actual condition, that part, which concerns the raw materials of industry, is not only ap­ plicable, but necessary. Let us maintain a legitimate barrier against the irruption into our market of foreign goods, created under conditions of labor and industrial tendencies, very different from our o w n; but let us strive to establish an equality, between our productions and the foreign, both with a view to prevent fraudulent importations, and to render possible a competition abroad. To obtain this object, one way is open to us—a way, which has been followed by other manufacturing nations—and that is, the admittance, free of duty, of the raw materials of our industry. Is there any serious objection to this course ? The interest of the agri­ culturalists is not opposed to it, for our soil does not produce the cotton, gums, and oil, used by the manufacturers ; it gives us only a small part of the tinctorial matters, the linens, the silks, and the woollens, which we require. Nor is the interest of the revenue opposed to i t ; for, when we consult the history of the public revenue, in England, we find that the products which have been reduced have always supplied, by their increase in quan­ 28 t The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. tity, the difference in the rate of duties. The regularity of this rule is sufficiently established, by the revenue from the importation of salt, which maintains itself at the same amount, although the duty has been reduced from 75 to 10 francs per quintal, as well as by the postage reform, which has augmented the resources of the revenue, although the postage has been reduced more than three-fourths of its former rate. If there remain any further apprehensions as to the results of a reduc­ tion of duties on raw materials, they ought to disappear before these •words, pronounced by Sir Robert Peel, in Parliam ent: “ I had estima­ ted,” said the minister, “ the losses, from the suppression of duties on sugars and other articles, at £1,000,000 sterling; but I think the loss on the excise, this year, will be nothing. Is it, because I see all my esti­ mates of a deficiency of revenue brought to nought, that I ought to advo­ cate high duties ?” The exports of articles of British manufacture increasing, by reason of the reduction of duties on raw materials, from £42,000,000 to £56,000,000 sterling, is a fact sufficient, not only to remove all fear of the introduction of this system among ourselves, but to induce the hope, that its adoption will open a brilliant future for our industrial activity. In fact, the ^suppression of duties on raw materials, having for its im­ mediate effect, the reduction of the cost of production, must, by a neces­ sary consequence, augment the home consumption. In this increase, is found the answer to the question, “ What will supply the deficiency in the revenue, on the total suppression of certain duties ?” Sir Robert Peel (we cannot recur too often to an authority so important) has given us the fullest security on this point. “ The consequence of the reduction of duties on imports,” says he, “ may be, a diminution in the revenue; but this loss, I believe, will be more than compensated by the effect produced in the country.” And again : “ The real sources of the increase of the revenue, are the increase of the objects of demand, and the spread among the people of a taste for those articles which are not of the first necessity. Your revenue is augmented, though you reduce the duties, by an invisible and involuntary tax, springing from the increased consumption of those articles which are subject to duty.” These are better than eloquent words. They are words, expressing a truth of high importance, sanctioned by experience. It is the history of facts, coming forward to give testimony to the foresight of the greatest ad­ ministrative genius of the age. Let the advantages which industry, in England, previously enjoyed, be accorded to ours, and the same cause would produce the same effect. From the free importation of the raw materials, such a development would be given to the industrial movement in France, that not only the public revenue would have no diminution to fear, but its resources would be infallibly augmented by reason of the in­ creased activity to all the branches of the public prosperity. To confine ourselves to one example. Consider the advantages to the country, in work afforded to the laboring classes ; in transports by land and by s e a ; in the construction of new establishments; in fine, in the augmentation of the revenue, from such an increased consumption of cot­ ton fabrics, alone, as should make the average consumption seventeen francs for each inhabitant, as it is in England, instead of six francs, as it remains at present! Articles of the first quality, for which civilization has a tendency to The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. 29 create a greater and greater need, extended to a larger proportion of the people ; employment secured to the working classes ; prosperity restored to the languishing workshops; new guaranties afforded of internal tran­ quillity and prosperity; such will be the certain results of the suppression of the duties on raw materials ; and all these blessings can be secured, without any danger to the public revenue. Can we err, in following the path traced for us by the statesmen of Great Britain, so sagacious in all questions of practical interest— men, who have elevated their country to the condition of industrial, commercial, political, and maritime power, which she now holds ? V. T h e D an gers , w h ic h t h e C on tin u a n c e of t h e E x ist in g D u ­ R aw M a t e r ia l s , t h r e a t e n s to h e r I n d ustry t ie s in F ra nce on t h e and h e r M a r in e . W hat will be the results, if, instead of suppressing, at the same time with England, the duties upon raw materials, our government continues the existing tariffs ? In such a state of things, the elements of production with us remaining at the same prices, while the foreign have acquired more advantageous prices, the basis of the estimates of the duties levied on imported mer­ chandise, with a view to protect the manufactures of the country, is found completely changed, and these duties become insufficient for the purpose for which they were levied. If, for example, (and this estimate need not be regarded as exaggerated,) the new measures of England obtain for her industry an economy of 10 per cent on the expense of production, the protection duty of 30 per cent, which burdens the importation of English linen threads into France, is, in fact, reduced to 20 per cent, and they will create in our markets a competition with our manufactures, which we should have to lessen by an increase of the present rates of duty. It is the same with the iron for machinery, and other articles of English manu­ facture, of which our tariffs allow the importation. But this is not all. The prices of our different manufactures, being yet greater than those of our industrial competitors, we shall finally lose altogether the few outlets for our goods which we have been able to preserve. Is this result of no consequence to the industry of the country ? The manufacturers who produce from the raw material of cotton—that fabric so universally adopted, now-a-days, for domestic use, and which has become the most fruitful source of labor in nearly all nations, and the basis of their exchanges— are precisely those who suffer most directly, in France, from the effects of the system of duties now in force, and who have the deepest interest in their reform. No industry sustains higher duties than this, upon all the elements of its production—duties, purely fiscal, since these elements do not enter into competition with any of the productions of our own soil; none employs a greater number of people ; none, in fine, consumes more largely the products of home industry. What advantages does it possess, to compensate it for so many services rendered to the country, and so many burdens which it supports ? “ The privilege of the home market?” This market is insufficient for two-thirds of its production, and, under the apprehension of an immense surplus at homo, it must seek to contend, in foreign markets, with rival productions placed in conditions much more advantageous. It is true that the position of our cotton industry is not altogether, as regards the necessity of exterior outlets, analogous to that of the same in­ 30 The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. dustry in E ngland; but if importation is the life of the latter, we may safely say, that is the health of the former. If it is true that the sudden cessation of exports to foreign countries, would bring upon the cotton in­ dustry of Great Britain a mortal crisis, it is no less true that the same cause will plunge our own into a dangerous lethargy; and from a pro­ longed lethargy, to death, the distance is short, and the transition almost infallible. Whether we consider the low price of the elements of labor, to have for its effect to open for our products a more active sale in the home mar­ ket, or to enable them to maintain, in foreign markets, a more equal com­ petition with the productions of English and American manufactures, this low price is the only remedy to be sought, in the precarious state in which our establishments are languishing. During the existence, and the prospect of a continuance, of a favorable competition with other nations, large establishments have been built up, vast capitals set in motion, and entire villages gathered about these works, which have now become their only resource. Is it not an act alike of justice and of public utility, to maintain these conditions of competition with other nations, since they constitute the basis on which rests so many interests of the highest moment ? It is because, in England, the industrial and commercial interests pre­ dominate over all others, and because a wise experience has proved that these interests are the only solid basis of a State, that she possesses, with a dense population, a very advanced state of civilization. To secure la­ bor for the people—to increase the outlets for the products of this labor— such are the questions which appear, in England, to claim a superiority over all others. We may say, that they constitute the basis and essence of all her politics. What spectacle could more fully exhibit this tendency than that of the Prime Minister of England, whose hand sways the whole politics of the world, rising in his place to discuss the minutest details of the food and clothing of the working classes, and replying to the smiles that pervaded a portion of the Chamber, at the strangeness of such a con­ trast, “ that all these matters were in reality worthy of his attention !” It is because matters so humble connect themselves with the highest interests of Great Britain, that they become important. It is because when the laborer is able to procure, at a low price, the bread, meat, and beer, as well as the hats and shoes, which Sir Robert Peel has not dis­ dained to quote, that he will be content with low wages ; that the manu­ factures of England will be able to maintain their superiority over those of other nations; and that, finally, she may thus keep within her grasp her supremacy on the ocean, and her political preponderance. When, in France, shall we appreciate truths, which, like the following, have become proverbs among our neighbors ? “ The people, which has industry, will have commerce ; and with commerce, it will have a mer­ chant marine, sailors, a military marine, and colonies.” W e might add, that the nation which possesses all these, possesses wealth and power. W hen these ideas obtain a foothold among us, it will no longer be said, that “ it is for industry and commerce to take care of themselves ; that a government has nothing to do with their interests, and that the wisest part is, to let them alone.” On the contrary, it will be proclaimed, that the solicitude of the government ought to extend to the whole of the industrial interests; that it is its duty to secure production from the injurious effects The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. 31 which the measures taken by other nations are likely to have upon it. It will then be acknowledged, that the interests of industry merit the deepest and most serious attention, since with its prosperity, is connected that of all other branches of the public wealth, and since its ruin would inevitably draw after it that of commerce, the marine, and consequently of the power of the State. Of the marine, also, it was formerly said, that “ it was not one of the principal interests of the country, and that France should not aspire to the dignity of a maritime power.” The enormity of such a proposition has been refuted by good sense ; and it is an axiom of policy sufficiently ad­ mitted now-a-days, that in order to be ranked among the first nations on the globe, we must be strong on the ocean. Now, it is clear, that the only way to have a navy, powerful in the num­ ber and experience of its seamen, is to sustain an active and flourishing merchant marine. This, alone, can serve as a preparatory school, and nursery for the military marine. Industry feeds the merchant marine, by consuming the raw materials which it brings from foreign nations, and by furnishing it with objects of exchange wherewith to purchase them advantageously. It is not sufficiently considered to what an extent the languishing state of our manufactures has already re-acted upon our merchant marine. Let the ship-owners of Bordeaux and Havre, be consulted—let the statistics of all our ports be examined, and they will show a progressive diminution of the share which our flag takes in the commerce of the world. In 1845, it had fallen off to one-fourth of what it was in 1830. Yet our merchant marine is likewise protected by differential duties, which seemed sufficient to secure its interests. But of what use is this protection, if the basis of the operations of exchange becomes more favorable for the com­ merce of rival nations, than for that of our own ? As these exchanges alone constitute advantageous operations, the trade of foreigners becomes stronger than the protection of differentia] duties which ours enjoys. If the foreign trade of France is confined to the purchase abroad, of pro­ ducts paid for by our specie, instead of our manufactures, it is so much abstracted from the active operations of the country. Such operations are so costly, that our ship-owners will abandon them altogether, prefer­ ring to leave the task of supplying us to foreign vessels. Then there will be no longer a merchant service for us, and the coasting will take the place of the foreign trade. These are the results, to which we are hastening at a rapid pace, and these will be yet further aggravated, if, from a new difference in cost, arising between our manufactured articles and our foreign, our present few and insignificant outlets fail altogether. Yet we must expect this, and at no distant date, if we remain inactive when other nations are arousing themselves, and if, ignorant of the effects of the measures they are adopt­ ing, we yield to a blind indifference. V I. C onclusion . N ec essity o f P r o t e c t iv e M ea su r es . The measures already adopted by the British government, and those which she is about to adopt, to complete the suppression of duties on the raw materials of industry, are creating for the English manufacturer more and more favorable conditions of labor, and threaten to give the final blow to our export trade. The effects will be particularly felt by our cotton industry. Exporta­ 32 The Commercial and Industrial Policy o f France. tion—the only way of relieving the home market of the surplus which far exceeds its wants ; of rendering profitable unproductive capitals ; of giv­ ing constant activity to large establishments ; of furnishing labor to opera­ tives, whom the production of articles adapted to home consumption is not sufficient to employ; the only means, in fine, of sustaining our merchant marine— exportation demands the most efficient measures, if we would not see our workshops fall in ruins, our population starving, spite of the efforts of the manufacturers, and our ships rotting in our harbors. The best remedy for these sad results of the disadvantageous position occasioned by our tariffs, is the complete suppression of the duties on all raw materials, non-manufactured. This measure, by diminishing mate­ rially the cost of production, and consequently, the price of the articles produced, will place them within reach of a far greater number of con­ sumers at home, and greatly augment the activity of trade ; the first ad­ vantage. It will, at the same time, permit our superabundant products to flow into foreign markets, where they will cover, at least, the expense of their pro­ duction ; another advantage, not less important, rendered to industry and navigation. Should financial considerations (which experience does not seem to jus­ tify) prevail, to prevent the adoption of this certain method of securing to our manufactures and shipping a prosperity which they are losing, a pal­ liation less energetic, but still salutary, remains. Our manufacturers are taxed high for their iron and coal, articles which foreign commerce would furnish at a cheaper rate. This is done for the purpose of favoring our home production of iron and coal, and they also pay considerable duties on their raw materials. It is said, “ the prices in the home market indemnifies them for these advances.” Be it so. But for that part of their production, which they must export under pain of a surplus and its consequences, it is just that they receive from the commu­ nity, which these advances have profited, an indemnity, which the price in foreign markets does not afl'ord them. In regard to the manufacture of cotton, especially, is it desirable to preserve it from the danger with which it is threatened by the new meas­ ures of England, as well as by the increasing production of the United States ? Is it really regarded as a matter of public interest, to secure its existence, (for that is the question,) by securing a sale for its products abroad ? Tfien, if it is not possible, at present, to furnish it with its raw materials, free from all duty, at least, let the burdens which it is compelled to bear, above the same manufacture, in England—what it pays for its iron, its coal, and the duties of all kinds— be taken into account, and let there be established a “ premium o f restitution,” on an equitable basis, on the export of its products. Let it not be said, that it is unjust to make the mass of the nation, and agriculture, particularly, contribute to such a premium granted to indus­ try ; for, in fact, it is not a premium which industry asks, but this simple “ institution ” of an advance, made to the community and agriculture, also. Has it not afforded the working classes the means of consuming the agri­ cultural products which have also received their share of protection ? Has it not, by paying into the treasury the amount of the duties levied upon the elements which it employs, as well as its portion of contributions of all kinds, lightened, of a certain sum, every contributor ? What does it Commerce and Government o f the Hawaiian Kingdom, etc. 33 reclaim, but the reimbursement of an outlay made by itself? How can it be unjust, that each should contribute to restore what has profited all ? In conclusion, which shall be applied to the disordered state of industry in France—the palliative, or the remedy? There must be a choice, for the condition of things will no longer admit of neglect. A subject so grave, ought to arouse the whole attention of our states­ men. The importance which, in England, attaches to commercial and industrial questions, ought to reveal to them the great importance of these questions among ourselves. Should they, at length, become persuaded, that the interests of production are of the first importance to a people, and are so closely allied to the general prosperity, that they may be said to be one with it, they cannot close their eyes to the disastrous consequences which the able economical system practised in Great Britain, will infalli­ bly entail upon our manufactures, if a sage foresight does not prevent. They will awake to the duty, which the measures of England impose on them, of diminishing the cost of labor, as well as of securing it, to the la­ borer. They also should save and prosper the industry of their country; for industry is labor, in common with capital, hands, and ideas ; and labor, in its turn, is the only solid basis of society, since from it spring all order and wealth.

II.— COMMERCE AND GOVERNMENT OF TI1E HAWAIIAN KINGDOM, OR SANDW ICH ISLANDS, SIN C E T H E ACKN O W LED G M ENT OF T H E IR IN D E ­ PE N D E N C E BY T H E U N IT E D ST A TES, EN G LA N D , AND FR A N C E .* I n the July and August numbers, 1843, of the Merchants’ Magazine, I gave a brief account of the trade and politics of this archipelago, up to the date of its seizure by Lord George Paulet in February of that year. In July following, Rear Admiral Thomas, by order of the British govern­ ment, restored the islands to their legitimate sovereign. Since that period, unmolested by foreign powers, they have rapidly advanced, under the auspices of the King’s own government and the enterprise of foreigners, in wealth and power, though, perhaps, not in population, so far as the aborigines are concerned. No accurate census of the population of the group has as yet been taken, though the succeeding year will probably show one. In round numbers, the population is set down at 100,000, of which not over 1,500 are of foreign origin. To within a few years, a fearful depopulation has undoubtedly been going on, from causes which are now generally well understood. With the increase of civilization, these have become in some degree modified. On some of the smaller islands, the native population has begun to increase ; and among some individuals, well-informed as to the general condition of the people, hopes are entertained that the forth­ coming census will show an increase of births over deaths throughout the nation. This, however, is very doubtful, when the enfeebled constitutions and vicious propensities of the race are considered. The foreign population is rapidly on the increase, both from births and * Written for the Merchants’ Magazine, by James Jackson Jarvis, Esq., Editor of the Polynesian, Honolulu, Oahu, December, 1846.

The average foreign population of Honolulu is near 1,000, including thirty-eight American families, eight of which are of the Ameri­ can mission, and twelve English and others. On the remainder of the group there are thirty-six families, including twenty-seven attached to the American mission. These families number about 350 souls, with few ex­ ceptions all Americans. The number of white ladies, not born on the group, is ninety, besides some who reside here transiently, mostly wives of masters of vessels employed in whaling. The remaining foreign popu­ lation is principally composed of young men, adventurers from all nations, seeking an opening here for their various callings. They constitute the most valuable industrial portion of the community, for among them are to be found very many well disposed and skilful tradesmen and artisans. The progress of the country is greatly retarded by the selfish policy of the principal landlords among the chiefs, who hold by feudal tenure most of the arable land. They are indisposed to allow not only their own people to hold lands by tenure of purchase, but prevent foreigners from embark­ ing, to any extent, in agricultural enterprises. This system of exclusive­ ness is, however, receiving its death-blow through the efforts of the white officers of government, backed by the more liberal views of the King, so that, in a few years, the agricultural interest will be greatly advanced. Up to the present time, (December, 1846,) 350 foreigners have become naturalized. The chiefs, at first, allowed naturalization by merely sub­ scribing the oath of allegiance ; but this simple provision permitting the too facile incorporation in the nation of doubtful characters, more desirous of a temporary connection with native females than of any permanent al­ legiance to the government, the chiefs passed a law', requiring two years’ previous notice of intention and certificates of good character. The government of the Hawaiian Islands is a constitutional monarchy. The present King is a son of Kamehameha I., celebrated as the con­ queror of the entire group, and favorably known to traders from the United States, for twenty years previous to his death, in 1819. He was suc­ ceeded by his eldest son, the dissipated Liholiho, who died in England, in 1824. The government then remained under the regency of Kaahumanu, dowager Queen of Kamehameha I., until her death, in 1832, when the present King, although but a youth, succeeding to the rank and title of his father, as Kamehameha III., began to take an active part in political af­ fairs. It is only, however, since the recognition of the independence of his kingdom, by the United States, France, and England, that he has as­ sumed the prerogatives of a sovereign prince in his national intercourse with other powers. Since then, he has been gradually winning his wray to that degree of independence, which, by the law of nations, is as much his due as if he had perfect power to maintain it, but which, at first, through the embarrassing restrictions of England and France upon his courts and customs, w'as rather nominal than real. Those countries still require, by imposed treaties, that no higher dutv than 5 per cent ad valorent shall be levied at the custom-houses upon the goods of their subjects, and that their consuls, in cases of crimes committed by their countrymen, shall nominate the juries. This has proved a fruitful source of discord from its unequal operation; for the effect has been, when a Hawaiian was the suffering party, to require him or her to appear before a jury of foreigners, selected by the consul, who also acts as counsel for the foreign .criminal. In March of this year, the treaties were so far modified, as to Hawaiian Kingdom, or Sandwich Islands. 35 allow a Hawaiian one-half of his own countrymen on a jury, and to per­ mit the government to levy any amount of duties on wines and spirituous liquors, provided they did not amount to a prohibition. A treaty has still more recently been concluded with Denmark, which recognizes in full the right of the King to administer justice in his own courts, independent of the vexatious interference of foreign consuls, and to lay such imposts as the necessities of his exchequer may require. The United States are ready to negotiate a treaty upon the same equal term s; and it is believed that England and France will shortly consent to forego their embarrassing requisitions, and leave the King as free to act in these respects as other sovereigns. The acts, organizing the executive government of the Hawaiian Islands, went into operation this year, (1846.) They create five departments, as follows:— 1. The “ Interior,” at the head of which is John Young, chief minis­ ter of the kingdom. His father was an Englishman, married to the daughter of a native chief of high rank. 2. “ Foreign Relations,” filled by R. C. Wyllie, a Scotchman by birth. 3. “ Finance,” filled by G. P. Judd, an American by birth. 4. “ Public Instruction,” filled by Wm. Richards, an American by birth. 5. “ Law,” filled by John Ricord, an American by birth. These officers have salaries of $2,000 each, and are removable at pleasure by the King. They constitute his cabinet council. The governors of the several islands are all native chiefs, and with the cabinet form the privy council. Their salaries and incomes vary from $3,000 to $5,000, derivabl.e in part from their lands and from the Treasury. The King draws $6,000 annually from the Treasury, for his household ex­ penses, but his real income from all sources is probably more than double that sum. The Queen has a distinct allowance. The following are the principal naturalized'officers employed by gov­ ernment :— Americans by Birth.— Lorrin Andrews, Wm. H. Lee, Judges in For­ eign Cases, (Appellate Judges ;) James .T. Jarvis, Director of Government Press; Wm. Paty, Collector-General and Auditor of Treasury; D. P. Penhallow, Harbor-Master and Pilot; John Meek, Pilot; A. P. Everett, J. R. Von Pfister, Auctioneers ; B. Pitman, Collector at H ilo; J. R. Jas­ per, District Attorney for Oahu. Englishmen by Birth.— II. Lea, M arshal; A. Brickwood, Sheriff of Oahu, and Prefect of Police ; C. G. Hopkins, Justice of Peace ; T. C. B. Rooke, Port Physician ; H. Swinton, Collector at L ahaina; G. Rhodes, Collector at H audei; G. Robertson, Chief Clerk in Interior Department; G. Singleton, Chief Clerk in Foreign Office. A number of other foreigners are employed in the several departments as clerks, & c .; but few natives have been found competent to keep books and do the common duties of these situations. The real labor of govern­ ment falls almost exclusively upon the foreign employees, and without fidel­ ity and zeal on their part, it could not continue to exist. Numbers of the young chiefs and better classes of natives are being educated in English, and trained to business habits, with the hope that, before long, the nation will have need of less recourse to foreign aid. The salaries of these em­ ployees range from $400 to $2,000 per annum, which, considering the great expense attendant upon living in this country, are not equal to more 36 Commerce and Government o f the than half those sums in the United States or Europe. Great economy is maintained through all branches of the government. It would be of pub­ lic advantage, were the King to authorize a loan sufficient to improve the roads, erect warehouses for bonded merchandise, and construct an aque­ duct from the valley of Nemanu to the town of Honolulu, all of which would form profitable outlays ; but the policy of the present Minister of Finance is not to contract any foreign debt, preferring to delay public im­ provements than to incur a monetary responsibility outside the kingdom. The revenue is derived from the customs, poll taxes, licenses, stamp duties, and a small land and labor tax from the farmers, which last, how­ ever, are very unproductive under the present system. Real and personal property are subject to taxation whenever there is a deficiency through other sources.

The exports consist chiefly of goods re-exported— one-third of the imports, perhaps, find their way out of the kingdom— supplies to vessels, sugar, coffee, salt, goat-skins, hides, arrow-root, cattle, and bills of ex­ change drawn on the United States and Europe. The chief exports will eventually be sugar, molasses, salt, and coffee, the quantities of which are increasing. The prices of all articles of agricultural produce are exceeding high, owing to the want of enterprise in the native population, and the restric­ tions upon the sale of lands. Sugar brings from 6 to 8 cents per lb .; mo­ lasses, 24 to 371 cents per gallon ; salt, $1 25 per b b l.; coffee, 12+ to 15 cents per lb .; beef, 8 cents per lb .; butter, 371 cents per lb .; eggs,*§ * Including $2(1,000 exacted by Captain Le Place, in 1839, and restored by the French government, March, 1846. + Estimated, as the returns are not yet completed, t Including an estimate for the months of November and December. § Including an estimate for the months of November and December, from arrivals and departures expected.

The prices of foreign goods have rapidly declined within two years, while all, of domestic growth and manufacture, have greatly advanced; so that Honolulu has become one of the most expensive places of living, so far as the table is concerned, in the Pacific. Fruit is scarce and dear, with few exceptions.

The above statistics embrace only the arrivals at the two principal ports of entry, Lahaina and Honolulu. Two other ports, Hilo and Hanalei, are open to whalers, but the arrivals at them have not been computed. They would materially swell the number for each year. Many ships touch twice or oftener, in each year, and not unfrequently proceed from one port to another. Each visit is included. The following is an abstract of the Hawaiian laws, respecting vessels, harbors, &e., & c .:— Vessels arriving off the ports of entry, to make the usual marine signal if they want a pilot. The pilot will approach vessels to the windward, and present the health certifi­ cate to be signed by the captain. If the vessel is free from any contagion the captain will hoist the white flag, otherwise he will hoist the yellow flag, and obey the direction of the pilot and health officer. Passports must be exhibited to the Governor or collector, by passengers,'before landing. Masters of vessels allowing baggage to be landed, before compliance with the laws, are subject to a fine of $500. Masters of vessels, on arriving at any of the ports of entry, are required to de­ liver all letters to the collector of customs. The commanding officer of any merchant vessel, immediately after coming to anchor at either of the legalized ports of entry, shall make known to the collector of customs the business upon which said vessel has come to his port, furnish him with a list of passengers, and deliver him a manifest of the cargo with which she is laden, containing marks and numbers, and the names of those to whom con­ signed. The collector, at his discretion, and at the expense of any vessel, may provide an officer to be present on board said vessel during her discharge, to superintend the disembarkation, and see that no other or greater amount of merchandise be landed than is set forth in the permit. 38 Commerce and Government o f the All goods landed at any of the ports of these islands are subject to a duty of 5 per cent ad valorem. The following are the only ports of entry at these islands, v iz .: for merchant­ men, Honolulu, Oahu, and Lahaina, M aui; and for whalers, in addition thereto, Hilo, Hawaii, and Ilanalei, Kauai. Spirituous, or fermented liquors, landed at any of the ports of these islands, are subject to the following duties, v iz .: rum, gin, brandy, whiskey, & c., $ 5 per gal­ lon ; wines, (except claret,) liqueurs, cordials, & c., $1 per g allon ; claret wine, ale, porter, beer, cider, & c., & c., 50 cents per gallon. Products of the whale fishery may be transhipped free from any charge of transit duty. Whalers, having complied with the laws, are entitled to receive at the custom­ house a “ First Permit,” allowing them to land goods, to an amount not exceeding $200, duty free; hut if they exceed that amount, they must take out a “ Second Permit,” upon which the usual (5 per cent) duties will be chargeable. Permits to trade or barter, given to vessels engaged in the whale fishery, shall not include the sale, barter, or disposition of spirituous liquors, but all such traffic on the part of the whalers shall be held to constitute them merchantmen, and sub­ ject them, in all respects, to the like duties. Whalers landing goods to an amount exceeding $1,000, become subject to the same charges as merchantmen. V essels landing goods, upon which the duties have not been paid, are liable to seizure and confiscation. If any person commit an offence on shore, and the offender escape on board of any vessel, it shall be the duty of the commanding officer of said vessel to sur­ render the suspected or culprit person to any officer of the police who demands this surrender, on production of a legal warrant. It shall not be lawful for any person on board of a vessel at anchor in the har­ bor of Honolulu, to throw stones or other rubbish overboard, under a penalty of $100. All sailors found ashore at Lahaina, after the beating of the drum, or at Hono­ lulu, after the ringing of the bell, are subject to apprehension and a fine of $2. Ship-masters must give notice to the harbor-master of the desertion of any of their sailors, within forty-eight hours, under a penalty of $100. , Seamen are not allowed to be discharged at any of the ports of these islands, excepting those of Lahaina and Honolulu. It shall not be lawful to discharge seamen at any of the ports of these islands, without the written consent of the Governor. Honolulu and Lahaina are the only ports at which native seamen are allowed to be shipped, and at those places with the Governor’s consent only. Any vessel taking away a prisoner-from these islands shall be subject to a fine of $400. To entitle any vessel to a clearance, it shall be incumbent on her commanding officer first to furnish the collector of customs with a manifest of cargo intended to be exported in said vessel. It shall not be lawful for the commanding officer of any Hawaiian or foreign vessel, to carry out of this kingdom, as a passenger, any domiciled alien, natural­ ized foreigner, or native, without previous exhibition to him of a passport from H is Majesty’s Minister of Foreign Relations. Retailers o f spirituous liquors are not allowed to keep their houses open later than 9 o’clock in the evening, and they are to be closed from Saturday evening until Monday morning. Rapid riding in the streets is prohibited under a penalty of $5. Port Charges at Honolulu.— W h alers, tonn age, 6 cen ts per ton ; buoys, $ 2 .

Hawaiian Kingdom, or Sandwich Islands. 39 The custom-house charges 50 cents to $1, each, for stamped manifests, entries, permits, clearances, bonds, transit-entries, &c., as each vessel may require. The Minister of Finance has power to remit all charges, except pilotage and health fees, upon satisfactory causes shown, as from distress, or pursuit by an enemy. The currency of the Hawaiian Kingdom is as mixed as its population. The only national coin is of copper, of the value of a cent. Five franc pieces are received at $ 1 ; one franc pieces, 18J cents; English shillings, 25 cents ; English sovereigns, $4 50 ; English rupees, (East India,) 50 cents ; Spanish and American doubloons, $16 ; American dimes and half-dimes, 12^ and 6 | cents ; Dutch guilders, 3 7 i cents ; Bra­ zilian 960 reis, $ 1 ; Brazilian 640 reis, 50 cents. No satisfactory standard prevails. Every species of coin, even those of Japan, are received at some rate or other, if of good weight and character. The Massachusetts scale of weights and measures prevail. Smuggling is punished by heavy fines, confiscation, and sale of mer­ chandise and vessel, when engaged in it. The duties are low, except on spirits, and much is trusted to the honor of merchants. But one case of smuggling has occurred—that of the Hamburgh brig Helene, in Novem­ ber, 1846— five barrels of brandy being seized in the attempt. By law, the vessel was forfeited to government; but it being the first case, clem­ ency was exercised, and the supercargo got off with a fine of $2,500. Diplomatic agents are allowed to import stores and articles for their own consumption, free of duty. Captains of vessels having entered, and departing without a clearance, are liable to a fine of $500. The retailing of spirituous liquors is permitted only at Honolulu, and there, under a rigid license system, forbidding the sale to natives, and closing the shops at 9, P. M. The high duties have operated to diminish the consumption, and added to the quiet and respectability of the town, in which more than 10,000 seamen yearly congregate. About 3,000 Hawaiians, between fifteen and thirty years of age, are profitably employed as seamen on board of foreign ships, or are in service in other countries. The number of pupils enrolled in the common schools is near 20,000, most of whom learn simply to read and write—no difficult task in the H a­ waiian tongue, with its sparse vocabulary, and thirteen simple vowel and liquid sounds. The knowledge of English is quite rapidly spreading among all classes. Upwards of $5,000, are now annually expended by the government and merchants, in forwarding their letters through Mexico. Were a good mail route established by the United States, to and from this kingdom to the United States, at least $10,000 postage might be annually counted on from this quarter. The operations of the merchants are frequently much em­ barrassed, for want of a proper and safe communication with Europe and the United States. 40 Andraud's New System o f Railroad Locomotion. Art. III.— ANDRAUD’S NEW SYSTEM OP RAILROAD LOCOMOTION. [PROM A CORRESPONDENT OF THE m e r c h a n t s ’ MAGAZINE IN FRANCE.] I r e c e n t l y went with Mr. Kyan, the well-known inventor of Kyanized timber, and the author of several scientific works of great merit, to examine Andraud’s new system of railroad locomotion. M. Andraud was induced to make the researches which have led to his system by the in­ conveniences incident to the locomotives hitherto employed. No one pro­ fesses a livelier admiration than he for these masses, almost intelligent, which accomplish prodigies far exceeding any human power. At the same time, no one is more strongly persuaded that the “ last word” of railroad industry has not yet been pronounced. Without mentioning the explosions, the collisions, the dangers from fire, and from running off the track— in short, the numerous accidents to which the ordinary system is liable— there are three principal reasons which prevent it from being always and everywhere effective. In the first place, the locomotives, acting only by the adherence of wheels to the rails, require lines very nearly upon a level, and thus impose a necessity of extensive removals of earth, and of costly constructions of tunnels and viaducts, which threaten, sooner or later, fatal catastrophes. Thus, mountainous districts are deprived of the advantages of that rapid movement afforded by railroads. Besides, this action of the locomotives only by the adherence of wheels to the rails, requires a useless weight, which is comparatively nothing on the great lines where traffic is considerable, but which becomes burdensome on small branch lines, and is, in effect, a serious impediment to their formation in sufficient numbers. Finally, the numerous railroads which begin to cover the European conti­ nent with their iron net-work, must be supplied by pit-coal, which serves also for the steamers that plough the rivers and seas, and for those cities that are lit by gas. But this coal does not reproduce itself within the bosom of the earth, and its sources, as appears already in Belgium, (the richest country, in this respect, on the continent,) are by no means inex­ haustible. Influenced by these considerations, M. Andraud has devoted years to the search of means of replacing the uncertain, expensive, and dangerous system at present employed, by one of sure, cheap, and universal applica­ tion. In his opinion, air compressed and reposited (comyrimi et emmagasint) suffices for all requisite purposes. He believes Providence has ma­ nifestly designed that man shall one day find all the mechanical forces necessary for his wants in the immense and inexhaustible reservoir of the air from which he draws his life, and not by greedily disembowelling the earth—impious toil, against which Nature daily protests, by some horrible catastrophe. After having demonstrated, by a long series of preparatory experiments, that the aerial fluid can be used as a moving force in all kinds of labor, he directed his attention especially to its application on railroads. In 1844, he succeeded in making a locomotive operate, by compressed air, upon an ordinary railroad. This, however, was only a partial solution of the problem. Fire and its dangers were made to disappear, but many difficulties were yet unremoved. Since that period, he has sought to per­ fect his process by suppressing locomotives entirely, so that he has at length been able to dispense with all useless weight, to clear ascents of Andraud's New System o f Railroad Locomotion. 41 from 40 to 50 millimetres* by metre, and to move in curves with small radii of from 80 to 100 metres. M. Andraud is confident that his system reposes upon incontestable principles, and comprehends all the possibili­ ties of perfection reserved for the admirable industry of railroads. By royal ordinance, dating the 10th of January, 1846, a concession of the short line from Arnieres to Argentenil has been accorded to him for his experiments. Suppose (says the inventor, in describing his system,) a tube, running the whole length of a road, between two iron rails. This tube, composed of a solid and of a flexible part, is fastened at every yard, by strong iron pins, to the cross-pieces, or cross-ties. The stiff or solid part is a piece of cast-iron, or a plank of hard, metalized wood, placed on the ground, with its two lateral faces hollowed out, and presenting on the left and on the right two flat-bottomed grooves. These grooves are covered by two long bands of leather, or of strong stuff’s prepared in solutions of caout­ chouc, (India-rubber,) and attached to the plank by their edges, in such a manner that they can be alternately applied to the bottom of the grooves, and expanded. Thus arranged, the tube is composed of two twin-tubes, which, when the air is injected, expand, and when it is withdrawn, be­ come flat. This being understood, imagine a train of cars, without locomotives, and at the head of the first car two vertical rollers turning on parallel axes, and having the faculty of tightening strongly against each other by elastic pressure. These rollers, of highly polished bronze, are so formed as to fit exactly in the two lateral grooves of the tube. The conductor can tighten or loosen the rollers at pleasure. It is easy to see that if, behind the train, the air, proceeding from a reservoir in which it is compressed, be injected into the tube, or the two twin-tubes, the latter will expand as far as the two rollers that oppose the passage of the a ir ; but the air con­ tinuing to dilate the flexible bands, these bands, in expanding, give to the two rollers a rotatory movement, and impel the whole train onwards, with a force, proportioned to the size of the tube, or the greater or less conden­ sation of the air. Each longitudinal fibre of the tube acts, in developing itself upon each corresponding section of the rollers, like a cord on a pulley— not a particle of the air is lost. The peculiarity of the- system, then, is in the propelling tube, composed, as we have seen, of a solid and of a flexible p a r t; and in the two rollers, or piston-laminoir, (as the inventor calls them,) which act on the exterior of the tube. The most striking circumstance in the invention, is its ex­ treme simplicity. An objection that the tubes cannot long resist the action of the rollers, is answered by the success during the past year of numerous experiments, which show that the tubes are capable of resisting a pressure five or six times greater than that to which they are ordinarily subjected; and that the most frequent and prolonged action produces scarcely any perceptible alteration. It will, of course, be necessary to renew the tubes at the end of a certain number of years, inasmuch as everything passes away in time ; but this renewal will be neither difficult nor expensive. It has also been objected that, in the long propelling tubes, a progressive loss of * The English value of a millimetre is 0,03937 inch; of a metre, 3,2808992 feet, or 1,093633 yard. 42 Andraud’s New System o f Railroad Locomotion. force will be occasioned by the friction of the air. But it must be ob­ served that the tube closed by the piston-laminoir is nothing more than a recipient, which gradually expands as the air is introduced ; and, as the rapidity of the fluid is little more than twenty yards a second, the friction will be very slight, in the first place. Moreover, the tube will be so arranged as to act only by sections of about a thousand yards each ; and thus the inconvenience in question, even if it existed, would be considera­ bly diminished. Besides the propelling tube (tube-propulseur) which is between the two rails of the road, another tube, entirely metallic, and hermetically sealed, is placed parallel to it, alongside of the road. This will be the recipient of air, or tube-reservoir, and may be either buried, like gas-pipes, or, in order to be more easily repaired, be laid along the ground. A single fixed machine, placed at some point on the line, and acting upon forcing-pumps, will compress the air into this tube, and keep it continually fed at a pres­ sure of two or three atmospheres, which will be sufficient. This fixed machine, sufficing for the whole line, can be put in motion by any kind of force—hydraulic power, windmills, the muscular force of animals, or by steam-engines ; which will, of course, be preferable wherever coal is abundant and cheap. The two parallel tubes communicate with each other at each section of about a thousand yards, by means of pipes with double cocks, for going and for returning. Among other arrangements, M. Andraud believes that he can obtain motions of equal rapidity on different inclinations, without changing the pressure of the air, simply by making more or less deep the lateral grooves of the tube-propulseur—the grooves in which the rollers act. Between the system of M. Andraud and that of atmospheric railways, there is a certain analogy, which might lead to their being confounded. Both systems resort to a i r ; but this is the only characteristic which they have in common. Without entering into the details of the differences be­ tween them, or comparing their respective advantages and disadvantages, it will here suffice to say that atmospheric railroads use rarefied air, (which cannot be magazined,) and act by aspiration, or suction; while M. An­ draud’s wind-roads (che mins a vent) employ condensed air, and work by insufflation. The atmospheric roads, by-the-way, are forced to employ powerful steam-engines, stationed at very short distances—a heavy addi­ tional item to the great costliness of their construction, In conclusion, the system which has been described claims the following advantages:— Complete absence of danger from explosion, fire, collision, or running off the track. Extreme ease of traction, which will permit travellers to make long journeys with comparatively little fatigue ; and even, in wagons constructed for the purpose, to pursue the ordinary occupations of their dwellings. The power of clearing declivities and winding around hills, thus secu­ ring that variety which will restore its lost poetry to travelling. Economy of about three-fourths of the expense of actual locomotion. Finally, the possibility of some day being freed from the slavery of coal, which is consumed without reproduction, and of finding, in the inexhausti­ ble power of wind and of water, the means of rendering the vast service of railroads everywhere and always available. The Consular System o f the United States. 43 One of the most useful applications that M. Andraud thinks can be made of his new system, is the establishment of railways in the vicinity and in the interior of cities, in such a manner that the most rapid motion can be secured, without damage to the activity and safety of habitual circulation. He proposes that, in place of a double rail extending along the ground, a beam, supported at a certain height, from distance to distance, by posts, shall reach the whole length of the line to be passed over. A single rail is to be placed upon the upper part of th;s beam. The wagon, composed of two compartments, is a sort of double palanquin, suspended. As the centre of gravity is below the upper rail, perfect stability is secured, and accidents are impossible. The two lateral faces of the beam-rail (le poutre rail) support the tube-propulseur; the tube-reservoir is buried at the foot of the posts. The height of the posts will, of course, be such as to permit free passage beneath them to foot-passengers and to carriages. On the whole, the system of M. Andraud is not unworthy of serious attention ; and I have thought that a somewhat detailed account of it would be interesting to the friends of practical science in our own country. I have been informed that the inventor has secured a patent in the United States, as well as in France and in Great Britain. w. s. c. Paris, March 8th, 1847. Art. IV.— THE CONSULAR SYSTEM OP THE UNITED STATES. A L E T T E R FROM A N A M ER IC A N CONSUL ABROAD TO T H E E D IT O R OF T H E m e r c h a n t s ’ M A G A Z IN E, E T C . S ir —The consular establishment of the United States having at differ­ ent times occupied the pen of some of the contributors to your valuable Magazine, perhaps you will allow one, who writes from the antipodes, to submit his views on that important subject through your pages. He will endeavor to be as concise as possible. That the office of consul is an important and very responsible one, no one acquainted with commercial matters will be inclined to dispute ; but that it is incompatible with commercial pursuits, I deny. Nay, I assert that, with regard to ourselves, the office is best in the hands of our mer­ chants residing abroad, for reasons which I shall presently state. As far as the experience of some forty years has enabled me to judge of our consuls in different quarters of the world, I long ago came to the conclusion, that they would bear comparison with the same officials of other countries, as men enjoying high public consideration in their re­ spective stations ; as intelligent and well-informed functionaries, which made them in the time of need useful counsellors to their countrymen ; and as persons receiving their full share of attention from the authorities by which they were accredited. It may be, that their occupation allowed them not the leisure to play the courtiers, as they might have done had they been mere salaried public servants ; but in most instances this was a happy circumstance, as it kept them out of that round of intrigue and scandal de bureaux, which not unfrequently makes the presence of stran­ gers not only embarrassing but dreaded. As to dignified and appropriate bearing, I would ask those who think so strangely of a man’s playing the sugar or fine goods merchant, at one hour, and the consul at another, 44 The Consular System o f the United States. whether our newspapers—which everybody knows are prone enough to give currency to gossip, true or false, in the shape of “ letters from abroad,”— ever treat their readers with such dirty morsels of scandal about their own consuls as have been served up to the public by some of these “ salaried” and “ highly educated gentlemen,” who “ render such special service to their country and to science ?” It is useless to go half a century back, when our own times furnish us with notable examples, which the records of Texas present, in the squabbles of the French consul with the owner of some straying pigs ; in Macao, between the count, consul-general and another French official; or in Manilla, between the British consul and British merchants and ship-masters. And how many more examples might be easily cited, which would all tend to raise our merchant consuls in the estimation of foreigners. It has been said, that the French specially obtain through their consuls a mass of valuable commercial information. If such is the fact, it seems strange that the French government is constantly fitting out expensive commercial delegations into foreign countries to report on their capabili­ ties for a French trade. There are not wanting French consuls in the further East, yet the French minister to China had half a dozen commer­ cial delegates in his train. But the fact is, that very few French, British, Spanish, Portuguese, and other “ paid consuls,” are in a position to be really useful to their country or their countrymen ; and mainly, because, with all the zeal and devotion which is to be found in them generally, for their country’s advancement, they do not possess the proper requirements, which are to be obtained only by men practically acquainted with com­ merce. Unacquainted themselves with trade, they present long lists of inquiries to their mercantile acquaintance, who fill up the blank spaces with replies; but whether these replies are anym ore true or luminous than those which human nature has drawn from the American consul, is left as a matter lor the reader’s consideration. As to that part of a con­ sul’s duty which not unfrequently calls upon him to be the adviser, coun­ sellor, or defender of his countrymen— in ninety cases out of a hundred growing out of commercial differences— to say that the services of a prac­ tical merchant are not better than that of one who knows nothing of busi­ ness, is so glaring an absurdity, that the wonder is how it can be made by a rational being 1 I have said that the office of consul is best in the hands of our mer­ chants. This opinion has been already partly supported; but there are other strong reasons why it should be so. In the first place, the remuneration which is proposed, and which does not exceed $2,500, is inadequate to uphold the dignity of the office. The consuls of France have $3,000 to $8,000 ; those of England seldom un­ der £1,000, and in very many instances double that sum per annum. These are the two principal commercial nations, and it is with their con­ suls that our consuls more generally associate. To place one of our offi­ cials in a condition of social inferiority, would be to place him in an un­ desirable one, for he could not receive attentions when unable to return them. Should he be a family man, he would be obliged to live in retire­ ment ; and such a mode of life, in most instances, would greatly curtail his official consideration, and limit his influence with the authorities of his station. Republican simplicity of living may go down very well at home, but this is a style little understood by Europeans; and he who The Consular System o f the United States. 45 gives no dinners or soirees meets with much unpalatable formality and stiffness in his daily walks. It is probable, therefore, that this office would not be sought for by the proper kind of persons. I have said $2,500 as the highest. Who would be the seekers for berths of less value ? Why, most likely, in the second place, by men of desperate fortunes; many of them active politicians, as they are called, who, after having served their candidates at the election polls, would claim a consulate as the reward of service—to such a one $1,500 or $2,000 a year would seem untold wealth. Nearly one whole year’s salary, however, would be anticipated in outfits— consular dress, dresses for his family, if he has one, and in passage money. The new functionary would arrive at his station. He might have been a doctor, or kept a country store, or been a lawyer, or anything else before he became the active politician ; but, salaried as he is, does it make him the person fitted to advise, counsel, and defend his needy countrymen in commercial matters, or is he qualified to keep his government informed on matters of trade ? And let it be asked of those who are so anxious that our consuls should be salaried, and not practical merchants, whether the nine men out of the ten who would alone seek and obtain such livings, would be likely to be the men we would delight to honor, love, and re­ spect ? In a short four years, if he managed to go at large for so long a time, a new set of men, at home, would come in office, and new consular appointments would be made to satisfy new claimants for services, and our consul would be obliged to find his way back, but little richer in purse or reputation than when he left his country. Indeed, the new consular system seems to inspire so little confidence among its projectors themselves, that it is gravely proposed by one of them to appoint one or more inspectors, whose duty it would be to go the rounds of the different consular stations, to see, by personal inspection, that these functionaries faithfully and honestly earn their yearly stipends ! What man, possessed of a particle of gentlemanly feelings, would accept of an office which would subject him to a system of espionage, as disgusting as it is unknown to the American people in any branch of their civil admin­ istration ? The present consular establishment is coeval with our political existence. It has, with few exceptions, been entrusted to our mercantile fellow-citizens residing abroad; and although all the appointments cannot have been happy ones, yet it has generally done good service, without costing the government one dollar in the way of salaries. The fees of the greatest part of our consuls are so trifling, as to be hardly sufficient to meet their office expenses, and therefore they must look to their exertions as mer­ chants for their daily support, the expenses of which are increased by the mode of living which the consular appointment compels them to adopt. It is reasonable to conclude, that it would be quite impossible for persons of very ordinary abilities, or of questionable character, to carry on mer­ cantile dealings to an extent, the profits of which would not enable them to support such expenses. The business of the most part of our consuls is agency or commission, and obtained only through good character and business talents. Now, as without these qualifications the stream of pros­ perity does not flow, it results, that he who does not possess them must give up to him who does; and hence the honorable position occupied by most of our consuls— a position which, as has been already said, loses nothing by comparison with similar officials of other countries. 46 Commercial Cities and Towns o f the United States. But let Congress attach a salary to the appointment, and the country will be represented abroad, I fear me, by a very different set of persons; mere traders in politics, be they Whigs, Tories, Locofocos, or any other agitators floating on the surface of circumstances.

ROCHESTER: ITS MILLS, FACTORIES, \\ etc. T h is growing city affords no inferior specimen of the success of Yankee enterprise, and the rapidity of Yankee improvement. Having drawn many of its leading citizens from New England, the habits, views, principles, and tastes of their birth-place have been brought with them, and have greatly contributed to make the once famous emporium of the flour business one of the handsomest flowers in our land; having a population now greater than many of the oldest cities of Europe—than Oxford, Cambridge, Exeter, and Greenwich, in E ngland; than Rochelle or Bayonne, in F ran ce; than Salamanca, Bilboa, Badajoz, or Burgos, in Spain; than Pisa or Mantua, in Italy ; than any city in Norway or Wales.
