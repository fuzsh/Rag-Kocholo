        "text": "The following list and accompanying photographs identify those iconic ironmaking blast furnace stacks that remain standing in the United States. Most of these monumental structures were built between the 1770s and 1880s. The quality of their construction (mostly with a cut stone exterior and a fire brick interior) is a testament to surviving time, wear, vandalism, neglect, and weather since being shut down. A number of others have been lovingly and painstakingly restored by local, state, and federal historic preservation organizations.\n\nReasons for iron furnaces being taken out of blast (shut down) ranged from depleted resources (both iron and/or timber); financial downturns and panics, both locally and nationally; and the development of new techniques for producing iron and steel products, such as the Bessemer process.\n\nAny additions, suggestions, or corrections to the list below are most appreciated. The list does not include those furnace stacks that have been destroyed, removed, demolished, or have deteriorated into ruins as a simply a base or rubble. Sadly, there are many examples of stone iron furnace stacks that have been lost to time and history.\n\nNote: NRHP = National Register of Historic Places\n\nALABAMA\n\nBrierfield Furnace (1861) – Brierfield Ironworks Historical State Park, Brierfield, AL: 36-foot tall stone stack – many bricks were taken from the site during WW II era – added to the NRHP in 1974\n\nCornwall Furnace (1863) – Cornwall Furnace Memorial Park, Cedar Bluff, AL: stone – added to the NRHP in 1972\n\nJanney Furnace (1863) – Janney Furnace Park, Ohatchee, AL: 50-foot tall stone stack – added to NRHP in 1976\n\nShelby Iron Works Furnace (1875 or 1889) – Shelby Iron Works Park, Shelby, AL: brick stack\n\nTannehill Ironworks Furnace Stacks #1, #2, and #3 (1862) – Tannehill Historical State Park, McCalla, AL: three 30-foot tall stone stacks – added to NRHP in 1972 (see photo above)\n\nCONNECTICUT\n\nBeckley Furnace (1847) – Beckley Furnace State Industrial Monument/Park, East Canaan, CT: 32-foot tall marble stack – added to the NRHP in 1978 – very well maintained (see photo at the top of the post)\n\nKent Iron Furnace (1826) – Kent, CT – stone stack that has been restored and is in good condition – added to the NRHP in 1977\n\nLime Rock Furnace #2 – Salisbury, CT: stone stack – appears from photos to be on private property, but is well-preserved\n\nMount Riga Furnace (1810s) – Salisbury, CT: rock stack hat has been restored several times – iron for the USS Constitution produced here – added to he NRHP in 1994\n\nRoxbury Furnace (1867) – Mine Hill Preserve, Roxbury, CT: restored stone stack – well-preserved – added to the NRHP in 1979 (see photo above)\n\nGEORGIA\n\nBear Mountain (New Stack) Furnace (ca 1850) – stone stack\n\nCooper’s Iron Works Furnace (1830s) – Etowah/Cartersville, GA: stone stack (see photo above)\n\nDonaldson (Shoal Creek) Furnace (ca 1860) – Cherokee County, GA: stone stack but in poor condition\n\nLewis (Oak Grove) Iron Furnace (1847) – Bartow County, GA: stone stack\n\nPool Furnace (1855) – stone stack\n\nUnion (Diamond) Iron Furnace (1852) – Bartow County, GA: stone stack but in poor condition\n\nILLINOIS\n\nIllinois Iron Furnace (ca 1838/ reconstructed in 1967) – Shawnee National Forest, Rosiclare, IL: 40-foot tall stone stack – added to the NRHP in 1973 (see photo above)\n\nKENTUCKY\n\nBelmont Furnace (1853) – Shepherdsville, KY: originally 33-foot tall stone stack – has deteriorated\n\nBoone Furnace (1857) – Grayson, KY: 40-foot tall stone stack\n\nBourbon (Old Slate) Furnace (1791) – Owingsville, KY: 25-30 foot tall stone stack\n\nBuffalo Furnace (1851/2) – Greenbo State Park, KY: originally a 36-foot tall stall, but has significant deterioration\n\nClear Creek (Bath) Furnace (1873) – Salt Lick, KY: stone stack\n\nCottage Iron Furnace (1854) – Irvine, KY: 35-foot tall stone stack – added to the NRHP in 1973\n\nEstill Furnace (1849) – Ravenna, KY: stone stack in deteriorated condition\n\nFitchburg (Red River) Furnaces (1869) – Estill County, KY: two 60-foot tall stone stacks – added to the NRHP in 1974 and is owned and maintained by the US Forest Service (see photo above)\n\nHunnewell Furnace – Hunnewell, KY: in poor condition\n\nLaurel Furnace (1849) – Old Town, KY: 39-foot tall stone stack\n\nMount Savage Iron Furnace (1848) – Mt.
