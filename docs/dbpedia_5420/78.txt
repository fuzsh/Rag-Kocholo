Central European Summer Time (CEST) is one of the names of the Daylight saving time offset using the UTC offset of UTC+02:00, 2 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. It is used as a summer daylight saving time in most European countries. During the winter, Central European Time (UTC+1) is used. Central European Summer Time may also be also known under other names, such as Middle European Summer Time (MEST), Central European Daylight Saving Time (CEDT) or 'Bravo time'.

Since 1996 European Summer Time has been observed between 1:00 UTC on the last Sunday of March and 1:00 on the last Sunday of October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union.[1]
