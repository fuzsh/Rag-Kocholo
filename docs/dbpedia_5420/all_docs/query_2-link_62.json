        "text": "In this paper, the variation in forest cover in the central Mediterranean region, reflected by percentage changes in the arboreal pollen record, has been examined in relation to the 4.2 ka event. A total of 36 well-dated and detailed pollen records from latitudes between 45 and 36 • N were selected and their vegetation dynamics between 5 and 3 ka examined in relation to the physiographic and climatic features of the study area and to the influence of human activity on past vegetation, as suggested by anthropogenic pollen indicators. We have found that the sites located between 43 and 45 • N do not show any significant vegetation change in correspondence with the 4.2 ka event. Several sites located on the Italian Peninsula between 39 and 43 • N show a marked opening of the forest, suggesting a vegetation response to the climate instability of the 4.2 ka event. Between 36 and 39 • N, a forest decline is always visible around 4.2 ka, and in some cases it is dramatic. This indicates that this region was severely affected by a climate change towards arid conditions that lasted a few hundred years and was followed by a recovery of forest vegetation in the Middle Bronze Age. Human activity, especially intense in southern Italy, may have been favored by this natural opening of vegetation. In Sar-dinia and Corsica, no clear change in vegetation is observed at the same time. We suggest that during the 4.2 ka event southern Italy and Tunisia were under the prevalent influence of a north African climate system characterized by a persistent high-pressure cell.\n\nA new sedimentary sequence from Lago di Venere on Pantelleria Island, located in the Strait of Sicily between Tunisia and Sicily was recovered. The lake is located in the coastal infra-Mediterranean vegetation belt at 2 m a.s.l. Pollen, charcoal and sedimentological analyses are used to explore linkages among vegetation, fire and climate at a decadal scale over the past 1200 years. A dry period from AD 800 to 1000 that corresponds to the ‘Medieval Warm Period’ (WMP) is inferred from sedimentological analysis. The high content of carbonate recorded in this period suggests a dry phase, when the ratio of evaporation/precipitation was high. During this period the island was dominated by thermophilous and drought-tolerant taxa, such as Quercus ilex, Olea, Pistacia and Juniperus. A marked shift in the sediment properties is recorded at AD 1000, when carbonate content became very low suggesting wetter conditions until AD 1850–1900. Broadly, this period coincides with the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA), which was characterized by wetter and colder conditions in Europe. During this time rather mesic conifers (i.e. Pinus pinaster), shrubs and herbs (e.g. Erica arborea and Selaginella denticulata) expanded, whereas more drought-adapted species (e.g. Q. ilex) declined. Charcoal data suggest enhanced fire activity during the LIA probably as a consequence of anthropogenic burning and/or more flammable fuel (e.g. resinous Pinus biomass). The last century was characterized by a shift to high carbonate content, indicating a change towards drier conditions, and re-expansion of Q. ilex and Olea. The post-LIA warming is in agreement with historical documents and meteorological time series. Vegetation dynamics were co-determined by agricultural activities on the island. Anthropogenic indicators (e.g. Cerealia-type, Sporormiella) reveal the importance of crops and grazing on the island. Our pollen data suggest that extensive logging caused the local extinction of deciduous Quercus pubescens around AD 1750.\n\nIt is well-known that the Holocene exhibits a millennial-scale climate variability. However, its periodicity, spatio-temporal patterns and underlying processes are not fully deciphered yet. Here we focus on the central and western Mediterranean. We show that recurrent forest declines from the Gulf of Gaeta (central Tyrrhenian Sea) reveal a 1860-yr periodicity, consistent with a ca. 1800-yr climate fluctuation induced by large-scale changes in climate modes, linked to solar activity and/or AMOC intensity. We show that recurrent forest declines and dry events are also recorded in several pollen and palaeohydrological proxy-records in the south-central Mediterranean. We found coeval events also in several palaeohydrological records from the southwestern Mediterranean, which however show generally wet climate conditions, indicating a spatio-temporal hydrological pattern opposite to the south-central Mediterranean and suggesting that different expressions of climate modes occurred in the two regions at the same time. We propose that these opposite hydroclimate regimes point to a complex interplay of the prevailing or predominant phases of NAO-like circulation, East Atlantic pattern, and extension and location of the North African anticyclone. At a larger geographical scale, displacements of the ITCZ, modulated by solar activity and/or AMOC intensity, may have also indirectly influenced the observed pattern. Understanding the long-term trends and spatial patterns of climate variability in the current interglacial period, the Holocene, is crucial to assess the significance of ongoing climate change and future projections. Furthermore, taking into account the commonality of processes and mechanisms shared by climate models at all timescales, understanding the low frequency (millennial) component of past climate change is ultimately essential for improved predictions on all timescales. While it is well-known that the Holocene exhibits a millennial-scale climate variability, its periodicity, spatio-temporal patterns and underlying processes are not fully deciphered yet.\n\nThe history of vegetation in the Italian peninsula during the last 2000 years was shaped by a complex interplay of several factors, including the history of human societies, changes in land use, and the succession of climate events. In order to disentangle these factors, we present a multidisciplinary record from a marine core collected in the Gulf of Gaeta, interpreted in the light of other palaeoenvironmental records from Tyrrhenian Italy. Pollen records, complemented by new data on Non-Pollen Palynomorphs (NPPs) and microcharcoal, are used to reconstruct changes in the vegetational landscape, stock-breeding activities, fire, and land use. Foraminiferal and oxygen isotope data provide independent information on climate changes. NAO-index and sunspot data support the interpretation of changes in atmospheric circulation. In this paper, by examining the effect of climate and human activity on the landscape during a series of periods of the last 2000 years, representing cultural or climate phases (Roman Period, Dark Ages, Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age, and Modern Period), we found that human impact produced a general and progressive decline of forest vegetation. However, irrespective of the societal cultural phase, forest declines occurred when negative NAO oscillations induced dry climate, especially during sunspot minima.\n\nThe ongoing increase in the global mean temperature at an unprecedented recorded rate is well documented. Nevertheless, knowledge of past climate variations is fundamental for a better understanding of ongoing climate change. This need is crucial in high mountain areas, where the effects of global warming are amplified and induce an accelerated glacial retreat. Thus, the use of climatic proxies such as tree-ring width offers tools to better understand the environmental dynamics in remote, sensitive sites. Here, we present the “Bosco Antico” site chronology, a six-century long dataset from the most ancient living stand in the Val di Sole area (southern Rhaetian Alps, Italy), and its relationship with summer mean temperatures. The analyses were performed on earlywood and latewood separately, as well as on tree-ring widths using static and moving correlations. The results showed that tree-rings and earlywood width are linked with June temperatures, whereas latewood width is mainly driven by July temperatures. All the analysed series were greatly influenced by June to July and June to August temperatures. Finally, a mean summer latewood-based temperature reconstruction since 1525 is proposed. It highlighted that during the last six hundred years, the summer temperatures span between -2.3 to +1.9 °C compared to the 1960–90 mean temperature (between 6.2 and 10.4 °C at the stand elevation). The coolest phase is recorded in the 1810s-20s underlining the strongest pulse of the Little Ice Age; other phases of negative anomalies are recorded in the first half of the 17th century, around 1700, and 1900 and during the 1970s. Our results add an important dataset for a specific climatic area, providing new information that will contribute to a better understanding of the climate dynamics for the study site as well as on a larger scale."
