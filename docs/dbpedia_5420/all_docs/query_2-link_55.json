        "text": "This paper is about a pilot study which has been carried out at the Near East University during the 2004/5 Fall Semester using the Moodle LMS together with GREWPtool collaborative editor. The system has been tested with 36 students taking the Java and the Pascal programming courses. The results of the pilot study showed that a Learning Management System can be made more efficient if it is enhanced by a collaborative learning tool. Our results have also shown that programming languages such as Pascal and Java can be thought successfully in a web-based environment using an LMS system together with a collaborative tool. Keywords: Learning management systems(LMS), programming languages, Java, Pascal, web-based learning, collaborative learning, collaborative learning tool.\n\nThis paper reports ﬁndings from a study of undergraduates’ expectations about, and experiences of, networked learning using computer-mediated conferencing (CMC). The data come from questionnaires administered at the start and end of four diﬀerent courses, and their interpretation is informed by a set of interviews with students and teachers involved in these and other networked learning courses. Students’ views were generally positive at the start and at the end of each course, though they became more moderate over time. The structure of students’ reported feelings remained relatively stable over time. There was no evidence to suggest that male or younger students had more positive feelings about networked learning. The thoroughness with which CMC is integrated into a networked learning course appears as a signiﬁcant factor in explaining diﬀerences in students’ feelings about the worth and value of their experience. As might be expected, a well-integrated course was associated with more positive experiences. We present the design of a new web application framework for collaborative learning. The framework guides users (i.e. teachers) in implementing online activities based on well-known pedagogical techniques, and simplifies the development of collaboration tools needed to carry out those techniques. There are common tasks across various techniques and our framework organizes them in a layer of abstraction. The framework model has four abstraction layers: Pedagogical Models, Pedagogical Techniques, Collaboration Tasks Patterns, and CSCL Tools. By using this framework, developers will place the control of designing and implementing new functionalities in the teacher’s hand rather than in the software designer’s\n\nThe development of collaborative studies in learning has led to a renewed interest in the field of web-based education. In this experimental study, a highly interactive and collaborative teaching environment was created using Moodle, a learning management system with two types of Collaborative Tools (CTs): Standard CT and Advanced CT to create a virtual learning environment to teach programming languages, Java. 36 subjects were attending to this study. The experimental study was carried out between 2 different groups. Each group has 18 subjects who were randomly selected. Group1 used advanced and group2 used standard collaborative learning tool. The aim of this study was to find out the student opinions when using an advanced collaborative tool and a standard collaborative tool. The system developed has enabled students to follow the lessons in their own places of study, using their own computers. Data was collected at the end of the experimental study by Student Opinions in Relation to the Used Collaborative Tool and The Online Learning Opinion Scale instruments. The results show that the subjects using the standard and the advanced collaborative tool are interested and willing to try to use a collaborative tool.\n\nCooperative learning is a paradigm of collaboration aimed to reach a common goal. The trend of using social networks and social media to deliver and exchange knowledge leads us to believe that collaboration skills must be strongly promoted to empower users to learn with and from each other to support the educational challenges of this century. In this paper we discuss the primary needs of a modern educational system and we present the ETCplus project, a model of cooperation that has as its primary focus students&#39; cooperation in an academic environment. Two distinct experiments involving cooperative learning with two international universities are discussed. The first describes a system in an environment that is left to evolve autonomously. The second presents a system in a controlled environment that uses an accelerator to speed the learning process. The process of collaboration was built on a shared platform. Students&#39; feedback shows that cooperative learning produces bette...\n\nTeaching and learning methodologies in modern times are gradually changing and is no longer an art of transferring knowledge. It has become an enterprise to develop critical thinking, create positive interaction and collaboration among learners. In order to build good and successful computer programmers, the Collaborative teaching and learning method remains the best method of delivery. The population for this study consists of NCE I, II and III students from the Department of Computer Science Education of Aminu Saleh College of Education Azare, Bauchi State and 10 lecturers from the same department and school. A sample of 80 students and 10 lecturers was used for this study. A well-structured questionnaire titled “Effects of Collaborative Teaching and Learning on programming” was used to collect data for the study. The questionnaire items were validated by experts in the field of statistics and it was also tested and retested for reliability. Data collected were analyzed using mean to answer the research questions. The study revealed that there are great benefits in using the collaborative methods in teaching and learning programming. Such benefits include improvement of students’ academic performance, creation of positive interaction among students, and development of critical thinking abilities among others. The study also found that there are challenges associated with collaborative learning such as the formation of groups, the challenge of monitoring the group activities at once considering the limited time for the class, etc. The study recommends the integration of collaborative learning by computer educators so as to assist students in mastering programming. It also recommends that computer educators be proactive in grouping students so as to avoid imbalance. This will encourage more enthusiastic and active involvement by the students."
