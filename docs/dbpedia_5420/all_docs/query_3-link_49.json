Europe Standard Time still represent the entirety of the time zone - including periods that might be under daylight saving time (aka \"summer time\").\n\nYou should not choose a different time zone during the DST period.\n\nThere is only one caveat: Windows computers have a date/time setting called \"Adjust for daylight saving time automatically\". This is on by default, and in most cases should never be turned off. However, if a user has turned it off, then they will not get the benefit of the system understanding how to apply daylight time correctly."
