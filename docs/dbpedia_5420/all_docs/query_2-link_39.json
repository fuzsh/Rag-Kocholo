        "text": "Okra speed breeding Okra is an important crop in temperate and tropical climates. Okra is short day crop, first time we are working on speed breeding for short-day plant. We got interesting and encouraging results for okra speed breeding. We have conducted trail in complete indoor with controlled temperature, humidity, Co2, air flow and most important lights. Our objective is reducing the seed-to-seed time. First three trails we got failure due to improper nutrients management and climate control. Forth trails we got following promising results. · Seed to germination time: 3 days · Flower initiation is less than 20 days · Seed to flower time: 25 days · Seed to seed: 65 days We are hoping in next trail, seed to seed time can be reduced to under 50 days with our new designed protocol. #speedbreeding #CEA #okra #seed #rapidplantcycle #nexsel #nexselgrown\n\nIt brings us great joy to inform you that Rallis India Ltd. has been conferred with the Tata Innovista 2022 award for its' Novel genetic discovery of herbicide resistance in Maize. Rallis India R&D Seeds team has identified a set of DNA markers which can predict herbicide resistance in maize without any herbicide spray at any stage of its development. The technology platform developed in this project helps to accelerate and deliver improved maize products in 1.5 years in comparison to the conventional method which takes 4 long years. It is also translatable to other crops. Congratulations to the team! Dr Vairamani Ramanathan, Satish Kanuganti, Manish Kumar Patel, Lokesh H, Bharat Pawar, and Satish Rai.
