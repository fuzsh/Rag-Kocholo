For example, if you live in California, you live in the\n\nPacific time zone. If you live in North Carolina, you live in the Eastern Time\n\nZone.\n\nSo how do they work? Well, each time zone is\n\nexactly one hour behind each other (Hawaii is 2 hours behind Alaskan time), so\n\nif it's 4:00 p.m in the pacific time zone, it's 5 p.m in the mountain time zone,\n\nlike this:\n\n1:00 p.m Hawaii Time\n\n3:00 p.m Alaska Time\n\n4:00 p.m Pacific Time\n\n5:00 p.m Mountain Time\n\n6:00 p.m Central Time\n\n7:00 p.m Eastern Time\n\n*note* Arizona does NOT observe daylight's saving time. That means Arizona will not \"fall back\" or \"spring forward\" with the rest of America. It will remain on a constant time, so people in Arizona will be following the \"Mountain time\" until September, then they will be following the \"Pacific time\".\n\nCanada Time Zoneshttp://www.wizard101central.com/forums/picture.php?albumid=14760&pictureid=195141http://pirate101.centralforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=3104&d=1345048469\n\nhttp://pirate101.centralforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=3101&d=1345048389\n\nhttp://www.wizard101central.com/forums/picture.php?albumid=14760&pictureid=195146\n\nIf you live in Canada, find the area of the\n\nProvince or territory you live in and find which time zone you live in. Each Time zone is exactly one hour behind each\n\nother with a few exceptions:Notice I put mountain time and Saskatchewan\n\ntogether. This is because they have the same times. If it's 6:00 mountain time,\n\nit's also 6:00 Saskatchewan time. Also, Newfoundland is exactly 1 1/2 hour\n\nbehind the other time zones. Confused yet? Let's look at it this way:\n\nIf it's 4:00 p.m Pacific time then it is 5 p.m\n\nin Mountain time, like this:\n\n4:00 p.m Pacific time\n\n5:00 p.m Mountain time\n\n5:00 p.m Saskatchewan time\n\n6:00 p.m Central Time\n\n7:00 p.m Eastern Time\n\n8:00 p.m Atlantic Time\n\n9:30 Newfoundland Time\n\nUnited Kingdom Time Zones http://www.wizard101central.com/forums/picture.php?albumid=14760&pictureid=195147http://pirate101.centralforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=3104&d=1345048469\n\nhttp://www.wizard101central.com/forums/picture.php?albumid=14760&pictureid=195148\n\nhttp://pirate101.centralforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=3103&d=1345048434\n\nYou British guys may have to help me with this\n\none if I get it wrong-- According to my research, the whole area of Great\n\nBritain is located in the British Summer Time zone. Are there any other\n\ndivisions of time zones there?\n\n*OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDED IN THE BRITISH SUMMER TIME*\n\nEngland\n\nWales\n\nScotland\n\nPortugal\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nThe British Summer Time zone is exactly 5\n\nhours away from Eastern Time zone, so it looks like this all\n\ntogether:\n\n1:00 p.m Hawaii Time\n\n3:00 p.m Alaska time\n\n4:00 p.m Pacific time\n\n5:00 p.m Mountain time\n\n5:00 p.m Saskatchewan time\n\n6:00 p.m Central Time\n\n7:00 p.m Eastern Time\n\n8:00 p.m Atlantic Time\n\n9:30 Newfoundland Time\n\n12:00 a.m British Summer Time\n\nAustralian time Zoneshttp://pirate101.centralforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=3405&d=1345515388\n\nhttp://pirate101.centralforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=3406&d=1345515397\n\nThere are 3 time zones in Australia. They are exactly 1 hour apart from each other, so it turns out like this:\n\n1:00 p.m Australian Western Standard Time\n\n2:00 p.m Australian Central Standard Time\n\n3:00 p.m Australian Eastern Standard Time\n\nAll together:\n\nAustralian Western Standard time is exactly 24 hours from U.S.A Eastern Standard time, so it looks like this:\n\n1:00 p.m Hawaii Time\n\n3:00 p.m Alaska time\n\n4:00 p.m Pacific time\n\n5:00 p.m Mountain time\n\n5:00 p.m Saskatchewan time\n\n6:00 p.m Central Time\n\n7:00 p.m Eastern Time\n\n8:00 p.m Atlantic Time\n\n9:30 Newfoundland Time\n\n12:00 a.m British Summer Time\n\n7:00 a.m Western Australian Time\n\n8:00 a.m Central Australian Time\n\n9:00 a.m Eastern Australian Time\n\n*Information About Daylight Savings Time*\n\nDaylight savings time is observed March 11 at 2:00 am moving the hour forward 1 hour (Spring Forward)\n\nNovember 4 begins the Savings time moving the clock back 1 hour (Fall Back)\n\n*NOTE* Hawaii and Arizona DO NOT observe Daylight Savings time. Your clocks will remain the same\n\n*NOTE* ONLY Southeastern Australia (EAS) observes Daylight Savings time. All other areas formerly observed it but no longer do.\n\nHope this guide helped you guys out a little bit!\n\nFeel free to correct any mistakes I make"
