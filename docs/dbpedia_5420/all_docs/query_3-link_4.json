        "text": "Central European Time is one hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time standard, written as an offset of UTC + 1. That means to find the standard time in the zone, you must add one hour to Coordinated Universal Time.\n\nTerritories observing the time zone are primarily in Europe. It runs through the northern parts of Europe, and central Europe – including the UK – and northern Africa. In Europe, this time zone is also referred to as European Central Time (ECT), or Central Europe Time (CET). In Germany, the time zone is referred to as Mitteleuropäische Zeit or MEZ.\n\nDuring fall to winter months Central European Time, or CET is used, and then during Daylight Saving (spring to summer months) Central European Summer Time or CEST is used.\n\nLocations in Central European Summer Time Zone\n\nThe following areas are included in the time zone:\n\nEurope\n\nAlbania\n\nAndorra\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina\n\nCroatia\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGibraltar\n\nHoly See/Vatican City\n\nHungary\n\nItaly\n\nKosovo\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLuxembourg\n\nRepublic of Macedonia\n\nMalta\n\nMonaco\n\nMontenegro\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nSan Marino\n\nSerbia\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nAfrica\n\nAlgeria\n\nTunisia\n\nAntarctica\n\nTroll Station\n\nExceptions\n\nSome areas are split, which means that one portion of a territory may be in one time zone and the rest in another. Although the locations on the list above may have a portion in the Central European Summer Time zone, they may also have exceptions which are listed below.\n\nExceptions In Europe\n\nSpain – the Canary Islands follow Western European Time in the fall and winter months, and Western European Summer Time during the spring and summer months."
