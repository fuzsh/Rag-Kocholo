        "text": "Local time in Germany\n\nThe time in Germany is 2 hours ahead of UTC and the same as in Frankfurt am Main. The current timezone in Germany is Central European Summer Time (CEST). Germany is currently observing Daylight Saving Time (DST) also known as summer time. Daylight Saving Time in Germany ends at Oct. 27, 2024.\n\nDetails for the time in Germany\n\nCurrent time\n\n4:19 a.m.\n\nTime zone Central European Summer Time (CEST)\n\nStandard timezone: Central European Time (CET) IANA time zone Europe/Berlin Your time difference same time as Frankfurt am Main UTC time difference UTC+2\n\n2 hours ahead of UTC\n\nGermany Daylight Saving Time (DST)\n\nGermany uses Daylight Saving Time.

CET is UTC +0100 and CEST is UTS +0200. The longitude of Germanys eastern border is 15° 00' E. Therefore an one hour offset between UCT and CET is exactly as one would expect. Germany is of course one of the biggest countries in Europa. It takes the sun over half an hour to “travel” from Germanys eastern border to its western border. Germany latitude is 51° 00' N, it is therefore not surprising the country uses daylight savings time."
