        "text": "Astronomical ephemerides request form\n\nSet below the values for your geographical position (or the reference position to use to request the ephemerides). At startup they will be set by solving the IP address of your computer if possible. Daylight saving time is also automatically considered, although to use a time scale different from local time is recommended. If you prefer, you can also drag the map with the mouse and select a given position by clicking on it.\n\nLocation East longitude (°)\n\nNorth latitude (°)\n\nElevation (m)\n\nTime zone (without DST, h)\n\nYou can also select the location in the lists below, showing locations for Spain and for the entire world\n\nSet the interval of dates for the ephemerides calculation (or the same starting and ending dates for just one day). Date format is day-month-year, and can be introduced by hand or using the calendar . Time format is hour:minute:second, set by default to the values of your computer, in local time. Date should be later than year 1350 B.C. (-1350, using for example 1-1--1000 for January, 1, 1000 B.C.) and prior to 2998 A.D. (2998). Take into account that year 0 does not exist, neither dates between October, 5-14, 1582 (before October, 15, 1582 dates will be supposed to be in the Julian calendar).\n\nStarting date Initial time\n\nEnding date Final time\n\nSelect time scale\n\nSelect the time step between consecutive calculations\n\nSet the name of the object. Possible values are the Sun, Moon, the planets, Pluto, dwarf bodies, asteroids, comets, and natural satellites. Other objects like stars (for instance 'Vega'), space probes ('New Horizons'), and artificial satellites ('Zarya' for the International Space Station) are also allowed. For stars without a proper name it is possible to use the standard nomenclature based on the brightness of the star and the constellation where it is located, for instance 'Alp UMi' (or 'Polaris') for the Polar star (the alpha or brightest star in the constellation Little Bear). Note that the object could be not drawn in the charts if the apparent magnitude is very faint. You may also check the complete list of comets, asteroids, and transneptunian objects available (names appear on the right of each row for each object).\n\nObject name"
