        "text": "I have dealt with the simpler variant - people who send out notices for a \"Standard Time\" meeting before the time change for the first few weeks of \"Daylight Saving Time\", or for a \"Daylight Saving Time\" meeting before the time change for the first few weeks of \"Standard Time\". Confusion reigns supreme, even within a single physical time zone (e.g., US Eastern Time). Even before you get to the technical computer problems, far too many people don't understand. Really. Sadly.\n\nWhat I recommend, any time there is potential confusion, is to include the desired information in the text of the meeting invitation. In addition, a separate followup email can be helpful.\n\nInstead of the meeting title:\n\nNovember Budget Review\n\nmake it\n\nNovember Budget Review, 02:30 Central Europe Winter Time, UTC +1\n\nIf your primary contacts are in one specific time zone, include that as well:\n\nNovember Budget Review, Oct. 31, 02:30 Central Europe Winter Time, UTC +1, Atlanta Oct. 30, 21:30 Eastern Daylight Time\n\nIn this specific case, I would go with winter time rather than summer time, because summer time makes no sense after the first half hour.\n\nYou don't need to specify the time zone for every attendee of the meeting.\n\nOutlook stores internally the meeting time in UTC, which is globally known, and has no summer/winter times.\n\nOutlook uses the time-zone of the user to calculate his meeting time automatically.\n\nSo all you have to do is create the meeting in your time-zone. When the attendee enters the meeting in his calendar, the rest is automatic.\n\nFor detailed information see How time zone normalization works in Microsoft Outlook."
