The time offset from UTC can be written as +01:00. The same standard time, UTC+01:00, is also known as Middle European Time (MET, German: MEZ) and under other names like Berlin Time, Romance Standard Time, Paris Time or Rome Time.\n\nThe 15th meridian east is the central axis for UTC+01:00 in the world system of time zones.\n\nAs of 2011, all member states of the European Union observe summer time; those that use CET during the winter use Central European Summer Time (CEST) (or: UTC+02:00, daylight saving time) in summer (from last Sunday of March to last Sunday of October). The exceptions to this are only to Algeria and Tunisia, which use Central European Time all year round.\n\nSee also[]\n\nBritish Summer Time\n\nEastern Time Zone (North America)\n\nPacific Daylight Time\n\nCentral Daylight Time Zone\n\n[]"
