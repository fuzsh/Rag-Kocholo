        "text": "Neil Fuller via tz\n\nSince you've referenced CLDR already, I may be saying things you know, and\n\nyou're looking for an \"official position\" from IANA folks. If so, please\n\nfeel free to ignore the info below, I'm mostly just a lurker here who has\n\nbeen straddling a few different libraries for Android for a few years, so I\n\nappreciate some of the terminology / disconnects.\n\nBelow I'll refer to identifiers like \"Europe/London\" as the zone ID. I\n\nthink the TZDB nomenclature uses \"zone name\" for this, but I tend to avoid\n\nit because it's confusing in the Java / ICU world when also talking about\n\n\"display names\".\n\nSomebody who knows better will be along to correct me, but I think strings\n\nlike 'Central European Summer Time' are obtained in CLDR / ICU internals\n\nvia the \"metazone\" mapping, which CLDR originates.\n\ni.e. zone IDs that share the same \"Central European Summer Time\" string at\n\na given point in time are in the same metazone at that time. Zone IDs that\n\nhave the same offset + rules according to TZDB, even in the same country,\n\nmay have different metazones because the populace may choose to call\n\ntheir time something different even if they follow the same rules right\n\nnow. Across borders, two neighboring countries that share the same rules\n\nmay also choose to observe the same naming (e.g. the EU may like Central\n\nEuropean Time) or different (e.g. \"Irish Standard Time\" / \"British Summer\n\nTime\"). Because names have geopolitical implications, this can get a bit\n\ncomplicated (e.g. Crimea), which is why I'm glad CLDR looks after it. CLDR\n\nalso specifies times when a zone ID is in a metazone, so a given zone ID\n\nthat may be in one metazone today may be in a different metazone tomorrow\n\n(e.g. Yukon changes last year, IIRC).\n\nMetazone assignments often change to track TZDB changes, which can be seen\n\nif you look at the history for metazones.xml in Android (\n\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/cldr/common/supplemental/metaZones.xml;l=1;bpv=1\n\n)\n\nAll that said, metazones could perhaps be ignored as an implementation\n\ndetail used to derive a name for a zone ID. I tend to refer to names\n\nlike 'Central European Summer Time' as the (long) \"display name\". This is\n\nbecause I first encountered these via ICU and Java APIs which use the\n\nTimeZone getDisplayName method to obtain them and have constants for long\n\n(\"Mountain Daylight Time\") / short (\"MDT\") / generic long (\"Mountain\n\nTime\"), etc.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nNeil.\n\nPost by Michael\\[tm\\] Smith via tz\n\nIn the time zone taxonomy, if the term for âEurope/Berlinâ is clearly\n\nâtime zoneâ,\n\nand âGMT+2â is precisely a âtimezone offsetâ, is there a term (other than\n\nâtime\n\nzoneâ) for what âCentral European Summer Timeâ is â either an\n\nauthoritative/\n\nnormative term, or else at least a best-practice term thatâs commonly used?\n\nThe context is, Iâm updating some of the MDN documentation related to JavaScript\n\n*\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat\n\n*\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/formatToParts\n\nAnd in particular, Iâm working on trying to describe the timeZoneName property,\n\nTZ=Europe/Berlin node -e \"console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-us', \\\n\n{ timeZoneName: 'short' }).formatToParts())\"\n\n[\n\n{ type: 'month', value: '4' },\n\n{ type: 'literal', value: '/' },\n\n{ type: 'day', value: '13' },\n\n{ type: 'literal', value: '/' },\n\n{ type: 'year', value: '2021' },\n\n{ type: 'literal', value: ', ' },\n\n{ type: 'timeZoneName', value: 'GMT+2' }\n\n]\n\nSo part of what I want to explain in the MDN articles is: When you specify\n\nâtimeZoneName: 'short'â, what you get back as the value for the 'timeZoneName'\n\nfield in the output is actually a time zone *offset* â not a time zone.\n\nTZ=Europe/Berlin node -e \"console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-us',\n\n{ timeZoneName: 'long' }).formatToParts())\"\n\n[\n\n{ type: 'month', value: '4' },\n\n{ type: 'literal', value: '/' },\n\n{ type: 'day', value: '13' },\n\n{ type: 'literal', value: '/' },\n\n{ type: 'year', value: '2021' },\n\n{ type: 'literal', value: ', ' },\n\n{ type: 'timeZoneName', value: 'Central European Summer Time' }\n\n]\n\nThatâs the particular thing Iâm struggling with â that is, when you specify\n\nâtimeZoneName: 'long'â, what do I call the 'Central European Summer Time'\n\nthat you get back in the output?\n\nSomething like âa localized long name for the associated time zone offsetâ\n\nis the best Iâve been able to come up with. But Iâve been hoping there\n\nmight be some authoritative term for it that Iâve not managed to find yet.\n\nAnd I realize thereâs no âCentral European Summer Timeâ in the zoneinfo\n\ndata itself â and so implementations get that by doing some kind of lookup\n\nagainst (I guess) CLDR. So I guess itâs expected that the documentation for\n\nthe IANA timezone database itself doesnât have a term for it.\n\nAnd I guess itâs also unsurprising that CLDR seems to just use the term âtime\n\nzoneâ to refer to it â since CLDR doesnât need to bee more precise and since\n\nbecause CLDR doesnât need to do anything with the actual canonical time zone\n\nnames such as Europe/Berlin, it doesnât have the problem of distinguishing\n\nbetween what a time zone is and what time zone offset is.\n\nBut from what Iâve seen in issues and questions reported by developers at MDN\n\nand Stack Overflow, probably the single biggest source of chronic frustration\n\nthat developers have when dealing with date-related methods and properties\n\nin programming languages comes down to a fundamental misunderstanding of\n\nwhat a time zone is, and how it differs from time zone offset.\n\nSo Iâve admired what Matt Johnson-Pint has done at Stack Overflow in answering\n\nmany questions â and in putting the\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/tags/timezone/info\n\nand https://stackoverflow.com/tags/timezone-offset/info pages together â to\n\nprovide developers with the kind of clarity they need to solve their problems.\n\nAnd so what Iâm hoping to do with my MDN changes is to bring similar\n\nclarity to developers through MDN.\n\nAnd so also thatâs why it seems important to get the terminology right at MDN\n\nwhen explaining to developers exactly what âCentral European Summer Timeâ is.\n\nâMike\n\n--\n\nMichael[tm] Smith https://people.w3.org/mike\n\n--\n\nGoogle UK Limited\n\nRegistered Office: 6 Pancras Square, London, N1C 4AG\n\nRegistered in England Number: 3977902\n\nGuy Harris via tz\n\nIn the time zone taxonomy, if the term for “Europe/Berlin” is clearly “time zone”,\n\nPerhaps that's what's currently used, but I'm not convinced it *should* be used.\n\nI tend to refer to them as \"tzdb regions\", as they don't correspond to what I suspect most people think of as \"time zones\".\n\nA tzdb region may well be in different \"time zones\" in the sense of a given standard time offset from UTC (I think there are examples of that in the tzdb), and there may be more than one tzdb region with the same standard time offset from UTC, so they're in the same \"time zone\", but with different DST rules or with different histories of DST rules (for example, in the US some regions within a given \"time zone\" may not do DST while other regions within the same \"time zone\" do).\n\nand “GMT+2” is precisely a “timezone offset”, is there a term (other than “time\n\nzone”) for what “Central European Summer Time” is — either an authoritative/\n\nnormative term, or else at least a best-practice term that’s commonly used?\n\n\"Central European Summer Time\" isn't a \"time zone\", either. I have the impression that \"Central European Time\" is what the general public would cal a \"time zone\"; \"Central European Summer Time\" is \"time, in the Central European Time zone, when summer time is in effect\"; I'm not sure whether there's an English-language term used by the general public for items such as \"Central European Summer Time\", and don't know whether any other languages have a term for it."
