Could anyone explein to me how CET relates to our current, British Summer, time?\n\nI found this on wikipedia\n\nCentral European Time (CET), used in most of Europe, is one of the names of the time zone that is 1 hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), with a time offset of UTC+1 (in winter).\n\nMost European countries have adopted the use of Central European Summer Time (CEST) daylight saving time in summer, with UTC+2.\n\nWhich has just confused me even more to be honest.\n\nSo, if I'm in in British Summer time, and, let's just say for example, that a well known downhill race is being broadcast at 14:00 CET, what time is that in britain?\n\nAre they ahead of us by one or two hours?\n\n0"
