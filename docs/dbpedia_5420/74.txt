Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+02:00) (sometimes called Central European Daylight Time) is the name for a time zone. It is a daylight saving time.[1] Some of the countries that have Central European Time shift their clocks forward one hour, during the summer months and shift it one hour backwards during winter months.[2]

A research station called Troll in Antarctica uses this time zone in the winter, but uses Greenwich Mean Time in the summer.[3]
