        "text": "Assassinations have formed a major plot element in various works of fiction. This article provides a list of fictional stories in which assassination features as an important plot element. Passing mentions are omitted.\n\nAssassination can be regarded as the murder of a prominent person for a motive which is broadly public and political rather than merely personal or financial.[1]\n\nAssassinations in fiction have attracted scholarly attention. In Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy: Transformations in Society and Culture, as well as analyzing Italian assassinations in their historical and cultural contexts, Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi explore the films, plays, other works of fiction, and art that the act of assassination has inspired.[2] Nick Cullather has discussed \"The Movie Version\" of John F. Kennedy's assassination.[3]\n\nThis list prefers to highlight less familiar cultural artifacts, while trying not to itemize every Ian Fleming or Agatha Christie title, or every Mafia film.
