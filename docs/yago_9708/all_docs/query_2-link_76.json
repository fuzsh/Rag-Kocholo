We identified a case of sciatic neuropathy that occurred after bunionectomy during which a PNB had been performed. To understand the frequency of PNB-related sciatic neuropathy, we performed a retrospective review of sciatic neuropathies at our center over a 5-year period. Forty-five cases of sciatic neuropathy were reviewed. Similar to earlier reports, common etiologies of sciatic neuropathy, including compression, trauma, fractures, and hip arthroplasty, were noted in the majority of our cases (60%, n = 27). Unexpectedly, PNB was the third most common etiology (16%, n = 7). Our results suggest PNB is a relatively common etiology of sciatic neuropathy and is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis. These findings should urge electromyographers to assess history of PNB in sciatic neuropathies, particularly with onset after surgery. Muscle Nerve 56: 822-824, 2017.

Reports on sciatic neuropathy as the presenting manifestation of HNPP are very scarce. We report on a 21-year-old previously healthy man who was admitted with sensorimotor deficits in his left leg. He had no history of preceding transient episodes of weakness or sensory loss. Clinical and electrophysiological examinations were consistent with sciatic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid investigation and MRI of the nerve roots, plexus, and sciatic nerve did not indicate the underlying aetiology. When extended electrophysiological tests revealed multiple subclinical compression neuropathies in the upper limbs, HNPP was contemplated and eventually confirmed by genetic testing. 2014 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n\nSciatic neuropathy and rhabdomyolysis after carbon monoxide intoxication: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Hyeok Dong; Lee, Sung Young; Cho, Young-Shin; Han, Seung Hoon; Park, Si-Bog; Lee, Kyu Hoon\n\n2018-06-01\n\nPeripheral neuropathy is a rare complication of carbon monoxide intoxication. Peripheral neuropathy following carbon monoxide intoxication is known to completely recover within a few months. A 40-year-old man complained of motor weakness and hypoesthesia of the right lower extremity with swelling of his right thigh after carbon monoxide intoxication resulting from a suicide attempt. Following nerve conduction and electromyographic studies, the patient was diagnosed with sciatic neuropathy with severe axonopathy. Clinical and laboratory findings led to a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The patient was treated conservatively for rhabdomyolysis and underwent comprehensive rehabilitation for sciatic neuropathy during hospitalization. After discharge, he underwent serial follow-up tests with nerve conduction and electromyographic studies, which showed prolonged persistence of sciatic neuropathy; however, he showed significant improvement at his 26-month post-discharge follow-up. Patients presenting with peripheral neuropathy secondary to carbon monoxide intoxication may show variable recovery periods; however, a favorable prognosis can be expected regardless of the concomitant occurrence of rhabdomyolysis and/or compartment syndrome.\n\nMagnetic Resonance Neurography Visualizes Abnormalities in Sciatic and Tibial Nerves in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes and Neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nVaeggemose, Michael; Pham, Mirko; Ringgaard, Steffen; Tankisi, Hatice; Ejskjaer, Niels; Heiland, Sabine; Poulsen, Per L; Andersen, Henning\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis study evaluates whether diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance neurography (DTI-MRN), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density can detect and grade neuropathic abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 49) were included-11 with severe polyneuropathy (sDPN), 13 with mild polyneuropathy (mDPN), and 25 without polyneuropathy (nDPN)-along with 30 healthy control subjects (HCs). Clinical examinations, nerve conduction studies, and vibratory perception thresholds determined the presence and severity of DPN. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal (tibial nerve) nerve segments of the lower extremity. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated, as were T2 relaxation time and proton spin density obtained from DTI-MRN. All magnetic resonance findings were related to the presence and severity of neuropathy. FA of the sciatic and tibial nerves was lowest in the sDPN group. Corresponding with this, proximal and distal ADCs were highest in patients with sDPN compared with patients with mDPN and nDPN, as well as the HCs. DTI-MRN correlated closely with the severity of neuropathy, demonstrating strong associations with sciatic and tibial nerve findings. Quantitative group differences in proton spin density were also significant, but less pronounced than those for DTI-MRN. In conclusion, DTI-MRN enables detection in peripheral nerves of abnormalities related to DPN, more so than proton spin density or T2 relaxation time. These abnormalities are likely to reflect pathology in sciatic and tibial nerve fibers.

Schwann cells (SCs) are integral to peripheral nerve biology, contributing to saltatory conduction along axons, nerve and axon development, and axonal regeneration. SCs provide a microenvironment favoring vascular regeneration but their low survival ratio in hyperglycemic conditions suppress the function to promote nerve growth. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) promotes remyelination after peripheral nerve injury. The aim of this study was to identify the role of Nrf2 in SC-mediated functional recovery after sciatic nerve injury. We compared plasma inflammatory factors in diabetic patients (DN) with/without diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and assessed whether Nrf2 expression in SCs could repair peripheral nerve injury in a rat model. Nrf2, TLR4/NFÎºB signal pathway and apoptosis relative protein expression were detected by western blot. Apoptosis and angiogenesis were determined by immunofluorescence and tubule formation assay, respectively. Regenerated nerves were determined by transmission electron microscope. Higher levels of inflammatory factors and VEGF expression were found in DPN patients. Cellular experiments indicate that Nrf2 expression inhibits hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis and promotes angiogenesis by regulating the TLR4/NFÎºB signal pathway. Animal experiments show that nerve conduction velocity, myelin sheath thickness, and sciatic vasa nervorum are restored with transplantation of SCs overexpressing Nrf2. Taken together, the high survival ratio of SCs in a DPN rat model indicates that overexpression of Nrf2 restores nerve injury. Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

The factor is found most abundantly in myelinating Schwann cells in the adult sciatic nerve. Lack of neuronal growth factors has been proposed as one possible etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Growth factor replacement therapies are currently being evaluated as a treatment for motor neuron disease. In this report we determined whether the expression of CNTF in sciatic nerve differed in patients with motor neuron disease compared to controls or patients with another form ofmoreÂ Â» axonopathy. We identified 8 patients (7 with ALS and 1 with SMA) with motor neuron disease and 6 patients with diabetic motor neuropathy who had autopsy material available. Immunoperoxidase staining showed reduced CNTF expression in nerves of patients with motor neuron disease but not in patients with diabetic motor neuropathy. Decreased CNTF appears be associated with primary motor neuron disease rather than a generalized process of axon loss. This result supports suggestions that CNTF deficiency may be an important factor in the development of motor neuron disease. 20 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nProximal Neuropathy and Associated Skeletal Muscle Changes Resembling Denervation Atrophy in Hindlimbs of Chronic Hypoglycaemic Rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nJensen, Vivi F H; Molck, Anne-Marie; Soeborg, Henrik; Nowak, Jette; Chapman, Melissa; Lykkesfeldt, Jens; Bogh, Ingrid B\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPeripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetic hyperglycaemia. Insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (IIH) might potentially exacerbate or contribute to neuropathy as hypoglycaemia also causes peripheral neuropathy. In rats, IIH induces neuropathy associated with skeletal muscle changes. Aims of this study were to investigate the progression and sequence of histopathologic changes caused by chronic IIH in rat peripheral nerves and skeletal muscle, and whether such changes were reversible. Chronic IIH was induced by infusion of human insulin, followed by an infusion-free recovery period in some of the animals. Sciatic, plantar nerves and thigh muscle were examined histopathologically after four or eight weeks of infusion and after the recovery period. IIH resulted in high incidence of axonal degeneration in sciatic nerves and low incidence in plantar nerves indicating proximo-distal progression of the neuropathy. The neuropathy progressed in severity (sciatic nerve) and incidence (sciatic and plantar nerve) with the duration of IIH. The myopathy consisted of groups of angular atrophic myofibres which resembled histopathologic changes classically seen after denervation of skeletal muscle, and severity of the myofibre atrophy correlated with severity of axonal degeneration in sciatic nerve. Both neuropathy and myopathy were still present after four weeks of recovery, although the neuropathy was less severe. In conclusion, the results suggest that peripheral neuropathy induced by IIH progresses proximo-distally, that severity and incidence increase with duration of the hypoglycaemia and thatÂ these changes are partially reversible within four weeks. Furthermore, IIH-induced myopathy is most likely secondary to the neuropathy.

In this IRB-approved, HIPPA-compliant study, three readers performed a cross-sectional analysis of 3T lumbosacral plexus MRIs over an 18-month period. Image slices were evaluated at two levels (A and B). The sciatic nerve was outlined using a free hand region of interest tool on PACS. Proton-density fat fraction (FF) and cross-sectional areas were recorded. Inter-reader agreement was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Spearman correlation coefficients were used for correlations with age, BMI and height and Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess gender differences. A total of 67 patients were included in this study with male to female ratio of 1:1. Inter-reader agreement was good to excellent for FF measurements at both levels (ICC=0.71-0.90) and poor for sciatic nerve areas (ICC=0.08-0.27). Positive correlations of sciatic FF and area were seen with age (p value<0.05). Males had significantly higher sciatic intraneural fat than females (p<0.05). Fat quantification MRI is highly reproducible with significant positive correlations of sciatic FF and area with age, which may have implications for MRI diagnosis of sciatic neuropathy. â¢ MR proton density fat fraction is highly reproducible at multiple levels. â¢ Sciatic intraneural fat is positively correlated with increasing age (p < 0.05). â¢ Positive correlations exist between bilateral sciatic nerve areas and age (p < 0.05). â¢ Males had significantly higher sciatic intraneural fat than females (p < 0.05).\n\nVasculitic peripheral neuropathy induced by ischemia-reperfusion in the rat femoral artery involves activation of proinflammatory signaling pathway in the sciatic nerve.\n\nPubMed\n\nChung, Chih-Yang; Chang, Yi-Wei; Huang, Chun-Jen; Wang, Po-Kai; Wan, Hung-Chieh; Lin, Yi-Ying; Kao, Ming-Chang\n\n2017-08-24\n\nIschemia-reperfusion (IR) in the rat femoral artery has been proposed as an experimental model of vasculitic peripheral neuropathy (VPN) which presents neuropathic pain and peripheral nerve injury patterns observed clinically. This study investigates the involvement of the proinflammatory signaling pathway underlying the peripheral mechanisms of VPN. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to receive either a sham operation or IR. IR was induced by occluding the right femoral artery for 4h followed by reperfusion periods from 0 to 72h. The behavioral parameters were assessed at baseline as well as at days 1, 2 and 3 after reperfusion. The time-course analyses of proinflammatory mediators in the sciatic nerves were also performed on rats of the sham group or IR groups with reperfusion periods of 0, 2, 4, 24 and 72h, respectively. The behavioral data confirmed that this VPN model induced hindpaw mechano-allodynia and heat hyperalgesia as well as impaired hindpaw grip strength. The molecular data revealed that IR in the femoral artery activated the expression of nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) in the sciatic nerve indicating a neuroinflammatory response. Moreover, IR in the femoral artery increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² in the sciatic nerve. This study elucidated the novel time-course expression profiles of NF-ÎºB and proinflammatory cytokines in VPN induced by IR which may be involved in the development of neuropathic pain. Since NF-ÎºB is a key element during neuroinflammation, strategies targeting the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway may provide therapeutic potential against VPN induced by IR. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

They are particularly prone to aneurysmal degeneration, potentially leading to distal ischemia, sciatic neuropathy, or rarely rupture. Here, we describe a case of a ruptured PSA aneurysm managed by endovascular embolization. A 70-year-old man initially presented with acute left lower extremity ischemia. He was found to have a popliteal embolus originating from a complete persistent sciatic artery aneurysm. He underwent thrombolysis followed by a femoropopliteal bypass and ligation of the proximal popliteal artery to exclude the PSA. Four weeks later he re-presented with severe pain, a pulsatile buttock mass, and anemia in the setting of hemodynamic instability. A ruptured PSA aneurysm was confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA). This was managed emergently by endovascular exclusion of the inflow and outflow vessels using Amplatzer vascular plugs. His postoperative course was complicated by both a foot drop, likely secondary to sciatic nerve ischemia, and a buttock abscess. To our knowledge, this is the first report detailing the endovascular management of a ruptured PSA aneurysm. The etiology, management, and complications associated with the treatment of this rare vascular entity are discussed. Copyright 2010 Annals of Vascular Surgery Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The sciatic nerve may be injured by various different periprocedural mechanisms. The precise localization and extension of the nerve lesion, the determination of nerve continuity, lesion severity, and fascicular lesion distribution are essential for assessing the potential of spontaneous recovery and thereby avoiding delayed or inappropriate therapy. Adequate therapy is in many cases limited to conservative management, but in certain cases early surgical exploration and release of the nerve is indicated. Nerve-conduction-studies and electromyography are essential in the diagnosis of nerve injuries. In postsurgical nerve injuries, additional diagnostic imaging is important as well, in particular to detect or rule out direct mechanical compromise. Especially in the presence of metallic implants, commonly applied diagnostic imaging tests generally fail to adequately visualize nervous tissue. MRI has been deemed problematic due to implant-related artifacts after HRS. In this study, we describe for the first time the spectrum of imaging findings of Magnetic Resonance neurography (MRN) employing pulse sequences relatively insensitive to susceptibility artifacts (susceptibility insensitive MRN, siMRN) in a series of 9 patients with HRS procedure related sciatic nerve palsy. We were able to determine the localization and fascicular distribution of the sciatic nerve lesion in all 9 patients, which clearly showed on imaging predominant involvement of the peroneal more than the tibial division of the sciatic nerve. In 2 patients siMRN revealed direct mechanical compromise of the nerve by surgical material, and in one of these cases indication for surgical release of the sciatic nerve was based on siMRN. Thus, in selected cases of HRS related neuropathies, especially when surgical exploration of the nerve is considered, siMRN, with its potential to largely\n\nExtracellular Matrix Remodeling and Modulation of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress by Sulforaphane in Experimental Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoustafa, Passant E; Abdelkader, Noha F; El Awdan, Sally A; El-Shabrawy, Osama A; Zaki, Hala F\n\n2018-04-27\n\nThe peripheral nervous system is one of many organ systems that can be profoundly impacted in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy has a significant negative effect on patients' quality of life as it begins with loss of limbs' sensation and may result in lower limb amputation. This investigation aimed at exploring the effect of sulforaphane on peripheral neuropathy in diabetic rats. Experimental diabetes was induced through single intraperitoneal injections of nicotinamide (50Â mg/kg) and streptozotocin (52.5Â mg/kg). Rats were divided into five groups. Two groups were treated with saline or sulforaphane (1Â mg/kg, p.o.). Three diabetic groups were either untreated or given sulforaphane (1Â mg/kg, p.o.) or pregabalin (10Â mg/kg, i.p.). Two weeks after drugs' administration, biochemical, behavioral, histopathological, and immunohistochemical investigations were carried out. Treatment with sulforaphane restored animals' body weight, reduced blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and increased insulin levels. In parallel, it normalized motor coordination and the latency withdrawal time of tail flick test, increased the latency withdrawal time of cold allodynia test, and ameliorated histopathological changes. Treatment of sulforaphane, likewise, decreased sciatic nerve malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, interleukin-6, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 contents. Similarly, it reduced sciatic nerve DNA fragmentation and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor kappa-B p65. Meanwhile, it increased sciatic nerve superoxide dismutase and interleukin-10 contents. These results reveal the neuroprotective effect of sulforaphane against peripheral neuropathy in diabetic rats possibly through modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Graphical Abstract Diagram that illustrates the effects of sulforaphane in treating experimental diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Ultrasound-guided Intratissue Percutaneous Electrolysis (US-guided EPI) involves galvanic current transfer within the treatment target tissue (fibrosis) via a needle 0.30 to 0.33 mm in diameter. The galvanic current in a saline solution instantly develops the chemical process of electrolysis, which in turn induces electrochemical ablation of fibrosis. In this article, the interventional procedure is presented in detail, and both the strengths and limits of the technique are discussed. US-guided EPI eliminates the fibrotic accumulation that causes PHTrSNE, without the semimembranosus tendon or the sciatic nerve being directly involved during the procedure. The technique is however of limited use in cases of compression neuropathy. US-guided EPI is a technique that is quick to perform, minimally invasive and does not force the patient to suspend their activities (work or sports) to make the treatment effective. This, coupled to the fact that the technique is generally well-tolerated by patients, supports use of US-guided EPI in the treatment of PHTrSNE.\n\nComparison of peripheral nerve blockade characteristics between non-diabetic patients and patients suffering from diabetic neuropathy: a prospective cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaeriswyl, M; TaffÃ©, P; Kirkham, K R; Bathory, I; Rancati, V; Crevoisier, X; Cherix, S; Albrecht, E\n\n2018-06-02\n\nAnimal data have demonstrated increased block duration after local anaesthetic injections in diabetic rat models. Whether the same is true in humans is currently undefined. We, therefore, undertook this prospective cohort study to test the hypothesis that type-2 diabetic patients suffering from diabetic peripheral neuropathy would have increased block duration after ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block when compared with patients without neuropathy. Thirty-three type-2 diabetic patients with neuropathy and 23 non-diabetic control patients, scheduled for fore-foot surgery, were included prospectively. All patients received an ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block with a 30 ml 1:1 mixture of lidocaine 1% and bupivacaine 0.5%. The primary outcome was time to first opioid request after block procedure. Secondary outcomes included the time to onset of sensory blockade, and pain score at rest on postoperative day 1 (numeric rating scale 0-10). These outcomes were analysed using an accelerated failure time regression model. Patients in the diabetic peripheral neuropathy group had significantly prolonged median (IQR [range]) time to first opioid request (diabetic peripheral neuropathy group 1440 (IQR 1140-1440 [180-1440]) min vs. control group 710 (IQR 420-1200 [150-1440] min, p = 0.0004). Diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients had a time ratio of 1.57 (95%CI 1.10-2.23, p < 0.01), experienced a 59% shorter time to onset of sensory blockade (median time ratio 0.41 (95%CI 0.28-0.59), p < 0.0001) and had lower median (IQR [range]) pain scores at rest on postoperative day 1 (diabetic peripheral neuropathy group 0 (IQR 0-1 [0-5]) vs. control group 3 (IQR 0-5 [0-9]), p = 0.001). In conclusion, after an ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block, patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy demonstrated reduced time to onset of sensory blockade, with increased time to first opioid request when compared with patients without neuropathy.

However, there is no in vivo evidence regarding the mechanical effects of these techniques in the nerve stiffness. This study examined the immediate effects of a slump neurodynamics technique in the sciatic nerve shear wave velocity (SWV. i.e. an index of stiffness) using ultrasound-based elastography. Fourteen healthy participants were included in this experiment. Sciatic SWV and ankle passive torque were measured during a passive ankle dorsiflexion motion (2Â°/s), before and immediately after 3 minutes of slump neurodynamics technique, randomly applied to one lower limb. The contralateral limb served as control. The slump intervention did not change the sciatic SWV (P=0.78), nor the dorsiflexion passive torque (P=0.14), throughout the ankle dorsiflexion motion. Excellent values of intra-rater repeatability (ICC=0.88, 0.68-0.96), and low values of standard error of measurement (0.59 m/s, 0.35-1.15m/s), were observed for the SWV measurements. The sciatic nerve stiffness of healthy participants did not change immediately after a slump neurodynamics technique, suggesting a compliance of the neural tissue to tensile loads. However, these results ought to be confirmed using other neurodynamics techniques and in other populations (e.g. peripheral neuropathies).

While stimulus-induced behavioral assays are frequently used and important to examine allodynia (i.e. sensitivity to light mechanical touch; von Frey fiber test) other measures of behavior that reflect overall function are not only complementary to stimulus-induced responsive measures, but are also critical to gain a complete understanding of the effects of the pain model on quality of life, a clinically relevant aspect of pain on general function. Voluntary wheel running activity in rodent models of inflammatory and muscle pain is emerging as a reliable index of general function that extends beyond stimulus-induced behavioral assays. Clinically, reports of increased pain intensity occur at night, a period typically characterized with reduced activity during the diurnal cycle. We therefore examined in rats whether alterations in wheel running activity were more robust during the inactive phase compared to the active phase of their diurnal cycle in a widely used rodent model of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain, the sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) model. METHODS In adult male Sprague Dawley rats, baseline (BL) hindpaw threshold responses to light mechanical touch were assessed using the von Frey test prior to measuring BL activity levels using freely accessible running wheels (1 hr/day for 7 sequential days) to quantify distance traveled. Running wheel activity BL values are expressed as total distance traveled (m). The overall experimental design was: following BL measures, rats underwent either sham or CCI surgery followed by repeated behavioral re-assessment of hindpaw thresholds and wheel running activity levels for up to 18 days after surgery. Specifically, separate groups of rats were assessed for wheel running activity levels (1 hr total/trial) during the onset (within first 2\n\nTreatment of proximal hamstring tendinopathy-related sciatic nerve entrapment: presentation of an ultrasound-guided âIntratissue Percutaneous Electrolysisâ application\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMattiussi, Gabriele; Moreno, Carlos\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSummary Background Proximal Hamstring Tendinopathy-related Sciatic Nerve Entrapment (PHTrSNE) is a neuropathy caused by fibrosis interposed between the semimembranosus tendon and the sciatic nerve, at the level of the ischial tuberosity.

Conclusions The sciatic nerve stiffness of healthy participants did not change immediately after a slump neurodynamics technique, suggesting a compliance of the neural tissue to tensile loads. However, these results ought to be confirmed using other neurodynamics techniques and in other populations (e.g. peripheral neuropathies). Level of evidence III.

This study aimed to study the neuroprotective effect of duloxetine, a serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), in a mouse model of diabetic neuropathy. Nine weeks after developing of PDN, mice were treated with either saline or duloxetine (15 or 30â¯mg/kg) for four weeks. The effect of duloxetine was assessed in terms of pain responses, histopathology of sciatic nerve and spinal cord, sciatic nerve growth factor (NGF) gene expression and on the spinal expression of astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and microglia (CD 11 b). The present results highlighted that duloxetine (30â¯mg/kg) increased the withdrawal threshold in von-Frey test. In addition, both doses of duloxetine prolonged the licking time and latency to jump in the hot-plate test. Moreover, duloxetine administration downregulated the spinal expression of both CD 11 b and GFAP associated with enhancement in sciatic mRNA expression of NGF. The current results highlighted that duloxetine provided peripheral and central neuroprotective effects in neuropathic pain is, at least in part, related to its downregulation in spinal astrocytes and microglia. Further, this neuroprotective effect was accompanied by upregulation of sciatic expression of NGF. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is an important regulator of peripheral tissue oxygenation; however, the relationship between 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration and diabetic complications has not been studied in detail. This investigation focused on the relationship between red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and diabetic neuropathy, by measuring motor nerve conduction velocity and sciatic nerve blood flow in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The effect of treatment with niceritrol, a nicotinic acid derivative that acts as a vasodilator and reduces serum lipid concentrations, on 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration and diabetic neuropathy was also examined. Untreated diabetic rats had significantly lower concentrations of red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, higher concentrations of serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as well as reduced motor nerve conduction velocity and sciatic nerve blood flow, compared to untreated normal rats. Niceritrol prevented these abnormalities without correcting hyperglycemia in diabetic rats, but had no effect on these parameters in normal rats. Red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration and motor nerve conduction velocity showed a positive correlation with sciatic nerve blood flow and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, respectively. These observations suggest that ischemia/hypoxia plays an important role in the development of diabetic neuropathy, and that niceritrol has a therapeutic effect on this condition by improving endoneurial ischemia/hypoxia.\n\nDiabetic neuropathy: electrophysiological and morphological study of peripheral nerve degeneration and regeneration in transgenic mice that express IFNbeta in beta cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nSerafÃ­n, Anna; MolÃ­n, Jessica; MÃ¡rquez, Merce; Blasco, Ester; Vidal, Enric; Foradada, Laia; AÃ±or, Sonia; Rabanal, Rosa M; Fondevila, Dolors; Bosch, FÃ tima; Pumarola, MartÃ­\n\n2010-05-01\n\nDiabetic neuropathy is one of the most frequent complications in diabetes but there are no treatments beyond glucose control, due in part to the lack of an appropriate animal model to assess an effective therapy. This study was undertaken to characterize the degenerative and regenerative responses of peripheral nerves after induced sciatic nerve damage in transgenic rat insulin I promoter / human interferon beta (RIP/IFNbeta) mice made diabetic with a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) as an animal model of diabetic complications. In vivo, histological and immunohistological studies of cutaneous and sciatic nerves were performed after left sciatic crush. Functional tests, cutaneous innervation, and sciatic nerve evaluation showed pronounced neurological reduction in all groups 2 weeks after crush. All animals showed a gradual recovery but this was markedly slower in diabetic animals in comparison with normoglycemic animals. The delay in regeneration in diabetic RIP/IFNbeta mice resulted in an increase in active Schwann cells and regenerating neurites 8 weeks after surgery. These findings indicate that diabetic-RIP/IFNbeta animals mimic human diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, when these animals are submitted to nerve crush they have substantial deficits in nerve regrowth, similar to that observed in diabetic patients. When wildtype animals were treated with the same dose of STZ, no differences were observed with respect to nontreated animals, indicating that low doses of STZ and the transgene are not implicated in development of the degenerative and regenerative events observed in our study. All these findings indicate that RIP/IFNbeta transgenic mice are a good model for diabetic neuropathy.\n\nPolyol pathway, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes and diabetic neuropathy in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, J; Koh, N; Sakakibara, F; Hamada, Y; Wakao, T; Hara, T; Mori, K; Nakashima, E; Naruse, K; Hotta, N\n\n1995-12-27\n\nThe relationship between the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration in red blood cells as a biological indicator of tissue hypoxia and diabetic neuropathy, and the effect of a potent aldose reductase inhibitor, (2S,4S)-6-fluoro-2'5'-dioxospiro [chroman-4,4'-imidazolidine]-2-carboxamide (SNK-860), on both were investigated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetic rats demonstrated significantly delayed motor nerve conduction velocity and reduced sciatic nerve blood flow. Altered biochemical features in the sciatic nerves, including a marked accumulation of sorbitol and fructose, myo-inositol depletion and decreased Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity were also detected in diabetic rats. These defects were accompanied by a decrease in the red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration. Treatment with SNK-860 partially or completely ameliorated these abnormalities. These observations suggest that a decrease in the red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration is one of the factors contributing to tissue hypoxia, which results in diabetic neuropathy, and that this decrease is mediated through an aldose reductase inhibitor-sensitive pathway.\n\nProtective effects of methanolic extract of Juglans regia L. leaf on streptozotocin-induced diabetic peripheral neuropathy in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nNasiry, Davood; Khalatbary, Ali Reza; Ahmadvand, Hassan; Talebpour Amiri, Fereshteh; Akbari, Esmaeil\n\n2017-10-02\n\nOxidative stress has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), the most common and debilitating complications of diabetes mellitus. There is accumulating evidence that Juglans regia L. (GRL) leaf extract, a rich source of phenolic components, has hypoglycemic and antioxidative properties. This study aimed to determine the protective effects of Juglans regia L. leaf extract against streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy in rat. The DPN rat model was generated by intraperitoneal injection of a single 55Â mg/kg dose of streptozotocin (STZ). A subset of the STZ-induced diabetic rats intragastically administered with GRL leaf extract (200Â mg/kg/day) before or after the onset of neuropathy, whereas other diabetic rats received only isotonic saline as the same volume of GRL leaf extract. To evaluate the effects of GRL leaf extract on the diabetic neuropathy various parameters, including histopathology and immunohistochemistry of apoptotic and inflammatory factors were assessed along with nociceptive and biochemical assessments. Degeneration of the sciatic nerves which was detected in the STZ-diabetic rats attenuated after GRL leaf extract administration. Greater caspase-3, COX-2, and iNOS expression could be detected in the STZ-diabetic rats, which were significantly attenuated after GRL leaf extract administration. Also, attenuation of lipid peroxidation and nociceptive response along with improved antioxidant status in the sciatic nerve of diabetic rats were detected after GRL leaf extract administration. In other word, GRL leaf extract ameliorated the behavioral and structural indices of diabetic neuropathy even after the onset of neuropathy, in addition to blood sugar reduction. Our results suggest that GRL leaf extract exert preventive and curative effects against STZ-induced diabetic neuropathy in rats which might be due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties.

We evaluated sensory-motor neuropathy and nerve regeneration following sciatic nerve crush in NOD males rendered diabetic by multiple low doses of streptozotocin, in comparison with similarly treated Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) mice, a widely used model for type I diabetes. Neurophysiological values for both strains showed a decline in motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity at 7 and 8 weeks after induction of diabetes in the intact hindlimb. However, amplitudes of compound muscle and sensory action potentials (CMAPs and CNAPs) were significantly reduced in NOD but not in ICR diabetic mice. Morphometrical analysis showed myelinated fiber loss in highly hyperglycemic NOD mice, but no significant changes in fiber size. There was a reduction of intraepidermal nerve fibers, more pronounced in NOD than in ICR diabetic mice. Interestingly, aldose reductase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activities were increased already at 1 week of hyperglycemia, persisting until the end of the experiment in both strains. Muscle and nerve reinnervation was delayed in diabetic mice following sciatic nerve crush, being more marked in NOD mice. Thus, diabetes of mid-duration induces more severe peripheral neuropathy and slower nerve regeneration in NOD than in ICR mice.

The etiology of most aging-related peripheral neuropathy is unknown. Inherited defects in several genome maintenance mechanisms cause tissue-specific accelerated aging, including neurodegeneration. We tested the hypothesis that a murine model of XFE progeroid syndrome, caused by reduced expression of ERCC1-XPF DNA repair endonuclease, develops peripheral neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies revealed normal nerve function in young adult (8 week) Ercc1(-/Î) mice, but significant abnormalities in 20 week-old animals. Morphologic and ultrastructural analysis of the sciatic nerve from mutant mice revealed significant alterations at 20 but not 8 weeks of age. We conclude that Ercc1(-/Î) mice have accelerated spontaneous peripheral neurodegeneration that mimics aging-related disease. This provides strong evidence that DNA damage can drive peripheral neuropathy and offers a rapid and novel model to test therapies. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The intent of the present study was to investigate the effect of combination of a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst (PDC), FeTMPyP and a PARP inhibitor, 4-ANI against diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The end points of evaluation of the study included motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and nerve blood flow (NBF) for evaluating nerve functions; thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia for assessing nociceptive alterations, malondialdehyde and peroxynitrite levels to detect oxidativemoreÂ Â» stress-nitrosative stress; NAD concentration in sciatic nerve to assess overactivation of PARP. Additionally immunohistochemical studies for nitrotyrosine and Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) was also performed. Treatment with the combination of FeTMPyP and 4-ANI led to significant improvement in nerve functions and pain parameters and also attenuated the oxidative-nitrosative stress markers. Further, the combination also reduced the overactivation of PARP as evident from increased NAD levels and decreased PAR immunopositivity in sciatic nerve microsections. Thus, it can be concluded that treatment with the combination of a PDC and PARP inhibitor attenuates alteration in peripheral nerves in diabetic neuropathy (DN).Â«Â less\n\nMatrix metalloproteinase-2 is downregulated in sciatic nerve by streptozotocin induced diabetes and/or treatment with minocycline: Implications for nerve regeneration\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAli, Sumia; Driscoll, Heather E.; Newton, Victoria L.; Gardiner, Natalie J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMinocycline is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and has been shown to have analgesic effects. Whilst increased expression of MMPs is associated with neuropathic pain, MMPs also play crucial roles in Wallerian degeneration and nerve regeneration. In this study we examined the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1/-2 in the sciatic nerve of control and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats treated with either vehicle or minocycline by quantitative PCR and gelatin zymography. We assessed the effects of minocycline on nerve conduction velocity and intraepidermal nerve fibre (IENF) deficits in diabetic neuropathy and investigated the effects of minocycline or MMP-2 on neurite outgrowth from primary cultures of dissociated adult rat sensory neurons. We show that MMP-2 is expressed constitutively in the sciatic nerve in vivo and treatment with minocycline or diabetes leads to downregulation of MMP-2 expression and activity. The functional consequence of this is IENF deficits in minocycline-treated nondiabetic rats and an unsupportive microenvironment for regeneration in diabetes. Minocycline reduces levels of MMP-2 mRNA and nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, in vivo minocycline treatment reduces preconditioning-induced in vitro neurite outgrowth following a sciatic nerve crush. In contrast, the addition of active MMP-2 facilitates neurite outgrowth in the absence of neurotrophic support and pre-treatment of diabetic sciatic nerve substrata with active MMP-2 promotes a permissive environment for neurite outgrowth. In conclusion we suggest that MMP-2 downregulation may contribute to the regenerative deficits in diabetes. Minocycline treatment also downregulates MMP-2 activity and is associated with inhibitory effects on sensory neurons. Thus, caution should be exhibited with its use as the balance between beneficial and detrimental outcomes may be critical in assessing the benefits of using\n\nActivation of Neuregulin 1/ErbB Signaling Is Involved in the Development of TOCP-Induced Delayed Neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Hai-Yang; Wang, Pan; Sun, Ying-Jian; Xu, Ming-Yuan; Zhu, Li; Wu, Yi-Jun\n\n2018-01-01\n\nOrganophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) is characterized by progressive axonal degeneration and demyelination of the spinal cord and sciatic nerves. The neuregulin 1/epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB) signaling pathway is crucial for axonal myelination. In this study, we investigated whether the neuregulin 1/ErbB signaling pathway mediated the progression of OPIDN. Adult hens were given tri- o -cresyl phosphate (TOCP), a typical neuropathic organophosphorus compound, to induce OPIDN. The ErbB inhibitor lapatinib was administered to hens 4 h prior to and 4 days after TOCP exposure. The neuregulin 1/ErbB signaling pathway was examined for their role in maintaining spinal cord and sciatic nerve fiber integrity. Schwann cell line sNF96.2 was used as the in vitro cell model. The in vivo results showed that TOCP (750 mg/kg body weight, p.o .) induced prominent ataxia and significant axon degeneration in the spinal cord and sciatic nerves. Lapatinib (25 mg/kg body weight, p.o .) treatment attenuated OPIDN clinically and histopathlogically and partially prevented the TOCP-induced activation of neuregulin 1/ErbB signaling pathway. Lapatinib also prevented the TOCP-induced inhibition of neuropathy target esterase (NTE), a key enzyme during the development of OPIDN, and the disturbed metabolism of phosphatidylcholine in sciatic nerves. In addition, lapatinib was shown, in vitro , to protect sNF96.2 cells from TOCP-induced dedifferentiation through neuregulin 1/ErbB signaling. Our results suggest that neuregulin 1/ErbB, through regulation of NTE activity in the peripheral nervous system, mediates the progression of OPIDN. Thus, this signal may serve as a potential target for the treatment of OPIDN.\n\nInsulin-induced upregulation of lipoprotein lipase in Schwann cells during diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nRachana, Kuruvanthe S; Manu, Mallahalli S; Advirao, Gopal M\n\n2018-03-17\n\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the major complications associated with diabetes. It is characterized by the degeneration of the myelin sheath around axons, referred to as demyelination. Such demyelinations are often caused by reduced lipid component of the myelin sheath. Since, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) provides the lipid for myelin sheath by hydrolysing the triglyceride rich lipoproteins, and also helps in the uptake of lipids by the Schwann cells (SCs) for its utilization, LPL is considered as the important factor in the regeneration of myelin sheath during diabetic neuropathy. Earlier reports from our laboratory have provided the insights of insulin and its receptor in SCs during diabetic neuropathy. In order to evaluate the long term effect of insulin on lipid metabolism during diabetic neuropathy, in this study, we analyzed the expression of LPL in SCs under normal, high glucose and insulin treated conditions. A decrease in the expression of LPL was observed in SCs of high glucose condition and it was reversed upon insulin treatment. Histochemical observations of sciatic nerve of insulin treated neuropathy subjects showed the improved nerve morphology, signifying the importance of insulin in restoring the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy.

We investigated the expression of MMP-2, -9 and TNF-Î± and correlated it with pathological changes in sciatic nerve tissue from Campylobacter jejuni-induced chicken model for GBS. Campylobacter jejuni and placebo were fed to chickens and assessed for disease symptoms. Sciatic nerves were examined by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Expressions of MMPs and TNF-Î±, were determined by real-time PCR, and activities of MMPs by zymography. Diarrhea developed in 73.3% chickens after infection and 60.0% of them developed GBS like neuropathy. Pathology in sciatic nerves showed perinodal and/or patchy demyelination, perivascular focal lymphocytic infiltration and myelin swelling on 10th- 20th post infection day (PID). MMP-2, -9 and TNF-Î± were up-regulated in progressive phase of the disease. Enhanced MMP-2, -9 and TNF-Î± production in progressive phase correlated with sciatic nerve pathology in C.Â jejuni-induced GBS chicken model. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the electrical stimulation threshold for a motor response of the sciatic nerve is increased in patients suffering from diabetic foot gangrene compared to non-diabetic patients. Prospective non-randomised trial with two parallel groups. Two university-affiliated hospitals. Patients scheduled for surgical treatment of diabetic foot gangrene (nâ=â30) and non-diabetic patients (nâ=â30) displaying no risk factors for neuropathy undergoing orthopaedic foot or ankle surgery.

The non-diabetic patients were younger [64 (SD 12) vs. 74 (SD 7) years] and predominantly female (23 vs. 8). The geometric mean of the motor stimulation threshold was 0.26 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.24 to 0.28]âmA in non-diabetic and 1.9 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.2)âmA in diabetic patients. The geometric mean of the electrical stimulation threshold was significantly (Pâ<â0.001) increased by a factor of 7.2 (95% CI 6.1 to 8.4) in diabetic compared to non-diabetic patients. The electrical stimulation threshold for a motor response of the sciatic nerve is increased by a factor of 7.2 in patients with diabetic foot gangrene, which might hamper nerve identification.\n\nNerve Wrapping of the Sciatic Nerve With Acellular Dermal Matrix in Chronic Complete Proximal Hamstring Ruptures and Ischial Apophyseal Avulsion Fractures\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaus, Brian M.; Arora, Danny; Upton, Joseph; Micheli, Lyle J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground: Patients with chronic injuries of the proximal hamstring can develop significant impairment because of weakness of the hamstring muscles, sciatic nerve compression from scar formation, or myositis ossificans. Purpose: To describe the surgical outcomes of patients with chronic injury of the proximal hamstrings who were treated with hamstring repair and sciatic neurolysis supplemented with nerve wrapping with acellular dermal matrix. Study Design: Retrospective case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Fifteen consecutive patients with a diagnosis of chronic complete proximal hamstring rupture or chronic ischial tuberosity apophyseal avulsion fracture (mean age, 39.67 years; range, 14-69 years) were treated with proximal hamstring repair and sciatic neurolysis supplemented with nerve wrapping with acellular dermal matrix. Nine patients had preoperative sciatica, and 6 did not. Retrospective chart review recorded clinical outcomes measured by the degree of pain relief, the rate of return to activities, and associated postoperative complications. Results: All 15 patients were followed in the postoperative period for an average of 16.6 months. Postoperatively, there were 4 cases of transient sciatic nerve neurapraxia. Four patients (26%) required postoperative betamethasone sodium phosphate (Celestone Soluspan) injectable suspension USP 6 mg/mL. Among the 9 patients with preoperative sciatica, 6 (66%) had a good or excellent outcome and were able to return to their respective activities/sports; 3 (33%) had persistent chronic pain. One of these had persistent sciatic neuropathy that required 2 surgical reexplorations and scar excision after development of recurrent extraneural scar formation. Among the 6 without preoperative sciatica, 100% had a good or excellent outcomes and 83% returned to their respective activities/sports. Better outcomes were observed in younger patients, as the 3 cases of persistent chronic sciatic pain were in patients older than 45\n\nNeuroprotective effects of Gymnema sylvestre on streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nFatani, Amal Jamil; Al-Rejaie, Salim Salih; Abuohashish, Hatem Mustafa; Al-Assaf, Abdullah; Parmar, Mihir Yogeshkumar; Ola, Mohammad Shamsul; Ahmed, Mohammed Mahboobuddin\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThe application of traditional medicine for diabetes and associated complications, such as diabetic neuropathy (DN), has received increasing attention.

Proposed mechanisms of neuronal damage caused by diabetes that are downstream of hyperglycemia and/or loss of insulin signaling include ischemic hypoxia, inflammation and loss of neurotrophic support. The curcumin derivative J147 is a potent neurogenic and neuroprotective drug candidate initially developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions associated with aging that impacts many pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. Here, we demonstrate efficacy of J147 in ameliorating multiple indices of neuropathy in the streptozotocin-induced mouse model of type 1 diabetes. Diabetes was determined by blood glucose, HbA1c, and insulin levels and efficacy of J147 by behavioral, physiologic, biochemical, proteomic, and transcriptomic assays. Biological efficacy of systemic J147 treatment was confirmed by its capacity to decrease TNFÎ± pathway activation and several other markers of neuroinflammation in the CNS. Chronic oral treatment with J147 protected the sciatic nerve from progressive diabetes-induced slowing of large myelinated fiber conduction velocity while single doses of J147 rapidly and transiently reversed established touch-evoked allodynia. Conduction slowing and allodynia are clinically relevant markers of early diabetic neuropathy and neuropathic pain, respectively. RNA expression profiling suggests that one of the pathways by which J147 imparts its protection against diabetic induced neuropathy may be through activation of the AMP kinase pathway. The diverse biological and therapeutic effects of J147 suggest it as an alternative to the polypharmaceutical approaches required to treat the multiple pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to diabetic neuropathy.

Fisetin was administered (5 and 10Â mg/kg) for 2Â weeks (7th and 8th week) post STZ administration. Thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia were assessed by measuring tactile sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli, respectively. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) was determined using power lab system and sciatic nerve blood flow (NBF) was determined using laser Doppler system. Nerve sections were processed for TUNEL assay and NF-ÎºB, COX-2 immunohistochemical staining. Sciatic nerve homogenate was used for biochemical and Western blotting analysis. MNCV and sciatic NBF deficits associated with DN were ameliorated in fisetin administered rats. Fisetin treatment reduced the interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in sciatic nerves of diabetic rats (pÂ <Â 0.001). Protein expression studies have identified that the therapeutic benefit of fisetin might be through regulation of redox sensitive transcription factors such as nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB). Our study provides an evidence for the therapeutic potential of fisetin in DN through simultaneous targeting of NF-ÎºB and Nrf2.\n\nStructure and stability of internodal myelin in mouse models of hereditary neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAvila, Robin L; Inouye, Hideyo; Baek, Rena C; Yin, Xinghua; Trapp, Bruce D; Feltri, M Laura; Wrabetz, Lawrence; Kirschner, Daniel A\n\n2005-11-01\n\nPeripheral neuropathies often result in abnormalities in the structure of internodal myelin, including changes in period and membrane packing, as observed by electron microscopy (EM). Mutations in the gene that encodes the major adhesive structural protein of internodal myelin in the peripheral nervous system of humans and mice--P0 glycoprotein--correlate with these defects. The mechanisms by which P0 mutations interfere with myelin packing and stability are not well understood and cannot be provided by EM studies that give static and qualitative information on fixed material. To gain insights into the pathogenesis of mutant P0, we used x-ray diffraction, which can detect more subtle and dynamic changes in native myelin, to investigate myelin structure in sciatic nerves from murine models of hereditary neuropathies. We used mice with disruption of one or both copies of the P0 gene (models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like neuropathy [CMT1B] or Dejerine-Sottas-like neuropathy) and mice with a CMT1B resulting from a transgene encoding P0 with an amino terminal myc-tag. To directly test the structural role of P0, we also examined a mouse that expresses P0 instead of proteolipid protein in central nervous system myelin. To link our findings on unfixed nerves with EM results, we analyzed x-ray patterns from unembedded, aldehyde-fixed nerves and from plastic-embedded nerves. From the x-ray patterns recorded from whole nerves, we assessed the amount of myelin and its quality (i.e. relative thickness and regularity). Among sciatic nerves having different levels of P0, we found that unfixed nerves and, to a lesser extent, fixed but unembedded nerves gave diffraction patterns of sufficient quality to distinguish periods, sometimes differing by a few Angstroms. Certain packing abnormalities were preserved qualitatively by aldehyde fixation, and the relative amount and structural integrity of myelin among nerves could be distinguished.

CMT disease signs include distal limb neuropathy, abnormal gait, sensory defects, and deafness. We generated a novel line of CMT2E mice expressing hNF-LE397K, which displayed muscle atrophy of the lower limbs without denervation, proximal reduction in large caliber axons, and decreased nerve conduction velocity. In this study, we challenged wild type, hNF-L, and hNF-LE397K mice with crush injury to the sciatic nerve. We analyzed functional recovery by measuring toe spread and analyzed gaitusing the Catwalk system. hNF-LE397K mice demonstrated reduced recovery from nerve injury consistent with increased susceptibility to neuropathy observed in CMT patients. In addition, hNF-LE397K developed a permanent reduction in their ability to weight bear, increased mechanical allodynia, and premature gait shift in the injured limb, which led to increasingly disrupted interlimb coordination in hNF-LE397K. Exacerbation of neuropathy after injury and identification of gait alterations in combination with previously described pathology suggests that hNF-LE397K mice recapitulate many of clinical signs associated with CMT2. Therefore, hNF-LE397K mice provide a model for determining the efficacy of novel therapies.

Peripheral neuropathy is a well-known side effect of cisplatin and has potential to result in limiting and/or reducing the dose, decreasing the quality of life. Thus, effective treatments are needed. Agmatine is an endogenous neuromodulator that has been shown to exert antiallodynic effects in various animal studies. The first aim of this study was to investigate the inÂ vitro effects of agmatine on cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. Primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) which are the primary target of drug injury were prepared. DRG cells were incubated with cisplatin (100, 200, 500Â Î¼m). Then, agmatine (10, 100, 500Â Î¼m) was administered with the submaximal concentration of cisplatin. Cisplatin caused concentration-dependent neurotoxicity, and agmatine did not alter this effect. The second aim was to investigate the effects of agmatine on cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats and the influence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME, in this effect. Female Sprague Dawley rats received intraperitoneal saline (control), cisplatin (3Â mg/kg), cisplatin+agmatine (100Â mg/kg), or cisplatin+agmatine+L-NAME (10Â mg/kg) once a week for 5Â weeks. The mechanical allodynia, hot plate, and tail clip tests were performed, and DRG cells and sciatic nerves were analyzed. Agmatine and agmatine+L-NAME combination attenuated CIS-induced mechanical allodynia and degeneration in DRG cells and sciatic nerves. However, L-NAME did not potentiate the antiallodynic or neuroprotective effect of agmatine. These findings indicate that agmatine co-administration ameliorates cisplatin-induced neuropathy and may be a therapeutic alternative.

However, the underlying mechanism of protection in nerve ischemia provided by TTF is still unclear. We hypothesized that TTF alleviates DPN via inhibition of ICAM-1 expression. Therefore, we tested the effect of TTF in a previously established DPN model, in which nerve injury was induced by ischemia/reperfusion in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. We found that the conduction velocity and amplitude of action potentials of sciatic nerve conduction were reduced in the DPN model group but were rescued by TTF treatment. In addition, TTF treatment also attenuated the effect of DPN on other parameters including histology and ultrastructural changes, expression of ICAM-1, MPO, and TNF-Î± in rat sciatic nerves, and plasma sICAM-1 and MPO levels. Together, our data suggest that TTF treatment may alleviate DPN via ICAM-1 inhibition.

Reports relate this neurotoxic effect to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Carvedilol is an antihypertensive drug, has also been appreciated for its antioxidant and mitoprotective properties. Carvedilol co-treatment did not reduce the anti-tumor effects of oxaliplatin in human colon cancer cells (HT-29), but exhibited free radical scavenging activity against oxaliplatin-induced oxidative stress in neuronal cells (Neuro-2a). Hence, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of carvedilol in the experimental model of oxaliplatin-induced peripheralmoreÂ Â» neuropathy (OIPN) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Oxaliplatin reduced the sensory nerve conduction velocity and produced the thermal and mechanical nociception. Carvedilol significantly (P < 0.001) attenuated these functional and sensorimotor deficits. It also counteracted oxidative/nitrosative stress by reducing the levels of nitrotyrosine and improving the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase expression in both sciatic nerve and DRG tissues. It improved the mitochondrial function and prevented the oxaliplatin-induced alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential in sciatic nerve thus prevented loss of intra epidermal nerve fiber density in the foot pads. Together the results prompt the use of carvedilol along with chemotherapy with oxaliplatin to prevent the peripheral neuropathy. - Graphical abstract: Schematic representation neuroprotective mechanisms of carvedilol in oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. - Highlights: â¢ Oxaliplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction causes neurotoxicity. â¢ Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to bioenergetic and functional deficits. â¢ Carvedilol alleviated oxaliplatin-induced behavioural and functional changes. â¢ Targeting mitochondria with carvedilol attenuated neuropathic\n\nExacerbation of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2E neuropathy following traumatic nerve injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nVillalÃ³n, Eric; Dale, Jeffrey M; Jones, Maria; Shen, Hailian; Garcia, Michael L\n\n2015-11-19\n\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most commonly inherited peripheral neuropathy.

Epidemiological figures of the prevalence are unknown, but are estimated to be about 12.2% to 27%. There is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria. Advancement in magnetic resonance imaging allows us to observe unilateral hyperintensity and bowing of the sciatic nerve. The pathophysiology of the disease includes single blunt trauma, overuse causing piriformis hypertrophy, and long-term microtrauma causing scarring. Treatments include physiotherapy, steroid injections, and surgery. Minimally invasive techniques are emerging with the hope that with less postoperative scar tissue formation, there will be less recurrence of the disease. In this chapter, senior author describes his technique for endoscopic sciatic neurolysis.\n\nEffect of curcumin in mice model of vincristine-induced neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBabu, Anand; Prasanth, K G; Balaji, Bhaskar\n\n2015-06-01\n\nCurcumin exhibits a wide spectrum of biological activities which include neuroprotective, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity. The present study evaluates the effect of curcumin in vincristine-induced neuropathy in a mice model. Vincristine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg, i.p. for 10 consecutive days) was administered to mice to induce neuropathy. Pain behavior was assessed at different days, i.e., 0, 7, 10, and 14 d. Sciatic nerve total calcium, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NO), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were also estimated after the 14th day of study. Pregabalin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and curcumin (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg, p.o.) were administered for 14 consecutive days. Curcumin at 60 mg/kg significantly attenuated the vincristine-induced neuropathic pain manifestations in terms of thermal hyperalgesia (p < 0.001) and allodynia (p < 0.001); mechanical hyperalgesia (p < 0.001); functional loss (p < 0.001); and in the delayed phase of formalin test (p < 0.001). Curcumin at 30 and 60 mg/kg exhibited significant changes (p < 0.001) in antioxidant levels and in total calcium levels in vincristine-injected mice. Curcumin at 30 and 60 mg/kg dose levels significantly attenuated vincristine-induced neuropathy which may be due to its multiple actions including antinociceptive, calcium inhibitory, and antioxidant effect.\n\nElectrophysiologic alterations in the excitability of the sciatic and vagus nerves during early stages of sepsis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiniz, LÃºcio Ricardo Leite; Portella, Viviane Gomes; da Silva Alves, Kerly Shamira; AraÃºjo, PÃ¢mella Cristina da Costa; de Albuquerque JÃºnior, Ricardo Luiz Cavalcanti; Cavalcante de Albuquerque, Aline Alice; Coelho-de-Souza, Andrelina Noronha; Leal-Cardoso, JosÃ© Henrique\n\n2018-01-01\n\nNonspecific and delayed diagnosis of neurologic damage contributes to the development of neuropathies in patients with severe sepsis. The present study assessed the electrophysiologic parameters related to the excitability and conductibility of sciatic and vagus nerves during early stages of sepsis. Twenty-four hours after sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model, sciatic and vagus nerves of septic (CLP group) and control (sham group) rats were removed, and selected electric stimulations were applied to measure the parameters of the first and second components of the compound action potential. The first component originated from fibers with motor and sensory functions (Types A Î± and A Î² fibers) with a large conduction velocity (70-120 m/s), and the second component originated from fibers (Type A Î³ ) with sensorial function. To evaluate the presence of sensorial alterations, the sensitivity to non-noxious mechanical stimuli was measured by using the von Frey test. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the nerves was performed. We observed an increase of rheobase followed by a decrease in the first component amplitude and a higher paw withdrawal threshold in response to the application of von Frey filaments in sciatic nerves from the CLP group compared to the sham group. Differently, a decrease in rheobase and an increase in the first component amplitude of vagal C fibers from CLP group were registered. No significant morphologic alteration was observed. Our data showed that the electrophysiologic alterations in peripheral nerves vary with the fiber type and might be identified in the first 24 h of sepsis, before clinical signs of neuromuscular disorders.\n\nRetinoic acid reduces chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in an animal model and patients with lung cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHernÃ¡ndez-Pedro, N.; FernÃ¡ndez-GonzÃ¡lez- AragÃ³n, M.C.; Saavedra-PÃ©rez, D.; Campos-Parra, A.D.; RÃ­os-Trejo, M.Ã.; CerÃ³n-LizÃ¡rraga, T.; MartÃ­nez-Barrera, L.; Pineda, B.; OrdÃ³Ã±ez, G.; Ortiz-Plata, A.; Granados-Soto, V.; Sotelo, J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective: To evaluate the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as treatment for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in an experimental animal model and in a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Forty male Wistar rats were randomized in 5 groups: group A, control; groups B and C, treated with cisplatin; and groups D and E, treated with paclitaxel. ATRA (20 mg/kg PO) was administered for 15 days in groups C and E. We evaluated neuropathy and nerve regenerationârelated morphologic changes in sciatic nerve, the concentration of nerve growth factor (NGF), and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)âÎ± and RAR-Î² expression. In addition, 95 patients with NSCLC under chemotherapy treatment were randomized to either ATRA (20 mg/m2/d) or placebo. Serum NGF, neurophysiologic tests, and clinical neurotoxicity were assessed. Results: The experimental animals developed neuropathy and axonal degeneration, associated with decreased NGF levels in peripheral nerves. Treatment with ATRA reversed sensorial changes and nerve morphology; this was associated with increased NGF levels and RAR-Î² expression. Patients treated with chemotherapy had clinical neuropathy and axonal loss assessed by neurophysiology, which was related to decreased NGF levels. ATRA reduced axonal degeneration demonstrated by nerve conduction velocity and clinical manifestations of neuropathy grades â¥2. Conclusions: ATRA reduced chemotherapy-induced experimental neuropathy, increased NGF levels, and induced RAR-Î² expression in nerve. In patients, reduction of NGF in serum was associated with the severity of neuropathy; ATRA treatment reduced the electrophysiologic alterations. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that ATRA improves nerve conduction in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

The present study in rats was designed first to measure diabetes-induced abnormalities in Na,K-ATPase activity, isoenzyme expression, fatty acid content in sciatic nerve membranes, and NCV and second to assess the preventive ability of a fish oil-rich diet (rich in n-3 fatty acids) on these abnormalities. Diabetes was induced by intravenous streptozotocin injection. Diabetic animals (D) and nondiabetic control animals (C) were fed the standard rat chow either without supplementation or supplemented with either fish oil (DM, CM) or olive oil (DO, CO) at a daily dose of 0.5 g/kg by gavage during 8 weeks. Analysis of the fatty acid composition of purified sciatic nerve membranes from diabetic animals showed a decreased incorporation of C16:1(n-7) fatty acids and arachidonic acids. Fish oil supplementation changed the fatty acid content of sciatic nerve membranes, decreasing C18:2(n-6) fatty acids and preventing the decreases of arachidonic acids and C18:1(n-9) fatty acids. Protein expression of Na,K-ATPase alpha subunits, Na,K-ATPase activity, and ouabain affinity were assayed in purified sciatic nerve membranes from CO, DO, and DM. Na,K-ATPase activity was significantly lower in sciatic nerve membranes of diabetic rats and significantly restored in diabetic animals that received fish oil supplementation. Diabetes induced a specific decrease of alpha1- and alpha3-isoform activity and protein expression in sciatic nerve membranes. Fish oil supplementation restored partial activity and expression to varying degrees depending on the isoenzyme. These effects were associated with a significant beneficial effect on NCV. This study indicates that fish oil has beneficial effects on diabetes-induced alterations in sciatic nerve Na,K-ATPase activity and function.\n\nElectrophysiologic alterations in the excitability of the sciatic and vagus nerves during early stages of sepsis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDiniz, LÃºcio Ricardo Leite; Portella, Viviane Gomes; da Silva Alves, Kerly Shamira; AraÃºjo, PÃ¢mella Cristina da Costa; de Albuquerque JÃºnior, Ricardo Luiz Cavalcanti; Cavalcante de Albuquerque, Aline Alice; Coelho-de-Souza, Andrelina Noronha; Leal-Cardoso, JosÃ© Henrique\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground Nonspecific and delayed diagnosis of neurologic damage contributes to the development of neuropathies in patients with severe sepsis.

Mutant HSP27 proteins affect axonal transport by reducing acetylated tubulin. We generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing HSP27-S135F mutant protein driven by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter. The mouse phenotype was similar to dHMN patients in that they exhibit motor neuropathy. To determine the phenotypic aberration of transgenic mice, behavior test, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological study, and pathology were performed. Rotarod test showed that founder mice exhibited lowered motor performance. MRI also revealed marked fatty infiltration in the anterior and posterior compartments at calf level. Electrophysiologically, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) but not motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) was reduced in the transgenic mice. Toluidine staining with semi-thin section of sciatic nerve showed the ratio of large myelinated axon fiber was reduced, which might cause reduced locomotion in the transgenic mice. Electron microscopy also revealed abundant aberrant myelination. Immunohistochemically, neuronal dysfunctions included elevated level of phosphorylated neurofilament and reduced level of acetylated tubulin in the sural nerve of transgenic mice. There was no additional phenotype besides motor neuronal defects. Overexpression of HSP27-S135F protein causes peripheral neuropathy. The mouse model can be applied to future development of therapeutic strategies for dHMN or CMT2F.\n\nDioscorea Extract (DA-9801) Modulates Markers of Peripheral Neuropathy in Type 2 Diabetic db/db Mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoon, Eunjung; Lee, Sung Ok; Kang, Tong Ho; Kim, Hye Ju; Choi, Sang Zin; Son, Mi-Won; Kim, Sun Yeou\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of DA-9801, an optimized extract of Dioscorea species, on diabetic peripheral neuropathy in a type 2 diabetic animal model. In this study, db/db mice were treated with DA-9801 (30 and 100 mg/kg, daily, p.o.) for 12 weeks. DA-9801 reduced the blood glucose levels and increased the withdrawal latencies in hot plate tests. Moreover, it prevented nerve damage based on increased nerve conduction velocity and ultrastructural changes. Decrease of nerve growth factor (NGF) may have a detrimental effect on diabetic neuropathy. We previously reported NGF regulatory properties of the Dioscorea genus. In this study, DA-9801 induced NGF production in rat primary astrocytes. In addition, it increased NGF levels in the sciatic nerve and the plasma of type 2 diabetic animals. DA-9801 also increased neurite outgrowth and mRNA expression of Tieg1/Klf10, an NGF target gene, in PC12 cells. These results demonstrated the attenuation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy by oral treatment with DA-9801 via NGF regulation. DA-9801 is currently being evaluated in a phase II clinical study.\n\nExosomes derived from high-glucose-stimulated Schwann cells promote development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nJia, Longfei; Chopp, Michael; Wang, Lei; Lu, Xuerong; Szalad, Alexandra; Zhang, Zheng Gang\n\n2018-06-22\n\nSchwann cells actively interact with axons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Exosomes mediate intercellular communication by transferring their biomaterials, including microRNAs (miRs) into recipient cells. We hypothesized that exosomes derived from Schwann cells stimulated by high glucose (HG) exosomes accelerate development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and that exosomal cargo miRs contribute to this process. We found that HG exosomes contained high levels of miR-28, -31a, and -130a compared to exosomes derived from non-HG-stimulated Schwann cells. In vitro, treatment of distal axons with HG exosomes resulted in reduction of axonal growth, which was associated with elevation of miR-28, -31a, and -130a and reduction of their target proteins of DNA methyltransferase-3Î±, NUMB (an endocytic adaptor protein), synaptosome associated protein 25, and growth-associated protein-43 in axons. In vivo, administration of HG exosomes to sciatic nerves of diabetic db/db mice at 7 wk of age promoted occurrence of peripheral neuropathy characterized by impairment of nerve conduction velocity and induction of mechanic and thermal hypoesthesia, which was associated with substantial decreases in intraepidermal nerve fibers. Our findings demonstrate a functional role of exosomes derived from HG-stimulated Schwann cells in mediating development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.-Jia, L., Chopp, M., Wang, L., Lu, X., Szalad, A., Zhang, Z.

We sought to determine the role of GDNF in restoring BNB function in vivo by evaluating sciatic nerve horseradish peroxidase (HRP) permeability in tamoxifen-inducible GDNF conditional knockout (CKO) adult mice following non-transecting crush injury via electron microscopy, with appropriate wildtype (WT) and heterozygous (HET) littermate controls. A total of 24 age-, genotype- and sex-matched mice >12 weeks of age were injected with 30 mg/kg HRP via tail vein injection 7 or 14Â days following unilateral sciatic nerve crush, and both sciatic nerves were harvested 30 minutes later for morphometric assessment by light and electron microscopy. The number and percentage of HRP-permeable endoneurial microvessels were ascertained to determine the effect of GDNF in restoring barrier function in vivo. Following sciatic nerve crush, there was significant upregulation in GDNF protein expression in WT and HET mice that was abrogated in CKO mice. GDNF significantly restored sciatic nerve BNB HRP impermeability to near normal levels by day 7, with complete restoration seen by day 14 in WT and HET mice. A significant recovery lag was observed in CKO mice. This effect was independent on VE-Cadherin or claudin-5 expression on endoneurial microvessels. These results imply an important role of GDNF in restoring restrictive BNB function in vivo, suggesting a potential strategy to re-establish the restrictive endoneurial microenvironment following traumatic peripheral neuropathies.\n\nSciatica due to Schwannoma at the Sciatic Notch\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaspolat, Yavuz; Ozkan, Feyza Unlu; Turkmen, Ismail; Kemah, Bahattin; Turhan, Yalcin; Sarar, Serhan; Ozkan, Korhan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSchwannomas are rarely seen on the sciatic nerve and can cause sciatica.

The messenger RNA which codes for the PNS myelin glycoprotein P0 (P0-mRNA) was used to monitor this toxic neuropathy in Sprague Dawley rats prior to, concurrent with, and subsequent to, ultrastructurally and immunocytochemically defined nerve damage. Rats were dosed every other day with acrylamide (50 mg/kg, IP) and sampled intermittently throughout a 4 week exposure period. Slot blot and Northern gel analyses of the proximal and distal sciatic nerve were used to determine a quantitated measure of P0-mRNA. Twenty-four hours after the first treatment, in the absence of ultrastructural damage, P0-mRNA increased 55% over control levels in the distal sciatic nerve. After 12 treatments, and concomitant with the appearance of spinal cord and PNS neuropathic damage and hindlimb dysfunction, P0-mRNA decreased 45% below control levels. Levels of P0-mRNA from rats exposed to 12 treatments of acrylamide but allowed to recover for 40 days, returned to 79% of control values to reflect the regeneration and remyelination occurring in the distal sciatic nerve. In spite of these fluctuations in levels of P0-mRNA, immunocytochemical staining of P0 protein in plastic sections of the distal sciatic nerve was present throughout all sample times. These results suggest that changes in neural specific mRNAs are sensitive to neurotoxic damage and can be used to monitor the pathogenesis of nerve degeneration.\n\nPost-evaluation of the neurophaties treatment post-trauma with therapeutic laser. Model in sciatic nerve of frog\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEscobar, Antonio S.; Ocampo, Arcelia F. M.; Hernandez, Maria G. H.\n\n2010-05-31\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the compound nerve action potential amplitude and latency measured to determine the degree of myelination and the number of fibers stimulated in a model of stimulated frog sciatic nerve laser at 810 nm as perioperative treatment after injury. It used 30 bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) to obtain 60 sciatic nerves forming four groups, groups 1 and 2 worked with nerves in vitro, were dissected in humid chambers for placing isolated organ, was recorded on compound nerve action potential, the second group laser was applied at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours andmoreÂ Â» at the same t"
