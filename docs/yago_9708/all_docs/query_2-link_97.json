        "text": "Indicator, a boutique British video label from Powerhouse Films, has announced their four upcoming Blu-ray releases for March. It is a quartet of British films, and in some cases, Indicator has done a new scan and digital restoration from the original camera negative.\n\nAlthough these are being released in the U.K., three of the four titles are listed as Region Free, so they will play in Blu-ray players worldwide. Usually, Indicator’s titles are eventually available through Amazon, DiabolikDVD and other U.S.retailers.\n\nBelow are the details directly from the Indicator email newsletter and website:\n\nA Dandy in Aspic\n\n(Anthony Mann, 1968)\n\nRelease date: 18 March 2019\n\nLimited Blu-ray Edition (UK Blu-ray premiere)\n\nThe final film by the great Anthony Mann (Winchester ’73, El Cid) A Dandy in Aspic is a stylish and complex cold-war thriller starring Laurence Harvey (Room at the Top, The Manchurian Candidate) as a Russian double-agent working for British Intelligence who is assigned to track down and kill an unusual target.\n\nFalling between the outlandish exploits of James Bond and the dour realism of John le Carré’s ‘circus of spies’, this paranoid thriller is a dark and refined affair, with a superb supporting cast headed by Mia Farrow (Rosemary’s Baby, See No Evil) and Tom Courtenay (The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, Otley), wonderful cinematography by regular Powell and Pressburger cameraman Christopher Challis, and with a terrific score by Quincy Jones.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED BLU-RAY EDITION SPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nHigh Definition remaster\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nAudio commentary with author and critic Samm Deighan\n\nBFI Seminar with Anthony Mann (1978): an archival audio recording\n\nThe BEHP Interview with Christopher Challis (1988): an archival audio recording, made as part of the British Entertainment History Project, featuring the renowned cinematographer in conversation with Kevin Gough-Yates\n\nBerlin: The Swinging City (1968): original promotional film\n\nInterview with titles designer Michael Graham-Smith (2019)\n\nRichard Combs on ‘A Dandy in Aspic’ (2019): a new appreciation by the renowned critic, lecturer and broadcaster\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery: on-set and promotional photography\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet with a new essay by Ian Penman, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits\n\nWorld premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited Edition of 3,000 copies\n\nAll extras subject to change\n\n#PHILTD111\n\nBBFC cert: 12\n\nREGION FREE\n\nEAN: 5037899071670\n\nThe Virgin Soldiers\n\n(John Dexter, 1969)\n\nRelease date: 18 March 2019\n\nLimited Blu-ray Edition (UK Blu-ray premiere)\n\nSet in Singapore in the early 1950s, this impressive adaptation of Leslie Thomas’ best-selling, scandalous novel centres on a group of naïve, young British Army recruits billeted to Malaya who have no experience of either love or war. Both affectionate and affecting in its look at young men in wartime, the film has a wonderful cast which includes Lynn Redgrave (Georgy Girl, The National Health), Hywel Bennett (The Family Way, Twisted Nerve) and Nigel Davenport (The Third Secret, The Mind of Mr. Soames), along with early appearances from Christopher Timothy, Wayne Sleep, James Cosmo – and a young David Bowie. Genuine and heartfelt, The Virgin Soldiers is an insightful and hugely underrated British comic drama.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nHigh Definition remaster\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nInterview with co-screenwriter Ian La Frenais (2019)\n\nInterview with actor Roy Holder (2019)\n\n16mm On-set Footage (1969): rare and previously unseen material shot on location\n\nOperation Malaya (1953): David MacDonald’s acclaimed feature-length docudrama on the Malayan Emergency\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery: on-set and promotional photography\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet with a new essay by author Scott Harrison, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits\n\nUK premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited Edition of 3,000 copies\n\nAll extras subject to change\n\n#PHILTD142\n\nBBFC cert: 15\n\nREGION FREE\n\nEAN: 5037899071908\n\nThe Triple Echo\n\n(Michael Apted, 1972)\n\nRelease date: 18 March 2019\n\nLimited Blu-ray Edition (World Blu-ray premiere)\n\nMichael Apted made his feature-film debut with this distinctive drama based on the novella of the same name by H E Bates. Reuniting Glenda Jackson with her Women in Love co-star Oliver Reed, the film also stars a young Brian Deacon (Vampyres, A Zed & Two Noughts).\n\nWhen a young soldier (Deacon) deserts his outfit and hides in a remote farm, the farm owner (Jackson) and he fall in love. But their idyll is shattered by the arrival of a boorish, violent army sergeant (Reed) searching for his AWOL recruit.\n\nUnconventional and superbly played, The Triple Echo is one of the finest British films of the 1970s. Long overlooked and unjustly neglected, this powerful drama is now ripe for rediscovery, and is presented in a brand new 2K restoration from the film’s newly rediscovered original negative.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nNew 2K restoration by Powerhouse Films from the original negative\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nInterview with director Michael Apted (2019): the award-winning filmmaker discusses The Triple Echo in this new and exclusive interview\n\nInterview with actor Brian Deacon (2019)\n\nInterview with composer Marc Wilkinson (2019)\n\nInterview with editor Barrie Vince (2019)\n\nInterview with costume designer Emma Porteus (2019)\n\nNeil Sinyard on ‘The Triple Echo’ (2019): a new appreciation by the author and film historian\n\nSuper 8 version: original cut-down home-cinema presentation\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nTeaser trailer\n\nImage gallery: on-set and promotional photography\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet with a new essay by Pasquale Iannone, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits\n\nWorld premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited Edition of 3,000 copies\n\nAll extras subject to change\n\n#PHILTD119\n\nBBFC cert: TBC\n\nREGION B\n\nEAN: 5037899071755\n\nImmaculate Conception\n\n(Jamil Dehlavi, 1992)\n\nRelease date: 18 March 2019\n\nLimited Blu-ray Edition (World Blu-ray premiere)\n\nA Western couple (played by Melissa Leo and James Wilby) working in Pakistan visit an unconventional holy shrine to harness its spiritual powers to help them conceive a child. They are lavished with the attentions of the shrine’s leader (an exceptional performance from Zia Mohyeddin – Lawrence of Arabia, Khartoum) and her followers, but their methods and motives are not all that they seem, and the couple’s lives are plunged into darkness.\n\nThis ravishing, unsettling film from director Jamil Delhavi (The Blood of Hussain, Born of Fire) is a deeply personal work which raises questions of cultural and sexual identity, religious fanaticism and the abuses of power. The brand-new 2K restoration from the original negative was supervised and approved by Dehavi and cinematographer Nic Knowland.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nNew 2K restoration by Powerhouse Films from the original negative\n\nOriginal stereo audio\n\nInterview with Jamil Dehlavi (2019): new and exclusive interview in which the director discusses the making of Immaculate Conception\n\nInterview with James Wilby (2019): a new interview with the esteemed actor\n\nInterview with Ronny Jhutti (2019): a new interview with the popular actor and filmmaker\n\nInterview with Nic Knowland (2019): a new interview with the renowned director of photography\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet with a new essay by screenwriter and journalist Naman Ramachandran, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits\n\nWorld premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited Edition of 3,000 copies\n\nAll extras subject to change"
