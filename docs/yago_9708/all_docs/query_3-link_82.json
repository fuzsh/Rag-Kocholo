        "text": "The Shia Muslim community of Simi Valley held its third annual Imam Hussain Blood Drive on Sept. 22 at the Masjid Al-Rasool mosque in Simi Valley.\n\nThe drive was in coordination with the American Red Cross and the Imamia Medics International Organization.\n\nThe event was held in the name of Imam Hussain during the Islamic month of Muharram.\n\nThe drive has grown from 37 donors the first year to 110 registered donors this year, which required three bloodmobiles, organizers said.\n\nEnough blood was collected from members of Masjid Al-Rasool and the Fatima Islamic Society to save 240 lives.\n\nHussain was one of Prophet Muhammad’s grandsons from the 7th century. His martyrdom during the Battle of Karbala made him a highly revered figure in the Middle East. His heroic fight against tyranny, injustice and oppression has inspired millions.\n\nHussain gave his life and sacrificed 72 of his family members to counter the evils in society and to stand up for the principles of peace and reformation.\n\nHis battle was against the tyrannical caliph of the time, Yazid, in the land of Karbala, Iraq.\n\nThe imam at Masjid Al- Rasool, Aga Modarres, and Mike McAdams, accounts manager of the Ventura County Red Cross, have worked in collaboration for three years and will continue to work together on the blood drive."
