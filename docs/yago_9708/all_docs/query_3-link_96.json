        "text": "Srinagar- The Kashmir chapter of globally renowned social justice organization ‘Who is Hussain’ is organizing a blood donation camp across the three districts of Kashmir Valley as part of the organization’s world-wide blood donation drive on Saturday.\n\nIn Srinagar city, blood donation camps will be set up at Imambada Zadibal and Imam Bargah Ayatullah Yousuf, Bemina besides Markazi Imam Bargah Budgam and Imambargah Gamdoo in Bandipora on Saturday.\n\nThe non-profit organization has it’s chapters in 109 cities worldwide including Srinagar where around 25 volunteers have been working in order to aware people about Prophet Muhammad’s grandson Hussain ibn Ali.\n\nThe blood donation camp is part of the global campaign ‘Be a global blood hero’ being held across several countries. The aim of the campaign is to set a world record-breaking challenge of collecting 50,000 units of blood in one calendar day.\n\nOrganizers say they are hopeful that the blood donation drive will evoke an overwhelming response.\n\nBlood donation Camps have been set up at four different locations in Kashmir and each camp hosts nearly a dozen beds which will be looked after by a group of five well experienced paramedics besides the volunteers of the global NGO.\n\nOrganizers further said separate bed arrangements have been made for female donors. The Kashmir chapter of WhoIsHussain expects to collect nearly 2500 units of blood during the one day donation drive, much beyond the total capacity of hospitals.\n\nAbrar Ali, one of the organizers, said he is getting calls from people from all walks of life, who are eager to donate blood for a noble cause.\n\n“People cutting across sectarian lines are eager to participate in this record breaking drive by donating blood. I have received hundreds of calls from people who want to donate blood for a noble cause” Abrar said.\n\n“Our team has been working tirelessly from the past couple of months to make sure we too are a part of the history that is being made and what better way to be recorded in the history like the one who donated his blood for saving lives in the name of Hussain Ibe Ali,” he added.\n\nAsgar Baba, another volunteer, voiced his appreciation for Government run hospitals for leaving no stone unturned to make the event successful.\n\n“We are highly thankful to Directorate of Health Services Kashmir, SKIMS, GMC Srinagar and GMC Baramulla for their enormous support to make this event successful”\n\nPertinently, WhoIsHussain has taken a series of initiatives over the last few years in Kashmir for the overall development of the society. The prominent NGO held sanitation drives, awareness campaigns besides relief work during the natural calamities. WhoIsHussain also carried out relief work after the outbreak of deadly Coronavirus pandemic in the Valley.\n\n‘The Wall of Kindness’ initiative that took social media by storm in the winters of 2018, was also the brainchild of WhoIsHussain.\n\nThe blood donation drive is being carried out in Collaboration with Salute72 Blood Donors Group and Anjuman Blood Donors, Budgam."
