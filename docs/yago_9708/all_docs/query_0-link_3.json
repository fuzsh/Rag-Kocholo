It is prophesied that Young Hussain will one day lead the impoverished masses to a better life. It is his brother, Hasan, however who gains in prominence and when the government is overthrown in a military coup, he tries to adapt. Hussain in the meanwhile gets married and leads a small band of rebels in an attempt to fight the military dictatorship.",

        "text": "Dehlavi mixes the political with the mystical to create a symbolic and lyrical landmark in the Third Cinema movement of the 1970s. The closest comparison I can conjure up is the work of Tarkovsky, and indeed the tale of peasants against a corrupt and tyrannical ruling class is one that resonates greatly in Russian literature. Alongside his cinematographer Walter Lassally, Dehlavi creates images that burn themselves into your retina in much the same way as the Soviet auteur managed. Take, for instance, the sight of a beautiful white stallion, rising up seemingly from beneath the dusty arid earth, or the masochistic fervour of the Muharram ritual of self-flagellation that occur on the teeming city streets. There’s a poetic and surreal quality to how Dehlavi chooses to visualise his narrative that makes what is, on the surface at least, a traditional tale of good versus evil a striking and metaphorical arthouse production.\n\nSee my full review at The Geek Show\n\nThis incredible Pakistani film was completed shortly before the 1977 coup in Pakistan and the coming to power of General Zia-ul-Haq. The story is a sort of modern re-telling of the legend of Karbala and Imam Hussain's struggle against the tyrannical rule of Yazid in the seventh century. Hussain in this film, like his ancient namesake, leads a band rebels against a tyrannical illegitimate government.\n\nThe story of Hussein has inspired countless works of poetry and passion plays over the centuries, and was bound to make its way to film. If you grew up attending mourning ceremonies in Muharram and listened to every intricate detail of the battle, its prelude, and aftermath, you can appreciate this film on a different…\n\nDown with the cuckold imperialist collaborators! Long live the revolutionary martyrs! The allegory with Islamic history is woven through beautifully with some absolutely stunning set pieces and its indictments of the Pakistani political system still ring true today. Requires some cursory understanding of the historic battle of Karbala and the Shia practice of Tatbir, and it'd probably be helpful to have some understanding of Pakistani political history--particularly regarding it being a Western imperialist strategic project--as well to fully appreciate, but definitely a must watch.\n\nwow I can't believe I didn't know anything about this masterpiece up until a day ago...this is quite possibly the most important political film in Pakistani history cause the crux of the issue outlined in this film is still fucking up the very threads holding together the fabric of our society. Jamil Dehlavi made a poignant wonder that capturre the very essence of Pakistan from the hussaini/yazidi political clash to the beauty of late 70s Lahore and the armed state that was stifling the poor and broken. Also why does young Dehlavi look so much like Ahad Raza Mir???"
