        "text": "Ashura is commemorated on the 10th of Muharram in the first month of the Islamic lunar calendar.\n\nIt is marked by many Muslims with a voluntary day of fasting to observe the day that Prophet Moses freed the Israelites from the bondage of the Egyptian Pharaoh.\n\nAlong with this we also remember this day as one of the most tragic events in Islamic history when Prophet Muhammad's beloved grandson Imam Hussein along with his family were martyred while standing up against injustice.\n\nSome men seek to emulate the suffering of Imam Hussein, lamenting the martyrdom by self-flagellation.\n\nA growing number of scholars discourage this self-infliction and instead encourage people to donate blood on this day.\n\nFasting on the day of Ashura is highly recommended since the time Prophet Muhammad migrated to Madinah.\n\nAccording to Sahih Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number 202 - Narrated Ibn Abbas: When the Prophet arrived at Medina, the Jews were observing the fast on 'Ashura' (10th of Muharram) and they said, \"This is the day when Moses became victorious over Pharaoh,\" On that, the Prophet said to his companions, \"You (Muslims) have more right to celebrate Moses' victory than they have, so observe the fast on this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are several other Hadith that refer to the importance of the day of Ashura.\n\nO' Allah! Bless us to perform good deeds. Make the new year one of unity, cooperation and success.\n\nRelated Suggestions\n\nThe History of Bani Isra'il\n\nThe One Child Pharoah Didn't Kill\n\nBeyond the Zero-Sum Game: Embracing Religious Pluralism for Peace\n\nYom-E-Ashura of Imam Hussain\n\nWitnesses For Humanity - Muharram Series\n\nHistory of Imam á¸¤usayn and His Martyrdom\n\nAshura - Lest We Forget\n\nA Tribute to Hazrat Imam Hussain (AS)\n\nFasting the Day of 'Ashura'\n\nThe Story of Hussain\n\nProclaim Good & Forbid Evil\n\nMuharram and the Martyrdom of Al Hussain\n\nCOMMENTS DISCLAIMER & RULES OF ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe opinions expressed herein, through this post or comments, contain positions and viewpoints that are not necessarily those of IslamiCity.
