        "text": "In this post, I want to concentrate more on the living legacy of Imām Husayn and how we Muslims primarily (but also non-Muslims mutually) can build, out of his altruistic sacrifice, a paradigm of establishing truth, seeking justice and standing with the oppressed for our “postcolonial” colonial-modern epoch where so many of these values are found to be missing and in dire need of restoration at the global level. To understand precisely why the unprecedented massacre at Karbala has echoed down the ages, read the graphic and moving description related to us by the eighth Shi’i Imām, ‘Ali Bin Mūsā Al-Ridhā (148-202 AH/766–818 CE):\n\n“O Ibn Shabib! Muharram is the month in which the people of the Age of Ignorance [pre-Islam Jāhiliyya] had forbidden committing any oppression and fight in. However, this nation [the Ummah of Muhammad] did not recognise the honour of this month or the honour of their own Prophet. In this month, they killed the Prophet’s offspring, they enslaved the women and took their belongings as booty. God will never forgive them. O Ibn Shabib! If you wish to cry, then cry for Husayn who was slaughtered like a sheep and was killed along with members of this household [Ahlul Bayt]. Eighteen people were martyred along with Al-Husayn who had no equal on Earth. The seven heavens and the earths mourned for his martyrdom. Four thousand angels descended to the Earth to assist him. They will remain at his shrine with wrinkled hair until the Riser (Al-Mahdi) rises. Then they will be among those who will assist him. Their slogan will be ‘Revenge for Husayn!’.\n\nFor whatever reasons, many Muslims allow the memory of Imām Husayn, his followers and Karbala to be relegated to ‘Ashura, to Muharram, to the four walls of a Masjid, to speech alone; content with keeping the annual commemoration as an emotional conformity carthasis of sorts. Khayr, it is what it is. The Imām is like a fountain. Everyone who comes to him shall certainly take something away. Some come to the memorial gatherings for solace, reflection, lamenting, mourning whilst others may wish to remember as a means to uplift one’s heart, to find sources of inspiration and to re-confirm their Islam, what it means to be a Muslim with all the responsibilities and duties professing the Shahāda entails. Few have sought to intellectualise Karbala and tease out its radical ramifications (I can only speak as a layperson coming from a Sunni background; perhaps there has been much taking place at such a level but as it stands such production has not had a game-changing impact on modern Muslims broadly).\n\nIn my opinion, Karbala has untapped potential. Muslims are criminally failing to make use of it, the transformative paradigm that it could offer if Muslims from all sects pondered greater on its practical implications. Ideally, it should be informing contemporary efforts at rejuvenating the impoverished and dire colonial-modern “postcolonial” Muslim condition, shaping how we attempt Ihyā’ (revival), Islāh (reform/repair), Tajdīd (renewal) and Ijtihād (independent reasoning, most often linked to the jurispudential-ethical sphere of Fiqh that interprets the Shari’a). Karbala also has creative something to offer for Muslim efforts at enacting decolonisation, which is gathering pace and intensity with each passing year. The Postwestern era is nigh, and our history can be helping guide into potential futures which (re)centre strong ethical and moral visions for ordering societies and regulating human conduct within them.\n\nWilliam Faulkner once wrote, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” The dead cling onto us in the present, and we let them. We let them become legends and mythologies that have something meaningful, something relevant to say for us who are still living. The past must be studied and previous mistakes must be assessed with critical insight and blunt honesty. Granted, this requires the conscious researchers to be mature and respectful of themselves before proceeding with this task — sadly, this is lacking in most “postcolonial” Muslim-majority societies today. Otherwise we will and do find ourselves repeating the same mistakes, deludedly expecting different results and constantly allow our sorry selves to be stuck at the proverbial square one representing inertia. Karbala (amongst others) can help us escape this ditch.\n\nI absolutely agree with this statement, this clarion call made by Imranali Panjwani in the fifth entry of the Critical Muslim Quarterly Magazine series sub-entitled Love and Death, “… the massacre of Karbala can shape ethics, theology and culture and lay the seeds for further developments in those areas” (p. 50). For this to work at the mass-scale level of modern society, a deep recontextualisation needs to be conducted, one that allows that seemingly particular historical event to be seemless linked, to be relevant and on hand to offer insights and even potential solutions to chronic malfeasant, anti-Islamic problems found in colonial-modern societies (irrespective of whether or not they are Muslim-majority, or even Muslim):\n\nAuthoritarianism\n\nInjustice\n\nCorruption/Fraud/Deceit\n\nHypocrisy\n\nTorture\n\nMurder\n\nMysogyny\n\nSocial-Economic Inequalities\n\nRacism/White Supremacy\n\nColourism (especially Anti-Black sentiments)\n\nEtc.\n\nEvery memorial service (at any time of the year) ought to be assessed for the implications they may have at the practical level. The Martyrs of Karbala have achieved almost-mythic status in posterity yet their sacrifice was real and occurred at the material plain of existence. They walked the talk, in other words. So should we with each creative recollection of the event! If we condemn the massacre of innocents in Karbala, we should also condemn the massacre of innocents anywhere on Earth and seek to take practical steps to assist them, for example. Imām Husayn should be viewed universally by all Muslims as a paradigm, a model, not simply a mere individual, that sought to return an ethical and just political vision back at a time when others deliberately sought to deviate.\n\nHis famous refusal to give allegiance to Yazid exemplifies a return to the essential fundamentals of Islam. Not only did he embody the well-known Qur’anic verse that commands Muslims (humanity in general) to enjoin what is good and forbid that which is evil, he also incarnated the Qur’anic teaching of Tawhid in real-time. He, the Muwahhid, “the Perfect Man” (Al-Insān Al-Kāmil) refused to sell out himself and his fellow Muslims. Husayn and his party were those who voluntarily self-surrended themselves sincerely only to Allah the Most High, their Creator and Sustainer, to whom all will return to shortly to receive Judgement and Justice.\n\nA Sufi might well say that Husayn’s Nafs (Ego) melted before the presence of the Divine. Exclusive love for Allah motivated this human actor. The Husayni Model is that of integrity, altruism, love for Allah and his Noble Messenger. This is something that postcolonial Muslims desperately need to recover, and fast. Whilst Yazid exemplified hypocrisy and authoritarianism (features sadly so rife in the colonial-modern Islamicate), seeking fragmentation, Husayn pulled together his thoughts, speech and actions together harmoniously in a unified manner. The Imam sought to undo that fragmentation and enact a sweeping restoration of sound Islamic governance and ethical comportment.\n\nContrary to speculation that he sought to replace Yazid (the Umayyads) and seize power for himself along hereditary lines, the Imām himself clarified in a letter to his brother, Muhammad Ibn Al-Hanafiyyah (15–81 AH/ 637–700 CE):\n\n“I have not risen against Yazid in order to create corruption or discord, nor to elevate myself in the eyes of the people, nor to oppress. I have only risen to rectify the affairs of the Ummah of my grandfather and the affairs of the Shi’ah [Party] of my father ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib. I wish to exhort good and reprimand evil. Whosoever accepts my position will be on the side of Allah and the side of righteousness. Whosoever rejects me, may Allah be the final judge between them and me. He is the best judge. O my brother! Indeed success is from Allah. Upon Him do I rely and unto Him do I return.”\n\nElsewhere, in a speech made to the army of Al-Hurr who tried to intercept the Imam on his way to Kūfa, Husayn boldly and consistently declared:\n\n“Do you not see that truth is not followed anymore, and that falsehood is not being interdicted [by anyone]? Indeed, it is within the rights of a believer to meet God. Verily, I do not see death except [in the form of] matrydom; and I do not see life with the unjust as anything but loathsome.”\n\nCommanding to goodness and prohibiting evil necessitates that one should expose wrongdoing at every turn, especially once its impact has a tremendously negative effect upon broader societal level. This is precisely what Husayn did when he exposed the tyranny of the Umayyads and correctly refused to live under their false hegemony. He never initiated hostilities, always tried to negotiate according to bona fide Islamic principles and genuinely believed in the goodwill of others. He also demonstrated that one must be prepared to fight for one’s belief, for one’s rights, for one’s self-determination, peacefully at first but in the last resort militancy becomes Wājib. When peaceful negotiations break down and hostilities are inevitable, one must reach for the sword and make a firm stand.\n\nHistory is on nobody’s side. How it is determined depends on how much each participating active force is willing to fight the hardest for what they believe in. The Husayni Model is ultimately that of martyrdom. It prepares you to be ready to sacrifice your life, your wealth and possessions for a higher and nobler cause. It teaches you the fundamental meanings and truth of existence: You belong to none other than God. Better to die free than to live slavishly under manifest tyranny. But it can only work with what is already there. You have to accept this before embarking on your journey to your own Karbala, otherwise you will be a Kūfan Munāfiq, unwilling to sacrifice when the occasion arises and betraying those who need you in their time of need.\n\nIn our times, those White Capitalist folks who incorrectly practice Racism (White Supremacy) are the most capable, smartest actors in society on the global scale. Despite Allah blessing them with immense knowledge and capability, they have clearly chosen to practice injustice which is ethically wrong (not that they care, unfortunately for us). Meanwhile, those who allow themselves to collaborate with the Racists and seek to merely survive in spite of conditions set up and manipulated by White Supremacist Racist-Capitalists prove themselves to be only ignorant about why they exist in the first instance. Neither the life of an oppressor nor the life of oppression is worth living. This is what Husayni counter-model brings to the proverbial table. Against Racist-Capitalism, it reminds us the inherent dignity and worth of human life — the most beloved creation of God. None are worthy nor entitled to dominate their fellow brother or sister. Those who affirm this ethically egregious stance only find themselves indulging in Shirk — the criminal sin that Allah Himself — The All-Merciful — declares that He will not forgive.\n\nHow we Muslims choose to remember Karbala has a major impact on how we opt to do politics in our present age. Karbala is a story about human dignity being violated violently by oppressors at the top-end of society. It is an asymmetric clash of Unequals. Imam Husayn nonetheless picked up his sword (in self-defence) and willing became a martyr. In doing so, his dignity and that of his followers remained solidly intact. It is clear that the callous Umayyads at Karbala did not have:\n\nRespect for the Absolute Sanctity of Life\n\nRespect for Difference of Opinion\n\nRespect for Reaching Disputes Peacefully\n\nRespect for the Rules of Warfare\n\nRespect for Normative Ethics and Justice\n\nResepct for the Teachings of Al-Qur’an Wa Sunna Al-Nabi\n\nRespect for Women and Children\n\nRespect for the Deceased/Corpses\n\nRespect for The Prophet’s Household (Ahlul Bayt)\n\nThis has deep implications when we moderns think about human rights and our responsibilities to one another under the ever-watchful gaze of the Divine. Karbala exposed the fallacies of Umayyad rule, how it was largely reliant upon coercion and violence to sustain itself (an obvious proof of its illegitimacy, and why it had to fight various rebellions against itself). How it was reliant upon subverting Islamic teachings to get its own egocentric way. I will talk more about Palestine later on but it is worth thinking about utilising Karbala as a way of exposing the current inadequacies of human rights (human entitlements?) in light of genocide. In Palestine, it is clear that not “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” as Article 1 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts in the abstract. As it was under Yazid, the way that the world is structured politically determines who counts as a human (White Euro-Americans sit at the top of the Racial Ladder) and who is not i.e. “sub-humans” (Palestinians, the immediate example). Those who do not count as worthy (Husayn’s Party/Palestinians) are liable to be exterminated by the unjust powers-that-be.\n\nIt is worthwhile commenting on another significant figure from this real-life story that adds to the Karbbala framework: Al-Hurr Bin Yazid Al-Riyahi, an Umayyad army general who defected to Husayn’s camp at the last moment. There is no clear-cut indication that Al-Hurr formally converted to Islam. Husayn did not request that the general profess the Shahāda but accepted the man unconditionally and forgave him generously despite Al-Hurr initially siding with the Umayyads. He had a conscious change of heart at the last minute, a phenomenon that is quite common, all-too-common in the unescapable religious sphere of human life.\n\nThrough Al-Hurr and other non-Muslims present with the Muslims at Karbala (there were at least three Christians; Qamar, Wahb and Haniyyah), we can vividly see that the demand for justice, for a better world is a universal affair. This has strong implications for strategic alliance-building between Muslims and non-Muslims in the present, whether it be done out of conviction or convenience. Contrary to the naysayers, there is such a thing as universal morality, and standing for Justice, for Truth, for Human Dignity can and does involve Muslims and non-Muslims. We see this today most prominently in the global Palestine Protest Movement.\n\nIf Karbala demonstrates that morality is universal and applicable to all then it obviously has an impact for our supposedly secular, “post-Christian” colonial-modern age (heads-up: it’s not really post-Christian at all; keep an eye out for all contemporary references and invocations of the Crusades). According to Weberian Orthodoxy, (Western) Europe after the Reformation underwent Disenchantment. With the Catholic Papacy reduced in power and scope and churches finding themselves nationalised by the colonial-modern monster that is the nation-state, there has been a collapse of historically-dominant (Christian) narratives, contributing to secularisation, widespread fragmentation, relativism, a distrust of “meta-narratives” (as postmodern thinkers proclaim) and the rise of various man-made ideologies seeking to fill the vacuum. Pluralism in the chaotic sense is now the norm. Western Imperialism and Colonialism exported this historical and particular issue unique to Western Europe across the globe, making problems facing White folks everybody else’s problem too. Boo! A particular history has been upscaled to a global history of humanity, as led by White Western Civilisation. It is this narrative that is failing to hold each passing year. Islamism has been a long-term empirical signifier of this fact.\n\n“God is dead, and we have killed him.” declared Frederich Nietzsche in the Industrial Age, anticipating the struggle to fill the vacuum in colonial-modernity. Is God really dead, or has He simply been replaced by something else in the West? Personally, I do not believe that a “Disenchantment” ever took place; rather, enchantment was gradually reorganised in the West during the Enlightenment and found its new home in White Supremacist Racist-Capitalism, augmented by industrial and technological developments that are unmistakenly bound up with violent colonialism and imperialism. Re-Enchantment, if you like. Mass polytheism has returned once more and replaced Pauline Christianity whilst also selectively reappropriating it. Tadawwul…?\n\nI view the Disenchantment and Secularisation Theses as obfuscatory if anything, hiding the Re-Enchanment and helping to prevent any religious revival against it. Karbala is an phenomenon that is by default secular-resistant. It cannot be co-opted into supporting the false cause of liberalism (indeed, I know of no person ever referring to Imam Husayn’s sacrifice as being “liberal” in essence). It is naturally bound up with religion but various aspects of the narrative appeals to the non-religious believers too. Neither Left or Right can adopt/co-opt Husayn, an eminently Islamic figure, for their own agendas but all can still learn much from his ethical example, which is universal.\n\nHeroism is also preserved in this narrative. Imam Husayn appears as the noble, chivalrous warrior motivated by a higher ideal and self-sacrifices himself not only for Muslims but for the rest of creation. It certainly appears strange to us “postcolonials” who have to put up with living carceral lives under hypernormalised conditions of Racial-Capitalism but it reminds us that we are not here to be mindless, robotic consumers lacking purpose. In modern philosophies, there is much talk about concepts such as inauthenticity and what it means for living a meaningful existence in pluralist and uncertain universe.\n\nIn religious lingo, living an inaunthentic life is to live a blasphemous life, a life filled with an affront to the Divine and therefore an affront to man himself! What did Karbala demonstrate? That to live a fully authentic life is to fully submit oneself exclusively to the One who made you and ennobled you from the cradle to the grave. Humans intrinsically submit to a higher force. Many might have opted to submit to the Umayyads (something they will have to explain soon enough) but the few with Husayn correctly chose to surrender to the Creator and Master of the Universe, the only Real Force. In doing so, the Martyrs have attained the highest rank in this life and the next. It is something we Muslims should be envious about, in the positive sense!\n\nKarbala gives history ample transcendental meaning. It unveils the telos that undergirds existence. The profound nature of Karbala stands in stark contrast colonial-modern notions of history as pure immanence, self-contained inside of itself, leading to an insular and narcissistic outlook that can only mock all others that must serve its needs, that must remain captive to it. The Eurocentric is Egocentric. By helping to expose this blatant fallacy, Karbala automatically contributes towards decolonisation not only human actors and how we think about history but the cosmos too. Karbala functions as the link between Pre-Existence when every soul acknowledged Allah as their Rabb (Q7:172) and to Post-Existence, the Afterlife (Al-Akhirah) where we will all be judged and recompensated for all the good and evil we committed in this fleeting life.\n\nAt Karbala, it was the pious Martyrs that drove world history in “defeat” (paradoxically). Humans are not mere mechanical objects of no importance. We are not a random conglomeration of bonded atoms bumping into other bodies every now and again, engendering random chemical processes that affect the world around us. We learn much from the sacrifice: We have been created for a greater purpose. We are able to manifest godly attributes in a finite capacity and in doing so, we maintain our personal bonds with the Infinite Divine. Love, for Allah, His Noble Messenger, His Book, for his fellow Muslims, his fellow creation — Love is what drove Husayn to a noble ending. Our approach to history has ample meaning layered with profoundness. Never forget this. Husayn had his life cut short but he lived it well. We all testify to this fact.\n\nWith all that being said, I fully agree with Panjwani’s overall proposal: Karbala needs to be taught by Muslims to other Muslims and non-Muslims as a Universal Event, in the same way we like to extol the Hijra narrative of Makka to Yathrib, the so-called “Golden Age” of Islam marked by profound scientific, technological, philsosphical and cultural contributions to the human story, the reconquest of Al-Quds by Salāhuddin Al-Ayyubi (AKA Saladin), the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453 CE, the Fall of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924 CE, the Colonial Epoch etc. This would go a long way to help change the collective psychology of postcolonial Muslims who are handicapped by contemporary structural Racism and Islamophobia, by the effects of the Colonial Encounter and a millenium of premodern baggage.\n\nIt will boost efforts at Ihyā’, Islāh, Tajdīd, Ijtihād by forcing Muslims to rethink deeply sedimented assumptions in fields such as Politics, Ethics and Fiqh, possibly opening up the terrain to do things differently. Although no desired result is ever guaranteed, and certainly not without struggle undergirding it, this pathway is still worth traversing in and of itself. With Karbala as normative and paradigmatic, it will allow Muslims to more confidently self-assess the direction of this Ummah, enable them to re-evaluate and/or confirm universal human values. As well as that, Karbala can serve as the Model by which to contest perceived deviations by fellow Muslims. It can act as a native epistemological framework arising out of recognisable Islamic principles that could be taken seriously by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. This is the free inheritance that Husayn has bequeathed to the Ummah — let us make use of it!\n\nOne of the most prominent systematic Sunni Islamist thinkers of the twentieth century, Abul A’la al-Maududi (1903–1979 CE) perceptively lists at least seven structural deviations that Karbala vividly demonstrated to any objective critical observer examining how governance in the Caliphate shifted into an Imperialist formation that sought to emulate its non-Muslim and anti-Islamic Sassanian and Roman predecessors:\n\n(1) Loss of Free Elections\n\n(2) Loss of the Advisory System\n\n(3) Loss of Free Expressions of Opinions\n\n(4) Loosening of Responsibilities to Allah and His Creation\n\n(5) Bayt Al-Mal, a Communal Trust, becoming privatised\n\n(6) Breakdown in the Rule of Law\n\n(7) Rise of Social Inequalities in Rights and Status\n\nThere is, quite rightly, a lot of emphasis on “What went wrong?” when it comes to the Umayyads. But they only lasted about ninety years as a ruling dynasty (in the East anyways), their authority subjected to constant rebellions. Decolonisation demands that we Muslims examine our own premodern Islamicate heritage, moving beyond hagiographical readings and rose-tinted views of our predecessors. In this light, I believe that because the succeeding Abbasid dynasty (750–1258 CE) did not really rollback the changes brought into the Islamic polity, merely reforming some hated aspects, and the fact that they lasted for over half a millenium only confirmed the changes brought forth by the Umayyads permenantly (they carried on persecuting the Ahlul Bayt unjustly). It is this imperial trajectory that we Muslims have always come to assume has been divinely-ordained, a standard feature of Islamic practice. Many of us appear unwilling to think outside the Imperial box and dare to at least dream otherwise as we strive to move forwards confidently into the future. This is not to trash on the past achievements (and there are many positive ones) of our premodern counterparts.\n\nLast Muharram 1445 AH, I was moved by creative recollection to write a post that focused on how Imām Husayn cuts across all sectarian divides and can act as a unifying reference point. He is one of those rare Muslim figures who just has that universal dimension to his being, his teachings and, most significantly, his practical actions. A rallying point for all those fed up with constant sectarianism and infighting in the Ummah of Muhammad, he cannot be reduced to polemics between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In his Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, the premodern Sunni Shaykh Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328 CE), beloved to Salafis and Wahhabis, writes in no ambigious terms:\n\n“There is no doubt that al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali and a group of his family were killed unjustly. The murder of al-Husayn was one of the greatest catastrophes in history. His murder – like the assassination of ‘Uthman was one of the central causes for the strife and bloodshed which befell the Muslim community. Verily, his killers are the worst of creation in the eyes of God.”\n\nThose who seek to compartmentalise Husayn/Karbala as a standardised Sunni/Shi’a issue would make only the likes of Yazid smile. It is endemic infighting amongst Muslims that diverts their time, energy, resources and commitments from pursuing and prosecuting justice across this Earth against the hostile Kuffār and deceitful Munāfiqūn. Karbala was not simply yet another upheaval, another Fitna episode, that afflicted the early Muslim community. It was/is a decisive event in Islamicate history, one that still shapes (indirectly) many events that take place today and in the coming future. Yazid cannot simply be presented as a “grey figure” whose few “good qualities” as a pragmatic leader somehow compensates for the murder of the grandson of the Noble Messenger (is this not what we Muslims do today by giving regular free passes to our contemporary immoral rulers in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Pakistan, Egypt who care little about Islam and Muslims?).\n\nFortunately, both Sunnis and Shi’ites have reached a rare joint-consensus: Yazid deviated from the practices of the earlier Muslims without justification. You cannot abstract and isolate that individual from the structure that produced him. The proof of this lies in additional, opposing claims to Khilafa, such as that of Abdullah Ibn Al-Zubayr (martyred in Makka in 692 CE by, you guessed it, the Umayyads). We colonial-modern Muslims are still picking up the tab left by that hereditary dynasty. This is only because we choose to let this happen. When will we choose to stop?\n\nThe reality is that Husayn represents a strong, unbreakable link to the Prophet and his Sunna. We also know from the famous Hadith related by one of the Prophet’s wives that the Messenger of Allah was the Qur’ān-in-Action. As we seek to transcend sectarian hatreds, Husayn/Karbala must form part of the political and epistemological foundations that reinforces Ummah-centric solidarity, unity and brotherhood. This will also assist Muslims in fighting back against ongoing aggressive state-nationalist efforts employing structural Islamophobia to weaken/divide Muslims and prevent a Muslim-led revival that could threaten that false hegemony.\n\nIt was Husayn’s honourable sister, Sayyidah Zaynab رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهَا, who definitively ensured that her brother could not be relegated to Karbala geographically or historically. A survivor of the massacre, she was taken captive with others to Damascus, the urban seat of Umayyad power, where they paraded like animals before the court of Yazid. Imām Husayn’s severed head was presented before this usurper who disgustingly played about with its lips using a stick. At that point, the courageous Zaynab stood up, gave an impassioned sermon and berated Yazid before everyone else:\n\n“O Yazid! Do you think that we have become humble and despicable owing to the martyrdom of our people and our own captivity? As you have blocked all the paths for us, and we have been made captives and are being taken from one place to another, do you think that Allah has taken away his blessings from us? Do you think that by killing the godly persons you have become great and respectable and the Almighty looks at you with special grace and kindness? For this reason and on account of this incorrect thinking you have become elated and arrogant. You have become boastful because you have seen that the matters have taken a turn in your favour… You have shed the blood of the sons of the Holy Prophet and have hidden the brilliant stars on the earth from amongst the descendants of Abdul Muttalib under the clouds of oppression and injustice. However, you shall go before Allah soon. You shall meet your ancestors and shall also be taken to their place. At that time you will wish that you had been blind and dumb and had not said that it was a day of rejoicing for your ancestors”.”\n\nAn outstanding feat: she, a woman, taught this Ummah what it means to have integrity in the midst of steep adversity. Karbala was not an anomaly but a dark harbinger of things to come. Zaynab illustrated to this Ummah that the massacre no accidental tragedy but deliberate, calculated murder, the consequences of which would not escape the wrongdoers. On her own, she powerfully turned a victory celebration into an atmosphere of dread for the murderers. Zaynab stood up for; the oppressed/the wrongdoers, the women, men and children, awakened consciousness, dignity, honour, justice, truth, the principles of Islam, universal morality. For further in-depth analysis of this profound Khutbah that has echoed throughout the ages, consult the following:\n\nThe-Revolutionary-Sermon-of-Sayyidah-Zaynabas.edited.pdf (durrenajaf.com)\n\nZaynab’s Khutbah was another heroic chapter in this story. She stood up boldly, spoke fearlessly and had no fear of the creation, only the Creator. This was a captive woman, a granddaughter of the Noble Messenger, who spoke back to corrupted power in their own space, showcasing how resistance to tyranny (Tāghūt) represents a counterweight power in its own right, something no tyrant like Yazid would ever be able to understand. The Martyrs at Karbala and the survivors at Damascus preserved the essence of Islam. It is high time that we retrieve them in our age. Both men and women everywhere, irrespective of religious identity, have an obligation to check and push back against unjust power structures anywhere on this planet.\n\nIn their bold sacrifices, Husayn and Zaynab together transcend their historical epoch, their geography, their accidental identities. No sect can claim them. Only Allah who is Al-Haqq (The Truth) and Al-’Adl (The Just) can and has claimed them as their Rightful Master. These personalities have ensured that Karbala is a repository of timeless values and that the Ahlul Bayt, so often marginalised, remain the best role model for anyone to love and emulate. The Karbala massacre only antagonised various segments of the Ummah and in less than a hundred years, the Umayyads were overthrown in 750 CE, the leadership being wiped out by their Abbassid successors. In the end, it is clear that Husayn and the Martyrs scored a magnificent victory in the most paradoxical manner. “Victory” comes in many forms, even in the appearance of apparent “Defeat”.\n\nLinks to Palestine\n\nAs I type up these words from a relative position of comfort and privilege, the people of Palestine are being subjected to a vicious genocidal slaughter at the hands of the Zio-Nazi Israeli Racist Fascists. Every day is a bloody Karbala for the Palestinians. There are repeated massacres, some of which can be seen on live TV or on social media which even young children can view, if by accident (!). There are the killings of innocent Palestinian men, women and children, whole families obliterated in seconds, mass urban devastation, depriving humans from food, shelter and accessing clean water suppy, many babies who were waiting to be born out of their mother’s womb and enjoy life “like everyone else”…\n\nLike the premodern Umayyads, the Israelis act with impunity and do not respect others, ethics, the sanctity of life, the rules of warfare, international law. They have usurped power and foolishly believe themselves to be gods. The list of indictment can go on and on but I am sure you get the point. The ongoing Holocaust is causing everybody alive worldwide to question the “normal” way of doing things. From debates around (Il)Liberalism to Colonialism to Imperialism to Human Rights (White Rights?) to World Order to Interntional Law and Norms to Capitalism, a new world is already being birthed and we are currently bearing witness to it all in the heat of the moment. Palestine has irreversibly exposed the racial logics that underpins the laughable description of the “rules-based order”.\n\nKarbala can act as the reference point in relation to analysising the Palestinian Holocaust by which we “postcolonials” can critique, deconstruct and move beyond the the ugliness of racialised colonial-modernity for good. It can serve as the framework by which modern Muslims stand with, by and for the oppressed ethically and politically. Such dynamism can contibute towards the acceleration of decolonisation in the Islamicate (especially in relation to overthrowing unjust rulers who collaborate with the genocidal Israelis). The revolutionary implications of Karbala need to be teased out and then pressed into service of the downtrodden, those who need help the most. It is both natural and necssary to resist injustice, and resistance takes on many forms.\n\nVia Karbala, we can critique abstract universals that sound nice on paper but falter in reality (such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights), seeking revision if not a wholesale rip-up of the concepts (I am in favour of binning the pacifying theo-imperial ideology of Amreekkkan Empire, Liberalism). We can also attack the faulty man-made hierarchies that are perpetuating genocide. The Palestinians remind the world how racism and colonialism are still alive, how they faked their death after 1945 CE and are wholly committed to subjugating non-white populations. By this model, if it can be upscaled and accepted on a mass scale as a normative framework, we can also chart newer futures with utmost fidelity to the Message of Islam.\n\nIt might sound peculiar to say it at this stage but Zionism is dying a slow death. The fascistic methods it is employing demonstrates that it can only survive now on violence. It has lost any persuasive power of voluntary consent from others, apart from the Racists who already identify and support the illegtimate Settler-Colony. Violence begets (Counter-Violence). The Palestinians are assured a magnificent triumph soon enough. The Umayyads did not last long after Karbala; neither will the Israelis after this genocide. Most of the world hates the Israelis. This will never change from now on. The Israelis might think they can get away with their crimes but the reality is they are only digging a larger abyss for themselves, veiled from the Divine. They are not strong when they bomb innocents and flatten buildings. They are cowards who cannot face up to their own wrongdoing, like Yazid before Zaynab.\n\nWhen Sayyidah Zaynab stood up at Damascus before Yazid, Karbala transcended Karbala. Likewise, when everybody around the world stands up for the victims of the ongoing genocide, Palestine automatically becomes bigger than Palestine. It becomes a uncontainable symbol, an idea that can never, ever be killed off. The brave and noble Palestinians under occupation are standing up to preserve the honour of the Muslim Ummah, the sanctity of Masjid Al-Aqsa (Islam’s third holiest site) and fundamentally for universal human dignity. We are all creations of the One God, honoured and beloved to Him. He has not created us so that we maim and kill one another in hatred. The Palestinians will be honoured in this world and the next, through life and death. Just as we intrinsically know that the massacre at Karbala was absolutely wrong, we also feel the same when we see the devastation the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and even in Lebanon.\n\nLike Imam Husayn and his followers, the Palestinians recognise that living with injustice and tyranny is not only unbearable, it is unacceptable and must be fought. They are willing to become martyrs in the militant fight to liberate their homeland (a reminder that this right to resist occupation is enshrined in international law, whatever that fact may be worth these days). They are bearing witness to a fundamentally unjust status quo and the need for radical global transformative change — there can be no going “back to normal” after genocide. Everything must change so that nothing can remain the same. No more reform. the Dunya of Colonial-Modernity must be destroyed once and for all, theoretically and practically.\n\nRemembering Karbala is to cry out for justice, for respect for all of creation, for a restoration of basic rights, honour and dignity. Remembering Karbala is to revisit the essentials undergirding Islamic practice. There can be no compromise with the commands ordained by Allah the Most High collectively upon His Creation. You do not have to be a Muslim to appreciate what happened at Karbala and what is happening in Palestine. Of course, it is not just Palestine that is being subjected to a devastating genocide. There is a civil war raging hard in Sudan, claiming the lives of thousands and hardly anybody is talking about it (Anti-blackness under White Supremacist conditions no doubt plays a structural role). Similarly in the Congo, violence rages with increasing intensity. Meanwhile, does anybody remember the Rohingyas in Burma? The Uighurs in East Turkestan (Xinjiang)? Does anybody still care about Kashmir?\n\nMuslims and the decolonially-minded would do well to link up the struggles of the oppressed. Imam Husayn would definitely have tried to that, or become a Shahīd trying…\n\nThe Imam of the Palestinians is Imam Husayn.\n\nThe Imam of the Oppressed is Imam Husayn.\n\nThe Imam of the Shuhada’ is Imam Husayn.\n\nThe Chief of the Youth in Paradise is Imam Husayn.\n\nSome Practical Recommendations Going Forwards (Non-Exhaustive List):\n\nMosques and the education institutions (universities, colleges, Dar Al-’Ulūms, Madāris etc) must teach Muslim students about Karbala inside and outside of Muharram, grounded in a solid trajectory of normative ethics and piety. Sunnis and Shi’ites should host joint conferences on the matter, linking the past to contemporary events.\n\nMuslims should employ Karbala and its aftermath to critically consider and re-evaluate Islamicate history and all of its theological, jurisprudential, philosophical and Sufi productions\n\nMuslims should use Karbala creatively whenever and wherever appropriate to critique the existing order of things in a bid to enact meaningful change. Karbala as a guiding “compass”\n\nMuslims should explore ways of introducing Husayn and the Karbala Model to non-Muslims. One potential space could be at current pro-Palestine protest locations, for example. It could be a reference point to link interconnected decolonial struggles (Palestine-Kashmir-East Turkestan-Burma-Western Sahara etc)\n\nMuslims could use Karbala as a reference point in the building and scaling up of a future non-capitalist Islamicate economy. Bayt Al-Mal was privatised which resulted in social inequalities that Husayn saw and was aggrevied by. Karbala as priortising the Commons and social redistribution of wealth\n\nMuslims should utilise the Karbala Narrative as a way of recovering the heroic element that is being repressed in colonial-modernity. The fearless of Husayn before death should inspire modern Muslims still suffering the psychological effects to forgo their fear of the Kuffār and be brave and courageous when it comes down to doing what is necessary. The Palestinians are showing the way to the future. One lesson that the Sunni scholar Abul Kalam Azad derived from studying Karbala was to follow Husayn in acting righteously, without fearing consequences from the rest of creation\n\nMuslims could use Karbala as a research model to critically investigate the causes and perpetuation of structural vices such as authoritarianism (which plagues most of the modern Islamicate today) and seek to derive viable solutions that match both short-term and long-term requirements. Researchers could also examine what effects Karbala has had on events in posterity e.g. the Islamic Revolution in Iran, 1979 CE and whether or not this can be replicated elsewhere\n\nMuslims should use Karbala to think about human rights, duties and responsibilities, especially as we now enter a post-liberal era where old fashion racist genocidal colonial-imperialism is back in vogue publicly and unabashedly. We lack a “great power” that can protect us Muslims and further our interests globally. Regardless, the stripping away of civil liberties, interntional law renders the world much more prone to conflict, both to Muslims and non-Muslims\n\nMuslims should seek to challenge their feelings and thoughts about Karbala more at the cultural level. This means going beyond social gatherings and poetry recitations. It means investing the narrative in other literary, media and digital productions that can reach audiences across the world who deserve to know about this immense event. Culture is the space where Karbala can appear alongside Palestine and other spaces seemlessly. All production is social; Sunnis and Shi’ites can collaborate jointly on this\n\nGiven all the contemporary concerns about there being a “crisis of masculinity” and a breakdown in both extended and nuclear family models in colonial-modernity, priotising the emulation of the Ahlul Bayt should be emphasised by Muslims. ‘Ali, Fatimah, Hassan, Husayn, Zaynab رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ — these outstanding personalities can teach us what it means to be a Muslim family and upon what basis we can educate our youth. The recovery of Tarbiyya and Futuwwah is paramount\n\nEtc.\n\nOn a final note, there have been cultural film efforts to make Karbala relevant to us “postcolonials”. I recommend a fantastic film with the finale truly heartbreaking to any viewer, The Blood of Hussein (1980) by Jamil Dehlavi which explores the Husayn/Yazid dialectic playing out in 1980s Pakistan, then under a military dictatorship. The highly subversive film is (apparently) still banned from public viewing inside Pakistan. The only issue I have is that there are not many more of these type of wonderful, intelligent and creative productions! Seeing as we are in a highly digital/electronic age, film/media production is probably the best space from which Karbala can be recontextualised and be made practically relevant for anybody willing to listen/see and learn in this time of immense upheavel across the world.\n\nMy fellow Muslims, I implore you — be brave, be bold and become highly creative with your Da’wa efforts!"
