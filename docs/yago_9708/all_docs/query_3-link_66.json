        "text": "I try to support various charities below, donating works, partnering with projects that fundraise for their cause or fundraising. I also try to donate a portion of my yearly sales to charity where possible. My dear mother died of Leukaemia in 2018 and supporting Blood cancer causes is very close to my heart.\n\n2023:\n\nWinter 2023 - I have partnered with Art for Autism, a creative-led platform, dedicated to raising funds to support the ASD community, where you can purchase artworks from a curation of global emerging and established artists.\n\nI am continuing to support local foodbanks with a portion of all orders going to local foodbanks such as Sufra NW London and also supporting cancer charities, London Air Ambulance and Greenpeace\n\nI have also donated artworks to in order to support the following:\n\nI donate an art piece yearly to The Big Bid auction, organised by Liz Kingdon in support of Coppafeel! For breast cancer.\n\nRe-opening of the Vagina Museum, 100% of funds from auctioned donated artwork went directly to the Museum to continue its work and remain open as a valuable learning resource.\n\nArt for Life Auction, 100% of funds from auctioned donated artwork went directly to Bowel Cancer UK in memory of Lucy Ogilvie\n\nMarch 2020 update: During the Covid-19 outbreak, I am supporting local foodbanks using a portion of all orders during this time.\n\nSupporting Blood Cancer UK\n\nIn loving memory of our beautiful mum, Teresita Doria Nicolas, our beating heart who left us too soon and who loved life. #TeresitaDoriaNicolas\n\nMy mum was diagnosed at the end of October 2017 with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, a very aggressive blood cancer.\n\nDue to the nature of her cancer, my mum needed immediate treatment with chemotherapy, entailing an initial introductory phase followed by a very aggressive second phase. During the early weeks of my mum's treatment she was able to come home once she had recovered from a short phase 1 of chemo. When phase 2 started we were able to visit the hospital daily to receive her treatment and then go home each day. It was during these first few days of phase 2 that my mum started to talk about her admiration of the staff in all the various supporting departments which cared for her and others like her, enabling them to fight cancer with the best possible chance. Although my mum didn't survive caner, it’s important we continue to support cancer research so that those who are diagnosed in the future have a better chance. My mum would really like to help raise funds for The Blood Fund supporting the department of Haematology at Hammersmith Hospital and so a portion of all sales on my website will be donated to the Blood Fund.\n\nAt the beginning of 2019 Bloodwise, now Blood Cancer UK asked me if I would donate my time to collaborate on a project with them, creating a special series of products.\n\nI'm so proud to have been a part of this, they are beautiful favours for special occasions such as weddings, or just wonderful small gifts for yourself and your loved ones.\n\n100% of profits help to fund world-class research, ensure everyone affected by blood cancer has access to the right support and campaign for better treatments, and as many of you know this cause is so close to mine and my family's heart."
