        "text": "Like every year, this year too on 10th Muharram, people of all religions together donated blood in the memory of Imam Hussain.\n\nToday, on the occasion of Muharram, Anjuman Ghulam-e-Mohammad organised a blood donation camp in the memory of Imam Hussain in Bhopal. Just as Imam Hussain kept humanity alive by sacrificing his life, today in the same way people of all religions and all sections participated enthusiastically in this noble cause and paid tribute to Imam Hussain by donating blood.\n\nIn total, 45 units of blood were donated. This blood donation was organised by Mohsin Naqvi and Syed Abid Hussain. Mohsin Naqvi said that Hazrat Imam Hussain was the grandson of Prophet of Islam Hazrat Mohammad Saheb, who fearlessly and bravely raised the voice of man and humanity against injustice and terrorism.\n\nHazrat Imam Hussain refused to accept the authority of the terrorist of that time, Yazid, who had become the Caliph by usurping power through deceit. Due to this refusal, Hazrat Imam Hussain, along with his family and select companions, was martyred in the month of Muharram while fighting against injustice, hungry and thirsty, in the field of Karbala (sandy area of Arabia).\n\nSyed Abid Hussain saidThat sacrifice of Imam Hussain is a source of inspiration not only for Muslims all over the world, but for the entire humanity. Hussain belongs to all of us. That is why we should also offer our tribute of faith to Imam Hussain and his family members who were martyred in Karbala by donating blood in our own way."
