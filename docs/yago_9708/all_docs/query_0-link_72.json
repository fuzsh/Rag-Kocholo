        "text": "A BIGGER SPLASH\n\n(1974, Colour) Director: Jack Hazan\n\n\".....it will live up to its title - for it is far more than a documentary record of David Hockney at work. Paints and canvas play their part in it all right, but not as much as the emotional ties between people - and the emotional separations.......\"\n\nDavid Hockney is the best-known British artist of his generation; hit wit and versatility have made him a popular figure in and out of the art world. A Bigger Splash, which draws its title from one of Hockney's trademark paintings of a California swimming pool, follows his break-up with fellow painter Peter Schlesinger and captures the essence of the artist.\n\nTHE BLOOD OF HUSSAIN\n\n(Pakistan/UK 1981 – 105min, Director Jamil Dehlavi)\n\nSalman Peerzada, Kika Markham. Winner of the Grand Prize at the Taormina Film Festival and screened at the Director’s Fortnight in Cannes. The story of a military dictatorship and the revolutionary movement against it.\n\nGODFORSAKEN\n\n(UK/France 2009 – 90min, Director Jamil Dehlavi) Annabel Wright, Nick Ashdon. A fallen angel seeks redemption for his failure to protect a child in his care. Erotic and gripping.\n\nDROWNING BY NUMBERS\n\n(UK 1988 – 111min, Director Peter Greenaway)\n\nJoely Richardson, Joan Plowright, Bernard Hill. Cissy Coalpitts loves her husband to death and death is what he got. A very rude black comedy.\n\nPROSPERO’S BOOKS\n\n(UK/Netherlands/France/Italy 1991 – 120min, Director Peter Greenaway) John Gielgud, Erland Josephson. A free and exuberant adaptation of Shakespeare using an array of new technologies."
