        "text": "English PEN is deeply saddened by the news that our friend and colleague Raficq Abdulla has died.\n\nA passionate poet, essayist and broadcaster, Raficq was also a valued and dedicated supporter of English PEN. A Trustee of many years, Raficq made valuable contributions to many different aspects of PENâs work, including through his role on the Management Committee and his involvement with our Writers in Translation Committee. In 2014, Raficq took on the role Acting President, guiding the organisation through a period of transition with considerable skill, wisdom and energy. Raficq was a generous colleague and friend and will be greatly missed by us all.\n\n** The memorial service which was due to take place on Thursday 19 March has been postponed. This decision has been made in light of the developing public health situation, and we hope to be able to reschedule in the near future.**\n\nIn the meantime, we are inviting friends and colleagues to send your tributes to Raficq to share here and with his loved ones. Please send your memories, thoughts and photos to [email protected]\n\n***\n\nIt was a lovely thing to walk into a room where Raficq was. That clear, bright smile, that genuine openness and interest in the people around him. He served on the editorial board for In Other Words, the literary translation journal for which Iâm one of the editors, and was a wonder to work with, always wearing his erudition and searching intelligence lightly, always adept in enabling others to be heard, and such an asset to us in his lawyerly acuity. In an email he sent on some proofs in 2018, advising us to ask one of our authors to better substantiate her article (which included allegations against a publisher), he said: ‘Iâm sorry to take this position, I like the combative tone, Iâm on the side of the angels but I need the angels to grow more feathers, if not wings.’ This was Raficq all over, and not only in his ability for a juste metaphor. He gave so much of himself to the angelic causes that it meant his incisive good sense came through with generosity. I know everyone involved in In Other Words will miss him.\n\n– Thomas Bunstead\n\n***\n\nRaficq was a truly incredible person. On a personal level, he was always incredibly generous with his time. He made the effort to introduce me to PEN and I know he helped many people in their various walks of life.\n\nRaficq was a true scholar and defender of the rights of writers. His beautiful poetry will always be with us.\n\n– Mike Harris\n\n***\n\nI had the privilege of serving alongside Raficq for five years on the Board of English PEN. He was a terrific Trustee: wise, impassioned, dedicated and collaborative. He made an enormous impact on PEN and did so much to champion the cause of writers and of freedom of expression. I admired Raficq very much as a colleague, but I admired him even more as a person. He was such a kind and thoughtful man, and he had really sharp sense of humour, which I loved. He had a fierce intelligence which he wore lightly, and I learnt a great deal from him. He shall be very much missed, but I feel proud to have known him and will remember him fondly, always.\n\n– Charlie King\n\n***\n\nRaficq was the warmest and kindest person imaginable. He welcomed me into PEN as if I were an old friend whoâd just stepped out of the room. To me he seemed the incarnation of the best kind of humanist, as if he were meeting every situation afresh and without prejudice, always ready to find common ground and so quick to laugh. It was obvious he was deeply intelligent and passionately engaged in the work and of course in his own work, and very serious about both. But at the same time he made you feel you were engaged in an endeavour that above all would be the greatest – and possibly the wickedest – fun. As if he always had a sense of how lucky we were to be there, all together, at that moment in time, to be doing that work, to be alive. So I – and I am sure so very many others – are sad beyond words to learn this terrible news.\n\n– Lulu Norman\n\n***\n\nRaficq was always a dedicated and enthusiastic supporter of English PEN’s work. When he joined the organisation as a trustee I got to know him better, and I was amazed to discover his incredibly wide range of interests and achievements, as well as his warmth and mischievous sense of fun. He was incredibly passionate about poetry, and once he discovered that I wrote myself he never ceased to encourage me and take an interest. His first question when I saw him was always, ‘and are you writing?’ and he was unerring in his conviction that writing was an important force for good and change that demanded to be taken seriously. He will be much missed.\n\n– Sarah Hesketh\n\n***\n\nIt was such a joy to serve with Raficq on the PEN board. He was all those things you would want in a fellow trustee â dedicated, reliable, able to listen and also to speak eloquently, and prepared to roll up his sleeves and do the work without complaint â but he was also much more than that. A lovely man he saw people, actually saw them for who they were and for what they were going through, and yet he never judged. He treated everybody with equal compassion and at the same time he treated us all to his impish charm. We will miss him, all of us, and particularly those of us who were privileged to work alongside him for so long.\n\n– Gillian Slovo and Kamila Shamsie.\n\n***\n\nRaficq was a key member of the British Centre for Literary Translationâs Advisory Panel when I came to know him and offered unwavering support, critical friendship and commitment to his colleagues there and at National Centre for Writing (then Writersâ Centre Norwich) as well as to the art, craft and power of literary translation â particularly in service of freedom of expression. This support continued through his ongoing role with In Other Words â the national journal for practising literary translators â where the breadth, depth and generosity of his intellect and networks were always made available to his colleagues on the Editorial Board.\n\nHe noted to us in an email from last year (and in response to a discussion about a future edition of In Other Words focusing on the role of translator) that âRoles demand honesty and balance in todayâs binary world of narcissistic displacement and rhetorical assertions. Heroes are not automatically models. Utopias are inherently problematic.â His lawyerly concision always seemed to find a happy meeting with his artistic and intellectual energies and he wasnât wrong: he himself offered honesty and balance in his every dealing with us. We will miss him.\n\n– Chris Gribble\n\n***\n\nI first met Raficq in the basement of the Poetry CafÃ©, Covent Garden. An evening of international poets convened by Exiled Writers Ink in support of Palestinians in Gaza, the place was crammed with writers and avid listeners.\n\nRaficq stood up, imposing in his rangy, eagle eyed six-footedness.\n\nEmanating the mindset of an occupying regime, he pinned his eyes on the\n\naudience and read out his Wall poems. Elegantly,\n\nhe threw down the gauntlet, spitting out measured rage and frustration with a wrangling\n\ndeadlock eked out for over half a century without a chink of recognition\n\nyielding to common humanity. A wall indeed.\n\nSharply challenging, his poems were acute and personal in the\n\nsame breath. I was transfixed. I felt as if he was addressing me, a Jew alongside\n\ncommunities of all faiths ranged behind me, present and absent. I approached him\n\nas if drawn by a magnet. We became firm friends.\n\nHe invited me to an evening he was chairing at the Arcola Theatre:\n\nan interview with film director Jamil Dehlavi with whom heâd\n\nwritten the film scripts Blood of Hussein\n\nand Born of Fire. It was a task he undertook with acuity and zest.\n\nHe had the capacity to set the room alight with his questing, darting curiosity\n\nand intellect, interjecting only when necessary, stimulating debate and steering\n\nus, the audience into impromptu conversation.\n\nHe came to see me incarnate a Liverpudlian teenager doing the\n\ntwist and a 98-year-old Greek great-grandmother jigging across the stage of\n\nSouthwark Playhouse in Visible Theatreâs epic: Who do we think we are? He brought with him a Norwegian pianist,\n\never extending the links of communication between all of us involved in the\n\narts, politics and interdisciplinary collaborations. I could feel his delight\n\nin the energy radiating back-and-forth between actors and audience, our work\n\nrendered more vivid through his eyes.\n\nNot only did he bring his sharp, iridescent poetry to my own\n\ninformal salons in Hackney but he took part in those events with a bracing upbraiding\n\nof everyone he encountered: `Who are you? Where, why, when and what?: the\n\nclassic journalistsâ tenet he made his own.\n\nAs a long term member of the Royal Academy, he would usher me\n\nin for free and afterwards sit me down in the coffee shop and challenge me. Why do like this painting? How exactly do you view that film about\n\nShelley? What is it about Yeatsâ poetry\n\nthat affects you? Analysing the heart of the discourse: my discourse, rendering me more confident and alive, such was his\n\ngenerosity and largesse of spirit.\n\nHis restless mind was so fast-moving, his beam so focused, so\n\nalert to new situations, modestly belying his own brilliance. Presiding over book\n\nlaunches for his work on the Islamic mystics Rumi and Attar, his Reflecting Mercury: Dreaming Shakespeare’s\n\nSonnets and recent co-authoring with fellow musketeer Mohamed\n\nKeshavjee Understanding Sharia Law\n\nin a Globalised World,\n\nIâve seen him capture audiences with wit, clarity and charm.\n\nAnd he was angry, so angry with the forces of reaction facing\n\nus here and internationally. Apart from being a fine poet with a poetâs\n\nsensibilities and delight in language, he was a keen radical, expressed via his\n\naward-winning, multi-faith work, his community activism, his involvement with English\n\nPEN, his sensitive intervention in issues of public and private importance, his\n\nlatest, upcoming collection from a prolific output.\n\nIn the wake of an uncouth, cataclysmic electoral result\n\naffecting the future of our childrenâs children, I have appropriated his warm,\n\nconfrontational manner myself. In his name, I now strike up conversations and altercations\n\nwith every innocent passer-by I meet, be they on the bus, at the railway\n\nstation or even in the street. Where, why, when, how and what next?\n\nCelebrating his playful, quicksilver spirit, we must cherish his flame and that of his wife Marianne, who – alongside their devoted son Adam – provided the steady, yin-yang balance that underlay and lengthened their enduring partnership. We should strive to embody his goodness and be as radical as we possibly can – with kindness, with sensitivity, with an open mind – but true, with a marvelling, ever piercing gaze.\n\n– Norma Cohen\n\n***\n\nI knew Raficq Abdulla for many years and long admired his energy and commitment to the causes close to his heart. He was a regular performer of his poetry at our Exiled Lit Cafe nights. It was clear that he was intensely close to the spiritualism of Sufi poetry and I particularly recall an evening of his own mystic poetry at which he also presented and discussed the work of Rumi and Attar. In fact he published two books of new interpretations of the work of these mystic poets: Words of Paradise: Selected Poems of Rumi (Frances Lincoln, 2000) and Conference of the Birds: Selected Sufi Poetry of Attar (Frances Lincoln, 2003).\n\nIt was always evident that he cared deeply about human rights and\n\npeace, a sensibility which he expressed through his poetry and\n\nparticipation in our literary activism events. This was exemplified by\n\nhis contribution to Poets for Peace in Colombia organised\n\nby our late chair, Fatieh Saudi, and in 2014 he was one of the Arab and\n\ninternational poets who read their work in support of Palestinians in\n\nGaza. Raficq was a profoundly deep and reflective thinker and I remember\n\nthe impressive paper he presented to our\n\n2012 symposium âHospitality Poeticaâ in relation to the âotherâ.\n\nNow I realise that I was familiar with only a few facets of Raficq Abdulla\n\nas he was always a modest man and I am saddened that I was not more\n\naware of all his other prodigious achievements in terms of law and\n\nscholarship on Islam.\n\nWe will miss him at Exiled Writers Ink.\n\nDr Jennifer Langer. Founding Director Exiled Writers Ink\n\nwww.exiledwriters.co.uk\n\n***\n\nRaficq Abdulla, besides being a co-author of a book we wrote\n\ntogether, was a friend. During our collaboration what came through each\n\ntime was his sense of fairness, honesty, intellectual incisiveness and\n\nnon-judgmentalism. He believed in freedom and abjured authoritarianism\n\nregardless of wherever it came from. He was always suspicious of\n\ncertainty. He was secular in his outlook but believed in the inner life\n\nand the need to search for the mysteries of the universe with the\n\nhumility of knowing his limitations. He always asked the rhetorical\n\nquestion: âhow do we even know that we do not know, and how will we ever\n\nknow?â\n\nRaficqâs activities covered a wide range of interests including\n\nmusic, poetry, an appreciation for art and above all a love for people.\n\nHe was curious and took great delight in getting to know someone when he\n\nwas introduced to them. He was a good listener. He was always ready to\n\nshare his knowledge and he embodied a strong sense of social justice. A\n\nman of prodigious curiosity, Raficq was a constant learner and used his\n\neducation and contacts to help others including the most marginalized in\n\nsociety. He was a mentor and made people feel that they could achieve\n\nthe highest self-fulfilment that they were capable of. A voice of reason\n\nand moderation, he played an important role in promoting greater\n\ninterfaith understanding in the United Kingdom and elsewhere through the\n\nmedium of the humanities and more particularly through his writing and\n\npoetry.\n\nA remarkable individual, Raficq will be missed by many for his\n\nwarmth, his sense of humour, his sharp mind and his willingness to\n\nengage in a good argument.\n\n– Mohamed M Keshavjee\n\n***\n\nOne of the greats!\n\nI came to know Raficq as the editor on his last book, an introduction\n\nto Sharia. From the very first meeting Raficqâs enquiring mind, his\n\nsense of humour, his love of serious music, his passion for poetry, his\n\nlove of female company and above all his dedicated and scholarly\n\napproach to the subject we were working on â these all dictated that we\n\nwould become fast friends, and from that point I was ineluctably drawn\n\ninto his wider life of wonderful family (for who could not fall in love\n\nwith his fantastic wife) and friends from the worlds of music, poetry\n\nand literature. We spent a good few evenings trotting off to concerts â\n\nparticularly at Pushkin House where we listened entranced to the\n\nvirtuouso Japanese pianst Maki Sekiya, the weird and wonderful Theramin\n\nproponent Lydia Kavina, or watching and crying over Janacekâs Jenufa. It\n\nwas Raficq who pushed me to write and publish articles on various bits\n\nof Arabic poetry that had gripped me and also to write more of my own\n\npoetry. He was always willing to read anything I had written and his\n\nlove for the written word knew no bounds.\n\nRaficq was a great man and never shy about his dedication to seeking\n\nout young brains who could produce works of culture, of thinking, of\n\nconsideration, and of beauty. I am sure that anyone who had even a\n\npassing acquaintance with him has had his/her life immeasurably improved\n\nand we will all miss him sorely.\n\n– Russell Harris\n\n***\n\nI first met Raficq when we both worked at the charity Scope. He soon became a friend, source of advice and support as well as a valued colleague.\n\nThe charity was going through a turbulent period and Raficq brought a wonderful combination of calmness and commitment. Professionally he contributed excellent advice on legal issues including ethical governance. His advocacy for what was right were powerfully positive.\n\nRaficqâs wider interests in Islamic culture, poetry and literature and human rights always enriched any conversation. His passion and humanity always shone through.\n\nI was privileged to continue our friendship after we had both moved on from Scope. He was always there for a conversation, advice and support, and a gentle challenge when that was necessary.\n\nI am so sorry that we had not met nor spoken for a few years. This was a loss.\n\nThere will be very many people who will be sadden by Raficqâs death and who will miss him. He was truly a great man, friend and scholar.\n\n– John Tizard"
