        "text": "KARACHI: As Pakistani horror film 'In Flames' becomes the second one from the country in 43 years to head to the Directors’ Fortnight, an event that runs parallel to the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, its lead actress Bakhtawar Mazhar described the development as a “great moment for Pakistani cinema”.\n\nWritten and directed by award-winning Canadian-Pakistani filmmaker Zarrar Kahn, In Flames is the second Pakistani film to make it to the Quinzaine des Cineastes (Directors’ Fortnight), an independent selection launched in 1969 that runs parallel to Festival de Cannes (Cannes Film Festival) in France.\n\nThe first from the South Asian country to achieve the feat was Jamil Dehlavi’s ‘The Blood of Hussain’ which was screened at Cannes under the same segment in 1980\n\n“I feel nervous for tomorrow but at the same time, I am so excited and so proud to be one of the very few artists to have made it to the Cannes,” Mazhar told Arab News from Cannes. “It’s a great moment for Pakistani cinema.”\n\nIn Flames is one of the 20 feature films and 10 short features that will run at the Quinzaine des Cineastes. It is overseen by French Directors’ Guild. The film will have its world premiere at Cannes on Friday, May 19.\n\nIt explores the struggles of a Pakistani mother and her daughter who try to survive in a Pakistani patriarchal society. “A lot of it is about the daughter’s dilemma and the daughter’s traumas,” Mazhar said. She plays the mother.\n\nThe film was shot in Karachi in early 2022. Interestingly, Mazhar will be watching the film for the first time herself at the Cannes screening.\n\nThe actress lauded the film’s inclusion in the Directors’ Fortnight, saying that it is a prestigious sidebar at the Cannes Festival.\n\n“People actually look up to the Directors’ Fortnight for meaningful stuff. There are different genres and different stories. Films are chosen and selected by a whole panel to be a part of this,\" Mazhar said.\n\n\"They must have judged the film on so many tiny things because every year they get hundreds of entries from all over the world.”\n\nThe event kicked off on May 16 and will run till May 27. In Flames will have its press screening on May 19, followed by a question-and-answer session. According to Mazhar, the film will have a little red carpet event, followed by its world premiere the same night. The film also has multiple screenings lined up on May 20.\n\nIn Flames marks Mazhar’s feature film debut, with the actress calling it a “huge honor” for the film to have made it to Cannes. She started her acting career with theatre in Pakistan almost two decades ago. One of her most recent works in theater included legendary actor and TV broadcaster Zia Mohyeddin’s adaptation of 'Romeo And Juliet'.\n\nISLAMABAD: A high-ranking delegation from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Tuesday called on Pakistan’s deputy prime minister, Ishaq Dar, and discussed with him investment in Pakistan’s maritime, railways and aviation sectors, Dar’s office said.\n\nThe development comes amid a push for foreign investment by the South Asian country, which has been facing low foreign exchange reserves, currency devaluation and high inflation for the last one year.\n\nSince avoiding a default last year, Pakistan has been making desperate attempts to revive its fragile $350 billion economy and reached a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July for a new $7 billion loan.\n\nThe UAE delegation, which called on the deputy prime minister, was led by Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al-Maktoum, according to Dar’s office.\n\n“The talks focused on investment opportunities in Pakistan’s maritime, railways, and aviation sectors,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe UAE is one of Pakistan’s closest allies and has frequently bailed out the South Asian country, joining Saudi Arabia and China in rolling over billions of dollars of loans in support to the South Asian country.\n\nIn May, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan announced $10 billion investment in Pakistan during a visit by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to the Gulf country, according to Sharif’s Office.\n\nThe South Asian nation this year also signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi (AD) Ports Group, which will be investing about $395 million for the development of a container and cargo terminal under a government-to-government (G2G) agreement between the UAE and Pakistan.\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog on Tuesday filed a fresh graft case against former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Khan, for illegally retaining a jewelry set from a state repository, local media reported.\n\nThe case, also called the new Toshakhana reference, came to the fore after the watchdog, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), arrested the couple following their acquittal in an illegal marriage case on July 13.\n\nIt pertains to a jewelry set, comprising a ring, bracelet, necklace a pair of earrings worth over €380,000, gifted to the former first lady by a foreign dignitary that was allegedly undervalued by the couple and retained against a lesser price.\n\nThe NAB reference, which consists of two volumes, was filed by investigation officer Mohsin Haroon and case officer Waqar Hassan in an accountability court, Pakistan’s Geo News channel reported.\n\n“The fresh reference will now be reviewed by the registrar of the accountability courts,” the report read. “After removing the objections, the reference will be sent to the administrative judge.”\n\nOn Monday, an accountability court sent Khan and his wife to jail on a 15-day judicial remand in the new Toshakhana reference, after the couple appeared before the court following the expiry of their 10-day physical remand and submitted a written answer in response to a questionnaire by the accountability watchdog.\n\nThe ex-premier, who has been in jail since last August, was convicted in four cases. Two of the cases have since been suspended and he was acquitted in the remaining two, including the illegal marriage case.\n\nKhan’s convictions had ruled the 71-year-old out of the February general elections as convicted felons cannot run for public office under the Pakistani law. Arguably Pakistan’s most popular politician, Khan says the cases against him are “politically motivated,” aimed at keeping him from returning to power. Pakistani authorities deny this.\n\nThe ex-premier is also facing multiple cases relating to May 9, 2023 protests, which saw his supporters attack government and military installations over his brief arrest in a graft case.\n\nIn a separate development on Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court acquitted Khan’s wife in 12 cases relating to May 9, 2023 violence.\n\nISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered authorities to resolve all issues relating to Meta operations in Pakistan, Sharif’s office said on Tuesday, amid complaints of slow Internet in the South Asian country.\n\nSharif issued the directives at a meeting with a five-member Meta delegation, led by Meta Vice President for Asia Pacific Simon Milner, in Islamabad.\n\nThe development came amid snail-paced Internet speeds in the country in recent weeks, which have particularly affected online businesses and freelancers.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Meta delegation apprised the prime minister of their services in Pakistan and the Asia Pacific region, according to Sharif’s office.\n\n“Both sides expressed their resolve to work together for the development and promotion of digital media and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors in Pakistan,” Sharif’s office said in a statement.\n\nMeta, a California-based American multinational technology conglomerate, owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp among other products and digital services.\n\nThe meeting came days after the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) warned that frequent Internet disruptions and low speeds caused by poor implementation of a nationwide firewall had led many multinational companies to consider relocating their offices out of Pakistan, with some having “already done so.”\n\nPakistan has been installing the firewall to block malicious content, protect government networks from attacks, and allow the government to identify IP addresses associated with what it calls “anti-state propaganda,” according to officials.\n\nSeparately, the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) said last Thursday that Pakistan’s economy could lose up to $300 million due to Internet disruptions caused by the imposition of the firewall.\n\nISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday summoned representatives from the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) and the Ministry of Information Technology on August 26 to respond to senior journalist and television anchor Hamid Mir’s petition regarding the countrywide Internet slowdown amid the installation of a national firewall.\n\nAccording to the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan, nationwide Internet speeds have dropped by 30-40 percent in the last few weeks as the government operationalizes the firewall intended to filter undesired content, such as “anti-state propaganda.”\n\nPakistan’s State Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja rejected reports over the weekend that the government was responsible for slowing or shutting down the Internet in the country, attributing it instead to the widespread use of virtual private networks (VPNs) amid the ban on social media platform X.\n\nMir filed his petition through Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari on Friday, describing the frequent network disruptions in recent weeks as a violation of citizens’ fundamental rights, while challenging the government’s denial of its contribution to the situation.\n\n“During today’s hearing, the chief justice issued notices to PTA and the IT ministry for the next hearing on August 26 and asked why the Internet is slow and what is the firewall,” Mir told Arab News.\n\nHe said the IHC registrar initially raised some objections to his petition, but Chief Justice Aamer Farooq overruled them and scheduled the case for a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nMir noted in his petition he was aggrieved by the government’s conduct, which had caused him and his colleagues significant difficulties in performing their duties as professional journalists, heavily reliant on online connectivity and communication.\n\nHe maintained that young people, particularly students, were also facing substantial challenges.\n\nSpeaking to Arab News, the president of the Pakistan Freelancers Association said last week the businesses of over 2.3 million Pakistani freelance workers had suffered due to the slow Internet.\n\nAfter Tuesday’s hearing, Mir’s lawyer informed the court was fully aware of the Internet disruption affecting the entire country.\n\n“The honorable court inquired about the reasons behind the disruption and sought the government’s stance on the issue,” Mazari said, adding the additional attorney general was unable to provide a satisfactory response, saying he did not use the Internet frequently and was unaware of the situation.\n\nShe added that the chief justice observed the Internet disruption in Pakistan was a matter of common knowledge before summoning representatives from the PTA and IT ministry for the next hearing on August 26.\n\nAsked about the state minister for information technology’s assertion regarding the Internet slowdown, Mazari said it was factually incorrect that it was caused by VPN use.\n\nArab News reached out to the PTA and the Ministry of IT for their comments, but they did not respond by the time this story was filed.\n\nISLAMABAD: Google on Tuesday announced the launch of a special program for Pakistani journalists to help them produce accurate and engaging digital stories, in collaboration with a Pakistani social enterprise, Tech Valley.\n\nThe program, ‘Digital Sahafat,’ or Digital Journalism, is part of the Google News Initiative (GNI) that works with publishers and journalists to fight misinformation, share resources and build a diverse and innovative news ecosystem.\n\n“We’re very excited to announce the launch of Digital Sahafat, a program by the Google News Initiative, in partnership with Tech Valley, to equip 1,000 journalists in Pakistan with the essential tools, training, and resources to produce accurate and engaging digital news stories,” the GNI said in a statement.\n\nThe program will be formally launched in Islamabad on September 4, according to the GNI. The event will be addressed by Kate Beddoe, managing director of Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC) News Partnerships at Google, and the Tech Valley team.\n\nThe GNI has supported journalism worldwide and continues to build on Google’s decades-long dialogue and collaboration in the news industry as part of a global effort to build a more sustainable and equitable news ecosystem. Since 2018, it has partnered with thousands of news organizations in more than a hundred countries to provide tools, programs, and workshops that help publishers worldwide in boosting readership and revenue as they evolve their businesses.\n\nFounded in 2015, Tech Valley aims to bring together public and private sectors of Pakistan by bridging the gap between academia, industry and the government through technology and innovation."
