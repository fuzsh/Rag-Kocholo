Political, subversive and artistically maverick, Pakistan’s leading filmmaker Jamil Dehlavi’s remarkable body of work stands out for its originality and engagement with social and political questions. His vision captures the diversity and power of both the religious and the secular in everyday life.

Following August’s Dehlavi season at BFI Southbank, on 22 October 2018 the BFI brings his 1980 film The Blood of Hussain (banned in Pakistan) to Blu-ray/DVD for the first time anywhere. This Dual Format Edition includes Towers of Silence (1975) and other special features.

Synopsis

In The Blood of Hussain, the annual mourning procession for the murdered Hussain, grandson of the prophet Muhammad, is the setting for an allegorical tale of revolutionary struggle against injustice and oppression. Banned by successive military regimes in Pakistan, the film has achieved legendary status in its country of origin.

Dehlavi’s Towers of Silence weaves scenes of Zoroastrian funerary rituals – in which bodies are consumed by vultures – with glimpses of armed insurrection, juxtaposing traumatic landscapes of sex, death and faith.
