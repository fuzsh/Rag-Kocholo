        "text": "\"Srikanth,\" directed by Tushar Hiranandani, stars Rajkummar Rao and Jyothika in the lead roles. The film is inspired by the real-life events of a blind man who strives to challenge society's prejudicial treatment and become successful on his own terms.\n\nKarthi seems to be greatly impressed by the movie and tweeted, \"#Srikanth - Right from the word go, we're with Srikanth Bolla. Our connection with him is instant, and we cheer for him as he makes us laugh and tear up. He surprises us continuously, without a dull moment. #RajkumarRao's outstanding performance and #Tushar's brilliant direction bring this story to life. The world of Srikanth, with his #Devika teacher and Ravi, is truly beautiful. This inspiring film is a must-watch with kids. Congratulations to the entire team!\"\n\nThe film is based on the life and times of industrialist Srikanth Bolla. It follows the struggles of the protagonist, played by Rajkummar Rao, who aspires to achieve great academic milestones. However, society treats him differently and imposes limitations on what he can or cannot do.\n\nThe film also examines the shortcomings in our Indian educational system to facilitate higher education for visually impaired students. Srikanth faces biased treatment from every part of society, making his journey towards success even harder. However, there seem to be a handful of people who believe in him, like his teacher and India's former President APJ Abdul Kalam. In the trailer, Srikanth claims that he received the seed funding for his start-up from Kalam."
