        "text": "What Jyothika said\n\n“I have acted with most of the South Indian superstars. But I can’t help but say that Mammootty is the real superstar. When I met him for the first time when he went to act in Kaathal, I asked, ‘Sir, how did you choose such a role?’ Mammootty replied, ‘Who is the real hero? A real hero should not be someone who just goes and beats up villains, does action or acts in romantic scenes, but also solves problems and fills gaps’.”\n\nAbout Kaathal - The Core\n\nDirected by Jeo Baby of The Great Indian Kitchen-fame, Kaathal - The Core marks Mammootty and Jyothika’s first film together. Penned by Adarsh Sukumaran and Paulson Skaria, the film was produced by Mammootty Kampany and distributed by his son and actor Dulquer Salmaan’s Wayfarer Films. The movie also features actors Joji John, Jisshu Sengupta, Muthumani, Chinnu Chandni, and Sudhi Kozhikodein key roles.\n\nAbout Mammootty\n\nMammootty will be next seen in Yatra 2.
