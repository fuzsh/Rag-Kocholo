Literature creates attention you really can‚Äôt create through anything else. ... It creates a better connection to patients.‚Äù To determine how reading impacts physician burnout, Dr. Marchalik sent surveys to 2,500 doctors. Questions addressed burnout, demographics and reading patterns. Through the process of reading, physicians often exhibit empathy. Researchers then looked at theory-of-mind testing, which is often used when screening for autism. ‚ÄúWhat they show is those who read literary fiction actually performed better in theory of mind, which is actually a surrogate for measuring empathy,‚Äù said Dr. Marchalik. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs doing something special. ... ‚ÄúIt is moving the needle on what is probably the most difficult part of burnout to move the needle on, which is depersonalization,‚Äù he added. One survey of 513 physicians examined the impact of non-medical reading habits on burnout. The chances of emotional exhaustion or depersonalization fell as physicians became more consistent readers. When compared to nonreaders, the relative risk of burnout for consistent readers‚Äîthose who read at least one book per month‚Äîfell by 19 percent across the emotional exhaustion and 44 percent across the depersonalization domain. In an unpublished study by Dr. Marchalik, more than 200 urology trainees were surveyed about work characteristics, as well as relaxation techniques. These included watching movies, meditation, yoga, reading and other ways of relaxing. Meditation, exercise and yoga were not protective against burnout‚Äî but reading was. Controlling for the biggest predictors of burnout, which were resident level, work hours and gender, reading made an impact: the odds of burnout decreased by 59 percent for residents who read for relaxation. A similar effect was seen in Dr. Marchalik‚Äôs national survey of palliative care providers, in which the odds of burnout dropped by 39 percent for readers, even when controlling for age, clinical discipline and the presence of fatigue. Chances of being a reader later in life are significantly higher when literature curriculum is offered in medical school. This raises the chances of being protected from physician burnout too. ‚ÄúPlanting those seeds early makes a huge difference,‚Äù said Dr. Marchalik, who leads Georgetown University‚Äôs Literature and Medicine Track. Medical students complete four years of the literature program, reading one book a month and conclude the program with a capstone writing project. https://lnkd.in/eqX4-5AM #reading #burnoutprevention #bibliotherapy #storiesforwellbeing\n\nI had three super awesome conversations last week, and I am very excited to tell you about them! Ryan McCarthy is the Program Director of internal Medicine Residency at Berkeley Medical Center, WVU School of Medicine. My dad graduated from WVU and I have relatives in W.V.; I just knew I would love talking with Ryan üòä! Ryan started the ‚ÄúHealthcare is Human‚Äù narrative medicine project during the pandemic, which you can find linked in the comments below. His TEDx talk link, ‚ÄúHealthcare is Human: From Pandemic Pain, Stories of Beauty and Light‚Äù can also be found on the website. Ryan published a great article recently on KevinMD: ‚ÄúWhen this doctor gets a zero star rating,‚Äù link in the comments. I learned this fantastic acronym from Ryan: HOPE = Helping Other People Everyday. I love that! Tom Wright is a family physician, personal and team coach (website link in the comments), and wellbeing advocate. His L.I. post content is terrific, we had been communicating that way for a bit, so I was really looking forward to our conversation! Some of Tom‚Äôs recent posts cover topics including decision fatigue, why fairness is such an important thing for human beings, and overcoming perfectionism. Our conversation covered lots of ground, from us sharing some personal stories, to vacation adventures, to me learning from Tom about the British term ‚Äúnever events.‚Äù We had quite a good chat about ‚Äúblame, shame, and never events.‚Äù I can think of a number of LinkedIn connections who would be very happy to connect with Tom and Ryan; I will tag some of you in the comments! Pamela Hobby, oh my goodness, we talked for 2 full hours üòÇ! Pamela is an actor, speaker, and CEO of ‚ÄúMy Doctor‚Äôs Meds‚Äù (link in the comments), whose mission is to help the healers, which is right up my alley! She has Improv experience too! From her website: ‚ÄúWe believe in the power of stories to restore the joy in the practice of medicine and caring for the sick. We curate and provide compelling presentations of patient stories, taking them straight to the medical community's workplaces and classrooms. These presentations bridge the gap between the exceptional burden that medical providers bear for society and the meaning they can glean from hearing a moving experience.‚Äù Pamela is amazing, as are Ryan and Tom, and you will be hearing more from all of us in the future, as we are curating collaborations üòÅ! #physicianadvocacy #physicianwellness #physicianburnout #healthcare #burnoutprevention\n\nAs an empath and extrovert, I always enjoyed starting up conversations with people. I could meet a stranger on a walk in the park and spend hours as we somehow transitioned into a conversation about their deepest, darkest secrets. I can tell that physicians are sometimes confused about my level of knowledge about spinal leaks. And so I will tell you my secret: I talk to people. I was a former PhD candidate working on my dissertation when my health worsened. With a background in teaching at the university level, conducting qualitative research and presenting on this nationally, and putting together instructional materials for school systems, I had the skills to review medical research articles and started reaching out to the physicians who had written the papers. I am also a former spinal leak patient of many of the big names publishing and am well aware of their shortcomings, having been on the receiving end. I networked with many patients as a de facto patient advocate as I grew my TikTok account and reported back on what I was learning from physicians and the research. I found that many of the other patients did not know how to find and analyze research studies, and so I broke this down for them. Building a database of over 5,000 physicians with an assistant, I started reaching out to interventional radiologists and anesthesiologists to gain a better understanding of how they would approach a similar problem. These physicians would sometimes be very open to an in-depth conversation, from telling me everything they knew about spinal leaks and what they had learned in their residencies and fellowships to explaining to me how to read imaging. I quickly recognized that nearly everyone held a small piece of the puzzle to solving spinal leaks but everyone was left in confusion at what the larger picture looked like. With some retired physicians, I offered to pay them to record courses to address the knowledge transfer gap. Time and time again, I saw a theme of them being very open with me as a civilian and even telling me extremely personal things about themselves, but the moment it came to connecting to and sharing with other doctors, they would shut down. At times, as I learned the terminology, they would assume that I was also a doctor even though I was very clear I was a patient. I always thought that the rude ones treated me rudely because I wasn't one of the initiated. One day, a doctor snapped at me after I had written to him and kept demanding to know who I was. I ignored him. A few days later, I got an email from him again. He apologized and was much nicer, saying he had thought I was another physician initially. We then ended up having a deeper conversation. That exchange made me think: do I have an advantage here? I have spent nearly three years with constant feedback and discussions on research with practicing and retired physicians on spinal leaks. Why were they open to teaching me and not younger physicians?\n\nImagine you get hold of a doctor‚Äôs diary. What do you expect to find there? Complaints about patient care? Venting about paying off medical school bills? Stress from ethical dilemmas? Think again. Doctors wouldn't even THINK of owning a diary. They would be too burnt out from their day‚Äôs job, too exhausted from filling documentation, and too demotivated to focus on patient care. Meanwhile, their inner thoughts continue to be suppressed under stacks of documentation reviews on their desk. I am not drawing this picture for the first time. You and I, both, have come across millions of articles on physician burnout, especially during the pandemic. Did we ever stop to reflect on the actual aftermath of these burnouts? Not really. The darker, more distraught effect of physician burnout is ùê©ùê°ùê≤ùê¨ùê¢ùêúùê¢ùêöùêß ùê¨ùêÆùê¢ùêúùê¢ùêùùêûùê¨. THIS horrendous side effect of burnout is hardly known beyond the healthcare industry. It was only during Covid-19 that the public became temporarily aware of the spike in physician burnout. We are all familiar with stats like: From 2020 through 2021, burnout from physician work and intent to leave the profession increased 3x more. Behind those stats hides THESE facts that no one talks about: üìõ Physicians in general face a suicide rate 2x more than the general public population, given one physician dies every day due to job strains. üìõ This also makes burnout-led suicide the second most common cause of death among medical students. AMA reports 3 main factors of depression in the workplace:- ‚ö† Loss of revenue from medical coding errors, ‚ö† Administrative burden and documentation burnout ‚ö† Ethical dilemmas from insufficient communication/ care Solutions like adaption to technology and AI integration to reduce workload burnout are still \"long-term.\" What we need, is awareness and acknowledgement.
