        "text": "Actress Jyothika has started her second innings a few years back in Kollywood. She took a break from acting after getting married to star hero Suriya and having kids. She made a comeback and did some interesting concept-based films before making her way into Bollywood. She had a successful start to 2024 with horror drama 'Shaitaan'. She was seen as Ajay Devgn's wife and Madhavan played the villain's role.\n\nNow, she is busy promoting her upcoming film 'Srikanth' which is a biopic of Srikanth Bolla who founded Bollant Industries. He is a visually handicapped industrialist who became the first blind student in Management Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During a recent interview, the 'Chandramukhi' heroine talked about the prospect of her and her better half Suriya working together again.\n\nShe said, “No, we are not working together these are just rumors, we're still waiting for a good script to come across so right now nothing's on the cards but we surely will work if someone has something really special which is written for both of us as we don't want to come for the sake of coming on screen together.”\n\nSuriya and Jyothika worked in seven movies together till date. They are 'Poovellam Kettuppar', 'Uyirile Kalanthathu', 'Kaakha Kaakha', 'Perazhagan', 'Maayavi', 'June R' and 'Sillunnu Oru Kadhal'.\n\nSuriya is working on 'Kanguva' right now which is his biggest project till date. Shiva is the director and Devi Sri Prasad is the music director. Disha Patani is the female lead while Bobby Deol played the villain role. The release date is yet to be revealed."
