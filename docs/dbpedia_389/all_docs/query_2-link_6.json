        "text": "So someone made a post about John Abraham & Genelia movie Force ( 2011 ) being a remake of 2003 Tamil film Kakaa kakaa starring Suriya and Jo . I watched that movie and I liked both of them . Infact , Suriya was more believable as a dedicated police officer who has no relations in life unlike John who put on extra kilos , tattoos and lifted a bike . Even the song Khwabo Khwabo was recreated from the original one.\n\nAlso, saw their pics on Nayanthara wedding.\n\nWhat their stature is like in Tamil cinema ? They are also Outsiders and self made successful individuals ?"
