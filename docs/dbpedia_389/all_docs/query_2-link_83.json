        "text": "Jyothika has been acting as a lead and in important roles in many films since her comeback with 36 Vayadhinile. The actress was last seen in the Tamil film Udanpirapee as she starred alongside M Sasikumar and Samuthirakani which premiered on Prime Video in 2021. It marked her 50th film and was produced by the celebrity couple Surya and Jyothika under the banner of 2D Entertainment. The film was written and directed by Era. Saravanan with music composed by D. Imman. The films of Jyothika have created anticipation among fans and movie buffs as most of her films have been family dramas.\n\nThe actress is set to make her Hindi comeback with the film Sri. The film is a biopic of the visually-impaired industrialist Srikanth Bolla played by the talented actor Rajkummar Rao. The actress posted a photo in January that she had wrapped up filming her parts in the project directed by Tushar Hiranandani. Jyothika said it was one of the best crews she has worked with and it was an honour to share screen space with one the most brilliant actors in Bollywood, She also said “ What I am taking back from this team as an actor is... GROWTH”. Today, Jyothika shared a short glimpse teaser of the project with the release date of the film. The teaser video features the voice of the film's lead Rajkummar Rao saying \"I might be blind, but I can see dreams and I dream big” in Hindi. The teaser has created anticipation among fans as the film is set to release on 15 September 2023."
