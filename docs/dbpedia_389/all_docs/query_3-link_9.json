Learn what onomatopoeia is, its meaning, definition and how to use it to communicate in this article. Furthermore, check out the sentence examples and the comprehensive list of vocabulary given to have an in-depth understanding of how it works.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Is Onomatopoeia? – Meaning and Definition\n\nHow to Identify and Use Onomatopoeia? – Points to Remember\n\nExamples of Onomatopoeia\n\nExamples of Onomatopoeia from Literature\n\nExamples of Onomatopoeia from Movies and Songs\n\nList of Onomatopoeic Words\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on Onomatopoeia\n\nWhat Is Onomatopoeia? – Meaning and Definition\n\nOnomatopoeia is a figure of speech that uses words to describe the sounds made by all living things including people, animals, birds and all inanimate objects. The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms explains onomatopoeia as “the formation of a word from a sound associated with what is named (e.g. cuckoo, sizzle)” and according to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, onomatopoeia is defined as “the fact of words containing sounds similar to the noises they describe”.\n\nThe Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines onomatopoeia as “the naming of a thing or action by a vocal imitation of the sound associated with it (such as buzz, hiss)” and according to the Cambridge Dictionary, it is defined as “the act of creating or using words that include sounds that are similar to the noises the words refer to”.\n\nHow to Identify and Use Onomatopoeia? – Points to Remember\n\nAs already discussed, the usage of words to describe any sound that is created by a living being, a non-living object or entity is termed onomatopoeia. In some cases, the sound itself is used as the word. For example, ‘meow’ is the sound made by a cat and the onomatopoeic word to mention the sound of cats is also meow. Onomatopoeia can be identified easily. The only thing you will have to look for is see if the word denotes a sound.\n\nExamples of Onomatopoeia\n\nHere are a few examples of onomatopoeia from literature, movies and songs for your reference.\n\nExamples of Onomatopoeia from Literature\n\n“While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n\nAs of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\n“‘Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\n\nOnly this and nothing more.” (‘The Raven’ by Edgar Allen Poe)\n\n“Hark, hark!\n\nBow-wow.\n\nThe watch-dogs bark!\n\nBow-wow.\n\nHark, hark!
