        "text": "I’ve developed a policy for weekend movie-watching over the years: Fridays and Saturdays, anything goes, but Sunday evenings, no depressing films allowed. There’s nothing worse than going to sleep Sunday night after seeing Enemies: A Love Story or Pixote.\n\nUnder this criteria, Chandni Bar should be seen no later than Friday night; it’s a terribly bleak, though honest, portrayal.\n\nMadhur Bhandarkar’s 2001 film opens with Mumtaz (Tabu) sitting at a train station in UP with tears streaming down her cheeks, waiting for a train to Bombay. It’s 1985 and she is fleeing with her uncle from communal violence in their small town that has just burned her parents to death and killed many others. Her fate just goes downhill from there.\n\nTabu narrates at the beginning and end of the film, telling us, in the voice of Mumtaz, how circumstances brought her to dance in a beer bar, and the effect that those experiences had on her life. She is perfect for this role, owing to a certain gravitas she has about her every time I’ve seen her onscreen.\n\nUpon arriving in Bombay, the pair are lucky (depending on how you see it) to meet Iqbal (Rajpal Yadav), a fixer who lives in a poor Muslim neighborhood in Bombay and knows his way around. He finds a small place where the two can live, and he soon suggests to the uncle that Mumtaz could make some fast money dancing as a bar girl. Unworldly, small-town girl that she is, Mumtaz is horrified at the idea, though her uncle takes to it without batting an eye, telling her it’s just so they can survive until he finds a job. (Surprise, surprise, he doesn’t look that hard and quickly abandons his search altogether.)\n\nAt first, the girls are indifferent and/or snarky to Mumtaz, but eventually they warm to her and show her the ways, especially Deepa, whose husband drives an auto and is her pimp. There’s one brief scene where the girls go for a day out in Bombay, and as they stop to eat snacks on the seafront, they tell her “This is where Shakti was filmed!” After Mumtaz’s uncle rapes her one night, and she tells the girls at the bar, they hold her to soothe her, then they tell her to stop crying and all explain their own sad stories that they’ve endured.\n\nThe set for the Chandni Bar itself looks authentic, badly lit and scruffy around the edges (especially the girls’ waiting area/dressing room, complete with peeling movie star posters on the wall and a cracked window in the door, from where they peer out at the customers and other dancers).\n\nThings seem to take a turn for the better when Mumtaz meets Pothia (played by the very excellent Atul Kulkarni), a criminal who falls in love with and marries her. On their wedding night he learns that she was raped and sets off to find her uncle and avenge the crime. In the years after, they have a daughter, Payal, and a son, Abhay. Mumtaz is able to stop working at the bar and resolves that her children will have better lives, but, her dreams are upset when Pothia is killed on the orders of his own mafia boss, in collusion with the police.\n\nMumtaz tries to recoup money from Pothia’s criminal partners, but they either shun her or suggest she goes to Dubai and prostitute herself for a couple of years, so she is forced to return to Chandni Bar, and juggle watching the children with dancing for the customers. She’s keeps her head above water for a few years, using all her strength to send the children to an English language school, when her son, then a teenager, is thrown in jail for something another kid has done, leading to a domino effect of tragic events that touches mother and children equally. There is no happy ending in this film. As Tabu narrates at the end in the voice of Mumtaz “I wanted to see my future in my children, but I saw only my past.”\n\nTo the director’s credit, the movie does not sensationalize the bar girls’ lives, and the supporting cast are flawless.\n\nSee it or skip it?\n\nSkip it except if you’re a Tabu fan or jonesing for a serious, reality-based movie with no musical numbers. For me, the relentless catalogue of one tragedy after another was too much, and the pace of the film is very slow."
