        "text": "Jyothika says Suriya not allowed. Suriya and Jyotika, the beloved couple of Tamil cinema, made their debut together in the 1999 film \"Poovellam Kettupar.\" Their on-screen chemistry blossomed into a real-life romance, leading to their marriage in 2006. The couple is blessed with two children, Diya and Dev, born in 2007 and 2010 respectively.\n\nTheir collaboration in successful films such as \"Perazhagan,\" \"Maayavi,\" \"Kaakha Kaakha,\" and \"Sillunu Oru Kaadhal\" has endeared them to audiences. Both Suriya and Jyotika are active on social media, often interacting with their fans. A recent incident where Jyotika responded to a fan's request has garnered attention online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen a female fan expressed her desire to spend a day with Suriya, her favorite actor, Jyotika playfully responded, \"Oops, not allowed,\" showcasing her deep affection for her husband.\n\nTheir love story began on the sets of \"Kaakha Kaakha\" in 2001, and after the film's release, rumors of their engagement circulated. Reportedly, Suriya proposed to Jyotika in a private ceremony to have time to convince his parents about their relationship.\n\nOn the professional front, Jyotika is renowned for her roles in films like \"Kushi,\" \"Raatchasi,\" \"36 Vayadhinile,\" and \"Chandramukhi.\" She recently appeared in Ajay Devgn's \"Shaitaan,\" setting a new standard for supernatural thrillers in Hindi cinema. Her upcoming projects include \"The Animators\" and \"Sri.\"\n\nJyotika made a strong comeback with \"36 Vayadhinile\" and has since delivered impactful performances not only in Tamil but also in Malayalam and Hindi cinema. Her Malayalam film \"Kathal Di Kaur\" opposite Mammootty was well-received.\n\nMeanwhile, Suriya made a guest appearance in \"Rocketry: The Nambi Effect\" and is renowned for his roles in films like \"24,\" \"Jai Bhim,\" \"Soorarai Pottru,\" and \"7aum Arivu.\" He has a lineup of exciting projects including \"Karna,\" \"Rolex,\" \"Kanguva,\" \"Irumbu Kai Maayavi,\" and \"Vaadivaasal.\""
