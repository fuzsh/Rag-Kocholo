        "text": "It is a known fact that Jyothika had opted out of Vijay’s untitled next film with Atlee. She was initially supposed to play one of the three lead heroines in the movie.\n\nIt must be noted that Jyothika teamed up with Vijay for the 1st time in Kushi which was a runaway success. She was again supposed to act with Vijay in Friends, but she backed out of the project due to reasons unknown. The combo again came together for Thirumalai which was a path changing film for Vijay after a lean phase.\n\nNow again Jyothika has not taken up a Vijay film. Will history repeat itself? Will they team up for another big hit in the future? Let’s see."
