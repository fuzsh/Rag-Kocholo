        "text": "Jeo Baby’s Kaathal- The Core, which features Mammootty and Jyothika in the main parts, is getting a tonne of positive feedback from the public, including from celebs. The film, which marks Jyothika’s comeback to Malayalam cinema after a long stint of absence, was released on November 24.\n\nThe protagonist of the film is Mathew Devassy, a retired bank manager who decides to contest the local panchayat elections. His life, however, goes for a toss after his wife Omana files for divorce from him, stating that he is homosexual. The dynamics of relationships and love have been explored realistically by Jeo in the film and it has won the hearts of audiences and industry veterans alike.\n\nOne of the many celebs who were left impressed by Kaathal- The Core is lead actress Jyothika’s husband and Tamil star Suriya. Suriya complimented everyone in the film through his social media handle by saying that gems like Kaathal stem out of beautiful minds coming together. He also added a picture of Mammootty and Jyothika from the film.\n\n“What a progressive film. Hats off to this beautiful team! Mammootty sir, for the love for good cinema and inspiration; Jeo Baby, even the silent shots spoke volumes; the writers Adarsh Sukumaran and Paulson Skaria for showing us this world! And my Omana, Jyotika, for winning all hearts and showing what love can be!!! Superlative,” he tweeted.\n\nThe earnest appreciation caught the attention of Mammootty and he penned a thankful note for Suriya through the handle of his production house Mammootty Kampany, saying that the review meant a lot to the team of the film.\n\nOther celebrities who heaped praises on the movie include Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Aishwarya Lekshmi and Siddharth. The movie’s daily box office collections have steadily increased since its premiere. Kaathal- The Core made Rs 1.75 crore on Sunday in the domestic market, beating its prior revenues of Rs 1.6 crore, Rs 1.25 crore, and Rs 1.05 crore on Saturday, Friday and Thursday, respectively, according to industry tracker Sacnilk."
