        "text": "Leading Tamil actor-producer Jyotika has announced that her next big film titled Sri will be coming out on May 10, 2024. Taking to Instagram, the popular Tamil cinema star shared a still from the upcoming film based on the life of visually-impaired industrialist Srikanth Bolla being portrayed by Bollywood actor Rajkummar Rao, and shared the big news. Announcing the release date, Jyotika wrote in the caption of her post, \"Prepare to be inspired by the remarkable journey of Srikanth Bolla #SRI unfolds on 10th May 2024.\" (sic)\n\nSri marks Jyotika's big Bollywood comeback after she made her acting debut in Doli Saja Ke Rakhna (1998). The actress who won the Best Feature Film accolade as a producer along with Suriya, Rajsekar Pandian, and Guneet Monga for Soorarai Pottru (2020) at the 68th National Film Awards, had shifted her attention to films in Tamil and other South Indian languages after her start in Hindi cinema and garnered a huge fan following. Ever since the news of Jyotika returning to Bollywood in Rajkummar Rao's Sri was announced, there has been a considerable amount of excitement to witness her in action on Hindi screens."
