        "text": "Director Radha Mohan and Jyothika have given the Tamil audience a gem of a film like Mozhi. Even after decades, Mozhi feels fresh. The successful duo has joined hands yet again after a decade.\n\nThis time, though, they have chosen to get behind the Tamil remake of Tumhari Sulu, the Hindi original starring Vidya Balan. The Tamil remake, purposefully titled Kaatrin Mozhi (an ode to their successful flick) is a feel-good, slice-of-life story of revolving around a housewife.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWithout making many changes to Suresh Triveni's story, director Radha Mohan has tried to churn out a faithful remake of Tumhari Sulu. But Jyothika's film falls short of being the Hindi flick.\n\nVijayalakshmi Balakrishnan aka Viji is a housewife hailing from a middle-class background. The chirpy woman that she is, she has the urge to prove herself and yearns to do a job that will make her happy. She ends up as an RJ for a late-night talk show at a channel. But her stint does not go down well with her family.\n\nDirector Radha Mohan's effort is extremely sincere and it is visible in every frame. He has paid attention to minute details and has tried his best to recreate the scenes from Tumhari Sulu. In fact, it is safe to say that Kaatrin Mozhi is a frame-to-frame reproduction of Vidya Balan's film.\n\nWhenever a director chooses to do a remake, comparisons are inevitable. And Kaatrin Mozhi is no different. For those who have seen the original Tumhari Sulu, Kaatrin Mozhi could turn out to be a dud as it will seem like you are watching the film for the second time.\n\nIn Tumhari Sulu, Vidya Balan's performance was so casual that it didn't feel like one is watching a film at all. However, in Kaatrin Mozhi, it all looks staged and plastic. But that doesn't mean that the film doesn't entertain the audience.\n\nThe film has multiple sequences that have the classic touches of Radha Mohan. The comedy seems to work in favour of the remake. Be it Jyothika and Vidharth's (Viji's husband Balu) banter or Kumaravel's flawless performance, Kaatrin Mozhi has several scenes that will make you laugh even if you have seen Tumhari Sulu.\n\nJyothika fits her role like a glove as far as looks are concerned, but her animated expressions spoil the flow of the film at times. In several interviews, Jo has claimed that she loves to do comedy films. Here, it looks like she needs to work hard on her comic timing.\n\nIn the scene where she talks to a pigeon named Bhagyalakshmi, her expression should have made the audience smile. Instead, it makes you wonder why she's going over the top.\n\nVidharth as Balu delivers a nuanced performance and one can see the pain that he goes through in his eyes. For example, in the scene where he confesses that he misses his wife due to her new job, his performance is just flawless.\n\nTelugu actress Lakshmi Manchu, who reprises Neha Dhupia's role in the remake, looks caricaturish and is trying hard to be 'too cool'. Supporting actors Kumaravel, Manobala and MS Bhaskar bring a smile to your face whenever they are on screen.\n\nIn a nutshell, Kaatrin Mozhi could have been Tumhari Sulu. But the animated performances from Jyothika and Lakshmi Manchu ruin the experience a little.\n\nKaatrin Mozhi starring Jyothika evokes laughter here and there. However, it falls short of being a faithful remake of Tumhari Sulu, says our review.\n\n2.5 stars out of 5 for Kaatrin Mozhi.\n\nALSO SEE | Vidya Balan wishes Jyotika and Kaatrin Mozhi team in Tamil.
