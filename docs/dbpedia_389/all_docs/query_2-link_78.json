        "text": "It all started when I received a phone call from our Operations Manager, Sandeep. He had a surprise waiting for me. A VIP group had booked a trek with us and I was to lead this group.\n\nEager, I asked Sandeep for more details. He refused to divulge them except for a single clue.\n\nThey are two of South India’s most beloved stars from the film industry.\n\nWith my curiosity thoroughly piqued, my mind raced through the celebrities I knew. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that I would be spending seven beautiful days in the mountains of West Bengal with two of the kindest souls I have met till date.\n\nEnter Jyothika and Suriya.\n\nI was at the airport of Bagdogra waiting for our team to arrive. There were eight members in total.\n\nAlthough Suriya and Jyothika are stars of the Kollywood industry, the barrier of language seems to have hardly kept them from winning the hearts of people up north. My friends, family and neighbors were more than thrilled when I told them about the trek I was embarking on. They simply couldn’t stop gushing about their movies!\n\nBefore I met the team, I knew only two of the eight people in the group. Our stars, Jyothika and Suriya.\n\nPost a quick introductory session however, it became clear to me that each person in the group was someone who excelled in his/her chosen field of interest. We had a renowned film producer, a chief medical airline officer, a national level swimmer and well accomplished doctors.\n\nOur team: (starting left) Indarjith, Tija, Suriya, Jyothika, Spoorthi, Arun, Saranyaa, Rajsekar and Rohit\n\nWe had spared nothing from our end in planning and arrangement. But considering this was the first multi-day trek for everyone in the group, I must confess I had slight apprehensions on how each member would cope with the facilities available in the mountains.\n\nA view of Sandakphu with the Sleeping Buddha in the horizon. PC: Rohit\n\nWe were going on a trek to Sandakphu, the highest point of the Singalila ridge from where one can spot four of the five highest peaks in the world. The trek is also well known for stunning views of the Sleeping Buddha trekkers are treated to through the course of seven days. Starting at Maney Bhanjan, the land of the land rovers, the trail zigzags through India and Nepal for most parts, exposing us to a unique blend of both cultures along the way.\n\nA pic of Saranyaa making her way through Samandhan village, one of the prettiest spots on the trek and a personal favourite of our team. PC: Rohit\n\nA Turning Point:\n\nContrary to the apprehensions I had, all members of our team were not only punctual and disciplined but had an admirable attitude towards trekking.\n\nTrekking in progress PC: Rohit\n\nOn the fifth day of our trek, we had a particularly long hike ahead of us. Our campsite was Moley which was around 16kms from where we were staying. We reached late in the afternoon, around 3.30 pm.\n\nTired and hungry, one of the first things all of us were looking forward to was a delicious, hot lunch of dal, chaawal and rotis. Much to my dismay however, we were greeted by a campsite that had no sign of food anywhere. There had been a miscommunication and our cooks were yet to get started with the lunch preparation.\n\nIn situations like these, fatigue sometimes gets the best of us making us ‘hangry’. Unsure of how this delay was going to be received, I turned to my team to apologize. What followed next marked a turning point in this trek for me personally.\n\nFrom my experience, bad trekkers turn sour when they hear news like this. Good trekkers usually understand that such things happen occasionally while on a trek.\n\nBut there is a third category of trekkers I had not met in a really long time, ever since a service oriented model of trekking got introduced in the industry. These are the best kind, the kind that pitch in and help at the campsites.\n\nAnd Suriya’s response was one that took me by surprise that day. He was not only understanding of the delay but also offered to help with preparing the food. Other members of my team soon pitched in. A little stunned and mostly happy, I not only adored them as individuals from then on but respected them for the kind of trekkers they chose to be. Any trek leader would love to lead a team like them!\n\nAnother picture from the trails.\n\nAGARAM Foundation\n\nThis respect for them only grew further when I learnt about the AGARAM foundation started by Suriya and Jyothika. It works for the welfare of first generation students of families. Schooling, tuition and hostel fees are taken care of by the foundation for these children. It was founded in 2006 and I read that the foundation has also recently committed to renovating and maintaining 400 government schools across Tamil Nadu.\n\nIt was a wonderful initiative and reminded me of a local saying I have heard once. Pardon the very basic translation but this is how the saying goes: “Teaching a student how to fish is a nobler act than feeding him/her fish”.\n\nThe Little Details\n\nI went into the trek expecting to lead a celebrity couple and their friends safely into the mountains and back. I returned however with a family of eight. Looking back now, the details were in the little things.\n\nThey never started dinner without me. Every night we would sit together and whenever I finished the subzi or roti, one of the team members would place some more on my plate unasked, just the way a family would take care of you.\n\nSuriya indulged in open and genuine conversations with me asking me about my partner and sharing endearing stories of Jyothika in turn as casually as a friend would.\n\nJyothika even enquired if I would invite her to my wedding next year to which I jokingly replied that I would have to hire two photographers in that case. I was sure one of them would be more interested in capturing them than me and my partner.\n\nRaja (our top notch film producer) introduced me to his sister back home on phone. This was the first time anyone has done that for me as a trek leader and I was touched by the simple yet profound gesture from his end.\n\nWatching the four couples on the trails, I learnt a lot about friendship, partnership, humility and grace from the way they motivated each other, took care of each other and supported each other through the seven days.\n\nI couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed at the end of it all. In my five years of trekking, Sandakphu is now one of the best treks/experiences of my life. And perhaps, this time it had a little bit more to do with the people I met than the mountains themselves :)"
