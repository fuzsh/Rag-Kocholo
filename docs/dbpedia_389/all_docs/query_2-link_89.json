        "text": "Hi friends ü§©, I want to share my thoughts after watching this wonderful movie. I think more than 15 times I watchedüëÄ this movie.\n\nThe characters in the movie, the way surya sir acted my God its really wow experience. The reel names of surya sir is Gautham, jyothika mam is kundavai, bhoomika mam is aishu. Each one played their role in a wonderful way. In this movie Gautham loves aishu in college days , you knowgautham plays football ‚öΩÔ∏è very well but, one day he got tensed because during football match aishu did not see his playing so what he does is he kicks the football and aishu will get injured. It was a shock for the audience because, aishu will not say anything to her dad and i think that time itself see starts loving Gautham. Initially, Gautham was like a stranger to aishu after sometime by knowing his innocence she expresses her love to gautham by her words. Gautham feels so good by hearing the words said by aishu.\n\nTheir pure love you can be seen in the ‚ÄòMunbe vaa en anbe vaa' song‚ù§\n\nThe song was sang by Sherya goshal you know her voice is as sweet as a sugar.\n\nAll songs in this movie are blockbuster ‚ö°and my fav songs are munbe vaa en vaa, newyork nagaram urangum neram.\n\nThey both decide to register marriageü§µüë∞‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èbut her dad was a minister so he came with his fighters and separates aishu from gauthamüíî and they also beat gautham in that pain he will shout aishu‚Ä¶like that.\n\nAfter few years, gautham gets married to kundavai, they both have a small daughter her name is also aishu. Gautham works as mechanic in a company, kundavai works in a office and they three live a very happy life. Friends you must see this movie it was not like the Characters in that movie playing their role, it was like real surya‚ù§ jyothika pair.\n\nGautham has a habit of writing‚úç diary so, he wrote all this incidents in his diary. One day kundavai read that diary and she cries like something and she questioned herself like why gautham did not say anything about his past love. She asked her little daughter whether your father loves me or not. By the time that little aishu goes to her father and asks him about her moms wish. He suddenly takes another diary and gives to kundavai. After reading that diary kundavai asks sorry to gautham and hugs him. Later, she decides to meet aishu to bring back her and to make her to meet with gautham. Aishu came to see gautham after 6 years , gautham got shocked, he has no words. Kundavai left them both for one day and went to her friends house. Aishu talks to gautham she asks gautham to tell something he says, you are not the aishu i had met in college you changed, by that time she says ‚Äòonly my looks, dress and talks have changed but my heart is as same as before‚Äô- this dialogue stealed my heartü•∞ .\n\nAfter some hours kundavai comes back to her flat and asks gautham where is aishu he shows the place we're aishu wrote a letter for kundavai. In that letter aishu says that, at next birth I want to love gautham again not as aishu as kundavai. After reading this kundavai cries and hugs her husband and gautham says donot leave me alone throughout my life. By that time their daughter arrives and then they sees the crackers bursting in the sky‚ú® with happy face and a little smile.\n\nThe story ends here‚Ä¶.\n\nAll must watchüëÄ this amazing movie, this is one of my all time favorite movieü•∞‚Ä¶\n\nI know you all give your support to good blogs.
