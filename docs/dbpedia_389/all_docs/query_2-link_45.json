        "text": "The makers of Shaitaan have finally dropped the teaser for the supernatural thriller starring R Madhavan, Ajay Devgn and Jyothika.\n\nCheck out the video here:\n\nThe teaser depicts Ajay Devgn and Jyothika looking terrified while a voiceover in the background says, \"They say the world is deaf, and yet they follow every word of mine. I am the darkness, I am the bowl of temptation, sinister prayers...forbidden spells. I rule the nine circles of hell. I am the poison...I am the cure...I am the silent witness to everything that time has endured. I am the night...I am the twilight...I am the universe...I create, I sustain, I destroy, BEWARE. They say, there's no one that I choose to spare...There's a game, Do you want to play? It has only one rule...No matter what I say...You must not be tempted.\" The trailer concludes with R Madhavan's sinister grin.\n\nThe film marks Jyothika's return to Bollywood after 25 years, with her last Hindi film was the 1997 film Doli Saja Ke Rakhna.\n\nShaitaan is produced by Ajay Devgn, Jyoti Deshpande, Kumar Mangat Pathak and Abhishek Pathak and directed by Vikas Bahl. It is set release on March 8, 2024.\n\nSee Also: Ajay Devgn, R Madhavan & Jyothika look intense in newest poster of Shaitaan. Teaser to be out soon"
