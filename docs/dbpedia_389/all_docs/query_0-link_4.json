        "text": "“Unsurprisingly there’s hardly any noise because this isn’t bollywood.” I see even recently, vijay sethupathi’s son getting trolled. He got trolled for some talk in his film pooja. While Tamil nadu doesnt have a cancel culture in this regard, kids of stars would face nepotism criticism these days.\n\nOne film industry which is worst in this regard – telugu film, not sure how the public over there is talking about it.\n\nComing to the movie itself, not sure how 3 came out as well as it did – I had problems with it. But it had portrayed certain sections very well.\n\nI wrote about the general lack of an ‘uncanny’ element in Rahman’s music here while contrasting his approach with Raja’s.\n\nAt his peak, his music dazzled for its sheer mindboggling newness. There had never been any music like his before, esp in film music. But with his time, his music too sort of settled down and to an extent, he outgrew his youthful exuberance. Which made his music more refined but also more ‘pat’.\n\nAnd the film industry is not in a space that favours the old melody heavy type of soundtracks anymore. So he needs to embrace the uncanny to break out of ‘Rahman’ patterns and surprise the audience. Not necessarily in a harmonic way (which wouldn’t work either today) but there are so many levers on which to innovate in music. If you see his recent successes, they were more melody oriented, more ‘traditional’ (if you will) soundtracks, be it Atrangi Re with its sorta Bombay album-vibes, PS being heavily classical or Dil Bechara being in a sort of West End zone, esp Taare Ginn but also Mera Naam Kizzie. Those kind of albums don’t fructify very often anymore, unfortunately.\n\nProbably a controversial rant but there is so much of political noise happening all around. Rajini is trying hard to unite the non-christian voters first it was Jailer where he took potshots on Jagan (‘arthamainda raja). On the flip side, Mammutty and Jeeva made Yatra-2 and Jyothika made a movie on Jagan. Now a communist title to unite hindus and muslims. Definitely the missionaries have strengthened in the South. Probably Rajamouli made RRR as a dog whistle that colonization is making its move again. Chiranjeevi tried with Acharya and failed, Rajini may fail. Alas he has to understand that the core issue that needs to be addressed is the rise of Wahhabism and not the age old tropes of the 80s. Never knew may he it’s just a fight between Russians and the Western powers now. I am jumping from here.\n\nAR Rahman used AI to resurrect the voices of late singers Bamba Bakya and Shahul Hameed for “Thimiri Yezhuda”\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ar-rahman-uses-ai-voice-models-of-late-singers-bamba-bakya-and-shahul-hameed-for-lal-salaam-song/article67792296.ece\n\nWhen I saw the credits for the song on Spotify, I assumed that Bamba Bakya recorded the track before he died, and that some other singer named Shahul Hameed sang on it. But learning that ARR used AI to create a new track using their voices is disconcerting. The song is tastefully done, but it opens up a bunch of ethical quandaries:\n\n-The deceased can neither approve nor disapprove of such use of their voices in this manner. Legally their descendants might be able to give permission, but is it ethical?\n\n-Should we use this tech to deny opportunities to current singers?\n\n-Shouldn’t we accept mortality? Let us appreciate the work an artist created when they were alive.\n\nI could see some instances in which this technology could be used ethically. A singer who is still alive giving permission for specific instances of their voice being used in this manner for, for example.\n\nIt was possible to manipulate sounds and images before AI, but AI takes it to a whole new level.\n\nPrem: That’s a good set of questions which probably hold true for much more than just a person’s voice. Here are some thoughts:\n\n<i>The deceased can neither approve nor disapprove of such use of their voices in this manner. Legally their descendants might be able to give permission, but is it ethical?</i>\n\nThe ethical aspect here might be important in the short term when there are no laws in place and the deceased have had no say in the matter. In the long term, I can see a person’s voice as being termed as their “wealth,” and so the individuals should be able to impose the use restrictions or use charges (and beneficiaries) on their voice through their will. And if they don’t, their “legal heirs” would determine those restrictions or charges.\n\n<i>-Should we use this tech to deny opportunities to current singers?</i>\n\nThis is a small scale version of the larger question of whether tech should replace human jobs. But the answer here wouldn’t be any different from that for using synth-music vs. human instrumentalists. In the end, people hear what they want to hear. The more interesting use cases would be for singers themselves to “extend” their voice beyond its natural capabilities through AI. Then you could end up with many differently abled singers getting newer kinds of opportunities.\n\n<i>Shouldn’t we accept mortality? Let us appreciate the work an artist created when they were alive.</i>\n\nI don’t see why we can’t do both. If a person’s voice outlives them (especially someone like Shahul Hameed who died oh so young), I see this as a way to further celebrate their talent and grow their legacy.\n\nIt’s interesting that the last time Aishwarya Rajnikanth made a movie with Rajnikanth, they tried to resurrect Nagesh.\n\n“wrt AR Rahman, I think he needs the director/ script to push him/ inspire him” - I would agree with the caveat that it’s, again, more that the type of films that allow a composer with a strong stamp AND diverse range to shine through aren’t being made. It’s not like Dil Bechara was an amazing film and while I liked Atrangi Re, it too had its flaws. If I were to compare either to Gargi, I would say Gargi was a far superior film. But there’s nothing to do for a composer in Gargi other than the score itself while Dil Bechara and Atrangi Re have space for songs. And while mass films have song situations, the situations themselves have become hackneyed and one dimensional by and large with a heavy emphasis on loudness. They don’t have the breadth that say a Ejamaan/Veera offered Raja or Baasha/Annamalai to Deva or Muthu or even Padayappa for Rahman. Can you even imagine a classical duel ‘potti paatu’ in a Rajni film today? This scope for songs didn’t necessarily make those films superior (though it seems even Rajni fans do rank Baasha, Annamalai and Padayappa very highly in the canon) but they simply allowed the composer space to exhibit his skills.\n\nThis is also why I pushed back against the whole ‘Mani elevates composers to get their best out’ narrative. That might be true for PS and might have been true up to mid 90s for Mani but not in general anymore and rather than a decline in his abilities, it is simply about the type of films he makes. Even in the 80s, Nayakan didn’t have the same space for songs that the far more commercial Idhayathai Thirudathe had. It is very rare that a Hindi or Tamil film manages to be both sumptuous from a pure script and direction point of view and also has space for songs and would require personal subjects with an emphasis on drama (it cannot be achieved in thrillers or action films). Films like Mausam or Arth for example (or Mani’s own Mouna Raagam or Mahendran’s Nenjathai Killathe). Again, you can’t make those kind of films for a big audience anymore which also means that you don’t particularly need to have songs in them and you wouldn’t if you were up against budget constraints and were looking at an OTT release. Charlie777 and Sita Ramam both managed this balance but those kind of films aren’t made in Tamil anymore."
