        "text": "Who was Maharaja Duleep Singh?\n\nMaharaja Duleep Singh was the last Sikh Maharaja of the Punjab and former owner of the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond, which was surrendered to the British and later added to the Crown Jewels.\n\nFor much of his life, Duleep Singh had a complicated relationship with Queen Victoria – at times affectionate, at others turbulent. On the one hand, the British East India Company had taken possession of his ancestral lands, and on the other she was godmother to several of his children.\n\nExiled from India as a child, Duleep Singh lived much of his life in England and France, although he fought hard to reclaim his territory and title from the British.\n\nHeader image: The Maharaja Duleep Singh by Franz Xaver Winterhalter. Royal Collection Trust / © His Majesty King Charles III 2023\n\nDuleep Singh, The 5-year-old Maharaja\n\nMaharaja Duleep Singh was born in Lahore, in modern-day Pakistan, on 6 September 1838, to Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839) and Rani Jindan Kaur (1817–1863).\n\nKnown as the 'Lion of Punjab', his father Ranjit Singh was the first Sikh Maharaja of the Punjab and Sikh Empire, in modern-day eastern Pakistan and north-western India.\n\nAfter his father’s death, a series of successors were killed. Finally, Duleep Singh was declared Maharaja at just 5 years old.\n\nThe Punjab Surrendered\n\nThe British, through their agents in the East India Company, were quick to exploit the unstable situation in the Punjab. After two Anglo-Sikh wars, the Company took control of the region. The Maharaja, still only 10 years old, was forced to surrender his lands and the prized Koh-i-Noor diamond.\n\nIn return, he was granted a pension, provided he 'remain obedient to the British Government'.\n\nThe Maharaja of the Punjab Meets the Empress of India\n\nDuleep Singh first met Queen Victoria in 1854. He greatly impressed the Queen who described him in her journal as ‘extremely handsome, speaks English perfectly, and has a pretty, graceful and dignified manner’.\n\nRather ironically, she added: ‘I always feel so much for these poor deposed Indian Princes.’\n\nVictoria took a close interest in his education, although he was denied a request to go to university.\n\nDuleep Singh often visited the Royal Family at Windsor and Osborne. As a new member of the English aristocracy, he attended dinners, shooting parties and balls.\n\nBut he longed to return to India and to see his mother.\n\nA Mother and Son Reunited\n\nIn 1861, after 12 years apart, Duleep Singh and his mother, Maharani Jind Kaur reunited in a grand hotel in Calcutta (now Kolkata), with British government representatives in attendance. The British government had consented to the idea, believing that the aged Maharani no longer posed a threat. The pair travelled to England and became inseparable.\n\nThe Maharani encouraged Duleep Singh to enquire about his private lands in the Punjab. Perhaps to placate the young Maharaja, the British increased his pension and gave him a large grant towards the purchase of a castle in Gloucestershire.\n\nThe Maharani died suddenly in 1863. Inconsolable, her son took her body to India for cremation.\n\nMarriage to Bamba Müller and Life at Elveden\n\nTravelling back to India via Egypt, Duleep Singh met Bamba Müller who worked at a local mission school. The couple married in 1864 and were welcomed back to Britain by Queen Victoria.\n\nThe couple moved to Elveden in Suffolk. The Maharaja loved his new estate and he remodelled the interior to make it look like the Indian palaces of his childhood.\n\nElvedon became famed for shooting game, his favourite pastime. However, his extravagant lifestyle caused frequent disputes with British authorities.\n\nThe Children of the Last Maharaja\n\nFive of Bamba and Duleep Singh’s seven children survived infancy; each had their own relationship with life in Britain and their heritage as children to the Maharaja and Maharani of the Punjab.\n\nThe couple’s second son, Prince Victor, often used the title Shahzadah, meaning ‘son of a Shah’. Their third son, Prince Frederick, served in the British army until 1919.\n\nThree daughters were to follow. Princess Catherine and Princess Sophia were both prominent and passionate campaigners for women's suffrage. During the First World War, Sophia fundraised and even nursed the thousands of Indian soldiers who fought for the Allies.\n\nAlong with their sister Bamba, Catherine and Sophia travelled to India in 1907 and 1924. Bamba died in Lahore aged 89.\n\nQueen Victoria was godmother to Prince Victor and Princesses Catherine and Sophia.\n\nSophia Duleep Singh: The Indian princess who fought for women’s rights >\n\nThe Death of Duleep Singh, the Last Maharaja\n\nIn 1890 Duleep Singh suffered a stroke. Infirm and without friends or money, he became reconciled with Queen Victoria. The Queen granted him a royal pardon, to the dismay of her ministers.\n\nThe Maharaja died in Paris on 22 October 1893. His children had him buried next to Bamba at Elveden. Representatives of Queen Victoria were among the mourners at his funeral.\n\nPerhaps from the perspective of some British officials, a turbulent chapter in the history of the British Empire seemed to close with the death of Duleep Singh, the last Maharaja of the annexed Punjab who never gave up fighting to reclaim his ancestral lands."
