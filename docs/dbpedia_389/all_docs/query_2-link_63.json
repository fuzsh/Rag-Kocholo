        "text": "Tell us about your family?\n\nThere are two sisters and a brother in the family. My elder sister is the well known actress Nagma . Younger sister is doing her higher studies abroad and brother goes to school.\n\nThe latest songs you would love to listen and sing?\n\nI am an ardent of A.R Rahman. I listen to all the songs in film \"Alaipayuthey\" and am particularly fond of from \"Kandukondain Kandukonain\". At present I listen to the songs of \"Kushi\".\n\nDo you watch movies?\n\nI love to watch movies in the theatre among the audiences. Particularly, if it is my movie. Oh! one cannot explain the happiness felt when the audiences give applause for good performances. According to me, cinema's are to be watched only in the theatres.\n\nYour latest disappointment?\n\nLosing weight to achieve stardom in the movies.\n\nYour source of inspiration?\n\nKajol in Hindi and Sridevi in Tamil film industry. Apart from them my major source of inspiration has been my mother, who is a constant moral support and has been responsible for the development of self confidence in me.\n\nYour belief?\n\nI believe in God and myself. Apart from self respect and self confidence of a person, I believe that hardwork pays results.\n\nYour dream?\n\nI must make my sister feel proud to proclaim that she is my sister.\n\nDo you attend parties frequently?\n\nI am not a party girl and I don't like going to parties.\n\nYour desire?\n\nMy desire is to succeed in all aspects in my life\n\nYour friends?\n\nI have two friends residing in Bombay. We are quite frank with each other. I share almost all the incidences of my life with them. My sister Nagma is also a good friend and she has been my guide in my life.\n\nPeople you dislike?\n\nI have not met people whom I dislike. I might give you a list of people after I complete few years in this industry.\n\nHad the hindi movie \"Doli Sajake Rakhne\" under Priyadarshan's direction been a hit, would you have come to Tamil industry?\n\nVery true, the failure of the movie made me enter the Tamil Industry. But I am happy to work here as people value time and other artists do not have head weight. In my opinion, these aspects are very important in one's life. I thank the lord for me enter the Tamil movie industry. Hindi film takes more time in making .Moreover, even in the shooting spot there is a friendly intimacy here which is a big plus point.\n\nDo you have any plans of shifting to Hindi industry?\n\nAt present I am concentrating on Tamil. Lets see about the Hindi films later. My first director Priyadarshan has been a teacher for me and was responsible for the boost in self confidence. My first camera experience also was in that movie which was like a dream. I could not dream about entering cinema industry before that. It was my dream project. After that I had a chance to act in vasanth sirs movie 'Poovellam kettupaar'. It was a very different experience and it was the first time I acted in an unknown language. But I realized that it is very difficult to earn a name here. It is possible only when there is 100% dedication. Vasanth sir is also good mentor without whose help I wouldn't have out my best.\n\nTell us about the directors you have worked with in Tamil?\n\nVasanth is a perfect guideline. He gives the dialogue sheet one minute in advance to memorize. Director Durai of mugavari movie had done my characterization well. I have a special attachment with 'Vaali' movie as Director Surya was the first south Indian director to approach me. I was supposed to act in the lead role in the movie but as I was committed to the hindi movie I could act only in the 'sona' song.\n\nTell us about the Heroes with whom you have worked with?\n\nIf I have to tell about the heroes with whom i have acted, there certainly is a generation gap. Ajith, Vijay, Surya are of helping nature. There is a family atmosphere here which I like very much.\n\nYour activities during shooting and not during shooting?\n\nI watch the activities in the unit while in shooting. I try to communicate in Tamil with them. At home I love listening to music and reading books.\n\nHas there been a change in your lifestyle after your entry in the film industry?\n\nGenerally I like simplicity. but there has been a change after my entry in the film industry. I have gained some importance. Apart from that there has been no change. I have become a bit matured while in shooting. Previously I used to behave childish.\n\nYour first purchase?\n\nCar. I am very happy to have it at this young age.\n\nIs there any secret aim?\n\nIt is not only an aim but also a dream to own a house near the beach and do painting on the balcony during the early hours of the day while having a coffee. If this becomes true all my dreams would be fulfilled.\n\nHow long will u continue as an actress?\n\nI will continue to be an actress as long as people cherish me. I don't think there is any point in acting for 8 to 9 years for the sake of earning money. Even now I am very selective about my movies. by the years if the audience get bored of me or if I feel that I have acted enough I will quit acting before people reject me.\n\nYour experience in 'Thenaali' ?\n\nI have a lot to learn from kamal regarding acting. I am very proud to act with him during the initial stages of the career. I am very much thrilled about acting with him. It was totally an unexpected offer.\n\nDo you like the life in Tamil Nadu?\n\nIt is very peaceful. The life in Bombay was monotonous and very fast. I have been in Chennai since 8 months and planning to stay for another 2 to 3 years.\n\nYour plans for the future?\n\nAt present I am concentrating in my film career and planning to continue for 4 to 5 years."
