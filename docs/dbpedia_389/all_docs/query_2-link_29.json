        "text": "Actress Jyothika is a well-known South actress. Since her comeback in 2015 with the film 36 Vayadhinile, Jyothika has been determined to avoid being typecast. She is steering clear of the pitfalls that marked her early career. Opting for a quality-over-quantity approach, she has embraced diverse roles. Jyothika has been consistently pushing boundaries, even if it meant taking on just one or two projects annually. Recently, Jyothika was seen giving an interview to Film Companion, where she discussed her role in her Tamil debut film Vaali. During the conversation, she was questioned about opting for a minor role in her first Tamil film, after starring as the lead in her debut Hindi film.\n\nJyothika explained that Vaali was initially meant to be her debut in the film world, and she was supposed to play the female lead in it, opposite superstar Ajith Kumar. Due to scheduling conflicts with a Hindi film, she had to withdraw from Vaali. Director SJ Surya later approached her for a smaller role in Vaali, and she accepted it. Jyothika acknowledged that it was her mistake to have left the film and expressed that she should have done the role.\n\nJyothika expressed that, among the South Indian superstars she has worked with, Mammootty stands out as a “real hero.” Recalling an initial conversation, she shared Mammootty’s perspective on heroism, where he emphasised that being a hero involves exploring diverse roles and fully immersing oneself in portraying various characters. In their film Kaathal – The Core, Mammootty portrayed Mathew Devassy, a homosexual man navigating his journey towards self-acceptance.\n\nJyothika entered the acting scene with the 1997 Hindi film Doli Saja Ke Rakhna, directed by Priyadarshan. Although the film didn’t leave a significant mark, Jyothika’s performance was well-received by the audience. Then, she ventured into Tamil cinema with her debut in Vaali in 1999, earning her the Best Female Debut Award for her noteworthy performance.\n\nOver the course of her illustrious 25-year career, Jyothika has been part of major successes such as Kushi, Tagore, Dumm Dumm Dumm, Chandramukhi, and Mozhi. With a substantial fan base, she has collaborated with industry giants including Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth and Suriya, solidifying her status as a prominent figure in the South Indian film industry."
