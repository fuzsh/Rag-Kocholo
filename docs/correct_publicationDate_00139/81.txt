Asimov, Janet

Entry updated 12 September 2022. Tagged: Author.

(1926-2019) US psychoanalyst and author, married to Isaac Asimov from 1973 until his death in 1992; she signed her early books J O Jeppson. Most of her sf is written for children, though her first venture, The Second Experiment (1974) as Jeppson, is an expansive tale whose main protagonist – a Robot – traces and deeply impacts upon the long story of the race that created him (see Cosmology). Later books as Jeppson included The Last Immortal (1980) and The Mysterious Cure, and Other Stories of Pshrinks Anonymous (coll 1985), the latter comprising comical tales of psychiatry. As Janet Asimov, and in collaboration with Isaac Asimov, she wrote the Norby Chronicles, a sequence of tales for younger readers about a Robot and the scrapes it gets into beginning with Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot (1983) and ending with Norby and the Court Jester (1991); a final volume, Norby and the Terrified Taxi (1997) was by Janet Asimov alone. Of greater general interest is her third solo novel, Mind Transfer (1988) as Janet Jeppson Asimov, which carries over her interest in robots into an adult tale involving the proposal to gift them with brain structures so sophisticated that human minds can be transferred into the matrix provided (see Upload). Sex, Aliens and interstellar travel supervene, and the nature of human Identity is explored with some panache.

Her partnership with Isaac Asimov was close and continuous, as witness the co-authored Norby Chronicles and other work; the most moving manifestation of this may be It's Been a Good Life: Isaac Asimov (coll 2002), a selection of his letters which she edited. [JC]
