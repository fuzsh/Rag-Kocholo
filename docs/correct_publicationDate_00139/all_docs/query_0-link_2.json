        "text": "October 12, 2019\n\nIt would be hard to argue that the Norby books got better as they went along. By this installment, book 10 in the sequence, the characters and story ideas recycle quite a bit, and there is only so much comedic mileage the authors can wring out of the idea of a mixed-up robot.\n\nThe story has Norby, Jeff, and Admiral Yobo, returning to Izz for a reunion with their friends, only to find trouble. Princess Rinda is quarantined with a disease called Ickyspot, Pera the robot has disappeared, and the Mainbrain computer that runs everything is behaving erratically. Meanwhile, the population has become addicted to Tennytrip, a video game developed by Ing (the villain from the first book, but now the court jester in the court of Queen Tizzle). Norby and Jeff must investigate, and their involves a toy and game fair, a singing competition, the discovery of a second Mainbrain, and interactions with the native species of the planet, the Jylots.\n\nIt's all fine, but uninspired. I keep thinking that perhaps this series would have inspired and entertained me when I was a young child, but it doesn't have the multiple layers necessary to keep my attention as an adult.\n\nNovember 14, 2010\n\nThis is probably my favorite of the Norby books so far. Norby, Jeff and Yobo decide to return to the planet Izz for a little vacation. They discover that Ing has become the Court Jester and that there is a plot to take over the Izzian government. They have to figure out if Ing is behind it, and save Izz from being overthrown.\n\nWhile this was still a simple story, and had the same light fun that the others have, there was actually a little bit more depth to the plot. It was fun trying to figure out who the villain was and how they were masterminding the takeover.\n\nThis was definitely a good addition to the Norby saga."
