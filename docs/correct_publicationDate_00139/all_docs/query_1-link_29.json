        "text": "Isaac Asimov (1920 – 1992) was a highly prolific Russian-born American author and professor of biochemistry and is considered to be one of the three grand masters of science fiction together with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, he has won both the Hugo and Nebula award several times . His most famous work is the Foundation series, an epic science fiction story spanning 500 years consisting of seven volumes.\n\nIsaac Asimov was born in Petrovichi, Russia (the exact date of birth is an uncertainty due to the differences in the Gregorian and Hebrew calendars as well as a lack of records), as the son of Judah Asimov and Anna Rachel Berman Asimov, a Jewish family of millers. Isaac Asimov never learned to speak Russian or learn his parent’s native culture since his family moved to the United States when he was three years old and would only speak to him in English and Yiddish. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York and had taught himself to read by the age of five. He was educated at several public schools in New York and studied chemistry at Columbia University where he graduated in 1939 and received his M.A. in 1941.\n\nAsimov married Gertrude Blugerman on July 26, 1942. They had two children, David and Robyn Joan. He got divorced in 1973, and married Janet O. Jeppson later that year. In 1977 Asimov had a heart attack and in 1983 he had triple bypass surgery. During the winter of 1989-90 Asimov spent his time in a hospital due to a congenital weakness of the mitral valve in the heart, eventually his heart and kidney failure worsened and he died at New York University Hospital on April 6, 1992. It was later revealed that he had died from the AIDS virus due to a blood transfusion that he had received as part of the coronary-artery bypass operation in December 1983.\n\nAsimov’s career can be divided into several time periods. His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of The Naked Sun. He began publishing nonfiction in 1952, co-authoring a college-level textbook called Biochemistry and Human Metabolism. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite Sputnik I by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly popular science books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he would write only four science fiction novels. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of Foundation’s Edge. From then until his death, Asimov would publish several sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated.\n\nIn his own view, Asimov believed that his most enduring contributions would be his “Three Laws of Robotics” and the Foundation Series (see Yours, Isaac Asimov, p. 329). Furthermore, the Oxford English Dictionary credits his science fiction for introducing the words positronic (an entirely fictional technology), psychohistory (frequently used in a different sense than the imaginary one Asimov employed) and robotics into the English language. Asimov coined the term robotics without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of mechanics, hydraulics and so forth. (The original word robot derives from the Czech word for “forced labor”, robota, and was first employed by the playwright Karel Capek.) Unlike his other two coinages, the word robotics continues in mainstream and technical use with Asimov’s original definition. Star Trek: The Next Generation featured androids with “positronic brains”, giving Asimov full credit for inventing this (fictional) technology.\n\nAsimov began contributing stories to science fiction magazines in 1939, “Marooned Off Vesta” being his first published story, written when he was 18. Two and a half years later, he published his 32nd short story, “Nightfall” (1941), which has been described as one of “the most famous science-fiction stories of all time”. In 1968 the Science Fiction Writers of America voted “Nightfall” the best science fiction short story ever written. In his short anthology Nightfall and Other Stories he wrote, “The writing of ‘Nightfall’ was a watershed in my professional career… I was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction became aware that I existed. As the years passed, in fact, it became evident that I had written a ‘classic'”.\n\n“Nightfall” is an archetypal example of social science fiction, a term coined by Asimov to describe a new trend in the 1940’s, led by authors including Asimov and Heinlein, away from gadgets and space opera and toward speculation about the human condition.\n\nIn 1942 he began his Foundation stories-later collected in the : Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952), and Second Foundation (1953)- which recount the collapse and rebirth of a vast interstellar empire in a universe of the future. Taken together, they are his most famous work of science fiction, along with the Robot Series. Many years later, he continued the series with Foundation’s Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986) and then went back to before the original trilogy with Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1992). The series features his fictional science of Psychohistory in which the future course of the history of large populations can be predicted.\n\nHis robot stories-many of which were collected in I, Robot (1950)-were begun at about the same time. They promulgated a set of rules of ethics for robots and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject. One such short story, “The Bicentennial Man”, was made into a movie starring Robin Williams.\n\nThe 3 Laws of Robotics:\n\nA robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n\nA robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nQuotes of Asimov:\n\nHumanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition.\n\nI do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.\n\nI don’t believe in an afterlife, so I don’t have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse.\n\nI don’t believe in personal immortality; the only way I expect to have some version of such a thing is through my books.\n\nLife is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It’s the transition that’s troublesome.\n\nNever let your sense of morals get in the way of doing what’s right.\n\nNothing interferes with my concentration. You could put on an orgy in my office and I wouldn’t look up. Well, maybe once.\n\nSelf-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.\n\nTo surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today.\n\nBibliography:\n\nSelected bibliography / novels, poetry, and short stories:\n\nNightfall, 1941 – Yö saapuu (uusi versio yhteistyössä Robert Silverbergin kanssa, suom.
