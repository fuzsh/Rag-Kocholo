Author of \"Science\" column in Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, 1958-92. Contributor of stories to numerous science-fiction anthologies, and to many science-fiction magazines, including Astounding Science Fiction, Amazing Stories, Fantastic Adventures, Science Fiction, and Future Fiction; contributor of short story under pseudonym George E. Dale to Astounding Science Fiction. Contributor of articles to science journals and periodicals. Editorial director, Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine.\n\nADAPTATIONS: A sound recording of William Shatner reading the first eight chapters of Foundation was produced as Foundation: The Psychohistorians, Caedmon, 1976, and of Asimov reading from the same novel was produced as The Mayors, Caedmon, 1977; the film The Ugly Little Boy was adapted from Asimov's short story of the same title, Learning Corporation of America, 1977.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: Isaac Asimov was \"the world's most prolific science writer,\" according to David N. Samuelson in Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers, and he \"has written some of the best-known science fiction ever published.\" Considered one of the three greatest writers of science fiction in the 1940s—along with Robert Heinlein and A. E. van Vogt—Asimov remained throughout his life a potent force in the genre. Stories such as \"Nightfall\" and \"The Bicentennial Man,\" and novels such as The Gods Themselves and Foundation's Edge have received numerous honors and are recognized as among the best science fiction ever written. As one of the world's leading writers on science, explaining everything from nuclear fusion to the theory of numbers, Asimov illuminated for many the mysteries of science and technology. He was a skilled raconteur as well, who enlivened his writing with incidents from his own life. \"In his autobiographical writings and comments,\" stated James Gunn in Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction, \"Asimov continually invites the reader to share his triumphs, to laugh at his blunders and lack of sophistication, and to wonder, with him, at the rise to prominence of a bright Jewish boy brought to this country from Russia at the age of three and raised in a collection of Brooklyn candy stores.\"\n\nAsimov's interest in science fiction began when he first noticed several of the early science-fiction magazines for sale on the newsstand of his family's candy store. Although as a boy he read and enjoyed numerous volumes of nonfiction as well as many of the literary \"classics,\" Asimov recalled in his first autobiography, In Memory Yet Green, that he still longed to explore the intriguing magazines with their glossy covers. But his father refused, maintaining that fiction magazines are \"junk! . . . Not fit to read. The only people who read magazines like that are bums.\" And bums represented \"the dregs of society, apprentice gangsters.\"\n\nIn August of 1929, a new magazine appeared on the scene called Science Wonder Stories. Asimov knew that as long as science-fiction magazines had titles like Amazing Stories, he would have little chance of convincing his father of their worth. However, the new periodical had the word \"science\" in its title, and he said, \"I had read enough about science to know that it was a mentally nourishing and spiritually wholesome study. What's more, I knew that my father thought so from our occasional talks about my schoolwork.\" When confronted with this argument, the elder Asimov consented. Soon Isaac began collecting even those periodicals that didn't have \"science\" in the title. He noted: \"I planned to maintain with all the strength at my disposal the legal position that permission for one such magazine implied permission for all the others, regardless of title. No fight was needed, however; my harassed father conceded everything.\" Asimov rapidly developed into an avid fan.\n\nAsimov first tried writing stories when he was eleven years old. He had for some time been reading stories and then retelling them to his schoolmates, and had also started a book like some of the popular boys' series volumes of the 1920s: \"The Rover Boys,\" \"The Bobbsey Twins,\" and \"Pee Wee Wilson.\" Asimov's story was called \"The Greenville Chums at College,\" patterned after The Darewell Chums at College, and it grew to eight chapters before he abandoned it. Asimov, in In Memory Yet Green, described the flaw in his initial literary venture: \"I was trying to imitate the series books without knowing anything but what I read there. Their characters were small-town boys, so mine were, for I imagined Greenville to be a town in upstate New York. Their characters went to college, so mine did. Unfortunately, a junior high school youngster living in a shabby neighborhood in Brooklyn knows very little about small-town life and even less about college. Even I, myself, was forced eventually to recognize the fact that I didn't know what I was talking about.\"\n\nDespite initial discouragements, Asimov continued to write. His first published piece appeared in his high school's literary semiannual and was accepted, he once admitted, because it was the only funny piece anyone wrote, and the editors needed something funny. In the summer of 1934 Asimov had a letter published in Astounding Stories in which he commented on several stories that had appeared in the magazine. His continuing activities as a fan prompted him to attempt a science fiction piece of his own; in 1937, at the age of seventeen, he began a story titled \"Cosmic Corkscrew.\" The procedure Asimov used to formulate the plot was, he later said, \"typical of my science fiction. I usually thought of some scientific gimmick and built a story about that.\"\n\nBy the time he finished the story on June 19, 1938, Astounding Stories had become Astounding Science Fiction. Its editor was John W. Campbell, who was to influence the work of some of the most prominent authors of modern science fiction, including Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Poul Anderson, L. Sprague de Camp, and Theodore Sturgeon. Since Campbell was also one of the best-known science fiction writers of the thirties and Astounding one of the most prestigious publications in its field at the time, Asimov was shocked by his father's suggestion that he submit \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" to the editor in person: mailing the story would cost twelve cents while subway fare, round trip, was only ten cents. In the interest of economy, therefore, Asimov agreed to make the trip to the magazine's office, fully expecting to leave the manuscript with a secretary.\n\nIt was Campbell's habit to invite many young writers to discuss their work with him, and when Asimov arrived he was shown into the editor's office. Campbell talked with him for over an hour and agreed to read the story; two days later Asimov received the manuscript back in the mail. It had been rejected, but Campbell offered extensive suggestions for improvement and encouraged the young man to keep trying. This began a pattern that was to continue for several years, with Campbell guiding Asimov through his formative beginnings as a science-fiction writer.\n\nAsimov's association with the field of science fiction was a long and distinguished one. He has been credited with the introduction of several innovative concepts into the genre, including the formulation of the \"Three Laws of Robotics.\" Asimov maintained that the idea for the laws was given to him by Campbell; Campbell, on the other hand, said that he had merely picked them out of Asimov's early robot stories. In any case, it was Asimov who first formally stated the three laws: \"1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.\" Asimov said that he used these precepts as the basis for \"over two dozen short stories and three novels . . . about robots,\" and he felt that he was \"probably more famous for them than for anything else I have written, and they are quoted even outside the science-fiction world. The very word 'robotics' was coined by me.\" The three laws gained general acceptance among readers and among other science-fiction writers; Asimov, in his autobiography, wrote that they \"revolutionized\" science fiction and that \"no writer could write a stupid robot story if he used the Three Laws. The story might be bad on other counts, but it wouldn't be stupid.\" The laws became so popular, and seemed so logical, that many people believed real robots would eventually be designed according to Asimov's basic principles.\n\nAlso notable among Asimov's science-fiction works is the \"Foundation\" series. This group of short stories, published in magazines in the 1940s and then collected into a trilogy in the early 1950s, was inspired by Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. It was written as a \"future history,\" a story being told in a society of the distant future which relates events of that society's history. The concept was not invented by Asimov, but there can be little doubt that he became a master of the technique. Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation have achieved special standing among science-fiction enthusiasts. In 1966 the World Science Fiction Convention honored them with a special Hugo Award as the best all-time science-fiction series. Decades after its original publication Asimov's future-history series remained popular, and in the 1980s Asimov added a new volume, Foundation's Edge, and eventually linked the \"Foundation\" stories with his robot novels in The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire, Foundation and Earth, and Prelude to Foundation.\n\nAsimov's first stories written specifically for a younger audience were his \"Lucky Starr\" novels. In 1951, at the suggestion of his Doubleday editor, he began working on a series of science-fiction stories that could easily be adapted for television. \"Television was here; that was clear,\" he wrote in In Memory Yet Green. \"Why not take advantage of it, then? Radio had its successful long-running series, 'The Lone Ranger,' so why not a 'Space Ranger' modeled very closely upon that?\" David Starr: Space Ranger, published under the pseudonym Paul French, introduced David 'Lucky' Starr, agent of the interplanetary law enforcement agency the Council of Science. Accompanying Lucky on his adventures is sidekick John Bigman Jones, a short, tough man born and raised on the great agricultural farms of Mars. Together the two of them confront and outwit space pirates, poisoners, mad scientists, and interstellar spies—humans from the Sirian star system, who have become the Earth's worst enemies.\n\nAlthough the \"Lucky Starr\" series ran to six volumes, the television deal Asimov and his editor envisioned never materialized. \"None of us dreamed that for some reason . . . television series would very rarely last more than two or three years,\" Asimov wrote. \"We also didn't know that a juvenile television series to be called Rocky Jones: Space Ranger was already in the works.\" Another problem the series faced was in the scientific background of the stories. \"Unfortunately,\" stated Jean Fiedler and Jim Mele in Isaac Asimov, \"Asimov had the bad luck to be writing these stories on the threshold of an unprecedented exploration of our solar system's planets, an exploration which has immensely increased our astronomical knowledge. Many of his scientific premises, sound in 1952, were later found to be inaccurate.\" In subsequent editions of the books Asimov included forewords explaining the situation to new readers.\n\nAsimov's first nonfiction book—the beginning of what would number several hundred works for adults and younger readers—was a medical text titled Biochemistry and Human Metabolism, begun in 1950 and written in collaboration with William Boyd and Burnham Walker, two of his colleagues at the Boston University School of Medicine. He had recognized his ability as an explainer early in life, and he enjoyed clarifying scientific principles for his family and friends. He also discovered that he was a most able and entertaining lecturer who delighted in his work as a teacher. He once told New York Times interviewer Israel Shenker that his talent lay in the fact that he could \"read a dozen dull books and make one interesting book out of them.\" The result was that Asimov was phenomenally successful as a writer of science books for the general public. Asimov later added: \"I'm on fire to explain, and happiest when it's something reasonably intricate which I can make clear step by step. It's the easiest way I can clarify things in my own mind.\"\n\nToward the end of his career particularly, Asimov was concerned with a variety of subjects that went far beyond the scientific, and wrote on such diverse topics as the Bible, mythology, William Shakespeare, ecology, and American history. Asimov additionally wrote several volumes of autobiography, beginning with In Memory Yet Green in 1979 and culminating in I. Asimov: A Memoir, a 1994 work composed of 166 short chapters that discuss key elements which shaped the author's life. Michael Swanwick characterized the work as \"quintessential Asimov,\" and Michael White commented that Asimov \"was our era's great artist of explanation, a master of the declarative sentence and the lockstep paragraph, and both his fiction and his nonfiction conspire to convince you that the world makes more sense than you thought it did.\" In 1995 Stanley Asimov presented a significant contribution to the literary biography of his brother by publishing Yours, Isaac Asimov: A Lifetime of Letters. Organized thematically, the volume presents excerpts from thousands of letters and notes written by Isaac Asimov over the course of his life.\n\nThe years immediately preceding and following the author's death witnessed the publication of anthologies and collections of Asimov's fictional and prose writings. In 1990, for example, a collection titled RobotVisions appeared, encompassing all of Asimov's short stories and essays concerning robots. In 1995 the posthumous collection Magic: The Final Fantasy Collection was published, collecting numerous pieces for the first time. Many of the short stories in the anthology feature the comic adventures of George and the feckless supernatural being Azazel; and the volume additionally contains Asimov's critical writings on such noted fantasy writers as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, and L. Sprague de Camp.\n\nWhen Asimov died in 1992 he received numerous tributes highlighting the breadth of his curiosity and acknowledging his profound impact in enlarging the possibilities of the science fiction genre. Over the following decade, Asimov's second wife, Janet Jeppson Asimov, condensed her husband's autobiographies—numbering some 2,000 pages—into a single 300-page volume titled It's Been a Good Life, which was published in 2002. Arranged topically rather than chronologically, the work is divided into chapters that treat such topics as education, war, religion, family, writing, sexism, and his own illnesses. In addition to Asimov's words, Jepson Asimov includes excerpts from her correspondence with her husband, an account of his final days alive, and an epilogue in which she explains that he had contracted the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion during an 1983 triple-bypass operation, a fact he kept secret. Among the work's enthusiasts was Booklist's Roland Green, who dubbed it a \"good introduction\" to Asimov's career, and a Publishers Weekly reviewer, who predicted that this \"readable and idiosyncratic self-portrait\" would likely attract new readers to Asimov's works.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nAsimov, Isaac, The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories, Doubleday (New York, NY), 1976.\n\nAsimov, Isaac, In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920-1954, Doubleday (New York, NY), 1979.\n\nAsimov, Isaac, In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954-1979, Doubleday (New York, NY), 1980.\n\nBoerst, William J., Isaac Asimov: Writer of the Future, Morgan Reynolds, 1998.\n\nChildren's Literature Review, Volume 12, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1987.\n\nClareson, Thomas D., editor, Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science-Fiction Writers, Popular Press, 1976.\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Gale (Detroit, MI), Volume 1, 1973, Volume 3, 1975, Volume 9, 1978, Volume 19, 1981, Volume 26, 1983.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science-Fiction Writers, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1981.\n\nFiedler, Jean, and Jim Mele, Isaac Asimov, Ungar, 1982.\n\nGreenberg, Martin H., and Joseph D.
