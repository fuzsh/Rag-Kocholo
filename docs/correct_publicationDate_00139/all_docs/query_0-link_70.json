        "text": "Robots and the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been the subject of science fiction for decades. With the increasing role of AI in society, some are predicting that AI will make humanity obsolete, if not extinct. Isaac Asimov’s collection of short stories, I, Robot examines one scenario for the evolution of AI and its relationship to humanity. This paper examines various themes raised in I, Robot by reading it in conversation with the Primeval history of Genesis 1–11, in particular chapters 1–4. The themes examined include myth building, the imago Dei, the Fall, and the direction of history. A comparative reading of the two texts demonstrates how the development of AI will not threaten humanity’s status as imago Dei. It does however challenge humanity not to capitulate to the narrative of the inevitable rise of AI to replace much of our role in carrying out the cultural mandate. Instead, as God’s agents in the world, we are called to participate in the bringing of order of out chaos, instead of capitulating to our own creations.\n\nIn science-fiction literature and film, human beings simultaneously feel fear and allure in the presence of intelligent ma- chines, an experience that approximates the numinous experience as described in 1917 by Rudolph Otto. Otto believed that two chief elements characterize the numinous experience: the mysterium tremen- dum and the fascinans. Briefly, the mysterium tremendum is the fear of God’s wholly other nature and the fascinans is the allure of God’s saving grace. Science-fiction representations of robots and artificially intelligent computers follow this logic of threatening otherness and soteriological promise. Science fiction offers empirical support for Anne Foerst’s claim that human beings experience fear and fascina- tion in the presence of advanced robots from the Massachusetts In- stitute of Technology AI Lab. The human reaction to intelligent machines shows that human beings in many respects have elevated those machines to divine status. This machine apotheosis, an inter- esting cultural event for the history of religions, may—despite Foerst’s rosy interpretation—threaten traditional Christian theologies.\n\nThis anticipatory analysis of the robot in contemporary culture poses the question concerning technology as a primarily cultural and ethical question. In a reading of Carlos Collodi’s The Adventures of Pinocchio (1983), Isaac Asimov’s I, Robot (1950), Riddly Scott’s Blade Runner (1982), Chris Cunningham’s All is Full of Love (1999), and Alex Proyas’ film I, Robot (2004), I will frame the robot as an intermedial key figure that signifies the “divorce” of technics and culture as theorized in the works of Bernard Stiegler, most notably Technics and Time: the Fault of Epimetheus (1994). This reading of the robot as a cultural and technical object is based on Heidegger’s and Stiegler’s revision of the Aristotelian division between natural and technical beings. In The Question Concerning Technology (1962), Heidegger traces our conception of instrumentality back to Aristotle’s four causes, and calls into question the primacy that is given to the efficient cause – the cause that brings about the effect, in the case of the technical object usually understood as the manufacturer – throughout the history of philosophy. In Technics and Time, Stiegler takes this argument a step further, and theorizes the technical object as having a distinct dynamics and evolution of its own. This analysis aims to raise the question of how, in an age of constant innovation, the future is being transmitted to us by the technical object, and through the medium.\n\nSlaves and robots have in common that they are intended to obey orders. Therefore I suggest taking a close look at some of Isaac Asimov’s robot stories. Executing a program while detecting and overcoming problems and acting towards fulfillment of given instructions—all this makes a robot a perfect slave. In the same way as slave laws in the British Colonies in America were intended to keep slavery effective by confining slaves in their place, so are Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics the formal condition for the workability of a robot holding society. Asimov’s androids reveal the implicit impossibility of both robots and slaves by establishing the command structure that would be needed to keep the system working and then disassembling this structure. The Three Laws, as they are meant to guarantee protection, command, and operation, cannot possibly work with separate master/slave subjects. They are a paradoxical juxtaposition. And consequently, slavery is logically impossible.\n\nArtificial Culture is an examination of the articulation, construction, and representation of \"the artificial\" in contemporary popular cultural texts, especially science fiction films and novels. The book argues that today we live in an artificial culture due to the deep and inextricable relationship between people, our bodies, and technology at large. While the artificial is often imagined as outside of the natural order and thus also beyond the realm of humanity, paradoxically, artificial concepts are simultaneously produced and constructed by human ideas and labor. The artificial can thus act as a boundary point against which we as a culture can measure what it means to be human. Science fiction feature films and novels, and other related media, frequently and provocatively deploy ideas of the artificial in ways which the lines between people, our bodies, spaces and culture more broadly blur and, at times, dissolve. Building on the rich foundational work on the figures of the cyborg and posthuman, this book situates the artificial in similar terms, but from a nevertheless distinctly different viewpoint. After examining ideas of the artificial as deployed in film, novels and other digital contexts, this study concludes that we are now part of an artificial culture entailing a matrix which, rather than separating minds and bodies, or humanity and the digital, reinforces the symbiotic connection between identities, bodies, and technologies.\n\nIn this essay, I will explore the complex ways Isaac Asimov's fiction both engages with and disavows race. Looking mainly at his robot stories -- especially those collected in I, Robot (1950) and the most popular of the Dr. Susan Calvin stories -- I will show how Asimov's robots engage with the legacy of slavery as well as with contemporary racial issues. On the one hand, Asimov's robot stories and novels explicitly draw on tropes of black servitude, such as the way robots are routinely addressed as \"boy\" and older models call humans \"master,\" or the parallels between the logic of slave codes, Jim Crow laws, and the Three Laws of Robotics. On the other hand, Asimov was a committed social liberal, skeptical of Golden Age editor John W. Campbell's tendency to, as Asimov put it, \"take for granted, somehow, the stereotype of the Nordic white as the true representative of Man the Explorer, Man the Darer, Man the Victor.\" His stories often questioned the logic of all prejudice, and he even wrote a non-fiction book, Races and People, popularizing the work of his friend William C. Boyd, which the cover claims will convince the reader \"that there is no such thing as a 'superior race.'\" On yet a third hand (this is science fiction, after all), Asimov resisted the notion that his works were allegories for race. His characters, while not the Aryan engineers favored by more conservative Golden Age authors, were nonetheless privileged users of technology, working out the proper ethics for using their power, and grappling with their unfortunate prejudices; they were, in other words, characters who shared a science fictionalized version the white liberal perspective. Ultimately, this chapter will explicate the racial context into which Asimov's stories were written, offer examples of how to unpack the racial politics of the Robot stories, and situate Asimov's engagement with race in a larger discussion of the racial politics of science fiction and technoculture."
