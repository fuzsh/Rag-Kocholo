        "text": "Depending on the counting convention used,[1] and including all titles, charts, and edited collections, there may be currently over 500 books in Isaac Asimov's bibliography—as well as his individual short stories, individual essays, and criticism. For his 100th, 200th, and 300th books (based on his personal count), Asimov published Opus 100 (1969), Opus 200 (1979), and Opus 300 (1984), celebrating his writing.[2][3][4]\n\nAsimov was so prolific that his books span all major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification except for category 100, philosophy and psychology.[5] Although Asimov did write several essays about psychology,[6] and forewords for the books The Humanist Way (1988) and In Pursuit of Truth (1982),[7] which were classified in the 100s category, none of his own books were classified in that category.[8]\n\nAccording to UNESCO's Index Translationum database, Asimov is the world's 24th most-translated author.[9]\n\nAn online exhibit in West Virginia University Libraries' virtually complete Asimov Collection displays features, visuals, and descriptions of some of his over 600 books, games, audio recordings, videos, and wall charts. Many first, rare, and autographed editions are in the Libraries' Rare Book Room. Book jackets and autographs are presented online along with descriptions and images of children's books, science fiction art, multimedia, and other materials in the collection.[10]\n\nFor a listing of Asimov's science fiction books in chronological order within his future history, see the Foundation series list of books.\n\n\"Greater Foundation\" series\n\nThe Robot series was originally separate from the Foundation series. The Galactic Empire novels were published as independent stories, set earlier in the same universe as Foundation. Later in life, Asimov synthesized the Robot series into a single coherent \"history\" that appeared in the extension of the Foundation series.[11]\n\nRobot series:\n\nAsimov, Isaac (1954).
