        "text": "Here's a list of Isaac Asimov's book titles, arranged by categories in the same fashion as in his autobiographies. The numbering was provided by Asimov (except for a few marked with an asterisk). Unnumbered titles appear roughly in the order they were written. Titles missing from the catalogue at the end of I. Asimov have been added. Notes are delimited by numbers in brackets, and follow at the end. The total number of entries is 506.
