        "text": "If you’re a fan of Isaac Asimov’s books, or are looking to try them, or just love science fiction, then you’re reading the right post! Here are our a few favorite Isaac Asimov books, as well as a complete list of his more than 500 books (a lot of books, right?!).\n\nOur Favorite Isaac Asimov Book\n\nI, Robot\n\nOne of Isaac Asimov’s most popular books, I, Robot is a collection of short stories featuring robots. Robot Asimov actually coined the term “robotics” and in this book introduces the Three Laws of Robotics that are referenced in later books. This book is also a good lead-in to the Robots series, which is both science fiction and mystery and centers around a human detective, Elijah Bailey, and his robot partner, R. Daneel Olivaw. Chronologically, the Robots series comes before the Galactic Empire and the Foundation series, so it’s a great place to start.\n\nFoundation\n\nThis book kicks off the Foundation series, another fan favorite. The Galactic Empire is dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future, to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.\n\nBut soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords. Mankind’s last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and be overrun—or fight them and be destroyed.\n\nThe Gods Themselves\n\nIsaac Asimov said this was his favorite science fiction novel he wrote. This one is unique from his other books because it has aliens. In this book, humanity gains a limitless energy source from a parallel universe. However, it comes at a terrifying cost that few are aware of: the eventual destruction of the Earth and Sun.\n\nThe Last Question\n\nIn this short story, am AI tries to answer the question “how can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?”\n\nComplete List of Isaac Asimov Books\n\nScience Fiction Books\n\nOrder of Lucky Starr Series (written as Paul French)\n\nDavid Starr, Space Ranger (1952)\n\nLucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (1953)\n\nLucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus (1954)\n\nLucky Starr and the Big Sun of Mercury (1956)\n\nLucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter (1957)\n\nLucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn (1958)\n\nOrder of the The Robot Series\n\nI, Robot (1950)\n\nThe Complete Robot (1982) (includes The Rest of the Robots [1964])\n\nRobot Dreams (1986)\n\nRobot Visions (1990)\n\nGold (1995)\n\nThe Bicentennial Man and Other Stories (1976)\n\nMother Earth (1948)\n\nThe Caves of Steel (1954)\n\nThe Naked Sun (1957)\n\nMirror Image (1972)\n\nThe Robots of Dawn (1983)\n\nRobots and Empire (1985)\n\nOrder of Galactic Empire Series\n\nThe Stars, Like Dust / The Rebellious Stars (1951)\n\nThe Currents of Space (1952)\n\nPebble in the Sky (1950)\n\nOrder of Foundation Books\n\nFoundation / The 1,000 Year Plan (1951)\n\nFoundation and Empire / The Man Who Upset the Universe (1952)\n\nSecond Foundation (1953)\n\nFoundation’s Edge (1982)\n\nFoundation and Earth (1986)\n\nPrelude to Foundation (1988) (While chronologically, this and the next come before the rest of the books in the series, they contain spoilers and so are best read afterwards)\n\nForward the Foundation (1993)\n\nPublication Order of Norby Chronicles (with Janet Asimov)\n\nNorby, the Mixed-Up Robot (1983)\n\nNorby’s Other Secret (1984)\n\nNorby and the Lost Princess (1985)\n\nNorby and the Invaders (1985)\n\nNorby and the Queen’s Necklace (1986)\n\nNorby Finds a Villain (1987)\n\nNorby Through Time and Space (1988)\n\nNorby Down to Earth (1989)\n\nNorby and Yobo’s Great Adventure (1989)\n\nNorby and the Oldest Dragon (1990)\n\nNorby and the Court Jester (1996)\n\nNorby and the Terrified Taxi (1997)\n\nPublication Order of Before the Golden Age Books\n\nBefore the Golden Age 1 (1974)\n\nBefore the Golden Age 2 (1974)\n\nBefore the Golden Age 3 (1974)\n\nBefore the Golden Age 4 (1976)\n\nPublication Order of Isaac Asimov Presents the Great SF Stories Books (with Martin H.
