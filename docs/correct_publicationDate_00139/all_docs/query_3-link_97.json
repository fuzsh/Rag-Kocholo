        "text": "Isaac Asimov Books and Movies\n\nIsaac Asimov (January 2, 1920 â April 6, 1992) was highly prolific American science fiction author. Together with Arthur C. Clarke and Robert A. Heinlein he is one of the three grand masters of science fiction. For five decades Isaac Asimov published over 500 books on a wide range of subjects including mystery, poetry, science, humor, literary criticism, mythology, and guides to the Bible.\n\n\"I, Robot\" collection was the first Asimov's literary work made into movie. The short story from this collection was adapted to the first episode of British anthology TV series under the title \"Little Lost Robot\" in 1962.\n\nThe impression is that the late Asimov doesn't attract the film industry. His latest work with the film adaptation is \"Bicentennial Man\" written in 1976. While Asimov was an immensely prolific writer, only 2% of his stories have a film version, probably because most are simply unfilmable.\n\nHere is a chronological list of Isaac Asimov's books along with movies based on his works.\n\nMany Asimov's book lovers are concerned about what order should the series be read in. Most experts recommend to follow chronological order to avoid spoiling revelations. So you can choose to list books by series, where stories within the series are sorted by date."
