        "meta_description": "The Rise of Earth — Fry, Jason, 1969- — For Tycho Hashoone and his family, space privateering on their ship Shadow Comet is a way of life--that just got a lot more complicated. Earth is mounting an arms race, and has started recruiting privateers of their own. Meanwhile, the Ice Wolves of Saturn are on the offensive, using ruthless tactics reminiscent of pirates of old. The Jovian Union, trapped between the two, asks the Hashoones for help, and the stage is set for a showdown on the Cybele asteroids. With so many players, Tycho will have to decide once and for all where his allegiances lie. Because the day when his mother retires as ship captain is fast approaching, and the fate of much more than the Shadow Comet hangs in the balance.--",
