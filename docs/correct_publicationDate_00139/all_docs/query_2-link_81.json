        "text": "Image by Rowena Morrill\n\nWelcome to the Isaac Asimov Blog\n\nI / we at UMPC created this blog as a tribute to Issac Asimov (1920-1992). Isaac Asimov was a Biochemistry Professor at Boston University and a very prolific writer (of many genres of books and stories).\n\nHe is perhaps best remembered for his works of science fiction, particularly the Robots and Empires novels. I alway considered him to be one of the greatest science fiction writers of the 20th century. We hope you will enjoy this series of blogs on 20th century science fiction writers , and in some way we will help perpetuate the works some of these great writers. We are in the process of building out dozens of blogs for others writers, including Arthur C. Clarke, Larry Niven, Philip K . Dick, Robert A. Heinlein, Ben Bova, Douglas Adams, Jerry Pournelle, and many, many others. We are concurrently building a website to house more resources, and hope to have it online and available around April of 2013.\n\nMany of us have been reading and rereading Isaac Asimov’s works for many years. I remembered waiting for his new books to arrive at the bookstore back in the 1990’s. Over the course of the past few years, I spearheaded the initiative started to collect articles, essays and acquiring his works of fiction in ebook format, as some of those older newsprint paperbacks are becoming more scarce (and thus harder to come by).\n\nPerhaps best known for his series of books about Robots, secret Foundations and Galactic empires. The “Three Laws of Robotics” he invented in the 1950’s has become a cornerstone of the science fiction and spawned new scientific genres (namely, in Roboethics, Ethics of Articial Intelligence, Friendly Artificial Intelligence and Machine Ethics) that speaks to human – machine moral agents and interfaces.\n\nBelow you will find a partial bibliography of his sci-fi related works (According to Wikipedia); each work is also referenced with a corresponding Open Library link (below). We support the Open Library foundation’s efforts in making these works available, and their goal of having one web page for every published book.\n\nRobots and Empire Series:\n\nGalactic Empire Novels:\n\nPebble in the Sky. 1950.
