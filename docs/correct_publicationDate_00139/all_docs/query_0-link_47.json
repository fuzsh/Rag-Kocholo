        "text": "Trying to answer your question according to its spirit, I would say 41.\n\nAccording to ISFDb, and discounting all alternate titles, translations and 2 non-genre novels (The Death Dealers and Murder at the ABA), Asimov wrote 37 novels:\n\nPebble in the Sky (1950)\n\nThe Stars, Like Dust (1951)\n\nDavid Starr, Space Ranger (1952)\n\nThe Currents of Space (1952)\n\nLucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (1953)\n\nLucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus (1954)\n\nThe Caves of Steel (1954)\n\nThe End of Eternity (1955)\n\nLucky Starr and the Big Sun of Mercury (1956)\n\nLucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter (1957)\n\nThe Naked Sun (1957)\n\nLucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn (1958)\n\nFantastic Voyage (1966)\n\nThe Gods Themselves (1972)\n\nFoundation's Edge (1982)\n\nNorby, the Mixed-Up Robot (1983) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nThe Robots of Dawn (1983)\n\nNorby's Other Secret (1984) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nNorby and the Lost Princess (1985) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nNorby and the Invaders (1985) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nRobots and Empire (1985)\n\nGrow Old Along with Me (1986) (alternate version of Pebble in the Sky)\n\nNorby and the Queen's Necklace (1986) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nFoundation and Earth (1986)\n\nNorby Finds a Villain (1987) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nFantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain (1987)\n\nNorby Down to Earth (1988) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nPrelude to Foundation (1988)\n\nNorby and Yobo's Great Adventure (1989) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nNemesis (1989)\n\nNorby and the Oldest Dragon (1990) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nNightfall (1990) (with Robert Silverberg)\n\nNorby and the Court Jester (1991) (with Janet Asimov)\n\nChild of Time (1991) (with Robert Silverberg)\n\nThe Positronic Man (1992) (with Robert Silverberg)\n\nForward the Foundation (1993)\n\nIn addition, Asimov wrote 5 collections that, because they consist of related/linked stories, are frequently considered novels:\n\nI, Robot (1950)\n\nFoundation (1951)\n\nFoundation and Empire (1952)\n\nSecond Foundation (1953)\n\nAzazel (1988)\n\nThat makes 41 novels or novel-like publications.\n\nEvery other published work of his SF output appears to be a collection of his short stories or an omnibus that can mix novels and short stories. Because of the great amount of re-use of individual stories across these it is hard to give a good answer how many disjunct collections there might be.\n\nI actually went through the ISFDb search for short fiction and, removing the 36 short stories in the 5 above \"novels,\" duplicates, variations, non-genre stories, extracts, etc., I found 214 unique SF short stories:\n\nMarooned Off Vesta (1939)\n\nThe Weapon Too Dreadful to Use (1939)\n\nTrends (1939)\n\nHalf-Breed (1940)\n\nRing Around the Sun (1940)\n\nThe Callistan Menace (1940)\n\nThe Magnificent Possession (1940)\n\nHomo Sol (1940)\n\nHalf-Breeds on Venus (1940)\n\nHistory (1941)\n\nThe Secret Sense (1941)\n\nHeredity (1941)\n\nNightfall (1941)\n\nSuper-Neutron (1941)\n\nNot Final!

Things get spottier after that, as new stories show up in collections like Omnibus Even More of the Complete Rest of the Robots along with the 67th republishing of the early stories from I, Robot.)\n\nSince I've got this tabulated already, these are the short stories that appear in the novel-like collections:\n\nI Robot:\n\nStrange Playfellow (1940)\n\nReason (1941)\n\nLiar! (1941)\n\nRunaround (1942)\n\nCatch That Rabbit (1944)\n\nEscape! (1945)\n\nEvidence (1946)\n\nLittle Lost Robot (1947)\n\nThe Evitable Conflict (1950)\n\nFoundation:\n\nThe Psychohistorians (1951)\n\nThe Encyclopedists (1942)\n\nThe Mayors (1942)\n\nThe Traders (1944)\n\nThe Merchant Princes (1944)\n\nFoundation and Empire:\n\nThe General (1945)\n\nThe Mule (1945)\n\nSecond Foundation:\n\nSearch by the Mule (1948)\n\nSearch by the Foundation (1949)\n\nAzazel:\n\nOne Night of Song (1982)\n\nTo the Victor (1982)\n\nThe Dim Rumble (1982)\n\nThe Smile That Loses (1982)\n\nSaving Humanity (1983)\n\nA Matter of Principle (1984)\n\nThe Evil Drink Does (1984)\n\nWriting Time (1984)\n\nDashing Through the Snow (1984)\n\nLogic Is Logic (1985)\n\nHe Travels the Fastest (1985)\n\nMore Things in Heaven and Earth 1986)\n\nThe Eye of the Beholder (1986)\n\nThe Mind's Construction (1986)\n\nThe Fights of Spring (1987)\n\nGalatea (1987)\n\nFlight of Fancy (1988)\n\nThe Two-Centimeter Demon (1988)\n\n(For the stories that comprise the Foundation trilogy I'm using the names as published in those books, instead of the names Campbell used for their original publication in Astounding, because they are far better known under the latter names.)"
