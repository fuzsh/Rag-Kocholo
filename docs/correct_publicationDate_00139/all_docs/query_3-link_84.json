        "text": "University Lowbrow Astronomers Book List\n\nAstronomy Books Written by Isaac Asimov\n\nby Dave Snyder\n\nThe late Isaac Asimov was a very prolific author. He had an amazing talent for explaining complex scientific ideas in simple language without using mathematics. As of his death in 1992, he had published several hundred books. Among his books were a number of essay books, each of which included a series of essays that covered a range of scientific topics.\n\nThe following is a list of Asimov books which are either devoted to astronomy or include at least one essay on astronomy. Some of these books (especially the older ones) contain information which is out of date, but most of the ideas are still valid.\n\nIsaac Asimov also wrote a number of astronomy books for children\n\nBooks\n\nAsimov, Isaac. 1957.
