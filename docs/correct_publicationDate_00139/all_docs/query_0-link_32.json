There are six stages, taking students from elementary to advanced level. At the lower stages, many of the texts have been specially written for the series, to provide elementary and lower intermediate students with an introduction to real reading in English. At the higher stages, most of the books have been adapted from works originally published for native speakers. The language controls used in ‘Oxford Bookworms’ are based on a syllabus specially created for the series by Tricia Hedge. This takes account of the more traditional approaches to grading and recent research into the nature of reading difficulty. The approximate vocabulary count for each stage is: Stage 1 400 words; Stage 2 700 words; Stage 3 1000 words; Stage 4 1400 words; Stage 5 1800 words; Stage 6 2500 words. All stages have exercises for classroom or private use, plus a supporting glossary to help students with vocabulary. Illustrations are used, especially at the lower stages, to help comprehension.\n\nThe Caves of Steel\n\nA millennium into the future, two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain. Isaac Asimov’s Robot novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together. Like most people left behind on an over populated Earth, New York City police detective Elijah Baley had little love for either the arrogant Spacers or their robotic companions. But when a prominent Spacer is murdered under mysterious circumstances, Baley is ordered to the Outer Worlds to help track down the killer. The relationship between Baley and his Spacer superiors, who mistrusted all Earthmen, was strained from the start. Then he learned that they had assigned him a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw. Worst of all was that the ‘R’ stood for robot and his positronic partner was made in the image and likeness of the murder victim!\n\nThe Naked Sun\n\nA millennium into the future, two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the Galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain. On the beautiful Outer World planet of Solaria, a handful of human colonists lead a hermit like existence, their every need attended to by their faithful robot servants. To this strange and provocative planet comes Detective Elijah Baley, sent from the streets of New York with his positronic partner, the robot R. Daneel Olivaw, to solve an incredible murder that has rocked Solaria to its foundations. The victim had been so reclusive that he appeared to his associates only through holographic projection. Yet someone had gotten close enough to bludgeon him to death while robots looked on. Now Baley and Olivaw are faced with two clear impossibilities: Either the Solarian was killed by one of his robots unthinkable under the laws of Robotics or he was killed by the woman who loved him so much that she never came into his presence!\n\nThe Rest of the Robots\n\nThe Rest of the Robots is the third timeless, amazing and amusing volume of Isaac Asimov’s robot stories, offering golden insights into robot thought processes. Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics have since been programmed into real computers the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and used as the outline for a legal robotic charter in Korea. ROBOT TONY is the first robot designed to perform domestic duties by the US Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation. Is it Tony’s fault that the lady of the house where he’s field tested falls in love with him? ROBOT AL was intended for shipment to a mining outfit on the moon. Instead, he’s loose in the mountains of Virginia…\n\nbuilding from scraps of junk his very own, very dangerous disintegrator. ROBOT LENNY answers workaday questions in babytalk. So why is Dr Susan Calvin, the world’s top robopsychologist, fascinated by this messed up specimen of an industrial robot?\n\nThe Robots of Dawn\n\nA millennium into the future two advances have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the Galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain. Isaac Asimov’s Robot novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together. Detective Elijah Baiey is called to the Spacer world Aurora to solve a bizarre case of roboticide. The prime suspect is a gifted roboticist who had the means, the motive, and the opportunity to commit the crime. There’s only one catch: Baley and his positronic partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, must prove the man innocent. For in a case of political intrigue and love between woman and robot gone tragically wrong, there’s more at stake than simple justice. This time Baley’s career, his life, and Earth’s right to pioneer the Galaxy lie in the delicate balance.\n\nRobots and Empire\n\nIsaac Asmiov’s classic novel about the decline and fall of Solaria. Gladia Delmarre’s homeworld, the Spacer planet Solaria, has been abandoned by its human population. Countless robots remain there. And when traders from Settler worlds attempt to salvage them, the robots of Solaria turn to killing…\n\nin defiance of the Three Laws of Robotics. Pax Robotica Long ago, Gladia’s robots Daneel and Giskard played a vital role in opening the worlds beyond the Solar system to Settlers from Earth. Now the conscience stricken robots are faced with an even greater challenge. Either the sacred Three Laws of Robotics are in ruins or a new, superior Law must be established to bring peace to the galaxy. With Madam Gladia and D.G. Baley the captain of the Settler traders and a descendant of the robots’ friend Elijah Baley Daneel and Giskard travel to the robot stronghold of Solaria…\n\nwhere they uncover a sinister Spacer plot to destroy Earth itself.\n\nRobot Dreams\n\nRobot Dreams spans the body of Asimov’s fiction from the 1940s to the mid 80s, and features classic Asimovian themes, from the scientific puzzle to the extraterrestrial thriller, all introduced in an exclusive essay written especially for this collection. TP: Ace.\n\nRobot Visions\n\nFrom the writer whose name is synonymous with the science of robotics comes five decades of Robot Visions 36 landmark stories and essays, plus three rare tales gathered together in one volume\n\nPebble in the Sky\n\nOne moment Joseph Schwartz is a happily retired tailor in 1949 Chicago. The next he’s a helpless stranger on Earth during the heyday of the first Galactic Empire. Earth, he soon learns, is a backwater, just a Pebble in the Sky, despised by all the other 200 million planets of the Empire because its people dare to claim it s the original home of man. And Earth is poor, with great areas of radioactivity ruining much of its soil so poor that everyone is sentenced to death at the age of sixty. Joseph Schwartz is sixty two. This is young Isaac Asimov s first novel, full of wonders and ideas, the book that launched the novels of the Galactic Empire, culminating in the Foundation books and novels. It is also one of that select group of SF adventures that since the early 1950s has hooked generations of teenagers on reading science fiction. This is Golden Age SF at its finest.\n\nThe Stars, Like Dust / The Rebellious Stars\n\nBiron Farrell was young and na ve, but he was growing up fast. A radiation bomb planted in his dorm room changed him from an innocent student at the University of Earth to a marked man, fleeing desperately from an unknown assassin. He soon discovers that, many light years away, his father, the highly respected Rancher of Widemos, has been murdered. Stunned, grief stricken, and outraged, Biron is determined to uncover the reasons behind his father’s death, and becomes entangled in an intricate saga of rebellion, political intrigue, and espionage. The mystery takes him deep into space where he finds himself in a relentless struggle with the power mad despots of Tyrann. Now it is not just a case of life or death for Biron, but a question of freedom for the galaxy .\n\nThe Currents of Space\n\nHigh above the planet Florinia, the Squires of Sark live in unimaginable wealth and comfort. Down in the eternal spring of the planet, however, the native Florinians labor ceaselessly to produce the precious kyrt that brings prosperity to their Sarkite masters. Rebellion is unthinkable and impossible. Not only do the Florinians no longer have a concept of freedom, any disruption of the vital kyrt trade would cause other planets to rise in protest, ultimately destabilizing trade and resulting in a galactic war. So the Trantorian Empire, whose grand plan is to unite all humanity in peace, prosperity, and freedom, has stood aside and allowed the oppression to continue. Living among the workers of Florinia, Rik is a man without a memory or a past. He has been abducted and brainwashed. Barely able to speak or care for himself when he was found, Rik is widely regarded as a simpleton by the worker community where he lives. But as his memories begin to return, Rik finds himself driven by a cryptic message he is determined to deliver: Everyone on Florinia is doomed…\n\nThe Currents of Space are bringing destruction. But if the planet is evacuated, the power of Sark will end so some would finish the job and would kill the messenger. The fate of the Galaxy hangs in the balance.\n\nFoundation / The 1,000 Year Plan\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy In this landmark of imaginative fiction, winner of a special Hugo Award as Best All Time Science Fiction Series, Asimov has brilliantly conceived a whole new world for mankind, set far in the future and spanning a period of more than a thousand years. The beginning of the epic, Foundation, describes how one man creates a new force for civilised life as the old Galactic Empire crumbles into barbarism. Foundation and Empire is the story of the mighty conflict for mastery of the stars between these two major powers. In Second Foundation a new and even more terrifying threat to the future of humanity arises in the form of a dangerous mutant, capable of manipulating men’s minds and destroying the universe…\n\nThe Stars, Like Dust A masterpiece of suspense and drama: Biron Farrill sets out on a dangerous quest through the galaxies to find ‘Rebellion World’ and its key to man’s future peace. The Naked Sun Earth’s very existence is at stake when a murder takes place on power hungry Solaria. One of the greatest detective stories in the science fiction canon. I, Robot The classic vision of a future where robots are so sophisticated that mankind is threatened with redundancy. Stories include: Robbie, Runaround, Reason, Catch That Rabbit, Liar!, Little Lost Robot, Escape!, Evidence, and The Evitable Conflict.\n\nFoundation and Empire / The Man Who Upset the Universe\n\nThe Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov are one of the great masterworks of science fiction. Unsurpassed for their unique blend of nonstop action, daring ideas, and extensive world building, they chronicle the struggle of a courageous group of men and women to preserve humanity’s light against an inexorable tide of darkness and violence. Led by its founding father, the great psychohistorian Hari Seldon, and taking advantage of its superior science and technology, the Foundation has survived the greed and barbarism of its neighboring warrior planets. Yet now it must face the Empire still the mightiest force in the Galaxy even in its death throes. When an ambitious general determined to restore the Empire s glory turns the vast Imperial fleet toward the Foundation, the only hope for the small planet of scholars and scientists lies in the prophecies of Hari Seldon. But not even Hari Seldon could have predicted the birth of the extraordinary creature called The Mule a mutant intelligence with a power greater than a dozen battle fleets a power that can turn the strongest willed human into an obedient slave. From the Paperback edition.\n\nSecond Foundation\n\nWhen the First Foundation was conquered by a force Seldon had not foreseen the overwhelming power of a single individual, a mutant called the Mule the Second Foundation was forced to reveal its existence and, infinitely worse, a portion of its power. One man understood the shifting patterns of the inhabited cosmos. This was Hari Seldon, the last great scientist of the First Empire. The mathematics of psychohistory enabled Seldon to predict the collapse of the Empire and the onset of an era of chaos and war. To restore civilization in the shortest possible time, Seldon set up two Foundations. The First was established on Terminus in the full daylight of publicity. But the Second, ‘at the other end of the galaxy’, took shape behind a veil of total silence. Because the Second Foundation guards the laws of psychohistory, which are valid only so long as they remain secret. So far the Second Foundation‘s location, its most closely guarded secret of all, has been kept hidden. The Mule and the remnants of the First Foundation will do anything to discover it. This is the story of the Second Foundation.\n\nFoundation’s Edge\n\nAt last, the costly and bitter war between the two Foundations had come to an end. The scientists of the First Foundation had proved victorious; and now they retum to Hari Seldon’s long established plan to build a new Empire that the Second Foundation is not destroyed after all and that its still defiant survivors are preparing their revenge. Now the two exiled citizens of the Foundation a renegade Councilman and the doddering historian set out in search of the mythical planet Earth…\n\nand proof that the Second Foundation still exists. Meanwhile someone or something outside of both Foundations sees to be orchestrating events to suit its own ominous purpose. Soon representatives of both the First and Second Foundations will find themselves racing toward a mysterious world called Gaia and a final shocking destiny at the very end of the universe!\n\nFoundation and Earth\n\nThe epic story of the Foundation is one of the great classics of science fiction by the Grand Master of the genre. Isaac Asimov’s legendary saga, winner of the Hugo Award for Best All Time Novel Series, has enthralled generations of readers and continues to amaze. All records of Earth have been removed systematically from the libraries of Foundation worlds. Now Councilman Golan Trevize and Professor Janov Pelorat traverse the galaxy in search of humanity’s ancestral planet. On worlds beyond the Foundation’s influence, superstition and taboo shroud the subject of their quest. To name Earth is to utter an obscenity. Fortunately, the space travellers find allies and Pelorat finds a lover named Bliss among the telepaths of the planet Gaia. As they near their destination, Bliss picks up thought waves of intelligent beings. What she cannot tell is whether or not those beings are human.\n\nPrelude to Foundation\n\nIn Prelude to Foundation, what happed in the many centuries before the events made famous in Asimov’s other Foundation novels hitherto only hinted at is now revealed. The Key to the Future It is the year 12,020 G.E. and the last Galactic Emperor of the Autun dynasty, Cleon I, sits uneasily on the throne. These are troubled times and Cleon is desperate to find a way to calm them. When young Outworld mathematician Hari Seldon arrives on Trantor to present a paper on psychohistory, his astounding theory of prediction, the emperor believes that his future security may rest on Seldon’s prophetic powers. But Hari Seldon becomes the most wanted man in the Empire as he struggles desperately to keep his remarkable theory from falling into the wrong hands. At the same time he must he must forge the key to the future a power to be known as the Foundation.\n\nForward the Foundation\n\nA stunning testament to his creative genius. Forward the Foundation is a the saga’s dramatic climax the story Asimov fans have been waiting for. An exciting tale of danger, intrigue, and suspense, Forward the Foundation brings to vivid life Asimov’s best loved characters: hero Hari Seldon, who struggles to perfect his revolutionary theory of psychohistory to ensure the survival of humanity; Cleon II, the vain and crafty emperor of the Galactic Empire,\n\nLucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter\n\nIn the first novella, an alien spy threatens to sabotage a secret project that could give the Earth overwhelming advantage in space, and in the second, the Sirian empires establishes an outpost on the Saturnian moon.\n\nLucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn\n\nLucky Starr and his crew travel through space in pursuit of an enemy agent carrying a stolen capsule containing important information about Earth.\n\nPuzzles of the Black Widowers\n\nOnce a month, the seven members of the Black Widowers Club gather for dinner at their favourite restaurant. To each dinner a guest is invited, and each guest has a problem too large and complex to solve on his own. This is the fifth collection of the ‘Black Widowers’ stories.\n\nThe Return of the Black Widowers\n\nUntil his death in 1992, author Isaac Asimov would write more than 120 ingenious tales of detection and deduction, and in 66 of them he would present his armchair detectives, the Black Widowers, with the mind teasing puzzles that they would strive to solve in often quarrelsome conversation. The Black Widowers club is meeting again. In a private dining room at New York’s luxurious Milano restaurant, the six brilliant men once more gather for fine fare served impeccably by their peerless waiter, Henry. At table, too, will of course be that requisite dinner guest to challenge their combined deductive wit: a man whose marriage hinges on finding a lost umbrella; a woman shadowed by an adversary who knows her darkest secrets; a debunker of psychics unable to explain his unnerving experience in a haunted house; or a symphony cellist accused of attacking his wife with a kitchen knife. In addition to six stories that have never before appeared in any collection, this volume includes the ten best ever Black Widowers cases, among them the very first to be published, in Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine, as well as the first brand new Black Widowers story to appear in more than ten years.\n\nNorby’s Other Secret (With: Janet Asimov)\n\nWhen unscrupulous scientists try to kidnap Norby in order to learn the secret of the robot’s anti gravitational capabilities, he and Jeff discover on the dragon inhabited planet Jamya the key to an even more precious secret.\n\nNorby and the Court Jester (With: Janet Asimov)\n\nAnticipating nothing but fun during spring break at the Space Academy, Jeff Wells and his robot, Norby, prepare to visit their friend Pera, but their plans are disrupted when Pera is attacked by an evil court jester. SLJ. Ab. K.\n\nThe End of Eternity\n\nOne of Isaac Asimov’s SF masterpieces, this stand alone novel is a monument of the flowering of SF in the 20th century. It is widely regarded as Asimov s single best SF novel and one every SF fan should read. Andrew Harlan is an Eternal, a member of the elite of the future. One of the few who live in Eternity, a location outside of place and time, Harlan s job is to create carefully controlled and enacted Reality Changes.

The beginning of time. The origin of life. In our Western civilization, there are two influential accounts of beginnings. One is the Biblical account, compiled more than two thousand years ago by Judean writers who based much of their thinking on the Babylonian astronomical lore of the day. The other is the account of modern science, which, in the last century, has slowly built up a coherent picture of how it all began. Both represent the best thinking of their times, and in this line by line annotation of the first eleven chapters of Genesis, Isaac Asimov carefully and even handedly compares the two accounts, pointing out where they are similar and where they are different. ‘There is no version of primeval history, preceding the discoveries of modern science, that is as rational and as inspiriting as that of the Book of Genesis,’ Asimov says. However, human knowledge does increase, and if the Biblical writers, ‘had written those early chapters of Genesis knowing what we know today, we can be certain that they would have written it completely differently.’ Isaac Asimov brings to this fascinating subject his wide ranging knowledge of science and history and his award winning ability to explain the complex with accuracy, clarity, and wit.\n\nThe Roving Mind\n\nIsaac Asimov’s death on 6 April 1992, was a great loss to the world of literary science and free thought.

His predictions about cloning which has only recently become the topic of public debate the theory of ‘technophobia’, and other scientific developments are astounding. In a lighter tone, Asimov includes several personal stories from his life including thoughts on his style of writing and memories of family in younger days. With tributes by Arthur C Clarke, L Sprague de Camp, Harlan Ellison, Kendrick Frazier, Martin Gardner, Donald Goldsmith, Stephen Jay Gould, E C Krupp, Frederik Pohl, and Carl Sagan.\n\nBeginnings\n\nA wondrous excursion through 15 billion years of human and prehuman history, written by America’s most popular and exciting science writer.

Asimov\n\nArguably the greatest science fiction writer who ever lived, Isaac Asimov also possessed one of the most brilliant and original minds of our time. His accessible style and far reaching interests in subjects ranging from science to humor to history earned him the nickname ‘the Great Explainer.’ I. Asimov is his personal story vivid, open, and honest as only Asimov himself could tell it. Here is the story of the paradoxical genius who wrote of travel to the stars yet refused to fly in airplanes; who imagined alien universes and vast galacticcivilizations while staying home to write; who compulsively authored more than 470 books yet still found the time to share his ideas with some of the greatminds of our century. Here are his wide ranging thoughts and sharp eyed observations on everything from religion to politics, love and divorce, friendship and Hollywood, fame and mortality. Here, too, is a riveting behind the scenes look at the varied personalities Campbell, Ellison, Heinlein, Clarke, del Rey, Silverberg, and others who along with Asimov helped shape science fiction.

Now, these volumes have been condensed into one by Asimov’s wife, Janet, who also shares excerpts from letters he wrote to her. Together these writings provide an intimate portrait of a creative genius whose love of learning and playing with ideas is evident on every page. Reading this autobiography is like sitting down with Isaac Asimov and experiencing his witty, engaging, and brilliant personality first hand. Janet Jeppson Asimov concludes this work with a shocking revelation about her husband’s.\n\nThe Mammoth Book of Golden Age Science Fiction\n\nThe Golden Age of Science Fiction, from the early 1940s through the 1950s, saw an explosion of talent in SF writing, including authors such as Isaac Asimov, Robert A.
