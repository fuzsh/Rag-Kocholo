        "text": "For all fans of Isaac & Janet Jeppson Asimov\n\nAttention all fans of Isaac Asimov. Here is a little bit more information from a sweetly personal viewpoint on our favorite author. The bits about Janet are also illuminating and valued. She shares her early life (information many of us have hungered for) and many of Isaac's unpublished views on the world. A real treasure.\n\nNot worth the time.\n\nAn semi-interesting book, on its own, but if you're expecting new insights on the life of Isaac Asimov, there are better books for that. I read it in a couple hours, and it will now go into the pile of rejects to trade down at the local used bookstore."
