After Isaac's death, she represented the Asimov estate and authorized or even asked for the second Foundation trilogy, a trilogy of robot mysteries by Mark W. Tiedemann, another mystery by Alexander C. Irvine and the I, Robot prequel trilogy by Mickey Zucker Reichert.

She edited the book It's Been a Good Life (2002), which is a collection of Isaac Asimov's diaries, personal letters and condensated three earlier autobiographies.

Notes for a Memoir: On Isaac Asimov, Life, and Writing (2006) is her own memoir, capturing besides other things her memories on the husband.
