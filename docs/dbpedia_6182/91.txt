WTWW (2018 ARRL Field Day Live): June 23, 2018

Many thanks to SRAA contributor, Bill Hemphill, for the following recording and notes:

I recorded the first two hours of the WTWW Field Day live broadcast off the air on 9930 kHz. I edited the audio file to remove most of the music. This shortened the audio file to about 80 minutes in length. Reception was on a Tecsun S-8800 with indoor wire antenna at my home in Smithville, NJ (5 miles north of Atlantic City).
