WTWW, We Transmit World Wide, is a Christian shortwave station in Lebanon, Tennessee. It opened in 2010, and uses a 100,000-watt Continental transmitter and a Harris 50,000-watt transmitter to broadcast programming to eastern Canada, Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East. It is owned by the Leap of Faith company. There are less than a dozen large shortwave radio stations broadcasting internationally from the continental USA. Most of them are transmitting Christian programming to some of the estimated 250 million people in remote parts of the world that still listen to shortwave radios.
