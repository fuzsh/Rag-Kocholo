        "text": "I WAS taught not listen to the radio while I worked. One of the fastest-growing Internet industries, Web radio, is based on breaking that very rule.\n\nThere are two kinds of Web radio, both of which can be heard via streaming-audio technology. One kind is really ordinary radio that is heard over the Internet. The Web now makes it possible to tune into an out-of-state baseball game or listen to your favorite college radio station without leaving town. The other kind of Web radio was created exclusively for the Internet. Together, traditional broadcasters and Internet-only start-ups offer more than 1,700 audio channels that you can listen to through your computer.\n\n''It's a critical mass of choice,'' said Larry Magne, editor of the original edition of ''Passport to Web Radio'' (International Broadcasting Service, 1997), which describes stations from Texas to Taipei. (An updated edition, edited by David Walcutt, appeared earlier this year.) Web sites like www.broadcast.com and the BRS Radio Directory (www.radio-directory.com) act as portals to thousands of traditional and Web-only stations.\n\nMr. Magne said that in traditional broadcast markets, many genres, like classical, are losing out to programming that draws better advertising. The Web provides a broader range of choice. For example, Mr. Magne said that Radio Beethoven, a tiny classical station that broadcasts from Santiago, Chile, is one of the best classical radio stations around (www.beethovenfm.cl/RealAudio/ index.html).\n\nMany Web-only radio stations were founded on the idea of countering a trend toward less broadcast diversity. Web technology allows stations to offer niche programs. Some are homespun pirate stations or stations devoted to only one band, like www.deadradio.com, which exclusively plays the Grateful Dead.\n\nIn addition to the many independent stations, there are larger Internet-only networks that offer multiple channels of music and talk. Three of those reviewed here -- Imagine Radio, Netradio and Spinner -- have eliminated audio advertisements and disk jockey chatter. They offer a wide variety of programming and, in the case of Imagine, personalizing programming.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
