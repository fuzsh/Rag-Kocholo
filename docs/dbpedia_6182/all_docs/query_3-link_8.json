        "text": "It is not very often that you can hear a new HF shortwave radio station sign on the air. WTWW, a new International Shortwave Radio facility just outside of Nashville, TN is launching a new transmitter this Saturday with a broadcast we are calling ‘This Is Only A Test’ starting at 4 pm Central Standard Time. This is a 100,000 watt transmitter running into a full size rhombic antenna.\n\nThis is a global radio event with radios being tuned in all over the world.\n\nThe QSO Radio Show has requested that we could air this broadcast as a amateur radio event to promote amateur radio along with shortwave listening. Why? Well, the shortwave listening audience is huge.\n\nThe typical shortwave radio listener is a great potential candidate for amateur radio.\n\nThere are more than 1.5 billion shortwave receivers in use worldwide, the BBC estimates that at any given moment, over 200 million sets are tuned to shortwave broadcasts.\n\nThis is the second time WTWW has allowed us to conduct this kind of broadcast on a powerful new shortwave facility.\n\nThe purpose of this broadcast is to demonstrate HF communications and to put radio amateurs on the air to a worldwide audience to tell their story.\n\nThis is not a commercial venture in any way.\n\nSo spread the word to all of your amateur radio friends and call us on Saturday on “This Is Only A Test” and talk to the world about Amateur Radio!\n\nThanks and 73\n\nTed Randall\n\nQSO Radio Show\n\nhttp://www.qsoradioshow.com\n\nYOU ARE INVITED TO SHARE THE MAGIC OF HF BROADCASTING AND AMATEUR RADIO TO A WORLD WIDE LISTENING AUDIENCE.\n\nYOU ARE INVITED TO CALL IN AND SHARE WITH A HUGE GLOBAL RADIO AUDIENCE.\n\nWHAT YOU LOVE ABOUT AMATEUR RADIO\n\nYOUR FAVORITE MODES KHZ\n\nYOUR LOCAL AMATEUR RADIO CLUB AND ITS ACTIVITIES\n\nYOUR PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN AMATEUR RADIO THIS SATURDAY Feb 11 at 4 PM CENTRAL\n\nFROM 4 – 6 PM / 2200 – 2400 UTC THE FREQUENCY IS 9990\n\n6 – 10 PM / 2400 – 0400 UTC THE FREQUENCY IS 5085 KHZ\n\nTHE CALL IN NUMBER IS 615-547-9520"
