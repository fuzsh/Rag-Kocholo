        "text": "What does the Bible really say about the end times? There are, in fact, many Bible verses about the end times that speak about the future return of Christ and the events and conditions that will one day come to fruition. These verses and themes are explored in countless films that you can watch right now on Great American Pure Flix.\n\nSubscribe to the Great American Pure Flix Insider newsletter for the latest faith & entertainment news\n\n\"The Dark: Great Deceiver,\" among other feature films, is inspired by events described in the Book of Revelation, the prophetic book that concludes the New Testament.\n\nAnd while the Book of Revelation is the most well-known set of Bible verses about the end times, for most Christians when studying end times prophecy, it is far from the only place in scripture that describes what will unfold during the “last days.”\n\nEschatology, which is also known as “end times” theology, is an area of biblical study that has captivated the masses for more than two millennia. Over time, various interpretations and theories have emerged surrounding Christ’s return and the end of the world as we know it. These ideas have been embedded in contemporary books and films, as believers look to entertainment — and current events — for clues surrounding what’s to come.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about what the Bible says about the end times, here are some additional key passages for you to take into consideration:\n\nBible Verses About The End Times\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 (NIV)\n\nBrothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words.\n\nMatthew 24:40-41 (NIV)\n\nTwo men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.\n\n2 Timothy 3:1-5 (NIV)\n\nBut mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God — having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.\n\nMatthew 24:6 (NIV)\n\nYou will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.\n\nIf you're looking for a series about the end times, watch: The \"Left Behind\" trilogy is available on Great American Pure Flix. Stream the whole trilogy with a free trial today. \"Left Behind,\" \"Left Behind: Tribulation Force\" and \"Left Behind: World At War\" are available today!\n\nMark 13:32 (NIV)\n\nBut about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\n\nMatthew 24:7 (NIV)\n\nNation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.\n\n1 Corinthians 15:52-54 (NIV)\n\n...in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”\n\nRead Also: 11 Christian Movies About The End Times\n\n1 Timothy 4:1 (NIV)\n\nThe Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.\n\nJoel 2:28-32 (NIV)\n\nAnd afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions. Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days. I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the Lord has said, even among the survivors whom the Lord calls.\n\nMatthew 24:21 (NIV)\n\nFor then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.\n\nEzekiel 36:24 (NIV)\n\n‘For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land.'\n\nThese Bible verses about the end times only scratch the surface when it comes to biblical prophecies. When learning about eschatology, it is important that we always remember that no one knows the day nor the hour. We must also specifically remember the words of Jesus in Matthew 24:36 (NIV), “But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\"\n\nTo watch any of the end times movies mentioned above — as well as hundreds of other faith and family movies and shows — try Great American Pure Flix during your free trial."
