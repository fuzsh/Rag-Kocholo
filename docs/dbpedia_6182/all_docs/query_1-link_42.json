        "text": "The Narrow Path is the radio and internet ministry of Steve Gregg, a servant Bible teacher to the body of Christ. We hope that you may find great benefit from the valuable resources offered here without charge. If you click on the various tabs above, you will be able to peruse all that is available.\n\nThe ministry continues because God provides servant coworkers, who tirelessly labor and generously finance the ministry. We trust that God will provide all our needs as long as it is His will that we continue – as He has done since the program began in 1997.\n\nIf you would like to listen to Steve’s live broadcasts, but do not live in an area where it is broadcast, you may do so by visiting the Radio Program page. There you will find a links to listen to either the “live” broadcasts, or to the archived programs. They are also found at Matthew713.com & Theos.org/media. It is possible to subscribe to the podcast of the show, which is found here: tnp.theeggbeater.net."
