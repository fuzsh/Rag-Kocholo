        "text": "(2 Timothy 2:2) The world, the flesh and the devil. According to Dr. J. Vernon McGee, these are three enemies that constantly oppose and seek to destroy every child of God. In this study we determine the strategy of these three enemies and discover the method to overcome them and live in victory.\n\nWhat will you say when you come to the end of your life’s journey? Will you look back at all your accomplishments or express gratitude for those who impacted your life for good? Is there something even more important to speak about at that time?\n\n“God would take an entire book of the Old Testament to put a primary emphasis on a particular doctrine that was to be developed in Christ. I suppose God patiently, again and again and again, went over these things so that the human family might learn.” Dr. J. Vernon McGee shares this truth and shows us how God used Jonah to foreshadow the greatest story ever told—the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nAs the day of Christ's death drew near, His burden for Jerusalem grew heavy in His heart. But Jesus was not the only man to weep over Jerusalem, for there was a man whom God used to send His final message of judgment to the people of Judah.\n\nWhen God spoke through His prophets, He had them use real life experiences or even act out their messages. Hosea was told to marry a prostitute, Ezekiel dug through a wall in his house, and Joel used a locust storm to make his point. And in Jeremiah’s prophecy we find one of the most familiar prophetic illustrations of all.\n\nAmong the noise and activity of life in a busy world, it can be difficult to find a quiet spot away from the telephones, televisions, cars, sirens, and many other distractions. But believers can find a sanctuary of the soul.\n\n(Jeremiah) “If you’re not worshipping the living God, you have a god. It may be yourself, money, status, sex, or something else. We have many substitutes for God.” That's the important message we hear from Dr. J. Vernon McGee as we the travel the pages of Jeremiah. Hear Jeremiah's earnest pleadings and solemn warnings to those who turned from God and see why the words of the ancient prophet still speak to us today.\n\nIf you had to choose a man to give a harsh message to an unresponsive and hostile audience, would you pick someone with tender emotions who would likely cry about the message he had to deliver? That's the kind of man God chose to bring a tough message to His people.\n\nOver 40 years ago, Dr. McGee said that “lawlessness is growing and will finally break out until it actually is world revolution.” Lawlessness began with the fall of man in Genesis chapter 3, and according to Scripture it will culminate in the person of the Antichrist during the Great Tribulation."
