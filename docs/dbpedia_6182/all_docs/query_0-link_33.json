        "text": "Freedom. That’s what Independence Day is about, freedom bought by the selfless sacrifices of men and women who have given so much to keep this free nation free. We give thanks for the many freedoms we enjoy today, and for the brave souls who gave their lives in the armed forces to secure and preserve those freedoms. Because of them, the United States of America is a free nation that draws people from across the globe.\n\nAs we enjoy this day of freedom—freedom to celebrate, to gather, to eat, to mourn, to live out our values as we see fit—let’s remember who helped secure that precious freedom with the price of their blood. And even more importantly, let’s remember the One who first shed His blood to purchase freedom from sin for all mankind—Jesus Christ with these 20 Independence Day bible verses.\n\nEnjoy these FREE Independence Day Coloring Sheets\n\nAs the Scriptures say of Jesus, “Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13). Jesus calls “friend” all those who trust in His Name, and He gave His life to secure their freedom. The Bible even says, “God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). Because of what Jesus has done, there is hope of freedom for the whole world.\n\nFreedom comes from God, because wherever the Spirit is, there is freedom (2 Cor. 3:17), and whoever the Son (Jesus) sets free is free indeed (John 8:36). But freedom is won with sacrifice. Sacrifice is a God-given value, and God’s Word brings meaning and honor to the sacrifices of both His Son and our soldiers. So let’s dig into His Word to find comfort, strength, and hope on this special day. As faith is birthed in our hearts, let us pray for the soldiers who are yet serving today.\n\nOperation Blessing seeks to display the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ to a hurting world so that all might live in freedom, and we join our prayers with yours to see the U.S.A. remain free.\n\n20 Independence Day Bible Verses\n\nRemembering Their Sacrifice\n\nJohn 15:13 — Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.\n\nPhilippians 2:3-4 — Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.

His heart is steady; he will not be afraid, until he looks in triumph on his adversaries.\n\nPsalm 27:3 — Though an army encamp against me, heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, yet I will be confident.\n\nEphesians 6:13 — “…take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.”\n\nScripture is quoted from the ESV® Bible (The Holy Bible, English Standard Version®).
