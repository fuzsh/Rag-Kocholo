        "text": "Alamo City Online Family,\n\nWe are just in awe, and continue to be blown away - at how the Lord is USING VIDEO, just images and sounds on a screen, to somehow bring His Spirit, His hope and His love to the hearts of people in POWER every minute of every day!\n\nOver the last two years- we’ve reached over 12 MILLION PEOPLE with our broadcast ministry- which is incredible, but more importantly,\n\nwe’ve watched the Lord build a FAMILY from all over the world that gathers\n\nunder the banner of the name JESUS.\n\nA family who worships together- not all at the same time, and certainly not all in the same room- but the praises go up and hearts are turned toward Jesus every time someone is able to watch a message, worship with us, and suddenly- we are not alone. Jesus is there- and there’s a body of Believers who we feel at home with, no matter where we live. What an incredible community He is building, one video at a time!\n\nEvery single week we broadcast out our services from our home base of Alamo City Church in San Antonio, Texas. We invest about $5000 a week to bring you the highest quality sound, video, and broadcasting that’s available. We have an incredible team of professionals who love Jesus who help us get the messages and worship out every single week. We hear from people every single week who watch, who call Alamo City their online church home, who have been deeply blessed.\n\nWe pray every single week that the messages, the worship songs, the Scripture presented in each broadcast would meet every heart that the Lord knows needs to hear it. That He would supernaturally use a simple video to somehow, bring His healing, His hope, His Kingdom to hurting hearts.\n\nIf you’ve been blessed in any way- we’d love to hear from you. We’re praying for you! Read on to learn more about how you can help us ensure we keep broadcasting for the 2024 year. Bless you! We love you!"
