        "text": "\"Civil religion is the idea that … there is this religion of the country… It has saints like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and maybe Martin Luther King. And it has scriptures like the Gettysburg Address and the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. And it has holy days like the Fourth of July.\" -- Stephen Prothero\n\nThroughout their history, Americans have produced a body of work -- sermons and speeches, books and declarations -- that have can be considered part of \"American Scripture.\" Spanning nearly 400 years, these voices from the past create a rich and complex fugue: They protest injustice; they argue founding principles; they summon citizens to action and they urge them to live up to the nation's loftiest ideals. These documents are wildly variegated in their tone, style, rhetoric, subject matter and point of view. At times they were created specifically to address believers; just as often they are intended for a secular audience. Together they converge to create a canon whose authority is not derived from enforced orthodoxy, but from the authenticity conferred by Americans of many faith traditions -- as well as nonbelievers -- who instinctively recognize in these words a decidedly American spirit, one characterized by a restless seeking, insistent questioning and a call to realize the inspiring principles set forth by the our country's earliest leaders. Here are examples of some of the key documents of American Scripture."
