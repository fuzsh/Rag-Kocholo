        "text": "Every month I try and find a resource that will help you continue exploring our theme on the radio. These books have been hand-picked by me for your benefit. When you give a generous donation this month, I’d like to send you this special gift as my way of saying thank you for partnering with us and helping us continue to explore and proclaim the depths of Scripture.\n\nYou have a FORMIDABLE FOE-it’s time to launch an effective counterattack\n\nEnvy. It’s insidious. Pervasive. Corrosive. In the age of materialism and social media, it’s difficult not to feel the creep of this increasing and ever-present temptation. Pastor and teacher Mike Fabarez diagnoses the problem of this pervasive sin. He brings the reader to biblical stories with often-overlooked ties to envy that expose and demonstrate the seriousness and harm caused by our unexamined motives. When envy is allowed to reside unchecked in our hearts, there are internal, relational, and societal costs—Envy explores all of these.\n\nBut we are not left to despair. Instead, we are invited to know a kind and gracious Father who calls us to identify and assault this enemy. We can live with satisfaction and contentment. This book explores biblical ways to shore up our hearts and minds and close the gaps that leave us vulnerable to envy’s temptations. By understanding life in the body of Christ, readers learn to truly rejoice with those who rejoice. And we leave with a deeper capacity for grace and selfless love. With a pastoral heart, Fabarez reassures Christians of a divine hope and promise of an eternal kingdom where hearts are content, and joy is full."
