(Short Wave Info 2023)\n\nAbove:- Map showing the location of Lebanon, USA. Map c/o Google Maps.\n\nThe overall reception of WTWW was good. The signal strength was good and there was only slight fading of the signal. There was no interference from other stations on the frequency or on adjacent frequencies.\n\nThere were some static crashes on the band, but as the signal was so good, they did not significantly impact on listening pleasure.\n\nAbove:-Image c/o https://map.blitzortung.org/\n\nBelow is a short video showing my reception of WTWW.\n\nReferences."
