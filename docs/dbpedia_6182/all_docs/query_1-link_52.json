        "text": "The Bible has much to say about Jesus being Lord and Savior! Here are the biblical definitions of Lord and Savior and a few Scriptures to back up those definitions.\n\nSavior (Greek-Soter) means savior, deliverer, preserver.\n\nSavior: “And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world” (1 John 4:14). As Savior, Jesus is the only One Who can save us!\n\nDeliverer: “Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins” (Acts 5:31). As Savior, Jesus is the only One Who can deliver us from sin!\n\nPreserver: “For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ” (Philippians 3:20). As Savior, Jesus is the only One to preserve for us a home with Him in Heaven!\n\nLord (Greek-Kyrios) means master, one to whom someone belongs.\n\n“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). Because of our sin, the only way we can have peace with God is to accept Jesus’ gift of salvation and recognize Jesus as Lord of our lives.\n\n“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord” (Romans 6:23). Only by making Jesus Lord of our lives can we receive the free gift of eternal life with Him in Heaven!\n\n“And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:11). Regardless of how we feel or believe, only Jesus is Lord! We can either choose to acknowledge that now and spend eternity with Him or be forced to acknowledge it later and spend eternity without Him. Either way, JESUS IS SAVIOR and JESUS IS LORD!"
