We must remember that God will provide for us. He is the perfect Father. He loves and forgives His people. Our relationship with God is based on what Christ has done for us.\n\nAs we hear faithful biblical teaching, we’re continually transformed by the renewal of our minds. The Well is here to provide Christ-centered encouragement.\n\nAll day. Every day. Whether at home or on-the-go."
