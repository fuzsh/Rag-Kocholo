This difficult decision was made after tremendous prayer and multiple meetings with Dr. Evans and the church elders. The elder board is obligated to govern the church in accordance with the scriptures. Dr. Evans and the elders agree that when any elder or pastor falls short of the high standards of scripture, the elders are responsible for providing accountability and maintaining integrity in the church.\n\nWe serve a God that is merciful to forgive and gracious to restore. In the days ahead, Pastor Bobby Gibson and the elders will provide more information regarding interim leadership and the next steps for the future of our church.\n\nLatest Worship Services\n\nThe Love of God\n\nRewatch our latest service featuring dynamic worship and biblical teaching. Join us in person each Sunday at 8:00 am or 11:00 am, or online at 11:00 am."
