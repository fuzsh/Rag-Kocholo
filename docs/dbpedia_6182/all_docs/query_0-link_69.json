        "text": "What are you thinking about and why does it matter? Our thoughts have the power to shape the way we perceive ourselves and influence how we interact with others. Throughout the Bible, we see verse after verse reminding us of the importance of our thoughts and why we need to allow the Holy Spirit to renew our minds.\n\nRomans 12:2\n\n\"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—His good, pleasing and perfect will.\" (NIV)\n\n2 Corinthians 10:5\n\n\"We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.\" (NIV)\n\nPsalm 1:2\n\n\"Instead, they find happiness in the Teaching of the Lord, and they think about it day and night.\" (CEV)\n\nProverbs 4:23\n\n\"Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.\" (NLT)\n\nPhilippians 4:8\n\n\"Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.\" (ESV)\n\nWhen negativity or doubt try to take up space in our minds—we must counter those thoughts with God’s Word and speak His truth to every lie. Our Heavenly Father declares that we are seen, we are loved, and we are forgiven. The key to finding true freedom and walking in our purpose is to renew our minds with God’s Word!\n\n1 Peter 2:9\n\n\"...for you are a chosen people. You are royal priests, a holy nation, God’s very own possession. As a result, you can show others the goodness of God, for He called you out of the darkness into His wonderful light.\" (NLT)\n\nPsalm 139:13\n\n\"You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s womb.\" (NLT)\n\nZephaniah 3:17\n\n\"For the Lord your God is living among you. He is a mighty Savior. He will take delight in you with gladness. With His love, He will calm all your fears. He will rejoice over you with joyful songs.” (NLT)\n\n1 John 3:1a\n\n\"See how very much our Father loves us, for He calls us His children, and that is what we are!\" (NLT)\n\nEphesians 1:7\n\n\"He is so rich in kindness and grace that He purchased our freedom with the blood of His Son and forgave our sins.\" (NLT)\n\nWe will no longer be held back by old ways of thinking. It’s time to walk forward in VICTORY. If you want to go deeper on this topic, we encourage you to watch these conversations with Lisa Harper, Dr. DeeDee Freeman, Alex Seeley, Robyn Wilkerson, and Donna Pisani."
