        "text": "Hour 1: Hope Unbroken\n\nIn the spiritually oppressive atmosphere of the Middle East, God still is moving and working in and through the lives of the faithful in the underground churches. On In The Market with Janet Parshall this week we heard the amazing stories of how God is using women in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and other locations to share the eternal hope of the Gospel message throughout the Muslim world. We shared the wisdom of a Fortune 100 company president who explained how our relationship with God and the proper implementing of our spiritual gifts can help us build a successful and rewarding career with purpose. The leader of a powerful recovery ministry uses his own life story of recovery from alcohol addiction to teach us what it looks like to lean on God to find healing and restoration from many types of addictive struggles that people face. He explained how to find real freedom and healing from these battles. The federal government has compromised the protections of Title IX but not every state has signed off of this large scale corruption of these legal protections. Our mother and daughter team dug deep into the new rules and which states have refused to go along with these changes. Once again it is time to turn a critical eye on the news headlines of the week.\n\nHour 2: Faith Unbowed\n\nWhat do you do when it seems like there is no hope for your marriage? On In The Market with Janet Parshall this week we shared the insights of former divorce attorney who says that working through the struggles is not only possible but a better option that ending the marriage. She offered practical, proven guidance for handling the difficult conversation and emotions in order to create opportunities for real forgiveness and healing. In the shadow of the death of George Floyd and the racial unrest that it birthed across the nation, a dangerous acceptance of Critical Race Theory has grown. Our guest explained the poisonous roots of CRT and how it has infiltrated churches and institutes of higher education. A former Planned Parenthood doctor shared her powerful story of transformation from acceptance of abortion to standing up against that horrific practice. She revealed some of the hidden truths that abortion providers do not want the public to know. Homelessness is a problem in America today in ways and volume like it has never been before. Our guest explained what leads people into homelessness and how to offer real help those who need it most. From unrest in the Middle East to uncertainty in our own nation these are very trying times. But our favorite husband and wife team continues to teach us how to apply Godâ€™s wisdom to better understand the news of the week."
