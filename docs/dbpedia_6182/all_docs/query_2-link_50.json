        "text": "The premier source of international shortwave broadcast schedules.\n\nThis site is intended for radio enthusiasts, DXers or anybody with a shortwave radio to help identify shortwave signals or to view general broadcast schedules.\n\nShortwave Schedules can be based on:\n\nEiBi Database (A-24, 08/13/2024) courtesy of www.eibispace.de AOKI Database (A-24, 08/15/2024) courtesy of www1.s2.starcat.ne.jp/ndxc HFCC Database (A-24, 08/12/2024) courtesy of www.hfcc.org\n\nEnter a frequency in kHz or MHz in Quick Search™ located in the menu bar and all results within ± 2.5 KHz (± 0.002.5 MHz) being broadcast at the time of the search will be returned. The Quick Search™ is limited to frequencies above 2300 kHz (2.300 MHz).\n\nSome unique search features are that Shortwave Schedules can be filtered simultaneously by a variety of methods, such as language, station country of origin, and frequency band. Results can be displayed in your local time zone if you choose. Results can also be limited to what is currently being broadcast at the time of the search. If a latitude/longitude in decimal degrees is provided, the distance from known transmitter sites will be calculated. Known transmitter sites can also be viewed in Google Maps. A full description of the various search capabilities can be found on the About page.\n\nIn order to make the databases as uniform as posible such as station name, language, transmitter, each database was modified from its original form and assumptions were made, so errors could have been introduced as well. Therefore, it may be worth it to check the original databases for logging purposes.\n\nEiBi is the most comphrensive database. In addition to broadcast stations, the EiBi database also includes utility stations such as aircraft becans, weather fax, maritime broadcasts, etc.\n\nAOKI is another comphrensive database focusing on broadcast stations (excluding utility stations) and may include stations not found in the other databases. Worth checking if a siginal cannot not identified by other databases. The AOKI database also includes program titles and broadcast times for some shortwave stations which can be useful for finding a specific show.\n\nHFCC includes member broadcasters which coordinate to avoid interference with each other, however, there many other organizations that are not members. HFCC is orginaized by broadcast owners and does not distinguesh invidual outlets, for example, the United States Agency for Global Media includes Voice of America, Radio Free Asia, Radio Liberty, and Radio Sawa.\n\nAll three databases provide an essential service to shortwave radio listeners around the world. The time and effort the maintainers put into their databases and making them available to the public is appreciated by all."
