        "text": "About Holy Scriptures and Israel\n\nIn 1984, brothers John Van Stormbroek, Alfred Bouter and Gideon Levytam formed by God’s grace a ministry called The Holy Scriptures and Israel Bible Society of Canada. The purpose of the ministry was to reach our Jewish people with a copy of the Hebrew Scriptures. The Old Testament (The Tenach - התנ”ך) and the New Testament (The Brit Ha-Hadasha - הברית החדשה). Over the years, we've had the privilege of providing many copies of God's Word to the Jewish communities across Canada.\n\nAs time passed by, the Lord Yeshua took dear brother John Van Stormbroek to himself. The ministry of Holy Scriptures and Israel continued with additional development. In the early 1990’s, a weekly morning Bible class began which brother Gideon Levytam led regularly in the City of Toronto. This weekly open Bible class was held in the Willowdale assembly meeting hall. Eventually, a second mid-week evening Bible class was added. In April 2002, the need for an additional outreach Bible teaching meeting arose. We begun a Saturday (Shabbat) ministry meeting in which a systematic teaching of God’s word is presented to all who attend. Together we learn God’s Word, pray for each need and the salvation of Israel, and sing songs of worship unto our God, praising Him and our Lord Yeshua the Messiah.\n\nIn Mid 2004 we started to air on Joy 1250 Radio station (http://www.joy1250.ca/) a 15 minute Bible teaching program called \"The Holy Scriptures and Israel\" with Gideon Levytam. The broadcast teaches God’s word from a Hebrew Messianic perspective and has proved to be a blessing to many. It's now aired seven days a week. Our prayer is that many more of our Israeli people will have a clear understanding of who Yeshua is, why we all need him, and come to know him as their Lord and Messiah.\n\n\"For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.\" Isaiah 62:1\n\nיְשַׁעְיָהוּ 1:62: לְמַעַן צִיּוֹן לֹא אֶחֱשֶׁה וּלְמַעַן יְרוּשָׁלַםִ לֹא אֶשְׁקוֹט עַד־יֵצֵא כַנֹּגַהּ צִדְקָהּ וִישׁוּעָתָהּ כְּלַפִּיד יִבְעָר׃\n\nOur Statement of Faith\n\nWe believe in one God who is Eternal. The Godhead is composed of the Tri-unity consisting of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. In Hebrew: Abba, Ben, Ruach Ha-Kodesh (Deuteronomy 6:4; Psalm 90:2; Matthew 28:19-20).\n\nWe believe that the entire word of God, the Bible, consisting of the 66 books: 39 of the Old Testment, the Tanach, and 27 of the New Testament, the Brit Ha-Chadasha, it is the inspired Word of God, inerrant in all that it states, and it is the authority in all matters of Christian faith and practice (Psalm 119:160; Proverbs 30:5; John 17:17).\n\nWe believe in the eternal Sonship of the Lord Yeshua - Jesus the Messiah, His birth of the Virgin Miriam, and His perfect and impeccable Manhood; (Isaiah 7:14. 9:6; Matthew 1:20-21; John 1:1-2,14).\n\nWe believe that when the Lord Yeshua - Jesus the Messiah died on the cross, that it was for our sin, and that through His atoning sacrifice all that accept Him as their personal Saviour have eternal life; that there is no other way for salvation, and that all who reject Him as their vicarious Saviour are eternally lost; (Psalm 22; Isaiah 53; Matthew 27:46-51; Hebrews 10:1-14; Revelation 1:5; 5:6-9).\n\nWe believe in the convicting, regenerating, and guiding power of the Holy Spirit, Ruach Ha-Kodesh. (Genesis 1:1-2; Numbers 11:16-17; John 14:16-18; 15:26; 16:7-12).\n\nWe believe in the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus the Messiah. We also believe in the bodily future resurrection of every believer at His coming for His own redeemed people. (Psalm 16:10; Isaiah 53:10; Matthew 28:1-6; 1 Corinthians 15:3-8).\n\nWe believe in the imminent and pre-millennial coming of the Lord Jesus- Yeshua the Messiah for His Church, and in His personal and visible return to the earth to restore His people Israel and set up His Messianic Kingdom; (1 Corinthians 15:51-58; 1 Thessalonians 5:13-18; Matthew 24:29-31; Jeremiah 30:3; Ezekiel 37:1-14; Daniel 7:13-14).\n\nWe believe that every true believer today is a member of the true Church, the body of Messiah, and that all believers should gather together only as members of His body unto the Name of the Lord Jesus christ, Yeshua the Messiah, in separation from all that is not according to the Word of God, as we seek to honour Him. (1 Corinthians 12:12-13; Ephesians 4:4; Matthew 18:20)."
