        "text": "Music and the Spoken Word\n\nThe choir is a place to be surrounded by people that love music, perform for audiences across the world and be a missionary by spreading the gospel through music. If this sounds like you, please consider applying for the choir by reading more here.\n\nMusic and the Spoken Word\n\nWe don’t have to see the light to believe it is there. That’s what faith is—to hope for things that are not seen but that are true. Our hope and faith, if they are to have any depth or meaning, must rest on something greater than ourselves. To produce renewal and rescue from the heartaches of life, faith and hope need to be centered in Jesus Christ.\n\nConcerts & Events\n\nFrom a bilingual grammy winner and lauded Mexican performer to the glee clubs of Morehouse and Spelman Colleges, the guest artists performing with The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square on its “Hope” tour bring diversity and harmony.\n\nThere is more than one way to connect with the Choir, especially with so many amazing things going on. Check out some of the most exciting highlights below and be sure to check back often for updates."
