        "text": "About Morse code\n\nThe code requirement was WORK and took practice over time.\n\nWhen one had to work at anything, what ever it was gave value to the endeavor. FREE things have no value. So the removal of the code requirement demished the the value of the ham radio license.\n\nIn addition, Other aspects of the licensing requirements were relegated to \"volunteers\", rather than the FCC it's self. Unpaid volunteers had no incentive to require excellence, only numbers of licenses granted. Work ethic was not required. Free was advertised with friends and neighbors. Free equals no value.\n\nAmplitude Modulation has been proven over time to be poor use of spectrum available, Single Side Band was found to be better use of spectrum but still AM at half the band width. Double side band amplitude modulation resulted in better fidelity but again used more spectrum.\n\nFrequency modulation allowed for better fidelity but still used more spectrum.\n\nAm transmitters are cheaper to build as are receivers but require more wattage.\n\nAll of the above are old technology. Newer digital equipment and solid state encoders and decoders allow for one on one communication without the need for modulation at all.\n\nBringing us back to Morse code which was a two bit code.\n\nJust carrier on and off pulses. Instead of short and long bits, 5 bit code was introduced which allowed for teletype and mechanical sending and receiving of text messages, still later 8 bit code was introduced and further 16 bit and onward to 32, 64 and 128 bit code and so on. Still code but far beyond the ability of the human ear and brain to decode.\n\nSo- the bottom line is this, Lets keep all of the older knowledge and skills. When a solar flare renders our sat coms un-usable The old stuff will still work. In the mean time, back yard tinkers with find \"the hobby\" fulfilling and a source of personal pride and in a pinch, an asset to our whole nation and the world. It may never come and maybe tonight.\n\nAgree about the morse code requirement going away.\n\nI have often thought if the FCC brought back the old Novice license along with the code requirement it would ignite a spark in some of the younger generation. Too many of us old guys now and not many young people.\n\nGot my license in 1962 KN3RHB and let it expire. Got back into ham radio a couple years ago and use it for fun while camping (KI6Y). Great hobby.\n\nMany of my friends, when I was growing up, became HAM's. They went on to electronics trades schools and got good jobs as engineers at Radio & TV Stations and were always inviting me to field days where they were showing me the stuff they picked up in Dayton Ohio at the annual HAM fest there. Somehow I got the bug for Short Wave listening when one of them showed me a receiver he had picked up and I listened to the thing all night at one of the field days. The broadcast reminded me of NPR and I was amazed by it and what I could learn from it while they talked with all the other people of the world about their rigs, antenna's etc. (and engaged in trading QSL cards) Somehow Short Wave listening was more intriguing for me HAM. To each his own I guess.\n\nFor a few bucks anyone can pick up a simple receiver (analog or digital tuned) and begin to learn to use it. You can of course use the Internet and many of the sites that provide virtual SW Receivers. But for a few bucks you can pick up one of these.\n\nShort Wave programming usually comes alive in the later evening and in the late night on into the mid morning.\n\nA young woman from my home town has written this book for beginners. She's quite a writer. Public Libraries often have books which will help a newbie get started in this. I've always seen Short Wave as another dimension of Amateur Radio.\n\nShort Wave Listening for Beginners Anita Louise McCormick\n\nI had a radio similar to that one years ago...if it's like the one I had, it will have a couple of wire clips on the back, one for ground (not really needed) and one that is made for a wire antenna.\n\nIf it has those clips (take a picture of the back if you are not sure) you should be able to pull in some shortwave stations, especially at night, with a piece of wire, around 15 or 20 feet long if you can hang the end up on a tree or post or anything handy.\n\nLots of nighttime shortwave stations can be found from about 4 mhz to around 10 mhz."
