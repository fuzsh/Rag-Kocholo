        "text": "The link between ministry and technology is not immediately obvious. In fact, it can be easy to question whether technology has any place in the church at all.\n\nStill, as ministries around the country continue to incorporate various modes of technology into their day-to-day operations, it becomes paramount to examine God’s Word on the subject.\n\nBelow are four Bible verses that encourage techology in ministry.\n\nLuke 8:1-11\n\nSowing seeds on as much soil as possible\n\nThis passage explains the parable of the sower. Sowers do not limit themselves to certain soils; instead, they spread seeds everywhere, including rocks, thorns, or other soils thought to be less fertile. For, though uncommon, sometimes these seeds are able to flourish into something beautiful.\n\nAs Christians, we are expected to do the same. We should not be selective in whom we extend ourselves to, but rather aim to spread Christ’s message to as many people as possible. Technology lets us connect with a bigger audience than ever before.\n\nRomans 10:14-15\n\nHow beautiful are the feet of those who carry good news\n\nIn Biblical times, the only way to “carry” good news was to bring it physically, walking from one place to another. Technological advances, however, have opened up numerous additional communication channels, all of which we can use to amplify the rate at which we spread the Word.\n\nMatthew 28:16-20\n\nGreat Commission: Go make disciples of all nations\n\nJesus tells us to go out and make disciples of all nations – to spread the Word to people wherever they are. These days, people spend an increasing amount of time on their laptops, tablets and iphones. Should we not use the technology available to us and meet them there? We are called to extend the message to people wherever they are, and technology allows us to do exactly that.\n\n1 Corinthians 12:21\n\nThe eye cannot say to the hand, “I don't need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don't need you!”\n\nEvery member of your congregation is blessed with a different set of skills and talents – embracing all of them is essential to building a strong community.\n\nWhile you may excel in teaching or shepherding, others may find their strengths in technology. God bestowed each person with these gifts for a reason. Create an environment that encourages people to take advantage of their skillsets and use them in ways that glorify Him.\n\nWe live in a world that is constantly evolving and adapting. Emerging technologies need not contradict our beliefs; instead, they can actually help us spread God’s word. When we look to scripture for guidance, we learn that leveraging new advancements can fit in perfectly with what we are setting out to do – to reach more lives.\n\nRecommended Reading:"
