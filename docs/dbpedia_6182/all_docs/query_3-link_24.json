        "text": "WTWW (The Voice of Freedom): April 25, 2022\n\nMany thanks to SRAA contributor, Bryce Belcher, who shares the following recording and notes:\n\nBroadcaster: WTWW “The Voice of Freedom”\n\nDate of recording: 4/25/2022\n\nStarting time: 23:13 UTC\n\nFrequency: 5.085 MHz\n\nReception location: Columbus Ohio\n\nReceiver and antenna: My Tecsun PL880 with just the telescopic antenna\n\nNotes: My recording of WTWW, the voice of freedom on 5085 MHz from April 25, 2022. The reception was pretty good here in Columbus in this recording. With just the telescopic antenna the station comes in pretty good.\n\nWTWW (2018 ARRL Field Day Live): June 23, 2018\n\nMany thanks to SRAA contributor, Bill Hemphill, for the following recording and notes:\n\nI recorded the first two hours of the WTWW Field Day live broadcast off the air on 9930 kHz. I edited the audio file to remove most of the music. This shortened the audio file to about 80 minutes in length. Reception was on a Tecsun S-8800 with indoor wire antenna at my home in Smithville, NJ (5 miles north of Atlantic City).\n\nThe Shortwave Radio Audio Archive\n\nThe Shortwave Radio Audio Archive (SRAA) is a collection of shortwave radio recordings that you can download or listen to as a podcast.
