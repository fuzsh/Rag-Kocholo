        "text": "God is good. But what does that mean—that God is good?\n\nThe more I studied this word in the Bible, the more one central concept seemed to jump out: God’s goodness conveys His generosity. His goodness means far more than His generosity, but it certainly includes His infinitely generous attitude toward us. By nature, He longs to bring joy and blessing to all His creatures.\n\nThe Bible repeatedly presents goodness as a core quality of our Lord, and I wanted to share just 23 of those occasions. These 23 verses point you to the goodness of our God and what it means for our lives.\n\nThe Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth. Exodus 34:6\n\nOh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. 1 Chronicles 16:34\n\nAnd they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the Lord: “For He is good, for His mercy endures forever toward Israel.” Ezra 3:11\n\nGood and upright is the Lord. Psalm 25:8\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Psalm 23:6\n\nThe Lord is good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His works. Psalm 145:9\n\nNo one is good but One, that is, God. Mark 10:18\n\nEvery good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning. James 1:17\n\nIf you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! Matthew 7:11\n\nI would have lost heart, unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Psalm 27:13\n\nI will meditate on the glorious splendor of Your majesty, and on Your wondrous works. Men shall speak of the might of Your awesome acts, and I will declare Your greatness. They shall utter the memory of Your great goodness, and shall sing of Your righteousness. Psalm 145:5-7\n\nHe loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. Psalm 33:5\n\nOh, taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who trusts in Him! Psalm 34:8\n\nBe thankful to Him, and bless His name. For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting. Psalm 100:4-5\n\nOh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men! For He satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with goodness. Psalm 107:8-9\n\nAs a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear Him. For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust. Psalm 103:13-14\n\nTeach me to do Your will, for You are my God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness. Psalm 143:10\n\nThe Lord is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him. Psalm 92:15\n\nYou are good, and do good; teach me Your statutes. Psalm 119:68\n\nYou also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold Your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst. Nehemiah 9:20\n\nHear me, O Lord, for Your lovingkindness is good; turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies. Psalm 69:16\n\nThe Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knows those who trust in Him. Nahum 1:7\n\nOh, how great is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those who fear You, which You have prepared for those who trust in You in the presence of the sons of men! You shall hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the plots of man; You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. Psalm 31:19-20"
