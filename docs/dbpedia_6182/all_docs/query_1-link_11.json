        "text": "Answer\n\nDue to our ministryâs nature (providing Bible answers), we are frequently asked if we are affiliated with the âBible Answer Manâ broadcast, hosted by Hank Hanegraaff of the Christian Research Institute (CRI). The answer to the question is no, we are in no sense affiliated or connected with the âBible Answer Manâ broadcast, Hank Hanegraaff, or CRI. The official website of Hank Hanegraaff, CRI, and the âBible Answer Manâ broadcast is http://www.equip.org.\n\nOverall, we find the Christian Research Institute to be an excellent organization that provides a much needed service to the Body of Christ. While we do not agree with Hank Hanegraaff and CRI on every issue, we agree with them far more often than we disagree. We find CRIâs counter-cult and apologetics material to be immensely valuable. The âBible Answer Manâsâ frequent coverage of the false doctrines and abuses of the Word-Faith / Prosperity movement is crucially needed.\n\nOne significant area of disagreement we have with the Bible Answer Man is over the interpretation of end times Bible prophecy. Hank Hanegraaff takes a viewpoint somewhat similar to âpartial preterism,â although Hanegraaff uses the phrase âexegetical eschatologyâ to describe his viewpoint. GotQuestions.org has a premillennial and dispensational interpretation of the end times.\n\nOverall, the âBible Answer Manâ broadcast is well worth listening to, and we encourage you to read Hank Hanegraaffâs books. As with any Bible teacher, including the writers here at GotQuestions.org, always compare what is taught with Scripture. Allow teachers such as the âBible Answer Manâ to provide you with guidance and information, but always go back to the Word of God as your ultimate authority.\n\nUpdate: On April 9, 2017, Hank Hanegraaff announced his conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy, specifically the Greek Orthodox Church. While we do not doubt the genuineness of his faith, we strongly disagree with Hanegraaffâs assertions that the Evangelical and Orthodox versions of Christianity are compatible and the differences minimal."
