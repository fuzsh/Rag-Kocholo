Bug Tracking Across Multiple Code Streams?

Eric Lennon Bowman writes "I've been using Bugzilla for a few years, and it has one particular shortcoming that is motivating me to look for alternatives. We very often find that a bug or feature requires changes to be integrated into several code branches, and there just isn't an elegant way (that I can see) to get Bugzilla to do that, short of creating a bunch of bugs, and linking them together as dependents (which is a bit inelegant, and error prone). I'd love the opinions of the Slashdot community on ways to deal with this problem, since it seems pretty widespread: How do you track the same bug across multiple versions of a product?"
