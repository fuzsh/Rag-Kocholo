        "text": "The software development for my brushless drill reverse engineering project continues. I was able to dump the factory binary from the STM32 MCU which would allow me to quickly test my replicated PCB design. But I want to develop my own firmware so that I can have full control and learn along the way. I have been looking into the comprehensive libraries provided by STM for motor control applications. The development infrastructure is quiet comprehensive but a little daunting for a relatively inexperienced firmware developer like myself. But this project is mostly about the learning so I am poking into the example code and trying to use it to get my motor running. After some time, I was able to get the motor running. Still long way to go for a complete firmware with all the controls and safety mechanisms in place but I am making progress. If you have any STM32 programming guides that you think could help me, please do share. #electronics #stm32 #bldc #reverseengineering\n\nI am in need of some help. I am working on diagnosing a problem on one of the brushless power tools that is not working as expected. The issue is that the rotor doesn't start when its in certain angular positions. The first image shows a scope shot of a successful start where the first part is start up step followed by 6 step trap commutation once hall sensors change states. The second scope shot is of the same setup for a different starting position. It can be seen that the start up step is not as powerful to kick start the motor and hence the controller gives up when it doesn't receive the hall sensor feedback. When the motor does start up, it runs perfectly so it cant be the FETs or hall sensors. I also swapped the controller chip with a new one and had no change. I also tried replacing the hall sensors to no effect. I am out of ideas of what the root cause could be and would appreciate any help. EDIT: The \"no start\" only happens when the encoders are High-Low-Low or High-High-Low. Any other combination makes the motor run perfectly but these combinations leads to \"no start\". This is repeatable. #electronics #helpneeded #repair #bldc #esc #stmicroelectronics\n\nThe reverse engineering on the brushless drill ESC continues. I purchased a few more faulty units in hopes that one of them will have a working controller that I can read from. To my delight, I was able to successfully read and write to the flash. Unfortunately but as expected, the flash is encrypted so I can't use it to decode the firmware structure but I can use it to program blank chips to match the factory firmware. This will allow me to have a bench mark to compare to. Another positive development was that I was able to successfully transplant a controller from one unit which had some other fault to a another unit which had a bad chip. My reverse engineered schematic helped me to test various sections to narrow down the fault. I will continue to work on replicating the PCB and exploring custom firmware for it especially now that I already have some working units that I can program. #electronics #bldc #esc #reverseengineering\n\nRecently I bought some damaged brushless power tools from eBay in hopes that I can fix them or at least learn in the process. I was also interested to learn more about the fascinating world of brushless motor control. I was able to partially recover a couple of them but this one seemed to have a dead SoC with blown components on the PCB. So the only option was to completely reverse engineer the controller and try to replicate it. It has been a very fun journey to reverse engineer every part of the circuit and try to understand the designers intent for each and every component. I have successfully replicated the schematic and now will be moving on to the PCB layout. I think the hardest part of the process would be to program the microcontroller. My goal is to implement 6 step commutation and extract maximum performance from the drill. Then I will put it head to head with a working original unit and see if I can beat its performance. #electronics #brushless #bldc #stm32 #tti"
