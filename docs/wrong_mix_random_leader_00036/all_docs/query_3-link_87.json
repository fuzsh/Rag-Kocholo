Also, the myriad, disparate systems such as HVAC, Lighting, security, etc. that form the crux of a smart commercial building have ushered in the need for integration and effective utilization of resources. Use of IoT and cloud-based applications makes it possible to achieve these two objectives – making buildings energy efficient, comfortable, automated and truly smart. The Visionary Founder ith buildings consuming 40% of the world’s energy, there is a need for energy productivity (social), reduced energy usage (environment) and increased profit (economic). The young trailblazer Deepinder Singh founded 75F in 2012, after he had designed some of the world’s fastest core networks for Tier 1 service providers like AT& T, NTT and Verizon. As Deepinder Singh, CEO and Founder, 75F puts it, “I am not originally from the HVAC industry. By profession, I was a networking geek, have been part of 6 startups, and brought a host of embedded products to market. My key goal in every endeavor is to simplify operational complexity and make products instinctive.” A Voyage from Concept to Company When asked about the genesis of the company, Deepinder reminisces, “When my daughter was one year old, she would wake up in the middle of the night crying. It was then that I found out that the thermostat was in the master bedroom but in her east-facing room, the temperature was nearly 8-10 degrees cooler than in the master bedroom. In the dead of winter, when temperatures in Minnesota are nearly - 30 Degrees Celsius, it was no surprise that my one year old would wake up due to the discomfort. So, I did what any self-respecting engineer would do. I quit my job and set out to find a solution to fix this problem. I soon built the algorithms that would consider the temperature from different parts of the building, understand how the sun would impact these temperatures (solar gain) and calculate what’s called ‘thermal loads’” Legacy building controls systems are overbuilt and expensive for most commercial building owners and operators. Those systems are being displaced by new, born-digital solutions. Fueled by the proliferation of affordable sensors and cloud computing, this new breed of building intelligence solutions combines the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless communications, big data and cloud- based algorithms to sense, predict and proactively manage the needs of the building occupants. Deepinder’s determination to create intuitive technology, make an impact and challenge the status quo forms the ethos of 75F. Which is why 75F is the only brand today, that can effectively address the energy, air quality and comfort issues of more 99,000 commercial buildings in India and 15,000,000 worldwide. 75F is also the only player to offer a predictive solution for solving the comfort and energy challenges of the commercial building market, at an installed price point that offers sub year return on investment. The solution takes in hundreds of data points like weather forecast, building orientation, sun positioning, humidity, air quality and mean radiant temperature. 75F delivers a balanced space, better air quality, significant energy savings and predictive maintenance – all contributing to increased employee A leading player in this segment is 75F, an award-winning, IoT and Machine Learning company taking a fresh approach to HVAC, indoor air quality, lighting and controls in commercial buildings. 75F offers data-driven, proactive, predictive building intelligence and controls. 75F has delivered hundreds of energy-efficient, comfortable and healthy spaces to enthusiastic customers who rave about the results. While a personal experience is what inspired the inception of 75F, Deepinder realized that the problem is applicable to a whole lot of buildings and wanted to make sure that everyone has access to equitable, comfortable temperatures. The true motivation behind the company were the studies by Carnegie Mellon and Harvard which prove beyond doubt that people who work in comfortable environments are at least a 101% more productive JUNE 2018 16 ™\n\nInterview With Insights Success “ The people in an organization are its most important asset.

The 75F solution ensures improved employee productivity and health, thus enhancing Occupant Experience. A true win-win for all their customers! pioneering and disruptive technology. 75F India was awarded the ‘Hot 100 Race to Grace 2017’ award and had been listed as one of the Top 50 SMEs by ASSOCHAM in India. Committed to innovation, the company is well poised to revolutionize the way energy efficiency and comfort is managed in the future. Contributing to the IoT Sector 75F operates in the true confluence of Cloud Computing and IoT. As Deepinder points out, what is really driving the advances in 75F is ‘ubiquitiveness’ of IoT i.e. the pervasiveness of IoT and the Cloud Computing power. Using sensors spread across in a building 75F collects millions of data points from each building. The ability to process this data rests in the cloud where the data is analyzed to draw intelligent insights. This enables 75F to be able to proactively predict how the building is going to behave in conjunction with factors such as weather forecasts, angle of the sun, etc. and determine the optimal control strategy in advance. Innovative Solutions by an Intuitive Company Two of 75F’s biggest solutions in the Indian market are “Dynamic Airflow Balancing™ Solution” and “Dynamic Chilled Water Balancing™ Solution”. Leveraging IoT design philosophy and the power of cloud computing, the 75F solutions has achieved what was once thought to be only theoretically possible; continuous commissioning or perfect air balancing. The company also offers Lighting Automation and Control, Outdoor Air Optimization, and Indoor Air Quality Management solutions which adopt the smart building trends while taking IoT to the next level. Through IoT, 75F is enabling a smart building concept which mainly focusses on providing a cost-effective and an advanced environment. 75F global has also been conferred with the title of ‘Titans of Technology- 2016’ and won the ‘People’s Choice Award’ at CleanTech Open 2014 and the Eureka awards 2016. They were the Presenters at the 2014 Google Demo Day. 75F also scored big at the Regional Entrepreneurial competition and the Minnesota Cup in 2014 apart from winning $100K cash recognition from AOL’s founder Steve Case. Contributing to a Sustainable Ecosystem for Future Generations Deepinder further adds, “There are three aspects of the indoor environment that truly impact an employee’s ability to perform: Thermal Comfort, Indoor Air Quality and Lighting. Harnessing the power of IOT and Cloud Computing, 75F is uniquely able to control and optimally adjust each of these three aspects ensuring maximum occupant experience always, while saving energy.” The 75F name stands for 75 degrees Fahrenheit. It was inspired by a United Nations resolution in 2008 to change the temperature in their global office meeting rooms to 75 degrees from 70 degrees in the cooling season (with the process reversed in the heating season), as a sustainable energy-savings measure that came with corresponding relaxed dress codes. Another highlight of 75F’s products is Facilisight, a futuristic energy management tool with a dynamic UI. Fascilight’s suite of web and mobile apps allow customers to manage temperature and lighting remotely and round the clock. It is an extremely user-friendly interface that has simplified the process of overseeing and managing 75F systems across sites irrespective of geographic location or complexity. It is compatible with iPhone, iPad and Android phones. Focusing on (OE) 2 75F is a member of the United Nations Environment Program-Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative (UNEP-SBCI), an international platform for stakeholders to jointly carry out activities supporting sustainable development. In India, it has partnered with India Green Buildings Council (IGBC) and Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE). 75F delivers improved Operational Efficiency and enhanced Occupant Experience to its clients, or as they call 2 it internally - (OE) . 75F’s unique approach significantly reduces energy consumption and optimizes facility management thereby improving Operational Efficiency. Using the right algorithms, the system saves nearly 30-40% on energy, typically paying for itself in less than 3 years.

What is a Data Center? all the information of the data center and gives updates of each and every activity. Person responsible in a NOC is able to see visualizations of network which are being monitored and can be managed. A certain premise where an entire organization’s IT operations and equipment are centralized and, where it stores, analyzes and distributes large amounts of data is known as a Data Center (DC). Earlier, the data processing needs were not too high but now-a-days those needs have grown exponentially. Data centers are now essential for daily operations and are important for business continuity. They are reliable to store enormous amounts because of their avant-garde security levels that keep the organization’s data safe at all times. The DC site, which is also known as a Server Farm, is connected to a communication network so that information can be accessed easily and remotely. There are thousands of very small powerful servers running in a data center which can be harboured in a room, a floor or an entire building. Maintenance of a Data Center Regular maintenance of the data center ensures optimum reliability by taking precautionary steps to reduce downtime and avoidable failures. Let’s take a look at these 3 steps which will help you maintain your data center in the most effective way: Safety Measures You need to have security protocols in place in order to have a secure data center. You need to first figure out the vulnerabilities in your DC premises. Multi-factor ID authentication, surveillance throughout the facility, metal detectors and biometric systems are some of the steps which can be taken to have top level security. Safety First There are numerous problems in a data center which can affect the life and health of the technicians working in it. Technicians should make sure their safety and health is not compromised while working on maintenance tasks and they should be trained before working in such scenarios. Physical Security Organizations do employ security guards to protect their data centers 24/7. These guards protect the inside and outside of the data center for enhanced security. Mantraps are generally used for access control. On- site security guards are an essential part of a data center. Some organizations allow these professional guards to carry firearms for higher security. Power Maintenance Performing maintenance on regular intervals on UPS and batteries reduces the chances of failure whenever there is a power outage. Preventive maintenance will decrease the chances of failures and reduce the amount of energy consumed. Important components of a Data Center Power Power is unarguably the most important factor in a data center. Within the data center, the Colocation equipment and web hosting servers run on a dedicated power source. Every data center needs power backups to make sure their servers are always up and overall service uptime is received. Get a Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) CMMS is a best way to track, measure and improve your maintenance schedule. This software lets the facility manager to track the status of maintenance work for their assets and costs associated with the work in the system. This software will help drive down cost of maintenance and will increase productivity from within. Redundancy & Reliability High availability in a data center refers to the components which are continuously working. Systems are maintained from time to time to ensure smooth operations in the future. You can create a failover where you create server and they switch responsibilities to a remote server to have higher levels of redundancy. Cooling Cooling is just as important as power in a data center. The colocation equipment and web hosting servers need proper cooling so that they don’t heat up and continue to function smoothly. A data center should be designed in such a way where there is proper ventilation and the systems are kept cool at all times. Redundant Systems eliminate threat of single point of failure in the IT infrastructure.

I am interacting with these devices, communicating with them to other connected devices to improve my productivity, have a better lifestyle, reduce my surprises and lower my operating costs of appliances. IoT promises the next technical revolution. develop it further. It’s an open source software framework that allows devices to communicate other devices around it. It is flexible, promotes proximal network and cloud connection (which is optional). E.g., a motion sensor letting appliances in the room to know that no one is in the room so that these appliances can shut themselves off. few years back, not long ago, I used to access internet only through my computer. But now, I can access it using my phones, tablets, game consoles. Management gurus, technology companies, always uncover the next big thing and through it the next source of income. They are rapidly creating new opportunities around “the internet of things” and converting it into almost “the internet of everything.” To realize the “promise” of IoT, technology companies have to work well on the common standards, which is adopted by a majority of them so that devices can get connected and talk seamlessly with each other. Naturally, it will not happen without jostling between rival products and competing systems. It has happened for trains, televisions, video recorders, and the internet itself. It will happen the same for the connected devices. The need for connect-and-communicate devices and underlying platforms has incubated some industry groups. Amongst them, the most prominent is the It is a consortium of firms with diverse domains likes semiconductors, white goods, consumer electronics and retails. Some of the most prominent members are Microsoft. Qualcomm, Panasonic, LG, and Haier. AllSeen Alliance’s member Qualcomm has created a free piece of software, . It was then handed over to its member to AllJoyn AllJoyn The manufacturer or operating system agnostic, sits in a device. It communicates over the wireless links such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The broadcast information it relays is a common language. Other connected devices or platforms understand it. The common language can result into many other not-yet- thought-of applications. Though it sounds simple, the challenge remains considerable. It is a daunting task to accommodate diverse nature of connected things, their thousands of uses and their sophistication. Also one has to think about future compatibility, to make people habitual about installing regular software updates for things like smart kitchen appliances. AllSeen Alliance .

The Industrial Internet Consortium is focusing on commercial and industrial use cases. Like Industrial Internet Consortium to “define common architectures” for smart objects. AT&T, Cisco, GE, IBM, and Intel have formed it. , there is another group called Just to give you an idea about devices, brands which are currently in the market ecosystem, I am sharing a comprehensive analysis done by a blogger Chris McCann. He has divided things into two categories like Thing- Consumers and Thing – Enterprise. He has created a third category, Internet-infrastructure under which he has covered Hardware/ Connectivity platforms, Board/Chipsets, Software Platforms, Analytics, Data Storage. There are interesting observations he has shared, and I liked are: • Currently, more devices are connected on the internet than humans • IoT has potential to transform the operations of industries • As of today, IoT is in a nascent stage. On consumer side it is still mainly for the hobbyist, on enterprise side, it is still for early adopter • IoT security is a big deal and big unresolved problem • Full ecosystem of IoT is huge , which promotes the usage of the IPSO Alliance Similarly Internet Protocol, which eventually standardises the way that data could flow across different types of network. Summary I sometimes wonder whether number and verities of the connected devices can make the emergence of a single standard near to impossible. Keeping my fingers cross and hoping to arrive at “Universal” languages for the connected devices and to have a better life. Open Interconnect Consortium The Samsung and others), and IEEE are working to build consensus on standards. (Broadcom, Dell, As one can see efforts put in by these alliances and consortiums are both competing and complementing. E.g. JUNE 2018 43 ™"
