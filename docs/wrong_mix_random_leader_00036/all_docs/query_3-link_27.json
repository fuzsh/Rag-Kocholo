        "text": "Final Report Summary - FEED-TO-FOOD (Reinforcement of FEED-TO-FOOD Research Center at Institute for Food Technology of the Univetsity of Novi Sad)\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\nResearch Center FEED-TO-FOOD with proven high level Scientific and Technological capacities exists as the independent working unit for almost 50 years, and now it acts as a part of Institute of Food Technology (FINS) at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia. It is unique research institution specialized for feed technology in Southeast Europe and wider. When we proposed FP7 REGPOT-3-2007 project FEED-TO-FOOD we want to confirm our regional reputation and to upgrade own research potentials. Objectives stated in the REGPOT-2007-3 call were just what we lacked in order to become the leading institution at the European level in the research area that covers technological processes in the feed to food chain. The objectives of this project involve (i) reinforcement of the Centre for Feed and Animal Products into a modern Research Centre FEED-TO-FOOD upgraded with new researchers and pilot plant equipment capable of investigations in feed manufacturing technology; (ii) creation of a network for cooperation between research teams with scientific interests concerning the feed to food production chain;(iii) improvement of research capacities and filling the gap in experience in how to take part in complex and long-term EU research projects.\n\nAs a result of this project Research Centre FEED-TO-FOOD has developed through the upgrade and renewal of pilot plant equipment, by recruiting new researchers, by the training of staff (in particular young researchers), and by academic visits, trans-national two-way exchanges of research staff between project beneficiaries, workshops and similar activities. All project activities were aimed at providing a stimulating and inspiring climate for scientific activities within Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD, not only for experienced researchers, but more importantly for the young generation of researchers, thus preventing “brain drain”.\n\nObjectives were achived in cooperation with project beneficiaries, well-known European research Institutions such as International Forschungsgemeinschaft Futtermitteltechnik, Braunschweig, Germany (IFIF), Institute National de la recherché agronomique, Clermont Ferrand - Teix, France (INRA) and the most prominent Institutes from European convergence regions such as National Research- Development Institute for Animal Biology and Nutrition, Bucharest-Balotesti, Romania (IBNA) and Institute of Animal Science of Lithuania, Baisogala, Lithuania (IAS). About thirty researchers from participating institutes were directly involved in FEED-TO-FOOD project activities, but much more people from research institutes, Universities, laboratories, SMEs and other stakeholders from EU and our regions were included through knowledge transfer (workshops, roundtable), FOOD CLUSTER INITIATIVE and other dissemination activities.\n\nUnder different type of activities through the FEED-TO-FOOD project, Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD is developed into the Institution ready to start with providing trainings and research opportunities to students, scientists and industry. Now, beside tradition and regional recognition, we have respectable reinforced research potential to fulfill stringent demands indicated in new FP7, Horizons 2020 and other EC calls. As the result of international cooperation eminent EU Institutes accepted us as the participants in FP7 and some other EU projects. The resulting cooperation will be based on a mutual benefit approach within the perspective of further integration of the Balkan region into the European Research Area (ERA) and therefore the European RTD activities and networks. This type of involvement improves the WBC research potential and favors a brain-gain environment. Research Centre FEED-TO-FOOD is widely recognized as the leader in feed technology and it is ready to participate in European RTD activities and assist in successful integration of Serbia, other West Balkan Countries and the whole region into the Europe.\n\nProject Context and Objectives:\n\nResearch Center FEED-TO-FOOD with proven high level Scientific and Technological capacities exists as the independent working unit for almost 50 years, and now it acts as a part of Institute of Food Technology (FINS) at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia. It is unique research institution specialized for feed technology in Southeast Europe and wider. Following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding associating the Republic of Serbia to the Seventh Framework Program of European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013), research group from Institute of Food technology concerned with feed technology take the chance and get the FP7-REGPOT-2007-3 project “Reinforcement of Feed to Food Research Centre at Institute for Food Technology of the University of Novi Sad” (Acronym: FEED-TO-FOOD).\n\nWhen we proposed this project we want to confirm our regional reputation and to upgrade own research potentials. Objectives stated in the REGPOT-2007-3 call were just what we lacked in order to become the leading institution at the European level in the research area that covers technological processes in the feed to food chain. The program planned through proposed FEED-TO-FOOD project forms a coherent set of coordination, training, dissemination, and development actions directly aimed at:\n\n• Improving research capacities of Research Centre FEED-TO-FOOD\n\n• Increasing networking with EU research institutions and\n\n• Making experience in how to take part in EU research projects.\n\nThe FEED-TO-FOOD project has fully achieved its objectives and technical goals and has even exceeded expectations:\n\n• Research capacities are improved by:\n\no Purchasing of new equipment\n\no Employment of young researchers;\n\no Employment of nationals\n\n• Closer S&T cooperation is established between project beneficiaries:\n\no Western Balkan Countries –WBC ( Serbia)\n\no EU member States (Germany and France), and\n\no EU regions of convergence (Romania and Lithuania);\n\n? National Research - Development Institute for Animal Biology and Nutrition, Bucharest-Balotesti, Romania (IBNA)\n\n? Institute of Animal Science of Lithuania (IAS).\n\n• Networking with EU research institutions is increased;\n\n• Exchanging of research experience are constantly in progress;\n\n• Great experience in how to take part in EU research experience is obtained;\n\n• Participation in FP7 and some other international project is provided;\n\n• Visibility of Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD is greatly increased.\n\nObjectives were achived in cooperation with project beneficiaries: Forschungsgemeinschaft Futtermitteltechnik, Braunschweig, Germany (IFIF); Institute National de la recherché agronomique, Clermont Ferrand - Teix, France (INRA); National Research - Development Institute for Animal Biology and Nutrition, Bucharest - Balotesti, Romania (IBNA) and Institute of Animal Science of Lithuania, Baisogala, Lithuania (IAS). About thirty researchers from participating institutes were directly involved in FEED-TO-FOOD project activities, but much more people from research institutes, Universities, laboratories, SMEs and other stakeholders from EU and our regions were included through knowledge transfer (workshops, roundtable), FOOD CLUSTER initiative and other dissemination activities.\n\nWe are particularly proud to the fact that we have taken a very proactive approach to the new challenges of ERA. We are active member of FOOD CLUSTER INITIATIVE of EC, which helps us to build partnership across the Europe, get information, exchange knowledge and experience, and improve our future activities trough regional food sector networking. As the result of international cooperation eminent EU Institutes accepted us as the participants in FP7 and some other EU projects. The resulting cooperation will be based on a mutual benefit approach within the perspective of further integration of the Balkan region into the European Research Area (ERA) and therefore the European RTD activities and networks. This type of involvement improves the WBC research potential and favors a brain-gain environment.\n\nResearch Center FEED-TO-FOOD, has started reinforcement by upgrading and renewal of pilot plant equipment (for milling, mixing, extruding/expanding, pelleting, drying-cooling and vacuum coating). Processing lines are completed with appropriate conditioners for steam and liquid component dosing, with steam generator and with devices for measuring flow, pressure and temperature of passing materials and/or working parts of equipment. Four young researchers, one technician and one national, who left the country during political and economic crisis were employed in Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD. Young employers successfully improved their skills in working on all devices in Pilot Plant. They were also trained to work in laboratories for analyzing of physical and chemical characteristics of feed. The young researchers had opportunity to upgrade their knowledge not only in Institute of Food Technology, but also in other national and international research institutions. The aim of all activities was to upgrade their knowledge step-by-step to the level of good professionals. Through these activities, funded by EC, we strongly developed our research potentials and provide opportunities for more research activities in the research area that covers technological processes in the feed to food chain. We are ready to ready to start with providing trainings and research opportunities to students, scientists and industry and to share obtained knowledge and research experience, with partners from industry and other stakeholders.\n\nAll project activities were aimed at providing a stimulating and inspiring climate for scientific activities within Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD, not only for experienced researchers, but more importantly for the young generation of researchers, thus preventing “brain drain”.\n\nResearch Centre Feed-to-Food organized two Workshops and Roundtable in Novi Sad, Serbia These were a part of planed activities of FEED TO FOOD project related to knowledge transfer at national and international level and also one of the main dissemination activities through which research potentials of the project beneficiaries were presented to a wider circle of researchers and other participants. Both Workshops allowed a very good opportunity for project promotion and networking with all participants. Scientific networking efforts continued through, short stay visits to IFF INRA IBNA and IAS, trainings of young researchers from FINS in developed Institutions, and through secondments of research staff between beneficiaries.\n\nA major contribution to the unlocking of the research potential is the participation of the project partners to scientific events which was also an occasion to communicate joint work of the project teams. Thus, FEED-TO-FOOD beneficiaries participated with scientific papers at numerous scientific events and presented 37 scientific papers of which 15 were joint publications as the results of networking and cooperation between project partners. Beside the presentation of the research potentials by scientific papers, beneficiaries participated at various meetings and events aiming for networking of researchers working in similar or compatible research areas in order to create the basis for future joint project proposals and they were successful in this effort.\n\nFEED-TO-FOOD project partners join the FOOD-CLUSTER INITIATIVE organized by EC (DG RTD-B.4 - Regions of Knowledge and Research Potential) for the “food related” funded projects and they were active members (except INRA). The Food Cluster Initiative has proved that to be beneficial as its critical mass allowed it to attain outcomes that would not have been reached at individual project level. It allowed notable unlocking of the research potential in the European Food Research Area by bringing together regional research actors that would not have met otherwise.\n\nIn addition to presenting their research potential, exchanging research experience and networking, all beneficiaries have used scientific and other meetings to present FEED TO FOOD project and to highlight EC financial support.\n\nUnder different type of activities through FEED-TO-FOOD project we attained European standards as scientific link in the production chain from feed to food. Now, beside tradition and regional recognition, we have respectable reinforced research potential to fulfill stringent demands indicated in new FP7 and other EC calls and we are competent to take important role in European Research Area. It must be emphasized that we have made a great progress trough FP7-REGPOT-2007-3 project FEED-TO-FOOD, funded by EC, and we have many reasons to be satisfied with the “harvest” of our common investment in research potentials: research capacities are improved, networking with EU research institutions is increased, great experience in how to take part in EU research is obtained, etc. Research Centre FEED-TO-FOOD is widely recognized as the leader in feed technology and it is ready to participate and assist in successful integration of Serbia, other West Balkan Countries and the whole region into the Europe.\n\nThe international visibility of the Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD and other project beneficiaries is much higher than at the beginning of the project. Now we are involved in a numerous FP7 and other EU projects. That would enable us long-term cooperation with eminent EU institutions. Beside the scientific impact of such cooperation and FEED-TO-FOOD project it is also important to mention ethical, social and political impact in situation when regional cooperation and good neighborly relations are more important than ever for enabling Serbia and the region as a whole to continue moving towards the EU.\n\nThe scope and variety of the project partners research work have greatly contributed to the progress of new technologies, products and procedures of particular importance for the advancement of feed and animal production. The scientific experience contribute not only to theoretical and methodological development of feed and animal production as the biotechnological science, but are also directly applied in practice, which means, in resolving the problems the feed manufacturers and food producers are encountered with, as well as in making professional bases and justifications for endorsing agrarian measures aimed at development, revitalization and enhanced competitiveness of feed industry and the progress in animal feeding and food production in general. With scientifically-based long termed experience, Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD helps producers to go forward to EU and WTO integration. That is an example of good collaboration between knowledge and practice and one of the ways for wider social implications of FEED-TO-FOOD project. The impact of such collaboration will be, among other things, the establishment of integrated scientific and technological basis needed to develop an environmentally friendly production and distribution chain of healthier, tastier and safer feed and food. In return, Europe will get clear picture of our scientific-research potentials in the field of feed and food technologies and assurance that it can count on these potentials in the framework of European integration and provision of assistance to WBC and other countries in the region.\n\nThere is an increasing societal awareness of the opportunities to improve the quality of life through healthy eating and of the contribution that sustainable production can make to improvement of the overall environment. In some sectors, such as food safety, process engineering and sustainability, Europe is already a world leader and innovation and investment is high. It is thus a very obvious target for research, innovation and implementation of achieved results and real opportunity for Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD to proposed new projects and to participate in these chelenges.\n\nProject Results:\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN S & T RESULTS/FOREGROUND\n\nResearch Center FEED-TO-FOOD with proven high level Scientific and Technological capacities exists as the independent working unit for almost 50 years, and now it acts as a part of Institute of Food Technology (FINS) at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia.

About thirty researchers from participating institutes were directly involved in FEED-TO-FOOD project activities, but much more people from research institutes, Universities, laboratories, SMEs and other stakeholders from EU and our regions were included through knowledge transfer (workshops, roundtable), FOOD CLUSTER initiative and other dissemination activities. Under different type of activities through the FEED-TO-FOOD project, Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD was developed into the Institution ready to start with providing trainings and research opportunities to students, scientists and industry and to participate in European RTD activities.\n\nWe are particularly proud to the fact that we have taken a very proactive approach to the new challenges of ERA. We are active member of FOOD CLUSTER INITIATIVE of EC, which helps us to build partnership across the Europe, get information, exchange knowledge and experience, and improve our future activities trough regional food sector networking.

The resulting cooperation will be based on a mutual benefit approach within the perspective of further integration of the Balkan region into the European Research Area (ERA) and therefore the European RTD activities and networks. This type of involvement improves the WBC research potential and favors a brain-gain environment.\n\nReinforcement of research potentials\n\nResearch Center FEED-TO-FOOD, has started reinforcement by upgrading and renewal of pilot plant equipment for milling, mixing, extruding/expanding, pelleting, drying-cooling and vacuum coating.\n\nBefore the equipment delivery, space for pilot plant laboratory was redesigned to meet the requirements for proper operation of the new equipment (this was funded by FINS). Purchased equipment was installed according to master project documentation.\n\nProcessing lines are completed with appropriate conditioners for steam and liquid component dosing, with steam generator and with devices for measuring flow, pressure and temperature of passing materials and/or working parts of equipment.\n\nLines equipped in such a way could be used for investigation in production chain from feed to food and will provide additional possibilities for development of new technological processes and products.\n\nReinforced Pilot Plant Laboratory was opened by Prof. Viktor Nedovic,, assistant minister for international cooperation and European integration in the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Serbia at the inauguration ceremony held on 29th of September during the 1st FEED-TO-FOOD project Workshop. After opening all Workshop participants have opportunity to visit Pilot Plant and FINS Laboratories. By opening the Pilot Plant Laboratory the major objective of FEED-TO-FOOD FP7-REGPOT-2007-3 project funded by EC was achieved. Now Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD will start providing training and research opportunities to scientists, researchers, students and also for feed and food industry.\n\nFour young researchers, one technician and one national, who left the country during political and economic crisis were employed in Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD. Young employers successfully improved their skills in working on all devices in Pilot Plant. They all passed trainings done by equipment producers which qualified them for working in pilot plant Research laboratory. Amandus Kahl Company was the host and organized training for 4 young researchers (1 week), technician (2 weeks) and one senior researcher (1 week). Practical and theoretical training in Amandus Kahl Company, held from 29th of June to 3rd of July 2009. Practical consisted of trials on pellet press, extruder/expander and conditioner. Experienced Kahl Company engineers helped young researchers and technician to learn how to manipulate with processing equipment. Beside practical training, young researchers and technician took part in theoretical course about application of extruders/expanders in animal feed production. This training was free and staff in Amandus Kahl Company was very devoted in order to train our researchers and technicians. Young researchers were also trained to work in laboratories for analyzing of physical and chemical characteristics of feed. They have opportunity to upgrade their knowledge not only in Institute of Food Technology, but also in other national and international research institutions.\n\nTraining for new young researchers from FEED-TO-FOOD Research Centre in IFF institute were organized and they passed basic course - Compound feed production (15-26, Jun, 2009). They also passed visited IFF Instutute in Braunshcweig - Thune, from 15th to 23rd of November, 2010. The main aim of this visitation was to attend two courses: „Innovative Hygienic Concepts“ and „Current Research Topics of Feed Technology“. Both courses were international, with reputable lecturers from world’s leading companies in field of feed producing and processing, such as Amandus Kahl - Germany, Bühler AG - Switzerland, Antiox Corp. – USA, Biomin – Germany, etc. Researchers used this one week visitation as an opportunity to visit the most important exhibition for animal husbandry and management in the world – Hannover EuroTier, where they made some interesting and useful conversations with new and also with well-known business partners. Over 1900 exhibitors came to this fair to share information about machinery and equipment, genetics, farm inputs and services for modern animal husbandry, as well as potentials in the field of bioenergy and local energy supply.\n\nDuring their visitation of Braunschweig, tour to Bühler AG Company in Braunschweig and Institut für Getreideverarbeitung (IGV GmbH) in Nuthetal near Potsdam, were organized. IGV GmbH is divided into five mostly independent scientific and service-oriented organizational units: Bakery Technology, Biotechnology, Food Technology, Renewable Resources, and Test Lab and Analytics. The compatibility between IGV Institute and FINS encouraged researchers to discuss possibilities for further scientific cooperation and joint researches.\n\nRadmilo Colovi? and Djuro Vukmirovic were in USA from 26th of September to 1st October, 2010 and they participate at 17th Annual Practical Short Course on Aquaculture Feed Extrusion, Nutrition and Feed Management. It was organized by Food Protein Research & Development Center at the Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas. The aim of this course was: training in principles and characteristics of extruders and support systems (conditioners, dryers, coolers...) reviewing current practices for preparation of aquaculture feeds, review of aquaculture nutrition and feed management practices.After theoretical part of the course practical demonstrations have been held in the pilot plants. The courses were held by eminent experts in the area of extrusion, nutrition, feed technology, etc. from companies like Insta-Pro, Wenger, Kemin, Buhler, etc. and by professors from Texas A&M University.\n\nThe aim of all activities, concerned with young researchers, during project duration was to upgrade their knowledge step-by-step to the level of good professionals. At the beginning of year 2011 (February, 1st 2011), four young researchers and young technician finished their full engagement in FEED-TO-FOOD project and were permanently employed in Research Centre FEED-TO-FOOD, at Institute of Food Technology (FINS) of University in Novi Sad. From mentioned date they have been involved in national research projects and international cooperation and their salaries are funded by Ministry of Education and Science of Republic of Serbia and other sources like other employes in FINS. Their trainings gave good results and they became useful members of Research Centre FEED-TO-FOOD. Through their employment, we strongly developed our research potentials and provide opportunities for more research activities in the research area that covers technological processes in the feed to food chain. We are ready to share obtained knowledge and research experience, with partners from industry and other stakeholders.\n\nAll project activities were aimed at providing a stimulating and inspiring climate for scientific activities within Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD, not only for experienced researchers, but more importantly for the young generation of researchers, thus preventing “brain drain”.\n\nDeveloping and transfer research potentials\n\nParticipation at scientific events\n\nA major contribution to the unlocking of the research potential is the participation of the project partners to scientific events which was also an occasion to communicate joint work of the project teams. Thus, FEED-TO-FOOD beneficiaries participated with scientific papers at numerous scientific events and presented 37 scientific papers of which 15 were joint publications as the results of networking and cooperation between project partners. Beside the presentation of the research potentials by scientific papers, beneficiaries participated at various meetings and events aiming for networking of researchers working in similar or compatible research areas in order to create the basis for future joint project proposals and they were successful in this effort.\n\nNetworking and cooperation activities with European research groups and joint future EU FP proposal possibilities were discussed during these meetings. Participation at these meetings was funded by FP7-REGPOT-2007-3 project FEED-TO-FOOD and from other sources but unlocking and promotion of the research potential was the common objective of all these meetings.\n\nParticipation at other events\n\nBeside the presentation of the research potentials by scientific papers, FEED-TO-FOOD beneficiaries participated at various meetings and events aiming for networking of researchers working in similar or compatible research areas in order to create the basis for future joint project proposals:\n\nMacedonia, Ohrid, September 2010 - Final Conference of Chromlab-antioxidans project (participants: Slavica Sredanovic and Olivera Djuragic from FINS)\n\nAustria, Viena, July 2011 – kick-off meeting of the FP7 FoodSEG project (participants: Daniela Marin, Ionelia Taranu from IBNA; Jovanka Levic and Slavica Sredanovic from FINS – funded by FoodSEG project)\n\nFrance, Clermont Ferrand, September 2011 – preparatory meeting with INRA teams (participant: Ionelia Taranu from IBNA)\n\nGreece, Thesaloniki, September 2011 - kick-off meeting of the Southeast networking project (participants: Jovanka Levic and Olivera Djuragic, from FINS- funded by Southeast)\n\nResearchers from IAS took part in Conference „Scientific support for Food Security and Global Governance\" organized by European Commission's Joint Research Centre in September 28, 2011 in Brussels and were participated in debate on questions related to food security with a focus on scientific needs and how research, technology and innovation could contribute to food for all in a sustainable manner.\n\nConferences organized by EC\n\nIn order to help researchers and institutions to contribute to the overall European research effort EC take on different activities:\n\nConference \"Research Connection 2009”, organized by the European Commission Directorate-General for Research (DG-RTD), which was held in Prague at May 2009 under the Czech EU Presidency was one of these activities that can help to achieve this goal. As the participants of these Conference beneficiaries received first hand information about the main EU programmes and initiatives regarding research, technological development and innovation with a view to stimulate further involvement and networking, in particular on the side of the new EU Member States. It was major event on EU research programmes and we gathered information about the 7th EU Research Framework Programme 2007-2013, the Structural Funds 2007-2013 and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme. Over two days, scientists, industrialists, researchers and politicians were connecting to discuss the future of research and science in Europe, ways of improvement through collaboration and one of the topics was the Guidance on how to participate in EU research projects (rules, tips, measures for small- and medium-sized enterprises etc).\n\nThe Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and the European Commission jointly organized the Week of Innovative Regions in Europe (WIRE 2010) that was held in Granada – Spain, on 15-17 March 2010, under the auspices of the Spanish EU Council Presidency. The event was focused on how to move from “synergies of policies” to “synergies of actions” for the optimal use of EU instruments, with the objective of making regions full protagonists in building the knowledge-based society. WIRE 2010 is the result of merging three different conferences:\n\n• Conference on the efficient and effective use of budget earmarked in the Structural Funds for RTD and Innovation, including their synergies with the FP and the CIP.\n\n• \"Research Potential\" conference, which focuses on the assessment of the results and the identification of best practices of the Research Potential (REGPOT) calls within the FP7 Capacities Programme, aimed at the increase of the research capabilities of the best research centres of the European regions, with an special emphasis in Convergence and Outermost regions.\n\n• \"Regions of Knowledge\" conference, which deals with the assessment of the results and the identification of best practices of the Regions of Knowledge (REGIONS) calls within the FP7 Capacities Programme, aimed at fostering regional cooperation through \"research-driven clusters\" by means of a comparison of the different regional strategies and joint action plans defined.\n\nTopics, discussed in common sessions were, among others, the aggregation of the good practices found in the development of the two programmes, REGPOT and REGIONS, and some possible synergies, such as the stimuli to foster research potential of areas of interest of a cluster in a given region or groups of regions, or the clustering around a high quality research centre in a certain regions. The synergies between the different innovation instruments (FP, SF and CIP, the National and Regional initiatives) were also the common subject of study during the European Week of Innovative Regions.\n\nThe conference was one of the major events of the Spanish presidency with approximately 450 participants. WIRE 2010 was a high-level forum for discussion of stakeholder's good practices and ideas on how to make the best of European, national and regional funding for R&D and innovation and more efficient ways to conduct future actions. In this line, REGPOT and REGIONS programmes (Capacities – FP7) can play a crucial role. The Research Potential Program and the role of the WBC within REGPOT were among the topics discussed. FOOD CLUSTER INITIATIVE was presented as the successful EC project by professor Keith Adrain Harrap.\n\nFEED-TO-FOOD project beneficiaries (IAS and FINS) participate at conference and presented the poster.\n\nUnder the aegis of the Hungarian EU Council Presidency the conference ‘Week of Innovative Regions in Europe 2011 (WIRE2011) were organized jointly with the European Commission on 7-9 June 2011 in Debrecen, Hungary dedicated to possible synergies between research infrastructures and cluster policy.\n\nThe conference – considering the document of ‘EUROPE 2020, a strategy for a smart, sustainable and inclusive development strategy’ and the ‘Innovation Union Flagship Initiative’ - focused on questions related to knowledge, innovation and competitiveness in economy with respect to research infrastructure investments, clusters and their effects on how they can support smart growth in the regions. WIRE2011 connected cluster development and research infrastructure policy in order to enhance innovation performances and regional development. Researchers from FINS and IAS take part at this conference.\n\nDuring the Conference, exhibitions were organized for regions and clusters. Participating in the exhibition at WBC-INCO NET STAND with roll up poster was an excellent opportunity for us to present FEED-to-FOOD project as an example of good practice.\n\nThe WIRE 2011 Organizing Committee jointly with the European Commission organised a Cocktail Reception of the WIRE2011 on the December 5, 2011 in Brussels. The researcher from IAS had possibility to join this event and to participate in discussion about ensuring the visibility for the continuation of WIRE activities.\n\nEC Conferences organized in Serbia\n\nThe European Research Information event: “Towards Integration into the European Research Area” with more than 400 participants was held in Belgrade on 29th of June 2009 in organization of the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Republic of Serbia and the General Directorate for Research of the European Commission in Belgrade.\n\nVice-prime minister and Minister for Science and Technological Development Bozidar Djelic and the European Commissioner for Research Janez Potocnik addressed the participants during the Opening Statements. Feed to Food Research team proposed FOOD CLUSTER INITIATIVE as one of the topics and Prof Dr Xavier Gelink as the lecturer for this event. Prof Dr Xavier Gelink coordinator of Food Cluster Initiative took part in EC delegation and gave presentation “Pathways to develop a cluster approach: Experiences from the EU Food Cluster. During this event Prof Gelink have a meeting with Vice-prime minister for Science and Technological Development Prof Dr Victor Nedovic, their assistents and researchers from FEED-to-Food project about possibilities for Food Cluster Initiative in Serbia. Suggested concrete actions of this meeting were presented during the concluding session. Realisation of the conclusions was followed up in the forthcoming period both by the Ministry and European Commission.\n\nTAIEX Workshop on Feed Safety, AGR 32323 organized in cooperation with Serbian Chamber of Commerce & FEFAC was held in Novi Sad on February 20th, 2009. Research Centre Feed-to Food supported this event as the host organizer and through presentation “Update on adoption/implementation of the EU feed legislation at national level” by Dr Jovanka Levic, FEED-TO FOOD project coordinator. The aim of the meeting was to inform the participants on the HACCP-based Quality Assurance systems and different feed technology issues. Beside local organizer, experts from EU presented their experiences from EU Member States about practical approach to feed legislative, quality assurance systems and management in feed industry. Dr Alexander Feil from IFF-Institute, Feed-to Food project beneficiaries was engaged as the expert in FEFAC team, but after that meeting he visit FINS. All employees from Research Centre Feed-to Food and Alexandra Kirchner from IFF-Institute, which was at one week secondment’s visit in FINS attended this meeting.\n\nIn the frame of this workshop, Feed-to Food project was presented through oral presentation, leaflets and roll-up banner, press conference for state TV Canal RTV 1 as well as through different contacts with participants.\n\nCommon projects / initiatives\n\nThe Feed to Food project activities and the foster of the collaborations among project partners contributed to joint participation in common projects / initiatives.\n\nThus, a follow up of the FP6-FeedSEG symposium – Mosonmagyarovar, Hungary, 2008 was the joint participation of IBNA and FINS in FP7- FoodSEG (a project lead by Austria, already financed, running between 2011 and 2014).\n\nAlso, IBNA and FINS jointly participate in another project, COST FA0802 “Feed for Health” (a project lead by Italy, financed, running between 2009 and 2013)\n\nIFF and Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD by networking with EUFETEC (European Feed Technology Centre) has built the consortium which make proposal for the call FP7-KBBE-2010-2-4-03.(failed)\n\nResearch Center FEED-TO-FOOD also has made the proposal for FP7- REGPOT-2010-5 project FEED-TECH-EXCEL (failed)\n\nOne more result was the joint participation of the IBNA and FINS teams in the FP7 project proposal “EuroProgFarmMast” (lead by SIGRA from Latvia, submitted in 2012, currently under evaluation). Connection with proposed project coordinator was established at Food Cluster Initiative meetings.\n\nAlthough didn’t lead to joint participation, the activities organized within Feed to Food project constituted the occasion for new collaborations established by the project partners (outside the Feed to Food consortium), via new contacts.\n\nThus, FEED TO FOOD project beneficiaries got involved in following project proposals:\n\n• two Romania - Greece bilateral projects - submitted in 2011, one of which financed for 2012-2013,\n\n• ERC Starting Grant project proposal “HerbsForGutHealth” – submitted in 2011 (failed) and resubmitted in 2012 (under evaluation)\n\n• Serbia-Croatia bilateral cooperation financed in 2011 and 2012\n\n• FINS became the partner in Southeast project together with Institute from Romania which is outside the Feed to Food consortium but but owing to project connections.\n\nThrough contacts, established during some of before mentioned meetings project beneficiaries corresponded with a large number of Institutes and Universities for possible EU FP7 project proposal collaboration which are not finished yet.\n\nExchanging research experience through secondments of research staff\n\nExchanging research experience and know-how and networking through secondments of research staff from IFF, IBNA, IAS and INRA in Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD was organized successively during the project duration.

We have opportunity to hear relevant stakeholders from the European triple helix, among which participants from the European Commission, regional authorities, regional clusters, companies, RTD performers and also notably academics from all over the Europe.\n\nThe following topics were addressed:\n\n• key experiences in cluster building (success stories, bottlenecks and success factors);\n\n• the role of the different stakeholders (policy, research and industry) in building successful clusters;\n\n• the impact of food clustering;\n\n• funding schemes to further support the capacity building efforts of regional clusters;\n\n• the future strategy of the Food Cluster Initiative\n\nFurthermore, a series of interactive workshops were organized in order to\n\n• define future funding needs and ways to address them;\n\n• improve cluster cooperation;\n\n• evaluate the performance of clusters\n\nIn its Europe 2020 new long term strategy, the European Commission aims to tackle the challenges of the reshaped social market economy and turn the EU into a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. By stimulating smart growth through innovation and knowledge building, an ‘Innovation Union’ with more competitive and innovative regions will arise. Strengthening partnerships between research, business and policy is one of the key innovation pathways to achieve this and at Food Cluster Initiative meetings we were fully informed about new EC strategy.\n\n7th Food Cluster Meeting 13-14 October 2011, Brussels, Belgium\n\n7th Food Cluster Meeting was held on 13-14 October 2011 in Brussels- Belgium. This meeting was orienting much more towards 'research' (KBBE programme etc.) since the organizers consider that participating institutions have or they are about to finish their „capacity building“. A lot of interesting points were discussed. As usually, we met many interesting potential partners. Slavica Sredanovic and Olivera Djuragic from Research Centre Feed to Food participate at this meeting and distribute 3rd Leaflet of Feed-to-Food project and 1st Announcement for 6th Central European Congress on Food (CEFood) to other participants. FINS is one of the main organizers of this important event which will be held in Novi Sad 23-26th May 2012.\n\nDuring this meeting we start to talk about new project proposal with SIGRA Institute from Latvia which we were proposed later.\n\nOur project officer dr Irmela Brach changed the workplace in EC and during the cocktail which was held in STANHOPE hotel participants are parted from her and thanked for the good cooperation.\n\nDevelopment, launch and maintaining of Web portal\n\nProject Website is established as a tool to disseminate information about FEED-TO-FOOD project and main achieved results. In the 3rd Reporting period, developement and updating of project web-site was continued. The number of visits of www.feed-to-food.uns.ac.rs site grew and it is still growing. Web-site developing has been achieved its goal; constant informing and dissemination of Feed to Food project activities. Links to project web site were established on web sites of all project beneficiaries, on different EC portals, on the web site of Food Cluster Initiative and on the web sites of the most participants in this action.\n\nLeaflet preparation and publishing\n\nLeaflet containing project description and achieved results were prepared, printed and distributed to project partners and than to researchers, authorities, EC, SMEs etc. In final year of project duration, we wanted to present the development of Research Centre Feed to Food and achieved results and we have prepared a more extensive and better assorted Leaflet than in previous years. The leaflets were prepared in both Serbian and English language and distributed on the numerous conferences and meetings all over the world.\n\nCommunications with interested partners and authorities\n\nResearch Centre FEED-TO-FOOD has had permanent communication with Serbian Chamber of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture of Republic Serbia, Provincial Secretariat of Agriculture and other state authorities regarding legislation in feed production chain and implementation of knowledge to practice. We have had participate in working groups of experts, which are dealing with harmonization of Serbian and EU regulative. The Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD was in constant contact with state authorities and feed producers about organization of Roundtable discussion and they participate with presentations also as experts from FINS.\n\nWe have shared obtained knowledge and research experience, especially in area of feed technology and quality assurance, with partners from industry and other stakeholders. We permanently organized Feed Technology Symposiums and other meetings were feed producers and other participants in feed production chain can get information about development in FEED-TO-FOOD research area.\n\nResearch Centre FEED-TO-FOOD is opened for all kind of communication, research and other activities with Institutes, Faculties, Farmers, Producers of equipment, feed raw materials, additives, compound feed etc. They all have opportunity to visit laboratories in FINS and Pilot plant equipment purchased by EC support through FP7 FEED TO FOOD project and to be introduced with FINS activities. We are always ready for cooperation and we are ready to share knowledge and experience.\n\nContacts about public presentations\n\nWe made a great effort to invite large number of different media houses in order to highlight workshop and roundtable topics and to promote Feed-to-Food project funded by EC.\n\n2nd FEED-TO-FOOD Workshop titled “Extrusion Technology in Feed and Food Processing“ and the Roundtable regarding legislation in the feed production deserved much media attention. Numerous television programs, radio and newspapers have devoted considerable time and space to this events.\n\nAll these activities required prior contacts and the organization. We contact a lot of radio and TV studious and newspapers in order to promote topics of both meetings and to highlight FEED TO FOOD project and EC contribution in funding of our activities. Also, we prepared previous reports for journalist in order to inform them about these events.\n\nWe have established communication with a few local and with State radio and TV studious and they are ready to follow our important event when we call them.\n\nProject management during the period\n\nProject Management Work Package 1 (WP1), corresponds to the management structure of the project. Due to its nature, WP1 spans from the start until the end of the project. While scientific excellence of proposals and project results is of the greatest importance for FP7 projects, effective and correct management that follows all the rules and principles is essential to satisfy the programme's formal requirements. Administrative, financial, and legal management is thus an inevitable part of FP7 project preparation and implementation.\n\nSuccessful realization of FP7 projects is connected not only with achieving the research objectives but also with successful administrative, legal, and financial project management. Knowledge of FP7 financial rules and principles is a necessary prerequisite for correct budget preparation and correct spending and cost reporting. Effective financial project management should thus ensure smooth and trouble-free project preparation and implementation (both for researchers and project administrators involved), as well as cost justification to project officers and financial auditors.\n\nTo provide a better and clearer explanation of rules, a number of workshops were organized by Serbian Ministry of Science in Belgrade and we participate at these meetings.\n\nThe main objective of FEED-TO-FOOD project management was to ensure the basic infrastructure of the CSAs for coordination and administration and to allow the Research Center FEED-TO- FOOD to reinforce as planned on time and within budget.\n\nCoordinator managed all the tasks indicated in Articles II.2.3 and Article II 16.5 of the Grant Agreement and the tasks from WP1 in Annex I of the Grant Agreement. The Consortium management tasks include:\n\n• Overall project management\n\n• Budget management\n\n• Coordination assistance\n\n• Local coordination\n\n• Organization of international board meetings\n\n• Organization of training\n\n• Organization of workshops and roundtable\n\n• Audit certification\n\nOverall project management\n\nManagement of FP projects requires participants to handle administrative, legal and financial matters. These activities inevitably connect with the project’s administrative management within FINS and involve communication with other beneficiaries. Moreover, the coordinator also has to communicate with the EC on behalf of the whole consortium and report periodically on the project’s implementation. Even though projects are carried out jointly by all beneficiaries in the consortium (i.e. technical collective responsibility exists), project management lies mainly in the hands of the coordinator. The coordinator is responsible for both the internal and external management of the project. Good governance and effective communication between partners is essential for smart project management and we had it. Within this task coordinator has made efforts to:\n\n• manage the overall legal, ethical, financial and administrative project activities for each beneficiaries;\n\n• ensure focus on the direction of the project’s objectives in accordance with the project plan\n\n• guarantee the nontechnical, technical and administrative coordination among all activities involved in the project\n\n• monitor milestones and ongoing tasks, as well as coordinate the production of reports and deliverables\n\n• manage and administer the procedure for modification of project duration\n\nThe main management activities are listed below together with achievements :\n\n• Keep up communication between EC and beneficiaries;\n\n• Intensive communication with EC about modification of project duration;\n\n• Collaboration with project partners about project overall progress;\n\n• Promotion of the detailed working plan;\n\n• Organization of International Board meetings;\n\n• Organization of Scientific Committee meetings;\n\n• Organization of scientific visits, young researchr trainings and participation at different meetings and conferencess (invitation letters, visas, traveling and accommodation).\n\n• Communication about networking and future collaboration;\n\n• Communication with Wageningen University (coordinator) about writing Proposal for new FP7-KBBE-2010-2-4-03 EC call\n\n• Communication with Austrian Agency about FP7-KBBE-2010-4 EC call and preparing necessary materials\n\n• Communication with RAF REGION project and company Euroconsultants S.A. about new EU project\n\n• Communication with EU institutes and researchers about Letters of intent for FP-7 REGPOT-2010-5 call and organization concerned writing of proposal.\n\n• Cooperation with other projects/programs like as FEED-SEG, BALTFOODQUAL, FEED SAFETY, FOOD CLUSTER INITIATIVE….\n\n• Organization of 2nd FEED-TO-FOOD Workshop (definition of the overall structure of the workshop, preparation and posting of announcement, calls for papers and invited speakers, organization of paper peer reviewing, scientific committee, program, simultaneous translation, space, technical details, promotional materials and contacts, registrations, accommodation for guests, social activities, publishing Proceedings and CD etc…)\n\n• Organization of Roundtable discussion\n\n• Contacts with State authorities\n\n• Detailed monitoring of reinforcement of Research Centre FEED-TO- FOOD\n\n• Delivery of periodic report and all deliverables\n\n• Approving the time recording shits\n\n• Coordination with FINS administration including instructions about archiving of contracts, invoicing, payments, travel orders, travel tickets, receipt and delivery of postal and other mail, procurement of office supplies and other consumable material etc.\n\n• Procurement of office supplies and other consumable material\n\n• Keeping records related to the project\n\nTechnical work related to coordination of work between project coordinator and administrative department of FINS was performed by technical secretary of FEED-TO- FOOD project.\n\nManagement is also involved in activities concerned with tasks in WP5 through the organization of all dissemination and promotional activities like as:\n\n• Public presentation of papers and articles concerned with project;\n\n• FOOD-CLUSTER INITIATIVE;\n\n• Updating of web portal;\n\n• Leaflet preparation and publishing;\n\n• Communications with interested partners and authorities;\n\n• Contacts about public presentations of reinforced research capacities and networking results in newspapers, radio and on TV\n\nBudget management\n\nEU funding for FP7 grants of SP Cooperation and Capacities is mainly based on the reimbursement of direct and indirect eligible costs. FP7 financial rules and principles described by the EC in various legally binding or guidance documents define certain requirements for costs to be eligible, describe specific conditions for categories of direct costs, and identify methods for the calculation of indirect costs. EC reimburse the total amount of all eligible costs for this kind of project. To know and understand these rules is an important prerequisite for correct budget preparation, correct cost spending, and cost reporting.\n\nWithin these tasks the following management activities were done by project coordinator:\n\n• On behalf of the beneficiaries administer the Community financial contribution regarding its allocation between beneficiaries and activities, in accordance with Grant agreement and the plans taken by the consortium;\n\n• Ensure that all appropriate payments are made to the other beneficiaries without unjustified delay;\n\n• Approve and confirm all bank transactions;\n\n• Keep the records and financial accounts of any financial contribution paid to the purposes of the project;\n\n• Collaborate with project partners and ensured the correctness of financial reports and invoices;\n\n• Preparing data for financial Audit control;\n\nCoordination assistance\n\nResearchers from all Institutes project beneficiaries were cooperative to help in management activities beside their main duty. Internal reporting to the coordinator were more frequent than project meetings (i.e. face-to-face communication). All partners send their reports at the end of important activities while annual reporting was obligatory.\n\nFor communication between partners, usually e-mails, Skype, telephone calls, project meetings and internal reporting were used. Internal reporting provides the coordinator with, better control over the project, potentially detecting problems in their early stages, and ensuring smooth project implementation.\n\nThis task include help and assistance to coordinator in all management activities whenever appropriate to ensure that the project is carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions of this grant agreement. Coordination assistance was necessary during the whole reporting period because of added activities concerned with increasing networking, forming the consortiums for new EU projects, preparing the new proposals, modification of project duration and especially in the absence of coordinator during the holiday.\n\nLocal coordination\n\nThis task include communications with:\n\n• Ministry of Science and Technological development RS\n\n• Ministry of agriculture RS\n\n• Chamber of Commerce RS\n\n• Provincial Secretariat for Science and Technological Development\n\n• Provincial Secretariat for Agriculture\n\n• Association of Feed Producers RS etc.\n\nBeside permanent communication with listed governmental bodies, project coordinator and other researchers from Research Center FEED-TO-FOOD, were participated in working groups of experts, which are dealing with harmonization of Serbian and EU legislation and organized Roundtable discussion with feed producers and other stakeholders in feed chain.\n\nOrganization of International board meetings\n\nInternal management of relationships between project partners and communication inside the consortium is formally based mainly on provisions set out in Annex I - “Description of work”. The structure of governance depends on the size of the consortium, i.e. the number of beneficiaries and of course on the type of project. International board of FEED-TO-FOOD project represents all beneficiaries and it was assembled of 6 members (project coordinator, vice coordinator and team leaders from Institutes – project beneficiaries). It was planed to have International board meetings at the beginning of the project and at the end of each reporting period, but we have it more frequently because we take each opportunity during the other meetings or visits to talk about future activities and project development at formal and informal meetings. Some of the project activities scheduled for International board meeting and another tasks in FEED-TO-FOOD project were done during the meetings with different topics were some of beneficiaries met each other, like as WIRE Conferences in Granada-Spain and Debrecen-Hungary, short scientific visits to Braunschweig-Germany, 9th and 10th International Symposium of Animal Biology and Nutrition in Bucharest, Romania etc. in order to organize future project activities, upgrade collaboration between project partners and contribute to project progress.\n\nAll project beneficiaries participated, along the project, to the project meetings where necessary activities for project realization (as planned within the project) were detailed and reports about realized activities were discussed.\n\nThe Final International board meeting was organized by IAS Institute and it was held at 22 to 26 February 2012 in Lithuania. The first part of meeting was held in Vilnus, Capital town of Lithuania. The work started from close communication with project coordinator and other partners concerning meeting agenda and presentations. All project beneficiaries participate at this meeting and present activities which they performed during the project duration. Both, technical and financial results were sumarized and after discusion participants get instructions about preparation of Final report and established dead lines for each of final activities. The meeting place and services were chosen in accordance with the EU and Lithuanian national legislation. Additionally, except working program, the social events were performed during which the project partners had possibility to become familiar with Lithuanian culture, traditions and customs. The second day was used for visiting the IAS Institute which is located in Baisogala. During this visit participants of International board meeting got information about research activities of IAS and research methods used in their laboratories.\n\nOrganization of these meetings include communication with Project officer and beneficiaries concerned with timetables, agendas, presentations, social events, venues, participants registration, invitation letters for visas, contacts with embassy, bucking hotels, buying tickets etc.\n\nOrganization of trainings\n\nTrainings in FINS laboratories, in Feed manufacturing companies, in IFF, INRA, IAS and IBNA Institutes and at Texas A&M University were organized for hired young researchers during project duration. The purpose of these trainings was the upgrading of their knowledge in feed to food research area. Organization include decisions about participants, planning of training programmes, arrangement of travelling and accommodation, payments etc.\n\nOrganization of workshops and roundtable\n\nOrganization of Workshops include definition of the overall structure of the workshop, preparation and posting of announcement, calls for papers and invited speakers, organization of paper peer reviewing, scientific committee, program, space, simultaneous translation, technical details, promotional materials and contacts, registrations, accommodation for guests, social activities, publishing Proceedings and CD etc. This task is finished successfully.\n\nRoundtable discussion was organized in collaboration with state authorities which take part in presentations about Serbian and EU legislative. Beside presentations performed by experts in this area organization of Roundtable discussion include different management activities like as: definition of overall structure and agenda; preparation and posting of announcement and invitations by regular post and by E-mails; contacts with industry, inspections and other stakeholders; technical details like as space, sound system, etc; promotional materials; registrations; accommodation for guests; social activities etc This task was finished successfully and were performed by FINS.\n\nAudit certification\n\nConsidering that the amount of money spent in the 1st reporting period was up to 375.000,00 €, audit certification was necessary than and now at the end of project and it was organized by project coordinator and done by IEF certified auditor..\n\nProblems which have occurred and how they were solved or envisaged solutions\n\nThe biggest problem for management was the fact that IFR Institute quitted the project. At the 2nd International board meeting held together with the 2nd Food Cluster Initiative meeting on 15-16 September 2008 in Brusseas consortium made the decision to change beneficiary IFR according to its request with new beneficiary. Activities which were dedicated ti IFR Institute were completely taken by INRA from France, after finishing of changing procedure. In requested documentation for Ec we write that the starting date in FEED-TO-FOOD project for INRA will be 11th November, 2008 but we received Amendment 1 almost 1 year later. So beneficiary INRA have a big problem to organize all activities in short time until the end of project.\n\nThe project activities were modified during the 3rd reporting period according to the progress of the project, thus the timing of the project activities were differing from the proposed plan. Two prolongation of project get formal EC notification through Amendment No. 2 and Amendment No 3 to grant agreement No. 207043 – Project title “FEED-TO-FOOD” during the 3rd reporting period. With reference to these amendments project duration was prolonged to 44 and later to 50 months. It was cost neutral prolongation of project. Depending on the last month of the project, last reporting period was prolonged. Extension of the project is requested concerning the lack of time to adjust and complete the activities related to the beneficiaries No 6 (INRA), the new member from 10th month of project. Their activities started much after the scheduled start of the contract because documentation was not completed. For this reason, some activities were allocated between beneficiaries and in accordance with these changes, a new commitment in the months and time of individual activities was defined. Part of funds in WP1 (27000 Euro) provided for the management is diverted for:\n\n• WP2 for salaries of 2 new researchers hired according to approval of the project officer 2 and 4 months earlier than originally planned (a total of 4200 Euro for 6 months)\n\n• WP2 for financing the purchase of equipment (5150 Euro)\n\n• WP5 for funding FOOD-CLUSTER activities (5000 Euro)\n\n• Personal cost for researcher except young researchers and nationals (12650 Euro)\n\nAll other provisions of the grant agreement and its annexes remained unchanged.\n\nUnfortunately, beneficiaries No 6 (INRA) did not spend money because they shortened the stay in secondment visit at FINS in Novi Sad due to other commitments they had.\n\nList of project meetings dates and venues\n\nIt was planed to have International board meetings at the beginning of the project and at the end of each reporting period, but we have it more frequently because we take each opportunity during the other events (Food Cluster Initiative meetings, Workshops, WIRE and other Conferences etc.) to talk about project development and future activities at formal and informal meetings. Researchers from all Institutes project beneficiaries were cooperative to help in achieving good project results.\n\n• In the 3rd Reporting period International board meeting was organized on 24th September 2010 during the 9th International Symposium of Animal Biology and Nutrition in Bucharest, Romania.\n\n• International board meeting was also organized during the 2nd FEED-TO-FOOD project Workshop held in Novi Sad at 19-21 October, 2010.\n\n• The Final International board meeting was organized by IAS Institute in Lithuania and it was held at 22 to 26 February 2012 in Lithuania.\n\nProject planning and status\n\nFeed to Food project (grant agreement No 207043) has been finished...\n\n...but this is not the end of successful scientific cooperation!\n\nAll beneficiaries will continue with mutual activities, following latest trends in EU researches.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nThe objective of the REGPOT-2007-3 programme was to contribute to the realization of the FP7’s international dimension by implementing actions - under the ‘Research Potential’ activity - promoting closer S&T cooperation opportunities between Europe and the Western Balkan Countries (WBC). The Research Potential international dimension component targets several identified needs in terms of Human and material capacities improvement, scientific networking and exchange of know-how and experience. This could improve the WBC participation in the RTD Framework Programme and favor brain-gain environments through trans-national two-way exchanges of research staff between centers established in the EU’s convergence and outermost region’s, in other European regions and in the WBC. The resulting cooperation will be based on a mutual benefit approach within the perspective of further integration of the Balkan region into the European Research Area (ERA) and therefore the European RTD activities and networks.\n\nExpected impact was identified as:\n\n• Upgrading the RTD capacity and capability (human potential: number of new researchers and training of research staff, improvement of research management, scientific equipment) as well as the quality of research carried out by the selected research entities;\n\n• Better integration of the selected research entities in the ERA as a whole (partnerships, including twinning with research groups elsewhere in Europe);\n\n• Contribution to regional capacity building;\n\n• Improvement of the potential of the selected research entities to participate in research activities at EU (FP7 and other projects).\n\nAll these expected impacts were achieved during the project duration but in RTD activities it is always possible to do more and better. Under different type of activities through FEED-TO-FOOD project we attained European standards as scientific link in the production chain from feed to food. Now, beside tradition and regional recognition, we have respectable reinforced research potential to fulfill stringent demands indicated in new FP7 and other EC calls and we are competent to take important role in European Research Area. Research Centre FEED-TO-FOOD is widely recognized as the leader in feed technology and it is ready to participate and assist in successful integration of Serbia, other West Balkan Countries and the whole region into the Europe.\n\nProject promotion and dissemination strategy is very important for upgrading the research potentials of research Centre FEED-TO-FOOD. Due to difficult political situation in Serbia in the past decades, poor economic situation in general, and the previous isolation of the country, our researchers does not have resources necessary to stay on the top of developments in the scientific world and had no chance to participate in EU projects. Thus we all take the chance for unlock and promote our research potentials through FEED-TO-FOOD project. Throughout the reporting 3rd reporting period all project beneficiaries takes different activities to engage with public and the media about the project aims and results and to highlight the Community financial support.\n\nResults of the project were presented at conferences at national and international level, and through Food Cluster Initiative.
