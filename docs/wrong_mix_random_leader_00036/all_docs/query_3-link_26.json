I have also attached my Election Communication (it has my photographs in Western and Middle Eastern style!) of which 60,000 copies will be delivered by Royal Mail from Tuesday.\n\nMy website will be published on Wednesday (www.dharamsey.co.uk and www.dharamsey.info).\n\nI am rather surprised that no Independent Candidate has taken up your splendid offer.\n\nKind regards\n\nAbby -Ajdharamsey (talk)\n\nNot done. I'm afraid you have misunderstood what Wikipedia is about - it is an encyclopedia, not an election notice-board or a vehicle for promotion of any kind. We do not offer to publish candidates' election manifestos; in fact, because of our requirement for a neutral point of view, people are strongly discouraged from writing about themselves. The convention, explained at WP:POLITICIAN, is that candidates' articles are redirected to the appropriate constituency article, and I have re-created your article as a redirect to Westminster North (UK Parliament constituency). Please do not add to that. Regards, JohnCD (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nI would like to add the TechExcel article so that readers know about TechExcel - the application lifecycle management and IT service management software provider. The contents of the article will look like the contents of the article Tech_Excel. I plan to delete the Tech_Excel article as soon as the TechExcel article is live. -Fjabbour (talk)\n\nNot done. The TechExcel article was deleted three times as a result of deletion discussions at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/DevPlan, Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/TechExcel, and Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/TechExcel Software, and the title has been protected from creation because it was re-created so often. I have returned your new version to your user space at User:Fjabbour/TechExcelDraft; if you want an article about this company, you should first approach user Ihcoyc (talk · contribs), the admin who closed the most recent AfD and protected the title; and if he does not agree you can take it to WP:Deletion review. Note that an article must not merely not read like advertising; it must also establish that the company is notable enough to have an encyclopedia article, which is not a matter of opinion but needs to be demonstrated by showing \"significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.\" I will add some helpful links on your talk page. JohnCD (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nThe Kovenant may be a little known band, but as long as they are considered notable themselves, it seems logical that their releases (at least the full-length albums) are just as notable as the band. An article on SETI was deleted on May 2, 2010, after a proposal on grounds of non-notability. -Uzyel (talk)\n\nDone. As a contested PROD, the article is restored on request. I have notifed user 92.11.105.66 (talk · contribs), who PRODded it on grounds of \"notability\", in case s/he wishes to nominate it at AfD. It does not follow that every album from a notable band is also notable - see WP:Notability (music) and in particular WP:NALBUMS. You may like to consider adding sources to help establish notability and to comply with the verifiability requirement. JohnCD (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nplease do not delete the page i will modify the content as per the rules -124.41.239.164 (talk)\n\nNot done. Article deleted as spam, author Ghumgham (talk · contribs) blocked. JohnCD (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nThis article was deleted for failing to establish notability. I would like for it to be undeleted and possibly put back in sandbox mode so that I may append to it the grounds for notability and be reviewed again afterward. thanks! -Distributer1 (talk)\n\nDone - the page has been restored to your userspace at User:Distributer1/Gregg Distributors. --Tikiwont (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nThe website had been edited. The musical duo's career is valid with credible websites of record labels, valid label websites and an artist page. Interview websites are also added and websites where the discography is credible is shown. Please reconsider because the references are edited and every fact is accounted for. I believe the article is in threat of being deleted because every sentence was not referenced. -Cjpark30 (talk)\n\nThis page is only for requesting undeletion of deleted pages. You should make your comments at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Classixx; the debate has still several days to run. JohnCD (talk)\n\nedited the page with appropiate internal and external links. non-personal websites are listed as references. -Cjpark30 (talk)\n\nSee above. Please weigh in at the debate listed above as the original refund request here has been granted and is closed.--Tikiwont (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nI transfered that file in the past onto Commons (at the begining 2006, when I was still a baby here), but with a reduced resolution (see commons:File:450px-ScarboroughPylons.jpg). It after has been deleted here under WP:CSD F8 (probably my fault). I completly forgot that till today. Now I would like to upload the full resolution original image to Commons. Could you restore it? I will do everything on the Commons side so that it replaces the lowest resolution version (if applicable, I don't remember), with the correct original upload log and description. For that I need that you accept to restore this image during the time necessary for me to cleanup all that or that you do it yourself, but I'm not asking for that. -GaAs (d)\n\nDone--Tikiwont (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nthis composer is continuing to produce valuable work which is finding an increasing audience in the UK, in Europe and in North America; and there seems no particular reason to remove the information in the article making it unavailable if it is of use to musicians who might want to search. -Hintersatz (talk)\n\nDone - as a contested proposed deletion, the article has been restored on request.--Tikiwont (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nSubject has since become notable through being elected as an MP. -Wereon (talk)\n\nDone Election makes old Afd moot.--Tikiwont (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nI wanted to create a page for this person as he was elected MP yesterday for Surrey East but I saw it had already been deleted and I didn't want to be blocked for recreating a deleted page.

If you have already done so, your concerns can be taken to deletion review.\n\nAnd since the closing admin has weighed in here, it seems you have two viable options. You can make a new properly sourced draft at User:Biswaranjan.das/Paramahansa Srimat Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Dev, showing sources that meet the objections raised at the original AfD, or you can take it to deletion review. I'd strongly suggest the first course, because deletion review will ask you for that information anyways.--Fabrictramp | talk to me\n\nAlso, please don't continue to submit requests here. You'll get the same answer every time, and you'll only annoy the volunteers here.--Fabrictramp | talk to me\n\n· [revisions]\n\nElected as new MP for Brighton Kemptown (UK Parliament constituency).

Please add the new info accordingly. --Tikiwont (talk)\n\n· [revisions]\n\nWhen Volunteers with limited knowledge make decisions they are bound to waste time of every one. The admin here \"Cirt\" is kind of irresponsible. We are not begging here to undelete, we are demanding \"just undelete it\" and I want to see it done with this request.\n\nWhen contacted to admin the reason given here was sharing of accounts. When asked again no response and on the 2nd request there are two more violations listed Can you please list all your violations at once, Or you think as you go? --Biswaranjan.das (talk)\n\nNot done. This board is not a place to 'demand' anything' but merely a place for uncontroversial deletions and as a result of an AfD this by definition is not uncontroversial considering also Cirt's objection. The way forward is exactly the one outlined by Fabrictramp above. Start from a list of reliable sources that are not connected to your community, write a userspace draft based on them and bring it to deletion review because that is the place where we could correct it if necessary. --Tikiwont (talk)\n\nExample of reliable source? -Biswaranjan.das (talk)\n\nCan you give some example of reliable source?

Currently there's a discussion regarding the image, but until it's finished it should not be deleted. -MrStalker (talk)\n\nHello? The link isn't red but that's because a tag is placed there, not because it has been undeleted. --MrStalker (talk)\n\nThe discussion is at Talk:Beyond Good & Evil (video game)#Image and the argument is not yet resolved. Normally an unused fair use image would get a few days grace.

Cheers, Arbitrarily0 (talk)\n\nNot done - if consensus is gained to use the image in Beyond Good & Evil (video game), then the image may assuredly be restored. Since the image is not currently used however, restoring it at the present time would again subject it to the same deletion criteria. Best regards, Arbitrarily0 (talk)\n\nI understand, but it doesn't seem right to me that an admin uses his tools to delete the image, ignoring the 7 day holding time, without checking for consensus.

There are two issues here: every article needs references to confirm what it says - see verifiability - and that is the reason for the first notice on your talk page. But the reason the article was deleted is that it doesn't seem that he (yet) meets Wikipedia's notability standard for athletes - see WP:ATHLETE and for Australian Rules football WP:NSPORT#Australian Rules Football. The article says he is \"a viable option to debut in the AFL late in the season\" - once he has actually played in the AFL he can have an article.

This is an important example not only of how some of Europes best jazz musicians publish, but also of the changing face of improvised music publishing from minor labels to independent musician collectives. Please reinstate this page, it is valid. -Hrothrekr (talk)\n\nNot done. Companies and record labels also have to meet Wikipedia's requirement of notability by showing \"significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.\" This seems to be a new label which has only released one record; the only reference was to their own website.

The stub related to a single design of a UK folding plug which its designer has called \"Folding Plug\", it misled by implying that this was something new and unique. There has been much hype about Min-Kyu Choi's \"Folding Plug\" which has won several major design awards despite the fact that it is designed in a way which makes it ilegal to offer it for sale. I believe that it is important to tell the truth about this, and also to place Min-Kyu Choi's work in the context of the two other designs which hold precedence, one of which has already been approved for sale. My work on the article was in support of this conviction and I fail to understand why censorship has been imposed! The links to the (only) three companies engaged in this market were provided as verification of the facts, and to provide access to the relevant illustrations and demonstrations which are essential to understanding the issue. (I am unaware of any illustrations in the public domain.)

If he does not agree, you can take it to WP:Deletion review.

Jpatokal (talk)\n\nAlso, A7 was an invalid criterion in the first place: This criterion applies only to articles about web content and to articles about people, organizations, and individual animals themselves, not to articles about their books, albums, software, or other creative works, and we're talking about a honking big building on Singapore's main drag here.
