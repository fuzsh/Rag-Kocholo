        "text": "user_j_e\n\nOccasional Contributor\n\n13 years ago\n\nI was able to run individual tests from DevTest. There has to be a test item in TestComplete for DevTest to be able to select the individual test to run.\n\nOne of the main problems with the integration is you have to have DevTest installed on the machine that runs the automation. We have a workstation dedicated for automation which means you have to remote into the machine to run automation.\n\nSo we don't really use the integration but we have been using the DevTest API for a long time. It is more useful since the api can create test cycles."
