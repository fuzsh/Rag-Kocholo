Just couple of weeks back KSEB (Kerala state electricity board) advised public not to charge EV's from peak evening hours till mid night. Now Kerala is one state with almost near 100 percent electrification. We are still banking on old style electricity production and if sufficient rain fall doesn't happen we will have power cuts. Its just because elections are going on we don't have power cuts otherwise the state doesn't have enough electricity to provide for the increased supply.\n\nAnother issue is cost. For all who are moving to EV due to cost of Fossil Fuels forget the fact that more than 50 percent is taxes. When one of the major source of revenue for the government is the tax from fossil fuels do anyone think moving to EV is going to help reduce costs? The moment EV adoption picks pace and a percent of vehicles become EV's there will be huge taxes for electricity used for charging as well. Talks are already in progress in countries like UK to a new pay per mile tax system to offset the reduced taxes fro fossil fuels.\n\nI don't know why majority refrains from talking about these points.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2024\n\nLocation: Hyderabad\n\nPosts: 55\n\nThanked: 146 Times\n\nre: Cox Automotive: Despite huge discounts, EV sales are still not picking up\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by ashpkd\n\nAnother issue is cost.

Because major chunk of EV enthusiasts are EV evangelists. They would not like to talk about the practicality of EVs.\n\nA simple petrol bunk with one pump could service 12-15 cars (modestly) in 30 minutes, giving them approx 600-800 km range. One the other hand, a single EV charging port can service only single EV car with questionable range. This is one of the, if not the biggest hindrance to EV adoption.\"The infrastructure\" , every EV enthusiast is waiting for to happen, is never going to happen. It's not happening in western Europe even today with their ev mandates, so the rest of the world can forget about it.\n\nAlso to maintain \"load\" capacity of the grid , the distribution company would levy charges on a particular installation anticipating their supposed demand. Anyone with multiple A/Cs in their household would have seen \"slab rates\" in their monthly electricity bill (indifferent to their usage). The distribution company anticipates the usage and charges accordingly even though the demand is not there . This is to maintain the load on the grid, so that grid won't collapse. So an EV charging station with multiple charging ports would incur huge overhead cost (whether the business is happening or not). This would defer anyone trying create a business model of establishing EV charging stations. Again infra to charge is not going to happen.\n\nA randomised, heavier adoption of EVs in California caused massive load on their grids that their \"EV concouraging progressive govt\" had to ask their residents to stop charging EVs after 4 p.m.\n\nThese are not propaganda points, this is simple economics.There are many practical hindrances to adopt EVs on a mass scale. Hybrids can top EVs though.\n\nLast edited by Earthroamer : 23rd April 2024 at 22:10.\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2011\n\nLocation: Bombay\n\nPosts: 1,938\n\nThanked: 15,783 Times\n\nre: Cox Automotive: Despite huge discounts, EV sales are still not picking up\n\nI think we are getting overly coloured by the travails that EVs are facing in one market around the world, The United States.\n\nSadly, EVs have become a political football in the US, with Republicans seeing them as Woke Democrat Vehicles, and hence not making an objective assessment of how good they are to drive and their suitability for their own use case. And the largest EV seller is losing ground with Democrats because its owner is seen as having got in bed with the Racist Right Wing Fringe. Amazingly, in the midst of this battle, the original Woke Democrat Vehicles aka the Hybrid (plug in or strong) is seen as the sensible middle ground!\n\nIn a market like India, the economics are completely different. The cost of using an EV is 10% the cost of using petrol vehicles. And the cost of producing EVs is falling continuously which will over time help obviate the need for the very material tax advantage that EVs have with just 5% GST vs as much as 53% for ICE cars. I dont see the government preserving current lower taxes on EVs forever - they are more likely to raise taxes gradually such that the price premium of EVs over ICE vehicles is maintained and the TCO for EVs remains a steady percentage below that of ICE vehicles. So those worrying about resale value are probably fretting too soon, except if their replacement cycle is 2-3 years.\n\nAnd to the question some people have raised on battery replacement costs, almost all EV producers give a 8 year /160,000 km warranty on batteries - so no one needs to worry till then. And the reason manufacturers give this warranty is not social service, it is because there is ample data to show that batteries last for more than 500,000 kms. Further for those who worry about the 8 year warranty term, the fact is that the residual value of diesel cars in NCR for example is near zero after 10 years. While most EVs will last comfortably beyond that, and I suspect we will find insurers stepping in with extended warranty plans once they have data regarding battery failure rates after 8 years.\n\nSo yes, there is a fall in EV sales in the USA. But that is irrelevant for India and Indians where EV sales are only likely to boom for the next several years.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2022\n\nLocation: Mumbai\n\nPosts: 59\n\nThanked: 172 Times\n\nre: Cox Automotive: Despite huge discounts, EV sales are still not picking up\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Hayek\n\nI think we are getting overly coloured by the travails that EVs are facing in one market around the world, The United States.\n\nGermany is expecting BEV sales to drop for the first time in 2024. Similar story in England and few other European countries too.\n\nIn fact it's the other way round - we are getting overly excited by the success of BEVs in one market - China. This market has identified two key advantages - Using LFP instead of NMC and cutting costs using economies of scale.\n\nMercedes in 2021 stated that in 2024 they will use LFP in at least EQA and EQB. That story is still just that - a story. BMW also hasn't adopted LFPs. Some smaller car companies have started to source LFPs from BYD but still vast majority of BEVs outside of China use NMC.\n\nBYD Atto 3 sells at 35 lacs to 40 lacs in most markets (India, Australia, South Africa, Europe etc). It sells at just 16 lacs in China. What do we get for 16 lacs in India or what do Europeans get for 16 lacs in Europe?\n\nBottomline is the legacy brands are too slow to maneuver in fast changing BEV technologies (maybe in 5 years Sodium based solid state batteries may replace LFPs - just don't see Koreans or Germans nimble enough to keep changing BMS, software etc every 3 to 5 years) and Tesla just doesn't provide any options to choose from (they are stubborn to not even offer a cover for the sunroof / glass roof which even Maruti offers) - Elon is like it's my way or the highway. Also, Tesla has made enough of false commitments (Model 2 launch date or Cyber truck launch date) for markets to now take them seriously, especially with regards to timelines of new launches.\n\nI'll stick my neck out and claim that Tesla will go the Black berry way. In the late 2000s everyone on Wall Street wanted a black berry - just like how everyone in Silicon Valley wants a Tesla.\n\nComing to India - it's an insignificant BEV market. Up or down doesn't make any meaningful difference to any car maker. Also, most carmakers are just \"assembling\" BEVs in India where battery sourcing is done from someone else and there's some proprietary retained on the software side.\n\nTime is ripe for a Ola moment (or Xiaomi moment) for 4 wheeler BEVs in India - legacy brands don't have it in their DNA to make BEV transition successful in India or anywhere else.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2023\n\nLocation: Palakkad\n\nPosts: 483\n\nThanked: 1,581 Times\n\nre: Cox Automotive: Despite huge discounts, EV sales are still not picking up\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Earthroamer\n\nYes.

One the other hand, a single EV charging port can service only single EV car with questionable range.\n\nI have owned an EV for about 1.5 years, done 27272 Km as of today and do you know how many times I have gone to the fast charger. A grand total of 5 times of which once to just make sure that the fast charging is working. We have sold our 20 year old zen and now only have an electric car. Apart from the usual office-home commute, I have been doing Palakkad-Kozhikode-Palakkad regularly (once every 3 weeks) about 260 +\n\nKM round trip done on a single day on single charge (SOC of about 100-30) I have found the drive to be comfortable and would be cursing my self if I have to do this on an ICE car.\n\nI am not sure if this is practical for you but for majority of the car users this is more than enough. Like many in kerala I have independent parking with a simple 16 amps plug and\n\nthis is good enough. The 7.2 KW charger is a bonus. Once I had to come back from a trip to Kozhikode and then go to thrissur. Got a good 20% topup from my 7.2 Kw charger and took a nap during the time.\n\nSo the real infrastructure change that we need is ubiquitous slow charging network (15 amps plug would do but 7.2 is very good). Not few very fast charging network.\n\nLast edited by electric_eel : 23rd April 2024 at 23:04.

I can already foresee some brickbats and comments coming my way. Haha, but, I won't mince my words.\n\nSeriously, think about it. When companies say that BEVs will achieve price parity with that of ICE vehicles, it invariably means that they will raise prices of ICEs so much that we are made to believe BEV car prices are on par with ICE. The price of BEVs will never come down. The price of ICE vehicles will be jacked up and consumers like us will be fooled in to buying this argument.\n\nWhoever thinks that there is enough proven reserves of all rare earth minerals on this planet to electrify the entire automobile industry must be living in a fool's paradise. Nobody is talking about the impact on environment while mining these rare earth minerals.\n\nPeople should never forget that at the end of the day Elon baba is a capitalist and will go to any lengths to make more money for himself and his investors. His aim is NOT to decarbonise the planet, but to make money.\n\nThink twice before you listen to any industrialist/capitalist.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2022\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 83\n\nThanked: 204 Times\n\nInfractions: 0/1 (5)\n\nRe: Cox Automotive: Despite huge discounts, EV sales are still not picking up\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Hayek\n\nI think we are getting overly coloured by the travails that EVs are facing in one market around the world, The United States.\n\n.\n\nWhile I agree with your point about the politicization of EVs in the USA, the rest of your argument unfortunately is tainted with too many self-serving assumptions and selective cherry-picking of data to prove your case.\n\nThere's no evidence that the cost of EV production will drop significantly enough with economies of scale to catch up with ICE vehicles, especially when the content of exotic minerals (some of them rare-earths) in them is so high, not to mention their ecological and social impact in some of the poorest African nations that they come from.\n\nAs regards Total Cost of Ownership - if you do the math rigorously enough, I suspect that the figure will be close to double that of similar ICE vehicles, not 10% as you so optimistically claim, particularly if you consider resale values (more so closer to warranty expiry) . Note that I am completely discounting the lifestyle adjustments that accompany EV ownership, especially when it comes to long intercity trips.\n\nAlso, your reference to the 10-year life of diesel vehicles in NCR is not only irrelevant in the national context, it also disregards the fact that most diesel NCR vehicles are sold and re-registered in other states around the eight-year mark, not to mention the fact that most new car buyers in NCR have moved on to petrol/hybrid cars since the stupid NGT rule came in.\n\nLastly, your assumption that insurers will step in with lucrative insurance plans for EVs once enough data is available is cute, but backed up with very little hard data. The risk that insurers underwrite is based on real-world data, not on idealistic assumptions about a utopian future.\n\nI am trying very hard to become an EV fanboy, but dodgy data and lack of little real-world street-cred come in the way...\n\nLast edited by vijaysrk : 24th April 2024 at 01:21.\n\nBANNED\n\nJoin Date: Nov 2006\n\nLocation: Vizag\n\nPosts: 2,638\n\nThanked: 3,628 Times\n\nRe: Cox Automotive: Despite huge discounts, EV sales are still not picking up\n\nI see many negative sentiments being expressed over EV 's future.

How Dieselgate, stricter emissions, DPF issues are sounding death-knell of diesels. How, going forward, we will not see any new investments/developments in diesel engine/tech and how we have to contend with existing tech that would keep powering our cars until EVs finally take over.\n\nSame with petrols. My cousins from North America keep lamenting how gasoline muscle cars are dying one by one. Dodge Challenger V8s are gone. Lot of others, too. They're being replaced by EV muscle cars. Haven't Ford, GM, Stellantis halted further developments on gas engines and are even pulling plugs on existing gas models and bringing out only EV versions of those?\n\nBack home, here in India, look at the pathetic line-up of petrol engines available on your average family cars. They start at 800, 1000, 1200, 1500 cc NA engines. Same engines that they have been peddling for past 15 years. All under-powered and all yawn-inducing, to drive. Turbos? Sure but a 4-pot 1.5 Turbos' starting price is near 25 lakhs on-road (for AT variant). And, I don't like the 3-pot vibrator turbos we see sitting under the 4-pot turbos. Among other reasons, lack of good petrol engines is what pushed me towards EV. And I'm glad I bought an EV. Faster, cheaper (to run), seamless acceleration and silent. What's not to like?\n\nNow that some people are writing obituaries of EVs, will we see investments pouring into development of new powerful-and-yet-frugal-to-run ICE engines? Will the manufacturers start work on new-age petrols/diesels that they had stopped working on? I doubt. I think we have moved past ICE, as far as development is concerned. At the most they will keep pushing the existing tech and keep buying time. The Chinese and Americans are invested into EVs big time. They're not giving up any time soon. Chinese are churning out model after model, even as we speak. I don't think all this will die. Maybe there will be govt-negotiated tax-cuts and price corrections. But EVs will stay.\n\nManufacturing an EV is much much easier/simpler than manufacturing an ICE car or scooter. The reason why EV industry has seen a mushrooming growth. Fewer parts, lesser inventory, shorter assembly lines. Sure there will be market shake-up and some manufacturers will slip under the waves and only the biggies will survive. But the industry will weather the storm, if we can call it that (I feel it's only a temporary dip). Also, as seen in the recent past, even traditional ICE car manufacturers like Germans, Volvo, Jags, Rolls, Ferrari etc have been ramping up their EV line-ups, some even announcing that some models will be EV-only. Will they will abandon their plans?\n\nOn a side note, the most beautiful part about EVs is a manufacturer's ability to tweak a car's performance, torque, acceleration, range etc. by just Over-the-Air updates. An ICE car makers will have to go through a major engine design overhaul to alter these parameters. An ICE car owner wanting to boost performance will have to get aftermarket performance-enhancing kits like Pete's etc.\n\nAnyway, ending a long post here. And,..speaking for myself, I feel very very happy that I bought an EV and, going forward too, I will only buy an EV, unless they stop making or unless they price them high. For me, gains far outweigh the charging need.\n\nNewbie\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2024\n\nLocation: Gurugram\n\nPosts: 22\n\nThanked: 35 Times\n\nRe: Cox Automotive: Despite huge discounts, EV sales are still not picking up\n\nI echo what GTO said, petrol and diesel are here to stay for a long time.\n\nTrue EV adoption in a country like ours will only happen when public transportation becomes fully EV. Before this any EV numbers that we are seeing are just luxury statements. Also not t0 forget that our electricity generation primarily depends on fossil fuel so from a green POV it is mostly shifting the pollution issue from one place to another.\n\nThe Chinese story is here to grow and we will see more offerings from them as we are seeing mushroom growth of electric scooters and bikes. Our own or established manufactures I feel are more inclined towards EV offering that makes a statement. Really who needs an electric Harrier or XUV 700.e9 or whatever, to drive adoption, people need EV Alto, Wagon R etc. but no the establish manufacturers wants high end vehicles to be EVs. No wonder sales will not be setting charts on fire anytime soon.\n\nPlus ours is a price sensitive market and people think petrol and diesel are necessity for their commute, same folks when they see an increase in electricity bill go crazy. So you can imagine that with growing adoption of EVs the electricity rates will also go up. All in all it will be tough few years ahead for EVs."
