        "text": "BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2021\n\nLocation: Lucknow\n\nPosts: 308\n\nThanked: 1,104 Times\n\nRe: Cox Automotive: Despite huge discounts, EV sales are still not picking up\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by ashpkd\n\nFor all who are moving to EV due to cost of Fossil Fuels forget the fact that more than 50 percent is taxes. When one of the major source of revenue for the government is the tax from fossil fuels do anyone think moving to EV is going to help reduce costs?\n\nImporting foreign crude in dollar is a huge drain on forex, Im not as versed with economics as others, here so surely those who are versed, can pitch in whats better  keeping money in country or spending it to import oil from OPEC/ME https://www.thehindubusinessline.com...53678.ece/amp/\n\nBefore people come in with but we also import cells from China (mind you, not batteries  but cells, which are then assembled into the pack with cooling and wiring in India itself  at least for Tata, Mahindra MG, the three sales leaders)\n\n1. Cell import is one time import for lifetime of vehicle. ICE/hybrid requires constant import for lifetime of vehicle. Acc to my 10K km per year in nexon EV saves 684L of crude import.\n\n2. The cells are recyclable, circular economy possible. Oil is not. It is burnt away after usage.\n\n10y saving of crude import (6840L) worth ₹7000 a barrel for 43 barrels is almost ₹3L, double the subsidy I received.\n\nHow much saving on crude does hybrid offer again? Can it justify lower taxation/subsidy, as being demanded by certain manufacturers, on per litre crude saved basis,?\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by soarersc300\n\nI'll stick my neck out and claim that Tesla will go the Black berry way. In the late 2000s everyone on Wall Street wanted a black berry - just like how everyone in Silicon Valley wants a Tesla.\n\nI fear they have already attained the status of Apple of EVs, with the exception of having a CEO with too much social media presence and too little restraint.\n\nQuote:\n\nTime is ripe for a Ola moment (or Xiaomi moment) for 4 wheeler BEVs in India - legacy brands don't have it in their DNA to make BEV transition successful in India or anywhere else.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by shortbread\n\nThe EV price correction is long overdue and manufacturers need to wakeup and accept this when launching future products.\n\nTata and Mahindra have significant ICE sales still. Even if the dealers may not be as hostile as American dealers, (who dont keep evs charged up for test drive or deliberately push FUD to convert EV sale to a hybrid/ICE sale), they are still bound to keep dealers happy and that means maintaining safe distance (in terms of price gap) from ICE lineup, lest dealer revenue falls and they revolt like USA.\n\nAlready, for the checkup and diagnosis, we pay ₹2000-2500, which while lesser than ICE cars, is still ridiculous for plugging in OBD and clearing error codes. Again protectionism for dealer margin in service sector.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Simha.k\n\nI must appreciate Toyota for holding on their horses and not investing heavily in rampant electrification of their line-up.\n\nQuote:\n\nPeople should never forget that at the end of the day Elon baba is a capitalist and will go to any lengths to make more money for himself and his investors. His aim is NOT to decarbonise the planet, but to make money. Think twice before you listen to any industrialist/capitalist.\n\nThe two quotes dont look good next to each other, especially at a time when Toyota squandered boatloads of money on :\n\n1. lobbying govts to reduce emissions standards https://electrek.co/2021/04/20/toyot...t-climate-evs/\n\n2. sponsoring smear campaigns against EVs https://cleantechnica.com/2021/09/08...vation-really/\n\n3. distributing primary school books with company propaganda like this vid (absolutely unforgivable to brainwash children) https://electrek.co/2021/11/11/how-t...anda-in-japan/\n\n4. forcefully stopping development of evs under pressure from oil barons https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_...lectric_Car%3F\n\nAfter considering all this, why should Elon musk and EV makers be singled out? Should that not apply to all companies including Toyota? Surely Toyota is also making money, theyre not doing charity here.\n\nQuote:\n\nWhoever thinks that there is enough proven reserves of all rare earth minerals on this planet to electrify the entire automobile industry must be living in a fool's paradise.\n\nAs members of an esteemed car forum, I feel we should not use scientific terms so loosely and casually without understanding their meaning.\n\nWe dont like it when people mix up drift and powerslide, or AWD and 4WD, right? Then why not the same adherence to correct terminology when it comes to EVs?\n\nAs it stands, only 17 rare earth metals exist on periodic table. Only 1 is of remote importance to EVs ie Neodymium, an element which can make very strong magnets.\n\nOur pleb EVs do just fine with ferrite magnets, only ultra high performance EVs use Neodymium magnets, that too only if they dont already use Induction Motors like Model S which eliminates the magnet part altogether.\n\nLithium is quite a lot more abundant than any of these actual rare earth metals (which is why it is not named as one).\n\nAnother misconception is that somehow batteries are in several quintals so it must use a LOT of lithium. Spoiler Alert : Li is not even the top 3 elements by mass. That would be Copper, Aluminium and Graphite order switching possible. https://elements.visualcapitalist.co...an-ev-battery/\n\n10kWh battery uses ~1kg lithium as rule of thumb. That puts our best selling evs from Tiago to ZS at 2-5kg lithium at most. (Recyclable while at that)\n\nCompare that to how much oil a similar car may use for same period (1.6L km), youll see which one needs more mining. Lithium, or the thousands of litres of crude oil, pumped out from oil rigs in middle of sea, transported by ships running on lowest distillate ie bunker oil, carrying it to refineries which burn more of same oil or gas or to heat the distillation chambers, and then transport on trucks/trains again to depots and finally to fuel stations.\n\nIts kinda lopsided to count only TAILPIPE for ICE, but both, Power plants and Battery production for EV, while conveniently ignoring oil production, and mislabelling battery materials while at that for sensationalism.\n\nQuote:\n\nNobody is talking about the impact on environment while mining these rare earth minerals.\n\nHmm, and yet social media is flooded with car meme pages posting diamond mines and gold mines masquerading as lithium mines. I wonder why no one is subvertedly spreading misinformation about EVs under garb of humour and memes which people actually take seriously to form opinions about EVs.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by CJ78\n\nEV's in India will have demand only when the underlying Infrastructure support fast charging and is easily available whenever needed. Still, see people are thinking to purchase EV atleast for city commutes.\n\nPlease do check PlugShare app or website, just as awareness exercise even if youre not going to buy EV.\n\nIt lists almost all chargers in India in one place. There are almost 5500+ DCFC and 2500+ slow chargers in India (and multitudes more undocumented 15A sockets) https://expwithevs.substack.com/p/2402-charging-infra\n\nQuote:\n\nHowever, we as large country need to lookout for alternative sources of energy generation as relying on Coal for power generation will not suffice in long run.\n\nWe are on track for that as well. Grid has 60-40% split of fossil and renewable power. ICE will always use 100% fossil power only, even in hybrid since the self charging part burns fuel in the tank. 40% green power is already quite good, and we are on track to add more with time. https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIfram...is%20unmatched.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by shortbread\n\nWhile people try to say slowing demand is an EV only phenomenon, just check the massive discounts on the Vitara and Hyryder pure Hybrid variants. Rest assured when the year finishes EVs will still be the fastest growing segment, especially if we get a breakdown of the pure Hybrid variant sales of Vitara and Hyryder.\n\nWe have the breakup, 38K Hycross, 3K invicto, 23K Hyry, 13K GV, rest <5000. Total 82K vs BEV at 92K. https://www.autopunditz.com/post/ele...20respectively.\n\nThe interesting part to microanalyse is Innova, and Invicto situation.\n\nPremise 1 :\n\nInnova brand is strong. Would it sell similar amount even without hybrid as seen in past? Would lack of hybrid been a dealbreaker?\n\nPremise 2 :\n\nThe reason for premise 1 is premise 2, ie Invicto. Almost same car. No brand value. Sells <10% of Innova hybrid sales.\n\nAnecdotal conclusion :\n\n1. Hycross would not sell as good if it wasnt a Toyota and an Innova. Case in point : failure of invicto\n\n2. Invicto does not sell well, despite having hybrid, so surely, hybrid is not as big a contributing factor to sales as much as the brand image is. Even though Maruti itself is known for kitna deti hai, not Toyota which ironically sells more.\n\nAnother interesting thing is how little the CSUV hybrids make up for sales of their overall portfolio. GV 2023 sales : 113K. Hybrid models among this figure : 13K, or just ~11%.\n\nhttps://www.team-bhp.com/forum/india...ml#post5697470 (Indian Car Annual Sales Analysis for the year 2023)\n\nComparatively, Nexon EV (similar pricing to GV strong) sold 21K units over total nexon sales of ~150K in 2023, ie ~15%\n\nQuote:\n\nThe issue is that even now Mahindra is chasing the premium end with future EV launches rather than provide credible alternatives like they do in the mainstream ICE SUV space.\n\nThey seem to be emulating the top down approach from western companies eyeing the fat margins on costlier cars.\n\nProblem is that India has far lesser market for top down approach to be successful. They should and must have a Punch rival at least. And a creta rival (would 3XO EV go into Nexon segment and 4XO for creta segment, we can only imagine)\n\nTheir minimum EV is 15L XUV3XO/4XO but nothing below this, that is the problem. Costlier vehicle are not a problem as long as cheaper vehicles compliment them at every price point. KUV100 was killed so was every hope for Tiago competitor from Mahindra.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2021\n\nLocation: Lucknow\n\nPosts: 308\n\nThanked: 1,104 Times\n\nRe: Cox Automotive: Despite huge discounts, EV sales are still not picking up\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by pgsagar\n\nExcellent write-up with wealth of data! If this doesn't silence a hardcore EV critic then I don't know what will.\n\nActually, most of the average EV users may seldom (or even never) have to look for a fast charger. Home charging is enough to meet daily need. How many people drive more than 200 KMs a day? Those who do, do not buy EV.\n\nAnd, you didn't add Solar-power harnessing. State after state are going for it in a big way. What about individuals charging their cars using roof-top solar panels.\n\nThanks\n\nI am one of them, Ive had a 3kW on grid setup since mid-2021 just before going EV, and Ive not paid a single penny since for driving. Home usage is already covered pretty well by solar net metering. I export more than I use.\n\nI do use DCFC on highway once in a while, maybe 4-5 times a year. The only time Ive used public charging in hometown is for verifying the charger listings on apps and checking in on PlugShare for others.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by SKC-auto\n\nthe oil industry has just hijacked the climate change discussion. Dubai or Saudi hosting COP meetings is just laughable.\n\nthe oil industry has trillions of money, spending few billions on negative campaigns on EVs is easy.\n\nI still remember how during my school days, we used to make posters like conserve oil save electricity, chapters on global warming and the images of oil spills and what not.\n\nYet whenever I go around on social media, everyone seems to be talking only about how dirty batteries are, while probably using, ironically, a battery powered laptop or phone.\n\nIt seems to me as if me and them studied entirely different things in EVS (environmental science) in middle school. Or they didnt study at all.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by GutsyGibbon\n\nDW just released a documentary about a 40year old smear campaign\n\nThe half truths spread by big oil and ICE companies is just way too pervasive. This element of doubt they have sown in the minds of the public has been possible because of a long, concerted, and expensive campaign.\n\nThanks, the video reveals just how much lobbying and underhanded measure the oil industry is ready to take to ensure their cash flow.\n\nWhat sticks out to me is how much lack of transparency exists in oil supply chain.\n\nEven today you can go to Google and get hundreds of results on how EV battery production is devil incarnate. But the only results you get when searching for emissions from oil supply chain, is obscure scholarly articles or nothing at all.\n\nI tried to search about cobalt usage in desulphurisation of crude oil, and this is what a (supposed) insider on Reddit had to say about it : https://www.reddit.com/r/oil/comment...ion/?rdt=40490\n\nQuote:\n\n>I work for a company that designs HDS units and sells HDS catalyst.\n\n> Basically what you are asking are trade secrets, so I can't give you a straight answer. You can however, do some research online of refining training courses to get a ballpark answer. You need to find:\n\n>The average Co content in a HDS catalyst; you can find some typical formulations online.\n\nThe fuel volume (diesel + kero + naphtha) sold annually.\n\n>The average catalyst life expectancy, which varies between services and licensors. As a hint, I can tell you that your average CoMo catlayst can be regenerated a few times before it's dead.\n\n>The average LHSV of a HDS reactor. This is the most technical part.\n\nThat should do it.\n\nIts absolutely unreal how little sources are there regarding this, the limited ones that are present are paywalled research articles.\n\nThe ones which arent are basically some version of its a trade secret so we cant tell you how much cobalt we use. How convenient isnt it?\n\nThe narrative building by oil industry is so strong that majority does not even know that cobalt is used in oil refining, let alone question it, yet they will parrot about child labour in Congo, in the comments of an LFP powered EV review, which does not even use cobalt\n\nIts good that they question EV battery production, there certainly needs to be accountability for everything. Whats bad is the complete silence over the logical analog, ie oil production.\n\nNo one seems to be talking about it in any discussion or even in so called studies and research articles about EV vs ICE. I wonder who sponsors such studies which deliberately ignore oil production"
