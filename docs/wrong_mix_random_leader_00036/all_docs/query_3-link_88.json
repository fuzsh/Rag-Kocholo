Web server farms have always been known for providing high application availability in a cost-efficient manner. Unfortunately, in the past they have also been known for manageability headaches. But no more: Microsoft Application Center 2000 now makes managing Web applications and groups of Web servers as simple as managing a single server. Part of the flexible Microsoft.NET Enterprise Server family, Application Center 2000 is built to be the heart of a \"scale-out\" infrastructure model. \"Scaling out\" is a flexible approach to scalability that involves deploying Web applications across multiple servers to distribute and handle the workload. Application Center 2000 makes scaling out easier, with unified Web application and server-farm management that simplifies tasks like cluster management and iindows\" application deployment. Plus, it makes it easy to achieve capacity on demand through automatic replication of applications when you add servers or make changes to existing applications. But I I simplicity is not all you get: Application Center 2000 offers increased uptime through dynamic load balancing and by having no single point of failure. In sum, Application Center 2000 removes the hassle of managing multiple servers separately, while providing the availability and cost-efficiency of a \"scale-out\" model.

We get stacks and stacks of letters. — \"The CBS Mailbag Song\" It's been a busy month for e-mail and newsgroup postings — some positive, some negative, a lot wait-and-see. Of course, that wasn't unexpected in light of the magazine's recent name change. The reaction to the name change has largely mirrored the re- action of developers to Visual Studio .NET. Those who think Microsoft is moving in the right direction with .NET and are ex- cited about the capabilities of that tool have generally welcomed the changes to the magazine. Those who think Microsoft has made a misstep with VS.NET generally feel the magazine is exac- erbating Microsoft's misstep with one of its own. I thought I'd share some of this feedback, both to invite more and to provide a window into what kinds of changes your fellow readers are requesting. I'm also hoping others will use this as an opportunity to tell us what kind of magazine they want to see. I've chosen a handful of posts from the Talk to the Editors fo- rum — posts that are representative of the range of opinions we've received on the subject. The first e-mail comes from Michael Welch, who responded positively to the change: \"I think the change is great. One maga- zine that covers many of the topics I'm interested in sounds great. I don't want five different magazines covering VB, C#, SQL, XML, ADO, the .NET Framework, and so on. Having one magazine that not only addresses several technologies, but some of the best ways to integrate them, sounds fantastic. Truth- fully, I don't see how effective it would be to keep them all sepa- rate for much longer.\" Larry Linson weighed in at the other end of the spectrum: \"I tolerated the 'other subjects' introduced into Visual Basic Pro- grammer's Journal after it apparently decided that 'enterprise so- lutions' were the only thing that mattered and everything else was just Getting Started or '101' — beginner stuff. I tolerated that be- cause there was still enough, barely, of the level of VB that I use that would be helpful to me. Further diluting the content with everything VS, especially with an emphasis on .NET (which, AFAIK, is only in beta still), cannot help but reduce the coverage of interest to me below the level warranting a subscription.\" Dan Fergus took a more wait-and-see approach. Responding to a poster who requested we expand the number of pages in Visual Studio Magazine, Dan wrote, \"I don't think they are Patrick Meader Editor in Chief What do you want to read about? Tell me at ednote® fawcette.com, or the mag- azine's editors at vsmedit® fawcette.com. going to triple the page count. If some of the articles are Stu- dio or namespace related, they can cover both VB and C# pro- grammers and still be useful. Maybe one-third VB, one-third C#, and one-third Visual Stu- dio topics. I could live with that! I'll have to wait and see how it falls out before I call Patrick and yell at him!\" The prospect of being yelled at notwithstanding, I appreciate the feedback offered so far. I wish everyone felt as Michael Welch does, but I would settle for every- one to feel as Dan Fergus does — to look at the new magazine care- fully, then let us know what you like and don't like. For those who feel as Larry Linson does, let us know which kinds of articles you want to read about in the magazine — it's the surest way to find them and the mix you want in the future. I'd also like to reiterate that over time, we'll adjust the mix so it's representative of what you use Visual Studio for — in other words, your feedback is important. The hardest part of this job is figuring out what readers want. Readers who write in and tell you what they want to read do the hard part for you. In such cases, I occasionally follow the advice of filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, who once said the best way to critique a movie is to make another movie. In other words, it can be an opportunity to invite a critic to write the article he or she wants to read. Of course, you don't have to write an article if you want to see a particular subject appear in the magazine. Instead, you can visit our research site at www.ftpresearch.com/vsmag, which we'll update monthly as each issue ships. This month, one ran- dom respondent will win a Palm V.

PC HUr.fl/INl BPJ ^ InstallShield SOFTWARE CORPORATION Pop Quiz You're a developer. Therefore, you have a nasally voice, a pocket protector, a complete inability to relate with people, an almost supernatural gift for breaking through security measures (coupled, by the way, with a disregard for oth- ers' privacy), and an intense love of math. What? That's all (or at least mostly) wrong? Of course it is. I'm not exactly sure where the programmer-as-hopeless-geek- outcast stereotype came from {Revenge of the Nerds had a lot to do with it, is my guess), but I do have a hunch that — like other professionals — we share a number of preferences and experiences that give us a certain general character. That character just hap- pens to be a lot different than what most people think. So, here are some questions you can ask yourself, then ask other developers you know. See if you fit the same mold. E-mail me (realitycheck@fawcette.com) with your answers and conclu- sions. As an incentive, I'll send a PlayStation 2 — I haven't been able to get my hands on an Xbox yet — to someone at random. I'm interested to see how we're the same . . . and different. How did you get started? What was the first program (apart from \"Hello World\") you ever wrote, approximately how many lines of code did it require, and what language did you use? Bo- nus: Do you remember the first time you sat at a desktop com- puter? What computer was it, and when? Secret Bonus: Did you ever use punchcards? If so, how did you stay sane? Why are you here? Do you remember making a conscious decision to be a developer, or did you just sort of slide into the role? If the former, describe what made you want to be a pro- grammer. If the latter, explain the (probably bizarre) set of cir- cumstances leading you to where you are today. How important is college? Do you have a formal computer- science-related degree? If not, do you envy those who do? If you do, do you feel your education has made you a better program- mer? Bonus: Is there a point of diminishing returns in college- level programming instruction? For example, does having a doc- torate in computer science mean you're a guru, or does it mean you've been out of the trenches too long? What do you like? Which part of the development process do you like best? Designing the program? Writing new code? Troubleshooting? Streamlining existing apps? What do you like about it? Bonus: Which part do you hate most? How much does money matter? Are you programming more because you love to program or because there's good money in it? Would you still be a programmer if it paid, say, about the same as being an elementary school teacher? Elden Nelson Editor How are you the same as — and different than— other developers? Write to me at realitycheck® fawcette.com. How do you explain your- self? You're talking with some- body who clearly doesn't have the foggiest notion of what a pro- gram is, much less what a pro- grammer does. This person wants to know what you do for a living. Do you get extremely vague (\"Oh, I work with computers ...\"), or do you settle in and try to make him or her understand? Bonus: Recount, in detail, how you made (or failed to make) this person understand. Do you like math? Everyone thinks that because you're a pro- grammer, you must be a math wiz. Are you? What would you have done for a living 200 years ago? The first floppy disk won't be on store shelves 'til looooong after you're dead. What do you do instead? Have you ever hacked? Have you ever used your program- ming skills to do something you shouldn't have? If so, do you now regret it? If not, are you sometimes tempted? Bonus: One of the most common things you see computer programmers do in movies is break codes. Could you — right this instant, without doing a bunch of research — do this, if you wanted to? What's your proudest programming moment? At some point, you wrote a program — or part of a program — that proves you're a genius. Did anybody else recognize your Einstein mo- ment? Bonus: Did you go out of your way to make sure some- body recognized your development epiphany? What's your biggest moment of programming shame? At some point, you (probably) wrote something you now realize is complete trash. Did you realize it was garbage at the time? Did you fess up? Does it still haunt you at night? What's the best trade show swag you've ever received? Surely you've admitted to yourself that one of the reasons you go to trade shows is to pick up the free stuff. What's the coolest free thing you've ever gotten? What would you say to set the record straight? A major network calls you and says they've reserved two minutes of air- time for you to explain to the world what developers are really like. What do you say?

Newer * Better In regards to Reality Check, \"Are You a Techno-Retro-Grouch?\" by Elden Nelson [Visual Basic Programmer's Journal August 2001]: The problem, as I see it, is one of attitude. I think a lot of programmers be- lieve programming is about technology, when it's really the other way around — technology is about programming. It's a way to get certain things done faster and not really the end in itself. Libraries and frame- works and platforms will never be a substi- tute for creativity and perseverance. People seem more interested in acquiring a long list ofacronyms (XML, JSP, EJB ...) rather than acquiringadeep understanding of the means of creating algorithms and machine archi- tecture. Without knowledge of these two things, it's difficult to do much more than assemble some configuration of a prefabri- cated machine. I see a lot of new applications but few new concepts. Maybe I am a techno-retro- grouch, but to be one at the age of 26 seems a sad commentary. It's not that I want to go back to hand-crafting 3-D graphics algo- rithms in 8088 assembler or that I believe you're not a programmer if you don't code in C. I'm just a little saddened when I meet programmers who cannot appreciate the beauty of a game such as Pong. Marvin Wilson, New York I became tired of the incessant and increas- ing \"progress\" in technology around the time Windows debuted. Every few months, there's a new operating system and a new language version. We learn HTML and out comes XML. We learn VB6 and out comes VB.NET. We learn Access and they want Oracle. We have no time to devote to appli- cations due to system software updates. I don't see how anyone has the time (or ability) to keep up with this nonsense. Re- cently, VBPJ had an article on VB.NET and its differences from VB6 [\"Drill Down on VB.NET\" by James Foxall, February 2001]. Our current code won't work. I sighed when I learned about the demise of control arrays and considered the redundant code neces- sary to replace them. And then, the bomb- shell. No native file support! WHAT? I can't access a simple flat file? No byte-stream I/O? That means I can't use VB.NET. It also means I won 't use it. I have had enough. I'm getting out. I retired last month, and shall use VB6 at home until it rots, at which time I shall revert to paper and pen. Dave Westfall, Southfield, Mich. VB Does Graphics, Too Thank you so much for the article \"Take Control of DirectX\" by Jonny Anderson [Visual Basic Programmer's Journal June 2001]. In the past, so much of your maga- zine was devoted to databases, it really was a breath of fresh air to see an article on graph- ics. VB is capable of so much more. My hat is off to you.

How does one go about learning .NET? Expensive courses and conferences? Books? Articles? Regardless, it is essential to first leam the core concepts of .NET. That is the foundation on w inch you can base further learning, and that's the focus of my new book \"Moving to VB.NET: Strategies, Concepts and Code\". You can read the introduction and sample text at www.desaware.com. There you'll also read about Spy Works 6.3 with .NET support, VersionStamper's support for .NET applications that use COM components, and new products designed specifically for .NET Dan NT Service Toolkit Full featured services with VB6! Visual Basic programmers have long searched for a good way to create NT Services using Visual Basic. Yet every solution they found had serious limitations and compromises - until now. Desaware's NT Service Toolkit provides all the power of a C++ service from VB - but the services are far easier to create and debug! • Debug your service using the VB environment - while it is running as a service! • Automatic background threads for waiting on NT synchronization objects. • Access and control services through COM or DCOM • Expose client objects via COM or DCOM. • Client objects run on a thread pool for scalability. • Create background threads for asynchronous operations. • Create control panel applets to manage your services. • All service notifications (including those new to Win 2000). • Simulator allows testing without installing as a service. • Impersonation allows acting on behalf of clients. • Access to all service configuration parameters. Escape DLL Hell! VersionStamper helps eliminate incompatibility problems that can occur when distributing component based applications - including .NET applications that use COM components Your application can analyze a client system using an embedded dependency list or data from your Web or FTP site. Problems can be resolved by notifying the user, reporting via Email, or automatic download of the correct components from your Web or FTP site. i New! Event Log Toolkit I Create custom event sources with this easy to I use toolkit. Eliminates the problem with VB6 in I which all events are logged as coming from I VBRuntime. Event sources are easy to I distribute, self-installing, and support multiple I languages. Included code demonstrates advanced event reporting API calls. Data Storage for VB, VBA and Internet Applications StorageTools allows you to create complex documents, each of which can be subdivided into multiple named blocks of data. StorageTools actually gives you more data storage flexibility than most databases, without the overhead! SpyWorks® 6.3 - The ultimate low level toolkit, now compatible with VB.NET and C#for VS.NET Beta 2 Advanced Subclassing and Hooks - In-and cross process subclassing for VB6 and .NET! Use Windows Hooks to intercept messages and keys for a window, process or the entire system. Create Background threads for your VB6 DLL COM objects. Create true Function Exports from your VB6 DLLs.

Gone are the days when building a Web site with Notepad was feasible. If you need to put together a site — in Internet time — you need the right tools. I've long relied on Microsoft's FrontPage and Visual InterDev, but Macromedia's Dreamweaver 4 Fireworks 4 Suite (bundling the company's two products together and giving it way too long of a name) provides some tempting reasons to switch. This is a compre- hensive package ofW eb and graphics development tools that has the added benefit of extensibility.

Help is on the Way One thing that seems to pervade every type of project, regardless of language or the degree of programmer proficiency, is a lack of documentation — both written manuals and help files. RoboHelp Enterprise is a one-size-fits-all attempt to address that situation. After spending some time with it, I've concluded that it's a real powerhouse. The Enterprise incarnation is a superset of the other target-specific RoboHelp versions. It also adds server-side functionality not present in any other version. These additional features use eHelp's MindReader server, which runs under Internet Information Server (IIS). There are two types of MindReader features — a natural-language search engine, which is aimed at your end users, and a set of report functions, aimed at the administrative and development people working on the project. The natural-language feature requires the RoboHelp Enterprise project type; it won't work with HTML Help, WinHelp, or any of the other targeted platforms that RoboHelp supports. This isn't an issue for an RoboHelp Enterprise eHelp Corp. Web: www.ehelp.com Phone: 800-358-9370 Price: 81,798 Quick Facts: An all-encompassing help development system. Pros: Powerful; covers a wide array of target platforms. Cons: Natural language engine requires IIS; can't be deployed to standalone apps. Graphics to Die For. Fireworks 4, which comprises half the suite, provides a rich set of bitmap and vector tools that let you create, edit, and animate your Web graphics. Macromedia is positioning Fireworks 4 as a direct competitor to Adobe Photoshop 6 for professional Web design. build rich Web sites and applications. This latest version adds a slew of new features, including an integrated text editor with color-coded HTML and scripting code, a JavaScript debugger, and an integrated O'Reilly code reference for information about tags and objects. One cool new feature is the Asset Management Tool, which lets you track all site media — including site images, colors, and external URLs — in a central location. The other product in the suite is Fireworks 4, which you use to design and optimize Web graphics for easy integration into your site. It also sports many new features, such as a popup menu creator to implement cool site navigation without writing all the messy client-side code; a Layers panel, which has expanded thumbnails of each layer's objects and advanced masking capabilities; and a Batch Processing Wizard for executing multiple processes. Fireworks' support for importing and/or exporting graphic elements now includes Photoshop, FreeHand 9, EPS, and wireless BMPs. ■ om**»r -MS ' < , • • Ji i ., , .... ■ ■ An IDE by Any Other Name. RoboHelp Enterprise's Authoring Environment has a similar feel to FrontPage, and the resemblance is more than skin-deep — you can use it to develop Web sites, too, complete with natural-language search functions. The HTML Help Environment handles all the help formats except for legacy WinHelp HLP projects; the RoboHelp Classic Environment, included with the Enterprise edition, manages these projects. organizational intranet or even an Internet application that can access your Web server, but it precludes you from adding natural-language searches to your standalone, non-networked projects. The Enterprise project type maintains a database on the server and uses it to generate a variety of live reports. You can see charts detailing the access frequency for each page, the number of unan- swerable questions posed to the system, the most common ques- tions asked, and so forth. This gives you the opportunity to hone your help system to address demonstrated needs rather than the merely anticipated needs that all help systems aim to meet.

This suite is no excep- tion, but the company is working to make its various products easier to learn and use. The suite's comprehensive documentation, in- structional videos, help files, and extensive Web site do help navigate the learning curve, but don't expect to crank out a professional Web site after your first all-nighter. All I found missing in this bundle are the features that Dreamweaver UltraDev — Dreamweaver 4's big brother — provides, such as easy data access and extensive sup- port for programming. So big-time Web developers will probably want to spend the extra $300 and get the UltraDev 4 Fire- works 4 Studio bundle. But if you're a designer who doesn't write code, this bundle is probably more than enough. For the first time with a Web site develop- ment tool, I feel like I did when I first used Microsoft Office — it has many more features than I'll ever use, but it's nice to have them available as I discover what they do.

He's written several books about VB and VC++, and he speaks regularly at VBITS. Reach him at donkiely@computer.org. Help is on the Way need to target enterprise systems but do need to develop intensive help systems for standalone applications. Although Robo- Help Enterprise compiles help systems for HTML Help, WinHelp, JavaHelp, Oracle Help, and eHelp's browser-oriented platform-independent WebHelp format, you don't need it to target those formats. The RoboHelp Office version, which costs roughly half as much as the Enterprise version, tackles those formats exactly the same way as the Enterprise version. And, because the Office version is a superset of the HTML Help and Classic versions, you can save even more by purchasing one of those two systems if you don't need to work with WinHelp files and the rest of the supported formats. There's no way to address the fantastic array of development functions that all of these packages provide. In addition to creat- ing help systems, you can also import and translate existing systems and output help systems to written manual format to take care of your printed documentation needs. You can download 1 5-day evaluation cop- ies from eHelp's Web site, so you should try the systems before committing to a purchase.

Using Active Server Pages (ASP), you can produce text, graphs, and charts that correspond to the BIFF 8 format used by Excel 97, 2000, and 2002. This capability lets you take advantage of Excel's rich formatting and formulas while providing the latest statistics from your database. The budget- conscious should take note that you don't even need to buy Excel to run or view reports — the component works without requiring Excel on the Web server, and Microsoft offers a free Excel reader. During the easy installation, watch for a privacy issue. The ExcelWriter 2.0 SoftArtisans Web: www.softartisans.com Phone: 877-SOFTART Price: Server license starts at S799. Quick Facts: Component that generates Excel spreadsheets, reports, and charts from scripts or databases. Pros: Flexible and sophisticated; built for high-powered Web use; good docu- mentation and sample code. Cons: No supportfor pivottables; sends registration information to SoftArtisans without prompting; no fixed price. Snuff Out Resource Leaks Finding bottlenecks and resource leaks in your code is a crucial part of testing and deploying robust applications. There are many choices out there for tools that can help you with these tasks. Most of them are large, complex, and costly. But Electric Software's GlowCode is an excellent tool for profiling and understanding your code and detecting memory leaks at an affordable price. The tool is simple and straightforward to use, and I was able to get meaningful, detailed, and easily understandable results in minutes the first time I used it. Using GlowCode starts with the GlowCode Loader, which allows you to choose whether you want to launch your app from the loader directly, attach the GlowCode Profiler to a running process, GlowCode 3.0 Electric Software Inc. Web: www.glowcode.com Price: $295 Quick Facts: Quick and easy profiling tool that snuffs out resource leaks and bottlenecks. Pros: Fast; easy to learn and use. Cons: Slightly primitive user interface; sparse online documentation. Generate Excel Spreadsheets- Without Excel. ExcelWriter 2.0 lets your Web server deliver Excel spreadsheets on the fly without requiring Microsoft Excel on the server. You can connect to an ADO data source and program ExcelWriter's objects using ASP to generate 2-D and 3-D charts. license says the product sends your registration data to SoftArtisans automatically. Specifically, \"HRESULT of registration, Username, Computername, Domainname, Time Zone, OS Version, Locale Id, Browser Version, Source IP Address and CPU count.\" To give ExcelWriter a spin, I used ASP to read data from an Access database and push the results out to Excel as a sorted table. Thanks to the example files, producing a simple spreadsheet appli- cation takes only a few minutes. Use the familiar ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) to connect to the database and execute a SQL query. After assigning values to the cells, you define the style of the columns using ExcelWriter's CreateStyle method. For example, you can format a date using DateStyle. Number = 1 7, or you can set the width of a text column using cells. ColumnWidth(i) = 20. If you're generating Excel spreadsheets, you probably also want GlowCode Finds a Leak. GlowCode detects leaked resources quickly and easily, providing detailed information to help track down the cause. or link the GlowCode toolset directly into your application. If you choose the latter, you get some brief instructions to add the provided glowcode.cpp file to your app. But you also need to ensure the GlowCode gc2core.dll file is either in your program's folder or in a system path folder where you can find it. If you're going to use GlowCode with a release version of your program, you also need to make sure a program database (PDB) is available. Once GlowCode is attached to a running application through any of these means, the GlowCode Dashboard arrives to provide information on the running program. The Dashboard is an easy-to- use tabbed interface with tabs for each of the program's main functions: Profiler, Trace, Coverage, and Resources. There's also a More tab, which is where you find the basic program functions r-What : P> Heap lute W Heap Wock overruns : r DWord value OmO Search where.

In many ways, you are repeating the programmatic steps you would take if you were working on the spreadsheet within Excel. For example, to show a 3-D bar chart, you generate the data, put it into cells, select ranges, and set the format for the type of chart. Anyone who is comfortable in VBA will grasp the objects in ExcelWriter easily. One disappointment is its lack of support for pivot tables. That addition would give it a big competitive boost against reporting products from Crystal Decisions. In my examples, I generated spread- sheets on the fly. For static reports, schedule a Windows Scripting Host script to write a single XLS file to the file system instead of streaming new spreadsheets to each user. ExcelWriter is fun to use, works well, and provides good documentation and ex- ample code. For the forward-thinking pur- chaser, SoftArtisans' Web site shows the product working already in ASP .NET. A server license starts at $799 per CPU for the light version, but you'll have to contact the company on pricing out the full version of the software because it is \"negotiated on a per purchase basis.\" You can obtain a free evaluation download from http://support. softartisans.com/evalindex.asp. \\ Ken Cox is a technical writer and Web appli- cations developer in Toronto.

The Profiler, Trace, and Coverage tabs take a consistent approach, consisting of an expandable treeview display that lets you drill down to the module, file, function, or line of code level. There are also additional columns in the tab that display the results of that tab's purpose. Each tab has buttons to start and stop the profiling, clear the display and counts, change the current hooks into the program, export the displayed results to a file or the clipboard, or get options relevant to the tab's function. You can hook into system or linked DLLs that your program uses if you want to see their contribution to your code's performance. You can use GlowCode as a simple tool during ad hoc testing to ensure you get good coverage of your code, or as a cross-check of test suites to make sure you're getting the coverage you think you are. The documen- tation is a little sparse and the user interface a bit primitive, but because the tool is so straightforward and intuitive, you don't need a fancy GUI or reams of documentation to get useful results in a hurry, vsm Brian Noyes is a senior software engineer with Digital Access Corp.

FAST is a back-office application that acquires data from the well-known Reuters news service — either by satellite or land line — and stores it in a database. It then delivers the data to the user either in raw XML or in formatted Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) through HTTP, FTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or Short Message Service (SMS). FAST provides an \"easy way to work with Reuters financial data,\" says sole developer Richard Prinz of Regionale Informations Systeme GmbH (RIS) in Wiener Neustadt, Austria. Users can run the app in the background as a service or in the foreground as a console. RIS uses FAST internally, delivering the output to subscribing customers. But the company will soon sell it to users who want to process Reuters data themselves. The 20 MB app, consisting of 20 DLLs and six EXEs, took Prinz one and a half years to develop. He For more information on FAST, e-mail Richard Prinz at Bb M richard.prinz@risnet.at. B used Visual Basic 6.0 for 80 percent of the solution, and Visual C++ and Visual J++ for the rest. FAST supports Microsoft Access and SQL Server databases, and will support Oracle in the future. Prinz used Reuters' Source/Sink Lib (SSL) development toolkit to build FAST, as well as \"lots of information from MSDN and [the Microsoft] Knowledge Base,\" he says. He's most proud of the app's flexibility and was most challenged by its \"horrible\" multi- threading issues. In the future, Prinz would like to add features for statistical data analysis and mobile usage. He's also actively evaluating Visual Studio .NET: \"We have already started some development with the beta version and are satisfied with the results ... in about a year, if all goes well, we'll have a .NET version available.\" — Nina Goldschlager Handhelds Visit the Doctor's Office Handheld computers seem to be popping up everywhere now — including the doctor's office. Typically, doctors meeting with patients dictate to a recorder or scribble notes on a pad. After the visit, someone transcribes the notes, then a medical coder reviews them and applies appropriate codes for billing. This system can be time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. PICOS, based in Sterling, Va., has circumvented this process with the Dictation Engine — part of PICOS' Total Practice Man- ager (TPM) suite, which performs all the tasks needed at a doctor's office, including scheduling, billing, purchasing, and inventory. Physicians at Dulles Orthopedics Group — a beta test site in Sterling — employ TPM on their Fujitsu Stylistic LT C-500s. As doctors meet with patients, they point-and-click through a series of logically displayed questions and answers, many displayed as detailed, high-resolution, 3-D graphics of the human anatomy. Once doctors finish their exam, the Dictation Engine produces a readable dictation that becomes part of the patient's history, as well as codes that meet industry standards for billing. Only a simple review and approval from billing personnel are needed to send the claim to the patient's insurance company. Stephen Mallette, PICOS' chief information officer, designed and developed the Dictation Engine in VB6 over a period of five months. System developer James Policano implemented the app in its host application, TPMVisit, a module of TPM. Satish Unni, For more information on the Dictation Engine, visit PICOS at www.picosinc.com, or reach Stephen Mallette by e-mail at smallette@picosinc.com. system analyst, gathered and documented the logic that drives the engine. The Dictation Engine comprises 1 class modules and 1 5 forms (roughly 750 possible forms if you count those generated dynamically from the logic files). Mallette is proud that \"the project came in on time, under budget, and with all requested functionality present.\" He adds: \"The key to our success was not underestimating the level of effort required.\" Future plans include adding logic files for other medical specialties besides orthopedics. Another possibility: developing a logic file for capturing sporting-event statistics. — Nicole Pizzurro To submit proposals for VS All-Stars, send an e-mail to vsmedit® fawcette.com.

Perhaps this is due partly to marketing campaigns that put the spotlight on .NET's Web and distributed computing features. But make no mistake: VB's ability to work with the Windows system at a low level, and work with unmanaged code from external libraries, has never been better. I demon- strated some of VB. NET's powerful new features in this area in my \"Breaking API Barriers\" article (see Resources), but that was only the tip of the iceberg. In this article, I bid farewell to CopyMemory (also known as the RtlMoveMemory API function) and showyou VB . NET's amazing new power over memory and pointers. That power is found in four new tools: IntPtr, .NET's platform-dependent representation of a memory address; GCHandle, which helps you pin and retrieve the address of data in the managed memory heap; the Marshal class, the one-stop shop for all your memory allocation, cleanup, and manipula- tion needs; and Delegate, .NET's representation of a function pointer. It's worth going over a few safety issues before you dive into .NET's new pointer features. I covered one of those issues in my August article, but I'll restate it here because it's worth review within this context. An automatic garbage collector (GC) maintains the man- aged heap: It compacts unused space and readjusts any managed references to the memory that was moved. Because of its dynamic nature, you need to take extra precautions whenever you want to capture an address within the managed heap. This involves the act of \"pinning,\" which I'll revisit later in this article. The next safety issue relates to data integrity. When you take the address of a piece of data within the managed heap and pass that address to unmanaged code (any code written outside of.NET) , the .NET system can't guarantee the integrity of your data because the unmanaged code can do whatever it wants to the data without considering safety. Therefore, the compiler marks any opera- tions that do this (using API function calls, for example) as unverifiable. The last safety issue involves trust and permis- sions. The .NET system assures that its elements won't compromise your computer's security. For example, it knows which resources require file-system access and allows you to grant or deny the use of this resource depending on where the code came from. However, the .NET system has no way of knowing what resources will be accessed by unmanaged code, or how maliciously the unmanaged code might use a given resource. What's more, by manipulating point- ers directly, it's possible that the data or functions of a component marked as safe could be inadvertently or intentionally replaced by more malicious code — one more reason that calls to unmanaged code and direct pointer manipulation are marked as unverifiable. If you decide to work with direct memory ma- nipulation in VB.NET, the first thing you need to understand is the IntPtr type. IntPtr is a structure that • October 2001 • www.vbpj.com • www.vcdj.com represents both addresses and handles (most handles are pointers to ' pin variable and create Windows pointers). IntPtr instances are also platform-dependent ' GC handle instance (or independent, depending on your point of view). On a 32-bit Dim gh As GCHandle = GCHandle.Al loc system, IntPtr is 32-bit, while on a 64-bit system, IntPtr is 64-bit. (MyString. GCHandleType. Pinned) The benefit is that you don't need to change or recompile your code for both platforms. Any function within the .NET Framework that ' get address of variable exposes a way to work with addresses and handles uses the IntPtr Dim AddrOfliyStri ng As IntPtr =_ type. Such functions are marshaled to unmanaged code simply as gh.AddrOfPinnedObjectt ) the internal address number, meaning you can pass a variable of IntPtr type ByVal to any unmanaged code that expects a pointer. So Consol e . Wri teLi ne _ the good news is that, although you can't use this in VB.NET: (AddrOfMyString.ToStringt ) ) Dim 1 pMyVari abl e As Void * this works brilliantly: Dim lpMyVariable As IntPtr Note that there was no IntPtr type in beta 1 — instead, functions that worked with pointers and handles used the Integer type. The IntPtr type has a ToInt32 method that converts the address to an Integer, but that can and will cause an Overflow exception on a 64- bit system. IntPtr also has a ToInt64 method, but you'll have to keep track of the platform if you want to do these conversions. Get a Handle on the Garbage Collector Next, let's examine how you place the address of a variable into an IntPtr. You use the GCHandle class, which has an AddrOf- PinnedObject method that returns an IntPtr for a variable. You must \"pin\" the data before you can get this address. This prevents the garbage collector from moving the data inadvertently while you're referring to the original address. This code pins a variable, displays its address on the console window, and frees the handle: ' dim managed variable Dim MyString As String 1 free the handle and unpin variable gh. Free( ) Freeing a GCHandle as soon as you're done using it minimizes the impact on garbage collection. As a rule of thumb, this code shows the standard way to capture the memory address of a managed object. Note that you don't necessarily need to use this method to pass the address of a variable to an unmanaged function (such as a Windows API function). VB uses the .NET PInvoke service to pass parameters to unmanaged functions, and this feature has greatly enhanced VB's ability to pass data and addresses seamlessly to such functions. In this case, if you wanted to send the string's pointer to an external unmanaged function, you would be better off passing it in the parameter list as a String and using the MarshalAs attribute to specify the type of string. PInvoke takes care of the pinning automatically (see the \"Break API Barriers\" article for more details). Be careful when you use value types, which are usually primi- tives or simple data types such as Integers. To utilize polymor- phism in .NET fully, a value type needs to be able to work as object. VB.NET uses a technique called boxing to accomplish this. A value type is boxed when you implicitly or explicitly cast it as an Object in VB.NET. Therefore, value types are boxed when you use the Alloc method of the GCHandle class, because the Alloc method accepts an Object type parameter. If the address is Process 1 Memory-Mapped File View 1 Process 2 View 2 View 3 Figure 1 Share Memories Between Processes. Memory-mapped files are a powerful technique you can use to share \"memory\" between different processes. Processes can map to the same view or different views, or they can even have overlapping views.

However, if the unmanaged code writes back to the address, the new value won't carry over to the value type itself. This scenario is the same in C#, and its documentation states that if you need to write back to the value, you need to start off with an object instead. It looks like this in VB: Dim MyVariable As Object = 123 The integer value type is cast to an object and boxed, and you can now pin the object representation of the integer. The value remains unchanged if you write back to this address. The object can then be cast b"
