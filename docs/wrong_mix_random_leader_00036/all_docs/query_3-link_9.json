        "text": "Horror Stories\n\nEuSPRIG Horror Stories\n\nSpreadsheet mistakes – news stories\n\nPublic reports of spreadsheet errors have been sought out on behalf of EuSPRIG by Patrick O’Beirne of Systems Modelling for many years. There are very many reports of spreadsheet related errors and they seem to appear in the global media at a fairly consistent rate.\n\nThese stories illustrate common problems that occur with the uncontrolled use of spreadsheets. In many cases, we identify the area of risk involved and then say how we think the problem might have been avoided.\n\nStories are identified by those who kindly collated and sorted them:\n\nPOB: Patrick O’Beirne, Eusprig chair\n\nFH: Felienne Hermans (winner of the 2011 David Chadwick student prize and now a Professor of Computer Science Education at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam).\n\nNS: Tie Cheng, a volunteer\n\nMPC: Mary Pat Campbell, an actuary, trainer, and a member of the EuSpRIG Discussion group\n\nWhere a source is not hyperlinked, it has been moved or removed by the owners.\n\nIdentifier: POB2401 Title: The Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund’s $92 Million Excel Error Source: Slashdot Release Date: 12 Jan 2024 Risk: Financial loss\n\nNorway’s $1.5tn sovereign wealth fund revealed that it had lost NKr980mn, roughly $92mn, on an error relating to how it calculated its mandated benchmark because an incorrect date was entered. An academic paper details it Anthropological gaze, stories, and reflections on NBIM culture. The slashdot artcle also points out “Sometimes a mistake can even lead to a windfall — such as in 2021, when NBIM apparently made NKr582mn by accidentally accumulating an outsized position in a rising stock.”\n\nIdentifier: POB2311 Title: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS apologises for data breach Source: Statement from Chief Executive of CUH NHS Trust Release Date: 6 Dec 2023 Risk: Data breach\n\n“In responding to the request, we mistakenly shared some personal data which was not immediately visible in the spreadsheet we provided but which could be accessed via a ‘pivot table’.”\n\nThis is the kind of error the Information Commissioner was warning about, see POB2310.\n\nIdentifier: POB2310 Title: FOI requests and spreadsheets directive from ICO Source: College of Policing Release Date: 2 Nov 2023 Risk: Regulatory fines\n\nThe Information Commissioner has issued a critical advisory notice to public authorities urging them to discontinue the use of original source Excel spreadsheets when responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOI) requests.\n\nThe directive follows a series of high-profile data breaches that exposed personal information due to its inadvertent inclusion in spreadsheets shared as part of FOI responses.\n\nIdentifier: POB2309 Title: ‘Frankensheet’ sorting errors hamper recruitment Source: The Register:\n\nExcel recruitment time bomb makes top trainee doctors ‘unappointable’ Release Date: 12 Oct 2023 Risk: Failure to adequately staff hospitals\n\nA myriad of poor practice and error in a spreadsheet created by the Anaesthetic National Recruitment Office (ANRO) for calculating and aggregating interview scores for trainee anaesthesiologists made all of the candidates “unapointable” in Wales. A review that followed found that the spreadsheet lacked a template, a standard naming convention, labels and structure. There were also issues with manual transfer of data between regional spreadsheets and a master spreadsheet, issues with copy and paste and VLOOKUP.\n\nSchool of Anaesthesia article\n\nIdentifier: POB2308 Title: Gene name errors still there, 20 years on Source: Retraction Watch: Genomics has a spreadsheet problem Release Date: 20 Sep 2023 Risk: Reputational risk after retractions\n\nMonthly research data is publicly accessible at Ziemann Labs, and reveals a steady rate of gene-name errors and a rising number of affected journals until recently.\n\nIdentifier: POB2307 Title: PSNI data breach of “monumental proportions”, personal data of 10,799 staff Source: Belfast Telegraph: PSNI apologises to officers and civilian staff after major security breach Release Date: 8 August 2023 Risk: Security risk, disclosure of individual identities\n\nThe force mistakenly published the names, ranks, locations and other personal data of every serving police officer and civilian employee. In what was a described as a “human error”, a spreadsheet tab contained a complete SAP download. Described as “a gold mine for terrorists, offering details of officers working in intelligence and other highly sensitive areas – including almost 40 PSNI staff based with MI5.”\n\nMembers of the PSNI still check under their cars for bombs. Consequential costs could run to £50 million in fines and compensation alone.\n\n(PDF) PSNI incident report: Protecting From Within\n\nUpdated 23-May-2024: Information Commissioner levies a fine of £750,000. Legal actions could mount to over £200 million.\n\nIdentifier: POB2306 Title: Fraud in four Harvard Business school papers by Excel manipulation Source: Datacolada research reports Release Date: 17 June 2023 Risk: Loss of reputation\n\nDataColada examined a number of studies co-authored by Prof. Gino and discovered evidence of fraud in papers spanning over a decade, including papers published quite recently (in 2020). Two different people independently faked data for two different studies in a paper about dishonesty. The fraud was unearthed by a audit of the internal structure of the Excel files.\n\nIdentifier: POB2305 Title: Blame Excel, not the user Source: Officials Say They’ve Fixed a ‘Sorting’ Breakdown in Virginia Booze Raffle Release Date: June 2023 Risk: Loss of revenue\n\nABC officials told the board a problem occurred in the last lottery—which had more than 40,000 entries—due to a “breakdown in Excel sorting,” referring to the commonly used data processing software Microsoft Excel. The authority was using Excel to sort through lottery entries and determine the winners.\n\n“I can’t speak to the inner workings of Excel. It sorted some of it and didn’t sort some of the rest,” said ABC Director of Internal Audit Mike Skrocki.\n\nIdentifier: POB2304 Title: ‘Spill’ of ‘hidden’ Excel rows derails Proud Boys trial Source: Politico Release Date: 9 March 2023 Risk: Trial disruption\n\n“Miller sent her final list to prosecutors, who then packaged the messages into an Excel spreadsheet that they provided to defense lawyers. But unbeknownst to them, the messages Miller initially filtered out — including some that DOJ officials say are likely classified — were left in the final document as “hidden” rows in the Excel spreadsheet. Defense counsel stumbled upon them and began grilling Miller about them in front of jurors in the case.”\n\nIdentifier: POB2303 Title: Matt Parker broadcast on Spreadsheet disasters Source: ‘More or Less’ on BBC Radio 4 Release Date: 11 Feb 2023 Risk: Misstatement of official statistics\n\nThe Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) in the UK issued a correction to its Autumn statement, borrowing for January was projected at £9.1bn but following the correction of an error, the figures now show a £0.4bn surplus for January. “But that’s just the most recent in a long list of times when spreadsheets have gone wrong, often with costly consequences. Stand-up mathematician Matt Parker takes us through a short history of spreadsheet mistakes.”\n\nIdentifier: POB2302 Title: Formula error inflated myocarditis statistics Source: AAP FactCheck Release Date: 26 Jan 2023 Risk: Misinformation leading to disinformation\n\nClaim of 8% of people in Swindon, UK, affected by heart issues, corrected to 0.01%. The NHS trust said “This was a formula error that occurred during the process of simplifying the data into a pivot table. The value that was displayed was the sum total of a numeric value within the raw data, specifically a row count, as the years progressed the row count increased meaning the sum was greater. The value displayed should have been a count and not a sum.”\n\nIdentifier: POB2301 Title: Generated fake data detected by coincidence with Excel limit Source: JPM Complaint Release Date: 22 Dec 2022 Risk: Fraud\n\nA Data Science professor generated fake data to swell a list of 300,000 student names to over 4 million. Javice’s startup is accused of defrauding JPM bank of $175M.\n\nJPMC first noticed irregularities with the list when a JPMC employee observed\n\nthat the list contained exactly 1,048,576 rows, the maximum permitted by Microsoft Excel. That\n\nnumber also did not correspond to any number of customer accounts previously identified by\n\nJavice or others at Frank for any given time period.\n\nIdentifier: POB2202 Title: Police in Finland lose hacked therapy centre criminal reports after spreadsheet error Source: https://yle.fi/a/3-12305218 Release Date: 7 Feb 2022 Risk: Data Loss, possible justice delayed.\n\nOfficers say 30,000 reports were lost when they were moved from a spreadsheet into the police system. The sheer volume of reports caused congestion within the police’s systems. However, due to a file error on an Excel spreadsheet, some of the criminal reports had not been completed and were therefore not received into the police’s system.\n\nInstead of a database, the criminal reports were recorded via Microsoft Excel files. About a dozen of the files turned out to be unreadable when police tried to transfer them in the official system. The cause of the problem is unknown.\n\nSome of those whose criminal reports have not been recorded due to the Excel error may not have been notified of the disappearance of their criminal reports.\n\nIdentifier: POB2106 Title: PRA fines Standard Chartered Bank £46,550,000 Source: Bank of England Release Date: 20 Dec 2021 Risk: Financial Penalties\n\nFrom the notice document linked therein: “On 29 November 2018, Treasury Markets identified that a cell in the LMM spreadsheet (“Line 49”) was showing a positive number (around USD 10 billion), even though it related to liabilities and should therefore have been either zero or negative.” All adding up to an £8bn error due to a lack of control and review at SCB, and a £47m fine as a result.\n\nIdentifier: POB2105 Title: The Tyranny of Spreadsheets Source: Tim Harford\n\nAcademic paper by Fetzer and Graeber Release Date: 21 July 2021 Risk: Loss of life – the most serious error of the entire horror stories collection\n\nNearly 16,000 positive Covid cases had disappeared completely from the UK’s contact tracing system. The Excel files used by Public Health England had run out of rows.\n\nFetzer and Graeber have calculated a conservative estimate of the number of people who died, unknown victims of the spreadsheet error. They think the death toll is at least 1,500 people.\n\n“Does Contact Tracing Work? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from an Excel Error in England”\n\nIdentifier: POB2102 Title: Canada Emergency Wage Support (CUSS) spreadsheet ‘riddled with errors’ Source: Canada Revenue Agency mistakes Release Date: 25 Jan 2021 Risk: Customer inconvenience, possible loss of income\n\nThe Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) presented a spreadsheet of Canada Emergency Wage Support (CUSS) that was riddled with errors and cut some business subsidies in half.\n\nIn other words, employers who filled out their applications this week in November may have seen their benefits cut in half or a quarter because it was calculated over one week, not two weeks.\n\nThis mistake had the effect of drastically reducing support for businesses, but only for some owners and their families. It only exists in the French version of the spreadsheet.\n\nIdentifier: POB2103 Title: The so-called “Highly Regulated Spreadsheet” Source: Bloomberg Release Date: 17 Feb 2021 Risk: Loss of reputation, regulatory sanctions\n\n‘Morningstar’s problem is that it put a highly regulated model in a regular old Excel spreadsheet where analysts could type whatever they wanted, and did. “Even the column labels in the Subordination Model’s Excel spreadsheet failed to constrain the use of the adjustments”! Even the column labels! The analysts looked at the columns labeled “do some fudging here, but not in a bad way,” and they did some fudging in a bad way, and now the SEC is mad. ‘\n\nIdentifier: POB2104 Title: Nothing is really hidden in Excel Source: How the government’s mistaken prices disclosure derailed a big follow-on solicitation Release Date: 8 July 2021 Risk: GAO relied on its prior case law, saying it was improper to disclose proprietary information during acquisition.\n\n“When the Defense Information Systems Agency sought a new satellite services acquisition on behalf of the Navy, it included a spreadsheet so bidders could fill in their prices. But the spreadsheet included the prices from the current contract, which were supposed to be inaccessible. What kind of operational controls are in place at DISA, in this case, that they would send a spreadsheet out full of pricing information?”\n\nIdentifier: POB2101 Title: PRA fines Metro Bank £5,376,000 for failing in its regulatory reporting governance and controls Source: Bank of England Release Date: 21 Dec 2021 Risk: Heightened operational risk, key-person dependencies.\n\nThe Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) imposes a financial penalty on Metro Bank plc of £5,376,000 for breaching Fundamental Rules 2 and 6 of the PRA Rulebook\n\nTo the extent that rule interpretations were documented, they were embedded within spreadsheets and working papers, and so were not readily accessible.\n\nIts RWA calculation process remained largely manual, reflecting the Firm’s limited investment in systems during the Relevant Period, which heightened operational risk and created key-person dependencies on a small number of individuals familiar with spreadsheets that were not scalable.\n\nIdentifier: POB2002 Title: ‘Spreadsheet formula’ to blame for over $16,000 in property tax errors Source: https://www.sonomanews.com/article/news/sanitation-district-error-leads-to-tax-bill-overcharge/ Release Date: 23 Nov 2020 Risk: Embarrassment, compensation payments Discrepancy: $16,000E\n\n[Dugan] explained that when the sanitation district gets annual water use files from the Valley of the Moon Water District and the City of Sonoma, “that data set has to be converted into a consistent format and merged into our files. After multiple reviews when we merged the files, last-minute changes were made to the billing file that ultimately resulted in those 3,000 customers receiving incorrect sewer charges on their property tax bills.\n\nThe total error resulted in net refunds of $16,276 to district customers through recalculated property tax bills, a number which is adjusted for the relatively small number of underpayments that resulted from the spreadsheet error.\n\nIdentifier: POB2001 Title: Data not controlled, 16000 UK Covid-19 test results lost for a week Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54423988 Release Date: 08 October 2020 Risk: Lives put at risk because the contact-tracing process had been delayed Discrepancy: 16,000 test cases in a week\n\nExcel: Why using Microsoft’s tool caused Covid-19 results to be lost\n\n“The badly thought-out use of Microsoft’s Excel software was the reason nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases went unreported in England. [The labs] filed their [result logs] results in the form of text-based lists – known as CSV files – without issue. PHE had set up an automatic process to pull this data together into Excel templates so that it could then be uploaded to a central system. The problem is that [Public Health England] PHE’s own developers picked an old file format to do this – known as XLS. As a consequence, each template could handle only about 65,000 rows of data rather than the one million-plus rows that Excel is actually capable of. And since each test result created several rows of data, in practice it meant that each template was limited to about 1,400 cases. When that total was reached, further cases were simply left off. To handle the problem, PHE is now breaking down the test result data into smaller batches to create a larger number of Excel templates.”\n\n[POB] I can correct the headline to:\n\nWhy a lack of basic data controls caused Covid-19 results to be lost\n\nOf course they should not have chosen a file format with a size limit to process results. Nonetheless, whatever technology they used, anywhere data is exchanged between systems there must be checks and controls that reconcile the output of a transformation stage to its input, such as record counts and hash totals. Even if the upload process would only accept XLS files, batch total controls could have been imposed there too.\n\nIdentifier: POB2003 Title: Scientists rename human genes to stop Microsoft Excel from misreading them as dates Source: https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates Release Date: 06/08/2020 Risk: Inconvenience Discrepancy: none\n\nThe bioinformatics community decided it was easier to change gene symbols than changing peoples’ habits.’Módos, whose job involves analyzing freshly sequenced genetic data, says Excel errors happen all the time, simply because the software is often the first thing to hand when scientists process numerical data. “It’s a widespread tool and if you are a bit computationally illiterate you will use it,” he says.’\n\nIdentifier: POB2002 Title: Spreadsheet error led to Edinburgh hospital opening delay Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-53893101 Release Date: 26/08/2020 Risk: Financial loss Discrepancy: GBP16M\n\nAn NHS Lothian-commissioned review found a “human error” in a 2012 spreadsheet with the specifications for air flow in critical care rooms. It was only when the hospital had been handed over to NHS Lothian, and £1.4m monthly repayments had started, that independent checks found the critical care rooms were operating with the wrong air flow. Remedial work worth £16m has since been carried out and the new Sick Kids building started hosting outpatient appointments in July. An independent tester appointed by both sides “did not identify the non-compliance with the guidance within critical care”, according to the report\n\nIdentifier: POB1906 Title: State fund for jobs loses €750k due to ‘human error’ Source: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2019/1126/1095303-human-error-cost-ntma-750-000-on-an-investment/ Release Date: 26/11/2019 Risk: Financial loss Discrepancy: EUR750K\n\nThe National Treasury Management Agency explained that the agency purchased a fund in dollars, but it was not designated or marked on the spreadsheet record as such. It was recorded as a euro fund. “Subsequently, when the error was discovered, the dollar exchange rate had moved against the NTMA and the investment return was down €750,000.” The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) questioned the agency about the “control weakness”.\n\nIdentifier: POB1905 Title: “The error constituted maladministration on the part of the actuary” Source: https://www.iol.co.za/personal-finance/retirement/who-has-the-final-say-in-pension-fund-disputes-34927606 Release Date: 04/10/2019 Risk: Penalties and court appearances Discrepancy: R40 million loss\n\nThe retirement fund had initially referred the matter to the adjudicator, which ruled that the actuary alone was responsible for R40m in overpayments made to exiting members of the fund. The overpayments, made over a number of years, stemmed from a “hard-coding error” in the spreadsheet system the actuary had been using. The adjudicator ruled that the error constituted maladministration on the part of the actuary, who should pay damages.\n\nIdentifier: POB1904 Title: AG: State overpaid Stroudsburg nearly $500K Source: https://www.poconorecord.com/news/20190729/ag-state-overpaid-stroudsburg-nearly-500k Release Date: 29/07/2019 Risk: Financial loss Discrepancy: US$500K\n\nThe screw up was caused by the district using cumulative mileage totals rather than running calculations on a sample average for vehicles, which resulted in the district significantly over reporting total mileage data, causing the subsidy overpayments. The audit found the errors were due to a clerical error on the spreadsheet the district was using. In some cases, DePasquale said, the spreadsheet was double counting total days for some of the activity runs. The audit also found that the district lacked written procedures\n\nIdentifier: POB1903 Title: NYCLU apologizes for misstating racial disparity in Schenectady pot arrests Source: https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/NYCLU-apologizes-for-mistating-racial-disparity-14069700.php Release Date: 03/07/2019 Risk: Mistake harms trust department has worked to build Discrepancy: Loss of trust\n\nReleased in April amid discussions in the state Legislature to legalize the drug in New York, the analysis erroneously indicated that black residents in Schenectady were 74 times more likely to be arrested for a marijuana-related offense than white people, despite making up just 12 percent of the population. The error, which placed Schenectady atop a list of 10 counties with the worst racial gaps in cannabis arrests, was a result of a “misaligned spreadsheet” which improperly merged Saratoga County U.S. Census data with Schenectady arrest numbers from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services, researchers said. The numbers, while accurate, were imported incorrectly due to a spelling discrepancy.\n\nIdentifier: POB1902 Title: A company submitted a bid nearly $3 million lower than it should have been Source: https://brookingsregister.com/article/district-seeking-new-bids-on-next-phase-of-mms-construction Release Date: 27/03/2019 Risk: Bid rejection Discrepancy: US$3M\n\n“The rescinded bid was for $6.5 million. As Willert explained, a spreadsheet error caused the company to submit a bid nearly $3 million lower than it should have been, and due to the nature of the error, the district would not have been able to make the company stick to its submitted bid.”\n\nIdentifier: POB1901 Title: A week after posting earnings, Canopy Growth restates EBITDA after calculation error Source: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/19/02/13228789/canopy-growth-refiles-md-a-after-spreadsheet-formula-error Release Date: 21/02/2019 Risk: Loss of value Discrepancy: CA$48M\n\nCanopy Growth , the cannabis industry’s largest company by market value, refiled its third-quarter management discussion and analysis, or MD&A, on Thursday due to a spreadsheet formula error. Originally, Canopy’s adjusted EBITDA loss for the nine months ending Dec. 31, 2018 was CA$52 million ($69 million). Under the refiled MD&A submitted to the Canadian Securities Administration, the EBITDA loss amounted to CA$155 million ($117.5 million). Canopy’s stock fell 3.78 percent.\n\nIdentifier: POB1802 Title: Buskers Fest lost money last year due to ‘spreadsheet error’ Source: https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/102889835/buskers-fest-lost-money-last-year-due-to-spreadsheet-error Release Date: 18/04/2018 Risk: Financial loss Discrepancy: NZ$150000\n\nWorld Buskers Festival organisers spotted a $150,000 “spreadsheet error” just a month before the event began. “The budget showed a surplus of $56,798, however a spreadsheet error overstated net door donations by $157,413 and the real bottom line was a deficit of $100,614,” the report states.” The trust was dissolved at the end of last month.\n\nIdentifier: POB1801 Title: Drinks company £5.2M spreadsheet arithmetic error Source: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/bargain-booze-owner-conviviality-must-raise-125m-to-halt-bankruptcy Release Date: 21 March 2018 Risk: Bankruptcy after financial mismanagement Discrepancy: £5.2M\n\nAt first the retailer said profits would be 20% lower than the £70m expected by the City, with £5.2m of the £14m hole that had opened up in its forecast down to a spreadsheet error, while the remainder was a reflection of weakening profit margins. On 21 March the Guardian (UK) reported “Firm issues third profits warning; says it will meet investors to raise funds via a share placing. The company, in a stock exchange announcement, said it was holding meetings with investors to raise £125m via a share placing that would help it pay a £30m tax bill due at the end of the month, fund overdue payments to creditors and repay a £30m loan.The company blamed the first shock profit warning on a spreadsheet arithmetic error made by a member of its finance team and weakening profit margins, and then admitted it had not budgeted for the £30m tax bill due this month.”\n\nIdentifier: POB1706 Title: Eskom made R1.5bn spreadsheet error in Optimum fine Source: https://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/live-statecapture-ex-finance-director-at-eskom-tsholofelo-molefe-testifies-20171108 Release Date: 08 Nov 2017 Risk: Reputation loss Discrepancy: € 100 million\n\nThe original fine had been R2.2bn (which saw the firm go into business rescue), but when Daniels met with a committee to discuss this, they discovered there had been an error in the spreadsheet.\n\n“I was shocked at the answer,” she said. “There was an error in the spreadsheet. At that point, I was beyond furious. We have gone out in the media to say it was R2.2bn.”\n\n“The final analysis of the claim showed the fine should have been R722m. I was quite pleased to hear Mr Marsden (Optimum business rescue practitioner) estimated it to be around R700m.”\n\nIdentifier: POB1705 Title: SLO County budget surplus now a deficit after ‘human error’ Source: http://www.ksby.com/story/36685143/slo-county-budget-surplus-now-deficit-after-human-error Release Date: Oct 26, 2017 Risk: Reputation Discrepancy: $8 Million\n\n“It’s common, it’s human, everyone does that. I’m glad I’m not responsible for it though,” said Bobby Gallow, San Luis Obispo resident.\n\nThe county says recently approved salary increases were “inadvertently omitted in the calculations.” Basically, someone forgot to include those numbers in the spreadsheet.\n\nIdentifier: POB1704 Title: Risks of using a spreadsheet for election calculation Source: Malaysia news Release Date: July 2017 Risk: Mistake or fraud?

A $163,083 spreadsheet error was made on a sheriff’s jail salary worksheet, officials said. “We did some forensics,” Benedict said Wednesday. “The spreadsheets were emailed back and forth between us and [County Administrator] Jim Jones’ office. Because of some cutting and pasting, not all the formulas were pasted correctly.

The agency said senior managers ordered others to conceal the error and failed to fix it, causing $217 million in client losses.\n\nAXA Rosenberg, based in Orinda, Calif., is owned by French insurance company AXA SA. AXA Rosenberg, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in settling the case but did agree to refrain from future violations of the securities laws.\n\nThe use of quantitative models has proliferated on Wall Street.\n\n“To protect trade secrets, quantitative investment managers often isolate their complex computer models from the firm’s compliance and risk-management functions and leave oversight to a few sophisticated programmers,” SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami said in a statement. “The secretive structure and lack of oversight of quantitative investment models, as this case demonstrates, cannot be used to conceal errors and betray investors.”\n\nThe SEC said the error came into the computer model in April 2007. It was eventually corrected, but the CEO of AXA Rosenberg Group wasn’t told about it until November 2009, the agency said. The firm did its own investigation and told SEC examiners about the error in March 2010. The firm’s clients were informed on April 15.\n\nAXA Rosenberg agreed in the settlement to pay investors the $217 million they were said to have lost, as well as a $25 million civil fine. The firm also agreed to hire an independent consultant in quantitative investment techniques to review its disclosures.\n\n“We deeply regret that the coding error adversely impacted many of our clients,” AXA Rosenberg’s chairman, Dominique Carrel-Billiard, said in a statement. “The exhaustive review that we undertook of this matter reflects our commitment to regaining our clients’ confidence and restoring trust.”\n\nThe firm noted that it has made significant changes in recent months in its organization, named new executives to several top positions and put in additional measures to control risks.\n\nIdentifier: FH1212 Title: Provision for income taxes understated by $36.4 million Source: http://www.gurufocus.com/news/114917/georgia-gulf-corp-reports-operating-results-10qa Organization: Georgia Gulf Corporation (chemicals company) Region: USA Release Date: 22 November 2010 Discrepancies: 36,400,000 Risk: Too high income expectation Tags: Commercial Spreadsheet Causes: Manual data entry\n\nIn …. 2010, we engaged a different third-party firm of tax professionals to assist us with the preparation of our 2009 U.S. federal income tax return.

Consequently, we determined that a manual input error to a spreadsheet used in the tax calculations relating to the tax impact of our 2009 financial restructuring activities had been made and that certain applications of the relevant provisions of the IRC were incorrect. As a result, the reduction in various tax attributes resulting from the CODI we recognized in 2009 was understated.

My apartment management had taken a while to set up the billing after the previous billing company went of business (or dropped the contract, I don’t remember exactly what happened). So I hadn’t actually paid water and sewage for two or three months.\n\nSo when the bill came for $173, I wasn’t too surprised. I didn’t really remember what I’d paid the previous year, but this seemed reasonable for a few months of water, sewage and gas. I wrote the check, and forgot about ISTA.\n\nForty five days later, I got the next bill, but this time something seemed wrong: $463 and it had only been a month and a half. What the hell was going on? I looked back on my old bills and noticed that my average 30 day bill was about $30, even in the winter. Either the company was trying to extort money from me or somebody had made an accounting error.\n\nI looked more closely at the bill, which had three columns: previous usage, current usage, and usage. The difference between the first two columns was exactly 1000. The value in the third column was 10,000. Was there some hidden multiplier I didn’t understand? Maybe there was some rate that just happened to be 10, and I had just kept my apartment and showers really warm this winter.\n\nSo I called ISTA and disputed the bill. They immediately escalated it to their dispute manager, who called me back after a few days. They said that there had been a misread meter and that they had corrected the reading, and that after the bill was now only about $270, after they had applied the credit. When I got the call, I had a meeting to be at, so I didn’t think about it much.\n\nAfter I got home that night, it still didn’t seem right. $270 for 45 days? What happened to the rates? They must have gone up by a factor of 10! So the next day, I called ISTA back, and spoke to a nice lady about my problem. Rather than call the dispute manager again, she told me she was opening my spreadsheet. She proceeded to walk through the calculations with me, describing the rates and the formulas. I jotted them down on paper as we went. Finally, we got to the final total calculation, and she said, “so this times the multiplier is … wait, it shouldn’t be.” She immediately put me on hold.\n\nA few minutes later, she came back, saying that she needed to have the accounting department look at my spreadsheet. My spreadsheet, implying that every customer has their own. She said that the dispute manager would, yet again, call me back in a few days.\n\nFour days later, the dispute manager called me back and explained that there was some sort of disagreement between billing and accounting, regarding the cause of the problem. Billing thought it was the spreadsheet and accounting thought it was the meter readings. She said she’d call back in a few more business days, after they’d worked out their differences.\n\nWhen she did call back, she leveled with me: accounting was wrong, there was an error in the spreadsheet, and after fixing the multiplier cell, my bill was reduced by a factor of 10. After the credit calculators, they determined that I had overpaid from the previous bill by about $100, and that I probably wouldn’t have a bill for the next two cycles. She apologized for how long it took to resolve the issue, but reassured me that it wouldn’t happen to me again.\n\nBut I wasn’t thinking about me at this point. I was thinking about all of the other customers, whose spreadsheets probably had the same error. Would the accountants audit all of the spreadsheets that copied the error? How many customers would call about the bills? How many would insist, like I did, that there was a spreadsheet error, and demand that it be properly diagnosed? And how much of this feedback would ever make it to the accountants writing the buggy spreadsheets?\n\nIdentifier: FH1208 Title: Flintshire County Council school cash blunder ‘down to spreadsheet error’ Source: http://www.flintshirechronicle.co.uk/flintshire-news/local-flintshire-news/2010/02/18/flintshire-county-council-school-cash-blunder-down-to-spreadsheet-error-51352-25856321/ Organization: Flintshire County Region: EU Release Date: 18 February 2010 Discrepancies: 1,000,000 Risk: Money Loss Tags: Government Spreadsheet Causes: Manual data entry\n\nA £1M council cash ‘cock-up’ which prompted calls for the resignation of a top Tory councillor was down to a spreadsheet error, it has been claimed.\n\nCounty Hall officials have not published details of an internal investigation carried out in the wake of the blunder, which left Flintshire Council £1m out of pocket after they over-allocated money cash to the county’s 12 high schools last year.\n\nBut the Chronicle understands the mix-up occurred because someone ‘put money in the wrong column’ – and no one spotted it before the money was handed out.\n\nIdentifier: FH1206 Title: $153 million error in Department of Energy Tax spreadsheet leaves reporter searching for the truth Source: http://www.pv-tech.org/chip_shots_blog/for_the_record_manufacturing_investment_tax_credit_typo_pushes_rec_solar_to Organization: Department of Energy Region: USA Release Date: 13 January 2010 Discrepancies: 153,300,000 Tags: Government\n\nWhose information should you trust more, an agency of the Federal government or a major solar company?

Stanford Group analyst Rebecca Jones Kujawa said in an interview. “…they were underestimating the cost of goods sold….it is likely CFO Eric Wong is being pushed out because of this error, which could demonstrate a material weakness in controls over financial reporting, an issue that usually leads to a lengthy review of accounting practices.” RedEnvelope spokeswoman Jordan Goldstein said the budgeting error was simply due to a number mis-recorded in one cell of a spreadsheet that then threw off the cost forecast and was unrelated to the CFO change.\n\nIdentifier: NS08 Source: University of Toledo loses $2.4M in projected revenue Organization: University of Toledo Release Date: May-04 Discrepancies: $2.4 million Risk: Loss of budget Avoidance: User training and certification\n\nUniversity of Toledo loses $2.4M in projected revenue. “While official UT projections call for a 10 percent decline in graduate student enrollment, an increase mistakenly was shown in a spreadsheet formula that led officials to overestimate enrollment and therefore revenue, Mr. Decatur said.” “Dr. Johnson said no job action will be taken against the employee who made the mistake, who has a good performance record. Officials will, however, pursue systemic changes to provide more safeguards in the future. “We have very competent people,” Dr. Johnson said. “I do think that the continuing fiscal pressures on universities have forced us to a level of staff support where there is little or no redundancy in the process.”\n\nIdentifier: NS09 Source: Fannie Mae Corrects Mistakes In Results Organization: Fannie Mae Release Date: Oct-03 Discrepancies: $1.2 billion Risk: Loss of shareholder confidence Avoidance: Peer review\n\nFannie Mae filed a Form 8-K/A with the SEC amending their third quarter press release to correct computational errors in that release. “There were honest mistakes made in a spreadsheet used in the implementation of a new accounting standard. The bottom line is that the correction has no impact on our income statement, but resulted in increases to unrealized gains on securities, accumulated other comprehensive income, and total shareholder equity (of $1.279 billion, $1.136 billion, and $1.136 billion, respectively)… the correction had to do with a computational error in performing complicated calculations required in the implementation of FAS 149.”\n\nIdentifier: NS10 Source: TransAlta Says Clerical Snafu Costs It $24 Million Organization: TransAlta Release Date: Jun-03 Discrepancies: $24 million Risk: Huge financial loss Avoidance: Peer review, double-checking outputs\n\nTransAlta Corp. said on Tuesday it will take a $24 million charge to earnings after a bidding snafu landed it more U.S. power transmission hedging contracts than it bargained for, at higher prices than it wanted to pay. […] the company’s computer spreadsheet contained mismatched bids for the contracts, it said. “It was literally a cut-and-paste error in an Excel spreadsheet that we did not detect when we did our final sorting and ranking bids prior to submission,” TransAlta chief executive Steve Snyder said in a conference call. “I am clearly disappointed over this event. The important thing is to learn from it, which we’ve done.” As New York ISO rules did not allow for a reversal of the bids, the contracts went ahead.\n\nIdentifier: NS11 Source: Allied Irish Banks / Allfirst Currency Trading Fraud Organization: Allied Irish Banks / Allfirst Release Date: Mar-02 Discrepancies: $700 million Risk: Fraud, huge financial loss Avoidance: Peer review, double-checking outputs\n\nAllfirst “Would not pay the US$ 10,000 for a direct data feed from Reuters to the risk control section”. Instead, they got Rusnak to download his Reuters feed into a spreadsheet. He then substituted links to his private manipulated spreadsheet. The total losses hidden by the fraud were almost US$700M. Rusnak exaggerated bonuses by over half a million dollars. Ray Butler points out in the article above that “One error in a spreadsheet will subvert all the controls in all the systems feeding into it”. An auditing tool (SpACE) would have found the external links in the key spreadsheet.\n\nIdentifier: NS12 Source: Jamaican Commercial Bank Failures Organization: Jamaican Commercial Bank Release Date: late 1990’s\n\n“Poor control over spreadsheets at Jamaican indigenous banks contributed to management information and external reporting problems (i.e., P&L distortions) that contributed to the banks’ management and external regulators losing sight of the banks’ true positions and exposures. This problem fed a downward spiral into liquidity crisis”[Lemieux, 2005] “As the Jamaican financial crisis unfolded, the government also recognised that fraud and corruption had contributed to the collapse of indigenous banks. To address these allegations, it established a team of foreign and local forensic auditors to work with the police fraud squad to identify and take action on instances of fraud. Inaccessibility of source documents, however, seriously hampered the auditors’ work. The work of reconstructing what in some cases were very convoluted financial transactions was made extremely difficult by the fact that critical records, many in spreadsheet form, were missing”. [Lemieux, 2005]\n\nIdentifier: NS13 Source: Computing error at Fidelity’s Magellan fund Organization: Fidelity’s Magellan fund Release Date: Jan-95 Discrepancies: $1.3 billion Risk: loss of share value Avoidance: independent review and comparison of source with output\n\n“There was a big flap recently over Fidelity’s Magellan fund estimating in November that they would make a $4.32/share distribution at the end of year, and then not doing so. A letter of explanation was sent to the shareholders (including me) from J. Gary Burkhead, the President of Fidelity, including the following pertinent items: “During the estimating process, a tax accountant is required to transcribe the net realized gain or loss from the fund’s financial records (which were correct at all times) to a separate spreadsheet, where additional calculations are performed. The error occurred when the accountant omitted the minus sign on a net capital loss of $1.3 billion and incorrectly treated it as a net capital gain on this separate spreadsheet. This meant that the dividend estimate spreadsheet was off by $2.6 billion…\n\nEuSpRIG Original Horror Stories\n\nThe original list, developed by Patrick O’Beirne, is still [here]\n\nCopyright acknowledgement\n\nNews items are the copyright of the original authors as cited by the link to the story source.\n\nEditing and comments copyright (c) 2003, 2004 Patrick O’Beirne, European Spreadsheet Risk Interest Group.
