10. 1-10-100 Quality Rule The 1-10-100 rule states that as work moves through a process, the cost of correcting an error increases by a factor of 10. Order entry example Activity Prevention Order entered correctly Inspection Error detected by billing dept Failure Error detected by customer Big Failure Cost of customers telling others © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates Cost $1 $ 10 $ 100 ??? 10

11. Error-Proofing Recognizes that every human will make errors. Methodology that is used to strive toward zero defects by either preventing or automatically detecting defects. Help people do the right thing; prevent them from doing the wrong thing.  Key Toyota principle – Respect for people. Errors become defects that require rework. © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates 11

12. Levels of Error-Proofing 1. Prevention   Make it impossible to make the error. Make it difficult to make the error. 2. Detection  Make it obvious the error has occurred. 3. No Impact  Make it a “no impact” error. © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates 12

13. Error-Proofing Tenets Common tendency (non-Lean mindset) is to blame people   “If they’d just be more careful…” “They’re being lazy…” Errors are not the result of careless or inattentive employees. Warning or “be careful” signs are not robust solutions (and may be insulting) Errors are evidence of a process design or environmental problem, not a people problem.  Lean mindset: “We (the organization) have failed you.” © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates 13

14. Quality: People aren’t the problem. The problem is generally rooted in: • Process design • Technology capabilities • Environmental conditions 14

15. Poor Input Quality Causes Unnecessary Tension Poorly designed processes are typically behind interpersonal and interdepartmental tension – not personalities. © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates

18. State of Quality in Office & Service Environments Office & service quality rarely measured. If measured, typically “end state” quality. “In process” quality is a far more revealing analytical tool, in terms of:     Determining how robust your process is Identifying waste Rebuilding interpersonal and interdepartmental relationships Capturing productivity gains © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates 18

21. Key Lean Metric: Quality %Complete and Accurate (%C&A)  % time downstream customer can perform task without having to “CAC” the incoming work:  Correct information or material that was supplied  Add information that should have been supplied  Clarify information that should or could have been clear   This output metric is measured by the immediate downstream customer and all subsequent downstream customers. If workers further downstream deem the output from a particular step to be less than 100%, multiply their assessment of quality with the previous assessments. © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates 21

37. Five Why’s Example Problem: Report is taking too much of an employee’s time; team questions whether the report is needed 1. Why is the error report being prepared?  My supervisor told me to. 2. Supervisor – Why are you asking for this report?  One of the standard reports to be prepared per my predecessor – I have yet to determine its usage. 3. Predecessor – Why did you initiate this report?  Report was required in the past because personnel in order entry were making data input errors. 4. Data entry – Why were orders being input with errors?  Orders received via fax were blurry and hard to read. 5. Data entry - Why were the fax orders hard to read?  Fax machine was old and of low quality. It was replaced 10 months ago and errors no longer are occurring.

38. Problem Analysis Tree Problem: Documents are not being translated well and on time In physical transit Lost docs* No tracking In cyberspace Large batches In in-basket Confusing formats In out-basket Poor original Late or poorly translated documents Translator doesn’t understand original Translation problems** Translator understands original, but still poor translation Faxed / poor resolution Random vocabulary Translator skills Selection Lack of training Wrong technical vocabulary Training No standard Poor editing Poorly expressed * Lost and found = 40%; lost & never found = 5%; stuck in system = 55% ** Rework on over 50% of documents Unclear expectations Uneven workload

Third, avoid passing errors to external customer. (Traditional priority) Typical non-Lean solution – Inspection! © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates 47

48. Priorities for Designing ErrorProofing into the Process 1. Make it impossible to make the error. 2. Make it harder to make the error. 3. Make it obvious the error has occurred. 4. Make the system robust so it tolerates the error. © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates 48

Third, avoid passing errors to external customer. Design robust processes with:   No errors No “impact errors” if errors occur at all We have a tendency to be less diligent when we know a downstream inspection will occur. 58

59. Establishing a Quality Culture Remove all obstacles to an employee’s success      Adequate time for quality work Pressure-free Effective training Robust processes Automation Make problems visible Stop “the line” / fix problems immediately Honesty is honored; Blame-free Improvement-oriented Inspection is a last resort, not the first solution. © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates 59

60. Types of Inspection Self-inspection (point of origin inspection) – most desirable Downstream inspection – less desirable (we’re less diligent) 3rd party inspection before it reaches an external customer – adds excess cost 3rd party inspection after the fact – NO! © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates 60

Ways to Error-Proof Data Entry Environment       Information enhancement Audible or visual warnings Physical workspace Reduce noise, smells, interruptions Adequate breaks Rethink production standards Technology  Process  Simplify!

62. Ways to Error-Proof Data Entry (continued) Process-related  Standardized work  Proper sequencing (logical order of work)  Job aids & visual reminders  Checklists  Verbalize information  Repeat orders  Measurement & feedback © 2010 Karen Martin & Associates System-related  Software  Drop-down menus instead of free text field  Required fields  Pop-up warnings  Programming / macros  Hardware  Dual monitors  Ergonomic considerations 62

63. Error-Proofing  Help people do the right thing; prevent them from doing the wrong thing (e.g. automation, physical restrictions, warnings)  Create easy standard work tools (e.g. checklists)  Provide adequate training & retraining   Visual work instructions See one, do one, teach one  Send work back upstream for completion and/or correction and follow-up with add’l training  Have customer requirements discussions with upstream suppliers 63

64. Quality-at-the-Source Make problems visual The work stops immediately when an error is detected! Cross-trained workers are better at detecting errors DO NOT RELY ON INSPECTION!!! 64

65. Reasons for Errors Lack of training Lack of standardization Overly complicated processes Time delays between input and output Multi-tasking Interruptions Rushing Ambiguous information    Unclear instruction Poor handwriting Blurry images (technology-related) 65
