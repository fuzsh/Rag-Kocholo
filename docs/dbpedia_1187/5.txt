Kansas City Chiefs' tight end Travis Kelce couldn't help but poke fun at former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick. The reason is fairly straight forward and even kind of predictable: his romance with the young Jordon Hudson. She is 24 years old and Bill is currently 72. This new couple has been getting roasted online ruthlessly due to their age difference but one Travis Kelce had to get in on the action. It was a light hearted comment he made but it has some praising undertones that suggest he agrees with the massive age gap. When the majority of people are not approving of this new couple, Travis Kelce chose to praise coach Belichick for dating a woman who is vastly younger than he is.

Travis Kelce's nickname for Bill Belichick

During a recent 'New Heights' episode, Jason Kelce stated he wouldn't ant to go there when asked about the new relationship but Travis couldn't help himself. He said: "He's killing it." With a snarky response that didn't need much explanation. Clearly he is having fun with everything that this situation is producing. Before saying that, he also referred to Jordon Hudson as Bill Belichick's daughter, which can be considered extremely creepy from Travis. Previous to that, Barstool Sports' Dave Portnoy asked people to chill out on the vitriol against the new couple.

Despite all the online reactions coming directed at the former coach and his girlfriend, none of them have spoken publicly about the topic. They have been spotted in public already and Jordon Hudson does have a history of dating older men. In fact, Hudson's ex boyfriend is actually 64 years old. It's impossible to know how long this new relationship will last but it is certainly one of the most eyebrow rising stories in the NFL right now. It took everybody by surprise that nobody was expecting. Can you take a guess of how long this relationship will last? What isyour reaction to Travis Kelce praising Bill?
