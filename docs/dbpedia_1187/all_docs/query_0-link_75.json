        "text": "As fashion's biggest night out, The Met Gala is the prime opportunity to make a statement.\n\nBut for Vogue boss and the event's long-time organiser Anna Wintour, it was not her sartorial choice that got people talking on Monday night, but her relationship status.\n\nThe 73 year old appeared to give credence to speculation she has been dating Bill Nighy, as she walked the red carpet on the actor's arm.\n\nAnna and Page Eight star Bill have been close friends for years but have long been embroiled in romance rumours. In 2018, they were spotted attending a theatre show together in London but a blasé Bill is thought to have replied, 'There are a lot of rumours about me and probably about Anna.'\n\nThen three years later, the pair enjoyed several intimate dinners in Italy, before sparking romance rumours again a year later when they attended a screening of Bill's 2022 film, Living, together.\n\nThe red carpet appearance has got the internet talking. One Twitter user wrote, 'Can’t focus on the Met Gala looks rn [right now] I'm too wrapped up in finding out everything about Anna Wintour and Bill Nighy’s relationship.'\n\nSomeone replied calling their rumoured partnership 'goals', while a second wrote, 'They’re both 73. I actually love when older people date people their own age. Not everyday dating someone 20-30 years younger.'\n\nA third called them 'the true British Royal couple'.\n\nHas Anna Wintour Been Married?\n\nYes, twice. Her first husband was David Shaffer, a child psychiatrist who she was married to between 1984 and 1999.\n\nShe then started dating entrepreneur Shelby Bryan, they tied the knot in 2004 but are alleged to have parted ways in October 2020.\n\nDoes Anna Wintour Have Any Children?\n\nShe has a son Charles, 38 and daughter Bee, 35, with David.\n\nHas Bill Nighy Been Married?\n\nNo, but he was in a relationship with actress Diana Quirk between 1982 and 2008.\n\nDoes Bill Nighy Have Any Children?"
