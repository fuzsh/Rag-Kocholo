        "text": "Bill Gates's daughter confirms dating Arthur Donald\n\nForget billionaire heiress meets rockstar royalty, it's tech titan's daughter finds love with the legendary Beatle's grandson. “My boyfriend, Arthur, giving me a lift post-ceremony,” Phoebe shared on her Instagram alongside an adorable picture of the duo where Arthur can be seen carrying her on his back. The youngest of Bill and Melinda's three children earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Human Biology and appears to be documenting her journey on social media.\n\nAlso read: Nevada judge denies release of ex-gang leader ahead of trial in 1996 killing of Tupac Shakur\n\nPhoebe and Arthur have been rumoured to be dating for eight months now, but neither of them confirmed it until recently. The romance rumour first sparked in October 2023 when her Paris adventure, documented on Instagram, featured Arthur tagged in one of the photos, with him present as well. Later, according to Page Six, the duo attended the “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans” premiere. When interviewed by a media outlet, she declined to give any insight into her relationship status.\n\nIn one more photo, the couple can be seen hugging each other in shades of blue while posing for the camera. \"With Arthur, he cleans up nicely,\" she continued.\n\nWho is Bill Gates's daughter dating?\n\nBill Gates' youngest child, has two siblings: her sister Jennifer, 28, and her brother Rory, 25. While Phoebe, 21, just graduated from Stanford in a science field in an impressive three years (beating the typical four-year program), her love interest, Arthur, 25, is the eldest grandchild of music legend Sir Paul McCartney. He's the firstborn son of Mary McCartney, Paul's daughter, and her former husband, Alistair Donald, making him the oldest of McCartney's eight grandchildren."
