        "text": "The 2023 NFL season wasn’t just about football. It was about romance.\n\nMore specifically, it was about the lovefest between superstar entertainer Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nNot everybody was a believer. Some thought the Swift-Kelce romance was a giant publicity stunt, designed to make rich people richer.\n\nAs a true romantic, I can’t relate to such cynicism. I can imagine Swift and Kelce getting married, retiring in marital bliss, and raising a bunch of Swifties.\n\nGlenn writes: Taylor Swift is 34 years old going on 14. The most immature billionaire in the world.\n\nShe’s been in it for the chase with her past romances. After witnessing Kelce's temper tantrums on the sideline, she’d better back off this one too. As with her other breakups, she can then write another hit song about her latest.\n\nMy response: The title of the song could be: “Broken Tackles and Broken Hearts.”\n\nJames writes: Regarding Swift-Kelce, I don’t think it is real and it will last until after the election. I am beyond Swifty fatigue as I am in exhaustion territory.\n\nI abhor celebrities as a rule but Swift and her cult of worshippers are in a special category. I admire the greatness of Mahomes, but Mr. Pfizer is now on my naughty list.\n\nMy response: Kelce’s commercials extolling the virtues of Pfizer injections for COVID didn’t play well with me, either. I developed a massive blood clot after getting the booster shot. So did plenty of other people.\n\nI do love watching Patrick Mahomes, though.\n\nThe 49ers had a better overall team than the Chiefs. But they didn’t have Mahomes.\n\nShemp writes: Swift is a brilliant, talented personality and business woman. Kelce is Taylor-made to promote and expand her entry into the megabucks of the NFL. They will have some fun times and she will drop him and move on.\n\nI don't think Kelce will end up as a greeter at a Boardwalk hotel though.\n\nMy response: But I could see him decking someone in a Boardwalk hotel bar.\n\nBill writes: I was mildly tolerant of the media coverage but soured on the whole thing when Kelce threw his fit on the sideline at the Super Bowl. I’ve seen all I want to see of him (including State Farm commercials).\n\nShe seems more genuine to me if a bit immature for her age, so I’m OK for the star struck Swifties commercials to continue. No more VIP booth reactions to what’s happening on the field, though.\n\nMy response: Kelce lost some fans when he bumped coach Andy Reid off balance. He would be better off if – before making a heat-of-the-moment decision – he asked himself: “What would Patrick do?”\n\nColorado Mark writes: if I hear her name or see her face, I automatically hit the shun button, I would rather eat 6 month old roadkill from the top of Cameron Pass than subject any of my 5 senses to anything having to do with that girl.\n\nMy response: I don’t know how long it will take the Swifties to track you down and descend on your house with great wrath. Prediction: A few months.\n\nPrepare yourself for a “Cruel Summer.”\n\nChris writes: I don’t care about Swift-Kelce. Put her on the TV as much as you want, just be sure the game is on.\n\nMy response: You just want football. That once made you the NFL’s target audience. But not anymore.\n\nThe NFL has become all about expanding its audience − from Swifties, to Europeans to South Americans. It’s trying to hit every demographic.\n\nEventually, the league will schedule a game on the Moon, and Swift will validate the occasion by performing at halftime.\n\nADAMS: Readers weigh in on Rick Barnes' postseason shortcomings with Tennessee basketball\n\nVols Mark writes: I’ve chosen to tune out all the noise surrounding the romance between Swift and Kelce. If it’s real, I genuinely hope it brings them happiness. Enduring the relentless scrutiny of the world must be excruciating.\n\nSurviving that seems like a feat with greater odds than the Titans making it to the Super Bowl next year.\n\nMy response: The odds of the Titans making the next Super Bowl currently are 150-1.\n\nJohn Adams is a senior columnist.
