        "text": "William Brangham:\n\nIn the midst of the pandemic, a woman tells her three grown daughters a story of her youth about a love affair, a path that she might have taken, but didn't. They in turn tell her of their hopes or fears for the future.\n\n\"Tom Lake\" is the latest novel by renowned writer Ann Patchett, who also owns an independent bookstore in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nJeffrey Brown joined her in New Hampshire recently for our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nAnn Patchett, Author, \"Tom Lake\": Wow.\n\nAnn Patchett:\n\nShe is not there to try out for the role of Emily. She's there to register the people who have come to try out for the play. And they're so bad that she decides after four hours of listening to auditions that she's just going to get up and read the lines in a straightforward way, because she loves the play.\n\nAnn Patchett:\n\nYes, Yes.\n\n\"Tom Lake\" definitely started with \"Our Town.\" Somebody said to me recently: \"So how did you decide which play Lara is going to be in, in high school?\"\n\nAnd I was like: \"Oh, no, no, no, I started with 'Our Town' and then figured out who the characters were.\"\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nWilder based his fictional town of Grover's Corners on the real-life New Hampshire town of Peterborough, where he also produced it with the Peterborough Players, a professional summer stock theater.\n\nHe'd conceived and written part of it in a small cabin at MacDowell, the famed artists residency program in Peterborough. And that's where we met Patchett, who had herself once had a residency here, to talk about a novel in which Lara, now an adult, tells her three grown daughters the story of her long-ago summer romance with a young man who would become a world-famous actor.\n\nAnn Patchett:\n\nShe's not going to tell her daughters the whole story, but nobody ever tells anybody the whole story. I mean, we all edit our stories based on our audience.\n\nI'm going to tell a story to my husband one way, to my best friend one way, to you one way. It's not that you're lying. It's just that you shape your story to fit your audience.\n\nAnn Patchett:\n\nI wrote the whole book on the treadmill desk, so I walked the whole book. And for whatever reason, it just thrilled me. I would get up in the morning and think, I'm ready to go to work, I'm going to get on the treadmill desk, I'm going to go write my book.\n\nAnd I have never felt that way before. It was a joy.\n\nAnn Patchett:\n\n\"There is no explaining this simple truth about life. You will forget much of it. The painful things you would be certain you would never be able to let go of, now you're not entirely sure when they happened, while the thrilling parts, the heart-stopping joys, splintered and scattered and became something else. Memories are then replaced by different joys and larger sorrows. And, unbelievably, those things get knocked aside as well.\"\n\nAnn Patchett:\n\nOne of the things that this book is about that I am so struck by is, when I was in my 20s, I worried if I had enough money to go out to dinner. We would go to the matinee because we don't have enough money to go at night. We will go to the restaurant, but we will just get a piece of pie. I really want to get this story written. Maybe I will send the story to a magazine.\n\nThat's what I was worried about. At the bookstore — I own a bookstore in Nashville, Parnassus. We have all these employees, a lot of them in their 20s and 30s. And that's not what they're worried about. I mean, they're worried about the pandemic. They're worried about climate change. They're worried about gerrymandering. They're worried about the right to love who you love.\n\nI mean, it's — the weight of things that young people have to worry about today is so different from the things that I worried about when I was young.\n\nAnn Patchett:\n\nThings aren't great in Tennessee. The people who are banning books don't care about books. You don't ever ban something you care about.\n\nYou want to keep kids safe? Ban guns. You want to keep kids safe? Maybe don't let them bring their phones into school. But nobody is going to keep a child safe by keeping a book from them. And yet by making the conversation about the book, then no one on either side has the energy to talk about the things that really matter. Schools really matter. Teachers, librarians really matter."
