        "text": "I only give it five stars, so that the review gets read. Do not download and install this app. I have had nothing but problems.\n\nThis app uses more battery than any of my other apps, including similar book apps. In just minutes it heats up my phone to dangerous levels (no other app. I use heats up my phone.).\n\nThe grammar in the story Iâve read is atrocious. English is obviously not the first language of the author, and they obviously do not use a proofreader before publishing a book. There are numerous errors such as using present tense instead of past tense, misspellings that make a sentence unreadable. And each chapterâs mistakes are worse than the previous chapter, to the point where thereâs multiple errors in most paragraphs, which makes it just too annoying to read\n\nHere are just a few of the incorrect word uses: bugger/burger, dare/dear, dose/does, tear/their. Now imaging multiple mistakes like those in a 2-3 sentence paragraph. To alloying to continue, even though the story plot was interesting, itâs too annoying to try to read when you have to figure out trying to say because of their mistakes.\n\nDear Customer,\n\nWe are continually working on improving our app and your feedback is a great help for future development. Our developers will analyze the situation that you informed us about and try to find out what can be done to resolve it. We will also report it to our authors so that the issue with mistakes will be resolved. Still, please help us to get more information so that we can successfully resolve the issues you have faced. Please, contact us at support@passionapp.co, and we will get back to you promptly.\n\nPassion Team, Miia\n\nI downloaded the app through a promotional on Instagram. When I created my account it didnât recognize that I had already paid $6.99 for access for a week. I reached out to support and got a quick response. However, they told me that I needed to reach out to my bank because it showed that it was still pending status to see about having it be authorized to go through. My bank told me that it wasnât going to go through for two days and it was the merchant that put that stipulation on there so because I wanted to continue reading I subscribed for $.99 â¦ annnnd I still was not given access. I thought maybe I needed to log out and log back in for it to recognize that I signed up for the subscription. Well when I logged in I chose the option to continue with Apple ID when I tried to log back in utilizing the same option, it said that I couldnât because it was a duplicate account so instead of logging me in using my Apple ID and attempting to create another account. when I reached out to support about me, not being able to continue reading after subscribing, I was told that it can take up to 24 hours for my coins to load. I didnât purchase coins I purchase the ability to access the entire app. I then message them back telling them I no longer have the ability to access the app, and I have yet to receive a response. Iâve never had so much trouble being able to access something Iâve already paid for.\n\nLike others, I rated this app 5 stars just to get my review posted. I should have read the reviews first before downloading. Stories are badly written, but I was bored and became mildly interested in a couple of them. However, each story requires a large number of coins for each chapter or an hours long wait period for the next chapter. So I decided to sign up for a 3-day free trial to see if it would be worth it. I didnât realize at the time that after the free trial, Iâll be charged $7.99 a WEEK (!) for the subscription. This is insane! These stories are nowhere worth that. However, even with the subscription, I canât open any of the stories without coins or waiting, so Iâm not even sure what the subscription is for. The whole thing is just a scam. I have canceled my subscription and Iâve taken a screenshot of the cancellation to prove I did it 24 hours before the renewal. Iâve read other people have been charged over and over again even after cancelling, but Iâm prepared to fight this if it happens. Once Iâve confirmed Iâm not going to be charged, Iâll delete the app. What a waste!"
