        "text": "Bill Avery is a former Mountie Inspector/forensic investigator who arrives in Hope Valley for a mine explosion investigation. After he left the Mounties, he became the Hope Valley Sheriff and later, a judge. He is portrayed by Jack Wagner.\n\nBackground[]\n\nBill originally came to Coal Valley to investigate the mine disaster. He co-owned Abigail's Cafe with Abigail and served the town as sheriff, and later, judge. Bill was Jack Jr.'s godfather.\n\nStoryline[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nBill went undercover investigating counterfeit money. He suspected there was an inside man and continued working the case against his supervisor’s orders. Eventually, Jack caught him red handed with counterfeit plates and arrested him. Bill and Abigail were in a relationship until Bill’s wife Nora showed up in Hope Valley and Abigail learned he was still legally married.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nBill quit being a Mountie because he feels he works best when he doesn’t answer to anyone. He got Dottie Ramsey her husband's life insurance payout. He closed the cafe early to cook a special meal for Dottie and they shared a kiss. Ultimately, they decided to remain friends. He started investigating suspicious accidents that kept happening at the sawmill.\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nSeason 5[]\n\nSeason 6[]\n\nBill was distrustful of Lucas and decided to investigate him after Fiona shared her concerns. He called the New Orleans Police Department and found out they hadn’t heard of Lucas.[1]\n\nBill rode to Cape Fullerton to testify in the trial of two gunrunners who had committed crimes in the Northern Territories. When he got there, he discovered the charges had been dropped and the criminals released. He confronted the judge and forced him to tell him what happened and to sign a new arrest warrant.[2]\n\nBill located an old friend, Jeremiah, who greeted him with gunshots. Bill asked Jeremiah to guide him through a shortcut in hopes of catching the gunrunners. Jeremiah led Bill through an abandoned mine. With his help, Bill arrested the criminals.[2]\n\nThe Governor offered Bill a judgeship. He sent his chief of staff to meet with Bill.[3]\n\nSeason 7[]\n\nSeason 8[]\n\nBill's friendship with Nathan[]\n\nBill agreed to watch the town while Nathan went to take money to Dylan, Allie's father in exchange for him leaving them alone. Bill thought it was a bad idea and he was right. [4] Bill discusses with Nathan about how to make Allie's adoption official. Bill said it was a bad idea as it would going to require notices in the paper and that might kick up dust that Nathan isn't ready to kick up. While they are discussing it, Bill mentions he has a piece of land he's trying to get rid of. Nathan expresses desire to possibly purchase it. Nathan also confides in Bill that the money to send away Dylan was gotten from Lucas. Bill is surprised he would ask for the loan from him. [5]\n\nBill tells Nathan that someone else is interested in buying the land. Nathan says he no longer is interested. They discuss Nathan's case and Bill inquires as to why Hargraves, the super intendent who is in charge of the case, has a grudge against Nathan. Nathan refuses to confide in Bill. [6] Elizabeth asks Bill to look into what Hargraves has against Nathan. Bill asks Hargraves who like Nathan, refuses to say. [7] Bill and Nathan once again discuss his case and again Bill inquires into what Hargraves has against him. Nathan denies anything is going on. [6]\n\nBill testifies in the case against Nathan. He was there with him during the arrest. He said that Constable Grant handled the situation well. He had everything under control after they were ambushed by Jenny O'Rourke. She was there to release her brother, the fugitive, Constable Novak drew his gun which caused the prisoner to call out alerting Jenny who fired at Novak killing him. The problem is, Bill did not see the actual firing take place as he was too busy looking at the Novak. Later on Bill is confided in by Nathan who tells Bill the story of what happened at Fort Clay. Nathan was disciplined when he disobeyed Hargraves orders. He knows Hargraves is after his badge in which Nathan said let him take it. When questioned, Nathan confirms that he did not know Jack. He also confesses that Elizabeth does not know that he was ever in Fort Clay. [8] During the inquiry, Hargraves tries to trap Nathan into second guesses himself asking what would have happened if he had released the prisoner to re-track him down later on saving Novak's life but Bill reminded that another scenario could have happened where Jenny may have shot them all. Bill takes it upon himself to confront Hargraves in the saloon. Hargraves tries to tell Bill about all that has happened at Fort Clay and Bill tells him not to punish Nathan for his past. In his hurry, he does not notice Molly who is trying to impress him with a new outfit. [8] Nathan's adoption of Allie is finally official. Nathan thanks Bill for all he does. [9] At the ceremony, there is only Bill, Elizabeth, Allie and Nathan. [10]\n\nRomance[]\n\nBill wonders why Fiona is being so secretive but runs into Molly while trying to figure it out. Both comment on how the other should not snoop around. [4] Bill goes to dinner with Helen, Lucas's mom. During the dinner, Molly saw them and was jealous. Bill didn't notice until Helen told him that he had a fan. Molly thinking she embarrassed herself, avoided Bill. Bill admitted that he has been single a while and didn't notice she was interested but Molly denies it telling him not to flatter himself. [11]\n\nAfter seeing Molly later on (after he doesn't comment on her dress originally) he finally tells her, \"Molly that was some dress\" suggesting he did indeed appreciate the outfit after all. [8] Later on Bill goes in for a haircut. Molly is already there getting her hair styled. Clara explains it's women's day at the barbershop. Bill is annoyed but leaves acknowledging he knows that Molly is there in the chair despite the towel is over her head. Then he goes into the saloon wondering when was the last time a male has gotten a haircut. Jesse and Mike are there and admitted they go but are always told it's women's day. Bill is annoyed as he isn't thrilled a woman is cutting his hair and now is not always available. [12]\n\nMolly comes to visit Bill at his office. She asks him to put on his Mountie uniform one more time promising it will fit (she fixed it for him). She assures him that \"it is the man who makes the uniform, not the other way around.\" He does and puts on a show for everyone posing for a picture while having his horse rear up. [13]\n\nAt Ned and Florence's party, Bill mimics something and Molly is the only one able to guess. [14]\n\nAt Florence and Ned's wedding, during the dancing, Bill dances with Molly. He thanks her for fixing his uniform for him and complicates her on how pretty she looks. [15]\n\nBill and the Café[]\n\nBill is still working at the cafe owning half the business. Bill tries to make Chili having Fiona, Clara and Faith all tasted it. Molly told Bill to \"to keep it a secret\" where the others faked approval. Finally Bill tasted it deciding it was awful. [11] Bill helps with the explosion of the mine then serves extra pancakes to the heroes involved. [16] Bill while serving Jesse and hearing the dress shop might close, offers for Jesse and Clara to buy into the café as it would mean more hours, better income and more responsibility. Clara is excited but Jesse is not. They decline. [17] Bill brings the wrong food to Lee who then offers to let him vent. Bill declines. [13]\n\nAt the cafe, Bill notices that Jesse is gone and comments to Clara about this. She is upset because he has broken her trust twice now. [18] Clara later on confides in Bill that she is ready to ask Jesse to come home. Bill tells her that it isn't a bad thing. It sounds like she's ready to forgive Jesse. [19]\n\nFriendships[]\n\nBill helps the newly arrived Joseph to find a home then welcomes him to Hope Valley. [4] Together they officiated the wedding of Florence and Ned. [15]\n\nAt Ned and Florence's wedding, Bill heard Ned talking to Carson about having cold feet. Bill brings Ned to Lee, Hickam and Jesse. Jesse comments that marriage is hard. [15]\n\nHenry comes to Bill to let him know he has done his best to ensure the safety of the mine but if anyone wishes to open a case about it, he has made a list of those who were involved. Bill notices Henry has put his own name on the top of the list. Bill questions his judgement stating if he is convicted, he will go to jail. Henry doesn't seem bothered by that. Bill wonders if Henry is trying to get a clean slate and say goodbye. Henry doesn't confirm or deny that accusation. [20]\n\nBill's Inner Battle[]\n\nBill gets a letter requesting him to return his Mountie uniform. The town did not even realize that he even had a Mountie uniform as he has never worn it. He puts it on and it doesn't fit right. He is disappointed. [17] Lee asks Bill to look for a pocket watch he has lost (the one Christopher stole). While he is there, Lee asks to try on the jacket when he sees it. Bill allows him after giving a speech after how he had earned and was upset at having to return it. All Lee can say when he puts on the jacket is, \"Wow!\". [10]\n\nBill as a Mountie[]\n\nBill stops by Henry's to ask about when Christopher arrives. He is trying to determine if the car's arrival matches Christopher's arrival. Henry gets upset about the fact Bill is accusing Christopher. It gets so heated that Nathan comes in to calm them down reminding Bill not to toss around accusations especially about people being guilty by association. [21] Bill helped Nathan to look over the car that Christopher secretly had stolen to arrive in Hope Valley. Neither found anything helpful. [22] Bill was determined to find out how the car got from being borrowed by a neighbor and being taken for a joy ride to Hope Valley. He kept dusting for prints. He's determined to find the answer despite the fact that the owner doesn't care and just wants his car back. [23] Finally he was inspired and placed a foot against the roof of the car. Sure enough there is a shoe print there. Bill has solved part of the mystery. Now whose shoe is it? [24] Bill goes to talk to Christopher to find out he left to find Rachel. So Bill goes to talk to Henry who has nothing more to offer. [22]\n\nBill speaks to Wyman who is no longer in jail. Wyman thanks Bill for getting him out but Bill answers saying that he's only out as he returned Jesse's money. Wyman said he returned it because he felt they would later regret it when the town grew. Bill asked Wyman why he was so sure that the board would allow his factory. Wyman said the factory would bring jobs and money which is in everyone's interest. Bill wonders how his employees would feel knowing he's buying out properties for personal money. Bill watches Wyman leave his office but Wyman is stopped by Spurlock who says something quietly to him and Bill can't hear it. [25] Jesse wonders why Bill let Wyman go free. Bill explains what happened was a legitimate businessdeal as hee anticipates the town growing. Jesse assumes that no one will want to make the same deal again once Rosemary's article gets out in her paper but Bill is not so convinced. Jesse and Clara are just happy to have their money back and each other again. [20]\n\nBill talks to Nathan who thinks the Pinkertons are going to be here for a while.
