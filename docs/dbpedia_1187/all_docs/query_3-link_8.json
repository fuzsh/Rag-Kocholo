        "text": "ONE\n\nThe Thematics of a Form: Waverley and American Romance\n\nIn the summer the sun pours down torrents of fire on La Mancha, and frequently the burning earth produces the effect of a mirage. The water which we see is not real water, but there is something real in it: its source. This bitter source, which produces the water of the mirage, is the desperate dryness of the land. We can experience a similar phenomenon in two directions: one simple and straight, seeing the water which the sun depicts as actual; another, ironic, oblique, seeing it as a mirage, that is to say, seeing through the coolness of the water the dryness of the earth in disguise. The ingenuous manner of experiencing imaginary and significant things is found in the novel of adventure, the tale, the epic; the oblique manner in the realistic novel. The latter needs the mirage to make us see it as such. So it is not only that Quixote was written against the books of chivalry, and as a result bears them within it, but that the novel as a literary genre consists essentially of such an absorption.\n\n—Ortega, Meditations on Quixote\n\nFor Ortega literary genres are at once historic and thematic categories, “certain basic themes, mutually exclusive,” a particular literary genre being “at one and the same time a certain thing to be said and the only way to say it fully.”1 Because each epoch is a “basic interpretation of man … each epoch prefers a particular genre” (113). The novel, genre of the modern epoch, is born of the Renaissance’s discovery of the “me ipsum, the consciousness, the subjective” (138) and names a “basic poetic content” (113) that can best be described in terms of a thematics of perception and interpretation. Don Quixote focuses on the shifting play between hallucinated and oblique modes of reading, and all subsequent novels, which “bear Quixote within [them] like an inner filigree” (162), echo that troubling relationship.\n\nThe law of the modern and the law of the novel, then, is a mode of reading or understanding that results in the “criticism,” “destruction,” and “absorption” (139) of one book by another. From this point of view the history of the novel may be seen as a history of reading that takes the form of putting into question a process that seems at first to possess the force and dignity of a natural arrangement.2 As Frank Kermode perceptively observes, the novel seems “somehow a substitute for critical thought about the interpretation of earlier narrative.”3 In that sense it is a manner of reading that is a writing, an oblique, ironic “seeing” that at once reveals the innocence of naive narratives and naive readers and uses that innocence as a mode of self creation. “By itself, seen in a direct way,” Ortega writes, “reality, the actual … would never be poetic” (139). But when we consider it “obliquely,” through the lenses of the “mirage,” we perform the reading that is at once destructive and creative.\n\nThis is the logic that allows us to see Don Quixote as establishing the basic pattern and enabling theme for the genre: two kinds of text, the romance and the novel, the old and the new, with the new directed against the old, which is regarded as naive, mystified, and potentially dangerous, but at the same time tied to it and dependent on it as a point of departure; and two kinds of reader, the one naive and innocent, enchanted by the magic of story and doomed by his or her very involvement to disillusionment, and the other, serious, critical, and interpretive, suspicious of story as leading away from productive, active involvement with the text and the world of which it is a part, but, at the same time, aware of the undeniable pleasures associated with its magic.4\n\nA particularly interesting version of this pattern exists in the eighteenth-century English fiction, in those texts that have been said to mark the “rise of the novel.” Both the novelists and their critics were vitally interested in the possibly subversive effects that fiction could have on readers, especially the naive and innocent ones. For these readers, novels and romances might serve as instruments of debauchery capable of perverting the imagination, turning the head, and making young ladies unfit for marriage.5 According to one reviewer, “wild scenes” in novels “excite, tend to debauch the mind, and throw an insipid kind of uniformity over the moderate and rational prospects of life, consequently adventures are sought for and created, when duties are neglected, and content despised.”6 This remarkable and frightening power presumably derives from the novel’s ability to excite the curiosity and thereby to divert the attention from the real world to a world of make-believe that is found so absorbing that one becomes apathetic to real life.7 Apologists for the novel as well as its detractors acknowledge fiction’s magical powers, but its defenders, following the example of earlier apologists for poetry and drama, point to the way that magic may be used for moral and pedagogical ends. Through the careful use of novels and romances the “Rigour of Precepts” may be mollified by the “Allurements of Example.”8 Because they entertain, novels may also instruct, but it is important that the entertainment function remain subordinate to the principle of instruction.9\n\nTo the readers of Richardson and Defoe, of course, this is a familiar theme, one of the most interesting versions of which appears in the preface to Moll Flanders.\n\nBut as this Work is chiefly recommended to those who know how to Read it, and how to make the good Uses of it, which the Story all along recommends to them; so it is to be hop’d that such Readers will be much more pleas’d with the Moral, than the Fable; with the Application, than with the Relation, and with the End of the Writer, than with the Life of the Person written of.10\n\nDefoe distinguishes here between two kinds of readers, one naively fascinated by adventure who focuses on the “Fable,” the other, more serious, primarily interested in the “end of the Writer” and the productive “Application” of the text. It is the second, one supposes, who knows how properly to read the text and make the “good Uses of it, which the Story all along recommends,” though the passage is ambiguous enough to raise questions. But one point is clear: Defoe sees that the magic of “Fable” is capable of charming even the serious, productive reader. “The Moral ‘tis hop’d will keep the Reader serious, even where the Story might incline him to be otherwise” (4). So powerful are the attractions of the private pleasures that story offers, pleasures that may be both erotic and perverse, that they threaten to overwhelm those associated with communal and interpretive activities. Defoe seems to be suggesting here that reading is only superficially related to interpretation, the latter being an activity that is at once more serious and less interesting. This is an attitude that Frank Kermode describes as a “cultural myth” that is “attached specifically to the reading of fictional narrative,”11 and one, I would add, that is born from the “absorption” that marks the novel as genre. For the “modern” text always contains within itself the earlier narrative and the unfounded assumptions that give it the transparency of a simple tale. And, as Kermode observes, the “mere existence of a story-line, and the more or less traditional devices by which a text can pretend to establish the authenticity of its account of the world, can insure the abandonment of strenuous analytic activity.”12 Even the serious reader may be overwhelmed by the unreality of the story and give in to his desire to see the narrative knot unraveled, the secret of the text revealed. And since this possibility is inscribed within the text itself, it poses a disturbing problem for the author as well as the reader. The author must not only contend with the spell of story, find a way to work with illusions without being deluded, but also establish a contract with the reader that will insure that their relation is grounded on the important rather than the trivial. In short, the author must find a way to establish and maintain authority as an author in the face of a deviant energy that threatens to subvert the dignity and importance of writing.\n\nThe emphasis on moral and religious instruction in Richardson’s and Defoe’s prefaces and the critical commentaries by their contemporaries represents one attempt to control—one might say rationalize—the magic of story. A different but related effort occurs in the fiction and criticism of Sir Walter Scott with results that influence at least a generation of English and American novelists.13 Early in Waverley the narrator interrupts his brief sketch of Waverley Honour to offer an apology to the reader.\n\nI beg pardon, once and for all, of those readers who take up novels merely for amusement, for plaguing them so long with old-fashioned politics, and Whig and Tory, and Hanoverians and Jacobites. The truth is, I cannot promise them that this story shall be intelligible, not to say probable, without it. My plan requires that I should explain the motives on which its action proceeded; and these motives necessarily arose from the feelings, prejudices, and parties, of the times. I do not invite my fair readers, whose sex and impatience give them the greatest right to complain of these circumstances, into a flying chariot drawn by hippogriffs, or moved by enchantment. Mine is a humble English post-chaise, drawn upon four wheels, and keeping his majesty’s highway. Such as dislike the vehicle may leave it at the next halt, and wait for the conveyance of Prince Hussein’s tapestry, or Malek the Weaver’s flying sentry-box. Those who are contented to remain with me will be occasionally exposed to the dulness inseparable from heavy roads, steep hills, sloughs, and other terrestrial retardations; but, with tolerable horses and a civil driver, (as the advertisements have it,) I engage to get as soon as possible into a more picturesque and romantic country, if my passengers incline to have some patience with me during my first stages. (W, 89–90)\n\nHere the narrator seeks to establish the rules that will govern the relation between writer and reader, rules that will impose restraints on both the I that writes and the you that reads. Following the example of Fielding in Tom Jones, he figures the writer and reader as “Fellow-Travellers in a Stage-Coach”14 and offers the novel as a mode of travel that will take the reader—albeit slowly—away from the familiar surroundings of the English countryside to the more romantic landscape of the Scottish Lowlands and Highlands. And in so doing he distinguishes his work from those which are “written and read merely on account of the exercise which they afford to the imagination of those who, like the poet Collins, love to riot in the luxuriance of Oriental fiction, to rove through the meanders of enchantment, to gaze on the magnificence of golden palaces, and to repose by the water-falls of Elysian gardens.”15 These are the readers who, “too idle to read, save for the purpose of amusement” and addicted to the “fairy-land of fiction,”16 prefer to travel in purely imaginative worlds. They have no patience with ordinary modes of transportation and no interest in local people and places. But if the narrator differentiates his work from those that are written to appeal to such readers by emphasizing his commitment to the ordinary and familiar, he does not suggest that he intends completely to replace the “splendid scenes of an imaginary world” with a “correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him.”17 That is the way of Jane Austen.\n\nUpon the whole, the turn of this author’s novels bears the same relation to that of the sentimental and romantic cast, that cornfields and cottages and meadows bear to the highly adorned grounds of a show mansion, or the rugged sublimities of a mountain landscape. It is neither so captivating as the one, nor so grand as the other, but it affords to those who frequent it a pleasure nearly allied with the experience of their own social habits; and what is of some importance, the youthful wanderer may return from his promenade to the ordinary business of life, without any chance of having his head turned by the recollection of the scene through which he has been wandering.18\n\nThe pleasure of the Austen text is that of an encounter with familiar people and places, of a recognition of known landmarks and shared cultural assumptions. And one can return from her familiar lanes to the “paths of common life”19 free of any fear of having been permanently marked by the magic of story. The narrator of Waverley, however, is committed to moving beyond the local and provincial although that will be his starting point. And while his reader need not be content with a simple “promenade” around a familiar neighborhood, he or she must be willing to face both the dullness of the journey’s beginnings and the dangers and difficulties that come with wandering far from home. For the fellow travelers will undertake a journey that parallels in an obvious way the one taken by the novel’s hero and one that carries, as Alexander Welsh has shown, important symbolic suggestions. The movement from South to North, from England to Scotland, from the Lowlands to the Highlands, from a “verdant, populous, and highly cultivated country” to “scenes of waste and desolation … of solitary and melancholy” (W, 463) represents the dualisms of law and nature, civilized and primitive, reason and passion, history and romance.20 However, the narrator seems as interested in the process of moving from one to the other as he is in the point of departure and the ultimate destination. The implication of this emphasis becomes clear in the novel’s postscript, where the journey metaphor reappears.\n\nOur journey is now finished, gentle reader; and if your patience has accompanied me through these sheets, the contract is, on your part, strictly fulfilled. Yet, like the driver who has received his full hire, I still linger near you, and make, with becoming diffidence, a trifling additional claim upon your bounty and good nature. You are as free, however, to shut the volume of the one petitioner, as to close your door in the face of the other.\n\nThis should have been a prefatory chapter, but for two reasons: First, that most novel readers, as my own conscience reminds me, are apt to be guilty of the sin of omission respecting that same matter of prefaces; Secondly, that it is a general custom with that class of students, to begin with the last chapter of a work; so that, after all, these remarks, being introduced last in order, have still the best chance to be read in their proper place. (475–76)\n\nThe narrator’s primary concern in this passage is with the way his readers will relate to the text. He acknowledges that the writer/reader affiliation is a contract relationship, that of producer to consumer.21 Readers invest their time and money and in return are transported into picturesque and romantic country. But the author seeks an alliance that extends beyond the simple exchange that formally fulfills the contract, and so he turns in his postscript to a discussion of the “purpose” (476) that energizes the writing of the text. Still, he recognizes that his interest in process (writing) may not be shared by the impatient reader who, seeking amusement and driven by a curiosity to know the end of the tale, the solution to the riddle of the text, is willing to skim or to skip whole passages, indeed to read the last chapter first. The reader is not concerned with the integrity of the text. The “interest of eager curiosity” (117) sends him or her rushing ahead looking toward the end of the journey and ignoring the structure of the carriage as well as the details of the passing landscape.22 Indeed, since the “truly … gentle reader” is precisely one who “throws his mind into the attitude best adapted to humour the deceit which is presented for his entertainment, and grants, for the time of perusal, the premises on which the fable depends,”23 he is unlikely to be motivated on first reading by the “rational pleasure, which admires the author’s art.”24\n\nThis is a fact of reading, however, that the author good-humoredly accepts and cheerfully works within its limitations. His final chapter will not contain the answer to the riddle of the story but will present instead an explanation of the writing of the text that takes the form of a demystification of the journey that has so fascinated the reader. Those parts of the narrative that have seemed so marvelous and romantic, those parts that have generated the most excitement and haste will be shown to be those that have a “foundation in fact” (477) so that the text will exist, finally, as history rather than romance. The experience of the reader of Waverley, in short, will echo that of its young hero, whose journey is an exploration of the enchantments created by his reading and one which ends with his awakening from the illusions of romantic dreams to the realities of history. Because as a youth he is permitted to read “only for the gratification of his amusement,” making himself “master of the style so far as to understand the story” but ignoring “critical distinctions of philology … the difference of idiom, the beauty of filicitous expression, [and] the artificial combinations of syntax” (74), he loses the “opportunity of acquiring habits of firm and assiduous application, of gaining the art of controlling, directing, and concentrating the powers of his mind for earnest investigation…” (74–75). He seeks “instruction only according to the bent of his own mind” (75); “like the epicure who only deigned to take a single morsel from the sunny side of a peach, [he] read no volume a moment after it ceased to excite his curiosity or interest” (76); and gradually he becomes indifferent to the world around him. His “idle reading,” in short, not only renders him “unfit for serious and sober study,” but by encouraging “habits of abstraction and love of solitude” (78) prevents him from acquiring the ability to live in society “with ease and comfort” (79) and leads him to give to reality a “tincture” of “romantic tone and colouring” (82).\n\nWaverley’s adventures, then, suggest those of Don Quixote, but the enabling energy of his story does not derive from “the romance of Cervantes” (82). That text is absorbed by an account of “old-fashioned politics … feelings, prejudices, and parties” (89) of “Sixty Years since” (66). As the narrator repeatedly insists, the “action” of his story derives from “motives” that are the products of the “times” (89). And the time is one marked by genealogical disturbances, confusions of issues of paternity, authority, and legitimacy. As is not the case with those of Don Quixote, Waverley’s habits of reading are the direct result of the collapse of paternal authority. “The occasional attention of [Waverley’s] parents,” the narrator writes, “might have been of service to prevent the dissipation of mind incidental to such a desultory course of reading” (77). But Waverly’s mother is dead, and neither his father nor his uncle assumes the responsibility for his education. This absence of “paternal authority” (85) is the result of a political conflict between Waverley’s father and his uncle, a conflict that itself is implicated in the issues of authority, paternity, and legitimacy that haunt the novel. The historical situation of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion, which provides the context for Waverley’s adventures, is dominated by a quarrel over two forms of authority, one represented by the Stuart claim to the throne based on Charles Edward’s direct descent and hereditary right from the last Stuart king, James II, and the other supported by the Bill of Rights and the Acts of Settlement, which established the supremacy of parliament over the king as well as a Protestant line of succession from the House of Hanover.25 Waverley finds himself in a situation where he must choose between the “hereditary faith of [his uncle] in Highchurch and in the house of Stewart” (67) and the more practical commitment of his father, “an avowed whig, and friend of the Hanover succession” (67).\n\nBut since his “habits” have not “led him to investigate the politics in which he lived” (211), he finds himself unable to cope with his own times and feels himself always “at the disposal of others, without the power of directing his own motions” (283). Consequently, he seeks authority and direction in the “oft repeated tale of narrative old age,” of “family tradition and genealogical history” (79) that dominates his uncle’s discourse until, like Faulkner’s Hightower, “he would exercise for hours that internal sorcery, by which past or imaginary events are presented in action, as it were, to the eye of the muser” (81). This love of the past continues to color his vision even when he enters a “new World” (97) by taking up the “profession of arms” (90) and joining Colonel Gardner’s regiment in Scotland, for he feels out of place in the military. Hence he requests a leave of absence and begins a journey that will be a backward-looking enactment of a series of authoritative models from the past. There is the pedantic Baron of Bradwardine whose character is shaped by “prejudices of ancient birth and Jacobite politics, greatly strengthened by habits of solitary and secluded authority, which … was … indisputable and undisputed” (111) and for whom “rank and ancestry” are the “last words in the mouths of us of unblemished race” (113). Like Waverley’s uncle, the Baron (who acts “in loco parentis” [121] to Waverley) is fascinated with heraldry and the tracing of genealogies, objects of study with no application to other aspects of life and involving no real knowledge of history.26 There is Fergus Mac-Ivor, another model for Waverley, whose “countenance” indicates “something of the habit of peremptory command and decisive authority” (171), who possesses a “patronymic title” (173), is motivated by ideas of “patriarchal power” (216), and dreams of extending his “patriarchal sway” (185). And supporting the claims of these proponents of age, tradition, and hierarchy is the “Young Pretender” who is single-mindedly devoted to the restoration of the Stuart line to the throne of England.\n\nAll of these figures suggest the attitudes of an earlier generation, and all to some extent have outlived their times. Hence they appear now as an anacronistic residue in the new order of things. To Waverley’s ingenuous eyes they and their doomed enterprise possess at first the interest of pure adventure, but, as he later comes to see, their quest is “strange, horrible and unnatural” (331) because as a form of usurption it leads to active rebellion and parricide. Fergus will later appear to the young hero as a “second Lucifer of ambition and wrath” (385), an association that is validated by the narrator’s description of the Highlanders as resting on a hillside “thick as leaves in Valumbrosa” (333).\n\nSet against these figures associated with failed rebellion and worn-out hereditary authority is Colonel Talbot, a man “devoted to the service of his king and country” (360) who is free of Bradwardine’s pedantry and Fergus’s personal ambitions and who suggests lines of authority and bonds of relationship based on principles other than that of direct genealogical descent. His devotion to Waverley is an expression of an indebtedness to Waverley’s uncle “for benefits greater than those which a son owes a father” (346), for Sir Everard withdraws his “claim to the hand of Lady Emily” (71) and persuades her father to allow her to marry the young Talbot. The result is that Sir Everard remains a celebate bachelor and Waverley becomes his heir. And this process of substitution is repeated when Talbot, “induced” by his “friendship for Sir E” (375) leaves his frail and pregnant wife to seek young Waverley in the Scottish highlands. The result of his actions is the death of the “future heir, so long hoped for in vain” (375) and his replacement by Waverley. Even before the death of Waverley’s father Talbot is selected to “take charge of [Waverley’s] interests” (412), and he is the one who secures a pardon for the young man by offering the king the fatherly promise that Waverley “will be a good boy in the future” (443).27\n\nThe relationship between the Waverley and Talbot families suggests a set of social bonds between men and women that substitute for lines of relationship connecting members of the same family from one generation to the next. Within the new system the “path of gratitude and honour” (377) is determined not by “irreprochable lineage” (113) but by obligations and duties based on values that are communal rather than strictly familial. And yet the effect of this order is to restore and maintain a version of the authority associated with the past and with patriarchal power. For it is through the “means” (475) of Colonel Talbot that Bradwardine’s “patrimonial property” (467–68), “the mansion of [his] fathers” (469), is recovered and restored and the “Houses of Waverley-Honour and Bradwardine” are united through the marriage of Waverley and Rose. Everything is “as much as possible restored to the state in which [Bradwardine] had left it when he assumed arms some months before,” with the “strictest attention to maintain the original character” (469) of the estate. But the restored estate is a represented estate in the sense of being an imitation or copy of a now-vanished original and as such appears as an aesthetic rather than historical category. For example, when the large dining parlor has been renewed and restored “as much as possible according to the old arrangement” (473), there is one “addition” made to this “fine old apartment” (473).\n\nIt was a large and spirited painting representing Fergus Mac-Ivor and Waverley in their Highland dress, the scene a wild, rocky, and mountainous pass, down which the clan were descending in the background. It was taken from a spirited sketch, drawn while they were in Edinburgh by a young man of high genius, and had been painted on a full-length scale by an eminent London artist. Raeburn himself, (whose Highland Chiefs do all but walk out of the canvass,) could not have done more justice to the subject; and the ardent, fiery, and impetuous character of the unfortunate Chief of Glennaquoich was finely contrasted with the contemplative, fanciful, and enthusiastic expression of his happier friend. Beside this painting hung the arms which Waverley had borne in the unfortunate civil war. The whole piece was beheld with admiration, and deeper feelings. (473–74)\n\nThis painting, like the “renewed or repaired” (469) estate, is the expression of an ironic but gentle nostalgia, for it gives the appearance of presence to that which can only be imagined.28 Fergus Mac-Ivor, the cunning, self-serving politican, is dead, but he is represented here in a way that not only gives the illusion of presence but portrays him in an idealized and glorified form. And Waverley himself appears once again in a dream world that is restored to view with the intensity, richness, and size of reality. But this is a realm that vanished with the skirmish at Clifton and one that was challenged even at the moment it was lived.\n\nIt was at that instant, that, looking around him, he saw the wild dress and appearance of his Highland associates, heard their whispers in an uncouth and unknown language, looked upon his own dress, so unlike that which he had worn from his infancy, and wished to awake from what seemed at the moment a dream, strange, horrible, and unnatural. (331)\n\nThe relationship of the painting to the experience that it [mis] represents points to a central theme of Waverley and to a crucial aspect of romance as a form. In “An Essay on Romance” Scott argues that Romance and history have a “common origin” in the account of the “father of an isolated family, destined one day to rise into a tribe, and in farther progress of time to expand into a nation,” who narrates to “his descendants the circumstances which detached him from the society of his brethren, and drove him to form a solitary settlement in the wilderness.”29 This original account does not deviate from the facts but when the “tale of the patriarch” (135) is repeated by his descendants, the love of the marvelous, the “vanity of the tribe,” and the “interests of the King and the priest” (135) contaminate the purity of the narrative which is now “exaggerated by prejudices and partialities” and “deeply marked by … idolatry and superstition” (139). “So that Romance, though certainly deriving its first original from the pure font of History, is supplied, during the course of a very few generations, with so many tributes from the Imagination, that at length the very name comes to be used to distinguish works of pure fiction” (153–54). Hence “Tradition … is an alchymy, which converts gold into lead” (177), history into fiction, and, as the years pass, the romancer gradually becomes the “companion and soother only of idle and convivial hours,” and his “art is accounted at best an amusing but useless luxury” (164).\n\nNevertheless the “appetite” for fiction remains “ardent” (178) and the progress of romance continues. For, like the painting of Fergus and Waverley, it excites “admiration and deeper feelings,” but because the past that it represents is contaminated by fiction it is unable to maintain the illusion of authority in the face of the stronger realities of the present. “Men must … eat, in spite both of sentiment and virtu” and so those who have viewed with pleasure the enchanted realm of the painting turn easily back to the more substantial satisfactions of an “excellent” (W, 474) dinner. The painting, then, represents the past, but the past colored by the imagination and robbed of its authority. Indeed the very process of representation seems one in which voice becomes fiction as the original utterance of the patriarch is defiled by substitutions and repetitions. Although the “eminent London artist” seeks to restore, preserve, and celebrate the past, his efforts necessarily involve him in a genetic movement of corruption and contamination.\n\nHowever, the authority that is at once represented and discredited by the painting is restored in a more compelling aspect in the voice of the narrator of Waverley, a “painter of antique or of fashionable manners … of the last generation” (65) and in the form of his relation both to his hero and to the reader. For to write and to read novels is to engage in activities that replicate Waverley’s own misguided adventures. Not only does the narrator present himself as someone who caters to the questionable tastes of those, who, like his young hero, read only for amusement, but he also reveals himself to be an inveterate reader. One has only to note the literary allusions, quotations, and footnotes that burden the text to see that the narrator is as fascinated by the literary tradition that establishes the genealogy and authority of his text as Waverley and the Baron of Bradwardine are by family history. Indeed, the question of narrative authority is the dominant issue of the introductory chapter of Waverley where the narrator seeks to show that he is “profoundly versed in the different branches of his art” (64). However, the “example of [his] predecessors” will dictate neither the “title of [his work]” nor the “name of [his] hero” (63), for to take a name and title from “English history or topography” would suggest “pages of inanity, similar to those which have been so christened for half a century past” (63). “WAVERLEY” the narrator insists is a name “uncontaminated” by tradition, one “bearing” only the meaning which “the reader shall hereafter be pleased to affix to it” (63). And the “second or supplemental title” (63) distinguishes the author’s work from that of his predecessors by indicating that it is “neither a romance of chivalry, nor a tale of modern manners,” and that its “object … is more a description of men than of manners” (64). Names and titles are of course examples of one of the simplest forms of representation and at once mark both individual and generic traits. They are not unique and neutral, for they are subject to the interpretive activity of others. A London newspaper punningly sneers at the “Wavering Honour of W-v-r-l-y H-n-r” (213), and the narrator repeatedly calls attention to his hero’s “wavering and unsettled habit of mind” (98). Moreover, the narrator himself seems burdened by an inherited authority, for the controlling metaphors of the introductory chapter derive from the “language of heraldry” (65). He begins “like a maiden knight with his white shield” (63) but quickly finds it marked with both “bearings” (66) and tincture. His “narrative,” in short, like the painting of Fergus and Waverley, at once asserts and discredits an authoritative model from the past.\n\nThe author was destined, of course, to become himself a dominating authority and the establisher of a tradition. As “the Author of Waverley” (15), he becomes the father of the historical romance and a seminal figure for a generation of British, European, and American novelists. Nevertheless, as Edward Said has noted, novelistic authority is not absolute, since the fathered text is always subject to a comparison with reality, a process that reveals it to be the result of a conceptual rather than an organic relationship.30 When the author of Waverley, that great unknown, at last identitifies himself in the general preface to the Waverley Novels, he “acknowledges the paternity of these novels” (18) and argues that the “disclosure of the Author’s name” restores “to him a sort of parental control over these Works” (3), but he also portrays himself not as Scott the father and author but as Scott the “spoiled child” (20) and reader. As he traces his development as a writer, preserving the “traces” of his “advance toward romantic composition” (11) and explaining the reasons for his curious desire “to remain concealed, in the character of the Author of these Novels” (15), he appears as Waverley himself making it ironically appropriate that all the novels bear the name of that first childish hero. He begins with a description of the “concealed pleasure” (6) of tale-telling with boyhood chums and moves on to an account of a youthful illness that throws him “back on the kingdom of fiction, as it were by a species of fatality” (6).\n\nI was plunged into this great ocean of reading without compass or pilot; and unless when some one had the charity to play at chess with me, I was allowed to do nothing save read, from morning to night. I was, in kindness and pity, which was perhaps erroneous, however natural, permitted to select my subjects of study at my own pleasure, upon the same principle that the humours of children are indulged to keep them out of mischief. As my taste and appetite were gratified in nothing else, I indemnified myself by becoming a glutton of books.…\n\nThe vague and wild use which I made of this advantage I cannot describe better than by referring my reader to the desultory studies of Waverley in a similar situation; the passages concerning whose course of reading were imitated from recollections of my own.… (6–7)\n\nIt is the consumption of these texts that marks the first step in Scott’s “advance toward romantic composition” (11) and the subsequent steps in his journey are equally bookish. He mentions in particular a desire to imitate The Castle of Otranto and a curious inclination to complete Strutt’s unfinished romance, Queen Ho Hall. In short the “unravelling” (14) of the mystery of “the Author of these Novels” takes the form of an account of Scott’s reading habits. But these are habits that associate him with his hero and imply a parallel between the success story recorded in the preface and the famous account of Waverley’s awakening contained in the novel. “He felt himself entitled to say firmly, though perhaps with a sigh, that the romance of his life was ended, and that its real history had now commenced” (401). At issue here is a distinction between things as they are and things as they appear when colored by an “intense curiosity and exalted imagination” (281), between real life and adventure. But the true “Adventurer” (335) in Waverley is a historical character, the romantic, Byronic, Bonnie Prince Charles, transformed by Jacobite story and legend into a figure of romance. This “royal Adventurer” (296), this “Italian knight-errant” (354) is demythologized by the narrative which points to the Quixotic and self-interested aspects of his enterprise. Waverley’s reaction to the pretender and his legend is that of a reader to a narrative of adventure, and Charles takes advantage of his simplicity as such fictions do of naive and youthful readers. Hence the history that Waverley reluctantly awakes to when he becomes disenchanted in the service of Charles is simply everyday life.\n\nOf course the “real” history of Waverley’s life is the narrative of adventure that the reader responds to as Waverley does to Charles and the Highlands, and the author’s assurances in the postscript that the romantic parts of the narrative are precisely those that have a foundation in fact do not change the nature of the first-reading response. As Scott is well aware, his emphasis on the historical is an attempt to keep the “universal charm of Narrative” in control so that it does not completely “generate an indisposition to real history and useful literature.”31\n\nIndeed Waverley is haunted by the charm of story and by the ghost of a naive reader, a spectre that troubles the “conscience” (475) of the writer. For while at times he seems secure in his role as the father of these novels, “profoundly versed in the different branches of his art” (64) capable of tyrannizing over his reader (64, 200) by the exercise of his “arbitrary power” (199), at others he represents himself as a “spoiled child,” an “idle truant boy” (465) engaged merely in a “game of bo-peep” (17) with the public. It is his reader, in short, who reminds him that reading is the origin of writing, the child the father of the man, and forces him into a confessional mode. Scott is, he admits, attracted to the poet Gray’s notion that it is “no bad emblem of Paradise to lie all day on a couch and read new novels,”32 but he is deeply troubled by the figure of an idling reader, indolently giving himself up to the charm of narrative and pleasures of curiosity and allowing himself to be played by the story.\n\nThis is a problem that Scott (anticipating some recent attempts) at times tries to solve by developing a notion of a “second reading”33 performed by a competent reader. Naive reading he associates with the “young and indolent,” with the “joys of infancy” that lose their charm for our “riper judgement” and with works that “require little attention in the perusal.”34 The more mature reader demands “a plan of narrative, happily complicated and ingeniously resolved” which “continues to please after many readings; for, although the interest of eager curiosity is no more, it is supplied by the rational pleasure, which admires the author’s art, and traces a thousand minute passages, which render the catastrophe probable, yet escape notice in the eagerness of a first perusal.”35 Nevertheless one needs to note that the desire that motivates a second reading is still a form of curiosity even though it may be legitimate and reasonable, and this reader may be thought of as a “child to whom a watch is shown” who after becoming “satiated with looking at the outside,” will “acquire a new interest in the object when it is opened, and the internal machinery displayed” (19).\n\nThis ambivalence regarding the acts of writing and reading that is inscribed in Scott’s theory and practice is less the expression of his biography or psychology than it is the manifestation of a certain thematics of form that receives its clearest and most influential expression in his writings. And it is an ambivalence that persists in the English novel through the nineteenth and into the twentieth centuries. As George Levine observes, “Waverley’s formula—its resolved and unresolved tensions—is the formula upon which almost every major English writer of the nineteenth century plays variations.”36 But the formula is displaced as novelists become more concerned with maintaining the artistic and social dignity of their fiction and the problems of reading and story are absorbed and completely thematized. From Austen through Dickens, George Eliot, and Conrad they exist primarily in the form of characters whose devotion to one sort of dream or another results in their taking romantic views of experience that lead them away from the duties of ordinary life but whose mistakes provide the mirage that illuminates the nature of the real. The Quixotic preoccupations of such characters as Emma, Dorothea, Pip, and Lord Jim suggestively echo the problems of writers and readers at the same time that they measure the distance that separates imagination from perception.\n\nIn the nineteenth-century American novel, however, the twin problems of reading and writing are not so easily displaced. As Geoffrey Hartman has noticed, the psychological drama of reading and an “explicit reader enters certain American authors … in the fictional guise of a narrator who has barely escaped a visionary merger, or else as a too palpable authorial presence.”37 Hawthorne and Melville, in particular, feel the necessity to examine directly the formal and personal problems of story telling that they inherit from Scott. Neither writer, of course, is in any sense an uninhibited story teller.38 Hawthorne’s preoccupation with the themes of sin and guilt as well as his concern with social reform is evidence enough of a serious side; and Melville’s concern with truth telling burdens his fiction in obvious ways. Nevertheless both of these writers face the contradictions between such serious intentions and the nature of story in such a way as to suggest a different, more oblique reading of Scott than that which resulted in the realistic fiction of Victorian England.\n\nWashington Irving, for example, finds in Scott an ironic uncertainty that strongly suggests the self-questionings of Hawthorne and Melville.\n\nWhenever Scott touched, in this way, upon local antiquities, and in all his familiar conversations about local traditions and superstitions, there was always a sly and quiet humour running at the bottom of his discourse, and playing about his countenance, as if he sported with the subject. It seemed to me as if he distrusted his own enthusiasm and was disposed to droll upon his own humours and peculiarities, yet at the same time a poetic gleam in his eye, would shew that he really took a strong interest and relish in the theme.39\n\nIrving’s analysis, focusing as it does on Scott’s self-reading, emphasizes what George Levine has called Scott’s “peculiar, almost modern, sort of self consciousness,”40 but it also insists on his commitment to a kind of naiveté that belongs to poetic and imaginative vision. And this unresolved tension, which Irving sees between the poetic gleam in Scott’s eye and the sly and ironic play in his discourse and countenance, between oblique and ingenuous modes of experiencing, finds its formal expression in the eccentricities of the American novel, for it has the effect of bringing to the surface a set of problems normally hidden by the conventions that govern the relationship between writer and reader.\n\nMissing in the works of Hawthorne and Melville is the naturalness of a movement toward resolution and closure as well as the happy conventional relation between a revered author and honored reader that one associates with the great eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English novel. Even Sterne, who seriously questions the conventions that govern reader/writer relations, is willing to respect the “reader’s understanding … to halve this matter amicably, and leave him something to imagine, in his turn, as well as yourself.”41 Such easy solutions seem unavailable to Hawthorne and Melville perhaps because their struggle to create a new, original literature forces them to a deeper, more subversive questioning of inherited conventions and leads them to focus with a special sense of urgency on Scott’s image of the reader as a sort of ghostly double who may either validate or subvert the work of writing. Both American writers begin with a conventional conception of a certain ideal reader, but they soon develop a troubled sense of the distance that separates that ideal from their actual audiences and the work of reading and writing. The result is a tortured re-examination of the now highly suspect relations between author and reader.\n\nThis investigation generates in each case not only a particular narrative strategy but an enabling theme as well. The theme of reading appears obsessively in the works of Hawthorne and Melville. Hawthorne’s starting point as a writer is most often an “Old Time Legend,” some object or scrap of gossip from the past, pregnant with an undisclosed meaning that he sets out to uncover for his reader. The most explicit treatment of this theme, of course, appears in his account of his discovery of the source of The Scarlet Letter. The story he tells us derives from his reading of a faded scarlet A, which represented itself as “most worthy of interpretation,” and “several foolscap sheets, containing many particulars respecting the life and conversation of one Hester Prynne” (SL, 32). In both cases Hawthorne’s reading is the last of a series of interpretations. As Charles Feidelson notes in his seminal discussion of this episode, everyone in the novel reenacts the scene in which Hawthorne attempts to read the meaning of the letter,42 and the letter is interpreted in a variety of ways by Hester and her contemporaries as well as by Hawthorne and the reader. Moreover, Hester herself is the “text of the discourse[s]” (85) not only of Puritan clergymen but also of the “aged persons, alive in the time of Mr. Surveyor Pue … from whose oral testimony he had made up the narrative,” and his narrative, in turn, forms the basis of The Scarlet Letter. Hawthorne seeks to uncover the “dark meaning” (31) in the faded scarlet A as well as the “traces of Mr. Pue’s mental part, and the internal operations of his head” contained in the “half a dozen sheets of foolscap” (33). And as Hawthorne is Pue’s commentator, so the reader is his, seeking in Hawthorne’s text the elusive meaning of the mysterious A as well as the features of its current interpreter. But no matter how interpretations proliferate something will always remain hidden, for the wonderful A “gives evidence of a now forgotten art, not to be rediscovered even by the process of picking out the threads” (31).\n\nIt is this “forgotten art” that haunts Hawthorne’s career as a writer. The Marble Faun and the unfinished romances are a record of his discovery that both creative and interpretive acts are finally nonproductive. The threads of the fabric of The Marble Faun are “Fragmentary Sentences,” signs of a meaning scattered, dispersed, and lost forever. Because the novelist is unable to begin with an unequivocal core of meaning but must be content with something that already is an interpretation, the act of writing becomes a task “resembling, in its perplexity, that of gathering up and piecing together the fragments of a letter, which has been torn and scattered to the winds” (MF, 92–93). And the text that the writer produces demands not the gentle and sympathetic reader who accepts the work “at its worth, without tearing the web apart, with the idle purpose of discovering how its threads have been knit together” (455), but rather a questioning, probing reader who must violate that which he seeks to understand. Both writer and reader become like Hilda little more than disillusioned copyists.\n\nFor Melville even more than Hawthorne the writer is at first a reader. His creative powers depend on the scope of his reading, “spontaneous creative thought” being a process whereby “all existing great works are federated in the fancy; and so regarded as a miscellaneous and Pantheistic whole” (P, 284). The text of Moby-Dick, for example, is woven more from the threads of the texts that fill Ishmael’s library than it is from the lines and ropes of the whaling world. Indeed, Ishmael’s relation to that world is that of a reader to a text, and he tries to organize and arrange it as he has previously done his library by establishing a bibliographical system. Reading, however, is no easy or passive activity. In “Hawthorne and His Mosses” Melville distinguishes between that reader who sees Shakespeare as a “mere man of Richard-the-Third humps, and Macbeth daggers,” who responds to the “popularizing noise and show of broad farce, and blood-besmeared tragedy,” and the more discriminating reader who is “content with the still, rich utterances of a great intellect in repose” (HHM, 541, 542). In the place of “blind, unbridled” (542) reading, Melville proposes a deep, careful one which is capable of discerning those truths that the writer “craftly says” or “insinuates” (541) in his texts. As Ishmael demonstrates when he tells “The Town-Ho’s Story” by “interweaving in its proper place the darker thread [the secret part of the tale] with the story as publicly narrated on the ship” (M-D, 208), story telling is the process of conveying a dark truth that will only be available to the reader whose response is in the form of a deep and probing examination.\n\nMelville soon finds, however, that both writer and reader are themselves woven into the fabric of the story. Pierre and The Confidence Man are records of his discovery of the extent to which writer and reader are entangled in the web of fictions that surround them. In Pierre he attempts to distinguish between the “countless tribes of common novels” that “laboriously spin vails of mystery, only to complacently clear them up at last”; and those “profounder emanations of the human mind” that never “unravel their own intricacies, and have no proper endings” (141); but he then goes on to demonstrate the way in which the “infinite entanglements of all social things, which forbid that one thread should fly the general fabric, on some new line of duty, without tearing itself and tearing others,” (191) make it impossible either for a writer to produce an original text or for a reader to respond to it in any but a mystified way. “Like knavish cards, the leaves of all great books are covertly packed,” and any new author but packs “one set the more” (329). As The Confidence Man makes clear, all stories are at least twice told and are designed, primarily, to divert and charm. Here the writer is portrayed as the confidence man, a contradictorily derivative but original character who has no fixed identity, and readers—both naive and suspicious—are represented by his many victims. Writing is a sham and reading the activity of fools.\n\nSimilar doubts trouble even a novelist as confident in his craft as Henry James. A character in his novels will attempt to read the secret intentions of lives, the hidden subjectivities of others only to discover that the act of reading itself violently changes those lives and creates the results of the reading. And James himself will reenact that drama in the prefaces to the New York edition of his works as he attempts to comprehend the hidden elements and motives of the characters that he has created and to communicate those qualities to a reader who is primarily interested in being entertained. For James the acts of reading and writing appear to be mutually dependent but incompatible activities. The object of the novel is to represent life but the effect is to entertain, and the effect seem to contaminate the object.\n\nThe unpublished fragments of Hawthorne’s last years and Melville’s long period of silence following the publication of The Confidence Man are indications of the extent to which both writers were overwhelmed by the exhaustion of the possibilities of writing and dismayed by their realization that their relation to their readers is based on deception and bad faith. And in a quite different way the work of rereading that produces the prefaces for the New York edition underscores James’s preoccupations with these same problems. However through their willingness fully to investigate the nature of story and the problems of reading these writers suggest the possibility of a fiction where the real is absorbed by the mirage, the “moral” by the “fable,” history by romance. One thinks here of Faulkner’s preoccupation with the “rag-tag and bob ends of old tales and talking” (AA, 303) and John Barth’s undisguised fascination with the “element of story—just sheer extraordinary marvelous story,” that is to say “yarns—elaborate lies.” “Scheherazade’s my avant-gardiste,” he says after commenting that the “nouveau roman isn’t … my cup of tea.”43\n\nThis emphasis does not, however, mark an unexamined return to the simplicity of an ingenuous manner of reading and writing. No one is likely to accuse John Barth of practicing a naive and innocent art that appeals primarily to readers of “restricted competence.”44 He is as aware as any student of la nouvelle critique of the problematic nature of such categories of the classic text as selfhood, origin, and end. A sense of the fictive status of these concepts lies behind his impulse to “imagine alternatives to the world,” to “re-invent philosophy and the rest—make up your own whole history of the world,”45 His books, he says, are “novels which imitate the form of the Novel by an author who imitates the role of Author,” and no one is more aware of the subversive effects of imitation than he.\n\nIf this sort of thing sounds unpleasantly decadent, nevertheless it’s about where the genre begins, with Quixote imitating Amadis of Gaul, Cervantes pretending to be the Cid Hamete Benengeli (and Alonso Quijano pretending to be Don Quixote), or Fielding parodying Richardson. “History repeats itself as farce”—meaning, of course, in the form or mode of farce, not that history is farcical.… The first attempts … to imitate actions more or less directly, and its conventional devices—cause and effect, linear anecdote characterization, authorial selection, arrangement, and interpretation—can be and have long since been objected to as obsolete notions, or metaphors for obsolete notions: Robbe-Grillet’s essays For a New Novel come to mind. There are replies to these objections, not to the point here, but one can see that in any case they’re obviated by imitations of novels which attempt to represent not life directly but a representation of life. In fact such works are no more removed from life than Richardson’s or Goethe’s epistolary novels are: both imitate “real” documents, and the subject of both, ultimately, is life, not documents. A novel is as much a piece of the real world as a letter, and the letters in The Sorrows of Young Werther are, after all, fictitious.46\n\nFor Barth the generic formal situation of the novel is to duplicate or repeat not life itself but an imitation of life. And as an order of duplication it offers a realm of counterfeit imitation, one that is the product of a desire rather than the expression of a natural arrangement. Indeed, as he suggests, the art of story-telling originates from an impulse that seems both impractical and unnatural, a fact that may explain why traditionally it has been regarded suspiciously. The words “once upon a time” can at once comfort and unsettle, for while they conserve, transmit, and confirm a past, a history, an entire system of values, they also initiate a process that breaks from the past by repeating it in a farcical mode thereby expressing a dissatisfaction with its expectations and metaphors. For Barth and his characters this contradictory quality is the aspect of story that most fascinates. Consider, for example, the enthusiasm of Harvey Russeck in The Sot-Weed Factor.\n\n“No pleasure pleasures me as doth a well-spun tale, be’t sad or merry, shallow or deep! If the subject’s privy business, or unpleasant, who cares a fib? The road to Heaven’s beset with thistles, and methinks there’s many a cow-pat on’t as well. And what matter if your folk are drawn from life? ’Tis not likely I’ll ha’met ’em, or know ’em from your telling if e’er I should! Call ’em what names ye will: in a tale they’re less than themselves, and more. Besides which, if ye have the art to make ’em live—’sheart!—thou’rt nowise liable for what the rascals do, no more than God Almighty for the lot of us. As for length, fie on’t!” He raised his horny finger. “A bad tale’s long though it want but a single eyeblink for the telling, and a good tale short though it takes from St. Swithin’s to Michaelmas to have done with’t. Ha! And the plot is tangled, d’ye say? Is’t more knotful or bewildered than the skein of life itself, that a good tale tangles the better to unsnarl? Nay, out with your story, now, and yours as well, sir, and shame on the both o’ ye thou’rt not commenced already! Spin and tangle till the Dog-star set i’ the Bay—nor fear I’ll count ye idle gossips: a tale well wrought is the gossip o’ the gods, that see the heart and hidden point o’ life on earth; the seamless web o’ the world; the Warp and Woof … I’Christ, I do love a story, sirs! Tell away!”47\n\nLike Barth himself, who in writing The Sot-Weed Factor set out to “make up a plot fancier than Tom Jones,”48 Harvey delights in the spinning and tangling of tale-telling. Of primary importance is not a truth or a moral but an uninhibited joy in the performance of the virtuoso who “with the aid of very special gifts” and with the knowledge that all possibilities are exhausted manages to speak “eloquently to our still human hearts and conditions.”49 Harvey is, we recall, a character in a novel which imitates the eighteenth-century novel, the creation of an author who imitates Fielding and other authors, and as he expresses his enthusiasm, he dismisses as irrelevant many of the questions traditionally raised about the art of fiction. The problem of subject matter, the questions of source, of ethical and moral responsibilities, of productive, committed actions: all these are quickly but not naively dismissed. Indeed, Harvey’s response suggests that the naive reading associated with the novel from its beginnings may not be innocent at all since the form itself may be seen as socially and ontologically subversive. The special delight that novel readers experience when they give themselves to the magic of story may not represent a passive unquestioning acceptance of the codes and conventions of their society. The very act of turning away from what is to feign belief in what is not violates the natural attitude and puts it into question. The story that so delights Harvey Russecks reveals “an itch for all we lose as proper citizens—something in us pines for Chaos, for the black and lawless Pit” (628).\n\nFor Barth a good story is at once evidence that “human work can be magnificent” (305) and a revelation of that “black cosmos whence we sprung and through which we fall.” (364) His “favorite teller” is Scheherazade because, among other reasons, her “situation” is “apocalyptic.” Faced with death, she is forced night after night to satisfy an “old cynic” whose “epical despair” is bringing ruin to his kingdom, and the “pleasure” generated by her tales “fertilizes as well as spares her, and … finally rewards her.” And she, “yarning tirelessly through the dark hours to save her neck,” at the same time cures the king’s despair and saves the kingdom as well as herself. As Barth never tires of suggesting, this scene of reading and writing figures the “estate of the fictioner in general”50 and suggests a point of view that manages to dignify both naive and enlightened attitudes.\n\nWe tell stories and listen to them because we live stories and live in them. Narrative equals language equals life: To cease to narrate, as the capital example of Scheherazade reminds us, is to die—literally for her, figuratively for the rest of us. One might add that if this is true, then not only is all fiction fiction about fiction, but all fiction about fiction is in fact fiction about life. Some of us understood that all along.51"
