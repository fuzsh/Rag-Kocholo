        "text": "Anna Paquin was cast in HBO's True Blood a few months before Stephen Moyer in 2007, meaning the English actor needed to vibe with the New Zealand-born Oscar winner before he got the gig.\n\n\"We met screen-testing for the show,\" Moyer recalled on Watch What Happens Live in 2020. \"We were both single at the time, and there was just this kind of spark.\"\n\nThree months later, they reunited to shoot the pilot—Paquin by then a blonde for the role of telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse and his sandy hair dyed dark brown to play brooding vampire Bill Compton—and Moyer was down for the count.\n\n\"By day three or four—oh, this is going to sound so syrupy—but I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her,\" he said. \"It was within seconds, really, and it just became a thing.\"\n\nTechnically Paquin and Moyer's first kiss was an onscreen moment for Sookie and Bill, but the actors had become very close off-camera while staying at the same hotel as the only out-of-towners in L.A. to shoot the first season.\n\nThey'd have breakfast together every morning \"and then we'd have supper because, you know, we were there,\" Moyer said on The Kelly Clarkson Show in February 2024. \"It was just like this, I don't know, this magnetism.\"\n\n\"And if you watch the show, though, those first few episodes when we're coming together,\" he added, \"it's kind of like off the charts.\"\n\nPaquin acknowleged that the \"fascination and attraction\" between Bill and Sookie \"made it kind of hard to pinpoint where it ceased to be fiction, because that's how we've always been around each other,\" she told The Telegraph in September 2009. \"But there was no massive revelation moment of, 'Wow I fancy you.'\"\n\nMoyer, by then her fiancé, was \"lovely,\" she continued. \"He’s very funny. I’m definitely not on any level attracted to people who don’t have a good sense of humor. That’s how you get through the ups and the downs.\"\n\nPaquin likened being bitten by a vampire to the dozen piercings she already had, while Moyer approached the dynamics rather philosophically.\n\n\"If we go from a base level, vampires create a hole in the neck where there wasn't one before,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"It's a de-virginization...And there's something sharp, the fang, which is probing and penetrating and moving into it. So that's pretty sexy. I think that makes vampires attractive.\"\n\nEven though Paquin wouldn't call herself a \"jewelry girl,\" Moyer had proposed with this diamond and antiqued platinum ring by the time they were hanging out with True Blood costars Carrie Preston and Rutina Wesley in West Hollywood on Aug. 24, 2009.\n\n\"We pretty much consider ourselves married now, even though we aren't yet,\" Moyer told Rolling Stone that summer. \"Doesn't it make you a little sick in your mouth?\"\n\nPaquin made a similar crack 14 years later on TODAY, referring to their love story. \"People tend to find it either charming,\" she said, \"or not fair.\"\n\nOf not being in the throes of wedding planning, Paquin told The Telegraph, \"It's more about being family than becoming Bridezilla overnight and wearing some big meringue wedding dress. That would scare the s--t out of me. I wasn't the girl who spent hours dreaming of my wedding.\"\n\nStill, though they may have already felt married, they made it official on Aug. 21, 2010, at a private home in Malibu.\n\nThe newlyish-weds sported their wedding bands on a night out that October.\n\nPaquin was happily just starting to show when she and Moyer attended the fifth season premiere of True Blood in May 2012.\n\n\"I feel fantastic,\" she told reporters on the red carpet, while Moyer said it's \"always amazing\" to be an expectant dad.\n\n\"I love my kids so much,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter, \"and that fact that Anna is pregnant just adds more crazy to the bundle of fun.\"\n\nPaquin and Moyer quietly welcomed son Charlie and daughter Poppy on Sept. 12, 2012.\n\nThe couple didn't make a public to-do about the births and Moyer first shared the names with E! News nine months later.\n\nAround that time, the actor also shared that the twins had arrived \"much earlier\" than expected, telling People, \"They were so fragile in the beginning. We are just trying to protect them.\"\n\nMoreover, they were keeping the babies out of the spotlight because \"they didn't choose to be actors—not yet!\" he quipped. \"Who knows what they'll be? It's just a question of wanting to keep that private for them so they can choose.\"\n\nMoyer directed several episodes of True Blood and his \"respectful prop department\" tweaked his chair to read \"Mr. Paquin.\"\n\nBut secure of his place in both the Bon Temps universe and the real world, he took it in stride.\n\n\"I try to keep the set as light and as funny and as warm and as creative as it can possibly be,\" he said on Good Morning America in 2014. And when her husband directed her in a sex scene with Joe Manganiello's Alcide, the actress shrugged it off as \"just choreography, who's going to put what where, blah blah blah.\"\n\nIt was all \"really quite technical,\" she added, \"and we're both grown-ups.\"\n\n(But suffice it to say, when asked years later when the twins might be able to watch True Blood, Moyer's answer was, \"Never, if it's anything to do with us.\")\n\nMoyer directed Paquin in the drama A Bit of Light, which came out April 5, 2024—and there were countless upsides to getting to go to work together every day.\n\n\"Perks are easy,\" he told Us Weekly. \"We know each other inside out. We've worked together for many, many years as actors and as producers.\"\n\nAnd while Paquin left telepathy behind when True Blood ended, she can still read her husband's mind.\n\nThere are moments on set \"where I'll look across at her and she'll just go, 'I'll go in again,'\" Moyer said. \"She just knows that there's something that she wants to recalibrate. And so I have the luxury of knowing that I can leave her to it...I can go in and say one word and she'll just go, 'Stop. Got it.'\"\n\nIt may sound \"absurd to say this,\" Moyer said, but there were simply no downsides to working with his wife, not least because they get to bring the whole family.\n\nUsually \"the kids have always gone with Anna and the dogs have always gone with me\" when they had to travel for projects, he explained, but \"when we're working together as a couple, the kids come with us. It's great they have both of us and they're not in some distant sort of Australian village or Toronto snow scape or Vancouver rainstorm or whatever. They've got both of us there.\"\n\nWhile Moyer and Paquin have talked about parenthood, the couple have historically been very private with regard to all four kids in their life and, while there have been some rare outings to public events, they don't post pics of their children on social media.\n\nThey do love to post about each other though, both lovey-dovey-style and to champion their spouse's work.\n\n\"Everyone chooses what works for their family,\" Paquin said on TODAY. \"There are aspects of one's private life that are fun and cute and not too revealing.\"\n\nCase in point..."
