        "text": "A new report has spilled the beans on former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick's love life, suggesting he's dating ex-competitive cheerleader Jordon Hudson, 24.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the 72-year-old gridiron legend, who clinched six Super Bowl victories with Tom Brady, has now taken on a new romance whilst also embracing a new role as a presenter for ESPN's \"Monday Night Footb a ll with Peyton and Eli.\"\n\nBelichick reportedly crossed paths with Hudson three years back during a flight from Boston to Florida, where they hit it off over her philosophy school work, according to a former cheerleading teammate who spoke to TMZ. What started as a friendship blossomed into romance in 2023, with the couple being spotted together in New Orleans and Belichick even jetting off to Croatia this spring to support her at a cheerleading event.\n\nHudson was recently seen at Belichick's Hall of Fame induction, and word of their relationship is said to be well-known among those in the Patriots' orbit. The age gap between them became fodder for humour during Netflix's \"The Roast of Tom Brady.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Kansas City Chiefs star makes Travis Kelce retirement pact ahead of NFL season\n\nREAD MORE: Aaron Rodgers' absence from New York Jets minicamp explained as coach addresses 'concern'\n\nFormer Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski quipped about Belichick's interest in Foxborough High School. \"But coach, you used to talk about Foxborough High School when we sucked, but now I know why you were so obsessed with Foxborough High School,\" Gronkowski joked. \"You were scouting... your new girlfriend. You're 73 years old, you should be trying to bang someone your own age.\"\n\nBefore his discreet romance with Hudson, Belichick was involved in two significant long-term relationships. The coach, who holds dual Croatian-American citizenship, was married to his ex-wife Debby Clark from 1997 until 2006, and together they had three children.\n\nHis sons, Stephen and Brian, have followed in their father's footsteps, both securing assistant coaching roles with the Patriots.\n\nBelichick's most recent love interest was Linda Holiday, whom he dated from 2007 until their split in 2023; the couple never tied the knot. Despite not being married, Holiday played a significant role in Belichick's professional sphere, managing the Bill Belichick Foundation.\n\nPEOPLE magazine reported that the relationship had \"run its course.\" The news of Holiday and Belichick's separation came out in 2023, although TMZ revealed that they had quietly parted ways the previous year. This allowed Belichick time to cultivate his connection with Hudson.\n\nBoth Belichick and Holiday declined to comment on the matter when approached by TMZ. Alongside his colourful personal life, Belichick also made headlines for his job hunt during the offseason, which ultimately led nowhere. The Tennessee-born coach, after spending 22 seasons with the Patriots, left the team following a series of losing seasons and an alleged falling out with team owner Robert Kraft.\n\nDespite his determination to continue his head coaching career, which spans over three decades, ESPN reported that Belichick conducted several interviews and was under the impression that the job was his. However, the Falcons ultimately chose to hire Raheem Morris, the defensive coordinator from Los Angeles Rams."
