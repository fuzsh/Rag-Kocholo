        "text": "Meet Bill Gates' girlfriend, Paula Hurd.\n\nFollowing his divorce from Melinda French Gates in August 2021, the Microsoft co-founder began dating Hurd.\n\nThe couple's relationship was confirmed in February 2023, however, Gates and Hurd had been spotted together at several sporting events months prior, including the Laver Cup in September 2022 and the Australian Open in January 2023.\n\nBefore their relationship went public, Gates told the BBC that he planned to find love again after his divorce. \"Sure, I'm not a robot,\" he said.\n\nHurd and Gates eventually made their red carpet debut in April 2024 at the Breakthrough Prize Ceremony.\n\nRead ahead for everything to know about Gates' girlfriend.\n\nShe's the widow of former Oracle CEO Mark Hurd\n\nHurd was married to Mark Hurd, the CEO of software company Oracle and the onetime boss of Hewlett-Packard, for nearly 30 years, until his death in October 2019.\n\nShe studied business in college\n\nShe graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1984, per her bio on Baylor University's website.\n\nShe used to work in the tech industry\n\nAfter college, Hurd embarked on a decades-long career in sales and alliance management at the software company NCR (National Cash Register). The corporation is a top enterprise provider of software, hardware and services for banks and retailers.\n\nNow, Paula works as a developer and organizer of a wide range of \"memorable\" event experiences for personal, corporate and charitable occasions, according to her LinkedIn bio.\n\nShe's a philanthropist\n\nHurd and her late husband contributed to various causes and led numerous fundraising campaigns over the years. As a longtime donor to her late husband's alma mater, Baylor University, she helped the school's Give Light Campaign reach its $1 billion mark with a generous $7 million donation in 2021. The school opened a welcome center named for the couple in September 2023.\n\n“Our family is absolutely thrilled with the Hurd Welcome Center,” Hurd said in a Baylor University press release. “When we made this gift, Mark had a vision for how a welcome experience could transform this corner of campus, and the outcome has by far exceeded our expectations and dreams. I know he would be proud.\"\n\nThe fundraising campaign was described on Baylor's website as one seeking \"to further activities that provide an 'unambiguously Christian education environment;' create transformational undergraduate education experiences; boost the impact and visibility of Baylor's research and scholarship; and foster nationally recognized arts and athletics programs, according to Baylor's foundational pillars.\"\n\nShe has two daughters\n\nHurd is a mom to two children, daughters Kathryn and Kelly, whom she shares with her late husband.\n\nNews of her relationship with Gates was confirmed in February 2023\n\nAlthough the couple had been seen alongside each other in public since September 2022 (and at the same sporting event in October 2021), it wasn't until February 2023 that a source close to the couple confirmed the status of their relationship.\n\nAt the time, the insider said the pair's relationship was \"widely known.\" Five months later, engagement rumors surfaced after Hurd was photographed wearing a piece of jewelry on her ring finger while out with Gates in New York City.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the Microsoft co-founder tells PEOPLE that the ring has belonged to Hurd for quite some time and does not symbolize an engagement.\n\n“Our office can confirm that the ring Mrs. Hurd was seen wearing has belonged to her for decades,” the spokesperson said. (Hurd has previously been seen wearing a ring with Gates.)\n\nShe and Gates attended Jeff Bezos' engagement party\n\nIn August 2023, Gates and Hurd attended Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's engagement party. The intimate soiree took place on the Amazon founder's $500 million yacht, which was anchored off the coast of Italy.\n\nShe and Gates attended a pre-wedding celebration for Anant Ambani\n\nHurd and Gates attended a pre-wedding celebration in early March 2024 for Anant Ambani, the son of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani. The lavish, three-day event kicked off with a performance by Rihanna.\n\nShe and Gates made their red carpet debut in April 2024\n\nThe couple walked the red carpet together for the first time at the 10th annual Breakthrough Prize Ceremony in Los Angeles. Hurd dazzled in a black gown adorned with feathers, while Gates looked handsome in a classic black tuxedo.\n\nShe and Gates attended the 2024 Paris Olympics"
