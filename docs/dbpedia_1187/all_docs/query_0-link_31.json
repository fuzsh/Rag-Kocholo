        "text": "John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nIn his first offseason free of head coaching duties in more than 20 years, NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick has found a new romantic interest.\n\nPer TMZ, the former New England Patriots coach is dating 24-year-old former competitive cheerleader Jordon Hudson. TMZ reported that the two have been together \"for a while now\" and became romantic soon after Belichick and longtime girlfriend Linda Holliday split.\n\nTMZ noted that Belichick and Hudson met on a flight from Boston to Florida in 2021 while discussing a philosophy project Hudson was working on in college. The two exchanged contacts and kept in touch before beginning a romantic relationship in 2022. TMZ also reported that Hudson was in attendance at Patriots games over the course of the 2022 and 2023 seasons.\n\nNow, things between Belichick and Hudson have become more public, as the former coach was seen at one of her cheerleading competitions, according to TMZ. Hudson also joined Belichick for Tom Brady's Patriots Hall of Fame induction earlier this week, posting a picture of the event on social media.\n\nBelichick, who did not land with another team after his departure from the Patriots, was previously married to Debby Clarke from 1977 to 2006 and the two have three children together.\n\nWhether Belichick will be back on the sidelines as a coach in the future is unclear, but he will still be involved in football in the upcoming season as he joins ESPN's Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli along with other off-the-field endeavors."
