        "text": "She’s ready to rah rah sis boom bah.\n\nBill Belichick’s 23-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, was spotted back at cheerleading practice in Boston on Thursday, shortly after her romantic date night with the former New England Patriots coach.\n\nThe fit brunette was seen in photos obtained by TMZ Friday doing a series of stunts with other athletes at East Celebrity Elite Hingham.\n\nHudson – who was photographed wearing a turquoise sports bra, tight white shorts and sneakers – was in the flyer position and lifted up into the sky for the routine.\n\nShe has a lot of experience in the sport, as she previously competed with Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts and even won a national championship title with the squad in 2021.\n\nIt’s unclear if Hudson has plans to pursue a professional cheerleading career in the NFL and try out for the Patriots’ cheer squad.\n\nHowever, the former Miss Maine USA contestant has a good networking contact in her beau, Belichick, whom she has reportedly been dating since at least 2022.\n\nOne of Hudson’s former teammates previously claimed to TMZ that the pageant queen began dating the NFL coach shortly after he quietly split from his girlfriend of 10 years, Linda Holliday.\n\nHudson and Belichick, 72, reportedly met back in 2021, though, when they happened to be on a flight together from Boston to Florida.\n\nThe sports analyst even signed the then-college student’s textbook at the time, writing, “Jordon, Thanks for giving me a course in logic! Safe travels!”\n\nIt appears the pair stayed in touch, and once their romance heated up, Belichick even snuck out of Hudson’s house shirtless following a rendezvous last year.\n\nSince their relationship has become public, they have unabashedly stepped out together.\n\nOn Wednesday, the May-December couple flaunted some PDA while out to dinner with pals at the exclusive club The Boarding House in Nantucket, Mass."
