        "text": "Navigating life in the spotlight is no laughing matter.\n\nIn fact, it's something Ali Wong is still figuring out, especially after the success of her hit show Beef. Fame has also brought a whole new level of attention to the comedian's private world, including her relationship with Bill Hader.\n\n\"It's so weird. I can't even explain it,\" Wong recently told Variety about being in the public eye. \"I have never, ever been snapped by paparazzi until this year.\"\n\n\"I was talking to someone recently and they said, 'I think it's so alarming when it happens because you feel like you've been caught when really, you're not doing anything wrong,'\" she recalled. \"It was someone giving me, in hindsight, advice about their former relationship with a famous person. They had spent so much energy hiding, and that defined the whole relationship. That's still staying with me, and it's quite an adjustment.\"\n\nAnd it's not just an adjustment for Wong—her mom also follows entertainment news.\n\n\"I haven't even discussed it with her, but that must be so surreal for her,\" the stand-up star said. \"I'm trying to get used to it.\""
