        "text": "The recent reveal of Bill Belichick’s new 24-year-old beauty queen girlfriend has left the Miss USA pageant world reeling.\n\nJordon Hudson was a contender for the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants as far back as 2019 and even still competing until news of her 72-year-old new squeeze – who she met on an airplane in 2021 – became public.\n\nOne fellow competitor in Miss Mass. Teen USA in 2020 told The Post: “I didn’t even know she had a boyfriend — I heard from people she’s kind of all over the place with dating.\n\n“I’m so curious how this happened. He’s old enough to be her grandfather!\n\n“She’s not shy — wanting the limelight is one thing but dating someone in his 70s is another. I didn’t realize she’d go as far to do that for fame.”\n\nHudson — first runner up for Miss Maine 2024 and was also 3rd runner up in Miss Mass. Teen in 2020 —also made quite an entrance at Tom Brady’s Hall of Fame induction on June 12, when she appeared in a white Porsche rumored to have been a gift from Belichick, according to sources.\n\nSeveral of her friends in the beauty contest world said Hudson was not typical of the kind of girls who usually compete.\n\n“She is not a pageant girl,” said another fellow competitor who did not want her name used.\n\n“The rule for Miss USA is you can compete in two states per year. She competed for Maine and she was slated to compete for Alaska [but] she dropped out. I don’t know if it has to do with this news coming out.\n\n“I was shocked – not so much by the age [difference] but I don’t know in what world Bill Belichick would be riding a commercial plane,” the source noted, before speculating, “My guess would be they met on a dating app, maybe Raya, or an upscale dating app.”\n\nHowever, Belichick appears to be no stranger to commercial aviation. This past April, days after his 72nd birthday, he was spotted at Logan Airport, sitting on a communal bench in the terminal, wearing shorts, sneakers with no socks and a vest, working on his Apple laptop.\n\nHe is said to have met Hudson on a flight from Boston to Florida, according to TMZ, which obtained a photo of their first encounter.\n\nHe was said to be so enthralled with the then-student-athlete’s philosophy project he signed his autograph in her “Deductive Logic” textbook.\n\n“Jordon, Thanks for giving me a course on logic! Safe travels!” Belichick wrote.\n\nHudson lists herself in an online profile as a “philosopher, entrepreneur and ‘21 NCA Collegiate Champion,” all claims that she can back up.\n\nRaised in a modest home on Cape Cod, Hudson held a cosmetology license, then studied philosophy at Bridgewater State College, where she made the Dean’s list in Spring 2021. However, she has not yet officially graduated, the school told The Post.\n\nPhotos on Hudson’s Facebook also show her celebrating as a member of Bridgewater State University Cheerleading Club, after they won a National Championships in 2021 at the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) Championship.\n\nHudson is also CEO of a Boston-based company called Trouble Cub Enterprises, according to her LinkedIn, but it’s not clear what kind of business it is.\n\nShe is also interested in property and listed as owner of two homes in the Boston area, according to documents viewed by The Post.\n\nOne, a two-bedroom ranch in Harwich, Mass., sold for $610,000 in 2023. Another, a three-family with 15 bedrooms in Roxbury Crossing, went for $3 million – however, Hudson is not believed to live at either.\n\nEarlier this week, Ring camera footage, which initially surfaced last year, of a shirtless man leaving a house was confirmed to be eight-time Super Bowl winner Belichick exiting the Massachusetts residence where Hudson lives, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nThe couple was spotted in a more glamorous setting Wednesday, as they went out on the former NFL coach’s boat around Nantucket.\n\nHudson, who did not respond to The Post’s outreach for comment, also joined friends of Belichick’s one-time star player Tom Brady and his ex-wife Gisele Bundchen on a dive trip in Costa Rica last year.\n\nWhile vacationing in Central America, it seems, the philosopher-in-the-making did not showboat about her ties to the rich and famous.\n\n“She seemed like a nice young kid,” said a spokesman for Luminous Heart Institute, a yoga and wellness retreat in Costa Rica, still frequented by Bundchen. “She somehow landed on our boat.”\n\nOne of the Miss USA sources said Hudson is “outgoing and easy to talk to” and would “definitely go up to a guy at a bar and say hey — she wouldn’t be afraid to do it.”\n\nHer union with one of the most prominent men in the NFL has certainly set tongues wagging among her peers – especially the 48 year age gap between them.\n\n“Compared to her, my friends and I, we all have normal dating lives with guys our age,” the source added.\n\n“Guys who we met in college. Someone told me her dating life has been not really average. I’m definitely curious about this. I went straight to my group chat … She never mentioned one thing.”"
