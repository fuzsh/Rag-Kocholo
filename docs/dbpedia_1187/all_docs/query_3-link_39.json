        "text": "Vincent Scarfo I would say this is for a 16+ audience. I have no idea what people are talking about with the \"graphic\" sex scenes, because they used a lot of language that implied sex without explicitly talking about the sexual acts. I feel like these folks would be shocked if they read an actually graphic sex scene. Unless maybe they find gay sex to be more graphic than straight sex?\n\nLou The book is considered New Adult fiction, though I think older teenagers (sixteen and older) would be perfectly fine reading it! Though there are several sex scenes in the book, I don't think they're all that graphic, though it is made abundantly clear that sex is what's happening. I honestly think the swearing/coarse language (of which there is a lot) is more of an indicator of its New Adult genre than the sex scenes are.\n\nThe main protagonists are around the age of 23, give or take a year or two!\n\nIlse Cooten Me, an European, always gets a bit upset about this \"fear\" of sex scenes, especially gay sex scenes. Is this an American thing?\n\nOn YT there are straight sex scenes without me having to prove I'm an adult one. And the gay ones: please hand me over your ID card so I can check you are old enough to watch. HELP.\n\nI wish I had books like this/ Skam/Young Royals/Love Simon in my 15+ life. It would have helped me so much to be more at ease with myself\n\nSo: who cares?\n\nKyle It’s tagged overwhelmingly as “Young Adult” on Goodreads, which is what I saw initially, and went into thinking it was. This is problematic, because there are about a dozen sex scenes, and I (a man in his 30’s) found them to be fairly graphic. The MCs are all in their early twenties. Also, there is a high level of crude language. So, to clarify: this is 100% Contemporary NA Romance.\n\nElizabeth I agree with those that are saying that there are \"sex scenes\" that are implied sex without explicitly talking about the sexual acts. I think that is the perfect way to describe the sex scenes in this book. However, with that being said, the severe use of coarse and explicit language is what steered me away from calling this a \"Young Adult\" book, including the words used to describe certain aspects of the sex scenes themselves (I recall a mention, and I am paraphrasing here, where the MC addresses the Prince by stating something to the effect of \"You're saying that now after you just had my d*** in your mouth?\" - that isn't exactly an EXPLICIT sex scene, but it is quite direct, and language is not spared).\n\nLaurel Wanrow I also was headed for the YA section to find it, but the story is NA, more mature situations and language. As an avid romance reader, I found the sex scenes to definitely be sex scenes, and plentiful, which is typical of the new adult genre, but not written on a too-graphic level.\n\nruby I thought it was YA before buying it, even looked for it in that section at my bookstore, but after reading it, I can tell you it's definitely not YA (a ton of graphic sex scenes and huge amounts of swearing) and the main protagonists are 21-23 years old. It was under the Romance section at my bookstore.\n\nPJP noooooo why is everyone saying it's a NA it's NOT, this is DEFENITLY a Young adult (I'm 14, and it's perfect) and I actually don't like to read/watch grafic stuff, and it's not that grafic seriously, I mean, like Riverdale and that kind of series are worse..."
