        "text": "Much like the rest of the internet, some of Bill Belichick’s former players have plenty to say about the ex-Patriots coach’s highly publicized romance with 23-year-old Jordon Hudson.\n\nDuring an appearance on Julian Edelman’s “Games with Names” podcast, Rob Gronkowski elaborated on Belichick’s love life and how certain factors contradicted what the Patriots were told when they played in New England.\n\n“He always told us there’s three things out there that don’t get caught up in,” the former tight end said in a clip from Tuesday’s episode. “What was the trifecta, Julian? Can you please explain the trifecta?”\n\nThe retired wide receiver, who spent his entire 12-year career in New England, then called out the trinity of “alcohol,” “a–holes” and “girls.”\n\n“And now he’s all caught up with the girls,” Gronkowski exclaimed. “We love you, coach, we love you.”\n\nGronkowski played for Belichick, 72, in New England from 2010 through 2018 and won three Super Bowls.\n\nEdelman became a three-time Super Bowl champion between 2009 and 2020.\n\nBelichick parted ways with the Patriots in January after 24 seasons and is not coaching this year — something Gronkowski, 35, and Edelman, 38, suggested could be attributed to the bending of the rules.\n\n“Timeout, he’s not coaching anymore though, so….,” Gronkowski said, to which Edelman continued, “So maybe then he can be in the trifecta.”\n\n“He’s allowed to be in the trifecta,” Gronkowski quipped.\n\nBelichick’s relationship with Hudson, a former cheerleader, was first revealed in early June.\n\nThe revelation came months after Page Six reported in September 2023 that Belichick and his longtime girlfriend, Linda Holliday, were “involved in a drawn-out, back-and-forth breakup for nearly a year.”\n\nBelichick first crossed paths with Hudson aboard a flight in 2021, when the coach allegedly became enthralled by the then-student athlete’s philosophy project, TMZ previously reported.\n\nThe six-time Super Bowl-winning coach with Patriots signed the inside of her textbook and posed for a picture.\n\nA source told People of the pair this week, “It’s easy to see that Bill could become infatuated with her. She is young and attractive and interesting. I don’t know what she wants from him but they seem to be enjoying each other and like doing many of the same things.”"
