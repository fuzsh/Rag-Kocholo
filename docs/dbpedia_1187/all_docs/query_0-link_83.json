Nevertheless, the Ohio native was in a serious relationship with model Dara Tomanovich — keep reading for details regarding their romance.\n\nBill dated Canadian model Dara Tomanovich for eight years.\n\nBill's longest public relationship was with Canadian model Dara Tomanovich. The couple dated for eight years, from 2005 until 2013. According to her official IMDb page, Dara was born in Toronto in 1969. At just 18 years old, she decided to pursue an acting and modeling career after meeting renowned German fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld in Paris.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nOnce Dara became the face of the French luxury fashion house Chloé, her career really took off, so much so that she managed to book campaigns with Marie Claire, L'Oreal, and British Vogue.

The pair were spotted together in the Royal Box at the annual Royal Ascot event. For those unaware, Dara essentially has ties to the Royal Family since she supports many charities, including Prince Harry's Sentebale foundation.\n\nThe two clearly didn't work out since Prince Andrew reportedly dated singer Kylie Minogue from 2017 to 2018.\n\nHow much money does Bill Hemmer make at Fox News?\n\nAlthough little is know about Bill's dating life, we do know the Fox co-anchor is getting paid a pretty penny for his efforts at work. Bill Hemmer's net worth currently stands at $14 million, and he collects an estimated $3 million annually from Fox News, per Celebrity Net Worth. Not bad!"
