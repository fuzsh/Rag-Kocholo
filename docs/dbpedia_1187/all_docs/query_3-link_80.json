        "text": "DNF\n\nGenre: New Adult, Romance, Science Fiction/Fantasy\n\nTheme: Dragons\n\nIf you are even remotely on bookish social media, then you are aware of Fourth Wing. It’s been much-hyped and sold out and everywhere I look online there are rave reviews for this YA-fantasy-romance.\n\nI am not here to yuck anyone’s yum. If you read Fourth Wing and you loved it, I am totally happy for you. I want people to love what they read.\n\nThis was not a book that worked for me, though, and I suspect I’m probably not the only one who didn’t love it. I made it about 45% of the way though before I finally decided this was just going to be a slog for me and I gave up.\n\nThere were two main reasons I could not get interested in this book\n\nThe fantasy archetypes and tropes at work in the plot, and\n\nThe pacing\n\nFourth Wing is set in a fantasy world where the country of Navarre protects its borders with an elite army of dragon riders. When they are approximately of real-world college age, the young people of Navarre enter one of four quadrants in order to serve their country. Violet Sorrengail is small and accident prone, and by all accounts should enter the Scribe Quadrant. Instead, Violet’s mother, a general, sends her to the Rider’s Quadrant where she’ll probably be killed before graduation (side note: Violet’s mom is not great).\n\nIf Violet survives her time at the War College she will hopefully be selected by a dragon to be its bonded rider.\n\nI don’t fully understand why the War College is so invested in killing off its cadets (or having them kill each other). Fratricide is openly welcomed in order to weed out the “weak” recruits. At the same time we’re reminded frequently that there are fewer riders and fewer dragons every year, and I believe this is definitely a case of causation, not correlation. Also don’t they need people for other jobs? Who makes lunch?\n\nViolet shouldn’t be in the Rider Quadrant. She’s very academic and would have excelled as a scribe, like her father. It would appear that everyone in the Rider Quadrant knows this, and multiple people offer to help her find a way to get out and get over to the Scribe’s where, frankly, things sound a lot better. Violet refuses on the grounds that her mom would find a way to send her back (why?) and because she stubbornly wants to prove She Can Do It (why?).\n\nSometimes, in the real world, you cannot do the thing even though you really believe in yourself. I have a friend who convinced herself she could accomplish a Tough Mudder through the power of belief and positive thinking, and then she broke some ribs.\n\nCadet training involves something like the balance beam from hell as well as a Ninja Warrior course, all while the other cadets are trying to murder you. Somehow Violet makes it through, mostly because she’s clearly The Chosen One.\n\nThe Chosen One is a trope seen often in YA fantasy and it doesn’t really work for me. That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with it; it’s just not a trope I particularly enjoy and this book relies heavily on it. For me The Chosen One trope allows the reader to accept that the heroine is somehow more special than her peers without actually doing much to prove it. In Violet’s case she’s clever and brave (if foolishly so IMO) but so are a lot of the other cadets. Violet even has the special hair (the ends are always silver regardless of how short she cuts it) that indicates a The Chosen One heroine. She won’t give up, she has fun hair, and two hot guys like her so she must be our heroine, I guess.\n\nThe first half of the book is a boarding school book meets Hunger Games where alliances are formed, Violet injures herself a lot, and well meaning people worry after her, but she is determined to prove her mother wrong even though she hates it and will probably die anyway. It really crawled for me, probably because the stakes seemed so ridiculous that I didn’t care that much anyway. I mean, her first day of school is walking the balance beam of death while the guy behind her tries to stab her, and that’s a level of intensity I’m just not here for.\n\nAlso…why? Why is this entire society’s military founded on twenty-year-old’s killing each other? If the weak have to be weeded out, why not put them in a job somewhere else? Wouldn’t you just have a ton of sociopathic dragon riders at the end?\n\nTo be fair, some of this could have been answered if I had finished the book, but I didn’t.\n\nIt takes almost half the book for Violet to survive Dragon Basic Training and finally meet and bond to a dragon. It was at that point I gave up. If I wasn’t invested when the talking dragons showed up, I wasn’t going to be invested, period.\n\nThere’s also a romance element here between Violet and her Wing Leader Xaden, who is the meanest and scariest of the wing leaders, and also her mom got his family killed. So that’s going to make the holidays real awkward. Violet is so attracted to him he makes her scalp tingle. Like Head and Shoulders, I guess. The tingling means the romance is working?"
