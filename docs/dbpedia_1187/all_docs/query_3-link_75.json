They met initially at the local museum where Ben caught Mary's eye because he was measuring the famous Mona Lisa painting with a measuring tape. They went on a first date to the movies, and while neither of them liked the movie they saw, they still had an enjoyable evening. night\n\nSoon Ben lets us know that he's fallen head over heels for Mary and that he would like to surprise her by proposing marriage. Soon after this Mary comes to the café to organize her wedding reception. We then learn that Ben proposed while on a walk in the park (on bended knee playing Mendelssohn's Wedding March on a whistle). Ben and Mary had a quick wedding by the Justice of the Peace at town hall and Ben promptly decided he could no longer live with a different name than Mary and changed his to Ditt as well.\n\nAfter you set up what Mary requested for the reception, she starts questioning whether or not she's ready for this. She then turns to you for advice. If you tell her that it's her choice or that she's ready for it, it will lead to her asking you to invite Margaret, Bill, Koffsky, Petrovich and Watson Holmes. Each will decline the invite (Bill because he's in love with Mary, Margaret because she has been married 13 times and is tired of going to weddings, Koffsky because he cannot afford a gift and Watson because work has been busy).\n\nIf you tell her that she's not ready for this, she will cancel the reception (?).\n\nUnfortunately, as Mary waits for Ben to show up, Ben is nowhere to be found and missing for two days. After a quick chat with the local officer, Watson Holmes, we find out the police are looking for a Ben Jones, in connection to the local robbery of the museum where the Mona Lisa has been stolen, the very name Mary remembers Ben using on their marriage certificate. The manhunt quickly ends when Ben Ditt... Jones... is taken to the local police station where he gives a statement about the robbery, insisting he has been framed. A few levels later Mary Ditt visits Ben in prison and tries to prove his innocence. Ben claims the painting is a fake and he was framed. Mary divorces him although she believes he is innocent.

He mentions that whoever slandered his reputation was someone whom he had always gotten along with and while they were competitive, they were always honest before becoming too caught up in emotion and needing a break.\n\nAt level 5 Watson Holmes mentions there are two Koffskys although he is not sure whether he is one person or two. Bill manages to find an old photo with Koffsky, a Koffsky-clone called Edward and a server called Alice Carroll. By looking at the photo Margaret guesses that Edward, Koffsky's twin brother and business partner, sabotaged his brother's recipes by buying poor-quality ingredients. He also sabotaged Koffsky's relationship with his girlfriend Alice by pouring something into her drink at an important event because he was jealous of their relationship. Koffsky confirms the story saying he was planning to propose to Alice the night she had an anaphylactic reaction to the tampered drink. Alice was upset that Koffsky had forgotten her allergy and Koffsky left. After hearing his story back, Koffsky realizes he had been a coward. He vows to find Alice again, explains what really happened and makes amends.\n\nRequirements: Ice Tea for Bill, Cupcake With Cinnamon and Anise for Margaret.\n\nRewards: 8 diamonds, 2100 Prestige points\n\nLevel 6: The First Step[]\n\nAt level 4 Bill revealed he had been in love with Mary Ditt for 2 years.

They exchange notes and Mary agrees to go on a date with him although she does not believe her 'admirer' is really Bill.

A childhood friend of his, Charlie Choke, got into shady business while Petrovich married and settled with his wife. One day, Charlie asked Petrovich to help him rob a bank. Petrovich accepted because it was easy money, but things took a wrong turn: Charlie said guards were coming, pushed Petrovich in the then empty vault, where he got locked in. Petrovich heard a shot, thought Charlie was wounded and maybe even dead. Petrovich was arrested. He confessed about cracking the safe and went to jail but he did not say a word about Charlie. His wife left him at the time. Police investigated to know where the money was but she didn't have any.\n\nAt level 7, Petrovich's ex-wife calls him, says she is coming home and wants to see him. Petrovich, who says he is still crazy about his ex-wife, plans to meet her in the café. He then learns that his ex-wife wants him to participate in another robbery. Bill manages to dig up information on her: she came to town with Petrovich's old friend. Petrovich concludes they lied to him and have been together this whole time, spending the money they stole.

If Bill moves in with Mary, the cat will have less to chew on, but the internet connection is slow where Mary lives. If the player chooses to have Bill move in with Mary, they will need to convince Margaret to let the cable companies dig up her backyard to implant more cables and allow a faster internet connection.

Police dog constantly bites Watson, so you need to give him Americano with Nutmeg and Whipped Cream to tame the dog. He tells you a story of how he became a policeman. Once he defended a certain waitress, who was attacked in the park. Watson defended the bandit, but instead of taking interest in the girl, he fell in love with paperwork...\n\nWhen Watson successfully (thanks to the dog) finds Koffsky's wallet, there is a woman's photo in it. Watson recognizes her as a girl whom he rescued once. The girl turns out to be Alice, Koffsky's love. You share this news with Koffsky and suggest both men should talk about it to each other.\n\nWhen you see Koffsky again, he tells you about Watson's odd reaction. Then you talk to Watson, who tells you there's nothing wrong. Then both men leave immediately. Soon after that arrives Koffsky. He is rude and grumpy. Margaret suggests that he's under scopolamine's influence, but is it possible? After some time, Watson arrives, visibly confused. He doesn't seem to remember what happened after the talk with Koffsky. Margaret advises performing hypnosis, which becomes a pretext for Watson to ask you to buy a leather couch. During the hypnosis, Watson starts to remember that he was attacked by someone looking like Koffsky. You remember about his vicious brother Edward. After this revelation, the impostor runs away (though sometimes he stays and demands to let him end his meal).

He requests a Galangal Tea to relax, but it somehow falls off the table. Petrovich swears he didn't touch it. You decide to tell Watson this but he suddenly gets chills even though the café is warm. You then ask Bill to do some research on his tablet, which suddenly loses connection. He comes back and says to sprinkle salt by the windows and doors. Dogs can sense ghosts so, later, you borrow Cleo's dog, Marshmallow, which remains calm. You then pour Petrovich another cup of tea. It doesn't fall this time. Watson is no longer cold and Bill's tablet works fine. You talk to Margaret about this, who claims that the ghosts tales are a bunch of fake tales designed to scare children. Then, she feels a pinch.

Elsa admits she was out again with Kevin that night but swears she wasn't the one who killed him. Elsa then remembers that Kevin went out on the night of the murder and begins to suspect he was involved. Bill checks the security tapes for Watson Holmes and discovers that Kevin went to Elsa's house at 1:00 am. However, it turns out he was just delivering mail. He even met Leopold and told him about the affair. Leopold was very calm about it. He just wanted Elsa to be happy, even if it was with a different man. Kevin left before he got murdered but remembers two people being in the house that night: a woman and a man. After some asking around, the question came up if Leopold had any other wives before Elsa. Turns out, he did! Judging from the bullet position in Leopold's head, the gun was shot by a fairly tall person. Someone else, a man wearing lots of cologne, was also involved in the murder.

Turns out, the new customer isn’t a criminal at all, but a celebrity who goes by the name “Workhorse.” When you talk to the new customer, he asks for a Invigorating Tea and introduces himself as Clyde Bowen.\n\nChatting with Margaret, you notice the beautiful necklace she’s wearing. Her ex-husband only ever gave her two presents: the necklace and Clyde Bowen performing at their wedding. Clyde remembers playing at Margaret’s wedding, but his memory is a little hazy and he mixes up some of the details telling you the story. He asks you to make him an Iced Latte to help him collect his thoughts. After you give him his latte, he remembers he was at two of Margaret’s weddings and they were very similar: they both took place at a museum and there was even the same groom and bride, although the bride’s hair was a different color. And, to top it off, both times there was a robbery! The police unfortunately never caught the culprits at either incident.\n\nYou ask Watson, the coffee shop's resident police officer, about the robberies at the Louvre and Naples Museum and he says his friend at Interpol will help for a Vanilla Frappé. The robberies at both museums are part of the same case, and there are actually twelve similar incidents that took place. From the case photos, you recognize the necklace in one of them as the same one Margaret is wearing. When you confront Margaret, she already knows what you’re going to ask about. In exchange for her story, she asks for a White Hot Chocolate and you find out that she’s married the same man a total of thirteen times!

Clyde tells you when he was young and on tour he had met quite a few people—ladies, that is. Now he’s traveling around, trying to track down the women from his past and possibly the children he’s never had the chance to meet so he can try to make up for the lost years, though he hasn’t been able to find any of them yet. You offer to help him in his search and enlist the aid of Watson and Bill. The police officer says he’ll search through the police archives while the programmer says he’ll try hacking the hospital’s records to see if anything turns up.\n\nBill only asks you for a Mojito Espresso in return to keep him from falling asleep as he looks through all the records from the last twenty years.\n\n(To be continued at Level 13)\n\nRequirements: Mojito Espresso for Bill\n\nReward: Diamonds from Bill\n\nLevel 13[]\n\nClyde's Daughter II[]\n\nWhen you talk to Bill again, he tells you a name-based search didn’t turn up any results for Clyde's children, although there have only been two children raised by single mothers in the town in the last 20 years. One moved away about a decade ago, but one still lives in the town: Emily Roberts.\n\nMeeting Emily for the first time, you find out she’s an advertising agent. By talking to customers, you learn that she is a competent and hard-working young woman. She is also very practical, and is excited to meet her father after all these years despite growing up in a single-parent household. Clyde, on the other hand, is a nervous wreck—he never really thought he had an unknown child somewhere, let alone that you would find them! Whether to calm his anxiety or to fulfill his latest celebrity whim, Clyde asks you for a Muffin before he meets with his daughter.\n\nWhen you talk to Emily and Clyde again, you find that their first meeting went really well and they hit it off! They have a lot in common, including muffins being their favorite dessert. Clyde will pass on a message that Bill needs to speak with you, but not without giving you 5 diamonds and a Pink Gift for everything you’ve done for him.\n\nTalking to Bill, you learn that he made a mistake in his search for Mr. Bowen’s offspring. Genetically, Clyde and Emily are not a match. He also tells you he’s found Emily’s real biological father who’s been in jail for murder for 21 years. While the news is hard to swallow for both Clyde and Emily, they decide that they don’t care about formalities. Clyde is going to adopt Emily as his daughter and put down roots in the town.\n\nRequirements: Muffin for Clyde\n\nRewards: 1 Pink Gift from Clyde\n\nMary's True Parents[]\n\nBill is perfectly happy with his relationship with Mary, especially since he discovered the secret to a perfect relationship: each person has to have their own computer. When you speak with Mary, you find that she feels the same way about Bill, except for one little thing: for some reason the programmer gets very shy around her friend Elsa. After talking with Bill, you find out the poor guy is afraid he’s been behaving improperly and the ladies are putting him through the wringer. Bill has nothing to worry about, however, because Mary thinks her boyfriend can do no wrong. On the other hand, things aren’t quite so black and white when it comes to Elsa. Mary thinks her friend is too tactful to criticize anyone, so she asks you to find out whether Elsa really likes Bill or is just telling white lies to avoid hurting Mary’s feelings.\n\nElsa actually likes Bill very much, although she does think he’s a little dorky. However, this “scoop” is nothing compared to what she said next: that she’s Mary’s biological mother! She asks you for a Raf with Nutmeg and Rose before she tells you her story. She explains that Mary was born as a result of a short-lived but passionate affair. Unable to take care of her child, she decided to put Mary up for adoption. She’s worried that if Mary uncovers the truth, she’ll stop speaking to her. She asks you to speak to Mary and find out more about her childhood.\n\nMary says she had a good childhood and wonderful parents. When you tell Elsa this, she says she’s ready to tell Mary who her real mother is. If you kept her secret, she will give you 5 diamonds and a Pink Gift as thanks.\n\nElsa plucked up her courage and told Mary everything. Mary understood and forgave her, and they continue to be friends. However, Mary is now very curious about the identity of her real father. Elsa decided that Mary isn’t ready to learn the whole truth about her parents yet. There have been too many changes in the young woman’s life recently.\n\nThe news that the elderly man in the gray hat is Clyde Bowen made a strong impression on Elsa. She admits that she was madly in love with the musician when she was younger. When you tell her that Clyde wants to adopt Emily Roberts as his daughter, she admits that Clyde is Mary’s biological father. It’s all a little complicated, and she asks you to talk to Margaret, who is a master at unraveling complicated situations.\n\nMargaret’s opinion about the situation with Clyde’s child is this: if Clyde finds out about Mary, he’ll probably refuse to adopt Emily. If you convince Elsa not to tell Clyde about his real daughter, Mary, she agrees that telling him and Mary would only lead to heartbreak. Mary is perfectly happy and Clyde is, too, now that he’s found Emily.\n\nRequirements: Raf with Nutmeg and Rose for Elsa\n\nLevel 14[]\n\nGreen Moon Fund[]\n\nDonald Mulligan, the mayor of the town, doesn’t seem like a nice guy. He asks you for a Vanilla Ice Cream with Nuts, after which he’ll decide whether he wants to become a regular at the coffee shop or not. After giving him the dessert, he gives you some diamonds and promises to think about ways to make your partnership more productive.\n\nThe mayor has set up the “Green Moon” foundation, collecting money to… plant greenery on the Moon. He asks you to survey your regular customers to find out their impressions of him and his foundation. Ron says that one of the mayor’s funds was collecting money to develop their soccer club. In the end, there was only enough money to buy one new ball. Watson’s under no false impressions about Mayor Donald Mulligan’s integrity. However, he explains that the cops are bound hand and foot. Donald has a whole army of lawyers apparently. Kevin thinks Donald is a very experienced politician. During his speech at the union he found a clever way to convince everyone that, despite the fact that everything is absolutely fine and the town is thriving, there are no plans to raise wages in the foreseeable future. He also says that letters addressed to the mayor’s fund often contain profanities. It seems that some citizens are furious about the activities of “Green Moon.” Bill had nothing bad to say about the mayor’s foundation, but he’s probably just not interested in it. Margaret is utterly convinced that the foundation is linked to some kind of scam. Mary knows nothing about the “Green Moon” foundation, but she evidently isn’t keen on the mayor himself.\n\nDonald thinks that your customer survey won’t be complete until you talk to Jennifer. To get her to come to the coffee shop, you’re going to have to raise your prestige level. Donald gives you some diamonds as a sign of his gratitude for the work you’ve done and reminds you that it isn’t quite finished yet.\n\n(To be continued at level 15)\n\nRequirements: Vanilla Ice Cream with Nuts for Donald\n\nRewards: Some diamonds from Donald\n\nHigh and Dry[]\n\nBen says he saw Edward Koffsky, Buzz’s evil twin, working at a gas station. Watson, who has a thirst for vengeance, has decided to arrest Edward himself. The cop wants to give the perpetrator a detailed explanation of why it isn’t nice to hit on-duty police officers in the head with shovels. When Watson returns to the coffee shop, he says there was a mix-up when he arrested Edward. The cop agrees to share the details over a cup of Coffee with Cardamom. It turns out the man working at the gas station wasn’t Edward but his brother, the former chef. Apparently Koffsky has been having money trouble for a long time. The bank is threatening to foreclose on his house unless he can make his next mortgage payment. If you lend Koffsky 250 diamonds instead of asking Donald for help, he promises to return 300 diamonds to you later. If you do not give him the diamonds, you can persuade Donald to help out, and the mayor will convince the bank to give Koffsky more time for the current month's payment.\n\nWhen you speak with the former chef again, he still doesn’t have a plan for getting out of his difficult financial situation. Could one of your customers suggest a decent plan? You decide to start the survey with Petrovich.\n\nHaving set foot on the path to wellness, Petrovich’s only advice to Koffsky is to work harder. Ben couldn’t offer much advice seeing as how he’s currently unemployed. Margaret thinks you should advise Koffsky to rent out part of his home to Clyde Bowen, who just happens to be looking for a place. Koffsky is enthusiastic about the suggestion of living with Clyde. The musician, for his part, agrees to hear you out on one condition: you serve him an Americano with Cream, Cinnamon, Popcorn and Star Anise. Clyde agrees to rent part of Koffsky’s house, despite his reservations about Koffsky’s evil twin brother. Koffsky is pleased with his new neighbor and tells you Clyde isn’t too grumpy as long as you get enough coffee in him.\n\n(To be continued after level 18)\n\nRequirements: Coffee with Cardamom for Watson, 250 for Koffsky (optional), Americano with Cream, Cinnamon, Popcorn and Star Anise for Clyde\n\nReward: Some diamonds from Koffsky\n\nLevel 15: Green Moon Fund & Mayoral Election[]\n\nWith Margaret's help Jennifer plans to get into the archives of the mayor's fund and exposes it as a scam. Margaret manages to steal the mayor's files and gives them to Bill so he can decrypt them. In a surprising twist, she tells Donald about it and he makes Watson Holmes confiscate Bill's computer. The Mayor has then no choice but to let the police decrypt the files and expose his secret to prove Bill has stolen the files, which was Margaret's plan all along. He decides to return Bill's computer instead even though this makes him look like a fool.\n\nJennifer then decides to go up against him in the next election. Both request the player to ask the café customers who they are going to vote for. The survey reveals that the election would be a tie unless Mary Ditt voted. The player convinces her to do so and get to decide whom she will vote for and thus who wins the election.

When confronted by the player she quickly admits she did it. Margaret claims she stole the previous paintings only to expose the Syndicate, the organization she worked for and which had replaced the paintings with fakes. As for the Mona Lisa, Margaret explains she did it to save Carl's life: the Syndicate had kidnapped Carl and were threatening to send him back piece by piece.\n\nRequirements: Chocolate Ice Cream with Saffron for Mary, Iced Tea with Tapioca and Milk for Margaret, Crepe with Vanilla Ice Cream, Cream, Nutmeg and Cardamom for Watson.\n\nTip: Don't tell Watson the name.\n\nClyde's Concert[]\n\nClyde dreams of giving another concert, but he needs to write a new song to perform.

Unfortunately, Jennifer is stretching herself out too thin trying to get the town ready. She asks you to make her a Sweet Roll with Saffron to help her sleep, just like her grandmother used to make her when she was little.\n\nWhen you talk to her again, she tells you that she wasn’t able to fall asleep and asks you to see what the other customers do to help with insomnia. In the end, she goes with Petrovich’s idea: fishing. Petrovich ends up tagging along to escape some of his own problems. Unfortunately, something happens during the fishing trip and Petrovich returns asking for an Americano with Saffron and Cardamom to calm him down so he can tell the story. It turns out after Felicia dragged him home in a jealous rage after seeing him and Jennifer fishing together, Jennifer had gone missing! He returned to the fishing spot to find Jennifer and when she comes to the coffee shop she says she barely got any sleep.\n\nThrowing a huge party might help her since it worked for her roommate back in college, and Jennifer asks you to talk to Cleo. The DJ is currently planning a crazy outdoor party.

For her help, Margaret requests a Sweet Roll with Cinnamon and Caramel Syrup. After fulfilling her order, she suggests that Jennifer should run a marathon - it’s a sure way to tire her out. Margaret has other plans, however, and traps Jennifer in the locker room, snatching her phone away before the marathon even begins!

Carl tells you that, while he doesn’t know the recipe or ingredients needed to make a supercupcake, he does know where to find them. The recipe has been split into three parts. In exchange for helping him find the missing pieces, he promises to give you a Supercupcake Display Case.\n\nThe first part of the recipe is in the police archives in a file for Iron Mulligan, but, unfortunately, Watson doesn’t have access to it since they’re reorganizing the archives. You try to ask Margaret for help and she agrees, but tells you that you will also need the help of Iron Mulligan’s next of kin, his son Donald. He asks you for a Homemade Sweet Roll in return for his help and tags along with Margaret.\n\nThe two return to the coffee shop with some news: the recipe was only a fragment of jumbled words, not a whole part. You go to Donald to get the recipe fragment from him and thank him, but he says on their way back to the coffee shop they got into a fight with a shady group of people and he lost the recipe somewhere in the fray. He suggests you go to Watson for help, who gushes that Donald is the town’s new superhero for taking down a group of thugs who were trying to steal candy from a kid. Thankfully, Watson did find the recipe fragment at the scene and gives it to you. Carl tells you the next recipe fragment is apparently back in the archives too, this time in Corwin Mulligan’s file, Donald’s grandfather. Even though Watson turned you down earlier, someone—Margaret—broke into the archives recently and organized everything and he agrees to help on one condition: ask Donald if he’ll help out the force because they need his crime-fighting abilities. Donald suggests opening a new line just for superhero duties and asks for a Tea with Saffron, Galangal and Anise in exchange. When you deliver the drink, he says he has opened a new secret line for the police to contact him and Watson goes to the police archives for you. He returns successfully with the recipe fragment in hand.\n\nThe final recipe fragment is in none other than Donald Mulligan’s file. When you speak with him, Donald tells you that Watson has been calling him nonstop. He asks for a Lassi with Honey, Saffron and Cardamom and to tell Watson to only call him when there’s an emergency. Unfortunately, it has the opposite effect and everyone in the precinct seems to be calling Donald for the most mundane things. With his last shred of sanity, he admits that he paid the Candy Bandits off to turn themselves in so he’d look better in the upcoming elections. He begs you to talk to Watson since he’s worried the town will never trust him again, but the cop knew all along that Donald was just pretending and hatched this scheme to make him admit it. He asks you for a cup of Tapioca Tea with Milk, Vanilla, and Cardamom and for you to tell Donald to come clean publicly. Donald readily agrees if it makes the onslaught of phone calls to him stop and gives you the last recipe fragment.\n\nWith the last piece, Carl is ready to put everything together. He returns with the recipe, but now has a new plan: he wants to propose to Margaret with a supercupcake since she loves cupcakes. He hands you a note and a supercupcake to give to her, which Margaret answers immediately. Apparently, she’d been dropping hints to Carl this whole time. You tell the great news to Carl and he gives you a Supercupcake Display Case.\n\nRequirements: Homemade Sweet Roll for Donald, Tea with Saffron, Galangal and Anise for Donald, Lassi with Honey, Saffron and Cardamom for Donald, Tapioca Tea with Milk, Vanilla and Cardamom for Watson\n\nReward: Supercupcake Display Case\n\nLevel 35[]\n\nThe Damned Mirror[]\n\nKoffsky tells you that the Vintage Mirror that Jennifer had given you in Level 34 is the mirror of Bloody Penny. He will do anything for you to help him, even give you a Gold Gift. When you ask him to explain who Bloody Penny is, he says he will if you can make him a Rose Supercupcake with Grenadine, Whipped Cream and Cardamom.\n\nKoffsky starts telling you the story, how it all started back when he, Henry, Elsa and Donald were still in school. They were a bit wild back then and one day they decided to summon the ghost of Bloody Penny. Legend has it that Bloody Penny haunts whoever dares say her name three times. For his part, Donald isn’t entirely convinced and says you should talk to Elsa and let her know since she was scared to death of Bloody Penny. Elsa says Henry was the one who figured out how to get rid of the mirror all those years ago, but when you talk with him you find out the only reason he got rid of the mirror was so his friends could finally calm down, not because he believed they were actually being haunted. He offers to take the mirror off your hands and tells you to let Koffsky know it’s gone.\n\nEven without the mirror, Koffsky is still worried, convinced that Bloody Penny is back to finish the job. He returns to the coffee shop and tells you an ominous message was written on his bathroom mirror. Desperate to get proof that Bloody Penny’s ghost is real, he plans to carry a camera wherever he goes so he can capture the ghost on film and show it to Henry. But he isn’t the only one the ghost visited. Bloody Penny left Donald a message on his mirror too and phoned him, hissing that he would lose all his money which, as it turns out, is almost true. Donald’s property values have plummeted and he’s hit rock bottom. While he’s brainstorming with Koffsky on what to do, he asks you to try and convince Henry, otherwise they’re all doomed.\n\nWhen you talk to Henry, he thinks that there’s a prankster in their midst. You suggest there might be a connection between the prankster now and the one back then, but Henry tells you that’s impossible because he was the one who had pranked them all, jokingly calling himself “Bloody Henry.” He admits he never meant it to go as far as it did and sincerely regrets it, that’s why he’s hoping the time machine Lucas has been diligently working on for the last month will be finished soon.\n\nUntil the time machine is finished, Henry offers to tell you how he pranked his friends back in school for a Bahraini Coffee with Rose, Cardamom and Saffron. Afterward, he decides to admit to his friends that he pretended to be Bloody Penny when they were kids. Following his confession, Koffsky’s belief that the ghost is real is now even stronger. Henry is fed up trying to convince his friends that the ghost isn’t real, so he decides to take matters into his own hands and track down the culprit himself. Henry returns with surprising results: neither Donald’s mirror nor the payphone used to call the ex-mayor had any fingerprints on them. The payphone was near an old abandoned house, though, but Henry needs Bill’s help to look into its owner: Penelope Wise.\n\nWhen you talk to Bill, he asks for a Supercupcake with Nutmeg, Cardamom, Saffron and Salt and he finds some old newspaper articles about her. When you tell Henry the details of what you found, he says Elsa had a visit from the ghost, with a message written on her mirror. Refusing to stay in her house alone any longer, Henry offers to stay at Elsa’s to check the music box for prints, but instead he sees Koffsky running away from Elsa’s house. Henry thinks their friend is the one who has been acting as the ghost the entire time, but the coffee connoisseur denies it. He was only at Elsa’s trying to get evidence of the ghost on film so he could show Henry, but the private investigator ends up seeing the ghost with his own two eyes.\n\nWith Henry finally on board and believing in the ghost, Koffsky’s next plan of action is to contact Bloody Penny through a spirit board. The hauntress spells out a chilling message for them: Death, horror, decay, and South Night Supercupcake. Not keen on dying a horrific death, Koffsky asks you to make the supercupcake for the hungry ghost. When they go and deliver the dessert to Penelope's old residence, the whole thing turns out to be an elaborate prank on Henry, planned by Koffsky, Elsa, Donald, and starring Clyde as Bloody Penny. Each had their own motive for it, but the main reason was so Koffsky and Clyde’s YouTube channel could get more views—they’re sure the prank footage will go viral. Henry has no hard feelings towards his old friends and is actually grateful for being able to spend so much time with them. Koffsky apologizes for pranking you too and gives you a Gold Gift for your trouble.\n\nRequirements: Rose Supercupcake with Grenadine, Whipped Cream and Cardamom for Koffsky, Bahraini Coffee with Rose, Cardamom and Saffron for Henry, Supercupcake with Nutmeg Cardamom, Saffron and Salt for Bill, South Night Supercupcake for Koffsky\n\nReward: Gold Gift from Koffsky\n\nTime Machine[]\n\nLucas is having some trouble with his time machine and still needs to work out the kinks. When he turned it on, it exploded as Bill and Mary were passing by. He asks you to check on them to see if they’re all right, but it looks like the newlyweds may be out of their honeymoon phase. Both Bill and Mary say they’ve been fighting and it seems to have started out of nowhere. They do still love each other, but now there’s feelings of distrust and annoyance. Upon hearing their predicament, Lucas says when the time machine exploded, it must have opened a wormhole to a parallel universe where Mary and Bill are having problems and on the verge of divorce. Shutting down the time machine may make this reality permanent, Lucas says, so he suggests heading to the parallel universe and try to mend things, but he needs your help as a love consultant while he handles the science side of things. In return for your help, he’ll give you a Gold Gift.\n\nAfter repairing the time machine, Lucas returns to the coffee shop and lets you do the honors: press the RED button and you two will travel to the parallel universe. It’s a little anticlimactic since it looks like nothing’s changed, so Lucas decides to test things out with a Daisy Supercupcake. He says it has a “parallel taste” to it and asks you to talk to the customers, who keep staring at him for some reason, while he checks on his devices. You quickly learn this universe is much different than the one you’re used to. For one, Lucas—or \"Lucassandro\" in this reality—is a famous heartthrob celebrity! No wonder people have been staring at him. You also learn that Mary and Bill aren’t together at all, they never even dated, and Bill doesn’t believe Mary would ever be interested in a guy like him. When Lucas hears that he’s an actor, he’s upset that this world will never know of his inventions and asks you for a Shrikhand with Maple Syrup, Cardamom and Saffron to help him feel better. Afterward, Lucas tells you none of his devices are working and asks you to see if Emily, who is a scientist in this universe, will help.\n\nWith repairs on the time machine coming along nicely, it’s up to you to play matchmaker again for Bill and Mary. Things are headed in the right direction when you talk to Bill, although he says that while he’s really interested in Mary, he’s decided to love her from afar. All he needs is some confidence and maybe a little push, so you suggest that he writes Mary a note. Mary reads the note from her “secret admirer” and agrees to a blind date. Unfortunately, things don’t go quite as planned. On their date, Mary sees Bill as goofy and indecisive, so you ask Ron if Bill can join the soccer team in order for Mary to see the courageous person he can be. But it turns out, in this parallel universe, Ron’s team stopped playing soccer and now plays basketball. They’re out one person, so he agrees to let Bill join if you make him a Supercupcake with Espresso, Chocolate Syrup and Gold. Not used to the mechanics of basketball, Bill performs horribly in the game and Mary says she will never date him now. Despite everything, however, Bill is determined and decides to do what he does best: data analysis. He asks you to see what impresses your female customers when it comes to men so he can analyze their responses, then he heads off to plan the perfect date for Mary.\n\nThe final date is a success and Mary says she fell in love with the programmer and they’re happily dating now! She even managed to get hired by Felicia after writing an article about some of the furniture on the yacht they were on. But there must be a love bug going around because Bill says he saw Lucassandro kissing Emily! When you talk to him, Lucas is heavily in denial and insists it’s simply for a scientific experiment; there’s no feelings of love, only chemical reactions. Still, the time traveler gives you a note to deliver to Emily, who finds his note of binary code romantic and can’t wait for their date.\n\nLucas returns to the coffee shop in a rush and insists you both leave to return back to the other universe right away. Before you have time to ask why, he presses the RED button on the time machine and you arrive back. Lucas says he won’t be able to talk about what happened with Emily until he gets a Honey Milkshake with Tapioca, Cardamom and Rose. You find out that Emily really had treated the date as a scientific experiment and dumped Lucas after he played the lab rat for her. Even though you can’t believe Emily would be capable of something so cruel—even parallel-universe Emily—he asks you to go talk with Bill and Mary to see if their relationship is better now. Bill tells you he and Mary nearly got divorced, but at the last moment their feelings did a complete one-eighty and now they’re happily in love once more. Meanwhile, Lucas discovers an encrypted message from the other Emily explaining everything. She dumped Lucas and made it seem as if she didn’t share his feelings because his and your presence in the other universe was starting to destroy it. Unfortunately, that means she and Lucas can never be together again, but Lucas’s view on love has changed for the better. He gives you a Gold Gift for helping him.\n\nRequirements: Daisy Supercupcake for Lucas, Shrikhand with Maple Syrup, Cardamom and Saffron for Lucas, Supercupcake with Espresso, Chocolate Syrup and Gold for Ron, Honey Milkshake with Tapioca, Cardamom and Rose for Lucas\n\nReward: Gold Gift from Lucas\n\nLevel 36[]\n\nRecipe for Success[]\n\nAnn tells you Cleo has been crying a lot lately. When you talk to the DJ, she tells you she was denied from performing at this year’s Rad Fest, the hottest party of the year, because she’s not popular enough. She wishes she was a superstar like her parallel-universe self, so she decides to copy the other Cleo and asks you to speak to Lucas for more information about her. For helping her out, Cleo says she’ll give you a Blue Gift.\n\nLucas has written an article studying the differences between the two universes, publishing it in Synchrophasotron Fun. He gives it to you to pass on to Cleo. Reading through it, Cleo discovers the following about parallel-universe Cleo: she was married to Ron, who is a professional basketball player in that universe, but they got divorced; she gained a lot of popularity after a scandal; her producer is Mike. The DJ tries to go on a date with Ron once again, but it ends horribly. She then tries to call Mike, but he’s too busy to even take her call. Left with no other choice, Cleo decides to create a scene and cause her own scandal. Unfortunately, Cleo’s “scene” involves yelling at a fan and a lot of people end up unfollowing her on Instagram. Seeing her so depressed, you offer to make her a Canelé with Vanilla and Saffron. She feels better, but is convinced that she’ll never become popular. As if to answer her prayers, Mike walks into the coffee shop. It looks like he’s left the Corporation and wants to make a brand new start as a producer—Cleo’s producer to be exact! He enlists the help of Clyde to make a song with Cleo and the country singer agrees.\n\nAlthough the song is topping all the music charts, it looks like nobody is talking about the music. The media misinterpreted a friendly hug between Cleo and Clyde as romantic, a scandal which was started by Mike himself and to which he says talent will only get Cleo so far. In Mike’s mind, music, a star-studded romance, and a scandal is a recipe for success. Cleo is adamant about killing the story, so Mike acquiesces to her wish only for the papers to now say Cleo dumped Clyde for Mike! The corporate monger changed the story to where Cleo isn’t dating Clyde anymore, just like she’d asked, but he says stopping the scandal entirely would have made Cleo’s popularity plummet. In exchange for 10 diamonds and to continue working to make Cleo a superstar, he asks you for a Canelé with Vanilla and Whipped Cream.\n\nCleo isn’t very happy, especially now that she’s being called the “Queen of Scandal” by the media and is on the verge of firing Mike, but her ire for her producer dissipates when she gets a call from Cream Hall, asking if she’ll perform in her own solo show. Mike says it was all thanks to the dessert you made him, with a little help from fate, a ton of newspapers, and a large print job of Cleo’s posters. Excited for her first rehearsal, Cleo is dismayed to find that Cream Hall is only interested in the Queen of Scandal, not Cleo herself, and wants her to do something outrageous during her performance: perform topless with a peacock on her head. She refuses to perform, but Mike is desperate—he owes a large debt to the Corporation and he was counting on Cleo’s success to help pay them back. When Cleo hears this, she asks you for a Canelé with Vanilla and Honey as she thinks over what to do with Mike. She comes up with a plan, but she needs help. Ask Felicia and Petrovich to join the team and they’ll agree to help her out.\n\nThe performance is a success and the fans loved Cleo’s music! She even fulfilled the ridiculous requirements from Cream Hall by exploiting some loopholes thanks to the help of Felicia and Petrovich. The event organizers can’t say a thing about Cleo’s performance since she technically did everything they asked. With the money she earned, she has just enough to pay off Mike’s debts and helps him out. It turns out they’re on the same page when Mike decides to stay and continue as Cleo’s producer. She gives you a Blue Gift for helping her achieve her dream!\n\nRequirements: Canelé with Vanilla and Saffron for Cleo, Canelé with Vanilla and Whipped Cream for Mike, Canelé with Vanilla and Honey for Cleo, Tea with Saffron, Galangal and Anise for Petrovich\n\nReward: Blue Gift from Cleo\n\nThe Universe of Our Love[]\n\nThe haunted house attraction Donald and Daisy based off of Bloody Penny has been lucrative, but Daisy is interested in breaking ground on a new quest and needs help thinking of the perfect theme. She needs you to talk to Lucas and Emily to see if they’ll help her. She promises to give you a Gold Gift to help her quest get off the ground. Lucas agrees after a little persuading and Emily is even more willing since it’ll look great for her work experience.\n\nDaisy’s first meeting with Lucas and Emily goes really well and she sees they make a great team together. They’ve even come up with a title: “The Universe of Our Love.” Lucas is in charge of working on the logic problems while Emily is finishing writing the script. She also tells you that she and Lucas are getting along really well.\n\nOn the first day working on Stage 1 of the quest, Emily gets a big surprise from Lucas: a cup of coffee and flowers! Lucas has also already finished Stage 1 on his own, but as Emily puzzled over the logarithm he came up with for more than an hour, she starts thinking they may need some new riddles that their customers will actually be able to figure out. Make her a Bahraini Coffee with Rose, Cardamom and Saffron for inspiration. Lucas’s pride takes a hit when Emily says his puzzle is too difficult and she asks you to speak with him, but the scientist is more worried about the results of his romance compatibility test than he is about his logarithm puzzle being rejected. It’s crucial Emily doesn’t find out about the tests or the results will be compromised, so he’s taken precautions and installed a defense system in your coffee shop that will sound off if anyone tries to tell Emily the truth. After your customers return to the coffee shop following the fake fire alarm, Emily tells you she’s come up with new riddles and wants to test them on you. Note: There is no penalty for incorrectly answering any of the riddles.\n\nIt belongs to you but is used by others. (Answer: Your name.)\n\nWhat kind of person can tame a rook? (Answer: A chess player.)\n\nIt’s always in front of us, but we can never see it. What is it? (Answer: The future.)\n\nStage 2 of the quest requires an engine, which Lucas said he would rummage around his lab for. It turns out he doesn’t have anything suitable to use and says Petrovich might have something. When you talk to the construction worker, he agrees to look in his father’s old garage for a Cupcake with Berries, Maple Syrup and Saffron. Petrovich returns with a carburetor he passes onto Lucas for the quest, but the latter says it won’t work; it will work, however, for his compatibility test. Emily takes apart the carburetor like a pro, but then puts it back together in the shape of a cute bunny to give to Lucas. The scientist returns the gesture by giving her a romantic playlist on a flash drive, but the playlist turns out to be a lecture about quasi-singularity and the expanding universe. Turns out, the lecturer’s surname is Romantik. Even though it’s not what Emily expected, she enjoys it all the same. On the quest side of things, she and Lucas decided putting a carburetor back together would be too difficult for their customers, so they need to come up with something new and asks you a new riddle.\n\nYou are given a table and Petrovich saws off one of its corners. How many corners does the table have now? (Answer: Five.)\n\nAfter giving your answer, Emily tells you to talk to Donald and see what his impression of Stage 2 is. The ex-mayor thinks they both did a great job, but the wow factor is missing, so Lucas makes comets to set against the backdrop of the Milky Way. Emily says they turned out great and she admits that she’s fallen head over heels for Lucas. She’s waiting until the quest is finished to tell him, but in the meantime they have some more work to do: Lucas is working on Stage 3, the flight to Earth, while Emily is organizing the picnic that awaits the loving couple at the end of the quest. She asks you for a Canelé with Whipped Cream and Forest Berries for the picnic.\n\nThe final stage of the quest involves testing the customers’ morals to see whether they’ve been turned into robots. Emily and Lucas’s answers are different from each other, but she accepts that and accepts him for who he is. Unfortunately, Lucas doesn’t feel the same way: Emily failed his compatibility test and now he’s shying away from talking to her about it. Since he’s completed his part of the quest, he wants you to tell Daisy his work is finished. Emily is confused upon hearing this, especially when there’s so much more testing to be done, and decides to get to the bottom of things by speaking with Lucas herself and straightening things out. However, on her way to speak with him, she bumps into Cleo who asks her to give Lucas the Synchrophasotron Fun back. While waiting for Lucas, she flips through the magazine and finds out how Lucas traveled to a parallel universe and fell in love with the scientist version of her there. She also sees the results of Lucas’s romantic compatibility test with her on his coffee table. Heartbroken and feeling used, she tells Lucas he’s dead to her and rushes out. When you speak with Lucas, he says for some reason he’s depressed despite wanting to break things off with Emily. As irrational to him as it is, it seems Lucas has fallen in love with Emily! He asks you to talk to your customers to see how they get rid of love sickness.\n\nHe goes with Daisy’s suggestion to continue working on the quest and in the process, perhaps work things out with Emily. But things end in disaster and Emily is nearly crushed to death by one of the comets on the set, saved at the last minute by Lucas who ended up going to the hospital. He only sustained minor injuries, but Emily was surprised that Lucas saved her. The scientist is wracking his brain trying to figure out why he did such an illogical thing, but he says he just had a strong and sudden urge to protect Emily at all costs. After everything they’ve been through and how he treated her, Lucas isn’t sure Emily even wants to speak with him. He needs a little courage and asks you for a Lassi with Honey, Saffron and Cardamom. When he speaks with Emily, he tells her how he feels and comes clean about everything. Emily thinks they might have a chance and admits she wouldn’t know what to do if she had been in his situation: in love with two different people in different universes.\n\nOn Emily’s behalf, you check to see how the quest is coming along despite all the drama that happened and Daisy happily tells you that the grand opening will happen the following day! True to her word, she gives you a Gold Gift for helping her.\n\nRequirements: Bahraini Coffee with Rose, Cardamom and Saffron for Emily, Cupcake with Berries, Maple Syrup and Saffron for Petrovich, Canelé with Whipped Cream and Forest Berries for Emily, Lassi with Honey, Saffron and Cardamom for Lucas\n\nReward: Gold Gift from Daisy\n\nLevel 37[]\n\nPulling Pigtails[]\n\nJennifer is at her wits' end with Mike strolling back into town and into her life when she's trying to prepare for the grand opening of the film studio. Mike isn’t faring much better. Apparently, Jennifer has been ordering Mike’s hotel room to be inspected, making it difficult for him to concentrate on shooting Cleo’s new music video. When you talk to him, he realizes Jennifer is the one behind everything and asks you for an “Eastern Star” Coffee with Cardamom to help him think. He decides to leave the hotel and move into a new place instead, which just so happens to be situated right next to Jennifer’s house. He’s determined to pay her back for the hotel fiasco.\n\nAt the film studio meeting, Jennifer and Mike butt heads over whether to put Cleo’s music video at the beginning or end of the opening ceremony. They end up making a bet: if Mike doesn’t get the video ready in a week, he’ll have to move away, but if he does manage to finish it, Cleo’s music video will be shown at the start of the ceremony and Jennifer will have to pick up trash around town. When you talk to the up and coming star, Cleo asks you to help Mike out.\n\nBefore filming can even begin on the music video, Mike, Cleo, and their whole crew get arrested under the pretense they were breaking-and-entering into the building. Jennifer was the one to call the cops and Watson had the unfortunate job of sorting everything out at the station, but the mayor got what she wanted: Mike and his team have been set back once again. As payback, Mike sends ufologists to Jennifer’s house the following night, and again the resident cop had to go and sort things out. When you speak with Watson, he says he’s too busy to deal with other people’s relationships and lets it slip that he and Olivia have taken the next step in their own relationship and moved in together.\n\nJennifer invites Mike over to her house and the music producer is confident it’s to propose a truce. When he gets there, however, he catches a glimpse of his yard from her window. He asks you for a Supercupcake with Nutmeg, Cardamom, Saffron and Salt before he calms down enough to tell you the details. An excavator appeared and started digging around the area after a tipoff there was some rare fossils to be found under Mike’s property. Watson, furious that their squabbling has intruded on his daytime life as well, warns them to stop, otherwise they’ll find themselves both in jail. Both Jennifer and Mike refuse to back down however, deciding they’ll just have to be a little more sneaky in how they go about things. Mike plans to plaster flyers about Jennifer cleaning the town all over her house and asks you to find out when Watson is going on shift. If you warn Watson about Mike’s plan, he’ll thank you for the tipoff, otherwise he’ll say that he hopes there’s no surprises in store tonight. When you talk to Mike and tell him Watson is about to start his shift, he’ll tell you he’s found a chest that he needs help opening. He wants to send it to an expert to open whose total fee is 1,000 diamonds, but if you chip in half he’ll give you some of the treasure. Note: Giving Mike the 499 diamonds is optional, but if you do, you will receive a Gold Gift in return.\n\nWhen Mike returns to the coffee shop, he as"
