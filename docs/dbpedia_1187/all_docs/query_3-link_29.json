        "text": "ROMANTIC COMEDY, by Curtis Sittenfeld\n\nAll straight women of a certain age were sold a trio of lies by romantic comedies — that love conquers differences, that we can have it all (whatever “all” is) and that perfect men fall from the sky just as our emotional acidity starts to become permanent.\n\nCurtis Sittenfeld’s latest novel, “Romantic Comedy,” is a love letter to the prototypical rom-com. Perhaps inevitably, it shares some concerns with her earlier books, most notably “Prep” (2005), which is about a teenage girl who is a new student at an elite private school, and “Rodham” (2020), an alternate story of Hillary Clinton’s life, had she decided not to marry Bill. So much of Sittenfeld’s work exists in the dissection and comprehension of female desire: what we want, what we absolutely don’t and, maybe paramount, what we’re even allowed to have.\n\nIn “Romantic Comedy,\" we’re studying Sally Milz, a sketch writer for a weekly live comedy show called “The Night Owls,” similar to “Saturday Night Live” in both format and tone. She’s in her late 30s, white, divorced, funny but embittered by her life’s many little heartbreaks. When Sally’s friend and mediocre-looking colleague Danny Horst starts dating a very famous and incredibly hot actress, she writes a sketch for the show called “The Danny Horst Rule”: Men from “T.N.O.” can date way out of their league, but the same isn’t true for the women working on the show. (This seems like a bit of a Pete Davidson/Ariana Grande caricature, if only for when Danny comments on his fiancée’s Instagram post, “love u my moon girl.”)\n\nAt just three chapters, “Romantic Comedy” is partly an extrapolation of a fascinating workplace and partly a contemporary romance novel. In some of the book’s most compelling passages, Sally talks about shedding her subconscious need for male approval at work: “I would never again risk poisoning ‘T.N.O.’ for myself by falling for or trying to date anyone there,” she says. “I began writing about ostensibly female topics — camel toe and wage inequity, polycystic ovary syndrome and Jane Austen, Do-si-dos and Trefoils and mammograms and shapewear and ‘Dirty Dancing’ and the so-called likability of female politicians.” Sally is clever but a little sad and, above all, she is drowning in male mediocrity: Less talented male writers are promoted above her, they’re respected in ways she isn’t and, finally, they’re sleeping with women well above their stations.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
