The man on the right was unidentified. Produced by the classic radio production team of Frank and Anne Hummert, They did other classic soaps, such as Ma Perkins and Just Plain Bill, as well as detective dramas like Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons. In the mid-1930s, the Hummerts had prolific writer Bob Andrews crafting Helen Trent, Just Plain Bill, Skippy and Judy and Jane and more each week - more than 35 installments!

The Romance of Helen Trent was a bastion of soap opera formula. First and foremost was the obvious theme of god and bad, joy and calamity, conscience and impulse. Melodrama is what the critics call it. Fans call it real life, if perhaps a little dramatic. But so listenable! Virginia Clark and then Julie Stevens played Helen for many years each. An honor role of radio actors played villains and friends alike, though sometimes it seemed they were both at the same time! Helen was schemed after by Hollywood moguls, directors, attorneys, oilmen, millionaire ranchers, world travelers, even a mad hypnotist!

But Gil Whitney was her abiding love for over 18 episodic years. Gil Whitney, a "brilliant and prominent attorney," became at one point a secret government agent. Then he was paralyzed in a train wreck. Finally, he married not Helen but her nemesis, Cynthia Swanson. Over the years, three actors including Marvin Miller played Gil.

Of course, the plots never let an uncertain emotion go unnoticed. Even death was a part of the show. In fact, the show ended with Helen waiting for the momentary return of her beloved on a balcony that suddenly collapses with a sickening crash! Silence. Then we hear Gil's plaintive voice, calling "Helen, it's Gil Helen!"
