Chkalov V P.

Soviet pilot, brigade commander. Hero of the Soviet Union (1936). From 1919 in the Red Army. He studied at the Yegorievsk military-theoretical school of pilots (1921-22), completed a full course at the Borisoglebsk school of military pilots (1922-23), studied at the Moscow military aviation school of aerobatics and at the same time graduated from the Serpukhov Higher

Aviation School of Shooting, Bombing and Air Combat (1923-24).

Pilot-

tester at the Research Institute of the Air Force (1930-33), the plant of experimental and experimental designs (1933-35). Chkalov tested over 70 types of aircraft (I-15, -16, -180, VIT-2, NV-1), developed and introduced new aerobatic maneuvers: an upward spin and a slow roll. Together with G.F. Baidukov and A.V. Belyakov he made flights: Moscow - about. Udd (now Father Chkalov), 1936; Moscow - North Pole - Vancouver (USA), 1937. Member of the USSR Supreme Council since 1937. Awarded 2 orders of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner, a medal.

He died on December 15, 1938 while testing the I-180-1 fighter. This was the first flight of a fighter designed by N.N. Polikarpov, which was supposed to replace the famous but aging I-16. The flight was prepared in a terrible hurry - to be in time before the end of the year. Polikarpov even refused to sign an act on the readiness of the aircraft for the first flight. That day there was a frost of 24 ° C. Already during the landing approach, the M-88 engine, which was not equipped with frontal blinds, was overcooled and, when trying to change its mode of operation, it stalled. Chkalov tried to make it to the airfield. But already on approach, seeing that the plane would not fly over residential barracks where there could be people, Chkalov turned away and crashed into a high-voltage support with its center section ... During the collision, the pilot was thrown out of the cockpit along with the steering wheel in a half-bent state. Falling, he hit his head on a protruding rail and broke his cerebellum. After 2 hours, he died in the Botkin hospital without regaining consciousness.

Probably, when calculating the landing approach, Chkalov did not take into account that the I-180, in contrast to the "donkey", was equipped with a VISH-3E variable-pitch propeller. Since the turning mechanism was not finished, the propeller blades were fixed in the small pitch position. And after the engine stopped, the propeller turned into a powerful brake... In addition, the landing gear, which could not be retracted during the first flight, were locked - Chkalov could not have retracted them.

As was later confirmed by the official tests of the M-88 engine on the machine in May 1939, it "does not have pickup from idle at its various thermal conditions." Those. when the engine control lever was quickly moved from idle (low speed) to an increase in speed (when gas was given), regardless of the temperature regime, the M-88 motor stopped.

The urn with the ashes of Chkalov is installed in the Kremlin wall. Cities in the Nizhny Novgorod region of Russia and the Khujansk region of Tajikistan, the Higher Aviation School of Pilots in Orenburg, the Central Aero Club, and aircraft factories in Tashkent and Novosibirsk are named after him. There is a Chkalov street in Canada, in Vancouver. The city of Orenburg from 1938 to 1957 bore the name of Chkalov (although Chkalov had never been here).

Grigory Yakovlevich Bakhchivandzhi

He was born on February 20, 1909 in the village of Brynkovskaya, Krasnodar Territory. In early childhood, the family moved to Zhdanov (now Mariupol).

"For the heroism and selflessness shown during the testing of the first Soviet aircraft with jet engines, posthumously award the title of Hero of the Soviet Union to test pilot Captain Bakhchivandzhi Grigory Yakovlevich." This is the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of April 28, 1973.

Grigory Bakhchivandzhi entered the Great Patriotic War with the Nazi invaders as part of the 402nd Special Purpose Fighter Aviation Regiment, formed from test pilots. In less than a month and a half, the brave pilot managed to make 65 sorties, while demonstrating exceptional courage and fearlessness, the highest art of combat. Gregory personally shot down 5 fascist vultures and participated in the destruction of five others along with his comrades.

In August 1941, the squadron commander Grigory Bakhchivandzhi was recalled to test work. At that time, the design bureau was creating a new type of interceptor aircraft - with a liquid-propellant jet engine. Grigory was entrusted to test this car.

And then the day came on May 15, 1942, which was destined to become the birthday of Soviet missile aviation. From the very morning, the designers, Grigory's comrades in aircraft testing, members of the state commission were anxiously waiting for the moment when it would be possible to allow take-off. Mechanics did not leave the car, again and again checking each unit. At 19 o'clock Moscow time, Bakhchivandzhi took the plane into the sky...

And after a certain time, Grigory Yakovlevich, as they say, gracefully landed the plane, and immediately fell into the arms of friends who congratulated him on a remarkable victory: the first manned flight on a rocket plane with a liquid-propellant jet engine. For this achievement, Grigory Bakhchivandzhi was awarded the highest government award - the Order of Lenin.

Then there were many more flights.

On March 27, 1943, during the next test, the pilot on the BI fighter developed a speed of more than 800 kilometers per hour. This was the first time a human had ever encountered a sound barrier. And the first victim on the way to overcoming it...

Grigory Bakhchivandzhi died at the age of 34. He died, paving the way for humanity into the new. The first conqueror of space, the USSR pilot-cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin noted: "Without the flight of Grigory Bakhchivandzhi, perhaps April 12, 1961 would not have happened."

Pilots, like the aircraft, are divided into military and civilian, their type of activity corresponds to this distinction. A pilot is one of the heroic professions, no matter what vehicle he uses to accomplish his deeds and feats - a helicopter or an airplane, the fact remains.

Perhaps, in our time, the images of heroes for boys and young people have changed, but it will never be superfluous to go back in time and look at the faces of real heroes. Read the article, learn about the exploits they accomplished, and at the same time get acquainted with the era in which the heroes lived, devoting their lives to people living at that time, and even today.

Scrolling through the pages of this chapter, you can get acquainted with many pilot-heroes who defended their homeland from enemies, received awards for this many times, in the form of orders and medals. By the way, samples of orders and medals can also be found in this section, they are shown at the end of the biography of the pilots.

Of course, the most active period for the birth of heroes is a war period and nothing can be done here, but sometimes there are pilots assigned to awards in peacetime, for example, for rescuing passengers.

It is thanks to such headings that we do not forget our history, we honor the people who have made a contribution to its positive outcome. So section ( Pilots heroes, pilots, military pilots) is shown below.

Hero pilots

The profession - a pilot - is not only romantic stories, singing it in songs, but hard work, daily risk and great responsibility. But still, every second boy dreams of becoming a pilot and taking his plane into the sky. And how can one not dream when there are examples of great people in this profession before my eyes. Many of them also once dreamed of becoming pilots, probably heroes of their country, receiving awards, medals, but the price of these awards is too high.

Each of them has the right to be named and recognizable, but there will not be enough runet space to give them all their due. But it is possible, in the person of several contemporaries, to recall every hero since the time of the first one who ascended into heaven.

At the end of the last century Sharpatov Vladimir- Pilot and crew commander of the Il-76 aircraft, has an award from the President for the courage and heroism shown by him during the escape from Afghanistan, where he and his team were prisoners for a whole year.

Vladimir Sharpatov received the "Hero of the Russian Federation" and the "Gold Star", the Hero of the Russian Federation was also his colleague at the helm Gazinur Khairullin, the co-pilot. His team - Navigator Zdora Alexander, flight radio operator Vshivtsev, leading engineers Butuzov Sergey, Ryazanov Viktor, flight engineer Abbyazov Askhat were awarded the Order of Courage for services to the fatherland.

Another legendary name of the pilot of the hero of Russia - Apakidze Timur- Honored Military Pilot of Russia, the first among naval aviation pilots to receive his Hero of Russia award. He died 12 years ago at the 85th anniversary of naval aviation, during parade performances. He was awarded the “Gold Star” of the Hero of the Russian Federation, the order of the third degree for service “For Service to the Motherland in the Armed Forces of the USSR” and “For Personal Courage”, the medal “For Military Merit”, the streets are named after him.

It would seem that the phrase pilots - heroes are forever associated with the war and in peacetime it simply has no place, but even today there are pilots who have received the title of honorary "Heroes of Russia. These are pilots who, in a difficult situation, thanks to impossible efforts, forgetting about themselves, acted in the interests of people's lives.

Every year there are more and more such heroes. On the one hand, this is, of course, fortunately - for those people who were on the plane at that time, and on the other hand, due to technical malfunctions of aircraft, heroism becomes somehow forced.

For example, in the Komi Republic, the Tu-154 winged car was obliged to make an emergency landing, and thanks to the pilots and the valiant team, none of the people were injured, although there were more than seventy passengers on board. Pilots Andrey Lamanov and Evgeny Novoselov, were awarded the titles of Heroes of Russia, and team members received the Order of Courage. Problems with on-board batteries led to this situation, the plane was supposed to make the journey from the Polyarny airport to the Moscow Domodedovo airport, but did not make it in time.

Unfortunately, the award does not find all pilots alive and in good health.

On June 23, 2012 last year, during the test work of the MiG-29KUB fighter, the pilots did not return home - heroes Alexander Kruzhalin and Oleg Matcha. They carried out the last tests in the Astrakhan region, for which they received the title of Hero of Russia, posthumously. They landed their last plane near the settlement, while not causing physical damage to a single living soul. Eternal memory to them.

And how many surviving pilots did not receive awards, who, thanks to their masculinity and high skill, landed planes in emergency situations. Or those pilots who struggled, but, unfortunately, could not help themselves or the passengers. There are not enough pages to list everyone and remember all the situations that, like a film, fly for years - .... 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 ... cities and surnames. Commander-captain Andrei Churbanov and pilot-operator senior lieutenant Oleg Tumakov died .... Not far from Itum-Kale, Hero of Russia lieutenant colonel died Yuri Nikolaevich Yakimenko and captain Oleg Anatolievich Podsitkov... The Su-17M3 aircraft crashed during testing, two pilots who tested it ... Pilot Dmitry Khrebtov died on training flights ...

There will be no end to the names of test pilots, at the cost of their lives they test the reliability of steel birds so that someone else, already on a more advanced model, has the opportunity not only to fly, but also to live. Unfortunately, after 2013 there will again be ellipsis...

Personalities in the world of aviation

1908-1984 Lyulka Arkhip Mikhailovich Leading scientist, aircraft engine designer 1911-1971

The twentieth century can safely be called the century of aviation. Man was able to become the master of the sky with the help of such aircraft as airplanes. A little over a hundred years have passed, and mankind has recognized many famous pilots. Someone went down in history by doing a lot for aeronautics from a scientific point of view, setting records, opening up new opportunities.

And there are pilots who made a name for themselves at the expense of two world wars. Such pilots became famous for shooting down dozens and even hundreds of enemy aircraft. In any case, the profession of a pilot has become romantic, and all thanks to its most famous representatives.

Wright brothers. Wilber (1867-1912) and Orville (1871-1948) Wright are considered the inventors of the world's first airplane. It is for these Americans in most countries that the priority of such a fateful invention is assigned. True, the championship is contested by Alberto Santos-Dumont. The device of the Wright brothers was not only able to take off, but also to carry out a controlled flight. For the first time, something heavier than air with an engine was in the air spaces. It happened on December 17, 1903. A couple of years later, the Wright brothers had already created the first aircraft in history that could be practically used. And even though the experimental aircraft of the Americans was not the first in history, it was these pilots who were the first to fly it. As a result, the aircraft industry took a truly first serious step. The fundamental discovery of the brothers was the discovery of three axes of rotation of the aircraft. This allowed the pilots to keep the balance of the apparatus during the flight and control the aircraft. It should be noted that this method has become the main one for controlling all types of aircraft, remaining so today. If in those days other testers focused on the installation of powerful motors, the Wright brothers were engaged in the study of the theory of flight and the principles of aircraft control. They conducted research with a wind tunnel, which made it possible to create more advanced wings and propellers. The inventors even received a patent for an aerodynamic control system, which was carried out using the surfaces of the aircraft. And the pilots got their technical knowledge by selling bicycles, printing mechanisms, engines and other equipment in their own store. Now the first planes of the Wright brothers are in museums, being a national monument of the United States. Although these pilots were more inventors, they were not afraid to be the first to sit at the helm of the technical means they created, which were unusual at that time.

Louis Blériot (1872-1936). As with the Wright brothers, this pilot was both an inventor and a businessman. Blériot was an engineer, from 1895 engaged in the production of lanterns. The general passion for aeronautics did not pass him by - the Frenchman first built an ornithopter, and then in 1907 his first airplane. In 1908, Blériot was able to witness the piloting skills of one of the Wright brothers, which shocked him. Another eyewitness, the English Lord Northcliffe, even set up a reward of one thousand pounds for the first person to cross the English Channel by plane. It was believed that Wilbur Wright would become the main competitor. However, he returned to the States, after an unsuccessful attempt by the Frenchman Hubert Latham, Louis Blériot accepted the challenge. On July 25, 1909, he took off, but halfway through the plane began to drift north. However, the pilot noticed a deviation from the route and was able to correct the course. After 37 minutes of flight, having overcome the path of 23 miles, Blériot landed in England. This victory had great consequences for the development of aircraft construction. The pilot himself became the first Frenchman to officially receive the title of pilot. Many believed that the design of the French monoplane is more promising than the biplanes of the Americans and the British. Blériot managed to collect many orders for the production of his aircraft. The pilot was not afraid to try and change the design, he made a record flight on his eleventh aircraft, while the Wright brothers brought their creation to perfection. During the First World War, the Blériot company produced more than 10 thousand cars, having served a lot for the fact that the planes became, though a weapon, but massive.

Pyotr Nesterov (1887-1914). In those days, flying aircraft was a very risky business. No one really knew the capabilities of the new tool, and its design itself left much to be desired. Pyotr Nesterov lived a bright and short life, having managed to show what airplanes are capable of. In 1910, an artillery officer became interested in aviation. In 1912, the lieutenant had already made his first solo flight. The very next year, Nesterov led the flight squad. It should be noted that this pilot also worked as a designer. In those days, the improvement of aircraft was common and sometimes even necessary. Nesterov himself modified his aircraft, developed new engines, and even planned to create a single-seat high-speed aircraft. The pilot, having knowledge in mechanics and mathematics, having experience in aerobatics, theoretically proved the possibility of performing deep turns, and then practically realizing it. It was the Russian pilot who in 1913 made a closed loop in the vertical plane. The era of aerobatics began with a dead loop (Nesterov's loop). On September 8, 1914, Pyotr Nesterov made his last flight. He tried to hit the landing gear of his aircraft on the wing of the enemy Albatross. However, the pilot miscalculated and his light Moran rammed the enemy from above. The collision proved fatal for all pilots. And Nesterov also went down in history as the first pilot to make a ram.

Manfred von Richthofen (1892-1918). With the outbreak of the First World War, the warring parties began to use a new weapon - aircraft. At first they were simply engaged in reconnaissance, but then fighters appeared. The most famous ace pilot of the First World War was the "Red Baron", Manfred von Richthofen. On his account there were 80 downed enemy aircraft. The legendary pilot met the beginning of the war in the cavalry. However, this kind of troops quickly got tired of him and in 1915 Richthofen transferred to aviation. At first he was engaged exclusively in intelligence. On September 17, 1916, the baron shot down the first enemy, ordering a cup on this occasion with an engraved date of the battle and the type of downed aircraft. As a result, Richthofen accumulated 60 such commemorative items. The pilot, like many of his colleagues, was rather superstitious. Before each flight, he received a kiss from his beloved, which even became a kind of tradition among other military pilots. In January 1917, Richthofen already had 16 downed cars on his account. He received the highest military award of the country - the order "Pour le Merite", he was entrusted with the leadership of the squadron "Jasta 11". His red-painted plane terrified the enemy. The "Jasta 11" included many German aces, including Ernst Udet. The group was located in tents, not far from the front line. For mobility, the squadron was even nicknamed the "air circus". The legendary pilot died on April 21, 1918, a bullet hit the Red Baron from the ground.

Charles Lindbergh (1902-1974). The First World War died down, the aircraft industry developed by leaps and bounds. Records followed one after another. In 1919, American businessman Raymond Orteig offered $25,000 to the first pilot to fly direct from New York to Paris. Many pilots tried to break the jackpot, but either interrupted the flight or died. Charles Lindbergh also decided to enter the competition. By that time, he already had his own plane, the experience of independent flights. Lindbergh found sponsors, specifically for his order, a company from San Diego released a single-engine monoplane. At the same time, the pilot himself took part in the design. The aircraft was named the "Spirit of St. Louis". The first serious test of it took place on May 10-11, 1927. Lindbergh flew from San Diego to New York in 20 hours, spending the night in St. Louis. And on May 20, a historic flight took place. Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Airfield in New York at 07:52 and arrived at Le Bourget at 17:21. For this feat, Charles Lindbergh received worldwide fame. The pilot was the first in the United States to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. To Lindbergh's credit, it is worth noting that he continued to popularize aviation. The pilot attracts investment in the research of Robert Goddard, a rocket science pioneer. At the request of the American authorities, Lindbergh visits Latin American countries. Together with his wife, the pilot travels around the world, drafting new routes for airlines. Lindbergh even took part in the development of an artificial heart. During the Second World War, the pilot was a military adviser and even managed to carry out about fifty sorties, at which time he was developing autopilot methods. In the post-war years, Lindberg became a general, he writes books, travels, is engaged in social activities, protecting nature.

Amelia Earhart (1897-1937). Over time, aviation began to attract women. One of the pioneers was Amelia Earhart, a brave writer who opened the way to heaven for the fairer sex. By 1920, Amelia received an excellent education, learned 4 languages. The fate of the girl changed when in 1920 she made her first flight as a passenger. Deciding to become a pilot, Amelia tried many professions to pay for her training. At the same time, she learned everything about aviation - from the theory of flight to the design of the motor. In the summer of 1921, Earhart bought her first aircraft, and in October 1922, he set his first world record by flying to a height of 4,300 meters. In the wake of the growing popularity of aviation, the name of the brave pilot became famous. In 1923, she received a license, becoming the 16th woman with such a document. After Lindbergh's flight across the Pacific, the time has come for women to prove that they are capable of it. A wealthy American, Amy Guest, raised funds, but she could not fly herself. Then the task was set - to find a bold and attractive pilot, who became Amelia Earhart. On June 17, 1928, together with two pilots, she flew from Newfoundland to Wales, though more as a passenger. Nevertheless, the pilot became world famous. She turned her fame to the fight for the rights of women, attracting them to traditionally male professions, including aviation. Earhart was at the forefront of commercial air travel, constantly traveling around the country lecturing. In 1929, Earhart helped create the organization of women pilots, becoming its first president. She masters heavy vehicles, setting a speed record of 197 miles per hour. In 1932, Earhart made a solo flight across the Atlantic, becoming the second person after Lindbergh to do so. This achievement brought the pilot world fame and many awards. By the mid-1930s, Earhart had become one of the most famous people in America. She is friends with the president's family, owns many air records, promotes flights. In 1937, Amelia decided to fly around the world, accompanied by navigator Fred Noonan. In the Central Pacific, near Howland Island, Amelia's plane went missing. The US Navy undertook a massive search operation, which became the most expensive in the history of the fleet. On January 5, 1939, the brave pilot was officially declared dead. Traces of the plane were never found, so the mystery of the disappearance of the crew has been preserved to this day.

Valery Chkalov (1904-1938). When Chkalov first saw the plane, he was 15 years old, and he worked as a fireman on a ship. After that, he achieved admission to a flight school, having learned aerobatics, shooting, bombing and air combat manners. In 1924, a military fighter pilot ended up in the Nesterov Leningrad Air Squadron. There Chkalov showed himself not only as a brave pilot, but also as audacious. For his risky stunts in the air, the pilot was repeatedly removed from practice by the management, and once even flew under a bridge. Chkalov's military career did not work out - either he was convicted of drunken fights, or his recklessness ended in accidents. Only at the request of the top leadership of the army, the pilot was not in prison, but in reserve. Since 1933, Chkalov moved to a new job - a test pilot at the Moscow Aviation Plant. Here, a lot of experimental machines passed through the hands of the pilot, he himself developed new aerobatics - an ascending spin and a slow roll. In 1935, pilots Chkalov, Baidukov and Belyakov proposed to the country's leadership to fly from the USSR to the USA via the North Pole. However, Stalin suggested first to overcome another route - from Moscow to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. For this successful flight in 1936, the entire crew was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Chkalov became a national hero. And in 1937, the same crew flew across the Arctic to Vancouver, Washington, under difficult conditions. The brave crew was welcomed by all of America, they were received by President Roosevelt. Chkalov became a people's deputy of the USSR, Stalin himself invited him to head the NKVD, but the pilot refused. On December 15, 1938, the test pilot died while flying on the new I-180 fighter.

Erich Alfred Hartmann (1922-1993). The Second World War gave rise to new hero pilots. And if Pokryshkin and Kozhedub were praised in the Soviet media, then the Western press certainly considered the German, Erich Hartmann, the best ace. Indeed, during his 1525 sorties, he managed to shoot down 352 aircraft, of which only 7 were not Soviet. Before the war, Hartmann flew gliders, joining the Luftwaffe in 1940. In 1942, he completed pilot courses and was sent to the Eastern Front. Erich proved to be an excellent sniper and diligent student, having managed to master his technique to perfection. Hartmann was lucky to get into the famous fighter squadron JG 52, where he was surrounded by famous aces. The young pilot quickly adopted the tactics of success. He did not seek to enter into an air carousel with enemy fighters, preferring to attack from an ambush. Hartmann paid special attention to the first blow. By October 1943, the ace already had 148 downed aircraft on his account, he had already managed to visit behind the front line, escape from there and receive a knight's cross. Such rapid success even forced the Luftwaffe headquarters to check the victories of the pilot, but they were all confirmed. On August 17, 1944, Hartmann overtook his comrade, Gerhard Barkhorn, in terms of the number of victories. And a week later, the number of downed aircraft was 300. For this, Hartmann was awarded the Diamond Knight's Cross. The legendary ace achieved his last victory already on May 8, 1945, after Germany signed the surrender. After the end of the war, the pilot ended up in Soviet captivity, where he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. In 1955, Hartmann was released ahead of schedule, he returned to Germany, where he trained pilots.

Ivan Kozhedub (1920-1991). Ivan Kozhedub managed to become the most famous Soviet ace of the Second World War. Like many Soviet youths, at the call of the state, the future pilot studied at the flying club. The war caught him as an instructor at the Chuguev aviation school. Constantly trying to go to the front, Kozhedub managed to sleep there only in March 1943. By that time, Soviet pilots had also accumulated combat experience, and aircraft became competitive. Only on July 6, 1943, during the fighting on the Kursk Bulge, during his fortieth sortie, Kozhedub shot down his first plane. On February 4, 1944, the pilot received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for 20 downed German aircraft. Already in August, the second Zvezda found him, by that time the ace had 48 downed enemy vehicles on his account. Unlike Hartmann, the Soviet pilot preferred to open fire from afar, without getting close to the enemy. Ivan Kozhedub met Pobeda in the rank of major, shooting down 62 aircraft. He himself was never hit. On August 18, 1945, the illustrious ace received his Third Star of the Hero. At the end of hostilities, Kozhedub continued to serve in aviation, he graduated from the Air Force Academy, and then the Academy of the General Staff. During the Korean War, Kozhedub was again at the front, this time as commander of an aviation division. In 1985, the famous pilot became an Air Marshal.

Marina Popovich (born 1931). In 1951, the girl graduated from an aviation technical school in Novosibirsk, becoming an instructor. The passion for flying turned out to be so all-consuming that Marina won the right to serve in the army in order to be able to fly jet fighters. Since 1960, Popovich began to pilot aircraft of this class, soon becoming the only female test 1st class. Marina even went as a candidate for astronauts. The pilot on the MiG-21 aircraft was the first woman to break the sound barrier. Over the past few years, she has managed to set 102 world records, such achievements have become work for her. These are records for the speed and range of various aircraft and their classes. At the same time, the woman set ten of her records at the wheel of the giant Antey aircraft. It is no coincidence that Marina Popovich is a member of the legendary American club "99". In total, the famous pilot mastered more than 40 types of aircraft, even a star in the constellation Cancer is named after her.

Before the attack on the USSR, the air forces of Nazi Germany did not consider Soviet pilots as serious opponents. In the Luftwaffe, it was generally accepted that only enemy air defense could create trouble for the German aces.

However, soon after the aggression, the Nazis had to radically change their attitude towards Soviet pilots. Our aviation gave the invaders such a rebuff that the Nazis did not meet anywhere else in Europe.

IVAN KOZHEDUB

Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub was born in the village of Obrazhievka, Glukhovsky district, Chernihiv province (now Shostka district, Sumy region of Ukraine). Kozhedub's first meeting with aviation began at the flying club of the chemical-technological technical school in the city of Shostka, where he entered after school. It was there in April 1939 that he made his first flight. The beauties of the native land, opened from a height of 1500 meters, made a strong impression on the young man and predetermined his whole future life. At the beginning of 1940, Kozhedub was admitted to the Chuguev Military Aviation School. According to the recollections of classmates, he flew a lot, often experimented, honing his piloting skills and adored the theory of aircraft construction. The skills acquired during his studies were later very useful to Kozhedub: according to his comrades, he knew the fighting machine better than his own five fingers. Throughout the war, the pilot was never shot down, even a badly damaged fighter, risking his life, he always returned to the airfield. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, Kozhedub continued his studies, in 1949 he graduated with honors from the Red Banner Air Force Academy. Strong knowledge and rich experience of the pilot very soon found their application. In 1951–52 Kozhedub during the war in Korea commanded an entire aviation division, his falcons shot down 258 enemy aircraft in that conflict.

ALEXANDER POKRYSHKIN

Alexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin was born in Novonikolaevsk (now Novosibirsk). He became interested in aviation at the age of 12 when he saw airplanes flying in the sky. Subsequently, Pokryshkin entered the 3rd Military School of Aircraft Technicians, and at the end of 1934 he became a senior aircraft engineer of the 74th Taman Rifle Division. However, in order to become not an aircraft technician, but a pilot, Pokryshkin had to go a long and difficult path. To get this profession, he persistently studied the history of flights and military history, physics and mathematics, physiology and descriptive geometry for four years. Pokryshkin wrote 39 reports to the commanders with a request to let him go to the flight school, but each time he was refused. The situation did not suit the young man at all, and in September 1938, during his next vacation in seventeen days, he mastered the two-year program of the Krasnodar flying club and externally with excellent marks passed the exam. Finally, in his 40th report, he enclosed a certificate of graduation from the flying club and already in November 1938 he became a student at the Kachin Military Aviation School. A year later, he graduated with honors, now becoming a pilot. The educational path covered was worth it: already in 1941, having been known as a virtuoso in flight, Senior Lieutenant Pokryshkin was appointed deputy squadron commander. There is a common legend that, having received information about the approach of this pilot's fighter, the Germans began to send urgent messages to each other: “Achtung, Achtung! Pokryshkin is in the sky!

NIKOLAY GULAYEV

Nikolai Dmitrievich Gulaev was born in the village of Aksayskaya (now the city of Aksay, Rostov Region). He graduated from the 7th grade of an incomplete secondary school and the FZU school, in the evenings he studied at the flying club. This passion helped him in 1938, when Gulaev was drafted into the army. The amateur pilot was sent to the Stalingrad Aviation School, from which he graduated in 1940. During the war, Gulaev had a reputation as a daredevil. In August 1942, an incident happened to him, which showed both courage and a certain willfulness of his character. The young pilot did not have a permit for night flights, and when on August 3, 1942, Hitler's planes appeared in the area of ​​\u200b\u200bresponsibility of the regiment where Gulaev served, experienced pilots went into the sky. Gulaev also flew with them, who decided to prove that he was no worse "old people". As a result, in the first battle, without experience, without the help of searchlights, a German bomber was destroyed. When Gulaev returned to the airfield, the general who arrived said: “For the fact that I flew out without permission, I announce a reprimand, but for the fact that I shot down an enemy plane, I increase my rank and present for a reward.”

GRIGORY RECHKALOV

Grigory Andreevich Rechkalov was born in the village of Khudyakovo, Irbitsky district, Perm province (now the village of Zaikovo, Irbitsky district, Sverdlovsk region). He got acquainted with aviation while studying in the circle of glider pilots at the factory school of the Verkh-Isetsky plant in Sverdovsk. In 1937, he entered the Perm Military Pilot School and subsequently graduated with success. In 1939, with the rank of sergeant, he was enrolled in the 55th Aviation Fighter Regiment in Kirovograd. Perseverance was the main feature of Rechkalov. Despite the fact that the medical board determined that the pilot had color blindness, he won the right to continue his service and in 1941 was sent to the 55th Fighter Aviation Regiment. According to colleagues, Rechkalov had a rather uneven character. Showing a model of discipline in one flight, in the next he could be distracted from the main task and just as resolutely begin the pursuit of a random enemy.

KIRILL EVSTIGNEEV

Kirill Alekseevich Evstigneev was born in the village of Khokhly, Ptichensky volost, Chelyabinsk district, Orenburg province (now the village of Khokhly, Kushmyansky village council, Shumikhinsky district, Kurgan region). According to the recollections of his fellow villagers, he grew up as a strong and very hardy boy. Evstigneev combined classes at the flying club with work at the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. He later graduated from the Burmese Military Pilot School. Observing the light and precise cascade of figures performed by him in the air, it was difficult to assume that Evstigneev was suffering from an ailment, having which it was forbidden to serve in aviation - a peptic ulcer. However, like another ace pilot Rechkalov, Estigneev persisted and ensured that he was left in the service. The skill of the pilot was so high that, according to the stories of colleagues, he could land a fighter on one wheel or on a narrow path cleared of snow between two meter-long ice barriers.

Our aces pilots during the Great Patriotic War terrified the Germans. The exclamation "Akhtung! Akhtung! Pokryshkin is in the sky!" became widely known. But Alexander Pokryshkin was not the only Soviet ace. We remembered the most productive.

Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub

Ivan Kozhedub was born in 1920 in the Chernigov province. He is considered the most successful Russian fighter pilot in personal combat, with 64 aircraft shot down. The beginning of the career of the famous pilot was unsuccessful, in the very first battle his plane was seriously damaged by the enemy Messerschmit, and when returning to the base, Russian anti-aircraft gunners fired on him by mistake, and only by a miracle did he manage to land. The plane was not subject to restoration, and they even wanted to retrain the unlucky newcomer, but the regiment commander stood up for him. Only during his 40th sortie on the Kursk Bulge, Kozhedub, having already become a “batya” - deputy squadron commander, shot down his first “lappet”, as ours called the German Junkers. After that, the score went to tens.

The last battle in the Great Patriotic War, in which he shot down 2 FW-190s, Kozhedub fought in the sky over Berlin. In addition, Kozhedub also has two American Mustang aircraft shot down in 1945, which attacked him, mistaking his fighter for a German aircraft. The Soviet ace acted on the principle that he professed even when working with cadets - "any unknown aircraft is an enemy." Throughout the war, Kozhedub was never shot down, although often his plane received very serious damage.

Alexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin

Pokryshkin is one of the most famous aces of Russian aviation. Born in 1913 in Novosibirsk. He won his first victory on the second day of the war, shooting down the German Messerschmitt. In total, he accounted for 59 personally shot down aircraft and 6 in the group. However, this is only official statistics, because, being the commander of an air regiment, and then an air division, Pokryshkin sometimes gave downed planes to young pilots in order to encourage them in this way.

His notebook, entitled "Fighter Tactics in Combat", became a real guide to air warfare. They say that the Germans warned about the appearance of a Russian ace with the phrase: “Akhtung! Achtung! Pokryshkin in the air. The one who knocked down Pokryshkin was promised a big reward, but the Russian pilot turned out to be too tough for the Germans. Pokryshkin is considered the inventor of the "Kuban whatnot" - a tactical method of air combat, the Germans called him the "Kuban escalator", since the planes arranged in pairs resembled a giant staircase. In battle, German aircraft leaving the first stage were hit by the second, and then the third stage. His other favorite tricks were "falcon strike" and "high-speed" swing ". It is worth noting that Pokryshkin won most of his victories in the early years of the war, when the Germans had a significant air superiority.

Nikolai Dmitrievich Gulaev

Born in 1918 in the village of Aksayskaya near Rostov. His first battle is reminiscent of the feat of the Grasshopper from the movie “Only Old Men Go to Battle”: without an order, for the first time in his life, taking off at night under the howl of an air raid on his Yak, he managed to shoot down a German Heinkel night fighter. For such arbitrariness, he was punished, while presenting him for a reward.

In the future, Gulaev was usually not limited to one downed aircraft per flight, he scored four victories three times a day, destroyed three aircraft twice, and made a double in seven battles. In total, he shot down 57 aircraft personally and 3 in the group. One enemy aircraft Gulaev, when he ran out of ammunition, took to ram, after which he himself fell into a tailspin and barely managed to eject. His risky manner of fighting became a symbol of the romantic trend in the art of aerial duel.

Grigory Andreevich Rechkalov

Born in 1920 in the Perm province. On the eve of the war, at the medical flight commission, he was found to have a slight degree of color blindness, but the regiment commander did not even look at the medical report - the pilots were very needed. He won his first victory on an outdated I-153 biplane number 13, unlucky for the Germans, as he joked. Then he got into Pokryshkin’s group and was trained on the Aerocobra, an American fighter, which became famous for its tough temper - it very easily went into a tailspin at the slightest pilot error, the Americans themselves were reluctant to fly on such. In total, he shot down 56 aircraft personally and 6 in the group. Perhaps none of our other ace on a personal account has such a variety of types of downed aircraft as Rechkalov, these are bombers, and attack aircraft, and reconnaissance aircraft, and fighters, and transport workers, and relatively rare trophies - "Savoy" and PZL -24.

Georgy Dmitrievich Kostylev

Born in Oranienbaum, now Lomonosov, in 1914. He began flying practice in Moscow at the legendary Tushino airfield, where the Spartak stadium is now being built. The legendary Baltic ace, who covered the sky over Leningrad, won the largest number of victories in naval aviation, personally shot down at least 20 enemy aircraft and 34 in a group.

He shot down his first Messerschmitt on July 15, 1941. He fought on a British Hurricane received under lend-lease, on the left side of which there was a large inscription "For Russia!". In February 1943, he landed in a penal battalion for having arranged a rout in the house of a major of the commissary service. Kostylev was struck by the abundance of dishes with which he regaled his guests, and could not restrain himself, because he knew firsthand what was happening in the besieged city. He was deprived of awards, demoted to the Red Army and sent to the Oranienbaum bridgehead, to the places where he spent his childhood. The prisoner saved the hero, and already in April he again lifts his fighter into the air and defeats the enemy. Later he was reinstated in the rank, the awards were returned, but he never received the second Star of the Hero.

Maresyev Alexey Petrovich

A legendary man who became the prototype of the hero of Boris Polevoy's story "The Tale of a Real Man", a symbol of the courage and stamina of the Russian warrior. Born in 1916 in the city of Kamyshin, Saratov province. In a battle with the Germans, his plane was shot down, the pilot, wounded in the legs, managed to land on the territory occupied by the Germans. After that, for 18 days he crawled out to his own, in the hospital both legs were amputated. But Maresyev managed to return to duty, he learned to walk on prostheses and again took to the skies. At first, they did not trust him, anything can happen in battle, but Maresyev proved that he can fight no worse than others. As a result, 7 more German aircraft were added to the 4 German aircraft shot down before being wounded. Polevoy's story about Maresyev was allowed to be printed only after the war, so that the Germans, God forbid, would not think that there was no one to fight in the Soviet army, they had to send invalids.

Popkov Vitaly Ivanovich

This pilot also cannot be ignored, because it was he who became one of the most famous incarnations of an ace pilot in cinema art - the prototype of the famous Maestro from the film “Only Old Men Go to Battle”. The "Singing Squadron" really existed in the 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, where Popkov served, it had its own choir, and Leonid Utyosov himself presented two aircraft to it.

Popkov was born in Moscow in 1922. He won his first victory in June 1942 over the city of Holm. Participated in battles on the Kalinin front, on the Don and the Kursk Bulge. In total, he made 475 sorties, conducted 117 air battles, personally shot down 41 enemy aircraft plus 1 in the group. On the last day of the war, Popkov shot down the legendary German Hartman, the most productive ace of World War II, in the sky over Brno, but he managed to land and stay alive, however, this still did not save him from captivity. Popkov's popularity was so great that a monument was erected to him during his lifetime in Moscow.
