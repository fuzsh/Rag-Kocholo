        "text": "Just thought I would scope out Wikipedia and see what it has on WWII aircraft starting with the graceful He-111\n\nType: Medium bomber\n\nManufacturer: Heinkel Flugzeugwerke\n\nDesigned by: Siegfried and Walter Günter\n\nMaiden flight: 24 February1935\n\nIntroduced: 1936\n\nRetired: 1945\n\nPrimary user: Luftwaffe\n\nProduced: 1935–1944\n\nNumber built: 7,300 estimated\n\nVariants: CASA 2.111\n\nThe Heinkel He 111 was the primary Luftwaffe medium bomber during the early stages of World War II, and is perhaps the most famous symbol of the German side of the Battle of Britain. By the time of that conflict, in 1940, the He 111 was nearing obsolescence. Nonetheless, it was produced until 1944, and used increasingly in the transport and re-supply role.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early 1930s Ernst Heinkel decided to build the world's fastest passenger plane, a lofty goal met with more than a little skepticism by the German aircraft industry and its newly evolving political leadership. Heinkel entrusted the development to the Günter brothers fairly new to the company and untested.\n\nThe aircraft was superior to the already fast Lockheed 9 Orion that their design was competing against. The first example of their soon-to-be-famous Heinkel He 70 Blitz (“Lightning”) rolled off the line in 1932 and immediately started breaking records. In its normal four passenger version its speed almost reach 200 mph (320 km/h), even though it was powered by only a single 600 hp (447 kW) BMW V1 engine. The elliptical wing, which the Günther brothers had already used in the Bäumer Sausewind sports plane before they joined Heinkel, became a feature in many subsequent designs the brothers developed.\n\nThe design immediately garnered the interest of the Luftwaffe, which was looking for medium bombers for military service.\n\nThe future Heinkel He 111 was a more powerful twin-engine version of the Blitz, producing an aircraft that had many of the Blitz's features—including its elliptical inverted gull wing, small rounded control surfaces, and BMW engines. With location of the engines the only notable change in appearance, the new He 111 design was often called the Doppel-Blitz (“Double Lightning”).\n\nEarly Variants\n\nThe first prototype, He 111 V1 (W.Nr. 713, D-ADAP), first flew from Rostock-Marienehe on 24 February1935. It was followed by the civilian-equipped V2 and V4 in May 1935. The V2 (W.Nr. 715, D-ALIX) used the bomb bay as a four-seat \"smoking compartment\" with another six seats behind it in the rear fuselage. V2 entered service with Lufthansa in 1936, along with five newly built versions known as the He 111 C. The design was only masquerading as an airliner. The aircraft was intended to be a bomber as the Luftwaffe began rearmament. The initial reports from the test pilot, Gerhard Nitschke, were favourable. It flight performance and handling were impressive although it dropped its wing in the stall. As a result the passenger variants had their wings reduced from 25 to 23 metres. The military aircraft, the V1, V3 and V5 spanned just 22.6 metres.\n\nThe first prototypes were underpowered, as they were powered only by 578hp BMW VI 6.0 six-cylinder in-line engines. This was eventually increased to 999 hp with the fitting of the DB (Daimler-Benz)600 engines into the V5, which became the prototype of the \"B\" series.\n\nOnly ten He 111 A-0 models based on the V3 were built, but they proved to be underpowered and were eventually sold to China. The first He 111B made its maiden flight in the autumn of 1936. After improvements the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM—Air Ministry) ordered 300 He 111B-1s; the first were delivered in January 1937. The B-2 variant had its engines upgraded to the supercharged DB 600C, of 850 hp or in some cases the 600G, of 925 hp. The B-2 began to roll off the production lines at the Heinkel works in Oranienburg in 1937. In late 1937 the D-1 series entered production. However the DB600Ga engine with 1,074 hp, planned for this variant, was instead allocated to the Bf 109 and Bf 110 production lines. Heinkel then opted to use Jumo engines, and the He 111 V6 was tested with Juno 210 G engines but was vastly underpowered. However the improved 999 hp Juno 211 A-1 powerplant prompted the cancellation of the D series altogether and concentration on the design of the E series.\n\nHe 111 E\n\nThe E-1s came off the production line in February 1938, and a number of these aircraft served in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938. In a way the positive performance influenced later variants. The Luftwaffe believed that because the E variant outran enemy fighters there was no need to upgrade defensive weaponry, which would prove a mistake from the Battle of Britain onward. The fuselage bomb bay used four bomb racks, in later versions eight modular standard bomb racks designed to carry one SC 250, 250 kg bomb or four SC50, 50 kg bombs each in nose up orientation (which resulted in the bombs' doing a flip as they were dropped out of the aircraft). These modular standard bomb racks were a common feature on the first generation of Luftwaffe bombers (including the Junkers Ju 52), but it turned out that they limited the ordnance selection to bombs of only two sizes. Since they had to be built strongly enough to carry heavy bombs without contributing to the structural integrity of the aircraft, these racks were abandoned in later designs. The E-3 series was produced with only a few modifications, such as external bomb racks. The bomb bay was reduced on the E-5 to make way for fuel tanks which increased its range.\n\nThe He 111 design quickly ran though a series of minor design versions to fix one sort of problem or another. One of the more obvious changes started with the He 111 F models, which moved from the elliptical wing to one with straight leading and trailing edges, which could be manufactured more efficiently. The F-1 Series was entirely exported to Turkey and the 40 F-4s entered Luftwaffe service. At this time development began on the He 111J. It was powered by the DB 600 and was intended as a torpedo bomber. As a result it lacked an internal bomb bay and carried two external torpedo racks.\n\nThe RLM gave an order for the bomb bay to be retrofitted; this variant became known as the J-1. In all but powerplant it was identical to the F-4.\n\nThe He 111 P incorporated the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601 and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric Ikaria nose mounting for an MG 15 machine gun, that replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with a roomier and aerodynamically favourable glazed \"dome\" over the front of the aircraft. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475 km/h at 5000 m and a cruise speed of 370 km/h, although a full bombload reduced this figure to 300 km/h. The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.\n\nAfter World War II, however, British Royal Navy test pilot Eric \"Winkle\" Brown, who had flown a number of captured later model He 111s, described the view through the redesigned nose as comparable to \"looking down a glass tunnel.\" The pilot's seat could actually be elevated close enough to the level of the upper glazing, complete with a small pivoted windscreen panel, to get the pilot's head above the level of the top of the \"glass tunnel\" for a better forward view for take-offs and landings. Eric Brown remarked that this was sort of a \"Tiger Moth\" transformation (referring to the famous British training biplane's open cockpits and windscreens) to such an advanced bomber's pilot accommodation.\n\nMany of the He 111 Ps served during the Polish Campaign. With the Junkers Ju 88experiencing technical difficulties, the He 111 and the Dornier Do 17 formed the backbone of the Kampfwaffe. On 1 September1939 Luftwaffe records indicate the Heinkel strength at 705 (along with 533 Dorniers).\n\nIn 1940 the RLM abandoned further production of the P series in favour of the H versions, mostly because the P-series' Daimler-Benz engines were sorely needed for Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighter production.\n\nHe 111 H\n\nThe H variant of the He 111 series saw more action during the Second World War than any other. Owing to the uncertainty surrounding the delivery and availability of the DB 601 engines, Heinkel began tests with the 1,100 hp (820 kW) Junkers Jumo 211 powerplants. The somewhat larger size and greater weight of the Jumo 211 engines were unimportant considerations for a twin engine design, and the Jumo was used on almost all early-war bomber designs. When the Jumo was fitted to the P model it became the He 111 H.\n\nThe P-series was gradually replaced on the eve of war with the new the H-2, powered by Jumo 211 A-3 engines. A count on2 September1939 revealed that the Luftwaffe had a total of 787 He 111s in service, with 705 combat ready, including 400 H-1 and H-2s that had been produced in a mere four months. Production of the H-3, powered by the 1,200 hp Jumo 211 D-1, began in November 1939. After the Battle of Britain a smaller scale production of the H-4s began. This variant differed from the H-3 in that could either carry 2.000 kg of bombs internally or mount one or two external racks to carry one 1.800 kg or two 1.000 kg bombs. As these external racks blocked the internal bomb bay doors a combination of internal and external storage was not possible. The H-5 series followed in February 1941, with heavier defensive armament. Some H-3 and H-4s were equipped with barrage balloon cable cutting equipment in the shape of cutter installations forward of the engines and cockpit. They were designated H-8, but later named H8/R2.\n\nThese aircraft were difficult to fly and the production stopped.The H-6 initiated some all around improvements in design. The Jumo 211 F-1 engine of 1,350 hp increased its speed while the defensive armament was upgraded with one MG FF in the nose position, one MG 15 in the ventral turret and in each of the fuselage side windows (optional). Some H-6 variants carried tail-mounted MG 17 defensive armament. With the H-11 the Luftwaffe had at its disposal a powerful medium bomber with heavier armour and defensive armament.\n\nOne of the most interesting variants was as a glider tug, the He 111 Z, standing for Zwilling or twin. It was built from two 111 H-6s joined together with a connecting wing and a fifth engine and used to tow the giant Messerschmitt Me 321 or two Gotha Go 242 gliders. Ten He 111 Zs were built, and all served until destroyed one way or another.\n\nAt 14,000 kg take-off weight (carrying 2,000 kg of bombs internally), the He 111H achieved a top speed of 405 km/h at 6 km, improving to 435 km/h without the bomb load and at 50% fuel load. Still, this was considerably slower than the newer Junkers Ju 88 which entered service in 1940, so the He 111 was gradually withdrawn from the bomber role. The He 111 became a jack-of-all-trades as the war progressed, carrying out missions not even imagined even when the war started.\n\nNevertheless, the He 111 had to be kept in production until 1944 because the RLM failed to provide a successor: the He 177 Greif heavy bomber was plagued by engine problems, and the Bomber B program was eventually abandoned. The vast majority of the 7,300 He 111s produced would be the H models, largely identical to the first H introduced in 1939.\n\nHe 111 variants\n\nHe 111 A-0: 10 aircraft built based on He 111 V3, two

Although its mid-engine placement was innovative, the P-39 design was handicapped by the lack of an efficient turbo-supercharger, limiting it to low-altitude work, although the type was used with great success by the Soviet Air Force. Together with the derivativeP-63 Kingcobra, these aircraft would be the most successful mass-produced, fixed-wing aircraft manufactured by Bell.\n\nDesign and development\n\nIn 1937, the United States Army Air Corps issued a specification for a new fighter via Circular Proposal X-608. It was a request for a high-altitude interceptor aircraft having \"the tactical mission of interception and attack of hostile aircraft at high altitude\". Specifications called for a maximum airspeed of at least 360 miles per hour (580 km/h) at altitude, and a climb to 20,000 feet (6100m) within 6 minutes; the toughest set of specifications USAAC had presented to that date. Other competing designs included the Curtiss P-40, an outgrowth of a previous design, and the Lockheed P-38, which utilized a complex twin-engine twin boom configuration. Although Bell's limited fighter design work had previously resulted in the unusual Bell YFM-1 Airacuda, the Model 12 proposal adopted an equally original configuration with an Allison V-12 engine mounted in the middle of the fuselage, just behind the cockpit, and a propeller driven by a shaft passing beneath the pilot's feet under the cockpit floor.\n\nThe main purpose of this configuration was to free up space for the heavy main armament, a 37 mm Oldsmobile T9 cannon firing through the center of the propeller hub for optimum accuracy and stability when firing. In fact, the entire design was made to accommodate this gun in the aircraft. This happened because H.M. Poyer, designer for project leader Robert Woods, was impressed by the power of this weapon and he pressed for its incorporation though the original concept had been a 20-25 mm cannon mounted in a conventional manner in the nose. This was unusual, because fighters had previously been designed around an engine, not a weapon system. Although devastating when it worked, the T9 had very limited ammunition, a low rate of fire, and was prone to jamming.\n\nA secondary benefit of the mid-engine arrangement was to create a smooth and streamlined nose profile. The weight distribution necessitated a tricycle undercarriage, a first among American fighters, though the Lockheed XP-38 was concurrently designed with tricycle landing gear. Entry to the cockpit was through side doors (mounted on both sides of the cockpit) rather than a sliding canopy. Its unusual engine location and the long driveshaft caused some pilot concern at first, but experience showed this was no more of a hazard in a crash landing than with an engine located forward of the cockpit. There were no problems with propshaft failure. As originally designed, the XP-39 had a turbocharger with a belly scoop (a feature shared by the XP-40); both were deleted for production.\n\nThe XP-39 made her maiden flight on 6 April 1938 at Wright Field, Ohio, achieving 630 km/h at 6100 m (390 mph at 20000 ft), reaching this altitude in only five minutes. The Army ordered twelve YP-39s for service evaluation and one YP-39A with the turbo-supercharger deleted. After these trials were complete, which resulted in detail changes including deletion of the external radiator, and on advice from NACA, the prototype was modified as the XP-39B; after demonstrating a performance improvement, the thirteen YP-39s were completed to this standard, adding two 0.3\" (7.62 mm) MG to the two .50s as well. Lacking armor or self-sealing fuel tanks, the prototype was 900 kg lighter than the production fighters.\n\nAfter completing service trials, and originally designated P-45, a first order for 80 aircraft was placed 10 August 1939; the designation would revert before deliveries began.\n\nTechnical details\n\nThe P-39 was an all-metal, low-wing, single-engine fighter, with tricycle undercarriage incorporating a very streamlined and aerodynamically efficient design.\n\nThe Airacobra was conceived with the T9 gun in mind. This weapon fired a 610 gram projectile capable of piercing 2 cm (.78\") of armor at 450 m (500yd) with armor piercing rounds. The complete armament fit as designed consisted of the T9 with a pair of Browning M2 .50\" (12.7 mm) machineguns mounted in the nose. This would change to two .50s and two .30s in the XP-39B (P-39C, Model 13, the first 20 delivered) and 2x0.50 and 4x0.30 (all four in the wings) in the P-39D (Model 15), which also introduced self-sealing tanks and shackles (and piping) for a 500pd (227 kg) bomb or drop tank. The engine was placed behind the cockpit, so pilots often referred to this as \"Allison armor.\" A long transmission tunnel passed through the fuselage, under the cockpit, and was linked to the three bladed propeller. The radiator was located in the fuselage.\n\nIn September 1940, Britain ordered 386 P-39Ds (as the Model 14), of 675 in all, differing in the 37 mm being replaced by a 20 mm Hispano and the 6x0.3 by .303 (7.7 mm). These began equipping 601 Squadron in September 1941, and were promptly recognized as having inadequate rate of climb and performance at altitude; only 80 joined the RAF (only 601 being outfitted), over 250 being transferred to the Red Air Force, about 200 repossessed by the Army after Pearl Harbor, and some 200 sent to Eighth Air Force in 1942 (the Army models being designated P-400).\n\nBecause of the unconventional layout, there was no space in the fuselage to place a fuel tank. Although drop tanks were implemented to extend its range, the standard fuel load was carried in the wings, with the result that the P-39 was limited to short range tactical strikes.\n\nA heavy structure, and around 120 kg of armor were characteristic of this aircraft as well. The production P-39's heavier weight combined with the poor performance of the Allison engine, limited the high-altitude capabilities of the fighter. The P-39's altitude performance was markedly inferior to the contemporary European fighters and, as a result, the first USAAF fighter units in the European Theater were equipped with the Spitfire V. However, the P-39D's roll rate was 75 degrees per second at 235 mph (378 km/h)– better than the A6M2, F4F, F6F, or P-38 up to 265 mph (426 km/h). see NACA chart).\n\nAbove the V-1710's full throttle height of about 17,000 ft (5,000 m), the P-39's performance dropped off rapidly. This limited its usefulness in traditional fighter missions in Europe as well as in the Pacific, where it was not uncommon for Japanese bombers to attack at altitudes above the P-39's operational ceiling (which in the tropical hot air inevitably was lower than in moderate climates).\n\nThe weight distribution of the P-39 supposedly is the reason for its tendency to enter a dangerous flat spin — a characteristic Soviet test pilots were able to demonstrate to the skeptical manufacturer who had been unable to reproduce the effect. After extensive tests, it was determined the spin could only be induced if the plane was improperly loaded, with no ammunition in the front compartment. The flight manual specifically noted a need to ballast the front ammunition compartment with the appropriate weight of shell casings to achieve a reasonable center of gravity. High speed controls were light thus high speed turns and pull-outs were possible although the P-39 had to be held in a dive since it tended to level out, reminiscent of the Spitfire. Redline dive speed was a respectable 525 mph (845 km/h) for the P-39.\n\nThe rear-mounted engine made the aircraft ideal for ground attack since fire would be coming from the front-bottom quarter and was less likely to hit the engine and its cooling systems. However, the arrangement proved to be very vulnerable to attacks from above and behind and nearly any hit on the fuselage from an attacking enemy fighter was virtually guaranteed to disable the cooling system and lead to the prompt demise of the engine and thus the airplane. Coupled with lack of high-altitude performance, the Airacobra was extremely vulnerable to any enemy fighter with decent high altitude performance.\n\nA naval version with tail-dragger landing gear, the XFL-1 Airabonita, was ordered as a competitor to the F4U Corsair and XF5F Skyrocket. It first flew 13 May 1940, but after a troublesome and protracted development and testing period, it was rejected.\n\nBy the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, nearly 600 had been built. When P-39 production ended in August 1944, Bell had built 9,558 and Airacobras, of which 4,773 (mostly -39N and -39Q) were sent to the Soviet Union through the Lend-Lease program. There were numerous minor variations in engine, propellor, and armament, but no major structural changes in production types, excepting a few two-seat TP-39F and RP-39Q trainers. In addition, seven went to the U.S. Navy as radio-controlled drones.\n\nTrials of a laminar flow wing (in the XP-39E) and Continental IV-1430 engine (the P-76) were unsuccessful. The mid-engine, gun-through-hub concept was developed further in the Bell P-63 Kingcobra.\n\nOperational history\n\nThe Airacobra saw combat throughout the world, particularly in the Southwest Pacific, Mediterranean and Russian theaters. Because its engine was not equipped with a supercharger, the P-39 performed best below 17,000 feet (5,200 m) altitude. It often was used at lower altitudes for such missions as ground strafing. Russian pilots appreciated the cannon-armed P-39 for its ground attack capability.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nP-39N-1 \"Saga Boy II\" (42-19447)\n\nIn 1940, the British Direct Purchase Commission in the US was looking for combat aircraft; they ordered 675 of the export version Bell Model 14 as the \"Caribou\" on the strength of the company's representations on 13 April 1940.\n\nThe performance of the Bell P-39 prototype and 13 test aircraft which were able to achieve a speed of 390 mph (630 km/h) at altitude was due to the installation of turbo-supercharging. The British armament was 0.50-inch machine guns in the fuselage, and four 0.30-inch machine guns in the wings, the 37 mm gun was replaced by a 20 mm Hispano Suiza.\n\nThe British export models were renamed \"Airacobra\" in 1941. A further 150 were specified for delivery under Lend-lease in 1941 but these were not supplied. The Royal Air Force (RAF) took delivery in mid 1941 and found that actual performance of the non-turbo-supercharged production aircraft differed markedly from what they were expecting.\n\nIn some areas, the Airacobra was inferior to existing aircraft such as the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire and its performance at altitude suffered drastically. On the other hand it was considered effective for low level fighter and ground attack work. Problems with gun and exhaust flash suppression and compass were fixable.\n\nNo. 601 Squadron RAF was the only British unit to use the Airacobra operationally, receiving their first two examples on 6 August 1941. On 9 October, four Airacobras attacked enemy barges near Dunkirk, in the type's only operational action with the RAF. The squadron continued to train with the Airacobra during the winter, but in March 1942, it re-equipped with Spitfires. The Airacobras already in the UK, along with the remainder of the first batch being built in the US, were sent to the Soviet Air force.\n\nU.S.\n\nThe U.S. requisitioned 200 of the next part of the order as the P-400. The P-400 designation came from advertised top speed of 400 mph (644 km/h). After Pearl Harbor, the P-400 was deployed to training units, but some saw combat in the Southwest Pacific including with the Cactus Air Force in the Battle of Guadalcanal. Guns salvaged from P-39s were sometimes fitted to Navy PT boats to increase firepower.\n\nFrom September to November 1942 pilots of the 57th Fighter Squadron flew P-39s and P-38s from an airfield built on land bulldozed into Kuluk Bay on the barren island of Adak in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. They attacked the Japanese forces which had invaded Attu and Kiska islands in the Aleutians in June 1942. The number one foe that claimed the most lives, however, was not the Japanese but the weather. The low clouds, mist, fog, driving rain, snow and high winds made flying dangerous and lives miserable. The 57th remained in Alaska until November 1942 and then returned to the United States.\n\nIn North Africa, the Tuskegee Airmen were assigned P-39s in February 1944. They successfully transitioned and carried out their duties including supporting Operation Shingle over Anzio as well as missions over the Gulf of Naples in the Airacobra but achieved few aerial victories. By June they were scoring with P-47 Thunderbolts and then in P-51 Mustangs in July 1944.\n\nUSSR\n\nThe most successful use of the P-39 was in the hands of the VVS (Soviet Air Force). The tactical environment of the Eastern Front did not demand the extreme high-altitude operations that the RAF and USAAF employed with their big bombers.\n\nThe P-39's inherent weakness was its lack of a turbocharger but in the relatively low-altitude operations in the East, this was not as great a handicap. The low-speed, low-altitude turning nature of most air combat on the Russian Front suited the P-39's strengths: sturdy construction, reliable radio gear and adequate firepower. It was common for the Soviet pilots to remove the wing guns and rely only on the cannon and nose machine guns as armament. The P-39 was well liked by VVS pilots. The second-highest scoring Allied ace, Aleksandr Pokryshkin, flew the P-39 from late 1942 until the end of the war; his unofficial score in the Airacobra stands at nearly 60 Luftwaffe aircraft. His wingman, Grigori Rechkalov, scored 57 victories with the P-39. This is the highest score ever gained by any pilot with any US-made aircraft. The usual nickname for the Airacobra in the VVS was Kobrusha, \"dear little cobra\".\n\nAustralia\n\nIn early 1942, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), experiencing Japanese air raids on towns in northern Australia, found itself unable to obtain British-designed interceptors or sufficient numbers of P-40s. US Fifth Air Force squadrons in Australia were already receiving the brand new P-39D-1.[15] Consequently, in July 1942, older USAAF P-39s, which had been repaired at Australian workshops, were adopted by the RAAF as a stop-gap interceptor.\n\nSeven P-39Ds were sent to No. 23 Squadron RAAF at Lowood, Queensland. Later, seven P-39Fs were operated by No. 24 Squadron RAAF at Townsville. In the absence of adequate supplies of P-39s, both squadrons also operated Wirraway armed trainers. However, neither squadron received a full complement of Airacobras, or saw combat with them. The home air defence role was filled first by P-40s, followed by Spitfires. Plans to equip two more squadrons with P-39s were also abandoned. 23 and 24 Squadrons converted to the Vultee Vengeance in 1943.\n\nFrance\n\nIn 1940, France ordered numerous P-39s to Bell, but because of the armistice with Germany they were not delivered. However, after Operation Torch French forces in North Africa sided with the Allies, and were re-equipped with Allied equipment including P-39Ns. From mid-1943 on, three fighter squadrons, the GC 3/6 Roussillon, GC 1/4 Navarre and GC 1/5 Champagne, flew these P-39s in combat over the Mediterranean, Italy and Southern France. A batch of P-39Qs was delivered later, but Airacobras, which were never popular with French pilots, had been replaced by P-47 Thunderbolts in front line units by late 1944.\n\nItaly\n\nIn June 1944, the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force (ICAF) 223° Group received approximately 150 P-39s, almost all -Ns and -Qs, but also at least one -L and five -Ms. The training of 4° Stormo pilots began on P-39Ns (with over 200 hours on them), while more modern Qs were used in the front line. The three groups of 4° Stormo trained at a small and poorly-maintained airfield near Vesuvio, then were sent to Galatina airfield in fall 1944. At least 19 training accidents occurred; among the victims on 25 August 1944 was Teresio Martinoli, a 22-victory ace with four years of combat experience.\n\nAlmost 70 aircraft were operational, and on 18 September 1944 12° Group's P-39s flew their first mission over Albania. Concentrating on ground-attack and accumulating over 3000 hours of combat, losing ten aircraft to German flak, the Italian P-39s proved to be suitable in this role.\n\nPortugal\n\nBetween December 1942 and February 1943, the Aeronáutica Militar (Army Military Aviation) obtained aircraft operated by the 81st and the 350th Fighter Groups originally dispatched to North Africa as part of Operation Torch. Due to several problems en route, some of the aircraft were forced to land in Portugal and Spain. Of the 19 fighter aircraft that landed in Portugal, all were interned and entered service that year with the Portuguese Army Military Aviation — the first examples to enter service were five P-39s from the 81st Fighter Group, which landed on 27 December 1942 at Lisbon Airport.\n\nP-39 interned by Portugal (1942—1943)\n\nDate Qty Fighter Group\n\n27 December 1942 5 81st\n\n15 January 1943 2 81st\n\n15 January 1943 9 350th\n\n8 February 1943 1 350th\n\nAlthough, the obtainment of this aircraft was due to their landing in Portugal, the Portuguese Government requested the purchase of the aircraft that had until 1943 been interned. On 26 April 1943, the United States authorized the sale for $20,000 each of 16 Airacobras and one P-38 Lightning, which were intact, and to give as a gift four crates of aircraft, two of which were not badly damaged. However, the United States declined to supply spares.\n\nThe fact that these aircraft were interned during flight missions and that flight or maintenance manuals were bought or available, never allowed a correct transition for the pilots coming from another aircraft.\n\nA check-list recovered from one of the aircraft, but that was incomplete and not totally correct, provided some help but still severe difficulties were felt in the adaptation of pilots to the aircraft. The arrival of American mechanics at the Lajes Air Base eased the maintenance problems, but still any type of documents and technical manuals were never handover to Portuguese crews.\n\nBecause of the previous stated reasons, the start of these aircraft activity was marked with accidents, dut mainly to deficient engine handling.\n\nPortuguese P-39 accidents log book\n\nAircraft Date Notes\n\nAiracobra 301 15 August 1943\n\nAiracobra 304 16 August 1943 Near Ota, causing the death of the pilot, 1st Sergeant Augusto Alves Ferreira\n\nAiracobra 309 26 August 1943\n\nAiracobra 312 8 February 1944 During a training flight\n\nAiracobra 317 25 April 1946\n\nOther accidents are known in which many of the aircraft were not repairable, as one case in which the pilot lost control when rolling too fast and crashed against two other aircraft; and two other aircraft that had to make emergency landings due to engine failure (one at Póvoa de Varzim, and the other at Costa da Caparica).\n\nIn 1944, the Portuguese P-39 saw a peak of activity when 14 Airacobras, divided in two flights of seven aircraft each, participated in various combined armed forces exercises at Ota.\n\nDue to the recurring problem of contamination of the cockpit with carbon monoxide when the machine guns were fired, with the fact that the weapons had a difficult access for maintenance, and had many malfunctions, led to the low or non-existent use of them.\n\nThe service life of the P-39 in Portugal was not a very long one, and the last six Airacobras that remained until the aircraft retirement in 1950, were sold for scrap.\n\nPostwar\n\nIn 1945, Italy purchased the 46 surviving P-39s at 1% of their cost but in summer 1946 many accidents occurred, even fatal ones. By 1947, 4 Stormo re-equipped with P-38s, and P-39s were sent to training units until retirement in 1951. Only a T9 cannon survives today at Vigna di Valle Museum.\n\nThe Airacobra was raced at the National Air Races in the United States after World War II. Famous versions used for racing included the twin aircraft known as \"Cobra I\" and \"Cobra II,\" owned jointly between three Bell Aircraft test pilots, Chalmers \"Slick\" Goodlin, Alvin M. \"Tex\" Johnston, and Jack Woolams. These craft were extensively modified to use the more powerful P-63 Kingcobra engine and had prototype propeller blades from the Bell factory. \"Cobra I\" with its pilot, Jack Woolams, was lost in 1946, over the Great Lakes while he was flying from the National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio back to the factory to get a fresh engine.\n\nThe \"Cobra II\" (Race #84) flown by famed test pilot \"Tex\" Johnston, beat out P-51 Mustangs and other P-39 racers, which were the favorites, to win the 1946 Thompson Trophy race. Cobra II raced again in the 1947 Thompson Trophy race, finishing 3rd. It raced yet again in the 1948 Thompson trophy race, but was unable to finish owing to engine difficulties. Cobra II did not race again and was destroyed on August 10, 1968 during a test flight prior to a run on the world piston-engine speed record, when owner-pilot Mike Carroll lost control and crashed. Carroll and the highly-modified P-39 perished.\n\nMira Slovak's \"Mr. Mennen\" (Race #21) P-39Q Airacobra was a very fast unlimited racer - a late arrival in 1972 kept this little 2000+ hp racer out of the Reno races, and it was never entered again. Its color scheme was all white with \"Mennen\" green and bronze trim. It is now owned and displayed by the Kalamazoo Air Zoo. The P-39Q (former USAAC serial no. 44-3908/NX40A), is painted as a P-400, \"Whistlin' Britches.\"\n\nIn 1942, an P-39 Airacobra crashed in Fiji, but was not found until a local pig farmer discovered the wreck in 2004. The pilot's body was also found and sent to Hawaii for identification. Personal items were recovered at the site.\n\nA number of P-39s are still in existence of which three are still flying. The Commemorative Air Force flies a Bell P-39 Airacobra painted in the markings and colors of the 350th Fighter Group, which consisted of the 345th, 346th and 347th Fighter Squadrons operating P-39s in North Africa and Italy. At one time, the Airacobra was painted in Russian colors and markings. Bell P-39Q-6-BE USAAF, serial no. 42-19993, \"Brooklyn Bum– 2nd\" is now at the Fighter Collection in Duxford, UK. The Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum has P-39Q-15BE, serial no. 44-2433 on display.\n\nBell P-39Q Airacobra - Aviation Museum of Central Finland\n\nKeski-Suomen Ilmailumuseo at Tikkakoski, Finland, has one restored P-39Q Airacobra, \"White 26\", on static display. The aircraft is originally a Soviet lend-lease plane, shot down and captured by Finnish troops in World War Two. It has been restored in the original wartime camouflage and markings.\n\nPopular culture\n\nIntroduction to the P-39 (1942) Bell wartime training film (38 min) intended for military pilots examining flight techniques, cockpit layout and armament.\n\nFlying the P-39 (1943) Bell Training Film No. A.F. - 110 (23 min) demonstrating techniques for piloting the P-39 including aerobatics and strafing.\n\nThe P-39 Airacobra is featured in the Russian movie Transit (film) (2006) (Peregon, Transit) dealing with Lend Lease aircraft in transit to Russia.\n\nVariants\n\nP-39Q-5-BE warbird\n\nBell XFL-1 Airabonita, Navy version\n\nXP-39\n\nfirst prototype, unarmed\n\nYP-39\n\nservice test version, V-1710-37 (E5) 1,090 hp engine, 12 built\n\nYP-39A\n\nintended to have a high-altitude V-1710-31 engine (1,150 hp) but delivered as a regular YP-39, one built.\n\nXP-39B\n\nstreamlined XP-39 based on NACA wind tunnel testing resulting in revised canopy and wheel door shape, oil and radiator intakes moved from right fuselage to wing roots, increased length (by 1 ft 1 in to 29 ft 9 in) and decreased wingspan (by 1 ft 10 in to 34 ft).

The three-engined, torpedo- and medium-bomber was easily recognizable due to having a distinctive fuselage \"hump\", and was well-liked by its crews who gave it the nickname Gobbo Maledetto (\"damned hunchback\").[1] The SM.79 first saw action in the Spanish Civil War, and remained in service in Italy until 1952.\n\nDesign and development\n\nThe SM.79 project began in 1934 and was conceived as a fast, eight-passenger transport capable of being used in air-racing (the London-Melbourne competition). Piloted by Adriano Bacula, the prototype flew for the first time on 28 September1934. Originally planned with the 800 hp Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI Ri as a powerplant, the aircraft reverted to the less powerful 590 hp Piaggio P.IX RC.40 Stella (license-produced Bristol Jupiter and the basis of many Piaggio engines). The engines were subsequently replaced by Alfa Romeo 125 RC.35s (license-produced Bristol Pegasus).\n\nThis prototype (registration I-MAGO) was completed too late to enter the London-Melbourne race, but flew from Milan to Rome in just one hour and ten minutes, at a 410 km/h average speed. Soon after, on 2 August1935, the prototype set a record by flying from Rome to Massaua in Eritrea in 12 flying hours (with a refuelling stop at Cairo). Adapting of the prototype as a bomber reconnaissance aircraft resulted in one of the most successful Italian bomber aircraft of World War II, with some 1,350 of all variants being built. Some were constructed by Aeronautica Umbra of Foligno, best known for the AUT.18.\n\nIn flight and combat\n\nThe Sparviero was suited to the role of torpedo-bomber for several reasons: one being that once force-landed, its wooden structure was light enough to allow it to stay afloat for up to half an hour, giving the crew ample time to escape. The front engine gave some protection against anti aircraft artillery fire (despite the oil and gasoline fire hazard), and could also \"break\" the sea surface, helping the structure to remain intact even though there was a risk of breaking at mid-fuselage. The aircraft was also capable of a relatively quick climb, had a good turn-of-speed for its time, and its rugged structure and responsiveness allowed the aircraft be to carefully looped. The best means of defence from fighters, however, was to fly in tight formations and at sea level. The maximum speed of the SM.79-I, also known as SM.79-K or M, was around 350 km/h at sea level. Utilizing flaps and slats, takeoffs and landings could be performed in short distances.\n\nTorpedoes could be carried on two hardpoints under the inner wings, but often only one was used at once to preserve agility and payload. This torpedo, a 1938 Whitehead design, had a weight of 876 kg, length of 5.46 m and a 170 kg HE warhead. It had a 3,000 m range at 40 knots, and could be launched from a wide range of speeds and altitudes: 40-120 m and up to 300 km/h maximum. It took over ten years to develop effective techniques, consequently there were few torpedo-bombers in late 1940. Since the failure of the Savoia-Marchetti SM.84 (its intended successor) and the lack of power of the Ca.314, only the SM.79 continued to serve as a torpedo-bomber until 1944, despite trials with many types of machines, including the Fiat G.55S.\n\nTo be effective, the launch needed to be made at between 500 and 1,000 m from the target. Under this distance, the torpedo could pass below the keel, failing to explode through not having a magnetic trigger mechanism. Above this range, the unguided weapon could be avoided as it would take almost a minute to reach the target. The lack of a homing system made the long range of the torpedo almost irrelevant, although British torpedo-bombers used a two km-range weapon to more effect in the Mediterranean. At close range, SM.79s often flew at low level above the ships before the torpedo was launched, and so were targeted by every weapon available, from the infantry's small arms to the heavy artillery. Theoretically, the forward Breda with its elevation over the flight line, was capable of targeting ships from around 2 km, but the aircraft needed to fly straight and level; a difficult and dangerous attack tactic.\n\nThe Sparviero had several advantages compared to British torpedo-bombers. Only the Bristol Beaufort could equal it in speed but did not afford the same protection to its crew in a ditching as the vulnerability of its glazed nose could be a danger should the aircraft crash at high speeds. The Vickers Wellington was slower and less agile, but had a very long range and could carry two torpedoes. A step forward in performance was provided by the Bristol Beaufighter, but no torpedo-bomber was more successful in the European theatre than the Fairey Swordfish. This biplane, being fabric-covered and having a fixed undercarriage, was old-fashioned compared to the Sparviero, even though they originated in the same year. It had one engine, was half as fast, and had half the SM.79's range, however, its agility, carrier compatibility and skill of the crews enabled it to sink 200,000 tons of shipping, more than that attributed to any other British aircraft.[8] This was well in excess of that achieved by the Sparviero, even though there were only a few dozen Swordfish compared to hundreds of SM.79s used during World War II. Both aircraft had successors with similar, but enhanced engines.\n\nThey were the SM.84 and the Fairey Albacore, but in both cases, the new engines proved to be less reliable, the heavier machines were less agile, and the operational results were so poor that they were replaced by their predecessors. Radar was an advantage for night attacks, but was only fitted to one experimental SM.79.\n\nIn addition to the barrage of defensive fire put up by target vessels (from large calibre guns at long range down to smaller ones at close range), the SM.79s fell prey to defending fighters. Neither the Blackburn Skua nor Gloster Gladiator presented a real threat for the Sparviero, being 90 and 10 km/h slower respectively. Soon however, the Sparviero faced the Hawker Hurricane, and the Fairey Fulmar which was faster but still quite slow relative to escort fighters. One attacked four SM.79s bombing British ships near Bardia, and shot down three of them on 3 September1940. Beaufighters were fast and well-armed, and as well as being effective long-range day fighters, were successful night interceptors and late in the war often chased Sparvieros in night missions. Eventually, P-40s, P-38s and Spitfires made their début in the Mediterranean, preventing Sparvieros operating during the day. Additionally, Hurricanes, Martlets and Spitfires arrived on carriers improving the British defences against Axis air attacks.\n\nOperators\n\nSM.79 of the Yugoslav Royal Air Force\n\nWartime\n\nBrazil\n\nBrazilian Air Force received two SM.79T aircraft.\n\nCroatia\n\nCroatian Air Force operated few ex-Yugoslavian aircraft.\n\nGermany\n\nLuftwaffe operated several captured aircraft.\n\nIraq\n\nThe Royal Iraqi Air Force operated four aircraft during the Anglo-Iraqi War\n\nItaly\n\nRegia Aeronautica\n\nItalian Social Republic\n\nAeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\n\nRomania\n\nRomanian Air Force\n\nSpain\n\nSpanish Air Force\n\nKingdom of Yugoslavia\n\nYugoslav Royal Air Force\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nRoyal Air Force - Four ex-Yugoslav SM.79s were operated by the RAF in the Middle East\n\nPostwar\n\nItaly\n\nAeronautica Militare\n\nLebanon\n\nLebanese Air Force ordered four SM.79L bomber aircraft in 1946 and received it in 1949 for use as military transports.\n\nSavoia-Marchetti SM.79 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nIl-2\n\nSoviet Air Force Il-2M\n\nType: Ground attack aircraft\n\nManufacturer: Ilyushin\n\nMaiden flight: 20 December 1939\n\nIntroduced: 1941\n\nRetired: 1954 (Yugoslavia & Bulgaria)\n\nPrimary user: Soviet Air Force\n\nProduced: 1941-1945\n\nNumber built: 36,183\n\nVariants: Ilyushin Il-10\n\nThe Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik (Russian: Ил-2 Штурмовик) was a ground attack aircraft in the Second World War, produced by the Soviet Union in huge numbers. In combination with its successor, the Ilyushin Il-10, a total of 36,163 were built, making it the single most produced military aircraft design in all of aviation history as well as the third most produced aircraft in history behind the Cessna 172 and the Polikarpov Po-2.\n\nTo Shturmovik pilots, the aircraft was simply the diminutive \"Ilyusha\". To the soldiers on the ground, it was the \"Hunchback,\" the \"Flying Tank\" or, the greatest of compliments, the \"Flying Infantryman.\" The Il-2 aircraft played a crucial role on the Eastern Front, and in Soviet opinion it was the most decisive aircraft in the history of modern land warfare. Josef Stalin paid the Il-2 a great tribute in his own inimitable manner: when a particular production factory fell behind on its deliveries, Stalin sent the following cable to the factory manager: \"They are as essential to the Red Army as air and bread.\"\n\nDesign and development\n\nIl-2M at the National Aviation Museum in Krumovo, Bulgaria\n\nThe idea for a Soviet armored ground-attack aircraft dates to the early 1930s when Dmitry Pavlovich Grigorovich designed TSh-1 and TSh-2 armored biplanes. However, Soviet engines at the time lacked the power needed to provide the heavy aircraft with good performance. Il-2 was designed by Sergey Ilyushin and his team at the Central Design Bureau in 1938. TsKB-55 was a two-seat aircraft with an armoured shell weighing 700 kg (1,540 lb), protecting crew, engine, radiators, and the fuel tank. Standing empty, the Ilyushin weighed more than 4,500 kg (almost 10,000 lb), making the armoured shell about 15% of the aircraft's gross weight. The prototype, which first flew on 30 December1939, won the government competition against Sukhoi Su-6 and received VVS designation BSh-2. However, BSh-2 was eventually rejected in favor of a lighter single-seat design, the TsKB-57, which first flew 12 October1940. The original Mikulin AM-35 1,370 hp (1,022 kW) engine proved too weak and was replaced by the 1,680 hp (1,254 kW) Mikulin AM-38 before the aircraft entered production.\n\nThe aircraft entered production in 1941 as Il-2, and 249 had been built by the time Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June1941.\n\nOperational history\n\nIl-2 in Warsaw Military Museum\n\nThe first use in action of the Il-2 was with the 4th ShAP (Ground Attack Regiment) over the Berezina River days after the invasion began. So new were the aircraft that the pilots had no training in flight characteristics or tactics, and the ground crew no training in servicing or re-arming.\n\nUnsurprisingly, by 10 July, 4th ShAP was down to ten aircraft from a strength of 65. Tactics changed as the Soviet aircrew got used to the Il-2's strengths. Instead of a low horizontal straight approach at 50 metres altitude, the target was usually kept to the pilot's left and a turn and shallow dive of 30 degrees was utilized, using an echeloned assault by four to twelve aircraft at a time. Although the Il-2's RS-82 rockets could destroy armored vehicles with a single hit, they were so inaccurate that experienced Il-2 pilots mainly utilized their cannon armament.\n\nThereafter the Il-2 was widely deployed on the Eastern Front. The aircraft was capable of flying in low light conditions and carried weaponry capable of defeating the thick armor of the Panther and Tiger I tanks. They were also proved capable of defending themselves against enemy aircraft, claiming an occasional Messerschmitt Bf 109.\n\nThe true abilities of Il-2 are difficult to determine from existing documentary evidence. W. Liss in Aircraft profile 88: Ilyushin Il-2 mentions an engagement during the Battle of Kursk on 7 July1943, in which 70 tanks from the German 9th Panzer Division were destroyed by Ilyushin Il-2 in just 20 minutes. In another report of the action on the same day, a Soviet staff publication states that\n\n\"Ground forces highly valued the work of aviation on the battlefield. In a number of instances enemy attacks were thwarted thanks to our air operations. Thus on 7 July enemy tank attacks were disrupted in the Kashara region (13th Army). Here our assault aircraft delivered three powerful attacks in groups of 20-30, which resulted in the destruction and disabling of 34 tanks. The enemy was forced to halt further attacks and to withdraw the remnants of his force north of Kashara\".—Glantz and Orenstein 1999, p.260.​\n\nThanks to the heavy armor protection, an Il-2 could take a great deal of punishment and proved a difficult target for both ground and aircraft fire to down. Some pilots favored aiming down into the cockpit and wing roots in diving attacks on the slow, low-flying Il-2 formations. Several Luftwaffe aces claimed to attack while climbing from behind, out of view of the rear gunner, and aim for the Il-2's non-retractable oil cooler.\n\nThe veracity of this has been disputed by some Il-2 pilots in postwar interviews since Il-2s typically flew very close to the ground (cruise altitudes below 50 m (160 ft) were common) and the radiator protruded a mere 4 in (10 cm) from the aircraft. A major threat to Il-2 was the German ground fire. In postwar interviews, Il-2 pilots reported 20 mm and 37 mm artillery as the primary threat. While the fabled 88 mm gun was formidable, low-flying Il-2s presented a fast-moving target for the 88's relatively low rate of fire and while occasional hits were scored, Soviet pilots apparently did not treat the \"88\" with the same respect that high-flying Allied bomber crews did.\n\nThe armored tub ranging from 5 to 12 mm (0.2 to 0.5 in) in thickness and enveloping the engine and the cockpit could deflect all small arms fire and glancing blows from larger-caliber ammunition. There are reports of the armored windscreen surviving direct hits from 20 mm rounds. Unfortunately, the rear gunners did not have the benefit of all-around armor protection and suffered about four times more casualties than the pilots. Added casualties resulted from the Soviet policy of not returning home with unused ammunition which typically resulted in repeated passes on the target.\n\nSoviet troops often requested additional passes even after the aircraft were out of ammunition to exploit the intimidating effect Il-2s had on German ground troops who had given it the nickname Schlächter (Slaughterer), perhaps a play on the term Schlachtflugzeug (\"ground attack aircraft\").\n\nFamous nicknames such as \"The Flying Tank\" and \"Der Schwarze Tod\" (the \"Black Death\") were not created by soldiers. First one was created by the designer in early stages of design. The second one was created by the Soviet propaganda. Luftwaffe pilots called it Eiserner Gustav (Iron Gustav) or the Zementbomber (Concrete bomber). The Finnish nickname Maatalouskone (\"The Agricultural Machine\" or \"crop duster\") derived from the habitual low attack pattern, \"crop dusting,\" of the Il-2.\n\nWhile Il-2 proved to be a deadly air-to-ground weapon, heavy losses resulted from vulnerability to fighter attack, consequently, in February 1942, the two-seat design was revived. The IL-2M with a rear gunner under the stretched canopy entered service in September 1942 with surviving single-seaters eventually modified to this standard. Later changes included an upgrade from 20-mm to 23-mm to 37-mm cannons, aerodynamic improvements, use of wooden outer wing panels instead of metal and increased fuel capacity. In 1943, the IL-2 Type 3 or Il-2m3 came out with redesigned wings that were swept back 15 degrees on the outer panels. Performance and handling were much improved and this became the most common version of the Il-2. A radial-engine-powered variant of the Il-2 with Shvetsov ASh-82 engine was proposed in 1942 to remedy projected shortages in Mikulin inline engines.\n\nHowever, ASh-82 was also used in the new Lavochkin La-5 fighter which effectively secured all available engines to the Lavochkin bureau. The radial engine Sukhoi Su-2 ground attack aircraft was produced in small quantities, but was generally considered unsuitable due to inadequate performance and lack of defensive armament. Soviet anti-aircraft artillery frequently mistook it for German aircraft, often with lethal consequences.\n\nAfter the war, the Il-2 could be found in service with several Eastern European countries, with most of the Il-2/10 aircraft eventually scrapped with the advent of military jets. Only a handful of Il-2 survive to this day, including museum rebuilds of crashed airframes. In recent years, several Il-2 wrecks have been located and recovered from Lake Balaton, a large, shallow lake in Hungary, which is located near the historic site of a large World War II tank battle.\n\nAircrew\n\nFamous Il-2 Pilots\n\nSenior Lieutenant Anna Yegorova flew 260 missions\n\nAmong the pilots who gained fame flying the Il-2, was Senior Lieutenant Anna Yegorova, a female pilot who flew 260 missions. She was decorated three times, the last \"posthumously\", as she was presumed dead after being shot down. In fact, she managed to survive imprisonment in a German concentration camp.\n\nJr Lt Ivan Grigorevich Drachenko, another Il-2 pilot, was reputedly one of only four men who were both decorated as Heroes of the Soviet Union and also won all three of the Orders of Glory.\n\nPilots Begeldinov, Mylnikov, Alekseenko, and Gareev received two gold stars of the Hero of the Soviet Union, last of them got both stars in one day.\n\nHero of the Soviet Union T. Kuznetsov survived the crash of his Il-2 in 1942 when shot down returning from a reconnaissance mission. Kuznetsov was able to escape from the wreck and hid nearby. To his surprise, a German Bf 109 landed near the crash site and the pilot began to scrounge around the wrecked Il-2 for souvenirs. Thinking quickly, Kuznetsov ran to the German fighter and used it to fly home, barely avoiding being shot down by Soviet fighters in the process.\n\nTypical of Soviet Second World War aircraft, many Il-2 were \"gifts\" presented to specific pilots and partially paid for by organizations like hometowns, factories or comrades of another fallen pilot. The most famous of these was an aircraft purchased with the savings of a seven-year-old daughter of the fallen commander of the 237th ShAP. Learning of her father's death, the girl sent 100 rubles directly to Stalin asking him to use the money for an Il-2 to avenge her father. Remarkably, Stalin actually received the letter and 237th ShAP received a new Il-2m3 with the inscription \"From Lenochka for father\" on the side.\n\nIl-2 Rear gunners: a deliberate sacrifice?\n\nIl-2M cockpit. Museum of Aviation in Belgrade, Serbia\n\nIn his book Inside the Soviet Army, Viktor Suvorov alleges that the lack of protection for Il-2 rear gunners was part of a deliberate policy. Suvorov claims that from 1942 on, all Soviet airfields had attached penal companies of air gunners. Such companies were made up of prisoners who were considered to be \"enemies of socialism\" or \"enemies of the people.\" The air gunners were not provided with either armour protection, or allegedly, parachutes and were reliant entirely on their machine guns to ensure their own survival. The death rate among the air gunners was exceptionally high and Suvorov alleges that the Marshal of the Air Forces, A. E. Golovanov, came up with a special device to keep the guns pointing up after the gunners were killed. Otherwise attacking Luftwaffe pilots would realise the air gunner was dead and concentrate on that aircraft. According to Suvorov, prisoners who survived could theoretically clear their sentences after nine missions. The prisoners, however, were always transferred to mine clearing or other units for \"medical reasons\" before this could happen.\n\nMany Il-2 pilots and rear gunners do not remember seeing or hearing about any prisoner crews, and German propaganda may have broadcast this claim as well. In recent years documents from the Soviet archives have come to light indicating that the Soviet Air Force did in fact use \"Penal squadrons\" in some situations, but although they may have been considered expendable, there is no evidence that even they would have been deliberately sacrificed.\n\nWith respect to armor protection, most Il-2s produced after 1944 and the follow-on Il-10 had armor for the rear gunner. The initial omission may well have been result of the rear gunner being a design afterthought for a single-seat aircraft that was implemented during the crisis years of the war, rather than a deliberate act.\n\nProduction\n\nThe Il-2 was produced in vast quantities, becoming one of the most widely produced military aircraft in history.\n\nProduction early in the Great Patriotic War was slow, due to the aircraft factories near Moscow and other major cities in western Russia being relocated east of the Ural mountains after the German invasion. Ilyushin and his engineers had time to reconsider production methods, and two months after the move, Il-2s were again being produced. The tempo was not to Premier Stalin's liking, however, and he issued the following telegram to Shenkman and Tretyakov:\n\nYou have let down our country and our Red Army. You have the nerve not to manufacture IL-2s until now. Our Red Army now needs IL-2 aircraft like the air it breathes, like the bread it eats. Shenkman produces one IL-2 a day and Tretyakov builds one or two MiG-3s daily. It is a mockery of our country and the Red Army. I ask you not to try the government's patience, and demand that you manufacture more ILs. This is my final warning.—Stalin​\n\nAccording to one reference, \"the production of Shturmoviks rapidly gained speed. Stalin's notion of the Il-2 being 'like bread' to the Red Army took hold in Ilyushin's aircraft plants and the army soon had their Shturmoviks available in quantity.\"\n\nSpecifications (Il-2M3)\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: Two, pilot and rear gunner\n\nLength: 11.6 m (38 ft 1 in)\n\nWingspan: 14.6 m (47 ft 11 in)\n\nHeight: 4.2 m (13 ft 9 in)\n\nWing area: 38.5 m² (414 ft²)\n\nEmpty weight: 4,360 kg (9,610 lb)\n\nLoaded weight: 6,160 kg (13,580 lb)\n\nPowerplant: 1× Mikulin AM-38F liquid-cooled V-12, 1,285 kW (1,720 hp)\n\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 414 km/h (257 mph)\n\nRange: 720 km (450 mi)\n\nService ceiling 5,500 m (18,000 ft)\n\nRate of climb: 10.4 m/s (2050 ft/min)\n\nWing loading: 160 kg/m² (31.3 lb/ft²)\n\nPower/mass: 0.21 kW/kg (0.13 hp/lb)\n\nArmament\n\n2x fixed forward-firing 23 mmVYa-23 cannons, 150 rounds/gun\n\n2x fixed forward-firing 7.62 mmShKAS machine guns, 750 rounds/gun\n\n1x manually aimed 12.7 mmBerezin UBT machine gun the in rear cockpit, 150 rounds\n\nUp to 600 kg (1,320 lb) of bombs and/or 4x RS-82 or RS-132 rockets\n\nIlyushin Il-2 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nBack to reality.....\n\nPZL.37 Łoś\n\nPZL.37Abis Łoś\n\nType: Bomber\n\nManufacturer: PZL\n\nMaiden flight: 13 December, 1936\n\nIntroduce: 1938\n\nRetired: 1944 (Romanian Air Force)\n\nStatus: Retired\n\nPrimary users: Polish Air Force\n\nRomanian Air Force\n\nLuftwaffe\n\nProduced: 1938 - 1939\n\nNumber built: over 120\n\nThe PZL.37 Łoś (Polish: moose) was a Polish twin-engine medium bomber, used in the Invasion of Poland in 1939. Thanks to the laminar-flow wing it was one of the most modern bombers in the world before World War II.\n\nDesign and development\n\nSometimes the plane is called \"PZL P-37\" or \"PZL P.37\", but the letter \"P\" was generally reserved for fighters of Zygmunt Pulawski's design (see PZL P.11). The correct designation should be PZL.37.\n\nThe PZL.37 was designed in the mid-1930s at the PZL factory in Warsaw by Jerzy Dąbrowski. The first PZL.37/I prototype, fitted with a single vertical stabilizer, flew on December 13, 1936. The second prototype PZL.37/II, with twin vertical stabilizers and other improvements, was accepted for production. The first 10 serial aircraft were produced in 1938 as the PZL.37A variant with a single vertical stabilizer, however. The next 19 interim aircraft were built as PZL.37A bis, with a twin tail. They all were powered by Bristol Pegasus XII B radial engines produced in Poland under licence.\n\nThe main production variant, the PZL.37B (or: Łoś II), was fitted with the twin tail and newer Pegasus XX engines. Production of PZL.37B for the Polish Air Force started in autumn 1938. During the initial period of PZL.37 service, 2 prototypes and 6 serial planes, were lost in crashes caused by technical problems, mostly with rudders. After some structural changes, the PZL.37B became a fully reliable aircraft. By the outbreak of World War II, about 92 PZL.37s had been produced and given to the Air Force, and a further 31 were in different phases of production.\n\nBefore the war, the PZL.37B Łoś was one of the world's most modern bombers. It was able to carry a heavier bombload than similar aircraft, for example the Vickers Wellington though the size of the bombs was limited. Smaller than most contemporary medium bombers, it was relatively fast and easy to handle. Thanks to a landing gear with double wheels it could operate from rough fields or meadows. Typically for the late 1930s, its defensive armament consisted of only 3 machine guns, which proved too weak against enemy fighters.\n\nStarting with a presentation at a salon in Belgrade in June 1938 and in Paris in November, the PZL.37 met with a huge interest. For export purposes, new variants were developed: the PZL.37C with Gnome-Rhone 14N-0/1 engines of 985 cv (971 BHP, 724 kW), maximum speed 445 km/h and the PZL.37D with 14N-20/21 of 1,065 cv (1,050 BHP, 783 kW), maximum speed 460 km/h. In 1939, 20 PZL.37Cs were ordered by Yugoslavia, 15 by Bulgaria, 30 PZL.37D by Romania and 25 by Turkey and Belgium ordered a license. Also several other countries were negotiating. The outbreak of the war prevented the production of these aircraft. At that time, PZL developed the next variant for the Polish airforce, the PZL.49 Miś, but this was not completed before the war. Having slightly bigger dimensions, Miś (\"Bear\") was to be fitted with Bristol Hercules II engines of 1,350 BHP (1,370 cv, 1,007 kW), maximum speed 520 km/h and an upper turret.\n\nTechnical design\n\nThe aircraft was conventional in layout, all metal, metal-covered, with low-set laminar-flow wings and a twin tail. In size it was slightly larger than the Lockheed L-10 Electra Amelia Earhart used. The crew consisted of four: pilot, commander-bombardier, radio operator and a rear gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in the glazed nose, with a forward machine gun. The radio operator sat inside the fuselage, above the bomb bay, and he also operated an underbelly rear machine gun. The main undercarriage retracted into the engine nacelles. The undercarriage was double-wheeled, with an independent suspension for each wheel. The plane was powered by two Bristol Pegasusradial engines. The PZL.37A had Pegasus XII B engines (normal power: 860 BHP (873 cv, 642 kW), maximum: 940 BHP (953 cv, 701 kW)), the PZL.37B had Pegasus XX engines (normal power: 905 HP (918 cv, 675 kW), maximum: 970 BHP (984 cv, 723 kW)). The bombs were carried in two-section bomb bay in the fuselage and 8 bomb bays in the central section of the wings. The maximum load was 2,580 kg (2 × 300 kg and 18 × 110 kg). Apart from two 300 kg bombs, it could not carry larger bombs than 110 kg. During the Invasion of Poland 1939, 110 kg was the maximum weight used.\n\nOperational history\n\nThe Polish Air Force started to receive the PZL.37B in the spring of 1939. On September 1, 1939, it had about 86 PZL.37s in total, but less than a half of those were used in combat. 36 PZL.37Bs were in four bomber escadres of a Bomber Brigade: the 11th, 12th, 16th and 17th escadres (two escadres with nine aircraft each, constituted a group, in Polish: dywizjon; the PZL.37 were in groups X and XV). The rest of the Bomber Brigade aircraft were PZL.23 Karaś. About 50 remaining PZL.37s were in the reserve XX group, training units or in repairs.\n\nOnly the PZL.37s of the Bomber Brigade took part in combat. By September 1, they had been deployed to rural improvised airfields, so they were not destroyed on the ground by the Germans in their initial attack on the main Polish airbases. During the Invasion of Poland, from September 4 onward the planes of the Bomber Brigade were attacking German armoured columns in day attacks, forced by the desperate situation to perform this mission for which they were not designed (the original plans to bomb targets inside Germany were quickly abandoned). Most notably, they hampered the advance of the 16th Armoured Corps near Częstochowa and Radomsko. They suffered heavy losses due to lack of fighter protection, especially due to the fact that they usually operated in unis of no more than three aircraft at a time. Last combat flights took place on September 16. During the campaign, the combat units were reinforced with several other aircraft, and about 46 PZL.37s were used in combat. Of Bomber Brigade, ten PZL.37s were shot down by fighters, five shot down by enemy anti-aircraft artillery, two bombed on the ground and a further ten lost in other ways. A number of not fully completed, training or reserve PZL.37s were also destroyed on airfields and in factories (18 PZL.37s were bombed in a reserve base in Małaszewicze and in a factory in Warsaw - Okęcie).\n\n26 or 27 PZL.37s (17 from the Bomber Brigade and ten training ones) were withdrawn in 1939 to Romania. In October 1940 they were seized by the Romanian government and 23 were next used by the Romanian air force in the 4th Group, consisting of the 76th and 77th bomber escadres. Some were uparmed with four machine guns (the Polish PWU machineguns were still used). About 1/3 were lost in crashes due to lack of experience of Romanian pilots with PZL.37 handling and its high wing loading, and due to engine faults. About 15 were used against the USSR from June 22, 1941. Among others, they first operated in Bessarabia, then they were bombing Kiev and Odessa. Some were lost, mostly due to anti-aircraft fire. Because of lack of spares, the remaining ones were withdrawn from the front in October 1941 and used for training. In April 1944, the 76th escadre returned to combat, with nine aircraft, but it was withdrawn from the front on May 3, 1944. After Romania joined the allies, on September 1, 1944 German aircraft destroyed five PZL.37s on a ground.\n\nCaptured planes were also tested in Germany and the USSR. Not many PZL.37s, however, fell into German hands (probably only two), because Polish workers scrapped about 30 PZL.37s remaining in factories in Okęcie and Mielec in October 1939, under pretext of cleaning up the area, before the competent German authorities were able to reconnoitre. There are no surviving PZL.37 aircraft currently.\n\nOperators\n\nWartime\n\nPoland\n\nPolish Air Force\n\nGermany\n\nLuftwaffe operated two captured PZL.37s for testing purposes.\n\nRomania\n\nRomanian Air Force\n\nSoviet Union\n\nSoviet Air Force operated two captured PZL.37s for testing purposes.\n\nPlanned\n\nBelgium\n\nBelgian Air Force\n\nBulgaria\n\nBulgarian Air Force\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkish Air Force\n\nKingdom of Yugoslavia\n\nYugoslav Royal Air Force\n\nSpecifications (PZL.37B Łoś)\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: 4\n\nLength: 12.92 m (42 ft 5 in)\n\nWingspan: 17.93 m (58 ft 10 in)\n\nHeight: 5.1 m (16 ft 9 in)\n\nWing area: 53.5 m² (576 ft²)\n\nEmpty weight: 4,935 kg (10,880 lb)\n\nLoaded weight: 8,880 kg (19,580 lb)\n\nMax takeoff weight: 9,105 kg (20,070 lb)\n\nPowerplant: 2× Bristol Pegasus XX radial engines, 723 kW (970 hp) each\n\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 412 km/h (256 mph)\n\nRange: 2,600 km (4,200 mi) with maximum bomb load\n\nService ceiling 7,000 m (23,000 ft)\n\nRate of climb: 4.7 m/s (925 ft/min)\n\nWing loading: 166 kg/m² (34 lb/ft²)\n\nArmament\n\n3 x 7.92 mm machine guns: 1 in the nose, 1 in the rear upper station, 1 in underbelly station\n\nUp to 2,580 kg (5,690 lb) of bombs\n\nPZL.37 ÅoÅ› - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJust for Tomcat\n\nBf 109\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109G-2/Trop\n\nType: Fighter:\n\nManufacturer: Bayerische Flugzeugwerke\n\nMesserschmitt\n\nDesigned by: Willy Messerschmitt\n\nMaiden flight: 28 May 1935\n\nIntroduced: 1937\n\nRetired: 1945, Luftwaffe\n\n1965, Spain\n\nStatus: Retired\n\nPrimary users Luftwaffe\n\nHungarian Air Force\n\nItalian Social Republic\n\nRomanian Air Force\n\nNumber built: more than 33,000\n\nVariants: Avia S-99/S-199\n\nHispano Aviacion Ha 1112\n\nThe Messerschmitt Bf 109 was a German World War II fighter aircraft designed by Willy Messerschmitt in the early 1930s. It was one of the first true modern fighters of the era, including such features as an all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear.\n\nThe Bf 109 was produced in greater quantities than any other fighter aircraft in history, with a wartime production (September 1939 to May 1945) of 30,573 units. Fighter production totalled 47% of all German aircraft production, and the Bf 109 accounted for 57% of all fighter types produced. 2,193 Bf 109 A-E were built prewar, from 1936 to August 1939, with additional ~1,000 postwar as licence built Avia S-99/S-199 and Ha 1112 Buchon.\n\nThe Bf 109 was the backbone of the Luftwaffe fighter force in World War II, although it began to be partially replaced by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 from 1941. The Bf 109 scored more aircraft kills in World War II than any other aircraft. At various times it served as an air superiority fighter, a bomber escort, an interceptor, a ground-attack aircraft and a reconnaissance aircraft. Although the Bf 109 had weaknesses, including a short range, and especially a sometimes difficult to handle narrow, outward-retracting undercarriage, it stayed competitive with Allied fighter aircraft until the end of the war.\n\nThe Bf 109 was flown by the three top-scoring fighter aces of World War II: Erich Hartmann, the top scoring fighter ace of all time with 352 official victories, Gerhard Barkhorn with 301 victories, and Günther Rall with 275 victories. All of them flew with Jagdgeschwader 52, a unit which exclusively flew the Bf 109 and was credited with over 10,000 victories, chiefly on the Eastern Front. Hartmann refused to fly any other aircraft in combat throughout the war. Hans-Joachim Marseille, the highest scoring German ace in the North African Campaign, also scored all of his 158 official victories in the Bf 109, against Western Allied pilots. The Bf 109 was also used with good result by non-German pilots, including Finnish fighter ace Ilmari Juutilainen with 94 victories — the highest scoring non-German fighter ace in history.\n\nDesign features\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109G-10\n\nat the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio\n\nMesserschmitt had already designed much of the Bf 109 by this point. As with the Bf 108, the new design was based on Messerschmitt's \"lightweight construction\", which essentially aimed to reduce the total number of strong parts in the aircraft as much as possible. One of the more notable examples of this was the mounting of all structural points to a strong firewall at the front of the cockpit, including the wing spars, engine mounts and landing gear. In more conventional designs these would be mounted to different points on the aircraft, with a framework distributing the load among them.\n\nAnother notable advantage of this design was that, since the landing gear was attached to the fuselage itself, it was possible to completely remove the wings of the aircraft for major servicing, if necessary, leaving the fuselage intact sitting on the landing gear. However, this had one major drawback — this landing gear arrangement ensured a narrow track (the distance between the main tyres) and hence made the aircraft unstable in terms of balance while on the ground. The Bf 109 was notoriously difficult to take off and land, and many fighters simply veered off or tipped over to one side during a seemingly perfect run. To make things worse, the landing gear struts were comparatively long. This left the nose pointing up at quite a steep angle with respect to the ground, making forward visibility during taxiing near zero.\n\nThe Bf 109 suffered from ground accidents due to \"swing\" on takeoff and landings throughout its life. It has been suggested that 5% of all 109s were lost this way, or even one third; the Luftwaffe's loss records on the other hand show that approximately 1% of the Bf 109s had suffered landing incidents or accidents at the beginning of its career, a figure comparable to the other monoplane fighters introduced at the time. This feature was, however, more of a problem with rookie pilots, especially during later stages of the war.\n\nThe Spitfire had a similar, narrow landing gear arrangement, but there has not been widespread talk about operational losses due to this, and it has been speculated that the swing was due to the toe-in of the main landing gear wheels. Most Finnish pilots report that the swing was easy to control, but some of the less experienced pilots lost fighters on startup.\n\nReflecting Willy Messerschmitt's belief in low-weight, low-drag simple monoplanes, the armament was placed in the main body of the aircraft; two machine guns were mounted above the engine and a third could be fired through the airscrew hub, with the engine buffering the recoil. Fitting with Willy's ethos, this kept his gun-free wings very thin and lightweight. When it was discovered that the RAF was producing eight-gun monoplanes, it became clear that the Bf 109 would \"have\" to carry more weaponry and a new wing was designed with machine guns, and later, 20 mm MG FF cannon configurations.\n\nIn 1938 the \"Emil\" (see below) went into production, but to improve on the performance allowed by the rather small 600 to 700 hp Jumo engine the larger Daimler Benz DB 601A engine was used, yielding an extra 300 hp at the cost of an additional 400 lb.\n\nAnother aspect of this construction technique was the use of a single, I-section main spar in the wing, mounted closer to the leading edge, forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box with it. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear, but the D-box was much stiffer torsionally, and eliminated the need for the rear spar.\n\nAnother major difference was the much higher wing loading than the other designs. While the R-IV contract called for a wing loading of less than 100 kg/m², Messerschmitt felt that this was unreasonable; with the engines available to them, the fighter would end up slower than the bombers it was tasked with catching.\n\nA wing generates two forms of drag, parasitic drag due to its form, and induced drag which is a side effect of generating lift. The former dominates at high speeds, when the airflow hitting the wing causes drag that rises with the square of the aircraft's speed. The latter dominates at lower speeds, where the lack of airflow requires the wing to be angled into the airflow at a higher angle of attack. Since the fighter was being designed primarily for high speed flight, a smaller wing would be optimised for high speed use.\n\nThe downside of such a trade-off is that low-speed flight would suffer, as the smaller wing would require more airflow to generate enough lift to stay flying. In order to address this, the Bf 109 included advanced high-lift devices on the wings, including automatically opening slats on the leading edge, and fairly large camber-changing flaps on the trailing edge. He also included ailerons that \"drooped\" when the flaps were lowered thereby increasing the effective flap area when the flaps were deployed. When deployed, these devices effectively increased the coefficient of lift, making it better at low speeds and high angles of attack.\n\nAnother drawback of the high wing loading is that the fighter would require more energy to manoeuvre. Given the limited amount of power available, this effectively meant that the Bf 109 could not turn as tightly as other designs with larger wings. The high lift devices would offset this to some degree, but they also increased drag and so slowed the aircraft further. Given that manoeuvrability was last on the RLM's wish list, Messerschmitt was certain the benefits outweighed the drawbacks.\n\nBf 109E \"Emil\"\n\nTo test the new DB601A engine, with its 1,100 PS (1,085 hp, 809 kW), two more prototypes, the V14 and V15, were built, that differed in their armament. While the V14 was armed with the two MG 17 above the engine and one 20 mm MG FF cannon in each wing, the V15 got the two MG 17s above the engine and a MG FF Motorkanone firing through the propeller axis. After test fights the V14 was considered more promising and a pre-production batch of 10 E-0 was ordered. Batches of both E-1 and E-3 variants were shipped to Spain for evaluation, and received their baptism of fire in the final phases of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 E-3\n\nThe production version E-1 kept the two 7.92 mm MG 17s above the engine and had two MG 17s in the wings. Later many were modified to the E-3 armament standard. The E-1B was a small batch of E-1s produced to be the first operational use of a Bf 109 as fighter bomber, or Jagdbomber in German, usually abbreviated to Jabo. They were fitted with either a ETC 250 bomb rack, carrying one 250 kg bomb or two ETC 50 bomb racks, carrying a 50 kg bomb under each wing. The E-1 was also fitted with the Reflexvisier \"Revi\" gunsight. The E-1 also carried the FuG 7 Funkgerät 7 (radio set) short-range radio equipment, effective at ranges of 30-35 miles. A total of 1,183 E-1 were built, 110 of them were E-1/B.\n\nThe E-2 was not built for unknown reasons, probably another failed attempt to install an engine mounted machine gun or Motorkanone cannon.\n\nTo improve the performance of the Bf 109E, the last two real prototypes were constructed, the V16 and V17. They got some structural improvements and stronger armament. These prototypes were the basis of the Bf 109 E-3 version. They were armed with the two MG 17s above the engine and one MG FF cannon in each wing. The E-3 also received additional armor, often self sealing fuel tanks and an optional, improved DB601Aa with 1,175 PS (1,159 hp, 864 kW) respectively.\n\nA total of 1,276 E-3 were built, 75 of them were E-3a export versions without equipment classified as secret.\n\nBf 109E\n\nBf 109E-4\n\nBf 109E at Deutsches Technikmuseum Berlin.\n\nThe E-3 was replaced by the E-4 (with many airframes being upgraded to E-4 standards starting at beginning of the Battle of Britain) which was different in some small details, most notably by the modified MG-FF/M wing cannon and by improved head armor for the pilot. The MG FF/M fired a new and improved type of explosive shell, called Minengeschoß (or 'mine-shell') which was made by drawn steel (the same way brass cartridges are made) instead of being cast as was the usual practice. This resulted in a shell with a thin but strong wall, which hence had a larger cavity in which to pack a much larger explosive charge than was otherwise possible. The new shell required modifications to the MG FF's mechanism due to the different recoil characteristics, hence the MG FF/M-this special /M designation has also been thought to designate a Motorkanone version of the MG FF cannon.\n\nThe canopy was also revised to an easier-to-produce, \"squared-off\" design, and stayed fairly unchanged until the introduction of the 'Erla' canopy on the G-6 in the autumn of 1943. The E-4 would be the base for all further Bf 109 E developments. Some E-4 and later models got a further improved 1,175 PS DB601N high-altitude engine resulting in a slightly changed model number like E-4/N, first appearing in July 1940. The E-4 was also available as fighter-bomber with equipment very similar to the previous E-1/B. It was known as E-4/B (DB 601Aa engine) and E-4/BN (DB 601N engine).\n\n496 E-4 of all versions were built - 250 E-4, 20 E-4/N, 211 E-4/B and 15 E-4/BN.\n\nThe E-5 and E-6 were both reconnaissance variant with a camera installation behind the cockpit. The E-5 was a reconnaissance variant of the E-3, the E-6 was a reconnaissance variant of the E-4/N.\n\n29 E-5 built and 9 E-6 were ordered.\n\nThe E-7 was the next major production variant. It was based on the E-4/B and was able to carry drop tank, which greatly increased their range, or a bomb to be used as fighter-bomber. As the DB 601N was still not available in large numbers many E-7 used a mix of DB 601A, Aa or N engines with the latter designated as E-7/N.\n\nThe E-1 and E-4 saw the most heavy action during the Battle of Britain — most of the E-3s were already converted to E-4 standard. The fuel-injected DB601 engine of the Bf 109 proved most useful against the British Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters, as the British fighters used gravity carburetor engines, which would cut out under negative g forces whereas the DB601 did not. The Bf 109s thus had the initial advantage in dives, either during attack or to escape it was able to get out of gun range.\n\nThe Spitfire proved a formidable opponent, being approximately as fast and is claimed somewhat more maneuverable in turns at medium to high speeds than the Bf 109 (the latter due to the Bf 109's high wing loading). On the question of comparative turning circles in combat, Spitfires and Hurricanes benefited from their lower wing loading compared with the Bf109; 22 to 24 pounds per square foot on the RAF machines against 32 pounds per square foot for the Bf 109. Royal Aircraft Establishment tests with a captured Bf 109 showed the Spitfire's turning circle — without height loss — was 696 feet (212 m) in radius (the Hurricane's would be slightly tighter) while the 109's was 885 feet (270 m) radius according to British calculations using assumed values as basis. According to the German manuals however, the smallest turning circle was 170 m, and fighter pilots on both sides claim they would out-turn their opponents in combat. In roll rates the Bf 109 enjoyed an advantage at dogfight speeds, though at high speeds the maneuverability of all three fighters, especially the Spitfire was severely limited in this regard.\n\nThe Bf 109 enjoyed good handling near stalling speeds as it was particularly forgiving then. Firepower between the antagonists was comparable, with the Spitfire and Hurricane having eight .303 inch machine guns versus the Bf 109's two 7.92 mm MG17 machine guns and two 20 mm MG FF cannon.\n\nHowever, the MG FF occasionally jammed and had a small (60-round) ammunition capacity. To be fair, when the Spitfires were later upgraded to two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza cannon, the British initially had serious jamming problems of their own with the new weapon. RAF pilots who tested captured Bf 109s liked the engine and throttle response but criticised the high speed handling characteristics, poorer turning circle, greater force required on the control column at speed and the thick framing of the cockpit glazing which they felt created blindspots in the pilot's field of vision.\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: One\n\nLength: 8.95 m (29 ft 7 in)\n\nWingspan: 9.925 m (32 ft 6 in)\n\nHeight: 2.60 m (8 ft 2 in)\n\nWing area: 16.40 m² (173.3 ft²)\n\nEmpty weight: 2,247 kg (5,893 lb)\n\nLoaded weight: 3148 kg (6,940 lb)\n\nMax takeoff weight: 3,400 kg (7,495 lb)\n\nPowerplant: 1× Daimler-Benz DB 605A-1 liquid-cooled inverted V12, 1,475 PS (1,455 hp, 1,085 kW)\n\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 640 km/h (398 mph) at 6,300 m (20,669 ft)\n\nCruise speed: 590 km/h (365 mph) at 6,000 m (19,680 ft)\n\nRange: 850 km (528 mi) with droptank 1,000 km (620 mi)\n\nService ceiling: 12,000 m (39,370 ft)\n\nRate of climb: 17.0 m/s (3,345 ft/min)\n\nWing loading: 199.8 kg/m² (40.9 lb/ft²)\n\nPower/mass: 330 W/kg (0.21 hp/lb)\n\nArmament\n\n2×13 mm MG 131 machine guns\n\n1×20 mm MG 151/20 cannon (or 1x 30 mm MK 108, G-6/U4)\n\n1×300 l (78 US gal) drop tank or 1×250 kg (550 lb) bomb or 4×50 kg (110 lb) bombs\n\n2×WGr.21 rockets (G-6 with BR21)\n\n2x 20 mm MG 151/20 underwing cannon pods (G-6 with R6)\n\nMuch much more info here: Messerschmitt Bf 109 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAnd the Tomcat saga continues...\n\nThe Spitfire\n\nRAF Supermarine Spitfire XII banks above clouds.\n\nType: Fighter\n\nManufacturer: Supermarine\n\nDesigned by: R. J. Mitchell\n\nMaiden flight: 5 March 1936\n\nIntroduction: 1938\n\nRetired: 1955, RAF\n\nPrimary user: Royal Air Force\n\nProduced: 1938–1948\n\nNumber built: 20,351\n\nUnit cost: £12,604 (1939)\n\nVariants: Seafire\n\nSpiteful\n\nThe Supermarine Spitfire was a British single-seat fighter, used by the Royal Air Force and many other Allied countries during the Second World War, and into the 1950s. It was produced in greater numbers than any other Allied design. The Spitfire was the only Allied fighter in production at the outbreak of the Second World War that was still in production at the end of the war.\n\nProduced by the Supermarine subsidiary of Vickers-Armstrongs, the Spitfire was designed by the company's Chief Designer R. J. Mitchell, who continued to refine the design until his death from cancer in 1937; the position of chief designer was then filled by his colleague, Joseph Smith. Its elliptical wing had a thin cross-section, allowing a higher top speed than the Hawker Hurricane and many other contemporary designs.\n\nThe distinctive silhouette imparted by the wing planform helped the Spitfire to achieve legendary status during the Battle of Britain. There was, and still is, a public perception that it was the RAF fighter of the Battle, in spite of the fact that the more numerous Hurricane shouldered a great deal of the burden against the potent Messerschmitt Bf 109. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire saw service during the whole of the Second World War and subsequent years, in most theatres of war, in several roles and in many different variants.\n\nThe Spitfire will always be compared to its main adversary, the Bf 109: both were among the finest fighters of their day, although the Spitfire ultimately proved to be a more flexible and tractable design, and kept its superb handling qualities through every permutation.\n\nDesign and development\n\nThe still unpainted Spitfire prototype K5054 shortly before its first flight\n\nSupermarine's Chief Designer, R.J. Mitchell, had won four Schneider Trophy seaplane races with his designs: (Sea Lion II in 1922, S 5 in 1927, S 6 in 1929 and S 6b in 1931), combining powerful Napier Lion and Rolls-Royce \"R\" engines with minute attention to streamlining. These same qualities are equally useful for a fighter design, and, in 1931, Mitchell created such an aircraft design in response to an Air Ministry specification (F7/30) for a new and modern monoplane fighter.\n\nThis first attempt at a fighter resulted in an open-cockpit monoplane with gull-wings and a large fixed, spatted undercarriage powered by the evaporative-cooled Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine. The Supermarine Type 224 did not live up to expectations; nor did any of the competing designs, which were also deemed failures.\n\nMitchell immediately turned his attention to an improved design as a private venture, with the backing of Supermarine's owner, Vickers-Armstrongs. The new design added undercarriage retraction, an enclosed cockpit, oxygen breathing-apparatus and the much more powerful newly-developed Rolls-Royce PV-XII engine, later named the Merlin.\n\nBy 1935, the Air Ministry had seen enough advances in the industry to try the monoplane design again.\n\nName origin\n\nThe Air Ministry submitted a number of names to Vickers-Armstrongs for the new aircraft, tentatively known as the Type 300, including the improbable Shrew. The name Spitfire was suggested by Sir Robert MacLean, director of Vickers-Armstrongs at the time, who called his daughter Ann, \"a little spitfire.\" The word dates from Elizabethan times and refers to a particularly fiery, ferocious type of person, and at the time, associated with a girl or woman of that temperament. The name had previously been used unofficially for Mitchell's earlier F.7/30 Type 224 design. Mitchell is reported to have said that it was \"just the sort of bloody silly name they would choose\", possibly an oblique reference to an earlier, much less successful aircraft of his design that had been given the same name.\n\nAirframe\n\nThe Spitfire was one of a new generation of all metal, monoplane fighter aircraft that first appeared in the early 1930s with the advent of the likes of the American Boeing P-26 and the Russian Polikarpov I-16. The Spitfire was the first all metal, low wing monoplane fighter to enter RAF service.\n\nMitchell's design aims were to create a well balanced high performance fighter aircraft which would be able to fully utilise the power of the Merlin engine and, at the same time would be relatively easy to fly. To that end his design team developed an airframe which, for its day was complex.\n\nThe exceptionally well streamlined semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage featured a large number of compound curves and was built up from a skeleton of 19 frames, starting from the main engine bulkhead. The first six were half frames to accommodate the fuel tanks and cockpit. From the seventh, which was the frame to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, to the 15th, which was mounted at a forward angle just forward of the tailfin, the frames were oval in shape, each reducing slightly in size, and had numerous holes drilled through them to lighten the structural weight as much as possible without weakening them. Frame 16 formed a double bulkhead with frame 17, which was extended to form the main spar of the vertical fin; frame 18 formed the secondary spar. Just aft of this the 19th frame formed the rudder post. A combination of longitudinal stringers and two main longerons helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were attached. There was plenty of room to later fit camera equipment and fuel tanks.\n\nElliptical wing design\n\nFrom early on Mitchell and the design staff were contemplating an elliptical wing shape to solve the conflicting requirements of having the lowest possible thickness-to-chord ratio to reduce drag, and having room to install a retractable undercarriage, as well as the projected armament and ammunition which, in April 1935, was changed from two .303 Vickers machine guns in each wing to four .303 Brownings.\n\nIt has been suggested that Mitchell copied the wing shape of the Heinkel He 70. Mitchell's aerodynamicist, Beverley Shenstone, however, has pointed out that the He 70 was designed to fulfill a completely different role and that other aircraft also had elliptical wings. The Spitfire wing was much thinner wi"
