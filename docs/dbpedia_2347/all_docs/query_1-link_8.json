        "text": "In 1938 the design bureau of Semyon Lavochkin, Vladimir Gorbunov and Mikhail Gudkov (LaGG) began work on a new fighter built of a type of plastic-impregnated wood. The smoothly polished prototype had reasonable speed but exhibited terrible handling, and poorer range, ceiling and maneuverability than promised. The roughly finished aircraft delivered to the frontline units were even worse, proving slower than the open-cockpit Polikarpov I-16 they replaced. There was no time for a redesign, so improvements were made progressively during production.\n\nThe LaGG-3 was essentially the series production LaGG-1, but was still not right. Nicknamed the 'Mortician's Friend', pilots joked that LaGG stood for 'Lakirovannii Garantirovannii Grob' or 'varnished, guaranteed coffin'. Despite its poor record, the LaGG-3 did excellent work in the defense of Leningrad, which was under siege from September 1941 to January 1943. In fact, many Soviet fighter pilots preferred it to the Hawker Hurricane, which was delivered to the Northern Front in some numbers from late 1941. The LaGG was more manoeuvrable than the Hurricane, and its cannon armament was more effective than the British fighter's machine guns. Without Gorbunov or Gudkov, Lavochkin went on to design the La-5FN and La-7, both very successful radial-engined fighters based on diminishing amounts of LaGG, and the all-new La-9 and -11.\n\nThe Soviet air force fighter specifications issued in 1938 for a less specialized tactical machine optimized for combat at around 11, 483 ft, led to proposals being submitted by the design bureaux of Lavochkin and Yakovlev. These were selected for further development, with the respective designations I-22 and I-26. The I-22 used the 1100-hp Klimov M-105P engine, with provision for a cannon to be mounted between the cylinder banks, and while the low wing monoplane configuration was conventional, the all-wood construction used an unorthodox compound birch ply. Metal was used only in the nose, which housed two 12.7-mm (0.5-in) machine guns, and on movable control surfaces. The first of a number of prototypes, soon to be designated LaGG-1, flew for the first time at the end of March 1940. It gave a maximum speed of 373 mph at 16,404ft but other aspects of performance as well as general flying qualities were extremely poor. However, the pressing need for new fighters, and the fact that the bureau had already established a production line for its design, led to a programme of improvements to salvage the design rather than scrap it.\n\nAmendments to the control systems, lightening of the structure, the use of 7.62-mm (0.30-in) machine-guns and the replacement of the original 23-mm (0.91-in) VYa cannon with a 20-mm (0.79-in) ShVAK, as well as the incorporation of extra fuel tanks in the wings cured the worst of the problems. Production of the revised design designated LaGG-3 began in January 1941. By the end of the year 2463 examples had been completed, and another 4065 followed before production ended in the second half of 1942. A number of changes were introduced, the major improvement being the 1260-hp M-105PF. Armament was subject to numerous variations, the original 23-mm cannon often being used, and one or both of the 7.62-mm machine-guns being replaced by the 12.7 -mm BS. Standard external stores attachment points allowed six RS-82 rockets, up to 441lb of bombs or an additional pair of machine-guns to be carried under the wings, with the alternative of drop-tanks for escort missions. At one stage a new version mounting a 37- mm (1.46-in) cannon was considered. Other abortive developments included using more powerful Klimov engines and fitting a ramjet booster.\n\nThe service introduction of the LaGG-3 in the first half of 1941 caused general dismay among the pilots called upon to fly it. The basic shortcomings of early models was compounded by poor finishing of production examples. In combat, the type proved markedly inferior to contemporary German fighters, and even the soundness of its construction was vitiated by the vulnerability of the radiator and wing tanks and the minimal armour protection for the pilot. After being switched in increasing numbers to the ground-attack role, to which it proved better suited, the LaGG-3 was replaced in both production and service from 1942 by the radial engined La-5.\n\nGradually the Soviet aircraft industry made up their initial disadvantage and, as the war followed its course, managed to produce excellent fighter aircraft. After Mikoyan and Gurevich, another designer was to become prominent at this time: Semyon Alexsevich Lavochkin. The first fighter which bore his name, even if its designation code also included the initials of his two assistants Gorbunov and Gudkov, was the LaGG-3, which made its appearance as a prototype on 30th March 1939. If it could not be considered exceptional, this aircraft played its part in the development of Soviet military aviation. For almost a year following Germany's attack, the Russians gained experience of mass production with the LaGG-3 which was produced and used in great numbers; and its airframe was still the basis of the La-5 and the La-7, aircraft which contributed significantly to re-establishing air supremacy on the eastern front.\n\nWhen the LaGG-3 went into the first battles of Russia's war in 1941, Semyon Lavochkin was already preparing an improved design. The factor which radically changed the unremarkable characteristics of the LaGG-3 was a new engine, the Shvetsov M 82 double-banked 1 6-cylinder radial engine which could give 1,600 hp on take-off in its initial version. It was not difficult to replace the Klimov liquid-cooled engine in the aircraft with the new air-cooled one and, from the very first test flights, it was obvious that the new version represented a marked improvement. The increased power and the saving in weight which resulted from the absence of a cooling system made up for the increase in drag caused by the enlarged frontal section, and yielded higher performance. In speed alone, an increase of about 31 mph was registered. Shvetsov-powered aircraft immediately replaced the LaGG-3 on the assembly lines and the first of these, which were really hybrids and were designated LaGG-5, simply consisted of LaGG-3 airframes in which the radial engine was installed. These aircraft reached the forces very quickly, whilst all awaited the completion of the definitive La-5 model, which saw action in the spring of 1942. Production quickly reached its maximum and, at the time of the Battle of Stalingrad, Lavochkin's new fighter was all along the front. Meanwhile the designer was working to complete an improved model, which reached the forces in 1943. This was the La-5FN, in which the principal differences lay in the adoption of a fuel injection engine, of greater power; in the progression from a completely wooden airframe to a mixed wood and metal airframe and in the improvement of some controls.\n\nSource: Lavochkin Lagg-3 | Aircraft |\n\nAttachments\n\nlagg3.jpg\n\nlagg3-915.jpg\n\nlagg301354.jpg\n\nlagg-3.jpg\n\nIn late 1942 service experience of the Yak-7 led to the call for increased fighter range. Thus a Yak-7B was modified with the provision for only one UBS machine gun and the addition of metal wing spars. Extended capacity fuel tanks were fitted into the larger volume of the inner wing. Furthermore, the rear fuselage fairing was removed and the aircraft was fitted with a bubble-top canopy (as per theYak-1 Â fighter). Named Yak-7DI, the aircraft had a cruising range of about 1,310 km using the M-105Pf engine (as compared with the Yak-7B's mere 900 km). The new aircraft entered serial production under designation «Yak-9» at Plant #153 in Novosibirsk. The first serial Yak-9s were powered with the M105Pf liquid cooled engine and VISH-61P controllable propeller. They differed externally from the prototype in having the one-piece main landing gear (MLG) doors, convex cockpit canopy, moved slightly forward, conventional exhaust pipes placed between upper and lower plates, convex shape oil cooler, rectangular supercharger wing-root air intake, a mechanical gun sight and double-wire aerial. The Yak-9 possessed two fuel tanks with a total capacity of 320 kg and 26-30 kg oil tank. There were no bomb racks beneath the wing. The armament comprised 20 mm ShVAK canon with 120 shells and 12,7 UBS machine gun with 200 shells. Having a maximum takeoff weight about 2875 kg, the Yak-9 could attain a maximum speed of 602 km/h at 4300 ò altitude. Production Yak-9s were initially allocated to units taking part in the Battle of Stalingrad in late December 1942. A total of 459 Yak-9s were produced by the Siberian Plants # 166 and # 153. In 1942 the aerodynamic performance of the Yak-9 was improved by fitting the M-106 engine but it did not result in serial production due to the M-106's unreliability.\n\nThe introduction of additional fuel tanks and larger oil tank was intended as an improvement to the aircraft's flight range characteristics. The Yak-9D powered with M-105PF engine, featured four 650L common volume fuel tanks and 48 kg oil tank. Having the same armament as the Yak-9 had, the Yak-9D showed flight radius of 1360 km and maximum takeoff weight of 3117 kg. However, usually because of weak radio equipment performance, the aircraft were not used with full fuel tanks. The long range capability was employed for bomber escort missions only. A total of 3058 Yak-9Ds were produced from March 1943 till June i C46. The Yak-9P featured the second 20 mm ShVAK cannon in place of UBS machine gun. The second cannon had as ammunition 165 shells. Having been rolled out in March 1943 it went to the Air Force Research Institute for evaluation from 17.03.43 until 8.04.43. Powered by the M-105 PF engine, the aircraft was equal to Yak-9's flight performance, however it did not see serial production because of aiming difficulties.\n\nThe Yak-9 TK powered with same engine could be fitted with different types of cannon while in service. The aircraft's design enabled the installation of 23 mm VYa-23, 37 mm NS-37 or 45 mm HS-45 canon . This experimental «transporter» was tested at Ai,' rce Research Institute in October 1943, but it was not adopted for serial production. In the winter of 1943/4 the Yakovlev design bureau decided to greatly improve the aircraft's fire power by installing the 45mm HS-45 cannon, with the intention of creating the ultimate Yak-9. The cannon featured barrel brake and had ammunition of shells. Furthermore the aircraft was fitted with a bullet-proof windscreen and AFT armored glass. But the VK-105PF engine was not powerful enough for a take off weight of 3028 kg. Compared to the earlier Yak-9s, the new fighter's speed was 27-40 km/h lower. The rate of climb dropped too. A total of 53 Yak-9Ks was produced in April-June 1944. Soviet pilots enjoyed flying the new aircraft but the Yak-9K was only used during the final period of the war in the hands of skilled pilots, who had previously flown theYak-9T.\n\nThe introduction of the M-105PD engine with E-100V supercharger was intended as an improvement for the aircraft's high altitude characteristics. Yakovlev received an order for five Yak-9PDs on 12 November 1942. They were allocated to the 12th Guard Fighter Wing for evaluation trials which were disappointing. Armed with 20mm ShVAK canon (120 shells) aircraft had a maximum ceiling of 11650 m. The improved M-105 PD powered Yak-9 was also unsuccessful on its trials at the Flight Research Institute on 3 August - 18 October, 1943. The maximum altitude was only 12500 m. The M-105PD engine was eventually replaced by the M-106 PV. It enabled the aircraft to show a service ceiling of 13000 m on 15-18 September 1943. But very high engines temperatures precluded the aircraft serving from in Red Army Air Force. In 1944 the Yak-9U was created. It climbed to altitudes of 12800 ò and even 13500 m. Powered by the M-106 PV engine with a methanol/water injection system, new ignition system and VISh-105 TL lightened propeller, the aircraft reached a speed of 620 km/h at 10500 m. It took 25 min to reach 11000 m altitude. The Yak-9U was armed with Sha-20 M super light canon (60 shells), it featured a 50% reduction in fuel capacity and the removal of some structural features , e.g. split flaps. The Yak-9U flew until the end of the war without gaining any significant combat experience.\n\nThe Yak-9R variant had a camera and mechanically controlled shutter in the lower fuselage. The control unit was placed in the starboard side of the cockpit. The Yak-9R short-range version was produced by serial plants or modified in the field. Built at Plant #166 in Omsk in 1943, the first aircraft was evaluated from 21 September until 10 October 1943. (The pilot was A.Prochakov, the engineerwasG.Sedov). Equipped with the AFA-IM camera, the aircraft's flight performance was equal to that of the conventional Yak-9. The operational altitude varied from 300 m to 3000 m. Produced at Plant # 166 in Omsk, the Yak-9R long range version was created using the Yak-9D as a basis. The aircraft carried theAFA-3S/50 camera. A maximum range of 1400 km was provided by 480 kg of fuel in four tanks. There were some long-range Yak-9Rs that did not carry UBS machine gun. These featured radio navigation equipment. Military trials undertaken showed the Yak-9R was more effective than the Pe-2 over targets with strong air defences. A total of 35 aircraft powered with VK-105PF engines had been produced by 13 August, 1943.\n\nFrom 18 December, 1944 until 20 February, 1945 the Yak-9B version was evaluated by the! 30th Fighter Division, the trials proving unsuccessful. Neverthe*less a military experimental series of 109 aircraft was produced. The fighter-bombers were allocated to this division, named «The small theater - to rthe front!» A rebuilt rear fuselage compartment enabled the Yak-9B to carry a 400 kg bomb behind the cockpit. Takeoff weight was increased to 3356 kg with a bombload of 200 kg. Bomb release could be achieved at dive an-jles of less than 45'. A 400 kg bomb load could not be released in this way and thus this bombing method was not used often. Furthermore, aircraft loaded with 400 kg bombs could not achieve sufficient longitudi*nal stability. Only the experimental Yak-9K (VIP version) created at Plant #153 in July 1944 was evaluated by test pilot A. Pashkevitch. The aircraft incorporated the Yak-9DD's fuel system. The Official State evaluations were not undertaken.\n\nThe Yak-9V (trainer) was rebuilt from the Yak-9T and the Yak-9M in serial production. The aircraft featured two cockpits with a common canopy and 20mm ShVAK canon with 90 shells. Instrument equipment was quite advanced. Testing was undertaken at the Air Force Research Institute by V. Ivanov from 10 April 1945 to17 April 1945. A total of 493 Yak-9Vs was produced. The Yak-9 was not the best Soviet fighter but, due chiefly to its ruggedness, stability, simplicity and cheapness of production, 16769 aircraft were delivered between 1942 and 1948, the largest number of one single design built for service in armed forces of the USSR.\n\nAttachments\n\nsyak-9.jpg\n\nYak-9 Russian pilot N.F. Kizim in Bulgaria.jpg\n\nIn the early 1930s, the bombers operated by the VVS (Voyenno Vozdushniye Sily / Red Air Force) were too slow to defend themselves from fighter attack. After the VVS issued a requirement for a bomber fast enough to take care of itself, in early 1934 the experimental design bureau (OKB in its Russian acronym) led by Andrei N. Tupolev came up with a proposal for a twin-engine monoplane bomber, with the design given the OKB designation of \"ANT-40\", where \"ANT\" stood for Tupolev's initials. The actual design work was done by a team under Alexander A. Archangelskiy. Following discussions, the VVS issued a more specific requirement to detail what was expected of the ANT-40. It was to have a maximum speed of 330 KPH (205 MPH), a service ceiling of 8,000 meters (26,250 feet), a range of 700 kilometers (435 miles), and a bombload of 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). Defensive armament was to consist of a pair of 7.62 millimeter ShKAS machine guns in the nose, plus a ShKAS machine gun on a flexible mount in both the dorsal and ventral positions. After fleshing out the design, authorization was granted for the construction of two prototypes, one with twin US-made Wright Cyclone air-cooled radials providing 545 kW (730 HP) each, and the other with French-made Hispano-Suiza 12Y vee-12 engines providing 580 kW (780 HP) each. The Cyclone-powered machine performed its initial flight on 7 October 1934; it was damaged on landing on 31 October and laid up for three months while it was being repaired. After returning to flight, it completed its trials at the end of July 1935, to then be assigned to experimental duties.\n\nThe Hispano-Suiza-powered machine performed its first flight on 30 December 1934. Although the inline engines were heavier than the radials and had required a larger wing on the second prototype, performance was outstanding, well better than spec. It too crashed on landing, on 3 March 1935, and was laid up for a time undergoing repairs. It returned to flight in April and completed trials a year later. Even before completion of trials, plans were moving ahead on production of the ANT-40, under the designation of \"SB\" -- for \"Skorostnoy Bombardirovschik / Fast Bomber\". The inline-powered variant was selected for manufacture, with a handful of evaluation machines delivered from the spring of 1936. By November 1936, production aircraft were on display for the public, flying over Red Square.\n\nIn 1938 the USSR had fought a border war with the Japanese in the Far East, with a second and more intensive round of fighting in the summer of 1939. The SB also acquitted itself well in the conflicts, but this was the effective zenith of the type. Aircraft design was proceeding very rapidly in the 1930s, and a machine that had been leading-edge in 1934 was fatally obsolescent five years later. Production of the SB continued, however, with over 6,600 built. At the outbreak of the war in Europe in September 1939, the SB was not only the most common bomber in Red Air Force service, it was likely more common than any other bomber in the world. Over 1,400 were available at the time of the German invasion on 22 June 1941; they survived the initial Luftwaffe blitz on Soviet airfields better than most combat types, being based farther to the rear, but they suffered terribly in attempts to slow down the invaders. The Germans found the SB \"lit up\" very quickly under fire due to its complete lack of fuel-system protection.\n\nLosses were then considerably reduced by going to night attacks, though bombing accuracy suffered as well. As better bombers were introduced, the SB was gradually relegated to rear-area transport operations, flying on in a lingering fashion through the war. The Germans and Finns also operated some captured SBs as utility machines. Despite the large number of SBs built, the type remains largely forgotten, probably because those who had anything to do with it didn't want to remember it. Some sources indicate that a transport variant of the SB was built, with M-100 powered machines given the designation \"PS-40\" and M-103 powered machines given the designation \"PS-41\". However, sources are not consistent on the matter and it is unclear if they were actually rolled out as transports, or were some level of conversion from bombers. A few \"USB\" trainers with a secondary cockpit and dual controls are known to have been built.\n\nArchangelskiy made several efforts to improve on the SB. The \"Archangelskiy MMN\" was flown in 1940 but turned out to have no advantage over the SB and was quickly abandoned. Incidentally, it seems that the Archangelskiy name was being used because in 1937 Tupolev had been arrested for \"treason\" -- the USSR under Stalin had a frighteningly broad definition of the term -- and for the moment he was discredited. Archangelskiy went back to the drawing board and came up with a substantially more modernized machine, the \"Ar-2\", with more powerful engines in streamlined nacelles, revised wings and nose, and dive brakes -- the Soviets were big on dive bombing at the time. Two prototypes were made, with initial flight in October 1940. It was put into limited production, with about 190 being built, but the comparable Petlyakov Pe-2 bomber was felt to have more potential and the Ar-2 was sidelined. Archangelskiy worked on a final variant, the \"SBB\", that had a significant resemblance to the Pe-2; however, the Pe-2 was still judged superior, and Archangelskiy was reassigned to aircraft support duties.\n\nAttachments\n\n1-SB-2M100A-VVS-Russia-1937-03.jpg\n\n1-SB-2M103-VVS-Red-8-captured-by-Wehrmacht-1941-01.jpg\n\n1-SB-2M103-VVS-Russia-1943-01.jpg\n\nThe Soviet government was very interested in antitank aircraft during the 1930s, and inconclusive work was done on the concept through most of the decade. In late 1938, as war was becoming more likely, another design request for an antitank aircraft was issued, and a team under Sergei V. Ilyushin at the Soviet Central Design Bureau came up with a new design, a two-seat aircraft designated the \"TsKB-55\", sometimes translated as \"CKB-55\". Two prototypes were ordered, the first of which first flew in October 1939. Another team under Pavel Sukhoi built a competing aircraft, the \"Su-6\", but the Sukhoi design was too late and the Ilyushin aircraft won the contest. Although initial evaluations had shown the TsKB-55 to be easy to fly, the tests also revealed some deficiencies. The initial prototype was modified within a few weeks to fix the problems and redesignated \"TsKB-57\". The revised first prototype was now a single-seater, and had a new engine since the original 1,030 kW (1,370 HP) Mikulin AM-35 vee-12 engine had not been powerful enough. Part of the problem was that the AM-35 had a supercharger, which wasn't needed for the low-level operations appropriate for a battlefield support aircraft and actually robbed the engine of power, so it was replaced by a similar 1,260 kW (1,680 HP) AM-38 with no supercharger. Flight trials with the new engine were performed in October 1940, and the aircraft proved much more satisfactory.\n\nIn the meantime, the second prototype, designated \"TsKB-55P\", had been completed, flying at the end of the December 1939. Since early evaluations of the first prototype had shown that the pilot had a poor forward view over the long inline vee engine, the TsKB-55P featured a lowered engine and a stepped-up cockpit, giving the aircraft a distinctive \"humpbacked\" look. The original design concept had been for the aircraft to be armed with four 7.62 millimeter ShKAS machine guns in the wings, but after some experiments the final fit was two 7.62 millimeter ShKAS machine guns and two 20 millimeter ShVAK cannon. The two prototypes demonstrated the usefulness of the Ilyushin concept, and Soviet factories began to set up for production in early 1941. The production aircraft was designated the \"Il-2 Shturmovik\" -- where \"Shturmovik\" meant \"Storm Bird\", a general term for a close-support aircraft. The original Il-2 was a single-seater. The forward fuselage around the engine and cockpit was built with 700 kilograms (1,543 pounds) of steel ranging from 5 to 12 millimeters (a fifth to half inch) thick. The engine radiators were placed behind the engine in the armored body, while the air intakes were placed on top of the nose. K-4 armor glass was used in the cockpit, with thicknesses from 55 to 65 millimeters (2.2 to 2.6 inches).\n\nThe aircraft featured tailwheel landing gear, with wide main undercarriage that was well suited for rough field operations. The main wheels retracted into fairings on the wing, with the tires left exposed. This configuration was partly devised to reduce damage to the aircraft on a \"wheels up\" landing. The Il-2 was armed, as mentioned, with two ShKAS 7.62 millimeter machine guns and two ShVAK 20 millimeter cannons; rails for eight 82 millimeter RS-82 rockets, making it one of the first attack aircraft to carry rockets; and light bombs. There were two small bomb bays in each wing inboard of the landing gear, and there were external racks under the wings as well. Total external warload was 400 kilograms (880 pounds). Level speed was 470 KPH (300 MPH), and operating altitude was 2,000 meters (6,600 feet). 249 Il-2s were built before the Germans invaded the USSR on 22 June 1941, inflicting a series of staggering military disasters on the Red Army. Only 18 Il-2s had been delivered to field units, pilots were not very familiar with the aircraft, and the Il-2 was not in a position to do the German invaders much damage for the time being. Soviet resistance through the summer of 1941 was uncoordinated and did little to slow the enemy down. By that time, it was obvious that the aircraft factories around Moscow and other centers in western Russia were greatly at risk, and in a monumental undertaking they were relocated beyond the Urals under the most difficult conditions. Ilyushin and his engineers were busy during this time, rethinking their production techniques, and only two months after the relocation had begun, Il-2s were again coming off the production line.\n\nAttachments\n\nalexander suvorov.jpg\n\navenger.jpg\n\nil-2 0056.jpg\n\nil-2 over berlin.jpg\n\nIlyushin Il-2 Shturmovik 001.jpg\n\nIlyushin Il-2 Shturmovik 002.jpg\n\nWhen the Germans began their drive on Stalingrad on 23 August 1942, Red resistance in the air was almost negligible, and the Luftwaffe pounded the city in major raids with effective impunity. As their ground offensive bogged down into savage house-to-house fighting in the city, however, the Soviets were building up their forces for a counterstroke. On 19 November 1942, the Red Army counterattacked in a successful drive to encircle the German 6th Army, supported heavily by artillery, tanks, and over 1,400 aircraft. White-painted Shturmoviks were the most prominent participant in the battle in the air, performing roughly a thousand sorties over the next four days, skimming in at altitudes of 20 meters (64 feet) or less to smash German armor, artillery, and infantry. Weather was so bad during the initial days of the counterattack that the Luftwaffe was unable to respond to the Soviet air onslaught. When the weather cleared on 24 November, German fighters began to respond more effectively, but the Red air fleets kept up the pressure, flying 6,000 sorties over the next week. Through December into January 1943, the hammering continued. The Luftwaffe attempted to resupply their encircled troops from the air, but even if there had been no air opposition, there wasn't the airlift capability to do the job, and for the first time in the war the Red Air Force was effectively challenging German air superiority. On 2 February 1943, what remained of the encircled German 6th Army surrendered. The Shturmovik had been an important element in the victory, and as fighting continued into the spring of 1943, so did improvements to this vital Soviet weapon. Most significantly, in some production the two 23 millimeter VJa cannon were replaced by a pair of long-barreled 37 millimeter NS-37 cannon, with this variant known as the \"Il-2-37\". Each gun had 50 rounds of ammunition. This variant saw service, but it did not prove highly successful since the big guns had a hefty recoil and badly affected the aircraft's handling.\n\nThe Il-2M3 was also equipped with other ordnance. One was the PTAB anti-tank bomblet, which was a 2.5 kilogram (5.5 pound) hollow-charge munition. Up to a total 192 PTAB bomblets could be loaded into the Shturmovik's four little bomb bays, and could be scattered over enemy armored columns. Another weapon was the DAG-10 grenade launcher, an odd \"aerial-mine\" device that would eject grenades on little parachutes in the path of a pursuer and which, surprisingly, Soviet records say was very effective. Many Il-2s also began to incorporate all-metal wings and tail surfaces. These improvements were just in time. During that spring, Hitler had planned an offensive to cut off a huge Soviet salient in German lines, centered around the small city of Kursk. However, the operation, codenamed CITADEL, was postponed until that summer so that the new heavily-armored Panther and Tiger tanks could participate, The Soviets, assisted by a spy codenamed \"Lucy\" whose network provided detailed intelligence on German intentions, were kept perfectly informed of enemy intentions, building their forces in and behind the Kursk salient to high levels. When the Germans attacked on 5 July 1943, the Red Army was ready for them. Or at least thought they were. The Soviets attempted to launch a preemptive air strike early that morning, but the Germans quickly sensed the move and sent up their own fighters, destroying 70 Red aircraft at little loss to themselves. German Army ground units made progress in their attack on the Soviet flanks. Within a day, however, the Soviets rallied, and on 7 July 1943 they responded with overwhelming attacks that smashed German panzer divisions. The Shturmoviks were in their element and delivered hammer blows to enemy tanks.\n\nBy this time, Shturmovik pilots had refined their tactics. Flying in attack groups of 8 to 12, in open country they would attack \"soft\" targets such as infantry or trucks by simply skimming in at 5 to 10 meters (16 to 32 feet) altitude. Against stationary \"hard\" targets such as bunkers they would use near-vertical dive-bombing attacks. Against armor moving in a column, they would proceed straight down the column or weave over it in a shallow S-curve, dropping their PTAB antitank bombs from an altitude of 100 to 150 meters (320 to 480 feet). Against armor in offensive formation, however, they preferred the \"Circle of Death\" attack, in which a Shturmovik group would flank around the enemy and then peel off successively, each Il-2 making a shallow diving attack, then pulling up and around for another pass. The beauty of the Circle of Death was that it kept the enemy under continuous fire for as long as the aircraft had fuel and ammunition. One Shturmovik pilot, Senior Lieutenant Alexander Yefinov, wrote: \"We usually tried to attack from the rear, where the armor was thinner and where the most vulnerable components of the vehicles were located: the engines and the gas tanks.\" He proudly added that \"the effect was staggering as Hitler's celebrated Tigers burned under the strikes.\" Il-2M3s armed with 37 millimeter guns were able to destroy Panthers and Tigers with their guns alone, blasting into their thinner top armor.\n\nThe Shturmovik's armor made it generally invulnerable to anything less than 20 millimeter fire. Even that had to be accurate and precise to do the aircraft damage, and an Il-2 moving fast and jinking wildly at low altitude was very hard to hit. Despite their survivability, Shturmovik losses were high, for they fought in the teeth of the worst combat with no place to hide. Soviet factories continued churn out the simple, reliable aircraft, and those that fell were quickly replaced with new aircraft with weaknesses eliminated. Red pilots refined their tactics and training to help reduce the losses. The Kursk salient became a storm of combat, but on 13 July Hitler, confronted with the Anglo-American invasion of Sicily, called off CITADEL. The Battle of Kursk was a significant Soviet victory, and would soon lead to rolling back the Germans all along the Eastern Front. The Shturmovik had made a major contribution to the success of Red arms. Il-2s destroyed 70 tanks of the 9th Panzer Division in a mere 20 minutes, inflicted losses of 2,000 men and 270 tanks in two hours of attack on the 3rd Panzer Division, and effectively destroyed the 17th Panzer Division in four hours of strikes, smashing 240 vehicles out of their total of almost 300.\n\nAt the end of 1943, most of the USSR was back in Soviet hands. Only Belorussia remained under German occupation. To dislodge them, Stalin and his generals planned a massive offensive under the code name BAGRATION, after a Czarist general of the Napoleonic wars. BAGRATION jumped off on 22 June 1944, the third anniversary of the German invasion. More than 6,000 planes participated, with a third of them Shturmoviks. Yefinov wrote: \"With precise, low-altitude strikes, they completely destroyed the fascists' concrete emplacements, smoked them out of their concrete pillboxes and, with cannon, rocket and machine-gun fire, destroyed Hitler's soldiers.\" By this time, the Shturmovik's arsenal had been upgraded still further, with the 132 millimeter RS-132 rocket providing greater firepower than the older RS-82 weapon. The new rockets carried either a hollow-charge warhead for attacking armor, or a high-explosive warhead for strikes on buildings and fortifications.\n\nBy 4 July 1944, the operation was over except for the mopping up. German Army Group Center had suffered 300,000 casualties and had been effectively destroyed. The Germans had been driven out of the USSR, and now the Soviet war machine was ready to drive into Eastern Europe in pursuit. Once again, the Il-2 had been a critical weapon in the victory. To Shturmovik pilots, the aircraft was simply the feminine \"Ilyusha\". To the soldiers on the ground it was the \"Hunchback\", or the \"Flying Tank\", or, the greatest of compliments, the \"Flying Infantryman\". The enemy, it is said, called it \"Schwarz Todt\", the Black Death. That nickname may have just been an invention of Soviet propaganda, but the Germans certainly had reason to fear and dread the Il-2.\n\nSource: The Il-2 Shturmovik\n\nAttachments\n\nIlyushin Il-2 Shturmovik 003.jpg\n\nIlyushin Il-2 Shturmovik 005.jpg\n\nPersonnel of the 566th Attack Regiment, and IL-2.jpg\n\nrevenge barinov.jpg\n\nww2history-kyostikarhila-il2_utissa.jpg\n\nLend-Lease was the program under which the United States of America supplied the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, China, Free France, and other Allied nations with materiel between 1941 and 1945. It was signed into law on March 11, 1941, a year and a half after the outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 but nine months before the U.S. entered the war in December 1941. Formally titled An Act to Further Promote the Defense of the United States, the Act effectively ended the United States' pretense of neutrality. A total of $50.1 billion (equivalent to $647 billion today) worth of supplies were shipped: $31.4 billion to Britain, $11.3 billion to the Soviet Union, $3.2 billion to France, and $1.6 billion to China. Reverse Lend-Lease comprised services such as rent on air bases that went to the U.S., and totaled $7.8 billion; of this, $6.8 billion came from the British and the Commonwealth. The terms of the agreement provided that the materiel were to be used until time for their return or destruction. Supplies after the termination date were sold to Britain at a discount for £1.075 billion using long-term loans from the United States. Canada operated a similar program that sent $4.7 billion in supplies to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The United States did not charge for aid supplied under this legislation. This program was a decisive step away from non-interventionist policy, which had dominated United States foreign relations since the end of World War I, towards international involvement.\n\nAmerican deliveries to the Soviet Union can be divided into the following phases:\n\n- \"pre Lend-lease\" 22 June 1941 to 30 September 1941 (paid for in gold)\n\n- first protocol period from 1 October 1941 to 30 June 1942 (signed 1 October 1941)\n\n- second protocol period from 1 July 1942 to 30 June 1943 (signed 6 October 1942)\n\n- third protocol period from 1 July 1943 to 30 June 1944 (signed 19 October 1943)\n\n- fourth protocol period from 1 July 1944, (signed 17 April 1945), formally ended 12 May 1945 but deliveries continued for the duration of the war with Japan (which the Soviet Union entered on the 8 August 1945) under the \"Milepost\" agreement until 2 September 1945 when Japan capitulated. On 20 September 1945 all Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union was terminated.\n\nDelivery was via the Arctic Convoys, the Persian Corridor, and the Pacific Route. The Arctic route was the shortest and most direct route for lend-lease aid to the USSR, though it was also the most dangerous. Some 3,964,000 tons of goods were shipped by the Arctic route; 7% was lost, while 93% arrived safely.[20] This constituted some 23% of the total aid to the USSR during the war. The Persian Corridor was the longest route, and was not fully operational until mid 1942. Thereafter it saw the passage of 4,160,000 tons of goods, 27% of the total. The Pacific Route opened in August 1941, but was affected by the start of hostilities between Japan and the US; after December 1941, only Soviet ships could be used, and, as Japan and the USSR observed a strict neutrality towards each other, only non-military goods could be transported.[21] Nevertheless, some 8,244,000 tons of goods went by this route, 50% of the total.\n\nThe Bell P-63 Kingcobra (Model 24) was a United States fighter aircraft developed in World War II from the Bell P-39 Airacobra in an attempt to correct that aircraft's deficiencies. Although the aircraft was not accepted for combat use by the United States Army Air Forces, it was successfully adopted by the Soviet Air Force.\n\nThe first version to be supplied in quantity to the USSR was the P-63A-7 with a higher vertical tail, and reinforced wings and fuselage. The fuselage proved to require strengthening, consequently in October 1944, a reinforcement kit for operational P-63s was developed. Air Transport Command ferry pilots, including U.S. women pilots of the WASP program, picked up the planes at the Bell factory at Niagara Falls, New York, and flew them to Great Falls, Montana and then onward via the Alaska-Siberia Route (ALSIB), through Canada, over Alaska where Russian ferry pilots, many of them women, would take delivery of the aircraft at Nome and fly them to the Soviet Union over the Bering Strait. A total of 2,397 (2,672, according to other sources) such aircraft were delivered to USSR, out of the overall 3,303 production aircraft (72.6%).\n\nBy a 1943 agreement, P-63s were disallowed for Soviet use against Germany and were supposed to be concentrated in the Soviet Far East for an eventual attack on Japan. However, there are many unconfirmed reports from both the Soviet and German side that P-63s did indeed see service against the Luftwaffe. Most notably, one of Pokryshkin's pilots reports in his memoirs published in the 1990s that the entire 4th GvIAP was secretly converted to P-63s in 1944, while officially still flying P-39s. One account states they were in action at Königsberg, in Poland and in the final assault on Berlin. There are German reports of P-63s shot down by both fighters and flak. Nevertheless, all Soviet records show nothing but P-39s used against Germany.\n\nIn general, official Soviet histories played down the role of Lend-Lease supplied aircraft in favor of local designs, but it is known that the P-63 was a successful ground attack aircraft in Soviet service. The Soviets developed successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell fighters and P-39s scored a surprising number of aerial victories over German aircraft, mostly Junkers Ju-87 Stukas and bombers but including many advanced fighters as well. Low ceilings, short missions, good radios, a sealed and warm cockpit and ruggedness contributed to their effectiveness. To pilots who had once flown the tricky Polikarpov I-16, the aerodynamic quirks of the mid-engined aircraft were unimportant. In the Far East, P-63 and P-39 aircraft were used in the Soviet invasion of Manchukoku and northern Korea.\n\nIn the Pacific theatre, the Kingcobras flew escort, close air support and ground attack missions. The Soviet P-63s achieved their first air victory on 15 August 1945, when Lejtenant I. F. Miroshnichenko from 17th IAP/190 IAD, shot down a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa Army fighter off the coast of North Korea. Sufficient aircraft continued in use after the war for them to be given the NATO reporting name of Fred. By 9 May 1945, operational units had still 1,148 Kingcobras on strength. On 8 October 1950, two USAF F-80Cs from 49 FG breached the USSR's border and attacked Sukhaya Rechka airfield, making two strafing runs before returning to their home base. Although Soviet sources claim the attack was intentional, the pilots claimed it was a result of a navigational error. The airfield belonged to the VVS TOF, but it was occupied by the 821 IAP / 190 IAD. Mostly aircraft of the 1st Squadron of 821 IAP were hit with 12 P-63s damaged, one P-63 burned to the ground while the other damaged aircraft were able to be repaired. No human losses were suffered.\n\nSources: Bell P-63 Kingcobra - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAttachments\n\np-63 kingcobra.jpg\n\nThe Soviet Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily (VVS; \"Military Air Forces\") and Morskaya Aviatsiya (MA; \"Naval Air Service\") also referred to P-40s as Tomahawks and Kittyhawks. In fact, the Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk/Kittyhawk was the first Allied fighter supplied to the USSR under the Lend-Lease agreement. Their units used 2,097 146 Tomahawks were shipped from Great Britain and 49 more arrived from the US, many of them coming incomplete, lacking machine guns and even the lower half of the engine cowling. In late September 1941, the first 48 P-40s were assembled and checked in USSR. Test flights showed some manufacturing defects: generator and oil pump gears and generator shafts failed repeatedly, which led to emergency landings. The test report indicated that the Tomahawk was inferior to Soviet \"M-105P-powered production fighters in speed and rate of climb. However, it has good short field performance, horizontal manoeuvrability, range and endurance\". Nevertheless, Tomahawks and Kittyhawks were used against the Germans. The 126th IAP fighting on the Western and Kalinin fronts were the first unit to receive the P-40. The regiment entered action on 12 October 1941. By 15 November 1941, that unit had shot down 17 German aircraft. However, Lt (SG) Smirnov noted that the P-40 armament was sufficient for strafing enemy lines but rather ineffective in aerial combat. Another pilot, S.G. Ridnyy (Hero of Soviet Union), remarked that he had to shoot half the ammunition at 50–100 meters (164–339 ft) to shoot down an enemy aircraft.\n\nIn January 1942, some 198 aircraft sorties were flown (334 flying hours) and 11 aerial engagements were conducted, in which five Bf 109s, one Ju 88, and one He 111 were downed. These statistics reveal a surprising fact: it turns out that the Tomahawk was fully capable of successful air combat with a Bf 109. The reports of pilots about the circumstances of the engagements confirm this fact. On 18 January 1942, Lieutenants S. V. Levin and I. P. Levsha (in pair) fought an engagement with seven Bf 109s and shot down two of them without loss. On 22 January, a flight of three aircraft led by Lieutenant E. E. Lozov engaged 13 enemy aircraft and shot down two Bf 109Es, again without loss. Altogether, in January, two Tomahawks were lost; one downed by German antiaircraft artillery and one lost to Messerschmitts.\n\nThe Soviets stripped down their P-40s significantly for combat, in many cases removing the wing guns altogether in P-40B/C types, for example. Soviet Air Force reports state that they liked the range and fuel capacity of the P-40 which were superior to most of the Soviet fighters, though they still preferred the P-39. Soviet pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov recalled: \"The cockpit was vast and high. At first it felt unpleasant to sit waist-high in glass, as the edge of the fuselage was almost at waist level. But the bullet-proof glass and armoured seat were strong and visibility was good. The radio was also good. It was powerful, reliable, but only on HF (high frequency). The American radios did not have hand microphones but throat microphones. These were good throat mikes: small, light and comfortable.\" The biggest complaint of some Soviet airmen was its poor climb rate and problems with maintenance, especially with burning out the engines. VVS pilots usually flew the P-40 at War Emergency Power settings while in combat, this would bring the acceleration and speed performance closer to that of their German rivals, but could burn out engines in a matter of weeks. They also had difficulty with the more demanding requirements for fuel quality and oil purity of the Allison engines. A fair number of burnt out P-40s were re-engined with Soviet Klimov engines but these performed relatively poorly and were relegated to rear area use.\n\nThe P-40 saw the most front line use in Soviet hands in 1942 and early 1943. It was used in the northern sectors and played a significant role in the defense of Leningrad. The most numerically important types were P-40B/C, P-40E and P-40K/M. By the time the better P-40F and N types became available, production of superior Soviet fighters had increased sufficiently so that the P-40 was replaced in most Soviet Air Force units by the Lavochkin La-5 and various later Yakovlev types. In spring 1943, Lt D.I. Koval of the 45th IAP gained ace status on the North-Caucasian front, shooting down six German aircraft flying a P-40. Some Soviet P-40 squadrons had good combat records. They provided close air support as well as air-to-air capability while Soviet pilots became aces on the P-40, not as many as on the P-39 Airacobra, which was the most numerous Lend Lease fighter used by the Soviet Union. However Soviet commanders considered the Kittyhawk to significantly outclass the Hurricane, although it was \"not in the same league as the Yak-1\".\n\nSource: Curtiss P-40 Warhawk - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAttachments\n\nCurtiss P-40 Warhawk 001.jpg\n\nCurtiss P-40 Warhawk 002.jpg"
