        "text": "Vadim Fadeev was born on December 25, 1917 in the village of Fedkino, now the Terengulsky district of the former Ulyanovsk region, in a family of teachers. He lived in Kuibyshev, graduated from the 3 courses of the Construction Institute and the local flying club, where he was left as an instructor. Vadim was well educated, well-read, sang beautifully, very handsome - almost two meters tall, blond with blue eyes. In 1940 he was drafted into the Red Army, graduated from the Chkalovsky military aviation school for pilots.\n\nOn the fronts of the Great Patriotic War since August 1941. At first he fought as part of the 131st Fighter Aviation Regiment, flying an I-16 aircraft. Once, in the region of Kodyma (Moldova), V.I. Fadeev attacked a column of Romanian cavalrymen with a group of fighters. Having shot all the cartridges, he went down to the very ground and chopped the riders with the propeller of the aircraft.\n\nIn 1943, Lieutenant Fadeev arrived in the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, quickly mastered new equipment, became an excellent lead pair, and then a squadron commander. Vadim carefully kept the document issued by the commander of the Air Army - an order to issue him a double food ration and a permit for individual tailoring of clothes and shoes. From the finished uniform, nothing suited him - everything was not enough.\n\nHis brilliant abilities as a fighter pilot were fully revealed in the battles in the Kuban. Possessing great physical strength and endurance, he made 5-6 sorties a day. He often shot down several aircraft per flight, and once in one week he destroyed 10 aircraft personally and 1 in a group. By the end of April 1943, Captain V.I. Fadeev made 394 sorties, conducted 43 air battles and personally shot down 17 enemy aircraft.\n\nOne of the features of his character was a dismissive attitude to danger and an underestimation of the enemy's forces. Sometimes he behaved simply recklessly - he could, having abandoned the management of the group, chase after a single \"Messer\"; turn on the transmitter in flight and perform arias from operas; perform \"circus\" tricks at low altitude over the airfield. For the sake of mischief, he grew his beard with a \"shovel\" - \"for the fear of enemies,\" as he said. His broad Volga nature and confidence in his outstanding abilities often manifested themselves in an overestimation of his capabilities.\n\nVadim Fadeev died in an unequal air battle on May 5, 1943. In the last sortie, he, having shown his often inherent self-confidence, decided to act independently, and this was his fatal mistake. Breaking away from the main group of our fighters, led by A.I. Pokryshkin, he and his wingman Andrey Trud met a group of 12 Me-109 fighters. In this battle, Fadeev shot down 2 aircraft, but was seriously wounded and died returning to his airfield.\n\nBy that time, he had made more than 400 sorties and conducted 51 air battles. He had 21 personal and 1 group victories on his account (other figures are given in some sources, for example, 17 personal and 3 group victories). Assault strikes destroyed up to 90 vehicles, 15 guns, 25 wagons and a lot of enemy manpower.\n\nOn May 24, 1943, for courage and military prowess shown in battles with enemies, Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev was posthumously awarded the title of Hero Soviet Union. During the war, he was awarded the Orders of Lenin, the Red Banner (twice), and medals. He was buried in the central park of the village of Kievskoye, Krasnodar Territory. Streets in Kuibyshev and Kievskaya bear his name.\n\nBest of the day\n\nA true legend of the global pop scene\n\nVisited:212\n\nDisgusting collection, or how to become famous\n\nVisited:164\n\nKarl Habsburg-Lothringen\n\nMy next stopping point on the route Krasnodar - Anapa unexpectedly became the village of Fadeevo, which is located a few kilometers from the village of Varenikovskaya in the Krasnodar Territory. Everyone driving a car along the highway past the village can see the erected bust of the Hero of the Soviet Union, fighter pilot Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev, after whom this small village is named.\n\n1.\n\nHere is his short biography:\n\nIN AND. Fadeev was born on December 25, 1917 in the village of Fedkino, the former Ulyanovsk region, into a family of teachers. He lived in Kuibyshev, graduated from the 3 courses of the Construction Institute and the local flying club, where he was left as an instructor. Since 1940, in the ranks of the Red Army, he graduated from the Chkalovsky military aviation school for pilots.\n\nWith the outbreak of war on August 19, 1941, Lieutenant V.I. Fadeev ended up on the front of the Great Patriotic War.\n\nIn 1943, Lieutenant V.I. Fadeev arrived in the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, commanded by A.I. Pokryshkin. He quickly mastered a new technique - the P-39 Airacobra aircraft, became an excellent leader of the pair, and then a squadron commander.\n\nBy the end of April 1943, the squadron commander of the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment of the Guard, Captain V.I. Fadeev, made 394 sorties. After 43 air battles, he shot down 17 enemy aircraft.\n\n2. For the sake of a joke, he grew a long beard, for which he received his call sign \"Beard\".\n\n3. It was in the Kuban that Fadeev most fully revealed his talent as a fighter pilot. Possessing great physical strength and endurance, he made 5-6 sorties a day. Sometimes he shot down several planes per flight. Most often he flew with his wingman Andrey Trud\n\n4. Plane V.I. Fadeev carried tail number 37, recognizable for German pilots operating in the Kuban.\n\nMay 5, 1943 V.I. Fadeev died in an air battle. Here is how the military chronicle describes this event:\n\nVadim Fadeev died in an unequal air battle on May 5, 1943. In the last sortie, he, having shown his often inherent self-confidence, decided to act independently, and this was his fatal mistake. Breaking away from the main group of our fighters, led by A.I. Pokryshkin, he and his wingman Andrey Trud met a group of 12 Me-109 fighters. In this battle, Fadeev shot down 2 aircraft, but was seriously wounded and died returning to his airfield.\n\nOnly on July 11, Soviet intelligence officers accidentally discovered him in the Adagum floodplains. Vadim lay on the wing of the plane, leaning his back against the fuselage. His heroic chest was pierced right through by a shell.\n\nOn May 24, 1943, for courage and military prowess shown in battles with enemies, he was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nLater I learned that V.I. Fadeev was buried in the central park of the village of Kievskoye (the very one where the MiG-21 monument was erected, which was discussed in the previous entry).\n\n5. In the village of Fadeevo, on a hill, there is a well-groomed monument to V.I. Fadeev and the same one was installed in front of the entrance to the local school ... so that they remember ...\n\nInstead of an epilogue\n\nVadim, when approaching the Messers, saw German pilots. One flew very close. On board the Me-109, a red dragon caught my eye. And as soon as they dispersed, through the hubbub of shouts and commands, Vadim heard a burr:\n\n- \"Beard\", \"Beard\"! Let's fight!\n\nBased on resources.\n\nAfter the war, friends from the front, who loved this house so much, gathered, a moment came, and, looking into her husband’s eyes, Maria asked him: “Sasha, imagine that now… Vadim would appear?”\n\nHe would have appeared with a bang, filling the rooms with his magnificent Chaliapin-style roaring bass. He breathed joyful animation into the guests, riveted everyone's attention to himself with a well-aimed joke on the topic of the day, an artistic recitation of poetry or Prince Igor's opera aria: \"Oh, give me, give me freedom ...\". He would have guessed the mood of everyone at once, only briefly looking at him with a cheerful penetrating look of large gray-blue eyes ...\n\nAnd for each he would find a sincere word. Vadim! The pilots smiled only when they heard his approach. Only Vadim Fadeev, with his jokes, could at dawn and five languishing tension before a sortie into the Cuban sky.\n\nA constellation of aces fought next to Pokryshkin, some of them had a larger number of downed aircraft in 1945 than Vadim Fadeev, but Alexander Ivanovich said only about the latter: “He could become a Hero three times.”\n\nProbably, nowhere and never has there been such a fighter pilot: almost two meters tall and weighing about a hundred kilograms, but at the same time a slender, athletic build. When asked how he fits on the plane, Vadim, laughing, compared himself to a folding wooden ruler:\n\n“True, during the battle, sometimes you have to look for an additional point of support, resting your head on the cabin ceiling.” At first, he was sent to bombers, where there is room for a giant at the helm, but Fadeev won the right to be a fighter. He had a sharp reaction, the ability to maneuver with an overload inaccessible to others. According to his warehouse, Vadim was a fighter - a lone swift warrior.\n\nEach of his appearances on the roads of war, or later, on the pages of memories, is unique, imbued with a special meaning. This property is only for outstanding people.\n\nPokryshkin and Fadeev knew about each other even before the first meeting at the division headquarters, where Alexander Ivanovich received his first order. Correspondents wrote about the best fighters, the rumor about them was passed from mouth to mouth in the regiments, in contrast to the dryish newspaper lines, gaining a lively brilliance and charm.\n\nThey started talking about Fadeev shortly after his arrival at the front on August 10, 1941. Here are two nines of I-16s successfully storming a convoy. Vadim dives six times, setting cars on fire. Then, in parting, it goes up vertically, triumphantly showing the immaculate Immelman to the defeated enemy. Returning to the airfield, the fighters see a column of refugees cut down by the Romanian cavalry in the steppe in the Kodyma region. Having caught up with the cavalrymen, they shoot them with the remaining shells and cartridges. Having used up the ammunition load, Fadeev, in righteous anger at low level flight, cuts down an officer with a propeller. On the I-16 propeller blade, after it landed, the mechanics found a piece of the occupier's cranial bone. It was not possible to hear or read about the second such example during the war years ...\n\nOn November 27, 1941, Vadim landed an aircraft damaged during an attack on a neutral zone near the Five Brothers mound, northwest of Rostov-on-Don. Having managed to evaluate the German defense during planning, Fadeev ran to the infantry trench under fire. After a conversation with the commander, the giant with a machine gun in his hand left the dugout and with his powerful bass raised the battalion to the attack: “Forward! For the Motherland! The plane was saved, the altitude was taken. Taken by surprise, the Germans were unable to resist. The commander of the infantry division reported to the 446th air regiment about the feat of Sergeant Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev.\n\nIn the winter of 1942, Fadeev, who did not have enough fuel when returning from reconnaissance, landed at the airfield of the Pokryshkin squadron. Already a lieutenant with the Order of the Red Banner on his chest, he struck the young pilots with a face disfigured by repeated frostbites. Fadeev did not spare himself, he flew with an open canopy in any frost. In the dining room, the guest stunned the commander of the BAO with a paper signed by General S. A. Krasovsky himself, with an order to issue a double portion to the owner of this document. After lunch, Vadim completed the impression he had made by taking off with his usual aerobatics chic.\n\nAt the very first meeting with Pokryshkin, Fadeev said:\n\n\"Ready to be a friend!\" Alexander Ivanovich recalled that day with the words: “Fate connected our path ...” Having met again already in the Caucasus, near the Caspian Sea, in August 1942, two pilots hugged, clapped each other on the shoulders for a long time ... Having learned that Fadeev was sent to the reserve regiment , Pokryshkin first of all calls him to his 16th Guards. \"I agree! Let's fight together!\" Vadim answers. Isaev gives the go-ahead for the translation, overwhelmed by the power of Fadeev’s handshake: “Well, what a power!” To Figichev’s question: “Why did you grow a beard?” followed by words that caused general laughter: \"For the fear of enemies!\"\n\nThus began the military friendship of the two Ivanovichs - Alexander Pokryshkin and Vadim Fadeev. Ever since epic times in Russia, leading all-round defense from enemy raids, twinning, brotherhood of the cross appears. Two warriors, Cossacks, exchanged pectoral crosses as a sign of fraternal devotion and fidelity to the coffin. On the chest of the Soviet pilots were in 1942 the Order of Lenin and the Red Banner, but the essence of their friendship remained the same ...\n\nVadim is the first to fully comprehend Pokryshkin's \"science of winning\" in the air, becomes a like-minded friend, instantly grasps his ideas and developments even before they are triumphantly tested in practice.\n\nProbably, it was Vadim, with his sensitivity and irresistible love of life, who saved his friend in the darkest hour of his life, when Pokryshkin, without waiting for the tribunal, wanted to end his own life. “What are you thinking, Sasha! Stop fooling around! More than once we will fight together against the Nazis!”\n\nOn the boat, Pokryshkin and Fadeev went to the Caspian Sea, conducted their conversations, as Alexander and Stepan Suprun once spoke in the stormy Black Sea. Vadim was the first to whom Pokryshkin told about his relationship with Maria, about his desire to start a family. “Vadim,” Alexander Ivanovich recalled, “was able to quickly eliminate the misunderstandings that arose in our relationship with Maria with a joke, a challenge to a frank conversation.” In Makhachkala, Fadeev sat a friend and his beloved in front of a photographer and presciently said: “Now take a picture of them together! You do not see that the girl is embarrassed. I assure you that they will keep the photograph you take until the end of their lives ... ”M.K. Pokryshkina wrote in her book:\n\n“Vadim's prediction came true. This photo is now in Sasha's office in a place of honor, and every time I look at it, I mentally thank Vadim ... \"\n\nYes, this man could leave an indelible mark on his soul ... The political officer of the regiment, M.A. Pogrebnoy, wore a beard for five years as a sign of his memory. Hero of the Soviet Union Arkady Fedorov, who became friends with Vadim at the end of 1941, recalled 20 years later: “I still often consult with him mentally when I need to make some important decision.” Hero of the Soviet Union Nikolai Iskrin, his fellow countryman from Kuibyshev (Samara), said: “From the whole appearance of Vadim Fadeev, the mighty power of a real Volga hero blew. About people like him, poems, legends and songs were composed, artists dedicated their canvases to them. In our regiment, Vadim was everyone's favorite. His image will never be erased from my memory.\n\nYes, he was a Volgar, grew up on the banks of this sacred Russian river, mother and nurse. Many talents and a number of famous pilots gave Russia the world of the great Volga full of originality. Nesterov and Chkalov have already been mentioned. The coryphaeus of long-range aviation, the son of the captain of the Volga steamer Alexander Golovanov, was also born here, also unusually handsome, two meters tall, generously endowed with intelligence and iron strength.\n\n... Vadim knew the nature of his native river well. As a high school student, he got the right to drive a motorboat, loved the open space, fighting a strong wave, spray flying over his head. Working as a mail carrier, he once persuaded the postman to cross, despite the approach of a thunderstorm. The storm caught the boat on the rapids of the river, it was already impossible to turn. The postman survived the stress, Vadim bawled out songs with delight ...\n\nAt the age of 11, Vadim, as indicated in the description, \"according to the data of a pedagogical examination in mental development, gives an increase of one and a half years.\" And then he studies well, reads a lot, is fond of Mayakovsky's poetry, music, and opera. Father Ivan Vasilievich, a major civil engineer, wanted to direct his son in his footsteps, and Vadim entered the construction institute, but in his second year he stopped attending classes. In the 1930s, aviation had no rivals among young talents with excellent health ... In the flying club, a new set of pilots was planned only a year later. In a month, Vadim masters the six-month-long courses of drivers at Osoaviakhim, works on a bread van, and then on an ambulance more suitable for his character. The father does not give up, he agrees with the dean on the admission of his son to the session. That one, having not attended a single lecture in the semester, passes the session with “excellent”! And still leaves the third year. All evenings he studies aviation-technical literature. On his birthday, friends wrote to Vadim: “You, born on the great days of our era; you - great person in form, structure and complexion; you, whose foot has no equal; you, who are doomed to great torment in search of size 49 boots and are deprived of the opportunity to visit the ice rink; you, who to this day have lived in the world for exactly two dozen years, in the days of grandiose victories on the entire socialist front, accept our sincere congratulations ... \".\n\nIn 1938, Fadeev, again, excellently graduated from the Kuibyshev flying club, was left there as an instructor, and only in January 1940 was released to the Ulyanovsk flight school. From there he was sent to the Chkalovsk (Orenburg) school. The uniform, which the new cadet called \"armor\", he had to sew - the right size was not found. When was the double ration approved. An old photograph has preserved one of the jokes of a young strong man - Fadeev proudly, with a grin, holds on his hands and shoulders three classmates with the usual build with militantly mischievous faces.\n\nIn the school, the foreman “knocks the crap out” of an unbridled cadet for two months. But the nature of the Volga rebel, as Pokryshkin later identified his friend, no, no, but made itself felt ...\n\nHaving mastered and looked around, Fadeev externally passes the theory exams with excellent marks, overtaking everyone; without \"export\" makes an independent flight. In the newspaper of the school, an article is printed about him with a portrait called \"Steel Will\". After taking off on the I-16, Vadim writes to his parents:\n\n“Oh, and good! When you fly and make various “slanders”, when it seems that the car is me myself ... The car is tense to the extreme, the engine roars so that it becomes scary for those standing on the ground - no matter how it falls apart. But the main goal is to test yourself during overloads in order to take everything that it is capable of from the car. Surprising in these lines is the similarity with the way of thinking of Pokryshkin, who at the same time called his figures in the sky of Moldova not “slander”, but “hooks”. The phrase \"take everything from the car ...\" coincides literally with two aces!\n\n1941 finds Fadeev on Far East, where he was awarded the rank of sergeant of military service ... He did not have to serve here for long, after the start of the war, part of the echelon along the Trans-Siberian Railway was sent to the west. On the back of the picture, where Fadeev is standing at the “donkey” next to twelve aviators, it is written in his hand: “5.7.41. Shanks. Friends who are going to beat everyone who climbs on the USSR. In Balashov, missing flying, Vadim demonstrates such figures at low altitude with a dive over the city center that the Air Force commander, who turned out to be a witness, sends the pilot to the guardhouse: “Recklessness! Take action immediately! There will be more imitators, then accidents, disasters.\n\n“Bastards are fascist pilots. When they bombard, then, if there are no our fighters, they go down and shoot civilians from low ground. Recently, their fighters, having flown into one village, from fifty meters began to fire at children bathing in the river ... I myself am a fighter, but I will never shoot German children, although my hand will not waver to destroy any number of fascists in battle.\n\nBy August 1942, Fadeev accounted for six downed German aircraft. But even of those pilots with whom he arrived at the front, few survived. Lieutenant Georgy Plotnikov died, with whom Vadim became friends in the Far East.\n\n…Hold on, German! Fully armed with new technology and Pokryshkin's tactics, Vadim Fadeev took to the skies of the Kuban. “Let noble rage boil up like a wave”… From V. I. Fadeev’s award list: “11.4.43, covering his troops in the area of ​​Ukrainian, Shiptalskaya, Stavropolskaya, Krasny Tabakovod, fought an air battle with 4 Me-109. As a result of decisive attacks, Comrade Fadeev shoots down one Me-109 ... An informing radio station - the call sign \"squirrel\" said: \"air cobra\", stop fire, \"mass\" is on fire. But comrade Fadeev accompanied the vulture to the very ground with machine-gun and cannon fire ... Comrade Fadeev had a lot of combat episodes and all sorties occurred with a meeting of enemy fighters.\n\n\"Hey, let's go!\" - Violating discipline on the air, Vadim sang \"Dubinushka\" in flight. Hey, let's go! “The first person to whom during the fighting in the Kuban I signed a submission for the title of Hero of the Soviet Union was V.I. Fadeev. And he fully deserved it ... - recalled General N. F. Naumenko. - During one of the weeks he destroyed ten enemy aircraft personally and one in the group. This is a very big victory.\" The general also noted that, upon personal acquaintance, “I immediately liked the pilot for the depth and liveliness of his mind, a clear understanding of the tasks facing fighter aviation. Later, it became a kind of need for me to see our hero and talk to him.\n\nIvan Babak wrote: “Vadim Fadeev was a common favorite, even in our neighboring forty-fifth regiment he was considered some kind of special pilot. After all, in each battle he would definitely shoot down 2-3 aircraft!\n\nVadim continued to amuse his comrades. At first, as already mentioned, the pilots of the 16th and 45th regiments were placed in Krasnodar, in a dilapidated warehouse, on bunk beds. At night, the racks could not withstand the weight of Fadeev, who collapsed on Dmitry Glinka. The pilots sleeping nearby woke up from the roar, deciding that another bombing had begun. And the dream of two tired Hercules, to everyone's amazement and laughter, was not disturbed!\n\nBy April 28, as indicated in the submission for the title of Hero, Fadeev already had 394 sorties, of which 118 were for attack, 155 for reconnaissance, 106 for escorting bombers, 55 for patrol and cover. In 43 air battles, he personally shot down 17 aircraft (15 Me-109, but one Yu-87 and Yu-88) and one in a group (Me-109). These are official figures, they are probably underestimated. After all, the planes shot down behind the front line, left without confirmation by the ground forces, as already mentioned, were not counted by Soviet pilots then.\n\nThe Germans began hunting for the best Russian aces. Highlighting his \"Akhtung, akhtung!\" Pokryshkin, they, according to N. I. Umansky, also started talking about Glinka, Fadeev and Rechkalov. \"Khadeev, Khadeev...\" - the voices of German observers came from the radio. They also knew his call sign \"Beard\".\n\n\"To be or not to be. That's the question…” - another favorite number performed by Vadim - Prince Hamlet's monologue from act 111 of Shakespeare's tragedy…\n\nAlexander Ivanovich, together with political officer M. A. Pogrebny, worried about a friend. Vadim's young wife came to Popovicheskaya. They met shortly before that in the reserve regiment. Lyudmila was married to Nikolai Lavitsky, one of the best pilots of the 45th regiment. Spectacular in appearance, she played the accordion beautifully, loved communication, feasts. Vadim fell in love with her without memory and “recaptured” her from her husband, who had a hard time surviving the betrayal ...\n\nOnce Vadim, returning from a sortie, over the house where he lived with Lyudmila in the village, began to show his virtuoso aerobatics. From an ambush in the clouds, a pair of Messerschmitts dived on Fadeev. He was saved from death only by a warning from the ground on the radio of Arkady Fedorov, who managed to jump into the cab of the Cobra.\n\nPokryshkin boiled: “What are you doing, Vadim?! Foolishly decided to die?!… You behave like a vagrant merchant. In combat flight, turning on the transmitter, you perform arias from operas. Recklessly sometimes chasing individual \"messers\", leaving to manage the group. Who needs this circus?! You are the commander, you must set an example.” Vadim agreed, but could not overcome himself ...\n\nOn May 5, 1943, the regiment commander N.V. Isaev determined the composition of the group that flew out on patrol. A pair of Fadeev was connected to the Pokryshkin link. Andrey Trud most often flew as Vadim's wingman. Only such an experienced tenacious pilot could hold on to him. In flight, Fadeev began to move away from the group.\n\n- “Beard”, I am Pokryshkin, come closer, why are you coming off?\n\nNow I'll come!\n\nThese were Vadim's last words that his friend heard. Soon, Pokryshkin's link entered into battle with the Junkers and Messerschmitts. A couple of Fadeevs, far away from their own, were attacked by twelve Messerschmitts. As Andrei Trud later said, he was bound by battle. Vadim was hit and went home... He did not return to the airfield.\n\nOn that day, the German “expert” aces, using intelligence and radio interception data, made a decisive attempt to crack down on the best pilots of the 16th regiment. Pokryshkin in this sortie escaped with the help of Ivan Stepanov from the “pincers”, into which he was rigidly taken by two pairs of Me-109s. And then it was Pokryshkin who was shot by the Yak-\"werewolf\".\n\nKnowing the strength of the \"Beard\", the Germans lured him under the blow of a group that had an overwhelming numerical superiority.\n\nHis friends did not learn about the place of Vadim's death. N. I. Umansky, in a letter to the author of these lines, recalled:\n\n“I visually observed this pirate air battle from the army command post due to a cloud ambush. You should have seen with what cruelty they attacked him! This fight lasted five or six minutes. Three German planes were on fire, but Fadeev's plane also rolled off to the side with a decrease, all this happened in the Abinskaya-Krymskaya area. Fadeev was seriously wounded and still headed towards the village of Popovichnaya, towards his airfield ...\n\nFadeev landed his \"Aircobra\", without releasing the landing gear, near the lake, forty kilometers from the village of Slavyanskaya, in the reeds. When I was at the site of his forced landing and death, he had already been buried. It was around May 10-11, I arrived with two senior officers of the army headquarters, it was really difficult to get there, everything was still mined, trenches, ditches, various defense structures, lakes and swamps were all around.\n\nOn the spot, we were told by anti-aircraft defense gunners that the pilot was still alive for some time after landing, about an hour and a half, but was unconscious and soon died. His body was tortured by mosquitoes, the likes of which I have never seen anywhere in my life - in size, like wasps. Anti-aircraft gunners found Fadeev and buried him. I personally inspected the plane, the cockpit was smashed, covered in blood. The blow fell on the front of the aircraft, the instruments and sight were mutilated. The grave was very small, on the board there was an inscription “Pilot V. I. Fadeev died on May 5, 1943” and an asterisk, that’s all.\n\nThose officers with whom I went to this place asked everyone, wrote everything down, talked with the officers who buried Fadeev, took a photo of the plane and the grave.\n\nI. M. Dzusov, who was on duty at the army command post, reported to the regiment about our plane that had exploded. Can you imagine what is left of the plane and the pilot after hitting the ground and exploding? But Fadeev's follower Andrey Trud did not confirm this. In fact, the Yak-3 plane from Savitsky’s corps exploded, exactly at the place where Dzusov spoke, this was established by a later check, and Fadeev landed his “aircobra”, being seriously wounded with a broken head and chest ... Why didn’t the regiment find out about this , I don't know.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThere is a statement that the war ends only when the last dead soldier is buried. If this is so, then it is understandable why we lost many fruits of the Victory of 1945... According to the Krasnodar Regional Center for Search Works, 86-87 thousand dead were buried in official graves in the Krasnodar Territory. And 200-300 thousand soldiers remained lying in the Kuban fields and forests. As well as in the places of other battles and battles ...\n\nIn the region, for the first time in the country in the 1990s, the laws “On search work”, “On security (memorial) zones of the Krasnodar Territory” and “On ensuring the safety and maintenance of Russian and foreign military graves and military graves on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory” were adopted . Funds have been allocated from the budget, there is opposition to \"businessmen\" - marauders who are looking for orders, weapons, gold.\n\nUntil now, detachments of disinterested ascetics-searchers have been walking around Russia at their own peril and risk, finding the remains of the dead. Many, many of them still lie in the forests and swamps. Only sometimes it is possible to establish their names ...\n\n... On May 10, 1943, when there was some calm in the air, the results were summed up in the regiment. The death of Vadim shocked everyone. For Pokryshkin, this was the heaviest loss since the beginning of the war.\n\nHaving received permission to speak, Alexander Ivanovich again named the main reason for the death of the pilots - patrolling in small groups, while the Germans were operating in large forces. In response to Isaev’s remark: “We must reckon with the quantitative composition of the regiment,” Pokryshkin proposed increasing the number of sorties for each pilot, with which they agree.\n\nPokryshkin also said: “You can’t make groups of bosses. This leads to different decisions in the conduct of combat, to a violation of the idea of ​​​​the group commander and to unjustified losses. The appointment of Fadeev as the leader of the couple in my six was wrong and led to his death.\n\nAfter that, \"Isaev, without listening to me, closed the meeting so as not to listen to comments about the shortcomings in the combat work of the regiment, which he himself was to blame.\"\n\nLet's say a few words about Vadim's girlfriend ... Friends persuaded Fadeev to send her to Kuibyshev to her parents, but Lyudmila remained in Popovichnaya. Upon learning of Vadim's death, she did not allow his child to be born and, having got rid of the burden, began working as a waitress in the flight canteen. Her former husband, also a Hero of the Soviet Union, also died. The pilots began to avoid the society of the femme fatale...\n\nPokryshkin, who after meeting with Maria changed his mind about a woman in the life of a pilot, nevertheless superstitiously did not even allow his beloved to approach the plane. In combat conditions, Alexander Ivanovich believed, the wife should not be around. So, Vadim's wife kept him away from communication with the pilots of the regiment, he did not participate in the debriefing and actions of the enemy. “All this could not but affect the combat form of Vadim ... - Pokryshkin wrote. - And in his last battle, Vadim showed his inherent courage and skill, but his usual underestimation of the enemy's forces, the neglect of real danger, also made themselves felt. These reflections of mine... which I did not share with anyone... confirmed me even more strongly in certain unshakable norms of a pilot's behavior on the ground and in the air. If you break them, retribution will inevitably come ... \"\n\nOf course, it was difficult to compare with the Siberian endurance and will of Pokryshkin, who went through an exceptionally harsh life school. Vadim basil in response: “What are you, Sasha, are you worried, is there really some lousy Fritz who can bring me down ?!”.\n\nStill, we must admit that Fadeev's underestimation of the enemy in battles with the \"experts\" of the Udet, Mölders and 52nd squadrons is also a kind of phenomenon ...\n\n... Spring of 1943. Aircobras received in Tehran. The pilots of the 16th Guards Regiment, having spent the night in one of the hotels in the eastern capital, are walking along the airfield towards American aircraft lined up in dense rows, fresh paint shining in the rays of the rising sun. For one day, Soviet officers found themselves in an unfamiliar, different in colors, sounds, rhythm world of palaces and minarets, fashionable avenues and narrow poor streets, abundant bazaars and advertising lights. The real war and grief were far from here ...\n\nSuddenly stopping and, like a talented artist, immediately capturing his attention, Vadim, looking to the north, recited Yesenin's lines:\n\nIt's time for me to go back to Russia,\n\nPersia! Am I leaving you?\n\nAm I parting with you forever?\n\nFor the love of my native land\n\nIt's time for me to go back to Russia.\n\nThe pilots froze for a moment. As always, amazingly subtly, Vadim touched the innermost string in their souls ...\n\nFadeev, the maestro of amateur regimental activity, knew how to read poetry. His love for Mayakovsky, named by Stalin the best poet of the Soviet era, and for the then semi-forbidden Yesenin reflected the time of the 1920s and 1930s. Soviet Russia and outgoing Russia, unbridled passion, the mystery of death, not fully solved ... Fadeev resembles Mayakovsky in growth, seething energy, loudness. Yesenin - with a strand falling on his forehead, when Vadim did not have time to cut his hair short, in a front-line manner ... And with a look in which a childish clarity is visible behind a daring or comic challenge, or, as in one of latest pictures in the Kuban, sad and aching: \"My life, or you dreamed of me ...\"\n\n... In early June 1999, Maria Kuzminichna, during a trip to the Kuban, which she dreamed of, visited Fadeev, in a school museum dedicated to the Hero. She also knew from the letters she received in Moscow that in the early 1990s it was decided to close the museum, at the same time Vadim's personal belongings, handed over by his father, also disappeared. But after a few years, people realized it ... How could it be without him ?! The museum has been restored, here again in the photographs Fadeev sits freely on the wing of the “aircobra” with Andrey Trud, holding, like an epic hero, three on his shoulders ... School teachers hold competitions among the children for the best knowledge of the biographies of A. I. Pokryshkin and V. I. Fadeev . The program of the \"young Pokryshkins\" from Fadeevo at the review in Krasnodar was distinguished by special enthusiasm. Yes, Vadim still knows how to lead and ignite!\n\nA monument to the Hero of the Soviet Union Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev was erected near the road from Fadeevo to Krymskaya. Maria Kuzminichna, peering at photographs of the bust in Moscow, believed that the sculptor could not achieve similarities with Vadim. But here she changed her mind. The photograph failed. She approached the pedestal, raising her head, touched the stone with her palms... Silence reigned among those accompanying the guest of honor.\n\nBehind the monument, standing on a steep slope, there was a stunningly beautiful view of the hilly expanses of the Kuban, shrouded in a June hot blue haze ...\n\nVadim Ivanovich Fadeev(December 25, 1917 - May 5, 1943) - fighter pilot, guard captain, squadron commander.\n\nBiography\n\nVadim Ivanovich Fadeev was born on December 25, 1917 in the village of Fedkino, Terengulsky District, Ulyanovsk Region, into a family of teachers. He lived in Kuibyshev, where he completed 3 courses and an flying club, where after he worked as an instructor.\n\nIn 1940 he graduated from the Chkalov Military Aviation Pilot School.\n\nIn August 1941, he got into the active part.\n\nVadim Fadeev was tall and of strong build. At the front, he was given a personal double ration. According to contemporaries, he was cheerful and sociable, played the guitar well, sang, read poetry. As a joke, he grew a long beard, for which he received his call sign \"Beard\".\n\nAwards\n\nMemory\n\nIn honor of V.I. Fadeev, streets in the city of Samara, Sevastopol and in the village of Kievskoye were named. There are two memorial plaques in Samara: on the house where Fadeev lived (38 Galaktionovskaya St.) and on the street named after him (56A Fadeev St.).\n\nIn the Krasnodar Territory, seven kilometers from the village of Varenikovskaya, along the highway to Anapa there is a village Fadeevo, named after Vadim Ivanovich Fadev. A monument to Fadeev V.I. was erected in the village.\n\nMay 5 marks exactly 74 years since my uncle Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev went missing in the Kuban, Hero of the Soviet Union, 26-year-old ace pilot, 2-meter hero boy, gentle son and brother, broad soul, true friend, joker , wrestler, musician, colloquial artist, singer. This year, on December 25, he would have turned 100 years old. I believe, if there had been no war, I would have easily lived to this age and made us all happy, as well as my unborn children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I think he was quite capable of it - the championship of Russia in classical wrestling at the age of 17 is a sure harbinger of good health.\n\nDima, as they called him at home, was a man of the Renaissance, one of those whom nature gives to the earth once every thousand years, and maybe even less often. He combined aristocratism, military courage, engineering acumen, and boyish mischief. Disciplined NOT hooligans, flying according to the rules, perished in the first days of the war - who could not, and who did not manage to take off; and those who were able to take off, failed to fight in the air, becoming victims of mediocre politics. It turned out that his mischief is not his fool, not the hooliganism of a Samara schoolboy, but a well-thought-out strategy, military skill, and, ultimately, a personal feat, a great achievement of a discoverer, a pioneer, going ahead and contrary to all the canons and prohibitions of the criminal system that abandoned to the mercy of fate, millions of boyish lives. His soul was torn to the sky. He gave, in exact accordance with his convictions, his soul for his friends. I am sure that if he had lived to see the Victory, if he hadn’t landed in the Gulag, thanks to his independent character, he would have become an astronaut and discovered something extraordinary. He was cramped in the cockpit of his beloved Airacobra. The soul was torn to the sky - higher and higher, but in the sky there were and there are no limits. He did what he loved - he sang, flew, made friends, loved. They say that in the last flight he sang an aria from the opera, broadcasting it on the radio. His assassins, who had prepared a trap for him, approached like a wedge against the sun, arranged a carousel and took his plane in pincers. They should have heard him sing as they pressed the triggers. It so happened that I know the name of the one who commanded them, who shot my uncle. We figured it out recently, thanks to the Internet, and most importantly, to enthusiasts interested in the history of aviation, who found data in German archives. Low bow to them! I really wanted to ask the 90 year old German veteran if he liked my uncle's singing before he died? I did not have time - this man died a couple of years ago in his bed, surrounded by honor and warmth of his loved ones, awarded, in addition to Hitler's, with all conceivable NATO awards - he rose to high ranks in this organization after the war. Good question: did he have the right to such a life after what he did with us? Why did it happen so? Who will answer for this?\n\nPilots don't die, they just don't come back to earth. But Dima was an exception here too. All post-war years our family is tormented by the mystery of his burial. It would be much easier if you could come to her and cry, but his mother and sisters were deprived of that too. On that day, May 5, 1943, Dima radioed that he had landed, but was seriously wounded. His friend A. Pokryshkin told me that the order to search for and rescue him had not been given. They didn't look for him! And then, after the war, a lot was done: he was searched for by red rangers, boys and girls from the Krymskaya and Samara schools. They literally turned over the entire steppe in the area of ​​​​the proposed landing, but found nothing - neither the body nor the plane. But the plane is not a needle, and the 2-meter pilot himself had to leave some traces, if not in documents, then at least in the memories of local residents. We visited these places with my aunt, brother and sister in 1972 as part of the delegation of my uncle's school, spoke with several local residents, allegedly \"eyewitnesses\". They all said different things, and it was felt that they were always hiding something - the Kuban Cossacks living there, to be sure, never liked Soviet power and suffered a lot from it. The stories of these witnesses cannot be trusted.\n\nRecently, a rumor came from A. Pokryshkin's entourage that they allegedly had information that my uncle was taken prisoner, wounded, thrown into Auschwitz and died there just before his liberation, leading an uprising of prisoners. I want to believe that this is true, because it is so similar to him. But the rumor remained a rumor - no supporting documents were found in the Auschwitz Museum. To tell the truth, I want certainty already - what, when and where happened to him, what death he took, where he was buried. This is very important for relatives! I would like to find his grave, without this he is not yet dead, he has not left.\n\nFor my grandmother, the wording “missing” also meant the absence of a pension, as the mother of the Hero, when she was left alone with two daughters in her arms. His father, my grandfather, died of a heart attack two weeks after receiving the funeral.\n\nUncle Dima!\n\nI've never seen you, but sometimes I feel like I've known you since birth - we talked so much about you with my mom!\n\nThe earth is empty without you. I really miss you and my unborn cousins ​​and cousins ​​and their descendants.\n\nRest, Lord, the soul of your servant Vadim!\n\nPeace to you!\n\nRegion Samara Region\n\nMilitary rank of guard captain\n\nLocality: Samara\n\nmilitary specialty fighter pilot\n\nPlace of Birth Fedkino village, Treungilsky district, Ulyanovsk region\n\nYears of service 1938-1943\n\nDate of birth 12/25/1917\n\nDate of death 05/05/1943\n\nBattle path\n\ncombat unit\n\nTook part https://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fadeev, _Vadim_Ivanovich\n\nVadim Ivanovich Fadeev (December 25, 1917 - May 5, 1943) - Hero of the Soviet Union, fighter pilot, guard captain, squadron commander.\n\nBiography\n\nVadim Ivanovich Fadeev was born on December 25, 1917 in the village of Fedkino, Terengulsky District, Ulyanovsk Region, into a family of teachers. He lived in Kuibyshev, where he completed 3 courses at a construction institute and an flying club, where he later worked as an instructor.\n\nIn 1940 he graduated from the Chkalov Military Aviation Pilot School.\n\nIn August 1941, he was assigned to the active unit.\n\nVadim Fadeev was tall and of strong build. At the front, he was given a personal double ration. According to contemporaries, he was cheerful and sociable, played the guitar well, sang, read poetry. As a joke, he grew a long beard, for which he received his call sign \"Beard\".\n\nOn November 27, 1941, the pilot of the 446th mixed air regiment, Fadeev, was shot down by artillery near the village of Bolshie Sala, northwest of Rostov, during an attack on enemy positions. He was able to \"hold out\" to his positions, achieved a meeting with the division commander, reported to him about the observed German forces and insisted on striking at them. In the battle formations of the infantry, he personally participated in the successful attack on the Five Brothers height. For initiative, resourcefulness, courage and heroism, senior sergeant Vadim Fadeev was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on the proposal of the command of the ground forces. Then he was awarded the extraordinary military rank of \"lieutenant\".\n\nIn 1943, after being wounded and due to a conflict with the regiment commander, Fadeev was transferred to the rear. After that, he got into the 16th Guards Fighter Regiment to A.I. Pokryshkin, where he became a squadron commander. He proved himself not only as a strong air fighter, but also as a competent, resourceful tactician: \"Vadim Fadeev made a very large contribution to the work on improving the tactics of fighters and its implementation in training. This infinitely brave man, of great stature and athletic build, with the character of the Volga rebel, enthusiastically perceived everything new in tactical techniques, actively introduced them into training.\n\nBy the end of April 1943, Captain Fadeev made 394 sorties, conducted 43 air battles and personally shot down 17 enemy aircraft and 3 in the group. Result: 20 downed enemy aircraft.\n\nShortly before his death, documents were sent to confer on him the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn May 5, 1943, while on a mission to cover his troops in the area of ​​​​the village of Krymskaya, on a P-39 aircraft, he broke away from Alexander Pokryshkin's link and was spotted by a Me-109 group. The couple broke up and a fight ensued. Fadeev was wounded and pulled home. His wingman, Andrei Trud, could not tear himself away from the Me-109 and could not provide cover for the leader. Fadeev was able to land the plane in the floodplains of the river, but died from blood loss. Only his body was found.\n\nOn May 24, 1943, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, for the exemplary performance of combat missions of the command at the front and the courage and heroism of the guard shown at the same time, Captain Fadeev Vadim Ivanovich was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe was buried in the central park of the village of Kyiv, Krymsky District, Krasnodar Territory.\n\nHe was awarded the Order of Lenin, two Orders of the Red Banner.\n\nAwards\n\nOrder of the Red Banner\n\nTitle \"Hero of the Soviet Union\"\n\nMemory\n\nFew \"live\" photographs of V. Fadeev remain. In this old, still pre-war photograph, Vadim Fadeev is with friends with whom he began his career as a pilot in an flying club.\n\nStreets in Krymsk, Gelendzhik, Samara, Sevastopol and in the village of Kievskoye were named in honor of V.I. Fadeev. Two memorial plaques have been installed in Samara: on the house where Fadeev lived (38 Galaktionovskaya St.) and on the street named after him (56A Fadeeva St.).\n\nIn the Krasnodar Territory, seven kilometers from the village of Varenikovskaya, along the highway to Anapa, there is the village of Fadeevo, named after Fadev Vadim Ivanovich.
