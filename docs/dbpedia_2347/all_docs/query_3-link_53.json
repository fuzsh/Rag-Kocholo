        "text": "A major difference compared to contemporary fighters at the time was to place the engine behind the cockpit. The engine drove a ten foot driveshaft that attached to the propeller gearbox at the nose of the aircraft. The reasoning for such a radical design feature was to place the engine aft of the center-of-gravity to increase maneuverability. Flying tactics were still based on World War I flying strategies, but tactics would change dramatically in the years to come. This was evident in the P-38 and F6F Hellcat which were very successful airplanes despite the fact that they could not out turn a Zero. With the engine behind the center-of-gravity, this gave the P-39 a tendency to stall in a tight turn and possibly go into a flat spin, which many a pilot did not recover from.5\n\nAnother flaw of the P-39 was its short range, but this was not the fault of Bell engineers. The thinking at the time was that single-engine fighters would be short-range interceptors that would take off at a moments notice and then return to a base nearby. This was certainly the case in designing the Spitfire, Bf 109, Hawker Hurricane, and the Grumman F4F. The only planners with the foresight for long-range missions were the designers of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Before the war had started, Japanese planners foresaw the need for long-range operations over the Pacific. It wasnt until the Allies were well into the war before they realized the need for long-range fighter escorts to protect their bombers on extended raids over Germany.\n\nThe original designation was P-45 but this reverted back to P-39 before the first of eighty production models were ordered by the USAAC on August 10,1939. Before this first order was delivered, the French had also ordered 200 airplanes, but after France was defeated in 1940, the order was taken over by the British Purchasing Commission that became part of a total British order of 675 aircraft, but most of these aircraft would never be delivered to England. At that time, the Royal Air Force (RAF) needed planes for aerial dog fighting, and while they found the Airacobra fine for low-level operations, this wasn't the type of aerial combat they had in mind for the P-39.\n\nThe first P-39s sent to England in July 1941 went to the No. 601 \"County of London\" squadron who were hoping to dump their old Hurricanes for a new and more modern fighter. The British replaced the original 37 mm cannon with a Hispano-Suiza 20 mm and the 0.30 caliber machine guns were replaced with Browning .303s .\n\nThey were greatly disappointed to find the P-39's top speed was 30 mph less than expected. Bell had also claimed that the P-39 could operate above 36,000 ft.6 In the real world however, above 15,000 ft., Spitfires, Hurricanes, Bf 109s and the new Hawker Typhoon flew circles around the P-39. Undoubtedly, the British felt that the yanks had taken them to the cleaners and so, they refused the rest of the order. The 601 was the only British squadron to be equipped with the type and they flew only four missions with P-39s.7 Without blinking an eye, the 601 converted to Spitfires in March 1942 and the British P-39s diverted back to the USAAC were designated as P-400s. Two hundred P-400s were sent to the Fifth Air Force in Australia for service in the Pacific.\n\nFrom the British order, 212 P-39s were sent to Russia and this was the beginning of the 4,746 P-39s which were to equip Russian squadrons. This was almost half of the total production of all P-39s. They were highly regarded by the Russians for their ground-attack capability and performed well in ground-strafing operations. The Russians produced 28 aces with at least 15 victories flying P-39 Airacobras. Aleksandr Pokryshkin scored approximately 48 victories and Grigori Rechkalov scored 44 victories in P-39s. Pokryshkin was able to make a big improvement in the P-39s firing control system. He said it was impossible to keep the cannon gun sight aimed on the target, because the cannon trigger was on top of the control stick. He had his regiments P-39s rigged so that the cannons and machine guns would fire simultaneously. A salvo from a P-39 rigged in this configuration would disintegrate the target.8\n\nThe 45th regiment of the Russian 216 Fighter Division (9th Guards) were the first to receive P-39s. They had already been flying P-40s so the transition was not so difficult, since the engine, instruments and cockpit flight controls were similar. The 16th regiment was the next to receive the P-39 on April 9, 1943. The basic units of the 9th Guard were the 16th, 100th, 104th and the 45th joined afterwards. The 16th and 45th became the combat core of the 9th Guard.9\n\nWhat made the P-39 and P-63 so successful in Russia was that on the Eastern front, most aerial battles were flown at lower altitudes at around 15,000 ft. or less. In Europe the situation was quiet different. The majority of US fighters were assigned to escort high-altitude B-17s and B-24s on long distance bombing raids over Germany. US Fighters often flew top cover for bomber squadrons at 30,000 ft. or higher, so most dogfights began at high altitude. Whereas in Russia, the distances travelled were much shorter and the Russian Air Force wasnt making the same type of long-distance, high-altitude bombing runs that the Americans and British were doing. E.g. The top scoring fighter of all time, Erich Hartmann scored most of his 352 victories in Russia. Luftwaffe pilots fought almost every day while flying defensive, short flights, on their own territory where four and even five missions per day on the Eastern Front were commonplace. Also, the Russian Yak-3 and La-5FN were very successful fighters that performed best at altitudes below 4,000 m.10\n\nIn comparison to the best fighters of the day such as the P-51, P-38, P-47, Bf 109, Spitfire and Zero, it got a bad rap because of its poor showing in the early European theater. This arena was for the most part high-altitude aerial battles and without the turbo-supercharger, the P-39 just could not compete. However, in other theaters of war, flying low-level operations, such as the Eastern Front in Russia, in the Pacific and North Africa, it performed rather well.\n\nEven though it was extremely difficult to service because of the engine placement, the Russians still loved their P-39s. On the Eastern Front, parts were in short supply since they had to come all the way from Buffalo in New York, but the Russians were able to scavenge parts from P-39s damaged in accidents or crashes to keep their available P-39s in the air. And the P-39's short range wasn't an issue since it was mostly used for homeland defense.\n\nThe Americans demanded the best fighter planes and they got them, but the Russians used what was available and made the most out of what they had. It was mostly a matter of training for the Russians and Günter Rall, with 275 victories and the third best Luftwaffe experten, commented that by 1942, the Russians were becoming much better pilots, \"In capable hands the P-39 was a challenge to the Bf 109 F & G models.\"14\n\nA total of 9,558 P-39s were produced with the major variants being the P-39D, P-39N and P-39Q of which almost half were sent to Russia under the Lend-Lease program.13 While the Airacobra was never one of the best airplanes, it was still a good airplane. The P-39 introduced many new innovations that would later be used on America's first jet powered airplane, the XP-59 Airacomet.15"
