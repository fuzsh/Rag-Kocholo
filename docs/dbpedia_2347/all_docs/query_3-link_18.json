Â In the Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union gave military aid to the Second Spanish Republic, against Spanish Nationalist forces, which were assisted by Germany and Italy. Â The Nationalist forces won the war. Â The Soviets suffered another political defeat when their ally Czechoslovakia was partitioned and partially annexed by Germany and Hungary via the Munich Agreement. Â In 1938 and 1939, the USSR fought and defeated Japan in two separate border wars, at Lake Khasan and Khalkhin Gol, the latter being a major Soviet victory.\n\nIn 1939 the Soviet Union considered forming an alliance with both Britain and France or with Germany. Â The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 between the Soviet Union and Germany included a secret protocol whereby the independent countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania were divided into spheres of interest of the parties. Â On 1 September, barely a week after the pact had been signed, Germany invaded Poland. Â The Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east on 1 September and on 28 September signed a secret treaty with Nazi Germany to arrange coordination of fighting against Polish resistance.\n\nSoon after that, the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and annexed Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina from Romania. Â The Soviet Union attacked Finland on 30 November 1939, which started the Winter War. Â Finnish defences prevented an all-out invasion, resulting in an interim peace, but Finland was forced to cede strategically important border areas near Leningrad.\n\nGermany ended the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by invading the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Â This resulted in the Soviet Union becoming one of the Allies. Â Germany then revived its Anti-Comintern Pact, enlisting many European and Asian countries in opposition to the Soviet Union. Â The Soviet Union and Japan remained neutral towards each other for most of the war by the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. Â The Soviet Union ended the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact by invading Manchukuo on 8 August 1945, due to agreements reached at the Yalta Conference with Roosevelt and Churchill.

Â (Soviet Air Force Photo)\n\n(Gleb Osokin Photo)\n\nBell P-39N Airacobra (Serial No. 219158), 100. Â Central Russian Air Force Museum, Monino.\n\nThe most successful and numerous use of the P-39 was by the Soviet Air Force (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS). Â They received the considerably improved P-39N and P-39Q models via the Alaska-Siberia ferry route. Â The tactical environment of the Eastern Front did not demand the high-altitude performance the RAF and AAF required. Â The comparatively low-speed, low-altitude nature of most air combat on the Soviet Front suited the P-39's strengths: sturdy construction, reliable radio gear, and adequate firepower.\n\nSoviet pilots appreciated the cannon-armed P-39 primarily for its air-to-air capability. Â A common Western misconception is that the Bell fighters were used as ground attack aircraft. Â This is because the Soviet term for the mission of the P-39, prikrytiye sukhoputnykh voysk (coverage of ground forces) is commonly translated ground support, which is often taken to mean close air support. Â In Soviet usage, it has a broader meaning. Â Soviet-operated P-39s did make strafing attacks, but it was \"never a primary mission or strong suit for this aircraft\". Â The Soviets developed successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell fighters and scored a surprising number of aerial victories over a variety of German aircraft. Â Soviet P-39s had no trouble dispatching Junkers Ju 87 Stukas or German twin-engine bombers and matched, and in some areas surpassed, early and mid-war Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Â The usual nickname for the Airacobra in the VVS was Kobrushka (\"little cobra\") or Kobrastochka, a blend of Kobra and Lastochka (swallow), \"dear little cobra\".\n\nThe first Soviet Cobras had a 20-mm Hispano-Suiza cannon and two heavy Browning machine guns, synchronized and mounted in the nose. Â Later, Cobras arrived with the M4 37-mm cannon and four machine guns, two synchronized and two wing-mounted. \"We immediately removed the wing machine guns, leaving one cannon and two machine guns,\" Golodnikov recalled later. Â That modification improved roll rate by reducing rotational inertia. Â Soviet airmen appreciated the M4 cannon with its powerful rounds and the reliable action but complained about the low rate of fire (three rounds per second) and inadequate ammunition storage (only 30 rounds).\n\nThe Soviets used the Airacobra primarily for air-to-air combat against a variety of German aircraft, including Messerschmitt Bf 109s, Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, Junkers Ju 87s, and Junkrs ju 88s. Â During the battle of Kuban River, VVS relied on P-39s much more than Spitfires and P-40s. Â Aleksandr Pokryshkin, from the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (16.Gv.IAP), claimed 20 victories in that campaign in a P-39.\n\nThe last plane shot down by the Luftwaffe was a Soviet P-39, on 8 May 1945 by Oblt. Fritz Stehle of 2./JG 7 flying a Me 262 on Erzgebirge. Â Also, the last Soviet air victory was in a P-39 on 9 May 1945, when Kapitan Vasily Pshenichikov scored against a Focke-Wulf Fw 189, in the sky over Prague. Â Five of the 10 highest scoring Soviets aces logged the majority of their kills in P-39s. Â Grigoriy Rechkalov scored 44 victories in Airacobras. Â Pokryshkin scored 47 of his 59 victories in P-39s, making him the highest scoring P-39 fighter pilot of any nation, and the highest scoring Allied fighter pilot using an American-built fighter. Â This does not include his 6 shared victories, at least some of which were achieved with the P-39.\n\nThe United States did not supply M80 armor-piercing rounds for the autocannons of Soviet P-39s. Â Instead, the Soviets received 1,232,991 M54 high-explosive rounds, which they used primarily for air-to-air combat and against soft ground targets. The VVS did not use the P-39 for tank-busting duties.\n\nA total of 4,719 P-39s were sent to the Soviet Union, accounting for more than one-third of all U.S. and UK-supplied fighter aircraft in the VVS, and nearly half of all P-39 production. Â Soviet Airacobra losses totalled 1,030 aircraft (49 in 1942, 305 in 1943, 486 in 1944 and 190 in 1945).\n\niracobras served with the Soviet Air Forces as late as 1949, when two regiments were operating as part of the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Division in the Belmorsky Miloitary District.

Â Central Russian Air Force Museum, Monino.\n\nThe first version to be supplied in quantity to the Soviet Union was the P-63A-7 with a higher vertical tail, and reinforced wings and fuselage. Â The fuselage proved to need strengthening, consequently in October 1944, a reinforcement kit for operational P-63s was developed. Â Air Transport Command ferry pilots, including U.S. women pilots of the WASP program, picked up the planes at the Bell factory at Niagara Falls, New York, and flew them to Great Falls, Montana, and then onward via the Northwest Staging Route through Canada to Alaska, where Soviet ferry pilots, many of them women, would take delivery of the aircraft at Nome, and fly them to the Soviet Union over the Bering Strait via the Alaska-Siberia route (ALSIB). Â A total of 2,397 (2,672, according to other sources) such aircraft were delivered to USSR, out of the overall 3,303 production aircraft (72.6%).\n\nBy a 1943 agreement, P-63s were disallowed for Soviet use against Germany and were supposed to be concentrated in the Soviet Far East for an eventual attack on Japan. Â However, there are many unconfirmed reports from both the Soviet and German side that P-63s did indeed see service against the Luftwaffe. Â Most notably, one of Pokryshkin's pilots reports in his memoirs published in the 1990s that the entire 4th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (4 GvIAP) was secretly converted to P-63s in 1944, while officially still flying P-39s. Â One account states they were in action at KÃ¶nigsberg, Germany (now in Poland) and in the final assault on Berlin. Â There are German reports of P-63s shot down by both fighters and flak. Â Hans Rudel, the highest decorated pilot of the Luftwaffe, states in his memoirs, \"We often encounter American types of aircraft, especially Airacobras, Kingcobras and Bostons.\" Â This was in the Courland front towards the end of the war. Â Nevertheless, all Soviet records show nothing but P-39s used against Germany.\n\nIn general, official Soviet histories played down the role of Lend-Lease supplied aircraft in favor of local designs, but it is known that the P-63 was a successful fighter aircraft in Soviet service. Â A common Western misconception is that the Bell fighters were used as ground attack aircraft.\n\nThe Soviets developed successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell fighters and scored a surprising number of aerial victories over a variety of German aircraft. Â Low ceilings, short missions, good radios, a sealed and warm cockpit and ruggedness contributed to their effectiveness. Â To pilots who had once flown the tricky Polikarpov I-16, the aerodynamic quirks of the mid-engined aircraft were unimportant. Â In the Far East, P-63 and P-39 aircraft were used in theSoviet invasion of Manchuko and norther Korea. Â In the Pacific theatre, the Kingcobras flew escort, close air support and ground attack missions. The Soviet P-63s achieved their first air victory on 15 August 1945, when Lejtenant I. F. Miroshnichenko from 17th IAP/190 IAD, shot down an Impeerial Japanese Armyh Air Force Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa fighter off the coast of North Korea.\n\nSufficient aircraft continued in use after the war for them to be given the NATO codename Fred. Â By 9 May 1945, operational units had still 1,148 Kingcobras on strength.

Â Of the 7,500 Douglas A-20 built, 3,414 were delivered to Russia during the Second World War. Â Also known as the DB-7, the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) and Soviet Naval Aviation (AVMF) received more than one in three (2,908 aircraft) of the DB-7s ultimately built. Â Only fifteen examples now survive worldwide, including this one on display at Monino. Â The A-20G was the most produced version, and was the first to feature a solid rather than glazed nose. Post war, it was given the NATO codename \"Box\". Â Central Russian Air Force Museum, Monino.\n\nThese aircraft were delivered via the Alaska-Siberia air ferry route. Â In Soviet Air Force service, the aircraft had its baptism of fire at the end of June 1942. Â The Soviets were dissatisfied with the four .30-calibre Browning machine guns, capable of 600 rounds per gun per minute, and replaced them with the faster-firing, 7.62 mm (0.300 in) calibre ShKAS, capable of up to 1,800 rounds per gun per minute. Â During the summer of 1942, the Bostons flew ultra-low-level raids against German convoys heavily protected by flak. Â Attacks were made from altitudes as low as 33 ft (10 metres) and the air regiments suffered heavy losses.\n\nBy mid-1943 Soviet pilots were very familiar with the A-20B and A-20C. Â The general opinion was that the aircraft was overpowered and therefore fast and agile. Â It could make steep turns of up to 65Â° angle, while the tricycle landing gear made for easier take-offs and landings. Â The type could be flown even by crews with minimal training. Â The engines were reliable but sensitive to low temperatures, so the Soviet engineers developed special covers for keeping propeller hubs from freezing up. Â Some of these aircraft were armed with fixed-forward cannons and found some success in the ground attack role. Â By the end of the war, of the 3,414 A-20s delivered to the USSR, 2,771 were used by the Soviet Air Force. Â (Wikipedia).\n\nHawker Hurricane Mk.

A. Kuznetsov. Â (National Archives Photo)\n\nHawker Hurricane. Â 3,000 Hawker Hurricanes were delivered to the Soviet Union via the North Sea, the Far East and the Persian Gulf. Â The Hurricane was the first Western Allied aircraft to arrive in the Soviet Union and thus played a vital role at a crucial stage in the war on the Eastern Front. Â The first examples arrived in September 1941 and had an almost immediate impact on the war in the Arctic, where they flew air defence missions around the key warm water port of Murmansk. Â Throughout the winter of 1941- 1942, the Soviet Hurricanes suffered heavy losses against the highly-trained Luftwaffe pilots, but a significant number of Soviet pilots gained vital combat experience in the British fighter, before transitioning to P-39s, P-40s, and more advanced Soviet-built fighters. Â From Murmansk in the far North to Stalingrad in the South, the Soviet Hurricanes were used against the invading German military forces in a variety of roles, from air defence interception to ground attack aircraft and serving as spotters for artillery. Â As Lend-Lease deliveries continued and the Soviet aviation industry began to recover from its monumental evacuation eastward, the Hurricanes were slowly relegated to secondary duties. Â By the time deliveries of the British fighter ceased in 1944, nearly 3,000 examples had been sent to the Soviet Union. Â Although it was not the most popular fighter in the Soviet Union, the Hawker Hurricane played a key role in the first year of the war, and while Soviet war histories typically portray the fighter in a negative light, the aircraft undoubtedly contributed to the ultimate victory on the Eastern Front. Â (VVS Air War)\n\nLend-Lease aircraft deliveries were also of significance during the Battle of Moscow. Â While Soviet pilots praised the maneuverability of the homegrown I-153 Chaika and I-16 Ishak fighters, which were still in use in significant numbers in late 1941, both types were certainly obsolete and inferior in almost all regards to the British-supplied Hurricane. Â The Hurricane was rugged and tried and tested, and as useful at that point as many potentially superior Soviet designs such as the LaGG-3 and MiG-3.\n\nLaGG-3, 915, summer of 1943. Â (Soviet Air Force Photo)\n\n(Soviet Air Force Photo)\n\nLaGG-3 on parade, ca 1943. Â This aircraft was a refinement of the earlier LaGG-1, and was one of the most modern aircraft available to the Soviet Air Force at the time of the German invasion in 1941. Â It was overweight in spite of its wooden construction. Â At one stage 12 LaGG-3s were being completed daily and 6,528 had been built when factory 31 in Tbilisi switched to Yak-3 production in 1944.\n\nThere were apparently only 263 LaGG-3s in the Soviet inventory by the time of the Moscow counteroffensive, and it was an aircraft with numerous defects. Â At the end of 1941 there were greater numbers of the MiG-3, but the plane was considered difficult to fly. Â The Yak-1, arguably the best of the batch, and superior in most regards to the Hurricane, suffered from airframe and engine defects in early war production aircraft.\n\n(Soviet Air Force Photo)\n\nA total of 699 Lend-Lease aircraft had been delivered to Archangel by the time the Arctic convoys switched to Murmansk in December 1941. Â Of these, 99 Hurricanes and 39 Tomahawks were in service with the Soviet air defense forces on 1 Jan 1942, out of a total of 1,470 fighters. Â About 15 percent of the aircraft of the 6th Fighter Air Corps defending Moscow were Tomahawks or Hurricanes.\n\nThe Soviet Northern Fleet was also a major and early recipient of British Hurricanes, receiving those flown by No. 151 Wing of the RAF, which operated briefly from Soviet airfields near Murmansk. Â As early as 12 Oct 1941, the Soviet 126th Fighter Air Regiment was operating with Tomahawks bought from the United States by Britain. Â Tomahawks also served in defense of the Doroga Zhizni or âRoad of Lifeâ across the ice of Lake Ladoga, which provided the only supply line to the besieged city of Leningrad during the winter of 1941â42. Â By spring and summer of 1942 the Hurricane had clearly become the principal fighter aircraft of the Northern Fleetâs air regiments; in all, 83 out of its 109 fighters were of foreign origin.

Â The MiG-3 was difficult to fly in peacetime and much more so in combat. Â It had been designed for high-altitude combat but combat over the Eastern Front was generally flown at lower altitudes, where it was inferior to the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 as well as most of its Soviet contemporaries. Â It was also pressed into service as a fighter-bomber during the autumn of 1941 but it was equally unsuited for this.
