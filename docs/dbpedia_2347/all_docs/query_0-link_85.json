The German war machine destroyed outdated and unreliable Soviet aircraft in their thousands before the tide was ﬁnally turned. The USA, for its part, was able to draw upon British combat experience and some of its best late-war ﬁghters were derived directly from interaction with the British – the Mustang was originally designed for use by the RAF. By the time the USA was dragged into the war by the attack on Pearl Harbor on Sunday, December 7, 1941, it had the beginnings of a ﬁghter force to be reckoned with. During the ﬁnal year of the war, all three of these Allies were operating hugely powerful and capable ﬁghters that could not only take on the Luftwaffe’ss best but overmatch them. Allied Fighters examines the ﬁghter aircraft ﬂown by the RAF, Soviet VVS VV V and US Army Air Force during that time and presents detailed illustrations of notable individual machines.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhen the Second World War began in 1939, despite the many signs that conﬂict was imminent, no nation was truly ready for it – including the Germans. Yet German forces surprised even themselves by steamrollering their way through Europe, the Luftwaffe’s advanced ﬁghters largely able to overcome their less able opponents. The only nation able to withstand the Nazi ground assault was Great Britain – in large part due to the protective barrier formed by the English Channel. In the air, it was a different story however. Thanks to its own advanced ﬁghters and the skill and heroism of its pilots, the RAF alone was able to hold its own against the full and growing might of the Luftwaffe for more than a year – with the rest of Europe defeated, neutral or siding with the Germans, and the Soviets and the USA remaining neutral. During this time, neither of these latter two nations possessed ﬁghter aircra aft capable of tackling the Luftwaffe’s best on equa al terms. However, as Britain continued to resist, theyy both ploughed massive resources into improving g their ﬁghters – resulting in many of the types includ ded in this publication. When the Soviets were forced into the war by the German invasion comme encing on Sunday, June 22,\n\nDan Sharp\n\nllustrator and author Claess was born in 1957 and lives in the south hern part of Sweden. Since ﬁnishing fo our years of studies at the University off Uppsala, he has bee en active as a teacher, marketer, photographer and art director, among other occupationss. Sin nce childhood, Claes has had a strong interest in everything concerning the combat aircraft of the Sec cond World War and later. This inte erest stems from the e time when he,, as a boyy of seven,, started building g and d collecting plastic scale models. Simultaneously, he has been a keen draftsman for as long as he can rem member, as well as an accomplishe ed CGI artist in mo ore recent years. At present, Claes is producing boo oks, writing articles and lecturing. Up to now he hass produced more than 2000 CGI proﬁles, mostly of airc craft, but also of Second World Wa ar armour.

Designed during peacetime when defence budgets were small, the Hart nevertheless attracted substantial interest. Hawker capitalised on this by developing a wide range of variants based around the same winning features – an aerodynamic airframe and powerful Rolls-Royce V12 engine – and among these was a singleseat ﬁghter, the Hawker Fury. Fitted with a Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine, the Fury became the ﬁrst British ﬁghter to exceed 200mph in level ﬂight. Its aerobatic performance and rate of climb were exceptional too, but relatively few examples were ordered as\n\nT\n\nthe country struggled through the ravages of the Great Depression. With the economy turning a corner, in 1933 Hawker entered into discussions with the Air Ministry concerning a proposal to develop the Fury as a new monoplane ﬁghter. The company’s chief designer, Sydney Camm, had come up with a suitable design by January 1934 but revisions were required by the ministry including an enclosed cockpit and retractable undercarriage. With these added, a new speciﬁcation was drawn up around the design in August 1934. Six months later, Hawker was awarded a contract to build a prototype of the new single-seater and the ﬁrm’s engineers set to work. Construction was completed within nine months and the resulting aircraft, serial K5083, ﬁrst ﬂew on November 6, 1935,\n\nRICANE Hurricane Mk.I\n\nThis aircraftt, P2798, was ﬂown by Pilot Ofﬁcer Ian R Gleed of 87 Squadron, based at Lillle-Seclin in France during mid- to late-May 1940. Gleed joined the unit as a rep placement on May 17 and quickly became an ace, destroying a pair of Messerschm mitt Bf 110Cs the following day, then two Dornier Do 17Zs and a Bf 109E the day after – also sharing in an He 111 and with another Bf 109E claimed as a probable. He was kille ed in action on April 16, 1943, aged 26, having achieved 13 victories in air combat plus s three shared.\n\n! Hurricane was undergoing a redesign. Its engine controls were revised, its engine mountings were altered and its nose cowlings were changed to accommodate a new powerplant – the 1030hp Merlin II. This resulted in further delay and it would be over a year from the production order being placed to the ﬁrst production model aircraft being ﬂown, on October 12, 1937. Once the design was frozen, however, the experienced Hawker workshop crews were able to turn out Hurricanes more rapidly than expected. They made 40 in the ﬁrst three months and 111 Squadron, stationed at Northolt, received enough machines to equip a ﬂight before Christmas 1937. Spin trials necessitated an on-the-run modiﬁcation at this point and a larger rudder was ﬁtted in addition to an underﬁn. These began to appear on\n\nHurricanes reaching squadrons from February 1938 onwards. Some 200 Hurricanes had reached units by the end of 1938 and the British government had placed a second order, for another 1000, in the meantime. The aircraft was proving to be such a success that several foreign governments ordered it too, including Romania, Yugoslavia and Belgium. Hawker had by now completed a new factory at Langley to help build it and a deal was signed on January 4, 1939, for the Canadian Car and Foundry Company to build it under licence in Canada. The ﬁrst Canadian Hurricane, a Mk.I, ﬂew in January 1940 and at the end of that year a new Canadian-exclusive variant was created, the Mk.X, which was powered by a Packard-built Merlin 28 engine and had 12 Browning\n\nTHE FIRST HURRICANE UNIT BEGAN TO TH RECEIVE RE ITS MACHINES TOWARDS THE END OF 1937\n\npowered by a Rolls-Royce PV-12 – the earliest version of what would later be renamed Merlin. The aircraft had a metal cross-braced fabric-covered fuselage, fabric-covered wings and a tailplane supported by struts. Armament was to be four .303in Browning machine guns in each wing, though a version with four 20mm cannon had been proposed and rejected. In early 1936, after company tests, K5083 was sent to the Aircraft and Armament Experimental Establishment at Martlesham Heath for handling trials. Finally, in mid1936 the aircraft was given the name Hurricane and put into full scale production with an order for 600 examples on the company’s books. But even as production lines were being prepared, the\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS 007\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nmachine guns corresponding to the Hurricane Mk.IIB in England. A Mk.XI was made in small numbers as a trainer with a modiﬁed throttle system but the major Canadian production model was the Mk.XII, ﬁrst ﬂown in November 1941. A later version with only eight guns was designated the Mk.XIIA. Meanwhile, further design changes up to the beginning of 1939 in England included the replacement of the Merlin II with the 1310hp Merlin III, standardisation of triple ejector exhaust manifolds and the adoption of a three-bladed de Havilland two-pitch propeller. There was a move towards replacing the fabric wing covering\n\nHAWKER HURRICANE\n\nwith a stressed metal skin too. Experimental trials were conducted with tropical cal ﬁlters and sand guards, in the increasingly creasingly likely event that the Hurricane urricane would be required to ﬂy in the Middle East, and one machine was tested with a 20mm mm Oerlikon autocannon ﬁtted in a pod under each wing. Later in the yearr another new engine, the Merlin XII, was trialled. d. When the Second World War began, on Septemberr 3, 1939, there were 19 RAF squadrons uadrons ﬂying a full complement ent of Hurricanes. It was one e of these aircraft, a 1 Squadron uadron\n\nHurricane Mk.I Having joined the RAF in 1935, Robert S Tuck of 257 Squadron was promoted to squadron leader in September 1940. V6 6864 was his Hurricane while based at Coltishall, England, during December 1940 0. On January ryy 28, 1942, he was hit by anti-aircraft ﬁre, forced to land in occupie ed France and taken prisoner. By that time he had achieved 29 victories plus two o shared. He later escaped from Stalag Luft III on February ryy 1, 1945, and spent time ﬁghting alongside Russian troops before returning home via the British emb bassy in Moscow.\n\n!\n\n008\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\n!\n\nHurricane Mk.I The highest scoring RAF pilot during the Battle of Britain was Sergeant Josef Frantisek of 303 (Polish) Squad dron. He ﬂew R4175 while based at Northolt, Ealing, England, during Augustt 1940. Frantisek, who was actually a Czech, had escaped to Poland in 1938 8 when the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia. He was killed in a ﬂying accide ent on October 8, 1940, with a total of 17 air combat victories to his name.\n\nHurricane Mk.I Flyying Ofﬁcer William L ‘Willie’ McKnight, of 24 42 Squadron based at Duxford, England, ﬂew P2 2961 with its distinctive half skeleton and bo oot-kicking-Hitler artwork during September 19 940. McKnight was the second Canadian ace of the war and had 17 victories in air combat plus two shared when he was shot down and killed, aged 22, on January ryy 12, 1941, while ta aking part in a ﬁghter sweep over Calais.\n\n!\n\nA HURRICANE SCORED THE RAF’S FIRST AERIAL VICTORY OF THE WAR ON OCTOBER 30, 1939\n\nHurricane ﬂown by Pilot Ofﬁcer Peter ‘Boy’ Mould, that would score the RAF’s ﬁrst air-to-air victory of the war – shooting down a German Dornier Do 17 P reconnaissance aircraft near Toul in France on October 30, 1939. During the invasion of Norway in 1940, it became evident that the RAF lacked ﬁghters equipped for long-range operations, particularly over water, and Hawker began working on the provision of new underwing fuel tanks, ﬂoats and ski undercarriages for the Hurricane. The ﬁrm also continued to ramp up production – the RAF’s Fighter Command had an average of 1326 Hurricanes on strength between July 10 and October 31, 1940. Another Rolls-Royce Merlin, the XX, became standard equipment from August 1940 – resulting in the Hurricane Mk.IIA. Front line units began to receive these from September, but the design continued to evolve with\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS 009\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS the Mk.IIA Series 2 featuring a slightly lengthened nose. Armament was improved with the addition of yet another four .303 Browning machine guns, for a total of 12. This resulted in another variant – the Mk.IIB. The Mk.IIC had an even more potent armament of four 20mm cannon, with production commencing on January 20, 1941. The Battle of Britain, between August and October 1940, had seen the air war become one of attrition with Hurricane losses mounting rapidly. Yet by March 1941 Hawker was able to produce 12 Hurricanes every day. And the output of the Kingston, Brooklands, Langley and Hucclecote\n\n010\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nANE HAWKER HURRICANE factories was supplemented by the arrival of 10 Hurricanes a week by ship from Canada. During August 1941, an initial batch of 39 Mk.IIA Series 2 and Mk.IIB Hurricanes were sent to Russia to help Britain’s ally ﬁght off the German invasion, which had begun ﬁve months earlier. Shipments continued as the war progressed and a grand total of 2952 Hurricanes were sent – though the number that actually arrived is uncertain since many were lost when the vessels carrying them were sunk k.

He ﬂew this aircraft while based in Vayenga, USSR, on September 17, 1941. During the Battle of Britain, Elkington shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 on August 15, 1940, only to be shot down and wounded himself the following day by German ace Helmut Wick. He ended the war with that one victory plus two shared and at the time of writing was still alive aged 96.\n\n!\n\nHawker Hurricane Mk.IIC HV505 saw service with 336 (Greek) Squadron, stationed at Sidi Barani in Eg gypt during g Mayy 1943.\n\n!\n\nHurricane Mk.I\n\nOn September 24, 1940, ﬂying Hurricane P3878, Flying Ofﬁcer Harold Bird-Wilson of 17 Squadron, based at Debden, England, had the dubious distinction of becoming the 40th ‘kill’ of German ace Adolf Galland of JG 26. He bailed out, landed in the Thames and was picked up by a navy vyy vessel. He went on to serve throughout the war and afterwards, rising to the rank of air vice marshal. Bird-Wilson died in 2000 aged 81.\n\nBY MARCH 1941, MORE THAN A DOZEN HURRICANES WERE BEING BUILT EVERY DAY\n\nHurricane Mk.IIC\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS 011\n\nTHE CANNON-ARMED HURRICANE MK.IID’S MAIN ROLE WAS GROUND-ATTACK\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nP3059 was ﬂown byy Pilot Ofﬁcer Kenneth ‘Hawkeye’ Lee, 501 Squadron, ba ased at Hawkinge, Englan nd, on August 18, 1940. He was on a patrol at 17,000ft ovver Canterbury when Lu uftwaff ffe f ace Oberleutnant Gerhard Schöpfel shot down his machine and three others in a single pass. The attack was so sudden that even though Lee was the e last to fall, he had no warning until a bullet hit his leg an nd another hit his seat from behind and ﬁlled his shoulder with metall fragments. He bailed out and su urvived, continuing to ﬂy and d ﬁght until he was sh hot down over Crete an nd taken prisoner by th he Germans, ﬁnally beiing liberated in 1945.

Clowes scored 10 victories plus one shared d.\n\n!\n\n012\n\nMerlin engine, was never built. Entering production in 1943, the Mk.IV was built in relatively low numbers – 524 compared to, for example, 4711 Mk.IICs. However, it was the ﬁrst Hawker aircraft to make widespread use of 3in rockets for ground-attack ahead of their more well-known use with the Typhoon during 1944. Just two Hurricane Mk.Vs were made. They were essentially Mk.IVs ﬁtted with groundboosted Merlin 32 engines and four-bladed Rotol propellers. Thorough trials determined that there was no real advantage to this conﬁguration and both Mk.Vs – KZ193 and NL255 – were returned to their original Mk.IV form. The other major variant of the type was the Sea Hurricane.\n\nHurricane Mk.I\n\n!\n\nProduction of an even more powerfully-armed Hurricane, the Mk.IID, commenced in 1942. This had a pair of 40mm cannon in underwing pods plus a pair of wing-mounted Brownings loaded with tracers for aiming purposes. Its primary role was ground-attack against tanks and other armoured ﬁghting vehicles. A handful of Mk.IIDs were used in Europe, ﬁtted with Rolls-Royce BF cannon, while the majority of them were sent to the Middle East ﬁtted with Vick kers ‘S’ Class cannon. The former had just 12 rounds per gun while the latter had 15. With a variety of different Hurricane marks now in use, Hawker decided that a universal wing should be produced which could mount a variety of different loads – particularly for groundattack. This, combined with ﬁtment of a 1620hp Merlin 24/27, became the basis for the new Mk.IV. The Mk.III, which was to have been a Hurricane powered by an American Packard-produced\n\nR HURRICANE HAWKER !\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS 013\n\nHAWKER HURRICANE\n\nTHE LAST HAWKER HURRICANE ROLLED OFF THE PRODUCTION LINE IN JULY 1944\n\nALLIED LIE ED FIGHTERS\n\nHURRICANE MK.IIC Canadian Pilot Ofﬁcer Albertt U ‘Bert’ Houle Jr, who had previously been a boxer and wrestling champion, and worked as a miner, enlisted in 1940 before training as a pilot and eventually being stationed at Edku, Egypt, witth 213 Squadron, during the spring of 1942. He ended the war with three victories plus one shared and died in 2008.\n\nHURRICANE MK.IIB The distinctively marked BD930 as it looked when serving with 73 Squadron, based in Gambut Main n, Libya, during Apil 1942.\n\n014\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nHURRICANE MK.I Polish ace Squadron Leader Witold Urbanowicz ﬂew with 303 (Polish) Squadron, based at Northolt, England, during September 1940. On the 27th, he shot down four enemy aircraft – two Ju 88s, a Bf 109 and a Bf 110. Three days later, he shot down another three Bf 109s and a Do 17. He achieved 18 victories overall plus three shared. During the war none of the aircraft he ﬂew was ever hit by an enemy bullet and he died in 1996 aged 88.\n\nDuring the campaign in 1940 Norway campaign, Hurricanes of 46 Squadron had been ﬂown from HMS Glorious – a First World War battlecruiser converted into an aircraft carrier – and it was decided that the ﬁghter would be suitable for operations defending Allied shipping. Early Sea Hurricanes were created by modifying existing Mk.Is with catapult gear. The ﬁrst example also featured an arrester hook but this was deleted from the remainder of the initial batch of 50, known as Sea Hurricane Mk.IAs. Rather than being launched from aircraft carriers, single Sea Hurricanes were to be launched individually from catapults ﬁtted to merchant vessels. These ships did not possess any means of recovering their Hurricane, once it had been launched, so the pilot was usually required to either bale out or ditch their machine in the sea and hope for rescue. The success of these aircraft in shooting down Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor long-range maritime patrol aircraft – ﬁve by the end of 1941 – resulted in an order being placed for another 300. These were again\n\nconverted from existing Mk.Is but this time with arrestor hooks ﬁtted, making them Sea Hurricane Mk.IBs. Twenty-ﬁve Mk.IIA Series 2s were also converted, also becoming Sea Hurricane Mk.IBs. Rather than being launched from single one-shot catapults, the hooked aircraft were embarked upon converted merchantmen known as MACships which had short ﬂight decks ﬁtted. These too enjoyed considerable success, paving the way for the Sea Hurricane Mk.IC, which was converted from the Hurricane IIC. The ﬁnal Sea Hurricane was the Mk.IIC, a variant ﬁtted with both an arrester hook and a naval radio. A limited number of Canadian-built Hurricane XIIAs were also converted to Sea Hurricane conﬁguration. Overall, 14,533 Hurricanes had been built by the end of July 1944, when production ﬁnally ceased with PZ865, a Mark IIC known as ‘The Last of the Many’. This aircraft was bought by Hawkers and kept in storage at Langley. Today it continues to ﬂy with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight in Lincolnshire. • ALLIED FIGHTERS 015\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nSUPERMARINE\n\n1936-1961\n\nNote: Only the main wartime landbased ﬁghter versions of the Spitﬁre are covered in this account.\n\n016\n\nThe iconic Supermarine Spitﬁre became e a symbol of British resistance nce in the face of the Luftwaffe onslaught during the Battle of Britain. The subject of continual evolution and enhancement, it remained at the forefront of the action throughout the war.\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\naving previously concentrated almost entirely on ﬂying boats and seaplanes, Supermarine’s chief designer R J Mitchell ﬁrst began to consider working on land-based ﬁghter aircraft in February 1931. The Air Ministry had been discussing the speciﬁcation for a new singleseat night and day ﬁghter since 1929 but had yet to release a formal set of requirements. Drawing on the company’s experience with building metal wings and stressed skin structures for its Schneider Cup racers, Mitchell prepared two designs\n\nH\n\nunder the designation Type 178 – on ne a biplane and the other a monoplane. Apart from their wing layout, they had many features in common, such as a ﬁxed undercarriage and the use of a Rolls-Royce Kestrel ‘S’ engine. Finally, Speciﬁcation F.7/30 for a single-seat ﬁghter was issued in October 1931 and Mitchell submitted the monoplane to meet it in February 1932 while development work continued, with the design being redesignated Type 224.

During the ﬁerce ﬁghting over Dunkirk in June 1940 he ﬂew this Spitﬁre Mk.I while stationed at Hornchurch, England. A South African, Malan was nicknamed ‘sailor’ for having previously been a naval ofﬁcer cadet. He ended the war with 27 victories in air combat plus seven shared and died from Parkinson’s disease in 1963.\n\nSpitﬁre e Mk.IA\n\n!\n\nFlight Lieu utenant Alan C Deere of 54 Squadron,, stationed at Hornchurch, England, shot down a Bf 109 while ﬂying this aircrafft on August 11, 1940.

Rolls-Royce managed to supply an example of what was now known as the Goshawk on December 8 and it was duly installed, the work not being ﬁnished until February 10, 1934, due to the aircraft’s complicated evaporative cooling system. The Type 224’s ﬁrst ﬂight took place on February 19. It had an inverted gullwing arrangement, a ﬁxed undercarriage and an open cockpit. Its performance,\n\nthough not poor, was still a disappointment, particularly given the years of work that had already been put into it. The cooling system failed to operate as expected and the engine suffered from overheating. Eventually the F.7/30 competition was won by the Gloster Gladiator but Supermarine did not give up on the Type 224. Instead, its development continued under the new designation Type 300. Supermarine offered this to the Air Ministry as two options – the ﬁrst an upgrade of the existing Type 224 prototype,\n\nthe second incorporating the same features but as part of an entirely new design. Type 300 replaced the inve erted gullwings with conventional straight ones housing machine guns. It also had a retractable undercarriage and featured a fully enclosed cockpit. By mid1934 the Type 300 was being worked on outside the usual speciﬁcation structure as an experimental aircraft. The Air Ministry asked for a cost estimate to build it as a prototype in September 1934. By this point the cockpit had been lowered and aerodynamically shaped wing ﬁllets had been added, the wings themselves becoming thinner and more elliptical in ALLIED FIGHTERS 017\n\nshape. The undercarriage had been further modiﬁed too, and the type now carried four Vickers .303in machine guns – two in each wing outboard of the propeller. A new speciﬁcation, F.37/34, was drafted speciﬁcally for the Type 300 and on January 3, 1935, Supermarine received a contract to build a prototype. It would be powered by a new Rolls-Royce engine, the PV-12, rather than the Goshawk, which had proven to be unreliable. A new Air Staff Requirement for an eight-gun ﬁghter, F.10/35, was issued in April 1935 but withdrawn when it became clear that both the Supermarine design and another being developed by Hawker could meet its speciﬁcation. The Type 300’s armament was changed to eight Browning .303s, four in each wing and detail design and construction of the ﬁrst prototype began. The prototype, serial K5054, was rolled out in early 1936 and made its ﬁrst ﬂight on March 5. A new two-bladed wooden propeller was then ﬁtted and the aircraft ﬂew again on March 10. Tests revealed that the aircraft could reach a top speed of 330mph but this was improved to 348mph with the addition of another new propeller in May 1936. Reports from pilots were universally positive, with only minor requests for alterations – such as the addition of an und dercarriiage posiition ind dicattor. The Air Ministry therefore placed an order for 310 production models on June 3, 1936. It was around this time that the name ‘Spitﬁre’ was formally applied. Work on setting up production lines for the Spitﬁre progressed\n\nRINE SPITFIRE SUPERMARINE Spitﬁre Mk.IA\n\n!\n\nTHE SUPERMARINE TYPE 300 FORMALLY BECAME THE SPITFIRE DURING THE SUMMER OF 1936\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nOn September 3, 1940, having just achieved his ﬁfth aerial victory ry, y becoming g an ‘ace’, Pilot Ofﬁcer Richa ard H Hillary ryy of 603 Squadron, stationed at Hornchurc ch, England, was shot down himself.

This ﬁrst happened during ﬁring trials in March 1937 and was eventually resolved by installing ducting which diverted hot air from the underwing radiators to the interior of the wings. It was not until July 1938, around a year later than scheduled, that deliveries of the ﬁrst full production Spitﬁre Mk.Is were ﬁnally being made to Fighter Command. From late 1938 a Barr and Stroud GM 2 reﬂector gunsight was ﬁtted to Spitﬁre Mk.Is. Now an order for another 1000 Spitﬁres was placed, with a new factory being built at Castle Bromwich expressly for this purpose. Further orders followed in 1939 for ﬁrst another 200, then another 450 – a grand total of 2160. With the 1030hp Merlin Mk.III engine ﬁtted as standard, driving a 10ft 8in diameter Aero Products two-bladed wooden propeller, the earliest production Spitﬁres were able to achieve a top speed of 362mph at 18,500ft with a maximum climb rate of 2490ft per minute at 10,000ft. Service ceiling was 31,900ft. However, from the 78th Spiitﬁre, a three-b blad ded d 9ft 8in diameter two-position metal de Havilland propeller was installed which improved service ceiling, up to 34,400ft, and top speed – up to 367mph. In addition, the ‘ﬂat’ canopy of the earliest Spitﬁres was soon replaced\n\nDespite his short stature, Flight Lieutenan nt Eric S ‘Sawn off Lockie’ Lock of 611 Squad dron was one of the RAF’s ﬁnest aces.

The handpum mp-operated undercarriage retraction system was also replaced with a hydra aulic pump. It was this version of the Spitﬁre th hat went to war in Septem mber 1939. From mid-194 40, the Mk.I also received d 73lb of steel armour plating for the pilot’s seat and headrest, plus the e front of the glycol he eader tank. An improved d propeller from de Havilla and – constant speed rathe er than twoposition – wa as introduced from late June 194 40 and Identiﬁcation Frien nd or Foe (IFF) equipment for rad dar was installed from September 1940. This was\n\noutwardly visible as wires which ran from the tip ps of the tailp plan nes to the sides of the rear fuselage. All of these changes resulted in substantially increased weight and the Spitﬁres that fought the Battle of Britain had a top speed on normal power of only 353mph at 20,000ft as a result. However, the constant speed propeller provided a signiﬁcantly improved rate of climb to compensate – 2895ft per minute at 10,000ft. In addition, thanks to the availability of 100 octane fuel, Spitﬁre pilots could apply an ‘emergency boost’ for up to ﬁve minutes during combat. This effectively increase power to 1310hp at 9000ft and increased top speed by 34mph at 10,000ft. During June 1940, the RAF received its ﬁrst Spitﬁre Mk.IBs. These were ﬁtted with a single Hispano 20mm cannon in each wing, in place of the Browning machine guns. However, due to jamming problems with the cannon, it was decided that a compromise – two cannon and four machine guns – would work best. A total of 1567 Mk.Is were built.\n\nTHE FIRST CANNON-ARMED SPITFIRE WAS INTRODUCED DURING JUNE 1940\n\nSpitﬁre Mk.VA\n\n!\n\nWing Comman nder Marian Pisarek had shot down a German Henschel Hs 126 on the ﬁrst day of the war, September 1, 1939, while ﬂying a Polish PZL P-11C.

It was decided that this new version, the Mk.II would be built at Castle Bromwich and would feature a new Rotolmade 10ft 9in propeller which had already been ﬁtted to some Mk.Is. Performance was improved at lower altitudes, though the Mk.II’s absolute top speed was lower than that of the Mk.I due to weight increases. The Mk.II was available in both IIA eight machine gun and IIB cannon weapons conﬁgurations and fast deliveries from the facttory meantt thatt alll Mk.IIs had d been replaced with Mk.IIs in front line units by April 1941.

Unfortunately, the powerplant’s development was dela ayed and the ﬁrst ﬂight of a Grifffon Spitﬁre prototype, the Mk.IV V, did not take place until Nove ember 27, 1941. The sha ape of the Griffon meant that the Mk k.IV was visually distinct fro om its pre edecessors, with large bu ulges on the cowling over the cylind der he eads and d a te eard dro op fairing on the upper forward cowling ovver the magneto. The lower cowling had a shallower curvve up to the spinner, and the spin nner itself was much larger than n those of earlier marks. The propeller itself was a fourblad ded 10ft 5in Rotol type and as seen from the cockpit it\n\nrotated to the left, rather than to the right as with the Merlin. The remainder of the Mk.IV was similar to the Mk.III. Pilots found that the Mk.IV prototype, DP845, had much more power on take-off than the Merlin Spitﬁre and tended to swing to the right – which had to be counteracted by moving the rudder to the left. The Mk.IV was ﬁtted with mock-up installations for three cannon in each wing and then redesignated Mk.XX to prevent it being confused with the reconnaissance type Spitﬁre PR Mk.IV. It was redesignated again to Mk.XII.\n\nSPITFIRE MK.V\n\nThe next major production version of the Spitﬁre after the Mk.II was the Mk.V – which was essentially the same aircraft but ﬁtted with the new Merlin 45 engine, which produced 1440hp with a single-speed single-stage supercharger. Work began on the new design immediately after the Battle of Britain, in late 1940. Changes to the carburettor at this point meant that the Spitﬁre was able to perform any ano oeuvre e witho out causing g fu uel ma ﬂow problems. Previously, certain negative G aerobatic move es could result in the engine cutting out due to fuel starvation. A number of Mk.I and Mk.II Spitﬁres were upgraded to Mk.V with the new powerplant but the majority were newly built at Castle Bromwich. The ﬁrst version n of the\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS 023 AL\n\nTHE ADDITION OF A SIZABLE VOKES AIR FILTER MADE TROPICALISED VERSIONS OF THE SPITFIRE VISUALLY DISTINCTIVE\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\n024\n\nMk.V, introduced in 1941, was the Mk.VA (Supermarine Type 331), with four .303 Brownings per wing. Its top speed was 375mph at 20,800ft and the climb up to that altitude could be accomplished in a little over seven minutes. The second, and production standard version was the Spitﬁre Mk.VB (Supermarine Type 349), which featured a continuous ﬂow of modiﬁcations throughout its relatively lengthy production lifespan. These included an improved windscreen like that of the Mk.III, a range of different propellers and spinners, a system for increasing the ﬂow off hot air ption into the gun bays, the option ps to to have ‘clipped’ wingtips rspeed at increase roll-rate and airspeed low altitude – reducing wingspan ion to to 32ft 2in – and the option use ‘slipper’ drop tanks ﬁtted e section. beneath the wing centre A variety of different versions of the Merlin 45 were ﬁtted to Spitﬁre e Mk.VBs too, such as the er Merlin 45M with a smaller supercharger impeller. A less numerous but more on was visually distinctive version able Vokes the Mk.VB (trop). A sizeable der the air ﬁlter was installed under aircraft’s nose to preventt dust, cal or dirt and sand from tropical tering desert environments entering the engine. This cut top speed limb rate by 8mph and reduced climb bl d by 600ft per minute but enabled the Spitﬁre to operate in harsh conditions around the world. The second revision of the type was the Mk.VC (Supermarine Type 349). This featured a strengthened fuselage, new windscreen, a revised undercarriage, a deeper radiator fairing under the starboard wing, a larger oil cooler with kinked air outlet under the port wing, C-type wings and armour for the bottom of the pilot’s seat and wing ammunition boxes. With the appropriate gear, it was also able to carry a single 250lb bomb under each wing – a ﬁrst for a Spitﬁre. The C-type wing was designed to be easier and faster to manufacture and could be reconﬁgured for a number of different weapons arrangements – most commonly two cannon and four machine guns. A tropicalized version of the Mk.VC was sent overseas in large numbers to be used in the Mediterranean and Paciﬁc theatres. Overall Spitﬁre Mk.V production totalled 6479.

A new non-sliding canopy was introduced which had to be ot locked into position over the pilot en once he had climbed aboard, then sealed by inﬂating a rubber tube on inside the cockpit. By comparison to modern pressurised aircraft, the pressurisation was only slight and made 37,000ft feel more like 28,000ft for the pilot.

The standard B-type wings were modiﬁed to incorporate pointed tips, which resulted in a wingspan of 40ft 2in. Top speed was just 356mph at 21,800ft but service ceiling was 39,200ft, compared to 35,000ft for the Mk.VB. Only 100 Mk.VIs were made because the Germans never put a high-altitude bomber into full series production, let alone front line service.\n\nSPITFIRE MK.VII\n\nThe performance of the Mk.VI had been disappointing so the Mk.VII represented an attempt to make improvements. With a similar pressurised cockpit to that of the Mk.VI, it was now powered by a Merlin 64 with a two-stage two-speed supercharger. It had pointed-tip wings like the Mk.VI, but derived from the C-type rather than the B-type. Although early versions had the same jettisonable hood as the Mk.VI, this was later replaced with a more conventional sliding version – albeit double glazed. The new engine meant the Mk.VII’s performance was signiﬁcantly improved over that of the Mk.VI, with a service ceiling of 45,100ft. A total of 140 were built.\n\nSPITFIRE MK.VIII\n\nWith the Luftwaffe’s introduction of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the Spitﬁre Mk.VB was outclassed and an improved version was urgently needed. This was intended to be the Mk.VIII (Supermarine Type 360). It was very similar to the Mk.VII but without the pressurised cockpit. Some even featured the same pointed wingtips but most had standard wings. 026\n\nSpitﬁre Mk.IXC With the Pop peye artwork of its previous pilot painted d over, EN398 was ﬂown by Wing Commanderr Jame es E ‘Johnnie’ Johnson during April 1943.

There were three main versions of the Mk.VIII – the Merlin 66-powered LF for low altitude operations, capable of 404mph at 21,000ft; the Merlin 63-powered F for medium altitude, capable of 408mph at 25,000ft; and the HF, with Merlin 70, for high altitude work – which could reach 416mph at 26,500ft. The Mk.VIII’s main fuel tanks\n\nwere extended to give a range of 660 miles or 1180 miles with a drop tank. With a slipper tank, it could manage 1500 miles. An external bomb load of up to 1000lb was possible. The Mk.VIII was mostly used outside the European theatre – in the Mediterranean, the Paciﬁc and in China--Burma-India. Overall,\n\nSpitﬁre Mk.IXC This aircraft was ﬂown by Flying Ofﬁcer H W B Patterson of 485 (New Zealand) Squadron, stationed at Selsey in England, on June 8, 1944.

A Mk.III had been tested with the new Merlin 61 – originally designed for the Wellington Mk.VI high-altitude bomber – in September 1941 and the results had been impressive. It was therefore decided that Mk.VC airframes should be modiﬁed to take the Merlin 61, resulting in the Mk.IX. Full production of bespoke Mk.IXs then commenced. During early 1943, the Merlin 61 was replaced with the improved Merlin 63 and 63A. In the latter half of 1943 these too were superseded by the 1720hp Merlin 66. The Merlin 66-powered LF Mk.IX, with a top speed of 404mph at 21,000ft, became the workhorse of the RAF’s ﬁghter squadrons from its introduction through to the end of the war. Compared against a captured Bf 109G-6 6/U2 with GM-1 1 nitrous oxide injection by the Central Fighter Establishment in late 1944, the LF Mk.IX was found to be superior in every respect except acceleration in a dive. Manoeuvrability was found to be “greatly superior” and it was noted that the LF.IX “easily out-turns the Bf 109 in either direction at\n\n028\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nSUPERMARINE SPITFIRE\n\nall speeds”.

A bigger oil tank – containing 10 gallons rather than six – was required and at the rear of the d aircraft a new tail unit was installed to help provide balance. This featured a new taller and much broader ﬁn and larger rudder. During early tests, the new design managed an incredible 445mph at 25,000ft and a climb rate of more than 5000ft per minute. The only problem was range. With 109.5 gallons in two main tanks and a tank in the leading edge of each wing, it could manage just over 460 miles.\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nSpitﬁre Mk.XIVE Just a week from the end of the Second World War in Europe, on n May 1, 1945, Flying Ofﬁcer Eric ‘Ricky’ Gray of 41 Squadron stationed at Celle e, Germany, ﬂew this Spitﬁre Mk.XIV.

Later versions of the Spitﬁre Mk.XIV had the rear fuselage cut back and a bubble canopy installed. Towards the end of 1944, 150 octane fuel was introduced which served to further increase the Mk.XIV’s already superior top p sp peed. The Mk.XIVE could manage 449 9mph at 24,500ft.

His operational career began in 1939 ﬂying Hurricanes but by May 1943 he was ﬂying this early model Typhoon with 609 Squadron stationed at Duxford in Cambridgeshire, England. Beamont was one of the Typhoon’s strongest advocates, even as it was gaining a reputation for structural problems. Overall, he ﬂew 492 combat sorties and achieved nine victories in air combat plus 36 V-1 ﬂying bombs and 25 locomotives destroyed. He died in 2001 aged 81.\n\nHAWKER TYPHOON\n\nStriking fear into the hearts of German tank crews as the original rocket-ﬁring ‘jabo’ earned the Typhoon its place in history. It was anything but an overnight success, however. nce an order had been placed for the Hurricane, though before it had reached full production, Hawker chief designer Sydney Camm and his team began work on its successor. It was uncertain at this stage, however, which of the new 2000hp 24-cylinder engines then in development would be available to power the ﬁghter. Hawker therefore worked up two designs in parallel during 1937 – one to be ﬁtted with the Rolls-Royce Vulture and the other the Napier Sabre. An Air Ministry speciﬁcation, F.18/37, was issued in March 1938 which outlined a ﬁghter capable of 400mph at 15,000ft powered by a British engine with a twospeed supercharger. It was to have 12 Browning machine guns with 500 rounds per gun but had to be capable of accepting alternative weapon loads. Hawker was well prepared for this. The ﬁrst engine to reach a state of readiness was the Vulture – which meant that the\n\n1940-1945\n\nO\n\n032\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nHawker design intended for this, the Tornado, was built and ﬂew ﬁrst, on October 6, 1939. The Sabre design, the Typhoon, was not ready for its maiden ﬂight until February 24, 1940, due to delays in completing its Sabre engine. While the Typhoon was similar in size to the Hurricane, being slightly shorter in the fuselage but slightly longer in wingspan, it was built differently. The forward fuselage was made of bolted and welded duralumin or steel tubes covered with skin panels. The rear portion, aft of the cockpit, was a semi-monocoque structure. The thick 41ft 7in span wings\n\nTyphoon Mk.IB During June 1944 this rocket-armed Typhoon oon was ﬂown by Flight Lieutenant Eric H A Vernon-Jarvis of 175 Squadron from St Croix in France.

A side effect of these cap pacious wings was high drag, wh hich served to prevent the Typhoon from ﬂying faster than 410mp ph. Its rate of climb was also dissappointing.\n\nAfter some uneventful early ﬂights, the ﬁrst prototype P5212 suffered a structural failure in mid-air during a test on May 9, 1940. A large crack appeared behind the pilot’s seat at the point where the forward and rear fuselage sections were joined. The pilot, Philip Lucas, managed to land the aircraft nevertheless.\n\nTyphoon Mk.IB Squadron Leader Leon O J Prévot was appointed the commander of newly formed Typhoon unit 197 Squadron on November 21, 1942, having already achieved his three aerial victories of the war. Stationed at Tangmere in England, he was ﬂying this aircraft on ground-attack missions in June 1943 shortly before he was rested from active duty and became a Typhoon instructor. He died in 1994.\n\n!

The aircraft was ﬂown by Pilot Ofﬁcer Charles A Tidy of 3 Squadron, based at Swanton Morley in England. Tidy not only managed to escape his stricken Typhoon but also evaded capture by the Germans on the ground until September when France was liberated and he was able to return to his unit.

He ended the war with four victories and two shared and afterwards rose to the rank of air marshal. He died in 1996 aged 77.\n\n!\n\nTyphoon Mk.IB\n\n!\n\nSix days later, the Governm ment decided to concentrate production on just ﬁve aircraft types – the Spitﬁre, Hurricane,, Whitley, Wellington and Blenhe eim – at the expense of everything else. The Typhoon’s development priority was lowered and progress slowed. A second prototype was not ﬂown until May 3, 1941, and in the meantime, armament had been changed to four 20mm Hispano Mk.II cannon with 140 rounds per gun. This aircraft, P5216, served as the prototype for the production model Typhoon Mk.IB. However, engine development had now progressed to a point where the Vulture seemed much more promising g than the Sabre. As a resultt, Hawker was ordered to proce eed with building 500 Tornado os but only 250 Typhoons.

The huge Sabre engine also caused the cockpit to become stiﬂingly hot after prolonged use. An unusual feature of the Typhoon was the ‘car doors’ which opened onto its cockpit in place of a conventional hinged or sliding canopy. They even had winddown windows. There was also a dorsal fairing attached to the rear of the cockpit, which severely hampered rearward visibility. The aircraft’s greatest vice had yet to make itself known,\n\nRoyce Vulture was signiﬁcantly less reliable than expected. The Vulture was cancelled in July and with it the Tornado. Typhoon production was rapidly stepped up and the ﬁrst machines off the line were rushed into service with 56 and 609 Squadrons.

A few months later, in early 1943, new Typhoons had plumbing installed in their wings which allowed them to use 45-gallon drop tanks – improving range dramatically from 690 miles to 1090 miles. Larger solid rubber tailwheels were introduced in March 1943 to prevent shimmying and by mid-1943 every Typhoon was built with the attachment points needed to carry the new bomb racks. This also made small extensions to the cannon shell case ejector slots necessary so they would drop clear of any bombs or tanks ﬁtted. In addition, around 780lb of armour was added to protect the cockpit, engine and radiator bath from ground ﬁre. Larger brake discs were eventually ﬁtted too, to cope with the extra weight. Experiments with ﬁtting launch rails for 60lb RP-3 rockets were conducted in June 1943 and these were ﬁtted to o Typhoons operated by specialist ﬁghter-bomber unit 181 Squadro on from October 1943.

The ﬁtment of reinforcing plates parttially cured the problem but it wa as never wholly solved. Longer exhaust stubs were ﬁtted d in an attempt to ﬁx the CO2 prob blem in November 1941, and portt cockpit doors were sealed over. In ad ddition, a ventilation tube was installed to try and keep cockpit temperratures down and two vents were ﬁttted below the port side radio hatch for the same purpose. The dorsal fairing was replaced with a transpa arent blister nicknamed the ‘cofﬁn hood’ to improve visibility. Fina ally, towards the end of 1942 and after numerous further testts, the Typhoon was able to de emonstrate an acceptable le evel of reliability and co ontinued to be used to coun nter Luftwaffe nuisance raids on the south coast of England. Meanw while, bomb racks were\n\nin nstituted for older machines. Early in 1944, it was decided that a four-bladed propeller should replace the original three-bladed type and that the larger tailplane of the Hawker Tempest should be ﬁtted to improve stability – but both of these modiﬁcations took some time to introduce. By the time of the D-Day la andings and the subsequent Normandy campaign, the RAF had 18 operational Typhoon Mk.IB squadrons as part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force and a further nine as part of Air Defence of Great Britain. The dust and dirt whipped up by the powerful Sabre when the Typhoon was operating from hastily prepared forward landing grounds on the Continent necessitated the ﬁtment of air ﬁlters and at the end of June 1944 it was decided that all Typhoons should have tropical ﬁlter kits installed as standard. While the Typhoon came increasingly to be regarded as a developmental dead end, several unusual versions were contemplated – R8694 was experimentally ﬁtted with the more powerful Sabre IV by Napier, achieving a maximum speed of 452mph; R7881 became a prototype night ﬁghter ﬁtted with an AI (Airborne Interception) radar and a few examples of the Typhoon FR IB reconnaissance version were built. The latter had three F24 cameras ﬁtted in place of its port inner cannon, one facing forward and two pointing straight down. Unfortunately, the Typhoon’s characteristic strong vibrations often meant that the resulting photographs were too blurryy to be of anyy use. A total of 3317 Typhoons were built, nearly all of them by Gloster. Twentyﬁve were lost to structural failure with the death of 23 pilots. •\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS 037 03\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nTempest Mk.V\n\n!\n\nHAWKER TEMPEST\n\nNorwegian Lieutenant Johan Bernard Gilhuus of 80 Squadron, statiioned at Volkel in Holland, ﬂew this Tempest on October 11, 1944. Gilhuus was killed in action just over two months later on December 17 when his ﬁghter was hit by ﬂak in the cockpit area. He had achieved one aerial victory ryy the year before – a Fw 190 – and d was the ﬁrst and only Norwegian to die while ﬂying a Tempest.\n\n1942-1953\n\nConceived simply as the Typhoon Mk.II, the Tempest earned itself a new name and went on to become one of the most powerful and deadly pistonengined ﬁghters ever ﬂown.\n\n038\n\nrgently needed on the front line yet beset by technical maladies and hampered by its toothick wing, the Typhoon quickly became Hawker’s problem child. Stung by the type’s embarrassing ﬂaws, the company’s design team set about devising a new version that would be superior in every respect to the Mk.I. The ﬁrst step was to improve the Typhoon’s high-speed performance by ﬁtting it with a thinner wing. This would improve airﬂow and therefore performance at higher altitudes and speeds. In addition, an elliptical shape was adopted which would allow the aircraft’s four 20mm Hispano cannon to be set further back where the extra space available would allow for 200 rounds of ammunition apiece. Drag would be further reduced\n\nU\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nby providing the aircraft with radiators set into the wing leading edges inboard d of the landing gear for the tyype’s chosen engine – the Napier Sabre IV. A four-blade ed propelle er er would help to ease the seemingly gly incurable vibrations which afﬂicted cted the Typhoon Mark I and the pilot’s ot’s visibility would be improved with th a new sliding bubble canopy. Tendering for Air Ministry Speciﬁcation F.10/41 in November 1941, Hawker was awarded a contract for two prototype Typhoon Mk.IIs. Since the Typhoon’s sibling, the e Tornado, had been cancelled a few months earlier due to the non-availability of its proposed Rolls-Royce Vulture engine, it was decided that Typhoon II prototypes ypes should be ﬁtted with a range off under-development engines. The contract was expanded\n\nordered 100 Tempest Vs and 300 Tempest Is, the latter to be built by Gloster in place of a planned batch of 300 Typhoons. The Tempest I embodied the key design features planned for the Typhoo on II – the new wings, radiators, canopy and propeller – but prob blems with the Sabre IV delayed d its development. The ﬁrst prototype to ﬂy was therefore the Tempest V, HM595, on Septem mber 2. This featured a longer fu uselage than that of the Typhoo on, 33ft 8in compared to the 31ftt 11½in of the latter, plus the ne ew wings but without\n\nthe new radiators or cockpit canopy. The tail unit was also very similar to that of the Typhoon. The undercarriage main legs were longer than those of the Typhoon with a wider track to improve stability during landing and to provide better clearance for the propeller. Fitted with trunnions, the legs were shortened as they retracted to ﬁt within their housings. The tailwheels was also retractable and fully enclosed. In November it was ﬁtted with the new cockpit design, which had a centre panel comprising a 1½in thick outer layer and a ¼in thick inner layer to make it bullet-resistant. The frame was carefully positioned to provide maximum visibility. A tail ﬁn fairing which served to almost double the ﬁn’s vertical surface area was also added\n\nTempest Mk.V\n\nSIX DIFFERENT TEMPEST PROTOTYPES WERE PLANNED WITH SIX DIFFERENT ENGINES\n\nTwo Bf 109s were shot down on Feb bruary ryy 25, 1945, by Flight Lieu utenant L C Luckhoff fff of 33 Squadron, based Gilze-Rijen, Holland, ﬂying EJ880.

Rather than being rushed into service as the Typhoon had been, early production Tempest Vs were used for extensive trials at Boscombe Down. The type was not cleared for front line service until Ap pril 8, 1944.

New aircraft came ﬁtted with a Rebecca transponder from mid-to-late 1944, which required the addition of an aerial under the port side centre section. On active service, the Tempest performed best when operating at low to medium altitude and was found to be well-suited to long-range armed reconnaissance operations thanks to its ability to carry a pair of 45-gallon drop tanks and the excellent ﬁeld of vision afforded by its bubble canopy. When German forces began launching V-1 ﬂying bombs at London during June 1944, the Tempest demonstrated its ability to both catch and destroy the ‘robot’ invaders. It was also able to remain in the air for extended periods on patrol while waiting for V-1s to appear. Beginning on September 21, 1944, Tempests were operated from forward airﬁelds on the Continent by the 2nd Tactical Air Force. Between late October and mid-Dece ember, most were withdrawn for\n\nTempest Mk V\n\n!\n\n!\n\nTempest Mk V Nicknamed the ‘Terror of the Rheine’, Squadron Leader David ‘Foob’ Fairbanks, an American who joined the RAF via Canada, was the highest scoring Tempest ace with 11 victories. Serving with 274 Squadron on February 24, 1945, he scored his ﬁnal ‘kill’: a Fw 190 over Plantlunne, Germany. Four days later, he led six Tempests into an attack on a formation of 40 Fw 190s and Bf 109s, eventually being shot down by one of the Fw 190s. He spent the rest of the war as a PoW.\n\n!\n\nWHEN THE GERMANS BEGAN LA LAUNCHING V-1 FLYING BOMBS AT BRITAIN, BRI TEMPESTS WERE USED TO CATCH CA AND SHOOT THEM DOWN\n\nBounced by Fw 190Ds on March 28, 1945, Staff Sergeant Stanley A Shepherd’s Tempest was h td d il t crashed h d near shot down.

During the ﬁnal months of the war, the Tempest achieved an estimated 6:1 success rate against enemy single-seat ﬁghters, even shooting down a number of Messerschmitt Me 262 jet ﬁghters.\n\nTEMPEST II AND VI\n\nThe quick success of the Tempest V led to an unusual situation where the Mk.V was in service long before any of the earlier marks. However, the Mk.II did eventually reach full series production. Powered by a Bristol Centaurus IV engine, the Tempest II looked nt from siigniiﬁcanttly differen both the original Typ phoon and its sibling the Tempest V. The 18-cylinder Centaurrus was radial in shape, rather tha an inline like the 24-cylinder Sabre, and air- rather than liquid-cooled. It therefore\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nfeatured d a tight cylindrical cowl with its exhau usts stacked on eith her side. Its air intakes were positioned on the leading edges of both wingss and another air intake along with h the oil cooler were installed on the inner starboard wing. The ﬁrst Tempest II prototype, LA602, had made its ﬁrst ﬂight as early as June 28, 1943, and the second ﬂew for the ﬁrst time on September 18, 1943. Severe engine vibration was experienced early on but was largely cured with the replacement of the usual rigid eight-point engine mountings with six-point rubber insulated shock k mounts. In addition, the four-bla aded propeller was brieﬂy replaced with a ﬁve-bladed unit until a rebalan nced versiion off the oriigiinall wa as adop pted d.\n\nTempest Mk.V\n\n!\n\nUNUSUALLY, THE TEMPEST MK.V ENTERED SERVICE BEFORE ANY OF THE EARLIER MARKS\n\nHaving been a ‘millionaire playboy’ on the Greek island of Chios, Basilios Michael ‘Vass’ Vassiliades joined the RAF in 1942. By March 1945 he was serving with 3 Squadron based at Volkel in the Netherlands. He scored his 10th and last victory ﬂying this aircraft on March 7, shooting down Fw 190D-9 ‘Yellow 15’. On March 25, he attacked a convoy of trucks well behind enemy lines which was protected by a concentration of ﬂak batteries. His wingman was shot down almost immediately and the two other Tempest pilots refused to continue the attack, but Vassiliades got in and out without a scratch. Having surveyed the damage caused, he went in for a second pass and was shot down and d killed.\n\nA handful of Messerschmittt Me 262 jet ﬁghters were shot down by Tempes sts and among them were two des stroyed by Wing Commander John Basil Wray, off 122 Wing, ﬂying this machine.\n\n!\n\nTempest Mk.V Wing Commander Roland P Beaumont commanded the ﬁrst Tempest wing, 150 Wing, stationed at Newchurch, England, during June 1944. This was his aircraft at the time. Four months later, he was shot down while ﬂying a Tempest near Nijmegen and became a prisoner of war until he was released by Soviet forces in May 1945.\n\nTempest Mk.V Flying this Tempest with 3 Squadron, Belgian ace Flight Lieutenant Remy Van Lierde shot down up to 44 V-1 ﬂying bombs. He ended the war with six air-to-air combat victories and died in n 1990 aged 74.\n\n! Longer than the Tempest V at 34ft 5in, the Tempest II was only slightly heavier even though the e Centaurus weighed 2695lb co ompared to the Sabre’s 2360lb. This was because the former did not require the heavy radiator unit of the latter – the overall difference amounting to just 20lb in the Tempest V’s favour. The Tempest II was also 10mph fa aster at a top speed of 442mph. The ﬁrst production Tempest II, powered by the Centaurus V, was rolled out on October 4, 1944, but the ﬁrst six off the line were e removed for further trials rather than being allocated to front line units. The type was earmarked\n\nfor the ﬁght against Japan in the Far East but the war ended before it could enter service. The last Tempest was the Mark VI, powered by the Sabre V. The original Tempest V prototype, HM595, was heavily modiﬁed to become the Tempest VI prototype, ﬁrst ﬂying in its new conﬁguration on May 9, 1944. Two more Tempest Vs, EJ841 and JN750, were also converted to Tempest VI standard in 1945 and the type enjoyed a brief production run of 142 aircraft – eventually making it the last piston-engined ﬁghter in operational service with the RAF. A total of 1702 Tempests of all types were produced. • ALLIED FIGHTERS 043\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nYak-1\n\n!\n\nYAKOVLEV This rocket-armed tail-ski Yak-1 was ﬂown by Kapitan Boris Nikolayevich Yery ryomin, y commander of the 2nd Eskadrilya, 296 IAP, stationed at Brigadirovka Airﬁeld in Izyum, USSR, during March 1942. He ﬂew 342 combat sorties and achieved eight victories in air combat plus 15 shared.\n\n1940-1950\n\nThe ﬁrst ﬁghter from the soon-to-be-famous Yakovlev aviation bureau, the Yak-1 was a landmark design that would pave the way for some of the Soviet Air Force’s best Second World War aircraft.\n\n044\n\nt the end of the 1930s the Soviet government realised that the ﬁghter aircraft equipping its air force were becoming increasingly outdated compared to the latest types being produced in Western Europe and instigated a programme of development that would redress the balance. The Soviet Union’s best and brightest young designers were handed this task and given enormous resources with which to see it through. Among them was Aleksandr Sergeyevich Yakovlev, aged 33 in 1939. He had designed his ﬁrst powered aircraft in 1927 and graduated from the Zhukovsky Air Force Military Engineering Academy in 1931. He was then assigned to Moscow Aviation Plant No. 39 and established his ﬁrst design ofﬁce there, working on\n\nA\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nlightweight aircraft, the following year. He became the head of the Yakovlev Design Bureau in 1935. When a competition was held in 1939 to produce the next standard Soviet singleseat ﬁghter, he submitted four designs based on essentially the same airframe – a basic ﬁghter (designated I-26), trainer (I-27), high-altitude ﬁghter (I-28) and heavy ﬁghter (I-30). Work on these concepts had begun in May and the basic ﬁghter design, a sleek low-wing monoplane with fully enclosed cockpit and retractable undercarriage, was approved for ﬁrst mock-up and then prototype production in October. The I-26-1 prototype was rolled out in January 1940, making its ﬁrst ﬂight on the 13th equipped with a ski undercarriage due to the icy ground conditions at that time of year. The fuselage structure\n\nwas made of welded steel tubing and the forward fuselage had skin made from duralumin. The re ear fuselage, however, had a fabric skin sup pported by wood den pllank ks. The wiings were wooden too. Although it had been hoped that a supercharged version of the Klimov M-105 engine could power it, this was unavailable so a standard M-105P had to do instead. This produced 1050hp, driving a metal variable-pitch\n\nYak-1B Sttarshiy Leytenant Pavel Pavlov, an ace who achieved 12 2 victories in air combat plus ﬁvve shared, ﬂew this aircraft while serving with 21st IAP, sttationed in the Leningrad area, USSR, during the su ummer of 1942.\n\nTHE YAK-1 WAS AMONG THE SOVIET UNION’S NEWEST FIGHTERS WHEN THE SECOND WORLD WAR BEGAN\n\nYAK-1 !\n\nYak-1 During the early stages of the Battle of Stalingrad, Starshiy Leytenant Mikhail Dmitrievich Baranov of 183 IAP became the leading Soviet ace with 24 comb bat victories.

On August 6, 1942, Baranov and two wingmen were escorting g Il-2 ground-attack aircraft when they happened upon 24 Ju 87s being escorted by four Bf 109s.

This was the day when she achieved what some regard as her ﬁrst ‘killl’ – a Ju 88. Press reports referred to Litvy vyak y as the ‘White Lily of Stalingrad d’ and she reportedly did pick ﬂowers and put bouquets in her cockpit, which h would inevitably be thrown out by the male pilots who shared the aircraft.\n\n!\n\nYak-1B This Yak-1B was ﬂown by Kapitan Nikolay Aleksandrovich Kozlov of 910 IAP, based at Borisoglebsk in the USSR during February ryy 1943.

By way of comparison its contemporary, the Supermarine Spitﬁre Mk.I, was powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin that produced 1030hp. The ‘P’ in M-105P, meant that an engine-mounted cannon could be ﬁtted, ﬁring through the centre of the propeller. For this installation, a 20mm ShVAK cannon was chosen. Four additional weapons, 7.62mm machine guns, were to be ﬁtted around the engine – two above it and two below. However, no weapons were actually added to the I-26-1 prototype. While the original design had called for a ﬁghter weighing 5070lb fully loaded, the I-26-1 actually weighed 5730lb when it was built, apparently because many of the manufacturers responsible for producing its components and equipment had given rather optimistic projections of how much their products would weigh. The I-26-1 ﬂew 26 times between January 13 and March 19, 1940. Test pilots found that it handled easily and could reach a top speed of 360mph on a good day – comparing well to the Spitﬁre I’s 367mph. Unlike the Spitﬁre, however, the I-26-1 was let down by shoddy workmanship. The engine was prone to serious oil leaks and could suffer from critical overheating just a few minutes into a ﬂight. The leading edges of its wings began to break away far short of the design’s intended maximum load and structural integrity in general was poor. The undercarriage could not be retracted if the aircraft accelerated too quickly after take-off and even when the wheels were retracted they would seldom lock in place correctly. Incredibly, series production of the I-26 was by now already under way. The ﬁrst production machine rolling off the line on March 22, 1940. At this point the second prototype, I-26-2, had not even ﬂown yet. This featured a stronger airframe but although several advanced engines were considered it was again equipped with an M-105P because none of them were ready. In addition, it was decided that the two machine guns due to be ﬁtted below the engine would have to be deleted due to the engine’s oil system being extensively modiﬁed. Loaded weight rose to 5887lb. The I-26-2 ﬁrst ﬂew the day after the ﬁrst production machine, on March 23, 1940, and during trials which lasted less than two\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS 047\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS !\n\nYak-1B\n\nYAKOVLEV YAK-1\n\n048\n\nmonths managed a top speed ph. No diving g or sp pin of 374mp trials were conducted and the armament was not tested. The I-26-1 was destroye ed in a fatal crash on April 27, 1940, when a sharp manoe euvre resulted in the undercarriage locks coming loose, the main wheels being deployed at just the wrong moment and the e pilot losing control. It had only been airborne for a total of 13 ho ours and nine minutes up to tha at point. On June 1 the I-26-2 wa as handed over to the Soviet Air Force for acceptance trialss. These determined that the aircraft offered high performance but was sttructturallly weak k and the engine continued to overheat – so rpm could not be raised too high. Most aero obatic manoeuvres were banned too for fear of structural failure e. It was also noted that th he aircraft had no communica ations equipment whatsoever, no generator and no vertical speed indicator. Its gunsight was woefully inadequate as well. By now though, a dozen production versions based on the ﬁrst prototype had already been built\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS TERS\n\nand were undergoing acceptance trials with the Soviet Air Force. The third prototype, unsurprisingly designated I-26-3, was complleted d on Septemb ber 17, 1940, and featured cockpit ventilation, more airframe strengthening, capacity for more ammunition and numerous further detail changes. Flight testing commenced immediately and it was determined that most of the earlier faults plaguing the type had been resolved – though\n\nYak-1M\n\n!\n\nRELIABILITY AND BUILD QUALITY IMPROVED AS PRODUCTION SWITCHED TO THE YAK-1B\n\nBy 1943, Serzhant Lydia Litvy vyak y was ﬂying Yak-1Bs with the 73rd GvIAP, base ed at Krasnyy yyy Luch in the USSR.

She is believed to have bee en shot down and killed, though rumours persisted for years that she had survivved a crash landing and had been held in a German prisoner of war camp. At the time of her disappearance she had achieved 12 victories plus four shared.\n\nThis aircraft was ﬂown by Starshiy Leytenant Aleksandr Alekseyevich Shokurov of the 156th IAP while stationed in Czestochowa, Poland, during the summer of 1944.

The production versions were modiﬁed on the ﬂy as the prototypes trialled different ﬁxes and new components – these continual revisions, some 300 of them between February 1 and October 1, 1940, serving to hamper the overall numbers being built. Finally, in December 1940, the I-26 was ofﬁcially designated the Yak1 in honour of its originator. By the middle of 1941, two aircraft plants were engaged in building the Yak-1, No. 303 and No. 292, each apparently working to a slightly different set of drawings – resulting in aircraft that varied in performance. The revisions kept coming, with the aircraft’s equipment and engine being continually upgraded and improved. The upgraded Yak-1B had completely replaced the Yak-1 by October 1942. This boasted an improved oil cooler, ‘bubble’ canopy for improved pilot visibility, a single 12.7mm UBS offset to port in place of the two 7.62mm machine guns and slightly more power (1180hp) from the improved M-105PF. Reliability and build quality also continued to get better as production progressed. Weight continued to be a problem, however, and by the time the last Yak-1Bs were completed in 1944 top speed was only 326mph. Overall, a total of 8667 were prod duced d wiith the lastt one beiing accepted in October 1944. •\n\nALLIED FIGH FIGHTERS HTERS 049\n\nALLIED FIGHTERS\n\nYAKOVLEV YAK-7 AND YAK-3 Yak-7B !\n\n1940-1947\n\nOriginally designed as a two-seat trainer for pilots learning to ﬂy the Yak-1, the Yak-7 was converted into a superior single-seater. The Yak3 was quite simply the ultimate Yakovlev ﬁghter of the war.\n\n050\n\nhe second design that made up Yakovlev’s entry to the 1939 Soviet ﬁghter competition was the I-27 trainer. As proposed this shared a great deal with the I-26 basic ﬁghter, so when the I-26 began to progress through the development process it made sense to bring forward the I-27 too. Detail work on it started in January 1940 and the government approved the programme two months later. Rather than retaining its original designation, the ﬁrst prototype became the UTI-26-1. It was essentially an I-26, with the same M-105P engine and propeller, but with two cockpits. Each had its own sliding canopy hood and a set of ﬂight instruments and controls. There was no intercom however, the instructor and his student could only speak to one another by means of a crude rubber tube. In order to install the second cockpit, the I-26’s wings had to be moved 100mm to the rear while the radiator went forward. Two 7.62mm ShKAS machine guns were ﬁtted with 500 rounds apiece. The prototype was ﬂown for the ﬁrst time on July 23, 1940, and tests continued until August when the undercarriage failed.
