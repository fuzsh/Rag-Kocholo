The autocratic populist fiercely criticized the United States and allied himself with Fidel Castro and other fellow leftists. The outspoken leader, who was a hero to Venezuela's poor, sought to remake Venezuela into a socialist state, but left with many citizens still facing poverty despite the country's huge oil wealth.",

        "text": "Thousands of demonstrators in northwest Pakistan are participating in a sit-in protest after authorities fired on participants of a “peace march” in the Bannu district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province on July 19.\n\nLeaders of the rally told RFE/RL’s Radio Mashaal that the Pakistani military fired on participants of the peace march, held as the region has experienced a spike in militant attacks.\n\nDoctors at the Bannu district hospital said that they had received one dead body and 27 injured people following the march.\n\nThe military has so far not commented on allegations that it was responsible for the violence.\n\nThe Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government, which has shut down mobile and Internet services in the Bannu district amid the unrest, on July 20 announced the formation of an investigative commission to look into the incident.\n\nNasir Bangash, a leader of the sit-in protest, told RFE/RL that the sit-in will continue until the government provides assurances that peace in the restive province can be restored.\n\nAmnesty International sharply criticized the authorities’ use of violence to break up the march, saying that the “use of lethal force at a peaceful rally advocating for peace is unlawful” and calling for a prompt investigation to “hold to account officials responsible for the attack.”\n\nThe rights watchdog further said that restrictions on mobile and Internet services in Bannu “curtail the people’s ability to mobilize” and also “increase the spread of misinformation during emergencies and create panic.”\n\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has also urged the government to “hold to account those responsible for protesters' deaths and injuries.”\n\n“This seemingly state-sanctioned violation of citizens' right to life and right to freedom of peaceful assembly is reprehensible and reflects a dangerous contempt for citizen-led calls for peace,” HRCP said in a statement on X on July 19.\n\nThe provincial assembly of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa denounced the violence against “peaceful protesters” in a session held late on July 19, as demonstrations spread to other cities in the province, including the regional capital, Peshawar.\n\nLeaders of Pashtun nationalist political parties have also condemned the violence used against protesters in the Bannu district.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Province has seen an increase in deadly attacks in the past two years, mostly blamed on Islamist extremist groups, including the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan and affiliates of the extremist group Islamic State.\n\nA number of deadly incidents have taken place in recent months, leading to reports that the military is considering an operation to turn the tide of rising terrorism.\n\nWhile residents of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province have complained that Islamabad is not doing enough to provide security, they have also expressed fears of a large-scale operation.\n\nPakistani security forces have recently said they have conducted targeted operations against militants in several parts of the province.\n\nOn July 15, eight Pakistani soldiers were killed when a militant rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the outer wall of a garrison in Bannu.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he spoke with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and agreed to a face-to-face meeting to discuss steps to a lasting peace with Russia.\n\nZelenskiy spoke with Trump on July 19, a day after the former U.S. president and again Republican candidate accepted his party’s nomination and vowed to end the war in Ukraine if elected.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n“I spoke with @realDonaldTrump to congratulate him on the Republican nomination and condemn the shocking assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. I wished him strength and absolute safety in the future,” Zelenskiy said in a post on X, referring to the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally that slightly injured the candidate.\n\nZelenskiy said he agreed with Trump “to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting” without giving any details on when and where such a meeting would take place.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social on July 19 that he had a “very good call” with Zelenskiy in which they discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrump vowed to “bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives” through negotiations.\n\n\"Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity,\" Trump said.\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has killed tens of thousands on both sides, is now in its 29th month with no end in sight. Russia currently occupies about 17 percent of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy’s call comes as worries grow in Kyiv and other European capitals about another four years of Trump in the White House. The Republican’s chances of winning the November 2024 election improved following 81-year-old incumbent President Joe Biden’s poor performance in a debate last month that raised questions about his physical and mental state.\n\nTrump-Putin Relationship\n\nTrump has expressed admiration for authoritarian Russian President Vladimir Putin, called the Kremlin leader’s preinvasion tactics “genius,” and has repeatedly criticized NATO’s European allies for not spending more on collective defense.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the House of Representative who are closely aligned with Trump blocked Biden's $61 billion aid package for Ukraine for months, leaving Ukraine’s force short on ammunition and air defense. Ukraine’s ammunition hunger contributed to Russian territorial gains this year, experts have said.\n\nTrump has not made his opinion on future support to Ukraine clear, though this week he picked Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, an outspoken opponent of aid to Kyiv, as his running mate. The 39-year-old senator has said the United States does not have the military capacity to support Taiwan, Israel, and Ukraine and should prioritize the first two.\n\nDuring his 92-minute-long acceptance speech on July 18, Trump said he would usher in global peace and stability if elected. He previously said he would “settle” the Ukraine war, should he win the election, before even setting foot in the White House in January 2025.\n\nHowever, Trump has not said what terms he would propose to Russia and Ukraine. Zelenskiy has said his goal is to drive Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which the Kremlin seized in 2014. Following Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive in 2023, some experts say Ukraine’s objectives are unrealistic and that Kyiv will have to make concessions.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban flew to Florida on July 11 to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine with Trump. Orban’s meeting with Trump followed visits to Moscow and Beijing.\n\nZelenskiy and Trump have a complicated relationship going back to the Ukrainian president’s first days in office.\n\nIn a July 2019 call, two months after the former comedian became Ukraine’s president, Trump asked Zelenskiy to look into the Ukrainian business dealings of Biden’s son Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump was charged by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives with using the power of his office to pressure Zelenskiy to interfere in U.S. politics in exchange for a White House visit, becoming the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. However, he was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz on July 19 said a proposed lithium-mining project in Serbia was \"an important European project\" that is also good for Serbia, despite opposition from environmental activists and opposition parties.\n\nScholz attended a Critical Raw Materials Summit in Belgrade, where a memorandum of understanding between the European Union and the Serbian government on a \"strategic partnership\" on sustainable raw materials, battery supply chains, and electric vehicles was signed.\n\nThe mining of lithium is necessary for Europe \"to remain sovereign in a changing world and not be dependent on others,\" Scholz said after the signing ceremony.\n\nGermany is seeking to secure lithium for the manufacture of electric vehicles as the EU aims to reduce its dependence on imports from China of the critical substance used in batteries for electric vehicles.\n\nScholz and European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic attended the summit in Belgrade three days after the Serbian government reinstated a plan for the lithium mine in the west of the country near Jadar operated by the Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto.\n\n\"I'm glad the decision was made,\" Scholz said, speaking at a joint news conference with Sefcovic and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic. \"I admit, this decision required courage, but it was made at the right moment.\"\n\nScholz pledged that mining would be carried out \"in compliance with the highest standards of environmental protection, and Germany will help in this.\"\n\nAsked how Germany can guarantee environmental protection, Scholz said that he asked the president of Rio Tinto to respect all environmental standards during exploitation and said that he had received guarantees for this.\n\n\"The standards for protecting the climate, the environment, and biodiversity are high. That's why I spoke very early with the head of Rio Tinto,\" Scholz said.\n\nAs the summit took place, environmental activists opposed to lithium mining gathered near the venue in central Belgrade. One banner said the EU should \"leave lithium and democracy to the Serbian people.\"\n\nThe Serbian government rejected the project in 2022 after massive environmental protests, but on July 16 it reinstated the plan days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government of then-Prime Minister Ana Brnabic had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nScholz said that among the other reasons to support the project are that it will create new jobs in Serbia and help Europe meet its climate goals.\n\nSefcovic said that it was a historic day for both Serbia and the European Union.\n\n\"This will open the door for investments in Serbia. European companies will come and create jobs and create new economic growth,\" he said.\n\nSerbia will occupy a central place in the most important strategic value chains and will be the first country in Europe with the entire value chain once batteries are produced in Serbia, Sefcovic said.\n\nAccording to him, the first goal is to strengthen the Serbian economy with high-quality jobs throughout the supply chain.\n\nHe also said the memorandum of understanding and another signed agreement will further highlight the partnership between the EU and Serbia, which is a candidate for membership in the EU.\n\nVucic said he was proud of \"what we started today,\" calling the memorandum of understanding important for Europe and Germany, but most important for Serbia. \"This represents a turning point and a big change for us.\"\n\nHe said that lithium mining represented billions of dollars in direct foreign investment and Serbia should not miss this chance.\n\nHe added that Serbia did not hide the difficulties the government is facing in its support for the mining project but insisted that it was doing everything transparently.\n\n\"Never at any stage -- and there is a long way to the opening of the mine -- will we hide anything from our people,\" he added.\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nSerbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on July 19 that police had killed the suspect in the fatal shooting of a police officer near the western border with Bosnia-Herzegovina after a massive manhunt that involved authorities in several countries.\n\nThe Serbian Interior Ministry's initial statement did not identify the dead suspect.\n\nBut officials had previously identified the man being sought for the killing of one policeman and the wounding of another as Faton Hajrizi, a recent prison escapee from Kosovo with multiple convictions, including for violent crimes.\n\n\"Police officers liquidated the killer of a policeman in the vicinity of Loznica,\" Dacic was quoted as saying in a police statement.\n\nDacic later specified to journalists that police had \"eliminated an Albanian terrorist\" in the vicinity of the village of Banja Koviljaca after he fired on police responding to a resident's report that a man who didn't speak Serbian had approached the resident asking for water.\n\n\"The police eliminated him. He had no intention of surrendering,\" Dacic said. \"This is a ruthless and hardened criminal, this is the fifth or sixth murder he has committed.\"\n\nHelicopters, drones, and at least 150 police officers had been scouring areas near the Drina River that marks the Serbian-Bosnian border, according to Serbian deputy police director Dragan Vasiljevic.\n\nSerbian police said they were working with law enforcement in the Serb-majority region of Republika Srpska, across the border in Bosnia. Vasiljevic said they had also established cooperation with central Bosnian and Croatian police, and with international institutions in Kosovo.\n\nKosovar authorities had issued a warrant for Hajrizi after his escape early this month from Smrekonica prison, a low-security facility.\n\nKosovo's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, the country's liaison office in Serbia, responded to the reports of the suspect's death by asking Serbian authorities to confirm the identity of the individual who was killed.\n\nSerbian authorities say the shooting occurred during a routine vehicle control at the Lipnicki Sor border checkpoint, near Loznica, early on July 18.\n\nThey say the suspect fired on two police officers as he got out of the vehicle, killing one and injuring the other, before fleeing the scene toward the nearby river.\n\nThe Interior Ministry had circulated a photograph of Hajrizi and appealed to citizens for help finding him.\n\nAfter initially calling it \"a clear terrorist act coming from Kosovo by Albanian structures,\" Dacic said investigators were treating the crime as a \"terrorist attack because it is an attack on officials.\"\n\nKosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti responded to reports of the killing by urging officials to avoid \"politicizing\" the tragedy.\n\nRelations remain strained between Serbia and its partially recognized former province, which Belgrade still regards as part of Serbia despite a declaration of independence by Kosovo’s predominantly ethnic Albanian authorities in Pristina in 2008.\n\nThe Kosovo Correctional Service called Smrekonica an \"open institution\" and said two officers had been suspended after Hajrizi's escape earlier this month.\n\nHajrizi's criminal convictions in Kosovo included the killing of a Russian soldier 24 years ago when Hajrizi was still in his teens.\n\nReports suggested Hajrizi had escaped from prison as many as nine times, and the prison authority was quoted earlier this month as saying he had 7 1/2 years left to serve on his current sentence.\n\nThe Serbian Interior Ministry said a Kosovar passport in the name of Artan Hajrizi, Faton Hajrizi's brother, and a German identity card were found at the crime scene.\n\nArtan Hajrizi announced in Germany on the day of the shooting that his brother had stolen his passport two days earlier.\n\nDacic suggested that the alleged document theft pointed to a premeditated attack.\n\nDeputy police chief Vasiljevic told German media that police there had been contacted via Interpol.\n\nOn July 18, Dacic reported that the alleged driver of the vehicle in which the suspected shooter was riding had been apprehended in the city of Bijeljina, in Republika Srpska in Bosnia. He was identified as Zoran Radovanovic.\n\nThe Serbian Higher Court told RFE/RL's Balkan Service that Radovanovic had skipped bail five years ago before being tried in absentia and sentenced by a Belgrade court in 2020 for leading a criminal group involved in drug smuggling.\n\nRadovanovic's wife was also arrested in Mladenovac, near Belgrade, on July 18 on suspicion of being an accomplice to a crime.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry confirmed on July 19 that a German national has been sentenced to death in Belarus and said Berlin was in intensive contact with authorities in Minsk over his fate.\n\nThe German ministry did not identify the man, but earlier on July 19 the Minsk-based Vyasna human rights group said that the man sentenced to death was Rico Krieger.\n\nVyasna said Krieger, 30, was taken into custody in November 2023, went on trial on June 6, and was sentenced on June 24 by the Minsk regional court.\n\nThe human rights group said it was the first trial in Belarus for \"mercenary activity.\"\n\nIt said Krieger had been charged additionally with terrorism, creating an extremist group, intentionally damaging a vehicle, and illegal operations with firearms and explosives.\n\nThe Belarusian authorities have not commented on the case, and the court refused to give any information about the matter to RFE/RL by telephone.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry said it and the German Embassy were giving \"the person in question consular support and...working intensively with Belarusian authorities on his behalf.\"\n\nVyasna said the charges were connected to the Kalinouski Regiment, a group of anti-government Belarusian exiles fighting for Ukraine. The Kalinouski Regiment denies any connection to the case.\n\nBelarusian authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka has supported Russia in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n\"This is the first exceptional measure of punishment for a foreigner in Belarus,\" human rights activist Leanid Sudalenka told RFE/RL, noting that the death penalty was used in a case not involving a murder.\n\nHe believes the verdict is not accidental and the Belarusian authorities are counting on using the case to bargain with Germany, noting the lack of a death penalty there.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry statement said Berlin considered the death penalty \"a cruel and inhuman form of punishment\" and that Germany rejected it in all circumstances. Belarus is the only European country that continues to use the death penalty.\n\nKrieger was born in Berlin and worked as a paramedic for the German Red Cross, according to Vyasna. He has a young son, who lives in Germany.\n\nKrieger worked previously as a special security officer for the U.S. State Department in Berlin, where he gained experience in armed security operations. He then moved to the field of health care and worked as a nurse specializing in emergency medical care.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered a historic address before Britain's cabinet on July 19, calling for its help in halting Moscow's deadly missile strikes by allowing Ukrainian forces to launch attacks deeper inside Russian territory.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nZelenskiy, the first foreign leader to address the cabinet since former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1997, said Britain had the power to convince its NATO partners, some of whom have been reluctant to allow Kyiv to use Western-provided long-range weapons to strike targets hundreds of kilometers deep inside Russia, to reverse their stance and remove the limitations.\n\n“I ask you to show your leadership,\" Zelenskiy told the British cabinet to a standing ovation at the start of the meeting at No. 10 Downing Street.\n\n\"Right now we are missing the main answer to this question and that is our long-range capability...Please convince the other partners to remove the limits. If the restrictions on using Western weapons against Russian military are lifted, we can strike further than just near the border,\" he said, adding that once we can strike further...including Russian military airfields, we will not only protect ourselves from any Russian offensives but also secure our frontline positions and cities from Russian bombs.\"\n\nBritain has been one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters since the start of Russia's unprovoked invasion in February 2022, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who led his Labour Party to a landslide election victory earlier this month, was quick to reaffirm Britain's commitment to Kyiv despite the change of government.\n\nZelenskiy and Starmer met separately ahead of the cabinet meeting, and the Ukrainian leader thanked Britain for its sustained support.\n\n“Ukraine is, and always will be, at the heart of this government’s agenda, and so it is only fitting that President Zelenskiy will make a historic address to my Cabinet,” Starmer said in a statement before the meeting.\n\n“Russia’s incremental gains on the battlefield are nothing compared with the collective international support for Ukraine, or the strength of ties between our people.”\n\nRussian forces over the past several months have made small advances in the east of Ukraine against exhausted Ukrainian forces who have lacked sufficient manpower and ammunition. At the same time, Moscow has also frequently targeted critical Ukrainian energy infrastructure and caused deaths and damage in cities.\n\nSeparately, Zelenskiy said on July 19 that Poland had made a decision that would speed up the delivery of F-16 warplanes to Ukraine.\n\n\"Today, we have a positive decision from the Polish government on a specific issue, which will allow Ukraine to receive F-16 jets sooner. I am grateful to Prime Minister Tusk for efficiently following up on our previous agreements. I am grateful to Poland for its strong support for Ukraine,\" Zelenskiy wrote on X, without giving details.\n\nEarlier on July 19, Russian shelling from across the Dnieper River killed an elderly woman in the settlement of Bilozerka, in Ukraine's Kherson region, regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram.\n\nA Russian strike on the town of Chuhuyiv in the northeastern Kharkiv region wounded at least seven people, regional head Oleh Synyehubov reported, while in the Sumy region close to the border with Russia, at least one civilian was wounded by Russian shelling, according to regional officials.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said that its air defense systems had downed 19 Ukrainian drones over the Kursk and Belgorod regions, as well as occupied Crimea.\n\nViktor Orban said on July 19 that Ursula von der Leyen -- who was reelected on July 18 for a second term as European Commission president and has been a constant critic of the Hungarian prime minister's close relationship with Moscow and his rule-of-law backsliding -- is just an \"employee,\" not an adversary.\n\nOrban, whose country took over the EU's six-month rotating presidency on July 1, has been a constant opponent of European support for embattled Ukraine and sanctions against Moscow.\n\nEarlier this month he went on a self-styled \"peace mission\" to Moscow and Beijing that attracted the ire of the commission's chief and the leaders of the bloc's other member countries. He then met with former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican Party's candidate in the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November.\n\n\"Von der Leyen is not our political opponent, she is our employee, and yours too,\" Orban said during his regular Friday morning \"interview\" with Hungarian state radio on July 19.\n\n\"Von der Leyen's task is to implement the line outlined by the prime ministers. Since she receives her salary from member states, she is in a relationship of dependence,\" Orban said.\n\nOrban's remarks came after von der Leyen, in her speech in the European Parliament ahead of the vote that reconfirmed her as commission chief, called Orban's trips an \"appeasement mission.\"\n\nOrban also urged the other EU heads of state and government to be more effective in holding von der Leyen \"accountable,\" saying her performance had been \"very poor.\"\n\nDuring her first five-year term, von der Leyen, a former German defense minister, steered the EU through several crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and has been a main proponent of a Green Deal aiming to make the EU climate-neutral by 2050.\n\nUnder Orban, the leader of the right-wing populist Fidesz party who has been in power since 2010, Hungary has been accused of eroding the rule of law and democratic rights amid reports of growing corruption and cronyism. Billions of euros in EU funds earmarked for Hungary have been blocked over the bloc's concerns.\n\nOrban told Hungarian state radio on July 19 that he would continue his \"peace mission\" and said that a Trump victory in the U.S. presidential election in the United States would bring \"peace\" to global politics.\n\n\"Trump is clear about what he is going to do. Why do we want to be left behind? This will also change the Europeans' situation. The essence of politics is to know where the epicenter of events will be,\" Orban said.\n\nOrban's remarks come after he sent a letter to EU leaders on July 16 saying that while the United States is \"at the moment heavily preoccupied with the presidential campaign,\" Trump is ready to act \"immediately\" as a peace broker if he gets reelected.\n\nA court in Russia has found Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich guilty of espionage charges that he, his employer, and the U.S. government have rejected as politically motivated, and sentenced him to 16 years in prison.\n\nAfter hearing closing arguments in the case on July 19, a day after both Gershkovich's employer and the U.S. State Department called for his immediate release, the court handed down its ruling behind closed doors, local media reported.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said Gershkovich was sentenced despite having committed no crime. A White House statement quoted Biden as saying Gershkovich was targeted by the Russian government because he is a journalist and an American, adding that Washington was \"pushing hard for Evan's release and will continue to do so.\"\n\nGershkovich's employer called it a \"disgraceful, sham conviction\" and vowed to continue to press for his release.\n\nThe conviction comes after Gershkovich spent 478 days in detention away from his family and friends and prevented from reporting, \"all for doing his job as a journalist,\" Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal Publisher Almar Latour and Editor in Chief Emma Tucker said in a statement.\n\nA UN spokesman said the sentencing raises \"serious concerns.\" Farhan Haq told reporters that journalists \"should be able to perform their essential professional functions and work in a safe environment without fear of reprisals.\"\n\nThe European Union also slammed the lenghy prison sentence, describing it as a political gambit to \"punish journalism.\"\n\nEuropean Parliament chief Roberta Metsola said Gershkovich had been the victim of a \"sham trial.\"\n\n\"The 16-year prison sentence against WSJ journalist Evan Gershkovich is the antithesis of justice,\" he said.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Russia uses its politicized legal system to punish journalism, condemned the sentence, and called for his release.\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to answer a journalist's question about the reasons for the expedited process of the court's decision, saying that he cannot comment on such a situation. He added that Gershkovich's trial is being held behind closed doors because of the \"sensitivity of the case.\"\n\nSome analysts said the move to expedite the case could be a sign that talks are heating up between Moscow and Washington on a possible prisoner exchange.\n\nWhen asked in Moscow on July 19 about the talks on a possible prisoner swap involving Gershkovich, Peskov refused to comment.\n\nThe trial, which started on June 26, was held behind closed doors in the Sverdlovsk regional court in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg after being moved forward from August 13 at the request of the defense team.\n\nGershkovich, 32, was arrested in Yekaterinburg on March 29, 2023, while he was on a reporting trip and was subsequently charged with attempting to obtain information about a factory that manufactures tanks for Russia's war in Ukraine and pass it on to the CIA. He is the first U.S. journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War.\n\nU.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel on July 18 did not comment on possible negotiations on a prisoner exchange, but said Washington was seeking the release of Gershkovich and another imprisoned U.S. citizen, former Marine Paul Whelan, as soon as possible.\n\n\"The timeline of the trial and what route that takes does not have a bearing and has no impact on the urgency that the United States has.... We want both of them home immediately and we'll continue to work in this area until they're reunited with their loved ones,\" Patel said.\n\nHe said no U.S. Embassy representative was able to attend the July 18 session due to short notice.\n\nRussia has complained about U.S. media reports on a possible swap involving Gershkovich. Speaking on July 17 at the United Nations in New York, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov again raised this reporting, blaming \"the Americans\" for publicly bringing up a possible exchange, which he said \"isn't helping.\"\n\nLavrov told a news conference that confidential negotiations were still \"ongoing.\" Russia has previously signaled the possibility of a swap, but it says a verdict would have to come first.\n\nGershkovich and Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence also on espionage charges, have been designated by the U.S. government as \"wrongfully detained.\"\n\nSuch a designation ensures that the case is assigned to the office of the special envoy for hostage affairs in the U.S. State Department, raising the political profile of their situation and allowing the U.S. administration to allocate more resources to securing the prisoner's release.\n\nGershkovich is one of two American reporters currently being held by Russian authorities. The other is Alsu Kurmasheva, a veteran RFE/RL journalist who holds dual U.S.-Russian citizenship.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:58 0:00\n\nKurmasheva, 47, was arrested in Kazan in October and charged with failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. She’s also been charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nRFE/RL and the U.S. government say the charges are reprisals for her work as a journalist for the broadcaster in Prague.\n\nUnlike Gershkovich and Whelan, Kurmasheva has not been designated as \" wrongfully detained,\" despite repeated calls by her employer and family for this to happen.\n\nAnother U.S.-Russian citizen, Ksenia Karelina, went on trial in Yekaterinburg in June on a treason charge.\n\nKarelina, 33, was arrested in February during a visit to her native Yekaterinburg after security officers accused her of raising funds for Razom for Ukraine, a foundation that helps Ukrainian civilians affected by the war.\n\nDonald Trump vowed to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and free U.S. \"hostages\" as he accepted the presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention just days after an attempt on his life.\n\nThe 78-year-old Trump, wearing a bandage on his right ear injured in what the FBI says was an assassination attempt on the former president, also promised to revive a Cold War-era missile defense plan as he warned that the world was “teetering” on the brink of a third world war.\n\n“War is now raging in Europe and the Middle East. This administration can’t come close to solving the problems,” Trump said in a 92-minute speech that closed out the four-day convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a key swing state in the November 5 election.\n\nTrump blamed the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan under President Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent in the 2024, for emboldening Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine.\n\nHans Noel, a political scientist at Georgetown University's Department of Government, told RFE/RL that Trump’s speech brought “nothing new” on his foreign policy outlook, with his view on supporting Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion diametrically opposed to that of the Democrats.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:34 0:00\n\n“I think the thing that came through the most is just the different framing of the war in Ukraine,” Noel said. “It's not framed as Russia invaded Ukraine and Ukraine would like our help to defend itself, but rather that Ukraine and Russia got themselves into a war and maybe we don't want to get involved ourselves.”\n\nNuclear Submarines\n\nTrump painted his four years in office as one of relative international peace and stability with rivals Russia and China at bay.\n\nThe Republican nominee boasted that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban even said that Russia and China were “afraid of him.” Orban flew to Florida to meet Trump on July 11 to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine following visits to Moscow and Beijing.\n\nTrump said he would also free U.S. “hostages” without giving any details as to who and how.\n\nThe comments appeared to be a reference to the dozens of Americans detained abroad on trumped-up charges, several of whom are in Russia, including Alsu Kurmasheva, a veteran RFE/RL journalist who holds dual U.S.-Russian citizenship. The charges against Kurmasheva are reprisals for her work as a journalist , the broadcaster said.\n\nThe Biden administration has freed many Americans held abroad over the past three years through prisoner swaps and other means.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:53 0:00\n\nTrump said that, if elected, he would revive former President Ronald Reagan’s plans to develop a space-based missile-defense system to protect the United States from long-range nuclear missiles. China and Russia have been developing their long-range conventional and nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump claimed that technological advances made the project feasible. The United States abandoned the plan, nicknamed \"Star Wars\" by Reagan’s opponents, in the 1990s as the Cold War ended and relations with Moscow improved.\n\nTrump’s nomination caps a remarkable political comeback for the former president, who was impeached twice while in office, convicted earlier this year of falsifying business records, and faces charges in three other cases, including conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. One of the cases involving Trump's handling of classified documents was recently dismissed but prosecutors have appealed.\n\nTrump’s rebound from the assassination attempt comes as Biden, knocked off the campaign trail by COVID-19, faces rising calls from his own party to withdraw from the race.\n\nTrump mentioned Biden only once in his speech amid news reports that the president could drop out of the race as early as this weekend. Instead, he focused his criticism on the \"administration,\" which includes Vice President Kamala Harris, who many say could replace Biden atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nBiden beat Trump in 2020, but there is growing fear in the Democratic party that the president cannot repeat that feat after his poor performance in a June 27 debate.\n\nThe 81-year-old Biden looked frail and confused and was incoherent at times during the debate against Trump, intensifying concerns about his physical and mental ability to serve another four years. In the weeks following the debate, Biden has rejected calls to leave the race, saying he can recover from the debate debacle and beat Trump.\n\nHowever, leading Democrats have only stepped up their pressure. On the eve of Trump’s speech, Representative Adam Schiff (Democrat-California) called on the president to step aside, the most prominent lawmaker to publicly voice for change to the party ticket. Other powerful party members have this month privately urged Biden to leave the race, according to Axios.\n\nThe Democrats will hold their convention in Chicago on August 19-22.\n\nThe July 13 assassination attempt played a prominent role at the convention as Republicans leverage it to portray Trump as a “fighter” who was saved by “divine intervention.”\n\nTrump began his speech by recounting the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was speaking to supporters at a rally when the assassination attempt took place.\n\n“I am not supposed to be here tonight,” he said as the now iconic images of a blood-stained Trump standing with his fist raised in the air and surrounded by a Secret Service detail flashed on the convention screens.\n\nTrump, who opponents say expanded the boundaries of acceptable presidential discourse with consistent lies and derogatory labels for opponents, then segued into a call to lower the temperature of domestic political discussion.\n\n“We must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement, which is what's been happening in our country lately at a level that nobody has ever seen before,” he said.\n\nHe then presented himself as the biggest victim of the divisive political discourse, accusing the Democratic party of “weaponizing the justice system” to go after him and his family.\n\nTrump spent considerable time during his speech discussing the domestic policies he would implement if elected.\n\nHe promised to curtail immigration, end electric vehicle mandates, increase U.S. oil and gas production, and cut taxes."
