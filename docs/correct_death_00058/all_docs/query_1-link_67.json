        "text": "Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s fiery president and the most prominent leftist leader in South America, died Tuesday after a two-year battle with cancer.\n\nThe 58-year-old, who rose through his country’s military ranks and led a failed coup before winning the presidency, died at 4:25 p.m. local time, Vice President Nicolás Maduro said in an address.\n\n\"Much strength, much prayer and this difficulty in life must be carried with the greatest of loves that Hugo Chávez Frías planted in our heart,\" Maduro said on state television after imploring Venezuelans to avoid violence and hate in the wake of the polarizing leader's death.\n\nFor more on the death of Hugo Chávez, visit NBCNews.com.\n\nMaduro will assume the interim presidency and will also be the government candidate when elections are called 30 days from now, the country's foreign minister said Tuesday night.\n\nA seven-day period of mourning will begin Tuesday, the government announced just after the president's passing, and his official state funeral ceremony will take place Friday morning.\n\nTop government officials from the defense minister to the central bank chief paid tribute to Chávez on Tuesday night and urged national unity.\n\nU.S. & World\n\nStories that affect your life across the U.S. and around the world.\n\n\"This is a difficult moment, but we need to continue on,\" central bank chief Nelson Merentes said in an interview. \"There were people who were against him, but this is not a moment to concentrate on that. It's one to come together.\"\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Elías Jaua said Tuesday night that Chávez's remains would be moved to the Military Academy of Venezuela in Caracas on Wednesday, and funeral services would begin Thursday, with the official ceremony set for 10 a.m. local time (9:30 a.m. ET) Friday.\n\nChávez died following a battle with cancer that brought him to Cuba repeatedly and forced the postponement of his inauguration for his fourth term.\n\nHe traveled to Cuba most recently in December after abruptly announcing that he needed emergency surgery for his cancer, which had returned. He underwent a six-hour surgery on Dec. 11, his fourth operation for cancer, and also underwent chemotherapy.\n\nThe details of his illness, first treated in June 2011, had been closely guarded secrets, though Venezuela’s information ministry did reveal Monday that Chávez was facing a \"severe\" new infection and trouble breathing.\n\nBefore heading to Cuba, Chávez designated Maduro as his preferred successor if he were no longer able to lead. Under the country's constitution, elections should take place within 30 days of a president's death. In the meantime, the vice president assumes power.\n\nChávez was set to be sworn in for his fourth term on Jan. 10, but in a last-minute move, and amid growing confusion over the leadership of the country, the Supreme Court ruled that Chávez could be officially inaugurated at a later date, with the expectation that his health might improve.\n\nDuring his 14 years in office, Chávez transformed Venezuelan society through a leftist brand of governing that poured money into social welfare programs and offered free medical care and education to the poor, while broadly nationalizing everything from ranches to the country’s largest telecommunications company.\n\nHe famously argued once for the seizure of golf courses, too, to free up land for housing, deriding the sport as a bourgeois pastime on his weekly television program. \"I respect all sports,\" he said. \"But there are sports, and there are sports.\"\n\nFor many of the nation’s poor, he was a hero, and it was their support that won him reelection three times by convincing margins, even as the nation’s crime rate soared, inflation lingered above 20 percent and electricity shortages forced regular rolling blackouts.\n\nThe country’s upper class, professionals and pro-business groups vehemently opposed him, as did press freedom advocates who protested his shuttering of many news outlets and support for laws that would punish \"media crimes.\"\n\nHis ex-wife, Marisabel Rodriguez, even campaigned against his move to eliminate presidential term limits — a battle he ultimately won in a 2009 referendum. She told The Associated Press that her intentions weren’t personal. \"This struggle is against the danger posed by leaving a person in power for a long time,\" she said.\n\nChávez’s opponents did manage to topple him in a 2002 coup, though his supporters restored him to the presidency a mere 47 hours later — a shocking turn of events that burnished his legend."
