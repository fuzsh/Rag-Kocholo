        "text": "In any analysis of Venezuelan politics, it is prudent not to underestimate the vast shadow that former President Hugo Chavez casts over his country, writes Thom Walker.\n\nWith almost 28,000 murders in 2013, Venezuela is now considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world, despite government attempts to crack down on crime.\n\nVenezuelans are used to shortages of food staples and medicines. Now they are desperately scouring supermarket shelves for another of life’s essentials.\n\nVenezuela’s presidency will be decided in an election to take place on 14 April, officials say, as opinion polls heavily favour Hugo Chavez’s anointed successor Nicolas Maduro.\n\nWhile Caracas mourns the passing of Hugo Chavez, Venezuelans in South Florida have been celebrating the death of the man who they claim forced them to leave their homeland.\n\nAt least two dozen heads of state are attending Hugo Chavez’s funeral during an outpouring of grief for the charismatic but divisive Venezuelan leader.\n\nHundreds of thousands of grieving Venezuelans queue in the streets of Caracas to file past the open coffin of the country’s former president, Hugo Chavez. Washington Correspondent Matt Frei reports.\n\nHugo Chavez was in power in Venezuela for nearly 14 years – and was one of the most visible and controversial leaders from day one. But how did his country change in the years since he took power?\n\nThe Venezuelan president was a polarising figure – someone who could bait George W Bush on TV while championing the poor and presiding over a unique social experiment in the country he led.\n\nGeorge Galloway, who knew Hugo Chavez well and spent two weeks working on his campaign in Venezuela last year, says the leader stood for the kind of things Labour used to stand for.\n\nHugo Chavez rekindled the dreams of the Latin American left. Watch Jonathan Rugman’s obituary of a man who referred to George W Bush as a donkey and the devil.\n\nThe streets of the Venezuelan capital Caracas becomes a sea of humanity as tens of thousands come to join in scenes of public grief at the passing of their former leader, Hugo Chavez."
