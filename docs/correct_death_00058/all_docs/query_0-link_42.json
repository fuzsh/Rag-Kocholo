        "text": "Venezuela almost always wins Miss Universe and California dominates Miss USA, so a Venezuelan-Californian is virtually unbeatable.\n\n'Oh!' Connie imitated the breathless Miss Bentley, 'your Ladyship, if ever I should dare to presume!'\n\nCordero applied to re-establish his Venezuelan citizenship, and we were more than happy to oblige.\n\nIt resembles the analogous card that has been in place in the Venezuelan biometric passports since 2007.\n\nThey can be found in Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela.\n\nYes, well, let me present the feminine star of this spectacle, Hell's Angels Miss Jean Harlow.\n\nIt is found in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.\n\nCuban and Venezuelan involvement in political parties in Mexico or Brazil, for example, is undisputable, but not necessarily very relevant.\n\nWhen Russia recently signed a deal to supply Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez with nuclear reactors, the silence from Washington was deafening.\n\nVenezuela President Hugo Chavez was one of the most followed Venezuelan accounts on Twitter.\n\nPissarro then chose to leave his family and job and live in Venezuela, where he and Melbye spent the next two years working as artists in Caracas and La Guaira.\n\nBlanco graduated with a degree in Literature from the Universidad Central de Venezuela.\n\nIn many cases, these gamers made more money than salaried workers in Venezuela even though they were earning just a few dollars per day."
