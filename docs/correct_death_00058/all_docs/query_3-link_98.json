        "text": "From 'Morning Edition': Juan Forero speaks with Renee Montagne\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro \"controls the purse strings\" and his opponents have been looking weak, NPR's Juan Forero said earlier today on Morning Edition.\n\nSo despite Tuesday's death of the controversial and charismatic President Hugo Chávez, it's likely there will be at least \"six more years of what Chavez has called a revolution,\" Juan said, after Venezuelans go to the polls. That vote could come within the next 30 days — if the Latin American nation's leaders in what's been called an \"authoritarian democracy\" follow the rules set down in the country's constitution.\n\nThere are, of course, morning-after stories about the death of Chávez, what it means and reaction to it, on many websites. Here's a sampling of headlines and links:\n\n-- \" 'Weston-zuela' Welcomes News Hugo Chavez Is Dead.\" (WLRN)\n\n-- \"Chavez Death: Venezuelans In U.S. Hopeful Of Change.\" (The Wall Street Journal)\n\n-- \"Venezuela's Hugo Chávez And His Legacy Of Plunder.\" (The Miami Herald)\n\n-- Death Leaves Behind \"Sharp Divisions.\" (The New York Times)\n\n-- \"Death Will Have Ramifications For Cuba.\" (Morning Edition)\n\n-- \"Venezuelan Team's Request For A Moment Of Silence For Hugo Chavez Turned Down.\" (WLRN)\n\n-- \"Hugo Chavez: Notable Quotes From The Venezuelan Leader.\" (Toronto Star)\n\nOur friends at WLRN will continue to follow the news."
