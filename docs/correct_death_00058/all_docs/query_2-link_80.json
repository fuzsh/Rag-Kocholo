        "text": "MARGARET WARNER:\n\nThousands of mourners lined the streets of Caracas today, as a military honor guard moved President Hugo Chavez's body from the hospital where he died to the capital's military academy. There, he will lie in state.\n\nHuge crowds, led by Vice President Nicolas Maduro, joined in the emotional procession. Some shouted anti-American slogans. Many vowed to uphold Chavez's socialist ideals.\n\nMARGARET WARNER:\n\nChavez was one of six sons born to impoverished parents in 1954 in a cattle-ranching region in western Venezuela. He was raised by his grandmother, joined the army at just 16, and eventually became a paratrooper, with the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nIn 1992, he led a coup attempt against then-President Carlos Andres Perez and a government riddled with corruption and social divisions. The coup failed, but the move catapulted Chavez to national prominence. He was jailed, but pardoned two years later, and, in 1998, he ran for president and won, pledging to usher in social and economic equality in a new constitution.\n\nPRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ, Venezuela:\n\nI swear in front of my people on this moribund constitution that I will comply and boost the democratic transformations necessary, so that the new republic will have a Magna Carta adequate to the new times. I swear it.\n\nMARGARET WARNER:\n\nVenezuela is the world's second largest oil- producer, and Chavez nationalized the oil industry and used the revenue to build a welfare state. He subsidized food and built housing and medical clinics often staffed by Cuban doctors.\n\nThe U.S. is the world's top consumer of Venezuelan oil, but Washington bristled at Chavez's embrace of Cuba's Fidel Castro and his advocacy of leftist revolution in Latin America.\n\nIn 2002, Chavez was briefly deposed in a failed coup, and accused the U.S. of playing a role. And as the years went by, he delighted in flamboyant verbal assaults on American leaders. He took the podium at the U.N. General Assembly in 2006 with choice words about then-President George W. Bush.\n\nHUGO CHAVEZ:\n\nYesterday, the devil was here, right here.\n\nIt smells of sulfur, this podium where from where I'm speaking. Yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, from this same place, the president of the United States, who I call the devil, came here speaking as the owner of the world.\n\nHUGO CHAVEZ:\n\nIf I were American, I would vote for Obama. And I think if Obama was from here, or if he was some neighborhood in Caracas, he would vote for Chavez. I am sure of it.\n\nMARGARET WARNER:\n\nIn a statement last night, Mr. Obama signaled hopes for a more constructive, less volatile relationship with Venezuela, saying: \"As Venezuela begins a new chapter in its history, the United States remains committed to policies that promote democratic principles, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.\"\n\nChavez's long and ultimately losing battle with cancer is thought to begun in 2011. He made multiple trips to Cuba for treatment. But last July, he proclaimed himself cancer-free, and won another six-year term in the October election.\n\nIn November came word that the cancer had returned, and Chavez went back to Havana for more treatment. Before leaving, he named Vice President Nicolas Maduro his handpicked successor.\n\nHUGO CHAVEZ:\n\nIf something were to occur that would render me unfit in some way, in that situation, Nicolas Maduro shouldn't just complete, as the constitution requires, the term, but my firm opinion, you elect Nicolas Maduro as the president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\nMARGARET WARNER:\n\nHis illness kept Chavez from returning to Venezuela for his Jan. 10th inauguration. But over the objections of opposition leaders, the Venezuelan Supreme Court declared the inauguration could be postponed. Chavez made his final homecoming in February, but wasn't seen in public.\n\nHe remained in a military hospital until his death yesterday at 58. Now Venezuela must hold a new presidential election in the weeks ahead. It would likely pit Vice President Maduro â€¦"
