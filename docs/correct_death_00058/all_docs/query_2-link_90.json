        "text": "A supporter of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez cries as she holds a sign that reads in Spanish \"I am Chavez\" as Chavistas gather in Bolivar square to mourn Chavez's death in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, March 5, 2013. Venezuela's Vice President Nicolas Maduro announced that Chavez died on Tuesday at age 58 after a nearly two-year bout with cancer. During more than 14 years in office, Chavez routinely challenged the status quo at home and internationally. He polarized Venezuelans with his confrontational and domineering style, yet was also a masterful communicator and strategist who tapped into Venezuelan nationalism to win broad support, particularly among the poor.\n\nPhoto Credit : AP\n\nIn this September 21, 2006, file photo, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, right, and U.S. actor Danny Glover wave to a crowd gathered at the Mount Olive Baptist Church in the Harlem neighborhood of New York. Chavez, 58, was first diagnosed with cancer in June 2011.\n\nPhoto Credit : AP\n\nIn this January 23, 2005 photo, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez holds up a U.S. dollar bill and challenges U.S. President George W. Bush to bet which of them will remain in power longer at a rally in Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nPhoto Credit : AP\n\nIn this December 7, 2000 file photo, Venezuela's President Hugo Chaves holds up a Venezuelan army rifle during a nationally televised press conference in Caracas, Venezuela. Chavez denounced the foreign press for initiating what he says is an alleged campaign to smear him by linking him to Colombia's violent leftist rebel movement and he denied reports that Venezuela is supporting subversive movements in other Andean nations. To prove his point, Chavez produced this rifle, saying that Colombian authorities claim a rifle with the same serial number is in the hands of Colombian rebels.\n\nPhoto Credit : AP\n\nA supporter of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez cries as she learns that Chavez has died through an announcement by the vice president in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, March 5, 2013.\n\nPhoto Credit : AP"
