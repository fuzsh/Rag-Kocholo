        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nBefore his death from cancer this week, Hugo Chavez had been President of Venezuela since 1999.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn that time he became a divisive figure, making serious economic reforms in the country, seizing private property, and clamping down on criticism. Critics say that the Venezuela he created is simply not sustainable.\n\nEven so, he had millions of supporters. Last year, while seriously ill from cancer, he was able to come back and win an election by a margin of 10 points, down from 25 percent in 2006.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nOne approval rating from last year gave him a 64 percent positive rating — 15 points higher than Obama received in the same poll.\n\nWe've selected some images that will give you a glimpse into Chavez's Venezuela — a Venezuela that could be about to change for good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVenezuela's quality of life improved at the third-fastest pace worldwide during his time as leader.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nHe helped cut the country's poverty rate to 29.5 percent in 2011 from 48.6 percent in 2002, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVenezuela moved seven spots to 73 out of 187 countries in the UN's index of human development from 2006 to 2011.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nOn average, Venezuelans rated their life satisfaction 7.5 on a scale from 1-10, above the global average of 5.5, in a 2012 index of global prosperity compiled by a London-based research organization.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVenezuela has the lowest income inequality of all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a report by UN-HABITAT.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nThis was at least partly due to Chavez's plan of \"re-nationalizing\" Venezuela's vast oil reserves.\n\nCorrection: The original article failed to note that Venezuela's oil industry was initally nationalized in 1973, and that the Chavez government's 2001 Hydrocarbons law only built on this further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe country had so much oil they even sold some to low income households in the US at a 40% discount.\n\nThe profits from oil allowed Chavez to spend big on social programs such as \"Socialist Cities\" — new developments designed to stem the country's housing shortfall.\n\nSource: Global Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChavez's \"21st century socialism\" saw many jobs created through co-ops and co-managed \"social production\" companies.\n\nPoor neighborhoods could survive on food from government-subsidized grocery stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government even sent soldiers into slums to paint the neighborhoods bright, cheerful colors.\n\nAnd his government quite literally let the homeless into their homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChavez also used the money to put the country on the world stage.\n\nPerhaps more than anything, his supporters responded to his strong personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe big question now is whether Chavez's anointed heir, Nicolás Maduro, can keep Chavez's Venezuela together.\n\nMore from South America...\n\nThe Completely Outrageous Cost Of Living In Brazil >\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
