        "text": "Socialist for the Twenty-first Century\n\nby Mike Gonzalez\n\nSeries: Revolutionary Lives\n\nThe first biography published after Chavez's death, tracing his life from a poor rural family to the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas.\n\nOverview\n\nAuthor Biography\n\nEndorsements\n\nContents\n\nDetails\n\nWhen Hugo Chavez, then President of Venezuela, died in 2013, millions across the globe mourned. In an age where most politicians inspire only apathy and cynicism, Chavez's popularity, radicalism and vibrant personality were truly unique.\n\nReleased one year after Chavez's unexpected death, this dramatic and intimate biography traces Chavez's life from an impoverished rural family to the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas. Mike Gonzalez shows how Chavez's 'Bolivarian revolution' aimed to complete Simon Bolivar's promise of a Latin America free from imperialism.\n\nGonzalez details Chavez's close connection to the masses and how he enraged wealthy elites by declaring his support for 21st century socialism. He concludes that the struggle for social justice inspired by Chavez can and must continue. This is an ideal guide to Chavez's inspiring life and legacy.\n\nMike Gonzalez is Emeritus Professor of Latin American Studies at the University of Glasgow. He is the author of The Ebb of the Pink Tide (Pluto, 2018) The Last Drop: The Politics of Water (Pluto, 2015) and Hugo Chavez: Socialist for the Twenty-first Century (Pluto, 2014). He is co-editor of Arms and the People (Pluto, 2012).\n\n'A seminal work on the ideological and political formation of the former Venezuelan President and leading figure of twenty-first century socialism' - Francesco Di Bernardo, LSE Review of Books 'For activists and scholars alike, this is an excellent biography, which mirrors in its nuances and subtleties the complexity of the Bolivarian process and the figure of Chavez himself' - Jeffery R. Webber, Queen Mary University of London, author of Red October: Left-Indigenous Struggles in Modern Bolivia 'Mike Gonzalez possesses a extraordinarily rich knowledge of the Latin American left, has engaged critically with the politics of modern military institutions, and has an abiding interest in independently-minded public figures. He has brought these singular attributes together in this lucid portrait of Hugo Chavez' - Professor James Dunkerley, Queen Mary University\n\nList of Illustrations\n\nGlossary\n\nTimeline\n\nIntroduction: A Man for Difficult Times\n\n1.
