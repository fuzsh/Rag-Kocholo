        "text": "We've wrapped up our live blog – you can read our continuing coverage here of Hugo Chávez's life, death and legacy.\n\nShare\n\nHenrique Capriles, who lost to Chavez in last October's election and is the man most likely to run against the deceased president's anointed heir, Nicolas Maduro, has issued this statement:\n\nPresident Chavez and I were adversaries but never enemies. This is a message filled with respect for all Venezuelans- civilians and military, from all places, with no discrimination. (...)\n\nTo Chavez's family, to Chavez's companions: We had disagreements that are well known, but this is not the moment to highlight what separates us.\n\nIn times of anguish families and countries alike come together.\n\nThe President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, who fought alongside Chavez during the 1998 failed coup that launched him to stardom and ultimately political power, has also been talking about his comrade.\n\nThe Guardian's Virginia Lopez reports that he Cabello said Chavez was able to surmount every obstacle set in his path, adding \"all, but the one that no person can surpass\".\n\nSpeaking from the Military Hospital, and surrounded by other members of the legislative body, he asked Venezuelans to \"be like Chavez, exceptional, a companion in battle, never giving space to intrigues\".\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nDilma Rousseff, who is Brazil's president (as well as being a cancer survivor and a former left-wing guerilla) has told reporters:\n\nToday a great Latin American died. ... On many occasions, the Brazilian government did not fully agree with President Hugo Chavez but today, as always, we recognize in him a great leader, an irreparable loss and, above all, a friend of Brazil.\n\nShare\n\nThe debate about how the Left outside of Venezuela should look on Chavez's legacy continues to ramp up.\n\nBilly Bragg, the British singer and veteran left-wing activist, has said on Twitter that he was sorry to hear about the death of Hugo Chavez, the \"democratic socialist President of Venezuela\", but later added:\n\nShare\n\nThe NGO, Human Rights Watch, has released a lengthy statement criticising the \"authoritarian\" legacy of Hugo Chavez.\n\nIt says:\n\nHugo Chávez’s presidency (1999-2013) was characterized by a dramatic concentration of power and open disregard for basic human rights guarantees.\n\nIt added:\n\nBy his second full term in office, the concentration of power and erosion of human rights protections had given the government free rein to intimidate, censor, and prosecute Venezuelans who criticized the president or thwarted his political agenda.\n\nIn recent years, the president and his followers used these powers in a wide range of prominent cases, whose damaging impact was felt by entire sectors of Venezuelan society.\n\nIn 2008, President Chavez expelled HRW director, José Miguel Vivanco,\n\nafter he issued a report criticising the country's human rights\n\nrecord.\n\nFor the record, Human Rights Watch itself has come under fire over its reporting on Venezuela.\n\nIn 2008, more than 100 academics and others criticized the organization's report on Venezuela, A Decade Under Chavez: Political Intolerance and Lost Opportunities for Advancing Human Rights in Venezuela.\n\nShare\n\nVenezuela's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Elias Jaua, has just announced Chavez's funeral will be held this Friday, beginning at 10am.\n\nSeven days of national mourning have also been declared.\n\nIt is still unclear where he will be buried, according to the Guardian's Virginia Lopez in Caracas.\n\nShare\n\nThe mourning in Venezuela meanwhile continues. Here are more images from Caracas.\n\nShare\n\nVenezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, has said all its installations were operating normally and domestic fuel supplies were guaranteed.\n\nIt has released a statement saying:\n\nThe call for calm is aimed at clearing the climate of rumors and political destabilization that enemies of the fatherland are trying to sow in the public opinion.\n\nFor the record, Venezuela is the world's 11th largest crude exporter, while oil sales will continue to contribute more than 95 percent of its hard currency earnings.\n\nShare\n\nStatements from other governments are also coming in. Britain's Foreign Secretary, William Hague, said:\n\nI was saddened to learn of the death of President Hugo Chavez today.\n\nAs President of Venezuela for 14 years he has left a lasting impression on the country and more widely. I would like to offer my condolences to his family and to the Venezuelan people at this time.\n\nShare\n\nFormer US president Jimmy Carter has released a lengthy statement on Chavez's passing. Over years of observing Venezuelan elections, Carter says, \"We came to know a man who expressed a vision to bring profound changes to his country to benefit especially those people who had felt neglected and marginalized\":\n\nAlthough we have not agreed with all of the methods followed by his government, we have never doubted Hugo Chávez's commitment to improving the lives of millions of his fellow countrymen.\n\nPresident Chávez will be remembered for his bold assertion of autonomy and independence for Latin American governments and for his formidable communication skills and personal connection with supporters in his country and abroad to whom he gave hope and empowerment. During his 14-year tenure, Chávez joined other leaders in Latin America and the Caribbean to create new forms of integration. Venezuelan poverty rates were cut in half, and millions received identification documents for the first time allowing them to participate more effectively in their country's economic and political life.\n\nAt the same time, we recognize the divisions created in the drive towards change in Venezuela and the need for national healing. We hope that as Venezuelans mourn the passing of President Chávez and recall his positive legacies — especially the gains made for the poor and vulnerable — the political leaders will move the country forward by building a new consensus that ensures equal opportunities for all Venezuelans to participate in every aspect of national life.\n\nShare\n\nBolivian president Evo Morales, Chavez's close friend and ally, delivers a tearful statement on television, Virginia Lopez reports:\n\nBolivian President Evo Morales extended his condolecences to the Chavez family and to the Venezuelan people, in an appearance with members of his cabinet.\n\nFighting back tears, Morales said they felt \"destroyed\" by the news of the passing of his revolutionary counterpart.\n\n\"It hurts, but we must stand united in this process of liberation, not only of Venezuela but of the whole region...\" Morales said. \"Chavez is now more alive than ever\".\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nBritish foreign secretary William Hague has released a statement saying he is saddened to hear the news:\n\nI was saddened to learn of the death of President Hugo Chavez today. As President of Venezuela for 14 years he has left a lasting impression on the country and more widely. I would like to offer my condolences to his family and to the Venezuelan people at this time.\n\nShare\n\nChavez's often bizarre photo opportunities never failed to disappoint. Take this, taken by Kimberly White of Reuters at a rally in 2002, nominated for posterity by Blake Hounshell, managing editor of Foreign Poilcy magazine:\n\nShare\n\nThe Guardian's Simon Tisdall muses on the future of relations between the United States and Venezuela, its antagonist and crucial trading partner. A lot depends on the man in the White House:\n\nThere is much ground to make up. \"Relations between the United States and Venezuela have ranged from difficult to hostile since Chávez took office in 1999 and began to implement what he calls 21st-century socialism,\" wrote a former US ambassador to Caracas, Charles Shapiro. [...]\n\nDespite such strains, economic self-interest always prevented a complete rupture. The US remained Venezuela's most important trading partner throughout Chávez's presidency, buying nearly half its oil exports. Caracas is the fourth largest supplier of oil to the US.\n\nIn fact, the US imports more crude oil annually from Mexico and Venezuela than from the entire Persian Gulf. This shared commerce now provides a formidable incentive and a launch platform for a fresh start.\n\nWhether the opportunity is grasped depends partly on Maduro, a Chávez loyalist but a reputed pragmatist with close ties to Raúl Castro in Cuba.\n\nYet it depends even more on Obama, whose first term, after a promising start, ended up perpetuating Washington's historical neglect of Latin America. He now has a chance to do better.\n\nRead the full piece here.\n\nShare\n\nVirginia Lopez is in Caracas for the Guardian. She reports that top government officials have gathered outside the military hospital where Chavez died:\n\nThe president of the central bank, Nelson Merentes, asked the opposition to respect the coming days of nationwide mourning and said that the Constitution must be upheld.\n\nMessages of support from regional leaders began to pour in.\n\nColombian President Jose Manuel Santos praised President Chavez's contribution to the peace process with the FARC in Colombia. Chavez cherished the Bolivarian dream of regional unity, Santos said. He conveyed his condolences to Chavez's daughters.\n\nShare\n\nFour days ago, Chavez's son-in-law called rumors of his death \"absurd\". From a Reuters report from 1 March:\n\n\"There he is, continuing his fight, his battle, and we are sure of victory!\" his brother Adan Chavez, the governor of Barinas state, told cheering supporters during an event. [...]\n\n\"The launching of absurd and bizarre rumors by the right wing simply discredits them and isolates them further from the people,\" Chavez's son-in-law Jorge Arreaza, who is also Venezuela's science minister, said via Twitter.\n\n(via)\n\nShare\n\nThe White House has released a statement expressing \"support for the Venezuelan people\":\n\nAt this challenging time of President Hugo Chavez’s passing, the United States reaffirms its support for the Venezuelan people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship with the Venezuelan government. As Venezuela begins a new chapter in its history, the United States remains committed to policies that promote democratic principles, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.\n\nShare\n\nThe Guardian's Virginia Lopez is in Caracas, where mourners are in the streets:\n\nChavez's bereaved supporters have started gathering at the main city square, Plaza Bolivar, and chanting, \"Chavez vive, la lucha sigue\": \"Chavez lives, the battle continues\".\n\nIn other areas, people wearing the red beret that Chavez made a personal signature are singing a popular folk song that says, \"those who die for life cannot be called dead\".\n\n\"The country is in absolute calm\", says a top general in an interview with regional news channel Telesur.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nThe Guardian's Rory Carroll looks at what's ahead for Venezuela, for the government and the people, foreign oil companies and former opponents:\n\nFirst, however, will come Chávez's funeral, likely to be a vast, clamorous affair to rival Evita's. To the millions who revered him – a third of the country, according to some polls – a messiah has fallen, and their grief will be visceral. To the millions who detested him as a thug and charlatan, it will be occasion to bid, vocally or discreetly, good riddance. [...]\n\nForeign governments, not least the US administration, will watch closely to see if the late president's movement, \"Chavismo\", succeeds in holding power and perpetuating his \"21st-century socialist revolution\", a model entailing state control of the economy, subsidies to Cuba and rhetorical broadsides against Yankee imperialism.\n\nForeign oil companies, including Chevron and state-owned Russian and Chinese behemoths, will manoeuvre to protect investments. China, in particular, will be anxious for the new president to honour the huge loans it has made to Venezuela, which Chávez used to supplement record oil revenues and government spending.\n\nThe election, should it be held by the deadline mandated by the constitution, will probably pit the vice-president, Nicolás Maduro, Chávez's anointed heir, against Henrique Capriles, an opposition regional governor who lost to Chávez in last October's election.\n\nShare\n\nChavez had 4.14m followers on Twitter, and many of them are replying to his last tweet, from 18 February: \"I'm devoted to Christ and trust in my doctors and nurses. Ever onward to victory! We will live and overcome!!\"\n\nShare\n\nVirginia Lopez reports from Caracas for the Guardian, where vice president Nicolas Maduro has called for calm:\n\nFlags in government buildings were lowered to half mast shortly after Maduro announced Chavez's death.\n\nMaduro deployed National Guard troops in the streets of Caracas as a precautionary measure. During his announcement, Maduro made repeated calls for calm, asking people to \"live their pain in absolute peace.\"\n\nNow, state-run channel VTV is rebroadcasting Chavez's last televised message, broadcast 8 December.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nVice President Nicolas Maduro announced the death in a national television broadcast. He said Chavez died at 4:25 p.m. local time.\n\nThe Guardian's Jonathan Watts describes the scene:\n\nFighting back tears, Maduro announced on a nation-wide televised address that Chavez, 58, had died at 4.25 PM today.\n\nFlanked by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Elias Jaua, Chavez's son-in-law, Jorge Arreaza and the highest members of the military, Maduro asked Venezuelans for calm while thanking President Chavez for giving the people his life.\n\n\"Comandante, from wherever you are, thank you for this people who you protected and you loved. And thank you to our people whom we ask to live their grief in peace\".\n\nShare\n\nVenezuela's defense minister is pledging that the military will remain loyal to the constitution in the wake of President Hugo Chavez's death, the Associated Press reports.\n\nAdmiral Diego Molero appeared on national television to appeal for \"unity, tranquility and understanding\" among Venezuelans.\n\nHe says troops will safeguard the sovereignty of the country.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nA video pulling together some of Hugo Chávez's most memorable speeches and moments in his political career, from his verbal attacks on President George Bush to his support for Fidel Castro:\n\nShare\n\nHugo Chavez, president of Venezuela, died on Tuesday at age 58, his vice president announced. We're rounding up the international reaction to the passing of one of the most colorful figures on the world stage.\n\nOur Latin America correspondent Jonathan Watts has the full story here.\n\nThe symbol of Latin American socialism succumbed to a respiratory infection on Tuesday evening, 21 months after he first revealed he had a tumour. He had not been seen in public for three months since undergoing emergency surgery in Cuba on 11 December.\n\nHe will be given a state funeral in Caracas, likely to be attended by millions of supporters and leftwing leaders from across the globe who have been inspired by Chávez's doctrine of \"Bolivarian 21st-century socialism\", grateful for the subsidised energy he provided or simply impressed by his charisma.\n\nShare"
