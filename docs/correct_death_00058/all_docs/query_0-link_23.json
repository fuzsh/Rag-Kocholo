        "text": "The archaeology of Latin America contains many unique features, both in focus and approach. This pioneering and comprehensive survey is the first overview of current themes in Latin American archaeology written solely by scholars native to the region, making their collective expertise available to an English-speaking audience. The contributors cover the most significant issues in the archaeology of Latin America, such as the domestication of camelids, the emergence of urban society in Mesoamerica, the frontier of the Inca empire, and the relatively little known archaeology of the Amazon basin. Further subjects covered include hunter-gatherer studies, the political implications of the history of archaeology in Brazil, and the French theoretical influence on the region. The book also presents an account of Latin American social archaeology, probably the region's best-known theoretical product. written solely by academics native to the region, and it makes their collected expertise available to an English-speaking audience for the firsttime. The contributors cover the most significant issues in the archaeology of Latin America, such as the domestication of camelids, the emergence of urban society in Mesoamerica, the frontier of the Inca empire, and the relatively little known archaeology of the Amazon basin.\n\nBy and large, existing studies of the conquest of the great Inca Empire by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century simplify the unexpected triumph of the few Spaniards over the many Incas, attributing it to the superior weaponry and warfare of the conquistadors. As the Incan society displayed tendencies of continuity in its traditional practices of war and, on a smaller scale, change and transformation by appropriating European weaponry and horses, the former served in the formation of the negative perception of the Incan society as conservative and unable to evolve in accordance with its new reality, while the latter was seen as merely a rare exception in which the Incas would attempt to imitate their enemies only to fail due to their incompetence. With this in mind, the aim of this article is to study the factors due to which the Incas supposedly resisted change and insisted on continuing with their traditional practices of war. In the final analysis it appears that the Incas, rather than not being able to, would not change and transform. Guided by a different Cosmos-vision, the Inca social and military elites limited the use of Spanish weaponry and horses as means to maintain the powers in their hands and resisted the adaptation of the Western modes of war in order to revalidate their way of life that was threatened by the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.\n\nThis article proposes to put together an iconographical analysis of Inca colonial qeros, offering an insight into Inca history where one can observe, in visual format, one of the media of expression the Incas used in order to disseminate their values and traditions and, in the ultimate instance, their ideology. A remarkable number of qeros portray scenes of battle between Incas and western Amazonian Indians (or Antis), often with Amazonian fauna and flora forming a backdrop. It seems that from all the four corners of Tahuantinsuyu, the Antisuyu (the Amazonian part of the Inca empire) is the quarter that holds a very special place when it comes to the imagery on Inca wooden vases known as qeros. Bearing this in mind, we shall analyse some of these wooden vases in order to better understand the images of the Antisuyu and its inhabitants which the Incas chose to project through this particular medium.\n\nThis paper explores what Guaman Poma communicates about tukapu and native modes of discourse through the illustrations and format of the Inca section of his chronicle. Building on seminal work of other authors who have recognized \"the pattern of spatial signification\" (Adorno 1986: 89) in Guaman Poma's drawings, I argue that Guaman Poma spatially connects particular tukapu with different divisions and groups within the Inca Empire. Using the key illustration of the Inca and his Royal Council, I examine Guaman Poma's nested expressions of socio-political organization in the tukapu tunic of the Inca and support the connections with ethnohistoric, ethnographic and archaeological data."
