        "text": "By the 1998 elections more than half the Venezuelan populace was below the poverty line, while annual inflation exceeded 30 percent and oil prices were in steep decline. The voters rejected the traditional political parties of Democratic Action and COPEI and elected Chávez as president. At the same time, his coalition became the largest voting bloc in the legislature. Chávez’s political platform promised to rid the country of corruption, help the poor, and reduce the power of elites. He pledged to write a new constitution and remake Venezuelan democracy. In mid-1999 Venezuelans elected a constituent assembly dominated by pro-Chávez delegates, and voters soon approved a new constitution by referendum.\n\nIn December 1999 Venezuelans suffered one of the deadliest events in their national history. A severe rainstorm brought on mud slides and flash floods that ravaged communities along the mountainous northern coast, including sections of the Caracas metropolitan area. Hundreds of thousands of structures were damaged or destroyed, and estimates of the dead ranged from a few thousand to tens of thousands. Following the cataclysm, the nation focused its efforts on reconstruction projects and emergency aid, including resettling thousands of homeless families.\n\nThroughout his first term, Chávez’s plans to reform policies in keeping with his leftist ideology faltered. Although Chávez enjoyed the support of the working class for his spending on education, food coupons, and social services, other Venezuelans opposed his programs, and in 2001 the implementation of his economic reforms prompted massive protests and strikes.\n\nIn April 2002 a coup briefly ousted him from office, but within two days, after protests from his supporters and threats of rebellion by troops loyal to him, he was reinstated. In late 2002 Chávez’s opponents organized a general strike to force his resignation or early elections. The economy was severely damaged by the closure of shops and factories and especially by the strike in the oil sector. Nevertheless, Chávez was able to withstand the pressure, and in February 2003, after strike organizers decided to scale back their efforts, businesses reopened. The following year the opposition collected the more than 2.4 million signatures required to force a referendum on Chávez’s continued rule, but in August 2004 the president survived the recall effort, garnering the support of nearly three-fifths of voters. During this period, Chávez spent petroleum income to fund social programs. He continued his support for Cuban Pres. Fidel Castro, supplying petroleum to Cuba and other developing nations at cut-rate prices. Chávez remained determined to reduce U.S. economic influence in South America and promoted Mercosur, a South American regional economic organization.\n\nEdwin Lieuwen John D. Martz Jennifer L. McCoy Heather D. Heckel\n\nIn 2006 Chávez was elected to a six-year presidential term. Following that landslide victory, he initiated a program of nationalization that included the takeover of the petroleum sector, which was completed in 2007 when Venezuela assumed operational control of the oil industry in the Orinoco basin—the world’s single largest known oil deposit—from foreign-owned companies. Chávez announced his intention to secure at least 60 percent ownership of the operations for his country. Also that year Venezuela created its own time zone, setting its clocks back half an hour.\n\nAt the end of 2007, however, Venezuelan voters rejected a controversial constitutional referendum that included an amendment which would have allowed Chávez to run for reelection indefinitely. The referendum, which failed by a slim margin (51 to 49 percent), marked the first significant defeat at the polls for Chávez, whose left-of-centre ideology kept Venezuela in the focus of international politics through his prominent opposition to the United States. Undeterred, in 2008 Chávez nationalized Venezuela’s telecommunications, electricity, steel, and cement companies.\n\nIn July 2010, responding to Colombian accusations that Venezuela was sheltering FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia; Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces) rebels, Chávez broke off relations with Colombia. Diplomatic relations were resumed relatively quickly, however, after a conciliatory meeting in August between Chávez and Colombian Pres. Juan Manuel Santos.\n\nBy this time Chávez had reversed his earlier defeat regarding term limits. In February 2009 a constitutional referendum calling for the elimination of term limits on all elected officials had been approved by more than 54 percent of voters, clearing the way for Chávez to run for president again in 2012. Legislative elections in September 2010 indicated Chávez’s continued popularity. Yet, although the president’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela; PSUV) won more than half the seats in the National Assembly, it failed to maintain a two-thirds majority. The coalition of opposition parties that took more than a third of the seats thus would be able to block certain legislation and executive appointments."
