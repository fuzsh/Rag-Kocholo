        "text": "Venezuela is marking the first anniversary of the death of Hugo Chavez, who died of cancer after 14 years as president.\n\nHis successor, Nicolas Maduro, is leading a parade and a ceremony later at the military headquarters in Caracas where Chavez is buried.\n\nThe anniversary comes at a time of tension, with people staging daily anti-government demonstrations.\n\nVenezuelans are deeply divided about Chavez's legacy.\n\nHis supporters point to the significant reductions in inequality, poverty and malnutrition which Venezuela experienced under his leadership to explain their unwavering backing for \"Chavismo\", his distinct brand of socialism.\n\nHis critics accused him of being \"dictatorial\" and of championing the poor at the expense of Venezuela's middle class.\n\nThey say he and President Maduro, who has promised to continue the policies of his predecessor, have ruined the economy of the oil-rich country by alienating foreign investors.\n\nTens of thousands of people have taken part in marches over the past month demanding that more be done to curb insecurity and improve the economy.\n\nVenezuela has one of the world's highest murder rates and official figures published in December put inflation at 56.2%.\n\nThere have also been pro-government marches, during which thousands of people have expressed their support for Mr Maduro, whom they describe as Chavez's \"son\" and \"heir\".\n\nWednesday's ceremonies will be attended by left-wing leaders from the region, including Cuba's Raul Castro, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, and Bolivia's Evo Morales."
