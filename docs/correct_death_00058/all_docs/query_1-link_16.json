        "text": "Last night's passing of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has left a leadership vacuum in the country with no palatable \"Chavistas\" ready to carry the torch. At least not in the way the charismatic Chavez did since he took office and dodged bullets in 1999. There has been no other leader in Latin America that has derided such controversy.\n\nChavez died from respiratory failure following several surgeries to treat the 58 year old's two year bout with pelvic cancer.\n\nOn Tuesday evening around 4:25 pm local time in Caracas, the Vice-President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro announced Chavez's death in a tearful press conference. Although many Venezuelans and the market in general had been expecting such an announcement sooner rather than later, it is not clear at this stage if the government will strictly follow all of the steps detailed in the country’s constitution, rewritten by Chavez within his first two years in power.\n\nUnder those laws, the president of the National Assembly was to lead the country in the case of the president's death. A new election would take place within 30 days, as is scheduled at this time. But Chavez, in this case, made it clear before death, apparently, that he wanted Maduro to lead in the interim.\n\nIf the National Assembly leader was in charge as the Constitution states, however, that would make Venezuela's interim president Diosdado Cabello. Both Maduro and Cabello are Chavez supporters. Cabello, for his part, was part of the military forces that rescued Chavez from a 2002 coup d' état, Caracas' version of the Bay of Pigs where business elites given Washington's blessings ousted the leftist leader from power for 47 hours before Cabello and others brought him back. A longstanding anti-Americanism stemmed forth from that day on. Relations between Venezuela, an important oil supplier to the United States, and Washington have remained strained ever since.\n\nIn fact, some in Congress were quick to lambaste Chavez moments after his death.\n\n\"Hugo Chavez was a tyrant who forced the people of Venezuela to live in fear. His death dents the alliance of anti-U.S. leftist leaders in South America. Good riddance to this dictator,\" California Tea Party Congressman Ed Royce, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, was quoted saying in CNN today. \"Venezuela once had a strong democratic tradition and was close to the United States. Chavez's death sets the stage for fresh elections. While not guaranteed, closer U.S. relations with (this) key country in our Hemisphere are now possible.\"\n\nIn an election, Chavez supporters will most likely choose the deceased leader's chosen one, which is Maduro. Maduro is the former Foreign Affairs Minister under Chavez. He is more working class-Venezuelan-turned-bureaucrat than he is anything close to Chavez-light.\n\nLike Raul Castro is no Fidel, and Cuba under Raul is different than the Cuba under his brother, so will Venezuela's experiment with the indigenous socialism of Simon Bolivar be ready for an update.\n\nAn election is likely to happen before the 30 day period ends. Holding elections now will be seen by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, the PSUV of \"Chavismo\" as a way to keep the fire burning for the late president and keep their party at the helm. Venezuela's economy has seen its better days. But the old pro-business elites that backed the failed coup will undoubtedly fail to win any hearts and minds in the country, despite worsening economic conditions. The currency has collapsed over 30% in the last three months, most of it by design of the country's Central Bank.\n\nThe National Electoral Council, which in the previous presidential elections has ruled in favor of PSUV, will need to decide how early to run elections. There is a leadership vacuum now. Chavez will not be governing from the grave. A PSUV leader will not lead Venezuela the way Chavez did for the last decade.\n\nThe market is expecting a big increase in volatility over the next few days. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that locally the situation is completely calm. The opposition, led by Henrique Capriles, expressed its condolence to Chavez's family and his followers and it is expecting new elections to be called soon."
