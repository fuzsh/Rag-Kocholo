        "text": "The European Commission says that Slovakia’s changeover to the euro is proceeding smoothly today (1 January), as Slovaks get used to their new currency.\n\nAccording to the Commission, “all available data indicate that the changeover from the Slovak koruna went well”. It says that “the conversion of the ATMs [cash machines] went smoothly and citizens were able to start withdrawing euro banknotes as of midnight”. Slovakia will operate a dual-circulation system until 16 January, meaning that koruna will still be accepted in shops, but change will be given only in euros. Banks stopped issuing koruna at midnight.\n\nSlovakia is the 16th country to join the single currency since its launch in 1999. Its entry into the eurozone means that, as of this morning, 328 million out of the EU’s population of 499m use the euro as their currency.\n\nPresident of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso will travel to Bratislava on 8 January to welcome the switchover. Slovakia’s entry into the eurozone coincides with the ten year anniversary of the euro’s launch on 1 January 1999. On that date, the 11 founder members of the euro fixed their exchange rates, and handed over their power to set interest rates to the European Central Bank. The launch of euro banknotes and coins followed on 1 January 2002. Barroso said today that “by joining the euro area, Slovakia has enhanced its long-term potential to create growth and jobs and keep inflation under control”.\n\nEU finance ministers agreed in July that Slovakia had filled the criteria to join the eurozone. It is the fourth country which joined the EU in 2004 to adopt the single currency, following Malta, Cyprus and Slovenia. Slovakia’s euro coins bear three different national designs. The €1 and €2 coins depict a double cross on three hills – a symbol of the Slovak nation since the 16th century. The smaller denomination coins depict either Bratislava Castle or Kriváň Peak in the High Tatras mountains.\n\nSlovak banks have announced steps to try and ensure that the changeover is smooth, including having longer opening hours, and increasing staff. Commercial banks will exchange koruna into euros free of charge until the end of 2009, following which people wanting to change money will have to go to the country’s central bank.\n\nThe Slovak authorities have set up a voluntary “ethical” pricing scheme for shops to try and prevent price increases, which were a notable problem when the first eleven eurozone members introduced euro notes and coins. The Association of Slovak Consumers has also set up a price monitoring scheme. According to Commission polling, 65% of Slovaks are afraid there will be price increases.\n\nUnder the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, member states are obliged to join the euro once certain budgetary and monetary requirements are met. The UK and Denmark both have an opt-out allowing them not to comply. In a message to the Slovak people, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Joaquín Almunia said that he is “convinced” that the “dynamism of the Slovakian economy will be reinforced by membership”, and that the continuing spread of the euro “will also bring a common sense of purpose and a common sense of identity” to the EU."
