        "text": "Currency in Slovakia\n\nA Travel Money Guide to Slovakia\n\nSlovakia is an unusual travel destination still comparatively untrammelled by tourists to Europe. Yet there’s so much to offer, from the small country’s mystical castles and charming towns to captivating mountains and stunning glacial lakes.\n\nIf you’re heading to Slovakia and you’re looking for the best value, you’ll want to read up on the local currency, along with everything from bank card payments and ATM withdrawals to currency exchanges.\n\nWe’re here to get you up to speed fast. This guide covers everything you need to know, including:\n\nThe official currency of Slovakia\n\nThe pros and cons of using a bank card in Slovakia\n\nWhat the Slovakian Euro looks like\n\nThe average costs of things in Slovakia\n\nHow the euro converts\n\nWhat to do with leftover euros\n\nHow to exchange the currency in Slovakia\n\nSome hot tips to help you save money\n\nHow to buy Slovakian currency before you leave\n\nWhat Currency is Used in Slovakia\n\nSince 2009, Slovakia has used the official currency of the European Union: the euro. The euro replaces the old currency, the Slovak koruna, which had been used since Slovakia became independent from Czechoslovakia in 1993.\n\nSlovakia is one of 19 European Union member countries – collectively called the eurozone – that have adopted the euro as legal tender.\n\nThe euro is represented by the currency code EUR and the symbol €. In Slovakia, you may often see the symbol written after the numeral and decimal points written as commas rather than full stops (for example 10,50€ instead of €10.50).\n\nWhat the Euro Looks Like in Slovakia\n\nEuro coins come in eight denominations of one cent, two cents, five cents, ten cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, €1, and €2. Banknotes come in denominations of €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200, and €500.\n\nAlthough a common currency throughout the eurozone, all coins have different designs, depending on their country of origin. But don’t worry, every different euro coin can be used interchangeably throughout the eurozone.\n\nOne side of the coin is the same across the eurozone and has the denomination value and a map of the European Union.\n\nIn Slovakia, the side with the national design features important national symbols. The one, two, and five cent coins have the peak of the Tatra mountains. The ten, 20, and fifty cent coins feature Bratislava castle. And the €1 and €2 coins showcase the national emblem of Slovakia: a double cross on three hills.\n\nUnlike euro coins, euro banknotes are easy to handle with the same design used everywhere in Europe.\n\nUsing a Currency Converter\n\nThe euro’s value is impacted by different factors, from supply and demand of the currency to economic and political events both regionally and globally.\n\nOur foreign currency converter below will show you the mid-market exchange rate - the midway point between the buy and sell rate. This is the ‘truest’ rate you’ll find (the one shown on Google and XE).\n\nUse this tool to get a real-time rate of AUD to EUR and find out how much it will cost you to buy euros with S Money.\n\nAUD to EUR\n\nFrom\n\nAustralian Dollars (AUD)\n\n⇆\n\nTo\n\nEUR\n\nSo is this a good rate?\n\n0.6048\n\nLow\n\n0.5852 Average\n\n0.605 High\n\n0.6248\n\nToday's rate is lower than the average rate to buy EUR. This chart compares today's rate to the average rate from the past 90 days.\n\nHow to Exchange Currency in Slovak Republic\n\nATMs in Slovakia\n\nATMs, called bankomats in Slovak, are everywhere in Slovakia so you’ll have no trouble withdrawing money from a machine.\n\nBank branches, shopping centres, and supermarkets are the most common places to find ATMs.\n\nDon’t forget you’re paying for the convenience: most ATMs charge a fee for withdrawals. These will usually be shown on the screen so you can choose whether to continue with the transaction. Independent ATMs generally apply higher fees than bank ATMs.\n\nIf you want to avoid the ATM fees, see if your home bank is affiliated with any Slovakian banks.\n\nThe ATM provider’s fee is on top of the fees your home bank may charge for overseas ATM withdrawals and currency conversions.\n\nFinally, watch out for a clever scheme that sounds convenient but can be quite the rip-off. In the middle of a transaction, you may have the option of being charged in your home currency.\n\nSounds great, right?\n\nSadly, this service usually provides a far worse foreign exchange rate than what your home bank will charge so always opt to pay in the local currency.\n\nCurrency Exchange Outlets\n\nYou can exchange your home currency for euros at Slovakian banks or certified exchange offices. These are most commonly found in major hotels and some department stores.\n\nJust remember to inspect the notes before you leave the office as some merchants refuse to take notes with even the slightest blemish.\n\nIn Slovakia, particularly in Bratislava, people may approach you on the streets offering money exchange services with good exchange rates. This is usually a scam designed to rob tourists by providing counterfeit money.\n\nTravellers Cheques\n\nLess relevant than they used to be, it’s best just to avoid travellers cheques these days.\n\nIn Slovakia, stores, restaurants, and small hotels will refuse direct payments with travellers cheques. And if you find somewhere to exchange them, it will probably be with a poor exchange rate.\n\nJust stick to cash currency exchanges or your bank card and you should be fine.\n\nBuying Slovakia’s Currency Before You Go\n\nIf you’re looking for value, add ‘buy currency’ to your travel planning list and secure your euros before you leave home. This also frees up your time in Slovakia to explore.\n\nThere are three ways to buy euros from home:\n\nBuying euros online to be delivered or for you to pick up in-store.\n\nSwapping AUD for EUR at a currency exchange store.\n\nBuying euros at the airport.\n\nSince Australian airport exchange bureaus are among the most expensive in the world, it’s not a good idea to leave your currency exchange until the last minute.\n\nInstead, get the most value by jumping online. Online currency exchange retailers like S Money can offer the real mid-market exchange rates you see on Google or XE.\n\nIf you still prefer to exchange currency at a bricks-and-mortar bureau, head to one in the CBD as suburban outlets don’t usually offer the best deals.\n\nUsing Your Bank Card in Slovakia\n\nThese days, everybody travels with a bank card of some sort. Some of the best travel money cards include debit, credit and prepaid cards – but accessibility and fees differ depending on the type of bank card and the issuer you choose.\n\nVisa, Mastercard, and Maestro bank cards are widely used but you may have trouble paying with American Express.\n\nAlso remember: in Slovakia, you’ll have fewer problems if you have a card with a chip and four-digit PIN.\n\nDebit Cards\n\nDebit cards are common across Slovakia. Just beware, your home bank may impose high rates and fees if you use your card overseas. These fees might cover ATM withdrawals, overseas transactions, and currency conversions.\n\nSome cards that offer more competitive rates and lower (or even no) fees include:\n\nCredit Cards\n\nSlovakia is friendly towards plastic money like credit cards, with Visa and Mastercard widely accepted.\n\nSome retailers refuse American Express; Diners Club is more commonly allowed. Some shops are also reluctant to accept cards issued by foreign banks so be sure to check before you buy anything.\n\nTime to get savvy. Find out whether you incur fees by using your credit card overseas. These could include cash advance fees for ATM withdrawals, international transaction fees, and overseas ATM withdrawal charges.\n\nOur recommendation is the 28 Degrees credit card option, which offers lower fees and charges than most.\n\nPrepaid Travel Cards\n\nPrepaid travel cards work by letting you load up in the currency of your choice and lock in the exchange rate.\n\nThough you avoid some fees, you might end up squandering those savings on other charges, such as reload fees and inactivity fees. Travel cards also usually apply ATM withdrawal fees.\n\nNot only this, it can often take days for your currency to actually load onto your card, leaving you potentially cash-strapped.\n\nIf you still like the idea of locking in the exchange rate, both the Revolut and TransferWise debit cards come with currency loading options.\n\nThe Average Cost to Travel Around Slovakia\n\nWhen planning out your trip, it can help to know your budget so you can estimate how much currency you’ll need. Here are some average costs for items you may buy:\n\n€40-90\n\nA room in a guesthouse\n\n€30\n\nTwo-course meal at a nice restaurant\n\n€4\n\nA beer\n\n€18–30 per day\n\nCar rental\n\n€7–10\n\nA castle tour\n\nLeftover Euros at the End of Your Trip? What to Do with That Unused Cash\n\nIt’s annoying returning from a trip with a wad of foreign cash but there are plenty of ways to dispose of these unwanted coins and notes:\n\nYour airline might distribute envelopes for currency collection to donate to charities (check out Qantas’s Change for Good program with UNICEF).\n\nAustralian international airports often have collection boxes for unwanted currency, which is donated to charity.\n\nDrop off your currency at any branch of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which then gives every cent to UNICEF.\n\nChange your currency either at the airport or, better yet, with a money changer in the city.\n\nWhy not hold onto those euros for a friend just heading off? It’ll be a lovely surprise and going away gift for them!\n\nKeep your money for later trips to Europe. The euro is the official legal currency of 19 eurozone countries and accepted by many more.\n\n7 Travel Money Tips for Trips to Slovakia\n\nMany tourists waste money through not finding the best ways to exchange their currency.\n\nTo help you avoid this predicament, here are a few practical tips to help you get the most bang for your … euro:\n\nAvoid the airports! Currency exchange bureaus at the airport charge epic fees. If you like a good deal – or even just a reasonable one – avoid these at all costs.\n\nOnly carry what you need – It can be expensive to change euros back into AUDs so only take what you think you’ll spend. Not only this – nobody likes to tuck wads of notes into their socks and toiletries for safekeeping on longer journeys.\n\nAsk for a mix of denominations – Make it easy on yourself and the vendors by getting a mix of smaller notes.\n\nCheck your exchange rate – Google and XE.com are the standard market exchange rate but you’ll notice how wildly bank and currency exchanges can vary their rates. Try to get as close to the market rate as possible.\n\nLook out for hidden fees – The bane of our (financial) existence, hidden fees will often make a huge difference to the cost of your holiday. Be particularly wary of hidden bank fees for overseas card usage.\n\nThe right card makes all the difference – Having a card is convenient but it can take a hit to the bank account if you have the wrong card. Research and arm yourself with the best card for travel for big savings.\n\nMix it up! Many travellers only use their credit card while some only think about cash. But the best option depends on your situation. Save the card for huge purchases such as hotels and car hire and reserve your cash for smaller wins – transport, attractions, or meals out.\n\nLearn more about the Euro Currency Exchange\n\nReady to buy some euros at a great value for your trip?
