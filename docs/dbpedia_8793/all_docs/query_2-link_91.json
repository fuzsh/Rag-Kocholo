        "text": "Slovakia is currently in the research phase, according to reporting in Coin Telegraph. However, unlike countries pursuing CBDCs, Slovakia is considered to be in a research phase because it reportedly drafted legislation to protect cash as a precautionary measure against the proposed European Central Bank’s CBDC.\n\nA full analysis of the CBDC developments in Slovakia and Slovakia’s treatment of civil liberties is forthcoming.\n\nIn the meantime, for additional information on concerns regarding violations of human rights and civil liberties, see the following reports by Amnesty International, Financial Tyranny Index, Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, Privacy International, and the U.S. Department of State. For additional information on concerns regarding the risks of CBDCs, see the following webpage and report by the Cato Institute: The Risks of CBDCs and Central Bank Digital Currency: Assessing the Risks and Dispelling the Myths.\n\nFor additional information regarding metrics, the methodology page explains each of the data points and provides their respective sources."
