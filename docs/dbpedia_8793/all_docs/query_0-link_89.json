        "text": "Mr Pociatek says euro entry will boost Slovakian growth\n\nThe European Union has formally invited Slovakia to join the European single currency and has set the rate at which korunas will be exchanged for euros.\n\nThe official rate has been set at 30.1260 korunas to the euro.\n\nSlovakia will adopt the euro on 1 January 2009, becoming the 16th official member country to do so.\n\nThe European Union's 27 finance ministers approved Slovakia's entry despite concerns from the European Central Bank about its inflation.\n\n\"I am delighted to be welcoming Slovakia into the eurozone,\" said EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.\n\nEuro entry 'beneficial'\n\nSlovakia recently strengthened the value of the koruna by 15%, partly in an attempt to fight inflation.\n\nSlovakia follows other recent euro adopters including Slovenia (from 2007), and Cyprus and Malta in January this year.\n\nIts use of the single currency will add one percentage point to its economic growth, according to Slovakian finance minister Jan Pociatek."
