        "text": "Microchip\n\nYour pet must have a working microchip (also called a “transponder”) before getting its rabies vaccination for travel to the EU, and your veterinarian must always scan the microchip before giving your pet a rabies vaccination.\n\nIf your pet does not yet have a microchip or has a microchip that doesn’t work, ask your veterinarian to implant an ISO-compliant* microchip.\n\nIf your pet has a working microchip, but it is not ISO compliant,* you will need to travel with your own scanner that can read the microchip OR have a second microchip implanted that is ISO compliant.* Make sure both microchips are listed on the health certificate!\n\n*ISO-compliant microchip numbers are usually 15 digits long and meet specific international standards (ISO 11784 and ISO 11785). You can check ISO-compliance with the microchip manufacturer.\n\nRabies Vaccination\n\n“Primary” Rabies Vaccination:\n\nThe first rabies vaccination your pet gets after its microchip or after any lapse in coverage is a “primary” rabies vaccination according to EU rules.\n\nFor all pets vaccinated in the United States, a “primary” rabies vaccination is only valid for 1 year. Even if your pet is an adult animal and receives a three-year vaccine, if it is a “primary” rabies vaccination according to EU rules, it is only valid for 1 year.\n\nIf your pet does not receive another rabies vaccination within 1 year of a “primary” rabies vaccination, it means the vaccination coverage lapsed and you must start over. Even if the vaccination coverage only lapses by a day, the next rabies vaccination is again considered a “primary” rabies vaccination, and it is only valid for 1 year.\n\n“Booster” Rabies Vaccination:\n\nIf your pet does get its next rabies vaccination within 1 year of a “primary” rabies vaccination, this “booster” rabies vaccination can be valid for 1-3 years, according to the vaccine manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nNote: If your pet’s most recent rabies vaccination before traveling to the EU is a “booster” rabies vaccination (rather than “primary”), you are responsible for providing all relevant rabies vaccination certificates to prove there was no lapse in coverage since the \"primary\" rabies vaccination.\n\nReminder! Rabies Vaccinations do NOT count according to EU rules if:\n\nYour pet got the vaccination before it had a microchip; or\n\nYour pet got the vaccination without first having its microchip scanned.\n\nYour pet should travel with all relevant rabies vaccination certificate(s), and it is strongly recommended the microchip number is recorded on all rabies vaccination certificate(s).\n\n21-Day Waiting Period\n\nAfter any \"primary\" rabies vaccination, your pet must wait 21 days before traveling to the EU. Your pet can travel to the EU less than 21 days after a “booster” rabies vaccination, but then the previous rabies vaccination must also be included on the health certificate.\n\nIf your pet is less than 16 weeks old and cannot meet the above requirements, click here.\n\nWant to simplify your paperwork?\n\nAsk your veterinarian to give your pet a 1-year rabies vaccination (after scanning the microchip) at least 21 days before your travel to the EU but less than one year before your travel date (for example, 3-6 months before travel date). That way, no matter the rabies vaccination history, you only need to keep up with one vaccination certificate instead of several! Doing it this way also makes it easier for the USDA endorsement office to review, which means you get your endorsed certificate back faster.\n\nImportant\n\nThe EU has two versions of the pet health certificate: the \"non-commercial\" and the \"commercial.\" Both health certificate versions require an Accredited Veterinarian to issue (complete, sign, and date) the health certificate and then USDA to endorse (countersign and emboss/stamp) the health certificate before your pet's travel. However, it is much easier to meet the timeframes for the \"non-commercial\" health certificate than the \"commercial\" health certificate, so keep this in mind when arranging your pet's travel.\n\n\"Non-commercial\" Health Certificate\n\nYou should use the \"non-commercial\" health certificate if you or a designated person** is traveling within 5 days before or after your pet(s), and 5 or fewer pets are traveling.\n\nThough uncommon, you can also use the \"non-commercial\" for 6 or more pets traveling to the EU for specific events like competitions, exhibitions, or sporting events.\n\nThe \"non-commercial\" health certificate is valid for 30 days after the Accredited Veterinarian issues it.\n\nThe USDA must endorse the completed health certificate within ten days of arriving in the EU. See STEP 3 below for more information on the endorsement.\n\nDeclaration: The final page of the EU Health Certificate contains a Declaration that must be completed and signed by the pet owner or designated person** before the pet travels to the EU. The Declaration must accompany the pet and health certificate to the EU.\n\nNote: You may use the “non-commercial” EU health certificate to travel within the EU for up to 4 months as long as your pet’s rabies vaccination does not expire. If you take your dog to Finland, Malta, Ireland (including Northern Ireland) or Norway after entering the EU, your dog must be treated for tapeworms by an EU veterinarian 1-5 days before entering those countries.\n\n\"Commercial\" Health Certificate\n\nYou must use the \"commercial\" health certificate if you or a designated person** cannot travel within 5 days of your pet, or you are traveling with 6 or more pets.\n\nThe \"commercial\" health certificate must be issued by an Accredited Veterinarian and endorsed by the USDA within 48 hours of departing the U.S. with your pet.\n\n**Designated person is a family member, friend, or other person authorized by the owner to travel with the pet.\n\nNote: If a Military Veterinarian* issues the health certificate, USDA endorsement is not required. However, the Military Veterinarian must issue the “non-commercial” health certificate within 10 days of arrival in the EU, or the “commercial” health certificate within 48 hours of the pet leaving the U.S.\n\n*Military Veterinarian is defined as a Veterinary Corps Officer, or civilian GS-0701 series government veterinarian employed by the U.S. Army Veterinary Service working at military treatment facilities. It does not apply to Army Veterinary Service non-appropriated funds or Department of Defense civilian contract veterinarians."
