        "text": "The Slovak Republic adopted the euro on 1 January 2009 after the EU Council accepted on 8 July 2008 the country´s entry into the eurozone.\n\nFrontloading of Slovakia with euro cash\n\nTo ensure the necessary amount of cash in the new currency, 188 million euro banknotes and 500 million euro coins were delivered to Slovakia. If all these notes were laid down next to one another, they would cover an area nine times bigger than Štrbské pleso lake. If they were laid in a row, it would stretch 25 000 kilometres, which is 50-times the distance between Bratislava and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. When it comes to coins, if they were placed on top of one another, they would reach six times higher than the highest mountain in Slovakia, the Gerlach Peak, measuring 2 655 m. And if these coins were to be divided equally among Slovak inhabitants, each person would get 96 coins. The volume mentioned was needed to cover the initial demand and supplies for Národná banka Slovenska.\n\nEuro information campaign\n\nIn preparation for the introduction of the euro, the European Central Bank, jointly with Národná banka Slovenska, organised a 300-day information campaign, which was implemented by means of direct euro packages to all households, 118 various publications, television, radio and press, as well as through the various games and competitions. There were a number of special events, such as the Conference on the Introduction of the Euro in Slovakia, which was attended by Jean-Claude Trichet, the President of the European Central Bank, and Joaquín Almunia, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs. For providing up-to-date information on the euro, a twinning programme was launched, involving the ECB, Národná banka Slovenska and selected organisations from both the public and private sectors in the country. Thank to this, banks, shops and companies were well prepared for the transfer of valuables, as too were manufacturers of money acceptance and dispensing equipment, all of which significantly contributed to the smooth introduction of the new banknotes and coins.\n\nSlovak euro coins\n\nThe themes for the national sides of the Slovak euro coins were decided in a public opinion poll, which ran from 12 to 20 November 2008. The €1 and €2 coins portray the patriarchal cross in the middle of three mountain peaks, which was designed by Ivan Řehák. The 10, 20 and 50-cent coins show Bratislava castle and the national emblem of the Slovak Republic. These designs come from the workshop of Ján Černaj and Pavol Károly.\n\nCoins with a value of 1, 2 and 5 cents, designed by Drahomír Zobek, depict the Kriváň Peak – a peak in the Tatra mountains, which is a symbol of the sovereignty of the Slovak nation. The Slovak €2 coin won the award “Best Trade Coin” (best circulatory coin) in 2011 in the Berlin competition sponsored by publishing house Krause Publications.\n\nThe euro was introduced in Slovakia on 1 January 2009 in cash and scriptural form without a transitional period, i.e. within a Big-Bang scenario. On this date, euro became the legal tender in the Slovak Republic. Slovak euro coins are valid in all euro area countries and also other euro area countries’ euro coins are the legal tender in Slovakia. Banknotes are the same throughout the euro area. From 1 January 2009 scriptural payments are exclusively in euro.\n\nEuro is used in cash circulation from 1 January 2009. Koruna became only a euro denomination. For a short dual circulation period, until 16 January 2009, it was possible to pay also with koruna banknotes and coins in the Slovak territory. The Slovak currency was gradually withdrawn from the circulation. By the end of the dual circulation, euro is the sole legal tender in the Slovak Republic.\n\nConversion of koruna values to the euro on 1 January 2009 must be performed with the conversion rate, which was irrevocably set by the Council of the EU. It is not possible to use any other rate. The conversion rate was set as a coefficient with six significant digits. It expresses the equivalent of one euro in koruna (EUR 1 = SKK 30.1260). The conversion rate must not be rounded or shortened to less than 6 significant digits in making conversions.\n\nIt is not permitted to use an inverse coefficient.\n\nThe euro introduction can not influence the continuity of contracts and other legal instruments. All contracts containing references to the Slovak koruna remained valid after the euro changeover. Values in koruna were regarded as values in euro, converted at the conversion rate. It was not possible to terminate any contract due to the euro changeover. At the same time, however, the principle of the freedom of contract was preserved and contracting parties could, by bilateral agreement, change their agreement following the euro changeover in any way.\n\nFollowing the euro introduction on 1 January 2009 it was necessary to regard references in legal instruments to the koruna as references to the euro, converted at the conversion rate. Financial amounts set in koruna which should be paid or entered into accounting in euro were rounded to the nearest euro cent. Only the final value was rounded, not partial items. No fees might be charged related to the conversion of koruna values to euro. In specific cases set by a law the rounding was even more precise than to the nearest euro cent.\n\nThe euro introduction must not harm citizens or consumers. Fees and taxes, if not precisely converted according to the rounding rules, should be rounded down, payments to citizens should be rounded up. Values rounded in favour of citizens were adjusted to whole 10 euro cents.\n\nDuring the changeover all necessary steps were taken so that the process was not abused to increase prices. The price developments were monitored and rules for the conversion of prices and their showing was enforced. Price stability must be maintained also in supplier-customer relations.\n\nEach business entity was responsible for covering its individual costs arising from the euro changeover. This applies for both the private and the public sector. Euro changeover implementation costs should be as low as possible.\n\nGeneral government bodies and local authorities or other public bodies were responsible for preparing the respective normative legal acts according to their competence. Each entity, including private sector businesses, was responsible for its organisational preparation for the euro changeover."
