        "text": "The aim is to restrict the circulation of cash-related coins by a mathematical method of rounding that is neutral, fair to both parties, both the trader and the buyer. Payments of up to 5 Eurocents are rounded to 5 Eurocents.\n\nHowever, if the final purchase price before rounding is 3.66 euros, the buyer will pay in cash after rounding 3.65 euros. However, these coins will remain accepted legal tender in Slovakia. This rounding method will not be used for card payments.\n\nTo clarify potential misconceptions about the new rounding up rules the Ministry of Finance of Slovakia has posted a Q&A regarding this topic on their official website."
