        "text": "Money in Slovakia has lost 82% of its value since 1992\n\nUpdated: August 14, 2024\n\n€100 in 1992 is equivalent in purchasing power to about €559.72 today, an increase of €459.72 over 32 years. The euro had an average inflation rate of 5.53% per year between 1992 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of 459.72%.\n\nThis means that today's prices are 5.60 times as high as average prices since 1992, according to the OECD and the World Bank consumer price index for Slovakia. A euro today only buys 17.866% of what it could buy back then. Currency values from before Slovakia began using the Euro are converted for the purpose of these calculations by the OECD.\n\nThe inflation rate in 1992 was 9.89%. The current inflation rate compared to the end of last year is now 6.06%. If this number holds, €100 today will be equivalent in buying power to €106.06 next year.\n\n⌃\n\nSlovakia inflation since 1992\n\nAnnual Rate, the OECD and the World Bank CPI\n\nDownload\n\nData source & citation\n\nYou may use the following MLA citation for this page: “Slovakia Inflation Calculator: World Bank data, 1992-2024 (EUR).” Official Inflation Data, Alioth Finance, 15 Aug. 2024, https://www.officialdata.org/slovakia/inflation."
