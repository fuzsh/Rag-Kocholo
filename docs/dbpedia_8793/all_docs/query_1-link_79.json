        "text": "In 2009, the Slovak Republic introduced the Euro as currency. The pieces were produced with the new reverse design right from the beginning. Unfortunately, Slovak 2-euro coins are hardly ever found in the wallets of other euro countries. However, you can find the beautifully designed coins from Slovakia at any coin dealer. The same applies to the internet, of course. As always, I want to introduce some pieces that are likely to increase in value. The number of 2-euro commemorative issues from Slovakia is still quite small. And mintage figures are usually below one million pieces. Coins from Slovakia could therefore be the ideal start for your 2-euro collection.\n\n2-Euro Circulation Coins\n\nThe reverse design (RV) meets the requirements set for all euro countries. In accordance with the national coat of arms, the obverse design (OBV) has featured a patriarchal cross (double cross) on a trimount since 2009. On the bottom of the left side, we can see the year and the mint mark of the Kremnica mint. On the bottom right are the initials of the artist Ivan Řehák (IR). The reeded edge reads “SLOVENSKÁ REPUBLIKA” and features a linden leaf between two stars. 2-euro circulation coins weren’t minted every year.\n\nJust like 2-euro commemorative coins, all 2-euro circulation coins consist of a ring made of cupronickel. The core is made of nickel brass with a nickel core (CuNi / Ni, CuNiZn plated). All pieces can slightly be attracted by a magnet at the centre.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nWeight: 8.50 g\n\nDiameter: 25.75 mm\n\nReeded edge\n\nIn addition to the reeded edge, circulation coins from Slovakia feature the edge inscription SLOVENSKÁ REPUBLIKA and a linden leaf between two stars.\n\nParticularities\n\nColoured or even gilded pieces aren’t official issues. They have been doctored and lost their former value as currency. Some coins show a larger gap between ring and centre, this is no minting error but a mere coincidence. The same is true for minor weak strikes.\n\nMint Error Coins\n\nSo far, no “actual” error coins have been found. Nevertheless, keep looking for minor punching errors, die cracks and rotated die error coins.\n\nAppraisal\n\n2-euro coins from Slovakia can rarely be found in circulation. Mint state specimens can be purchased on the secondary market for prices between 4 and 10 euros.\n\nJoint Issues of the Eurozone\n\nThe Slovak Republic participated in the three joint issues of the eurozone of 2009, 2012 and 2015. So far, no mint error coins have been found. These pieces are hardly ever found in circulation. On the secondary market, prices for mint state specimens range from 4 to 10 euros. The prices of all three joint issues may increase in the future.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nThe technical specifications correspond to those of a 2-euro circulation coin.\n\n20 Years Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, 2009\n\nThe motif shows a stylized bunch of keys, which served as a bell and was a typical sign of the demonstrations on 17 November 1989 in then Czechoslovakia. With keys, people protesting for freedom and democracy rang in the Velvet Revolution. At the bottom we can see the country’s name “SLOVENSKO”. Just above on the right is the mint mark and the sign of the artist.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nThe technical specifications correspond to those of a 2-euro circulation coin.\n\nParticularities\n\nColoured or even gilded pieces are not official issues. They have been doctored and lost their former value as currency.\n\nMint Error Coins\n\nSo far, no mint error coins have been found. Nevertheless, keep looking for minor punching errors, die cracks and rotated die error coins. Although pieces without centre were already offered online for a lot of money, they were manipulated. The pictures of the online offers clearly confirmed this suspicion.\n\nAppraisal\n\nThese coins can hardly be found in circulation. On the secondary market, prices for mint state specimens range between 4 and 10 euros.\n\n10th Anniversary of the Accession to the EU, 2014\n\nThe motif is dominated by the large letters “EU” – for European Union. The right side shows the date of accession (01/05/2004) and the year 2014. In addition, the coat of arms of Slovakia can be seen in the “U”. Below, the country’s name in the form of an arch, to its left the mint mark. On the right side you can see the initials of the designer Mária Poldaufová.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nThe technical specifications correspond to those of a 2-euro circulation coin.\n\nParticularities\n\nColoured or even gilded pieces are not official issues. They have been doctored and lost their former value as currency.\n\nMint Error Coins\n\nSo far, no mint error coins have been found. Nevertheless, keep looking for minor punching errors, die cracks and rotated die error coins.\n\nAppraisal\n\nThese coins cannot be found in circulation. On the secondary market, prices for mint state specimens range between 6 and 10 euros.\n\n550th Anniversary of the University Istropolitana Bratislava, 2017\n\nThe University Istropolitana was founded in 1465 and opened in 1467 in Bratislava. On the top left of the OBV is a medallion with King Matthias Corvinus, in the background a detail of the building. In addition, there is the year 1467. In the foreground is the image of two students and their teacher. Below the country’s name and the year. On the left side is the mint mark and the letters “MP” for the designer.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nThe technical specifications correspond to those of a 2-euro circulation coin.\n\nParticularities\n\nColoured or even gilded pieces are not official issues. They have been doctored and lost their former value as currency.\n\nMint Error Coins\n\nSo far, no mint error coins have been found.
