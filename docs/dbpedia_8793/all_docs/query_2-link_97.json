        "text": "The National Flag of Slovakia was officially adopted on September 3, 1992. The flag has been designed by Ladislav Cisárik and Ladislav Vrtel.\n\nThe National Flag of Slovakia is a tricolor and features three equal horizontal bands of the traditional Pan-Slavic colors: white (top), blue, and red. The Coat of Arms of Slovakia is present towards the hoist-side where it starts from the edge of the white band to continue through the blue band and extend into the upper portion of the red band. The Pan-Slavic flag colors symbolize Slavic unity and independence. The flag has a width-to-length ratio of 2:3.\n\nHistory of The Flag of Slovakia\n\nIn the 10th century, the area that is now part of modern-day Slovakia came under the control of the Kingdom of Hungary. During these times, other flags similar in design to the current day flag were in use in Slovakia. The first such flag design was used in 1848 during a revolution in the Habsburg region. Following the First World War, Czechoslovakia was established by the Czechs and the Slovaks. During WWII, similar flags were also used in Czechoslovakia and the Slovak Republic. These flags used the same colors as the current day flag of Slovakia but had a different coat of arms or were plain tricolors. This flag design was modified and a new coat of arms was added, which was accepted on March 1, 1990, as the flag of Slovak Republic within Czechoslovakia. The current version of the national flag of Slovakia was adopted on September 3, 1992."
