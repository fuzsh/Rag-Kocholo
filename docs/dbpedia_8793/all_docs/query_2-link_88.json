        "text": "European Union agreed with Slovakia’s entry into the Eurozone on 19th of June 2008 at the summit in Brussels.\n\nSlovak Republic adopted the Euro after 16 years of using Slovak Koruna (former Slovak currency code SKK). The conversion rate was set to 1 EUR = 30.126 SKK.\n\nEuro coins have 8 values: 1 cent, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents, 1 euro and 2 euros. All euro coins have a common side and a national side chosen by the respective national authorities. But, of course, any Euro coin is valid in any country of the Euro Area.\n\nEuro banknotes have 7 values: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 euros and have the same look for every country.\n\nCredit cards are accepted in most of the stores, hotels, restaurants. In larger cities there is an ATM practically on every corner, in smaller towns you don’t need to walk that much either. So you don’t really need to exchange too much before you get to Slovakia.\n\nBe aware of people offering money exchange services on the streets. Usually in Bratislava, they offer you a very good exchange rate, but you are very likely to be cheated or robbed.\n\nSometimes they sell you some cheap currency instead of Euro (Slovakia currency) or they give you counterfeit money or they put worthless papers between the regular banknotes, so it looks like a big amount of money.\n\nExchange offices at the airport, railway or bus stations are completely legal and robber-safe, but some of them use unethical business practices. Even if you see a big sign that they offer money exchange services with 0% commission, be careful!\n\nThe two most usual tricks are the following: They are showing the exchange rates of SELLING Euro, so the rates look very nice for you, but your rates for BUYING Euro are completely different/worse.\n\nThe other trick is that they show you very good buying exchange rates, but there is a small sign that those rates count only when buying more than 1000 EUR (or other amount). Always ask beforehand, what is the exchange rate for your amount of money!\n\nAlthough you may not get the best rates, the banks are the safest places offering money exchange services."
