        "text": "I'm from Slovakia and have traveled to Poland quite often. I now live in the US and visit Slovakia with US bank-issued credit cards.\n\nFirst, you need Euro in Slovakia. The only place in Slovakia where Polish currency would be usable would be the restroom. You can bring cash in USD and exchange it for Euro in banks or even better in places called Zmenaren where you get a better exchange rate. Zmenarens are located often at big bus stations, train stations, supermarkets etc. That's what I do.\n\nCredit cards/debit cards are not widely accepted in Slovakia. Don't use debit cards at all because of high fees. You can use a credit card to pay for merchandise or services. I have a credit card with 0% foreign transaction fee I have specifically for this purpose. Capital One bank offers such cards.\n\nIn Poland you need Polish Zloty. Some shops near the border may accept Euro, but they will give you a very unfavorable exchange rate. You need to exchange USD or EUR for Zloty for example at exchange booths called Kantor.\n\nIn all of the mentioned countries you'll have no problems taking out money from ATMs using Visa or Maestro. But you'll pay twice: first a commission in ATM, second the split between buy and sell price in banks, which is usually quite big.\n\nIn case of Poland, the split in bank is about 2-3 times bigger than by Kantors. Kantor is a specialized money exchange point, which can be found usually in shopping centers or on the railway/bus stations. You'll have no problem exchanging Euros and Dollars.\n\nOn Slovakia, they are called Zmenaren or similar, but expect big 'Money Exchange' boards as well. They too have quite good exchange prices. So you can take Dollars with you and exchange them to Zlotys (PLN) in Poland and Euros in Slovakia, so you'll pay no commission and only one the exchange split price (Kantors take no commission! They live from split! If someone wants commission from you, he/she is no Kantor and it's probably a scum!).\n\nAs for paying with foreign debit cards, it's not a good idea, because you may be charged a high commission for each transation (I'm not sure, but it's quite hard to get accurate information, banks are lying in open text and then charge you anyway ;). In Poland in big cities you can pay with debit card (VISA/Maestro) if you wish anyway, credit cards (not electronic) are not such widely supported. In Germany, most shops don't support any of them, because Germany has their own system of electronic cards, but their ATMs accept foreign cards without problems (not counting commission which can be 5%).\n\nI'd just take dollars with me and be carefull with my wallet."
