        "text": "Slovakia has been given the go-ahead by the European Commission to adopt the euro next year.\n\nIf the recommendation is approved by EU finance ministers in July, the nation of 5.4 million people will become the sixteenth EU member state as well as the second formerly communist country, after Slovenia, to adopt the single European currency.\n\nSlovakia will also become the fourth of the EU member states that acceded in 2004 to join the eurozone, following Slovenia in 2007 and Malta and Cyprus this year.\n\nAccording to convergence reports prepared by the Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB), Slovakia has met all the criteria for adopting the euro and the Commission will now recommend to the Council of Ministers that the country adopt the single currency at the beginning of next year.\n\nDespite concerns from the ECB that Slovakia could have difficulties keeping a lid on inflation, the country was judged to have met the entry criteria on inflation, the state of its public finances, interest rates and currency stability.\n\nA statement released by the Commission today said that, with the 12-month average inflation rate at 2.2% in March, Slovakia was well below the permitted 3.2% cap. Slovakia’s anticipated public deficit this year, 2%, is also comfortably below the 3% limit set by the Maastricht Treaty.\n\n“Slovakia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 January 2009,” said Joaquín Almunia, the EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs.\n\nAlmunia added, though, that “to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success, Slovakia must pursue its efforts to maintain a low-inflation environment, be more ambitious with regard to budgetary consolidation and strengthen its competitiveness position”.\n\nAlmunia added that other candidate countries were making good progress towards euro adoption but at different paces.\n\nThe final exchange rate for the Slovak koruna and the euro is expected to be set by EU finance ministers in July.\n\nThe koruna responded to the news by climbing to a record high of 32.055 to the euro."
