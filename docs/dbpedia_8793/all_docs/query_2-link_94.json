The country made significant economic reforms after its separation from the Czech Republic in 1993.

A basically stable and efficient business environment nonetheless leaves room for improvement. Corporate default probability is low on average.\n\n[Table of Contents]\n\nBusiness Climate\n\nMarket Access: Slovakia is a member of the European Union. It is also a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) which has guaranteed, since January 1, 1993, the free movement of most goods between the European countries. In addition, Slovakia has multilateral and bilateral agreements with other countries including the United States.\n\nEconomic Freedom: Slovakia’s economic freedom score is 65.0, making its economy the 65th freest in the 2021 Index of Economic Freedom. Slovakia is ranked 32nd out of 44 countries in the European region, and its overall score is higher than the world average. However, economic freedom peaked in 2008 and has been on a downward trend ever since. Prospects for long-term economic development have been curtailed by the government’s ineffectiveness against corruption and lack of political commitment to enhancing Slovakia’s legal framework. Government spending has been increasing, and privatization of many remaining state assets has been suspended.\n\nRegulatory System: Foreign investors and foreign companies doing business in Slovakia have complained about the transparency of regulatory processes in several industries.\n\nIntellectual Property Rights: Protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) falls under the jurisdiction of two agencies. The Industrial Property Office is responsible for most areas, including patents, and the Ministry of Culture is responsible for copyrights (including software). Slovakia is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the European Patent Organization (EPO) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).\n\nExchange Control: Foreign exchange operations in Slovakia allow easy conversion or transfer of funds associated with an investment. As a member of the OECD, Slovakia meets all of the international standards for conversion and transfer policy. Slovaks are free to trade, buy and sell foreign securities and there are very few controls on capital transactions.\n\nCorruption: The business community considers corruption and political influence to be significant problems within the Slovak legal system. U.S. and other companies have reported to their embassies instances of multi-million dollar losses that were settled out of court because of doubts about the court system’s ability to offer a credible legal remedy.\n\nPolitical Violence: There have been no reports of politically motivated damage to property, and civil disturbances are extremely rare. There has been no violence directed toward foreign-owned companies.\n\n[Table of Contents]\n\nBusiness Protocol\n\nSlovak business-people initially take a formal and distant approach to people in business. Be prepared for a seemingly cold reception at first. However, the younger generation involved in business are willing to dispense with protocol and use a slightly more relaxed level of formality.\n\nFirst names are seldom used in business.\n\nBusiness cards: It’s a good idea to have one side of your business card printed in Slovak. You should also include the length of time your firm has been in business, if more than 20 years, and any advanced university degrees you have obtained.\n\nIn general, meetings are conducted by the most senior person present, who sets the agenda, the content, and the pace. The purpose is usually to communicate information and decisions that have already been made, not to brainstorm or discuss. Employees may be called on to corroborate or clarify facts and statistics, but will not usually be asked to collaborate.\n\nMore information on Business Protocol: Kwintessential\n\n[Table of Contents]\n\n**********\n\nSubscribe to the Credit-to-Cash Advisor\n\nMonthly e-Newsletter — It’s Free\n\nThis information is provided by ABC-Amega Inc.
