On 8 July 2008 the European Council gave its green light to the adoption of the euro by Slovakia on 1 January 2009. Slovakia adopted a 'big-bang' scenario, with a short dual circulation period running until 16 January 2009 where cash payments were possible in both euro and Slovak korunas.\n\nExchange of former national currency\n\nThe Národná banka Slovenska (National Bank of Slovakia) exchanged Slovak koruna coins until 2 January 2014 and will exchange Slovak koruna notes for an unlimited time period.\n\nInstitutions"
