        "text": "BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — To the sound of midnight fireworks and pealing church bells, Slovakia joined the eurozone. The small alpine nation today became the 16th country to adopt the euro, a European Union project that celebrates its 10th birthday this New Year’s Day. With Slovakia, the currency will be used by 330 million people with an annual gross domestic product of more than 4 trillion euros ($5.6 trillion)."
