Slovakia has become the 16th member of the European Union to use the euro currency.

As the world ushered in the New Year, 100,000 people gathered in Slovakia's capital to celebrate the country's move to the euro currency.

The Slovak Prime Minister was one of the first to withdraw the new currency, taking 100 euros from a cash machine.

The country is the 16th to use the euro after 11 European Union members launched it 10 years ago, and the second former communist country to join eurozone.

The Slovak koruna will remain in circulation alongside the euro until January 16.

Slovakia's adoption of the euro comes as the currency has soared in value against both the US dollar and the pound.

Slovakia hopes the move to the euro will provide stability in the global economic storm.
