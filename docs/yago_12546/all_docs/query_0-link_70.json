Order your copy now from Flicker Alley. + READ MORE\n\nAn amazingly original hybrid of film noir, supernatural fantasy, and backstage melodrama, the film stars Joan Leslie as a Broadway actress who magically relives the previous year of her life, but can she alter the fateful mistakes and misjudgments that led to a New Year's Eve tragedy? Think of it as film noir's answer to It's a Wonderful Life or a full-length precursor to The Twilight Zone.\n\nThe movie features an array of vivid performances by Joan Leslie in her first post-ingÃ©nue role, Louis Hayward, Virginia Field, Tom Conway, and Richard Basehart in his movie debut as poet William Williams, one of the era's most sensitive depictions of a gay artist.\n\nIn the years after its release, Repeat Performance seemingly vanished. For many who'd seen it, the film's startling premise and stunning set-pieces became merely a tantalizing memory. It fell so far off the cultural radar people began to think they'd only imagined the movie. But thanks to the dedication and diligence of the Film Noir Foundation, Repeat Performance was restored in 2012 in collaboration with UCLA Film & Television Archive and the Packard Humanities Institute.\n\nBLU-RAY/DVD BONUS MATERIALS INCLUDE:\n\nâ½ Video introduction by FNF president Eddie Muller\n\nâ½ Video profile of Joan Leslie by author and film historian Farran Smith Nehme\n\nâ½ Mini-documentary on Eagle-Lion Pictures produced, directed and edited by Steven C. Smith; written and narrated by Alan K. Rode\n\nâ½ Digital press book: a complete digital edition of the film's original 1947 pressbook\n\nâ½ Audio commentary by film historian Nora Fiore (The Nitrate Diva)\n\nâ½ Souvenir booklet featuring author Brian Light's book-to-film comparison of William O'Farrell's original novel with screenwriter Walter Bullock's script, along with an array of original photos, lobby cards, and posters.\n\nORDER HERE\n\n↑ COLLAPSE\n\nTwo FNF restoration set\n\nThe FNF funded restorations of two 1947 film noirs, The Guilty and High Tide are now available for pre-order in a beautiful Blu‑ray/DVD combo set that includes extensive special features from Flicker Alley. + READ MORE\n\nJohn Reinhardt's The Guilty centers on war veterans Mike Carr (Don Castle) and Johnny Dixon (Wally Cassell), roommates in a low-rent tenement. They are romantically entangled with twin sisters Estelle and Linda Mitchell (Bonita Granville, in a dual role). When one sister turns up dead, the boys are hounded by a suspicious police inspector (Regis Toomey). Working on only three sets, with a shoestring budget, Reinhardt and director of photography Henry Sharp evoke the dreadful, dead-of-night ambiance that was the domain of the era's most prolific noir scribe, Cornell Woolrich. The rarely seen noir has been restored from a 35mm nitrate composite fine-grain master by UCLA Film & Television Archive and is now presented in this world-premiere edition.\n\nHigh Tide was the second of two crime thrillers independently produced in 1947 by Texas oil tycoon Jack Wrather. It carries over from The Guilty the same screenwriter and cameraman, the same protagonist in actor Don Castle, and the same director, John Reinhardt, whose playful inventiveness enlivened several post-WW II films noir. The action gets rolling with one of the greatest framing gimmicks in noir: a speeding car crashes onto a rocky shoreline and its occupants, newspaper editor Hugh Fresney (Lee Tracy) and private eye Tim Slade (Don Castle) recount the plot as the rising tide threatens to drown them. In flashback, we learn that Slade was brought in by muckraking editor Fresney as protection against a mobster (Anthony Warde) his paper is investigating. Things quickly get complicated as Fresney's boss has a wife (Julia Bishop) eager to resume a smoldering romance with Slade. This forgotten noir was rescued with the combined efforts of the FNF, UCLA Film & Television Archive, and the British Film Institute. Restoration funding was provided by the FNF in conjunction with the Packard Humanities Institute.\n\nORDER HERE\n\n↑ COLLAPSE\n\nAsk Eddie anything!\n\nDid you know that The Film Noir Foundation livestreams every two weeks on our Facebook page in which Eddie Muller answers questions submitted by our e‑mail subscribers?

The recipes came from a variety of sources including Ernest Hemmingway and Sam Fuller. Some were even created by Eddie himself. Eddie also draws on his past as a bartender to coach you on the supplies and the techniques you will need to create these libations in your own home. The book is stylishly laid out and filled with movie stills, poster art, behind-the-scenes images, and cocktail photography. The book is available from Running Press.\n\nNewest FNF restoration available\n\nPreserved by the Film Noir Foundation in 2013 and now beautifully restored through the UCLA Film & Television Archive,Â Never Open That Door (No abras nunca esa puerta)Â is a significant example of the cross-cultural cinematic legacy shared by the United States and Argentina during the post-WWII era. Based on two short stories by American master of suspense fiction Cornell Woolrich, the film is brilliantly directed by Argentine filmmaker Carlos Hugo Christensen with extraordinary cinematography by Pablo Tabernero. ORDER YOUR COPY\n\nSays FNF founder Eddie Muller about this recent restoration, âIt is a revelation to experience the work of an all-American author, in Spanish, and rendered as well â or perhaps better â than any Hollywood adaptation of his work.â\n\nOriginally a three-part anthology of Woolrich tales,Â Never Open That DoorÂ was released separately from the 73-minute filmÂ If I Should Die Before I Wake (Si muero antes de despertar)Â adapted by screenwriter Alejandro Casona and Christensen. An exceedingly rare archival conservation scan ofÂ If I Should Die Before I WakeÂ is featured in this publication.Â\n\nBONUS MATERIALS INCLUDE:\n\nâ½ Introduction by author, film historian, and \"noirchaeologist\" Eddie Muller\n\nâ½ Audio commentary by author and film historian Guido Segal\n\nâ½ New documentary on Cornell Woolrich\n\nâ½ Newly recorded conversation - with Argentina's leading film archivist and cinema historian Fernando MartÃ­n PeÃ±a\n\nBlu‑ray/DVD of FNF restoration available\n\nArgentine director RomÃ¡n ViÃ±oly Barreto's El vampiro negro (The Black Vampire) is available from Flicker Alley in a deluxe Blu‑ray/DVD edition. A virtually unknown remake of Fritz Lang's seminal 1931 thriller M, this 1953 Argentine noir is a female-centered take on the tale. + READ MORE\n\nOlga Zubarry stars as a cabaret performer trying to protect her young daughter (GogÃ³) from a mysterious murderer while parrying the advances of the prosecutor (Roberto Escalada) pursuing the killer. NathÃ¡n PinzÃ³n, who also appeared in ViÃ±oly Barreto's The Beast Must Die (La bestia debe morir) a year earlier, gives an impressive against-type performance as the disturbed pedophile hiding in plain sight.\n\nThanks to the diligent efforts of the Film Noir Foundation and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Charitable Trust, a stunning restoration of the film was created by UCLA Film & Television Archive and is being presented in its first-ever U.S. home-video release â with special thanks to Fernando MartÃ­n PeÃ±a and Argentina Sono Film.\n\nBonus materials include:\n\nâ½ Introduction to El vampiro negro â by author, film historian and \"noirchaeologist\" Eddie Muller\n\nâ½ The 3 Faces of \"M\" â a critical comparison of the three versions of M, produced by Steven C. Smith and writer/film historian Alan K. Rode, and featuring interviews with writer/film historian Imogen Sara Smith, biographer Patrick McGilligan, biographer Stephen Youngkin, film critic Beth Accomando, Eddie Muller, and Alan K.

Dark City expands with new chapters and a fresh collection of restored photos that illustrate the mythic landscape of the imagination. It's a place where the men and women who created film noir often find themselves dangling from the same sinister heights as the silver-screen characters to whom they gave life.\n\nMuller guides fans on a spellbinding trip through treacherous terrain: Hollywood in the post-WWII years, where art, politics, scandal, styleâand brilliant craftsmanshipâproduced a new approach to moviemaking, and a new type of cultural lore. This journey hits all the finer neighborhoods: Shamus Flats, Vixenville, Blind Alley, Losers' Laneâwith stops at The Precinct, The Psych Ward, The Big House, and other dank corners, with shady protagonists ready to spill their bitter life story before retreating to the shadows. ↑ COLLAPSE\n\nCome follow us on Tumblr to indulge your passion for noir! We'll be posting daily, celebrating all things noir with exclusive stills and images you won't see anywhere else, as well as trailers, film clips, and more.\n\nShare our posts with your friends; your love of the art form is the Foundation's biggest asset in its mission to preserve and restore classics of the genre.
