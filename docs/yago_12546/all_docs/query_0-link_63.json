        "text": "The 2020 incarnation of the world’s most popular Film Noir festival, Noir City, is returning to the legendary SIFF Cinema Egyptian February 14 through 20 for a weeklong excursion into darkness hosted by Eddie Muller, internationally renowned “Czar of Noir” and host of the popular Turner Classic Movies series “Noir Alley.”\n\nThe festival presents 20 classic films from around the globe, a wide-ranging, thematically cohesive immersion into a sordid world of sinister and sexy affairs—including neon-streaked alleys of Japanese yakuza thrillers, the stylish Parisian underworld, Italian palazzos hiding crimes of every social strata, a Kafkaesque Prague as envisioned by the Czech New Wave—even a rare serial killer film set in Nazi Germany made by Hollywood’s finest director of film noir, Robert Siodmak.\n\nOur Valentine’s Day Opening Night program starts off big with the Ben Thomas Trio performing sultry tango music setting the mood for two brand new restorations from Argentina, The Beast Must Die (1952) and The Black Vampire (1953) both by acclaimed Argentine director Román Viñoly Barreto. The restorations were completed in 2019 by the Film Noir Foundation’s (FNF) preservation partner, UCLA Film & Television Archive, with support provided from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s Charitable Trust (The HFPA Trust).\n\nFor veteran cinephiles, this year’s Noir City is a chance to again experience cherished cinematic masterpieces in a bona fide movie palace, including several films presented in glorious 35mm. For those just starting their cinematic journey, it’s the perfect introduction to a wide world of international filmmakers and stars, on the big screen, larger than life. Tour guides include some of the world’s most revered filmmakers: Julien Duvivier, Jean-Pierre Melville, Jirí Weiss, Kim Ki-young, and Masahiro Shinoda.\n\nIn addition to films, trivia, and nightly prizes, we are partnering with KNKX to present the Dmitri Matheny Group on Closing Night, playing noir jazz with an international flare.\n\nStan Shields, SIFF Festival Programming Manager, says, “We are excited to bring Noir City back to SIFF Cinema Egyptian again this year. Audiences will be treated to rare, hard-to-find noir gems, and there is no better venue to experience these powerful international contributions to film noir.”\n\nSIFF Artistic Director Beth Barrett puts it all in perspective; “SIFF and the Film Noir Foundation have been partnering for years to support the restoration of noir films, and bring this artistically and culturally important genre to SIFF audiences,” adding,”What makes this partnership so special is Eddie. Eddie Muller is our fabulous guide, giving audiences a treasure map to a cache of films that might otherwise go unseen and unappreciated.”\n\nNOIR CITY 2020 LINEUP\n\nFriday, February 14\n\nThe Beast Must Die | La bestia debe morir (35mm) FILM NOIR FOUNDATION RESTORATION\n\nA writer adopts a new identity to track down the hit-and-run driver who killed his son in this tense adaptation of Nicholas Blake’s landmark 1936 novel.
