Date: 11/18/2022\n\nUPC: 617311688195\n\nEl Vampiro Negro (The Black Vampire) (2pc) (W/Dvd)\n\nArtist: RomÃ¡n ViÃ±oly Barreto\n\nFormat: Blu-Ray\n\nNew: Available $42.23\n\nWish\n\nFormats and Editions\n\nMore Info:\n\nA virtually unknown remake of M, Fritz Lang's seminal 1931 thriller, El vampiro negro (The Black Vampire) is a revisionist take on the tale by Argentine director RomÃ¡n ViÃ±oly Barreto. Thanks to the diligent efforts of the Film Noir Foundation, a stunning restoration of the film was created by UCLA Film & Television Archive, now presented in it's first-ever home video release - with special thanks to Fernando MartÃ­n PeÃ±a and Argentina Sono Film.Argentine beauty Olga Zubarry stars as a cabaret performer trying to protect her young daughter (GogÃ³) from a mysterious murderer while parrying the advances of the prosecutor (Roberto Escalada) pursuing the killer. NathÃ¡n PinzÃ³n, who also appeared in ViÃ±oly Barreto's The Beast Must Die (La bestia debe morir) a year earlier, gives an impressive against-type performance as the disturbed pedophile hiding in plain sight.This variation on Fritz Lang's classic is a proto-feminist reimagining of the tale, focusing on the lives of female characters ignored in the earlier iterations. The film's brooding cinematography (by AnÃ­bal GonzÃ¡lez Paz) enhances Olga Zubarry's exceptional performance, which won her the Argentine Film Critics Association award for Best Actress. El vampiro negro (The Black Vampire) is a significant rediscovery in cinema history, and, thanks to the dedication of the Film Noir Foundation and it's partners at UCLA Film & Television Archive, it is now available in a beautiful Blu-ray/DVD dual-format edition packed with special features."
