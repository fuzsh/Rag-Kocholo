        "text": "Kicking off a busy last week of 2021 for Cinecaps Digest is this latest batch of foreign film reviews. The usual wide variety of subjects, genres, countries/languages, and calibers. Hope you like subtitles; I sure do—I even turn them on when I’m watching a movie in my native language. But, as I said, it’s going to be a busy week, so there’s no time to waste.\n\nDer Junge Törless (1966)\n\nDirected by Volker Schlöndorff. Starring Mathieu Carrière, Fred Dietz, Bernd Tischer, Marian Seidowsky, Jean Launay, Barbara Steele, Lotte Ledl.\n\nThis coy, remote New German Cinema drama meditating on the corruption of youth takes place in an Austrian boarding school several years before the outbreak of the Great War. Carrière’s titular student is a conflicted yet largely passive observer to the sadistic punishments inflicted by other boys onto a classmate who was caught stealing. Avoids sensationalism to make its point—despite the seething undercurrent of violence and homoeroticism (and suggestions of worse), it’s in no way exciting or emotionally manipulative. But the austerity of its philosophical perversions results in an unnecessarily oblique study without a galvanizing central figure, and the parallels to the later rise of Nazi Germany leave little for the viewer to reflect on and debate. Franz Rath’s black & white photography and Hans Werner Henze’s score both serve the film’s bleak, introspective mood. Director Schlöndorff’s first feature film; he also co-scripted from Robert Musil’s novel, “The Confusions of Young Törless.”\n\n67/100\n\nHiroshima Mon Amour (1959)\n\nDirected by Alain Resnais. Starring Emmanuelle Riva, Eiji Okada, Bernard Fresson.\n\nInfluential classic from the early days of the French New Wave is post-modern in technique and contrapuntal in rhythm, chronicling an experience and a painful reawakening, fusing the persistent memory of a romance gone wrong to the soul-scarred reconstruction of the devastated title city. Visiting French actress Elle (Riva) has a dalliance with Japanese architect Lui (Okada), but they are burdened by troubled pasts tied to the war and heartbreak. The film opens with an image of (unknown) writhing naked bodies in embrace, glistening with radioactive dust, an innovative way to suggest the intertwined nature of its varying themes of past and present, war and peace, intimacy and shame, atrocity and identity. Can’t avoid meandering down some nonlinear pretentious avenues—parody spoils invention, n’est-ce pas?—even though its most hypnotic passage is the arty documentary-style prologue that practically sweats the cologne of student film clichés. Feature film debut for both director Resnais and actress Riva.\n\n87/100\n\nLa Bestia Debe Morir (1952)\n\nDirected by Román Viñoly Barreto. Starring Narciso Ibáñez Menta, Laura Hidalgo, Guillermo Battaglia, Beba Bidart, Ernesto Bianco, Milagros de la Vega, Nathán Pinzón, Josefa Goldar, Jesús Pampín, Humberto Balado, Gloria Ferrandiz, Eduardo Moyano.\n\nLittle-seen Argentine mystery noir, adapted from Nicholas Blake’s highly-regarded novel, “The Beast Must Die” (the English translation of the film’s title), uses an adventurous plot structure to show how and why writer Menta seeks revenge on a man he does not even know—“I am going to kill a man. I don’t know his name, I don’t know where he lives, I have no idea what he looks like. But I am going to find him and kill him.” Such fiery, high-strung melodrama is to be expected from the country of the production’s origin, which is what makes Menta’s more understated work so compelling in contrast to the frantic performances surrounding him, including one of those not-quite-femme–fatale love interest roles for Hidalgo; on the overheated front, however, Battaglia’s despicable antagonist and his vicious mother (de la Vega) have their deliciously effective moments. Menta co-wrote the screenplay adaptation with director Barreto, who, in turn, co-produced with Hidalgo. As for the novelist, Blake, that was a pseudonym for Cecil Day-Lewis, dad to Daniel. Later filmed by Claude Chabrol as Que la Bête Meure in 1969, and turned into a limited TV series in 2021.\n\n77/100\n\nLola (1961)\n\nDirected by Jacques Demy. Starring Marc Michel, Anouk Aimée, Alan Scott, Elina Labourdette, Annie Duperoux, Jacques Harden, Margo Lion.\n\nDemy’s first film, a tribute to Max Ophüls, builds an indolent fantasy world version of coastal France in which blasé Roland (Michel) reconnects with his titular ex-flame (Aimée), now a cabaret dancer, after a chance encounter; she still pines for a former lover (Harden) who knocked her up years ago, while an American (Scott) struggles with his unreciprocated lust for her, but c’est la vie. Residing on the feathery fringes of the French New Wave, Demy’s style and atmosphere are well-regulated, and there are moments of bliss that commingle with moments of ennui in delightful ways, but the airy sentiment needs more flavorful, robustly-defined characters to skate through such wispily-manufactured, idealized predicaments. Aimée’s charms and screen presence negate her shortcomings as an actress, but the men are all carved out of basswood. The first chapter of a loose “trilogy” of films from Demy (followed by The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort); Michel would go on to reprise his same role in the first of those.\n\n66/100\n\nThe Man Who Sold His Skin (2021)\n\nDirected by Kaouther Ben Hania. Starring Yahya Mahayni, Monica Bellucci, Dea Liane, Koen De Bouw, Saad Lostain, Darina Al Joundi, Christian Vadim.\n\nA skin-deep drama that plays out like a dead-serious cultural satire, which means it’s too exaggerated to absorb with sober attention, and too coldly self-serious to enjoy as tragic camp. Mahayni’s Syrian refugee becomes a living canvas for an avant-garde European artist (De Bouw), a cause célèbre that turns him into a priceless commodity. Provocative without ever really being challenging, it makes valid but shopworn points about immigration, displacement, human dignity, racial prejudice, classism, and the pretentiousness of the art community, but it repeats these points without enough variation or escalation analogous to the protagonist’s plight. The other primary narrative thread—Mahayni trying to reunite with the woman (Liane) that he loves and who has been forced by her family to marry a wealthy wretch—isn’t interwoven so much as forced, most likely as a tactic to inspire more sympathy for the refugee’s peculiar and unfortunate misery. A pedantic lecture without a hero worth rooting for, it’s not worth more than a passing glance at an underground gallery. Inspired in a secondhand fashion by a Roald Dahl short story, “Skin.” The first movie from Tunisia ever nominated for the Best Foreign Film/International Feature Academy Award.\n\n39/100\n\nMitt Liv Som Hund (1985)\n\nDirected by Lasse Hallström. Starring Anton Glanzelius, Tomas von Brömssen, Melinda Kinnaman, Ing-Marie Carlsson, Anki Lidén, Kicki Rundgren, Lennart Hjulström, Didrik Gustavsson, Magnus Rask, Manfred Serner.\n\nKnowing, sensitive coming-of-age tale set in 1950s Sweden sees twelve-year-old Ingemar (Glanzelius) being separated from his older brother and sent off to live with relatives as his mother (Lidén) wastes away from tuberculosis. Coming to terms with that tragedy, along with the excitement and confusion of sexual awakening (with feisty tomboy Kinnaman), drives the relaxed and quietly observant narrative, but it’s a journey of emotional discoveries more than one of crucial incidents (though there’s no shortage of minor adventures). While not original or distinctive enough to separate itself from the developmental pack, and the adult perceptions of this untamed youth have an air of forced idiosyncrasy, it’s a low-key charmer with spontaneous moments of inspiration that temporarily raise the spirit. Feature film breakthrough for Hallström (better known then for directing a slew of music videos for pop group ABBA), even earning a surprise Oscar nomination for Best Director. English title translation: My Life As a Dog.\n\n81/100\n\nNo Regrets for Our Youth (1946)\n\nDirected by Akira Kurosawa. Starring Setsuko Hara, Susumu Fujita, Denjirô Ôkôchi, Eiko Miyoshi, Kokuten Kôdô, Haruko Sugimura, Akitake Kôno, Takashi Shimura, Masao Shimizu, Taizô Fukami.\n\nPost-war examination of pre-war persecution witnesses the gradual maturation of self-involved student Hara, drawn to a progressive radical (Fujita) whose viewpoints land him in hot water with the fascist government. Kurosawa tackles difficult subject matter with crudely flowing austerity and noble intentions, stirring passions in a sincere yet naturalistic fashion. The feminist perspective is a refreshing one, but an air of preachiness stifles the narrative at multiple turns, and a fascination with heavy-handed symbolism makes it sometimes feel like an early experiment begging for the same reflective self-actualization experienced by the protagonist. Performances trend toward the positive side, even if several of the supporting characters (the parental figures especially) are representative of social hierarchy types more than flesh-and-blood individuals—the point is made, then made again, and again. Inspired by the story of Hotsumi Ozaki, a Japanese journalist who was executed for treason during World War II. Went unreleased in the US for more than 35 years.\n\n67/100\n\nQuo Vadis, Aida? (2021)\n\nDirected by Jasmila Žbanić. Starring Jasna Đuričić, Johan Heldenbergh, Izudin Bajrović, Boris Isaković, Raymond Thiry, Reinout Bussemaker, Boris Ler, Dino Bajrović, Jelena Kordić-Kuret, Juda Goslinga, Ermin Bravo.\n\nTrenchant, heartbreaking document of institutional impotence, bureaucratic disregard, and the callous evil that can spread like a cancer under such conditions. The Bosnian War was covered on a world stage, yet it was considered too complex for in-depth analysis at the time, and was largely greeted by international inaction, exemplified most clearly by the failures of the UN to intervene and back up their feeble threats. Quo Vadis, Aida? (which translates as “Where Are You Going, Aida?”) does what all effective depictions of genocide must do: put human faces onto numbers. No face is more human (and frustrated, desperate, panicked, devastated…) than Aida’s (Đuričić), a translator trying to save her family by facilitating communication between UN forces and the Bosnian Serb Army on the eve of the Srebrenica massacre. The chaos, fear, and inevitable tragedy of the situation should have made the film almost unbearable to watch, but writer/director/co-producer Žbanić enriches the unfolding nightmare with so much tension and suspense, and Đuričić develops her humanist rooting interest into a such a compassionate and deeply-felt individual, that it becomes too riveting to look away. Falters with the ambiguous ending, which becomes so elusive as to possibly suggest a measure of discordant redemption, but the filmmakers may have at least intended it to be interpreted differently. Premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2020.\n\n89/100\n\nRoma (2018)\n\nDirected by Alfonso Cuarón. Starring Yalitza Aparicio, Marina de Tavira, Jorge Antonio Guerrero, Nancy García, Fernando Grediaga, Marco Grag, Diego Cortina Demesa, Daniela Demesa, Carlos Peralta, Verónica García. [R]\n\nBrotman’s Law states that “if nothing has happened by the end of the first reel, nothing is going to happen.” Roma goes through several reels without anything particularly interesting happening. But patient viewers who stick with the “beautiful bore” that is the first hour are rewarded with the intimate and heartbreaking chronicle of Cleo (Aparicio), a live-in maid working for a family in Mexico City. She demonstrates resilience through grace, no matter the dire circumstance (including being impregnated by a boyfriend who threatens her harm if she insists that the child is his), her emotional turbulence expressed assuredly through the suffocating restrictions of class, heritage, and morality. Writer/director Cuarón pulled the story and feelings from his own memories growing up in Mexico City, and regardless of how certain plot turns may appear at a glance to be contrived, like the identity of a gunman that Cleo encounters during the Corpus Christi Massacre, it almost never feels anything less than utterly authentic and deeply personal. Cuarón picked up two Oscar statuettes from AMPAS (for his direction and his lensing), and unofficially picked up a third when the film also won for Best Foreign Language Film, which, weirdly, is kept by the director but is “given” to the country as a whole.\n\n86/100\n\nThe Square (2017)\n\nDirected by Ruben Östlund. Starring Claes Bang, Elisabeth Moss, Christopher Læssø, Dominic West, Daniel Hallberg, Martin Sööder, Terry Notary, Marina Schiptjenko. [R]\n\nUsing arty pomposity as a vessel for winking criticism on class conflict, The Square has a point of view, but it’s one that’s surface deep and blinkered within the context of the unfocused satire that the filmmakers are spinning. Though unafraid to meander down tangents that parody performance art, sexual paranoia, and so on, the central thrust shows Swedish museum curator Bang trying to drum up some publicity for a sterile, socially-minded new art exhibit called The Square (“The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring; within it, we all share equal rights and obligations”), but after carelessly signing off on a social media promotional video from an outside marketing agency, controversy comes a-calling. It’s easy to undress the cryptic language and slick clichés found in this kind of world (and, more specifically, those who populate it, none more so than the well-heeled ringmaster), but as much as it recognizes why its targets deserve some measure of counterpoint examination or ridicule, it prefers a sledgehammer approach that never breaks through to the next layer, and the periodic lunges into bathos throw off the rhythms as soon as they’re established. The vignettes feed off each other elliptically, which is a shame, because taken piecemeal, there are several almost perversely absorbing moments and pointed observations, even if some of them ultimately lead to dead-ends. Palme d’Or winner at Cannes. Writer/director Östlund also co-edited.\n\n59/100\n\nStalker (1979)\n\nDirected by Andrei Tarkovsky. Starring Alexander Kaidanovsky, Anatoly Solonitsyn, Nikolai Grinko, Alisa Freindlich, Natasha Abramova.\n\nVery loosely based on an Arkady-Boris Strugatsky novella (“Roadside Picnic”) and indistinctly set in an unnamed country sometime in the not-so-distant future, Tartovsky’s timeless and inaccessible science fiction film tells the story of three men venturing into a restricted, inexplicably miraculous piece of land known as “The Zone” to a place called “The Room,” which has the capacity to make a visitor’s true, subconscious desires come true. Long, dense, meditative, willfully oblique, and extremely slow-moving, it’s too eerie and hypnotic to ever become so dull as to sever interest for any viewer willing to submit to its spell, but the allegory of faith and consciousness does provide a challenge, the rewards of which are as bleak as they are magnanimous. Like the “Stalker” protagonist, the determination of hope flows as powerfully as the weight of despair, and his dialogue contains far more ambling parables than concise conversation, but the three chief actors each do fine work creating unequivocal characters (the others being the apprehensive Writer and the fanatical Professor) that all speak and move in the same dazed, dreamlike droning. Sound design and avant garde music combined with the abstruse lensing (long takes, mostly medium and wide shots, sepia-toned monochrome for scenes shot outside of “The Zone”) have a mesmeric effect. The interior of the Zone was inspired by the abandoned and polluted stretch of land outside Chelyabinsk following a nuclear accident.\n\n88/100\n\nTie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990)\n\nDirected by Pedro Almodóvar. Starring Victoria Abril, Antonio Banderas, Loles León, Francisco Rabal, Julieta Serrano, Rossy de Palma, Francisca Caballero, María Barranco, Lola Cardona. [NC-17]\n\nAfter getting released from a mental asylum, unhinged Banderas tracks down Marina (Abril), an ex-porn star and recovering addict with whom he once had sex. He forces his way into her apartment, smacks her around, and ties her to the bed, insistent that he can make her fall in love with him. Another one of Almodóvar’s early-career outings designed to be provocative and stir up controversy, far higher on camp and shock value than humanity or wit. To call it psychologically dubious would be akin to saying that it’s a bit on the misogynistic side, but it’s the overall naïvety and failure to find a strong center that come up most wanting, resulting in some well-timed laughs, a few engagingly nutty performances, and crisp photography courtesy of José Luis Alcaine that all go quickly forgotten. Really, the only bits that linger do so solely for their brazen silliness, like the scuba diver sex toy or some lengthy and explicit rumpy-pumpy in the throes of captivity. Ennio Morricone’s melancholy music has some allure, but it strikes familiar chords in his repertoire. Initially released without an MPAA rating to avoid the stigma of an X certification, but later re-rated under the newly-created NC-17 for its home video release. Original Spanish title: ¡Átame!\n\n56/100\n\nTitane (2021)\n\nDirected by Julia Ducournau. Starring Agathe Rousselle, Vincent Lindon, Laïs Salameh, Bertrant Bonello, Myriem Akheddiou, Garance Marillier, Adèle Guigue, Thibault Cathalifaud. [R]\n\nBrash, bizarre nightmare fabricated as a polyphonic surge of violence, eroticism, gender-bending, family dysfunction, and body horror; despite numerous foundational influences/references—as varied as David Cronenberg’s Crash and Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby—it emerges as a subversive original that falls short of its own challenge when all is said and done. In a story that defies terse description, a car exhibition showgirl (Rousselle) with a titanium plate in her head (who also happens to be a serial killer) gets impregnated with some metallic, motor oil-oozing monstrosity after fornicating with a car. To evade authorities, she alters her appearance to pass herself off as the long-missing and now-grown son of an emotionally-disturbed, steroid-addled fire captain (Lindon), who doesn’t retreat even after it becomes clear she is not who she claims to be. Ruben Impens’ color-saturated neo-noir photography, Ducournau’s confident and malleable direction (showing just enough discretion so that the system shocks don’t always come off as gratuitous), and two central performances as precise as they are ambiguous make it worth seeking out for the adventurous; timid or conservative viewers need not apply. Yet for all of its aggrandized goals interpreted through the queasy sadomasochism and outlandish biomechanical associations, nothing new is actually being suggested about body autonomy or trans acceptance. The provocations of its stretched flesh eventually tear away to reveal cold, shiny truths that could be plucked from the shelves of any auto parts store. Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes.\n\n66/100\n\nCheck back tomorrow for the next update!"
