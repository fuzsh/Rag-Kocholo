        "text": "When Basilio and his mother Inés understand that they are dead, they decide to embark on a physical and spiritual journey through a landscape devastated by war. All of this was provoked by Basilio, who was a criminal when he was alive and who is now forced to relive endlessly all those acts with his mother as a witness. It is only through great sacrifices that they will achieve the redemption they long for, which will allow them to discover the true value of life in this land where all hope seems to be lost.\n\nCésar Augusto Acevedo is the director and screenwriter of the first and only Colombian film to receive the Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, Land & Shade (2015) and which had its World Premiere at the 54th Semaine de La Critique.
