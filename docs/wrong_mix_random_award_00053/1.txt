February 2024 Obituaries

William A. “Bill” Weiblen, P.E., ASME Past President (2001-2002) and former member of the Board of Governors (1996-1999), died peacefully with family present on February 27, 2024, in his hometown of Avon, Conn., at the age of 85.

As an Honorary Member of the Society, Bill was recognized for his extraordinary leadership, versatility, dedication, and service, which had an enduring impact on ASME as well as Pratt & Whitney, his former employer of 38 years. During his years at P&W he had the opportunity to work on every commercial and military jet engine model the company produced, as well as some of its rocket engines. Among his many positions of responsibility, Weiblen was named manager of new products and processes and was tasked with making operational a paperless work management system he conceived and oversaw the development of. When placed in operation following his retirement in 1999, the system provided the company with an annual savings of $900,000.

Weiblen was an ASME Life Fellow and had been an active member of the Society for over six decades. He served on the Fellows Review Committee (2008-2013) and the Manufacturing Engineering Division's Honor Committee (2003-2009). He was past chair (2008-2011) of the VOLT (Volunteer Orientation and Leadership Training) Academy, which he founded in 2004 as a resource to develop the leadership skills of future Society leaders. He also served on the Council on Member Affairs, ASME Foundation Board of Directors, and Committee of Past Presidents.

As ASME's 120th president, Weiblen demonstrated outstanding leadership in getting a number of longstanding operational issues resolved and set the stage for a review of the Society's operational structure. Following the completion of his term, his talents were utilized by subsequent presidents through leadership positions on task forces and committees, which have had a profound impact on the organization.

Weiblen received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Maine, Orono, and earned master's degrees in mechanical engineering and business administration at the University of Connecticut, Storrs. He was a registered professional engineer in Connecticut.

Winfred “Win” Phillips, ASME Past President (1998–1999) and former member of the Board of Governors (1994–1998) died on Feb. 24, 2024, in Gainesville, Fla., at the age of 83.

Phillips was a longtime leader at the University of Florida (UF) in Gainesville, where he served on the faculty since 1988. He joined UF as dean and professor of mechanical engineering and research professor of bioengineering. During his career, Phillips taught a wide range of fluid mechanics courses related to aerodynamics and biological fluid flow. His research helped pave the way for biomedical engineering to be a highly respected activity within mechanical engineering. He authored or co-authored nearly 200 technical publications and was frequently sought as a seminar speaker and consultant.

Phillips served as senior vice president and chief operating officer from 2011 to 2014. In 2014, he became senior advisor to the president. He became executive chief of staff in 2015, a role he maintained until his retirement in June 2023.

A Fellow of ASME, Phillips was actively involved in the Society since joining in 1974. Among his leadership roles, he served as senior vice president and chair of the Council on Education, chaired the Committee Consolidation Task Force, and served on numerous other committees, including the Bioengineering Division’s Papers Review Committee, the Central Pennsylvania Section Executive Committee, chair of the Task Force on Globalization, and was a member of the Council on Competitiveness. He served as chair of the steering committee for ASME’s Global Summit on the Future of Mechanical Engineering and was a trustee of the ASME Foundation.

Phillips was a recipient of the ASME Dedicated Service Award and the Ralph Coats Roe Medal. He served on the board of directors for SECME, formerly the Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering, a strategic alliance of school systems and engineering universities working to increase the number of underserved youths pursuing studies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Phillips received his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, and his master’s degree and D.Sc. in aerospace engineering at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville.

Phillips’ wife, Betty Phillips, a former faculty member and provost at UF, died in 2017. He is survived by two sons from an earlier marriage, Stephen and Sean; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

January 2024 Obituaries

Nancy DeLoye Fitzroy passed away on Jan. 15, 2024, in Schenectady, N.Y. at the age of 96. In 1986, she became the first female president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers— the first woman to head a major engineering society.

Fitzroy was an exceptional engineer, pilot, and charismatic person. Her contributions in the heat transfer field have led to improvements in space reentry vehicles (heat shields), nuclear submarines and reactors (cooling systems and shielding), steam and gas turbines for electric power generation, and heat transfer physics.

She held the distinction of being the first woman to graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) with a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering and also received a doctorate from RPI. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory hired her in 1959, where she worked as an assistant engineer with the heat transfer group.

In 1952, she became a development engineer for the General Electric Company (GE), initially working on the Hermes Missile Program. Fitzroy would remain with GE for the next 37 years. Fitzroy, particularly in her early years at the company, had to overcome a variety of obstacles, hardships, and prejudices because she was a woman at a company mostly staffed by men. While at GE she met her future husband Roland Victor Fitzroy, Jr. The couple married in 1951 and married for 53 years until Roland's passing.

Fitzroy was one of the first female helicopter pilots, and both she and her husband enjoyed flying, sailing, skiing, and traveling. In 2011, ASME established the Nancy DeLoye Fitzroy and Roland V. Fitzroy Medal for pioneering contributions to the frontiers of engineering, leading to breakthroughs in existing technology or new applications or new areas of engineering endeavors.

Fitzroy was an Honorary Member of ASME, an Honorary Fellow of Britain's Institution of Mechanical Engineers, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and is a member of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Hall of Fame. Fitzroy was an early advocate of engineering workforce diversity and her tireless efforts to promote the role of women and minorities in technology influenced other ASME presidents. She was a leading influence in the creation of the ASME Board on Minorities and Women.

Fitzroy was a resident of Niskayuna, N.Y. and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was the youngest of six children born in Pittsfield, Mass.

September 2023 Obituaries

We are sad to announce that on September 28, 2023 we had to say goodbye to Eugene Phillip Janikowski (Hales Corners, Wisconsin).

Gene, as his friends knew him, obtained his bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. He was a registered professional engineer in the State of Wisconsin.

He retired from a career at C&D Technologies, where he was a ISO9000 auditor and achieved the status of certified Six Sigma Blackbelt—a methodology that utilizes statistical tools and concepts to identify variations or defects in a process.

Gene was a Life Member of ASME, joining the Society in 1975. He was a long-time active and valued member of the Milwaukee Section of ASME, serving for a time as its Vice Chairman.

He is survived by his wife Patrica; his children, Jennifer Eggert (Curt) and Jim Janikowski; his grandson Michael Eggert; and his sisters, Madelyn Boisvert (Gerry) and Judy Heinricks. He is also survived by nieces, nephews, cousins, other relatives and friends.

Visitation was held October 3, 2023 at the St. Mary Catholic Faith Community Church (9520 W Forest Home Ave, Hales Corners, WI 53130) followed by a mass of Christian burial.

In lieu of flowers, memorials to Zilber Family Hospice or the American Cancer Society appreciated.

August 2023 Obituaries

Bryan A. Erler, P.E., ASME Past President (2020-2021) and former member of the Board of Governors, passed away on August 27, 2023, in Tucson, Arizona after a brief illness. He was 76 years old.

Known by all as the ultimate optimist, Bryan's enthusiasm, humor, kindness, and expertise will be missed by his family members, colleagues, and friends.

Bryan grew up in Northbrook, Illinois, going on to earn both his undergraduate and master’s degree in civil engineering from Purdue University. He also graduated from the Business Executive Program at the University of Michigan.

Erler had been an executive and expert in the nuclear power industry for over four decades with significant leadership roles and responsibilities in the designing of electric power plants. In 1970, he joined Sargent & Lundy Engineers LLC, retiring in 2003 as an owner and senior vice president. He went on to establish Erler Engineering, Ltd., where he continued to provide consulting to nuclear power projects globally.

Bryan was an ASME Fellow and had been an active member of the Society since 1991. He held a number of leadership positions including participation on various ASME codes and standards committees, vice president of ASME’s Nuclear Codes & Standards, past chair of the Board of Nuclear Codes and Standards, and chair of ASME’s Boiler & Pressure Vessel Section III Division 2. He also served a term as the Society’s secretary/treasurer.

Dedicated to his profession and with a willingness to share his expertise, talents and enthusiasm, Bryan worked with several non-profit organizations including LeaderShape, an organization that helps college students and early career professionals develop leadership skills by providing training to promising young adults to help them learn to lead with integrity and achieve success.

Over the years he served as trustee of Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago, co-chair of the Purdue President's Council, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois, and treasurer of LeaderShape. He was recognized as a Distinguished Engineering Alumnus of Purdue University and was a recipient of the ASME Dedicated Service Award and the ASME Bernard F. Langer Nuclear Codes & Standards Award.

Bryan was an enthusiastic traveler and an avid golfer and skier. Those interests were driven by the opportunity they provided to spend time with family and friends. Shared meals, with Bryan often serving as chef, were treasured occasions.

Bryan Erler is survived by his beloved wife of 55 years, Susan (Crews) and his adored daughters and sons-in-law, Nancy and Jamie Luppes and Jennifer and Eric Arnquist. He was proud Papa to Colin Luppes and Elizabeth and Nicholas Arnquist. He is also survived by his siblings Bruce, Sharon and Glenn Erler, in-laws Martha and Jim Schmidt, and treasured nieces and nephews.

March 2023 Obituaries

Richard Goldstein J. Ph.D., P.E., ASME Past President (1996-1997), former member of the Board of Governors (1993-1996), and a member of the ASME Committee on Finance (2004-2013) passed away on March 6, 2023, in Golden Valley, Minn., at the age of 94.

A renowned mechanical engineer and academic, Dr. Goldstein’s contributions to heat transfer measurement techniques and film cooling led to improved efficiency in gas turbines and many other thermal systems.

Goldstein joined ASME in 1952, and was the recipient of Dedicated Service Award, the ASME Medal, the Heat Transfer Memorial Award, and was an Honorary Member. In 2019, ASME established the Richard J. Goldstein Energy Lecture Award, to recognize pioneering contributions to the frontiers of energy leading to breakthroughs in existing technology, new applications, new areas of engineering endeavor, or policy initiatives.

Goldstein was born in New York City on March 27, 1928, and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1944. He received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University (1948) and went on to complete his M.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Physics from the University of Minnesota. He joined Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a Development Engineer in 1951, serving afterward in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant.

Goldstein later returned to the University of Minnesota and received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and joined the University’s faculty in 1961. Dr. Goldstein served as a professor, researcher, and department head in the coming years and was named James J. Ryan and Regents’ Professor Emeritus of the Heat Transfer Laboratory in the mechanical engineering department.

During his more than 65-year academic career, Dr. Goldstein’s work was presented in more than 300 publications and his books, including two on Fluid mechanics measurements, as well as his many fundamentals and applications-oriented research papers, continue to be foundational for engineering students.

Some of his proudest work was creating opportunities for others. He advised 74 doctoral and 82 master’s students, and many visiting and postdoctoral scholars. He directed the development of an outstanding teaching, research, and service-oriented program at the University, which was ranked in the highest echelons of ME departments around the world.

Dick loved black coffee, the Minnesota Vikings, the theater, classical music, traveling with his children, and chasing solar eclipses. His passion for engineering and education provided lifelong energy and inspiration.

He is predeceased by his wife, Barbara. Survived by his former wife, Nancy, and their children, Arthur, Jonathan (Robbin), Ben (Barbara) and Naomi (Luis); grandsons, David and Emmett; and sister, Carol.

February 2023 - Obituaries

Ernest Daman L. ASME Past President (1988-1989), and Honorary Member of the Society, died on Feb. 25, 2023, in Vero Beach, Fla., at the age of 99.

He joined ASME in 1947 and was an active member of the Society for many years.

Through the years, Daman, a Fellow of ASME and a recipient of the Dedicated Service Award, served on many ASME committees and boards including the Committee of Past Presidents, the Committee on Government Relations, the Planning Committee for Codification Standardization Research, the ASME Industry Advisory Board, and chair of the ASME Committee on Honors, among others.

Daman was born in Hanover, Germany, before his family moved to Sao Paulo, Brazil where he went to the American School. He attended boarding school at Hof Oberkirch in Kaltbrunn, Switzerland, and also attended Friends Academy on Long Island in New York.

Ernie, as he was often called, went to college at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, now New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering, where he graduated with a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering.

His first job out of college was with Foster Wheeler Corp. where he eventually became senior vice president and remained with the company until his retirement, except for two years working in the White House during the Clinton administration, where he was the first state-federal technology executive in the office of science and technology.

Daman was multilingual and spoke English, German, French and Portuguese. He taught himself to sail and at every opportunity sailed the waters of Martha’s Vineyard on his boat, Therapy. He was an avid golfer, which he took up in his 70s, and was a former member of the Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, Mass., which he considered his second home. He also was a fierce tennis player and skier.

Daman proudly served in the U.S. Army in the Pacific Theater and received the Bronze Star.

He is survived by his loving wife Gail; his children Diane and her husband Mike, Cyndee and her husband Gary, and daughter-in-law Cindy, who was married to his son Bruce (now deceased); five grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

Keith B. Thayer, P.E., ASME Past President (1997-1998), former member of the Board of Governors, and an Honorary Member of the Society, died on February 14, 2023, in Sugar Land, TX at the age of 95.

A member of the Society since 1950, he was a Life Fellow and had served on numerous committees and groups in the Petroleum Division in the South Texas Section and at the Society level. He was chair of the Petroleum Division’s executive committee (1984-85); chaired and worked on the National Agenda Committee and Workbook Committee, among others within the South Texas Section. He also directed the section’s Emerging Leadership program from 1976 to 1977.

Thayer served on several Society-level committees and was elected to the ASME Board of Governors in 1992. Among his honors, he was a recipient of the ASME Centennial Award, Dedicated Service Award, and the ASME International Petroleum Technology Institute’s 2007 ASME Exceptional Volunteer Award. In 2009, IPTI named an award in his honor: the Keith Thayer Exceptional Early Career Engineer Award.

He began his professional career in 1950 at Phillips Petroleum Co. in Bartlesville, Okla., and later became involved in piping design and engineering at Foster Wheeler Corp., and in HVAC and plumbing design at the consulting firm of Raymond L. Jenkins, both in Houston.

He retired in 1996 as chairman of the board and CEO at Stubbs Overbeck & Associates. During his 43 years with the firm, he was involved in every facet of the engineering and construction of refineries and petrochemical plants, from long-range planning and financing to systems design and installation.

Born on November 6, 1927, in Phoenix, AZ, Thayer joined the U.S. Navy at the age of 17 and later graduated with honors from Kansas State, under the G.I. Bill with a Mechanical Engineering degree. He was a registered professional engineer in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Mississippi.

He is preceded in death by his beloved wife of over 70 years, Ruthy, who passed away seven months earlier. They met at a baseball game in 1949 and married shortly thereafter. With Ruthy at his side they travelled the world and were often seen together at ASME events. Keith Thayer’s last words to his family were “to just be kind.”

In 2015, Keith and Ruthy Thayer sponsored the renaming of conference 7C at ASME’s New York City Office. The designation of The HART Conference Room, an acronym that stands for Humor, Action, Respect, and Teamwork, was a personal motto that Thayer often shared at ASME meetings and gatherings. His wish was that all who occupied the room would be inspired, motivated, and rewarded.

November 2021 Obituaries

James A. Mason Jr., a devoted member of ASME and an ASME Fellow, died of natural causes on November 9, 2021, at the age of 87.

Jim was born and raised in Belleville, Ill. where he met his wife of over 65 years, Mary. In 1964, Jim moved his family to Webster, NY where he embarked on a 31 year decorated career with Xerox Corporation where he had held several management positions in materials and process development, advanced manufacturing engineering, plant engineering, and components manufacturing before retiring in 1995.

His passion for engineering led him to join ASME while as a student at the University of Notre Dame where he served as the treasurer and chair of the student section. This would be the start of a long and fruitful membership in ASME where he chaired numerous committees and conferences during his 65 years of association with ASME.

Jim served as Secretary and Treasurer of ASME from 1996-2001. He also held leadership positions on the Committee on Program Review from 1989-94, the Committee on Finance and Investment from 1990-96, and the Committee on Staff from 1996-2001. He was the recipient of the ASME Centennial Award in 1980, elected as a Fellow in 1992, and received the ASME Dedicated Service Award in 1999.

Jim served as a volunteer on ASME staff as project manager in developing career guidance for minority and women junior high school students. He also served as a charter member of the steering committee that founded ASME’s Minority Engineering Education effort.

Jim was a proud alum of the University of Notre Dame where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. He later earned a graduate degree in Industrial Engineering from Penn State University.

October 2021 Obituaries

Chor Weng Tan, Ph.D., former managing director of Education at ASME, died on October 1, 2021, in La Jolla, California at the age of 85.

Dr. Tan was born in China on April 20, 1936. He was raised and attended primary and high school in Malaysia. After one year of college in Singapore, he continued his education in the United States, receiving his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Evansville in 1959 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of Illinois in 1963.

From 1963 to 1989, Dr. Tan was associated with The Cooper Union in New York City, first as assistant professor and later as the Dean of the School of Engineering. He initiated the practice-oriented Master of Engineering program and founded the Cooper Union Research Foundation, by which students worked on and received funding for research-oriented projects for private industry.

In 1989 Dr. Tan accepted an assignment as Program Director of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), where he selected recipients of the Presidential Young Investigators Awards, allowing some of the nation’s best young scientists and engineers to pursue research and development in their chosen fields.

Between 1991 and 2004, Dr. Tan served as managing director for Education at ASME. He solicited numerous research and study projects from the NSF, the United Engineering Foundation, U.S. Department of Education, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and ASME Research Foundation. He launched the ASME Volunteer Orientation and Leadership Training Academy and convened the first national meeting of ME Department Heads, known as ASME Engineering Education Leadership Summit.

In 2005, as a consultant to ASME, Dr. Tan played an important role in taking the ASME Engineering Education Leadership Summit to China, leading to the signing of an official Agreement of Cooperation between ASME and the Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

After retiring at the end of 2005, Dr. Tan redirected his attention to charity. He initiated a project in Yunnan, China to provide scholarships to ethnic minority female students enabling them to continue their high school and college education.

Dr. Tan is survived by his wife, Yulin, and two sons.

The Tan Family has requested those who wish to express sympathy to join with them in donating to the ASME Foundation to support a scholarship in Chor’s honor. Please write “the Chor Weng Tan Scholarship” in the Designation line.

Stuart W. Cameron, CEng, MBE, former member of the ASME Board of Governors (2017-2020) and an ASME Fellow, died on October 7, 2021, in his homeland of Scotland at the age of 75.

Cameron rose from humble beginnings as an apprentice in John Brown’s Shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, later to become one of the key engineers in boiler and the pressure vessel industry as chief engineer for Doosan Babcock. Upon retiring from Doonan Babcock in 2010, he was retained as a consultant until his untimely passing.

Professor Cameron was an active member of ASME having served on the Section I Committee on Power Boilers; the Sub-Group on Fabrication and Examination of Section I; vice chair of the Board on Strategic Initiatives of the Council for Standards and Certification; and chair of the McDonald Mentoring Committee. He was also a member of the Committee of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Conformity Assessment, and a member of the Council on Standards and Certification. But it was his place as the very first Scot on the ASME Board of Governors that he probably took most delight in.

Cameron was a recipient of the ASME Dedicated Service Award and was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, which is the highest engineering accolade in the UK. He served as a visiting professor to the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of Strathclyde and was awarded the national honor of being a Member of the British Empire (MBE) for voluntary services to mechanical engineering and for sponsoring over one hundred young engineers to gain Chartered Engineer status. His volunteering also extended to his involvement in STEM projects with Primary Engineer, working with schools to encourage young people to pursue engineering as a career.

August 2021 Obituaries

Melvin J. “Mel” Helmich, P.E., an ASME Fellow, and member of the Central Ohio Section, died on August 29th in Mount Vernon, OH. He was 96 years old.

After serving in the 100th Engineering Division of the U.S. Army during WWII, Helmich enrolled at Purdue University in 1946. He was one of the last engineers to graduate with a degree in Railway Mechanical Engineering. Following graduation, he joined Cooper-Bessemer, and worked in their Locomotive and Marine Engine Department.

Helmich was one of two central figures in the Cooper-Bessemer/General Electric engine development program. As manager, he worked closely with James C. Rhoades, who was GE’s locomotive engine program manager from its inception in 1948.

As a result of their work, GE announced a new 7FDL engine and its first domestic diesel-electric locomotive, the U25B. The 16-cylinder engine design that Helmich and Rhoades worked on went into production in 1960 at 2500 traction horsepower and matured to 4400 by late 1993. The GE 7FDL engine is still in production today.

Helmich held numerous positions within Cooper Energy Systems over a 40-year career until his retirement in 1991.

In addition to being named a Fellow of ASME in 1975, Helmich was the recipient of the Internal Combustion Engine Award in 1971 and was presented with the ASME Dedicated Service Award in 1998.

Nathan H. Hurt, P.E., ASME Past President (1991-1992), former member of the Board of Governors, and an Honorary Member of the Society, died on August 1st in Lake Havasu City, AZ. He was 100 years old.

Mr. Hurt, an ASME Fellow, was an active, dedicated, and beloved member of the Society for over seventy-five years, having served in leadership roles on the General Engineering Technical Group, Management Division, Committee of Past Presidents, and Committee on Organization and Rules. He received the ASME Dedicated Service Award in 1994.

A licensed professional engineer, he began his career at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in 1947. During his 40 years with the company, he was involved in the construction and operation of plants to produce polyvinyls, polyesters, rubber chemicals and synthetic rubber. He held several engineering and plant management positions; and served as program director for the design, construction, and training of operating management for a synthetic rubber plant in Brazil for Petrobras, the Brazilian government-owned petroleum company.

When Goodyear formed a subsidiary, Goodyear Atomic Corporation, to fulfill a contract with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission for the operation of a new uranium enrichment facility, Hurt was manager of engineering during the facility design and construction. Later he was deputy general manager and, subsequently, the corporation’s president and general manager.

After retiring from Goodyear in 1987, Hurt joined Los Alamos Technical Associates in its Denver office as director of marketing and projects. His responsibilities included managing an office in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and projects at several other U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear sites. He later joined IDM Environmental Corp.’s Oak Ridge office as vice president, southeast region. In this position, he was responsible for the decontamination and demolition of facility projects at several DOE sites. He concluded his career as a consultant on uranium enrichment and radioactive cleanup.

He was also a Fellow of the Institution of Engineers, Australia, and a member of the American Nuclear Society, and the American Society for Engineering Management. Following his service in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he attended the University of Colorado where he earned his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.

May 2021 Obituaries

Calvin (Charles) Brunner, P.E., passed away on May 10, 2021. He was 82. Brunner joined ASME in 1961 and became a Life Member of the Society in 2007.

A pioneering mechanical engineer, Brunner created incinerator systems and technology for waste treatment and disposal around the world.

In a career spanning over five decades, Brunner was an expert in designing incinerators that transformed waste into energy. In the United States alone, he was involved in the existence of 90 incinerators, which kept garbage from landfills and provided energy to thousands of homes.

His vast expertise was sought after as he consulted for governments, conducted seminars, gave lectures, and served as an expert witness. His work brought him all over the world, to nearly every continent.

A prolific writer, Brunner authored 13 textbooks on incineration which are still used today, including Incineration Systems Handbook, which is considered the industry's go-to reference.

Brunner credits his high school education at Bronx Science for helping to nurture his passion for engineering, reading, and mathematics. He earned degrees from the City College of New York and Penn State University.

Determined to give opportunities to future Bronx Science students, in 2016 he sponsored The Brunner Awards which provides financial stipends to students to pursue dreams they never imagined were possible.

Brunner is survived by his loving wife, Claire, and their three daughters.
