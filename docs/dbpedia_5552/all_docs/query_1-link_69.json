        "text": "Bio:\n\nHaidee J is the co-founder of the Boston-based band Double Star, which she formed with Dave Kurimsky. The band as is described by the Somerville Arts Council: “Double Star mixes punk riffs, high-energy horns, and lush harmonies to create pop tunes that defy easy categorization.”\n\nHere is a historical bio of Double Star courtesy of Haidee J:\n\n“I think I can write a song around that” Haidee said to Dave, when he shared some half-finished guitar riffs with her. It was a cloudy, cool day in March when these two seasoned musicians, both veterans of a number of bands on the East and West coasts, got together for coffee at Jamaica Plain’s iconic, cow-themed ice cream parlor.\n\nJust two weeks later, their first song was complete; State Line, a song about a road trip along the Northern California coast, a favorite activity of Haidee’s when she lived in Portland, OR.\n\nBefore too long, these rising double stars had enough material to start filling out the band with bass, drums, and another multi instrumentalist female on keys/synth, saxophone, backing vocals, and percussion.\n\nInspired by the feelings that are stirred by the various chords and rhythms of Dave’s and her guitars, Haidee’s lyrics run the gamut from drug addict breakups in Holding Hands is For Lovers and Small Children, to surviving a hurricane in Thoughts and Prayers Are Not Enough. She also touches on standing up for yourself (Say Something Now), escaping the boredom of a small town (Small Town) and hearing voices (Late at Night Inside My Head).\n\nDouble Star was born and has been taking the Boston music scene by (solar) storm with their catchy melodies, pop sensibilities, and lovably quirky arrangements. Like a double star in the sky, that appears to be one star until you look closer, Double Star may surprise you!\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat brought you to Boston?\n\nI grew up in Brookline, then moved out to the West Coast for about 10 years after college, before deciding to move back East to be closer to family. I was in a band for six years in Portland, OR. We had some local success, playing the main stage at Portland’s Pride Festival, an audience of thousands. On the downside, we handed out CDs for free, but they had been burned on an early computer CD burner and didn’t work in most players. We also weren’t marketing savvy, and this was pre-Facebook etc., so struggled to build a big fanbase. Once back in Boston I kept my eye out and played with numerous people and bands until I met Dave and we formed Double Star.\n\nHave you experienced a strong scene for Queer women and gender expansive folx in Boston in terms of music/performers etc?\n\nNot really, but that doesn’t mean it’s not there. I identify as a rock musician first, and a woman in rock 2nd. I can’t say I go out of my way to seek out queer oriented events. We applied to play at some pride events this past year and didn’t get in, or even hear back from some of them. The one we were invited to play at in the suburbs we couldn’t make.\n\nDo you have any sense of a history of a Queer scene in the city?\n\nI do have a sense of a history of a Queer scene in the City, mostly that there are gay clubs, for dancing, and of course, annual Pride month and related events.\n\nAre there any venues or spaces that have been particularly influential or accommodating?\n\nAccommodating to queer or gender expansive artists, I can’t really think of any in particular. Nor can I think of any that felt unaccommodating. Some of my favorite venues have been Aeronaut brewing, both the Allston outdoor and Somerville locations, the Square Root in Roslindale, and the Midway Café in JP of course. We had our first show there and play there a few times a year. I’m amazed at how stable the staff has remained, even through Covid, and they are always friendly and seem happy to have us back. Also, shout out to the JP Music Fest. We had a blast playing there in 2022, the sound system was amazing, and I loved that they sold your merch for you. That felt like a Boston area highlight for us.\n\nAre there any artists in the Boston scene or elsewhere that you admire or who have inspired your own music?\n\nYeah, definitely. Some of my favorite local bands to play with include Threat Level Burgundy, CE Skidmore and the Damn Fine Band, The Skirts, Pink Slip, The Spots, Battlemode, AZNjujube, Why Try?. I’m know there are more, but off the top of my head, those bands share our energy; some are ska which we draw from significantly, some are quirky but also poppy like us, and some have queer members, with whom I feel an affinity.\n\nDo you think things are getting better for Queer performers or are there still barriers to overcome?\n\nI haven’t noticed any barriers for me or my band. I feel like the arts scene in Boston proper is very Queer-friendly. I wear a shirt and tie for every show and have never gotten so much as a sideways glance.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a Queer person thinking about getting into music?\n\nSame advice I’d give anyone, Do it! Don’t be afraid. If it’s something you love and can do, it’s a powerful art form.\n\nAre there any other current or former bands, solo artists, or DJs you would like to see featured by QWIMB?\n\nHave you talked to CE Skidmore and the Damn Fine Band? We played with them once and saw them another time and they’re fantastic and queer-fronted. Also, Battlemode. Also the Spots.\n\nLinks to Music and Social Media\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/doublestarband\n\nDouble Star on Bandcamp\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/doublestarband/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/doublestarband/\n\nArtist Bio: Ash Landrein (she/they) is a queer musician and writer, and founding father of Sorry, Ma!, a DIY Alt-Punk band from Somerville, Massachusetts. Ash and guitarist, Tom, take influence from The Replacements, L7, Archers of Loaf, and other fringe favorites from the 80’s and beyond. Ash is also the Production Manager for ONCE Somerville, and works at different venues around the Boston and Camberville area. They currently live in Jamaica Plain, and enjoy spending time with their sweet and sensitive, Pisces girlfriend, eating Vegan fast food.\n\nSorry, Ma! Is: Alex Chaisson (Bass), Ash Landrein (Vocals/Guitar), Tom Nikiper (Vocals/Guitar), and Roman Zapata (Drums)\n\nWhat brought you up to Boston?\n\nI moved up to Boston in late summer of 2019. I’d been living at home on Long Island for awhile, going back to school for my undergrad degree. In 2015, though, I suffered a head and neck injury, and it took me twice as long to graduate. I spent a lot of time in isolation, but I taught myself guitar! It took me like seven months to nail down that first ‘D’ chord, but after that I was hooked. It was gratifying when I could finally cover “New Slang”. I spent hours watching my favorite bands on YouTube. By the time I moved up to Boston for good, I couldn’t wait to join a band and meet others with the same ideology. I said, “Show me your queers with guitars.”\n\nHave you experienced a strong scene for women here and gender expansive folx in terms of music/performers etc.?\n\nYea, there’s definitely a strong scene here. I came from a really conservative place, call it a “queer wasteland”, really. It was liberating moving to Boston and seeing so many gender-expansive people, expressing outwardly what I had been hiding internally for years.\n\nBut, it’s also been really tough, too. I met someone on day one in my new city that was a queer woman in an all-female band. We clicked instantly and I looked to her as a sort-of guide to the scene, someone with years of experience identifying with a sexuality I’d barely started to comprehend. I thought I’d met the Corin Tucker to my Carrie Brownstein. I was like “we’re going to form a band and be in love”, and I felt that reciprocated…until it wasn’t. I’d spent years hiding myself, just to come out and be silenced all over again. I was devastated, and suddenly in this gatekeeper situation, where I didn’t really know who I could connect with or where to go to feel included. Certain sects of the scene can be really insular, and that was addressed over the pandemic. I know that’s not super uplifting, but I do think it’s important. It’s really common for marginalized people, especially queer women, to idealize the coming out process. When you’ve been so deprived of a community and a sense of belonging for so long, you tend to fantasize situations in your head, just to get by. But there’s a lot of trauma in this community, people get hurt and they hurt other people in self-defense and self-preservation, and that’s just something I’ve had to contend with.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, and all that shit got put to the backburner anyway. Aside from crying daily to “Punisher”, a one-off Rilo Kiley Zoom Sing-Along, and a back porch stick-n-poke, there wasn’t much connection to a queer music scene at all, let alone Boston.\n\nI was lucky to have met my band before lockdown, though. Tom, our guitarist, and I clicked right away. He’s a North Jersey “emo kid”. He just took me in right away, and allowed me to scream and cry and heal and write my first songs. We just wanted to be Paul Westerberg and Tommy Stinson. And then Alex, our bassist, is just the best. I’ve known him for so long now. We actually dated back in my “hetero” days, and now we’re just best friends and act like puppies with each other on stage. He puts the biggest smile on my face. Roman is our silent but deadly drummer. He’s so talented and so prepared to slay you with his dry humor. Sometimes I get heady about being the only queer woman in the group, but then I see how sensitive and kind they are. It’s super healing. It doesn’t matter what you identify as at the end of the day, just be kind and lead with empathy.\n\nBut back to the scene. Now, I work for ONCE and help produce these summer series they’ve been doing with Boynton Yards in Union Square. JJ Gonson is amazing. We are a team of all queer women this summer. I’ve met so many amazing queer musicians these last two years, and made some great connections. There is so much local talent. It’s crazy I get paid to listen to such great music on a weekly basis. I’m always like, “how doesn’t everyone know about them?” I’m just honored to be part of the family and the history, and the future really. We’ve got big things in the works for the venue and the community, and I’m really excited to see how it all plays out, and contribute what I can. Like I said, it was a rough start, but I’ve finally found a place I belong in the city. It feels good.\n\nAre there any venues or spaces that have been particularly influential or accommodating?\n\nONCE, like I mentioned, is pretty much the bar of how most venues should operate, in my opinion, in terms of inclusivity and respect. State Park in Kendall Square is awesome too. It’s got that cool dive bar feel, with a jukebox and table shuffleboard and cheap beer. I started DJ’ing there first- they have people playing records two or three nights a week with a wicked set-up. It’s awesome. They have live shows on Sundays. They are really nice about letting me play there. We‘ve got our first full band gig there in October. Nicholas Ward who books there is a super nice guy. All the staff are very kind and complimentary towards performers. It’s the closest I’ve ever gotten to having my own Cheers bar. The Jungle in Union Square is also great.\n\nAre there any artists in the Boston scene or elsewhere that you admire or who have inspired your own music?\n\nAs far as elsewhere, and it’s very far elsewhere, Camp Cope have been one of my biggest inspirations. They are a three-piece from Melbourne. Literally from the moment I heard the opening bass line of “Done” I was like “yea, that’s what I want to do”. They’ve lifted a lot of queer women around the world up with them. Same with Mannequin Pussy, Palehound, Dump Him, Screaming Females, Cayetana, Sincere Engineer. I could go on. The number of queer women in music has exploded since I was a kid.\n\nAs far as Boston goes, the women in Thrust Club are like my older sisters. Erin Genett is my literal kin, and I’ve looked up to her since I was a kid, but she’s really taken me under her wing. She’s always first to introduce you to someone you should know, or include you in the conversation. She’s just the best Leo there is.\n\nI’ve started being more intentional about booking shows with other queer women. I set up a show back in May with Cadderwall, The Skirts, and Bad Idea USA. The energy was amazing and everyone was so kind and inclusive. I’ve loved watching Walter Sickert and the Army of Broken Toys, Muzzins, Grace Givertz, Naomi Westwater, Julie Rhodes, DJ WhySham and co., Happy Little Clouds, Trigger Discipline. Genie Santiago headlined for us right after the Dobbs decision in June. It was hard but we all really bonded in the lot that day.\n\nWhat advice would you give a queer person thinking about getting into music?\n\nJust do it. Don’t wait for anyone. If you’ve got the passion, you’ll find a way. Turn your pain into art.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in the future?\n\nI’d like to record some songs we’ve just started playing live. I want to write more and book more shows. I think the future is bright for this scene, but it’s important to make an effort, and meet people where they are. My dream is to own my own queer, female focused music and book store. I’ve been working with Chris at Light of Day records. He’s such a good mentor and so inclusive. I want to highlight all of the music and literature from queer women that have inspired me over the years, and learn more about the ones that haven’t hit my radar yet. I want to continue the conversation, and continue to champion the ones doing the good work.\n\nAre there any other artists you’d like to see featured in QWIMB?\n\nPaper Lady, you’re up!\n\nLinks:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sorrymaband/?hl=en\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sorrymaband/\n\nBandcamp: https://sorryma.bandcamp.com/\n\nSpecial Thanks to JJ Gonson for lending their photographic eye, and Tina Lafleur for featuring us in this issue of QWIMB.\n\nLinks:\n\nJJ Gonson: https://jj-gonson-photography.myshopify.com/\n\nQWIMB: http://qwimb.org/\n\nONCE Somerville: https://oncesomerville.com/\n\nRed Shaydez, (a stage name she developed from a pair of red sunglasses her aunt bought for her as a child), is a woman of countless talents. “Red” represents her aura and the passion she has for all of her pursuits. “Shaydez” intertwines her nickname and symbolizes her vision of the world as well as her point of view behind her sunglasses. The Boston-native powerhouse (with roots in Macon, GA) is a Boston Music Award winning hip-hop artist, professional video producer, public speaker, educator, and youth mentor. Red’s undeniable talent and electric personality have been widely praised by both local and national media such as MTV, BET JAMS, Boston 25 News , The Boston Globe, NPR MUSIC, and more! Her music video/mini-film for ‘Little Sabrina’ was selected for the 2020 Roxbury International Film Festival as well.\n\nRed Shaydez has been headlining shows and performing at festivals like A3C, Hip Hop Festival in Atlanta, BAMS Fest, and area universities in New England for over a decade. After being co-signed by the legendary MC Lyte, Red has released multiple EP’s, two studio albums, and was nominated for “Best Female Rapper of the Year” at the 2015 NYC Underground Music Awards. She has also been nominated for four Boston Music Awards including Album of the Year, Breakthrough Artist of the Year, and more!

I was embraced with open arms from the Queer scene. That’s when my career began to take off in the city.\n\nDo you have any sense of a history of a Queer scene in the city?\n\nNot until 2018. I didn’t even know one existed.\n\nAre there any venues or spaces that have been particularly influential or accommodating?\n\nClub Café, Midtown Café (no longer with us), and last but certainly not least Bella Luna Lounge (also no longer with us)\n\nAre there any artists that you look up to or who have inspired your own music?\n\nAaliyah for sure for her overall persona and approach to music/personal life balance. Her mystery. Probably one of the biggest reasons I wear the shades besides my social anxiety! Lol\n\nI’m also inspired by Missy Elliot, J. Cole, Nas and Queen Latifah to name a few.\n\nDo think things are getting better for Queer performers or are there still barriers to overcome?\n\nThere will always be barriers to overcome because people as well as institutions feel entitled, especially with the Transgender community. Opportunities given to queer folks often exclude them. That needs to change. With that being said–things are getting better in some areas.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a Queer person thinking about getting into music?\n\nYou deserve to take up space. You have every right to be here.\n\nAre there any other current or former bands, solo artists, or DJs you would like to see featured by QWIMB?\n\nDJ WhySham, DJ Live, Oompa, and Lik Meraki\n\nRed Shaydez Website\n\nRed Shaydez on Twitter\n\nRed Shaydez Instagram\n\nJen Scumaci (DJ Skooch) has been beat-mixing, remixing, and mash-upping groovy tunes on the New England Seacoast since 2014.

More info on IG @j_skooch and FB @DJSkooch.\n\nWhat brought you to Boston?\n\nI moved to Massachusetts in 2000 to go to grad school and loved it up here so much that I stuck around and moved closer to Boston in 2002.\n\nHave you experienced a strong scene for Queer women in the city in terms of music/performers, dance nights etc?\n\nYa know, I really have! I think the Boston area is a great place to be a queer womxn because even though the actual “scene” might not be as prevalent as it is in some other cities, the sense of community I’ve experienced is off-the-charts. Every queer womxn I’ve met has the same fire, passion, and drive to create connections between and amongst us that are empowering, uplifting, and super genuine and I feel so proud to be in the mix. Before the pandemic, I was spinning at Fool’s Errand on the Fenway every week for See-You-Next-Tuesdays (cocktails, snacks, tunes, connections, & community for queer womxn), launched in January 2020 by the amazing Chef Tiffani Faison. I have no doubt that had it not been for COVID, those nights would still be going strong!\n\nDo you have any sense of a history of a Queer scene in the city?\n\nWell, this is where the “Boston marriage” originated, right? 😉 In all seriousness, the history of LGBTQ+ advocacy in Boston runs pretty deep – this is where GLAAD was born and where the first openly gay state rep (Elaine Noble) was elected – and Massachusetts was the first state to legalize same-sex marriage. Obviously these are not examples of a “scene” but I guess my point is that there’s a lot of queer blood in the veins of Boston’s history and I just love that.\n\nWhat made you decide to start performing?\n\nIn 2014, my best pal DJ Jodi (DJ Jodi Entertainment) asked me if I would consider learning how to DJ to work some gigs for her. Saying “yes” was like tapping the first domino in the most amazing domino chain ever. I love being a DJ more than I’ve ever loved working any job I’ve ever had and I wanna be an 80-year-old grandma dropping bass like you read about.\n\nAre there any artists that you look up to or who have inspired your own music?\n\nWell, I don’t really have “my own” music since I’m not a production DJ (not yet, anyways…!). I use other people’s music to elevate events and experiences and I do work really hard to curate sets and mixes that honor and celebrate the original work of the artists whose music I use. My DJing/mixing style has absolutely been influenced by the pioneers of hip-hop music (Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmaster Flash). I have always been – and always will be – madly in love with The Beastie Boys. And my DJ idol is DJ AM – he was the greatest. There are some super fierce female DJs I look up to, too – DJ Perly, DJ Lady Style, and DJ Killa-Jewel are all mind-blowingly amazing!\n\nDo think things are getting better for Queer performers or are there still barriers to overcome?\n\nI think things are both getting better AND there are still barriers to overcome – especially for queer womxn – and I think this will pretty much be the case for the rest of my lifetime anyways. I can tell you that I’ve had many negative run-ins with straight male DJs while I’m just trying to do my thing, but I think that says more about their fragile masculinity than it does about my skills. Sexuality and gender scare people who’ve not spent enough (or any) time or energy thinking about their own identities. I think that population is shrinking, though, and I see a future full of humans who embrace, appreciate, and celebrate everyone for exactly who they are.\n\nWhat has been your proudest moment as DJ?\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a total sap, I am always proudest when I’m playing and I look into the crowd and see my wife lost in the music, dancing like crazy. But if I had to pinpoint a specific proudest moment, it was just recently when I was in my basement all alone with my Technics 1200s and figured out how to manually breakbeat with Biggie’s “One More Chance.” It was also pretty rad to get to open for Thievery Corporation, the Ladies of LCD Soundsystem, and Oompa.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a queer woman thinking about getting into music or starting to DJ?\n\nDO IT. DO IT NOW. DON’T WAIT ANOTHER MINUTE. And, you don’t have to drop everything to do it – you can ease into it and as long as you are consistent, you’ll gradually get better and better at it. And as you get better at it, you will fall in love with it more, which will make you wanna keep getting better at it, then you’ll fall deeper – it’s an amazingly fulfilling cycle. Also, reach out – make connections with people and events that feel important to you. Hell, if you like what you read in this interview, reach out to me and let’s talk – I love collaborating with and learning from rad people!\n\nAre there any other current or former bands, solo artists, or other DJs you would like to see featured by QWIMB?\n\nALL OF THEM! I wanna know about everyone, for realz! Thanks for giving voice to queer womxn in music in the Boston area! <3\n\nMore from DJ Skooch\n\nJen Scumaci\n\njen@fastgirl.co\n\n603.285.1143\n\nBrandie Blaze is a hip hop artist from Boston, Massachusetts. Heavily inspired by Lil Kim, Nicki Minaj and Missy Elliot, Blaze spreads her message of “trap feminism” through her hard hitting bars and dynamic stage presence. Performing since the age of 3, she started writing poetry in middle school and transitioned to rapping in high school. Blaze has had the pleasure of opening for such artists as JPEGMAFIA, Junglepussy, STL GLD, Oompa and Cliff Notez. She has also been featured in publications like Boston Hassle, the Dorchester Reporter, Vanyaland, Allston Pudding, Dig Boston, Boston Magazine, Elle Italia, Madame Rap and grammy.com. Brandie was nominated for 2 Boston Music Awards in 2019 and dropped her sophomore LP, Late Bloomer, this past December.\n\nQWIMB Q&A with Brandie Blaze\n\nWhat brought you to Boston?\n\nI’m born and raised in Boston. I’m the 3rd generation of my family to be born here.\n\nHave you experienced a strong scene for Queer women in the city in terms of music/performers etc?\n\nYes! It’s actually one of the things that I love most about the city and inspired me to come out of the closet in 2018. Before even knowing my orientation, the queer music scene really embraced me and showed me nothing but love and support. I felt at home and comfortable with who I am in my personal life in a way I had never experienced before.\n\nDo you have any sense of a history of a Queer scene in the city?\n\nI just remember being really young and going to Paradise in Cambridge or Club Cafe with my cousin and just having the time of my life. It just felt really freeing, even when I was still questioning who I was.\n\nWhat made you decide to start performing?\n\nI’ve been performing since I was 3 years old, so I don’t remember not ever being on stage. I grew up performing, but I’ve changed mediums since being a toddler. I started as a dancer, which I did for 15 years. I started writing poetry in middle school and transitioned to rapping in high school. After I graduated in high school, I still danced for maybe a year, but I gave that up as well. I was 26 years old when I decided to give rap a serious shot because I was missing the stage and felt really empty without it.\n\nAre there any artists that you look up to or who have inspired your own music?\n\nI grew up with Lil’ Kim, Missy Elliot and all the other amazing rap queens. They inspired me the most in developing my sound and style. Oompa, Red Shaydez and Moe Pope inspire me to continue to grow as an artist and to never stop working on my craft. They’re the bar I set for myself lyrically.\n\nDo think things are getting better for Queer performers or are there still barriers to overcome?\n\nAbsolutely, there are barriers to overcome. Especially, as a hip hop artist. The genre is becoming more friendly to queer women, but we still have a ways to go. I want to be able to live in an age where people don’t feel like they have to be in the closet to be a rapper.\n\nWhat has been your proudest moment performing music or as a musician in general?\n\nReleasing my second album has been my proudest moment so far. The release party was the biggest crowd I’d ever had as a headliner, and to see people’s reactions to hearing the album for the first time was incredible. I’m also really proud of the strides I’ve made as an artist and performer in the 3 years between my first and second album.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a queer woman thinking about starting a band or learning an instrument?\n\nDo it! Life is too short to second guess yourself. The first step is going to be the hardest, but once you start and stay consistent, good things will happen for you. Also, open mics are a God send and an amazing way to hone your performance skills and get noticed.\n\nAre there any other current or former bands or solo artists you would like to see featured by QWIMB?\n\nRed Shaydez, Oompa\n\nPitstain is a queer & feminist punk trio born in Boston, MA. Jules Ozone, on bass and vocals, loves melodic, spotlight-stealing basslines and distorted screaming blended with legitimate singing. Kelly Baker, on drums and vocals, is committed to a DIY ethos and writing heavy-handed lyrics about politics. Kathleen Silver, on guitar and backup vocals, combines meticulous riffs with fuzzy power chords. Imagine if Kim Deal, Meg White and Julia Kugel formed a band. In Boston. And were all super queer and wrote songs about the grind of everyday capitalism, mental health, and being hit on without your consent. The members of Pitstain met through volunteering at Girls Rock Campaign Boston, a feminist organization that empowers youth to make noise and take up space through music education. Self-described “polite punks,” the band members write all of their songs collaboratively and value respect and connection above all else in creative endeavors.\n\nQWIMB Q&A With Pitstain\n\nWhat brought you to Boston?\n\nJules: I originally moved to Boston for a relationship (0/10 would not recommend), but stayed to attend grad school for mental health counseling. I’m so happy now that I came here because it introduced me to an incredible community of musicians and friends.\n\nKathleen: I also moved here for grad school and part of why I chose my program is because of the location!\n\nKelly: I’m the outlier — I was born and raised in Boston.\n\nHave you experienced a strong scene for Queer women in the city in terms of music/performers etc?\n\nJules: Most of my community comes from Girls Rock Campaign Boston, a community that is made up of many queer women and folks with other marginalized gender identities. I feel so lucky to be surrounded by so many people who share my identity, but outside of GRCB I can’t think of any queer women performers who I’ve met in the recent past.\n\nKathleen: Sadly, grad school demands have kept me from exploring the queer scene in Boston as much as I’d like. Most of my friends here are queer and/or musicians, but that’s probably a sampling bias on my part.\n\nKelly: When I was in my early twenties, almost a decade ago now, I was pretty heavily into the DIY punk scene in Boston — going to shows in Allston basements and all that. It was a super male dominated space. I felt unwelcome as a queer woman. It kind of chewed me up and spit me out. I didn’t go to local shows for a number of years because it was so triggering. I’ve gotten back into it again and have been so stoked to see how many queer, female, and/or POC folks are creating their own punk spaces and rewriting the narrative of who is centered in DIY spaces. I’m excited to contribute to it now.\n\nDo you have any sense of a history of a Queer scene in the city?\n\nJules: I don’t at all. I just came here several years ago. According to my partner, Jamaica Plain used to have a thriving queer scene which diminished once rent skyrocketed in that area.\n\nKathleen: I really don’t but I’d love to learn more!\n\nKelly: Damn. This question really hit me hard… this is my hometown and I have no idea. That’s why QWIMB is so important — we have to archive & share & talk about queer stories.\n\nWhat made you decide to join a band?\n\nJules: I love playing music as an act of self-care, and I love collaborating with people who share my creative aspirations and worldviews. I’ve spent some time making music on my own but playing regularly with friends keeps me accountable and motivated to keep playing!\n\nKathleen: I’ve been playing guitar since middle school but always either in jazz band or by myself in my basement. I basically handed my best friend a bass and some No Doubt tabs and convinced her to learn so we could play together. We formed a band with our other good friend who is a drummer and after that experience, I didn’t look back! I have played in various bands since then but had a lull period for a few years, so I was SO excited to join Pitstain.\n\nKelly: It was a lifelong dream. But it felt super out of reach. By my late twenties, I honestly thought I was too old to learn an instrument. In 2017, on a whim, I attended Ladies Rock Camp and that blew my mind. I started teaching myself to play drums, joined this band, and here we are.\n\nAre there any artists that you look up to or who have inspired your own music?\n\nJules: I started playing bass because I wanted to learn Kim Deal’s basslines from when she played with Pixies. I also draw a lot of inspiration from Kathleen Hanna; she describes her voice as “a bullet” shooting towards an imaginary target, and I think of my own voice in that way when I’m screaming lyrics at the top of my lungs.\n\nKathleen: So so so many, whether they’re an inspiration for their guitar, lyrics, general attitude, or all of the above. Some all-stars are Joan Jett, Debbie Harry, Shirley Manson, Emily Haines, Marissa Paternoster, and so many more.\n\nKelly: So many. I love listening to shit that blows up the idea of what a woman should sound like — you know, pretty and soft and shit. I get a lot of vocal inspiration from Brody Dalle (The Distillers), Stephanie Luke (Coathangers) and Marissa Paternoster (Screaming Females), for example.\n\nDo think things are getting better for Queer performers or are there still barriers to overcome?\n\nJules: Both! It seems like it has become more acceptable/celebrated to be openly queer as a musician over time, at the same pace at is has become more accepted in general society. Most of the bands I listen to, I listen to in part because they have queer members. I also see ways in which queer performers are held to higher standards than their straight counterparts, such as the queer band PWR BTTM being removed from all streaming services following abuse allegations while mainstream cis male performers continue making music despite numerous accusers coming forward for the same thing.\n\nKathleen: What Jules said.\n\nKelly: Yeah, I think it’s still highly contextual. We seek out venues that are demonstrably queer friendly, we only book gigs with bands that we know (or know of) and have a good feeling about. That’s intentional. And it also feels like I’m in a cozy safe bubble of my own choosing. I think there’s a lot of privilege to that — as three white cis-women. There are lots of BIPOC artists and performers who might experience racism at some of the same venues that I probably consider “safe” or “good.” That’s a blind spot for sure. I look to organizations like BAMS Fest who are doing some dope artist organizing to carve out space for QTPOC folks in the Boston music scene.\n\nWhat has been your proudest moment as a member of a band or as a musician in general?\n\nJules: I’m so proud of how our band writes music collaboratively and base all of our process and aesthetic on mutual respect and love for one another. I would not want to embark on any creative endeavor that didn’t double as an interpersonal bond with my creative partners. It is sometimes hard to maintain these values as stress and creative differences occasionally come up, but we stick to them regardless.\n\nKathleen: This was a long time ago, but I remember playing a show at this bar all the way back in high school with some other bands who were all dudes. I think it was my first show that was actually in “public” even though basically nobody came. I was setting up in the back and the manager forcibly grabbed my shoulder and was like, “No girlfriends allowed backstage.” It was immensely satisfying to shove his hand off me and show him my fist (marked B for band). That memory has stuck with me for over a decade.\n\nKelly: Oh my god, Kathleen, that’s the worst. Your response, though! Badass. For me, my proudest moment is just getting up on stage and doing it. It’s incredibly vulnerable and nerve-wracking and exhilarating, every time.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a woman thinking about starting a band or learning an instrument?\n\nJules: Start out learning on your own! I think that many women/girls who want to play music feel that they need to be taught by a professional in order to learn the “right” way to play, and those professionals are often male musicians who teach in a didactic and intimidating way that does not always align with how people learn. Also, as women, we are socialized to be ashamed of any creative mistakes we make, which prevents us from learning because mistakes are so integral to gaining mastery. If you rock out alone in your room, you can make as many mistakes as you want and not feel judged by whatever bro thinks he’s been tasked with teaching you the “right” way to play.\n\nKathleen: Do it! Also, practice, practice, practice. It might take longer than you hope to get where you want to be but that just means you have more time to have fun getting to know your instrument. Practice for the process, not necessarily the outcome.\n\nKelly: You are not too old. Like, seriously, 65 is not too old. Or 30. Or 92. Or 15. The age you are now is the perfect age to pick up an instrument. There’s this obsession in our culture with doing things on a timeline. And that’s the least punk thing I can think of. Just go for it. Be sloppy, make mistakes, get weird with it.\n\nAre there any other current or former bands or solo artists you would like to see featured by QWIMB?\n\nYes so many like: Palehound, Sidney Gish, and Oompa.\n\nSocial Media Links:\n\nInstagram: @pitstainband\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pitstainband/\n\nElliot Wren is an 18-year-old emerging Indie pop singer-songwriter who hails from the Boston area.\n\nElliot Wren’s music takes you on a journey through their experiences with their raw lyrics and expressive sound. Elliot reveals their substantive soul through the lyrics and arrangements they write and the ease at which they capture your heart.\n\nElliot Wren has been fortunate to have been an artist on the All You Got Tour for the 2019 season, Countdown To Christmas Concert in Celebration, FL, and First Night Boston in Copley Square. Whether they are performing at a larger venue or smaller more intimate venue, Elliot is always excited to meet new people and share their music. Elliot Wren plays festivals, coffeehouses, microbreweries, and bars/pubs in New England. They can be found weekly playing at open mics at all the well-known venues in the Boston area or rehearsing in the Strega Studios in Brighton. As an 18-year-old solo artist, Elliot Wren has had the pleasure of playing with some of the incredible local music artists on the Boston music scene. Look for more DIY collaborations and new music coming out this spring.\n\nQWIMB Q&A with Elliot Wren\n\nQ What brought you to Boston?\n\nA For me, music was always a way to express myself when I didn’t have much else. Whether it was singing or writing, it was a way for me to cope because I never really fit in growing up. I was always different and singled out, and the music was just my way of dealing with it. It probably saved my life if I am being honest.\n\nQ What’s one message you would give to young queer music artists just getting into the music scene?\n\nA It’s going to be hard but my honest advice is to just be who you are. Don’t try to be someone you aren’t. People will see you being authentic and will respect you for that and eventually you’ll find the people who will support and love both you and your music.\n\nQ Are there any artists who you look up to or who have inspired your own music?\n\nA One of my biggest inspirations is Hayley Kiyoko. She is an incredibly talented queer music artist who changed a lot for the LGBTQ community and musicians. I have followed her music career for a long time now.\n\nQ Do you think things are getting better for queer performers or are there still barriers to overcome?\n\nA There are definitely still barriers to overcome and there probably always will be but as long as we continue working to break down barriers it will keep getting easier. One of the best ways to help in this process is to actively support other queer music artists on social media and by attending shows. I love the DIY music scene and the opportunities to highlight the diverse talent in this city.\n\nQ When do your ideas for songs come to you?\n\nA It’s been at the weirdest times and because of the weirdest things. I’ve written songs in the car while my mom drove (safety first), at friends’ homes, at performance venues before a show, you name it. Most of the time though, it’s late at night after everyone’s asleep that I get my best ideas. I end up writing them all in my notes and coming back to it in the morning.\n\nQ Describe your creative process.\n\nA I will start with a song idea, usually a concept of the type of song I want to write or a line idea. I then grab my guitar and will play the chords that come to mind initially. After that, it’s usually a stream of consciousness. After that, I will go back and clean up the chords and the lyrics I have written. Once it’s all cleaned up and I have a first version of the new song, I will send it to my manager and if it ends up getting shortlisted for recording, it will go through some slight changes before actually being recorded in the studio.\n\nQ Have you ever dealt with anxiety about going on stage?\n\nA Oh absolutely. I just try to take a couple of deep breaths and I remind myself that I will be fine. I have to consciously remind myself that people are there to support me and even if I do mess up a chord or something, I can grow from the experience and hopefully never repeat it. One thing’s for sure, in live music anything can happen, but that’s part of the fun.\n\nElliot’s New Single, RIP My Diary, Out Friday February 21, 2020\n\nCheck out their new video for RIP My Diary on Youtube.\n\nElliot Wren Online Presence:\n\nFacebook –https://www.facebook.com/elliotwrenmusic\n\nInstagram – @elliotwrenmusicofficial\n\nTwitter – @Elliot_Wren\n\nWebsite: https://www.elliotwrenmusic.com\n\nFor more information, please contact peggy@stregamarketing.com.\n\nHegemonix is the solo experimental electronic pop project of Ava Vex.

I started making and recording music to experiment with sound and also to explore my identity and relation to the world around me, which I’m still doing.\n\nAre there any artists that you look up to or who have inspired your own music?\n\nThere are a couple of cis male musicians who have influenced me sonically for a while like Aphex Twin, David Bowie and Beck but right now I find a lot of female and trans pop musicians like Sophie, Charli XCX and Black Dresses to be inspiring in terms of exploring identity and sound in new and exciting ways.\n\nDo you think things are getting better for Queer performers or are there still barriers to overcome?\n\nI think things are getting better in terms of there being more widespread acceptance and understanding of trans and gender non-conforming identities but also there’s still work to be done to diversify fields like music production and live sound tech.\n\nWhat has been your proudest moment performing music or as a musician in general?\n\nMy performances over the past year of being more openly queer and trans have been great and very inspiring for me and others from what I can tell.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a queer woman thinking about starting a band or learning an instrument?\n\nPersonally I would say experiment and keep trying to find what works, just like I would say to people who are exploring their gender identity, there are no wrong answers, just options\n\nAre there any other current or former bands or solo artists you would like to see featured by QWIMB?\n\nButch Baby or Prior Panic?\n\nCheck Out More From Hegemonix:\n\nHegemonix on Bandcamp: https://hegemonix.bandcamp.com\n\nSoundCloud: soundcloud.com/hegemonix\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/2lqBThCgLAeJZvJ5Fk9hXX?si=rq_0RWRwQ1KQscefFAWR1g\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPzL-zWjxPKhqEqaay9KhjQ\n\nHere’s the link to the newest EP: “The Revolution Will Not Be Tweeted EP” https://hegemonix.bandcamp.com/album/the-revolution-will-not-be-tweeted-ep\n\nLyrics from the new Hegemonix EP “The Revolution Will Not Be Tweeted”\n\n1. Revolution Is Gay\n\nThis is a double-edged song showing how a violent revolution can devolve into a sort of religiosity with the sing-song ending kind of substituting actual change, sort of an opiate of the masses obfuscating systemic changes. I imagined it as a queer Fight Club kind of revolt, like cis guys realizing their repressed gay and trans yearnings and finding solidarity in having gay sex instead of beating each other up in a masochistic display of irrelevance. Also for the record I don’t think Marx is wrong (that’s the narrator of the song speaking) although not entirely right but a useful figure to consider when approaching societal change and the emancipatory potential of labor.\n\nWell we burned all the factories tonight\n\nRan out in the street and had a fight\n\nPitting ourselves against one another\n\nHey man are you still my brother?\n\nThe police showed up and made a scene\n\nArresting us while we were peeing\n\nOn a monument of our boss\n\nGuess it’s a symbol of our loss\n\nI don’t care\n\nAnymore\n\nRevolution is here\n\nWe’re all queer\n\nWell I’m sitting in a jail cell alright\n\nTalking to my comrades about our plight\n\nWorking class rebellion is the best\n\nAs long as you can pay the cost\n\nThe robot guards are on our asses\n\nTelling us we’re unemployed masses\n\nThe revolt didn’t work and now we’re dead\n\nThis is the afterlife instead\n\nAll the time\n\nWe were lied to\n\nMarx taught us wrong\n\nEverything is a song\n\nSing for your life\n\nDon’t be scared of the cause\n\nChange everything\n\nOpen up all your thoughts\n\nFree love is here\n\nIf you want to be saved\n\nTrust in the sound\n\nOf your golden voice\n\nLyrics from the new Hegemonix EP “The Revolution Will Not Be Tweeted”\n\n2. White Lies\n\nThis is a song that I wrote one morning after reading about the the Tulsa race riots, which I recommend reading up on here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot\n\nIt’s been called “the single worst incident of racial violence in American history” as white authorities decimated what was then the most prosperous Black community in the U.S. I felt inspired to write the song to explore how racist systemic police violence is still very alive as we all know and to speak to how fundamentally violent the state is above and beyond supposedly “violent criminals.” I included a quote from the amazing Angela Davis from this interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIDgDFvyeS8&t=8s\n\nI was wary about releasing this song at first because it’s written from a place of purposeful ignorance, a somewhat conscious citizen who insights violence without considering the racial dynamics of the situation. I just want to clarify that I don’t directly believe what’s stated as “I” statements in these songs but rather wanted to illustrate a somewhat flawed point of view that might be the more common understanding of such events as peddled to us by the mainstream media.\n\nWoke up this morning\n\nWith tears in my eyes\n\nI couldn’t see through\n\nAll of the lies\n\nHundreds dead in\n\nThe city tonight\n\nPolice killing whoever\n\nThey like\n\nWe must maintain\n\nLaw and order\n\nTo have a story\n\nFor the reporters\n\nThe citizens have\n\nGotten unruly\n\nTime to show\n\nThe power of cruelty\n\nWhite lies\n\nBlack lives\n\nViolence lives\n\nIn hearts and minds\n\nThey say that it’s\n\nA story in history\n\nSo why is it such\n\nA big mystery\n\nBlack citizens\n\nKilled for resisting\n\nWhite powers\n\nStill insisting\n\nWe’re making\n\nA movie about it\n\nPromotional\n\nResponses are rabid\n\nProfiting off\n\nTragedy like this\n\nIs how we respect\n\nWhoever resists\n\nWe like\n\nBad times\n\nStories thrive\n\nThat surprise\n\nAngela Davis:\n\n“Because of the way\n\nThis society is organized\n\nBecause of the violence\n\nThat exists on the surface everywhere\n\nYou have to expect that\n\nThere are going to be such explosions\n\nYou have to expect things\n\nLike that as reactions\n\nIf you are black person\n\nWho lives and walks out\n\nOn the street everyday\n\nSeeing white policemen Surrounding you”\n\nWhatever man\n\nRace is dead\n\nViolence is fine\n\nAs long as it’s mine\n\nLyrics from the new Hegemonix EP “The Revolution Will Not Be Tweeted”\n\n3. Ode to the End\n\nHaha the big finale and definitely the opposite of what I believe. This song is complete resignation and acceptance of the hegemonic order of understanding, that nothing can change and we should just accept societal decay and environmental collapse. No! Maybe there’s some acceptance towards the end of the song though, like transcendance through giving up and being born anew as an empty subject ready for sustenance through revolution, circling back to the first song on the EP. Shout out to Julian and the Strokes for inspiring this song and the first one, big inspiration and definitely someone whose fighting for truth in the face of lies and deception. Keep up the good fight and I hope you enjoy reading my lyrics and commentary!\n\nEndless wars\n\nBurning Earth\n\nWe’re not gonna win\n\nAnymore\n\nThe climate is done\n\nIt’s all a hoax\n\nLike the moon landing\n\nHe says as he smokes\n\nOn a cigar\n\nHe bought from a store\n\nDown the street\n\nNext to the prison\n\nWhere they keep those\n\nWho do not fit\n\nInto the state’s\n\nDefinition of a citizen\n\nHe wants you to cum\n\nBut you don’t care\n\nBecause you are\n\nSo debanoire\n\nPart of the queer\n\nVanguard of hope\n\nThat will help us\n\nSlacken the rope\n\nAll the\n\nTime you spent\n\nIs not\n\nGone\n\nIt’s just part of\n\nExperience\n\nThat helps you\n\nMove on\n\nAre you not\n\nEntertained\n\nAnymore\n\nIs this not\n\nWhat you asked\n\nFor\n\nWhat is this trauma\n\nProcessing grief\n\nActor plays parts\n\nReading out lines\n\nI’m calling cut\n\nRedo the shot\n\nIt was all wrong\n\nSo I walk out\n\nThis movie is fucked\n\nThe plot is so bad\n\nIt’s going nowhere\n\nNow we’re all bored\n\nTalk to my shrink\n\nWho says hold on\n\nFind a new cast\n\nRewrite the ending\n\nHe wants a cut\n\nOf all the profits\n\nWithholds my pills\n\nUntil I sign off\n\nOf course I agree\n\nI’m not a fool\n\nCompromise\n\nIs my golden rule\n\nFinally\n\nThe grand\n\nPremiere\n\nWe’re all here\n\nThe audience\n\nJust loves it\n\nAs they clap\n\nOn cue\n\nAre you not\n\nEntertained\n\nAnymore\n\nIs this not\n\nWhat you asked\n\nFor\n\nOh\n\nThe end\n\nMy friend\n\nOnce again\n\nOh\n\nThe end\n\nBegin\n\nPretend\n\nCatch their next show at Outpost 186 on 2/14/20 with Fen Rotstein and Expletive.\n\nFen is a Latinx Jewish Trans woman making music and organizing shows in the greater Boston area. Known for a diverse body of work and a penchant for the weird, she’s found Boston to be immensely supportive, with a great deal of potential growth for its various scenes.\n\nShe got her start in the music industry at a young age playing to audiences around the country during the early days of the Brony fandom. Despite reservations and difficulties in a notoriously conservative scene, she was ultimately inspired by this burgeoning global creative network, and made use of her talents as a multi-instrumentalist and her years of classical vocal training to produce a wide body of work for the community in a variety of genres and styles.\n\nFen would go on to build a home and a network in Boston, MA, precisely the environment needed to spark a new burst of inspiration, both musically and emotionally. Through her Berklee education, Fen further developed a wide breadth of expertise covering composition, arranging, studio production, and engineering. And through her involvement in the local Rap, Rock, and Electronic scenes in Boston, she continues to explore vast musical landscapes, and hopes to increase her creative output and uplift the Boston music scene, a community that has supported her for years.\n\nQWIMB Q&A with Fen Rotstein\n\nWhat brought you to Boston?\n\nI originally headed out to Boston for school, but I’ve stayed here for the incredible music scene and the lovely queer community. It feels incredible to live in a city large and diverse enough for real connections to be made across various social, sexual, racial, and class-related boundaries; even more incredible to live in a city that’s also small enough for cross-city communities to become tight-knit, to grow while remaining close. Of course, the city and its various scenes have a whole lot of problems to work on, but there’s already such incredible momentum towards a better Boston; I’m overjoyed to get to stick around and see things develop!\n\nHave you experienced a strong scene for Queer women in the city in terms of music/performers etc?\n\nWhile it may not be the biggest scene in the world, queer women are absolutely leading it! Boston music and queer women are inextricably linked; the best organizers, the busiest and most successful musicians, the hardest working and most stunning artists…they’re all queer women out here! To see someone like Brandie Blaze, or Dez Decarlo, take off and really shine…it’s just incredible; their hard work in the Boston scene makes that possible. It feels like we’re at the start of a new chapter for queer women in Boston.\n\nDo you have any sense of a history of a Queer scene in the city?\n\nI’ll be frank, being a relatively newer voice in the Boston scene, it’s hard for me to draw upon my own personal experience to give an idea of the history of queer music in Boston. However, I think its safe to say that a relevant chapter in this history is being written right now. More queer women are standing up every day, more black voices are being heard and celebrated, more safe spaces are opening up. An explosion of rap, rock, and electronic music lead by queer women is waiting to happen as we speak!\n\nWhat made you decide to join a band?\n\nWhile I’ve been working as a musician in one way or another, either solo or in a band, for around 10 years now, I found myself primarily doing solo work from the get go here in Boston. After a few years of solo work, I eventually came to the conclusion that collaborating and exploring music with a team of people might be exactly what I needed to progress, both within the scene and within the narrative of my own musical development. I started joining and/or starting bands here and there, and now I’m happy to say that I’m playing with Violet Not, and Pregnancy Mask; 2 rad bands filled with lovely people~\n\nAre there any artists that you look up to or who have inspired your own music?\n\nOh most certainly! it’s easy to rattle off obvious influences, I mean I could hardly avoid mentioning Nine Inch Nails, or The Gorillaz, or Phy Life Cypher, or Aphex Twin, but ultimately, I think it’s always a bit more interesting to talk about what someone’s listening to when they’re walking home from work, or going to the grocery store. To that end, I’ve been listening to a lot of The Garden, Japanese Breakfast, Soweto Kinch, Ollie Byrd, and Pieta Brown— Really solid releases, songs that bring a sense of healing that I think is somewhat lost from a lot of what’s on the radio these days.\n\nDo think things are getting better for Queer performers or are there still barriers to overcome?\n\nI don’t really think those two things are mutually exclusive; there will always be barriers, but things are improving! More and more queer people are finding themselves accessing fame and mainstream artistic success that has never been known by the out queer people of generations past. Large parts of the US government are, on a federal, state, and local level, fighting hard to reduce our liberties as members of the LGBT community, and the damage being done is undeniable. From the place of privilege that many of us, myself included, find ourselves in, it can be easy to forget that countless queer people are living day-to-day, facing homelessness, poverty, starvation, constant and active threats…the struggle is absolutely real, particularly for the Black people and POC that make up the most significant parts of our communities. But the tide is turning, and legitimate positive change is being made on a societal level; bigotry is increasingly difficult in a world wherein people are personally familiar and supportive of queer people and the LGBT community. This is the role that music and other forms of art and media can play in our liberation.\n\nWhat has been your proudest moment performing music or as a musician in general?\n\nThat’s definitely the toughest question for me out of all of these. For me, my musical career has felt and continues to feel like a never ending quest of growth and creative output; proud moments come and go, good performances are followed by bad performances are followed by great performances. Playing to crowds of a thousand or more, going on national tours, these are all definitely accomplishments I’m proud of, but I think my favorite moments in my musical life have been found while teaching. Teaching music and having the chance to feel like I’m helping people better understand music, even themselves, is possibly one of the most cathartic things I get to experience. Is it super corny? Oh most definitely.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a queer woman thinking about starting a band or learning an instrument?\n\nPick something up, anything that speaks to you. Block out naysayers, build your support network. Find your home, your family, and your practice space. Once you’ve got that, all you need to do is practice, and to build your relationships. The best thing about being queer, about being a woman, even in these tough times, is plain and simple: you have every reason to be friends, partners, bandmates, and family with your sisters. We can build, but only with each other; there’s nothing that will help you more than reaching out to the people around you, building relationships, and giving yourself to the art you love, no matter what form it takes. The first, most difficult step is allowing yourself to love something without shame. Once you’ve got that love, nothing can stop you.\n\nAre there any other current or former bands or solo artists you would like to see featured by QWIMB?\n\nOh for sure; right off the bat, y’all should contact Dez Decarlo and Brandie Blaze, and the bands WIMP and Ansonia! They’re lovely people and performers all around, and they most certainly deserve the attention. There’s a whole lot of amazing and talented queer women in Boston; people with real roots in the scene, like Dez for example, act as an inspiration to many of us. There may not appear to be a scene packed to the brim with queer women, but there are so many of us slowly rising to the surface. I wouldn’t be too surprised to see things blow up in the next year or two. If you’re at all concerned about finding great queer artists, I can confidently say, you’ve got nothing to worry about~\n\nFor more on Fen, read Fen’s Interview with Boston Hassle\n\nYou can find the FEN Instagram and Facebook here: https://www.instagram.com/ohfenfen/ | https://www.facebook.com/ohfenfen/\n\nYou can find the Pregnancy Mask Instagram and Facebook here: https://www.instagram.com/pregnancymask/ | https://www.facebook.com/pregnancymask/\n\nYou can find the FEN soundcloud here: http://soundcloud.com/ohfenfen\n\nFEN’s band, Pregnancy Mask has a new album coming out soon!
