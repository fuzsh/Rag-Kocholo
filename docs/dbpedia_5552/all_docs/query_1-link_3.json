        "text": "Are you starting to get bored by your own Spotify playlists, or are you struggling to find some new music? Well, in that case, you’ve come to the right place. These queer and lesbian artists will satisfy your ears!\n\nEveryone loves listening to music. It’s a way to escape your everyday life or spice it up. And who doesn’t love walking down the street pretending you’re in a movie while music plays through your headphones?\n\nHowever, as a lesbian, I can’t always recognize myself in songs, so I love listening to queer female singers and lesbian artists. Their women love women songs are relatable in a way that other songs are just not.\n\nListening to a lesbian musician share her own experiences with other women hits another level. Besides that, it always feels good to be seen and recognized.\n\nYou have to check out this list of over 27 queer female and lesbian singers! But I assure you there are many more, and this list could go on forever (lucky us, we live in exciting times!).\n\nLesbian Artists You Should Listen To\n\nHayley Kiyoko\n\nPerhaps one of the most famous lesbian singers is Hayley Kiyoko. I mean, which lesbian doesn’t know lesbian celebrity Hayley Kiyoko, right?\n\nIf you don’t, that’s fine. I’m just revoking your gay card. I’m only kidding, don’t worry. You might know Hayley from the film Lemonade Mouth (2011) instead.\n\nHayley has been singing and acting from a very young age. She got famous at five years old, which coincidentally was around the same time she found out she likes girls.\n\nHayley found out she was a lesbian when she was very young. Her music tells her personal story and addresses the emotions of figuring out your orientation.\n\nThis lesbian musician also wants to normalize lesbian relationships in a music industry that is still very heteronormative.\n\n“Girls Like Girls” is probably still one of Hayley’s best and gayest songs. Of course, you can also find “Girls Like Girls” on our list with the best lesbian songs.\n\nKehlani\n\nKehlani’s career started as a member of the teen pop band PopLyfe when she was only 14 years old.\n\nSome of you have probably seen her in the sixth season of America’s Got Talent, where the group finished in fourth place.\n\nIn the following years, she was homeless and went through a rough time. She stole iPhones to sell to get by.\n\nHer life got completely turned around when she dropped her first solo track on SoundCloud named “ANTISUMMERLUV.” And Nick Cannon bought her an apartment in Los Angeles and studio time.\n\nIn 2017, Kehlani dropped “Honey,” a song about being in a relationship with another woman, after she came out as queer.\n\nKehlani says her art mimics her life, so it only makes sense for her to also sing about these topics.\n\nIn 2018, Kehlani felt she had to come out again as queer in a series of tweets because of her ടexuality after making out on stage with Demi Lovato. In 2021, Kehlani came out as a lesbian.\n\nMelissa Etheridge\n\nMelissa Etheridge is one of the oldest famous lesbian singers on this list.\n\nShe might be a lesbian musician more for the older generations, but what’s a list about famous lesbian artists without her on it?\n\nMelissa’s career started in the late 1980s, playing pop-based folk-rock in lesbian bars in L.A. Naturally, there were rumors about her identity because of this.\n\nSo in 1993, Melissa decided to come out. There was still so much taboo around being gay back then, but she stood her ground and became a prominent LGBTQ+ activist in the following years.\n\nIn 2011, she got a well-deserved star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nToday, Melissa is over 60 years old and still makes music. Being so open about her orientation from very early on in her career paved the way for many gay female singers today.\n\n“I’m the Only One” was on her album released the same year she came out.\n\ngirl in red\n\nMarie Ulven, better known as girl in red, is a Norwegian indie-pop singer-songwriter.\n\nShe started writing songs and playing the guitar when she was 14. All of this happened in her bedroom, which she still does today.\n\nHer first song, “I wanna be your girlfriend,” which came out in 2016, immediately gave away that she’s a lesbian music artist, and she doesn’t shy away from this at all.\n\nYoung teenage lesbians love her, as they relate to her songs about mental health and loving girls.\n\nIn 2019, she was named a queer icon by Paper Magazine, which makes me excited about her future.\n\nLesbian TikTok has helped her songs gain more popularity. My personal favorite gayest song of girl in red is “girls.”\n\nLP\n\nYou probably know L.P.’s music! Laura Pergolizii, professionally known as L.P., was called an ‘overnight sensation’ when their song ‘Muddy Waters’ was featured during the fourth season of the lesbian Netflix show ‘Orange Is the New Black.’\n\nThough, L.P. has been making music for many years. They became famous worldwide after releasing the song ‘Lost on You.’ The official music video has over 550 million views!! How amazing is that! Their voice is simply fantastic, and their style is effortlessly cool.\n\nL.P. has also written many hits for other artists like Rihanna, Leona Lewis, Céline Dion, Cher, Christina Aguilera, and the Backstreet Boys. In an interview, L.P. said they identify as lesbian and gender-neutral.\n\nBrandy Clark\n\nOne genre of music that lacks queer people is country music.\n\nThis genre of music is about telling stories of ordinary people and that feeling of coming home, which isn’t something relatable to all of us.\n\nHowever, there are quite some lesbian country singers out there.\n\nBrandy Clark is a lesbian country singer who is a well-respected gay female country singer among country music fans.\n\nBefore releasing her album, she wrote many hit songs for people like Kacey Musgraves and Sheryl Crow. Her songs are about home, small towns, and heartbreak.\n\nBrandy has always been an out lesbian. And if anyone was surprised by the amount of love and support she received from the country music community, it was the lesbian artist herself.\n\nYou can listen to her song “Love Can Go To Hell” from her Grammy-nominated album Big Day in a Small Town here.\n\nYoung M.A\n\nKatorah Marrero, better known as Young M.A, is a queer rapper and entrepreneur.\n\nThe M.A. in her name stands for Me Always. From the start of her career in 2012, Young M.A has been open about her orientation and being one of not many Black lesbian music artists.\n\nHowever, in 2019 she decided to no longer self-identify as a lesbian and stated that she doesn’t do labels, although she wouldn’t date men.\n\nYoung M.A raps about similar topics as the men in the industry, like identity and wealth.\n\nShe also thinks that her music shouldn’t just be about her orientation but about bringing people closer together.\n\nBesides rapping, she keeps being busy with other things too. In 2018, she directed her first lesbian movie called The Gift.\n\nShe is also the founder of the KWEENZ foundation, which helps people in East New York overcome the trauma and grief that come with the loss of a loved one.\n\nHer most famous song with more than 320 million streams on Spotify is called “OOOUUU.”\n\nZolita\n\nZoë Montana Hoetzel, better known as Zolita, is an American lesbian singer-songwriter. She stands out on this list with gay artists not only for her music but also for her amazing lesbian music videos.\n\nLesbian music videos that she directed herself! The first one that went viral on YouTube is called ‘Exploടion.’\n\nAnd the lesbian song and music video, ‘Somebody I F*cked Once,’ was launched at the end of 2021. Which quickly had over 29 million views!\n\nZolita’s music blends dark pop and R&B, and her lyrics are usually about her experiences as a queer woman. Her music is a must-listen! And don’t forget to watch her music videos on lesbian YouTube.\n\nKing Princess\n\nKing Princess, whose real name is Mikaela Mullaney Straus, rose to fame not so long ago. A music label wanted to sign her at eleven years old. But since King Princess didn’t have a clear definition of her music, she didn’t sign.\n\nIn 2018, she found that definition when the lesbian singer released her song “1950,” a tribute to the lesbian book The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith, the LGBTQ+ community, and queer love.\n\nHer song reached a broader audience when Harry Styles tweeted a lyric from the song.\n\nKing Princess doesn’t want her music placed in the “queer pop” box. Instead, she wants her lesbian music to be held to the same standard as straight artists, even when she sings about queer relationships.\n\nHer gayest song is probably “Puടടy is God.”\n\nSyd\n\nSyd, formerly known as Syd Tha Kyd, is a songwriter, singer, and D.J. from Los Angeles. Syd’s (full name Sydney) younger brother gave her the stage name Syd Tha Kyd, but at some point, she felt she grew out of the name, and now she’s just Syd.\n\nThe openly gay female singer was a member of the alternative hip-hop collective Odd Future, making her the only woman and openly gay member of the group. In 2016, she announced her departure from Off Future, and in 2017, she released her first solo single, ‘All About Me,’ which is a must-listen!\n\nSyd is also part of the American band The Internet. The band’s music blends hip-hop, R&B, funk, jazz, and electronic dance music!\n\nQueer & lesbian fashion: how to dress like a lesbian?\n\nFletcher\n\nWhat’s a list with queer and lesbian artists without Fletcher on it?!\n\nBorn Cari Elise Fletcher, Fletcher began taking vocal lessons at five years old. As an independent artist, her addition to Spotify in 2016 catapulted her career into a success.\n\nIn 2018, she dropped the independent artist label and signed with Capitol Records. Her music video for “Wasted Youth,” which came out in 2017, got people talking about her identity.\n\nShe hangs around on a night out with lesbian YouTuber Shannon Beveridge in the music video.\n\nShannon was Fletcher’s girlfriend, but they broke up in 2020. Straight people have said the relationship between the two women in the video is never defined, even though the two kiss.\n\nNewsflash: they’re not just gal pals.\n\nFletcher has said in interviews that she doesn’t label herself. She identifies herself within the LGBTQ+ community, but she thinks that ടexuality is a spectrum.\n\nAnd she feels more comfortable saying she loves whom she loves and is attracted to.\n\nGo listen and watch “Wasted Youth” yourself!\n\nTegan and Sara\n\nTegan and Sara are a Canadian indie pop lesbian band consisting of, surprisingly, Tegan and Sara. They are twins, and both identify as lesbian.\n\nThey’ve been around for a while, but I think it’s important to mention them on this list with lesbian artists because they’ve always been out as lesbian music artists since their career started, which was back in 1998.\n\nA few years after Melissa Etheridge came out, being gay was still taboo and not widely accepted.\n\nHowever, Tegan and Sara never shied away from their orientation in their songs.\n\nTheir debut album already had songs written about what it is like to be lesbian.\n\nIn 2016, the two founded the Tegan and Sara Foundation, which funds projects for queer women and girls, such as LGBTQ+ summer camps and counseling services for indigenous youth.\n\nMany will probably recognize a song from the new lesbian series The L Word Generation Q is “Closer.” They also play in some lesbian scenes of the original The L Word.\n\nTegan and Sara’s band is one of the Canadian lesbian bands you should listen to!\n\nVictoria Monét\n\nNot only Victoria Monét’s music is fantastic, but she has also written songs for other notable artists like Janelle Monáe, Coco Jones, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, Nas, and Fifth Harmony.\n\nIn 2018, Victoria Monét came out as bi on Twitter, and she has said to be proud to be part of a new wave of queer female musicians.\n\nTo Gay Times, she said she’s done hiding her queerness, and she wants to be a visible role model for many generations to come. I love that!\n\nIn 2019, Victoria’s solo career took off when she released the single ‘Monopoly’ with Ariana Grande and her song ‘Ass Like That.’ The following year, her album ‘Jaguar’ came out!\n\n27 types of lesbians: which type of lesbian are you?\n\nPVRIS\n\nThis one is for the lesbian rockers! PVRIS is an American rock band whose lead vocalist is Lynn Gunn, who’s a lesbian.\n\nThis lesbian band, or well, lesbian-fronted band, was started in 2013. The band sounds like many musical genres, such as alternative rock with electropop, post-hardcore, psychedelic, EDM, and synth-pop.\n\nLynn is an evident lesbian rock artist.
