        "text": "Holly Charman\n\n26.03.21\n\nWho are your people? What does it mean to belong to a group – a nation, family, political solidarity or fan culture?\n\nAs we carry on fighting for our basic freedoms in many countries around the world, music continues to inform, inspire and – above everything else – unite us all.\n\n– Darryl W. Bullock, David Bowie Made Me Gay (2017)\n\nThe word “queer” opens beauty’s floodgates, enables a serious consideration of aesthetics. We are not the enemies of beauty. We want to speak, at last, about the beautiful.\n\n– Wayne Koestenbaum in Queering The Pitch (2006)\n\nAlthough the Stonewall Riots of 1969 are often marked as the ‘age of empowerment’ for queer people, queer musicians had been making significant noise long before this. From Billy Strayhorn to Ma Rainey to David Bowie, LGBTQ+ musicians have made notable contributions to music and culture over the years. More poignant than their contribution to the larger music scene, however, is the impact that their music has on its listeners.\n\nMusic can help individuals to establish, develop and negotiate a sense of self. As Jodie Taylor writes in Playing it Queer, ‘regardless of whether a person is a maker, performer or consumer of music, music contributes – in great significance – to our identity work’. This is true for queer people; music has long been a site of self-identification where we can better understand and shape our identities. We can define this, as Taylor does, as a ‘queer tactic of survival’. Through music, ‘queer bodies, subjectivities, desires and social relations [are] performed’ and, in turn, demand space in our heteronormative cultural landscapes. To borrow from the iconic Sylvester hit, music can therefore make one feel ‘mighty real’ – seen, heard, understood and empowered in an otherwise heteronormative world.\n\nWhether it is performed or experienced, music also transcends what Taylor terms the ‘regularity of the everyday’; the already transcendent form of music easily gives itself to those whose existence also transcends the regular. After all, music can be queer: it speaks to that which is beyond the normal and ‘signifies that which is often invisible’. I am reminded here of producer and Avant-EDM icon SOPHIE, whose transcendent hyper-real music built worlds outside of our own. These worlds are not defined through binaries or societal expectations, but through fluid expression and no restrictions. SOPHIE’s music looks forward; it heralds the future and speaks to new and limitless realities, allowing individuals to establish and negotiate their own identities in the “real” world. Jessica Dunn Rovinelli puts it best in her touching tribute to SOPHIE:\n\n‘In these oh-so-fake but oh-so-physical sounds, I found a place I could exist. It didn’t matter if I was a “real woman” to myself or others, what mattered was that these textures were a space I could make my own, […] This music rejects hierarchies of polyphony and harmony to set sound free – and, in turn, it sets our bodies and genders loose as well. It compels us to dance into a future where life is worth living.’\n\nOn this note, SOPHIE’s hyperkinetic music overtly breaks musical and heteropatriarchal boundaries. This is similar to Janelle Monae’s masterful album (and accompanying film) Dirty Computer, which builds a queer-positive and afrofuturistic utopia through their signature ‘energized retro-futuristic sound’ – a sound that, reminiscent of Sylvester’s affirming ‘mighty real’ lyrics, makes queers feel “so good [and] so fucking real.”\n\nBut this has not always been the case for LGBTQ+ artists. As Wayne Kestenbam writes,\n\n‘Historically, music has been designed as mystery and miasma, as implicitness rather than explicitness, and so we have hid inside music: in music we can come out without coming out, we can reveal without saying a word.’\n\nAs a young queer person, I would search for these implicit lyrics, or listen to “genderbent” covers of songs, to find a trace of the queerness that I recognized in myself and those around me (Darryl Bullock was right when he explains that hearing a song you connect to is like ‘having a comforting hug from a friend’). However, true representation felt limited – perhaps because much of it was hidden behind this ‘mystery and miasma’. You can imagine, then, the child-like joy I experience(d) when a growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ artists meant that ambiguous lyrics and coded music became a thing of the past.\n\nThis shift began – in my timeline – in 2015, but there was a palpable increase in ‘out’ and mainstream female, nb and trans artists in 2018. This is not to say that there was no queer representation or queer artists in pop (or elsewhere) before this, just that there was a significant shift in their exposure and the attitude towards these artists. Thus, captured in the playful #20GAYTEEN hashtag made popular by artist Hayley Kiyoko, 2018 seems to be the year where much of the ‘mystery and miasma’ associated with queer music disappears. Queerness, in other words, began to ‘shed its otherness within the mainstream sphere’. It was louder and prouder and more accepted than before.\n\nThat being said, implicit queer codes do remain – just in a new, more playful form. For example, artist girl in red became an inside code for queerness in 2020 on TikTok: to ‘listen to girl in red’ was to be not heterosexual.\n\nAlongside girl in red, SOPHIE, Janelle Monae and Hayley Kiyoko, I associate these years with Arlo Parks; L Devine; Carlie Hanson; Joy Oladokun; MUNA; FLETCHER; Kim Petras; MNEK; Tegan & Sara; Raveena; WILLOW; King Princess; Kehlani; Shura; Troye Sivan; MAY-A; Rina Sawayama; Claud; Shamir; YUNGBLUD; Clairo; Frank Ocean; dodie; Ryan Beatty and The Internet to name a few(!!!), but this is – of course – a movement made up of more people than can be listed, over a long period of time, enabled by an even longer list of LGBTQ+ people who came before. What is most important, though, is that these artists’ music would have helped someone to navigate their own queerness – at most, it helped me navigate mine.\n\nOf course, there is still a way to go in terms of representing those outside of the white, cis, abled artists that have much of our attention at present. It is nice to know, however, that for queer kids growing up in 2021, music is waiting for them – and remains an invaluable tool for exploring and negotiating the self. After all, this is what music should be: a ‘comforting hug from a friend’ that welcomes you to you.\n\nCheck out our nawr playlist inspired by this blog here.\n\nSources\n\nDaisy Jones, ‘How 2018 Became the Year 20GAYTEEN’, Vice (2018), https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvqw8d/how-2018-became-the-year-20gayteen\n\nDarryl W.
