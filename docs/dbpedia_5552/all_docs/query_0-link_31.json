        "text": "Acclaimed Canadian indie-pop sibling duo and LGBT activists Tegan and Sara are back with their eighth album, “Love You to Death,” and it’s another superb release by the sisters Quin.\n\nThe album is released on Neil Young’s Vapor Records label and was produced by Greg Kurstin, most recently known as the co-writer, producer and primary instrumentalist behind Adele’s chart-topping anthem “Hello.”\n\n“Love You to Death” is a continuation of the duo’s embrace of upbeat electronic pop elements. They go for massive hooks, big synths and uber-polished production. Fortunately the 10 tracks are ear candy of the highest order and the duo quite capably pulls off a style you might expect from some hot new European import rather than the veteran indie-pop duo from Canada that was also known for guitar-based work.\n\nTegan and Sara’s version of commercial pop is smart and immediately engaging. Opening track “That Girl,” with its anthemic hook and ultra-modern vibe, sounds like something that may have been considered for a Kelly Clarkson project. “Faint of Heart” is an even more commercial track with a chorus perfectly designed for heavy summertime radio play. Its upbeat, singalong nature practically begs for a bevy of remixes for dance-floor consumption.\n\nIt’s difficult to believe that the gleaming commercial gem “Boyfriend” isn’t Meghan Trainor or Carly Rae Jepsen. Give it to Tegan and Sara for being willing to go on a limb and try something different — in this case it can only be described as Top 40 pop that might be aimed at your average 13 year old. It’s strange to hear the duo in this context, but it’s so catchy and well executed that it just works. It’s fun, peppy and irresistibly catchy.\n\nThe big electro-beats, processed vocals and giant melodic hooks continue on “Dying to Know,” a heavily rhythmic track that again practically demands radio play. There isn’t a song on this collection that wouldn’t sound great on the FM dial blasted on a road trip with the sunroof open and the beach on the horizon. “Stop Desire” is pure Euro-pop, right out of Kylie, Robyn or Goldfrapp’s arsenal of tricks. It’s another dancefloor raver that’s going to sound great on club speakers.\n\n“White Knuckles” is a more mid-tempo jam with lots of vocal effects and treated piano over a heavy backbeat. Like all the songs on “Love You To Death,” the vocals are heavily layered and everything is completely digital, pro-tooled and auto-tuned. So while it does have that artificial modern pop sound, what makes it work is the strength of the songwriting and the charm of the ladies’ vocal performances.\n\nOther standouts include glossy power ballad “100x,” the Pet Shop Boys-esque “BWU” and album closer “Hang On to the Night,” which begins with an orchestral flourish that gives way to a big retro-synth riff and an atmospheric vibe that owes more to bands like O.M.D. and New Order than modern pop.\n\n“Love You to Death” is electronic pop that’s smart, catchy and compact. At only 31 minutes, the album is a quick listen, but it doesn’t feel like we’re shortchanged. Each of the self-penned song is a potential single. Some artists have tried to make the leap from more alternative-edged indie-pop to mainstream pop with decidedly mixed results (Liz Phair comes to mind), but Tegan and Sara makes it work.\n\nBands and solo artists of all different genres are visiting D.C. this spring. Patti LaBelle and Gladys Knight will team up to perform at the Wolf Trap in June, and girl in red will play at the Anthem in April. Some artists and bands aren’t paying a visit until the summer, like Janet Jackson and Usher, but there are still plenty of acts to see as the weather warms up.\n\nMARCH\n\nBrandi Carlile plays at the Anthem on March 21; Arlo Parks will perform at 9:30 Club on March 23; Girlschool will take the stage at Blackcat on March 28.\n\nAPRIL\n\nNicki Minaj stops in D.C. at Capital One Arena as part of her North American tour on April 1; Bad Bunny plays at Capital One Arena on April 9 as part of his Most Wanted tour; girl in red performs at the Anthem on April 20 and 21; Brandy Clark plays at the Birchmere on April 25; Laufey comes to town to play at the Anthem on April 25 and 26.\n\nMAY\n\nBelle and Sebastian play at the Anthem on May 2; Chastity Belt performs at Blackcat on May 4; Madeleine Peyroux stops at the Birchmere on May 5; The Decemberists play at the Anthem on May 10; the rock band Mannequin Pussy performs at the Atlantis on May 17 and 18; Hozier plays at Merriweather Post Pavilion on May 17 as part of the Unreal Unearth tour.\n\nJUNE\n\nPatti LaBelle and Gladys Knight will sing soulful melodies at Wolf Trap on June 8; Joe Jackson performs at the Lincoln Theatre on June 10; the Pixies and Modest Mouse are teaming up to play at Merriweather Post Pavilion on June 14; Maggie Rogers plays at Merriweather Post Pavilion on June 16 as part of The Don’t Forget Me tour; Brittany Howard headlines the Out & About Festival at Wolf Trap on June 22; Sarah McLachlan plays at Merriweather Post Pavilion on June 27; Alanis Morissette performs at Merriweather Post Pavilion on June 29 and 30\n\nWhen the late, great Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked when there will be enough women on the Supreme Court, her answer was simple: Nine. She stated: “I say when there are nine, people are shocked. But there’d been nine men, and nobody’s ever raised a question about that.” RBG did not attend the Grammy’s last night, but her spirit sure did. Women, at long last, dominated, ruled and killed the night.\n\nCher, in song a decade ago, declared that “this is a woman’s world,” but there was little evidence that was true, Grammy, and entertainment awards, speaking. In 2018, the Grammys were heavily criticized for lack of female representation across all categories and organizers’ response was for women to “step up.”\n\nBe careful what you wish for boys.\n\nThe biggest star of the 2024 Grammys was the collective power of women. They made history, they claimed legacy and they danced and lip sang to each other’s work. Standing victorious was Miley Cyrus, Billie Eilish, SZA (the most nominated person of the year), Lainey Wilson, Karol G, boygenius, Kylie Minogue and Victoria Monét. Oh, yes, and powerhouse Taylor Swift, the superstar from whom Fox News cowers in fear, made history to become the first performer of any gender to win four Best Album of the Year trophies.\n\nIn the throng of these powerful women stand a number of both LGBTQ advocates and queer identifying artists. Cyrus has identified as pansexual, SZA has said lesbian rumors “ain’t wrong,” Phoebe Bridgers (winner of four trophies during the night, most of any artist) is lesbian, Monét is bi and Eilish likes women but doesn’t want to talk about it. Plus, ask any queer person about Swift or Minogue and you are likely to get a love-gush.\n\nWomen power was not just owned by the lady award winners. There were the ladies and then there were the Legends. The first Legend to appear was a surprise. Country singer Luke Combs has a cross-generational hit this year with a cover of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car.” When originally released, the song was embraced as a lesbian anthem. When performing “Fast Car,” surprise, there was Chapman herself, singing the duet with Combs. The rendition was stunning, sentimental and historic.\n\nChapman, like many of the night’s female dignitaries, has not been public with her sexuality. Author Alice Walker has spoken of the two of them being lovers, however.\n\nThe legend among legends of the night, however, was the one and only Joni Mitchell. Not gay herself, she embodies the concept of an LGBTQ icon, and was accompanied by the very out Brandi Carlile on stage. On her website, Mitchell’s statement to the LGBTQ community reads, “The trick is if you listen to that music and you see me, you’re not getting anything out of it. If you listen to that music and you see yourself, it will probably make you cry and you’ll learn something about yourself and now you’re getting something out of it.”\n\nMitchell performed her longtime classic “Both Sides Now.” The emotion, insight and delivery from the now 80-year old artist, survivor of an aneurism, was nothing short of profound. (To fully appreciate the nuance time can bring, check out the YouTube video of a Swift lookalike Mitchell singing the same song to Mama Cass and Mary Travers in 1969.) In this latest rendition, Mitchell clearly had an impact on Meryl Streep who was sitting in the audience. Talk about the arc of female talent and power.\n\nThat arc extended from a today’s lady, Cyrus, to legend Celine Dion as well. Cyrus declared Dion as one of her icons and inspirations early in the evening. Dion appeared, graceful and looking healthy, to present the final, and historic, award of the night at the end of the show.\n\nLegends did not even need to be living to have had an effect on the night. Tributes to Tina Turner and Sinead O’Conner by Oprah, Fantasia Barrino-Taylor and Annie Lennox respectively, proved that not even death could stop these women. As Lennox has musically and famously put it, “Sisters are doing it for themselves.”\n\nEven the content of performances by today’s legends-in-the-making spoke to feminine power. Eilish was honored for, and performed “What Was I Made For?,” a haunting and searching song that speaks to the soul of womanhood and redefinition in today’s fight for gender rights and expression, while Dua Lipa laid down the gauntlet for mind blowing performance with her rendition of “Houdini” at the top of the show, Cyrus asserted the power of her anthem “Flowers” and pretty much stole the show.\n\nCyrus had not performed the song on television before, and only three times publicly. She declared in her intro that she was thrilled over the business numbers the song garnered, but she refused to let them define her. As she sang the hit, she scolded the audience, “you guys act like you don’t know the words to this song.” Soon the woman power of the room was singing along with her, from Swift to Oprah.\n\nThey can buy themselves flowers from now on. They don’t need anyone else. Cyrus made that point with the mic drop to cap all mic drops, “And I just won my first Grammy!” she declared as she danced off stage.\n\nEven the squirmiest moment of the night still did not diminish the light of women power, and in fact, underscored it. During his acceptance of the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, Jay-Z had a bone to pick with the Grammy voters. He called out the irony that his wife Beyoncé had won more Grammys than any other human, but had never won the Best Album of the Year. Yeah, what’s with that?\n\nBut then, it brought additional context ultimately to the fact that the winner of the most Grammys individually … is a woman. And to the fact that the winner of the most Best Album of the Year awards … is a woman.\n\nHopefully this was the night that the Grammys “got it.” Women are the epicenter of The Creative Force.\n\nWill the other entertainment awards get it soon as well? We can hope.\n\nMost importantly, in a political world where women’s healthcare is under siege. Will the American voters get it?\n\nA little known band named Little Mix put it this way in their 2019 song “A Woman’s World.”\n\n“If you can’t see that it’s gotta change\n\nOnly want the body but not the brains\n\nIf you really think that’s the way it works\n\nYou ain’t lived in a woman’s world\n\nJust look at how far that we’ve got\n\nAnd don’t think that we’ll ever stop…”\n\nFrom Grammy’s mouth to the world’s ear."
