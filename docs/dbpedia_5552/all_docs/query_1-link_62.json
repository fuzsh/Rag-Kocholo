        "text": "Music\n\nIn September 2016 Wilson released her debut, the seven-track EP (extended play) H.E.R. Vol. 1. The recording appeared under the name H.E.R., which stands for Having Everything Revealed. Wilson sought to keep her true identity anonymous, because she “want[ed] the people to hear the music for what it is, and not have any judgments or make any assumptions.” However, fans quickly confirmed that H.E.R. was Wilson; they linked a cover of Drake’s “Jungle” that she had performed as Gabriella Wilson to a cover of the same song on the EP. H.E.R. Vol. 1 garnered attention—it peaked at number 12 on Billboard’s R&B albums chart—and was praised for its confessional lyrics. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, H.E.R. said that she wanted “women to really feel how honest and vulnerable I am and to understand that they are not alone and that these are all human emotions.”\n\nAnother EP, H.E.R. Vol. 2, appeared in June 2017. The work—which featured a number of ballads, a staple of her music—also proved popular, and several months later H.E.R. launched her first headlining tour. A self-titled compilation featuring both EPs and a collection of B sides was released in October 2017, and two years later it won the Grammy Award for best R&B album. In addition, the song “Best Part” was named best R&B performance. In 2018 H.E.R. released the EPs I Used to Know Her: The Prelude and I Used to Know Her: Part 2. She also embarked on a tour that year. Her follow-up, a compilation that contained the two EPs with additional songs, appeared in 2019."
