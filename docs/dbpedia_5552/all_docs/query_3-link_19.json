        "text": "Canadian artists are speaking out against anti-trans legislation.\n\nThe Tegan and Sara Foundation has published an open letter signed by some of Canada’s best known musicians and entertainers, including Neil Young, Alanis Morissette, Elliot Page, k.d. lang, Sarah McLachlan, Carly Rae Jepsen and many more. The letter, titled Artists Against Anti-Trans Legislation in Canada, has over 400 signatories. Its publication date, Mar. 31, is also Trans Day of Visibility.\n\nLed by indie pop siblings Tegan and Sara, the open letter is an explicit pushback on recent and in-progress legislation that limits trans rights in several Canadian provinces.\n\n“We are trending towards more harmful anti-trans legislation in Canada, and we call on our communities and local and national policymakers to put a stop to this concerning surge in anti-trans policy,” the letter states.\n\nSaskatchewan and New Brunswick have both implemented policies that require parental consent for educators to use chosen names and preferred pronouns for students under sixteen. In February, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith announced plans for policy changes to LGBTQ+ health care, education and sports, including banning hormonal treatment and puberty blockers for trans youth. Smith’s policies would also require parental consent for students to participate in educational instruction that addresses sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nAt the national level, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has made recent comments indicating he would support banning trans women from women’s sports and washrooms. With a federal election on the horizon, LGBTQ+ rights could face rollbacks across the country.\n\n“Far right groups are tapping into fear and pitting us against each other so they can create a Canada where we’re afraid of difference,” reads the letter. “The government should never put themselves between parents, their kids, and evidence-based healthcare and supports.”\n\nWhile the letter is primarily written to affect change within the country, it also combats the perception of Canada as a human rights haven. “The reality is that Canada is not immune to the global attack on the trans community and their access to inclusive spaces, healthcare and freedoms.” – Rosie Long Decter\n\nIndustry Remembers Trailblazing Booking Agent and Label Executive Pegi Cecconi\n\nPegi (Margaret Anne) Cecconi, a trailblazing Canadian booking agent and record label executive, died on March 28, at age 70. She had been battling PSP (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy).\n\nHer immense impact on the Canadian music industry over almost five decades was rightfully recognized in 2020 when she received the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award at the Juno Awards, only the third woman to have received that prestigious honour.\n\nAn obituary posted by Cecconi’s family on her Facebook page noted, “As social convenor, Pegi booked bands for school dances, an undertaking that required serious grit when dealing with both performers and patrons. It was a quality that prepared her well for her trailblazing career in the male-dominated entertainment industry where she would thrive for almost 50 years.”\n\nFemale booking agents were rare in the 70s when Cecconi started, but she built her name to help establish SRO Management and later the record label Anthem. It started with a small roster spearheaded by Rush and Max Webster, alongside Liverpool and A Foot in Coldwater. Prior to Anthem, Rush was on Moon Records, and the three members, Geddy Lee, Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson, became associate directors of Anthem.\n\nDecades of work with Rush is a clear highlight of Cecconi’s CV. On learning of Cecconi’s death, Rush frontman Geddy Lee posted this salute to Cecconi on Instagram: “Pegi Cecconi – whose laugh could be heard the moment she entered any venue. Thanks Peg, for 50 years of having our backs… wherever you’re headed they ain’t ready for ya!”\n\nOver her long career, Cecconi took prominent roles in some of the Canadian music industry’s major trade organizations. She had long stints on the board of directors of both the Canadian Independent Music Association (CIMA) and The Foundation Assisting Canadian Talent On Recordings (FACTOR), also serving as Chair and Treasurer at the latter. She also served on the Board of MMF Canada, receiving its Brian Chater Pioneers Award in 2015, and held positions with the Independent Digital Licensing Agency (IDLA) and the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency (CMRRA).\n\nEqually important was her invaluable role as a mentor and role model for women wanting to succeed in the male-dominated world of the Canadian music business. Effusive tributes to Cecconi on social media posts in the wake of her passing certainly testify to that.\n\nRead more tributes from all facets of the Canadian industry here. – Kerry Doole"
