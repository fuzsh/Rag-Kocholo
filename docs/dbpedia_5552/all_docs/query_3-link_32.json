        "text": "It is time for business leaders to stand up for transgender and nonbinary youth.\n\nCo-authored by Jessica Halem and Colin Quinn. March 21st, 2023\n\nThe first gender affirming surgery was done 100 years ago. The American Psychiatric Association resolved that homosexuality was not a mental illness 50 years ago. Both watershed moments happened because patients advocated for themselves and medicine adapted. We’re doing it again today.\n\nNow and for the past seven years, many in healthcare have been working to enforce the intent of the historic ruling in the summer of 2016. That’s when the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act prohibiting discrimination in healthcare settings. The Obama and Biden Administrations have since affirmed that the rule includes sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe intent of Section 1557 is not only to ensure the (passive) absence of discrimination in our industry but also the (active) inclusion of safe, accessible, and appropriate healthcare for all people, including gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender patients. But right now best practices in medical care for LGBTQ+ people, specifically those who are transgender and nonbinary are being rolled back in a multi-front, coordinated attack in some locations. We have to see this attack clearly, and fight it soundly.\n\nIn total, 315 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced in state legislatures in the United States in 2022. Of those bills, 29 were signed into law. This year, the numbers are growing and attacks are unrelenting: 420 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have already been proposed this year alone. (Read more in the February 2023 report from Movement Advancement Project (MAP), an independent, nonprofit think tank.) Every time there’s a new headline, concerned and supportive providers, payors, schools, and HR & benefits professionals ask what they can do to ensure quality healthcare is uninterrupted? They want to move forward, not back.\n\nThe promising news is that medical research is on their side. Medically necessary care for adults and youth who are transgender and gender-diverse has been researched and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Psychological Association, and the American Medical Association. These experts – and many more – have spent years putting together a body of work to guide us. We hope everyone will take the time to read from these trusted sources.\n\nAnd, as members of the LGBTQ+ community, and as healthcare leaders, we are here to maximize healthcare access for all, support the understanding of the latest clinical guidelines, share best practices for coverage and patient care, and develop services to navigate people to the care they need when they need it. Debate may continue, but three things must happen.\n\nFirst, the medical experts and community should guide this conversation. They should lead clinical and policy decisions regarding patient care and overall health and wellness. After all, decisions to be made about medical care involve two people: the medical professional and the patient. There are two seats at the table. We can strengthen the conversation that happens there, making sure it’s informed with data, research, and led by providers who are equipped with appropriate training. But those seats belong to patient and medical professional, not politicians.\n\nSecond, transgender medicine must continue to advance, with investment in medical research, data, and clinical training. The medical community reports that providers are woefully underprepared. We have to increase the number of providers in every state who are trained on protocols and best practices like those offered by the The World Professional Association for Transgender Health, to provide high quality, accurate, and affirming care.\n\nThird, employers, people leaders, and organizations can and should play an active role, so employees feel seen and supported, and have access to the benefits they deserve. How, exactly? Businesses can shore up their LGBTQ+ community, while we continue to make the winning arguments to stop these bills, which are uninformed by medical evidence. (We have precedent on our side: 91% of Anti-LGBTQ+ bills proposed failed in 2022 and 24 pro-equality bills were passed). Some ideas:\n\nStrengthen or start an LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group (ERG), and support programming that reaches families with kids who are LGBTQ+.\n\nBe an Ally. Send a message on March 31st for International Transgender Day of Visibility. A short, positive, company-wide email and social media post, like: “This company stands with our transgender and nonbinary employees, their families, and our customers.”\n\nConduct a quick benefits equity assessment to ensure your benefits are inclusive and everyone knows how to use them. Review and revamp Benefits’ Travel Policies so members can take advantage of them as needed, especially now.\n\nContact local and state government officials to express your company’s support for LGBTQ+ people of all ages. Remind them to follow the evidence and medical research from trusted sources.\n\nDo more in your industry. Ask yourself: What can your business and peer businesses uniquely do to champion the rights of all people to express the full range of diversity of gender, families, and relationships?\n\nBottom line: Every American deserves access to safe, high-quality, affirming healthcare - and a workplace that ensures it. If business leaders respect the wisdom of patients and the expertise of medical professionals, they’ll get it.\n\nAuthor Biographies:\n\nColin Quinn serves as the President of Included Health Communities at Included Health. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, he understands firsthand the challenges members of the LGBTQ+ community face navigating the healthcare system. He is passionate about raising care equity for underserved patient populations. He received his undergraduate degree in Finance at Butler University and has an MBA from Stanford’s Graduate School of Business\n\nJessica Halem, MBA, has worked for over two decades in the LGBTQ+ health equity space as the Executive Director of the Lesbian Community Cancer Project in Chicago; the LGBTQ+ Director at Harvard Medical School; Board of Directors of the Tegan and Sara Foundation; and now as the Senior Director of Eidos, the LGBTQ+ Health Initiative at University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAbortion was how I could imagine my Queerness.\n\nLiving and breathing Abortion possibilities meant everything else was possible, too. In questioning the restrictions and shaming of Abortion, you had to get at what the world imagines for women. And if you get at what the world imagines for women, you have to question your sexuality, too. Questioning the category of woman and everything that was tied to it – heterosexual sex, birth, and marriage – is liberating. The promise of abortion releases women from stereotypes about what it means to be a woman. Abortion being controlled by others is the exact same premise as women being controlled by others. Access to abortion on demand and without apology released me from the constraints of womanhood, including heterosexuality. Fighting for Abortion made me Queer.\n\nIt was a natural step to AIDS activism where the well-organized ACT UP movement had so clearly and passionately connected the dots to access and drugs and information about medicine and healthcare. It was clear we had to fight back against any form of shame or stigma for needing lifesaving drugs and information. I knew this because of Abortion. I knew that our bodies were our own to love and save and protect and heal and those who knew more about them must help us – with no judgement about how we got here in the first place. We had to always separate our personal journey around “mistakes” and “risk” and “should have known better” from a medical professional’s ability to provide a fix.\n\nThen there was the Lesbian Feminist Cancer Movement. The women who had worked so hard protecting Abortion and then fighting for AIDS drugs were getting older and getting diagnosed with Cancer. Here they personally met up against the systems they knew all too well from fighting on behalf of everyone else. Doctors that judged them for being gay, or fat, or smoking, or all three at once. Cancers that should have been caught earlier with screenings or prevention. But we had just spent the previous 20 years witnessing medicine’s sexism and homophobia and cold and unjust attitude toward Abortion and HIV. You think I’m gonna voluntarily get a mammogram now?\n\nSo we didn’t. We couldn’t. We couldn’t trust any of them. And we started our own clinics and our support groups and our educational campaigns. We healed each other. We buried each other. And we looked around and said enough is enough. We joined with our brothers who started their own AIDS clinics and we became a larger movement that we now call LGBTQ Health. We knit it all together.\n\nThe healthcare system was sick – not us. The political system was broken – not us.\n\nWe built new worlds together. We played and imagined. We celebrated and partied. We raised our own money. We had our own bars. We kept articulating what it meant to open our body up to possibilities of health and life and demand a system that did, too. That understood us.\n\nIn the early 2000s, my then partner came out as transgender. My program director at the Lesbian Community Cancer Project came out as transgender. My queer community was once again changing and growing with the power and promise of personal liberation. Imagining their bodies into existence. New names, pronouns, hormones, surgeries. All another step in our goal of making medicine work FOR us and not AGAINST us. A movement of autonomy and joy and bodies of our choosing. Choice was always our mantra.\n\nEverything we knew from Abortion, HIV, and Cancer became our movement for Transgender Health. No longer would we have to suffer in bodies or lives prescribed by the world upon our birth.\n\nWe could live as we wanted. We could bring our inner most thoughts to the surface to be seen and appreciated by all. If we were to truly shed the dogma of heteronormativity – we must also shed gender, too.\n\nToday’s LGBTQ Health Movement is all of us. The fight for Abortion and HIV medicine. Cancer support. Hormones and surgery. It is our right to control our own bodies. It is our fight to make medicine work for us. It is our bond to work across and with our differences to usher in something better for all. We have built a new world and new conversations that I could have never imagined in the 80s, 90s, 2000s. We know more than ever.\n\nThe Abortion fight is our fight. Not because we are women or not; or have a uterus or not; or have sex that could lead to pregnancy or not. This is our fight because they are all our fights. We must bring everything we have learned from Transgender Health and HIV and Cancer and access and shame and stigma to benefit Abortion. Because there is no LGBTQ Health anywhere without Abortion Rights everywhere.\n\n###\n\nVaccine Hesitancy for LGBTQ+ People Affected by Previous Bad Experiences with Healthcare System\n\nTegan and Sara, award-winning musicians and founders of the Tegan and Sara Foundation, are sharing the results of their most recent healthcare survey to understand experiences with the COVID-19 vaccine within the LGBTQ+ community. The survey was developed by the Tegan and Sara Foundation in collaboration with health communications firm Entree Health and reviewed by researchers at SurveyMonkey, a leader in agile software solutions for customer experience, market research, and survey feedback, with contributions from physicians and healthcare experts specializing in LGBTQ+ healthcare.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nThe LGBTQ+ population in the US is highly accepting of the COVID-19 vaccine\n\nMore than 2 in 3 respondents are already vaccinated\n\n84% of the remainder want to get the COVID-19 vaccine “as soon as possible”\n\nGender minority people are more likely to want to get the vaccine as soon as possible, but are less likely to have already been vaccinated\n\nWanting to protect others is the most important reason LGBTQ+ people have gotten or will get vaccinated\n\nPrevious bad experiences with the healthcare system is an important driver for LGBTQ+ people who say they will wait to get vaccinated\n\nTegan and Sara, award-winning musicians and founders of TSF, said:\n\n“We’re passionate about healthcare access for LGBTQ+ people, and always have been. As advocates, we have focused on healthcare because we see how access to quality and affirming care affects our community. Most studies aren’t asking queer people the questions that we need to get better care.”\n\n“That’s why we launched the LGBTQ+ COVID-19 Vaccine Attitudes Study, to better understand the needs and concerns of our community on the pandemic and vaccine efforts. Without these perspectives, healthcare can’t truly be inclusive - which will have repercussions for a long time. We hope the readers of this study can use these results to make meaningful change in their own communities.”\n\nTegan and Sara and the Foundation encourage all members of the LGBTQ+ community and beyond to review the results of the survey, which can be accessed at the LINK.\n\nSurvey Background\n\nCOVID-19 has a unique impact on LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized communities (including people of color and rural communities). LGBTQ+ Americans are more likely to live in poverty and lack access to adequate medical care, paid medical leave, and basic necessities - all of these issues have been exacerbated by COVID-19.\n\nThe completely-confidential survey, developed with leading LGBTQ+ healthcare experts, was designed to be sensitive to the needs of the community. While current gender was asked in this survey, there was no question asking sex assigned at birth. These questions are often asked insensitively and create unnecessary barriers for gender nonconforming, nonbinary, and transgender people. The survey did include 17 gender and sexual orientation choices, including the option to write-in or choose not to disclose.\n\nTo obtain a holistic understanding of the queer community, TSF prioitized survey outreach and distribution to community-level organizations and underserved groups, to make sure that survey response included the diverse voices of the LGBTQ+ community. Key to this outreach was TSF’s Community Grants partners, which reach 39 grassroots organizations across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAbout Tegan and Sara Foundation\n\nTegan and Sara Foundation (TSF) was founded in 2016 by Tegan and Sara to address inequalities faced by LGBTQ+ women. TSF’s mission is improving the lives of LGBTQ+ women and girls. This mission is founded on a commitment to feminism and racial, social and gender justice. Learn more about TSF’s work and flagship programming at the OFFICIAL WEBSITE.\n\nAbout Tegan and Sara\n\nTegan and Sara have openly identified as queer since the beginning of their career in 1998, and have been outspoken feminist advocates for LGBTQ+ equality and gender justice. The essential message that underpins their worldview and identity is inclusion. The Tegan and Sara Foundation is an extension of their work, identity and longstanding commitment to supporting and building progressive social change.\n\nAs musicians, Tegan and Sara have sold more than one million albums, and have received seven Gold certifications, one Double Platinum certification, three Juno Awards, two Polaris Prize nominations, and a Grammy nomination. They have performed on some of the world’s biggest stages, from the 2015 Oscar Telecast to major festivals such as Coachella, Lollapalooza and Glastonbury.\n\nAbout Entrée Health\n\nEntrée Health is a communications and medical strategy agency serving the life sciences industry and focused on the belief that people deserve access to the healthcare they need.

More than 100 changemakers (two from each state, Washington D.C., and the U.S. Territories) have been named to the list.\n\nWith trans rights and safety under siege across the country, it’s imperative to amplify and elevate the breadth of LGBTQ+ identities. The Champions of Pride print and digital editions and virtual event is our way of honoring the diversity and dedication of so many in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nJessica Halem - Massachusetts\n\nWith a long history in working with LGBTQ+ folks, Jessica Halem, MBA, was the inaugural LGBTQ outreach and engagement director at Harvard Medical School. Previously, Halem ran the Lesbian Community Cancer Project in Chicago. There she implemented the nation’s first cultural competency trainings for the Centers for Disease Control and served on then-candidate Barack Obama’s first LGBT Advisory Committee. Halem, who identifies as a Jewish queer femme, also trained in improv at Chicago’s famed Second City. She utilizes the knowledge she gleaned there to “coach individuals and teams on dealing with difficult moments,” she says. “I like bringing my sense of humor, years of connections and experience, together with great ideas and teams,” she says. “I am passionate about helping LGBTQ people take up more space with more confidence and more joy while manifesting the world we all deserve.”\n\nCurrently, Halem, also serves on the board of the Tegan and Sara Foundation, which, “launched a microgrants program to get money quickly into the hands of LGBTQ creators, nonprofits, and activists.” she says. “I am so excited to see what these partners are doing on the front lines of issues like incarceration, trans youth, queer history, and housing.”\n\n\"Starting as a teenager, I came to think of queer health through of lens of social justice in many different ways. I started thinking about the world through a feminist lens in the 80s and I became involved in reproductive justice and abortion-rights. I grew up in a small town in Ohio where rich girls had birth control and poor girls had babies. No one wanted to have an abortion. I definitely was influenced from the very beginning by seeing issues of bodily autonomy, lack of access to healthcare information, and lack of access to something as simple as birth control and abortion rigged by class. All of this existed in a highly charged, political society with deep roots in sexism and race. And of course, we know now that sexuality and gender identity play large roles in that struggle. I understood the world of social justice and problems through the lens of how our physical bodies are impacted by the world’s conflicts.\n\nThen in the late 80s and early 90s I became involved in HIV and AIDS activism. I moved to New York City where I attended Sarah Lawrence College. I worked at abortion clinics in Westchester County that were sites of bombing. Again, this idea of healthcare being under siege was very real to me. There was actual violence that was attached to accessing healthcare. I was not an active member of ACT UP, but I was involved in The Women's Health Action Mobilization that grew out of the ACT UP movement. I think back on these experiences now and recognize how much of an influence these experiences had on my involvement in LGBTQ healthcare advocacy today.”\n\nRead the interview HERE.\n\nPanelists include:\n\nJaime Bellamy, DO; Adult Reconstruction Orthopaedic Surgeon; Fort Bragg, North Carolina\n\nLTC Jaime Bellamy received her Bachelor of Science in Chemistry (2001) and Masters of Science in Biology (2004) degrees from Missouri State University and her Doctorate of Osteopathy (2008) degree from Kansas City University of Medicine & Biosciences.
