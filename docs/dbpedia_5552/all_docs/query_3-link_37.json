        "text": "Looking for some catchy tunes that you can actually relate to? Us too babes! Throughout the 80s it was nearly impossible to find songs that were for queer women, understandably because it wasn’t the done thing to come out then, sadly. However fast forward to 2020 and seems there are lots of lesbian singers who are starting to write about other women, hooray. So, like the legends we are, we’ve curated a list of 25+ lesbian songs that are absolute bops, plus we’ll be adding to this article so make sure you pop back.\n\nFrom iconic anthems to hidden gems, these tracks are not only pure shoutouts to the lesbian community (thanks!) they also offer a diverse range of musical styles. Whether you’re looking to add some new faves to your playlist or simply need some WLW music in your life, this collection has got you covered. Our list has artists who fearlessly express their queer identities and create music that resonates with millions. So, turn up the volume and let these lesbian anthems fill your house and your neighbors too (sorry, Sue).\n\nThe Importance of Representation in Music\n\nBefore we give you the goods, it’s important to have a little chat about representation.\n\nMusic has always been a powerful tool for self-expression, and representation plays a crucial role in ensuring that everyone feels seen and heard. For the LGBTQ+ community, finding songs that reflect their experiences and emotions can be incredibly empowering. Lesbian songs, in particular, offer a glimpse into the lives of queer women, exploring themes of love, heartbreak, and identity. By featuring lesbian artists and their music, we not only celebrate their talent but also create a space where queer voices can be amplified. It’s through these songs that we can challenge societal norms, break down stereotypes, and foster a sense of belonging within the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nWhen lesbian songs are played on the radio, streamed online, or performed on stage, they send a powerful message to listeners. They validate feelings and experiences that may have been dismissed or ignored. They provide a soundtrack to love stories that have often been overlooked. In a world where representation matters, lesbian songs have the power to inspire, uplift, and unite individuals from all walks of life.\n\nAmen, sister! Cool so, let’s now get into the world of lesbian music and chat about the bops that are making waves.\n\nClassic Lesbian Anthems\n\nBefore we explore new lesbian artists, let’s take a trip down memory lane and revisit some classic lesbian anthems that have stood the test of time. These songs have become cultural touchstones, representing the struggles, triumphs, and joys of the lesbian community. Perhaps these were the limited glimpses of queer music in the 90s and 00s.\n\nLet’s start with the iconic “I Kissed a Girl” by Katy Perry. Katy Perry is not a lesbian of course, but she did give us this absolute banger in 2008. Apparently, the song was partially inspired by Perry’s friend with a girl as a teenager, commenting that “I did kiss her. I was totally obsessed with her. She was beautiful — porcelain skin, perfect lips.” Well, we love that Pezzah!\n\nCan we really have a lesbian songs article and not mention the legendary “All the Things She Said” by t.A.T.u? Lol, don’t pretend like you don’t like t.a.T.u. As teenagers (yes, Nonchalant writers were born in the 80s, don’t take the p*ss now), this was a music video that we all watched on repeat on MTV. Are we right or are we right?!\n\nContemporary Lesbian Artists\n\nAs time goes on, more and more lesbian artists are stepping into the spotlight and making their voices heard (*cough* via TikTok). These talented musicians are not only creating incredible music, but they are also using their platforms to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and visibility (legends!). From the raw and emotional storytelling of Hayley Kiyoko to the bold and unapologetic performances of Janelle Monáe, these artists are leaving a lasting impact on the music industry and the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nHayley Kiyoko, also known as “Lesbian Jesus,” has become a beacon of representation for queer women in the music industry. Her songs, such as “Girls Like Girls” and “Curious,” explore themes of love, identity, and self-acceptance. Kiyoko’s music videos often depict same-sex relationships, challenging heteronormative narratives and showcasing the beauty of queer love.\n\nSimilarly, Janelle Monáe has been unapologetically queer in her music, using her platform to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. Her album “Dirty Computer” is a celebration of sexuality, self-expression, and embracing one’s true identity.\n\nNext up, is super cute Arlo Parks.\n\nArlo Parks is a talented British singer, songwriter, and poet who gained widespread recognition for her introspective and emotionally resonant music. Born on August 9, 2000, in London, England, as Anaïs Oluwatoyin Estelle Marinho, she adopted the stage name Arlo Parks as a tribute to her first name and a park near her home. Parks has publicly identified as bisexual. In interviews and through her music, Parks has spoken openly about her sexuality and experiences as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. She has expressed a commitment to using her platform to bring visibility to queer experiences and to promote acceptance and understanding. Parks’ openness about her sexuality has resonated with many fans and has helped foster a sense of connection and representation within the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nWe recently saw Arlo Parks at the BBC6 Music Festival and found her captivating.\n\nThis next tune is one we had on repeat. Dove Cameron is an American actress and singer who rose to prominence for her roles in various Disney Channel productions. She was born on January 15, 1996, in Seattle, Washington, as Chloe Celeste Hosterman but is better known by her stage name, Dove Cameron. Cameron had an unexpected success with her song “Boyfriend” when it went viral on TikTok. Dove Cameron came out as bisexual in 2020.\n\nLesbian Love Songs\n\nHearing a woman sing about how they are in love with another woman is extremely important, love after all is a universal language. Lesbian love songs capture the unique experiences and emotions of queer women in love. These songs celebrate same-sex relationships, showcasing the beauty, passion, and intensity of lesbian love. From tender ballads to upbeat anthems, these tracks will make your heart flutter and your spirits soar.\n\nOne of the most beloved lesbian love songs is “Closer” by Tegan and Sara. This indie-pop duo has been creating music that resonates with the LGBTQ+ community for years, and “Closer” is a perfect example of their talent. With its infectious melody and heartfelt lyrics, this song captures the excitement and longing of a new love.\n\nAnother standout lesbian love song is “She Keeps Me Warm” by Mary Lambert. Featured in Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’s hit song “Same Love,” Lambert’s powerful vocals and poetic lyrics create an emotional and heartfelt tribute to same-sex love.\n\nIf you’re after more lesbian-long songs, then Kehlani is your girl. Kehlani, an American singer, songwriter, and dancer, has identified as bisexual. She has been open about her sexuality and has spoken publicly about her experiences and relationships with both men and women. Kehlani’s music often explores themes of love, relationships, and personal identity, and she has been praised for her authenticity and openness in discussing her sexuality.\n\nEmpowering Lesbian Songs\n\nIn addition to love songs, there are also empowering lesbian tracks that inspire confidence, self-acceptance, and resilience. These songs encourage listeners to embrace their true selves, defy societal expectations, and stand up for what they believe in. Whether you need a boost of self-confidence or a reminder of your inner strength, these tracks will empower you to be unapologetically yourself.\n\nIf we’re moving on to talking about empowering lesbian songs, and powerful lesbians then we have to discuss our girl Fletcher.

These hidden gems may not have received as much mainstream attention, but they are definitely worth a listen.
