        "text": "By Adrian Hayes\n\nIn 2013, Irish singer Andrew Hozier Byrne, better known as Hozier, released his first EP, titled ​“Take Me to Church” and everything changed.\n\nOkay, maybe that’s a little over-dramatic. What really happened was that Hozier released another EP, followed it up with his self-titled album, got nominated for several awards, performed a lot, and then faded from the limelight, splitting his time between political activism and acts of civil disobedience (yes, really), and cheerfully generating cryptic tweets about oatmeal, hotel room notepads, and the time a man publicly took off his trousers and offered them to him as a gift (​yes, really). New music became scarce, his latest song was released in 2016, and Hozier could have faded into obscurity in the frantic culture of the internet. But then something wonderful happened – Lesbians.\n\nIt turns out that a lot of lesbians really like Hozier. There is a social media niche, largely on Tumblr, but reaching onto platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, that has adopted Hozier as a lesbian icon. People pitch his songs up to give them a more feminine tone, put his songs on sapphic playlists, and some have even dubbed him an “honorary lesbian.”\n\nThis is of course, in no small part, thanks to “Take Me to Church,” a song which tackles the intersection between sex and religion. Lyrics such as “We were born sick,” and “there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sins,” resonate with minorities condemned by the church, and the music video shows two men being persecuted for loving each other. Hozier is an activist as well as a musician, and his allyship is more than just performative (pun very much intended), but of course, writing your activism into an immensely popular song isn’t a bad look, and the community is good at throwing its support behind artists and brands that show us any support in return. But the questions remain: what makes Hozier so appealing to lesbians? And is that an oxymoron.\n\nForbidden love, and the theme of love turning something that would normally be considered profane into something sacred permeates much of Hozier’s work, not just “Take Me to Church.” Another theme is love that conquers every outside force, including death. These themes are often prominent in queer stories. Lyrics such as “Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips, we could just kiss like real people do,” sum up these ideas neatly.\n\nHozier also just really loves to sing about loving women. Of course, he’s not the only male artist who does that, but his passionate ballads about how amazing women are and how lucky he is to love them definitely seem to strike chords (pun, once again, very intended) with lesbians. It’s not that other male artists don’t write songs about loving women. It’s just that not all of them resonate as much as “no grave can hold my body down, I’ll crawl home to her.”\n\nI relate to the way Hozier sings about women in a way that is as innate as it is intangible. For me, it’s the musical equivalent to the emotion I feel when looking at a picture of Gillian Anderson.\n\nAlthough I suspect that may be a particularly personal metaphor.\n\nPersonally, I love the idea of Hozier as a lesbian icon. We are so often criticized for how we view men. Showing even the slightest appreciation for men, be it actors, singers, even fictional characters, often leads immediately to speculation on whether or not we are “real” lesbians. But gay men are allowed to love female artists whose music they find relatable.\n\nShouldn’t we be allowed to do the same without having our love for women questioned? I wrote a poem once, with the line “it took me too long to realize that I did not want to be the girl in the song, I wanted to be the person singing to her.” After years of struggling with compulsory heterosexuality before I was able to accept myself as a lesbian, this realization felt particularly profound. And ultimately, ​that is why I think of Hozier’s music as “lesbian music.” Because when I listen to it, I finally feel like the person singing."
