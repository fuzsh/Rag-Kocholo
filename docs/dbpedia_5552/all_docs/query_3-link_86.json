        "text": "Lenia (she/her) is a Ph.D. candidate in Counseling Psychology at Fordham University and earned her M.A. in Counseling Education and M.Ed. in Mental Health Counseling from Columbia University in New York.\n\nLenia’s clinical style is rooted in relational-psychodynamic, mindfulness-based, and person-centered therapies. While working from these approaches, Lenia seeks to embed her work with clients in a multicultural framework, exploring the ways social context, personal history, and intersecting identities impact clients’ experiences in the world. As a counselor, Lenia aspires to co-create a safe, empathetic, and non-judgmental space with clients to explore various mental health challenges/concerns and develop helpful ways of coping and new ways of relating with self and others. Incorporating a holistic and collaborative approach, Lenia also strives to help individuals take control of their narrative and cultivate a greater sense of self-awareness, self-compassion, and self-acceptance.\n\nOutside of work, Lenia enjoys spending time connecting with her mind, body, and soul, which includes having quality friends and family time, traveling for food, watching an entire series over the span of a weekend, doing yoga or Pilates, or enjoying beach time!\n\nClinical Interests: identity development, trauma, family/romantic relationship issues, interpersonal concerns, academic stress, cross-cultural adjustment, loss and grief, mood and anxiety, international students, Third Culture Kids, concealable chronic conditions\n\nAdditional Languages: Korean\n\nNguyen Nguyen (He/Him) is completing his Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology at Texas Tech University. He earned his M.A. in Counseling Psychology in 2020 and successfully defended his dissertation in 2022. Nguyen's research primarily centers on promoting the health and well-being of BIPOC and linguistic minority communities, with a specific focus on identifying factors that foster resilience among individuals within these communities, particularly in the face of systemic and day-to-day discrimination.\n\nIn his clinical practice, Nguyen has a strong emphasis on serving college students and underserved communities, utilizing a psychodynamic orientation. Prior to joining Cal, Nguyen spent 2 years as a clinician at the Student Counseling Center at Texas Tech University. He also worked in public hospitals and community mental health centers, where he provided comprehensive care and assessments for individuals dealing with chronic health conditions and developmental disabilities.\n\nNguyen's therapeutic approach combines warmth, empowerment, humor, and directiveness. He believes that the therapy room should be a safe and brave space for students to address their challenges with compassion, curiosity, and courage. Moreover, it's a place for students to explore their strengths and discover how to leverage those strengths for personal and professional growth, as well as nurture a deeper sense of meaning in life.\n\nWhen it comes to self-care, Nguyen finds enjoyment in listening to classical music, with Rachmaninoff as his all-time favorite composer. He has a passion for cooking Vietnamese cuisine and watching horror movies. Additionally, he loves hiking, reading, and practicing Buddhist meditation.\n\nNguyen's clinical interests include brief psychodynamic therapy, existential therapy, self-compassion, relationship/intimacy issues, family dynamics, adjustments and transitions, transgenerational trauma, identity exploration, vocational concerns, the well-being of BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals, spirituality, graduate student life, coping with chronic health conditions, and grief/loss.\n\nAdditional Languages: Vietnamese\n\nHimadhari Sharma (she/they) is completing her Ph.D. in Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology with an emphasis in Counseling Psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She also received her M.A. from NYU in Psychology with an emphasis in Clinical Psychology. She has a variety of experiences working in university counseling centers, community mental health centers, an eating disorder day program, an autism community clinic, a faculty and staff psychological support program as well as internationally (NIMHANS, India). Her current research work focuses on increasing accessibility to mental health support among minoritized groups as well as culturally rooted psychological services. Himadhari approaches mental health and healing through a relational cultural orientation centered in social justice and decolonization. She also uses aspects of goal-focused positive psychotherapy (GFPP), liberation psychotherapy, CBT, DBT, mindfulness, and attachment theory as well as indigenous and eastern healing interventions.
