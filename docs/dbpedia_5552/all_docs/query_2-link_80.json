Currently, only 5 states in the country are required by law to include LGBTQ+ content in the curriculum of its public schools. The Tegan and Sara Foundation is working to change this by partnering with DonorsChoose to fund programs that bring LGBTQ-inclusive books to classrooms across the U.S. The Tegan and Sara Foundation fights for economic justice, health and representation for LGBTQ+ girls and women. Join the Tegan and Sara Foundation in supporting LGBTQ+ youth through projects on DonorsChoose.org, and visit teganandsarafoundation.org to learn more about more programming that supports LGBTQ+ women and girls.",
