        "text": "Canadian indie rock/indie pop duoTemplate:SHORTDESC:Canadian indie rock/indie pop duo\n\nTegan and Sara Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:IPAc-en/data' not found. are a Canadian indie pop duo formed in 1998[2] in Calgary, Alberta, composed of identical twin sisters Tegan Rain Quin and Sara Keirsten Quin (born September 19, 1980).[3] Both musicians are songwriters and multi-instrumentalists.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\nThe pair have released nine studio albums and numerous EPs. The duo earned a Grammy nomination in 2012 for their DVD/live album Get Along.[9] Their ninth album, Hey, I'm Just Like You, was released on September 27, 2019.[10] Their memoir, High School, was released on September 24, 2019.\n\nHistory[]\n\n1995–2005: Background and early work[]\n\nTegan and Sara began playing guitar and writing songs at age 15[6] with the use of an old guitar they found in their basement owned by their stepdad (at that time), Bruce. One of the very first songs they wrote was Tegan Didn't Go To School Today, originally written by Sara and they later on sang and recorded together on a tape. They first called their band Plunk, defined as 'light punk' as they didn't have a drummer nor a bass player that time. In 1997, they used their school's recording studio to record two demo albums: Who's in Your Band? and Play Day. In 1998, they won Calgary's \"Garage Warz\" competition, using the studio time they won to record their first professional demo under the name \"Sara and Tegan\",[11][12] Yellow tape, which was followed by Orange tape and Red tape. Their first \"big-time show\" was in May 1998 in Calgary, opening for Hayden.[13]\n\nIn 1999, they released their debut album Under Feet Like Ours independently under the \"Sara and Tegan\" name with producer Jared Kuemper.[14] Two songs from Red tape appeared on the album, and two from Orange tape. They later changed their name to \"Tegan and Sara\" because people thought they were a solo act named \"Sara Antegan\". The new name was more memorable and their first album was later reprinted under the name Tegan and Sara. The same year, they signed with Neil Young's Vapor Records and released This Business of Art through the label in 2000. They have toured extensively since then. In 2002, the band released their third album, If It Was You. Their fourth album, So Jealous, was released in 2004 and led to wider success and attention, both locally and internationally. This album was released through both Vapor and Sanctuary. One track of the album, \"Walking with a Ghost\",[15] was covered by the White Stripes, who released it on their Walking with a Ghost EP.[16]\n\n2007–2011: Mainstream success[]\n\nTegan and Sara's 2007 album, The Con, was released by Vapor and Sire because Sanctuary chose to no longer release new music in the United States. The album was co-produced by Chris Walla. Jason McGerr of Death Cab for Cutie, Matt Sharp of the Rentals (and previously Weezer), Hunter Burgan of AFI, and Kaki King all appeared and collaborated on the album.[17]\n\nOn October 26, 2009, Tegan and Sara released their sixth album, Sainthood, produced by Chris Walla and Howard Redekopp. The duo also put out a three-volume book set titled ON, IN, AT, which is a collection of stories, essays, journals, and photos of the band on tour in America in late 2008, writing together in New Orleans, and touring Australia. The photographs in the book are taken by Lindsey Byrnes and Ryan Russell. The album Sainthood debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number 21 selling 24,000 copies in its first week.[18] While recording Sainthood, Tegan and Sara spent a week writing songs together in New Orleans. The song \"Paperback Head\" was the only song written by the pair to appear on the album, making it the first song on any Tegan and Sara album that they wrote together.[19] Spin magazine gave Sainthood four out of five stars and wrote, \"Tegan and Sara's music may no longer be the stuff of teens, but its strength remains in how much it feels like two people talking.\"[20]\n\nIn 2011, they launched \"2011: A Merch Odyssey\", which saw at least one new item in the official online stores every month, all year long. A live CD/DVD combination package titled Get Along was released on November 15 and contains three films titled \"States\", \"India\", and \"For the Most Part\". Get Along was nominated in the 2013 Grammy Awards for Best Long Form Music Video.[21]\n\n2012–2018: Heartthrob, Love You to Death, and The Con X: Covers[]\n\nTegan and Sara started recording their seventh studio album, Heartthrob, on February 20, 2012. Eight songs were produced by Greg Kurstin. Joey Waronker contributed drums to these songs. Two songs were produced by Mike Elizondo, with Victor Indrizzo contributing drums, Josh Lopez contributing guitar, and Dave Palmer contributing piano. The last two songs were produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen. The first single, \"Closer\", was released on September 25, 2012. The album was released on January 29, 2013 and debuted on the Billboard top 200 at number 3, the band's highest charting record to date, selling 49,000 copies in its first week.[22] Heartthrob debuted at number 2 on the Canadian chart, digital downloads chart and hit number 1 on the rock and alternative album charts.[23] In July 2013, the album was shortlisted for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize.[24] In March 2014, Tegan and Sara won three Juno Awards for Single of the Year, Pop Album of the Year, and Group of the Year.\n\nTegan and Sara finished their eighth studio album on November 30, 2015. On March 10, 2016, the band announced via their Facebook account that the album's title would be Love You to Death, with the release date set for June 3. They released the lead single from the album, \"Boyfriend\", on April 8. On April 25, tour dates were announced for their 2016 worldwide tour for the Love You to Death album. The duo released a music video for each track on the album. For the tenth anniversary of the release of their album The Con, Tegan and Sara collaborated with 17 artists including Cyndi Lauper to create The Con X: Covers in 2017. The participating artists created covers of The Con's original songs which created a cohesive album sold to benefit the Tegan and Sara Foundation. Tegan and Sara also toured an acoustic version of The Con in 2017 with a portion of the proceeds supporting the Tegan and Sara Foundation.[25]\n\nOn December 11, 2018, Tegan and Sara announced a memoir entitled High School, sharing the story of their youth, to be released fall 2019, along with new music.[26][27]\n\n2019–present: Hey, I'm Just Like You, memoir, and new album[]\n\nIn May 2018 at Out Web Fest, Tegan stated they were working on a book, podcast, and new record.[28] Their memoir, High School, was published on September 24, 2019 by MCD Books, a division of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, alongside Simon & Schuster Canada and Virago Press in the United Kingdom.[29][30]\n\nIn early 2019, Tegan and Sara announced they were working on their next record for release later that year.[31] On July 9, 2019, they announced via Instagram that their ninth album would be called Hey, I'm Just Like You, and would consist of twelve rerecorded songs they initially wrote as teenagers. It was released on September 27, 2019,[32] three days after the release of their memoir.\n\nIn April 2020, the duo created a live \"show\" that they named Where Does the Good Grow, to entertain their fans during the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 12, 2020, they announced that they were releasing merchandise designed by EE Storey for Where Does the Good Grow. The show was held every Thursday at 3PM PST on their Instagram account, until the series finale on July 23, 2020.[33]\n\nIn July 2021, Tegan and Sara announced on their social media a return to the studio to work on their tenth studio album.[34]\n\nInfluences[]\n\nTegan and Sara have credited Green Day, Nirvana, and Hole for \"truly start[ing] to cement our desire to write and make our own music\".[35] During their teenage years, the duo were influenced by Hayden,[13] the Smashing Pumpkins, Violent Femmes, Dinosaur Jr., and Teenage Fanclub.[36] Other artists who have influenced Tegan and Sara include Depeche Mode,[37][38] Rihanna,[39][40] Taylor Swift,[41] Madonna, Kate Bush, David Bowie, Mike Elizondo,[42] Pink, Lily Allen,[43] Erasure, Ace of Base,[44] Tom Petty, Britney Spears, Katy Perry,[45] Ani DiFranco, the New Pornographers, Cyndi Lauper, Sinéad O'Connor, Against Me!, and Bruce Springsteen.[35]\n\nPersonal lives[]\n\nTegan and Sara are identical twins born September 19, 1980, in Calgary.

They are both advocates for LGBTQ equality as well as music education, literacy, and cancer research.[49]\n\nActivism and involvement in the LGBT community[]\n\nIn December 2016, and in the wake of the United States' presidential election, the sisters founded the Tegan and Sara Foundation, to fight for \"economic justice, health and representation for LGBTQ girls and women\".[2] They have since partnered with Kiehl's cosmetics to release Ultra Facial cleansers with limited edition packaging in order to raise funds for the foundation.[50] Profits from The Con X: Covers and a portion of ticket prices from The Con's tenth anniversary tour went to the Tegan and Sara Foundation. At the end of The Con 10th anniversary tour in 2017, they stated they plan to take two years off from touring to focus on the Tegan and Sara Foundation and to make a new record.[51]\n\nIn 2013, the band partnered with Coolhaus, their \"favourite ice cream sandwich truck\",[52] to create an ice cream sandwich in favour of same-sex marriage. The sandwich featured Double Chocolate cookies and Salted Caramel ice cream, and was named \"Til Death Do Us Part\".[52][53]\n\nIn 2012, they appeared on the cover of Under the Radar magazine's \"Protest\" issue. Both were photographed holding a sign that read \"The rights of the minority should never be subject to the whim of the majority.\"[54] Also in Canada, they were actively supporting Quebec students in their protest against that provincial government. In the U.S., both were vocal during California's Prop 8 debates.[55] On November 10, 2016, rather than boycotting North Carolina for HB2, Tegan and Sara performed at The Orange Peel and donated their proceeds to Equality North Carolina in order to fight the legislation.[56] This inspired the band Matt and Kim to match their donation in the form of merchandise proceeds.[57]\n\nDue to the expansion of their audience they have gained a higher profile in the LGBTQ community. They were awarded Outstanding Music Artist at the GLAAD Media Awards, beating out high-profile musicians including Lady Gaga and Elton John.[58] In June 2014, Tegan and Sara joined WorldPride to perform in the closing ceremonies at Yonge–Dundas Square in downtown Toronto.[59]\n\nThe duo partnered with Revel & Riot to create a T-shirt that would fund Revel & Riot's mission for LGBTQ rights. The \"Animals\" T-shirt features Tegan and Sara, a turtle, fox, koala, penguin, and a dragonfly all labeled with their Latin names. The text at the bottom reads \"Gay behaviour is found in over 1500 species.
