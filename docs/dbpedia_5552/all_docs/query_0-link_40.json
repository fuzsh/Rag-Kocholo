        "text": "\"In general terms, heterosexuality is mainstream; queer sexualities, on the other hand, are not. The anecdotal evidence is unequivocal: whether tuning your radio to the weekly Top 40 countdown, watching the chart-toppers on MTV, or browsing the ‘most downloaded’ listings on iTunes, images and narratives of heterosexual love and desire dominate mainstream popular music. With few exceptions, the repetitive performances of hetero-norms manifest as qualities that contribute to the potential mainstream appeal of popular music artists. Following this, the natural province of queer music and those who make it is the cultural fringe. Given the marginalisation of queers within the mainstream, a phrase like ‘mainstream lesbian music’ is likely to be read as a contradiction in terms—dubious at the very least. Yet, a quick scan of the music forum pages on the lesbian pop culture website AfterEllen (afterellen.com) reveals that ‘mainstream lesbian music’ is clearly a ‘thing’; to what, or to whom the phrase refers, is less clear. On many of the publically accessible music forum pages I looked at, members would frequently refer to loving or hating various kinds of ‘lesbian music’, insisting that some lesbian music was more mainstream than others. For example, in a specific thread dedicated to the topic, one member commented: “… I’m not a fan of mainstream, stereotypical lesbian music … there is a thriving, underground music scene of queer musicians that get overlooked … because they aren't being [sic] in the mainstream spotlight” (posted February 11, 2011). Such a comment begs numerous questions, not least, what is lesbian music and how it is positioned in relation to categories such as the mainstream and, what this forum post terms, the ‘queer underground’? However, answering these questions is not a straightforward matter because the parameters of ‘the mainstream’ itself is all too commonly ill defined. Music simply described as ‘mainstream’ (not unlike describing music as ‘lesbian’) eludes identification of explicit musical characteristics, a discrete style or genre of expression. Rather, the mainstream is a value-laden category that frequently—and problematically—derives its meaning in association with its multiple corollaries such as counterculture, subculture, underground, indie, folk, alternative, experimental and avant-garde. When situated in binary opposition to the politically resistant stylised rituals of a potent subculture (e.g. Hebdige 1979), the mainstream garners negative connotations, unhelpfully implying a lax association with an inauthentic, commercialised, normative and depoliticised form of cultural hegemony (Huber 2007). What’s more, incorporating this figuration of the mainstream into lesbian music, which I do in the last section of this chapter, takes us quite some distance from the notion of mainstream lesbian music referred to in the above forum post. As Alison Huber argues in this volume, for a nebulous term like mainstream to function critically in studies of popular music we must first acknowledge that the, or rather, a mainstream is always an historically situated, contingent and contested term. In this chapter, through the lens of lesbian and queer feminist musicalities, I draw further attention to the limitations of the binary structuration of the mainstream vis-à-vis its subcultural Other. I argue that lesbian identity is (re)produced across multiple sites of popular music, concomitantly revealing the multiple strategies, politics, communions and contentions that figure in the musicalised representations of queer female intimacies. Furthermore, I consider the various ways that these representations are positioned in relation to notions of the mainstream, thus revealing the multiple discourses and connotations of the mainstream within lesbian and queer female music cultures, as well as particular abstractions of lesbianism with mainstream pop music. Progressing chronologically, I begin this chapter by outlining the emergence of womyn’s music in the 1970s. I then consider how select lesbian artists situated themselves within the mainstream during the late 1980s and early 1990s, enshrining their status as mainstream lesbian musical icons. To follow, I discuss the riot dyke critique first propelled by post-punk feminist musicians in the mid-1990s and ornament this discussion with localised ethnographic data, which illustrates the contemporary polychromatics of lesbian and queer musicalities. Finally, I will point to what some have termed ‘celesbianism’ or ‘fauxmosexuality’ in the mainstream pop arena of the 21st century. \""
