(this is unfortunately a very lacking category)\n* Yay it's gay! - the show offers up some great quality queer representation,it's not a queer show per se but it brings us some awesome lesbian storylines!\n* Gay! - shows with queer main characters, but their stories share the screen with others, not being the main focus of the show itself. Also includes shows like skam that have a specific queer season.\n* I guess... gay? - shows with some queer characters that don't get as much screentime as we'd like, but that are still worth the watch.\n* Do it for the couple - shows you only watch for that specific lesbian couple that showed up a few seasons to late, or just don't get a lot of screentime. You probably rather watch their scenes on youtube than endure the whole show as you try to enjoy every gay breadcrumb you get.\n* Queer-friendly - I decided to add this rating for shows where relationships (straight or gay) aren't really part of the main plot, the adventure itself, or whatever is going on, is. But in the background, we see plenty of queer people. I feel like TV shows like this are a breath of fresh air, especially in adventure/sci-fi shows.\nThe shows are not listed in any specific order.\n\nRead the descriptions and see what's your jam, hope you like it! Enjoy!",
