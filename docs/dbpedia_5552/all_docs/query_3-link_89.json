        "text": "Speaker Biography\n\n“Bold, cultural insight” – On Vivek Shraya’s work by Booklist\n\nVivek Shraya is a multidisciplinary artist who tackles topics such as community, diversity, identity, leadership, failure, and pop culture in her talks, her artwork and her music. Her work How to Fail as a PopStar, has become a book, a play, and released in 2023 as a tv series on CBC Gem. Her best-selling book, I’m Afraid of Men, was her­ald­ed by Vanity Fair as “cultural rocket fuel, ” and Elliott Page praised it as “A deeply generous and honest gift to the world.” In 2023, she also released her visual album – “Baby, You’re Projecting” with Mint Records.\n\nIn 2021, she was invited to give the Kreisel Lecture where she addressed themes including the importance of showing up, the value of reflection, of communicating with intention and care, the vast extent of wellness, and more. She was also selected as a representative with Pantene for their campaigns on the power of self expression.\n\nHer work, The Subtweet, explores online living, and the promise & peril of being seen, described by Lambda Literary as “riveting…vividly centered in the here and now.”\n\nVivek was featured on The Globe and Mail’s Best Dressed list, was a Pride Toronto Grand Marshal, and chosen by M.A.C Cosmetics to represent their Originals campaign, celebrating nine Canadians who embrace their values of inclusivity, artistry and a love of high-performing makeup.\n\nHer South-Asian heritage and her ‘aims to educate and inspire audiences about topics including mental health, queerness, and inclusion,’ was featured by Vogue India, as one of five fearless Indian LGBTQI+ personalities to follow on Instagram.\n\nA Polaris Music Prize nominee, she is one half of the music duo Too Attached and her album with Queer Songbook Orchestra, Part‑Time Woman, was included in CBC ’s list of Best Canadian Albums of 2017. She’s also currently a director on the board of the Tegan and Sara Foundation.\n\nShe is an Assistant Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Calgary. She’s the author of more than 10 books and is a seven-time Lambda Literary Award finalist, who’s also earned honours from The Writers’ Trust of Canada and The Publishing Triangle. She’s founded VS books, and in 2021, is offering a mentorship and publishing opportunity for an Indigenous or Black writer, or a writer of colour, over the age of 50 living in Canada.\n\nHer body of work crosses the boundaries of music, literature, visual art, theatre, spoken word, and film. Vivek’s talks are candid, thoughtful and artistic on creating change, learning from ‘failure’, managing your wellbeing, encouraging psychological safety, and supporting community."
