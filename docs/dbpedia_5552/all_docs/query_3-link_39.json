        "text": "1. Teaching 2SLGBTQ+ content in context. Engage teacher candidates in developing a lesson plan about a work by a 2SLGBTQ+ artist that directly or indirectly addresses 2SLGBTQ+ themes. Possible topics:\n\nFor visual artists, the work of painter Kent Monkman is a contemporary possibility; historically, students could study the life and work of Da Vinci or Michelangelo—both of whom had their homosexuality concealed long after their deaths, although it was probably not a secret while they were alive.\n\nIn popular music, students could study the life and work of artists such as Freddy Mercury, Janis Joplin, Boy George, George Michael, or Lil Nas X (among many others); this could introduce students to queer artists and enable discussions about how, even in recent years, some artists’ kept their sexuality secret for most (or all) of their careers. There are opportunities as well to discuss what happened when their sexuality was disclosed or discovered, or to have conversations about those who have been open about their sexuality.\n\nA unit on Lilies (Les Feluettes) by Quebec playwright Michel Marc Bouchard, would be a good candidate for this activity in theatre classes. The play, a layered drama about a love triangle among about Catholic schoolboys in turn-of-the-century Quebec, was adapted into a feature film and most recently into an opera staged in Montreal, Edmonton, and Victoria.\n\n2. A critical analysis of typical Arts-course content. Teacher candidates examine content from Arts education textbooks and consider the representation and erasure of 2SLGBTQ+ artists (their work and their personal lives). By becoming aware of what is missing, and critically analysing what 2SLGBTQ+ representation exists, students will be able to carry this awareness with them when choosing texts/works and designing assignments for their own classes."
