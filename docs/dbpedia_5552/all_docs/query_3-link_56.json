        "text": "Communities across the country celebrate Pride Month, and one such way is through artistic expression. Whether it be visual art, film, television, or any other medium, art has been utilized to express LGBTQ+ themes to a significant degree. Out of all the artists, musicians could make the argument that their medium is the most digestible for this type of expression.\n\nFor decades, musical artists have released albums with both LGBTQ+ undertones and overtones. Members of gay communities have cherished these albums, the artists becoming idols and their songs becoming unofficial anthems. For those reasons, mainstream music releases from LGBTQ+ musicians have been considered to be important and powerful forms of representation.\n\nTo observe Pride Month, and to point members of these communities to albums they may have missed, Stacker has compiled a list of 50 albums from LGBTQ+ artists across various time periods and musical genres. These albums are a mix of commercially- and critically-acclaimed records, some being historically significant in some manner, or just generally interesting for the public.\n\nThis list will describe each album and point out what stood out to both critics and fans, particularly which hit songs spawned from them. Some of these musicians are well-known, others not as much. Whatever the case, all represent different parts of the spectrum of identity. As the attitudes toward the LGBTQ+ community changed, so did the music that came from it. As these list items are arranged in chronological order, this list is somewhat of a musical timeline.\n\nWhich of these albums have you listened to, which albums are your favorites, and which ones do you need to catch up on? And in case you're craving some tunes afterward, check out Stacker's Pride Playlist on Spotify, full of the albums celebrated in this story."
