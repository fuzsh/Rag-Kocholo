I am about to blow your mind with such an amazing band. Tegan and Sara are lesbian sisters who hail from Calgary, Canada. They are an indie rock/indie pop duo that have such a different sound, at least to me. They both started at age 15 in a band called Plunk. Tegan and Sara made 2 demo albums under that name, (Who is in your band? and Play day). Eventually, in 1999 they released a demo called Under feet Like Ours under Sara and Tegan. Eventually, to sound different from other bands, and because it just sounded better, they change their name to Tegan and Sara.

Tegan and Sara, after years, have made it onto a more mainstream line, with albums such as The Con in 2007, Sainthood in 2009 and Hearthrob in 2012. Tegan and Sara both sing together, and have sort of a nasally, whining sound to them. It mixes in perfectly with the distinct sounds of bass guitar. They have continued to push the boundaries with vulnerable lyrics. The sisters each write their own songs and sing them together, dealing with a lot of deep, dark issues. In the song Nineteen, the lyrics are played so well that they can be interpreted to be a lot of things, whether it was about a child or a one night stand.

I felt you in my legs

Before I even met you

And when I laid beside you

For the first time

I told you

I feel you in my heart,

And I don’t even know you

Now we’re saying

Bye, bye, bye

Now we’re saying

Bye, bye, bye

I was nineteen

(Call me)

If you go through all of their songs, you get a sense of pain, guilt, love, romance, sex and a lot of themes that are looked over. The way their voices play together with the instruments, is just amazing. Definitely one of my favorite bands. Check them out!!!
