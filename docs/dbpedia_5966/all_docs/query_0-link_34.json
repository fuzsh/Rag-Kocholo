The Diamond Arm has become a Russian cult film and is considered by many Russian contemporaries to be one of the finest comedies of its time. The plot of the film was based on a real-life news item about Swiss smugglers who tried to transport jewels in an orthopedic cast.\n\nSemyon Gorbunkov goes on a cruise. In Istanbul, he slips and breaks his arm. What he didn’t know is that this was a signal for a gang of smugglers. So his arm gets bandaged with gold and diamonds. After he returns home, the gangsters are trying to get their stuff back, while the police try to catch them using Gorbunkov and his arm."
