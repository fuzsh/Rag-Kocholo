        "text": "What does the list of the thousand most popular Soviet films look like? Why did these Soviet films become box office leaders? Which Soviet directors can be considered the most box office hits, and why? How did the press and the audience evaluate the highest-grossing Soviet films? Professor Alexander Fedorov's monograph One thousand and one highest-grossing Soviet film: opinions of film critics and viewers, now in its third revised edition, offers a broad panorama of a thousand of the most popular Soviet films, viewed through the eyes of film critics and audiences. The material of this book might be of interest for higher-school teachers, students, graduate students, researchers, film critics, cinema scholars, journalists, as well as for the wide range of readers who are interested in the history of cinema art, problems of cinema, film criticism and film sociology. In connection with the publication of the monograph A. Fedorov gave an interview to Professor Marina Tselykh.\n\nWhat foreign films were popular in the Soviet film distribution? How did the film press and the audience evaluate and evaluate these movies? In this monograph, for the first time, an attempt is made to give a panorama of two hundred foreign films popular in the USSR in the mirror of the opinions of film critics and viewers. The monograph is intended for higher education teachers, students, graduate students, researchers, film critics and historians, journalists, as well as for a circle of readers who are interested in the problems of cinema, film criticism and film sociology.\n\nThe subject of Western cinematography was presented in a rather limited volume on the pages of the Soviet Screen magazine in 1957–1960. However, with the appointment of film critic Dmitry Pisarevsky (1912–1990) to the post of editor-in-chief the \"thaw\" tendencies in the Soviet screen led to a gradual increase in the number of materials about foreign cinema on the pages of the magazine (sometimes they took up to a third of the total volume of the issue). Increasingly, photographs of Western movie stars were published (in rare cases, even on color covers), neutrally or positively presented biographies of Hollywood and European actors and directors, articles about Western film weeks and international film festivals, reviews of Western films, etc. Although, no doubt, there were also ideologically biased materials in this magazine. Based on the content analysis (in the context of the historical, socio-cultural and political situation, etc.) of the texts published during the \"thaw\" period of the magazine Soviet Screen (1957–1968), the authors came to the conclusion that materials on the subject of Western cinema on this stage can be divided into the following genres: - ideologized articles emphasizing criticism of bourgeois cinema and its harmful influence on the audience; - articles on the history of Western cinema (as a rule, about the period of the Great Silent, with a minimum degree of ideologization); - biographies and creative portraits of Western actors and directors (often neutrally or positively evaluating these filmmakers); - interviews with Western filmmakers (here, as a rule, interlocutors were selected from among \"progressive artists\"); - reviews of Western films (positive in relation to most of the Soviet film distribution repertoire and often negative in relation to those movies that were considered ideologically harmful); - articles about international film festivals and weeks of foreign cinema in the USSR (with a clear division into \"progressive\" and \"bourgeois\" cinematography); - reviews of the current repertoire of Western national cinematographies (here, as a rule, criticism of bourgeois cinematography was also combined with a positive assessment of works and trends ideologically acceptable to the USSR); - short informational materials about events in Western cinema (from neutral reports to caustic feuilletons and \"yellow\" gossip).\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the content of Cinema Art depended quite substantially on political and economic developments in the world and in Russia; theoretical articles about cinematography very often occupied a very modest place on the pages of the journal. The frequency of theoretical articles in the journal Cinema Art in the post-Soviet 1990s ranged from six to thirty-five per year. At the same time, due to the sharp politicization and focus on non-film texts, the minimum of film theory in the journal's texts occurred in the first three post-Soviet years. Our analysis of film theory concepts (in the context of the sociocultural and political situation, etc.) of the existence of the journal Cinema Art in the first post-Soviet decade (1992−2000) showed that theoretical works on cinematic subjects during this period can be divided into the following types:-articles, discussions devoted mainly to theoretical analysis of the heritage of the classics of Soviet cinema, directing, the problemы of Cinema and the Spectator, film criticism and film studies, etc.\n\nBased on the content analysis (in the context of the historical, socio-cultural and political situation, etc.) of the texts published during the \"perestroika\" period of the Soviet Screen magazine (1986-1991), the authors came to the conclusion that materials on the subject of Western cinema on this stage can be divided into the following genres:-ideologized articles emphasizing criticism of bourgeois cinema and its harmful influence on the audience (1986-1987);-articles on the history of Western cinema;-biographies and creative portraits of Western actors and directors (as a rule, with positive ratings);-interviews with Western filmmakers (as a rule, with those who came to Moscow film festivals);-reviews of Western films (here we can note a violation of the old tradition: if in 1986-1987 the magazine still often negatively evaluated some \"politically harmful bourgeois\" films, then later Western film production was evaluated without regard to ideological stereotypes, moreover, even received a positive interpretation films that were previously rejected for ideological reasons);-articles about international film festivals and weeks of foreign cinema in the USSR, reviews of the current repertoire of Western national cinematographies (no longer divided into \"progressive\" and \"bourgeois\" cinematography);-short informational materials about events in Western cinema (from neutral reports to \"yellow\" gossip)."
