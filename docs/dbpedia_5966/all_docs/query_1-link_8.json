        "text": "Donald Sutherland (born July 17, 1935, Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada—died June 20, 2024, Miami, Florida, U.S.) was a Canadian character actor who was equally adept at portraying heinous villains and benevolent family patriarchs. His notable films included M*A*S*H (1970), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), Ordinary People (1980), and the Hunger Games series.\n\nAfter graduating with dual degrees in engineering and drama from the University of Toronto, Sutherland embarked on a career on the London stage. He later appeared on such television series as The Saint, Court Martial, and The Avengers before capturing attention on the big screen with his role as the dim-witted Vernon Pinkley in The Dirty Dozen (1967). His breakout role, however, was Hawkeye Pierce, the lanky wisecracking and insubordinate surgeon in the satirical war classic M*A*S*H (1970). Another war film followed, the comedic Kelly’s Heroes (1970). In the taut Klute (1971) and Don’t Look Now (1973), he played characters who develop obsessive streaks while investigating the disappearance of a friend and the death of a daughter, respectively.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nSutherland portrayed a murderous fascist leader in the critically acclaimed Italian epic 1900 (1976) and a Nazi spy in the thriller Eye of the Needle (1981). Another classic dramatic role for Sutherland was as the tormented father in the Academy Award-winning film Ordinary People (1980). He played other paternal or avuncular film roles in A Dry White Season (1989), Cold Mountain (2003), The Italian Job (2003), Pride & Prejudice (2005; as the estimable Mr. Bennet), The Mechanic (2011), and The Eagle (2011).\n\nIn the realm of science fiction, Sutherland starred in the chilling remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and added a noteworthy gravitas to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992). Other movie credits included the Canadian film Threshold (1981), for which he won a Genie Award, and the adventure thriller Space Cowboys (2000). He portrayed the president of a dystopian society in the film adaptations (2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015) of the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins. Sutherland later had a supporting role in Ad Astra (2019), a futuristic drama in which an astronaut (played by Brad Pitt) searches the solar system for his missing father (Tommy Lee Jones). His later films included The Burnt Orange Heresy (2019), about an art heist, and the horror thriller Alone (2020).\n\nSutherland also appeared in a number of television productions, and he earned an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award as best performer in a supporting role for his turn in the made-for-TV movie Citizen X (1995), as the commanding officer on the trail of a Russian serial killer. He also received a Golden Globe for his role in Path to War (2002). His other television work included central roles in the series Commander in Chief (2005–06), Dirty Sexy Money (2007–09), and Crossing Lines (2013–15) and in the miniseries The Pillars of the Earth (2010). He later played oil baron J. Paul Getty in the anthology series Trust (2018), the first season of which concerned the 1973 kidnapping of Getty’s grandson. In 2020 Sutherland appeared in the miniseries The Undoing, about a therapist (played by Nicole Kidman) whose seemingly perfect life begins to unravel."
