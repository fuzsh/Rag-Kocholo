        "text": "Mosfilm (Russian: Мосфильм, pronounced [məsˈfʲɨlʲm]) is a film studio, which is often described as the largest and oldest in Russia and in Europe. Its output includes most of the more widely-acclaimed Soviet films, ranging from works by Tarkovsky and Eisenstein (commonly considered the greatest Soviet directors), to Red Westerns, to the Akira Kurosawa co-production (Дерсу Узала / Dersu Uzala) and the epic Война и Мир / War and Peace.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Selected films\n\n3 References\n\n4 External links\n\nHistory\n\nThe Moscow film production unit with studio facilities was established in November 1923 by the motion picture mogul Aleksandr Khanzhonkov (\"first film factory\") and I. Ermolev (\"third film factory\") as a unit of the Goskino works. The first movie filmed by Mosfilm was On the Wings Skyward (directed by Boris Mikhin).\n\nIn 1927 a new film studio complex was started to be built on Mosfilmovskaya Street in Sparrow Hills of Moscow. This film studio was named after Moscow amalgamated factory Soyuzkino the Tenth Anniversary of the October. In 1934 the film studio was renamed to Moskinokombinat, and in 1936 – to Mosfilm. During the World War II the film studio personnel were evacuated to Alma-Ata (August 1941) and merged with other Soviet production units into the Central United Film Studio (TsOKS). The Mosfilm personnel returned to Moscow at the end of 1943.\n\nThe famous Mosfilm logo, representing the monument \"Worker and Kolkhoz Woman\" by Vera Mukhina and Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin, was introduced in 1947 in the musical comedy, Spring directed by Grigori Aleksandrov and starring Lyubov Orlova and Nikolai Cherkasov.\n\nBy the end of the Soviet Union, Mosfilm had produced more than 3,000 films. Many film classics were shot at Mosfilm throughout its history and some of these were granted international awards at various film festivals.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Mosfilm continued operations as a quasi-private production company, led by the film director Karen Shakhnazarov. As of 2005, the company embraced ten independent studios, located within thirteen pavilions occupying the area of 13,000 sq. meters. Tours through this \"Russian Hollywood\" become increasingly popular, as they allow to view Mosfilm's enormous depot with 170 tanks and 50 vintage cars. The main pavilion is leased annually to hold the Golden Eagle Awards.\n\nIn 2011 Mosfilm released a selection of its classic films online for free viewing.[1]\n\nSelected films\n\n1925 Броненосец Потëмкин / The Battleship Potemkin (historical silent film), directed by Sergei Eisenstein\n\n1934 Весёлые ребята / Jolly Fellows (musical comedy)\n\n1935 Аэроград / Aerograd, directed by Alexander Dovzhenko (sci-fi)\n\n1936 Цирк / Circus (musical comedy)\n\n1938 Волга-Волга / Volga-Volga (musical comedy)\n\n1938 Александр Невский / Alexander Nevsky directed by Sergei Eisenstein (historical)\n\n1946 Иван Грозный (2 серия) / Ivan The Terrible, Part II, directed by Sergei Eisenstein (historical)\n\n1956 Илья Муромец / Ilya Muromets, directed by Aleksandr Ptushko (fantasy film)\n\n1957 Летят журавли / The Cranes Are Flying directed by Mikhail Kalatozov (war drama), Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1958 winner.\n\n1957 Огненные вёрсты / Miles of Fire (ostern) directed by Samson Samsonov\n\n1959 Баллада о солдате / Ballad of a Soldier directed by Grigori Chukhrai (war film), Special jury prize of Cannes Film Festival in 1959 winner and Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay in 1961 nominant.\n\n1960 Каток и скрипка / The Steamroller and the Violin directed by Andrei Tarkovsky (short film)\n\n1962 Иваново детство / Ivan's Childhood directed by Andrei Tarkovsky (feature film), the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival in 1962 winner.\n\n1962 Гусарская баллада / Hussar Ballad directed by Eldar Ryazanov (comedy)\n\n1963 Я шагаю по Москве / I Step Through Moscow directed by Georgi Daneliya (comedy)\n\n1964 Добро пожаловать, или Посторонним вход воспрещён / Welcome, or No Trespassing directed by Elem Klimov (comedy)\n\n1964 Я - Куба / I Am Cuba directed by Mikhail Kalatozov (expressionism, propaganda)\n\n1965 Похождения зубного врача / Adventures of a Dentist directed by Elem Klimov (comedy)\n\n1966 Андрей Рублёв / Andrei Rublev directed by Andrei Tarkovsky (feature film)\n\n1966 Берегись автомобиля / Watch Out for the Automobile directed by Eldar Ryazanov (comedy)\n\n1966 Неуловимые мстители / The Elusive Avengers directed by Edmond Keosayan (Ostern)\n\n1967 Вий / Viy (Film adaptation, horror film)\n\n1968 Война и мир / War and Peace directed by Sergei Bondarchuk (historical), Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968 winner.\n\n1968 Бриллиантовая рука / The Diamond Arm directed by Leonid Gaidai (comedy)\n\n1969 Освобождение/ Liberation directed by Yuri Ozerov (historical drama)\n\n1969 Братья Карамазовы / The Brothers Karamazov (historical), Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1969 nominant.\n\n1969 Белое солнце пустыни / White Sun of the Desert directed by Vladimir Motyl (Ostern)\n\n1971 Чайковский / Tchaikovsky directed by Igor Talankin (historical), Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1971 nominee.\n\n1971 Старики-разбойники / Stariki-razboyniki directed by Eldar Ryazanov (comedy)\n\n1972 Солярис / Solaris directed by Andrei Tarkovsky (sci-fi)\n\n1972 Джентльмены удачи / Gentlemen of Fortune (comedy)\n\n1973 Иван Васильевич меняет профессию / Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future directed by Leonid Gaidai (comedy)\n\n1974 Свой среди чужих, чужой среди своих / At Home Among Strangers directed by Nikita Mikhalkov (ostern)\n\n1974 Невероятные приключения итальянцев в России / Unbelievable Adventures of Italians in Russia directed by Franco Prosperi and Eldar Ryazanov\n\n1975 Дерзу Узала / Dersu Uzala (Soviet-Japanese joint production) directed by Akira Kurosawa (historical), Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1975 winner.\n\n1975 Сибириада / Siberiade directed by Andrei Konchalovsky (saga)\n\n1975 Афоня / Afonya directed by Georgi Daneliya (comedy)\n\n1975 Зеркало / The Mirror directed by Andrei Tarkovsky (feature film)\n\n1975 Ирония судьбы, или С лёгким паром!
