        "text": "While we should all take seriously the warning that “the theory of the cartoon has not yet stepped beyond simple cataloging” (Lev Atamanov), catalogues do have a time and place. Despite having one of the longest continuous traditions in world cinema, stretching from the early 20s to the modern day, Russian animation has never really acquired the same level of fan devotion that American and Japanese cartoons engender. There are a number of reasons for this, but the simplest – the language barrier, the Soviet bloc’s isolation, the failure of Russian animation to deal with the market economy – are likely the most decisive. Even those who might be their ideal audience don’t know where to start. The following is a catalogue, unabashedly, a synoptic history of the entirety of Russian animation from beginning to end. Of course this isn’t comprehensive (the lack of reliable online resources meant it could never be) but I hope this can provide an entry point for newcomers and animation enthusiasts alike to give this neglected corner of the animation world its due.\n\nLITTLE GREY NECK\n\nThough Tsarist Russia was home to Polish stop motion pioneer Ladislas Starevich, the Russian ‘tradition’ in animation really begins in the aftermath of the October Revolution. The Petrine order was swept away and revolutionary fervor fomented in its absence. Artists and critics called to purge Russian culture of any trace of the bourgeois, the refined, the decadent. Modernist abstraction took over the fine arts scene, with intellectuals speaking in terms of the objective, functional qualities of poems and architecture. It was the epoch of Malevich, Mayakovsky, and Eisenstein, and it would be decades before Soviet art saw this level of vitality again.\n\nThe cartoons weren’t exempt. Writes Sergei Asenin, “Soviet animation […] from the outset established itself as an art ideologically active, politically acute.” The earliest Soviet cartoons were made with a mixture of paper cutouts and drawn 2D, and were usually low budget, but no less eager in their attacks on bourgeois complacency. The very first Soviet cartoon was Soviet Toys by Alexander Ivanov and Dziga Vertov, the great documentarian behind A Man with a Movie Camera, but arguably the first cartoon of consequence was The Interplanetary Revolution by the trio of Nikolai Khodataev, Zenon Komissarenko, and Yuri Merkulov. With its angular forms and stark gradations, the film was a living, breathing specimen of the constructivist political poster. All three artists had come from the avant garde and approached the new medium with the same zeal. “We fancied ourselves as the Columbuses of animation” said Merkulov.\n\nKhodataev was the ringleader of the group, and a prolific writer on animation: “There were times when we had nothing to be proud of except our inexhaustible energy and our brave struggle to conquer the technology of this young art, so unfamiliar to us.” Like most Soviet animators during the 20s, they worked in a small adjunct to a larger film production studio. Komissarenko handled the design side of the films in a role similar to what would later be known as the ‘art director’. Though cartoons were niche, they weren’t completely ignored – the group’s second film, China in Flames, was given state backing.\n\nKhodataev was not satisfied with either the primitive technique of cutout animation or the stridency of agitprop. His ultimate goal was for dramatically robust, nuanced 2D cartoons. Now working with his students Zinaida and Valentina Brumberg and his sister Olga, Khodataev made The Samoyed Boy in 1928. Khodataev had hoped that purely 2D animation would allow for animation to convey complex emotions. “The almost realistic tone of The Samoyed Boy even gave us reason to think that with this film new horizons were opening up for animation in that it had now conquered serious genres and even tragedy.”\n\nAnother exemplary figure of this early period was Mikhail Tsekhanovsky. Tsekhanovsky was a modernist illustrator who made flip books, so he was a natural fit at the growing Leningrad studio. His debut, Post, was the very first Soviet sound cartoon (and made only two years after Steamboat Willie had claimed the same title in the States). Though Post was more radical in its design compared to its predecessors, its real innovation was in the dialectic between synchronized sound and image. Its novelty made it the industry’s first hit and it remains a cult classic among Russian animation fans today. Tsekhanovsky would experiment with sound synchronization further in Pacific 231, a live action film set to the music of Arthur Honegger, and in Abram Rom’s The Plan of the Large Works, where direct sound (a la McLaren) was first developed in Russia. Tsekhanovsky’s biggest endeavor was The Tale of the Priest and his Workman Balda, a feature length animated opera set to music by Soviet composer Dimitri Shostakovich. Production was steadily progressing until Shostakovich was censured for his “formalism” by the influential magazine Pravda and the project fell apart. Though a relatively large amount of footage was completed, German bombing campaigns in World War II destroyed all but a small snippet of the finished reels.\n\nCelluloid was not yet part of the animation pipeline but 2D cartoons still enjoyed decent popularity. 1927’s The Ice Rink featured both Ivan Ivanov-Vano and Daniel Cherkes as animators. At the time Cherkes was probably the best draughtsman in the industry and he helped to instill the importance of movement and confident lineart among the animators he worked with. Ivanov-Vano, who praised Cherkes highly in his autobiography, would later go on to be a pivotal figure in Russian animation after the war. In 1932 Ivanov-Vano and Leonid Amalric made Black and White, an adaptation of a Mayakovsky poem about labor conditions in Cuba, proving that the political poster fad had yet to subside. 1934’s Tsar Durondai, which Ivanov-Vano co-directed with the Brumberg sisters, was screened along with Tsekhanovsky’s Post to Disney animators when Frank Lloyd Wright visited the studio in 1939. Durondai’s dynamic, exotic designs were an inspiration to a young John Hubley, who would lead his own revolutionary vanguard at the Colombia studio only a few years later. For Ivanov-Vano himself, however, the influence cut the other way. As he matured, Ivanov-Vano set his mind on becoming a sort of Russian answer to Disney, directing lavishly animated fairy tales taken from Russian folklore.\n\nBy 1930, Ivanov-Vano, Cherkes, Ivanov, the Brumbergs, and almost all the other major players in the young industry were employed at the new Mezhrabpomfilm (a big exception: Alexander Ptushko, director of the grotesque stop motion feature The New Gulliver, worked at Mosfilm). But this slow and steady push for centralization came at a cost. Independent producers like Khodataev had enjoyed the freedom to chose their scripts and dictate the terms of their production. With state funding, the state had a bigger say. When the First Congress of Soviet Writers convened in 1934, Stalin’s representative declared that socialist realism was only true artistic movement of the revolutionary state (conveniently, this was the same year that the Hays Code went into effect in Hollywood). Avant gardists were left with a difficult choice. Khodataev directed The Music Box in 1933, with sinuous modern designs by Daniel Cherkes, before leaving the industry altogether. It seems that he believed, like Adorno, that it was “better to have no art at all than socialist realism.” However most, like Tsekhanovsky, chose to keep their jobs and sublimate themselves to the new hierarchy.\n\nThis was undoubtedly a serious blow the future of Russian animation, but there’s another perspective we can take. Unlike most animation industries the Russians drew their artists primarily from the intellectual class. Though there are stories of Hollywood artists like Shamus Culhane and Art Babbit straining against the tastelessness that surrounded them, in Russia it’s their defining narrative. This impulse could not be extinguished, merely made dormant. To quote Khodataev, “The animators gradually began to expand their artistic ambitions. Then it became clear that they were on the threshold of a great art, with great possibilities.” They would not forget that ambition.\n\nAN UNUSUAL MATCH\n\nThe 30s were a period of rapid growth for the young Russian animation industry. Viktor Smirnov, a former executive of the New York Soviet Film Office, imported the West’s assembly-line methods and division of labor. Celluloid, exposure sheets, and the distinction between key animators (literally “multipliers”) and inbetweeners (fazovka) were introduced. In 1936, the industry was unified under a single banner: Soyuzdetmultfilm, later renamed Soyuzmultfilm. These developments brought financial security to the animators but at a serious cost. “The rule was: do what Disney does. No drama, no feelings, no laughter,” said Fyodor Khitruk, a new hire at the time, “There was a clash between our Russian soul, emotional, sentimental, and this search for the funny things.” The main objective of Soyuzmultfilm during these early years was to find a compelling Communist alternative to Mickey Mouse.\n\nOn the other hand, before the rise of Soyuzmultfilm, animation in Russia was comparatively small time and the government’s reforms helped expand it to a level of complexity rivaling the West. As in America, Soyuzmultfilm’s cartoons would be screened as theatrical shorts, but unlike in the US state sponsorship helped the format survive longer than it might have otherwise. Moreover, the earliest Soyuzmultfilm cartoons weren’t restricted to the socialist realist canon. Take Olga Khodataev’s The Returned Sun, made in the studio’s first year. Design-wise it looks similar to The Samoyed Boy, but the propulsive rhythm and mechanical movement recalls the Fleischer Talkartoons. There was a push towards the end of the decade for films which idolized the “rugged proletariat hero” but this wouldn’t see its realization until after the war. For most of the 30s and the early 40s, Soviet cartoons were American knockoffs with a Russian twist.\n\nThat first generation of animators like Ivanov-Vano and the Brumberg sisters were promoted to the director’s chair. Because the industrial reforms called for increased output, more animators were needed to meet footage quotas. A new generation of animators joined the studio: Boris Dezhkin, Roman Daydov, Fedor Khitruk, Boris Titov, Lamis Bredis, Faina Yepifanova, and Lydia Reztsova. Of these Dezhkin is the most important. Dezhkin was an avid fan of Western cartoons and his work with satirist Vladimir Suteev on films like How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin and A Noisy Voyage established him as the studio’s best in technical ability and ingenuity. What’s more, Soyuzmultfilm historian Georgy Borodin speaks of a “Dezhkin school” emerging towards the end of the 30s, with the other animators adopting the plasticity in Dezhkin’s scenes. One animator, Gennady Filippov, was so studied in Dezhkinism as to animate scenes nigh indistinguishable from Dezhkin’s own. Around this time Sergei Eisenstein was praising the “plasmic” qualities in Disney’s films, and it seemed as if bouncy, fun animation wasn’t necessarily at odds with the repressive Soviet state.\n\n1939 saw drastic changes on several fronts. The studio reorganized and new production standards were enforced to ensure a higher level of quality. An animation program was set up at the VGIK film school and Ivanov-Vano became its main instructor. Many employees were laid off for failing to meet the new standards, and were eventually replaced by graduates of Ivanov-Vano’s program. Soviet animators began experimenting with rotoscope (which they nicknamed ‘Eclair’ based on the brand for the projection stand) in the Brumbergs’ The Tale of Tsar Saltan. This experimentation in rotoscope would be crucial to the broader push towards socialist realism in the 50s. To cap it all off, the Great Patriotic War began in June 1941, leading to the relocation of the Soyuzmultfilm studio from Moscow to Samarkand and many of its employees serving in the Red Army. Wartime propaganda like Kino-Circus were incredibly modest by most standards but still required the combined efforts of the entire studio to pull off.\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the war was just as eventful. Tricolor processing was developed and camera operator Nikolai Voinov experimented with expanded techniques like filming through plexiglass. A new generation of animators and directors joined the studio: Roman Kachanov, Boris Stepantsev, Ivan Aksenchuk, Boris Butakov, Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin, among others. The studio also released its first two animated features. The first, The Lost Letter, directed by the Brumberg sisters, was an adaptation of one of Gogol’s Ukrainian tales. Though the film uses eclair here and there, it’s clearly a triumph of the Dezhkin school. Demons, drunken hallucinations, and rowdy Cossacks are vividly rendered by Dezhkin’s rugged drawings and Alexander Ptushko’s ghoulish art direction. The film was the most successful example of the grotesque in Soviet cartooning since Tsekhanovsky’s Balda, and would remain so for the next couple decades.\n\nThe second was Ivanov-Vano’s The Humpbacked Horse, based on the fairy tale by Pyotr Yershov. If The Lost Letter was a consolidation of Soyuzmultfilm’s development up to that point, then Horse anticipated the studio’s future, with its rustic Slavic charm, simplistic moral sentiment, and fairy tale source. The film was successful on its own terms but outside of Lev Milchin’s bold art direction there was little that might provoke disagreement or reflection. To his credit Ivanov-Vano made full use of the studio’s resources and proved that feature animation was viable in the Russian state. But the end result was somewhat retrograde. At any rate more engaging than the cartoons of the 50s, it was their clear and immediate ancestor.\n\nFAMILIAR PICTURES\n\nBy 1950, the rough edges of The Lost Letter would be unthinkable. Stalin’s tyranny extended its reach to all aspects of Russian life, even as tiny a corner as cartoon production. Were it not for the intervention of Ivan Aksenchuk and Eugene Migunov, Soyuzmultfilm likely would’ve suffered a purge for “Disney imitation” and “cosmopolitanism,” with Dezhkin an obvious target. Georgy Borodin argues that a purge “could’ve been one of the biggest blows to Soyuzmultfilm” had it occurred. Instead, the studio and its employees survived, but only as a factory for communist banality. A few films, like the Brumberg sisters’ Fyodor Zaitsev, had traces of the prewar verve but otherwise Russian cartoons became bland, literal children’s films with no wrinkle of ambiguity and universally dominated by rotoscope. Tsekhanovsky’s fishmongers and street urchins couldn’t be further removed from the farmers, policeman, and other noble proletariats that infested these postwar films. It’s no exaggeration to say that the cartoons produced by Soyuzmultfilm in the 50s were, in the words of Milton Knight, “the most boring films on Earth.”\n\nBut that doesn’t tell us the full story. Though it’s certainly a cruel irony to make the artists, many of whom had witnessed some of the worst atrocities known to man while serving on the Eastern Front, produce cutesy trifles, those in the Russian animation community were growing tired of Western cartoons on their own. In 1947, Eisenstein lamented that Russia’s animators were not forging their own path. In some ways the 50s could also be read as an attempt to work out a uniquely Russian tradition, independent from the West, even though restrictions on content were an unavoidable handicap. “The post war years,” said Ivanov-Vano “were for our animation an intensive period of development.”\n\nMost of these developments were small, like the use of fluorescent dyes in Ivanov-Vano’s Snow Maiden, an idea proposed by art director Viktor Nikitin, but some were much more extreme. Perhaps out of dissatisfaction from the turn the studio had taken, Boris Dezhkin became a director (often working alongside Mtislav Pashenko, who would keep Dezhkin’s temperament in check). As an animator Dezhkin was tasked with self-contained action scenes (Borodin calls them divertimenti), and this expertise translated well to his directorial work. Dezhkin’s films were usually sports-themed, revolving around a single match of cycling, soccer, hockey, etc. Because he cast only animal characters in his films, he was able to avoid the worst excesses of rotoscope. After a string of small successes he directed An Unusual Match in 1955, far and away his most popular film. Though the animation might seem lethargic by American standards, within the context of Soviet cartoons at the time it’s a dramatic exception. The basic formula of Unusual Match, where a team of younger boys play honorably against a group of ruffians, would be endlessly recycled by Dezhkin in his later films, but in 1955 it had a galvanizing effect.\n\nAnother major development was the reopening of the puppet and stop motion department in 1953. Stop motion had always been an ancillary concern for the artists at Soyuzmultfilm but it saw renewed interest after the war. Elastic materials were employed in the models’ construction, joints were made more versatile, and replacement animation was used for the first time. There was several important hires, like Roman Kachanov and later Vyacheslav Shilobreyev and Pavel Petrov, while Roman Gurov’s dolls set a high bar of quality for the department’s future modelists.\n\nThere was also the slow intrusion of modern design. The art director was still subject to strict scrutiny, but comparatively less than the artists, writers, and directors. It was through the art directors that modern design of the UPA sort took hold at Soyuzmultfilm. Eugene Migunov was an art director who rose to a position of prominence in the studio during the 50s. A noted wit and a perceptive critic who chronicled the goings-on at the studio in great detail, Migunov was among the first to attack Stalinist dogma. His second film, Familiar Pictures from 1957, would be his most major accomplishment in this respect. Pictures was important for two reasons: first, it was an adult-themed observational comedy at a time when childish fairy tales held an absolute monopoly, and second, its characters were drawn depthless and non-naturalistic. The latter was a conscious decision by Migunov, one he decided upon after seeing animator Fyodor Khitruk’s test footage and hating it. After finishing the finale, the film received an OK from the Arts Council and Migunov declared “Long live the static!” Moreover, satire found a ideological pretext; by identifying silly and ridiculous behavior, it could teach humans to understand their weaknesses and become more efficient (and unsurprisingly, much of the early satirical cartoons were at least lightly instructional in nature). Though Pictures wasn’t the first Soviet film to use pose-to-pose and shallow construction, it made it a valid tool for the next generation to take advantage of. Migunov is a convenient example but this push for modern design and adult satire was widespread, if gradual: just compare Tsekhanovsky’s Kashtanka from 1952 with Alexander Ivanov’s Chudesnitsa from 1957.\n\nBut Familiar Pictures was atypical for the era. Most cartoons from the 50s were as flavorless as that Milton Knight quote implies. But that doesn’t mean they should be ignored. Lev Atamanov was the most prominent director in this mode, responsible for a number of old school classics like The Scarlet Flower, The Golden Antelope, The Yellow Stork, and The Snow Queen. Atamanov came from Armenia and produced the country’s first animated film but later immigrated to Russia and studied under montage theorist Lev Kuleshov. Though a promoter of childlike fantasy in the vein of Ivanov-Vano, his sources weren’t restricted to Russian folklore, but included Chinese and Indian mythology and Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tales. According to longtime collaborator Leonid Schvartzman, Atamanov drew like an amateur and Schvartzman and Alexander Vinokurov had to draw the storyboards for Atamanov’s films themselves. However Atamanov’s title was anything but ceremonial; he was committed to his projects (for The Snow Queen, he flew to Copenhagen to soak in the surroundings) and would make all the consequential decisions. In the case of The Snow Queen, he famously chose to cast Fyodor Khitruk as the character animator for Ole Lukøje without the aid of rotoscope. Khitruk was one of the studio’s best animators, second only to Dezhkin, and specialized in scenes of extended acting and the experience on Snow Queen inspired in him a philosophy something like Frank Thomas’s and Ollie Johnston’s illusion of life. “Somehow I had […] the audacity to claim that in a certain sense an animator is comparable to a little god,” breathing life into inanimate matter. Khitruk’s assignment was the beginning of the end for the Eclair.\n\nAtamanov believed that “The purpose of art in general and animation in particular is […] to help navigate life. To understand the sea of feelings, emotions, characters, actions, events…To help distinguish the truth from lies, and half-truths,” that, ultimately, “art is Ariadne’s clew”. This idea was both useful to the Soviet authorities who wanted purely didactic art and amenable to the artists who wanted to have some kind of meaning to their labor. But he wasn’t a charlatan – far from it. He earnestly believed in the value of the fairy tale, and made his films his own in a way that has no comparison with his contemporaries. It’s no surprise that Atamanov is viewed by historians as a transitional figure between the conservative 50s and the revolutionary times that followed.\n\nTHE CAMERAMAN’S REVENGE\n\nStalin died in 1953, and Khrushchev formally denounced him in 1956, leading to the beginning of the Khrushchev Thaw. The animation industry, like everywhere else, felt the change. Foreign literature, music, and cinema flooded in, and the animators were not free from their pull; during the Thaw, Soyuzmultfilm held world cinema screenings every week. Though there was still plenty of oversight in the form of a semi-independent screenwriting board and the general ubiquity of state censorship, the studio benefitted from an enormous reduction in its bureaucracy. Artists started to outnumber technocrats, and from 1956 to 1961 a batch of new hires came out of the VGIK, including Anatoly Petrov, Marina Voskaniants, Violetta Kolesnikov, Galina Barinova, Valery Ugarit, Gennady Sokolsky, Victor Arsentev, Yuri Norstein, and Anatoly Solin, to name a few. Moreover, the studio was as prolific as ever, with roughly 30 films a year being produced, a third of which were now aimed at teenage or adult audiences. The need for talented camera operators, art directors, animators, and sound directors increased. The workload could be so daunting that art directors had to work in pairs and animators had to work overtime, but to the employees this was a fair tradeoff for their creative freedom.\n\nThe older artists, almost all of them directors, did not shy away from these developments. Atamanov made foreward-thinking films like The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep, Ballerina on the Ship, and Bench. The latter was a tribute to the Lumieres with art by the Dutch communist Herluf Bidstrup, and was Atamanov’s favorite of his own work. The Brumberg sisters directed Big Trouble, drawn in the style of a children’s doodles, with novice Lana Azarkh as their art director. Even Ivan Aksenchuk, a relatively conservative director by most standards, was behind the studio’s progressive adaptation of The Little Mermaid. With its tragic ending and elaborately latticed visuals, the film is seen by critics as encapsulating the decade’s trends.\n\nHowever, it was the new directors who made the biggest impact. Roman Davydov was the studio’s main horse animator during the 40s and 50s, yet he was often at odds with the rest of the 2D department. Migunov points out that Davydov’s preference for the schematic and the rigid wasn’t compatible with the Dezhkin school’s fluidity. After a brief stint at the stop motion department, he started directing 2D films of his own. Right out of the gate his earliest works, like Kolobok and especially Shareholders, demonstrated a color sensibility that borders on Fauvism. This was toned down in Mowgli, his adaptation of Kipling’s Jungle Book, but that series became far and away his most popular. Georgy Borodin argues (somewhat unconvincingly) that if Dezhkin’s animation was the most ‘American’ animator at the studio then Davydov’s was the most ‘Japanese’, though it’s true that Davydov introduced a new sensibility to the studio, taking the modern design of Migunov et al to its nature conclusion. It’s worth noting that the art director of Shareholders, Perch Sargysian, was able to ascend to directorship by the mid 60s and directed two films before dying at the age of 48 in 1970. Sargysian’s death was tragic, but his rapid promotion shows how weak a force precedence was by this point.\n\nFyodor Khitruk was far and away the most prominent director of the 60s, though he didn’t warm to the idea of direction at first. “People had already suggested that I direct a film, but, at the time, I didn’t have a good idea. Besides I loved being an animator.” Many of Khitruk’s colleagues were skeptical at the idea, cautioning that it’s “better to be first in the village than last in the city.” But Khitruk proved capable. His first film, The Story of a Crime, was a wry satire about urban housing made with a mix of cel and collage. It was the first in a series of hits for Khitruk: Boniface’s Vacation, Toptyzhka, The Man in the Frame, Film Film Film, Island, Icarus and the Wise Men, and a very popular adaptation of A. A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh. The critical appetite for animated films at this time favored pithy adult satires made with limited animation like what UPA and Zagreb were producing, so it’s no surprise that Khitruk’s films picked up a number of awards at international festivals. Mikhail Tumelya summed up Khitruk’s reputation well when he said that “Khitruk succeeded in expressing all of his talents at once: his gift as a director, an animator, an actor, an educator and, above all, as a human being.”\n\nBut Khitruk’s biggest innovations happened behind the scenes. He and Migunov streamlined the production process, supporting a “brigade method” where a crew of artists and animators worked closely together during the preparatory stages. Laying the groundwork for the studio’s auteur streak in the 70s and 80s, he expanded how much detail was contained in the director’s script, especially with regard to timing. He also helped other artists become directors themselves, leading to a strong sense of loyalty among his fellow staff. Praise for the man can sometimes seem excessive – Alexander Tatarsky once called him “an early Christ”, whose every word was his command, and “If he and I were in the Mafia, I’d obey every single one of his orders,” – but the impact he had on the studio is undeniable.\n\nThe stop motion department was undergoing a number of changes as well. Having increased their production capabilities to a sustainable level, the stopmo animators began experimenting. The eccentric Mayakovsky adaptation The Bath House by Sergei Yutkevich and Anatoly Karanovic was described by Sergei Asenin as exhausting the entire arsenal of the studio’s stop motion techniques, but the average film wasn’t all that far behind (incidentally Yutkevich and Karanovic would make the feature length Mayakovsky Laughs in 1975, which was to 2D cel what Bath House was to stop motion). There was the rise of bas relief animation, which put 3D models against a 2D pictorial space, and a resurgence in paper cutouts, sometimes known as “overlayed” animation.\n\nThere was also the emergence of strong creative voices among their directors. Vladimir Degtyarev directed The End of the Black Bog, The Oversalted, a Chekhov adaptation written by Eugene Migunov, and Who said ‘Meow’?, described by Natalia Venzher as being “about the happiness of discovering the world.” Ivanov-Vano joined the stop motion division in the 60s, where he would spend the rest of his career. Ivanov-Vano’s tenure at the department is a little controversial; Georgy Borodin criticized Ivanov-Vano’s practice of crediting himself as director even if his role was purely supervisory. But he was a supportive teacher, encouraging his students to advance up the ranks to directorship, and within the context of the rest of his career, films like A Flying Proletarian (from Mayakovsky), How One Man Fed Two Generals (from Saltykov-Shchedrin), and Lefty (from Leskov) constitute quite possibly his strongest body of work. According to Yuri Norstein, Ivanov-Vano “linked with a single thread the formalistic quest of the 1920s and the modern day auteur animation.”\n\nThe titan of Soviet model animation was Roman Kachanov. A man with the physique of a boxer, an infinite sense of kindness, “a connoisseur of the child’s soul and a jeweler in his work,” (Sergei Kapkov), Kachanov was to stop motion what Khitruk was to cel. “Without him I probably wouldn’t have become a filmmaker,” said Yuri Norstein, one of Kachanov’s students. Kachanov joined Soyuzmultfilm after seeing Disney’s Victory Through Air Power during the war (in a bit of dramatic irony, he later met Ollie Johnston, who animated his favorite scene from that film). His early outing The Cloud in Love, written by Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet, was the first real demonstration of the bas relief style. With Masha and the Bear Kachanov was working with dolls that had no mouths so he placed a greater emphasis on physical acting and pantomime, and away from dialogue (this parallel what Jiri Trnka had been doing in Czechslovakia during the last decade). He trained many animators, including Nikolai Serebryakov and Natalia Dabizha, and was a close friend and inspiration for Japanese stop motion great Kihachiro Kawamoto.\n\nFilms like Mitten and The Letter may have been a tad syrupy, but they expressed their author’s personality in a way few Soviet stop motion cartoons had up to this point. His biggest success was the Cheburashka trilogy: Gena the Crocodile, Cheburashka, and Shapoklyak. The films were a soft edged slice-of-life following a dandified crocodile, a elderly woman with an appetite for petty larceny, and a unknown mammalian creature from overseas named Cheburashka. Thanks in part to Leonid Schvartzman’s charming models, the series became a beloved classic in Russia and was chosen as the country’s mascot during the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nThere were a number of minor directors who had their start in the 60s. Boris Stepantsev is mainly known for his adaptation of The Kid and Carlson, but he also experimented with paint-on-celluloid in Song of the Falcon (based on the Gorky poem of the same name) and live action composite in Not Now (based on a script by Vladimir Suteev). Inessa Kovalevskaya made the folkpop hit Bremen Town Musicians with set pieces animated by Elvira Maslov and Alexander Davydov, Roman Davydov’s son. Later in her career she would make several films based on Russian classical music, like Dancing Dolls, Pictures at an Exhibition, and Children’s Album, where she allowed her animators a relatively high degree of freedom. Yefim Gamburg made Western satires like The Passion of Spies and The Robbery Like… as well as experimental outings like Blue Puppy, where the fills were animated without lines (cf the Hubleys’ Adventures of a *). Vladimir Pekar and Alexandra Snezhko-Blotskaya focused on the past, with the former directing ethnographic films about the art of the Peruvian Indians, the ancient Egyptians, and other world cultures, and the latter directing a cycle of films about ancient Greece. None of these directors occupied the studio’s top tier but they contributed to the growing sense of authorship in the Soviet cartoon.\n\nOne thing that didn’t change were salaries; the average Soyuzmultfilm employee was poor. The exception were those that could teach on the side at the VGIK, like Ivanov-Vano, but their number was few. Nonetheless the atmosphere at the studio was as congenial as ever. Lana Azarkh, art director of the Brumbergs’ Big Trouble, described it as “second home”, where “someone’s child was always running around the floors” and all holidays were strictly observed. With fewer creative restrictions, an inviting studio culture, and plenty of industrial muscle, one can hardly imagine more favorable conditions for Soyuzmultfilm going into the 70s.\n\nMAN IN THE FRAME\n\nGiven that in Russia industrial animation strictly delineated key animators from directors (as opposed to artisanal animation where the director and animator are one in the same such as Canada’s National Film Board and France’s ORTF), one would expect individualist key animation of the American and Japanese kind to evolve at the studio. But in watching most Russian cartoons, even the ones praised for their animation, it can be difficult to isolate any individual animator’s hand. Some argue that this was a fundamental flaw of the system. Vladimir Vyshegorodtsev relates that animators were seen as lesser in the Soyuzmultfilm hierarchy, and that layouts were so constricting that animators were limited in their ability to render motion. Vyshegorodtsev claims that many of the ‘errors’ and odd timing quirks that Western observers notice in Russia animation (such as the drunken swaying of characters, even in repose) were due to the animators being forced to work around the requirements of the art director, who could hold a level of influence over the animation comparable to the Japanese sakkan. Ideya Garanina once said that “The job of the art director and the director are intertwined,” and there are far more examples of close partnerships between art directors and directors than animators and directors. At the extreme end you had directors like Aksenchuk, who passed directing scripts to storyboard artists whole rather than in parts, limiting the animators’ ability to experiment, and Khitruk, whose instructions on timing and movement were so detailed that there was little left for the animator to invent.\n\nIt’s rarely a smart idea to judge an entire national tradition on the standards of another, and Vyshegorodtsev, who was a convert to the Western system of animation, is not exactly an impartial judge. From the start, Russian animators did specialize: Fyodor Khitruk would handle intensive acting, Boris Dezhkin was assigned the broader stuff, Boris “Busia” Butakov drew lifelike animals, Marina Voskaniants animated and choreographed dancing (such as in this famous scene in Stepantsev’s Nutcracker), and so on. But the individualism of the West didn’t necessarily apply. Neither does the West’s notions of character acting, as when Atamanov rails against “mistaken artists” who believe only in excessive naturalism and the Stanislavsky system. Blogger Niffiwan says that of Paul Wells’s various criteria for the cartoon body, only “Bodies of humans/animals/creatures which are apparently incompatible are rendered equable in size, strength, ability, etc.” and “Bodies may re-determine the physical orthodoxies of gender and species,” apply to the Russian cartoon. Bodies aren’t malleable, fragmentary, or impossible. They’re solid and holistic. Likewise, the actions that a body may perform are modest and non-transformative. But it isn’t strictly naturalistic either. Their animation’s languid timing had the effect of reducing gestures to discrete units, with chains of action rarely forming a continuous flow. A quote by Alexander Ptushko is relevant here: “The movement of dolls and gestures should not blindly repeat the motions of living people, but only to synthesize them.” As is this one by Fyodor Khitruk: “Animation is the art of concentration. And caricature? […] Caricature means bringing out what is characteristic.” In many cases there was a jarring disunity between form and intent but in the best cases it could lend the animation an archaic quality, closer to Medieval icon painting’s stability of line than the Renaissance’s spatialization of form.\n\nFor example take Victor Arsentev. Arsentev was Dezhkin’s best student, and appeared in several of Dezhkin’s later films. He became the lead animator on Nu pogodi, the Russian take on Road Runner, and his work on the series (like this iceskating scene from episode 8) is highly esteemed. This is animation which is balanced, poised, and accurate but tells you very little about Arsentev himself. I’m reminded of Jaime Weinman’s defense of Friz Freleng’s lack of stylization in his Warner Brothers cartoons: “it’s meant to bounce off the reactions of a large audience in a darkened theater, not someone sitting on a couch who’s free to look away.” Though Freleng’s punchy timing was far removed from Arsentev’s strict precision, the argument follows a similar conclusion. You can’t view Arsentev’s cuts outside the reception of the film itself – you have to watch it all the way through. It’s more Virgil Ross than Manny Gould. Moreover, a lack of style doesn’t imply a lack of skill. When Anatoly Solin was directing How the Fox Tried to Catch Up to a Hare, Arsentev animated this complicated sequence without breaking perspective once.\n\nThe best animator in this mode was easily Anatoly Petrov, who gave this tendency its motto: “In a good animator, the artist must die.” Petrov had a remarkable command of form and was prized for his skill in tackling the trickiest of shots. He was a Renaissance man who sought to represent the intricacies of any subject he focused on, from deep sea life to cubism. Petrov eventually became a director but unlike most of his peers Petrov desired to have more, not less, involvement in the animation than he did as an animator. One of his earlier films, And Mother Will Forgive Me Too, was praised by Khitruk for its technique. “[With] conventional cartoon characters […] we do not feel any danger, any sense of height. But here the heart skips a beat at the sight of a boy who crawls towards the swinging rope, because the authenticity of the movement urges us to.” Towards this end Petrov developed a new technique called photographica. By separating the contour and color fill on two different planes, Petrov could make his figures look truly solid and three-dimensional. His masterpieces Polygon and Heracles Admetus show this fidelity to the real in full force. Petrov’s wife Galina Barinova used a similar technique in her own films When Sand Will Rise, Once Upon a Time, and her adaptation of Gabdulla Tukai’s Shurale. Despite these experiments in medium, however, Petrov’s animation operated under the same principles as Arsentev even though, like fellow perspectivists Hiroyuki Okiura and Milt Kahl, Petrov’s hyperrealism could subtly undermine the very tradition he was trying to prop up.\n\nStill, it wouldn’t be accurate to say there was no stylization at Soyuzmultfilm. Petrov’s and Arsentev’s animation was called “mechanistic” by some contemporaries, and the 60s and 70s brought in some more adventurous animators from VGIK, including Yuri Meshcheryakov, Alexander Mazaev, Yuri Kuzyurin, and Anatoly Abarenov. Sadly, animator drafts and scene credits are notoriously hard to come by online, so attaching a name to any particular cut is extraordinarily difficult for the amateur scholar (for instance Violetta Kolesnikova, widely praised as among the studio’s upper tier, but is seemingly without a single scene credit). There were some directors who marshaled these new animators together. Alexander Gorlenko, himself an animator, made films with looser drawings and movement such as Moscow hippy favorite The Magnifying Glass and his adaptation of Lithuanian writer Kazys Saja’s About Bumble Bees and Kings. Natalia Golovanova directed a trilogy of films – A Boy is a Boy, The Cat and the Clown, and The Soldier and the Devil – which were semi-improvised, ceding an unprecedented level of control of the film over to the animators. Though it was generally the case that the best examples of 2D animation in Russia came from the artisans, not the assembly lines, there are enough examples otherwise that one cannot dismiss Russian key animation without qualification.\n\nA MOUNTAIN OF GEMS\n\nIf any period in Russian animation can be called its ‘Golden Age’, then it must surely be the 70s and 80s. By then Soyuzmultfilm had become a powerhouse in the animation world, having won more than 100 prizes at international festivals of all types. The studio had become a creative nexus where artists, writers, and musicians not generally associated with animation would stop by and write a script or song or two for an upcoming cartoon. Censorship was scaled back even further: censors were more likely to request a small change after the film’s script had been approved and production underway than reject the script before production began, as was the case in the 50s. The actual creative mediums were varied as well. Backgrounds were produced via watercolor, crayon, pastel, tempera, sepia, colored pencils, collage, felt tipped pens, velvet paper, pencil collotype, and more. Camera operation became increasingly complex with optical printing, multiple exposure, distortion filters, underwater photography, unusual lighting setups, and even some early digital processing, making the camera operator a role as creatively essential as the art director and the animator. “Many directors, in fact, invented their own methods and modified them film-to-film,” writes Georgy Borodin. There were more series films too, the most important of which was Merry Carousel. Formed in 1969 by Roman Kachanov, Merry Carousel was a yearly omnibus were young animators could test the waters for a directorial career. Merry Carousel ensured the studio a steady supply of enthusiastic young directors, helping individuals like Anatoly Petrov and Alexander Gorlenko make the jump.\n\nIn a survey of animation written in the early 90s, Vadim Kurchevsky laid out his theory of the medium. “I am deeply convinced that the animated film is to cinema what poetry is to great literature. We poets share common materials – conciseness, stylistic precision, hyperbole, metaphor, rhythm.” The animated short, far from being limiting in its length, offered artists the opportunity to be concise and exact in their description. The animated short was thus seen as a site of intense personal reflection.\n\nThere were so many great artists during this era that to reduce their accomplishments to paragraph length would be barbaric. Nevertheless, I’ll try to give an effective summary of each major player within these constraints.\n\nAndrei Khrzhanovsky made his debut with his diploma film There Was Kozyavin, which possessed a Kafkaesque bite that writer Sergei Gerasimov later described as “our socialist surrealism.” His second film Glass Harmonica may have gone too far, with Soviet authorities banning it largely due to its incomprehensibility. A satire of capitalism, Khrzhanovsky seemed to make no real distinction between the Soviet and American systems. In 1977 Khrzhanovsky embarked on his most important project, the Pushkin trilogy – I fly to you like a memory…, And I’m with you again…, and Autumn. The films were based on Pushkin’s sketchbooks, which by putting “into play the very texture of the poet’s manuscripts, animating his draft drawings as a backdrop to a rich textual collage of verses, letters, diaries and such,” he was trying “to reacquire the most sacred icon of the national culture, long expropriated and exploited both by officialdom and mass culture” (Giannalberto Bendazzi). The “emblematic cultural gesture of the time,” Khrzhanovsky would revisit this format for docu-films about Federico Fellini and Estonian painter Hulot Sooster.\n\nVadim Kurchevsky and Nikolai Serebryakov formed a tight duo during their first few films, but they split up and pursued highly successful solo careers. Kurchevsky’s debut, My Green Crocodile, was a nonsensical love story but convincing in its Baroque decoration. For each of his subsequent films, Kurchevsky would manage a subtle interplay between the lighting and the colorful, ornate texture of his models. The results were often striking, such in his two films about Mozart. However Kurchevsky’s magnum opus is definitely The Master of Clamecy, an adaptation of Romain Rolland’s novel Colas Bruegnon. Though taking inspiration from Breughel and Medieval stained glass, and with a main character based on Cezanne’s self-portraits, Alexander Vasilkov argues that Kurchevsky’s effort to integrate background and foreground allowed the film to transcend mere quotation.\n\nThough technically a solo director, Serebryakov’s art director and wife Alina Speshnev arguably deserves as much credit as him as she was essentially coequal in the decision-making process. Unlike Kurchevsky, Serebryakov’s films weren’t always model based – one of his more acclaimed works was a cutout/montage frieze in tribute to Pablo Neruda – but his best ones generally were. Compared to Kurchevsky, Serebryakov and Speshnev preferred a more active camera, with canted angles, closeups, and faster cutting. They used the absence of light as much as Kurchevsky used its presence. This is all evident in their masterpiece Razluchennye, a pop opera spin on Yuri Olesha’s Three Fat Men. Alexander Vasilkov points out how “Compared to the book, the social themes in the film were muted […] The main opposition becomes animate and inanimate, freedom and unfreedom, with some dolls acting as living characters […] with others – the fat men and courtiers – closer to soulless machinery.”\n\nEduard Nazarov had worked as an art director on Khitruk’s Winnie the Pooh. The lapidary nature of Khitruk’s direction no doubt influenced Nazarov, whose films have a similarly tight control of character layouts and timing. Nazarov made a few elliptical comedies in the 80s like Once Upon a Time There Lived a Dog and Journey of an Ant before retiring. Though finding the process of animation exhausting, Nazarov exerted a strong influence on the rest of the studio during his post-directorial career.\n\nIdeya Garanina didn’t have that long of a career in the industry either but she left an exceptional body of work. “I see everything very clearly myself, but in order to make sense of all this, I have to convey to the composer my hearing, to the artist my sight, and to the camera operator, the animation.” She never deviated from her vision, no matter how onerous it was to pull off. It’s thought that no other director expanded the role of camera operator as far as Garanina. She effectively turned the modalities of camera operation into their own form of animation, realizing Tsekhanovsky’s observation that in cartoons “all the basic equipment of cinematography are directed to serve a different purpose.” This is clear in her exceptionally rich adaptation of Karazim’s Poor Liza, but it takes on an elevated purpose in Balagan. Based on a mishmash of plays by Federico Garcia Lorca, Balagan starts off as a ribald cabaret show in the form of puppet theater before transforming into a brooding symbolist aria, the theater’s machinery having overheated. Giannalberto Bendazzi called the film “one of the most beautiful ever made in volumetric animation.” Her last major work was The Cat Who Walked Herself, a feature based on the Just So story by Kipling and a summum opus of the studio by the end of the 80s.\n\nVladimir Tarasov wasn’t all that accomplished as an artist before becoming a director, and rarely had the best staff on his films, but he was the premier representative of science fiction at Soyuzmultfilm. His earlier films like Contact and The Return have that mixture of the commonplace and the uncanny that defines Russian scifi, but it was his angst-ridden Pereval that would be his main legacy. With songs performed by a howling Alexander Gradsky, Pereval let off a tone both urgent and modern, and was immediately relevant to the younger Muscovites who, like the protagonists, would inherit the technological order their parents had created.\n\nValery Ugarov is hard to pin down stylistically, moving from Yellow Submarine trippiness in his Merry Carousel short and A Box With a Secret to exotic Orientalism in Caliph Stork (from Wilhelm Hauff’s fairy tale) and Gaelicism in Finding Oluen (from the Welsh Mabinogion). According to Sergei Kapkov, Ugarov was prized for his animation long after he became a director, and his colleagues constantly tried to recruit him to their projects. Unfortunately, one of Ugarov’s most celebrated films, Obsession Rodamusa Quirke, doesn’t appear to be available online.\n\nNina Shorina has been described by Jayne Pilling as “One of the only woman animators in the former Soviet Union to have created a substantial body of work that ranks her along the established (male) names in Soviet animation.” This is an exaggeration as there were many female animators her equal, but that only underscores the studio’s strength. Shorina’s earlier films like Poodle and Door are first rate farces, while her later works like The Dream, Alter Ego, and The Draught are dense tapestries of experience and memory. Cyril Razlogov describes Dream as “a kind of film-centaur, stream-of-consciousness following different paths and bound together only by a ‘superfluous man’ – that tragic constant of the Russian intelligentsia.”\n\nValentin Karavayev directed a number of harmless children’s films like Return of the Prodigal Parrot but his passion was for blackly cynical adaptations of Saltykov-Shchedrin’s comedies like The Wise Gudgeon and The Story of a Town. In those films Karavayev mixed cutouts with 2D in a way that straddled the boundaries between the two mediums. Karavayev’s 1987 adaptation of Turgenev’s Mumu was described by Georgy Borodin as one of the studio’s most striking films during the late 80s. Karavayev had hoped to launch a long-running series called Field Marshal Pulkina in the nineties but funding difficulties dashed his plans.\n\nElena Gavrilko’s films Girlfriend and Parable of the Mouse are wordless and drawn in a deliberately naive manner, essentially animated primitivism. Natalia Lukinykh praises how in her films “serious moral and philosophical themes are ‘discussed’ without a word.” She was one of the more unique 2D stylists of the younger generation.\n\nAnd of course there was Yuri Norstein. Norstein has been almost universally praised as the chief artist of Russian animation and one of the greatest animators of all time. Before getting his start as a director, Norstein was a stop motion animator working under Kachanov and Ivanov-Vano. Though Ivanov-Vano was a fan of Leskov’s literary flair and wanted to adapt Lefty for years, he thought “the bright, colorful form of literary language required searching for a visual equivalent,” which Norstein was more than willing to oblige. On Ivanov-Vano’s Lefty, Norstein removed the joints from the paper dolls to allow for greater control over the figure’s movement. The other animators thought it was ridiculous but Norstein turned it into his artistic signature. After co-directing a film with Arkady Tyurin and another with Ivanov-Vano, Norstein began his solo career. His first film, The Fox and the Hare, is clearly indebted to the studio’s fabulistic tradition but with The Heron and the Crane and Hedgehog in the Fog, a uniquely Norstein wistfulness took over. This led to Tale of Tales, a Proustian meditation on Russian history and childhood, often considered one of the greatest animated films ever made. After Tales Norstein’s profile skyrocketed and he became the figurehead for the entire auteur movement. Norstein was solely responsible for the animation, direction, and script in all his films (though the art direction was done by his wife Franchesca Yarbusova) making him the perfect example of Kurchevsky’s animator-poet. “It seems to me that a much greater concentration is inherent in the animated film than in other cinematic art. I always think of it as a formula: the volumetric weight of animation, or, if you will, the concentration of the movement in relation to filmic time is significantly higher than in any other film genre.” Norstein animated several scenes in Khrzhanovsky’s Pushkin trilogy and, by the 80s, was steeped in his newest project, an adaptation of Nikolai Gogol’s The Overcoat.\n\nThere were others, less literarily adept, who were still important to the “golden fund of Russian animation”. Gennady Sokolsky, a Merry Carousel grad, was far more conservative than his peers, preferring the soft lyricism of fairy tales and older Soviet cartoons as can be seen in Silver Hoof. Stanislav Sokolov, the man who invented the backlighting effect in Aksenchuk’s Rejuvenating Apples, became a stop-motion director in the vein of Kurchevsky and Serebryakov. Though his work was much more straight-forward, films like Black-and-White Film and Drop Shadow garnered some festival acclaim. Garri Bardin’s stop motion burlesques, made with unorthodox materials like wire and match sticks, have remained popular with audiences. Not every director was a Kurchevsky or a Norstein, but, tellingly, almost every director during this era was an auteur. Few animation studios of its size could claim as much.\n\nCONTACT\n\nMoscow wasn’t the only place in the Soviet Union where animation was practiced. Far from it – nearly every Soviet and Warsaw Pact state had at least one animation studio (Poland had five!). Covering every single one of them it a task outside the scope of this article. Many of them, like Hungary’s Pannonia and Czechoslovakia’s Brati v Triku, are too far removed from Russian influence and others, like Estonia’s Tallinfilm, had some level of cross pollination with Russian animators but later developed into their own, highly unique tradition. Some studios are simply too poorly archived to be effectively researched online. Still, many animators in the region, if not directly influenced by Soyuzmultfilm, were prime examples of their philosophy in action. I want to briefly cover a few of the most notable ones.\n\nThe Belarusian film studio BelarusFilm opened an animation division in the 70s. One of the studio’s founders, Oleg Belousov, was also its best director. Belousov’s moody tone poems like Song of the Bison, Rook Despair, and Cube were born of the same intellectual climate as Soyuzmultfilm at the time. The drawings were often thick and impasto but, by virtue of creative cel layering, could look “transparent” and evanescent just the same. A capital R Romantic, his films had Wagnerian scores written by Sergei Chuprov. His most famous work was A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings, an adaptation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s short story of the same name.\n\nAccording to Giannalberto Bendazzi, Uzbekistan’s UzbekFilm had a mini Renaissance in the 80s, with a number of arthouse-minded directors like Nazim Tulakhojaev, Mavzur Makhmudov, Svetlana Muratkhojaeva, Muzrav Baimukhamedov, Nikolay Smirnov, and Sergei Alibekov. Unfortunately, few of these films are available online. Nazim Tulakhojaev’s adaptation of Ray Bradbury’s There Will Come Soft Rains is probably the single most famous UzbekFilm cartoons, but the film’s art director, Sergei Alibekov, is the studio’s most famous creator. He made a few crypto-nationalist obscurities like Thread and Pause during the studio’s heyday, and he continued directing films, both animated and live action, into the new century including the enigmatic Echogram in 2003.\n\nArmenFilm’s Robert Saakyants was a one man factory, animating, directing, and writing his films with no assistance. You might think this could dilute the quality of his work, but Saakyants animation is among the cleverest and most playful in the entire Soviet bloc. He’s famous for his earthy adaptations of Hovhannes Tumanyan’s fables like Wow, a Talking Fish!, In the blue sea, white foam…, and O Shrovetide!. Though he tried his hand at parody, he was at his best when riffing on a simple theme, like this bitter paean to the collapse of the Soviet Union. In his eulogy to Saakyants, Norstein, a longtime friend, described him as having a “furious sense of humor,” once proclaiming that “History has not proven that the sublimely inspired artists have done more for the world than drunkards, duelists, hooligans, and womanizers.”\n\nLess autarchic was Sverdlovsk Film Studio, the Ural region’s animation studio, which saw many different animators pass through its doors. Alexei Karayev was known for his eccentric Dr. Seuss adaptations, filtering the stories through a lowkey pastoral lens, like Welcome! (based on Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose) and I Can Hear You (based on Horton Hears a Who). Karayev’s films benefitted from the innovative paint-on-glass treatment of Aleksandr Petrov, a young up-and-comer at Sverdlovsk. Vladimir Petkevich, the other senior animator at the studio, made a number of spiritual films with the look of Gothic engravings like The Tree of the Motherland.\n\nEvgeni Sivokin was the first director of note at Ukraine’s KievnachFilm but its main creative force was David Cherkassky. In 1969 Cherkassky exploded onto the scene with Mystery-Bouffe, a subversive take on Mayakovsky’s very subversive play. “A daring project, both in thought and in realization,” (Natalia Venzher) the film was promptly banned everywhere except Ukraine. It was his first collaboration with art director Radna Sakhaltuev, a partnership that would continue throughout both of their careers. Cherkassky and Sakhaltuev fashioned this bizarre hybrid style, where they would mix elaborately replaced paper cutouts, themselves made of disjoint collage material, and occasional flourishes of “total animation” (animation where every frame is completely redrawn, generally meaning background animation). Though Cherkassky made a few shorts like What the hell did you want? and The Wings, his reputation hinges on his trilogy of serials: The Adventures of Captain Vrungel, Dr. Aibolit, and Treasure Island. Cherkassky had a gregarious personality and insisted that his films were pure entertainment without subtext. “For some reason everyone loves me. This is probably a bad thing. They say that if the conductor hates the musicians, and the musicians hate the conductor, that this is excellent. But with me, it’s the opposite.” Cherkassky was widely influential on KievnachFilm’s staff: his disciples like Elena Barinova brought his innovations to Moscow (such as in this ‘total animation’ tribute to Lewis Carroll) and even Evgeni Sivokin’s later films had a bit of that Cherkassky panache in them.\n\nThe relationship between Soyuzmultfilm and the satellite studios wasn’t wholly imperial, but it’s true that the Moscow studio enjoyed a level of prestige and clout far greater than any other communist outfit. It would take a direct competitor from the same region for Soyuzmultfilm to be changed from without.\n\nTHE PILOT BROTHERS\n\nThe Soviets began researching and investing in television during the late 60s, leading to the creation of Studio Ekran. In the 70s, an animation adjunct to Ekran slowly congealed as staff members from Soyuzmultfilm, like Nathan Lerner, Maria Mouat, and Anatoly Solin, transferred over. Multtelefilm, as the studio came to be known, was to be the principle Moscow competitor to Soyuzmultfilm.\n\nBudgets were generally smaller at Multtelefilm with less lead time for production but the creative spirit of their parent studio carried through. Yulian Kalisher made simple childlike fantasies like A Big Secret for a Small Company and Golden Words, often collaborating with poet Yunna Moritz. His protagonists were “dreamers, unsophisticated sages, and philosophers living in a chamber of magical metamorphoses and harmless adventure” (Catherine Vyazova). Vladimir Samsonov made a number of kitschy minute-long shorts via paint-on-glass that took advantage of the new insert/TV advertisement format. Aida Zybrakova mostly focused on child-friendly parables but made a few auteuristic excursions in Tell us a story, Doctor and Pickpocket.\n\nOne of the best directors of this early set was probably Marianna Novogrudskaya. As a student of VGIK, Novogrudskaya was exposed to a wide range of world cinema, and she remembered with particular attention the Italians, Antonioni’s Red Desert, Fellini’s Amarcord, etc. “Bathed in this wave of films, the directing department carried a dangerous virus of megalomania. […] I was among those most acutely ill.” She eventually decided to become an animator after seeing Khrzhanovsky’s Kozyavin. Unsurprisingly, Novogrudskaya made films of a similarly dense, slow-paced nature like Word of Honor and especially Swans, a journey through Tolstoy’s career by way of an obscure short story (Swans) and the ending lines to War and Peace.\n\nBut the most transformative figure at Ekran had never worked at Soyuzmultfilm and was far removed from their culture. Alexander Tatarsky started at Kievnachfilm as a disciple of David Cherkassky, working as an animator on Captain Vrungel. Unlike most Soviet animators who were professional artists that had gone through secondary education, Tatarsky was a performer to the bone. “I admit that until age 17 I dreamed only of the circus.” Boisterous, with no patience for Romantic bromides, Tatarsky was the enfant terrible of the Russian animation community. He even wrote a manifesto that criticized Soyuzmultfilm’s house style and called for cartoons with a faster tempo. He made a startling debut with the claymation short Plasticine Crow, which pureed three celebrated children’s poems into visual gibberish. The censors did not take kindly to Tatarsky’s provocation – it was accused of being “ideologically undisciplined” – but it became a smash hit. Tatarsky followed up on this with Under Yesteryear’s Snowfall, an equally absurd piece of claymation wordplay that was also rejected by the censors, this time for lacking “a positive hero.” Shortly thereafter, Tatarsky switched his attention to 2D and became a fierce advocate for expressive, plastic animation. Rounding out his time at Ekran, Tatarsky directed The Pilot Brothers, the thesis statement for this new cartoon language.\n\nTatarsky may have been suppressed by the authorities but he understood the threat capitalism posed to the Russian animation industry better than anyone. In his manifesto he wrote “Our era demands the creation of an animation studio specializing in the release of feature films for children and adults; here we could easily compete with the Japanese, yet for unexplainable reasons we do not do this. Our era likewise demands the creation of a studio which would create animated films for video tapes – right now we have nothing to counter the foreign and commercialized series of cartoons which are being exchanged today by an already sufficiently large number of videocassette player owners.” In 1988 Tatarsky formed studio Pilot, the first independent animation studio in Russia, in an attempt to realize those goals. According to Bendazzi, “The studio’s strategic plans were ambitious, if only a little vague: to become both an auteur’s heaven and a commercial outlet – or, rather, to remain both in one.” Tatarsky, whose films were loved by audiences but hated by censors, seemed to be the perfect figure to bridge this gap. He set up an internal training devision, producing a legion of capable animators like Mikhail Aldashin, Rinat Gazizov, and Mikhail Tumelya (who had previously worked under Oleg Belousov at BelarusFilm). Tatarsky also launched omnibus series in the vein of Merry Carousel to encourage new directors. As a result, Pilot produced the most daring Soviet animation in the 90s, like Vladimir Fessenko’s I Go Seek and Andrei Svislotsky’s Hypnerotomachia. Faint echoes of the “Tatarsky style” can even be found in Soyuzmultfilm’s films during this time, such as From 9:00 to 18:00 (1987), Growth Vitamin (1988), and Journey (1989).\n\nTatarsky doesn’t deserve sole credit for Pilot. Igor Kovalyov, Tatarsky’s longtime friend and collaborator, was just as essential. Kovalyov was a native Ukrainian and a Kievnachfilm expat, and served as art director and co-director on most of Tatarsky’s Ekran films. During their early years Tatarsky and Kovalyov spent so much time together they were nicknamed “the Siamese twins”, but as artists they differed fundamentally. Kovalyov lacked Tatarsky’s intuition for the broadly comic, just as Tatarsky lacked Kovalyov’s love of arthouse cinema. Though sharing a surface grunge, Kovalyov’s trilogy of Bressonian riddles – Hen, His Wife, Andrei Svislotsky, and Bird on a Window – were intensely cerebral and totally unlike Tatarsky’s own films. Critics at the time called them “surrealist” but Kovalyov emphatically objected. “I never thought that I was surrealistic artist. Not at all. I can tell you all about my ideas, my script. I always have [a] very clear, very narrative script.” Kovalyov’s films attracted a high degree of praise and in particular the eye of Gabor Csupo, a former employee of Pannonia who had set up the American animation studio Klasky-Csupo of The Simpsons and Rugrats fame. Csupo had had success in importing Eastern eccentricity into mainstream American cartoons, and he pressured Kovalyov to join him in the states. Kovalyov agreed on the assumption that he’d return to Pilot a few years down the line. Tatarsky warned him: “Nobody, nobody is coming back from the United States.”\n\nI AM WITH YOU AGAIN\n\nThe advent of perestroika meant the USSR dedicated less state funding to optional expenditures like animation, and the studio found itself having to compete in an economy it didn’t understand. Shrinking staff meant increased competition between directors. There was a general deterioration in the quality of the product too, though the worst of it wouldn’t hit until the aughts. There were a few attempts at foreign co-productions, like the feature Underwater Berets, that sucked up time and resources. Larger projects, like Norstein’s Overcoat, would be forever stuck in financial limbo. Soyuzmultfilm also underwent a failed reorganization, which complicated things further. The fecundity of the 70s and 80s couldn’t last, and though the decline was slow, it was irreversible.\n\nIt wasn’t entirely bleak, at least not at first. Ivan Maximov made a number of surreal blackout comedies like 5/4, From Left to Right, Bolero, and The Strings, showing that Soyuzmultfilm could still cultivate new directors. The polymath couple Alexander and Olga Florensky, founders of the Petersburg art collective Mikta, directed an animated film in the vein of Cherkassky’s Mystery-Bouffe called Miktamayer. A wave of new talent also came from Sverdlovsk. Sergei Ainutdinov’s trilogy Amentia, Autism, and Ainudizm presented Foucauldian themes in a coarse style indebted to the Tatarsky school. Valentin Olshvang made The Pink Doll, a minor hit.\n\nPerhaps the best success story is Aleksandr Petrov. A painter in his youth, Petrov had tended to look down on animation until he saw Kurchevsky’s My Green Crocodile. Crocodile made him burst into tears, realizing “that animation wasn’t just for trifles. It can disturb the soul, wound it, and rip it out.” A master of the paint-on-glass method, Petrov made the jump from animator to director with 1989’s The Cow. He followed that up with three more philosophically charged films: The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, The Mermaid, and The Old Man and the Sea, the latter of which won the Oscar for animated short in 1999 (and in turn outshined Natalia Orlova, another pioneer of paint-on-glass in Russia, who had the misfortune of directing a Moby Dick film around the same time). Critics called him a genius, a Tarkovsky in animated form, and he was elevated to the upper echelon of the nation’s animators. Alexander Vasilkov interprets Petrov’s films as a cycle, from childhood (Cow) to maturity (Ridiculous Man), to death (Old Man and the Sea). Petrov’s most recent film, My Love, based on the novel by Ivan Shmelev, had a chillier reception than Petrov’s previous, with Mikhail Tumelya calling it “banal perfection.”\n\nA group of former Soyuzmultfilm artists including Norstein, Khitruk, Khrzhanovsky, and Nazarov, fed up with the studio’s slow disintegration, quit and formed the Shkola Animatsionnoy Rezhissur (aka ShAR) to serve as a new ‘school-studio’, training new directors while providing support for existing ones, just as Soyuzmultfilm previously had. ShAR’s best graduate was Oksana Cherkasova, a Sverdlovsk animator fascinated by the indigenous Chukchi culture. Nurka’s Bath, directed by Cherkasova with some rotoscope by Andrei Zolotuhkin, is often considered one of the best Russian cartoons of the 90s and was highly praised by Yuri Norstein. Mikhail Lisovoi’s film The Major’s Nose is another standout from the studio.\n\nAs Soyuzmultfilm fell into disarray, Pilot, the only production house prepared to deal with the new economy, became the industry’s sturdiest pillar. Tatarsky wanted to direct, not manage, but his studio’s future depended on his sacrifice. Producer Anatoly Prokhorov once remarked that “Tatarsky was the director of a meta-film called ‘Pilot.’ His post-directorial career started there.” Pilot set up the Gem Mountain project, a cycle of short films based on folk tales from various indigenous cultures in the Balto-Slavic region, mainly as a way to keep animators employed. Like Kovalyov before them, Tatarsky’s ‘super team’ spread themselves out over the globe. Despite all this Tatarsky doggedly pursued his dream project, a feature film called The Arrival of a Train. Made entirely in watercolor, the film was described in rapturous terms by those who had the luck to see it. Sadly in 2007 Tatarsky died from cardiac arrest at the age of 57, leaving the film unfinished. The torch of Pilot’s control was passed to Nazarov, who manages the studio today. Pilot is the only real success story of contemporary Russian animation; Konstantin Bronzit, whom Tatarsky described as his best pupil, was recently nominated for an Academy Award. But it’s still a far cry from what Tartarsky had envisioned.\n\nA number of smaller studios like A-Film, Studio MIR, and Studio MeInitsa cropped up around this time, many of them failing to make much of an impact commercially or creatively. Christmas Studio, set up for the purpose of supervising foreign co-productions and featuring Stanislav Sokolov, Valery Ugarov, and Natalia Dabizha among their ranks, had some meager success in contributing to the anthology series Shakespeare – the Animated Tales and Operavox, but not much else. The capitalist economy was an ecosystem where art animation couldn’t defend its existence.\n\nThis is a pessimistic reading. An optimistic one might be that, in those that made the films then and those that watch them now, the spirit of Russian animation proves indomitable. The films themselves survive, even if the circumstances that made them possible do not. In the twilight years of the industry, Andrei Khrzhanovsky directed a short film called The Lion with a Grey Beard. The film stars an aging circus lion with echoes of Khitruk’s Boniface, yet unable to attract crowds as he once could’ve. Romantic delusions of marriage and parenting fill his head, and distract him from performance. The traveling circus starts to run out of money and eventually the ringmaster is forced to set him free. The lion wanders through the forest and, in a nod to Au hasard Balthazar, finds himself in amidst a flock of sheep. He cries, then lies down, and dreams of his youth."
