Dir: Elem Klimov. Screenplay: Semyon Lunghin and Ilya Nusikov. Camera: Leonid Kalashnikov. Music: Alfred Schnitke. Cast: Alexei Petrenko, Anatoly Romashin, Velta Linne, Alice Freindlikh. This looks like an extremely interesting film treatment of Rasputin and the end of the Romanov dynasty. Unfortunately, the copyright deposit is a widescreen film squeezed onto a Betamax half-inch videotape, and is virtually unwatchable. Russian track with English subtitles. AIR CREW USA/PARIS/MOSCOW (1980) VAA 3815-16 (EQIPAG) 1/2\" Videocassette Copyrighted 1982 by Five Star Films. Director: Alexander Mitta. Camera: Valerii Shuvalov. Executive Producer: Boris Krishtul.

Varshan Yeremian. Music: Reinhold Gliere, T. Sadykov. All commentators agree that this is a remarkable film, and is an example of the innovative film making that was done outside of Moscow even at the height of the Stalinist period. Unfortunately, our 16mm print is so worn and shrunken that it is unviewable. A videocassette has been made of the film. Russian track. BALLADA O SOLDATE FGC 7601-05 (BALLAD OF A SOLDIER) 9r, 35mm Mosfilm, 1959. Presented by J. Jay Frankel. Director: Gregory Chukrai. Cast; Vladimir Ivashov, Shanna Prokhorenko, Antonina Maximova, Eugenii Urbanski. At the time it was released in this country, it was wildly overestimated, probably as a result of the Kruschev thaw as much as anything. It is the story of a young soldier on leave from the front during World War II and how he spends his ten days leave. It is a pleasant enough film, but reminds one of a Saturday Evening Post story. Russian track with English subtitles. BOEVYE BUDNI (Military Alarm) (1940) FEB 2786-90 Dir: C. Kyrov and I. Kravchunovsky 5r, 35mm original L of C title: RED ARMY reel 2 missing A film about the military maneuvers of the Red Army in 1940, with shots of the Mannerheim Line in Finland, as well as Timoshenko and his staff. This film was probably made to show the world, as well as Russia's ally at the time, Germany, that Russia was a military power. Russian military prowess was not then highly regarded, partly as a result of the humiliating Russo-Finnish War. Film in fair shape, scratches on picture. Russian track.

Simachev Clive Barnes felt that this film was a good idea that went wrong (New York Times, September 30, 1966). The ballet sequences are filmed with excessive business, and a framing story involving young aspirants to the Corps de Ballet interferes with, rather than expands the film. Our print is in technicolor and is in excellent shape. Russian and English track. BRONENOSETS `POTYOMKIN' VAA 5128 (BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN) 1926 1/2\" Videocassette Goskino, 1926.

Narration written in English by John Wexley,spoken by Brian Donlevy This is an English language version of STALINGRAD. The Russian credits are as follows: STALINGRAD Compiled by the Central Newsreel Studios in Moscow. Edited by Leonid Varlamov for Artkino Pictures. From motion pictures taken by Soviet cameramen on the Don and Stalingrad fronts. Photography: Boris Vakar, A. Kazakov, V. Orliankin, A. Sofin, G. Ostrovsky, A. Krichevsky, D.

Lebedev-Kumach and V. Mokrousov \"One of the war's greatest film achievements....\" Jay Leyda, Kino, p. 375. The film is in excellent shape, and the footage is first rate. The English narration is extremely heavy-handed. DVA BOITSA FEB 2778-85 (TWO SOLDIERS) 9r, 35mm reel 4 missing Taskent Film Studios, 1944. Dir: L. Lukov. Screenplay: Eugene Gabrilovitch. Music: N. Bogoslavsky. Cast: Mark Bernes, Boris Andreyev,Vera Shershneva, Yannina Zheimo, Maxim Straukh, I. Kuznetsov, S. Krilov, Peter Matsokha. Story about two soldiers during the siege of Leningrad. It is a pretty routine film, somewhat enlivened by Bernes' singing of \"Dark Nights,\" \"Song of Odessa,\" and \"Song of Leningrad.\" Some good stock footage of Leningrad in October, 1941. With the exception of the missing reel 4, the print seems fine.

Artkino release in U.S. Dir: Victor Eisimont, Cast: Alexander Abrikosov, Boris Blinov, Oleg Zhakov, Zoya Fydorova, Yuri Tolubeyev, English subtitles, Russian track. Deals a group of nurses in the Russo-Finnish war. the plot is banal, but the film works because both the director and the actors tried to portray the hardships of the war as realistically as possible. Jay Leyda wrote in Kino,\"[Eisimont] was given the delicate job of making the first studio film about the war with Finland.\" Delicate indeed. At least in the Artkino version, Eisimont handles the subject by never naming the enemy or discussing what the war is all about. The picture was a smash hit in the Soviet Union. Our print is scratched, and there seems to be some missing material in reel 9. Russian track with English subtitles. IASTREBINOE GNEZDO VBF 0405 (US release title: THE CLOVEN TONGUE) 3/4\" Videocassette (English translation: THE HAWK'S NEST) 2r of 5 (r1 and 4) (Previous cataloging states possible transliterated title: TROJKA MCITSJA, TROJKA SKACET) Russian Art Film Corporation, 1916. Dist in U.S. by Pathe Exchange, Inc., 1918. Dir: Eugene Bauer. Based on a story by A.M. Pushkin. Cast: Nadya Lesienka, P.A. Baksheef, N.V. Panov, Sophie Karabana. The Library of Congress unfortunately only has 2 reels of 5, reels one and four. \"The story opens with the return of Sonia Orloff to her father's estate after several years of school. Orloff, one of the petty gentry and a man of reduced circumstances, deals in horses. In this work, he is assisted by an employee named Stephan. Orloff also has in his employ a housekeeper known as Glasha Antonova, a Circassian woman of great physical charm, but a deceitful nature. \"Glasha has a great love for running things in her own way and at once conceives a dislike for Sonia. She has a hold upon the girl's father. When a neighbor, Prince Alexis, falls in love with Sonia, the housekeeper immediately stirs up trouble. She goes so far as to denounce the prince as having made love to herself. Stephan, in love with Glasha, offers to kill the prince, but later Glasha herself is killed. Stephan then accuses the prince, and circumstances are very much against him. But it develop that Glasha was killed by some peasant women whose hatred she had won, and the love story between the prince and Sonia goes on to a happy conclusion.\" Moving Picture World, vol. 35, January 19, 1918, p. 378.

Soloven, A. Sologubov, M. Troyanovsky. This film was presented by the Chief prosecutor of the USSR to document the chief accusations of the Soviet Union against the Germans in the Nuremberg Trials [Ocherkii Istorii Sovetskogo Kino, (Moscow: Academy of Science USSR, 1959) Vol. 2., p. 599]. There are photographs at the beginning of the film of signed affidavits of all Soviet cameramen involved as well as the director stating that none of this material was faked or retouched. It is a compilation of footage showing the atrocities committed by the Germans in Russia, as well as at Maidenek and Auschwitz. English track. KUTUZOV FEB 0327 1r, 35mm Mosfilm, 1944. Dir: Vladimir Petrov. Scen.: Vsevolod Solovyov. Phot: Mikhail Gindin. Design: Vladimir Yegorov. Music: Yuri Shaporin. Cast: Alexei Diki, Nikolai Okhlopov, S. Zakariadze, Sergei Mezhinsky. This sounds like an interesting film on the war of 1812. According to Jay Leyda, the director arranged to shoot the batle of Borodino on the 131st anniversary of the actual battle, in August 1943. Unfortunately, we only have the last reel of the film. Russian track with a small amount of English narration.

Georgian track MOSCOW STRIKES BACK (1942) FBA 3513-14 2r, 16mm This is the American version of RAZGROM NEMETSKIKH VOISK POD MOSKVOI (Defeat of the German Armies near Moscow) American Credits: Narrator: Edward G. Robinson, English commentary by Albert Maltz, Editing and montage by Slavko Vorkapich, Music, Dmitri Tiomkin, Sound, Hayes Page, Chief of Production, Nicholas Napoli. Russian credits: Dir: Leonid Varlamov, Ilya Kopalin; Camera: Fyodor Bunimovich, G. Bobrov, P. Kasatin, A. Krylov, A.Lebedev, M. Schneiderov, Alexander Elbert, Roman Karmen, V. Soloviev, Boris Sher, I. Belyakov, Victor Statland, Boris Makaseyev, Maria Sukhova, v. Frolenko, I. Sokolnikov, Vladimir Yeshurin. The Library of Congress has a very bad print, made on 16mm film from nitrate negative which has since been (unfortunately) discarded. The footage is first rate, but the American version also suffers from the stupid and fulsome script written by Albert Maltz. MOSCOW STRIKES BACK won an academy award in 1942 however, and Jay Leyda wrote that the American version was \"...one of the most powerful propaganda weapons in an alliance that began the day after the Moscow battle, when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour\"(Kino, pp. 370-71). English track. OBYKNOVENNYI FASHIZM, Parts I and II FEA 4975-4995 (ORDINARY FASCISM) 14r, 35mm Mosfilm, 1964. Script: Mikhail Romm, M. Turovskaia, Iu. Khaniutin. Director: Mikhail Romm, Music: E. Khachaturian, Dialogues: A. Karamanov. A tremendously hard-hitting compilation film on the rise of Fascism in Germany and its effects both in Germany and on the world, intercut with shots of Muscovites in 1964 going on with their normal lives. The film is also interesting because it shows the range of materials available in Soviet archives. Romm spent over two years in over twenty different archives in the countries in the Soviet sphere, and much of his footage is unknown to western audiences. The film contains some striking footage of Socialist and Communist marches in pre-Hitler Germany, as well as London, Paris and New York in the twenties and thirties. It has one shot of Heinrich Himmler kissing Alfred Krupp on the cheek that must bring joy to any doctrinaire Marxist. it should be pointed out that Jay Leyda criticized Romm for using newsreel footge out of context (Films beget Films, p. 130, 132). The similarity between the Marine Corps and the Waffen SS is also not overlooked, although Romm is, as is usual in these compilation films, reticent about the Hitler-Stalin pact. Russian track. OCTOBER (1928) VAA 8848 (aka TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD 1/2\" Videocassette Goskino, 1928. Dir and Scen: Sergei Eisenstein, Grigori Alexandrov.

Des.; Vasili Kovrogin: Music (for performance abroad): Edmund Meisel. Cast: Nikandrov (Lenin), N. Popov (Kerensky). Unfortunately, we have only a 1/2\" videocassette, with an organ score by Rosa Rio. Her sen sitivity to the subject matter can be measured by her use of the old Csarist Russian anthem to accompany shots of Lenin. The God sequence is also missing, as it usually is in the American release of the film. English intertitles OTETS SERGII (1918) VAA 7168 (FATHER SERGIUS) 1/2\" Videocassette Dir: Jakov Protazanov.

Dzeneyeva, Vladimir Gaidarov, Natalia Lisenko, Vera Orlova, Pyotr Baksheyev, Nikolai Panov. \"It may not have the epic quality of Griffith's war-time work, but it is easily comparable to Sjostrom's famous Berg-Ejvind, produced that year, in intensity and character revelation.\" Jay Leyda, Kino, p. 108. Unfortunalely, we only have a half-inch videocassette of bad material. English intertitles. PADENIYE BERLINA FCA 7311 (THE FALL OF BERLIN) 1r, 16mm exerpts Parts One, Two, Mosfilm, 1949. Dir: Mikhail Chiaureli. Story; Pyotr Pavlenko, Chiaureli. Oolor photography: Leonid Kosmatov. Design: Vladimir Kaplunovsky, A. Parkhomenko. Music: Dmitri Shostakovich. Cast: Mikhail Gelovani, Boris Andreyev, Oleg Froelich, Victor Stanitsin, V. Savelyov This film was made during the height of the apotheosis of Stalin. We see a totally omniscient and omnipotent Stalin who wins World War II in spite of his allies who, either on purpose or through bungling, do all they can to help Hitler. He also invites steel workers to lunch and plants trees in his spare time. This must be a fairly embarrassing film for Russians now. Unfortunately, we have only excerpts on a worn black and white 16mm copy. Russian track with English subtitles. PAREI' IZ NACHEGO GORODA (1943) FEB 6129-30 (A LAD FROM OUR TOWN) r-1&8, 35mm Central Art Film Studios of Alma Ata, 1943. Dir: Alexander Stolper and Boris Ivanov. Producer: Frederick Ermler. Scenario: Konstantin Simonov. Cast: Nikolai Kriuchkov, Anna Smirnova, Nokolai Mordvinov, V. Stepanov, V. Medvedyev, A. Alekseyev, P. Liubeshkin. Unfortunately, we only have the first and last reels. It is about a Soviet tank officer who fights first in Spain, then in Russia. Bosley Crowther felt that it was pretty bad, but reported that the film contained the wonderful subtitle, \"An Omsk Tank School graduate doesn't take the easy way!\" Russian track. Credits in English. PASO A LA JUSTICIA! FAA 6548-54 7r, 16mm (Original Russian Title: SUD IDYET (The Court is in Session) Special Production of Cine Chronica, Moscow, 1943. Originally produced by Central Studios, Moscow. Dir: I Kopalin. Camera: A. Lebedev, A. Lapti'i, B. Frolenko. Sound: V. Petrov. This film is a Spanish language version of SUD IDYET. The film covers the trial of three Germans, Wilhelm Langheld, Hans Ritz, Reinhard Retzlaw, and one Russian, Mikhail Bulanov, for the atrocities carried out by the Germans in the city of Kharkov. The trial took place between December 12 and 15, 1943. For a shortened version of the same film, see KHARKOV WAR TRIAL, infra. Spanish track with some German and Russian testimony. POTSELUI MERI PICKFORD FGD 9355-57 (A KISS FROM MARY PICKFORD) 6r, 35mm Mezhrapom-Rus, Soviet Union. 1927. Prod Credits: S. Kozlovskii, D. Kolupaiev, Sergei Komarov. Original idea: Anatoli Lunacharsky. Cast: Ihor Illins'kyi, A. Sudakevych, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Ie Rozenstein, N. Syzova. SUMMARY: A moving-picture usher is in love with a hopeful cinema actress, who has a violent crush on Douglas Fairbanks, and who ignores him. He decides to break into films to get her attention. While at the studio, he happens to meet Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, who are in Russia and making a studio tour. Pickford gives him a peck on the cheek, which makes him a huge celebrity. His Russian girl friend becomes jealous, and falls for him after all. The film was a gift from Pickford, and the print, which is in excellent shape, was given to her by Gosfilmofond. It is especially interesting because it incorporates footage from the Pickford-Fairbanks tour of the Soviet Union during the summer of 1926. While owing more to Harold Lloyd than Eisenstein, it does use montage effectively to incorporate Pickford and Fairbanks into a fictitious story. It is also quite funny, even to a non-Russian speaker. It is a film that was totally unknown here, and is a definite asset to the collection. Ukrainian intertitles. PRIVIDENIE, KOTOROE NE VOZVRASHCHAETSIA FDA 1287-88 (THE GHOST THAT WILL NEVER RETURN) 2r, 16mm Sovkino, 1930. Dir: Abram Room. Scen. (from a story by Barbusse) Valentin Turkin. Phot. Dmitri Feldman. Des. Victor Aden. Cast: B. Ferdinandov, Olga Zhizneya, Maxim Strauch. \"...The literary base was a story by Henri Barbusse, The Ghost That Will Not Return, about a political prisoner somewhere in a Latin American oil country. The grotesque prison authorities grant Jose Real the day of freedom with his family that is legally due him; no paroled prisoner has returned alive to the prison, for a police agent is ordered to follow and shoot at the end of twenty-four hours. The authorities trick Real into accepting their offer, and the agent that follows him lets him squander precious hours needlessly. Real finally reaches his family, but instead of returning to prison, or being shot, he leads an armed revolt, presumably against the oil companies, with consequences so ambiguous as to leave his future unclear--at least in my mind.\" (Jay Leyda, Kino, p. 256). The films shows a very interesting avant-garde tendency, and the concept of the gourmandising, flower loving secret policeman is marvelous. Unfortunately, we have only a 16mm print with English intertitles. Credits missing. PYOTR PERVYI Part 1 FGE 4813-17 (PETER THE FIRST PART I) 10r of ? on 5r Lenfilm, 1937. Director: Vladimir Petrov.

Cast: Nikolai Simonov, Alla Tarasova, Nikolai Cherkasov, Mikhail Zharov, Mikhail Tarkhanov, I. Zarubina. Jay Leyda did not like these films much, and found their style overly grandiose and theatrical, but they are important historically. There is an obvious analogy between Peter's dragging Russia into the 18th century and Stalin's attempts to make Russia a modern industrial nation in the thirties. The style and content of the film both represent the increasing conservatism of the film industry. In both parts, the frame jumps in our prints quite a bit, and some scenes appear to have been cut. Russian track. RADUGA FEA 4834, FEB 3411-19 (RAINBOW) 11r, 35mm (missing r9) Kiev and Ashkabad Studios,1944. Director: Mark Donskoy. Scenario: Wanda Wasilewska fron her novel. Photography: Bentsion Monastirsky. Design: V. Khmelyova. Music: Lev Schwartz. Cast: Natalia Uzhvi, Yelena Tyapkina, A. Dunaisky, Hans Klering. A grim and no doubt realistic depiction of the Nazi occupation of a small Russian village in the Ukraine. \"The Rainbow, Wanda Wasilewska's adaptation of her novel about occupied Ukraine, directed with all the anger that Donskoy was capable of expressing--an anger that was missing from his first war film. Donskoy's enemy portraits were more subtle and more powerful than in previous fictional films, possibly because he took the trouble to interview and study a number of German prisoners, both officers and soldiers. Hans Klering, who plays the German garrison commander, gives as credible a performance as the group of fine actresses: Natalia Uzhvy, Nina Alisova, Yelena Tyapkina.\" (Jay Leyda, Kino, p. 379). James Agee, however, felt that it was a dangerous piece of agit-prop (Agee on Film, pp. 123-26). The film received the Stalin Prize for 1944. Although we are missing reel 9, the film still belongs on the A list. The print is, except for reel 9, in good shape. Russian track.

Cast: Borya Barkhatov, Sergei Bondarchuk, Irina Skobtseva, Natasha Chechotkina, Lesha Lotsenko, Seryozha Metelsin, L. Sokolova, Vasili Merkuryev. This is a story of a five-year old boy whose mother is a widow who decides to remarry. Seryozha likes his stepfather, who is the mamager of a collective farm, very much, but then finds out that his family has to move, and can not take him. However, at the last moment, his stepfather can not bear to leave him behind. The story is not much, and I am not very susceptible to cute children in movies, so I was prepared not to like this film, but I have to admit that I agree with Bosley Crowther: \"This may sound pat and sentimental, and it might be if it weren't so nicely done, so pleasantly brightened with humor, so sparked with a witty musical score and so warmly played by everybody....\" The directors got a wonderful performance out of Borya Barkhatov, and Bondarchuk is good as the bearlike, soft-hearted stepfather. Russian track with English subtitles. SHANGHAISKY DOKUMENT FGE 8354-8356 (A SHANGHAI DOCUMENT) 6r, 35mm Soyuzkino, 1928. Dir.: Yakov Blyokh. Photography: V. Stepanov. Exchange with Gosfilmofond, 1989. SHESTAIA CHAST' MIRA FEB 4912-18 (SIXTH PART OF THE EARTH) 7r, 35mm Kul'tkino. 1926. dir.: Dziga Vertov, Ass't Dir.: Elizaveta Svilova. Cameraman: Mikhail Kaufman. Photo; Ivan Beliakov, Samuel Benderskii, Nikolai Konstantinov, Aleksandr Lemberg, Nikolai Strukov, Iakov Tolchan, Petr Zotov. Music: Berezovskii. The film was a gift from Gosfilmofond, and one of the most famous documentary films from the experimental phase of Soviet filmmking before the Stalinist freeze. Not only is it a documentary film about Russia, but it also tries to educate the viewer into how the whole Soviet system works economically. One famous example of the interest of Vertov and other early Soviet film makers in linguistic experiments with film through montage are the shots of the icebreaker Lenin. Not only do the shots show the ice in a harbor being broken up, but they also represent the Soviet system breaking up centuries of decay and ignorance to bring this port, and the rest of Russia into the new age. The Library of Congress print is shorter than the release print, so some material may have been excised by the Russians. Our print is of mixed quality, with some jumps and splices. Russian intertitles. SVINARKA I PASTUKH (1941) FEA 4630, FEB 6164-73 (The Shepherd and the Girl Swineherd) 10r, 35mm American Title: THEY MET IN MOSCOW Dir: Ivan Pyriev, story: Victor Gusev,phot.: Valentin Pqvlov, des.: A. Berger, Mus.: Tikhon Khrennikov.Cast; Marina Ladynina, V. Zeldin, Nikolai Kruchkov. A musical comedy about a lady swineherd and a dashing shepherd from the Caucasus who meet at a trade fair in Moscow. It looked to me rather as if MGM had had made it, but I must be wrong, because Jay Leyda gave it a favorable opinion, and James Agee gave it a rave: \"The songs they sing are excessive, vivid, pretty, uncommercial, and solidly rooted in alphabetic emotions. They are handled and photographed as if real faces and fresh-air landscapes could not but be more pleasing than death masks peopling a vacuum-sealed magniloquence of scarlet linoleum and dry-ice mist....The Russians show us how to make a musical comedy.\" The film also got a good review in Variety and The New York Times, but most Russian films did during the War. Our print is in good shape, except for a few splices and some muffled sound. Russian track. TIKHI DON (1957) Video Viewing Copy Ordered (AND QUIET FLOWS THE DON) Gorky Film Studios.

Cast: Ludmilla Savelyova, Bondarchuk, Vyacheslav Tikhonov, Victor Stanitsin, Oleg Tabakov, Anatoli Ktorov, Anastasia Vertinskaya, Irina Skobtseva, Vasili Lanovoi, Vladislav Strzhelchik. We have received the English language version, and, as Renata Adler points out ( New York Times, April 26, 1968), the version released in the United States was dubbed quite badly into English, and over an hour was cut out of it. The film only arrived in the division on December 9, 1987, so I have not seen it, but we appear to have the dubbed and cut version, unfortunately. Our print also appears to be in very bad shape, and we may reject it. English track. YESLI ZAVTRA VOINA FEA 4268 (If War Comes Tomorrow) 1r of 6 LC has rest on fine grain Mosfilm, 1938. Dirs: E.

Jay Leyda wrote in his diary that in this film, Vladimir Schneiderov treated interesting material uninterestingly. However, the material is even more interesting than it was in 1932, since it shows a Tokyo that has totally disappeared. Schneiderov appears to have used Ruttman's BERLIN as a guide, since the film depicts a day in the life of Tokyo. Musical track with Russian intertitles.

This appears to be the kind of film that would be shown to groups of American tourists in Russia by Intourist, and is very similar to the semi-official films shown to schoolchildren at some of the national monuments in Washington. The film uses many re-enacted clips from Soviet fiction films, as well as actuality footage. The track is in English and Russian. The print is in fine shape.
