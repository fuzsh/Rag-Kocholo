        "text": "Musical comedy. A screen adaptation of the play by the Soviet playwright Alexander Gladkov \"A long time ago\", staged by the real master of Soviet cinema, Eldar Alexandrovich Ryazanov. The picture was being prepared for the 150th anniversary of the Patriotic War of 1812, and we can say that they did an excellent job with the task. I watched it for the first time a long time ago, but now I decided to share my impressions, since I touched on 1812, so to speak. And here's my brief opinion - Love and service of a cavalry girl. There is nothing to say about the minuses, because they are not here. Although there is a small remark, which I will talk about in a separate paragraph, for now, allow your humble servant to focus your attention on the expressive advantages of this masterpiece by Eldar Ryazanov.\n\nSo, here they are: 1. Scenario - they took as a basis the true story of the cavalry girl Nadezhda Andreevna Durova - the heroine of the war of 1806-1807, the Patriotic war of 1812 and the Foreign campaign of the Russian army of 1813-1815. The young girl Shurochka Azarova, having learned about Napoleon's invasion of Russia, is eager to serve, because the officer's uniform is available. With the help of a faithful servant, she manages to get into the active army and contribute to the defeat of Napoleon and his Great Army. Along the way, the love of Shura and Lieutenant Rzhevsky, a dashing and brave hussar (who in the future will become a folklore character and the hero of numerous anecdotes), is revealed. Courage, danger, fights and chases, balls and battles - everything is here and it looks cheerful even now. The finale is naturally predictable, but this does not prevent you from revising this picture again and again. Moreover, there is a heroic poem in verse, and the actors memorized their lines.\n\n2. Romance - hussar daring and arrogance of Rzhevsky against the pure maiden love of Shurochka Azarova. And how she re-educates the lieutenant! You just have to see it and enjoy it. Pure romance that looks appropriate. Of course now it looks a little naive, but I don't care, because in this case it works. Plus, the duet of Larisa Golubkina and Yuri Yakovlev played an important role.\n\n3. Humor - do not count on wild laughter, but this picture will give you a portion of excellent mood. Basically, all the funny moments are built around the relationship between Shurochka and Rzhevsky, and everything else is also worthy of attention.\n\n4. Songs - \"Once upon a time\", French song and others look great and listen to. Not a hint of vulgarity or even vulgarity. The patriotism of the Russians, the arrogance of the French, the fight of the strongest, a testament to future generations - these themes are perfectly represented in the songs. By the way, the author of the play Alexander Gladkoy and the composer Tikhon Khrennikov were responsible for the music and songs. And their joint work gave such a high-quality result.\n\n5. Costumes and decorations - nature plus \"Mosfilm\" has allocated a number of costumes intended for \"War and Peace\" by Bondarchuk. Therefore, the immersion in the era was almost completely successful. The nature and the manor house are pleasing to the eye with furnishings.\n\n1. Shurochka Azarova / Cornet Azarov performed by Larisa Golubkina is a young girl who dreams of running away from home and serving Russia after the invasion of Napoleon's army. Using his courage and mind, he becomes a war hero. For young Larisa Golubkina, this picture became a debut, and very deafening. After which she woke up famous throughout the Soviet Union. And the role she was superbly successful. Bravo!\n\n2. Lieutenant Rzhevsky performed by Yuri Yakovlev is a dashing hussar, a favorite of women and a war hero, who fell in love with Azarov's cornet as a devoted friend without guessing about his secret. It should be said that Yuri Yakovlev perfectly suited the role of the lieutenant. Which personifies at the same time the best and worst features of a hussar officer. Bravo!\n\n3. Prince Kutuzov performed by Igor Ilyinsky - plays here a secondary and more comedic role, but is still remembered. And although the real Kutuzov did not wear an armband, it is still better than Kutuzov in the American film adaptation of War and Peace in 1956. Igor Ilyinsky is very similar to the prince and looked convincing in the role of such a legendary person. Bravo!\n\nNow about the remark. Well, I don't believe that in so much time Shurochka's deception has not been revealed, and Rzhevsky, along with the others, seemed to have gone blind. After all, it is quite simple to distinguish a man from a woman, but here Shurochka only has a slightly rude voice, well, and behaves quite unbridled. And so there is nothing more to complain about. But after all, this is an artistic picture, even a comedy, and not a documentary film, so it is forgiven. Moreover, not so many art pictures were shot on the theme of the Patriotic War of 1812.\n\nAs a result, we have an excellent musical comedy about a cavalry girl, with an excellent script, good humor, great songs, and great acting!\n\nMy rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!\n\n6. Fights, fights and duels - of course, combined filming, of course, without a single drop of blood, but this is the beginning of the sixties, so we will make a discount on the release time. Spectacularity is still present, especially in fights. Excitement, daring, a sense of constant danger - all this was conveyed, and for this I thank the creators of the picture.\n\nA little about the main characters:"
