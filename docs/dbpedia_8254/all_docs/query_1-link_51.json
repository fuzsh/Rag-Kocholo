        "text": "A new exhibition, A Play on Colors, opens Nov. 2 at the David McCune International Art Gallery in the Bethune Center for Visual Arts at Methodist University. The show features handmade felt by Sharron Parker.\n\nParker received an undergraduate degree from Duke University and a master’s de-gree from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. She studied education, art and interior design. Parker continued her study in textiles with classes at Penland School of Crafts, where she has returned to teach workshops in feltmaking. Her work has been exhibited throughout the U.S., and under the Art in Embassies Program, has recently been exhibited in Turkmenistan and Armenia.\n\nParker began making felt in 1980. She was inspired by 2,500-year-old felts that were found at an archeological dig in Siberia. Her work is primarily focused on color and texture using a tech-nique developed by the artist.\n\nIn nomadic cultures felt is still used today for making things like tents, rugs and even clothes. It is also used in different industries in first world countries. Piano hammers, and timpani mallets use felt in the construction; it is used as a damper to decrease noise vibrations in between the interior of some car panels; hats including fedoras and homburgs are also made of felt. A workshop with the artist will take place Nov. 17 from 10:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. For information on fees and registration, contact Executive Director Silvana M. Foti at 910.GALLERY or 910.425.5379. Registration for the workshop is limited to 12 participants.\n\nMethodist University is an independent, four-year institution of higher education with more than 2,400 students from 41 states and 53 countries. Methodist University offers more than 80 majors and concentrations, 100 clubs and organizations, four master’s degree programs and 19 NCAA III intercollegiate sports. For more information, please visit www.davidmccune-gallery.org or www.methodist.edu.\n\nThere will be an opening reception from 6 to 8 p.m. at the gallery Nov. 2, which is free and open to the public. Afterward, the exhibit will run through Dec. 12 during regular gallery hours. This semester, the gallery is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday-Friday, noon to 4 p.m. on Saturday, and by ap-pointment. There is no cost to visit the gallery."
