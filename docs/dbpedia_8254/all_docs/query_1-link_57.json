Colleges and universities are searching for new models of communicating information whereby instructors are facilitators and students are active participants in the learning process. Students retain more with student-oriented approaches than with the traditional model of instructor as lecturer and student as listener. New models of learning necessitate new classroom materials. Human Geography in Action is a response to the need for innovative alternatives to the standard human geography textbook. As its name implies, the purpose of Human Geography in Action is that students learn geography by doing geography. Human Geography in Action comprises 14 stimulating, hands-on chapters that challenge students to collect, manipulate, display, and interpret geographic information. Each freestanding activity provides practical experience with a basic concept in human geography, including scale, region, diffusion, spatial interaction, age-sex pyramids, economic specialization, development, agriculture, urban hierarchy, neighborhood characteristics, urban sprawl, segregation, nations and states, and environmental change. We have chosen activities that demonstrate the kinds of questions that geographers ask and the myriad ways they go about answering them. Our goal is to help students develop the geographic perspective and problem-solving skills that will prove valuable to them in the long run—in their other courses, in their careers, and for lifelong learning. The idea of doing geography rather than reading about it makes Human Geography in Action an alternative to the strictly lecture-oriented course and its accompanying “reading-centered” textbook. Another key difference between the standard human geography text and Human Geography in Action is our focus on essential concepts rather than the never-ending cavalcade of facts in the typical introductory text—we emphasize depth rather than breadth. Using the standard course syllabus in human geography as a framework for Human Geography in Action, we focus on the basics—five to ten of the most important ideas in each chapter—keeping the theoretical material useful but brief and keeping Human Geography in Action true to our goal of offering an active learning curriculum. Human Geography in Action is a complete program for teaching and learning human geography. Yet it is perfectly understandable that some instructors—given their busy schedules, varying levels of resources, and individual preferences—might want to change their human geography curriculum incrementally by sprinkling their current courses and complementing their current texts with some or all of these activities. Not only is each chapter freestanding, but in many of the chapters, individual activities can be assigned independently. Thus, while Human Geography in Action is a cohesive instructional program, it has also been designed with flexibility in mind.\n\n© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nfpref.indd ix\n\nix\n\n30/11/12 10:11 AM\n\nx c Preface for the Instructor\n\nc HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES Eleven of the 14 chapters in Human Geography in Action present computerized activities for your students to do. Nine of the chapters have activities that do not require a computer. Of course, this means that some chapters offer both computerized and noncomputerized activities. This mix is fitting because while technology has profoundly influenced what geographers do and how they do it, many aspects of geography today are practiced without the aid of computers. For students who still think of geography as a dusty old pursuit, the computerized projects will be real eye-openers. Even computer whizzes will find them colorful, animated, and interactive. But the computerized activities are much more than high-tech “window dressing.” They enable students to do analyses that they could not possibly do—or could do only very tediously—without computers. Chapter 1 (mapping the distribution of African-Americans in the United States) and Chapter 2 (defining the Middle East and American Southwest culture regions) demonstrate the power of geographic information systems (GIS) to change scales and map types and to layer information. Chapter 3 (tracking the AIDS epidemic) uses the computer to animate change over time. In Chapters 4 (modeling interstate migration flows) and 12 (analyzing segregation in Northern Ireland), students compute formulas and effortlessly link spreadsheets, maps, and graphs. In Chapter 5 (working with age-sex pyramids) and Chapter 9 (defining the market areas for baseball teams), students engage in “what-if” simulations. Chapter 8 (agriculture) makes extensive use of photographs for landscape recognition and introduces remote sensing for measuring land-use change. Chapter 10 (urban geography) includes a virtual field trip through Colorado Springs, and Chapter 11 (urban sprawl) animates 60 years of urban growth and uses GIS layering to explore the effects of different scenarios for future urban growth. Finally, in Chapter 14 students build a dynamic flowchart to analyze environmental problems within a systems-theory framework. Professional geographers gather and process information about the world from a variety of sources. Human Geography in Action introduces students to some of these methods of collection and analysis, using both online and noncomputerized sources. There is, for example, an extremely rich tradition of field observation and analysis in geography that we tap into in Chapter 10 on reading the urban landscape. This chapter also introduces students to the wide variety of data available from the U.S. Census Bureau at their American Factfinder Web site and from Statistics Canada at its Web site, and teaches students valuable skills for accessing those data. Also important for geographers is the ability to adjudicate the perspectives of different stakeholders in the decision-making process and the ability to speak in public. These skills are honed in role-playing debates in Chapters 11 and 14. Students interpret newspaper, magazine, and Internet articles in Chapter 13 on the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the conflict in Iraq. They also collect data on regional imagery by using local postcards in Chapter 2, on imported foods by visiting local food stores in Chapter 8, and on the population and number of pizza restaurants in a town by using Internet telephone directories and Census data in Chapter 9. Finally, students gain numeracy skills as they calculate regional multipliers in Chapter 6, development indices in Chapter 7, and impacts on global climate change in Chapter 14. Students are introduced to the concepts of outliers and extreme values in Chapter 4, rank-order in Chapter 7, and log-log graphs in Chapter 9. Students can do the noncomputerized activities at home or in class using only the hard copy of the book. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nfpref.indd x\n\n30/11/12 10:11 AM\n\nPreface for the Instructor b xi\n\nSix of the projects can be customized to your city or state. Chapters 4 (migration) and 6 (economy) come with data for every U.S. state and Canadian province. Activity 2 of Chapter 2 (culture regions) asks students to identify culture traits for their own region. Local phone directories are data sources for Activity 1 of Chapter 9 (urban hierarchy). Chapter 10 (urban landscape) compares local census data to field observations. For the role-playing debate in Chapter 14, instructors can substitute an article about a local environmental issue for the ones we provide.\n\nc FLEXIBLE TEXTBOOK AND SOFTWARE OPTIONS Human Geography in Action and the associated computerized activities can be ordered and used in a variety of formats. There is, of course, the paperback book, which features perforated pages that students can tear out and hand in. There is also an online e-book with color photos and graphics available under the WileyPlus platform (see the next section for details). Finally, instructors can order custombound editions that contain only the materials they require. For the digital activities, instructors can choose one of two options. The first option is for students to run the activities from the free online Student Companion Site. Students will explore the animations online and then answer the questions on the book’s tear-out pages. There is also an associated Instructor Companion Site with answers, suggested teaching strategies, and further quiz questions. To receive access to the Instructor Companion Site, request a password from your Wiley sales representative (who can be identified at www.wiley.com/college/rep). The second option is for students to access the computerized animations via the WileyPlus platform. Students using WileyPlus submit their assignments electronically (see the next section). Some instructors may want to combine the paperback book with the WileyPlus interface. Some students prefer having a traditional book to read, and instructors may want students to bring the physical book with them for doing noncomputerized activities during class. And yet it may be advantageous to combine those features with WileyPlus for its automated grading, expanded question sets, and other resources. In order for instructors to choose what’s best for their class, we need to introduce you to WileyPlus.\n\nc WILEYPLUS WileyPlus is a course management and online learning package from John Wiley & Sons. It marks the biggest change to Human Geography in Action since it was first published in 1998. We have been developing the WileyPlus interface and testing it on our students at Arizona State University and University of Colorado at Colorado Springs since 2007. The Human Geography in Action WileyPlus interface seamlessly integrates an online version of the textbook with the interactive activities for which our book is known, plus automated grading of many questions and grades that flow automatically into a grade book. It has been used successfully in both small and large classes, and it is particularly well suited as a stand-alone platform for online classes. For the student, WileyPlus offers a number of enhanced features—including an affordable price. All the photos and graphics in the book are in color, and there are a number of bonus features such as map quizzes, flash cards, and area and demographic data for countries around the world. The links to related Web pages are © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nfpref.indd xi\n\n30/11/12 10:11 AM\n\nxii c Preface for the Instructor\n\nlive and instantaneous. Most importantly, all of the activities are online, even those that do not feature a computerized animation. All of the questions are answered online and submitted electronically. When answering a question, students can click on links to refer to the Introduction or Case Study readings. Whenever possible, we have converted the questions from the activities into true-false, multiple-choice, matching, text-entry, and numeric-entry questions that are graded automatically. Automated grading can save you hours of time each week, which can enable you to offer more hands-on activities to your students. Another way it benefits students is by providing instant feedback on their interpretation and analysis. The objective questions still require students to analyze and evaluate the animations and data sets. However, not all questions can be turned into good objective questions. In some cases, the answer depends on your state or province. In other cases, an open-ended written question promotes critical thinking. In such cases, we’ve retained the open-ended written questions. Student scores for objective questions flow instantly into a grade book for each student in each class section. The written answers also flow into the grade book, where the instructor or TA can read them and assign a score. When we first began converting Human Geography in Action to WileyPlus, we examined each question in the book and determined if we could—and should— convert it to an objectively graded question. But as we tested the questions on our students and gained experience with the technology, we came to realize that the WileyPlus technology offered more than just convenience. Therefore, in a second round of software development, we took advantage of Wiley Plus’s capabilities by adding some entirely new sequences of questions to some of the activities. Since the instructor does not have to grade the objective questions, it frees us to ask a sequence of pointed questions about the things we always hoped students would see in the animations. For instance, we now ask students an expanded series of questions about: • Particular combinations of layers and what they say about the core/domain/ sphere of the Middle East or the American Southwest in Chapter 2 • Cultural landscapes and regional imagery in Chapter 2 • S-curves of particular metro areas in Chapter 3 • The economic ratios of particular states and particular regions in Chapter 6 • The location of particular countries in the scatterplot of Chapter 7 • Food miles traveled in Chapter 8 • Theoretical definitions of nations, states, ethnonationalism, and irredentism in Chapter 13 All in all, we feel we have a nice mix of objective and open-ended questions. However—and here’s another major attraction of WileyPlus—if you feel differently, you can change it! WileyPlus is flexible. You can create your own questions to add to any assignment. For instance, you could create your own series of questions about migration to your state or employment shares in your province. You can delete questions you don’t like and add those you’ve always wanted to ask. You can replace an objective question with a written one, or vice versa. You can give students from one to five (or even unlimited) attempts at each question, give hints after a missed attempt, set due dates, assign point values, and give individual students extensions. You can set up the assignments so that students lose some percentage of the possible points © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nfpref.indd xii\n\n30/11/12 10:11 AM\n\nPreface for the Instructor b xiii\n\nif they don’t give the correct answer by the nth attempt. You can make announcements or post files for the class, and draw from the instructor resources for discussion questions or PowerPoint files of graphics, and organize and manage class rosters and grades. You can create rosters or allow students to pay and self-enroll online. The test banks and discussion questions from our earlier instructor’s manual are included among the resources for each chapter, and you can use these to create quizzes and tests for your students to take online. These can also be automatically graded and will flow into the grade book. Your investment of time to develop a good course using WileyPlus can be carried over to subsequent semesters and other instructors in your university. WileyPlus does have some limitations, and it is important to acknowledge these to help you choose wisely. First, students are not able to digitally submit any maps and graphs that they manipulate in the WileyPlus environment. You could ask your students to print and hand in hard copies, or submit screen shots via e-mail or digital drop box, but we have restructured the WileyPlus assignments so that students are not required to hand in maps and graphs. Second, there are some limitations to the length and types of new assignment questions you can create. You cannot insert a link to a computerized animation into a new question you create, but you can instruct students in your new questions to go back to a previous question and click on Link to Animation. Third, WileyPlus does not yet have discussion boards or chat rooms for conducting online debates for the role-playing activities in Chapters 11 and 14. The WileyPlus course, however, does include instructions for how we have organized online debates using another platform such as Blackboard®. We can personally vouch that the online instructions work well and that the quality of the comments in online debates can be very good. In fact, some students who might be shy in a live debate may contribute more in an online debate. Despite these minor limitations, WileyPlus revolutionizes the concept of a textbook, integrating technology with education for an efficient and enhanced learning environment. What’s more, WileyPlus and Human Geography in Action are a perfect match in that each can take advantage of the other’s unique capabilities. Please contact your Wiley Representative if you would like a free “test-drive” of WileyPLUS.\n\nc ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK Because of the interconnections among subfields of human geography, there is no single agreed-upon progression of building blocks for sequencing the chapters of a textbook. For the most part, our Table of Contents corresponds to a fairly typical model for a human geography syllabus and textbook, having evolved through the years by those who design and teach the course as a logical progression through a survey of the field. We begin with fundamentals such as mapping, scale, regions, and culture (Chapters 1 and 2). Next we cover two fundamental forms of movement that shape the human world: diffusion and migration (Chapters 3 and 4). After that we survey population, economic, and urban processes and spatial patterns (Chapters 5–12). Finally, we end with two subfields of geography that involve a substantial amount of synthesis: political and environmental geography (Chapters 13 and 14). This order of chapters, however, is by no means the only logical one. An alternative progression could begin with local-scale projects (Chapters 10 and 11), moving to regional/national-scale activities (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9) and finally to international topics (Chapters 2, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 14). Others might prefer to examine world population trends (Chapter 5) in conjunction with development processes © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nfpref.indd xiii\n\n30/11/12 10:11 AM\n\nxiv c Preface for the Instructor\n\n(Chapter 7) near the beginning of the course, before looking at diffusion, migration, and urban-economic geography.\n\nc ORGANIZATION OF THE CHAPTERS Each chapter and activity follows a consistent format and hierarchy. Each chapter has an Introduction that explains the theoretical concepts, then a Case Study that applies these concepts to some real-world situation or place, followed by the activities that analyze the Case Study. The Preface for the Student includes a sample of the actual features and pedagogy that the instructor and student can expect to find and follow in every chapter.\n\nc LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS The activities lend themselves to a wide variety of learning environments. Many of them are suited for either classroom activities or homework. They can be done individually or as small-group collaborative projects. Computer projects can be done in a lab or at home. We designed Human Geography in Action to be especially appropriate for small-group collaboration. In-class, small-group projects generate a great deal of excitement and discussion among students. For some of the projects, it works well to start in class and then have the students finish them at home, once they have gotten the hang of it. The amount of time needed to complete the projects varies according to the number of separate sections, the amount of reading and/or calculations, and the student’s abilities. The range is from 1 to 4 hours per chapter. See the Instructor’s Companion Site for time estimates by chapter and section as well as for ideas about what works best for each assignment. In addition, the WileyPlus platform is ideally suited for an online course.\n\nc GRADING AND OUTCOME ASSESSMENT The issue of grading is of obvious concern to instructors, especially those teaching large sections. Ideally, instructors want students to do a lot of writing, thinking, and calculating, but realistically they have limited time for grading. In the WileyPlus Human Geography in Action course, many but not all open-ended questions in the book’s activities have been converted to objective questions that are graded automatically. WileyPlus instructors can customize the mix of objective and written questions in each assignment to meet their goals and constraints. Instructors not using WileyPlus can adopt numerous strategies. We have had success in grading some activities on a pass-fail basis. Grading time is significantly reduced, but students still feel the need to do these chapters just as diligently as if they were graded because the material is covered in examinations. Also, we deduct for obviously halfhearted efforts. Another strategy for reducing grading workload is to use group grades for group work. Instructors also have the option to assign the readings for a chapter and discuss them in class without requiring students to do all the activities. Finally, the sixth edition includes three computerized activities that are self-correcting even outside of WileyPlus. These include activities on population pyramids (Chapter 5), agricultural landscapes (Chapter 8), and environmental systems (Chapter 14). By “self-correcting,” we mean that the students are coached by the computer toward the correct answers and cannot complete the assignments until they get them right. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nfpref.indd xiv\n\n30/11/12 10:11 AM\n\nPreface for the Instructor b xv\n\nc INSTRUCTOR’S COMPANION SITE The Instructor’s Companion Site (www.wiley.com/college/kuby) offers a range of resources for the instructor.

As its name implies, the purpose of Human Geography in Action is for you to learn geography as you do geography. Fourteen stimulating, hands-on activities challenge you to collect, manipulate, and interpret geographic information, with each activity demonstrating several basic concepts in human geography. In some chapters, you will work with computers using the Human Geography in Action activities on the Internet. In others, you will discover geography in postcards, newspapers, libraries, and the Internet and in your own daily activities and neighborhood. You always will be working with maps, because human geography is the social science that describes and explains where human activities take place. Compared with the traditional textbook, this book aims more for depth than for breadth. Instead of an encyclopedic survey of the entire field of human geography, you will learn to view the world as a geographer. You will ask the spatial questions geographers ask, and you’ll answer them using the methods professional geographers use. Our goal is to help you develop problem-solving skills that will prove valuable to you in the long run—in your other courses, in your career, and, we hope, in your lifelong interest in the world. You will get as much out of this book as you put into it. In this course, you can’t just sit back and passively take notes. To succeed, you will need to think logically about how theoretical concepts apply to real-world case studies. Read the instructions and questions carefully. Don’t rush your answers, and express yourself clearly. After you’ve finished, reread your answers to make sure they actually say what you mean and that they answer the questions. Because maps are a geographer’s most basic tool, you will need to become comfortable with interpreting them. Practice your map-reading skills every chance you have. In some exercises, you will apply math in new ways. Study the formulas, and follow them one step at a time. Math is increasingly important in geography, as it is in other social sciences and in life. Human Geography in Action has been designed with flexibility in mind. Don’t be surprised if your instructor does not assign all 14 chapters or all activities within a chapter. You may complete some in class, in a lab, or as homework. Your instructor may also skip a project entirely but still assign you to read the introductory material. Each chapter follows a standard format, illustrated on the following sample pages. The format introduces core ideas in human geography, which you will then apply to a particular Case Study using research methods employed by geographers solving real-world problems. The Human Geography in Action software runs using your computer’s Web browser software. You will find the interface very familiar and intuitive, but be aware that the performance of browser applications depends on your computer system configuration. Browser applications “ride” on the computer’s operating system, printer drivers, and browser software. It is therefore very important that you carefully read and follow the computer requirements that can be found by clicking on Help on the Web site.

People use geographic space and interact with the environment when they grow crops, build homes, drive cars, do jobs, raise children, practice religions, cast votes, and spend leisure time. Geographers help us understand the evolving character and organization of human life on the Earth’s surface. Geographers subscribe first and foremost to the view that location matters. It is significant that 313 million persons live in the United States. More significant, however, is where these 313 million persons live. Are they urban or rural? Are they spreading out or becoming increasingly concentrated? What kinds of places are attracting people, and what kinds are losing them? These are geographic questions. Similarly, the world is capable of producing plenty of food to feed its current population of 7.0 billion. Relevant questions about world hunger are geographic ones. How are the supply of and demand for food distributed spatially? What environmental, economic, and political factors account for these distributions? How are demand and supply reconciled in the international marketplace for food? Many of the topics that you will find in this workbook are common to other sciences. Geographers have no monopoly on the study of baseball franchises, migration, AIDS, the population explosion, civil war, and air pollution. Geographers bring to the table their unique spatial perspective and interest in human-environmental relations by asking “where?” and “why there?” questions about the same pressing human problems that engage other social and environmental scientists. The “where” question leads to five overarching themes in human geography that run through the various chapters of this book (Table 1.1). The first theme, location, refers not only to the exact coordinates of a point in space but also to where it is relative to other factors. Place, the second theme, involves the human and physical characteristics that uniquely define a place and impart meaning to its inhabitants. The third theme, region, defines areas that are bound together by common characteristics: Similar places and locations form common regions. In the fourth geographical theme, movement of information, goods, and people connect locations and regions © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nc01.indd 1\n\nKey Terms in bold are defined at the end of the chapter and appear in the Glossary on the Internet Student Companion Site.\n\n1\n\n11/29/12 6:40 PM\n\n© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nfpref.indd xxv\n\n30/11/12 10:11 AM\n\nxxvi c Preface for the Student The Case Study begins after the concept-oriented Introduction.\n\nCase Study b 11\n\nc CASE STUDY TRUE MAPS, FALSE IMPRESSIONS\n\nThe goal of each Case Study states what you will accomplish in the activity and what lifelong abilities you will acquire.\n\nThe learning outcomes are specific, measurable skills and knowledge that you gain from this activity.

You will also learn how to represent data with different types of thematic maps—the dot map, the isoline map, the choropleth map, and the proportional symbol map—and see that your choice of map type profoundly influences the resulting spatial pattern. LEARNING OUTCOMES After completing the chapter, you will be able to: • Convert map scale to real-world distances. • Recognize choropleth, proportional symbol, isoline, and dot maps. • Recognize that changing the scale and type of a map changes its message. • Understand the difference between changing scale and changing level of aggregation. • Use GIS to change the class limits on a choropleth map. • Describe the geographic distribution of AfricanAmericans in the United States.

BACKGROUND Africans were first brought to what is now the United States between 1619 and 1808 as slaves to work on tobacco, rice, sugar, and cotton plantations, mostly in the South. Although the practice of bringing slaves into the country was banned beginning on January 1, 1808, some smuggling of slaves continued further into the nineteenth century. Importation was replaced by programs of slave breeding and trade within the South. Although most slaves were concentrated in the South, a small number of slaves escaped to the North and other parts of the country, where they were represented across many walks of life. A free black man living in Baltimore was commissioned by Thomas Jefferson to survey the District of Columbia. Black cowboys, based in Texas, were well known on cattle drives throughout the West. Many people are surprised to learn that African-Americans represented a sizable share of the U.S. population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At the time of the first census in 1790, one of every five residents of the new\n\ncountry was African-American. Concentrations were highest in southern states: 54 percent of South Carolina’s population was African-American, 40 percent of Virginia’s, 37 percent of Georgia’s, 34 percent of North Carolina’s, and 33 percent of Maryland’s. After emancipation in 1863, most African-Americans remained in the South, working as sharecroppers or tenants on white-owned cotton farms, barely getting by. Although there were compelling reasons to leave the South, including crushing poverty, antiblack terrorism, and lack of civil rights, few actually left the region. Many black farmers were illiterate and therefore unaware of economic opportunities in other parts of the country. White landowners, desperate to preserve their favored way of life sustained by cheap black labor, promulgated an economic system that put sharecroppers in a position of permanent indebtedness, making departure illegal. In the late nineteenth century, northern labor unions lobbied against the importation of African-Americans from the South, fearing it would depress their wages. They preferred European immigrants to meet the demand for new industrial workers in America’s burgeoning manufacturing sector. All of that changed after the end of World War I, beginning one of the most dramatic migration streams in U.S. history. At the turn of the twentieth century, 90 percent of the nation’s African-American population lived in the South, mostly in the rural South. By 1970, barely 50 percent lived in the South (Figure 1.7), millions having sought a better life in northern cities. The reasons for leaving were many and complicated. The supply of cheap immigrant labor was cut off by World War I, and recruiters went south, bringing literally trainloads of African-American workers to the steel mills, automobile factories, and meatpacking plants of Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago, and other northern cities (Figure 1.8). Once these connections had been established, thousands of migrants followed and established themselves in predominantly black neighborhoods such as Harlem in northern Manhattan (Figure 1.9) and the South Side of Chicago. The Great Depression of the 1930s and the mechanization of cotton harvesting after 1945 further spurred the African-American exodus from the South. The mechanical cotton picker rendered sharecroppers obsolete by drastically reducing the need for their labor. Early models of the cotton picker reduced the costs of picking cotton from $40 to $5 per bale. Each machine did the work of 50 pickers. As the mainstay for southern African-American employment evaporated, many left the rural South in search of northern jobs. A second wave of black migration headed to California from 1940 to 1970, lured by both industrial and agricultural jobs. The story does not end here, for migration flows between the South and North were reversed after 1970. Fewer AfricanAmericans now left the South, and many more moved from the North to the South. Race riots and deteriorating economic conditions in northern cities served as push factors, and the favorable economic opportunities and improved social conditions of the “New South” attracted migrants from the North.\n\n© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nc01.indd 11\n\n11/29/12 6:40 PM\n\n© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nfpref.indd xxvi\n\n30/11/12 10:11 AM\n\nPreface for the Student b xxvii\n\nActivity 2: Thematic Maps b 21\n\nName: __________________________________ Instructor: __________________________________\n\nTrue Maps, False Impressions: Making, Manipulating, and Interpreting Maps\n\nc ACTIVITY 2: THEMATIC MAPS This activity involves looking at the distribution of African-Americans in the United States (or Aboriginals in Canada) using different types of thematic maps. You will use some of the functions of a geographic information system (GIS) to look at the various maps and choose the most useful ones. A GIS is a software package that makes maps and allows the user to analyze spatial data. A GIS is a powerful tool used by utility companies, city planners, engineers, cartographers, environmental scientists, and many others. You will be using the mapping capabilities of a GIS to interactively change the maps on your computer screen. A. To start your activity, click on the Student Companion Site at www.wiley.com/college/kuby. (For students using Wileyplus, log on to your class Web site, select the Assignment tab, locate and click on this assignment, and follow all instructions.) B. Select this chapter from the drop-down list, and then click on Computerized Chapter Activities. C. Click on Activity 2: Thematic maps (USA) or (Canada), according to your instructor’s directions. D. Students who chose Canada should first read the short background article on the geography of the Aboriginal population in the window that appears. Following the background article, Canadian students will find the computer instructions and questions to answer and hand in for the Canadian case study. You can print these if you like. Proceed with the digital instructions for the Canadian version. E. You will see the first of four types of thematic maps you will use to evaluate the distribution of African-Americans in the United States. In the right margin are the names for all of the maps. The map displayed is County Choropleth, which classifies each county into one of four classes and assigns a pattern as shown in the map legend. Notice that this map shows the percentage of African-Americans per county, not the actual number. Choropleth maps are usually used to show intensity, such as percentages, rather than magnitude, such as total numbers. You will later see maps that show magnitude, such as the total number of AfricanAmericans. If you wish, you can zoom in on portions of the map to get a better view of a smaller area (you would then be looking at a larger-scale map). Simply move the “slider” at the upper right toward the plus sign. To zoom back out, slide it toward the minus sign. The percentage enlargement is shown in the accompanying box. Next to the percentage is a menu for choosing low, medium, or high resolution. You can move the map around on the screen\n\nThe hands-on part of each chapter is divided into different activities.

True Maps, False Impressions: Making, Manipulating, and Interpreting Maps\n\nDefinitions of Key Terms are short, concise summaries of each idea. These Key Terms are also found in the Glossary.\n\nc DEFINITIONS OF KEY TERMS Aggregation The level of detail for dividing a thematic map into geographic units, ranging from a coarse division (e.g., countries) to a fine division (e.g., zip codes).\n\nMovement The flow of people, goods, money, ideas, or materials between locations near or far (the fourth theme of geography).\n\nChoropleth Map A thematic map in which ranked classes of some variable are depicted with shading patterns or colors for predefined zones.\n\nPlace The local human and physical characteristics that uniquely define a place and give it meaning to its inhabitants (the second theme of geography).\n\nDot Map A thematic map in which a dot represents some frequency of the mapped variable.\n\nPrimary Data Information collected directly by the researchers or their equipment without any intermediary. This can include surveys, interviews, observations, or measurements obtained in the field.\n\nGeographic Information Systems A computer hardware and software system that handles geographically referenced data. A GIS uses and produces maps and has the ability to perform many types of spatial analysis. Human-Environmental Interactions The ways in which human society and the natural environment affect each other (the fifth theme of geography). Human Geography The study of the distribution of humans and their activities on the surface of the Earth and of the processes that generate these distributions. Isoline Map A thematic map with lines that connect points of equal value. Legend Explanatory list of symbols in a map. Usually appears in a box in a lower corner. Location The absolute position of something on the surface of the Earth and its relative proximity to other related things (the first theme of geography).\n\nAt the end of each chapter is a list of further readings for students who wish to learn more about the chapter's core ideas, methods, and Case Study. The readings are a mix of books, articles in scientific journals, popular articles, and data sources.\n\nProportional Symbol Map A thematic map in which the size of a symbol varies in proportion to the frequency or intensity of the mapped variable. Reference Maps A general-purpose map that shows recognizable landmarks, roads, and political units. Region An area characterized by similarity or by cohesiveness that sets it apart from other areas (the third theme of geography). Secondary Data Information obtained indirectly from another source that was previously collected, processed, and made available to a larger audience. Simplification Elimination of unimportant detail on maps and retention and possibly exaggeration and distortion of important information, depending on the purpose of the map.\n\nc FURTHER READINGS Allen, James R., and Eugene J.

People use geographic space and interact with the environment when they grow crops, build homes, drive cars, do jobs, raise children, practice religions, cast votes, and spend leisure time. Geographers help us understand the evolving character and organization of human life on the Earth’s surface. Geographers subscribe first and foremost to the view that location matters. It is significant that 313 million persons live in the United States. More significant, however, is where these 313 million persons live. Are they urban or rural? Are they spreading out or becoming increasingly concentrated? What kinds of places are attracting people, and what kinds are losing them? These are geographic questions. Similarly, the world is capable of producing plenty of food to feed its current population of 7.0 billion. Relevant questions about world hunger are geographic ones. How are the supply of and demand for food distributed spatially? What environmental, economic, and political factors account for these distributions? How are demand and supply reconciled in the international marketplace for food? Many of the topics that you will find in this workbook are common to other sciences. Geographers have no monopoly on the study of baseball franchises, migration, AIDS, the population explosion, civil war, and air pollution. Geographers bring to the table their unique spatial perspective and interest in human-environmental relations by asking “where?” and “why there?” questions about the same pressing human problems that engage other social and environmental scientists. The “where” question leads to five overarching themes in human geography that run through the various chapters of this book (Table 1.1). The first theme, location, refers not only to the exact coordinates of a point in space but also to where it is relative to other factors. Place, the second theme, involves the human and physical characteristics that uniquely define a place and impart meaning to its inhabitants. The third theme, region, defines areas that are bound together by common characteristics: Similar places and locations form common regions. In the fourth geographical theme, movement of information, goods, and people connect locations and regions © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nc01.indd 1\n\n1\n\n05/12/12 5:01 PM\n\n2 c Chapter 1.

The final theme is human-environmental interactions. Humans and their environment interact in both directions: environmental resources constrain and benefit human societies, while human activities refashion and degrade their environments. Notice in Table 1.1 that some of the case studies in the book involve several themes (i.e., the themes are not mutually exclusive). Geography’s spatial perspective—and all five themes—lead to the heavy use of maps. In the broadest sense, a map is a two-dimensional graphical representation of the surface of the Earth. No map can perfectly represent reality. People tend to think of maps as unalterable facts, as if they were produced by an all-seeing overhead camera. In practice, however, mapmakers (or cartographers, as they are known in the field) exercise considerable discretion in the spatial information they display and the way they display it. You must always keep in mind that any map you look at could have been made in countless different ways, sometimes drastically altering your perception of what you see. Cartographers (mapmakers) make five critical decisions about map construction that greatly influence the message conveyed by the map. First, they choose a particular map projection, which is a systematic method of transferring the spherical surface of the Earth to a flat map. There is an old saying that “all maps lie flat, and all flat maps lie.” It is utterly impossible to represent the three-dimensional world on a flat, two-dimensional piece of paper or video screen without stretching or compressing it in some way. Every projection is therefore distorted in one way or another, and this distortion influences the impression in the viewer’s mind about the size and proximity of different regions of the world (Figure 1.1). For example, Figure 1.1A shows the Mercator projection of the world, a map used in early navigation because all compass bearings (directions) are correct. The British Empire, based on sea power, used the Mercator projection extensively and spread it around the world. However, this projection grossly exaggerates area as you move away from the equator. For this reason, Mercator maps were a favorite of President Reagan during the Cold War because they made the Soviet Union appear much larger than it actually was, reinforcing the impression that the USSR was a dangerous threat and thereby justifying a tough anti-Soviet stance. For the same reason, Mercator projections are unpopular among equatorial countries, whose size appears diminished. A popular projection that attempts to preserve the area of map features and avoid high-latitude distortions is the Mollweide, shown in Figure 1.1B. Many international agencies, such as the World Bank, have changed the map projections they use in an effort to more accurately depict relationships between countries, not biasing any one region. For example, Figure 1.1C shows the van der Grinten projection, which portrays both Russia and Canada at over 200 percent larger than they actually are. The National Geographic Society used this projection for over 50 years before changing to the Robinson projection (Figure 1.1D) in 1998. The Robinson projection better portrays the relationship between land and water areas in the world and does not distort countries at high latitudes nearly as much. Although these four examples of map projections show the shape and size distortions that can occur, they all still adhere to certain conventions that can also be misleading. For instance, they all split the world through the Pacific Ocean, making Japan appear far from Hawaii and the United States. This false impression may have contributed to the “surprise” Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II. Polar projections centered on the North Pole in Figure 1.1E clearly show how close the former Soviet Union and the United States are to each other over the Arctic Ocean, a relationship you cannot see in the first four projections.

True Maps, False Impressions: Making, Manipulating, and Interpreting Maps\n\nFigure 1.1 The projection chosen to draw the spherical earth on flat paper affects the shape of the map and our perception of the relationships between the map features.\n\nat this projection, it becomes obvious that northern Canada and Alaska were good locations for warning stations designed to detect incoming Soviet nuclear missiles. A less common view of the polar projection focused on the South Pole and Antarctica (Figure 1.1F) makes Australia, New Zealand, Chile, and Argentina appear central to the world. In fact, there is no compelling reason for adhering to the convention of showing north at the top on a map. Europe and North America typically occupy the privileged position on a map where our eyes tend to focus, reinforcing the perception of their dominant status in the world. The Earth as seen from space could © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nc01.indd 4\n\n05/12/12 5:01 PM\n\nIntroduction b 5\n\njust as easily be depicted with south up (Figure 1.1G), a radical change that calls into question global geopolitical relations. Finally, the Dymaxion Map™ (Figure 1.1H) reveals the landmasses situated in a worldwide ocean, without visibly distorting the relative shapes and sizes and without splitting any continents. This map, designed by the Buckminster Fuller Institute, attempts to show the global connections of all humanity rather than disassociated countries and places competing against each other. The second critical decision cartographers routinely make is simplification. Simplification can take many forms, such as omission, straightening, exaggeration, and distortion, depending on the map’s ultimate use. Maps of Canada for educational purposes frequently omit small, uninhabited islands and straighten jagged coastlines in the Canadian Arctic, whereas maps for navigation try to show the same features with great accuracy, as well as water depth and currents. Highly simplified subway maps emphasize information that is of potential use to a subway rider and ignore features of the human and natural environment that are unimportant to navigating the subway network (Figure 1.2). Stations five or six blocks apart in the central city appear on the map as far apart as suburban stations separated by several miles, because for most subway travelers, distance is unimportant. What matters is whether they are on the right line, how many stops until they need to get off, and whether they need to change trains. To make road lines readable on the map, they are drawn thicker than if they were drawn proportional to their width in the real world. Some buildings are considered important enough to include, but most are not. No two cartographers make these ultimately subjective decisions in the same way. A third way to manipulate the way a map looks is by choosing a different map scale. Map scale refers to the degree to which a map “zooms in” on an area. Map scale can be defined as the ratio of map distance (distance between two points on a map) to Earth distance (the distance between those two points on the surface of the Earth), measured in the same units. Every map has a scale, and the degree of generalization of information depends on that scale. A large-scale map depicts a small area (such as downtown Phoenix) with great detail. A small-scale map depicts a large area (such as the state of Arizona) but with less detail. You can remember this by considering the size of a particular feature on a map. For example, the larger your city or country appears on a map, the larger the map scale. Another way to remember it is by the fraction that defines the ratio of map distance to Earth distance. On a large-scale map of downtown Phoenix, the scale might be 1/10,000, which is a larger number than 1/1,000,000 for a typical small-scale map of Arizona. A large fraction means large scale; a small fraction means small scale. (Note: We are referring here to the entire fraction, not its denominator. The bigger the denominator, the smaller the fraction and the smaller the map scale.) The case studies in this book explore human geography at a variety of scales. Activities at the global scale (i.e., small-scale maps) include Chapter 7 on international development levels, Activity 1 of Chapter 8 on global agriculture, and Activity 1 of Chapter 14 on global carbon dioxide emissions. At the national or regional scale are Chapter 2 on the Middle East and American Southwest culture regions, Chapter 3 on AIDS diffusion, Chapter 4 on migration to your state or province, Chapter 5 on India’s population, Chapter 6 on economic specialization, Chapter 9 on baseball market areas, Chapter 12 on segregation in Northern Ireland, Chapter 13 on the wars in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq, and Chapter 14 on environmental case studies. Finally, the activities at the local scale (large-scale maps) include Activity 3 of Chapter 8 on local agricultural change in Latin America, Activity 1 of Chapter 9 © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nc01.indd 5\n\n05/12/12 5:01 PM\n\n6 c Chapter 1.

Defining the scale of analysis is important in geography. Many geographical research questions will have different answers when asked at different scales. Take, for instance, airport location. America’s airports are bursting at the seams. Departures have more than doubled since 1980, while only a single major new airport has been built. Most major airlines, with the notable exception of Southwest, operate a hub-and-spokes system, where flights converge at several times of day from all over the country, passengers debark and switch planes if necessary, and then an outgoing bank of flights take passengers to their final destinations. If the © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nc01.indd 6\n\n05/12/12 5:01 PM\n\nIntroduction b 7\n\nMark Leibowitz/Masterﬁle\n\nquestion is whether to locate a new hub airport at a central or peripheral location, the answer is very different at the national and local scales. At the national scale, most hubs for domestic airlines are located in the central region of the United States to minimize detours for passengers switching planes. Major hubs are at Atlanta (Delta), Charlotte (US Air), Chicago (United, American), Cincinnati (Delta), Dallas (Delta, American), Denver (United), Detroit (Delta), Houston (United), Minneapolis (Delta), Philadelphia (US Air), Phoenix (US Air), and Salt Lake City (Delta). Cities in the peripheral corners of the United States, such as Boston, Miami, San Diego, and Seattle, are not used as domestic hubs because they would create huge detours for passengers traveling between most U.S. airport pairs. At the local scale, on the other hand, it would be nearly impossible to locate a new airport in a central location, even though centrality would maximize the airport’s accessibility to the entire metropolitan area. The cost of the land, the security risk, the number of residents and businesses it would displace, and the large populations that would be affected by noise and traffic would pose insurmountable problems for a new centrally located airport. The only major metropolitan airport built in the last two decades—Denver International Airport—is located on Denver’s eastern periphery, out on the prairie (Figure 1.3). Airport location at the local scale thus depends on an entirely different range of issues from those at the national scale. Related to map scale is the fourth cartographic issue, data aggregation. The level of data aggregation influences the spatial patterns we see. By level of aggregation, we are referring to the size of the geographic units under investigation (i.e., cities, counties, states, regions, countries, or groupings of countries, such as Central America, Western Europe, or Eastern Africa). A particular pattern that is revealed at one level of aggregation does not necessarily appear at another. For example, the spatial pattern of college graduates depends on whether you consider counties or states as your unit of analysis. If asked by a high-tech employer: “Where are the highest percentages of people with a college degree?” a good geographer would answer that it depends on the level of geographic resolution you have in mind. At the state level of aggregation, Massachusetts has the highest percentage of people with a bachelor’s degree or higher at 38.2 percent, and West Virginia has the lowest\n\nFigure 1.3 Denver International Airport, built in 1995, is located 20 miles east of the city center.\n\n© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nc01.indd 7\n\n05/12/12 5:01 PM\n\n8 c Chapter 1.

Maps at the county level, however, show that some urban counties and counties with universities in West Virginia have higher percentages of college graduates than do some rural counties in Massachusetts (Figure 1.5). Finally, the fifth way to influence the way a map looks is through the type of map you choose. General-purpose maps with a variety of common features such as cities, boundaries, mountains, and roads are known as reference maps. Maps that highlight a particular feature or a single variable such as temperature, city size, or acreage in potatoes are called thematic maps. There are several types of thematic maps (Figure 1.6). Isoline maps show lines that connect points of equal value (iso means “equal” in Greek). A topographic map, for instance, shows lines of equal elevation above sea level. Crossing an isoline amounts to going up or down\n\nFigure 1.4 Percent of the population over 25 years old with a bachelor’s degree, 2010.

A choropleth map shows the level of some variable within predefined regions, such as counties, states, or countries. It categorizes a variable into classes and depicts each class with different shading patterns or colors. A proportional symbol map uses a symbol such as a circle to show intensity or frequency; the size of the symbol varies with t"
