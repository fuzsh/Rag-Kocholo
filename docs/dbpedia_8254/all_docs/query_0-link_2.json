        "meta_description": "Referring to Europe mainly as a Christian civilization, the Polish Law and Justice Party (PiS) takes part in the current struggle over the definition of European values. This chapter argues that current Polish political conservatism is embedded in and contributes to the global conservative political ideas (both European and non-european) that have emerged and consolidated since the 1980s. It focuses on the narrative about European values that has been shaped by Polish conservative intellectuals. The transnational perspective adopted permits to emphasize the circulation of ideas within transnational networks of conservative intellectuals. First, the group of Polish intellectuals that have contributed to shape PiS's political offer is described. Second, the Polish case is situated in the broader context of the reconfiguration of the European Right. Finally, this chapter takes a closer look at the ideology that is promoted by Polish conservative intellectuals, both in Poland and within transnational circles.",
