Let's do away with appellate level courts, pffff, who needs to have a check and balance system of rogue judges and insane jury verdicts. 3. Let's do away with the electoral college , pfffff, who needs smaller states to vote in presidential elections anyway, just let a handful decide for all of us with just a popular vote; 4. Let's do away with bail, oh wait, my bad, some blue city states already doing that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,check that off the list; 5. Let's just eliminate all US borders,,,oh wait, my bad, already done, check that off the list; 6. Let's just eliminate first amendment rights on social media platforms using govt actors,,,oh wait, my bad, that one done too, check that off the list: 7. Let's just have no voter ID citing racial discrimination, yet we need IDs for booze, cigarettes, boarding a flight at the airports, getting into bars with booze, oh wait, most blue states already done that, check that off the list Sending her flowers now plus tissue,,,,,,,,I know this is a tragedy..............I need chocolate..............................somebody hold me.............\n\nModern right-wing populists across the world have learned from Trump and MAGA that the real gift of grift is in running against government and winning. \"One of the most important ways small parties such as Reform UK can professionalise is to gain a foothold in the House of Commons. Once a party crosses this electoral threshold it is forced to think about how to put itself forward as an opposition party. Crucially, Reform UK has not had access to any public funding to support its role as an opposition party. Assuming that it does return at least one MP at this election, however, it will become eligible for public funding.\" #theconversation #MAGA #populistgrifters #Farage #MarineLePen"
