TICKETMASTER RIVALS SEEK NEW BIZ ■ BY ERIC BOEHLERT NEW YORK — Ever since it pur- chased assets from once-mighty com- petitor Ticketron in 1991, critics have charged that Ticketinasler faces no ri- val and has comered itself a lucrative market. The accusation, \\rith which the Jus- PROTIX tice nepailmont's recent investigation did not concur, stems not only from the 1991 acquisition but from Ticketmas- ter’s well-documented penchant for buying regional playei’s. Among them: New York/Detroit’s TicketWorld in 1985, Florida's Select-A-Seat in 1988, Minneapolis’ Dayton’s Ticketing in 1989, Kansas City, Mo.'s Capital Auto- mated Ticketing in 1989, Atlanta’s SEATS in 1990, Texas’ Southland Corp.’s ticketing assets in 1991, and Boston’s TickelPro in 1998.

Continues Probe ■ BY BRETT ATWOOD LOS ANGELES — Most of the major-label participants in an abandoned U.S. music \\ideo venture may be laying the groundwork for an- other new U.S. music video channel to launch in 1996, soui'ces say. A much-dlscuss^ venture betw’een Warner Music Group, EMI Music, PolyGram, Sony Corp., BMG, and Ticketmastei* has reportedly been called off, although the U.S. Justice De- partment antitrust inquiry' into the proposed m^or- label-backed channel continues. Meanwhile, some industry' sources surest that another U.S. music video channel, backed by many of the same corporations, may be on the horizon. “It’s just too big an op|X)itunity for the ma- jor labels to overlook,” says one source at Warner Music Group. Tw’o sepai'ate sources indicate that the new U.S. channel is likely to be some sort of coUab- oi'ative effort by Germany’s Viva! music net- work and Hong Kong-based Channel V, which is the music video sei-vice of News Coi-p.’s STAR TV. A spokesman for STAR TV did not deny the possibility that a U.S. music \\ndeo channel is in the works but offered no further infonnation. Ironically, most of the major music coipora- tions affiliated with STAR TV and Viva! ai*e the same as those that were {)artnera in the ill-fat- ed U.S. music \\ideo venture. Sony Pictui'es En- tertainment, Warner Music Group, BMG, and EMI Music Groupown 50% ofSTAR TV, while PolyGram, Sony, EMI, and Time Warner ai'e the majority owmers of Viva! At press time, it was unclear whether or not Ticketmaster would be a |)ailner in any new channel pro^Tos- al. Ticketmaster is ah*eady positioning itself as a player in music video j)rogi'amming. Earlier this month, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ticketmaster finalized its acquisition of a 50% stake in the Box UK (see story, page 59). Sources say the fate of the original label- backed music video channel was sealed wth the firing of former Warner Music Group chairman Robert Morgado (Billboard, May 13). “That [music video channel] was mostly Morgado’s thing,” says one industry source. “When he went, it went, too.” However, a source at BMG adds that the venture on shaky ground even before the departure of Morgado. “Not one bit of work has been done to move this project forward for over a year ” says the source. At last November’s Billboard Music Video CJonference, Moigado dted limited cable chan- nel capacity and government reregulation of cable as reasons for the slow development of the channel (Billboard, Nov. 12, 1994). A spokeswoman for MTV had no comment on the decline of its potential major-label- backed competitor. Since 1994, the Justice Department has been investigating antitrust implications in the possibility of five of the six m£oor record labels owning a competitor to MTV. A spokeswoman for the Justice Dei)artment says that the investigation is ongoing, despite the apparent demise of the competitive music video netw'ork. A major obstacle for any new venture re- mains the ability to enter the com|)ctitive cable maricet, which is already faced with an abun- dance of new services and a limited channel ca- I)acity. One of the reasons the ii^jor labels may be anxious to establish a solid music video channel presence on the U.S. cable systems is fro.sti’a- tion with MTVs programming. The network has beefed up its specialty programming over the past few years and significantly lessened its music video content, they say. MTV also has a reputation as a tough nego- tiator when it comes to securing the licensing rights to the music \\ideos that it plays. MTV recently entered into global music video licensing and compilation disc agi’ee- ments with EMI and Sony. The music \\ideo channel is reportedly negotiating similar agreements with Warner, BMG, and Poly- Gram. How ever, none of these licensing agree- ments are exclusive, and they do not prevent the music labels from offering their clips to competing services. The same five record comj)anies had been named in two pai*allel cases ^ing considered by the European Commission — the adminis- ti*ative aim of the Eiuxipean Union — ^and the U.K. courts. In the cases, filecl in 1993, MTV is challenging the m^jora’ light to license videos collectively thixiugh the U.K.’s Video Perfor- mance Ltd. Following MTVs individual licensing deals with Sony and EMI, both labels were removed from the U.K. lawsuit (Billboard, July 15). TLC Files For Bankruptcy; LaFace Among Creditors ■ BY DON JEFFREY NEW YORK— TLC, the hot female R&B trio that has the No. 4 album on The Billboard 200 this week, has filed for bankruptcy, with liabil- ities totaling more than $3.5 n^lion. All three members of the multiplatinum- selling LaFace Records act filed for Chapter 11 creditor protection in the U.S. Bankiuptcy Court in Atlanta. The biggest listed creditor is Lloyd’s of London, which is ow'ed $1.3 million by Lisa Nicole Lopes, known professionally as Left Eye. The amount is a claim against her for burning down the house of her boyfiiend, for- mer Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Andre Ri- sen. Lopes pleaded guilty to arson in Decem- ber 1994 and was sentenced to several months in a halfway house. Other creditors also include their record la- bel, LaFace, and their production company, Pebbitone. Pebbitone, w'hich produced their best-selling albums, is ow'ed $^,434 by each of the women, for a total of more than $1.7 mil- lion, according to court papers. LaFace is owed a total of $387,000. TLC’s attorney David Bisbee says the LaFace and Pebbitone amounts w’ere “the best numbcra available to us at the time of the filing, but they may not be accurate.” He adds that TLC’s “schedules of assets have not been filed.” Court papers indicate the group’s total assets are less than $1.5 million. Representatives of Pebbitone and LaFace were unavailable for comment at press time. Besides Lopes, TLC consists of Tionne Watkins (T-Boz) and Rozonda Ocielian Thom- as (Chilli). TLC’s current album, “CrazySexyCool,” has sold 2.9 million units as of July 9, according to SourulScan, and has yielded thi*ee top 10 singles, “Creep,” “Red Light Special,” and “Waterfalls.\" The act’s first album, “Ooooooohhh ... On The TLC Tip,” has sold 2.3 million units, according to Sound- Scan.

The studio recently signed a re- ported 10-year deal with a company called Vision Information Services. The deal gives the FoxVideo label ex- clusive rights to the Vision electronic data interchange system, which tracks tape sales w'hile helping to fill orders for fresh inventory. Vision isn’t considered to be cutting edge, and observers say rival studios could readily devise competing EDI systems. But FoxVideo does have the lead among the Hollyw'ood majors — ex- cluding Disney — in the race for direct accounts. And the studio has every in- tention of exploiting its advantage with the steady release of big-name catalog titles at $9.98 suggested list; retailers say this is huiting the sales of higher priced reissues. Although trade observers harbor doubts about the ability of FoxVideo to sustain direct sales beyond a handful of accounts, the vendor reportedly thinks Vision is necessary to manage what it calls the “exponential growth\" of sell-through for cassettes and multi- media product. With a substantial amount of catalog at less than $10, FoxVideo believes the best way to maintain margins in a volume-driven business is to save on the middlemen by delivering to individual stores itself. FoxVideo president Bob DeLellis, w'ho wasn’t available for comment, has the support of Bill Mechanic, presi- dent'COO of Fox Filmed Entertain- ment. Mechanic was instrumental in forging a direct sale structure for Dis- ney*s Buena Vista Home Video, which dominates the sell-through market. Disney and GoodTimes Home Video, another sell-through powerhouse, have aggressively courted direct ac- counts, now thought to be 10-12 chains. They incude Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target Stores, and Toys ‘R’ Us. How successful the tw^o have been in convincing retailers to drop rack- jobbers such as Handleman Co. and Anderson Merchandisers isn’t known, since neither vendor will discuss fail- ures or list their conversions. The na- Data Problems On Sales Charts Sales information for two major music accounts is not included in this w'eek’s music charts due to problems at the two companies. A problem with missing data from Amarillo, Texas-based Ander- son Merchandisers prompted SoundScan to omit the rackjobber’s sales from its chart calculations. Meanw'hile, a computer malfunc- tion at Minneapolis-based Best Buy prevented that chain from report- ing its sales. SoundScan adjusted the weights of other similar information providers to account for the missing data. tion’s biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, is the biggest plum, however. Wal-Mart, already direct with Dis- ney and GoodTimes, has added four studios in recent months and is nego- tiating delivery terms with at least two strong secondaiy suppliei’s. New Line Home Video and WarnerVision. Others, likely to include PolyGram Video, are expected to go direct as well (Billboard, June 3). The changeover wll cost Handle- man and Andei*son, which rack Wal- Mart stores, significant video rev- enues. In fact, Anderson, formerly owned by Wal-Mart under the name Western Merchandisei*s, is said to be fighting with suppliers over returns of releases that Wal-Mart wull no longer accept as racked pro<luct “Anderson is sitting on a lot of goods,” says one home video execu- tive, w’ho adds, “We’re going to have to see w'hat happens before going for- w'ard.” Another says that “more than a few vendors aren’t shipping” until Anderson pays for w'hat it’s bought. The hope is that if Wal-Mait won’t take delivery, newsstands might. An- derson Merchandisers parent Ander- son News racks periodicals, and the addition of video to its mix of newspa- pers, magazines, and books “was one of the things we talked about,” a source says. “They’re not going to go aw’ay.” FoxVideo used Wal-Mart in its test of the Vision point-of-sale system, w'hich tracked 8.7 million copies of “Speed” in November 1994 and 3 mil- lion units of “The Pagemaster” in April. Separately, the studio claims that ‘The Pagemaster,” now at nearly 4 million units, ranks as the industry’s best-selling direct-to-sell-through, non-Disney animated title. The question is w’ho else will install Vision. Caldor, a discount chain based in the Northeast, is considered a hot prospect, but trade sources don’t know of any others. Handleman re- portedly is telling program suppliers that none of its i*ack accounts are in- (Co7itimied on page 83) NEW YORK — Fitness guru Richard Simmons has GoodTimes Entertain- ment working out in markets far from home video. New York-based GoodTimes, w'hich started 1 1 years ago with a line of public domain titles, is now placing Simmons’ name on low^-fat snack foods, fitness apparel, and footwrear. Simmons’ tapes, such as “Sweating To The Oldies,” are big sellers, but, says Andrew Greenberg, recently named president of the newiy formed GoodTimes Entertainment Group, ‘Sve quickly realized that Richard w'as more than an exercise video.” And GoodTimes, apparently, is more than a cassette vendor. Green- berg, a nine-year GoodTimes veteran, is responsible for exploiting the com- pany’s distribution clout, which has given it ready access to mass mer- chants Wal-Mart, Kmart, and per- haps 10 other major retailers. Previously executive VP of Good- Times Entertainment, Greenberg now oversees GoodTimes Licensing and Merchandising, GoodTimes ■ BY IRV LICHTMAN NEW YORK — Members attending the National Music Publishers’ Assn, annu- al meeting in New York July 10 got more good news on mechanic^ collec- tions, as well as preliminary reports that the global publishing scene contin- ues to reflect beaming copyright usage. In addition, reports on legislative and legal initiatives, including the compromise digital-performance rights bills before Congress, provided an upbeat picture for the enhancement of the mechanical revenue stream to NMPA members — and the catalogs they represent — as digital transmis- sion of music emerges in the years ahead. Ed Murphy, NMPA/HFA presi- dent/CEO, said 1994 was another “ex- cellent year” for the Harry Fox ^ency, the mechanical collection arm of NMPA, which collected a record $357.9 million. HFA collections have grown an average of 26% annually in the last decade. In 1984, when mem- Foods, GoodTimes Direct, Good- Times Entertainment International, and GoodTimes Publishing and Au- dio. GoodTimes Home Video, still the biggest revenue producer, and GT In- teractive, are separate entities. All report to Joe Cayre, presi- dent/CEO of GoodTimes Entertain- ment Worldwide, which is expected to rack up sales of $1 billion this year. The units are privately held, but trade sources say GT Interactive will be taken public, possibly later this year. Simmons, who came to GoodTimes about three years ago, is being devel- oped as the model for future brand- name talent that can be marketed throughout the company. “The mas- ter plan,” says Greenberg, “is to be as vertically integrated as we can.” Be- cause of his visibility, “we’ve been concentrating on Richard to start Li- censing and Merchandising,” which will spill over into other areas. Simmons popcorn and pretzels be- gan appearing a year ago in Wal-Mart and, according to Greenberg, the name likely will appear on a new' non- bership stood at 4,000, compared to 14,000 today, collections wei*e just un- der $100 million. The showing last year, Murphy added, has enabled HFA to implement low’er commission rates for the third and fourth quar- ters of the year, retroactive to July 1. Similar results in 1993 saw a reduc- tion of commission rates by 1% last year; this year’s rate i*eduction will be higher, at 1V«%. Thus, from July 1 to Dec. 31, the rate on mechanical distri- bution will be lowered to 2.75% from 4.6%. Murphy also noted that the rate on TV synchronization licensing distribu- tions will be lowered to 3% from 5%. \"For the third consecutive year,” Mur- phy said, “HFA’s commission rates have been reduced [toj their low’est levels in more than tw'o decades.” With upgraded computer capabilities, Mur- phy said, HFA is doing a better job of fat Alpine Lace cheese. Meanwhile, GoodTimes Direct has been selling a $39.95 Simmons “Farewell To Fat” package of two videos, toning cord, newsletter subscription, audio cas- sette, and a Carnival Cruise discount coupon via an infomericial. One goal of the year-old, $12 million campaign has been to prep the retail trade for the cassettes. The first, “Dis- cosweat,” arrives in late 1995 at $19.99 suggested list, says (k>odTimes Home Video senior VP Jeff Baker. “Richard is very hot right now,” he says. A sec- ond title, “Tone & Sweat,” should ship in 1996. “Andy and I have a very good relationship,” Baker adds. GoodTimes Entertainment Group’s next crossover stars may be the car- toons of “The Berenstain Bears.” Greenberg says GoodTimes Publish- ing will have books featuring the pop- ular family in stores prior to the start of the 1996 school year. Random House and Western Pub- lishing have had the bulk of the “Bear” book, television, and video (Contimied on page 83) recovering unpaid royalties, of which $12 million w’as distributed in 1994. “This returned 92% of HFA’s mechan- ical commissions to our publishei*s.” According to Murphy, mechanical income currently accounts for be- tw'een 30% and 40% of songwiiter and publisher earnings. Murphy noted that growth in Latin repertoire revenues is expected this year, with $12 million in collections, an increase of 20% over 1994. In an assessment of music publisher well-being globally, Murphy said that an upcoming report from collection so- cieties in 48 countries covering 1993 results (the last year for w'hich figures are available) would show total annual collections of more than $5 billion, 6% more than figures for 1992. “Once again . . . the top 10 markets accounted for almost 90% of reported revenues, a clear indication that the most legiti- mate revenues continue to be generat- ed in those markeLs with the sti*ongest copyright laws: the U.S., Western Eu- rope, and Japan. “However, there are positive signs of growing w'orldwide acceptance of the importance of copyright protec- tion. For 1993, a total of 37 countries, seven more than in the 1992 suiwey, repoited annual royalties of at least $1 million,” Murphy said. In a legislative and legal update — later expanded upon by NMPA chair- man Irw'in Robinson and general counsel Peter Felcher of the New York law' firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison — Murphy said “settlement talks are ongoing” in a copy- rigdit infringement suit by Frank Music (Continued on page 79) Image Nears Purchase Of Miramar Label NEW YORK — Image Entertainment has signed a letter of intent to acquire Miramar, the Seattle-based audio and video label, sources say. If the deal goes through, it w'ould be the second acquisition the company has made in a month. Image just com- pleted a deal for V.T. Laser, a laserdisc one-stop also known as U.S. Laser, for $3.1 million (Billboard, July 15). Executives at Miramar w'ere unavailable for comment, and Image chairman/CEO Martin Greenw'ald re- fuses to comment But sources say the deal awaits completion of due diligence by Image. Terms of the deal w'ere not available, but Miramar has been on the block for more than a year. Sources say Mira- mar previously had discussions with BMG, its current distributor, and Al- liance Entertainment Corp., its previ- ous distributor, among others. Miramar generates annual revenue of about $6 million, with more than half of that coming from video sales. Among the artists signed to its audio label are Tangerine Dream and Jan Hammer. Among its top video titles is the Mind’s Eye series. Image, based in Chatsworth, Calif., is the top licensee and distributor of laserdi^ in North America. If the deal is completed, it w'ould mark Image’s first involvement in becoming an originator of content for entertainment software. ED CHRISTMAN “Major” Sales.

Japan 3-3262-7246 fax 3-3262-7247 B&cxid Mude GroL^ Commentari/ U.S. Must Protect Jazz, Its ‘Classic’ Music Foim ■ BY YUSUF GANDHI The article *\"Hip Jazz B(X>sts Adult Alter- native Radio” (Billboard, April 15) may have delighted some jazz^AC format propo- nents, but to a lot of contemporary jazz mu- sicians and fans, it spelled disenchantment with current radio trends. According to comments in the article, it seems that some programmers and con- sultants no longer perceive jazz as a valid art form, but as a mere “chart” form. No wonder some of the greatest artists of our time are not receiving the airplay they de- serve. Jazz has evolved through the years, with artists drawing on their experiences and the sounds of their environments. In the late ’60s and early ’70s, artists such as Miles Davis, the Crusaders, Ramsey Lewis, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Weather Report, John McLaughlin, and others evolved their jazz stylings using rock/R&B elements to create what is re- ferred to as “fusion” or “contemporary jazz.” This gave rise to stations such as WRVR New York, which played a variety of jazz music and present^ the opportunity to lis- ten to a wide spectrum of music and artists. This in turn generated record sales not only for contemporary artists, but for traditional musicians to vsdiom the baby boomer audi- ence could listen for the first time. However, in the early ’80s, major corpo- rations started to buy out these stations and converted their formats to cater to pop- ular music forms. Contemporary jazz artists saw a ray of hope in the late ’80s, when the format was revived as jazz/AC, which encompassed, once again, a wide variety of contemporary jazz artists. But these stations have now shrunk their formats, eliminating the crea- tive musicians who have been on the cutting edge of the ever-evolving contemporary jazz circuit In fact, the jazz/AC format has become akin to soft AC formats. A host of pop artists are being passed off as “smooth jazz,” which is misleading to baby boomers, who are completely unfamiliar with the art- ists who established this genre. One of the strangest phenomena I have come across in my experience with jaz^ AC formats is the negation of some recent jazz recordings, which are called too “ur- ban.” That does not make sense, since jazz was created in urban environments (New Orleans, New York, Chicago). If by “ur- ban” the stations mean “black,” then I can- not understand their reason for playing artists such as Luther Vandross, Anita Baker, and even Michael Bolton (whose songs manifest the traditions of soul mu- sic). Creativity is the essence of jazz music. To expect jazz artists to format their music to ftt jazz/'AC stations is in effect restricting creativity. One understands the financial aspects of jazz'AC stations tightening their formats. However, their programmers and consultants seem to underestimate the in- telligence of adult listeners. Money cannot always be the bottom line for radio stations. They have a duty to edu- cate and inform their listeners. Why can they not have a couple of hours a day of con- temporary cutting-edge music, which would give listeners an insight into not only the veteran innovators, such as Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and others men- tioned earlier, but also the wealth of younger talent, such as Kenny Garrett, Roy Hargrove, and Dianne Reeves. Radio is not the only culprit The govern- ment, industry foundations such as 1s “Be American, Buy American” limited to the auto industry?’ Yusuf Gandhi Is prssIdent/CEO of Hip Bop/Sllva Serssn Records America Inc., New York. NARAS, and some m^jor labels have al- most ignored the contributions of contem- porary jazz musicians. A few years ago, I was appalled to learn that some of the Eur- opean governments spend a greater per- centage of their cultural budgets to support their local jazz artists than does the U.S. government Politicians now want to cut funding to public radio — the only outlet remaining for traditional jazz. The U.S. government and so-called be- nevolent foundations spend more dollars promoting performances by philharmonic orchestras (which play the music of Euro- pean composers) than they do jazz music. A small fortune was spent at the World Cup in Los Angeles to present the 3 Ten- ors. Was there no comparable talent of American music available in the U.S.? Is the slogan “Be American, Buy American” limited to the automobile industry? (The Japanese seem to respect and listen to more jazz music than do Americans.) Unless radio, the government, the vari- ous foundations, and record labels jointly pool their resources and act expediently, we will kill America’s only true classical music form— jazz. LETTERS FINDING WONDERFUL TALENTS Thanks to Timothy White for writing such a lovely piece on Peter Ostroushko and his music (“Ostroushko’s American Heartstrings,” Music To My Ears, Bill- board, June 17). I have long appreciated the fact that White gives as much time to artists on smaller labels as he gives to the majors, and he writes about these artists so eloquently. At Red House Rec- ords we love to find wonderful talents and introduce their music to as many people as possible. It’s very enjoyable to find someone who likes to do the same.

What I ap- preciated most was the focus on the younger seasoned professionals who are really running our businesses on a day- to-day basis.

Robinson Chairman/CEO The Famous Music Publishing Cos. New York ALBUM ROCK AHEAD OF ALTERNATIVE As indicated by Phyllis Stark’s story, “Modern Rock Continues Ratings Climb\" (Billboard, June 24), it is true that alternative radio is gaining major ground in terms of format growth, and this change has forced many rock sta- tions to reinvent themselves. Album rock’s audience share may be down to 8.1% in the winter Billboard/ Arbitron national format ratings from its summer 1991 high of 10.2%, but it’s still practically five shares ahead of al- ternative. There will probably be more erosion of album rock, but I don’t think rock radio is in jeopardy of losing its au- dience, nor is its health severely dam- aged. By the end of 1995, we’ll see at least another 20 or 30 alternative stations come on board, and then we’ll probably start seeing alternative level off in terms of new stations. This is positive for both rock and alternative radio. It will make both formats stronger. Rock and alternative in most cases are catering to different demographics — one predominantly male and the other female — and in both formats there are many overlapping niches. Overall, rock is still dominant with regard to au^ence share, and if stations become more ag- gressive with their music and their over- all sound, they should continue to domi- nate. Alan Oreman Promotions Getfen Records Los Angeles PARENTS MUST TAKE A STAND WITH KIDS As a mother of four and an independ- ent music retailer, I must respond to the article “Chains Wary Of Stickered Al- bums” (Billboard, June 10). It is the par- ents’ responsibility to know the who, what, where, and when of their chil- dren’s lives. It is a crazy world, and as parents it is our responsibility to raise our children. It is not the responsibility of Hollywood or the music intlustries or anyone else. The issue is now turning into a mud- slinging bit of politics. To keep these CDs and tapes out of the hands of mi- nors, blank tapes should not be sold to them either, or any tape for that matter, since even old or unwanted tapes can be taped over.

It’s a dream because Buffett's large and loyal fan base made his last album, “Fruitcakes,” platinum and his four-CD boxed set, “Bars, Beaches, Boats And Ballads,” MCA’s best-selling such collection, with more than 600,000 sold. The challenge comes in finding ways to reach that fan base. To that end, the label has come up with some innovative ways to alert consumers to the Aug. 1 release of Buffett’s new Margarita\\ille/MCA al- bum, “Barometer Soup.” “'liiere’s nothing like being given a marketing challenge and then going with the plan and having it work,” Hinton says, “and the reason it works so well is that Buffett’s fans ai*e so fa- natical. If we tell them the album is out there, it’s kind like ‘Field Of Dreams’ — they will come.” To reach Buffett fans, MCA/ Nashville will utilize a variety of pro- motional avenues, from sailing maga- zines to baseball parks to the Weather Channel. “Aside from radio, how do you reach a per- son? You reach them by print, tele- vision, and touring, or other opportuni- ties, like a baseball park,” Hinton says. “Anywhere congregations gather and w'e can get their attention captive for a moment, w'e’re trying to figure out how' we can get in front of them . . . We know we have that core of fans, ‘the Parrotheads,’ but the drill for us every year is to expand that base.” Dave Weigand, MCA’s VP of sales and marketing, says the label will hold listening parties at retail stores, including Camelot and Musicland outlets, the w'eekend prior to the al- bum’s release. Weigand says more than 500 stores are participating in release activities, including elaborate Buffett theme parties. Consumers will be offered discount coupons tow'ard the pur- chase of “Barometer Soup,” and stores are promoting the parties through in-store signage. Retailers are primed for Buffett’s new release. “We’re stepping out on this record based on his history with us,” says Doug Smith, senior buyer at Pittsburgh-based National Record Mart. According to Smith, Buffett not only does w'ell in the 150-store chain’s East Coast locations, but in land- locked states such as Ohio and Penn- sylvania. “He hits home with the blue- collar population, and this is certainly a working part of the country.” (Continued on jmge 83) BUFFETT Terry Adams’ Solo Flight Is Jazz Set On New World ■ BY JIM MACNiE NEW YORK — It took more than three decades to coax the spirited new' solo album from keyboardist/ composer Terry Adams, the uncon- ventional leader of NRBQ, and now that it has arrived, it’s “Terrible.” A gleeful fling that straddles the fence be- tween instru- ADAMS mental pop and modern jazz, the wryly titled disc will be available commercially in early August. It is one of four summer jazz releases on the New World label, a 20-year-old, not-for-profit concern with 250 ti- tles in its catalog. New' World was instituted by the Rockefeller Foun- dation to document music — includ- ing classical and jazz — ignored by commercial labels. New’ World is planning an ex- tended, rigorous push for “Terri- ble,” with much of its efforts tied in with NRBQ’s current tour sched- ule. Paul Marotta, New' World’s managing direc- tor, says materi- als will “go out to the salespeople so they can co- ordinate with live dates. Radio- wise, w'e’ll do pretty extensive commercial and noncommercial mailings on this. It’s the summer, so W'e’re not doing the heavy col- lege mailing right now. But we’ll come back in the fall and take care of that.” “Terrible” will also be boosted by (Continued on page 72) Birthday Bash.

Holly Cole Takes Spin Into Dark ‘Temptation’ Metro Blue Set Of Waits Tunes Is More Than Tribute ■ BY LARRY LeBLANC TORONTO— Blue Note Record exec- utives are predicting that Holly Cole’s electrifjnng Metro Blue album, “Temptation,” due in the U.S. Aug. 15, w'ill distance the 31-year-old Canadian performer from her jazz/ ))op past. The darkly hued album, produced by Craig Street (Cassandra Wilson), features interpretative performances of 16 Tom Waits compositions. The album is being called Cole’s solo debut. And while it feature.^ such players as drummer Dougie Browne, guitarist Kevin Breit, percussionist Cyro Baptista, saxophonists Earl Seymour and Perry White, and the Canadian Brass, “Temptation” is finnly centered around Cole, pianist Aaron Davis, and bassist David Piltch, who have performed as the Holly Cole Trio for the past nine years. Label executives say that outside of Canada and Japan, and particularly in Europe and the U.S., marketing Cole’s previous albums under the Holly Cole Trio moniker has been an appai*ent drawback. They expect that dropping the jazz-inflected “trio” tag, coupled with a slight change in musi- cal direction toward pop, will provide gi’eater opportunities for radio and retail acceptance. “We’ve had a tough time getting the focus off the trio doing Cole Porter and George & Ira Gershwin tunes,” says Tom Ben*y, Cole’s man- ager and president of EMI-Canada’s Alert Records, w'hich releases Cole’s albums in Canada. “People have over- looked that she sings songs by con- Island Picks Hicks To Helm New Black Division BYJ.R. REYNOLDS In an effort to increase its R&B presence. Island Records has formed a black music division and tapped vet- eran artist manager Hiriam Hicks as its senior VP/GM. The first Island album under the Hicks regime will be the soundtrack to the Keenen Ivory Wayans-directed film, tentatively titled “Don’t Be A Menace . . . ,” set for a fall release. Acts confirmed at press time to be on the album include Boyz II Men, SWV, Keith Sweat, and Luther Campbell. Hicks is based in New York and will report to Island president/CEO John Barbis, as well as to label founder/chairman Chris Blackw'ell on creative issues. Blackw'ell says he has wanted to create an R&B music division for five years but could not find the right ex- ecutive to i*un it. “Hiriam comes from manager roots, just like me,” says Blackwell. “He understands (artists] and their points of view' because of working so closely with them in recording studios and on the road.” Hicks has represented several suc- cessful R&B acts, including TLC, Sw'eat, and Bell Biv DeVoe. He began his music career in the ’80s as tour manager for the teen gi’oup New' Edi- tion. Subsequently, he went into tal- ent management, representing vari- ous artists, writers, and producers. Although the Island brass gave Hicks the leeway to continue running his management company, Hicks says he will “eventually” relinquish those duties. “I w'ant to focus on w’hat I need to do here [at Island],” Hicks says. “I have a lot to prove.” Some industry observers are con- cerned about Hicks’ ability to run a division, given his lack of label experi- ence. However, Hicks remains confi- dent, citing his wealth of industry re- lationships and artist manager skills as tools for success in his new post. Says Hicks, “I’ve always been an entrepreneur by heart and have demonstrated I know' the record in- dustry from the outside. Now I want to take on the challenges of the busi- ness fix)m the inside.” Blackw'ell says Hicks’ outsider sta- tus will not pose a problem, adding the division already has an executive staff that will provide a support sys- tem during his transition. Says Blackwell, “The main thing is to have a sense of talent and make the best records possible, while correctly positioning the artist — that’s the core of the record business.” Current Island executives who will report to Hicks include promotion VP Ronnie Johnson, A&R senior director Leotis Clybum, marketing senior di- (Coniimied on page 72) temporarj' wTitei*s as w'ell.” Says Bnice Lundvall, president of Blue Note Records, “Holly has never broken in England or in Europe be- cause our [EMI] companies there didn’t know w’hat to do w'ith her other records. They’ve certainly got it this time with ‘Temp- tation.’ I had our international peo- ple in New York for meetings in April, and she played a half-hour showcase at the Mercury Lounge and floored everybody. Now w'e’ve got everybody in Europe and the U.K. [EMI] saying, ‘We’re going to break this girl with this record.’ ” In Europe, Cole has been consid- ered a developing jazz artist, accord- ing to Piero Giramonti, senior direc- tor of international at Capitol Records. “We’ve never had the op- portunity to expose her to a wider au- dience there,” he says. “Now' with her performing music which is more ac- cessible to a pop crossover market, w’e can market her in that direction.” Tom Evered, VP of marketing for Blue Note/Metro Blue, feels the al- bum will give American radio listen- ers the opportunity to hear Cole for the first time. “Holly has had very little airplay in the States, but w'ith this album we have a real shot at college, triple-A, and at the National Public Radio sta- tions,” he says. “We don’t have a sin- gle scheduled yet. We're going to triple-A radio and college [radio] first, W’hich are not single-formatted.

Ozaki’s alienated but articu- late lyrics gave voice to the frustra- tions of thousands of kids who struggle to co])e with the madness of the adult world. And unfortunately, like Cobain, who passed away in May 1994, Oza- ki’s only escape from the struggle lay in death. Ozaki has not been allowed to rest in |)eace. Some 100,000 of his fans have signed a peti- ozaw tion asking the po- lice to re-open the investigation into his death. The petition was sponsoi'ed by Ozaki’s father and bi*other, who be- lieve the artist didn’t die thi’ough mis- adventure but was murdered. Some- body, they think, made him consume (just how isn’t clear) alcohol and dings in sufficient amounts to kill him. Sony Records, to which Ozaki was signed when he died, maintains the official version — that Ozaki’s death had nothing to do with drug use. But many people in the music business here don’t buy that, citing Ozaki’s 1987 arrest and iS-month suspended sentence for possession of stimulant dings. That incident affiinied Ozaki’s out- law status and caused him to be tem- porarily dropped by Sony; the compa- ny re-signed him in 1990. The rocker’s widow, Shigemi, claims she has a testament, found in Ozaki’s wallet at the time of his death, in which he allegedly expresses his desire to take his own life. Shigemi has been living in the United States because of what she says are threats from Ozaki fans who are jealous of her control over the artist’s estate. The police say no suicide note was found on Ozaki when he died, and some cynical observer have gone so far as to suggest that the controversy over Ozaki’s demise is a PR scam de- signed to keep his name in the media (Continued on page 77) Atlantic Makes Commitment To Ireland’s Corrs Angelic Hymn.

Founded in 1937. the American Boychoir performs five major concert tours each year and provided the voices for Kodak's “True Colors\" campaign. ■ BY STEVE McCLURE TOKYO — Singer/songwriter Yutaka Ozaki has never been more popular. His single “Oh My Little Girl” racked up sales of more than 1 million units last year after being used as a TV dra- ma theme song. His face is in all the weekly magazines. Ozaki-related goods such a.s clothes, accessories, and books ai*e hot sellei*s. And he’s inspired several other rock bands, including Soul Flower Union, Kiyoshiro Imawano, and Rankin Taxi, to follow in his anti-es- tablishment footsteps. It’s a perfect pop success story, ex- cept for one small problem — Ozaki is dead. Since his passing at the age of 26 on April 25, 1992, Ozaki has become a Japanese folk hero. His story — the rock’n’roll rebel who followed the path of excess and paid the ultimate price — echoes Japanese history’s many tales of doomed heroes who fought against impossible odds and perished in a blaze of glorj'. Ozaki’s death was anything but glo- rious — he died of excessive accumula- tion of fluid in his lungs (pulmonar>' edema) several hours after being found drunk and naked in a Tokyo al- ley in the early morning. Yet his abil- ity to express the frustrations of young people chafing under a con- formist social system made him a genuine Japanese rock martyr. Such frustration was captured in songs like “High School Rock ’N Roll,” which contained the lyrics ‘T don’t want to be crushed in the rush hour until my death/Why, to whom and what do have I have to be tied?/I ■ BY JIM BESSMAN NEW YORK — It’s a classic record business story, right out of “The Commitments.” The Corrs, four siblings from County Louth, Ireland, were heard by U.S. ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith at a small club in nearby Dublin, then invited by her to play at a World Cup celebration last summer in Boston.

Foster was busy at the Hit Factoi 7 producing a Michael Jackson session, but that didn’t stop the Corrs. They walked over to the studio anyw'ay and waited for him to come out. “They were sitting there with their instruments and looked so stunning that I had to take them into the studio immediately to hear what their music was about,” says Foster of siblings Andrea Corr, vocalist and tin whistler; Caroline Corr, vocalist and percussionist: Sharon Corr, vocalist and violinist; and Jim Corr, vocalist, keyboardist, and guitarist, whom Foster describes as “the ugly sister and tremendously talented boy who I saw myself in.” The impromptu audition, he adds, “was just mind-blowing. I’ve spent my whole life looking for something different, and here it was standing right in front of me!” Besides the stunning looks, Foster was taken by the Corrs’ unusual blend of melodic pop vvith traditional Celtic underpinnings. In short order, the group was signed to Atlantic via a joint venture between Foster’s and Flom’s fledgling labels, 143 and Lava, respectively. The Corrs’ self-titled debut, a mix of originals and tradi- tional fare, is due Sept. 5 on the At- lantic-distributed 143/Lava. “It’s important to Atlantic, because we don’t really have an act of this type,” says Atlantic Group president Val Azzoli. “They’re a poppy kind of folk — a Wilson Phillips kind of act, which we’ve never had. It’s exciting because pure pop records are hard to THE conns come by, and this is a beautiful song- driven record with beautiful vocals.” Adds Foster, “They’ll fill a big slot that’s available right now, which could be a Wilson Phillips kind of slot — though that might look bad in print! Andrea has a Karen Carpenter softness — though it’s impossible to compare anyone to Karen. The music has more of an edge than Wilson Phillips and the Carpenters, and there’s also an element of Yes, be- cause the music’s complicated.” Tom Poleman, PD of Houston’s al- ternative-leaning top 40 station KRBE, cautions against labels but othenvise agrees wdth the descrip- tions and the belief in the Corrs’ po- tential. “A lot of people will cop out and call it ‘Wilson Phillips gone Irish,’ but it’s much more than that,” says Poleman. “It’s music with strong vo- cal harmonies and infectious pop hooks, with a tinge of their Irish her- itage. It will really w’ork well with a lot of mainstream AC and new AC stations.” The Corrs, says Sharon, see their music as “a mixture of Irish and mod- em” in the sense that they many tra- ditional Irish instruments — including tin whistle, fiddle, flute, and bodhi*^n drum — with contemporary technolo- gy'. All classically schooled, the four siblings further project a pop influ- ence picked up from their semiprofes- sional musician parents, w'ho special- ized in easy-listening covers by the likes of the Eagles and Carpenters. Hence, “melody and the harmony vo- cal aspect is veiy important,” notes Andrea. The Corrs formed their own band (Continued on page 77) RECORD COMPANIES.

That’s one of the questions Epitaph Rec- ords is pondering with the release of Rancid’s third album, “And Out Come The Wolves,” which is due in stores Aug. 22. According to label president Brett Gurewitz, Epitaph has shipped “around 450,000 copies” of “Let’s Go,” the second album from the quartet, which rose out of Northern California’s punk-satu- rated East Bay scene some four years ago. (SoundScan puts the number sold to consumers at 210,000.) But judging by guitarist/ vocalist Lars Frederiksen’s take on things. Rancid hasn’t lost touch with its roots. “When you grow up totally living punk rock, it’s like the color of your skin, not something you can just change,” says Frederiksen, who splits songwriting duties evenly with guitarist/singer Tim Armstrong and bassist/singer Matt Freeman. The fourth member is \\ /t ■ RANCID drummer Brett Reed. “We have certain ethics that we will continue to stick by no matter what. When you grow up thinking the audience and band are on the same level, you don’t start to act like rock stars,” Frederiksen says. Rancid has backed up those words in several ways, not the least of which was its llth-hour rejection of a seemingly completed deal with Epic (The Beat, Billboard, Jan. 7). Instead, it signed another one-al- bum deal with Epitaph. “It doesn’t seem right to offer long-term deals, which only benefit labels, not artists,” says Epitaph president Brett Gurewitz, former ■ BY MELINDA NEWMAN and LARRY FUCK NEW YORK— An album of rock-ori- ented songs is probably the last thing that Boy George’s fans would expect from the pop-dance icon. But then; he’s never gone for the expected, and ac- cording to him, his new Virgin disc, “Cheapness & Beauty,” simply shows another side of his multifaceted personality. “Music is music, and all I’m doing with this album is boygeorge exploring a differ- ent form of expression,” says George. “I grew up with harder rock sounds like [David] Bowie. In facL he was an obses- sion of mine. I used to turn up at his house and stand there like a fan. I was a punk. It was all about Patti Smith, the Ramones, anything but disco.” The new album, to be released by Virgin on Aug. 29, is certainly “any- thing but disco.” The songs run the gamut from hard, ’80s-style rock to midtempo, acoustic folk-styled num- bers. (Dance Trax, Billboard, April 15). Much of Virgin’s marketing plan is being coordinated in coqjunction with the mid-September release of George’s autobiogr^hy, “Take It Like A Man,” \\sdiich is already out in the U JC, accord- ing to Phil Fox, Virgin’s director of product management Ihe first 1(X),0(X) copies of the book will include a book- mark touting George’s new album. “We figure anyone who is a big enou^ fan to pick up the book will definitely want to know about the new album,” says Fox. Virgin and the book’s publisher, Har- perCollins, are also discussing the pos- sibility of George doing in-stores at re- tailers that sell both records and books. “In terms of appearances, we’re working very closely with HarperCol- lins. We’ve given th&n a list of radio stations in various maihets,” says Fox.

In an interesting twist, the first single from “And Out Come The Wolves” will be a rerelease of “Roots Radical,” which was issued as a nonalbum cut late last year.

Negotiated, The Samples Had Time To Sample MCA by Melinda Newman OAMPLE SALE: Let this story serve as a re- minder that he who hesitates is lost. Billboard was among many magazines to announce that hot indie band the Samples were going from W.A.R.? to Hollywood Records. However, the Colorado band has now linked with MCA. What happened? Accord- ing to the Samples’ manager Ted Guggenheim, Hollywood edged out MCA initially, in part because the band did not know how or if MCA would be re- structured following its sale to Seagram. “Essen- tially, the negotiation between W.A.R.? and the Samples and Hollywood took a lot longer than we had expected,” says Gug- genheim. “During that time, the Samples had an opportunity to see [how] MCA would be afrer the deal took effect, and they saw that the atmosphere was even better than before the sale. I really love Hollywood and think they’re going to have a great future, but the negotia- tions took so long it gave the band time to look. MCA got the deal done in 24 hours.” The deal has already gone into effect. MCA’s pro- motion department is working “Way Of The World” to top 40 right now, while modern rock single “As Tears Fall” will go to radio next month. The singles, which are featured on the Samples’ current W.A.R.? album, “Autopilot,” will be distributed by the label. The next album, which the band will begin working on by year’s end, will be completely handled by MCA. However, two members of the band plan to is- sue solo albums on W.A.R.? within the next year. Hollywood president Bob Pfeifer is gracious, if cliched, in defeat “You win a few, you lose a few,” he says. “We wish the Samples the best of luck.” Food for thought: As a friend of mine pointed out, with Seagram’s acquisition of MCA, for the first time each of the six major record companies has a parent of a different nationality. PolyGram is Dutch-owned (Philips), BMG is German-owned (Ber- telsmann), MCA is Canadian-owned (Seagram), Sony is Japanese-owned (Sony Corp.), EMI is Bri- tish-owned (Thom-EMI), and Warner Music Group remains American-owned (Time Warner). On a similar trivia note, should former Warner Bros, chairman Mo Ostin end up running the MCA- distributed Dreamworks SKG label, the departed heads of Warner’s three main labels would end up to- gether at MCA: previous Elektra head Bob Kras- now’s MCA imprint is already up and running, and this week, Doug Morris, ex-Atlantic co-chairman and WMG U.S. head, announced that he is setting up shop at MCA. Let’s hope their offices are on differ- ent floors. The return of SUPERFLY: CurtU May- field, who has not made an album since his paralyz- ing accident in 1990, has signed a new deal with Warner Bros. Among the producers working with the R&B great on the project will be Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Don Was, Narada Michael Walden, and Darryl Simmons. Mayfield is also slated to record a duet with Bon- nie Raitt. The album could be out as early as the first quarter of 1996. Mayfield has also made a cata- log deal with Rhino Records, which will release a three-CD boxed set of his material by the end of the year. As of now, there are no plans for any previously unreleased songs to appear on the collection. By the way, we erroneously referred to Solomon Burke’s guitarist Sam Mayfield as Curtis May- field’s nephew, as had been announced during a re- cent concert. It turns out that Sam and Curtis are not related; however, Sam is Percy Mayffeld’s second B LURRED VISION: British rock sensation Blur, which has not been able to get arrested in the U.S., has switched from EMI Records Group here to Vir- gin Records. The band’s Virgin debut will come out Sept 26. Virgin is making the rounds picking up art- ists for U.S. distribution whose recent albums have performed below expectations. For example, Virgin picked up David Bowie after his U.S. label, the mis- begotten Savage Records, went bankrupt. Bowie’s “Outside” will be released Sept. 26. He remains on BMG for the rest of the world. T his and THAT: Former MCA publicist Tom Cording is now Relativity’s senior director of media relations. Cording, who is based in New York, re- places Kerry Cooley, who will continue doing public- ity for the label from Seattle, but has relinquished her VP of media relation stripes. The rest of the staff remains the same: Amy Bloebaum and Van Riker, based in Los Angeles, are managers of media rela- tions, while director Grace Heck is stationed in the New York office. MCA has yet to name a replace- ment. 12 billboard JULY 22, 1995 Artists & Music Geffen’s Drhrin’ N’ Cryin’ Steers From Hard Rock To Folk Roots ■ BY CRAIG ROSEN Atlanta’s Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ is back on the folk rock road and on a new label after veering into hard rock territory on its last few albums. “Wrapped In Sky,” its first album in two years, is due Aug. 29 from Geffen. For Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ singer/guitarist Kevn Kinney, the move to Geffen of- fered the decade^ld band a chance to “return to square one.” After n^tiating out of its deal with Island. Kinney recorded his second solo album, 1994’s “Down Out Law’’ for Mammoth, while bassist Tim Nielsen produced an album by his neo-punk group Kathleen Turner Overdrive, and drummer Jeff Sullivan kept busy by producing demos for such acts as Toenut and Kramer. Following the outside projects, the band r^rouped and began soliciting a new label deal Geffen A&R executive Todd Sullivan, known for signing Weezer, was a longtime fan of the band. Says Kinney, ‘Todd seemed to have the best knowledge about what the band was about and where the band had orig- inally begun its trek and strayed off the trail into the heavy metal world. It was his goal to get us back.” Sullivan says, “Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ is an amazing band that has yet to make its best record. They have been focusing more on the ‘dnvin’ ’ side than the ‘cryin’ ’ side on the last couple of rec- ords, but even when they were in hard rock territory, they have a lot more depth than 99% of the other hard rock bands out there.” While Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ still rocks oc- casionally, “Wrapped In Sky” primarily has the band mining its folk rock and country rock roots. Geffen will preview the album with the upbeat ‘Tjeader The Follow,” which will be shipped to mod- em Todk, album rock, and tifiple-A radio on Aug. 15. Sullivan is optimistic that the latter format will embrace the band. *That could be the biggest format for DRIVIN' N' CRYIN’: Tim Nielsen. Kevn Kinney, and Jeff Sullivan. the band,” he says. “It didn’t exist for them in the past” Modem XTRA (91X) San Diego PD Mike Halloran says it may be the right time for Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ to get some overdue recognition, as several acts mining a similar style are receiving attention. “Kevn should be able to do something like Wilco, the Jayhawks, and the Bottle Rockets. There’s that whole new Americana thing happening, and that’s not a bad category to be lumped in with.” Even Kinney says that “the playing field is a lot more level now. When we were making records before, our con- temporaries on the charts were Rush and Bon Jovi. Now, there are a lot more young bands that are getting hits.” Yet Geffen and Dri^’ N’ Cryin’ face the challenge of luring back the band’s original fans who may have been put off by the band’s foray into hard rock. ‘The r^ fans rejected [‘Smoke’],” Sullivan says, referring to the band’s 1993 re- lease. “Now we have to go out there and find those fans again and start building it back frwn there.\" As Kinney explains, the band hit a low point on “Smoke” and on its subse- quent live dates. “Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ was dead in the water,” he says. “People didn’t understand what was going on with us. We toured with Lynyrd Sky- nyrd for a year, and people asked us how we could do that, but everyone we asked turned us down . . . They were the only ones that kept asking us.” Yet after the time off, Drivin’ N* Cryin’ has regained its focus. “We had such a long vacation, it’s fun to be with each other again,” says Kinney. For “Wrapped In Sky,\" Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ recruit^ producer John Porter. “He’s worked with a lot of different people,” Kinney notes, “from Velocity Girl and Budc^^ Guy to the Smiths and Tsg Mahal.” He also understood where Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ was coming from. “He had the most intelligent things to s^ about the songwriting, and he knows how to woric with the band and make everyone in the band feel like they have a say in things.” The band also turned to some friends for support. R£.M.’a Peter Buck, who product and played on Kinney’s first solo effort, 19W’s “MacDou^ Blues,” and joined Kinney on tour, is featured playing mandolin and dulcimer the album’s operang tracks, “Indian Song” and Tell^ Stories.” Says Kinney, “Peter had a break af- ter [R.E.M. drummer] Bill Berry’s acci- dent. so we called hiin and asked if he would come down.” Kinney says it was Buck who actually came up with a lick in “Indian Song\" dining the “MacDou- gal Blues” tour. Of R.E.M., Kinney says, ‘They’re the nicest bunch of rock stars in the world.” Also joining Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ in the studio was keyboard pl^er Joey Huffrnan, who has played with Soul A^lum, among others. The result is the band’s most focused album of its career. “We took chances by playing a lot of different types of music,” he s^. “And then people would say, We would love EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED FROM BOY GEORGE’S NEW VIRGIN SET (Continued from preceding page) “Contractually, George is obligated to do a certain amount of promotion for the book. Wherever we can, we’re going to piggyback onto that, but we also have our own plans.” Among the plans are a press tour in August and a concert tour in October. The press tour will occur just as the first single is sinking in at radio. Virgin is shipping a double-A-sided single, which contains a rollicking remake of the Stooges’ “Funtime” and the acous- tic, midtempo, pop-oriented “Same Thing In Reverse,” to radio on July 28. ‘The plan is to take ‘Funtime’ over to coll^ radio and alternative and then use ‘Same Thing In Reverse’ at triple- A and hot AC,” says Fox. “We're going to let the formats fight it out and see which tune wins, and then we’ll take that song to pop radio.\" The single will be commercially available Aug. 18. In England, dance mixes of many songs have been provided to clubs. George is one of England’s leading club DJs; however, Virgin has no plans to play to George’s club audience in the U.S. “There are no dance ranixes be- cause, [given] the strength and depth of the songs, we came to the decision to take that and run with it, ” says Fox. However, the many gay denizens who habituate the clubs will not be ne- glected in the marketing mix for George’s new album. “The gay audience is probably George’s core audience,” says Fox. “We have a very extensive advertising plan for the gay outlets.\" Marketing gambits targeted toward George’s gay fans are still being developed. Many of the album’s lyrics, including “Evil Is So Civilized,” “God Don’t Hold A Grudge,\" and “Same Thing In Re- verse,” deal with homosexual issues. Vii^ realizes that this may be a tough sell to the mainstream listener, but Fox says that such issues can’t be the label’s concern. “It’s 1995, and we can’t pi- geonhole an artist because of ivhat we think a lot of people will think,” he says. “We have to give him the freedom to say what he thinks. Then give It to the people and let than decide.” For George, it was simply a matter of writing what was in his heart. “I w'anted to make a record like this for a long time — a record that was sort of simple and traditional, but saying things clearly that were important to me. I’m talking for a lot of people in a way.” “Cheapness & Beauty” marks George’s fourth post-Culture Club ef- fort None of those records have made much of a dent in the U.S., although George scored a big hit on the BUlboaiti Hot 100 Singles chart in 1993 with the theme to the movie ‘The Crying Game.” “That gave George a re-«ner- gence in the ’90s that hopefully we’ll be able to build on,” says Fox. Regardless of the commercial suc- cess of the project, George says he’s also won a victorj' in pushing himself to a ne\\^' creative plateau. Oddb' eiK>u^, part of iriiat helped George reach the new level was some tough advice from another musical icon. “About a year ago, I had a meeting with Todd Rundgren about producing my next record. I didn’t like him too much as a person, but he made some in- teresting points— about my music and about me — which I found insulting at the time. He said, You have a great verse, and then you have a throw-away chorus.’ He said there was laziness in my work.” George walked away upset firom the meeting, but, he says, “v^en I thought about it, I realized that I am la:^. If you don’t sacrifice and take risk, \\riiat kind of life, do you have?” to play you on the radio, and we would love to write about you, but we don’t un- derstand why you are playing so many different types of music.’ ^ I said, ‘OK, I’ll make a folk record, and the band will make a rock record.’ We did that, and everybody went, ‘What happened?’ It was kind of like I couldn’t win. So I just took a break.” Now Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ has finally found the right balance. “I’ve figured it out,” Kinney says. ‘We've got a new record deal, and I made sure that we made a very cohesive record that has positive soigwriting, storytelling, a lit- tle bit of steam of consciousness. It’s got a lot of daylight and sunshine in it with a few hurricanes.” Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ hit the South with a month of dates in mid-May and started another monthlong minitour on July 10 to let its fans know' the band is back in action. A full U.S. tour will fol- low the album’s release. Kinney says he plans to spend a year and a half to two years on the road.

Wheel Caddy Sold Separately BILLBOARD JULY 22. 1995 13 Artists & Music Chilton’s ‘Missing’ Tape To Be Released By Ardent RANCID’S BRINGING OUT THE WOLVES’ ■ BY CARLO WOLFF Ardent Records is putting the finishing touches on an Alex Chil- ton album that is the missing link between the Box Tops and Big Star. Although a firm release date has not been set, the label is look- ing at early 1996. Tentatively titled “1969,” the 14-track project was recorded at Ardent Studios on National Street in Memphis in late 1969 and early 1970 following the demise of the Box Tops, the commercially suc- cessful group Chilton headed in the mid-’60s. According to Terry Manning, the veteran engineer who backed Chilton on the recording, the tapes were originally sent to sev- eral record companies, and a deal was struck with Atlantic Records for the album’s release. But Chilton was uncomfortable with certain aspects of the Atlan- tic agreement and decided to switch allegiance to Brother Rec- ords, the Beach Boys’ custom la- bel. Nothing came of either deal, however, and soon Chilton’s atten- tions switched to Big Star, the in- fluential power-pop group he formed in late 1970 with Chris Bell. The tapes were shelved. Over the years, a mono mix of the Chilton sessions circulated through the underground music scene, finally reaching Manning in the Bahamas in 1992 at Compass Point Studios, which he runs for Chris Blackwell. Manning con- tacted Ardent owner John Fry in an effort to locate the master tapes. The original eight-track tapes were found in good condition, and Manning was able to make final stereo mixes using recording equipment, echo devices, and ana- log delays prevalent at the time the tracks were laid down. Manning and Chilton decided to keep the tunes as authentic as pos- sible; there are no overdubs. The material is mostly Chilton origi- nals, but includes a cover of the Rolling Stones’ “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” and a medley featuring the Archies’ hit “Sugar, Sugar.” Chilton sings lead and harmony vocals and plays lead and rhythm guitar; Manning plays bass, key- boards, and synthesizer, sings harmony vocals, and does duet vo- cals on “Sugar, Sugar/I Got The Feelin’ ”; he also plays steel guitar and banjo. According to Ardent president John Fry, the label originally planned to release the album this fall, but it did not want to compete with “A Man Called Destruction,” the Ardent album Chilton re- leased in February. “Because of scheduling considerations, it’s probably going to be January,” Fry says. Furthermore, final mixes and artwork are yet to be done, says Natalie Morgan, who works in artist development at Ar- dent. (Contimted from page 12) gle. “We added that to [‘Let’s Go’] when retail demand dictated,” says Gurewitz. The single will ship two weeks be- fore the album’s release and will be worked heavily to modern rock ra- dio — and specifically to MTV — by indie promoters. Gurewitz acknowledges that MTV’s Buzz Bin rotation of the band’s “Salvation” video was a key factor in the success of “Let’s Go,” but he stops short of giving full credit to the channel. “Electronic media in general played a large part,” he says. “But it’s not the most important tool in our toolbox. The most important thing is the band’s willingness to tour and its ability to write songs with economy and pas- sion.” That ability has garnered the band increasing airplay on such modern rock outlets as WKQX Chi- cago, XTRA (91X) San Diego, and KROQ Los Angeles. “We played ‘Salvation’ for about three or four months because there was such a strong response,” says Lisa Worden, music director for KROQ. “I’ve heard the new album, and I hear a few songs that could be just as strong.” Despite the band’s success, its members have managed to avoid overthinking the group’s mission. “We don’t intellectualize about what we do,” says Frederiksen, shrugging. “We know how to do [it] just like plumbers know how to fix sinks.” The sound of “And Out Come The Wolves” seems to betray a certain disingenuousness on the guitarist’s part. The album, recorded in four weeks (as opposed to the four days spent on “Let’s Go”), is chockablock with irresistible anthems like “She’s Automatic” and the guttersnipe al- legory “Journey To The End Of The East Bay.” “In the past, you could have called Rancid a great punk band, but I think [this album] qualifies them as a great band,” says Jim Guerinot, who has managed the band since it left the team of Elliot Cahn and Jeff Saltzman last year. “It’s like the difference between the Clash’s first album and ‘London Calling.’ ” That promised progression isn’t entirely bluster. “And Out Come The Wolves” maintains the ener- getic, politically edgy stance of past Rancid releases while moving for- ward with vehicles such as a handful of ska numbers — like the impossi- bly catchy “Time Bomb” — that hark back to Armstrong and Free- man’s days in the seminal band Op- eration Ivy. Although most retailers have not heard the new album, they expect good things from the band given its past performance. “The first two records sold like crazy based on the band’s live repu- tation,” says Bob Say, head buyer for the Reseda, Calif.-based Moby Disc chain. “We sold 300-400 copies of ‘Let’s Go.’ I’d imagine the new one will sell twice that.” \"We continue to do well with Ran- cid’s last record, as well as a lot of the harder new punk stuff,” says Lloyd Hummel, buyer for the Tempe, Ariz.-based Zia Record Ex- change chain. “We’re definitely looking forward to the new release.” “Retail has always been very sup- portive,” Gurewitz adds. “We'll be meeting with head buyers one-on- one to play the record and remind them that we’re not prone to hyper- bole. The last record sold more than 400,000 copies — saying this will do better isn’t pulling anyone’s leg.” The label will push for strong placement at retail and will back that push with aggressive advertis- ing and a wide variety of point-of- purchase items that should capital- ize on Rancid’s distinctive visu^ im- age. Epitaph will also make concerted efforts to reach the fans directly, us- ing its mailing lists to send post- cards to those who’ve already shown interest in the band. “Once it explodes, as it did with Offspring, a record takes on a life of its own,” says Gurewitz. “But we’re prepared to get [Rancid] to that point on hard work.” Epitaph is currently readying its computer site on the Internet, and Gurewitz expects it to be ready in time for the American leg of Ran- cid’s first world tour. “We’re really excited to be get- ting to places like Japan and Aus- tralia,” says Frederiksen. “And to be getting back to some cities the right way. In the past, we’d play places that held 300 people, and 600 would show up. Too many Idds were getting sent home disappointed, which sucked. “Things have obviously changed, but I’d like to think we haven’t,” says the guitarist. “We’re not calcu- lating. Hell, I didn’t even know what an A&R person was until they starting introducing themselves to us last year.” f ^ % My Kind Of Group, Chicago la.

It is unclear how the recent activity on the new-label front will affect the record business designs of companies like Viacom and News Corp. In fact, some observers wonder whether the talent pool — both for artists and executives — is deep enough to support all the new start-ups. While some sources welcome new labels as places that provide opportunities for ex- ecutives to grow, they also say new bands and artists can be deprived of growth by being signed to deals too ear- ly in their careers. Sources liken the current explosion of labels as a replay of the situation of more than five years ago, when a new crop of labels sprung up. Most of them have struggled to survive. One record execu- tive says, “There was a whole shuffling around at that time, and it drove a lot of people’s prices up.” '^e latest label on the scene will be headed by Morris, the well-respected and successful record executive who was fired just weeks ago as chairman/CEO of Warner Music U.S. after disputes with his new boss Michael Fuchs (Billboard, July 1). Morris will be chairman/CEO of New York-based RisingTide Entertainment, which is fully financed by MCA Music and its new parent, Seagram. It is struc- tured as a worldwide joint venture be- tween Morris and MCA Records, which will handle back-office functions like business affairs and finance. The part- ners vnU share the profits 50-50. Morris says he expects to sign new and estab- lished pop, rock, R&B, and rap acts. A1 Teller, chairman of MCA Music Entertainment Group, saj^ there is “no pressure from us on setting a timetable” for new signings or releases by Rising Tide. Asserting that there will be “an ex- tremely sizable investment commit- ment” by MCA, Teller adds, “Doug’s ability to grow will not be hampered from the perspective of capital.” Esti- mates of MCA’s financial involvement range from $50 million-$100 million, but Teller declines to be specific. “We’ll be starting soon,” says Morris. “But I’m not in a hurry to run into this. It requires a lot of thought, and it re- quires the availability of great people. My role really is to develop a team of young executives who are going to have the opportunity to fly as high as their talents can take them.” WHO W1LU0IN MORRIS? There is speculation that some execu- tives from Warner Music may follow Morris. Warner Music U.S. Is expected to be disbanded soon, and sources say its remaining top executives — Mel Lewinter, Ina Meibach, and Ken Sun- shine — ^will join Rising Tide. Some sources think Danny (joldberg, chairman of Warner Bros. Records, could resign and help Morris run his new company, while others point out that he has a lucrative deal with Warner and that he might eventually land a big- ger role with the worldwide music group. Asked about hiring Warner ex- ecutives, Morris says, “Not if they’re un- der contract.\" Morris is suing Warner Music for breach of contract, charging that there was no cause for his dismissal. He is seeking more than $50 million — vi'hat he would have earned over the duration of the fi\\'e-year agreement Morris’ attor- ney Stanley Schlesinger says the “value of the contract is independent” of Morris’ new venture and that he is “proceeding” uith the suit Warner Music is e^q^ected to countersue (Billboard, July 15). TOUGH COMPETmON The question remains whether Rising Tide and other start-ups will be able to compete in the big-money sweepstakes that marks today’s music industry. Outside the Big Six record compa- nies, other players are poised to jump into the profit^le music business. But, as Val A^li, president of the Atlantic Group, says, “It’s going to cost them a lot of money to get in.” Viacom, now one of the laigest media and entertainment companies in the worid, plans to start rather than acquire a label. A spokesman says an intendivi- sional company task force — made up of Viacom units MTV Networks, Para- mount Communications, and Block- buster Entertainment — is exploring the formation of a label. Viacom declines to confirm the speculation that it had talked to Morris about a deal. News Corp., Rupert Murdoch’s me- dia and entertainment colossus, is also said to be considering greater presence in the music business. It operates a joint venture. Fox Records, with BMG, but that is principally for soundtracks to Fox films and TV shows. Walt Disney Co. is also said to be in the market to expand its record inter- ests. It ow-ns Walt Disney Records, the most successful independent label of re- cent years, with its soundtrack albums for Disney’s animated films. The Disney Co. also operates Hollywood Records, a pop and rock label Hollywood was part of the label-start- up story five years ago. Under Peter Pa- temo, it never achieved hoped-for suc- cess, proving that having big-company backing does not guarantee a winner. But Hollywood has undergone m^or changes in the past year, leading some observ'ers to view it as practically a new label. All its department heads were re- placed, a new worldwide distribution deal with PolyGram is in place, and a host of new acts has been signed. Last month, MCA announced anoth- er joint venture with a veteran record man when it agreed to provide disbibu- tion and other services through (^ffen Records to the DreamWorks and SKG labels begun by David (Jeffen. Geffen’s first signing is said to be George Michael, who has negotiated an end to his contract with Sony Music (see story, page 1). The multimillion-dollar Michael deal is an exemplar of the kind of artist trans- action that could become commonplace with so many new labels, executives say. Speaking under condition of anonymity, they say there are not enough great new acts to support the needs of so many companies. Many observers believe the new labels will need high-profile sign- ings like Michael to make a quick name for themselves and attract new' acts. Some executives foresee bidding wars for acts whose contracts expire at the end of 1996. One source expects the new label heads to count on past relation- ships with artists to bolster their rosters. But Azzoli says a strategy of signing big acts might backfire. “What if that high-profile artist doesn’t sell? You can sign 10 bands for that cost. And maybe tw'o or three of them will work.” On the other hand, the race to sign the hottest new bands has its draw- backs, too. Bob Pfeifer, president of the revamped HoUyw'ood, “What hap- pens is bandis get signed too soon. Ulti- mately it hurts the artists, especially when the record company that woos you may not be around next year. It takes time to develop bands.” MCA also has a deal to provide fi- nancing, marketing, promotion, and dis- tribution services to Krasnow Enter- tainment, the label begun by former Elektra Entertainment chief Robert Krasnow, the highly regarded music ex- ecutive who resigned from Warner Mu- sic Group last year (ironically, after Morris w'as named to head the new do- mestic unit of the company). Krasnow has released one recor^g so far. The speed at which MCA grabbed ex- Wamer Music chieftains Morris and Krasnow has led some observers to speculate that former Warner Bros. Records chairman Mo Ostin will be the next to join the MCA family, perhaps heading the DreamWorics and SKG la- bels for Geffen and his partners. The companies declined comment, and Ostin was unavailable at press time. DEMAND FOR A&R TALENT No matter who heads the labels, they need talented A&R executives in order to sign acts. Established major labels, in order to keep their own executives from jumping to the start-ups, may have to offer them more in-house imprints. At Atlantic, A&R executive Jason Flom w’as rewarded with"
