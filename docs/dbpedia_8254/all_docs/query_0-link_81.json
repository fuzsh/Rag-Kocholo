        "text": "WARSAW — Piotr Bernatowicz is one of the most talked about figures in Poland’s art world this winter, for one reason: Many artists say he’s about to destroy a leading Warsaw art museum.\n\nOn Jan. 1, Mr. Bernatowicz, 46, became the director of the Ujazdowski Castle Center for Contemporary Art, a reconstructed palace in the city center. For the past 30 years, the museum has put on shows by Poland’s leading experimental artists, and hosted work by international stars like Barbara Kruger, Nan Goldin and Kara Walker.\n\nIts exhibitions have often had a political dimension. One current show, for instance — a retrospective of work by Karol Radziszewski (through Mar. 29) — addresses the experiences of gay men in Eastern Europe.\n\nMr. Bernatowicz is interested in politics, but those politics are different from many in the art world, which he said in an email interview was “dominated by a left-wing, precisely neo-Marxist ideology.” (He declined to be interviewed in person.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
