        "text": "Softpanorama\n\nMay the source be with you, but remember the KISS principle ;-) Home Switchboard Unix Administration Red Hat TCP/IP Networks Neoliberalism Toxic Managers (slightly skeptical) Educational society promoting \"Back to basics\" movement against IT overcomplexity and bastardization of classic Unix\n\nSlightly skeptical view of modern cars and their engines\n\nNews Recommended Links Tesla Toyota RAV4 2019 Hybrid Toyota RAV4 2016 Hybrid Mitsubishi Outlander 2006 Toyota Rent a Car Honda CR-V - Wikipedia Available Honda CR-V in Tri State Area Honda CR-V vs. Toyota RAV4 Which Should You Buy - Consumer Reports 2019 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid vs. 2019 Honda CR-V Forrester SUV 2017 Mitsubishi Galant 2003 Notes on buying a car vs. leasing it Light replacement in Outlander 2003-2006 Humor Etc\n\nModern cars suffer from overcomplexity. Many subsystems became way too complex. Amount of electronics used further increases complexity and actually cuts private mechanics from the business. The more complex the car is, the less reliable it is . So luxury models paradoxically can have a lot of problems as they are oversaturated with electronics. Of course, you get a free loaner vehicle with the dealership, but still moving all your belonging from one car to another is a frustrating exercise.\n\nIt's tough as there way too much variety on the marketplace and too much competition for what, in essence, are almost identical sedans, or small SUVs.\n\nSome interesting development the last year are \"driver support\" systems like Subaru EyeSight version 3.\n\nConfiguration of a car is another problem. For example I prefer to have a weather package (heated mirrors, heater seats, front defroster, if available and fog lights. I also prefer cloth seats. I do not want to pay for leather and the sunroof. But strangely enough it is difficult to get that set of options, and if you you often get sunroof as a present from the vendor, which I do not need. Not all people who are willing to pay more for the vehicle appreciate sunroof :-). It actually makes roof less stable at crash. That's a problem.\n\nAdaptive cruse control make great sense for long rides. Which is probably the main thing I am exited about Forrester, as drive quality wise it is close to Mitsubishi Outlander 2006. Not bad, but nothing special. Same with the acceleration up the hill. Crosstrek is more sexy but is sluggish in this department, so complains on web sites are not without merit. I am not too exited about CR-V and think you have a better SUV overall, despite Edmunds and Kelly ratings. The way Forrester engine compartment is structured looks better for me. It's tight but all the necessary spots are easily accessible. Also Honda car engines rotate in the wrong direction :-)\n\nAutomakers frequently change vehicle designs as the Environmental Protection Agency raises fuel-efficiency standards. They are increasingly using lighter materials like aluminum and high-strength metals like ultra-hard boron steel, particularly in the frame and suspension parts. Such parts are expensive.\n\nAs GM faulty ignition switch story tell us there is no guarantee. You can get into troubles, even for a model that is produced for many years. They knew about faulty switch for more then 10 years and more then a dozen peoples died due to this defect. See News section.\n\nToo much emphasis on fuel economy is not good. Weight of the car is a safety feature and it affects fuel economy. Generally if you want excellent fuel economy you need to buy a small car. Let's say the size of Corolla or Civic, or smaller. Such cars are dangerous on modern highway as frontal collision with a heavier car (say, mid size SUV or light truck) gives you very little chances of survival.\n\nHybrid cars look promising but they are more expensive and this additional expence eats all fuel economy unless average for the life of the car prices are, say, above $3.5 a gallon.\n\nElectrical car represent another set of problem:\n\nBattery is like another passenger who is always in your car. Lithium battery is a dangerous passenger to ride with, more like like a bomb you are driving with.\n\nDifference in price is such that essentially you just paying all your fuel savings up-front if gas prices stay below $4 per gallon.\n\nWhat if oil prices drop during the lifespan of the car like happened in 2014-2016.\n\nCVT Transmissions\n\nCVT tranmissions displayed convetional gearboxes almost completely. And the reson is is fuel economy.\n\nNEWS CONTENTS\n\n20210721 : Damage Control- Elon Musk Admits Cybertruck Could -Flop-, Writes Off Summon Feature As Just A -Fun Trick- - ZeroHedge ( Jul 18, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210720 : Damage Control- Elon Musk Admits Cybertruck Could -Flop-, Writes Off Summon Feature As Just A -Fun Trick- - ZeroHedge ( Jul 18, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210703 : Bolshevik volutarism in XXI century: Canada To Ban Sale of New Fuel-Powered Cars and Light Trucks From 2035 ( Jul 03, 2021 , news.slashdot.org )\n\n20210612 : New Renewable Fuel Might be 3 Times More Powerful Than Gasoline ( Jun 07, 2021 , finance.yahoo.com )\n\n20210607 : New Renewable Fuel Might be 3 Times More Powerful Than Gasoline ( Jun 07, 2021 , finance.yahoo.com )\n\n20210528 : The US Is Not Ready For An All-Electric Future - ZeroHedge ( May 20, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210528 : \"Not a chance' Tesla will dominate car industry in 20 years- legendary investor Bruce Greenwald ( May 26, 2021 , finance.yahoo.com )\n\n20210514 : Autopilot Was Engaged In Fatal SoCal Tesla Wreck Earlier This Month, Authorities Reveal ( May 14, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210509 : German Institute Develops 'Powerpaste' That Stores Hydrogen Energy At 10x the Density of a Lithium Battery ( May 09, 2021 , hardware.slashdot.org )\n\n20210508 : What's Behind the WTF Spike in Used-Vehicle Prices- My Gut Says, it Can't Last.

Birthday boy Elon Musk's most controversial quotes\n\nme scrolling=\n\nThe walk back of history began with a mega-huge whopper about 2 weeks ago when, at the beginning of July, Musk admitted that Full-Self Driving - a non-existent feature customers have been paying for for a half-decade - was a \"hard problem\", casually dropping into conversation the idea that the company may not be anywhere close to meeting Musk's promises about FSD.\n\nAs a reminder, Musk said in 2019 he was \"very confident\" in predicting autonomous robotaxis \"next year\", which would have been 2020, which has now turned into \"last year\" and is six months away from being \"two years ago\".

Reuters reports: Only zero-emissions cars and trucks can be sold from 2035, according to a statement, adding that a mixture of investments and regulations will help industry transition toward that goal. The government also said it will set interim targets for 2025 and 2030. \"We are committed to aligning Canada's zero-emission vehicles sales targets with those of the most ambitious North American jurisdictions,\" Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said in the statement. \"We will work with the United States to harmonize fuel efficiency regulations and we're investing in consumer rebates, charging stations, business tax breaks and industry transition costs,\" Wilkinson added.\n\n\"Canada cannot reach our greenhouse gas targets if emissions from cars, SUVs and pickups, which are currently growing, are not curtailed,\" said Keith Brooks, programs director at advocacy group Environmental Defence, who welcomed the move.

The cost of installing electric charging stations on these roads would be insurmountable. You're talking about tens , if not hundreds of thousands of kilometres of new high-tension power lines. We just wouldn't be able to put charging stations far enough out to make this feasible. So, sure, the vast majority of cars could be electric by 2035, not all of them can be.

Instead of burning half-hydrogen, half carbon, the power company energy comes entirely from carbon, and loses about 10-15% of that power in the lines themselves. Sure, your power company *might* be using a renewable energy source, but if they're not, your electric car is actually worse for the planet than a conventional ICE powered vehicle.\n\nBanning fuel powered vehicles is not the way to go.

The crash is still is under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a report from ABC noted on Friday.\n\nThe crash, which took place on May 5 in Fontana, killed the 35 year old driver after his Model 3 hit an overturned semi on the freeway. A second person was seriously injured after the Model 3 hit him, while he was trying to help the driver of the overturned semi.\n\nOn Thursday of this week, the California Highway Patrol announced that the car was operating on Autopilot, which has been no stranger to controversy involving fatal Tesla wrecks. This wreck marks at least the fourth death in the U.S. involving Autopilot.\n\nThe information was so important, the CHP felt, that they shared it despite the ongoing investigation, stating: \"While the CHP does not normally comment on ongoing investigations, the Department recognizes the high level of interest centered around crashes involving Tesla vehicles. We felt this information provides an opportunity to remind the public that driving is a complex task that requires a driver's full attention.\"\n\nJust days prior, the CHP arrested yet another Tesla driver who it said was in the back seat of his vehicle while it barreled down Interstate 80 near Oakland. Autopilot or Full Self Driving were assumed to be operating.\n\nThere is also an ongoing NHTSA investigation involving a fatal Tesla wreck that took place in Houston weeks ago. The NTSB has issued a preliminary report in that case, finding that a similar vehicle could have engaged Traffic Aware Cruise Control, but not Autosteer, at the point where the crash took place.\n\nThe NTSB concluded by stating that the investigation was ongoing and that it was working with Harris County Texas Precinct 4:\n\nThe NTSB continues to collect data to analyze the crash dynamics, postmortem toxicology test results, seat belt use, occupant egress, and electric vehicle fires. All aspects of the crash remain under investigation as the NTSB determines the probable cause, with the intent of issuing safety recommendations to prevent similar crashes. The NTSB is working alongside the Harris County Texas Precinct 4 Constable's Office, which is conducting a separate, parallel investigation.\n\nRecall, it was Mark Herman, Harris County Constable Precinct 4, who was most skeptical of Elon Musk's comments absolving Autopilot of liability last month, telling Reuters that the police served search warrants on Tesla to secure data from the Model S.\n\nResponding to Musk at the time, Herman said: \"If he is tweeting that out, if he has already pulled the data, he hasn't told us that. We will eagerly wait for that data.\"\n\n\"We have witness statements from people that said they left to test drive the vehicle without a driver and to show the friend how it can drive itself ,\" Herman said according to the Reuters report .\n\n[May 09, 2021] German Institute Develops 'Powerpaste' That Stores Hydrogen Energy At 10x the Density of a Lithium Battery\n\nMay 09, 2021 | hardware.slashdot.org\n\n(hackaday.com) 124 BeauHD on Monday February 08, 2021 @10:10PM from the clean-energy dept. A German research organization has developed a magnesium-based \" Powerpaste \" with an energy density ten times more than current battery technology . Hackaday reports: We've been promised hydrogen-powered engines for some time now. One downside though is the need for hydrogen vehicles to have heavy high-pressure tanks. While a 700 bar tank and the accompanying fuel cell is acceptable for a city bus or a truck, it becomes problematic with smaller vehicles, especially ones such as scooters or even full-sized motorcycles. The Fraunhofer Institute wants to run smaller vehicles on magnesium hydride in a paste form that they call POWERPASTE.\n\nThe idea is that the paste effectively stores hydrogen at normal temperature and pressure. At 250C, the paste decomposes and releases its hydrogen. While your motorcycle may seem hot when parked in the sun, it isn't getting quite to 250C. Interestingly, the paste only provides half the available hydrogen. The rest is from water added start a reaction to release the hydrogen. Fraunhofer claims the energy density available is greater than that of a 700 bar tank in a conventional hydrogen system and ten times more than current battery technology.\n\nOne thing that's attractive is that the paste is easy to store and pump. A gas station, for example, could invest $20-30,000 and dispense the paste from a metal drum to meet low demand and then scale up as needed. A hydrogen pumping setup starts at about $1.2 million. Fraunhofer is building a pilot production plant that will produce about four tons of the material a year.\n\n[May 08, 2021] What's Behind the WTF Spike in Used-Vehicle Prices- My Gut Says, it Can't Last.

New cars are generally safer than older cars. However, that doesn't make a person driving an old car stupid, nor does it make someone who drives a new car smart.\n\nIt's all a matter of risk acceptance, and that is very personal. I drive an old car that lacks lots of safety features. A also ride a powerful motorbike. Given this, would it not be a tiny bit weird if I insisted on the newest, safest car around while also using a two-wheeled means of transport that is orders of magnitude more dangerous than the oldest clunker of a car?\n\nOf course, being a careful and capable driver doesn't guarantee you'll never end up in a serious accident.

Exactly why they didn't use the public stalls was not specified.\n\nEVs have come a long way in recent years in terms of range, safety, comfort, and tech features, but Hardman and Tal note that very little has changed in terms of how they are recharged.\n\nThe researchers warned that this trend could make it harder to achieve electric vehicle sales targets in California and other countries, and the growth of the market overall.\n\n[Apr 22, 2021] Congressmen, Consumer Reports Raise Concerns Over Tesla's Autopilot\n\nApr 22, 2021 | www.wsj.com\n\nTwo U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla Inc. TSLA -3.28% vehicles in the wake of a fatal crash in Texas.\n\nIn a letter Thursday to America's top automotive-safety regulator, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts urged the agency to develop recommendations for improving advanced driver-assistance systems such as Tesla's Autopilot.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a probe into the weekend crash , one of more than two dozen investigations it has launched into Tesla-involved crashes. The agency has said that most of those investigations are related to the vehicles' advanced driver-assistance features.\n\n\"We fear safety concerns involving these vehicles are becoming a pattern, which is incredibly worrisome and deserves your undivided attention,\" the Democratic senators wrote about Tesla in the letter, which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n... ... ...\n\nConsumer Reports on Thursday said it had done tests this week in which it was able to get a different Tesla model's Autopilot to operate without anyone in the driver's seat. The vehicle, which uses steering-wheel inputs to assess driver attention, didn't send any warnings about an empty driver's seat, Consumer Reports said. The organization attached a weight to a Model Y's steering wheel to simulate a hand during the testing.\n\n\"I was really shocked how easy it was to do it,\" said Jake Fisher, the group's senior director of auto testing, one of the people involved in the test-track experiment. \"When you have an automation system like that which explicitly needs a driver to be ready to take over at any time, you have to make sure that someone is actually engaged.\"\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the Consumer Reports finding.\n\n[Mar 12, 2021] I am looking forward to seeing the mental gymanstics required to promote electric transportation despite the chronic shortage of raw materials required for batteries\n\nMar 12, 2021 | www.nakedcapitalism.com\n\nEquitable > Equal , March 12, 2021 at 8:56 am\n\n[Feb 05, 2021] The \"Battery Fairy\" Other Delusions In The Race To Replace Gas-Powered Cars\n\nFeb 05, 2021 | www.zerohedge.com\n\nAuthored by Thomas Lifson via AmericanThinker.com,\n\nI continue to be amazed that serious people think that gasoline powered vehicles can be completely replaced by electric vehicles in a decade-and-a-half, and that this would be a good thing, even if possible. Under threat of government action, however, the world's major auto manufacturers are falling in line boosting production of plug-in models, and upstart Tesla Motors is now the world's most valuable auto manufacture, based on the value of its capital stock issued and in the public's hands. Mary T. Barra, CEO of General Motors, has pledged to sell only zero emission vehicles by 2035 . That would meet the deadline imposed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who signed an executive order banning the sale of internal combustion vehicles in the nation's largest car market by 2035.\n\nCharging electrric cars at work makes sense, as it rquires several hours. But what if you want to drive on a long trip? Photo credit: Felix Cramer CC-BY-SA 2.0 license\n\nGM, rescued from liquidation courtesy of US taxpayers (and bondholders who were cheated out of their place in line as creditors by the Obama administration), may simply be sucking up to governmental power. But Akio Toyoda, CEO of Toyota Motors, the world's largest (or second largest, depending on the year). and grandson of the automaker's founder, has spoken out and called out fallacy of thinking that this is possible or desirable. [I must here disclose that I was a consultant for a Toyota company for several years, but that all my comments on the company here are based on publicly available information.]\n\nAccording to this account in CarBuzz :\n\nAs the grandson of Toyota founder, Kiichiro Toyoda, the scion was raised surrounded by all aspects of the auto industry and his business acumen is second to none. So when he had some harsh words for electric vehicles at the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association end-of-year press conference last week, people took notice.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was in attendance and noted the CEO's disdain for EVs boils down to his belief they'll ruin businesses, require massive investments, and even emit more carbon dioxide than combustion-engined vehicles. \"The current business model of the car industry is going to collapse,\" he said. \"The more EVs we build, the worse carbon dioxide gets When politicians are out there saying, 'Let's get rid of all cars using gasoline,' do they understand this?\"\n\nStudies detailing the carbon emissions necessary to manufacture an electric vehicle reveal that on a net basis, there are more emissions for vehicle bought and used for its expected lifetime, than would be generated by buying and using a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle.\n\nToyota can certainly make electric powered vehicles. It introduced the hybrid Prius, after all, and has a strong position in that market. Toyota's mastery of the discipline of mass production of vehicles is such that it could do well no matter what power source is used. But the costs of complete conversion to electricity-powered vehicles are mind boggling.\n\nWhere will all, the electricity needed to power to entire fleet of cars in the US (or Japan) come from? Despite the fantasies of greenies, it won't be from windmills or solar farms. They are too unreliable, take up too much land, and cost too much. Right now, it is coal and natural gas that produce the most electricity at the most reasonable cost. And they emit CO2. Plus, there is considerable loss of power due to resistance in the transmission lines, requiring an even greater amount of gross power before the net power reaches the battery in the vehicle, charging at the user's home ort some other location. Nuclear power does offer some potential, but how many people want to live near the hundreds and hundreds of nuclear power plants that would be required to fuel the nation's vehicles?\n\nThen there is the small matter of batteries. The very large batteries needed for electric cars use lots of expensive lithium (and some other rare elements) whose supply is limited, and whose mining requires lots of scarce water. In fact, powering the world's vehicles by battery is simply impossible, given the limited world supply of lithium, as this clever post by Powerline's Steve Hayward makes clear. The title gives away the punchline:\n\nWHO WILL TELL THE GREENS THERE IS NO BATTERY FAIRY?\n\nFor the longest while I have been asking, \"Where do environmentalists and Democrats think all these batteries for our oil-free transportation fleet are going to come from?\" It seems they think there is a Battery Fairy out there somewhere who will magically supply the ginormous battery capacity, and additional supply of electricity to charge them, in order to deliver us to our blessed fossil-fuel-free future.\n\nHe cites an article in Wired, The Spiraling Environmental Cost of our Lithium Battery Addiction :\n\nBut there's a problem. As the world scrambles to replace fossil fuels with clean energy, the environmental impact of finding all the lithium required to enable that transformation could become a serious issue in its own right. \"One of the biggest environmental problems caused by our endless hunger for the latest and smartest devices is a growing mineral crisis, particularly those needed to make our batteries,\" says Christina Valimaki an analyst at Elsevier. . .\n\nIt's a relatively cheap and effective process, but it uses a lot of water – approximately 500,000 gallons per tonne of lithium. In Chile's Salar de Atacama, mining activities consumed 65 per cent of the region's water. That is having a big impact on local farmers – who grow quinoa and herd llamas – in an area where some communities already have to get water driven in from elsewhere. . .\n\nTwo other key ingredients, cobalt and nickel, are more in danger of creating a bottleneck in the move towards electric vehicles, and at a potentially huge environmental cost. Cobalt is found in huge quantities right across the Democratic Republic of Congo and central Africa, and hardly anywhere else. The price has quadrupled in the last two years.\n\nI am glad that some grownups are pointing out that the electric vehicle conversion emperor has no clothes on. But that hasn't stopped governments, manufacturers, and investors from pretending that electric vehicles are our only future.\n\nAs Herbert Stein famously said, \"If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\" We're only beginning to discover that about pipe dreams of an all-electric vehicle future.\n\n[Jan 27, 2021] Are EVs Good For The Environment- ...Mostly Not\n\nJan 27, 2021 | www.zerohedge.com\n\nAs to whether EVs are as environmentally friendly as many people claim is a topic that is hotly debated. The chart near the top of this article screams that they are not. Electricity demand is still rising across the world, most nuclear plants getting very old, and the most ecologically friendly sources are running full out. This means the slack is being taken up by fossil-fuel generated plants. Under the idea of, last in first out, this would mean that almost all the juice being pumped into EVs comes from fossil-fuel generated juice. To make matters worse, other issues exist.\n\nBelow are a few comments, or parts of comments, about EVs that have been gathered from different recent articles. I have not fully researched all these but they do add to my doubts about these vehicles.\n\nThe Greenwashing Industrial Complex is one of the evilest and fraudulent scams of the 21st century. As an example, the pollution and environmental destruction created by the manufacturing and disposal of EV batteries, and also the magnets for power-generating windmills, is 10X worse than pollution created by fossil-fuel vehicles.\n\nIn Germany about 40% of the energy mix is produced by coal and 30% by renewables - a mid-sized electric car must be driven for 125,000 km , on average, to break even with a diesel car, and 60,000 km compared to a petrol car. It takes nine years for an electric car to be greener than a diesel car, assuming an annual average mileage of 13,500 km. Most consumers will have bought a new car by then. The case is similar in the U.S. but less pronounced in nuclear-powered France .\n\nBattery production causes more environmental damage than carbon emissions alone. Consider dust, fumes, wastewater, and other environmental impacts from cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; water shortages and toxic spills from lithium mining in Latin America, which can alter ecosystems and hurt local communities; a heavily polluted river due to nickel mining in Russia; or air pollution in northeastern China, as mentioned above.\n\nThere isn't enough cobalt in the world to replace even half of the current ICE vehicles. Never mind the fact they have kids mining the stuff in the Congo. InsideSources , says, every EV battery contains cobalt, with most of it mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This area has been an ugly mess for years as the Congo government and armed militants duke it out over the control of mines. Much of the DRC cobalt is then hauled to South Africa and shipped to China for processing.\n\nAlso flowing into the issue of \" less damaging to the environment\" is something recently brought to my attention, and that is, EVs tend to rapidly eat through tires. While many people may not think this is a big deal, it is. Since electric car batteries are heavier than petrol engines they need a more robust tire. Also, because of their accelerating faster from a standstill. If you want to take advantage of that without too much wear then you need a more robust tire, these cost more, and it has been said, you are lucky if you get 20,000 miles out of a set of tires. All this is addressed at, https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-electric-cars-wear-out-tires-faster-than-fossil-fuel-cars\n\nPollution From Tires Is A Growing EV Issue\n\nLike many people I had forgotten or brushed aside the thought something as simple and common as the tire was such a problem. This should have been high on my radar because years ago I was given a building simply because it had been filled with tires. The officials in my city were all over the owner to get rid of them. It cost me a bit of money and a lot of work to have them hauled away and properly recycled. With that in mind, below are a few of the many articles voicing pollution issues concerning tires.\n\nHomeguides.sfgate.com claims; Toxins released from tire decomposition, incineration, or accidental fires can pollute the water, air, and soil. While 42 states regulate tire disposal to some degree, eight states have no restrictions on what you must do with your discarded tires. Even with laws in place, illegal dumping still occurs, presenting negative environmental impacts.\n\nTiretechnologyinternational.com states; Air pollution from tire wear particles can be 1,000 times worse than what comes out of a car's exhaust, Emissions Analytics found harmful particle matter from tires is a serious environmental problem. What is even more frightening is that while exhaust emissions have been tightly regulated for many years, tire wear is not. With the increasing growth in sales of heavier SUVs and battery-powered electric cars, non-exhaust emissions are a growing problem.\n\nAnd, www.politico.eu/article/tires , delves into how driving affects the environment in ways beyond the well-known pollutants spewing from tailpipes and leaking from engines. Tires shed tiny pieces of plastic as they wear down, accounting for about 10 percent of the microscopic pieces of the pollutant found in the sea, according to one estimate. Tire waste was addressed in the European Commission's Plastics Strategy earlier this year. The EU executive is looking into how to cut down on microplastics that may be coming from tires and is considering regulations.\n\nWith all the above in mind, the buzz in EV trading over the last couple of weeks has interestingly been surrounding legacy automakers like General Motors and, even Ford moving strongly in the direction of manufacturing more EVs. This may someday be seen as a huge environmental misstep. The best answer may be a shift to more efficient gasoline engines in smaller vehicles. 4,675 20 NE play_arrow\n\nthezone 20 minutes ago (Edited)\n\nHere in California the electric grid is near collapse.

And it is a biggie.\n\nThe electricity required to power all the EVs in the world is much higher than what we use now. And since natural gas is frowned upon, the extra generating capacity is even higher. An electric cooktop is 8000 watts, your EV charger is about 9000 watts for the small ones.\n\nTherefore, the entire electrical grid would need to be replaced to have enough capacity to feed all these new electrical requirements.\n\nYouri Carma 17 minutes ago (Edited) remove link\n\nThen there is the issue of energy transition loss.\n\n1.

Time to invest in a working BCP plan tesla,\" Kevin Taylor wrote.\n\n\"How can the most valuable car company in the world not have the backup support for a problem like this?\" another commenter asked, adding \"This shouldn't be down for more than an hour.\"\n\nOthers went on to accuse Tesla, which is yet to comment on the issue, of leaving its customers in the dark about the global tech failure.\n\n\"I'm stranded as I don't have the key card with me and need to enable driving with my phone. I cannot believe there is no announcement from tesla on what the time frame is we are looking at for them to be back online,\" a disgruntled driver wrote.\n\nALSO ON RT.COM Can Tesla live up to its $400 billion valuation?\n\nThe glitch has apparently prompted some would-be Tesla owners to doubt the wisdom of investing in the high-dollar electric cars.\n\n\"I am supposed to pick up my Tesla today, and they told me [the] system was down while I was on uber, damn it! I have a second thought now,\" LukeY wrote.\n\nWhile Tesla owners were impatiently waiting for the phone app to spring back to life, pundits on Twitter cast their woes as a prime example of the modern over-reliance on tech.\n\n[Jul 05, 2020] 2021 Toyota RAV4 Prime- First Drive\n\nJul 05, 2020 | www.msn.com\n\n2021 Toyota RAV4 Prime\n\n[Jul 05, 2020] 2021 Toyota Venza- First Look\n\nJul 05, 2020 | www.msn.com\n\nLatest Crossover\n\n[Jul 05, 2020] 2020 Honda CR-V Hybrid Points to CR-V's Future\n\nJul 05, 2020 | www.msn.com\n\nThe CR-V is Honda's first hybrid to have all-wheel drive. Unlike Toyota's hybrid all-wheel-drive system that puts an electric motor in the rear end to assist the otherwise front-drive RAV4, the CR-V uses the same system that's in the non-hybrid. Which is to say there is a clutch that engages the rear axle when the stability-control system detects slippage or when sending torque to the rear axle is otherwise advantageous, such as ascending a steep grade.\n\nHonda has also tweaked the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-four. This Atkinson-cycle engine uses the same higher compression ratio setup as the Accord Hybrid (13.5:1) and a new exhaust-gas recirculation system. The system's combined outputs of 212 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque are the same as the Accord hybrid, too. The hybrid could be considered a performance version since it makes more power than the 190 horsepower and 179 lb-ft you get from the CR-V's turbocharged 1.5-liter four. For comparison purposes, the RAV4 Hybrid makes 219 horsepower and the Ford Escape hybrid has 209 ponies.\n\n[Dec 30, 2019] Another Fatal Wreck Two Dead After Tesla Runs Red Light, Slams Into Vehicle Near LA\n\nDec 30, 2019 | www.zerohedge.com\n\nAnother day, yet another Tesla wreck.\n\nIt was just hours ago that we highlighted a wreck where a Tesla slammed into the back of (yet another) inanimate fire truck.\n\nAnd yet again, here we are with another \"peculiar\" sounding Tesla accident. This one involving a Tesla that ran a red light near Los Angeles, California and slammed into another vehicle on Sunday, killing two people.\n\nAccording to KTLA 5 , the incident took place at Vermont Ave and Artesia Blvd. on Sunday. The driver of the 2016 Tesla exited the westbound 91 freeway \"at a high speed\" and then failed to stop at a red light at the next intersection. As a result, he slammed into a 2006 Honda Civic at the light.\n\n[Dec 29, 2019] Shocking Photos Two Seriously Injured After Tesla Slams Into Parked Firetruck (Again)\n\nPeople trust Tesla autopilot way to much. The name is unformtunate too.\n\nDec 29, 2019 | www.zerohedge.com\n\nTwo vehicle occupants have been seriously injured after a Tesla slammed into the back of a Cloverdale Township Volunteer Fire Department Truck early Sunday morning. According to the Greencastle Banner-Graphic , the accident took place in Cloverdale, IN.\n\nThe fire truck was in the eastbound lands of the interstate, responding to an earlier wreck, when a Tesla ran into the rear of the truck, causing \"heavy damage\" to both.\n\nReports from the scene indicated that both the driver and the passenger were unconscious and trapped. There is no word yet on whether or not Autopilot played a role in the accident.\n\nBoth occupants were extricated from the vehicle and the Indiana State Police said that the accident involved \"serious personal injury.\"\n\nRecall, this is not the first time a Tesla has slammed into the back of an inanimate fire truck. In 2018, an accident occurred when a driver smashed into the back of a fire truck in Southern California. That driver was found to have been \"looking down\" at \"what appeared to be a mobile phone\" while the car's Autopilot was engaged, according to Bloomberg .\n\n[Oct 20, 2019] Smaller SUV's are compact or subcompact cars with box bodies\n\nOct 20, 2019 | www.nakedcapitalism.com\n\nSmaller SUV's have been described as just a way to make a minivan look masculine. In other words they're compact or subcompact cars with box bodies. Fuel efficiency is not much different than my older subcompact 3-door which gets around 31mpg. Huge SUV's on truck bodies are a different story of course, but those aren't so popular.\n\nlikbez , October 20, 2019 at 1:53 am\n\n2019 model of Toyota RAV 4 hybrid SUV gets over 40 miles (41-43) per gallon (more if you use higher tire pressure, say, 4.0 PSI)\n\nconverger , October 19, 2019 at 8:07 pm\n\nYes. SUV's are a serious problem. Most people don't need them (the flood of two-wheel drive SUV's tells you everything that you need to know). They aren't any safer (the evidence is clear: nimble small cars are better at avoiding accidents than clumsy big SUV's). They represent massive, carbon spewing overkill, in a society that really doesn't care much about the future of human civilization. Trump is just making it worse.\n\nThat said, though there's been an uptick recently, the basic issue has been around for 20 years now. The reality is a little more nuanced:\n\nFirst, if you ignore the overkill factor, the biggest SUV and pickup truck pigs are actually not bad for their size. Many of them have genuinely interesting advanced features (e.g. shutting down unneeded cylinders if the extra power isn't required) that haven't trickled down to smaller SUV's and affordable cars yet.\n\nSecond, there's a significant efficiency and economic benefit to people who buy smaller, more efficient cars, *if* mileage standards are enforced.\n\nEfficiency standards are based on a fleet average (SUV's up to gigantic are included in the fleet average calculation, pickup trucks, unfortunately are not). Most SUV's have a high enough profit margin to justify subsidizing smaller, more efficient cars.\n\nThe effect is that more efficient cars (including smaller hybrids) are more affordable for people who can't afford an Escalade. Because most of those more efficient small cars run fine on regular gasoline, they are a lot cheaper to drive as well.\n\nSo there's that. It remains to be seen if California manages to hold the line on fleet efficiency standards, though.\n\nlikbez , October 20, 2019 at 2:12 am\n\nWhat you do not understand that modern compact SUVs are sedans in disguise and as such are no less efficient (wind drag is higher on speed above 50 miles/hour, but roll loses are less due to larger tires.)\n\nThey also are better suited to low quality roads with large potholes, which became more and more prevalent\n\nThis is just a more practical in the current circumstances form factor that people tend to prefer. They all have the same engines as sedans and often the same frame.\n\nThe majority now are 4 cylinder (the dominant SUV in the USA is 4-cyl Honda CRV which gets over 30 miles per gallon 28/34 according to the government stats).\n\nThe personage of large SUV on US roads is shrinking with the deterioration of the standard of living of population and loss of well paying jobs. Also many people who buy large SUVs and a small tracks gets some income as subcontractors; so for them this is a work horse, not only ride to work car.\n\nAnother fact is growing percentage of older people (17% I think as of 2019) in the USA who own the car but do not drive much (say less then 3K a year). For them the issue of fuel efficiency is moot, but issue of reliability is important. As such they are better off with a larger engines and larger SUVs.\n\nOok , October 19, 2019 at 9:57 pm\n\nI'm surprised to see these things described as a safe alternative. SUVs have a higher center of gravity than sedans, which actually makes them more likely to roll or lose control unless you have a highly skilled driver who is aware of this.\n\nlikbez , October 20, 2019 at 1:57 am\n\nIt depends. Hybrid SUVs have a heavy battery that lower the center of gravity considerably.\n\nHigher position of driver in SUV actually is a safe measure in and by itself, as it improves visibility.\n\n[Sep 02, 2019] I see EVs and modern ICE vehicles as too complicated, even though they seem quite reliable for a few hundred K Km.\n\nSep 02, 2019 | peakoilbarrel.com\n\nPaulo x Ignored says: 09/02/2019 at 8:24 am\n\nI see EVs and modern ICE vehicles as too complicated, even though they seem quite reliable for a few hundred K Km. My God, even modern tire valve stems have batts and transmitters linked to idiot displays because people are now too stupid to check their tire inflation. Valve stem price $200 $300 per? Extrapolate to battery and propulsion software, (proprietary software), that stops all future jobber replacement parts beyond belts and fluids.\n\nAnyway, I have a rebuilt 1981 Westfalia that looks and runs like a dream. It is worth more than I have invested in it, in fact it is currently worth 7X what my showroom condition 2005 GMC work truck is worth, (The truck with 150,000 Km on it and maintained to new condition). The most complicated system on the Westie is a resistor pack \"running\" some intake temp sensors to adjust mixture mix on startup. My electronic tech buddy was looking to fix a friends jeep last week. The horn wouldn't work. He thought it was .well, a horn. No it isn't. It is a sending unit that transits to a brain box that sends a signal to a device that says, \"Make horn noise now\". Computerised, of course. My Father- in-law had some kind of Buick that would flash the occasional warning light about a door. Price to swap out the module? $900. Excess complexity needless complexity.\n\nI keep seeing a modern Mad Max in my head. Instead of an insanely laughing Mel Gibson hot wiring a fuel tanker we'll see a meter toting nerd testing leads and wires and asking if anyone can read this damn code?\n\nislandboy x Ignored says: 09/02/2019 at 9:38 am\n\nPaulo, your meter toting nerd is more likely going to be a nerd with a laptop, an OBD port dongle and a Controller Area Network Bus (CANBUS) sniffing setup, fuming about a strange (proprietary) implementation of the CANBUS protocol. My undestanding of the CANBUS arrangement is that all devices are attached to the Controller Area Network (CAN) and assigned a unique id. In the case of the friend's jeep, pressing the horn button results in a packet being sent across the CAN addressed to the horn. All devices on the network receive the packet but only the horn responds to it and switches on. I assume a second packet would switch it off.\n\nThe theory is that CANBUS should allow a single network/power cable to daisy chain to all the devices in the vehicle and control them, as opposed to having, for example, several wires to control three speed wipers with intermittent wiping as well. It remains to be seen how well CANBUS will stand the test of time but, it is likely to see increased adoption, especially with EVs.\n\nHickory x Ignored says: 09/02/2019 at 10:54 am\n\nHi Paulo,\n\nI share your concern about vehicles becoming too complex to fix with local skill/local machine, etc. I used to handle many repair tasks myself when younger, but things have become a complicated spaghetti mess under hood.\n\nAnd of course, this problem affects just about all kinds of vehicles built in past 3-4 decades. I'd guess well over 95% of the vehicles running around on the roads are 'fragile' due to complexity of the systems. EV maybe less so, since there are simply less systems at play.\n\nA guy in Germany has over 900,000 km on a Tesla. I'm guessing he had had to have the battery pack changed out, but didn't see that info.\n\nAnother issue along these lines is the energy supply line.\n\nWith Petrol, there a very complicated system to get the juice from the source rock to the target tank. Such as a refinery.\n\nThat looks very fragile to me.\n\nReliance on that kind of complex system in a chaotic world is very risky.\n\nThe supply line for electricity can be just as complex, but just like you point out the possibilities with the Westfalia, I point out that the electricity supply line can also be much simpler. If you have some equipment (dry solid material with no moving parts- PV panels, inverter, wiring/plug), your personal or local supply change for transport juice can be very short, and durable.\n\n[Aug 02, 2019] The Tesla global fleet also reached a total of 500,000 vehicles\n\nAug 02, 2019 | economistsview.typepad.com\n\nRC (Ron) Weakley -> mulp ... ,\n\n[Speaking of false dichotomies - ]\n\nhttps://electrek.co/2018/11/16/tesla-fleet-10-billion-electric-miles/\n\nTesla reaches 10 billion electric miles with a global fleet of half a million cars\n\nFred Lambert\n\n- Nov. 16th 2018 6:02 am ET\n\nTesla's global fleet is growing at a record pace and we now learn that it reached a total of 10 billion electric miles with half a million cars this week.\n\nBack in October 2016, we reported on Tesla reaching the 3 billion electric mile milestone and the company's global fleet managed to add 500 million more miles 3 months later – bringing the total to 3.5 billion in December and another half a billion more by March 2017.\n\nAt the time, Tesla's fleet was driving about 5 million miles a day on average.\n\nWe were able to track the progress through the Tesla road trip page and Tesla confirmed that its global fleet reached over 5 billion electric miles driven in July 2017.\n\nThe average went up to almost 7 million miles per day when Tesla slowly started Model 3 production.\n\nTesla removed the counter from the Tesla road trip page and we haven't been able to track the fleet mileage as consistently.\n\nBut a source familiar with the data point confirmed to Electrek that the fleet surpassed 9 billion total miles in September and at the time, Tesla drivers averaged almost 20 million miles per day – close to 4 times the average from just 2 years ago.\n\nAt the time, we noted that at that pace, the fleet would reach 10 billion miles before Thanksgiving and sure enough, the same source confirmed to Electrek that Tesla's fleet reached 10 billion electric miles yesterday.\n\nThe Tesla global fleet also reached a total of 500,000 vehicles around the world just a day before.\n\nElectrek's Take\n"
