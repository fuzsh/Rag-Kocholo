Schiffer, courtesy Art Against Apartheid. THE INDEPENDENT 1 LETTERS BALANCING ACTS To the editor: Renee Tajima's comments on the Atlanta Media Project lead readers to believe that Atlanta's media community is woefully indifferent to the achieve- ments of Black artists. As former program director at Atlanta's IMAGE Film/Video Center, I would like to set the record straight. During the four years of my involvement with IM- AGE, the center was a yearly participant in the Third World Film Festival. In 1981, Robert Gardner opened the Atlanta Film and Video Festival (spon- sored by IMAGE) with Clarence and Angel. Denise Oliver was selected to appear as the sole guest artist in a city-wide women's film festival organized by the Center. Pearl Bowser presented a program on the roots of Black independent cinema. Charles Burnett spoke on Killer of Sheep. Warrington Hudlin and Jennifer Lawson served as festival judges. Spike Lee's Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop was shown in Atlanta at the festival long before it was shown in New York, and the 1985 program featured a night devoted exclusively to Black video artists. IMAGE'S screening series regularly includes works that recog- nize and celebrate Black culture. Not a bad record for a nonprofit struggling to keep its doors open — and one that I'd say measures up to the programming at Boston Film/Video Foundation, Film-in-the-Cities, and many other national centers. There will always be criticism that folks should \"do more.\" Worth Long is critical of whites for \"sending out brochures to 100 Black organizations and wondering why they [Blacks] don't come.\" Sure- ly, Long has worked in understaffed, underpaid operations where time and money don't permit full- fledged publicity and networking campaigns. Tajima neatly avoids the uncomfortable subject of reverse discrimination. The experience of being treated as a token white is just as distressing as the more common one of being treated as a token Black, and it's discouraging to attend an intimate reception for a Third World filmmaker and listen to open talk of whites as \"The Enemy\" as though one were as in- visible as the proverbial invisible man. Certainly equality of representation in the media is the end sought by all those active in the independent movement. To downgrade and diminish the sincere and dedicated efforts of organizations like IMAGE does nothing to further that goal. — Linda Dubler Atlanta, Georgia To the editor: As the executive director of IMAGE Film/Video Center, one of only three media arts centers in the Southeast recognized as such by the National En- dowment for the Arts (the others being Appalshop and the South Carolina Arts Commission Media Arts Center), I Wish to reply to Renee Tajima's limited, in- 2 THE INDEPENDENT adequate description of both the Atlanta Media Project and the minority outreach activities of south- eastern media arts organizations in her article, \"Thinking Globally, Acting Locally,\" in The Inde- pendent's October 1985 issue. I was never interviewed by Tajima regarding the is- sue of minority outreach and participation at IM- AGE. She called me only to ask how many of our members are Blacks who produce works, and she neither told me the specific reason for her questions nor asked me to respond to the statements made by Cheryl Chisholm (who is now on our board of direc- tors) or Worth Long, who says we don't do enough minority outreach. If she were a responsible jour- nalist, she would have done much more research on this subject, which at least would have been to get IMAGE'S side of the story. Mimi Pickering from Ap- palshop was in town recently (to appear at a Martin Luther King Center nonviolent film festival), and she confirmed that, to her knowledge, Tajima had not contacted anyone at Appalshop to ask questions about Frank Eastes and the Native American Indian Media Center, either. This is unprofessional and only hurts our field when we can't take the time to do the proper research necessary to give ourselves the com- plete picture. As a newly-elected board member of AIVF, I am doubly concerned and hope this type of cursory reporting of only one side of the story will be corrected. My reply would have been that we don't do enough outreach to anyone; we have a small, underpaid, over- worked staff that cannot take on much more work than we have now to run the center's programs and keep the doors open. I wish we had the resources to do more outreach work; it is one of my goals as direc- tor, if I last long enough. Our doors are open to peo- ple of all ages, races, and genders, and nothing in our past history refutes that policy. As independents, we are all minorities in a real sense, and I don't think we can afford to subdivide ourselves into even smaller factions that look at the larger group and accuse them of being \"cliquish.\" We are all struggling to survive, and we know we aren't doing enough to reach everyone in the field, but at this point in our fragile history, it does us no good to make unfair accusations of ignorance and in- sensitivity on anyone's part, be they white, black or purple. In Atlanta, IMAGE exists in a complex web of political, economic, and cultural forces that make it very difficult to please everyone and still maintain even a modicum of integrity and quality, but we have managed to do that so far. If The Independent is to maintain its integrity and quality as a national jour- nal that is accurately reporting the activities and con- cerns of the media arts field, its writers have to under- stand the complexity of the issues they are dealing with when they choose to report on regions far re- moved from their immediate reality. In the future, I hope to see more reports from the field and not ar- ticles written in New York City, based on a few phone calls. I will volunteer my services, and I hope other AIVF members will do the same. —Robin Reidy IMAGE Film/ Video Center Atlanta, Georgia To the editor: Congratulations to The Independent and Renee Ta- jima for giving national voice to those of us, people of color, who struggle daily against the hegemony of independent southern media centers. These organi- zations differ little, in principle and practice, from their mainstream commercial counterparts, and would rather define and present our history and culture for us than allow us access to the means to in- terpret and express them ourselves. I encourage my southern, white media friends to read Tajima's article and to circulate it widely. It should be viewed not so much as an indictment, but as a stimulus for change. — Vanessa Greene New Orleans, LA Renee Tajima replies: Although IMAGE was never specifically mentioned in my article, Linda Dubler's and Robin Reidy's re- sponses suggest the sensitivity of media organizations to criticism about minority participation. But they seemed to have missed my point: to profile two media centers in the South, controlled by people of color, and to look at their experience from their own perspective. The research on the piece began with the question, why is there so little minority production in the South? Dozens of phone calls were placed by me and Tracey Willard (whose research assistance was unac- knowledged), primarily to minority producers and organizations who were the subject of the piece. Al- though many with whom I spoke had specific criti- cisms of the failures of established and alternative in- stitutions in the South to support minority pro- ducers, I chose not to focus on that failure. I decided instead to take a look at the positive work of two organizations that seek to redress years of media dis- enfranchisement: the Atlanta Media Project and the Native American Indian Media Center. But inevitably, AMP and NAIM's own raison d'etre is closely linked to the failure of some existing organizations. From their point of view, institutional racism still exists— never blatant, but just as deleteri- ous. And from their point of view, steps to ameli- orate the effects of racism have been inadequate. In- deed, media activists like Worth Long have worked in the nonprofit media milieu for many years. Long knows the lay of the land, knows the record of vari- ous media centers, and he thinks it has not been enough. Racism and discrimination is an uncomfortable issue, particularly in our own ranks. At a recent panel of minority video producers that I moderated for the New York Media Alliance, even I was surprised by the strong, sometimes bitter comments that were di- rected to the white alternative video establishment. (It's probably a surprise to some that we would even consider them an establishment— that might give you an idea how locked out the locked out can be.) I do not think this anger must be constantly justified. I am reminded of the story of the reader for a humanities funding cycle who rejected a project on Black Americans, contending that it only looked at JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 slavery and racism without showing \"the other side of the story. \" But I'm surprised at the reaction of rep- resentatives from an organization like IMAGE, which ostensibly supports the existence of documen- taries that take a point-of-view in the face of PBS dogmas of \"objective journalism.\" I believe there is room for, say, a profile of an 80-year-old nuclear ac- tivist and her attitudes towards the bomb. And I think there is also a place for a report that looks close- ly at the pros and cons of the bomb — just as there is a place for an article on, perhaps, the history of the minority-white relations in southern media. This was not such an article. I therefore take issue with Reidy 's charge of unbal- anced journalism. Call Mimi Pickering to substanti- ate the simple statement that Frank Eastes had a residence at Appalshop? (Appalshop, which is located in predominantly white Whitesburg, Ken- tucky, would probably not be the subject of an article on race relations anyway.) This article was meant to give insight into NAIM and AMP, not Appalshop, nor IMAGE, and that is why NAIM and AMP per- sonnel spoke generally about their criticisms rather than pinpointing specific organizations. Reidy asserts that — far away in New York — I do not understand the complexities of the situation in Atlanta. But it is Reidy and Dubler who are speaking a totally different language from Long, TeSheWa, Eastes, Chisholm, or me. When it comes to questions of color, it is not a New York City-other regions issue. I hoped my quote from Frantz Fanon, from the Second Congress of Black Artists and Writers in Rome, would have underscored this. I regard \"reverse discrimination\" as a subterfuge. Racism is not a question of easy conversations at cocktail parties. It is a question of power. Who has access? Who has information? Who produces? Whose work gets shown? Nor do I consider all inde- pendent producers to be \"minorities.\" People of col- or and women have a very particular history of economic, political, and social oppression — that is at the root of our disenfranchisement from and abuse by the media. We are not a \"smaller faction\" that must be placated. At one time in history, a lot of peo- ple thought that civil rights was everybody's busi- ness. I think the reason organizations like NAIM and AMP must exist is because not enough of us are mak- ing it our business today. I hope Reidy's opening line that identifies IMAGE as \"one of the only three media arts centers in the Southeast recognized as such by the [NEA]\" is not meant to diminish the impor- tance of these two groups. We should not be a field defined only by NEA funding guidelines, but by our constituencies at home. On the surface, it looks like Reidy and Dubler are shadowboxing. If IMAGE'S record of Black partici- pation is as good as Dubler says, the group would not be the subject of criticism. Besides, it would have been more helpful to know what percentage of IM- AGE'S programming actually involves the work of Black producers, rather than Dubler's sampling of activities over a four year period. I am glad to see that, since this article was printed, Cheryl Chisholm has joined the board of IMAGE. Some dialogue will probably continue internally. But 1 hope Reidy and Dubler will come better prepared to participate in that dialogue, with a greater understanding of the perspectives and experience of the people of color who are a part of the independent media community. The article I wrote was meant to be their chance to speak. JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 Martha Gever replies: Beyond taking issue with Renee Tajima's assessment of relations between Black independent producers in the South and white-dominated media centers, Robin Reidy questions \"the integrity and quality\" of The Independent. She speculates that Tajima, and perhaps other contributors to the magazine, are ig- norant of the complexities of social dynamics in geo- graphical areas far from where they live. She requests an increase in the geographical diversity of authors published in these pages. I urge Reidy to examine back issues for the past year. She will find many articles written by authors living outside New York City. But our primary aim is not simply to reflect geographical diversity. We main- tain a commitment to reporting on and analyzing independent media activity as diverse as the people who make, show, teach, distribute, watch, and otherwise support this variegated matrix — not always determined by points on the map. In this vein, Tajima and others have regularly covered topics for The Independent that are ignored in other journals. Fears about survival and fragility concern many of us engaged in alternative media and related institu- tions. However, these should not become props, but instead, encourage discussions of racism, sexism, homophobia, and other social diseases. Calling this factionalism, when the differences among us need to be recognized and taken seriously, obscures actual conflicts, reproducing actual social inequities — and fear. If we sink into self-congratuiations — rewriting press relases, asking no probings questions — we re- linquish any claims to critical consciousness and erode that foundation of democratic, alternative media. MODELING CAREER To the editor: The trouble with role models is that, as real people, they have weaknesses too— a point Debra Goldman, in her review of The Legend of Maya Deren [October 1985], seems unaware of. If Deren \"wrestled . . •. with her need for male attention\" and changed artistic styles as she changed men, and if she was \"stocky\" rather than delicate, as she looked in her films, was she really formulating a grand deception or is this just gossip? I think the latter. Her work dealt with themes of ambiguity and sexual confrontation. That those remained unresolved issues in her life is not a fair criticism. As another Russian Jewish filmmaker from Syra- cuse, I was strongly influenced by Deren, in part, simply because she existed. There are few other avant-garde women filmmakers in her generation (Leni Reifenstahl's Nazi propaganda films were hardly inspiring). To learn now that Deren led a con- fused life doesn't diminish her legacy. One discovers perfect people exist only in movies, bad ones. 38 ways to give your lighting a lift Lowel's Surmountable Kit contains 38 clamping, mounting, rigging, light-diffusing, light- reflecting and shadowing devices.

The Association of Young Tunisian Filmmakers, today the Tuni- sian Federation of Amateur Cineastes, organized the first session of a festival that has since become one of the most important showcases for nation- al amateur cinema, the International Festival of Non-Professional Film. Amateur film in Tunisia enjoys more popular and government support, organized thinking, and unified action than we independents in the United States can imagine. We were invited to the festival to run technical workshops, and, in spite of our familiarity with amateur movie-making in North America, we were unprepared for the level of enthusiasm that amateur films enjoy in this North African na- tion. Twenty-one years after the first session, this festival in the small coastal town of Kelibia has become an oasis for movie lovers — aptly, since \"amateur\" in French derives from loving. Kelibia is the biannual gathering place for hun- dreds of amateur filmmakers from Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. They come to meet, exchange ideas, discuss production methods, debate cinematic values, and bear witness to their firm commitment to a cinema distinct from the commercial model. As Radhi Trimeche, the director of the 1985 event, explained, par- ticipants at the Kelibia festival are dedicated to \"an amateur cinema claiming rights to free ex- pression and to diversity, a cinema representing a plurality of social realities and cultural heritages.\" Twenty cine-clubs are spread across Tunisia. These local groups of filmmakers have joined together for a variety of reasons, ranging from viewing films to sharing equipment, from teach- ing film technology to discussing cinema art . The Tunisian Federation put the total national membership of cine-clubs at 30,000, a figure that includes the public for amateur films as well as approximately 600 actively working filmmakers. That total number represents four tenths of a percent of Tunisia's population of seven million: In comparison, imagine over one million Ameri- cans actively supporting U.S. independent media on a regular basis. The cine-club culture is a grassroots pheno- menon, but its adherents are all capable of so- phisticated political and social analysis. These Tunisian media activists are clear and organized about their desire to create an indigenous cinema culture and foster an educated and concerned viewing public. The Federation and festival or- ganizers are well aware of the issues involved in 4 THE INDEPENDENT accepting government support. They walk a fine line of cultivating support for film production and viewership without compromising their in- dependence, a struggle that closely resembles the constant balancing act of the U.S. independent media community. For the first time this year the Tunisian Ministry of Culture funded the Federation's pur- chase of Super-8 production and exhibition equipment for each cine-club. The Federation requested this subsidy to stem a decline in pro- duction due to rising 16mm costs and because few individuals are able to buy Super-8 equip- ment, imported to the Third World as a luxury item. Yet even before this grant was made, the 20 clubs were producing 25 to 30 films a year while sharing four Super-8 cameras and some 16mm equipment. Next year, the clubs anticipate sup- port for Vi- and 3/i-inch video production and postproduction equipment. Government support of the cine-clubs was evident at the festival itself, which invited 300 representatives of the 20 Tunisian clubs and paid their room and board for the week so the club members could watch films day and night. These participants took advantage of every chance to watch films and discuss cinema. Each morning they showed up with notes in hand, taking their turns at the microphones in the debate hall to voice thoughtful and passionate opinions on the films they had seen. Tunisian Ministry of Culture representatives were on hand for official greeting ceremonies and participated with apparent delight in the awards ceremony. Both national and local of- ficials hosted special events for the 60 interna- tional guests, making speeches about the impor- tance of amateur film as a bridge to international understanding, offering soft drinks and almond- paste delicacies and giving gifts. We were the on- ly people from the United States at an event that had delegates from at least 30 countries, while many more cultures were represented by films. Most international guests were subsidized by their own governments, but the Federation took all guests in its charge as soon as we stepped off the plane. The Arabic speaking countries were well represented, as were Belgium, France, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Canada, the Soviet Union, Hong Kong, Sene- gal, Guinea, Ivory Coast — and Palestine. In addition to invited guests and cine-club* members, the participation of the townspeople of Kelibia was strong; most nights the 1 ,300-seat outdoor theater in the Kelibia Cultural Center was filled with ardent spectators. The festival was widely promoted on daily television, in the newspapers, and even through theatrical news- reels that covered many of its activities. We ask- Festival participants were greeted by a float from the festival parade at the gates of the Kelibia Cultural Center. Photo Bob Brodsky ed our hosts at the festival why the public was so receptive to amateur movies and were offered the social and political history of Tunisia as a context. As a result of Tunisia's long colonial history, the people have placed a great priority on redefining their own cultures and identities both nationally and ethnically since indepen- dence in 1956. Yet our hosts noted with evident concern the quantity of imported media with its suggestions of lingering cultural imperialism. French and U.S. movies are pervasive, and locally originated programming makes up only a small portion of the daily television schedule. In the evenings, we saw men assemble in the sidewalk cafes to smoke and drink green tea, while overhead television sets featuring French, Italian, and U.S. pro- gramming competed with the din. In most of the Arab states of North Africa, certain kinds of U.S. media seem inescapable: Dallas and Dynas- ty, satellite-delivered pictures of President Reagan greeting their prime ministers at the White House, the latest Clint Eastwood film from Hollywood, and endless, cheaply acquired reruns of our TV series from the fifties and six- ties. Many Arabs we met at the festival are hotly involved with their own independent film move- ments and yet have no idea that a U.S. indepen- dent media community exists. These same peo- JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 pie would welcome the work of U.S. indepen- dents, as well as information about our experi- ences with media centers, film funding, distribution, and exhibition. Ahmed Zir, a Berber filmmaker, told us he believes that local home video stores could successfully market alternative programming alongside Hollywood features. The desire to create an antidote to the values of Western commercial media was evident in the festival's goals, prominently displayed on banners that festooned Kelibia's streets during the festival. Films were selected and judged on their contribution to the edification of a national culture, their representation of a national heri- tage and social reality, and their attention to na- tional liberation movements. Thus the screen- ings were filled with documentaries or dramatic depictions of social issues: the Polesario struggl- ing for identity in the Western Sahara, life on the Green Line in Beirut, depictions of Palestinian daily life, the beggar child in the streets of Tunis, the plight of the Arab immigrant in the suburbs of Paris, housing scams and shortages through- out the developing world, factory closings, union activities, and more. While we could not understand the Arabic voice-overs, we learned that the world looks quite different from an Arab perspective than to those who view it from the U.S. Only one Arab film — by the Berber Zir — focused on nuclear annihilation; none were concerned with acid rain and only one centered on women's issues. The single feminist film, En- tre la Reve et la Realitie, by Habib Mesteri, won a controversial prize for scenario in the interna- tional competition. Although generally con- sidered technically weak, the film was one of the first locally-made films to tackle the subject of women's frustration in the Arab world, and the jury felt strongly that this kind of material deserved encouragement. Throughout the week, we could not help no- ticing that the Tunisian audiences are more de- monstrative than those in North America. In Tunisia, a film lives or dies very publicly; only those who truly like a movie will applaud while others feel free to boo, stomp, or whistle. When the national jury, in a controversial move, de- clined to give a first prize to a Tunisian film be- cause they felt that none merited it, the jury chair, critic Sophie El Goulli, had the difficult task of explaining to a disgruntled audience that the jury had wanted to use its power to encour- age higher standards for next year. Amidst audi- ence heckling, the Golden Falcon, the festival's top prize, was awarded to a modest Argentinian production, Witness in Chains, by Fernando Spiner. In a plot reminiscent of Antonioni's Blow Up, a journalist photographs a murder, takes the photos to the police, and is \"disap- peared\" while yet another citizen documents his death. The exteriors had to be shot very careful- ly, as the film was made in 1981-1982, under the former Argentinian military regime.

A U.S film, David Casci's Extended Play, was by far the biggest crowd pleaser — a preference that puzzled us, for it was more Hollywood and less amateur than most films screened. Extended Play is a carefully made special effects film about a video arcade buff and his opponent, a video MIG fighter. As the two systematically destroy the rest of the arcade on repeated strafings, the audience roared its approval, while we felt a little embarrassed at yet another Rambo-style U.S. creation. It shared second prize with The Magic Circle, by Zigurds Vidigush. No two films could be more different in style or content. Vidigush's film portrays the life cycle of the sturgeon, from spawning through caviar, with all the mystery that black and white film can conjure. Drawing upon the traditions of Soviet montage and his own considerable skill in optical printing, Vidigush's luminous tale of simple things offers a reprise of the techniques of his national cinema while remaining a very personal film. Animation was the focus of particular excite- ment this year. All the animated entries in the festival were well received, perhaps because they were visually oriented rather than verbal and thus completely comprehensible. In addition, Canadians Richard Clark and Andre Leduc were on hand to give an \"animathon.\" This three-day workshop on 16mm black and white filmstock was planned for 15 to 20 people, but when registration began, more than 80 amassed at the door. Clark and Leduc cut off registration at five eel-drawing teams of 12 each, took over the nursery building behind the cultural center, and set up the camera on a stand in the foyer. The resulting one-minute films, presented dou- ble system on a Sonorex projector, were vigorously applauded on awards night by a stan- ding room only crowd. Our postproduction Super-8 workshop was limited to 20 people — one representative from each cine-club — a decision made quickly in the face of overflow from the other workshop. We were asked a lot of questions about every aspect of film technology by a room full of men hungry for hands-on help with the equipment. They ask- ed more questions than could be answered in a mere two days, including challenging ones on the status of amateur filmmakers and social rela- tions in the United States. \"Does everyone live like they do in DallasV \"Why are all the children black in the Super-8 film about parent support groups that you brought?\" \"Does your ministry of culture give your amateur filmmakers equip- ment?\" \"Would American people be interested in seeing our films?\" And, our favorite, \"Why doesn't America have a big international ama- teur film festival and invite us all?\" As we struggled to answer these questions, we found ourselves rethinking many aspects of U.S. film culture. The definition of \"amateur\" or \"non-professional\" was one of the more ticklish issues. Are U.S. independents too professional to participate in an amateur festival? Is it fair for relatively large budget films to compete against those made with tiny budgets — a question that plagues amateur festivals wherever Super-8 com- petes with 16mm. Some films in the festival were obviously made in local cine-clubs on available 16mm equipment, while others were made by professional film crews on their days off in Super-8 with studio sound mixes. In contrast, many filmmakers from the U.S. alternative media culture start with cheaper formats and low-tech styles only to move into the mainstream with fancy budgets and techno-toys. Sometimes this transition begins with dreams of the big time, while for others it is a financial necessity. Are filmmakers who make this transition still amateurs? Can they still produce films representing free expression, diversity, and plurality of experience? Do confirmed U.S. amateurs even want their films to have a greater audience than that which they can assemble in their living rooms? And further, is the U.S. public at all interested in amateur cinema? JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 s 3HL Would they support its creation with their tax dollars? Would they like to see more personal, individual cinematic expressions or experience social realities beyond the cliches currently seen on TV? U.S. affluence provides media access to peo- ple with many different aspirations and the diverse forms of our cine-culture resist centraliz- ed organization. This is not the case in Tunisia, where policymakers and press exhibit a high level of organized support for amateur cinema, pro- moting it without controlling its content. That band of pioneers who initiated the festival knew that cinema arts were an excellent vehicle for people struggling for their national in- dependence and cultural identities. In 1985, in Kelibia, they seem to have found a balance of production and exhibition, public support and independent content. Stated Radhi Trimeche, \"As modestly as the festival was born in 1964, thanks to the courage and determination of a few founders, Kelibia demonstrates the ongoing battle to bring together people and their civiliza- tion, to develop exchange and communication about cine-culture and finally, and most impor- tantly, to work to create a people's cinema.\" Bob Brodsky and Toni Treadway are the authors ofSuper-8 in the Video Age available in English and Spanish.

Documentary units at com- mercial TV networks are being decimated by cut- backs and layoffs. The few documentaries being produced are probably not destined for prime- time slots. Likewise, the crisis for independent political documentaries continues. With an em- phasis on production values needed to compete with mainstream media, they are becoming more expensive to produce and more difficult to finance. The relative generosity and liberalism that existed in the 1970s at agencies like the Na- tional Endowment for the Humanities shifted abruptly rightward under Reagan in the early eighties. Memories of \"Masterworks\" and paranoia linger. The alternative distribution net- works formed in the 1960s and seventies, provid- ing outlets for political documentaries, have also encountered obstacles, with formidable compe- tition from home video markets. Some of these distributors, such as Unifilm, Brandon Films, Odeon, and more recently, Iris Distribution, have already gone under. The libraries and universities that support these distribution net- works have also experienced severe budget cuts. At the same time, documentary form seems to be entering an important period of evaluation, in part precipitated by semiologjcal and structural- ist writings of the past decades that dethroned realist conventions from any privileged claim to truth, reality, or objectivity. There is also a reac- tion against formal stagnation. In the struggle to get independent political documentaries on public TV, producers succumb to PBS formulas, as well as dilute political content in the hope of getting past the gatekeepers to reach a wider au- dience. Enter \"Show Us Life, \" an absorbing anthol- ogy of 23 essays surveying some of the most ex- citing and exploratory films and filmmakers in- involved in the complex history of radical documentaries — from the Bolshevik Revolution to the battlefields and national cultural renaissances in Central America. The title, \"Show Us Life, \" (the cry of a Vertovian peasant uncontaminated by the illusionism of dramatic form) ironically suggests an innocent trans- parency for documentary cinema. Of course, this was never possible, although popular con- ceptions, some interpretations of cinema verite, and assumptions made by some filmmakers, make that claim. From the opening essay, Seth Feldman's '\"Cinema Weekly' and 'Cinema Truth': Dziga Vertov and the Leninist Propor- tion,\" the anthology makes it clear that the earliest newsreel producers recognized complex and encoded uses of symbolic form, and that the dividing line between fact and fiction was never fixed. The book is separated into two historical The Commander-in-Chief is transformed into a medieval crossbowman in Santiago Alvarez's 1968 film \"LBJ,\" discussed in \"Show Us Life.\" 8 THE INDEPENDENT blocks covering \"pioneers\" and \"contem- poraries.\" Contemporaries are loosely divided between Western and Third World films and filmmakers. The anthology includes case studies of such films as Native Land, Spanish Earth, Finally Got the News, The Nightcleaners, Harlan County, USA, The Battle of Chile, Hour of the Furnaces, and Waves of Revolution. Throughout, recurring themes and interconnect- ing threads span diverse historical moments and stages in national political development. Some of these are: the role of the filmmaker as an ac- tive participant in political movements, the social relations of production, the role of the Com- munist Party, audiences and related issues of distribution, relations between use value and aesthetic considerations, and the incorporation of critical techniques to combat dominant cul- tural forms. In his introduction editor Thomas Waugh summarizes some of the conclusions of con- tributors Steve Neale, Paul Willemen, and Claire Johnston: \"[The documentary] relies no less than any other filmic genre on its own systems of codes, conventions, and cultural assumptions and mediations.\" He then offers a succinct outline for one of the central theoretical issues facing documentary production today: \"A documentary that doesn't challenge the terms of its own conventions of belief and that does not subscribe to the aesthetic prescriptions of what has become known as 'political modernism' is guilty not only of a fallacious realism but also of political complicity.\" (Waugh quotes the term \"political modernism\" from Frederic Jameson, who is presumably referring to artists and critics like Brecht and Adorno and the modernism vs. realism debate, with Lukacs on the side of realism.) Virtually all of the contemporary films described in Show Us Life demonstrate con- sciousness of conventions of belief. Some films exploit those conventions to achieve political ob- jectives, others consciously try to depose them. For instance, Julianne Burton's \"Democratizing Documentary: Modes of Address in the Latin American Cinema, 1958-72,\" chronicles Latin American filmmakers' attempts, to develop pluralistic and democratic modes of address. She examines how undemocratic social structures may be echoed by authoritarian film structures, such as the anonymous, omniscient voice-of- God narrator. However, the ideological challenge posed by such critical approaches to documentary seems to be sidestepped in Waugh's introduction. What's at stake for the future of documentary production remains for the reader to ponder. Furthermore, Waugh questions whether the JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 common sense understanding of documentary will ever change much, observing, \" . . .the new documentary theory has never even threatened to dislodge documentary as an important and discrete arena of committed film practice. The new skepticism has not led radical film activists to abandon documentary in favor of Godardian introspection: far from it.\" In a subtle way, this passage seems to pit documentary theory against documentary practice. Waugh refuses to recognize that documentary form in 1985 re- mains an open question, and the \"common sense understanding\" he proposes is a paradigm that can and probably will shift dramatically. Despite this seeming evasion, \"Show Us Life\" is both timely and significant. Very few books provide either a theoretical or topographical overview of political documentary production of the past 60 years. It would be unfair to expect any single anthology to cover the entire terrain. The anthology took five years to complete and was originally intended to be twice the size. Waugh freely admits that more is needed. Un- fortunately, the book reproduces some tradi- tional omissions; there is a conspicuous absence of writings about films made by American Blacks, Asian Americans, Africans, or Chinese. While Waugh may understate the practical impact of new documentary theory, the essay \"Brecht in Britain: The Nightcleaners and the In- dependent Political Film,\" by Johnston and Willemens, discusses attempts to overturn tradi- tional power relations between producers and consumers by encouraging viewers not only to think about women workers' unionization ef- forts but about the limits of the images used to reflect the reality of their lives as well. Johnston and Willemen argue that the device of intercut- ting black leader in their film refocuses attention on the editing process and destroys the illusion of seamless documentary realism. The black spac- ing, they claim, also functions to suggest absent images of women's lives that cannot be filmed. But The Nightcleaners may typify a dilemma of political documentaries that experiment with form. They either risk never reaching a wide au- dience, or playing for an audience that finds the films obscure, therefore confusing. But some films must take these risks. Even without wide distribution, they begin to challenge ways of see- ing and suggest possibilities for future genera- tions of producers and viewers. What makes political films political poses a question that goes beyond cinematic form and content. Steve Neale, in \"Notes and Questions on Political Cinema: From Hour of the Furnaces to Ici et Ailleurs, \" suggests that the organization of a film's production, distribution, and exhibi- tion— the context in which it is shown — is a more meaningful determination of what's political. Neale points out that distribution systems in- fluence what is possible to produce and pro- gram, but the impact of what is possible may also be limited by distribution systems where political films circulate as entertainment. Both essays raise major questions for political documentary producers. The critical method embodied in The Nightcleaners challenges the workings of conventional political propaganda. Today, when documentaries of the left and right use the same techniques — e.g., appeal to \"ex- perts\" and other authority figures, shocking im- agery, subliminal sound effects, etc. — how does this reflect the power relations between film- makers and audience? Are these techniques real- ly ideologically neutral? To what extent does the uncritical use of these and other devices threaten the efficacy and credibility of political documen- tary form today? Rambo, the White House \"Tuesday Team,\" and the prominence of right wing groups like Accuracy in Media may offer the most compelling argument for making pro- gressive documentaries that help viewers under- stand how images embody ideology. Crisis is not a premise of \"Show Us Life. \"But, dusting off the tracks of where documentaries have been, the book stimulates diagnostic as well as prescriptive thinking.

This was a Golden Age — the hey- day of underground cinemas and university film societies — when film lovers could indulge in any number of cinematic appetites. Now, people in the industry refer to the demise of university film societies and the commercialization of alter- native film exhibition. At the same time, there has been a remarkable growth of community- oriented cinemas that, in spirit and vitality, are the direct descendants of the university film societies of the late sixties and early seventies. The first university film societies emerged con- currently with growing interest in film as a course of study. During the sixties and early seventies hundreds of these societies blossomed, showing every type of film — classics, foreign films, experimental shorts, avant-garde features and documentaries of all sorts. Competition with local theaters remained minimal because stu- dents would still pay to see the latest release on a Saturday night date. But film courses inspired film buffs, who consequently started program- ming films that they read about in Film Quarter- ly and Cahiers du Cinema. As Al Milgrom of the U Film Society in Minneapolis recalls, \"You'd drool a little bit when you knew that a lot of these interesting films were available elsewhere and not here . . . . My programming was a natural lO THE INDEPENDENT outgrowth of my academic, travel, and film in- terests.\" Milgrom also attributes the success of university film societies to the political climate. \"During the Vietnam era people became aware that there was more going on on-screen than in the cruder forms of entertainment. TV couldn't supply much emotional punch, so films became more important in changing and directing at- titudes.\" In those days, Ron Epple's independent Ex- panded Cinema at the University of Illinois in Urbana showed short experimental films once a month. One of Epple's first programs, Bunuel and Dali's Un Chien Andalou, Nelson's O Dem Watermelons, Anger's Scorpio Rising, Em- shwiller's Dance Chromatic, and Warhol's Mario Banana attracted a huge audience — hun- dreds were turned away. University students ac- counted for the high attendance figures, but sometimes there were visitors from the local community. Epple remembers that this early avant-garde program attracted the Danville Outlaws, a motorcycle gang that had heard he was going to show a film about bikers. At the University of New Mexico, film pro- grammer Noah Golden says their 190-seat theater \"sold out all the time\" during the 1960s. And at Webster College in St. Louis, Missouri, \"There was a very politically active film scene, and much avant-garde work was shown,\" ac- cording to programmer David Kinder. \"As I looked through some old schedules, some of the films they screened really surprised me.\" Films were often screened in haphazard style, with bad projection, hard seats, terrible sound, and prints that varied wildly in quality. But, in some cities, the campus was the only place to see noncom- mercial movies, and the schools that had political activity and a counterculture scene were also very active on the film front. David Pratt of the University of Wisconsin in Madison recalls that\" the film society \"was legendary — the university encouraged a laissez-faire attitude.\" It was not that unusual for Jean-Luc Godard, Nicholas Ray, or someone of similar stature to appear as a visiting filmmaker. Comments Pratt, \"There was a strong emphasis, as in many schools in the sixties, on auteurist fare and avant- garde, experimental works.\" In 1985, things have changed at the University of Wisconsin. \"The regular fare now consists of films like Risky Business, The Graduate, and Harold and Maude. And students don't want to see black and white films — they find them bor- ing and antiquated. There is still a small group showing avant-garde and experimental work. But the university is no longer in the vanguard — the local art theater is,\" say Pratt. \"Film students are much more production- oriented now, and much less interested in inter- national cinema than they were,\" observes film professor Edwin Jahiel at the University of Il- linois. \"It's the 'Reagan mentality.' Now they know rock singers and TV sitcoms.\" Milos Stehlik, director and programmer at Facets Multimedia in Chicago agrees, \"Students don't JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 _FCN5«OV5 VoNOR® LAVS\" DOUGH 0/70 FLANE CAUSING POT® To Bbl L, THUS STARTING STEAM - POWCRSC?

After presenting successful programs of short inde- pendent films, Epple saw a sharp decline in at- tendance around the mid-seventies. In the sixties and early seventies, attracting 300 people for each show on a weekend was common; now attendance of 300 for an entire weekend is rare. \"There is so lit- tle interest in anything even slightly 'alternative.' I can't allow myself a luxury or passion that wouldn't make money.\" Epple won't be playing any foreign language films this year, or any documentaries. He says, \"I still won't show Porky 's or Rambo but will probably end up playing Pale Rider and most of the other popular fare\" — if he can get it before it goes on the local cable movie channel. Just as programmers link the boom in film fascination to the social flux of the sixties, many credit the demand for more conventional pro- grams to conservative student attitudes. But ad- ministrators and faculty are equally implicated. Epple complains that the various departments at the University won't agree to cosponsor films or require attendance for their classes. \"This is the only way we can show interesting programs and still make money,\" he explains. At Syracuse University, the level of concern for film pro- gramming is demonstrated by their plans for a student union building — it won't have a theater. Much university programming has become JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 monopolized by large distributors who sell in bulk. As Kinder says, \"Most college exhibitors are serfs, who have to play off eight or 10 titles to get the two or three they want.\" This, plus cut- backs of funds to universities by the Reagan ad- ministration, has forced once vital film societies to become more timid and Hollywood-oriented. There are, however, a number of film societies that still thrive, showing varied fare. The Univer- sity of New Mexico film society provides a good example. The current programmer Noah Golden took charge of a society that had previously lost $25,000 on \"popular\" films. They now refuse to show what Golden calls \"schlock,\" and \"we work hard at our pub- licity.\" Once they built a regular audience for their weekly series, the society initiated a series of documentaries, which have proved quite popu- lar. They get standing room only crowds and let teachers know about films that might overlap with academic subject matter. The university has been supportive — a prerequisite for the survival of these societies. They are not budgeted for pro- gramming but screening space, offices, equip- ment, and projectionists are provided. The formidable film society at the University of Texas at Austin, the sole film programming enti- ty on a campus with 52,000 people, is considered an auxiliary enterprise of the university. Steve Bearden, who programs the series, finds that there is still a large audience for non-Hollywood films, but that the film society in the eighties must be run as a business. \"Most film societies fall down on marketing and overpay for losing films. Consistency is extremely important. You have to be there and showing movies all the time.\" Bearden programs 25 movies weekly and takes in enough income from popular films like Destroy All Monsters to allow risks that would be impossible at most universities. The \"laissez-faire\" attitude of the sixties and early seventies described by David Pratt is no longer realistic. Universities that don't supply development money or clamp down on com- peting, random film societies or put ceilings on profits (thus curtailing additional community outreach) are bound to fail in the pragmatic eighties. Film rentals are expensive and, without such support, a society can easily flounder. The film societies with the most innovative sched- ules— and the most successful — are those like Cornell Cinema in Ithaca and Webster College in St. Louis that have received some support from their schools but are funded to build au- diences in the surrounding community. Also, for the most part, they are the only places in town to provide an alternative to commercial offerings. And they work, remarkably, without in- terference from university administrators. Like the U. of Wisconsin, Cornell once had a lot of groups showing films. Unlike Madison, however, the options at Cornell were much more pop-oriented, and there wasn't much variety in presentation. Now, according to Cornell Cinema's programmer Richard Herskowitz, his organization is run like a private business; it is THE INDEPENDENT 11 WSDHCSOAY IHURSBar / FR1DA T SATUSOAY WEDNESDAY THUHKOAY/FBIOAY SATURDAY the only group on campus permitted to charge admissions. Consistent, conscientious grassroots publicity brings in audiences that fill their four theaters; at least one-third of the films are cosponsored by community or school groups. They play big commercial hits, classic films, U.S. independent films, and, surprisingly, ex- perimental and avant-garde cinema is alive and well in Ithaca. \"There is a really devoted audience €or films by people like Bruce Conner or Kenneth Anger,\" says Herskowitz. He hosts at least 15 visiting filmmakers every year, including one prominent European director. This past October over 15 documentaries were screened. Like most of the successful film societies, there is a con- scious effort to build audiences. According to Herskowitz, \"Ithaca is conservative as to whom they'll admit into their pantheon. They'll accept Satyajit Ray, but not Mrinal Sen. But people really seem to like events, so we'll have an Indian Film Festival to encourage audience acceptance. Even with this impressive record, they recently eliminated one of their series, and they've had to play a bit to commercial interests. Almost no funding comes from the university: $10,000 of their $270,000 budget. Although they receive less funding from state and national arts councils than other programs of their scope, the New York State Council on the Arts contributes about $5,000 a year. Cornell Cinema encounters pressures similar to those of a commercial 12 THE INDEPENDENT theater: home video and cable diminishes au- diences for the most popular films. And they need this revenue to underwrite the alternative programming. At this point, he intends to apply for more university and arts council support, while resisting commercialization by a number of means, including possible sales of video cassettes. Like Cornell, the Webster Film Society had to identify off-campus audiences and pursue them vigorously in order to change their programs from \"strictly Hollywood\" to more diverse of- ferings. In 1980, David Kinder remembers, \"I became fascinated by the American independent movement and wanted to bring in independent films when no one else was doing it.\" That year, the budget for the film series was healthy because the society became an arm of the administration instead of the student body. At the same time, Kinder recognized the threat presented by video rentals and cable, the need to find \"a second au- dience besides the entertainment-oriented one.\" He faced this challenge when, in the fall of 1982, the society's audience fell 75 percent, because 90 percent of the homes in the outlying areas of St. Louis were wired for cable. Kinder began bringing filmmakers to speak about their films, and when the school requested that he curtail that program because of the ex- pense, he applied to the Missouri State Arts Council for a grant. And got one. He also secured money from other areas within the school, like the Black Students Association and the women's organization, which underwrote the cost of some programs. The Missouri Arts Council has renewed funding for the program, and this fall there will be a visiting artist every week of the semester. Kinder has consolidated his audience by developing a large mailing list, printed schedules, bulk, targeted mailings for every film shown, and course-related series, along with cultivating hard-won support from newspaper and TV critics in the area. Kinder ad- mits that it is still \"really hard to bring in crowds but there is an audience for just about anything.\" Because of the influx of cable and VCRs, his first-run screenings have been substantially more popular than second-run commercial programs. \"Films like Seeing Red, The Good Fight, and Bix have been very popular. Studio films that have never opened in St. Louis, like Barbarosa, Zoot Suit, and The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez have done really well.\" He plays a number of films with political themes \"depending on their availability.

The first was the Pacific Film Archive, the prototype that the other museums and media centers fol- lowed.\" NYSCA's 1972-73 grants included the first ($1 1 ,500) funding for the Film Forum in New York City, a nonprofit exhibition space specializing in independent, experimental, and avant-garde works that opened as \"50 folding chairs in an 88th Street loft,\" according to direc- tor Karen Cooper. In 1974, \"a watershed year for New York State,\" in Rich's words, 80 exhibi- tion organizations were funded, compared to 55 the previous year. \"Funding went wild. . . from $479,000 in 1973 to $1,007,172 in 1974.\" Though increased funding paved the way for community cinemas, other factors inspired their development. Many exhibitors credit the women's movement — the most permanent man- ifestation of the sixties political culture — as pro- viding their first, and most important, audience base. They also acknowledge the significance of U.S. independent films, a form with renewed energy in the mid-seventies. Independent film- makers saw their efforts as perfectly compatible with the sites that provided alternatives to Hollywood products. And exhibitors could cooperate with smaller distributors who put more care into their efforts and could support their important grassroots work. Many of these cinemas were founded with the aim of showing films that weren't commercially available. Most were established as an antitdote to the limited choices offered in large cities, and some were opened in cities that had no discernable film culture. Some were even opened as an extension of or alternative to more conventional university film society programming. A few, like Facets Multimedia in Chicago, in- tended to combat a \"dreary\" film scene that, in the sixties, had been \"pretty active and in- teresting,\" according to founder Milos Stehlik. Along with the Film Center at the Chicago Art Institute and. Chicago Filmmakers, Facets wanted to bring diversity back to film exhibition in Chicago. Stehlik started in 1975 with $40 and a typewriter; subsequently Facets received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts and Illinois Arts Council. Now 84 percent of their in- come is earned, but the money goes directly back into operating expenses, creating \"a perpetual state of being broke.\" Facets has worked very hard at expanding audiences by giving attention to community interests and has succeeded. \"We would never be happy going the museum route, establishing a small core audience and depending on them,\" says Stehlik. \"We direct our pro- grams at the ethnic communities, and we are always reaching out to them.\" The Neighborhood Film Project in Philadel- phia began with a similar goal, described by director Linda Blackaby as \"working with com- munity groups who wanted to use film, and to bring alternative exhibition to a city that showed practically no non-English-speaking films at all.\" With an $1 1,000 grant from a local community foundation, their first programs were anything but conventional, screening Chris Choy's From Spikes to Spindles, two films on women's health, a feature-length documentary on Puerto Rico, and Hugh King's We The People. Later they premiered films like The Memory of of Justice, Merchant of Four Seasons, and Aguirre, The Wrath of God. Blackaby remem- bers, \"There were virtually no first-run houses for foreign films, so we kept getting these in- credible premieres.\" Since then, the cinematic climate in Philadel- phia has changed. Some commercial theaters now show films similar to those the Neighbor- hood Film Project pioneered. But Blackaby doesn't see her organization's role as com- petitive. \"In a lot of cases we develop audiences for the most commercial cinemas, and our role is to show the things they're afraid of, that are risky.\" She believes that the advantage of an alternative exhibition space is \"to get behind a film, and to present it in an appropriate context. When the Roxy Cinema showed Variety, people thought it was a porno movie and walked out. They were totally unprepared for it.\" At the U Film Society in Minneapolis — now more community-oriented because it is a guest of the University but receives no funding from it — competition with local commercial venues JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 THE INDEPENDENT 13 CINE DE VERANO EN LOISAIDA Teatro hueva Asamblea No Reaccion Nuclear H-.i>.-n\\.|iUl.

And competition with Film in the Cities and the Walker Art Center, media centers with large exhibition programs, contributes to a very rich cultural life in Minneapolis/St. Paul. According to Al Milgrom, the Film Society was at first \"very auteur-oriented and brought in a lot of directors.\" Their first programs in the six- ties were extraordinary — one calendar listed El, Way Down East, Nosferatu, Leda, Underworld, Bombshell, The Southerner, Family Portrait, experimental films, local independent films, and a Dutch film, The House, with the director pre- sent. The schedules continue to be exceptionally diverse with a strong Eastern European em- phasis and many special events. Though atten- dance and memberships have increased over the years — with a slight drop this year — Milgrom, like Stehlik at Facets, complains about the demands of his audience and the need to \"stand on his head\" to get them to come. \"Audiences aren't enthusiastic anymore. Film was impor- tant in the Vietnam era but now we have to compete with the Tiffany lamp fern bars. The ac- tivists have become middle-aged and are staying at home. The only way we can attract people is to make filmgoing more of an event — to create ex- citement.\" Fifteen percent of U Film's budget is accounted for by grants and memberships, but they only break even. Milgrom attributes many of these financial problems to distributors, especially the classics divisions, who have \"driven up the costs of films that years ago 14 THE INDEPENDENT would have played at the drop of a $100 bill.\" Some exhibitors have also made an impact in large cities where, due to a surfeit of theaters, they should have had a more difficult time carv- ing out a niche. For instance, Boston, with its ac- tive campus film scene and many theaters serving diverse interests, is home to the 12-year old Angry Arts, a collective dedicated to showing films \"about people in struggle.\" According to collective member Henry Wortis, organized po- litical activity in Boston, like everywhere, has dwindled, but with \"good audience develop- ment, people have come to rely on our judgment about films.\" Angry Arts receives no subsidies, and they have never had a salaried staff. However, attendance has increased yearly, now averaging 300 people per show. Their biggest money-makers last year were Malcolm X, The Battle of Chile, and Choosing Children — testi- mony to the possibility of programming radical material. \"Getting crowds still takes a lot of ef- fort, and getting reviews is difficult,\" comments Wortis. \"We're doing well because we offer something different.\" But there is still a lot of competition for a finite audience — 23 new theaters have opened in Boston in the last three years. Another unconventional venue, Films Charas in New York City's East Village, opened in 1981 . Founder Doris Kurnish explains, \"The neigh- borhood had died as much as it was going to die and had to begin building again.\" From the beginning, Charas offered an eclectic schedule while remaining community-oriented. They brought filmmakers to speak about their films, and they showed many Spanish-language films in order to serve local residents. Critics, charmed by their spirit and ingenuousness, began writing about them. Grants from NYSCA and the Film Bureau at Film/ Video Arts have enabled them to expand their activity. Strong community support has helped Charas bring in sizable audiences for some unusual programs. \"One time we sold out our 400-seat theater with Haitian footage by Maya Deren. We had people standing down the block,\" recounts Kurnish. Charas also occupies a 200-seat cabaret-style theater. \"People love to come there,\" says Kurnish, \"because it's a com- fortable setting, and not intimidating. When John Sayles came to speak with Baby, It's You, he was so excited — the energy was amaz- ing— that he talked until midnight.\" Helena, Montana, Lincoln, Nebraska, or Huntingdon, Long Island, may not appear to be likely sites for dynamic film exhibition. But ex- pectations aside, the Second Story Cinema, the Sheldon Film Theatre, and the New Community Cinema provide exciting cultural oases for the film-starved. Arnie Malina, a transplanted New Yorker started the Second Story Cinema in Helena \"with $6,000 and a need for something culturally stimulating in a town of 25,000 people.\" Lincoln's Sheldon Film Theatre serves a city that is mostly conservative, white, and JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 „„ oft!** of ^^\"^^^pggggm middle class, but as a subsidized entity in a town with only commercial theaters, the Sheldon can function as an art house as well as sponsor museum-type programs. Still, both Second Story and the Sheldon are prone to the same worries of other alternative cinemas: changes in audiences and the incursions of home video and cable. And lately, Dan Ladely, the Sheldon's programmer, has been preoccupied with drum- ming up private funding to \"keep the film pro- gram alive\" after the Nebraska Arts Council cut his budget this year. Over the years, however, community support in Helena and Lincoln has been heartening. The New Community Cinema in Huntington, Long Island — so close to New York City yet so far in terms of filmgoers' tastes — has become an integral part of their community, and the com- munity loves them for it — up to a point. Char- lotte Sky, who started the cinema as a bring- your-own-chairs situation in a small dance studio, expresses serious concern about the future. \"The town government has tried to close us down several times, but people came out and protested, so they got nervous and backed off. But the new town administration is very conser- vative. They hate our guts and we know it.\" Cer- tain programs have upset town officials, espe- cially a night of Cuban films. Now they are try- ing to force the cinema to close down again. The Cinema's landlord — the town itself — has not of- ficially evicted Sky and her partner, Vic Scol- JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 nick, but has repossessed the theater's lounge and raised the already-hefty rent every six months. Funding covers 10 percent of New Com- munity Cinema's budget, and NYSCA and the Film/Video Arts Film Bureau has been \"won- derful,\" says Sky. \"However, profits go right back into programming and operating expenses. There is no fat in the budget.\" At this point, the New Community Cinema must find new quarters and supplement their funding. \"When you are constantly worrying about how much money each program is going to bring in, you can't take programming risks anymore,\" Sky regrets. \"We have heard that any association with left causes will hurt our fundraising.\" To preserve their independence, they are applying to more liberal political foundations for funding and help in securing bank loans, in addition to organizing a series of fundraising events. Problems similar to those of the New Com- munity Cinema notwithstanding, NYSCA reports that in the last few years they have re- ceived strong exhibition requests from all over New York State. And this trend can be observed nationwide. Over the years, most community cinemas have experienced some financial fluctu- ations, but, for the most part, these changes have not seriously affected programming. Looking to the future, the challenge of video and cable is being met by more imaginative pro- gramming, special events, and improved or ex- panded presentation. At least 16 out of the 19 programmers interviewed for this article plan to improve their theaters or are moving to larger, more comfortable quarters. At least half are in- vestigating video programming, and a third in- tend to package cable programs or provide alter- native video rentals for their audience. Facets Multimedia has already entered the cassette business. On a recent trip to England, B. Ruby Rich noted that \"VCRs do not seem to be hur- ting nonprofit, alternative sites, but in 15 years they will have completely changed the commer- cial repertory. I believe that will happen here too.\" What insures the survival of community cinemas in this country is the very thing that makes them so unique and worthy of emula- tion— a visionary, yet practical approach to film exhibition. I would like to thank Richard Peterson for his assist- ance in conducting research for this article.

Debate has flourished in the pages of this magazine, questioning the correctness of the boycott, its impact on the apartheid system, and the appropriate course for independent film- makers.* It is imperative that we put the boycott in proper perspective, look at its history, pur- pose, and reason for existence, and realize why it is central in the battle to destroy apartheid and advance cultural, as well as political national liberation. Apartheid cannot be compared to the racial segregation that characterized the southern United States for the last few centuries. Nor can it be mistaken for the racial discrimination that people of color experience in the northern in- dustrial centers. Codified in 1948, apartheid is a legally sanctioned system of economic, political, and cultural domination and oppression, authorized by the South African government to safeguard its class interests and privileges, im- posed on 72 percent of its population on the basis of color. Since then, the white majority in South Africa has enacted over 200 racist laws designed to disenfranchise and dehumanize the Black, Indian and other Asian populations, leaving the Black majority entrenched as cheap labor in an exploitative economic system. The white minority of approximately four million , about 1 8 percent of the total population , \"Ed. 's note: In the June 1984 issue of The Indepen- dent, a one paragaph item summarized the response of the African National Congress to solicitations of the films for the Durban International Film Festival. Consistent with its cultural boycott strategy, the ANC counselled nonparticipation. In a letter published in the September 1984 Independent, pro- ducer Robert Mugge argued against the ANC posi- tion, defending his choice to show his films at festivals in South Africa, hoping \"to provide whatever small encouragement I can to the forces of resistance in an oppressed society.\" Mugge's letter was then reprinted, without permission from The In- dependent, in the Journal of the South African Film and Television Technicians Association. Replies tak- ing issue with Mugge and supporting the cultural boycott, from Gerald Home, St. Clair Bourne, and Mable Haddock, appeared in the November 1984 and March 1985 issues of The Independent, along with one, by David Appleby, in favor of ignoring the boycott. 16 THE INDEPENDENT governs South Africa through its elected representatives. The parliament is tricameral on- ly on paper; only the white chamber, elected by whites only, holds real power. Indeed since col- onialization, the white minority has always as- sumed authority over the entire country. Without consultation or negotiation with the Black majority, the whites unilaterally decided which parts of the country should be Black and which white. Whites gave themselves 86.3 per- cent of the land and the remaining 13.7 percent to the Black population. No land was allocated to the Asian or Indian peoples, who account for about 15 percent of the total population. In 1959, that 13.7 percent was divided into 10 \"Bantu Homelands,\" or Bantustans, with the passage of the \"promotion of Bantu Self- Government Act.\" These rural ghettos have been labeled \"homelands\" for about 16 million Black Africans. The Bantustans have separate governments with limited powers: legislative assemblies comprised of appointed chiefs, head- men, and elected members. Government propa- ganda insists that the Bantustans are indepen- dent and economically self-sufficient. As part of a series of expensive newspaper supplements placed in the U.S. press, one New York Times advertisement in the late seventies claimed that \"six of the Black nations living in South Africa already have local self-government in their historical homelands,\" and that \"the per capita income of the Xhosa nation (Transkei) and of the Zulu nation (kwaZulu) — both Bantustans — is considerably higher than that of many in- dependent African countries.\" These claims, intended to elicit support from U.S. racists and separatists, are misleading. So- called \"self-government\" for these reservations for Black Africans is a fraud. For instance, although the Transkei has had \"self-govern- ment\" for almost 25 years, the national white minority government holds all power. The Tran- skei Legislative Assembly cannot discuss major questions, and all decisions, no matter how trivial, must be approved by Pretoria. The Board of the Xhosa Development Corporation, which is responsible for the economic development of the Transkei, includes no representative of the Transkei government. The bantustans are totally incapable of sup- porting their inhabitants. To survive, those who can must seek migrant labor contracts and spend most of their lives separated from their families. In the past 20 years, 3.5 million people have been uprooted from their homes in areas designated \"white.\" Two million are now under the threat of removal. A total of 5. 5 million, more than the The art reproduced in these pages, part ot the Art Against Apartheid campaign, helps spread the word about the anti-apartheid struggle. Above: \"Take One,\" by Emma Amos. Courtesy Art Against Apartheid JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 of South Africa total white population in the country, will be relocated under this merciless act. As for living standards, the per capita income of the Xhosa people, for instance, is approximately $42 a month, the maximum average paid to unskilled workers in the Transkei. Even the village heads, or chiefs, receive between $18 and $53 a month. Actually, the government's propaganda about the \"homelands\" conceals the important fact that only about seven million of South Africa's 16 million Blacks reside on these reser- vations. The other nine million live in the misnamed \"white\" areas, where they out- number four million whites and two million In- dians and other Asian people. The government emphasizes the \"homelands\" theme to support its false claim that European and Black African settlers reached South Africa at about the same time, and the \"homelands\" or Bantustans were the only areas ever settled by Black Africans. But this contradicts documented history and ethnol- ogy. Stone ruins of the ancient kraals of Black Africans date from six centuries before the first Europeans arrived and still stretch across the gold-rich Transvaal and Orange Free State. In South Africa, labor is cheap and profits high. South Africa's apartheid policies are based on the demand for large pools of cheap labor. With such labor readily available, the vast mineral resources can be tapped for the benefit of white South African capital and foreign inves- tors. In diamond mining, the industry where most Blacks are employed, the average monthly wage for Black workers is $260; the average wage for white workers is $ 1 ,290. Africans who do this work are permitted to remain in the white areas where every movement is governed by a maze of laws. One very durable law — the \"Organiza- tional Movement and Settlement of Black Per- sons Act,\" enacted in various forms since 1960 — strips Blacks and other people of color of any human rights concerning where they live. Blacks can be forcibly removed from their homes, often with little advance warning and severe penalties for disobedience. The regime's goal is to gradually unload South Africa's Blacks onto bantustans, all of which will eventually be called \"independent.\" In reality, this means that Africans will be stripped of their nationality and arbitrarily classified as citizens of fictitious coun- tries on the basis of their ethnic ancestry, even if they have never visited the bantustans. Aside from the shocking equation — 87 per- cent of the most productive land reserved for 18 percent of the people, with the more barren 14 percent set aside for the 72 percent Black ma- jority— the government's justification for this JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 division rests on the main tenet of apartheid: the differences between the races are fixed by Almighty God for eternity, and these differences must be maintained by separation of the races. An increased militancy has erupted in the ban- tustans, protesting the substandard health con- ditions and facilities that rural residents endure and the inferior educational system for Black children. A backlash against the many local chieftains, who are merely puppet agents hand- picked by the government to maintain the apart- heid structure by presiding over a sham as- sembly, has prompted them to desert their posts to save their own skins. They are viewed as traitors, and many have been publicly condemn- ed and even mysteriously killed. But unified pro- tests against these conditions have brought government retaliations to the bantustans, in the form of severe and arbitrary rent and utility in- creases: more of the same misery at a higher price. Under South Africa's Internal Security Act of 1982, any person can be held in detention in- definitely without trial or formal charges. The government can automatically outlaw any or- ganization it says threatens the public order. The government can stop the printing and distribu- tion of any periodical or newspaper. The govern- ment can enforce random police searches. In the last five years, and especially during the last two, the government has escalated its war game of us- ing the resettlement policy, banning orders (any person can be exiled from his or her home in- definitely and may never be in the company of more than one person at a time), influx control laws (which punish the illegal passage of Blacks from the rural to the urban areas to find work; since 1916 more than 18 million people have been detained for this \"crime\"), or failure to produce the passbook that all Blacks over 16 must carry at all times, with records of employment, permits to enter white areas, and a description of family status. Black workers have stepped up their waves of organized protests with illegal stikes and shut- downs, mass demonstrations, and major con- frontations with the South African police, the most repressive and well-equipped in the world. From September to November 1984 about 150 people were killed at Sebokengs; 225 people in February 1985 at Crooroads, and at Langas in March 1985, 45 people were killed exactly 25 years after the Sharpeville massacre, where fr9 defenseless people were shot down and 180 wounded in a peaceful march against the pass law system. A state of emergency was declared in July THE INDEPENDENT 17 1985. And with it, an inevitable twist has developed in the strategy of South African war- fare: bloody and murderous raids on \"soft targets\" — residential areas that are branded suspect headquarters for \"rebel\" leaders. In late summer 1985, the men, women, and children of the Gabarone township were bombed in their sleep, their homes burned to the ground. Many who managed to survive were tortured. In these instances, the government unleashes its mighty army, which along with the police and special commando units, totals about 275,000. In addi- tion to the 700 who have died in the last year, almost 3,000 people have been detained since the state of emergency was announced. Thousands more have been arrested, including most leaders of the United Democratic Front, a nonracial alliance at the forefront of the anti-apartheid protest; members of the Congress of South African Students, a militant high school organization; and suspected members or friends of the banned African National Congress, the recognized cultural, political, and spiritual leader of the liberation movement in South Africa. The ANC was founded in January 1912 \"to defend Africans against repression.\" In the early years, its orientation was reformist rather than revolutionary, and it tried to achieve its goals through legal political action only. In 1961, Nelson Mandela, a leader of the group, formed Umkhonto We Sizwe, which means Spear of the Nation in Zulu, the ANC's military wing that began a campaign of sabotage against \"the sym- bols of apartheid.\" When South African police discovered its underground headquarters in 1963, the principal ANC leaders were arrested, and Mandela was sentenced to life in prison. For the past two decades, international governments and renowned citizens have petitioned South Africa for release of this revered leader, but the government has been steadfast in its refusal. During the many periods of unrest last summer, the government offered Mandela a release if he agreed to disavow violence and leave South Africa. But he is as steadfast in denouncing the apartheid system now as he was in 1964, and re- mains behind bars. After the Sharpeville and Soweto massacres in the sixties, the ANC developed a more revolu- tionary program within South Africa to defend itself and the oppressed majority against the per- vasive militarism of the South African govern- ment. The role of armed struggle in the libera- tion of South Africa has been criticized by many on principle. But all cultures, in some way, con- done the use of physical violence for self- defense. To deny the right of the Black majority in South Africa to use violence in its fight against the extremely degrading conditions of apartheid is to deny a most fundamental human right — the right to defend one's family and oneself against assault. The forces fighting for a nonracial socie- ty, that is, a democracy for all South African people regardless of race, color, or creed, relied on nonviolent methods for over half a century and only resorted to armed struggle after it became clear that the government would make no concessions to peaceful protest. Against this historical background of oppression, fear, flagrant violations of rights to health care, education, employment, and even the right of self-defense, the people of South Africa battle for liberation and the destruction of apartheid. Over the last 30 years, the United Nations has sweated volumes of resolutions attempting to impose limited sanctions against South Africa. In 1968, the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 2396, requesting \"all states and organizations to suspend cultural, educational, sporting and other exchanges with the racist regime \"A 1980 resolution appealed directly to \"writers, artists, musicians, and others to boycott South Africa\" for the first time. It plac- ed a cultural boycott in the context of a total campaign to isolate the South African govern- ment internationally. The cultural boycott is designed as a tactical weapon to destabilize South Africa's access to cultural enrichment in the world. Those of us who comprehend the boycott's strategic importance criticize the artists who are unwilling to deploy a political weapon that can destabilize apartheid. We don't accept the argu- ment that this is an amputation of cultural ex- changes that might magically stimulate oppress- ed people to victory. Still, it's clear that there are many artists who do not understand apartheid or its political apparatus. Filmmakers who send their films to festivals in South Africa, presum- ing that South Africans will benefit from our culture, cast themselves as liberal mechanics who blindly refuel a bad and worn-out machine. If you perform in South Africa, send your work there, or participate in cultural or educational exchange programs, you deny the priorities of the liberation struggle and the international anti- apartheid movement: the right of self-deter- mination for the South African people and the total isolation of the South African government to achieve that right. The cultural boycott is a pivotal move toward those ends. However, like other, related anti-apartheid strategies — the sports boycott and the divestment cam- paign— the cultural boycott encounters for- midable opposition. At the heart of the isolation strategy, the cultural boycott has been devalued and its goals undermined by the South African propaganda machine. Efforts to placate apartheid have con- centrated on placing ads in the western media, particularly in the U.S. and Britain. In 1984-1985 alone, millions were spent on public relations campaigns that misrepresent apartheid and the challenges to it, both inside and outside \"Swapo I,\" by Kathy Deacon. Courtesy Art Against Apartheid the country. Representative of the South Africa consulate in New York City, Abe Hoppenstein, has hopped from radio to TV to newspapers defending petty reforms and their promises, and assailing actions like divestiture and the cultural boycott. His objective is to preserve the status quo at any cost. The cultural boycott in the U.S. has affected the attitudes of big-name personalities who were once hooked on South Africa, but after ex- posure, took the pledge. If the moral argument against apartheid failed to convince an artist or 18 THE INDEPENDENT JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 ■\"■'■■■■'■■'■ ' \" ■■■,.■■■■■■■■ w'';<Vw:-'.Cv>-W '-:v- '■■■■'. /■'«::.,.,:■. '■'\" athlete — the two big prizes in apartheid eyes — to forfeit collaboration by not performing, these boycott busters would end up losers at the box office or the gate. Singer Stephanie Mills is the best example of a well-known artist who took money for performing in South Africa and then ran back to the U.S., invoking her \"right as a free agent in the marketplace.\" But the rising heat of domestic condemnation burned her at the box office and record stores. Eventually this pressure forced her to reconsider and make a public apology. Conversely, international enter- JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1986 tainers Roberta Flack and Stevie Wonder wouldn't court South Africa for the $2.5 million and $5 million offered, respectively, because their opposition to apartheid could not be bought off. Sometimes, however, the effort to win sup- port for the cultural boycott over the years has been haphazard and nearsighted. For example, there has been a dearth of educational programs for the public outside of the constituencies of organizations like churches, trade unions, political groups, and narrow venues of cultural exchange. The same groups have historically represented the bulk of the small but growing anti-apartheid movement in this country, and consequently have faced gargantuan limitations. The realities of no money, no resources, no organizational or administrative planning, no media expertise — or very little — have hindered the boycott's overall success. But, in the last five years, there has been a steady surge of participation among profes- sionals and cultural workers in music, dance, and the visual, literary, and media arts. A welcome blossoming of organizations and coali- tions speak directly to artists with different levels of influence and spunk. Some of these include the organization Artists and Athletes against Apartheid and the Art Against Apartheid cam- paigns in the U.S., as well as various ad hoc groups endorsed by the U.N. Special Committee against Apartheid. Some credit for the spreading support for the cultural boycott in the U.S. should be given to the visibility of artists like Harry Belafonte, who has spoken out against apartheid for decades and has spearheaded many campaigns and the commitment of those like Stevie Wonder and Roberta Flack. Their actions have helped con- vince other celebrities and artists who want to take an active stand against apartheid. Also, the growing divestment campaigns that have taken root on college campuses and in church basements, union halls and state and city legislatures around the country have contributed to the goals of the cultural boycott and the anti- apartheid movement as a whole. The South African government is suffocating because of its isolation. One of its cultural diamonds in the rough, the Durban Film Festival, testifies to its fear of international ostracism. Festival director Ros Sarkin, the wife of a distinguished South African surgeon, is repre- sented in an interview in the Journal of the South African Film and Television Technicians Associ- ation as one of the most sacrificing film pioneers. According to this article, she has almost singlehandedly enlarged her humble film festival from an event with seven films to a major South African cultural affair in seven years. Durban \"sells some 40,000 tickets. . . show[ing] about 50 films from all over the world,\" according to another article in the SAFTTA Journal. Indeed, 1985, the year of the most public activity around the cultural boycott and the call to end apart- heid, has been Sarkin's best. This spring the Durban Festival received \"a record number of U.S. entries,\" according to an article in the New York Times. The kind of publicity that Sarkin's festival can generate in the Times legitimates apartheid and diffuses international pressure at a time when pre"
