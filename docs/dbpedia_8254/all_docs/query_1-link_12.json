        "text": "Lead researcher and editor: Amy Brouillette Contributing researcher and editor: Joost van Beek Editorial assistant: Rian Wanstreet Project advisor: Kate Coyer Project coordinator: Éva Bognár This study analyses the consistency of Hungarian media regulations with European practices and norms, addressing a key international policy debate regarding the conformity of Hungary’s new media legislation to European and EU media-regulation standards. In December 2010 and January 2011, the Hungarian Government released two statements which summarised the main criticisms that had been leveled at the newly passed media laws and responded by citing examples of regulations from 20 European and EU-member states as precedents. For this study, the Center for Media and Communication Studies (CMCS) at Central European University commissioned media policy experts in each of these 20 countries to examine every example cited by Hungary’s Government. The findings of this report are based on the expert assessments of these examples. The purpose of this study is to examine the accuracy of the precedents cited by the Hungarian Government in order to shed light on the more critical question of how consistent Hungary’s media laws are with other media systems in Europe. The study finds that Hungary’s media laws are largely inconsistent with the cited European practices and norms, based on an examination of the legal precedents provided and on the expert analyses of how these precedents are implemented in these European and EU-member countries. In a majority of examples, experts report that the Hungarian Government’s references omit or inaccurately characterise relevant factors of the other countries’ regulatory systems, and as a result, the examples do not provide sufficient and/or equivalent comparisons to Hungary’s media regulation system. In many examples, the Hungarian Government accurately presents a portion of a legal provision or regulation, however, in these cases the reference either excludes elements of how the regulation is implemented or the regulation cited does not correspond with the scope and powers of Hungary’s media laws or Media Authority. Overall, this study finds that the European media regulations cited by the Hungarian Government do not serve as adequate precedents for Hungary’s new media laws. The study also reveals a wide disparity in media-regulation policies among European and EU-member states and highlights some key deficiencies in a number of other European systems that may inhibit press freedom in ways that do not appear to conform to European free-press norms."
