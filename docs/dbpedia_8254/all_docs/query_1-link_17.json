        "text": "Since the 1980s, trade unions have suffered a decrease in membership, public legitimacy and the capacity to achieve their core objectives. Renewal strategies have varied, depending on the national context. Part of them focused on rank-and-file mobilization and social movement unionism. In the Greek context, the academic discussion about the crisis of trade unions took place mainly during the 2000s, but without having an impact within union circles or on union strategies. Additionally, grassroots and rank-and-file unions that adopted a social movement and radical unionism approach, and contested the 'institu-tionalized official' trade unions, remained marginal and their actions were not very visible. The recent fiscal crisis and the implementation of the Memoranda brought up previous dysfunctions. In a context of increasing employment precarity and unemployment, the general position of official trade unions towards contingent workers and the unemployed has been strongly contested, while grassroots rank-and-file unions claim a more active role in this area. Given the above considerations, this article focuses on the strategies of trade unions towards contingent workers and the unemployed, in the Greek context. Results derive from interviews with Greek grassroots trade unionists and labour activists in the framework of the TransSOL (Transnational Solidarity at Times of Crisis) EU-funded program.\n\nThe article sums up the results of research oriented to analyze dynamics and outputs related to the development of two different technological parks in the North-East of Italy: the Area Science Park of Trieste and the Vega of Venezia. The research has tried to find an answer to the following question: what is the regulation model more efficient to implement good innovation policies? The article argues that, to achieve an efficient innovation governance, it is needed a strong regulation by the innovation broker â€“ the central hub of the innovation network, able to support interactions among innovation-makers and innovation-takers. To test this hypothesis, the empirical research has used both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. In the Area Science Park, good innovation performance appears strictly connected to strong regulation of the technological transfer process. In the Vega, differently, low innovation performances are combined with weak innovation regulation. The paper concludes that institutional settings at the local level can be powered by a model of governance innovation able to combine autonomous interactions among main actors involved in technological innovation with a strong regulation of the process by the innovation broker.\n\nThis chapter contains the main findings of a literature review on the subject of smart industrial relations. It aims to identify recent trends in the manufacturing, automotive and chemicals sectors in western European countries (Belgium, France, Scandinavia and the UK) and identify the main features of smart production. It also highlights positive experiences, focusing in particular on collaborative manufacturing practices. It gives details of three company case studies of innovative working, from the UK, Belgium and France. It examines whether these types of practices can make a difference to production outcomes and competitiveness, what the social partners can do to help develop smart industrial relations, and whether good practice examples can be transferred across borders."
