So most of the electricity is carbon fuels based. Only nuclear stations and hydro are in this sense produce non-carbon based electricity.\n\nSolar and Wind does not produce much yet, and are not that economical as useful life of solar panels is limited; wind turbines are better but also has a share of complex problems (high voltage lines connecting the various areas of the country is one, the necessity to build \"compensating\" natural gas power stations is another). Both need a lot of hydrocarbons to burn to be produced.\n\nLithium batteries useful life is around ten years. So they are consumables much like petrol in regular cars. Cost of an 85 kW/h Tesla battery is around $12K or $1.2K a year. Few people understand that.\n\nAdd to this the cost of charging infrastructure (which need to be built) and which also needs some hydrocarbons to be burned (a petrol infrastructure is already in place in most countries) and you will see that the promise of fully electric cars is open to discussion.\n\nHybrids look a lot more promising. At least for now. Biodiesel is a more promising option for tracks (and the diesel engine can last 50 years, not ten), but its supplies are very limited.\n\nSo this is a complex engineering problem, and only complete idiots can cry \"Viva electric cars.\"\n\nIf you add the energy necessary to produce the battery every ten years and losses in electrical transmission, the battery itself and charging, the electric car is not that economical. It is just one way to allow natural gas and cal to power the personal transportation cars and that gives us that ability to prolong the useful life of modern civilization.\n\nThose of us who are over 60 are very lucky and most probably will not see coming end of \"cheap oil\" and associated crisis of modern civilization.\n\nWhen Musk recently promised an electrical truck that can beat diesel truck by 20% per mile in \"the overall cost of ownership\" at the current level of oil prices, he is either a genius, or an adventurist completely detached from reality. I would be happy if his promises materialize, but I suspect the latter is more plausible.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/17/elon-musk-tesla-electric-truck-sports-car-surprise\n\nThe battery for the truck to provide 500 miles range should be huge (500 KW/h or more; assuming 1 mile per KWh; Tesla S which is a medium car consumes 0.3 ) and this additional weight will kill most of the electrical motor efficiency. Weight of Tesla S with 75KWh battery is around 4600 lbs. If we assume that battery is around 33% of the weight of the electrical car, then the weight of battery is 1500 lbs. And that's a very charitable assumption. It might well be 50%. So the battery of the Tesla truck can weight around (500/75)*1500 lbs or around 3 tons. That means that like a passenger electrical car, the electrical truck is somewhat loaded even when it is empty, and will transport only 7 tons of cargo instead of 10 tons for a regular truck.\n\nAs for being gifted engineer that does not exclude him from being an adventurist. I saw several very talented programmers, who slipped into this hole. One got a prison sentence. There is something in the US air that increase sensitivity of people, especially immigrants, to \"make money fast\" schemes and technical adventurism. That's actually the spirit of Silicon Valley ;-).\n\nAs far as I understand even in California passenger electrical cars can't beat hybrids in \"per mile\" cost of ownership, although they can come close.\n\nIn NJ total cost of ownership of a good Hybrid like RAV4 for 10 years and 12K miles per year (assuming $2.5 per gallon and 30 miles per gallon) is around $44K. That's around one half of the initial price of Tesla S 100D ($94K) with range 335 miles. Electricity and maintenance for 10 years is extra...\n\nHow much does the battery in the Tesla Model S weigh\n\nA pre-production estimate by a forum member is 535-556 kg.\n\nI am pro-EV guys (I would prefer one with the backup engine like GM or Toyota, but this isn't a point). My main problem with Tesla 3 is -- too much software. Tesla is Microsoft of EV cars. Would you like your can to get software updates that affect breaking system from the organization led by such an unbalanced and over-concerted with stock value man as Musk?\n\nIf we assume that cheap oil will end in, say, 20-30 year -- so those who are in their 30th might see $20 per gallon of gas. In this case switch to EV and other alternatives is just a matter of time. And the first step to avoid the total collapse of the US civilization with it suburbia sprawl will be switch to EVs for personal transportation. I think a couple of countries already made decision not to allow sales of traditional gas-only small cars since 2020 -- only hybrids and EVs. Which is somewhat premature (they can be converted to natural gas), but the USA elite looks pretty backward. Unable to think more then a election cycle timeframe.\n\nBTW in 2001 Larry Wall used to drive 1977 Honda Accord. https://lwn.net/2001/features/LarryWall/\n\nI still drive my 1977 Honda Accord. The paint is almost all worn off. It's still running.\n\nI can admire this man at least for the level of resistance the neoliberal social pressures in this area \"buy, buy, buy\". I would not do it myself as I hate to repair the car at dealerships and I view German luxury cars as overcomplicated, and Japanese luxury models overpriced. Still I will be first to admit that if you have extra money a good luxury car like Lexus, Acura or Infinity simplifies life (you get replacement car in case something breaks, service is more polite and responsive, they wash and vacuum your car each time you have service, coffee is better and you can get cappuccino, if you like, etc).\n\nStill for status concerted home owners in California with its moderate climate and no winter Tesla 3 as deficient as it is, might be an OK car. For East Coast only hybrids needs to apply -- the winter is too harsh and if you travel to NYC 50 miles and then wait for in traffic 4 hours with the outside temperature -15 and strong wind to cross the bridge to NYC you might run out of 60 KW battery as the heater consumes around 10 KW/h in such a weather.\n\nHere are some interesting doomsday predictions for your reading pleasure ;-). it will be interesting to see what percentage of them might materialize, or if a more cautious assessment will turn out correct\n\nThorfinnsson says: May 25, 2018 at 4:10 pm GMT\n\nOn a different note, Tesla is going to zero. The company has a number of severe problems:\n\nTesla is burning through one billion per quarter and is likely to run out of cash this year\n\n It is the only company of its size (in the market) offering high yield debt and stock offerings to accredited investors (which do not require SEC disclosure)\n\n Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly refused to meet with Elon Musk when he was in Saudi Arabia\n\n Elon Musk has violated federal securities, labor, and OSHA laws\n\n Musk and many other current and former executives have signed false documents and thus committed perjury\n\n The Model 3 is a disaster and was panned by Consumer Reports, Car and Driver, and Edmunds\n\n The self-dealing merger with Solar City would likely not have been approved by shareholders without Musks vaporware demonstration of solar roof tiles that do not exist (securities fraud)\n\n Half of Teslas output is exported, leaving it very vulnerable to trade retaliation\n\n Quality problems continue to be severe, and Tesla has now resorted to partnering with local body shops for post-production fixes\n\n Extreme shortage of spare parts means Teslas can be out of service for months\n\n Tesla takes months to refund customer deposits\n\n Numerous accounting problems, leading to 86 questions from the SEC for the last fiscal year, compared to zero for Ford Motor\n\n Tesla autopilot units keep crashing\n\n Highest accident and fatality statistics in its vehicle class (new luxury vehicles)\n\n Model S wheels and suspensions keep cracking\n\n Difficulty of exiting vehicle in the absence of electrical power (no mechanical door handles) led to children literally being burned alive\n\n A flood of competition is inbound, including the 600 horsepower Porsche Misson-E going into production at Zuffenhausen next year\n\n Teslas zero emission credits are set to expire, just as other automakers start harvesting them\n\nEvery freely available share is now short -- not joking. You cant even short the stock anymore generally, though puts are of course available.\n\nMusk himself is likely to be personally wiped out as well, as he has borrowed against 40% of his shares. Hell face a very ugly margin call when the stock starts sliding. Additionally, hes likely to personally face both civil and criminal liability.\n\nIMHO Musk assumes that he can dictate his will to other people despite the limits of technology (and electrical cars in many aspects, especially in power-train aspects are still developing technology in my book. I also heard that the Model 3s factory variable cost (FVC) to be $1,510 above its $35,000 starting price (https://electrek.co/2016/04/26/tesla-model-3-battery-pack-cost-kwh/ ).\n\nI suspect that Tesla 3 appeared on the scene too early for a mass produced fully electrical car.\n\nMusk probably should stick to luxury segment longer, where he has some limited success, despite all the problems. As for mass produced electrical cars it look like rumors about Musk being genius are greatly exaggerated :-)\n\nBTW Consumer Reports said the vehicle's stopping range is far worse than other cars tested. It's even longer than that of a Ford F-150 pick-up truck. Big NO to the car.\n\nAnd even in luxury segment Musk will have a strong competition soon: the next year on high end ($100K plus) Porsche might take Tesla models for a ride -- the Porsche Misson-E car has several really interesting concepts in it\n\nhttps://www.porsche.com/usa/aboutporsche/christophorusmagazine/archive/374/articleoverview/article01/\n\nNEWS CONTENTS\n\n20210721 : Damage Control- Elon Musk Admits Cybertruck Could -Flop-, Writes Off Summon Feature As Just A -Fun Trick- - ZeroHedge ( Jul 18, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210720 : Damage Control- Elon Musk Admits Cybertruck Could -Flop-, Writes Off Summon Feature As Just A -Fun Trick- - ZeroHedge ( Jul 18, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210703 : Bolshevik volutarism in XXI century: Canada To Ban Sale of New Fuel-Powered Cars and Light Trucks From 2035 ( Jul 03, 2021 , news.slashdot.org )\n\n20210612 : New Renewable Fuel Might be 3 Times More Powerful Than Gasoline ( Jun 07, 2021 , finance.yahoo.com )\n\n20210607 : New Renewable Fuel Might be 3 Times More Powerful Than Gasoline ( Jun 07, 2021 , finance.yahoo.com )\n\n20210528 : The US Is Not Ready For An All-Electric Future - ZeroHedge ( May 20, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210528 : \"Not a chance' Tesla will dominate car industry in 20 years- legendary investor Bruce Greenwald ( May 26, 2021 , finance.yahoo.com )\n\n20210514 : Autopilot Was Engaged In Fatal SoCal Tesla Wreck Earlier This Month, Authorities Reveal ( May 14, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210509 : German Institute Develops 'Powerpaste' That Stores Hydrogen Energy At 10x the Density of a Lithium Battery ( May 09, 2021 , hardware.slashdot.org )\n\n20210507 : Dramatic Footage Shows Deadly Crash Of Tesla Slamming Into Truck In China - ZeroHedge ( May 07, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210502 : Electric Car Owners Switching to Gas Because Charging Is a Hassle- Study by Dominick Reuter ( Apr 30, 2021 , www.businessinsider.com )\n\n20210422 : Congressmen, Consumer Reports Raise Concerns Over Tesla's Autopilot ( Apr 22, 2021 , www.wsj.com )\n\n20210312 : I am looking forward to seeing the mental gymanstics required to promote electric transportation despite the chronic shortage of raw materials required for batteries ( Mar 12, 2021 , www.nakedcapitalism.com )\n\n20210205 : The \"Battery Fairy\" Other Delusions In The Race To Replace Gas-Powered Cars ( Feb 05, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20210127 : Are EVs Good For The Environment- ...Mostly Not ( Jan 27, 2021 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20200924 : Flip-side of modern tech- Tesla app outage LOCKS drivers out of cars, as carmaker sues Trump administration over China tariffs -- RT World News ( Sep 24, 2020 , www.rt.com )\n\n20191230 : Another Fatal Wreck Two Dead After Tesla Runs Red Light, Slams Into Vehicle Near LA ( Dec 30, 2019 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20191229 : Shocking Photos Two Seriously Injured After Tesla Slams Into Parked Firetruck (Again) ( Dec 29, 2019 , www.zerohedge.com )\n\n20190902 : I see EVs and modern ICE vehicles as too complicated, even though they seem quite reliable for a few hundred K Km.

Birthday boy Elon Musk's most controversial quotes\n\nme scrolling=\n\nThe walk back of history began with a mega-huge whopper about 2 weeks ago when, at the beginning of July, Musk admitted that Full-Self Driving - a non-existent feature customers have been paying for for a half-decade - was a \"hard problem\", casually dropping into conversation the idea that the company may not be anywhere close to meeting Musk's promises about FSD.\n\nAs a reminder, Musk said in 2019 he was \"very confident\" in predicting autonomous robotaxis \"next year\", which would have been 2020, which has now turned into \"last year\" and is six months away from being \"two years ago\". Earlier this year Tesla offered up another reality check when it admitted to regulators that it was still \"firmly in level 2\" autonomy.\n\n\"Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. I didn't expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect. Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality,\" Musk wrote on Twitter in early July.\n\nIt's a far cry from what Musk was saying years ago. \"Tesla will have over 1 million robotaxis on the road next year,\" Musk proclaimed in April of 2019, now more than 2 years ago.\n\nGreat, so you'll just issue refunds to everyone who has paid for the feature over the last 5 years, right?\n\nRegardless, even the latest much heralded update to Full Self Driving, which arrived about a month late and had been touted as a solution to the last beta, which was such a disaster it was pulled off the market quickly , appears to be more of the same: jerky movements, uncertain vehicle operation and constant necessary interruptions from the driver.\n\nAfter Full Self Driving 9.0's release, even the company's biggest fans like Galileo Russell said he saw little difference between the last beta and this one - and he still thinks the company is \"still a long way away\" to truly autonomous driving \"where you never have to intervene\".\n\nMusk Walks Back Cybertruck Expectations\n\nIn another walk-back and reset of expectations last week, Elon Musk also Tweeted that there was \"always some chance\" that the Cybertruck - a product introduced almost two years ago in November 2019 to ridiculous fanfare - could \"flop\".\n\nThis stands at obvious odds with statements Musk made in September at the company's shareholder meeting, where he said \"The orders are gigantic\" about the truck. Musk claimed there were \"... well over half a million orders.\" He continued: \"It's a lot, basically. We stopped counting.\"\n\nRecall, at the introduction of the Cybertruck, Musk had an assistant come on stage and try to break the truck's armored glass.\n\n\"Normal glass shatters immediately,\" Musk said as his assistants, dressed like characters from The Matrix, dropped a metal ball on conventional glass, causing it to shatter.\n\nAt which point another of Musk's assistants gently threw a similar metal ball at the Cybertruck parked on stage. The driver's side window promptly broke.\n\n\"Oh my fucking God,\" Musk nervously said, live on the stream, after the front window shattered into a million pieces.\n\nAre you not amused?\n\nAnd if this demo wasn't enough to \"manage expectations\", Musk is now admitting the truck could \"flop\".\n\nBut don't worry shareholders, Musk has your back. He Tweeted: \"To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. I don't care. I love it so much even if others don't. Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future.\"\n\nActually, it appears Musk doesn't have your back - it appears he's going to do whatever the hell he wants regardless of whether or not it's good for the company.\n\n\"In end, we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here & there to make it slightly better. No door handles. Car recognizes you & opens door.

Birthday boy Elon Musk's most controversial quotes\n\nme scrolling=\n\nThe walk back of history began with a mega-huge whopper about 2 weeks ago when, at the beginning of July, Musk admitted that Full-Self Driving - a non-existent feature customers have been paying for for a half-decade - was a \"hard problem\", casually dropping into conversation the idea that the company may not be anywhere close to meeting Musk's promises about FSD.\n\nAs a reminder, Musk said in 2019 he was \"very confident\" in predicting autonomous robotaxis \"next year\", which would have been 2020, which has now turned into \"last year\" and is six months away from being \"two years ago\". Earlier this year Tesla offered up another reality check when it admitted to regulators that it was still \"firmly in level 2\" autonomy.\n\n\"Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. I didn't expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect. Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality,\" Musk wrote on Twitter in early July.\n\nIt's a far cry from what Musk was saying years ago. \"Tesla will have over 1 million robotaxis on the road next year,\" Musk proclaimed in April of 2019, now more than 2 years ago.\n\nGreat, so you'll just issue refunds to everyone who has paid for the feature over the last 5 years, right?\n\nRegardless, even the latest much heralded update to Full Self Driving, which arrived about a month late and had been touted as a solution to the last beta, which was such a disaster it was pulled off the market quickly , appears to be more of the same: jerky movements, uncertain vehicle operation and constant necessary interruptions from the driver.\n\nAfter Full Self Driving 9.0's release, even the company's biggest fans like Galileo Russell said he saw little difference between the last beta and this one - and he still thinks the company is \"still a long way away\" to truly autonomous driving \"where you never have to intervene\".\n\nMusk Walks Back Cybertruck Expectations\n\nIn another walk-back and reset of expectations last week, Elon Musk also Tweeted that there was \"always some chance\" that the Cybertruck - a product introduced almost two years ago in November 2019 to ridiculous fanfare - could \"flop\".\n\nThis stands at obvious odds with statements Musk made in September at the company's shareholder meeting, where he said \"The orders are gigantic\" about the truck. Musk claimed there were \"... well over half a million orders.\" He continued: \"It's a lot, basically. We stopped counting.\"\n\nRecall, at the introduction of the Cybertruck, Musk had an assistant come on stage and try to break the truck's armored glass.\n\n\"Normal glass shatters immediately,\" Musk said as his assistants, dressed like characters from The Matrix, dropped a metal ball on conventional glass, causing it to shatter.\n\nAt which point another of Musk's assistants gently threw a similar metal ball at the Cybertruck parked on stage. The driver's side window promptly broke.\n\n\"Oh my fucking God,\" Musk nervously said, live on the stream, after the front window shattered into a million pieces.\n\nAre you not amused?\n\nAnd if this demo wasn't enough to \"manage expectations\", Musk is now admitting the truck could \"flop\".\n\nBut don't worry shareholders, Musk has your back. He Tweeted: \"To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. I don't care. I love it so much even if others don't. Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future.\"\n\nActually, it appears Musk doesn't have your back - it appears he's going to do whatever the hell he wants regardless of whether or not it's good for the company.\n\n\"In end, we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here & there to make it slightly better. No door handles. Car recognizes you & opens door. Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling & tight turns!\" Musk gushed about the truck, which is still not in production.\n\nSome critics not only believe the truck is already a \"flop\", but also that its claimed specs are outright fraudulent.\n\n\"This fraud is no different from those of Theranos or Nikola,\" Stanphyl Capital's Mark Spiegel wrote on Twitter last week.\n\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&embedId=twitter-widget-0&features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfX0%3D&frame=false&hideCard=false&hideThread=false&id=1416167167649779712&lang=en&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zerohedge.com%2Fmarkets%2Fdamage-control-elon-musk-revising-history-full-self-driving-cybertruck-expectations-and-now&sessionId=80bac2a05d98ce2ae84ed0a968bb7586e8e1d251&siteScreenName=zerohedge&theme=light&widgetsVersion=82e1070%3A1619632193066&width=550px\n\nTime will tell the tale.\n\nMusk Walks Back Years Of Bluster About \"Smart Summon\"\n\nAnd now, the most recent walk-back.

Reuters reports: Only zero-emissions cars and trucks can be sold from 2035, according to a statement, adding that a mixture of investments and regulations will help industry transition toward that goal. The government also said it will set interim targets for 2025 and 2030. \"We are committed to aligning Canada's zero-emission vehicles sales targets with those of the most ambitious North American jurisdictions,\" Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said in the statement. \"We will work with the United States to harmonize fuel efficiency regulations and we're investing in consumer rebates, charging stations, business tax breaks and industry transition costs,\" Wilkinson added.\n\n\"Canada cannot reach our greenhouse gas targets if emissions from cars, SUVs and pickups, which are currently growing, are not curtailed,\" said Keith Brooks, programs director at advocacy group Environmental Defence, who welcomed the move. Brooks said only 3.5% of vehicles now sold in Canada are electric and that the government needs to do more to support the market for zero-emissions vehicles.\n\nIt's very cold.

Many ICE cars don't even have the range do drive there as it is.\n\nWe have ice roads into northern communities that will soon (due to global warming) become an even larger network of vast, desolate roads. The cost of installing electric charging stations on these roads would be insurmountable. You're talking about tens , if not hundreds of thousands of kilometres of new high-tension power lines. We just wouldn't be able to put charging stations far enough out to make this feasible. So, sure, the vast majority of cars could be electric by 2035, not all of them can be. Therefore a ban is not a realistic solution.\n\nI don't see it happening in 25 years to travel for a thousand km, in the dead of winter, possibly towing a load. Is it possible? Sure.

Instead of burning half-hydrogen, half carbon, the power company energy comes entirely from carbon, and loses about 10-15% of that power in the lines themselves. Sure, your power company *might* be using a renewable energy source, but if they're not, your electric car is actually worse for the planet than a conventional ICE powered vehicle.\n\nBanning fuel powered vehicles is not the way to go. Instead, they should be looking into carbon-neutral gasoline, diesel, and ethanol powered vehicles.

The crash is still is under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a report from ABC noted on Friday.\n\nThe crash, which took place on May 5 in Fontana, killed the 35 year old driver after his Model 3 hit an overturned semi on the freeway. A second person was seriously injured after the Model 3 hit him, while he was trying to help the driver of the overturned semi.\n\nOn Thursday of this week, the California Highway Patrol announced that the car was operating on Autopilot, which has been no stranger to controversy involving fatal Tesla wrecks. This wreck marks at least the fourth death in the U.S. involving Autopilot.\n\nThe information was so important, the CHP felt, that they shared it despite the ongoing investigation, stating: \"While the CHP does not normally comment on ongoing investigations, the Department recognizes the high level of interest centered around crashes involving Tesla vehicles. We felt this information provides an opportunity to remind the public that driving is a complex task that requires a driver's full attention.\"\n\nJust days prior, the CHP arrested yet another Tesla driver who it said was in the back seat of his vehicle while it barreled down Interstate 80 near Oakland. Autopilot or Full Self Driving were assumed to be operating.\n\nThere is also an ongoing NHTSA investigation involving a fatal Tesla wreck that took place in Houston weeks ago. The NTSB has issued a preliminary report in that case, finding that a similar vehicle could have engaged Traffic Aware Cruise Control, but not Autosteer, at the point where the crash took place.\n\nThe NTSB concluded by stating that the investigation was ongoing and that it was working with Harris County Texas Precinct 4:\n\nThe NTSB continues to collect data to analyze the crash dynamics, postmortem toxicology test results, seat belt use, occupant egress, and electric vehicle fires. All aspects of the crash remain under investigation as the NTSB determines the probable cause, with the intent of issuing safety recommendations to prevent similar crashes. The NTSB is working alongside the Harris County Texas Precinct 4 Constable's Office, which is conducting a separate, parallel investigation.\n\nRecall, it was Mark Herman, Harris County Constable Precinct 4, who was most skeptical of Elon Musk's comments absolving Autopilot of liability last month, telling Reuters that the police served search warrants on Tesla to secure data from the Model S.\n\nResponding to Musk at the time, Herman said: \"If he is tweeting that out, if he has already pulled the data, he hasn't told us that. We will eagerly wait for that data.\"\n\n\"We have witness statements from people that said they left to test drive the vehicle without a driver and to show the friend how it can drive itself ,\" Herman said according to the Reuters report .\n\n[May 09, 2021] German Institute Develops 'Powerpaste' That Stores Hydrogen Energy At 10x the Density of a Lithium Battery\n\nMay 09, 2021 | hardware.slashdot.org\n\n(hackaday.com) 124 BeauHD on Monday February 08, 2021 @10:10PM from the clean-energy dept. A German research organization has developed a magnesium-based \" Powerpaste \" with an energy density ten times more than current battery technology . Hackaday reports: We've been promised hydrogen-powered engines for some time now. One downside though is the need for hydrogen vehicles to have heavy high-pressure tanks. While a 700 bar tank and the accompanying fuel cell is acceptable for a city bus or a truck, it becomes problematic with smaller vehicles, especially ones such as scooters or even full-sized motorcycles. The Fraunhofer Institute wants to run smaller vehicles on magnesium hydride in a paste form that they call POWERPASTE.\n\nThe idea is that the paste effectively stores hydrogen at normal temperature and pressure. At 250C, the paste decomposes and releases its hydrogen. While your motorcycle may seem hot when parked in the sun, it isn't getting quite to 250C. Interestingly, the paste only provides half the available hydrogen. The rest is from water added start a reaction to release the hydrogen. Fraunhofer claims the energy density available is greater than that of a 700 bar tank in a conventional hydrogen system and ten times more than current battery technology.\n\nOne thing that's attractive is that the paste is easy to store and pump. A gas station, for example, could invest $20-30,000 and dispense the paste from a metal drum to meet low demand and then scale up as needed. A hydrogen pumping setup starts at about $1.2 million. Fraunhofer is building a pilot production plant that will produce about four tons of the material a year.\n\n[May 07, 2021] Dramatic Footage Shows Deadly Crash Of Tesla Slamming Into Truck In China - ZeroHedge\n\nMay 07, 2021 | www.zerohedge.com\n\nThe honeymoon between Tesla and China continue to sour as the Global Times , China's closest major media organization to the state, published a horrifying image of a Tesla vehicle rear-ending a truck in Shaoguan, South China's Guangdong Province on Friday, \"killing the electric car's driver on the spot.\"\n\nTesla can't catch a break in China. If state media wanted to protect the US car company, they would've ignored the report; instead, they're drumming up bad press for Elon Musk.

Exactly why they didn't use the public stalls was not specified.\n\nEVs have come a long way in recent years in terms of range, safety, comfort, and tech features, but Hardman and Tal note that very little has changed in terms of how they are recharged.\n\nThe researchers warned that this trend could make it harder to achieve electric vehicle sales targets in California and other countries, and the growth of the market overall.\n\n[Apr 22, 2021] Congressmen, Consumer Reports Raise Concerns Over Tesla's Autopilot\n\nApr 22, 2021 | www.wsj.com\n\nTwo U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla Inc. TSLA -3.28% vehicles in the wake of a fatal crash in Texas.\n\nIn a letter Thursday to America's top automotive-safety regulator, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts urged the agency to develop recommendations for improving advanced driver-assistance systems such as Tesla's Autopilot.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a probe into the weekend crash , one of more than two dozen investigations it has launched into Tesla-involved crashes. The agency has said that most of those investigations are related to the vehicles' advanced driver-assistance features.\n\n\"We fear safety concerns involving these vehicles are becoming a pattern, which is incredibly worrisome and deserves your undivided attention,\" the Democratic senators wrote about Tesla in the letter, which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n... ... ...\n\nConsumer Reports on Thursday said it had done tests this week in which it was able to get a different Tesla model's Autopilot to operate without anyone in the driver's seat. The vehicle, which uses steering-wheel inputs to assess driver attention, didn't send any warnings about an empty driver's seat, Consumer Reports said. The organization attached a weight to a Model Y's steering wheel to simulate a hand during the testing.\n\n\"I was really shocked how easy it was to do it,\" said Jake Fisher, the group's senior director of auto testing, one of the people involved in the test-track experiment. \"When you have an automation system like that which explicitly needs a driver to be ready to take over at any time, you have to make sure that someone is actually engaged.\"\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the Consumer Reports finding.\n\n[Mar 12, 2021] I am looking forward to seeing the mental gymanstics required to promote electric transportation despite the chronic shortage of raw materials required for batteries\n\nMar 12, 2021 | www.nakedcapitalism.com\n\nEquitable > Equal , March 12, 2021 at 8:56 am\n\n[Feb 05, 2021] The \"Battery Fairy\" Other Delusions In The Race To Replace Gas-Powered Cars\n\nFeb 05, 2021 | www.zerohedge.com\n\nAuthored by Thomas Lifson via AmericanThinker.com,\n\nI continue to be amazed that serious people think that gasoline powered vehicles can be completely replaced by electric vehicles in a decade-and-a-half, and that this would be a good thing, even if possible. Under threat of government action, however, the world's major auto manufacturers are falling in line boosting production of plug-in models, and upstart Tesla Motors is now the world's most valuable auto manufacture, based on the value of its capital stock issued and in the public's hands. Mary T. Barra, CEO of General Motors, has pledged to sell only zero emission vehicles by 2035 . That would meet the deadline imposed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who signed an executive order banning the sale of internal combustion vehicles in the nation's largest car market by 2035.\n\nCharging electrric cars at work makes sense, as it rquires several hours. But what if you want to drive on a long trip? Photo credit: Felix Cramer CC-BY-SA 2.0 license\n\nGM, rescued from liquidation courtesy of US taxpayers (and bondholders who were cheated out of their place in line as creditors by the Obama administration), may simply be sucking up to governmental power. But Akio Toyoda, CEO of Toyota Motors, the world's largest (or second largest, depending on the year). and grandson of the automaker's founder, has spoken out and called out fallacy of thinking that this is possible or desirable. [I must here disclose that I was a consultant for a Toyota company for several years, but that all my comments on the company here are based on publicly available information.]\n\nAccording to this account in CarBuzz :\n\nAs the grandson of Toyota founder, Kiichiro Toyoda, the scion was raised surrounded by all aspects of the auto industry and his business acumen is second to none. So when he had some harsh words for electric vehicles at the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association end-of-year press conference last week, people took notice.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was in attendance and noted the CEO's disdain for EVs boils down to his belief they'll ruin businesses, require massive investments, and even emit more carbon dioxide than combustion-engined vehicles. \"The current business model of the car industry is going to collapse,\" he said. \"The more EVs we build, the worse carbon dioxide gets When politicians are out there saying, 'Let's get rid of all cars using gasoline,' do they understand this?\"\n\nStudies detailing the carbon emissions necessary to manufacture an electric vehicle reveal that on a net basis, there are more emissions for vehicle bought and used for its expected lifetime, than would be generated by buying and using a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle.\n\nToyota can certainly make electric powered vehicles. It introduced the hybrid Prius, after all, and has a strong position in that market. Toyota's mastery of the discipline of mass production of vehicles is such that it could do well no matter what power source is used. But the costs of complete conversion to electricity-powered vehicles are mind boggling.\n\nWhere will all, the electricity needed to power to entire fleet of cars in the US (or Japan) come from? Despite the fantasies of greenies, it won't be from windmills or solar farms. They are too unreliable, take up too much land, and cost too much. Right now, it is coal and natural gas that produce the most electricity at the most reasonable cost. And they emit CO2. Plus, there is considerable loss of power due to resistance in the transmission lines, requiring an even greater amount of gross power before the net power reaches the battery in the vehicle, charging at the user's home ort some other location. Nuclear power does offer some potential, but how many people want to live near the hundreds and hundreds of nuclear power plants that would be required to fuel the nation's vehicles?\n\nThen there is the small matter of batteries. The very large batteries needed for electric cars use lots of expensive lithium (and some other rare elements) whose supply is limited, and whose mining requires lots of scarce water. In fact, powering the world's vehicles by battery is simply impossible, given the limited world supply of lithium, as this clever post by Powerline's Steve Hayward makes clear. The title gives away the punchline:\n\nWHO WILL TELL THE GREENS THERE IS NO BATTERY FAIRY?\n\nFor the longest while I have been asking, \"Where do environmentalists and Democrats think all these batteries for our oil-free transportation fleet are going to come from?\" It seems they think there is a Battery Fairy out there somewhere who will magically supply the ginormous battery capacity, and additional supply of electricity to charge them, in order to deliver us to our blessed fossil-fuel-free future.\n\nHe cites an article in Wired, The Spiraling Environmental Cost of our Lithium Battery Addiction :\n\nBut there's a problem. As the world scrambles to replace fossil fuels with clean energy, the environmental impact of finding all the lithium required to enable that transformation could become a serious issue in its own right. \"One of the biggest environmental problems caused by our endless hunger for the latest and smartest devices is a growing mineral crisis, particularly those needed to make our batteries,\" says Christina Valimaki an analyst at Elsevier. . .\n\nIt's a relatively cheap and effective process, but it uses a lot of water – approximately 500,000 gallons per tonne of lithium. In Chile's Salar de Atacama, mining activities consumed 65 per cent of the region's water. That is having a big impact on local farmers – who grow quinoa and herd llamas – in an area where some communities already have to get water driven in from elsewhere. . .\n\nTwo other key ingredients, cobalt and nickel, are more in danger of creating a bottleneck in the move towards electric vehicles, and at a potentially huge environmental cost. Cobalt is found in huge quantities right across the Democratic Republic of Congo and central Africa, and hardly anywhere else. The price has quadrupled in the last two years.\n\nI am glad that some grownups are pointing out that the electric vehicle conversion emperor has no clothes on. But that hasn't stopped governments, manufacturers, and investors from pretending that electric vehicles are our only future.\n\nAs Herbert Stein famously said, \"If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\" We're only beginning to discover that about pipe dreams of an all-electric vehicle future.\n\n[Jan 27, 2021] Are EVs Good For The Environment- ...Mostly Not\n\nJan 27, 2021 | www.zerohedge.com\n\nAs to whether EVs are as environmentally friendly as many people claim is a topic that is hotly debated. The chart near the top of this article screams that they are not. Electricity demand is still rising across the world, most nuclear plants getting very old, and the most ecologically friendly sources are running full out. This means the slack is being taken up by fossil-fuel generated plants. Under the idea of, last in first out, this would mean that almost all the juice being pumped into EVs comes from fossil-fuel generated juice. To make matters worse, other issues exist.\n\nBelow are a few comments, or parts of comments, about EVs that have been gathered from different recent articles. I have not fully researched all these but they do add to my doubts about these vehicles.\n\nThe Greenwashing Industrial Complex is one of the evilest and fraudulent scams of the 21st century. As an example, the pollution and environmental destruction created by the manufacturing and disposal of EV batteries, and also the magnets for power-generating windmills, is 10X worse than pollution created by fossil-fuel vehicles.\n\nIn Germany about 40% of the energy mix is produced by coal and 30% by renewables - a mid-sized electric car must be driven for 125,000 km , on average, to break even with a diesel car, and 60,000 km compared to a petrol car. It takes nine years for an electric car to be greener than a diesel car, assuming an annual average mileage of 13,500 km. Most consumers will have bought a new car by then. The case is similar in the U.S. but less pronounced in nuclear-powered France .\n\nBattery production causes more environmental damage than carbon emissions alone. Consider dust, fumes, wastewater, and other environmental impacts from cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; water shortages and toxic spills from lithium mining in Latin America, which can alter ecosystems and hurt local communities; a heavily polluted river due to nickel mining in Russia; or air pollution in northeastern China, as mentioned above.\n\nThere isn't enough cobalt in the world to replace even half of the current ICE vehicles. Never mind the fact they have kids mining the stuff in the Congo. InsideSources , says, every EV battery contains cobalt, with most of it mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This area has been an ugly mess for years as the Congo government and armed militants duke it out over the control of mines. Much of the DRC cobalt is then hauled to South Africa and shipped to China for processing.\n\nAlso flowing into the issue of \" less damaging to the environment\" is something recently brought to my attention, and that is, EVs tend to rapidly eat through tires. While many people may not think this is a big deal, it is. Since electric car batteries are heavier than petrol engines they need a more robust tire. Also, because of their accelerating faster from a standstill. If you want to take advantage of that without too much wear then you need a more robust tire, these cost more, and it has been said, you are lucky if you get 20,000 miles out of a set of tires. All this is addressed at, https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-electric-cars-wear-out-tires-faster-than-fossil-fuel-cars\n\nPollution From Tires Is A Growing EV Issue\n\nLike many people I had forgotten or brushed aside the thought something as simple and common as the tire was such a problem. This should have been high on my radar because years ago I was given a building simply because it had been filled with tires. The officials in my city were all over the owner to get rid of them. It cost me a bit of money and a lot of work to have them hauled away and properly recycled. With that in mind, below are a few of the many articles voicing pollution issues concerning tires.\n\nHomeguides.sfgate.com claims; Toxins released from tire decomposition, incineration, or accidental fires can pollute the water, air, and soil. While 42 states regulate tire disposal to some degree, eight states have no restrictions on what you must do with your discarded tires. Even with laws in place, illegal dumping still occurs, presenting negative environmental impacts.\n\nTiretechnologyinternational.com states; Air pollution from tire wear particles can be 1,000 times worse than what comes out of a car's exhaust, Emissions Analytics found harmful particle matter from tires is a serious environmental problem. What is even more frightening is that while exhaust emissions have been tightly regulated for many years, tire wear is not. With the increasing growth in sales of heavier SUVs and battery-powered electric cars, non-exhaust emissions are a growing problem.\n\nAnd, www.politico.eu/article/tires , delves into how driving affects the environment in ways beyond the well-known pollutants spewing from tailpipes and leaking from engines. Tires shed tiny pieces of plastic as they wear down, accounting for about 10 percent of the microscopic pieces of the pollutant found in the sea, according to one estimate. Tire waste was addressed in the European Commission's Plastics Strategy earlier this year. The EU executive is looking into how to cut down on microplastics that may be coming from tires and is considering regulations.\n\nWith all the above in mind, the buzz in EV trading over the last couple of weeks has interestingly been surrounding legacy automakers like General Motors and, even Ford moving strongly in the direction of manufacturing more EVs. This may someday be seen as a huge environmental misstep. The best answer may be a shift to more efficient gasoline engines in smaller vehicles. 4,675 20 NE play_arrow\n\nthezone 20 minutes ago (Edited)\n\nHere in California the electric grid is near collapse.

And gas is 90 something percent efficient...i'm all for alternatives to fossil fuels but we gotta be realistic...we need to look at hydrogen... especially solar/hydrogen used together. This solar and wind power sht is the biggest monetary scam in history, and the electric vehicle scam might take it over.\n\nHC-CZ 5 minutes ago\n\nAgree on everything, but one part is missed. And it is a biggie.\n\nThe electricity required to power all the EVs in the world is much higher than what we use now. And since natural gas is frowned upon, the extra generating capacity is even higher. An electric cooktop is 8000 watts, your EV charger is about 9000 watts for the small ones.\n\nTherefore, the entire electrical grid would need to be replaced to have enough capacity to feed all these new electrical requirements.\n\nYouri Carma 17 minutes ago (Edited) remove link\n\nThen there is the issue of energy transition loss.\n\n1.

My God, even modern tire valve stems have batts and transmitters linked to idiot displays because people are now too stupid to check their tire inflation. Valve stem price $200 $300 per? Extrapolate to battery and propulsion software, (proprietary software), that stops all future jobber replacement parts beyond belts and fluids.\n\nAnyway, I have a rebuilt 1981 Westfalia that looks and runs like a dream. It is worth more than I have invested in it, in fact it is currently worth 7X what my showroom condition 2005 GMC work truck is worth, (The truck with 150,000 Km on it and maintained to new condition). The most complicated system on the Westie is a resistor pack \"running\" some intake temp sensors to adjust mixture mix on startup. My electronic tech buddy was looking to fix a friends jeep last week. The horn wouldn't work. He thought it was .well, a horn. No it isn't. It is a sending unit that transits to a brain box that sends a signal to a device that says, \"Make horn noise now\". Computerised, of course. My Father- in-law had some kind of Buick that would flash the occasional warning light about a door. Price to swap out the module? $900. Excess complexity needless complexity.\n\nI keep seeing a modern Mad Max in my head. Instead of an insanely laughing Mel Gibson hot wiring a fuel tanker we'll see a meter toting nerd testing leads and wires and asking if anyone can read this damn code?\n\nislandboy x Ignored says: 09/02/2019 at 9:38 am\n\nPaulo, your meter toting nerd is more likely going to be a nerd with a laptop, an OBD port dongle and a Controller Area Network Bus (CANBUS) sniffing setup, fuming about a strange (proprietary) implementation of the CANBUS protocol. My undestanding of the CANBUS arrangement is that all devices are attached to the Controller Area Network (CAN) and assigned a unique id. In the case of the friend's jeep, pressing the horn button results in a packet being sent across the CAN addressed to the horn. All devices on the network receive the packet but only the horn responds to it and switches on. I assume a second packet would switch it off.\n\nThe theory is that CANBUS should allow a single network/power cable to daisy chain to all the devices in the vehicle and control them, as opposed to having, for example, several wires to control three speed wipers with intermittent wiping as well. It remains to be seen how well CANBUS will stand the test of time but, it is likely to see increased adoption, especially with EVs.\n\nHickory x Ignored says: 09/02/2019 at 10:54 am\n\nHi Paulo,\n\nI share your concern about vehicles becoming too complex to fix with local skill/local machine, etc. I used to handle many repair tasks myself when younger, but things have become a complicated spaghetti mess under hood.\n\nAnd of course, this problem affects just about all kinds of vehicles built in past 3-4 decades. I'd guess well over 95% of the vehicles running around on the roads are 'fragile' due to complexity of the systems. EV maybe less so, since there are simply less systems at play.\n\nA guy in Germany has over 900,000 km on a Tesla. I'm guessing he had had to have the battery pack changed out, but didn't see that info.\n\nAnother issue along these lines is the energy supply line.\n\nWith Petrol, there a very complicated system to get the juice from the source rock to the target tank. Such as a refinery.\n\nThat looks very fragile to me.\n\nReliance on that kind of complex system in a chaotic world is very risky.\n\nThe supply line for electricity can be just as complex, but just like you point out the possibilities with the Westfalia, I point out that the electricity supply line can also be much simpler. If you have some equipment (dry solid material with no moving parts- PV panels, inverter, wiring/plug), your personal or local supply change for transport juice can be very short, and durable.\n\n[Aug 02, 2019] The Tesla global fleet also reached a total of 500,000 vehicles\n\nAug 02, 2019 | economistsview.typepad.com\n\nRC (Ron) Weakley -> mulp ... ,\n\n[Speaking of false dichotomies - ]\n\nhttps://electrek.co/2018/11/16/tesla-fleet-10-billion-electric-miles/\n\nTesla reaches 10 billion electric miles with a global fleet of half a million cars\n\nFred Lambert\n\n- Nov. 16th 2018 6:02 am ET\n\nTesla's global fleet is growing at a record pace and we now learn that it reached a total of 10 billion electric miles with half a million cars this week.\n\nBack in October 2016, we reported on Tesla reaching the 3 billion electric mile milestone and the company's global fleet managed to add 500 million more miles 3 months later – bringing the total to 3.5 billion in December and another half a billion more by March 2017.\n\nAt the time, Tesla's fleet was driving about 5 million miles a day on average.\n\nWe were able to track the progress through the Tesla road trip page and Tesla confirmed that its global fleet reached over 5 billion electric miles driven in July 2017.\n\nThe average went up to almost 7 million miles per day when Tesla slowly started Model 3 production.\n\nTesla removed the counter from the Tesla road trip page and we haven't been able to track the fleet mileage as consistently.\n\nBut a source familiar with the data point confirmed to Electrek that the fleet surpassed 9 billion total miles in September and at the time, Tesla drivers averaged almost 20 million miles per day – close to 4 times the average from just 2 years ago.\n\nAt the time, we noted that at that pace, the fleet would reach 10 billion miles before Thanksgiving and sure enough, the same source confirmed to Electrek that Tesla's fleet reached 10 billion electric miles yesterday.\n\nThe Tesla global fleet also reached a total of 500,000 vehicles around the world just a day before.\n\nElectrek's Take\n\nThat's a great milestone because it's 10 billion miles that would have been powered by gas or diesel and it's now powered by electricity.\n\nWhile it doesn't mean that it's always completely clean, it at least has the potential to be clean. Between my Model S and Model 3, I have several thousand miles of my own in this total and most of them were powered by clean hydro from Quebec.\n\nIt's the case for many other Tesla owners around the world and for those in places where electricity is still generated through polluting sources, EV owners are adding solar power at a higher rate, which is resulting in their cars being powered by the sun.\n\nI think it's truly an exciting time for electric vehicles and it's just the beginning. We are going to see many new models creating a lot of growth in the next few years and not just from Tesla.\n\nIf you are a Tesla owner, let us know in the comment section below how many miles you contributed to that 10 billion-mile milestone.\n\n*\n\n[In comparison, the total US vehicle miles driven each year is only about 3.2 trillion vehicle miles.]\n\n[Jun 12, 2019] Hybrid cars are more promising as they have much smaller battery and as such consume less rare elements per car\n\nNotable quotes:\n\n\"...

In the case of cobalt, of which 58 per cent is currently mined in the DR of Congo, it has helped fuel a conflict that has blighted the lives of millions, led to the contamination of air, water and soil, and left the mining area as one of the top 10 most polluted places in the world.\n\nIn a sense hybrid cars are more promising as they have much smaller battery and as such consume less rare elements per car.\n\nIt looks like the current stress on \"pure\" EV is really unhealthy and unscientific.\n\nGoneFishing, 06/11/2019 at 1:40 pm\n\nYou are right in your belief that people will not want to change their lifestyles, but they will, there will be no choice and soon they will mostly forgot how it was in the past.\n\n2050 will be a very different world than the present, and 2080 will again be a very different world.\n\nSpecific societal projections into the future beyond about 10 years are pure fantasy and should be ignored. Some major physical changes are underway on this planet which will change everything. Those should not be ignored.\n\nnotanoilman, 06/11/2019 at 2:27 pm\n\n1/ Cobalt is being dramatically reduced in batteries with the newest technology eliminating it altogether.\n\n2/ Rare earths, such as neodymium, are not needed for electric motors nor, for that matter, in wind turbines.\n\nThese shortage scare stories are fake facts pushed by the anti-renewables lobby.\n\nNAOM\n\nhttps://forums.tesla.com/de_AT/forum/forums/no-rare-earth-metals-model-s\n\nNick G, 06/11/2019 at 3:23 pm\n\nYep -fake facts.\n\nThere's an enormous amount of lithium out there – far more than the proven reserves of the USGS, which were never, ever intended to be used for this kind of long-term planning exercise. But it doesn't really matter.\n\nThere are many, many different chemistries for making batteries. Lead, aluminum, sulfur, iron the list is almost as long as the periodic table. Lithium has a little higher energy density than most, but they'd all work, in a pinch.\n\nFor instance, there was a company recently developing an advanced lead battery that was at least twice as energy dense as convention lead-acid and half the cost, but it couldn't quite compete with the li-ion juggernaut, and it went out of business.\n\nThink VHS vs Beta. Beta was better, but VHS was a bit cheaper and better marketed, and got to economies of scale before Beta. Both worked.\n\nThink Laserdisc vs Blueray. Laserdisc was a bit larger, and it didn't quite compete with DVD and Blueray. But it worked just fine.\n\nOFM, 06/11/2019 at 3:39 pm\n\nThe one really critical point that Tesla bashers are VERY careful to avoid is that Tesla's market cap at the lowest point a few days back was still roughly eighty percent of Ford's and not much less than that, about sixty five percent ( mental arithmetic in both cases) of GM . and that Tesla manufactures only a tiny percentage of the volume of these two old line companies. FOR NOW, lol.\n\nFolks who bought GM years ago haven't seen any stock price appreciation worth writing home about it. Ditto Ford.\n\nTesla even in the dumps is a big winner for long term investors.\n\nNick G, 06/11/2019 at 8:48 pm\n\nInvestors buy growth, and Tesla has delivered the growth that it originally promised.\n\nTesla will continue to grow until legacy car makers really get serious about EVs.\n\nThe latest commercials from Audi and Nissan suggest that they begin to really \"get it\", but they're still moving pretty slowly.\n\nislandboy, 06/11/2019 at 10:23 pm\n\nHere's Proof That Electric Cars Are Displacing Gasoline\n\nAccording to a recent report from the DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (via Charged), plug-in vehicles displaced 323 million gallons of gasoline in the US in 2018. That's still a mere drop in the gas can: it amounts to 0.25% of all gasoline used in the US in that year (another dose of reality: the increasing popularity of trucks and SUVs has more than wiped out all the emissions reductions from EVs).\n\nHowever, the trend of falling demand for gas is gathering speed. The amount of gasoline displaced was about 42% higher in 2018 than in 2017, and about double the amount in 2016. Furthermore, the share of pure electric vehicles is growing. Gasoline displacement from pure EVs versus plug-in hybrids was evenly split in 2012 and 2013, but in 2018, EVs accounted for two thirds of the displacement.\n\nAs gas consumption begins to fall, electricity consumption is rising. Another DOE report shows that the amount of energy consumed by plug-in vehicles in the US has nearly doubled in the last two years, from 1.44 terawatt hours in 2016 to 2.85 TWh in 2018. Here we also see the trend toward pure EVs – in 2018, pure EVs accounted for 61% of electricity consumption from plug-in vehicles, while plug-in hybrids accounted for 39%.\n\n[May 16, 2019] Safety risks for EV may increase as manufacturers work to boost performance and push battery cells closer to their limits\n\nMay 16, 2019 | www.nakedcapitalism.com\n\nTech: \"Tesla Fires Sound Alarms About Safety of Electric-Car Batteries\" [ Industry Week ]. \"For EVs, the risk of a fire or explosion is comparable -- or potentially slightly lower -- than for gas or diesel-fueled models, according to a 2017 report by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nHowever, safety risks may increase as manufacturers work to boost performance and push battery cells closer to their limits, the study found Rapid growth means the sector 'will no doubt see increasing quality control issues with the supply chain,' [Simon Moores, London-based managing director of industry consultant Benchmark Mineral Intelligence] said.

There were sounds of explosions and firefighters took about 45 minutes to extinguish the blaze, the Economic Times reported.\n\nIt was the first fire of its kind in the city, the report said.\n\nTesla didn't have a comment on the matter, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for the company said. Hong Kong's Fire Services Department is investigating the May 12 fire, a representative said, declining to identify the make of the car.\n\nLast month, videos on social media showed a car bearing a Tesla logo in Shanghai emitting smoke before bursting into flames, while rival NIO Inc. said one of its ES8 electric vehicles caught fire in the north-west Chinese city of Xi'an while being repaired. Tesla and NIO said they were looking into the reports.\n\nThe incidents have fueled concern over the safety of EVs in China. In 2018, China recorded at least 40 fire-related incidents involving new-energy vehicles, a fleet that includes pure battery electric, hybrid plug-in and fuel-cell vehicles, according to the State Administration for Market Regulation.\n\n[May 08, 2019] We Are Not Playing VW Introduces EV Hatchback In $34 Billion Plan To Take Down Tesla\n\nMay 08, 2019 | www.zerohedge.com\n\nWith Tesla already facing stiff competition from high end retailers like Audi and Jaguar - both of whom have introduced luxury performance electric vehicles – Volkswagen is now posing an additional threat that could impact middle market buyers of Tesla's Model 3.\n\nIn fact, Volkswagen has invested $34 billion in a strategy to try and take down Tesla as the leader in electric vehicles, according to Bloomberg. The company is now taking €1000 deposits for its new ID.3 hatchback, which Volkswagen is hoping will be the electric successor to its iconic Beetle. The vehicle will start at less than €30,000, which is about the same price as the diesel variant of its Golf hatchback.\n\nVW sales chief Juergen Stackmann said recently: \"We are not playing.
