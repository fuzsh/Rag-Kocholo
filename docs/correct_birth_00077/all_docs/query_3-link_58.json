        "text": "History: Son of William II of Orange and Mary, daughter of Charles I. He was offered the English crown by the parliamentary opposition to James II. Invaded England in 1688, and in 1689 became joint sovereign with his wife Mary II, his cousin and the daughter of the future James II, who he had married in 1677. Crowned 11 Apr 1689. Spent much of his reign campaigning, first in Ireland where he defeated James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and later against the French at Flanders. Reigned as sole sovereign after his wife's death in 1694. Assented to the Act of Settlement of 1701, which ensured Protestant succession, and was succeeded in 1702 by Mary's sister, Anne."
