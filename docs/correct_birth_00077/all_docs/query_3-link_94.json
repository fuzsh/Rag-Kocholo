        "text": "The Battle of the Boyne: a turning point for Ireland\n\nThe context of the battle\n\nThe Battle of the Boyne took place on July 1, 1690, against a backdrop of conflict for the British throne between James II, the deposed king, and his son-in-law and nephew, William III. While James II, supported by Louis XIV of France, had a Catholic majority in Ireland behind him, William III enjoyed the support of Protestants in Ireland, Scotland and England.\n\nSequence of events\n\nThe battle takes place on the banks of the River Boyne, near Drogheda on Ireland’s east coast. James II positioned his troops south of the river, believing that the defensive position would give him an advantage. His army was estimated at around 23,500 men.\n\nFor his part, William had a superior force of almost 36,000 men.\n\nWilliam of Orange then devised a strategy that would play a decisive role in his victory. He traps the enemy by sending part of his army to attack the bridge at Slane, further west, thus diverting part of Jacques’ forces from their main position.\n\nA winning strategy, which enabled William to cross the Boyne at Oldbridge, the closest point to the Jacobite army.\n\nDespite fierce resistance, the Jacobite forces were unable to contain William of Orange’s advance. The battle is fierce and each side shines with bravery. But William III’s numerical superiority and better tactics ultimately gave his troops the upper hand.\n\nWilliam of Orange’s Long-Term Impact on Ireland\n\nCenturies of religious tension\n\nThe failure of James II was a resounding defeat for Catholic Ireland. Seen as a symbol of Protestant supremacy over the Catholic religion, the Orangemen victory evokes bitter memories for Irish Catholics attached to their faith.\n\nWorse still, in addition to being a setback for Catholicism in Ireland, this battle also had a territorial dimension… For several centuries now, Ireland has been under repeated assault from the English, who were determined to colonize it and impose their colonial and religious domination.\n\nThus, with the Battle of the Boyne, Ireland’s territorial and religious future seemed threatened… to the benefit of the English and their Protestantism.\n\nThe battle was so important that it remains a powerful symbol of the tensions between Irish Catholic republicans and British Protestant loyalists in Northern Ireland.\n\nMany Orangemen still march in the streets of Belfast and Derry to commemorate this victory over the Irish Catholics… A parry often seen as a provocation by the opposing camp…\n\nThese tensions have been deeply rooted since the Troubles, right up to the present day. And there are numerous references to William of Orange in parades, where Orangemen seem to brandish this historic figure as the banner of their convictions.\n\nWilliam of Orange in the collective memory\n\nFocus on contemporary orange parades\n\nEvery year on July 12, Orangemen parade through the streets of Belfast, Derry and other towns in Northern Ireland to commemorate William’s historic victory at the Battle of the Boyne.\n\nThese parades, organized by the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organization, are major events, but also sources of tension and sometimes violence.\n\nThese parades are often organized in full view of Catholic neighborhoods, which see them as a real provocation. Whistles, insults and occasional stone-throwing have already triggered clashes between the two communities.\n\nOften, the police have to intervene. Numerous injuries were sustained, as was material damage.\n\nIt is not advisable to venture into sensitive areas of Northern Ireland during these Orange marches. Although situations can sometimes be calmer, these parades are regularly synonymous with outbursts.\n\nTo be avoided."
