        "text": "William III\n\nFull Name: William of Orange\n\nProfession: King of England\n\nBiography: William III, otherwise known as William II in Scotland and as “King Billy” in Ireland, was widely known as William of Orange. As a Protestant king, William participated in several wars against the Catholic regime in France under King Louis XIV.\n\nWilliam was seen by many Protestants as a champion of the faith. This is natural seeing, on top of his many holy wars, as he came to power at the head of a Protestant reaction against the coronation of his Catholic uncle, James, as king of England. His ride to power came to be known as the Glorious Revolution of 1688.\n\nEarly in his reign, from 1688 to 1697, William was involved in the Nine Years' War against the French and left his wife, Mary, in charge of the kingdom. Mary fell ill and died in 1694, leaving William as sole ruler until his death in 1702.\n\nBorn: November 14, 1650\n\nBirthplace: The Hague, Dutch Republic\n\nStar Sign: Scorpio\n\nDied: March 8, 1702 (aged 51)\n\nCause of Death: Pneumonia\n\nMarried Life\n\nPrince William of Orange (27) marries English princess Mary II Stuart (15)\n\nHistorical Events\n\nPrince William of Orange appointed viceroy of Overijssel\n\nTreaty of Raalte: makes William III Prince of Orange no longer Stadtholder of Overijssel province\n\nDutch Prince William III dances in premiere of \"Ballet of Peace\"\n\nStates of Holland declare the \"Eternal Edict\" void and appoint William III as stadholder\n\nWilliam III takes the oath of stadholder of the States of Holland\n\nWilliam III becomes stadholder of Zeeland\n\nPrince William of Orange occupies Naarden\n\nPrince William of Orange occupies Grave after a siege\n\nPrince William of Orange appointed viceroy of Gelderland\n\nPrince William III installed as governor of Overijssel\n\nBattle at Montcassel, French troops beat Prince William III\n\nWhig Lords questions prince William III of Orange on Protestantism\n\nCity council of Amsterdam votes to support Prince William of Orange's invasion of England, which became known as 'The Glorious Revolution' in the Netherlands\n\nPrince William of Orange accepts invitation of take up the British crown\n\nPrince William of Orange's invasion fleet sails to England\n\nPrince William of Orange's army lands at Torbay, England; the 'Glorious Revolution' commences\n\nEngland's most influential general Lord John Churchill meets and pledges allegiance to William of Orange (later William III)\n\nPrince William of Orange's troops arrive in London\n\nEarl of Danby occupies York for King William III, Prince of Orange\n\nPrince William of Orange (future King William III of Britain), summons Convention Parliament to discuss ruling jointly with his wife Mary (daughter of exiled King James II)\n\nEnglish parliament places Mary Stuart and Prince William III on the throne\n\nDutch prince William III proclaimed King of England\n\nConvention of the Estates of Scotland opens to decide on offering Scottish Crown to William III and Mary Stuart or to James II of England\n\nKing William III and Queen Mary II crowned as joint rulers of England, Scotland and Ireland\n\nEnglish King William III declares war on France in support of the Dutch Republic (Nine Years' War)\n\nEnglish King William III's army lands at Carrickfergus in Ireland\n\nArmy of Protestant King William III of England defeats deposed Roman Catholic King James II in the Battle of the Boyne at Oldbridge, Ireland\n\nBattle of Drogheda Boyne: King William III defeats deposed King James II of England\n\nEnglish King William III travels to The Hague\n\nBattle of Aughrim (Aghrim) Ireland, William III beats James II\n\nBattle of Steenkerque: French defeat William III's combined English/Dutch army\n\nEnglish King William III departs to Netherlands\n\nFrench garrison of castle Namur surrenders to the army of the Grand Alliance under the command of King William III of England\n\nKing William III escapes South Netherlands, back to England\n\nEnglish King William III departs Netherlands\n\nEnglish King William III travels through northern Europe\n\nJames II's daughter Anne Stuart becomes Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland following the death of William III\n\nPrince William of Orange becomes Knight of Garter\n\nFamous Kings\n\nGeorge I\n\nGeorge II\n\nPhilip III\n\nRichard III\n\nRichard the Lionheart\n\nSigismund III Vasa"
