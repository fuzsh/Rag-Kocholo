        "text": "The Stuarts were one of the oldest dynasties in Europe. They had ruled in Scotland since 1371, holding off all challengers. In 1603, they inherited the crowns of England and Ireland, when James VI and I ascended the throne following the death of Elizabeth I.\n\nThough the Stuarts had survived civil war, execution and exile, in 1688, this dynasty was torn into two competing camps, divided by religion. One court remained in London while the another was established in exile in France.\n\nThe restoration of the monarchy\n\nIn 1660, Charles II was restored to the throne of England, eleven years after his father, Charles I had been executed by Parliamentary forces commanded by Oliver Cromwell.\n\nWhen Charles II died suddenly at the age of 54 without any legitimate children to inherit his throne, he was succeeded by his brother, James.\n\nAn unpopular ruler\n\nJames VII and II was devoutly Catholic. Initially, Protestants tolerated his reign. His successors, his daughters Mary and Anne, were both Protestant, so James's Catholicism was seen as a temporary aberration. When his second wife, the equally devoutly Catholic Mary of Modena, gave birth to a son in 1688, a group of leading Protestants decided to take action.\n\nFearing a permanent Catholic dynasty, they invited William, the Prince of Orange and husband (and cousin) of James's daughter Mary, to come to Britain with an army â€“ an event which in England became known as the 'Glorious Revolution'.\n\nWhen anti-Catholic riots broke out in London, James sent his wife and son to safety in France. He attempted to follow them, but was captured and returned to the city. William had no desire to imprison James and allowed him to sail for France, where he was reunited with his family."
