        "text": "William III of England (14 November 1650 – 8 March 1702), also known as William II of Scotland and William of Orange, was a Dutch aristocrat and the Prince of Orange from his birth, King of England and Ireland from 13 February 1689, and King of Scotland from 11 April 1689, in each case until his death.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\n1690s\n\n[edit]\n\nI think My Self obliged to take Notice, how well the Army there [Ireland] have behaved themselves on all Occasions, and born great Hardships with little Pay, and with so much Patience and Willingness, as could not proceed but from an Affectionate Duty to My Service, and a Zeal for the Protestant Religion.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (2 October 1690), quoted in His Majesties Most Gracious Speech to both Houses of Parliament. On Thursday the 2d day of October 1690 (1690), p. 3\n\nNow, as I have neither spared My Person, nor My Pains, to do you all the Good I could; so I doubt not, but if you will as cheerfully do your Parts, it is in your Power to make both Me and your selves Happy, and the Nation Great: And on the other hand it is too plain, by what the French have let you see so lately, that if the present War be not prosecuted with Vigour, no Nation in the World is exposed to greater Danger... It is further Necessary to inform you, That the whole Support of the Confederacy abroad, will absolutely depend upon the Speed and Vigour of your Proceedings in this Session.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (2 October 1690), quoted in His Majesties Most Gracious Speech to both Houses of Parliament. On Thursday the 2d day of October 1690 (1690), pp. 3-4\n\n[I]t will well Deserve Your Consideration, Whether We are not defective both in the Number of Our Shipping, and in proper Ports to the Westward, for the better Annoying Our Enemies, and Protecting Our Trade, so Essential to the Welfare of this Kingdom.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (7 November 1693), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III. Vol. III (1706), p. 665\n\nUpon this Occasion I cannot but take notice of the Courage and Bravery which the English Troops have shewn this last Summer; which I may say has answer'd their highest Character in any Age: And it will not be denied, that without the concurrence of the Valour and Power of England, it were impossible to put a Stop to the Ambition and Greatness of France.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (23 November 1695), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III. Vol. III (1706), p. 703\n\nI did recommend to the last Parliament the Forming some good Bill for the Encouragement and Increase of Seamen; I hope you will not let this Session pass without doing somewhat in it; and that you will consider of such Laws as may be proper for the advancement of Trade, and will have a particular regard to that of the East-Indies, lest it should be lost to the Nation.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (23 November 1695), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III. Vol. III (1706), p. 704\n\nOur Naval Force being increased to near double what it was at my Accession to the Crown, the Charge of Maintaining it will be proportionably augmented; and it is certainly necessary for the Interest and Reputation of England, to have always a great Strength at Sea.\n\nThe Circumstances of Affairs Abroad are such, that I think my self oblig'd to tell you My Opinion, That for the present, England cannot be Safe without a Land Force, and I hope We shall not give those who mean Us Ill, the opportunity of Effecting that, under the Notion of a Peace, which they could not bring to pass by a War.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (3 December 1697), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III. Vol. III (1706), p. 741\n\nI shall conclude with telling You, That as I have, with the Hazard of every Thing, Rescued your Religion, Laws and Liberties, when they were in the Extremest Danger; so I shall place the Glory of My Reign in Preserving them Entire, and leaving them so to Posterity.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (3 December 1697), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III. Vol. III (1706), p. 741\n\n[T]he Flourishing of Trade, the Supporting of Credit, and the Quiet of Peoples Minds at home, will depend upon the Opinion they have of their Security; and to preserve to England the Weight and Influence it has at present on the Councils and Affairs Abroad, it will be requisite Europe should see you will not be wanting to your selves.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (9 December 1699), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III.

Vol. III (1706), p. 827\n\nBy the French King's placing his Grandson on the Throne of Spain, he is in a Condition to oppress the rest of Europe, unless speedy and effectual Measures be taken. Under this pretence, he is become the real Master of the whole Spanish Monarchy; he has made it to be entirely depending on France, and disposes of it as of his own Dominions, and by that means he has surrounded his Neighbours in such a manner, that though the Name of Peace may be said to continue, yet they are put to the Expence and Inconveniences of War.\n\nThis must affect England in the nearest and most sensible Manner, in respect to our Trade, which will soon become precarious in all the valuable Branches of it; in respect to our Peace and Safety at Home, which we cannot hope should long continue; and in respect to that part which England ought to take in the Preservation of the Liberty of Europe.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (30 December 1701), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III. Vol. III (1706), pp. 827-828\n\nIn order to obviate the general Calamity with which the rest of Christendom is threatned by this Exorbitant Power of France, I have concluded several Alliances, according to the Encouragement given Me by Both Houses of Parliament; which I will direct shall be laid before you, and which I do not doubt you will enable Me to make good.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (30 December 1701), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III. Vol. III (1706), p. 828\n\nIt is fit I should tell you, the Eyes of all Europe are upon this Parliament, all Matters are at a stand till your Resolutions are known, and therefore no Time ought to be lost.\n\nYou have yet an opportunity, by God's Blessing, to secure to you and your Posterity the quiet Enjoyment of your Religion and Liberties, if you are not wanting to your selves, but will exert the Ancient Vigor of the English Nation: But I tell you plainly My Opinion is, If you do not lay hold on this Occasion, you have no Reason to hope for another.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (30 December 1701), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III. Vol. III (1706), p. 828\n\nLet Me conjure you to disappoint the only Hopes of Our Enemies, by your Unanimity. I have shewn, and will always shew, how desirous I am to be the Common Father of all My People: Do you in like manner lay aside Parties and Divisions; Let there be no other Distinction heard of among Us for the future, but of those who are for the Protestant Religion and the present Establishment, and of those who mean a Popish Prince and a French Government.\n\nI will only add this, If you do in good earnest desire to see England hold the Balance of Europe, and to be indeed at the Head of the Protestant Interest, it will appear by your right improving the present Opportunity.\n\nSpeech to Parliament (30 December 1701), quoted in White Kennett, A Complete History of England: With the lives of All the Kings and Queens Thereof; From the Earliest Account of Time, to the Death of His late Majesty King William III.

Even on a personal level the change was dramatic. James II had been devotedly Catholic, blinkered and narrowly English in outlook. He was hostile to the pretensions of parliament, impatient of the restrictions that the law imposed on his powers. William, though James's nephew by blood, was anything but English in most ways. While he indulged his wife's Anglicanism, his personal sympathies lay with the starkly un-English Calvinism of the Dutch Reformed Church. His favourite friends were as foreign as his accent. His intelligence was acute and his tastes cosmopolitan. His political preoccupations were European, far removed from the average Englishman's insularity. He had no great love of representative institutions, but had learned to live with them in the United Provinces and accepted that he must do so in England.\n\nGeoffrey Holmes, 'Revolution, War and Politics 1689–1714', in Blair Worden (ed.), Stuart England (1986), p. 199\n\n[T]hat great religious radical, King William...intended to raise a goodly fabric of charity, of concord, and of peace, and upon which his admirers of the present day are endeavouring to build the dungeon of their Protestant Constitution. If the views and intentions of King William had been such as are now imputed to him, instead of blessing his arrival as an epoch of glory and happiness to England, we should have had reason to curse the hour when first he printed his footstep on our strand. But he came not here a bigoted polemic, with religious tracts in one hand, and civil persecution in the other; he came to regenerate and avenge the prostrate and insulted liberties of England; he came with peace and toleration on his lips, and with civil and religious liberty in his heart.\n\nLord Palmerston, speech in the House of Commons in favour of Catholic Emancipation (18 March 1829), quoted in George Henry Francis, Opinions and Policy of the Right Honourable Viscount Palmerston, G.C.B., M.P., &c. as Minister, Diplomatist, and Statesman, During More Than Forty Years of Public Life (1852), pp. 84-85\n\nAfter Westphalia brought peace to Europe, the second half of the seventeenth century saw a further spread of resident ambassadors, with Louis XIV’s France leading the way, and French replaced Latin as the lingua franca. There was, however, still scope for summitry, for instance during Peter the Great’s tour of Western Europe in 1697–8. His meetings with William III of England helped bring Russia belatedly into the European diplomatic orbit. In due course, the czar created a “Diplomatic Chancellery” and a network of foreign embassies on the European model.\n\nDavid Reynolds, Summits: Six Meetings that Changed the Twentieth Century (2007), p. 19\n\nWilliam III. is now termed a scoundrel, but was not James II. a fool? The character of William is generally considered on too small a scale. To estimate it properly, we must remember that Louis XIV. had formed a vast scheme of conquest, which would have overthrown the liberties of all Europe, have subjected even us to the caprice of French priests and French harlots. The extirpation of the Protestant religion, the abolition of all civil privileges, would have been the infallible consequence. I speak of this scheme not as a partisan, but from the most extensive reading and information on the topic. I say that William III. was the first, if not sole cause, of the complete ruin of this plan of tyranny. The English revolution was but a secondary object, the throne a mere step towards the altar of European liberty. William had recourse to all parties merely to serve this great end, for which he often exposed his own life in the field, and was devoured by constant cares in the cabinet.\n\nHorace Walpole, Walpoliana (1825), pp. 166-167\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
