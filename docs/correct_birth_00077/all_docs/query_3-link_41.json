As King of Scotland, he was known as William II.\n\nBiography[]\n\nIn 1688, William invaded England and replaced James II and VII in what became known as the Glorious Revolution.[1] During the Great Recoinage of 1696, King William tasked William Lowndes, the Secretary to the Treasury, to seek out the warden of the Royal Mint, Isaac Newton for help. Lowndes, in turn, tasked the Assassin Omar Khaled to do so.[2]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nIn 1695, the city of Nassau in New Providence, originally named Charles-Towne, was renamed after his House's progeny, the House of Nassau,[3] following being destroyed and rebuilt.[4]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (mentioned in Database entry only)\n\nAssassin's Creed: Gold (mentioned only)"
