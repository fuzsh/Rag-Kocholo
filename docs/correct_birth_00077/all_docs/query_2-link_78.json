        "text": "Willem III unsuccessfully opposed the restrictions on royal authority accepted by his father.\n\nIn 1839 he married his cousin, Sophie of WÃ¼rttemberg (1818-1877). It was not a happy marriage, as their characters were incompatible. Their three sons, Willem (1840-1879), Maurits (1843-1850) and Alexander (1851-1884), all died before their father. Queen Sophie died in 1877.\n\nIn 1879 the King remarried, this time to Emma of Waldeck-Pyrmont (1858-1934).The couple had one daughter, Princess Wilhelmina. Willem III died on 23 November 1890."
