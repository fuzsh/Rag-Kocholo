William III of England: The Protestant Hero King

William III of England, also known as William of Orange, is renowned for his pivotal role in the Glorious Revolution, overthrowing his Catholic uncle and father-in-law, James II, and ascending to the throne alongside his wife, Mary II, in 1689. As a fierce Protestant, William III's reign marked a significant turning point in British history, cementing Protestantism as the dominant faith in the kingdom.

Early Life and Accession

Born on November 4, 1650, in The Hague, Netherlands, William III was the only child of William II, Prince of Orange, and Mary, Princess Royal, daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Following his father's death a week before his birth, William III became the Prince of Orange from birth. In 1677, he married his first cousin, Mary, the eldest daughter of his maternal uncle James, Duke of York, and later successor of King Charles II.

The Glorious Revolution

In 1685, James II, a Catholic, became King of England, Scotland, and Ireland, sparking widespread discontent among the Protestant majority. Supported by influential British political and religious leaders, William III invaded England in 1688, landing at Brixham, and James II was subsequently deposed. William's reputation as a staunch Protestant enabled him and his wife to take power, marking the beginning of the Glorious Revolution.

Reign and Legacy

During the early years of his reign, William III was occupied with the Nine Years' War (1688-1697), leaving Mary to govern Britain alone. After her death in 1694, William continued to rule until his own death on March 8, 1702. His legacy is marked by the Bill of Rights (1689), which established certain liberties and limitations on the monarch's power, and the Toleration Act (1689), which granted religious freedom to non-Anglican Protestants.
