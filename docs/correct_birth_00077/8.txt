William III

Full Name: William of Orange

Profession: King of England

Biography: William III, otherwise known as William II in Scotland and as “King Billy” in Ireland, was widely known as William of Orange. As a Protestant king, William participated in several wars against the Catholic regime in France under King Louis XIV.

William was seen by many Protestants as a champion of the faith. This is natural seeing, on top of his many holy wars, as he came to power at the head of a Protestant reaction against the coronation of his Catholic uncle, James, as king of England. His ride to power came to be known as the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

Early in his reign, from 1688 to 1697, William was involved in the Nine Years' War against the French and left his wife, Mary, in charge of the kingdom. Mary fell ill and died in 1694, leaving William as sole ruler until his death in 1702.
