Us Weekly broke the news that Burt Reynolds died on Thursday, September 6, at a hospital in Florida after going into cardiac arrest. Relive the actor’s life in photos:\n\nCredit: GAB Archive/Redferns\n\nBecoming an Actor\n\nBorn in East Lansing, Michigan, Reynolds received a football scholarship to Florida State University and roomed with future college football legend Lee Corso in the ‘50s. After a knee injury threatened a career in the NFL, Reynolds turned to the school theater program. In his 2015 autobiography But Enough About Me, Reynolds called his English teacher, Watson B. Duncan III, who pushed him to try out for his first play, Outward Bound, his mentor.\n\nCredit: Martin Mills/Getty Images\n\nLeading Man\n\nReynolds starred as Detective Lt. John Hawk on the New York City crime series, Hawk, in 1966. Four years later, he landed another title role as Dan August in the ABC crime drama, Dan August, which aired from 1970 to 1971.\n\nCredit: Ron Galella/WireImage\n\nThe One That Got Away\n\nNearly 30 years after Reynolds and actress Sally Field called off their five-year, on-off romance, the actor spoke candidly about their relationship in the December issue of Vanity Fair. “I miss her terribly. Even now, it’s hard on me. I don’t know why I was so stupid. Men are like that, you know. You find the perfect person, and then you do everything you can to screw it up,” he admitted to the magazine at the time.\n\nCredit: Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic\n\nProud Dad\n\nReynolds called his son his “greatest achievement” during a 2018 interview with Closer Weekly. “He’s a wonderful young man and is now working as a camera assistant in Hollywood,” he gushed at the time. “He never asked for any help with his career, he did it all himself, and I’m so proud of him. I love him very much.”\n\nCredit: Noam Galai/Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival\n\nStill Making Movies\n\nRobert De Niro helped Reynolds make his way down the carpet during a rare appearance at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City in 2017. He was promoing his movie Dog Years alongside his costar Chevy Chase. “Great to see Mr. De Niro, who I love, and … you know, all the people that I know,” Reynolds told the Associated Press at the time. “It’s very sweet.”"
