        "text": "Taylor Swift fans are making the best of a weekend gone very wrong after all of the singer's Vienna Eras Tour dates were canceled due to a planned terror attack targeting the stadium.\n\nLocal and foreign fans alike flocked to the Austrian capital for the \"Fearless\" songstress' 3-day stint, which was canceled just one day before its Aug. 8 start date after the government verified a significant security risk posed by two teenagers with ties to radical terrorist groups, one of whom admitted to plans to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\"\n\nWith the suspects in custody, some fans gathered together with the mindset that the show must go on, crowding together in an intersection for an impromptu singalong.\n\nOne video, uploaded to X, shows a massive crowd collecting in a plaza, where they sang \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" with their voices ringing out throughout the area.\n\n\"My friend is in Vienna and sent me this video of swifties coming together this morning and I’m fully sobbing,\" the uploader explained.\n\nAnother clip, taken from within the crowd, rather than one of the buildings above it, found the group of fans singing \"Long Live.\"\n\nMany fans were left in \"tears\" over the \"wholesome\" videos, though others still had concerns about the safety of those congregating, though at this time, officials do not believe there are any other suspects on the run.\n\nSome fans also gathered together outside of the stadium where the shows were set to take place, according to another fan update account on the social media platform, which shared a few snapshots of chalk drawings on the pavement.\n\nMany of the singer's lyrics were left to decorate the area, including \"Fearless\" and \"To live for the hope of it all.\"\n\nAnother combined the concert’s opening song, “Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince,” with “Evermore,” writing, “It’s been a long time coming but we’ll wait for evermore.”\n\nFans were naturally devastated by the cancelations, though understood the reasoning behind them, and some are even banding together to try to get London Eras Tour tickets into the hands of those affected by the events in Austria."
