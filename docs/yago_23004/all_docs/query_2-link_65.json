        "text": "Burton Leon Reynolds Jr. (February 11, 1936 – September 6, 2018) was an American actor, director and producer. He first rose to prominence starring in television series such as Gunsmoke (1962–1965), Hawk (1966), and Dan August (1970–1971).\n\nHis breakout film role was as Lewis Medlock in Deliverance (1972). Reynolds played the leading role in a number of subsequent box office hits, such as The Longest Yard (1974), Smokey and the Bandit (1977), Semi-Tough (1977), Hooper (1978), Smokey and the Bandit II (1980), The Cannonball Run (1981) and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982).\n\nAfter a number of box office failures, Reynolds returned to television, starring in the sitcom Evening Shade (1990–1994). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Boogie Nights (1997).[2][3][4]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBurton Leon Reynolds Jr. was the son of Harriette Fernette \"Fern\" (née Miller; 1902–1992) and Burton Milo Reynolds (1906–2002). He had Dutch, English, Scots-Irish, and Scottish ancestry. He also claimed Cherokee and Italian roots, both of which remain unverified.[5][6]\n\nDuring his career, he often claimed to have been born in Waycross, Georgia, although he said in 2015 he was actually born in Lansing, Michigan.[7] He was born on February 11, 1936,[8] and in his autobiography stated that Lansing is where his family lived when his father was drafted into the United States Army.[9][10]\n\nHe, his mother, and his sister joined his father at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and lived there for two years. When his father was sent to Europe, the family moved to Lake City, Michigan, where his mother had been raised.[11] In 1946, the family moved to Riviera Beach, Florida. His father eventually became Chief of Police of Riviera Beach, which is adjacent to the north end of West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nDuring 10th grade at Palm Beach High School, Reynolds was named First Team All State and All Southern as a fullback, and received multiple scholarship offers.[12]\n\nCollege[]\n\nAfter graduating from Palm Beach High School, he attended Florida State University on a football scholarship and played halfback.[13] While at Florida State, he roomed with college football broadcaster and analyst Lee Corso, and also became a brother of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.[14]\n\nHe had hoped to be named to All-American teams and have a career in professional football; however, he injured his knee in the first game of his sophomore season, and later that year lost his spleen and injured his other knee in a bad car accident.[15] These injuries hampered his abilities on the field, and after being beaten in coverage for the game-winning touchdown in a 7-0 loss to North Carolina State on October 12, 1957, he decided to give up football.\n\nEnding his college football career, Reynolds thought of becoming a police officer; however, his father suggested he finish college and become a parole officer. To keep up with his studies, he began taking classes at Palm Beach Junior College (PBJC) in neighboring Lake Park.\n\nEarly acting[]\n\nIn his first term at PBJC, he was in an English class taught by Watson B. Duncan III. Duncan pushed him into trying out for a play he was producing, Outward Bound. He cast him in the lead role based on having heard him read Shakespeare in class, leading to his winning the 1956 Florida State Drama Award for his performance. \"I read two words and they gave me a lead,\" he later said.[16]\n\nIn his autobiography, he referred to Duncan as his mentor and the most influential person in his life.[17]\n\nCareer[]\n\nTheatre[]\n\nThe Florida State Drama Award included a scholarship to the Hyde Park Playhouse, a summer stock theatre, in Hyde Park, New York. Reynolds saw the opportunity as an agreeable alternative to more physically demanding summer jobs, but did not yet see acting as a possible career. While working there, Reynolds met Joanne Woodward, who helped him find an agent.\n\n\"I don't think I ever actually saw him perform,\" said Woodward later. \"I knew him as this cute, shy, attractive boy. He had the kind of lovely personality that made you want to do something for him.\"[16]\n\nHe was cast in Tea and Sympathy at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. After his Broadway debut in Look, We've Come Through, he received favorable reviews for his performance and went on tour with the cast, driving the bus as well as appearing on stage.[18]\n\nAfter the tour, Reynolds returned to New York and enrolled in acting classes, along with Frank Gifford, Carol Lawrence, Red Buttons and Jan Murray.\n\n\"I was a working actor for two years before I finally took my first real acting class (with Wynn Handman at the Neighborhood Playhouse),\" he said. \"It was a lot of technique, truth, moment-to-moment, how to listen, improv.\"[16]\n\nAfter a botched improvisation in acting class, Reynolds briefly considered returning to Florida, but soon gained a part in a revival of Mister Roberts, in which Charlton Heston played the starring role.\n\nAfter the play closed, the director, John Forsythe, arranged a film audition with Joshua Logan for Reynolds. The film was Sayonara (1957). Reynolds was told he could not be in the film because he looked too much like Marlon Brando. Logan advised Reynolds to go to Hollywood, although Reynolds did not feel confident enough to do so.[19] (Another source says Reynolds did a screen test after Lew Wasserman saw the effect he had on secretaries in his office but the test was unsuccessful.[20])\n\nHe worked in a variety of jobs, such as waiting tables, washing dishes, driving a delivery truck and as a bouncer at the Roseland Ballroom. Reynolds wrote that, while working as a dockworker, he was offered $150 to jump through a glass window on a live television show.[21]\n\nEarly television and Riverboat[]\n\nReynolds began acting on television in the late 1950s, guest starring on shows like Flight, M Squad, Schlitz Playhouse, The Lawless Years and Pony Express. He signed a seven-year contract with Universal.[22] \"I don't care whether he can act or not,\" said Wasserman. \"Anyone who has this effect on women deserves a break.\"[20]\n\nReynolds' first big break came when he was cast alongside Darren McGavin in the lead of the TV series Riverboat (1959–61), playing Ben Frazer. According to a contemporary report Reynolds was considered \"a double for Marlon Brando\".[23] The show went for two seasons but Reynolds quit after only 20 episodes, claiming he did not get along with McGavin or the executive producer, and that he had \"a stupid part\".[24]\n\nReynolds says then he \"couldnt get a job. I didn't have a very good reputation. You just don't walk out on a network television series.\"[22]\n\nReynolds returned to guest starring on television shows. As he put it, \"I played heavies in every series in town\"[24] appearing in episodes of Playhouse 90, Johnny Ringo, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Lock Up, The Blue Angels, Michael Shayne, Zane Grey Theater, The Aquanauts and The Brothers Brannagan. \"They were depressing years,\" he later said.[22]\n\nReynolds made his film debut in the low budget Angel Baby (1961), billed fourth. He followed it with a role in a war film, Armored Command (1961). \"It was the one picture that Howard Keel didn't sing on,\" reminisced Reynolds later. \"That was a terrible mistake.\"[25]\n\nIn 1961, he returned to Broadway to appear in Look, We've Come Through under the direction of José Quintero, but it lasted only five performances.[26]\n\nReynolds continued to guest star on shows such as Naked City, Ripcord, Everglades, Route 66, Perry Mason, and The Twilight Zone (\"The Bard\"). He later said, \"I learned more about my craft in these guest shots than I did standing around and looking virile on Riverboat\".[27]\n\nGunsmoke[]\n\nIn 1962, Dennis Weaver wanted to leave the cast of Gunsmoke, one of the top rated shows in the country. The producers developed a new character, \"halfbreed\" blacksmith Quint Asper: Reynolds was cast, beating over 300 other contenders. Reynolds announced he would stay on the show \"until it ends. I think it's a terrible mistake for an actor to leave a series in the middle of it\".[24]Reynolds left Gunsmoke in 1965. He later said the show was \"the happiest period of my life. I hated to leave that show but I felt I had served my apprenticeship and there wasn't room for two leading men.\"[22]\n\nHe was cast in his first lead role in a film, the low budget action film Operation CIA (1965). He guest starred on Flipper, The FBI and 12 O'Clock High.\n\nHawk and leading roles in films[]\n\nReynolds was given the title role in a TV series, Hawk (1966–67), playing Native American detective John Hawk. It ran for 17 episodes before being cancelled.[28]\n\nHe played another Native American in the spaghetti western Navajo Joe (1966) shot in Spain.\"It wasn't my favorite picture,\" ...he said later....\"I had two expressions - mad and madder.\"[29]\n\nHe guest starred on Gentle Ben; and made a pilot for a TV series, Lassiter, where he would have played a magazine journalist. Unfortunately, it was not picked up.[30]\n\nReynolds then made a series of films in quick succession. Shark! (1968), shot in Mexico, was directed by Sam Fuller who removed his name from it after which its release was held up a number of years. Fade-In which he described as \"the best thing I've ever done,\"[31] was not released for a number of years, and the director Judd Taylor took his name off. Impasse (1969), was a war movie shot in the Philippines. He played the title role Sam Whiskey (1969), a comic Western written by William W. Norton which Reynolds later claimed was \"way ahead of its time. I was playing light comedy and nobody cared.\"[25]\n\nReynolds supported Jim Brown and Raquel Welch in another Western, 100 Rifles(1969), later saying \"I spent the entire time refereeing fights between Jim Brown and Raquel Welch.\"[32]\n\nIn a 1969 interview he expressed interest in playing roles like the John Garfield part in The Postman Always Rings Twice, but no one sent him those sort of roles. \"Instead, the producer hands me a script and says 'I know it's not there now kid but I know we can make it work'.\"[31]\n\nReynolds had been offered a lead role in MASH (1970), but turned it down after \"they told me the other two leads would be Barbra Streisand's husband and that tall, skinny guy who was in The Dirty Dozen.\" Tom Skerritt played the role and Reynolds instead went into Skullduggery (1970), shot in Jamaica. Reynolds joked that after making \"those wonderful forgettable pictures... I suddenly realized I was as hot as Leo Gorcey.\"[33]\n\nReynolds starred in two TV films Hunters Are for Killing (1970) and Run, Simon, Run (1970). In Hunters his character was originally a Native American, but Reynolds requested this element be changed, feeling he had played it too many times already and it was not needed for the character.[34]\n\nDan August and talk shows[]\n\nReynolds played the title character in police drama Dan August (1970–71), produced by Quinn Martin.[35] The series was given a full-season order of 26 episodes based on the reputation of Martin and Reynolds but struggled in the ratings against Hawaii 5-0 and was not renewed.[33]\n\nAlbert R. Broccoli asked Reynolds to play James Bond, but he turned that role down, saying \"An American can't play James Bond. It just can't be done.\"[36]\n\nFollowing the series' cancellation, Reynolds did his first stage play in six years, a production of The Tender Trap at Arlington Park Theatre. He was offered other TV pilots but was reluctant to play a detective again.\n\nAround this time he had become well known as an entertaining talk show guest, starting with an appearance on The Merv Griffin Show. He made jokes at his own expense, calling himself America's most \"well-known unknown\" who only made the kind of movies \"they show in airplanes or prisons or anywhere else the people can't get out.\" He proved enormously popular and was frequently asked back by Griffin, then Johnny Carson; he even guest hosted.[16] He was so popular as a guest he was offered his own talk show but he wanted to keep on as an actor.[37]\n\nHe later said the talk shows \"the best thing that ever happened to me. They changed everything drastically overnight. I spent ten years looking virile saying 'Put up your hands'. After the Carson, Griffin, Frost, Dinah's show, suddenly I have a personality.\"[38]\n\n\"I realized that people liked me, that I was enough,\" said Reynolds. \"So if I could transfer that character - the irreverent, self-deprecating side of me, my favorite side of me - onto the screen, I could have a big career.[39]\n\nDeliverance and the centerfold[]\n\nReynolds had his breakout role in Deliverance, directed by John Boorman, who cast him off on the basis of a talk show appearance. \"It's the first time I haven't had a script with Paul Newman's and Robert Redford's fingerprints all over it,\" Reynolds joked. \"The producers actually came to me first.\"[37]\n\n\"I've waited 15 years to do a really good movie,\" he said in 1972. \"I made so many bad pictures. I was never able to turn anyone down. The greatest curse in Hollywood is to be a well known unknown.\"[40]\n\nReynolds also gained notoriety around this time when he began a well-publicized relationship with Dinah Shore and after he posed naked in the April 1972 issue of Cosmopolitan.[41][42] Reynolds said he did it for \"a kick. I have a strange sense of humor\" and because he knew he had Deliverance coming out.[40] He later expressed regret for posing for Cosmopolitan.[43]\n\nDeliverance was a huge commercial and critical success and, along with the talk show appearances, helped establish Reynolds as a star. \"The night of the Academy Awards, I counted a half-dozen Burt Reynolds jokes,\" he later said. \"I had become a household name, the most talked-about star at the award show.\"[16]\n\nHe was then in Fuzz (1972), reuniting him with Welch, and made a cameo in Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex*(*But Were Afraid to Ask)(1972). He also returned to the stage, appearing in The Rainmaker at the Arlington.[44]\n\nReynolds played the title role in Shamus (1973), a modern-day private eye, which was a solid box office success. Reynolds described it as \"not a bad film, kind of cute.\"[45]\n\nHe was in The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (1973) co-starring Sarah Miles. The film is best remembered for the scandal during filming where Miles' lover committed suicide; it was a minor hit.[45] He was meant to reunite with Boorman in Zardoz but fell ill and was replaced by Sean Connery.[46]\n\nWhite Lightning[]\n\nAnother career turning moment in Reynolds' career came when he made the light-hearted car chase film written by Norton, White Lightning (1973). Reynolds later called it \"the beginning of a whole series of films made in the South, about the South and for the South... you could make back the cost of the negative just in Memphis alone. Anything outside of that was just gravy.\"[45] Car chase films would be Reynolds' most profitable genre. At the end of 1973 Reynolds was voted into the list of the ten most popular box office stars in the US, at number four. He would stay on that list until 1984.\n\nHe made a sports comedy with Robert Aldrich, The Longest Yard (1974) which was popular. Aldrich later said \"I think that on occasion he's a much better actor than he's given credit for. Not always: sometimes he acts like a caricature of himself.\"[47]\n\nReynolds then appeared in two big budget fiascos: At Long Last Love (1975), a musical for Peter Bogdanovich, and Lucky Lady (1975) with Gene Hackman and Liza Minnelli.\n\nMore popular was another light hearted car chase film, W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975), and a tough cop drama with Aldrich, Hustle (1975).[45] He did a cameo for Mel Brooks in Silent Movie (1976).\n\nDirector[]\n\nReynolds made his directorial debut in 1976 with Gator, the sequel to White Lightning, written by Norton.[48] \"I waited 20 years to do it [directing] and I enjoyed it more than anything I've ever done in this business,\" he said after filming. \"And I happen to think it's what I do best.\"[49]\n\nHe was reunited with Bogdanovich for the screwball comedy Nickelodeon(1976), which was a commercial disappointment. Aldrich later commented, \"Bogdanovich can get him to do the telephone book! Anybody else has to persuade him to do something. He's fascinated by Bogdanovich. I can't understand it.\"[47] He turned down the part of Clark Gable in Gable and Lombard.[50]\n\nSmokey and the Bandit and career peak[]\n\nReynolds had the biggest hit of his career with a car chase film Smokey and the Bandit (1977), directed by Hal Needham and co-starring Jackie Gleason and Sally Field.\n\nHe followed it with a comedy about football players, Semi-Tough (1977), co-starring Jill Clayburgh and Kris Kristofferson and produced by David Merrick. He then made his second film as director The End (1978), a black comedy, playing a role originally written for Woody Allen.[51]\n\nMore popular was a car comedy he made with Needham and Field, Hooper(1978), where he played a stuntman.\n\n\"My ability as an actor gets a little better every time,\" he said around this time. \"I'm very prolific in the amount of films I make - two-and-a-half or three a year - and when I look at any picture I do now compared to Deliverance, it's miles above what I was doing then. But when you're doing films that are somewhat similar to each other, as I've been doing, people take it for granted.\"[50]\n\nHe turned down the Alan Alda part in California Suite (1978) because the part was too small.[50]\n\nHe also said \"I'd rather direct than act. I'd rather do that than anything. It's the second-best sensation I've ever had.\" He added that David Merrick had offered to produce two films Reynolds would direct without having to act in them.[50]\n\nReynolds tried a change of pace with Starting Over (1979), a romantic comedy co-starring Clayburgh and Candice Bergen; it was co-written and produced by James L. Brooks. He played a jewel thief in Rough Cut (1980) produced by Merrick, who fired and then rehired director Don Siegel during filming.\n\nReynolds had two huge hits with car films directed by Needham, Smokey and the Bandit II (1980) and The Cannonball Run (1981). He starred in David Steinberg's film Paternity (1981) and directed himself in a tough action film, Sharky's Machine (1981).\n\nReynolds wanted to try a musical again and so agreed to do The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982). It was a hit, as was Best Friends (1982) with Goldie Hawn. In 1982, Reynolds was voted the most popular star in the US for the fifth year in a row.\n\nAround this time he reflected:\n\nCareer decline[]\n\nJames L. Brooks offered Reynolds the role of astronaut Garrett Breedlove in Terms of Endearment (1983) but he turned it down to do Stroker Ace (1983), another car chase comedy directed by Needham. The Endearment role went to Jack Nicholson, who went on to win an Academy Award. Reynolds said he made this decision because \"I felt I owed Hal more than I owed Jim\" but Stroker Aceflopped. Reynolds felt this was a turning point in his career from which he never recovered. \"That's where I lost them,\" he says of his fans.[53]\n\nThe Man Who Loved Women (1983), directed by Blake Edwards also flopped. In an interview around this time he said:\n\nCannonball Run II (1984), directed by Needham, brought in some money but only half of the original. City Heat (1984), which teamed Reynolds and Eastwood was mildly popular but considered a major box office disappointment. He was injured during filming, causing him to lose weight and for rumors to start that he had AIDS.[53]\n\nReynolds returned to directing with Stick (1985) from an Elmore Leonard novel but it was a critical and commercial failure. So too were three other action films he made: Heat (1986), based on a William Goldman novel, Malone (1987), and Rent-a-Cop (1987) with Liza Minnelli.[53] He later said he did Heat and Malone\"because there were so many rumors about me [about AIDS]. I had to get out and be seen.\"[54]\n\nReynolds tried a screwball comedy, Switching Channels (1989), but it was a box office disappointment. Even more poorly received was Physical Evidence (1989), directed by Michael Crichton. Reynolds received excellent reviews for Breaking In (1989) but the commercial reception was poor.[55]\n\n\"When I was doing very well,\" he said at the time, \"I wasn't conscious I was doing very well, but I became very conscious when I wasn't doing very well. The atmosphere changed.\"[54]\n\nReturn to TV: BL Stryker and Evening Shade[]\n\nReynolds returned to TV series with B.L. Stryker (1989–90). It only ran one season, during which time Reynolds played a supporting part in Modern Love(1990).\n\nReynolds then starred in a sitcom, Evening Shade (1990–94) as Woodward \"Wood\" Newton. The program was a considerable success and ran for four seasons and 98 episodes. This role earned him an Emmy Award.\n\nDuring the series' run, Reynolds also made a cameo in The Player (1992). He starred in a film aimed at children, Cop & 1/2 (1993), and two TV movies, Wind in the Wire (1993) and The Man from Left Field (1993); he also directed the latter, which co-starred Reba McEntire.[56]\n\nCharacter actor[]\n\nWhen Evening Shade ended, Reynolds played the lead in a horror film, The Maddening (1995). However, he gradually moved into being more of a character actor - he had key support roles in Citizen Ruth (1996), an early work from Alexander Payne, and Striptease (1996) with Demi Moore. He had to audition for the latter. The film's producer later said, \"To be honest, we were not enthusiastic at first. There was the hair and his reputation, but we were curious.\"[57] Reynolds got the role and earned some strong reviews.\n\nReynolds was a supporting actor in Frankenstein and Me (1996), Mad Dog Time(1996), The Cherokee Kid (1996), Meet Wally Sparks (1997) with Rodney Dangerfield, and Bean (1997) with Rowan Atkinson. He had the lead in Raven(1996), a straight-to-DVD action film. Around this time he claimed he was broke, having gone through $13 million.[57]\n\nIn 1996, Reynolds' agent said \"Regarding Burt, there's a split between the executives in town who are under 40 and those who are over 40. The younger executives are more open to Burt because they grew up loving Deliverance. But the older executives remember how crazy he was, and they are less receptive.\"[57]\n\nBoogie Nights and career revival[]\n\nReynolds appeared as an adult film director in the hit film Boogie Nights (1997), which was considered a comeback role for him; he received 12 acting awards and 3 nominations for the role, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Nevertheless, Reynolds refused to appear in Boogie Nights writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's subsequent film, Magnolia(1999), saying he hated working on the film and hated Anderson.[4][58]\n\nHe had the lead in Big City Blues (1997) and support roles in Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms (1998) and Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business (1998).\n\nReynolds returned to directing with Hard Time (1998) an action TV film starring himself. It led to two sequels, which he did not direct, Hard Time: The Premonition (1999) and Hard Time: Hostage Hotel (1999) (directed by Hal Needham).\n\nHe starred in the straight to video The Hunter's Moon (1999), Stringer (1999), and Waterproof (2000).\n\nReynolds played support roles in Pups (1999), Mystery, Alaska (1999) and had the lead in The Crew (2000) alongside Richard Dreyfuss.\n\nReynolds directed The Last Producer (2000), starring himself, and was second billed in Renny Harlin's Driven (2001), starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\nHe was also in Tempted (2001), Hotel (2001) directed by Mike Figgis, and The Hollywood Sign (2001).\n\nHe voiced Avery Carrington in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, released in 2002.[59]\n\nReynolds was top billed in Snapshots (2002) with Julie Christie, Time of the Wolf(2002), and Hard Ground (2003), and supported in Johnson County War (2002) with Tom Berenger, and Miss Lettie and Me (2003) with Mary Tyler Moore.\n\nReynolds was in a series of supporting roles that referred to earlier performances: Without a Paddle (2004), a riff on his role in Deliverance, The Longest Yard (2005), a remake of his 1974 hit with Adam Sandler playing Reynolds' old role; and The Dukes of Hazzard (2005) as Boss Hogg in a nod to his performances in 1970s car chase films.[60]\n\nReynolds continued to play lead roles in films such as Cloud 9 (2006), Forget About It (2006), Deal (2008), and A Bunch of Amateurs (2008), and supporting parts like End Game (2006), Grilled (2006), Broken Bridges (2006), In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007), Not Another Not Another Movie (2011), and Reel Love (2011).\n\nReynolds was top billed in Category 5 (2014) and Elbow Grease (2016) and could be seen in Pocket Listing (2014), and Hollow Creek (2015).
