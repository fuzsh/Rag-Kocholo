Growing up in the shadows of his famous father, many speculated he would be his father's sole heir after Reynold's demise. They were taken aback when his will was publicized.\n\nProfile summary\n\nFull nameQuinton Anderson ReynoldsGenderMaleBirthdate31 August 1988 Age35 years (as of July 2024)Zodiac signVirgoBirthplaceCalifornia, USAResidenceCalifornia, USANationalityAmericanEthnicityWhiteReligionChristianitySexualityStraightHeight5’10’’ (177 cm)Weight165 pounds (75 kg) Approx.Hair color Dark brownEye color BrownMarital statusSingleFatherBurt Reynolds MotherLoni AndersonSiblingsDeidra HoffmanAlma materCalifornia State UniversityQualificationDegree in Arts ProfessionCamera operator, editor, and digital image technicianPlace of workHollywood Net worth$1 million (Approx.)\n\nWho is Quinton Anderson Reynolds?\n\nAnderson is an American digital imaging technician, editor, camera assistant, and post-production assistant. He is widely recognized as the child of Loni Anderson and Burt Reynolds, who adopted him shortly after his birth.\n\nWhat is Quinton Anderson Reynolds' age?\n\nBurt Reynolds' son is 35 years old (as of July 2024). He was born on 31 August 1988, and his zodiac sign is Virgo.\n\nQuinton Anderson Reynolds' parents\n\nHis biological father and mother are unknown to the public.\n\nWho is Quinton Anderson Reynolds' father?\n\nHis father, American actor/director Burt Reynolds, had over 180 acting credits at the time of his death. He passed away from a heart attack on Thursday, 6 September 2018 at 82.\n\nReynolds died at Jupiter Medical in Florida, the state where he had spent most of his life. He died shortly before shooting for Once Upon a Time began in Hollywood.\n\nHis niece, Nancy Lee Hess, released a statement saying he had health issues, but his death was unexpected. In 2013, Reynolds was admitted to ICU in a hospital in Florida for flu treatment. He had started using a cane in the years, blaming his limited mobility on the stunts he performed while shooting films.\n\nBefore that, Burt was a football player and a certified stuntman before becoming a movie star. His years of injuries forced him to start taking prescription pills. As a result, he battled pain pill addiction throughout his life and ended up in rehab in the late 1990s.\n\nIn March 2010, Reynolds underwent bypass surgery at a Florida hospital. He underwent back surgery again in May 2009, which caused his prescription pill dependency.\n\nWho is Quinton Anderson Reynolds' mother?\n\nHis mother, Loni Anderson, is a renowned actress from the USA. She has received numerous honors, including two Emmy and three Golden Globe nominations.\n\nLoni and Burt were married for twelve years. He never had a child with his first wife, Judy Carne, and never remarried after divorcing the actress.\n\nFollowing their divorce in 1993, Quinton primarily lived with his mother in California, while Burt remained in Florida. The geographical distance strained their relationship, but they reconciled in later years.\n\nThe divorce of this Hollywood golden couple dominated magazine covers in the early 1990s. Things took an ugly turn as Reynolds revealed details of their failed marriage.\n\nHe claimed that he had not touched Anderson for three years and had even caught her cheating on him. In his memoir, Reynolds explained how the actress was extravagant.\n\nFor instance, he mentioned that he gave her a platinum American Express card with a $45,000 credit limit, which she spent in half an hour. She would also buy 'everything in triplicate' and demanded to be dressed 'like a star.'\n\nOn the other hand, Anderson accused Reynolds of physical abuse while he was under the influence of substances. She also claimed he was not timely with his $15,000 child support payments.\n\nDid Loni Anderson and Burt Reynolds have a child together?\n\nLoni Anderson has a biological daughter named Deidre Hoffman, whom Quinto considers a sister. Sometimes, people assume both are Burt Reynolds' children when they are not.\n\nLoni has been married four times and had Deidre with her first husband, Bruce Hasselberg. The actress never sired a child with her second husband, Ross Bickell, her third spouse, Burton Reynolds, or her current husband, Bob Flick.\n\nEducational background\n\nQuinton received his primary and high school education in California. He later enrolled at California State University and earned a degree in Arts.\n\nWhat does Quinton Anderson Reynolds do for a living?\n\nHe is an experienced editor, camera operator, post-production assistant, and digital imaging technician. Anderson has worked on various television shows and films since 2011.

He earns income as a camera operator, editor, and digital imaging technician.\n\nHow wealthy are Quinton Anderson Reynolds' parents?\n\nCelebritynetworth estimates Anderson's mother, Loni Anderson, is worth $12 million. Her wealth comes from her career as an actress and voice artist.\n\nThe same website states that his father, Burt Reynolds, had a net worth of around $5 million at his death in 2018. His wealth is from his acting, director, and voice artist career.\n\nIn his heyday, Burt would make $10 million per movie and owned a 153-acre ranch in South Florida. He began to lose money in 1993 after divorcing his second wife, Loni.\n\nThree years after the divorce, Reynolds filed for bankruptcy, claiming $6.65 million in assets and debts totaling $11.2 million. Most of his wealth dwindled before his death because he trusted the wrong people with his money, and \"women\" cost him the most.\n\nThe actor told Vanity Fair in 2015:\n\nI’ve lost more money than is possible because I just haven’t watched it. I’ve still done well in terms of owning property and things like that. But I haven’t been somebody who’s been smart about his money. There are a couple of actors who are quite brilliant with the way they’ve handled their money. But they’re not very good actors.\n\nBurt Reynolds' Ranch was sold to the Palm Beach County School District in 1999 for $3.8 million. The actor also sold his longtime waterfront home in Jupiter to his real estate tycoon friend and neighbor, Charles Modica, 2015 for $3.3million.\n\nReynolds lived out his final years at his Florida estate. A friend purchased the property and rented it to him for a low price while the film legend struggled.\n\nWhat happened to Quinton Reynolds?\n\nBurt Reynolds left Quinton out of his will in October 2011 and gave everything to his niece, Nancy Lee Brown Hess. The document was made public after his demise in September 2018.\n\nReynolds appointed Nancy Lee as the personal representative of his estate. If anything happened to Nancy Lee, his nephew Brian Ritchey Brown and another niece, Tracy Erin Rogers, were listed as the next personal representatives.\n\nWhy did Burt Reynolds leave his son out of his will?\n\nQuinton Anderson Reynolds was excluded from the late actor's will because Burt Reynolds had already established a trust for him. The will, which TMZ obtained, said of Quinton:\n\nI intentionally omit him from this, my Last Will and Testament, as I have provided for him during my lifetime in my Declaration of Trust.\n\nQuinton Anderson Reynolds' trust fund allowed Reynolds to provide for him while potentially reducing estate taxes. Hess may have been made the estate executor to avoid any conflict of interest, as Quinton was a beneficiary of the trust.\n\nWas Burt Reynolds close to his son?\n\nBurt and Quinton Anderson Reynolds shared a solid father-son relationship for 30 years. After Burt and Loni's divorce, Quinton and his mum moved miles away to start over.\n\nDespite the complexities in Burt and Quinton's relationship, they shared mutual respect and affection and reconnected in later years. Burt often spoke fondly of Quinton, referring to him as his \"greatest achievement,\" and was proud of his son's accomplishments.\n\nWhere is Quinton Reynolds today?\n\nBurt Reynolds' son works in Hollywood as a camera assistant. He never asked for help with his career; he did it all himself.\n\nIs Quinton Reynolds married?\n\nSince there is no record of Quinton Anderson Reynolds' wife online or in public records, people believe he is either single or keeps his marriage private.\n\nIs Quinton Anderson Reynolds on Wikipedia?\n\nHis biography is not on Wikipedia, but you can check out the life histories of his adopted parents on that website.\n\nHow tall is Quinton Anderson Reynolds?\n\nQuinton Anderson Reynolds' height is 5 feet 10 inches or 177 cm.\n\nFacts about Quinton Anderson Reynolds\n\nReynolds left Quinton out of his will.\n\nReynolds was Quinton's father for thirty years before he passed on.\n\nQuinton and his dad were temporarily estranged during Loni and Reynolds' public and bitter divorce.\n\nQuinton built his career alone rather than relying on his parents.\n\nBurt was proud of Quinton and considered him his greatest achievement.\n\nThe late Burt Reynolds's decision to exclude his son Quinton Anderson Reynolds from direct inheritance in his will sparked curiosity and speculation. Many assume Loni Anderson and Burt's divorce was the cause until they discovered the actor provided for Quinton through a Trust.\n\nYen.com.gh shared Lizzie Vaynerchuk's biography. She is an American businesswoman and the sister of American entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk.\n\nLizzie grew up in an entrepreneurial family and is enthusiastic about real estate. So, she works as a real estate agent. Lizzie met her husband at university, and they have two children.\n\nSource: YEN.com.gh"
