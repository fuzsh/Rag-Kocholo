        "text": "An American Icon\n\nBorn in Michigan in 1936, Burt Reynolds made his acting debut in the 1955 TV show “Gunsmoke.” From there, he got cast in the hit police show “Hawk” in the 60s, and his career took off. Reynolds became one of Hollywood’s most beloved and handsome movie stars, also earning the reputation of a stud symbol of the film industry.\n\nDuring the 70s, 80s, and 90s, Reynolds starred in some of Hollywood’s most classic films, like “Smokey and the Bandit,” “Deliverance,” “Boogie Nights,” and countless others. But what many don’t know is that off-screen, Reynolds had plenty of personal struggles, one of which was his many relationships with women.\n\nChris Evert\n\nChris Evert was the Serena Williams of the 70s — an incredibly successful athlete with 18 Grand Slams under her belt. Around 1977, she began dating Burt Reynolds, who was many years her senior (that's a full eighteen years in case you were wondering), but according to sources close to them, that’s exactly what Evert wanted.\n\nBeing a millionaire and a seasoned dater himself, Reynolds was obviously not intimidated by powerful and successful women. That's what we heard at least. And despite Evert being clear about not wanting anything serious at the time, the two ended up dating for quite a while.\n\nChris Evert – Now\n\nThis blonde athlete became one of the world’s greatest tennis players, with records only beaten by Serena Williams and Steffi Graf. But this sports superstar also had her fair share of heartbreaks. Somewhat of a serial monogamist, Evert was married three times. All three of her marriages ended in divorce. She divorced her third husband, fellow tennis athlete John Lloyd after two previous unsuccessful marriages.\n\nNowadays, Evert focuses her time and energy on her tennis school in Florida, often coming in as a lecturer herself, passing her knowledge and expertise to the stars of the future. Also, she’s the publisher of a prestigious tennis magazine.\n\nMamie Van Doren\n\nActress, singer, and iconic symbol Mamie Van Doren was huge in the 50s. Just look at her picture. It's easy to see why. She made her debut role in 1957’s “Untamed Youth” and drove every man in the world wild. Often compared to Marylin Monroe, since they were both blonde and incredibly beautiful, Mamie had her share of men orbiting around her.\n\nIn the early 1970s, one of these men was Burt Reynolds. The two movie stars had a brief fling, and Mamie spilled the beans about their encounters, comparing Reynolds to a fast food place – “high on jive, but low on substance.” Yikes!\n\nMamie Van Doren – Now\n\nMamie went on to have a stellar acting career that spanned more than five decades and shot back to fame in 1987 with the release of her autobiography, \"Playing the Field,\" which caused quite a stir. The book was a tell-all of every juicy and intimate detail of the actress’s life, and readers couldn’t get enough of it.\n\nShe then took up singing again and released several albums, such as “Still a Troublemaker,” in 2011. While she and Burt Reynolds never got married, the woman has walked down the aisle no less than five times! Her fifth husband is actor Thomas Dixon and the two are still together.\n\nSally Field\n\nOf the many women that Reynolds was involved with, Sally Field was something else. The actor once admitted that Field had been the love of his life. The two stars met on the set of “Smokey and the Bandit” in 1977 and were in an on-and-off relationship for the next five years. That sounds like a long time for such a relationship if you ask us.\n\nTheir chemistry on and off the screen was undeniable, but Reynolds was ultimately too much of a ladies’ man to keep Field. Decades later, the actor said losing her was the biggest regret of his life. At least they remained good friends.\n\nSally Field – Now\n\nSince her role in “Smokey and the Bandit,” Sally Fields has starred in some of Hollywood’s most famous films, becoming a household name. With two Emmys, two Academy Awards, and several accolades, Field has had a stellar career.\n\nHer roles in “Forrest Gump,” “Lincoln,” “Steel Magnolias,” and TV series like “ER” and “Brothers and Sisters” have proven this actress can do anything. As for her personal life, she’s been divorced twice but has three beautiful children to make up for it. Look for her in \"80 for Brady\", where she stars with a few more of the headline-making women of her caliber.\n\nJudy Carne\n\nJudy Carne was an English actress that first became famous through the TV hit “Fair Exchange.” Mainly known for her comedic roles, Carne was then cast in “The Baileys of Balboa,” “Danger Man,” “The Rag Trade,” and others.\n\nShe was also Reynolds's first wife. Yup, even that ladies' man couldn't resist her European charms and found himself putting a ring on her. Back in 1963, when she had recently migrated to the U.S., she met the legendary star, and after a brief dating period, they got married. Sadly, the marriage only lasted two years, and they ended up divorcing in 1965.\n\nJudy Carne – Now\n\nIt appears that whatever roller coaster her personal life was on skipped her professional life as her acting career seems unaffected by her choice of spouse. After she divorced Reynolds, Carne went on to appear in hit American TV shows, such as “Love on a Rooftop,” “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” and even a guest role in the hit show “Gidget.”\n\nThe British actress remarried in 1970 to producer Robert Bergmann, but that relationship was even shorter, as the two divorced just a year later. Sadly, Carne succumbed to pneumonia in 2015 and passed away in England. Her on-screen work is still viewed worldwide.\n\nKate Edelman\n\nBurt Reynolds wasn't only set on dating actresses and athletes. The mustached macho met producer Kate Edelman in the early 2000s, and she was no stranger to the spotlight. Edelman had spent many years in the film industry working for her father, Louis Edelman, on the set of hit TV shows “Tin Pan Alley” and “The Big Valley.”\n\nShe started dating Reynolds in 2003 when both of them were at a different, more mature stage in their lives. The couple lived together for some time until Edelman called it quits and left Reynolds heartbroken, according to close friends of the couple.\n\nKate Edelman — Now\n\nReynolds wasn’t the only entertainment industry man in Edelman’s life. Before him, she was married to hotshot movie lawyer Deane Johnson, who left her the rights to the classic film “A Streetcar Named Desire.” Rights any person in their right mind would love to have.\n\nEdelman, who is a known philanthropist, is not one to keep it all to herself and decided to share the wealth. She donated most of those profits to The Motion Picture and TV Fund and an Alzheimer’s research foundation. Deane Johnson, whom she remarried after Reynolds, had a long and hard battle with the disease before passing away.\n\nTammy Wynette\n\nCountry music singer Tammy Wynette, who you might remember from her hit singles such as \"Stand by Your Man\" and \"I Don't Wanna Play House,\" was one of Reynolds’ secret affairs. At the time the two got involved, Reynolds was dating singer Dinah Shore, so they tried to keep the fling under wraps.\n\nUnfortunately for them, Wynette’s good friend Loretta Lynn made the affair public when she told the press she’d found Tammy hiding in her dressing room. It turns out she was hiding from Shore, who was also present at the same show. Needless to say, Wynette and Reynolds called it a day.\n\nTammy Wynette — Now\n\nDespite her slipup with Reynolds, Tammy Wynette went on to become one of America’s most beloved and famous country music stars. The famous song “Stand By Your Man” was her biggest hit, and it earned her the nickname of “First Lady of Country Music.”\n\nWynette had more than 20 chart-topping hits and is admired in the country music industry for having paved the way for women in the genre to break ground. She passed away at age 55 in 1998. Though her life was cut short, she did manage to have quite an impressive romantic record, having exchanged vows and rings five times.\n\nLori Nelson\n\nNoir crime and horror queen of the 50s, Lori Nelson is credited with being the original scream queen. Throughout the 50s and 60s, Nelson had a very prolific career in Hollywood, acting in hits like “Revenge of the Creature” and “I Died a Thousand Times.”\n\nReynolds and Lori met in 1960, and she, being the beauty that she was, had Reynolds smitten. They dated for a while and even got engaged, making people believe that this couple was going to go all the way, however, the engagement didn't stick it out and the two never made it to the altar.\n\nLori Nelson – Now\n\nBy the time Lori left Reynolds, she was on her way out of Hollywood. She took on small roles for the next years, such as in “Black Gaucho” and “Mom, Can I Keep Her?”. Lori stayed true to her horror film routes, starring in the horror comedy “The Naked Monster” in 2005.\n\nNelson got married twice after she broke off her engagement with Reynolds and had two children with her first husband, American composer Johnny Mann. She died peacefully at age 87 in 2020 at her house in Los Angeles, survived by her second husband Joe Reiner. Both her daughters are actresses as well.\n\nAdrienne Barbeau\n\nStockard Channing, please step aside and make way for the original Rizzo. The beautiful actress and singer Adrienne Barbeau had her big break after playing Rizzo in the 1970s Broadway musical “Grease.” Then she starred in the hit TV comedy show “Maude” as Carol Traynor, which earned her a Golden Globe. Barbeau crossed paths with Reynolds in 1981 while on the set of “The Cannonball Run” and the two obviously took notice of each other.\n\nReynolds was dating Sally Field at the time, so the exact moment he and Barbeau started getting involved is unknown. Though they dated for several months, the relationship never became anything serious.\n\nAdrienne Barbeau — Now\n\nBarbeau became one of Hollywood’s leading horror actresses, starring in early 80’s films like “The Fog,” “Swamp Thing,” and “Creepshow.” Very much on par with her career in horror, she married famous horror film director John Carpenter in 1979. The two had a son together. Sadly, however, things didn't last, and the two divorced five years later.\n\nIn 1992, she married a playwright with whom she had two kids and stayed for over two decades. As for her career, this actress is very much still in the game; in fact, she recently guest starred in the TV show “Sons of Anarchy.”\n\nLoni Anderson\n\nAnother actress on Reynolds’s long list of women was blonde sweetheart Loni Anderson. Anderson shot to fame through her role as Jennifer Marlowe on the memorable 1978 sitcom, “WKRP in Cincinnati.” She met Reynolds in 1983 while filming the comedy movie “Stroker Ace.”\n\nThey dated for the better part of five years, ultimately tying the knot in 1988. But five years and an adopted son later, the two got divorced, and it was very public and nasty. They were known for having a rocky relationship that got splashed all over the press. Reynolds found himself bankrupt just paying for alimony.\n\nLoni Anderson — Now\n\nDespite an ugly divorce and several years in the courts, Anderson remarried in 2008. In fact, that marriage was her fourth, having been married twice before she met Reynolds. The sweet Anderson continued to have a successful acting career. She’s appeared in TV shows like “My Sister Is So Gay” and “Baby Daddy.”\n\nAs for her roles on the big screen, you can catch her in “3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain” and “A Night at the Roxbury.” Anderson is also a devoted spokeswoman for chronic pulmonary disease since both her parents were affected by the illness. None of her kids are in show business.\n\nFaye Dunaway\n\nFaye Dunaway is not the kind of woman who needs to be introduced but we are going to do that anyway. The “Bonnie and Clyde” and “Chinatown” star Faye Dunaway also dated Burt Reynolds. During the 70s and 80s, Dunaway was at the height of her acting career, and so was Reynolds. Presumably, it was why the two bonded over. The two met through mutual friends and quickly got along.\n\nThey dated for a short time, but nothing serious ever came of it. It seems Reynolds had a thing for beautiful and talented actresses, even though they often meant trouble.\n\nFaye Dunaway — Now\n\nDespite having a very successful acting career, Dunaway is known for being a very private person. Though, granted, back when social media wasn't a thing it may have been a little easier to keep things under wraps. This woman's talent, however, is undeniable; she continues to act to this day.\n\nWhile her earlier work is definitely the more memorable part of her career, with films like “Mommie Dearest” and “Three Days of the Condor,” Dunaway has made some unforgettable appearances in 2017’s “The Bye Bye Man” and “The American Connection.” Dunaway married twice after leaving Reynolds and has one son.\n\nTawny Little\n\nHer last name may be Little, but her career is undeniably grand. Tawny Little is an American media personality that earned her fame by winning the Miss America competition in 1976 and Miss New York in 1975. In the early 1980s, the fabulous Little met the dashing Burt Reynolds, and not surprisingly, he was taken by her beauty.\n\nWhen they first met, Little was married, but it took her a short few weeks after her divorce to start dating Reynolds. The handsome couple lasted two years, and in 1983, they broke it off, and Little remarried and continued with her life.\n\nTawny Little — Now\n\nAfter Reynolds, Little got married to John Schneider, who you might remember as one of the stars of “Dukes of Hazard,” whom she spent three years with. As far as her career went, she became a reporter on the Los Angeles-based station KABC-TV. Little became the host of several shows, including “AM Los Angeles,” “Hollywood Closeup,” and “The Love Report.”\n\nBut those weren’t her only appearances on the screen; Little also appeared in hit films like “Money Talks” and “Rocky II.” She remarried twice more after Schneider and had three children, none of which have chosen a career similar to hers.\n\nCatherine Deneuve\n\nThe stunning French actress, model, and singer Catherine Deneuve is considered by many to be one of the best actress Europe has produced. Her claim to fame came in the early 60s with her role in “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” and “Belle de Jour.”\n\nIn 1975, she landed a role in “Hustle,” which she starred in with Burt Reynolds. After spending days and nights together on set and practicing lines, a real-life romance blossomed. Deneuve said that Reynolds made her laugh, and she loved spending time with him; however, after some months of a passionate affair, they broke it off.\n\nCatherine Deneuve — Now\n\nDeneuve went on to have an incredibly successful career, appearing in more than a hundred films, including “Dancer in the Dark,” “Repulsion,” “8 Women”, and many others. The French beauty continued to model and even created her own signature perfume in 1986.\n\nDeneuve keeps working to this day, appearing in high-profile Hollywood films. She’s also quite involved in French politics and is constantly volunteering and donating to charities around the world. While Deneuve had been married once (her divorce became final a few years before meeting Reynolds), she hasn't remarried since. She does, however, have two children who follow in her showbiz footsteps.\n\nDinah Shore\n\nSinger and actress Dinah Shore became famous in the 1940s when she first started singing on the radio. A decade later, she became a TV actress and really shot to fame. Shore appeared in several popular shows in the 50s, with the most famous being her own show, “The Dinah Shore Show.” Shore stayed on the screen throughout the 1970s, which is around the time she met Burt Reynolds.\n\nThis blonde beauty was 20 years older than Reynolds, but that never seemed to be a problem. They had a loving relationship that lasted four years and finally went their separate ways.\n\nDinah Shore – Now\n\nIt seems that Shore had a thing for younger men, seeing as all her partners and husbands after Reynolds were considerably younger than her. By the end of the 1970s, Shore started appearing less and less on the screen until finally retiring from her entertainment career.\n\nShore was an avid golfer, so much so that she founded the Dinah Shore Gold Tournament and became a Ladies PGA Hall of Fame member in 1994. Unfortunately, she passed away from cancer that same year. Her biological daughter, Melissa, is an actress too, and her adopted son, John, doesn't pursue entertainment as a career.\n\nLorna Luft\n\nLorna Luft might not be as famous as her mother, Judy Garland, or her half-sister Liza Minelli, but she’s certainly an actress and singer in her own right. Like any high-profile woman in the entertainment industry, she too had a publicized romance. Throughout the 70s and 80s, Luft starred in several movies and TV shows, and she also met Reynolds.\n\nFor a short year, from 1974 to 1975, Luft and Reynolds were an item, making headlines whenever spotted together. But after breaking it off, Luft stayed single for two years before getting married to musician Jake Hooker, leaving the press having to find something else to talk about.\n\nLorna Luft – Now\n\nLuft and Jake Hooker stayed together for an impressive 16 years and had two children. They divorced in 1993, right at the time when Luft was on a worldwide tour. Those of you who weren't around during the 70s and 80s might still know her face. Luft kept working as a singer and actress, often appearing in reality TV shows like “Style Court” and the comedy show “Sean Saves the World.”\n\nShe eventually remarried for a second time to musician Colin Freeman in 1996. All in all, Luft has done pretty well for herself after her stint with Reynolds ended.\n\nSarah Miles\n\nWith a prolific film career, it is no surprise that many of Burt Reynolds's romantic partners over the years were first introduced to him as his on-screen partners. Another actress on Reynolds’s list was Sarah Miles. The two stars met while filming “The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing” in 1973. It was a Western romance, and Reynolds and Miles had so much chemistry on the set that they fell for each other in real life.\n\nMiles was recently divorced, so she and Reynolds didn’t get too serious, but they did date for some months. And apparently, according to mutual friends, they were quite crazy about each other.\n\nSarah Miles – Now\n\nThe British actress went on to act in several renowned films, including “The Servant,” “Blowup,” “Ryan’s Daughter,” “Hope and Glory,” and many others. More than ten years after divorcing her husband, Robert Bolt, the two got back together in 1988 and stayed together until his unfortunate passing in 1995.\n\nMiles continued her acting career, starring in the hit TV mystery “Poirot” and then in “Interlude City of a Dead Woman” in 2016. She has one son, Thomas Bolt, who has dabbled in acting as well, though there aren't many credits to his name. You can see him for yourself guest-starring in an episode of the 80s show \"Shoestring.\"\n\nPam Seals\n\nOne of Reynolds’s most tumultuous relationships was the one with bartender Pam Seals. Back in 1989, Seals appeared on a show that Reynolds was starring in — the crime TV series “B.L. Stryker.” The two hit it off right away and began a relationship that lasted a long ten years, most of which seemed to be happy ones. They even got engaged.\n\nHowever, towards the end of the relationship, things got ugly between the two. It turns out that Reynolds sued Seals for extortion, claiming that the bartender had tried to take half of his money by saying that he abused her.\n\nPam Seals – Now\n\nFor years, the lawsuit between Reynolds and Seals went on, with the latter claiming that Reynolds had given her huge amounts of money, private assistants, a house, cars, and more during the time they were together. This was all true, and it seems when they broke up, she wasn’t ready to give up the lifestyle.\n\nReynolds apparently gave her some extra money when he left so she could get back on her feet, but she wanted more. Nowadays, Seals works as a realtor. It appears that her specialty is luxury properties in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida so if you're looking for anything of the sort, she will be happy to help.\n\nDoris Day\n\nBurt Reynolds and Doris Day had a complicated relationship. (Though, honestly, with the man's track record, it seems like most of his relationships were complicated as a prerequisite.) Both were wildly successful in their respective Hollywood careers, with Day being a renowned singer-actor who had 12 top hit singles. While their working relationship looked tight on the surface, their personal one seemed to be marred by some unspoken tension.\n\nEven though sources confirm the pair were an item for a brief period, they never admitted their affair to the public, and until this day, only Reynolds and Day know what really went on.\n\nDoris Day – Now\n\nDoris Day didn’t give up on love after Reynolds. Far from it, in fact — she was married four times. Among her husbands were producer Martin Melcher and saxophonist George Weidler. Unfortunately, after her husband Martin passed away in 1968, Day had to file for bankruptcy and went straight back to work.\n\nShe remarried in 1976 to restaurateur Barry Comden, whom she stayed with until 1982. Day kept working until her senior years, and she even released an album in 2011 called “My Heart.” She passed away in 2019. It was the last album in a long line featuring no less than a staggering thirty-two studio albums!\n\nSalome Jens\n\nYou might recognize Salome Jens from the 1990s “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,” where she played the Female Changeling for five years. But Jens actually came to fame long before that, during the 50s and 60s, especially after starring in 1961’s “Angel Baby,” where she met Reynolds. It was the first in a long list of relationships that Reynolds had with women he met at work.\n\nWhile the filming went on, Jens and Reynolds had a passionate love affair, but since this was Reynolds's acting debut, he became one of the most coveted men in Hollywood. Let’s just say that committing to one woman wasn’t in his plans back then.\n\nSalome Jens – Now\n\nJens is definitely most known for her “Star Trek” role (trust any sci-fi fans community to keep their beloved show going long after it has run its course), but she continued acting on screen and on stage, having a very successful career. She appeared in 2011’s “Green Lantern\" and the 2016 comedy “Norm of the North.”\n\nTelevision was also in the cards for Jens, as she appeared in the hit TV show “Melrose Place\" for a year during the early 90s and “The Event,” a show that aired in 2010. After her fling with Reynolds, she met Ralph Meeker, whom she married in 1964. The marriage only lasted two years, though.\n\nKim Basinger\n\nKim Basinger needs no introduction – this blonde beauty has been a Hollywood staple since the late 70s. With her sunny beach girl look, not surprisingly, Basinger started out as a model before she became an actress, getting her first roles after appearing in a series of TV ads. She met Reynolds in 1976 when she’d already made guest appearances in the hit TV show “Charlie’s Angels.”\n\nThe young stars only dated for a brief period, but it was Basinger’s first time dating an actor. (Though it wasn't the last.) Basinger herself was about to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars of that era.\n\nKim Basinger – Now\n\nBasinger went on to become a leading lady in Hollywood, appearing in hit films like “L.A. Confidential,” “Never Say Never Again,” where she played a Bond girl, and of course, her role as Vicki Vale in 1989’s “Batman.”\n\nBasinger continues acting to this day, most recently appearing in the TV show “Comrade Detective” and the steamy drama blockbuster “Fifty Shades Darker,” both in 2017. Basinger got married twice, once to makeup artist Ron Snyder and the second time to the famous actor Alec Baldwin, whom she divorced in 2002. Basinger and Baldwin are the parents of fashion model Ireland Baldwin.\n\nInger Stevens\n\nInger Stevens was a Swedish-American film actress who starred in major Hollywood movies in the late 50s and the 60s. Most known for her role in the 1963 show “The Farmer’s Daughter,” she went on to star in famous westerns like “Hang ‘Em High,” “House of Cards,” and many more.\n\nIn 1970, she got cast in the drama film “Run Simon, Run” alongside Burt Reynolds. In a true Burt Renolds form, it was then that they began their affair, which according to close sources, was quite tumultuous. They often broke up and got back together, having a rollercoaster of a romance.\n\nInger Stevens – Now\n\nUnfortunately, Stevens’s successful acting career came to a halt after her performance in “Run Simon, Run.” At the young age of 35, Stevens died of substance abuse shortly after breaking things off with Reynolds. Some sources claim the incident was not connected to their breakup, and some say the death was an accidental overdose, while others claim it was intentional.\n\nWhile her life was shorter than most, romantically, she has had an impressive track record having been married twice. Once to Ike Jones and once to Anthony Soglio. Stevens will forever be remembered as the sweet, witty, and talented actress that she was.\n\nMiko Mayama\n\nBeautiful and talented Japanese-American actress Miko Mayama met Reynolds in 1969. They were both on the set of the adventure film “Impasse” and immediately took a liking to each other. Reynolds and Mayama moved in together and had a relationship that lasted four years.\n\nEverything was going great until Reynolds met TV host Dinah Shore while on a talk show and instantly fell for her. Reynolds returned home to Mayama and told her he had fallen in love, but he was giving her their beach apartment, his Cadillac, and an allowance of $500 per week. Mayama moved out hours later.\n\nMiko Mayama — Now\n\nMayama ended up marrying Barbra Streisand’s manager and has had a very successful acting career. Did you know that she is also trained as a Kabuki theater actress? That's what she did in Japan before moving to the US. She’s starred in “Star Trek,” “It Takes a Thief,” “The Hawaiians,” “The War Wagon,” and many more.\n\nMayama’s last screen appearance was in the hit 1979 TV show “M*A*S*H,” and she’s since then retired. However, for a woman that learned English through watching “Bugs Bunny” cartoons, according to Reynolds's autobiography, Mayama certainly made a life and career for herself worthy of admiring.\n\nFarrah Fawcett\n\nThe blonde stunner, hair trendsetter, and “Charlie’s Angels” star Farrah Fawcett was also romantically involved with Burt Reynolds. Fawcett, with her look, image, and career, was right up Reynolds's alley. They met while on the set of 1981’s “The Cannonball Run,” and Reynolds was in his 23-year gap between marriages, having divorced Judy Carne in 1965 and not marrying again until 1988.\n\nDuring this period, Reynolds and Fawcett dated for a while, with both actors describing the relationship as fun, passionate, and problem-free. Honestly, we would be surprised if it was described as anything else. We're just sad it didn't last.\n\nFarrah Fawcett – Now\n\nFawcett went on to have a long and happy relationship with famous actor Ryan O’Neal, with whom she had a son. Interestingly, the two never married. They lived as partners from '79 to '97 and then got back together in 2001. As for her career, she enjoyed a long and successful run as one of Hollywood’s leading ladies. Fawcett starred in hits like “The Six Million Dollar Man,” “Logan’s Run,” “Extremities,” “The Burning Bed,” and several others.\n\nShe was nominated for four Emmys and six Golden Globes. Sadly, Fawcett passed away from cancer in 2009, leaving behind a legendary memory.\n\nGoldie Hawn\n\nAnother Hollywood queen that needs no introduction is Goldie Hawn. Apart from her gorgeous looks, her acting talent has proved to be one of the best in the industry, which didn't go unnoticed by Reynolds. Since the late 1960s, Hawn has been gracing our screens with her sweet and quirky roles.\n\nHawn met Reynolds in 1982 while on the set of “Best Friends.” The two stars dated for a short time and then called it quits as they were apparently not the right match for each other. We imagine that was around the time that Hawn met partner Kurt Russell in 1983.\n\nGoldie Hawn – Now\n\nGoldie Hawn and Kurt Russell are together to this day, and even though they never married, the two seem to be one of the happiest couples in Hollywood. In her professional life, Hawn became one of the world’s most famous actresses.\n\nShe’s starred in Hollywood classics, such as “Bird on a Wire,” “Private Benjamin,” “Death Becomes Her,” “Shampoo,” “The First Wives Club,” and countless more. Hawn had two children with her second husband, Bill Hudson, including famous actress Kate Hudson. She also has a son with Kurt Russell. Her Instagram account is full of lovely pieces she shares from her everyday life.\n\nLauren Hutton\n\nThe beautiful Lauren Hutton began her career as a model in her hometown of South Carolina. She quickly realized she had the potential to do bigger things and moved to New York to find work. This turned out to be the right decision for her. In New York, she was able to transition to acting and have her breakthrough role in the 1968 film “Paper Lion.”\n\nShe met Burt Reynolds on the set of the 1981 film “Paternity,” and the two got close off-screen as well. They dated for no more than several months, but nothing serious ever came of it.\n\nLauren Hutton — Now\n\nHutton has had a stellar acting career, starring in big Hollywood productions like “The Gambler,” “American Gigolo,” “Paper Dolls,” and many more. As for her personal life, Hutton never married, but she did have a notable 27-year relationship with Bob Williamson, who was her manager.\n\nHe passed in 1997, but Hutton has said on several occasions that Bob saved her life in more ways than one and made sure that the grueling industry in which she worked doesn't get the best of her. Castmates' accounts paint her as a relatable, down-to-earth woman. Hutton’s latest screen appearance was in the 2018 film “I Feel Pretty.”\n\nLucie Arnaz\n\nIf the name Lucie Arnaz sounds familiar, it’s because this actress is the daughter of the famous Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. (We don't think there are many more famous Arnazes out there.) Fitting in with her parents, she started appearing on screen as a child, on her mother’s show, “Here’s Lucy,” and then took on independent roles in the mid-70s.\n\nArnaz and Reynolds met in the early 70s and dated for a year and a half, from 1974 to 1975. Sadly for Arnaz, Reynolds met Sally Field in 1975 and fell head over heels for her, so they broke it off.\n\nLucie Arnaz – Now\n\nLucie Arnaz married actor Phil Vandervort in 1971 and divorced him in 1979. She then remarried actor Laurence Luckinbill in 1980, and the two are still together to this day. The two share three kids on top of the two sons he has from a previous marriage. Professionally, Arnaz continued acting, landing roles in several famous productions, including “Law & Order,” “Will & Grace,” “Murder, She Wrote,” and several others.\n\nAlthough she’s appeared in a handful of films, Arnaz has mostly stuck to television. She was also the executive producer for the biographical film about her parents, “Being the Ricardos,” in 2021.\n\nChris Noel\n\nChris Noel is a former American actress who became most known during the 1960s due to her roles in beach party movies like “Get Yourself a College Girl” and her dedicated work on the Armed Forces Radio and TV Service. This blonde beauty was often called “The Voice of Vietnam,” as she was the main entertainer for U.S. troops during the Vietnam War.\n\nShe met Burt Reynolds when she returned to the U.S. from her stint in Vietnam in 1967. They dated for a while, and people were even expecting Reynolds to propose, but in 1968 he met actress Miko Mayama and fell for her.\n\nChris Noel – Now\n\nWhile the Vietnam War is long gone, and so is Noel's part in it, she is still remembered for it. Even though Chris Noel retired from her acting career in the late 1980s, she’s appeared in several documentaries about the Vietnam War in the 2000s. Noel married a Green Beret captain named Ty Herrington in 1969, but sadly, their marriage only lasted 11 months as he tragically took his own life.\n\nShe remarried three more times after that but had no children. Well into her 80 years of age, Noel is still remembered as the ray of sunshine that made troops smile during such terrible wartimes.\n\nColleen Brennan\n\nColleen Brennan was a beautiful, red-haired dancer that was discovered by an agent in the early 70s. After her role in 1973’s “The Dirty Mind of Young Sally,” Brennan became one of the most famous adult film stars in Hollywood. She only appeared in two mainstream films, including “Shampoo” and “Hustle,” where she met Burt Reynolds.\n\nReynolds and Brennan had a brief fling while on set, but it didn’t last long. Reynolds quickly became infatuated with his other co-star, Catherine Deneuve. It seems that Burt's list of lovers overlaps the list of his film credits. You're a female who was scripted to play his love interest? It's only a matter of time until he sweeps you off your feet!\n\nColleen Brennan — Now\n\nIt seems that a mainstream film career was never in the stars for Colleen Brennan. Sure, she has been seen in theaters for a film or two, but that's about it. Brennan went on to act in several adult films throughout her career, winning various awards in the industry. However, she retired in the late 80s and set up a business working from home.\n\nEven though Brennan dated quite a lot, including famous actor Warren Beatty, she never settled down or got married. However, this fiery redhead will always be remembered as one of the most desirable women of the 70s and most of the 80s.\n\nAsa Maynor\n\nAsa Maynor is an Alabama-born actress that started her career in the late 1950s. She too gets to go into the infamous club of women who got to know Burt Reynolds in a way nobody else did. Maynor is known for “Man-Beast,” “Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,” “Promise Her Anything,” and dozens of other film titles.\n\nShe met Burt Reynolds around 1965, shortly after his divorce from Judy Carne had been finalized. The two actors were rumored to have an affair that only their closest friends knew about since Maynor was married to actor Edd Byrnes back then.\n\nAsa Maynor — Now\n\nMaynor broke it off with Reynolds after a short period of dating and tried to make her marriage work with Byrnes. For a while, it seemed like things were looking up for her marriage life — she and Bynes had a child together. However, they ultimately divorced in 1971. Maynor never remarried.\n\nThat being said, she did continue to have a successful acting career and even became a producer. In the 2000s, she appeared in the 2014 movie “Flight 7500” and the 2017 documentary, “The Fabulous Alan Carr.” Maynor’s son, Logan Byrnes, grew up to become a well-known TV anchor.\n\nA Lasting Legacy\n\nBurt Reynolds passed away from a heart attack in September 2018 at the age of 82. His son and ex-wife, Loni Anderson, held a private memorial for him, though their definition of \"private\" is not exactly what you'd expect: it was attended by a long list of friends, exes, relatives, and colleagues. Sally Field and Dolly Parton were among the many people that spoke out in tribute to Reynolds, saying he was a kind-hearted soul that would forever be remembered.\n\nDespite his reputation as a ladies' man back in his heyday, Reynolds was always a gentleman and a good person, and he left a lasting legacy to prove it."
