        "text": "Throughout her life as a royal, Diana, Princess of Wales was never far from the headlines. Now, it has been confirmed that she once thanked the Hollywood star Burt Reynolds for granting her a brief reprieve from being in the spotlight, after his acrimonious divorce from Loni Anderson meant the royal was no longer front page news for once in 1995.\n\nConfirming the rumour on this week's episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Reynolds' ex-wife simply laughed when asked by a fan about the story, and said, 'yes, it's true'. She did not elaborate further.\n\nThe sweet story first emerged in Reynolds' 2015 memoir Enough About Me, he wrote: 'We called it quits after five years of marriage. When we announced the separation, the press went into high gear. Princess Diana sent me a thank-you note for keeping her off the cover of People magazine.'\n\nTabloid favourites ever since 1982 when the two glamorous stars first started dating, Reynolds and Anderson married in 1988, but broke up five years later when she served him with divorce papers. The split was an ugly one, with accusations of infidelity, abuse and bad parenting, and it played out in court for several years until a settlement was reached in the late 1990s.\n\nThe Hollywood couple's sensational court appearances and bitter disputes occurred at the same time as the separation and divorce of Diana and Prince Charles, when newspapers contained daily updates on the fallout of the couple's split, including Charles' affair with the then Camilla Parker Bowles, now Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nReynolds and Anderson reconciled later in life, and she attended his funeral in 2018.\n\nSubscribe now for a trial offer of 3 issues for £1 plus free digital editions and home delivery.\n\nMore from Tatler"
