She was married to Reynolds from 1988 to 1994 and has been married to Bob Flick since 2008.\n\nThe actress says, \"As a surprise, Burt invited Fred to dinner. As he came down the stairs, he did a whole tap number.\"\n\nHowever, Astaire isn't the one who made her feel truly starstruck. \"The most famous person in my phone book was Cary Grant. When I met him, I was a blithering idiot,\" she admits. \"He became a friend, but I never got over my crush.\"\n\nCelebrities Who Have Gotten Starstruck Meeting Fellow A-Listers: Emma Stone, Jake Gyllenhaal, Brad Pitt and More\n\nThe cast of Anderson’s new film, Ladies of the ’80s: A Divas Christmas, would leave Us feeling like fangirls.

My secret talents are that I play the piano — but not great enough to really astound you with it or do it on a show — and I do impressions.\n\n2. My first car was a turquoise Chevy Impala convertible with white leather interior and moon hubcaps. I talked about it so much that when I was married to Burt [Reynolds], he had a lovely painting done of my car and I still have it hanging up.\n\n3. The most famous person in my phone book was Cary Grant. When I met him, I was a blithering idiot. He became a friend, but I never got over my crush.\n\n4. I had a little thing for Elvis Presley growing up. Everybody liked him, and I didn’t want to be like everyone else, but I was.\n\nElvis Presley’s Family Guide: Ex-Wife Priscilla, Daughter Lisa Marie and 4 Grandchildren\n\n5. I love a black tank top [that’s] stretchy, shapely and goes with everything.\n\n6. I learned to cook from my grandma, so fattening German food is my favorite thing to make.\n\n7. I’m a mystery fanatic. I could sit down anytime and find something new in rereading The Big Sleep.\n\n8. I must see The Uninvited at least once a year.\n\n9. My favorite TV shows are Dateline and Forensic Files.\n\n10. My best subject in school was science.\n\n11. I’m a meditator. To decompress, I close out the world and meditate. That may also include a book. I leave my world and join somebody else’s.\n\n12. The beauty product I swear by is moisturizer, moisturizer, moisturizer.\n\n13. I’m a great fisherman.\n\n14. My parents were WWII sweethearts and used to sing Louis Armstrong’s “It’s Been a Long, Long Time” in their bedroom, which was right next door to mine. I loved hearing them sing together.\n\nCelebs and Their Famous Doppelgangers: Katy Perry and Zooey Deschanel, Daniel Radcliffe and Elijah Wood and More\n\n15. I’m most often mistaken for Dolly Parton, but in the era of all of us in the’80s, [I was mistaken for] Farrah Fawcett.\n\n16. I really don’t drink, but I love champagne.\n\n17. A Christmas doesn’t go by that I don’t make my Swedish meatballs.\n\n18. When I was married to Burt, I had never met Fred Astaire and loved him. As a surprise, Burt invited Fred to dinner.

Herb Alpert was the first concert I ever went to.\n\n22. Growing up, I wanted to be Doris Day in the worst way. I was gushing when I met her.\n\n23. I realized I had “made it” after WKRP in Cincinnati first aired. My daughter and I went window shopping in Beverly Hills, and I was accosted by people and paparazzi.\n\n24. Italy is my favorite place to vacation, and I love Venice because of the water.\n\n25. My favorite room is my bedroom because I’m close to makeup, hair, wardrobe, intimacy and TV if I want it."
