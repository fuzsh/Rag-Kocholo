        "text": "Well, to me, \"bought the farm\" is an aviation colloquialism and hardly disrespectful. It is like saying \"Judy Carne has played her last role.\".\n\nIn this particular case, I suppose it's like my \"outrage\" to say that of fighters, military men, who \"went out like rock stars\". To me when I heard that, that seemed insulting for to me it reference the rock stars of the 60's who played their songs while others went to war and died............................\n\n....................................but I am told that these days, it is a great compliment.\n\nGetting back to \"bought the farm\", aviation wise, why might that be a compliment? Because you go out doing what you like to do.\n\nSpeaking of the 60's, that is, of course, where I know her from, where I was introduced to her, and hence, know of her painful history, both personally and professionally.\n\nIn the latter, it is interesting, if not distressful, to see two women, Judy Carne and Goldie Hawn, starting at the same place, and ending up is such different places. I recall reading something on Goldie once, from back then, where she was in tears or such because Judy got to be the Cola Girl in advertisements and Goldie's agent passed that up. Was he really working for her?\n\n\"Listen, I am working for you. Do you want to be something like that now or someone decades from now that people leave their living rooms at night to go out and see you at the movie theatre?\"\n\nSIGH, how true it was.\n\nThere's a blast from the past-- Laugh-in and Love in a Rooftop.\n\nI remember when Burt Reynolds (her ex-husband) sub- hosted for Johnny Carson, and he invited her on as his first guest. She accepted, and they got along well for exes lol. That was at the height of his Cosmo centerfold fame, and she hadn't done much of anything since the 60s (maybe a Love Boat lol).\n\nIf I hadn't seen it here, I wouldn't have known she died."
