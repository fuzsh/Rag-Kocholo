        "text": "Burt Reynolds, whose blend of Southern-fried machismo and wise-guy playfulness launched his worldwide celebrity in the 1970s, first as a freewheeling chat-show guest, then as a nude centerfold in Cosmopolitan magazine and finally as a Hollywood action star, has died at 82.\n\nHis agent, Todd Eisner, confirmed the death to the Associated Press. Additional details were not immediately available.\n\nTire-screeching fare such as Smokey and the Bandit (1977) and The Cannonball Run (1981) largely bookended Reynolds's reign as a top box-office draw and cemented his onscreen persona as a carefree man's man with an arm around a lady and his foot on the gas pedal.\n\nReynolds had ties to Florida his whole life, growing up in the state and attending Florida State University. He owned a theater in Jupiter and home in Hobe Sound that was later foreclosed on. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Florida State University.\n\nHe once was a minority owner of the Tampa Bay Bandits football team. He filmed Cop and a Half in Tampa, where he was a regular at Malio's and met a cocktail server who became his fiancee. Before a 2011 screening of Smokey and the Bandit at Tampa Theatre, he told the Tampa Bay Times that Tampa was \"my other hometown.\"\n\nOne of his final movies was shot in Bradenton in 2016. Titled Apple of My Eye, Reynolds portrayed the head trainer of Southeastern Guide Dogs whose miniature horse becomes a blind woman's companion. He loved horses so much, producers said, he shared his trailer with a miniature horse.\n\n\"He loved Florida State and hung one of their flags from his trailer,\" said the film's producer, Joe Restaino. \"He was a guy's guy who was down to earth and loved his fried chicken and potatoes who just happened to be a movie star.\"\n\nThe mustachioed actor had a reputation as a hard-drinking playboy whose charm alternated with a volcanic, hair-trigger temper. He made atrocious career decisions, propelled in part by a drug addiction and dramatic financial reversals. A low point was his excruciatingly public break-up and divorce from actress Loni Anderson in the early 1990s.\n\nCritical plaudits and peer recognition appeared wildly beyond his grasp when, in the twilight of his professional life, he summoned a precisely calibrated performance in Boogie Nights (1997) as a 1970s movie pornographer with delusions of artistry.\n\nDirected by Paul Thomas Anderson, Boogie Nights earned Reynolds an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. He lost to Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting but the attention seemed, if nothing else, a testament to Reynolds's resilience.\n\nPHOTOS: Burt Reynolds, an iconic actor with lifelong Florida ties\n\nIn a career spanning five decades and more than 100 movie and television roles, Reynolds said he mostly chose projects that seemed \"fun\" at the time.\n\nThe rebellious son of a Florida police chief, Reynolds ventured into acting in the late 1950s after injuries pushed him out of college football. Theater class, he wrote, was where he could find \"pretty girls.\"\n\nWith his pillowy lips, rugged build and uncooperative hairline, Reynolds resembled a young Marlon Brando but possessed little of that actor's depth and subtlety. Yet Reynolds' sexual charisma and willingness to perform his own stunts in action sequences helped ease his way into the ranks of Hollywood hopefuls.\n\nHe spent the next 15 years as a journeyman in TV and movie Westerns and cop shows, seemingly doomed to serve out an artistic sentence as a C-lister. He made news in the early 1970s when he temporarily gave up his hard-living lifestyle to begin a long-term relationship with the sweet-mannered singer and TV personality Dinah Shore, who was 20 years his senior.\n\nReynolds's rise to the front-rank of stardom was owed almost entirely to his unpredictable and disarming appearances on late-night television with hosts such as Merv Griffin and Johnny Carson. Reynolds dispensed with the expected niceties and platitudes about Hollywood and family, and he poked fun at his career, saying he was known for movies \"they show in airplanes or prisons or anywhere else the people can't get out.\"\n\nThen director John Boorman, who once said he was intrigued by the actor's blend of \"power, vulnerability and style,\" provided Reynolds with his breakthrough role in Deliverance (1972): an overconfident Atlanta businessman whose canoeing adventure with three friends in Appalachia turns into a gruesome tale of backwoods rape and murder.\n\nA Time magazine film reviewer described Reynolds as \"exceptional\" amid a first-rate cast that also included Jon Voight, Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty.\n\nDeliverance was a revelation of Reynolds' potential, but the film was released after his Cosmo centerfold appearance. Reynolds insisted the photo — he was stretched out on a bearskin rug with his arm discreetly placed between his legs — was done in the spirit of satire.\n\nMale pinups were almost unheard of in mainstream ladies' magazines, and Reynolds' image proved a sensation, quickly selling out all 1.5 million copies. He later said his hope of being taken seriously by audiences and critics was undermined by the centerfold and may have cost him an Oscar nomination for Deliverance.\n\nDuring the next several years, Reynolds appeared in more than a dozen hit movies, playing moonshiners (White Lightning), policemen (Hustle), gridiron veterans (The Longest Yard, Semi-Tough) and an aging stuntman (Hooper).\n\n\"I probably could do a film about the sewer system in Moscow and make it commercial,\" he joked at the time.\n\nWhen Reynolds attempted riskier roles, he often found himself alienating his most devoted fans and underwhelming reviewers. He tried to warble in Peter Bogdanovich's misguided Cole Porter tribute At Long Last Love (1975) and portrayed a terminally ill businessman in the dark comedy The End (1978) — \"the first picture,\" he once said, \"where I don't drive over 30 miles an hour and don't take my shirt off.\"\n\nHe also directed several movies, most notably the police drama Sharky's Machine (1981), but he said he returned to acting because he was making too much money to stop.\n\nThe most defining roles of his career — Smokey and the Bandit, The Cannonball Run, and their stitched-together sequels — drew in astounding profits on gossamer plots.\n\nSmokey and the Bandit, often described as a 90-minute car chase between Reynolds and an exasperated sheriff played by Jackie Gleason, cost about $4 million and grossed more than $100 million, making it the year's most profitable film after Star Wars.\n\nReynolds's career began to skid by the mid-1980s amid his bad professional decisions and personal woes. He declined the role of a retired astronaut that won Jack Nicholson an Academy Award for Terms of Endearment in order to make another car-chase story, Stroker Ace (1983), with his then-girlfriend Loni Anderson.\n\nHe plowed his fortune into business ventures, including a restaurant chain that folded and left him millions of dollars in debt. He bought a private helicopter and a jet and paid two pilots $100,000 each to be at his disposal at all times.\n\nHis on-set behavior reinforced his reputation as a mercurial bully. While making the action film Heat (1986), he punched director Dick Richards for a perceived slight. The altercation cost him $500,000 to settle and torpedoed what little good will he retained with Hollywood executives.\n\n\"If I hit a guy,\" Reynolds later joked to the New York Times, \"it's certain that he will run a studio or become a huge director.\"\n\nMeanwhile, stunt injuries and a debilitating jaw condition left Reynolds in pain that he self-medicated heavily for years with prescription drugs. Unable to eat because of jaw pain, he lost more than 60 pounds from his 200-pound frame, and rumors spread that he had AIDS.\n\nAs he donned increasingly elaborate hairpieces, his career bottomed out in films such as Rent-a-Cop (1987) and Striptease (1996), in which he played a debauched congressman.\n\nReynolds's cultural relevance spiked anew with Boogie Nights, which brought the star effusive reviews. New York Times film critic Janet Maslin wrote that Reynolds gave \"his best and most suavely funny performance in many years. Like Jerry Lewis in The King of Comedy, he gives the role an extra edge by playing a swaggering, self-important figure very close to the bone.\"\n\nReynolds told interviewer Piers Morgan that he was proud of his Boogie Nights performance but not the movie, which he said \"glamorized\" the porn industry. For that reason, he declined to help promote the film, alienating himself from the Hollywood establishment as it was ready to embrace him once again.\n\nBurton Leon Reynolds was born in Lansing, Michigan, on Feb. 11, 1936, and grew up in Riviera Beach, Florida and attended Palm Beach High School. He said his upbringing was defined by a remote and intimidating father he could never please.\n\nHe received a scholarship to FSU but later withdrew from its football program and joined a theater class. The instructor liked the spark of rage in him and urged his stage career.\n\nReynolds was a camp counselor at Camp Keystone on Gunn Highway in Tampa during college summers.\n\n\"We'd go to the Swiss House on Busch Boulevard,\" said Vernon Barchard, who knew him at the time. \"He'd done a TV show called Dan August but he wasn't famous yet. A fears later, we went there again and he was besieged.\"\n\nReynolds went to New York and, while holding down side jobs as a bouncer and dock worker, he literally crashed into television work when he was offered $150 to fall through a glass window for a TV series.\n\nReynolds, who said he was a quarter Cherokee, was often cast as Native Americans in television series such as Gunsmoke and Hawk and in films such as Navajo Joe (1966) and 100 Rifles (1969).\n\n\"The only Indian I haven't played is Pocahontas,\" Reynolds once quipped.\n\nIt was only after showing that looser side of himself on talk shows that important Hollywood directors began to notice Reynolds' potent mix of humor and sexual threat. Woody Allen hired him to play a sperm \"switchboard\" chief in Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask (1972).\n\nIn Alan J. Pakula's romantic comedy Starting Over (1979), Reynolds shaved his moustache and was cast against type as a sensitive man whose wife leaves him. He won admiring reviews but was overlooked for an Oscar while his co-stars Candice Bergen and Jill Clayburgh earned nominations.\n\nReynolds' skill as a light comedian also earned him an Emmy Award in 1991 for his starring role as a high school football coach on the CBS sitcom Evening Shade.\n\nAs his career waxed and waned, so did his often turbulent personal life. His first marriage, to British actress Judy Carne, ended in divorce in the mid-1960s. She later was the \"sock-it-to-me\" girl on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. Reynolds also was involved with actress Inger Stevens when died by suicide in 1970 and spent years dating his Smokey co-star Sally Field.\n\nReynolds became a tabloid staple during his divorce from Anderson, a star on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati whom he married in 1988. Celebrity magazines had once covered \"Burt and Loni\" as a Hollywood golden couple, with Reynolds portrayed as a lothario finally ready to settle down and Anderson as the blonde bombshell who tamed him.\n\nWhile filming in Tampa, Reynolds met Pam Seals, a cocktail server at Malio's, and became involved with her.\n\n\"Pam and I don't want to live in the shadows,\" he told the National Enquirer in 1993, saying his marriage to Anderson was \"an empty shell\" for two years.\n\nAs his marriage with Anderson disintegrated in the early 1990s, they traded accusations of flagrant infidelity and waged a bitter custody battle over their adopted son; they eventually shared custody. Reynolds went on national television to call his estranged wife an unfit mother; she accused him of physical abuse. They wrote dueling tell-all memoirs and were widely described as a textbook case of how not to divorce in Hollywood.\n\nSurvivors include a son from his second marriage, Quinton.\n\nReynolds acknowledged that his personal troubles ultimately derailed his career. But as a working actor whose finances remained unsteady — he declared bankruptcy at least once — he made efforts to revive the sly charm that once enticed millions of ticket-buyers.\n\n\"I go to the studios,\" he told the New York Times in 1996, \"and we start off and they're very nice and they tell me they grew up with me and then somewhere in the middle of the meeting they say, 'We have to address this — are you difficult?' And I say, 'If I met you between 1972 and 1976, I'm sorry.'\n\n\"At that moment, I hope for a laugh, but usually don't get one, and then I think, what am I saying? I made a lot of money and had a lot of fun and made a lot of movies you probably loved, but, 'I'm sorry'? I had a good time.\"\n\nReynolds always found time to give film career advice to filmmakers in Florida, Restaino said, even to college kids bringing coffee to the cast and crew. When he found out there were Smokey fans working on set, producers said, he drove the movie's Trans Am to set and let the crew take photos with it.\n\n\"I swear he didn't know he was famous,\" Restaino said. \"He was obsessed with Law and Order and would watch it in his trailer constantly. I asked, 'Burt, if you like this show so much why don't you get on?' And in a serious voice he asked, 'Do you think I can?'\"\n\nTimes Staff Writer Paul Guzzo contributed to this report, which contains information from Times files.\n\nRELATED:Westbound and down: Head to Arizona to buy Burt Reynolds' personal 1978 'Bandit' Trans-Am\n\nFROM 2016: Burt Reynolds talks ponies and movies at Southeastern Guide Dogs"
