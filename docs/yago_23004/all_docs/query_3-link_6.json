        "text": "Watch: I Am Burt Reynolds trailer\n\nThe CW is ready to air the documentary, I Am Burt Reynolds, directed by Adrian Buitenhuis, which offers a moving glimpse into the life of the legendary Burt Reynolds.\n\nIt traces his journey from football to his status as a heartthrob through his marriage with Loni Anderson and up to his final days.\n\nInsights from Loni, Jon Voight, Bruce Dern, Marilu Henner, and his close friends enrich the film, along with rare archival footage of Burt.\n\nThe documentary reveals nine key aspects of the Bandit star's life.\n\nNotably, it delves into Burt's marriages and the one great love he regretfully let slip away.\n\nRead more:\n\nFollow Daily Express US on Google News\n\nClick here to follow Daily Express US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest US, showbiz, and sports news.\n\nGrowing up in West Palm Beach, Florida, Burt was passionate about football during his high school years.\n\nHe initially aimed for the University of Miami but chose Florida State University instead, attracted by its higher female-to-male ratio.\n\nHis aspirations to play professional football for the Baltimore Colts ended abruptly due to a knee injury.\n\nPivoting to acting, Burt found himself with a contract at Universal in the early 1960s. His witty and charismatic nature made him a popular guest on late-night talk shows.\n\nHis major cinematic breakthrough came with the movie Deliverance.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nNCIS' Mark Harmon fresh-faced in throwback 80s movie role as he recalls filming [THROWBACK]\n\nBruce Willis' daughter posts emotional tribute after his devastating update [TRIBUTE]\n\nWhoopi Goldberg posts unrecognizable throwbacks ahead of 68th birthday today [UNRECOGNIZABLE]\n\nBurt first married Judy Carne in 1963, but their union lasted only two years. Post-divorce, he entered the dating scene, forming a notable relationship with his Smokey and the Bandit love interest Sally Field from 1976 to 1980.\n\nHis marriage to Loni Anderson in 1988 was marked by extravagance; Burt purchased a wedding ring in every gemstone to ensure it always matched Loni's outfits. The couple, who had been together since 1982 and shared an adopted son, Quinton, eventually faced a turbulent divorce in 1993.\n\nYears later, in 2015, Burt expressed regret about losing Sally, whom he considered the true love of his life.\n\nBurt's long-standing desire for an Oscar was unfulfilled for years, with his first major accolade being an Emmy for the TV show Evening Shade in the 1990s. His reluctance to star in Boogie Nights was evident, often leading to heated exchanges with director Paul Thomas Anderson.\n\nPaul's assurance that the role could win him an Academy Award finally convinced Burt to take it on. He earned an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Jack Horner, a porn producer, but Robin Williams ultimately won the award. Despite the recognition, Burt remained averse to the role.\n\nThe documentary, I Am Burt Reynolds is set to premiere on Saturday, December 30 at 8 pm on The CW, as part of the new I Am series."
