        "text": "Former \"Smokey and the Bandit\" star Burt Reynolds is dead, according to multiple reports. He was 82.\n\nHis manager tells The Hollywood Reporter that the actor died of a heart attack Thursday morning at a hospital in Jupiter, Florida. Additional details have not been disclosed.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Reynolds was transported to Jupiter Medical Center after going into cardiac arrest. His family was by his side when he died.\n\nPeople reports Reynolds had been battling a number of health issues over the past few years, including intensive care in 2013 for flu symptoms and a bypass operation in 2010.\n\nReynolds was best known for '70s and '80s movies like \"Smokey and the Bandit,\" \"Deliverance,\" \"The Longest Yard,\" \"Cannonball Run\" and \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\" He also starred in the '90s TV show \"Evening Shade\" and received an Oscar nomination for his role as a porn director in the 1997 film \"Boogie Nights.\"\n\nHis recent roles included \"The Last Movie Star\" and \"Miami Love Affair.\"\n\nHe was scheduled to appear in Quentin Tarantino's upcoming Charles Manson movie, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" It's unclear if he finished filming his role.\n\nThe actor was also known as a sex symbol, thanks to his iconic mustache, a nude centerfold photo for Cosmopolitan magazine, and his high-profile romances. He was married to Judy Carne from 1963 to 1965 and to Loni Anderson from 1988 to 1993; he also had relationships with Dinah Shore, Tammy Wynette and Sally Field.\n\nIn 2015, he reportedly called Field \"the love of my life.\"\n\n\"Even now, it's hard on me. I don't know why I was so stupid,\" he told Vanity Fair. \"Men are like that, you know. You find the perfect person, and then you do everything you can to screw it up.\"\n\nAccording to People, Reynolds grew up as a police chief's rebellious son in Riviera Beach, Florida. He played college football at Florida State, then moved to New York and California to pursue acting; his early roles included \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Hawk\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\"\n\nHe's survived by a son, Quinton, adopted during his marriage to Anderson."
