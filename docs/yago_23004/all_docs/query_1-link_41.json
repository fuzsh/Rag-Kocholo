        "text": "Burt Reynolds has died of cardiopulmonary arrest at the age of 82\n\nIn the 70s and 80s, Burt Reynolds personified the term \"sex symbol\"\n\nOver the span of five decades, he has amassed a long list of credits, but is forever cemented in the pop culture consciousness as 'Bandit' of the \"Smokey and the Bandit\" films.\n\nBurt Reynolds may not have won an Academy Award, but he got nominated for one – and for a number of years, every man wanted to be him – and every woman wanted to be WITH him. And sadly, we’ve all lost him as Reynolds passed away yesterday at a Florida hospital. He was 82. The cause of death? Cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\nBefore jumping to the silver screen, Reynolds was a fixture on several popular TV shows, including “Gunsmoke,” “Route 66,” “Perry Mason” and “The Twilight Zone.” But when the 70’s rolled around, Reynolds was thenumber one star in America for a quite some time. And that was credited to his role in the movie, “Deliverance.”\n\nWhile he starred in a number of hit films over his five decade career – including “The Longest Yard,” the “Cannonball Run” series, “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,” “Stroker Ace,” “City Heat,” and “Striptease” – he will forever be known Bo ‘Bandit’ Darville – from 1977’s “Smokey and the Bandit” and its sequels. But it was his role in 1997’s “Boogie Nights” that garnered him a Golden Globe awards as well as an Oscar nomination.\n\nBeyond his screen work – Reynolds was the consummate sex symbol. That was due in large part to his nude “Cosmopolitan” centerfold in 1972. And while his developed a reputation as quite a ladies’ man – there were at least three women who truly touched his heart. British actress Judy Carne (to whom he was married from 1963 to 66), “Bandit” co-star Sally Field (they were together from 1977 to 1982) and actress Loni Anderson (they were married from 1988 to 1993).\n\nReynolds and Anderson also had a child together,Quinton Anderson, whom Reynolds has referred to as “my greatest achievement.” While Quinton has led an extraordinarily private life, and hasn’t spoken out, momLoni \"Quinton and I are extremely touched by the tremendous outpouring of love and support from friends and family throughout the world,\"she said in a statement to Fox News. \"Burt was a wonderful director and actor. He was a big part of my life for twelve years and Quinton's father for thirty years. We will miss him and his great laugh.”\n\nSimilarly, Field whose relationship with Reynolds is immortalized in the “Smokey and the Bandit” films, has also offered her thoughts. “There are times in your life that are so indelible, they never fade away,” Fieldsaid in a statement to “People.” “They stay alive, even forty years later. My years with Burt never leave my mind. He will be in my history and my heart, for as long as I live. Rest, Buddy.”\n\nFor more celebrity reactions, CLICK HERE."
