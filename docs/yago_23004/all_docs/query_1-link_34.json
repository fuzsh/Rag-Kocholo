        "text": "[quote]Wasn't Judy Carne married to Burt?\n\nYes, Judy was married to Burt Reynolds. Judy's real name was Joyce Botterill.\n\n\"Carne was married to actor Burt Reynolds from 1963 to 1965 and to producer Robert Bergmann from 3 May 1970 to 1971; both marriages were brief and childless, and ended in divorce.\n\nIn 1978, after being found not guilty of possessing heroin, she was involved in a car accident along with her second husband; she recovered from a broken neck. Her drug problem continued and she was later arrested again for heroin possession. In 1986, she was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport and convicted of drug possession, serving two of a three-months prison sentence in HM Prison Cookham Wood.\"\n\n\"Her autobiography, Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl (1985), detailed her bisexuality, marriage to Burt Reynolds (who unsuccessfully tried to prevent publication), and her experiences with drugs. Carne moved back to Northamptonshire, England, in the 1980s, living quietly in the village of Pitsford. She died from pneumonia on 3 September 2015 at a hospital in Northampton.\"\n\nJudy also co-starred with Pete Duel in Love on a Rooftop (1966).\n\n\"In the early hours of December 31, 1971, Duel died at his Hollywood Hills home of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Duel's girlfriend, Dianne Ray, was at his home at the time of his death and discovered his body. Ray later told police the two had watched Duel's series Alias Smith and Jones the previous evening. She later went to sleep in another room while Duel stayed up. Sometime after midnight, Duel entered the bedroom, retrieved his revolver and told Ray \"I'll see you later.\" Ray then said she heard a gunshot from another room and discovered Duel's body.\"\n\n\"According to police, Duel's friends and family said he was depressed about his drinking problem. He had been arrested and pleaded guilty to a driving under the influence accident that injured two people the previous June. Duel's death was later ruled a suicide.\" Pete was 31.\n\nWho said being a celebrity is always glamorous?\n\nPromo photo from \"Love On a Rooftop\".\n\nSpeaking of getting jokes, I'm not American and had no clue what a Walnetto was. Nor a Spiro Agnew, for that matter. (I was a kid, remember.)\n\nHowever the war jokes were universal, and the standard of comedy was not such that you needed to be a genius. It was very psychedelic, not only in its use of colour and lighting, but the intense speed of it - at least for the time - and its quick pivots-without-segue from one thing to another. It was a stark contrast to the too-cool-for-school sketch comedy coming out of the UK (The Frost Report, Not Only But Also, etc.)"
