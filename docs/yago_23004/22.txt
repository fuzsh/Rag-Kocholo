When Burt Reynolds died at age 82, everyone remembered him as a movie star who “set out to have as much fun as possible on and off the screen — and wildly succeeded,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. He was married twice, and he dated a series of women — many of whom are well-known in Hollywood.

Read on to discover all — or at least many — of the most notable women who dated Burt Reynolds.

People reports that in 1960, Burt Reynolds was briefly engaged to scream queen Lori Nelson, who was known for 1955’s Revenge of the Creature. But it’s no wonder that the two never went through with the marriage: It doesn’t sound like he was particularly enthusiastic about the prospect of making that commitment.

Three years later — three months before he tied the knot with Judy Carne, Reynolds reportedly said of the prospect of marriage, “I’m fighting it all the way.”
