        "text": "by James Scott Bell\n\n@jamesscottbell\n\nFollowing up on my post on scene descriptions, I turn today to describing characters. The basic principle is the same: we want to create a feeling over and above a mere picture. And the way we do that is to filter impressions through the point-of-view character.\n\nI’d like to break this subject down into two parts. First, how to describe the main character, the protagonist. Second, how to render the other characters through the eyes of the protagonist.\n\nMain Character Description\n\nThere are two schools of thought when it comes to describing a main character.\n\nThe first is to give little or no visual info about the character. This allows the readers form their own picture. There’s a vividness that springs directly from the reader’s imagination.\n\nThis approach––minimalism––seems to be the preferred style these days. The exception may be category romance, which usually puts the main characters right on the cover.\n\nIf you want to offer a fuller character description, your challenge is two-fold. How much detail, and how to deliver it? In the past it was common to give full information via an omniscient POV, as in the beginning of Gone With The Wind:\n\nScarlett O’Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw. Here eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin––that skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns.\n\nThese days, however, the more intimate Third and First Person POVs are favored. So how do you describe a main character without her sounding vain? I brushed aside a wisp of my auburn hair and focused my startling green eyes on him.\n\nHere are a couple of ways:\n\nHave another character provide the description\n\nIn my first Mike Romeo thriller, Romeo’s Way, I wanted readers to know Mike was in great shape and looked like a fighter. So the first scene finds him jogging and stopping to talk to a middle-aged woman trimming flowers (just before a church blows up):\n\nShe put out her hand. “Nell,” she said.\n\n“Mike,” I said.\n\n“Happy to meet you, Mike. Except …”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“You don’t look like a flower man.”\n\n“What do I look like?”\n\n“Football player, maybe?”\n\nI shook my head.\n\n“Then what exactly do you do with all those muscles?”\n\n“Are you flirting with me, Nell?”\n\nShe pushed her hat back slightly. “If I was thirty years younger, I’d rip your T-shirt right off.”\n\nThe mirror trick\n\nIt is frowned upon by keepers of the craft to have a character pause in front of a mirror (or window or bright, shiny toaster) and report what she sees. I looked in the mirror and saw my red hair hanging there like a bunch of kelp. My jade eyes, which men normally went wowsers over, seemed dull and lifeless. Was I really that depressed?\n\nYou know what? I don’t think readers care about it as much as writing teachers and critique-group nannies do. So if you really want to put in such a moment, I’m not going to throw a pencil at you.\n\nThere’s an alternative: imagine what another character would see when looking at the protagonist.\n\nI could just imagine old J.D.’s reaction. “What’s with those baby blues of yours, Hal? They look scared. And why don’t you just give in and cut your hair? You want to be a Viking or a lawyer?”\n\nNo matter what style of description you choose, be sure to put it somewhere up front, because it only takes a few scenes for your readers to lock in a picture. If you give them some startling descriptive element in the middle of the book, it will be jarring.\n\nDescribing Other Characters\n\nNow let’s turn to when the POV character in a scene describes another character. As with setting, I have a checklist:\n\nHow do you want the reader to feel about this character?\n\nThis is a strategic decision. What’s the tone and purpose of your scene? How will this new character figure into that?\n\nUsing the sense of sight, make a list of what the POV character notices about physical appearance\n\nJot down five to ten items. As you go along, push beyond the familiar. See if you can find one “telling detail.” That’s one image that seems to sum up the entire character. David Copperfield’s first sight of the unctuous Uriah Heep begins:\n\nThe low arched door then opened, and the face came out. It was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window, though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people. It belonged to a red-haired person—a youth of fifteen, as I take it now, but looking much older—whose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble; who had hardly any eyebrows, and no eyelashes, and eyes of a red-brown, so unsheltered and unshaded, that I remember wondering how he went to sleep. He was high-shouldered and bony; dressed in decent black, with a white wisp of a neckcloth; buttoned up to the throat; and had a long, lank, skeleton hand, which particularly attracted my attention…\n\nWhat got me was “no eyelashes.” That’s surprising and vivid. And it goes with Heep’s character, for his is always secretly observing. He is not to be trusted. He’s creepy. Dickens captured all that.\n\nConsider the other senses\n\nSmell, hearing (the voice), touch (a handshake) … think about these as well. I’d leave taste out of it (eww).\n\nWhat personal impression does the character make?\n\nHere is where you can use the POV character’s personal interpretation, like we did with scenes. He wouldn’t stop talking. He was a New York traffic jam full of angry cabbies.\n\nWrite the description, let it rest, then edit\n\nGive it your best shot, then take a little break. Grab some coffee. Watch the news.\n\nOn second thought, don’t watch the news.\n\nThen come back and tweak the description as you see fit.\n\nThe grand master of character description was Raymond Chandler. He wrote his Philip Marlowe detective stories in First Person POV. Here’s Marlowe’s description of Moose Malloy in Farewell, My Lovely:\n\nHe was a big man but not more than six feet five inches tall and not wider than a beer truck.\n\nHere is the snarky voice of Marlowe, and the perfect image—beer truck. Chandler could have chosen anything. …not wider than a schoolhouse…not wider than a cow pasture. But those images would not be how Marlowe thinks nor how Chandler wants to set the scene. A beer truck is urban. It is for people who drink in bars. That’s the feel of the whole chapter, which takes place inside a saloon.\n\nA few paragraphs later, Moose Malloy returns:\n\nA hand I could have sat in came out of the dimness and took hold of my shoulder and squashed it to a pulp. Then the hand moved me through the doors and casually lifted me up a step.\n\nNot a big hand. But a hand I could have sat in. Then what that hand does to his shoulder, and not just lifting, but casually lifting Marlowe. Two lines, and we know this character is huge and dangerous and in control.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nYou can characterize by comparing the person to something\n\nRobert B. Parker does this in The Godwulf Manuscript:\n\nHe looked like a zinnia. Tall and thin with an enormous corona of rust red hair flaring out around his pale, clean-shaven face.\n\nI like what a middle-schooler once wrote as part of a metaphor exercise in English class:\n\nJohn and Mary had never met. They were like two hummingbirds who had also never met.\n\nNeeds some editing, but perhaps with a little coaching this kid will be a writer someday.\n\nMinor characters should have at least one unique, visual tag\n\nMinor characters are an opportunity to add spice to your book. Don’t waste their descriptions by making them plain vanilla. Give them at least one unique visual tag.\n\nInstead of the doorman let me in try a doorman too fat for his faded green coat let me in.\n\nYou can characterize by what another character is not\n\nIn my current WIP, a Mike Romeo thriller, he is describing the banal bathing-suited men and women at a Hollywood pool party. They are all pose and giggles. Mike observes:\n\nA meeting of the American Philosophical Society this was not.\n\nYou don’t have to describe everything at once\n\nIt’s often a good idea to drop in descriptive details along with the action. Think of it as you would in real life. You see someone at a distance. You form an impression. As you get closer, you notice other things. It’s sort of like a camera starting with a long shot then moving in for a close-up.\n\nLet me end this post with my favorite descriptive example of all time. It comes out of the popular Bulwer-Lytton bad opening line contest from several years ago.\n\nWith a curvaceous figure that Venus would have envied, a tanned, unblemished oval face framed with lustrous thick brown hair, deep azure-blue eyes fringed with long black lashes, perfect teeth that vied for competition, and a small straight nose, Marilee had a beauty that defied description.\n\nAny thoughts you’d like to add on the subject of character description?\n\n***"
