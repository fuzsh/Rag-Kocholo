        "text": "Philip Marlowe is the most famous creation of British-American hardboiled author Raymond Chandler – and he’s had quite the history in the movies…\n\nAs you might expect of a man who created literature’s most world-weary private investigator, Raymond Chandler had lived a full life before he sat down to write about Philip Marlowe for the first time.\n\nBorn in the US, he spent most of his youth receiving a top-flight education in England, and then working as a journalist for the Daily Express. He fought in World War I, learned book-keeping, and fell in love with a married woman two decades older.\n\nFor a while, he was a highly paid oil executive, but a litany of bad behaviour soon ended that employment. Floundering in middle age, and inspired by his affection for Black Mask magazine – which often published stories from Dashiell Hammett, the author behind detectives like Sam Spade and Nick and Norah Charles – Chandler decided to try his hand at writing pulp fiction.\n\nThat turned out to be the wisest decision of his life.\n\nThough his plots could be meandering and convoluted, Chandler’s prose was peerless; as he once said, “very likely Agatha Christie and Rex Stout write better mysteries, but their words don’t get up and walk. Mine do.” His dialogue was the smartest and wittiest around; with a few well-chosen words, he could create a scene so terrifically evocative, you could smell the cheap aftershave and cigarette smoke.\n\nChandler’s writing was cinematic enough that Hollywood soon came-a-calling. In addition to adaptations of his own novels, he had a hand in crafting some of the finest noirs of the 1940s and 50s, lending his deft ear for dialogue to films like Double Indemnity (1944), The Blue Dahlia (1946), and Strangers On A Train (1951). It’s difficult to think of another writer who made more of a contribution to the whole feel of film noir, that genre of wise-cracking sleuths and tough-talking dames.\n\nArray\n\nOf course, his most famous contribution was Philip Marlowe. Chandler wrote seven novels starring the legendary private detective, all but one of which was adapted into a feature film. Marlowe has been round the block a few times too many, and is a hard man to surprise. No-one knows the insalubrious spots of Los Angeles like he does.\n\nHe has few friends left amongst the cops that used to be his colleagues – in fact, they often treat him as a suspect. Beneath a thick crust of cynicism and biting way with words lies a burnished romantic heart. Yet Marlowe is, essentially, a lone wolf. He’s seen too much to be anything else.\n\nMarlowe’s First Cinematic Steps\n\nThe first Raymond Chandler film adaptations – The Falcon Takes Over and Time To Kill, both released in 1942 – didn’t actually feature Marlowe at all, instead fitting characters from pre-existing franchises (The Falcon and Mike Shayne) into the leading role.\n\nIt was Murder, My Sweet (1944) that introduced cinema audiences to Philip Marlowe, and they were in for a shock. Dick Powell had spent most of the previous decade in light studio musical comedies like 42nd Street (1933) and Broadway Gondolier (1935); no one expected him to play a hard-bitten, cynical detective. Certainly, no one was expecting him to be so good at it. And yet Powell’s charismatically brittle take on Marlowe was convincing enough to not only make Murder, My Sweet one of the very best Chandler adaptations, but to set himself off on a change of career direction that would make him one of the top stars of film noir.\n\nAlthough when it came to film noir stars, no-one could beat Humphrey Bogart, and his turn at Marlowe in 1946’s The Big Sleep is still regarded by many as being the cream of the crop. Bogart was the only actor to play pulp fiction’s two biggest detectives – he was Sam Spade in 1941’s The Maltese Falcon, widely considered to mark the start of the noir era – and his comfort in the role makes it all feel so natural.\n\nThe Big Sleep’s narrative may be typically impossible to follow (per a notorious anecdote, the screenwriters adapting Chandler’s novel couldn’t work out who the murderer was, and when they asked the author, even he didn’t know!), but the film drips with hypnotically sultry style, especially in the many scenes shared by Bogart and Lauren Bacall, who would marry shortly after shooting wrapped.\n\nThe 1940s produced two more movie Marlowes. Lady In The Lake (1946) was the worst of them all, with Robert Montgomery making an unappealingly terse lead, and a central gimmick – the whole film is shot from Marlowe’s point of view, so the supporting actors talk directly to the camera as if they are speaking to him – that distracts from the action rather than adds to it.\n\nThe Brasher Doubloon (1947) has a more charming Marlowe in George Montgomery (no relation to Robert), but both he and the movie around him were too lightweight to linger long in the cultural imagination.\n\nThe 70s Resurgence\n\nAfter The Brasher Doubloon, filmmakers seemed to lose interest in Philip Marlowe. Perhaps it was a case of oversaturation (after all, there’d been four different takes on the character in three years), perhaps it was just a case of changing fashions – either way, it took 22 years for him to make it back to the big screen. His first appearance after that long absence had little to recommend it. Though James Garner is amiable enough in the leading role, 1969’s Marlowe is flat and televisual, only enlivened by sporadic appearances from a dazzling Rita Moreno.\n\nFour years later, The Long Goodbye, proved that Marlowe was worth bringing back to life. Elliott Gould’s Philip Marlowe is still wry and smart and used to taking a beating, but director Robert Altman places him in modern day Los Angeles (Marlowe did this too, to much lesser effect), and spends time getting to know him before people start sticking guns in his face.\n\nNo actor … sounded quite as natural speaking Chandler’s words [as] Humphrey Bogart.\n\nChandler’s narrative looseness is a good fit with Altman; the famous first scene, where we accompany Marlowe on a trip to the grocery store as he gets cat food for his very fussy feline, sets the tone for the characterful, laidback feature that follows. There’s still plenty of violence – a brutal scene with a coke bottle to the face is difficult to watch – but if anything, the low-key tenor of the movie as a whole makes the punches land harder.\n\nTo date, both the last and the oldest actor to star as Marlowe in a big screen adaptation was Robert Mitchum. Farewell, My Lovely (1975) gains tremendous poignancy from his weathered face and his long history in Hollywood. No actor had sounded quite as natural speaking Chandler’s words since Humphrey Bogart. Though the movie feels elegiac, like a loving goodbye to both an icon and the world he made famous, in 1978, Mitchum became the first actor to play the character in a second film.\n\nThis second version of The Big Sleep was rightly and roundly criticised for many reasons, foremost amongst them director Michael Winner’s unfortunate decision to move the action from Los Angeles to present-day London, and an array of sub-par performances from a cast that also included James Stewart, Sarah Miles, and Oliver Reed.\n\nThat negative reception bought an end to the Chandler renaissance.\n\nMarlowe Lives On\n\nAlthough it’s been more than 40 years since Marlowe’s last cinematic sojourn, during those decades he’s made appearances in radio dramas, TV movies, theatre productions, and – somewhat bizarrely – a video game. In 2022, finally, he’ll return to the big screen in another film called Marlowe – this one directed by Neil Jordan, and starring Liam Neeson. Neeson will take Mitchum’s crown as the oldest actor to play the role by almost a full decade, but having that extra age and experience has never been a hindrance when it comes to Philip Marlowe."
