        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, Jules Furthman\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chander\n\nDirector: Howard Hawks\n\nCinematographer: Sidney Hickox\n\nMusic: Max Steiner\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Martha Vickers\n\nRelease: August 23, 1946\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nPercent Noir: 70%\n\nAnd here is where I fear my “Film Noir Fanboy” badge will be torn off of me – I do not like “The Big Sleep.”\n\nLook, I want to love it. I’ve watched numerous times, wanting to be captured by the spell it casts on many others.\n\nAnd yet, every time I do, I am left wanting.\n\nCertainly the film is stocked with the kind of talent that makes it impossible to dismiss. You’ve got Bogie & Bacall fronting it and Howard Hawks directing it. It’s from the classic novel by Raymond Chandler, and the trio of screenwriters lift much of the dialogue directly from the novel. And who are those screenwriters? Well, William Faulkner for one. The other two are Leigh Brackett, who wrote little movies like “The Long Goodbye” and “The Empire Strikes Back,” and Jules Furthman, who penned “Nightmare Alley” and “Shanghai Express.” I mean… holy fuck!\n\nBogart stars as iconic dick Philip Marlowe, who is hired by a rich man named Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to investigate a blackmailer. Marlowe becomes entangled with Sternwood’s two daughters – first up is Carmen (Martha Vickers), who is quite friendly with gentlemen and has had pornographic photos taken of herself, and then there’s Vivian (Bacall), who may be there to help Marlowe but also has an agenda all her own. I’m keeping things vague here because the plot is confusing, labyrinth-like and it’s often difficult (even after repeated viewings) to understand just what is at stake in any individual scene.\n\n“The Big Sleep” seems to be the exception to everything that critics and historians normally complain about. Warner Bros. caved in to an agent’s pressure for reshoots to emphasize Bacall at the expense of Vickers’ performance. Said reshoots convoluted the already nonsensical plot to the point where things stop making sense by the midpoint. And yet nearly every major modern critic simply swats those pesky facts away, instead focusing on the dialogue and Bogie & Bacall’s chemistry.\n\nAnd, make no mistake, the dialogue here is cracking. “She tried to sit on my lap while I was standing up,” which is straight from Chandler’s book, is a perfect line, and there are dozens of such lines all over the film. And Bogart and Bacall do very, very good work in their scenes together. It’s just everything else that doesn’t work for me.\n\nChandler famously demeaned Agatha Christie once, writing that her Rube Goldberg-ian plots prevented the books from being able to dig into the real meat of stories – the characterization. Which is a fair criticism (though one that has never prevented me from loving her work), unless you look at a book like “The Big Sleep,” which has all of the unnecessary plot mechanics of a normal Christie novel, but a third act that does not properly pay off everything set up in the first two acts. Instead of everyone acting like a suspect, everyone is acting like a dick here, which is just as two-dimensional. And say what you will about Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, but their quirks defined them, whereas Marlowe in the film version of “The Big Sleep” is nothing but a placeholder for Chandler, lacking any depth or character traits aside from “jaded.” Okay, there is one other – every woman in the film is so turned on by Marlowe that they’ll immediately begin hitting on him, no matter what else they were doing before. This makes Marlowe seem more like Bond than Bogart, who was famous not just because he was a good actor, but because he wasn’t conventionally handsome. It’s a weird way to portray the character and doesn’t support Bogart’s persona.\n\nAnd then there’s the whole plot aspect of the film, which I’ve already touched on several times. Roger Ebert famously wrote that the film “is about the process of investigation, not the results,” which sounds great but makes little sense when you think about it. If “The Big Sleep” were really about that, then there would not contain a real payoff… things would remain unclear at the end and we would be purposely left with a sense of incompleteness. This has worked before – look at “Hollywoodland.” But “The Big Sleep’s” third act purports to solve everything – it pretends as if the case is solved satisfactorily and hopes you weren’t paying close attention. And as detailed and meticulous as the first act is in setting up characters who seem super important and clue threads that Marlowe spends minutes of the film investigating, the rest of the movie seems to care little about them. Vivian all but takes over the movie, with Carmen first an afterthought before becoming completely irrelevant, which is a shame because her plot thread was more engaging.\n\nHawks is one of the best directors in film history, and his “Bringing Up Baby” is my favorite comedy. Here he works well with the actors and applies a straightforward visual approach with his cinematographer Sidney Hickox (“To Have and Have Not” “Dark Passage”). Iconic composer Max Steiner does well with the score, save for a few moments where he presses the emotion too hard when the performances are more than adequate.\n\nIn case you can’t tell, approaching “The Big Sleep” was exhausting for me. Individual scenes are wonderful, but others (like when Vivian gets her token song-and-dance-for-no-reason moment) are super cringe-worthy. I very much enjoy other Chandler novels, and many of their adaptations (several of which I’ve already covered on this site). In fact, that sentiment serves just about every member of the creative team… I love them elsewhere. Every time I try to love “The Big Sleep,” and try to do what audiences and critics have done for decades by waving away the faults. I want to surrender to it… but I can’t. It’s so star-studded in front of and behind the camera that I understand why it is considered first-tier noir, but that does not make it a good movie.\n\nScore: **1/2\n\nThe Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: John Paxton\n\nBased on the novel “Farewell, My Lovely” by Raymond Chandler\n\nDirector: Edward Dmytryk\n\nCinematographer: Harry J. Wild\n\nMusic: Roy Webb\n\nCast: Dick Powell, Claire Trevor, Anne Shirley, Otto Kruger, Mike Mazurki, Miles Mander\n\nRelease: December 9, 1944\n\nStudio: RKO Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 90%\n\nFor a film noir, “Murder, My Sweet” has an obscenely stacked deck. One look at the roster of creators behind the project should have you salivating. Chandler! Powell! Paxton! Dmytryk! Trevor! Kruger! Wild! Be still my heart! Put all these talents together and it seems inevitable that you’re gonna get something great. And, unsurprisingly, the movie is just that.\n\nThis is the first of many Phillip Marlowe adaptations, and appears to arrive fully formed, with all the usual trimmings. Raymond Chandler wrote the novel that John Paxton adapted, so you know you’re in for weird, serpentine plotting that barely makes sense if you try to keep track of everything. Plot was never the point of Chandler’s work anyway – it was relishing the opportunity to see Marlowe yelling at a myriad of people, and in that regard the movie delivers in spades.\n\nThe movie has about five beginnings. We fade into a blind Marlowe (Dick Powell) possibly under arrest, then flashes back a few days. A huge moose of a man aptly named Moose (Mike Mazurki), who at the very least has some brain damage, hires Marlowe to find his beloved Velma, who he hasn’t seen in eight years. Then suddenly we’re concerned with a guy named Marriott (Douglas Walton) who hires Marlowe to escort him to the woods where he is to pay to get a jade necklace back. Marriott ends up shot dead (Marlowe: “[It was like] an elephant had stepped on his head.”) and Marlowe is a suspect. But we need some dames in this story, so we get a blonde one named Helen (Claire Trevor) who owned the jade and her daughter-in-law Ann (Anne Shirley). Both try to hire Marlowe, and seduce him, and scream at him, and disappear on him in the middle of very important conversations. Confused yet? Eh, just go with it – that’s part of the fun.\n\nIt’s a credit to screenwriter Paxton that it’s as coherent as it is. I’ve read the book, and trust me, he had quite the beast to tame. Paxton was a great screenwriter (“The Wild One,” “Kotch”), and his life inspired one of the best noir graphic novels ever – Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips’ “The Fade Out.” Paxton keeps all the book’s essentials and copies and pastes the best Chandler dialogue (“She was a charming middle-aged lady with a face like a bucket of mud. I gave her a drink. She was a gal who’d take a drink, even if she had to knock you down to get the bottle.”) then adds in a few of his own flourishes. He essentially breaks the fourth wall a few times, winking at the audience about how little it all makes sense by having Marlowe complain about how everyone is paying him money to take the case and suddenly paying him money to drop the case. Then, when Marlowe is yelling at random suspects, they will often interrupt and point out plot holes. Marlowe shrugs it off, admitting he sometimes just says stuff to say stuff. You can’t help but smile.\n\nKnowing he’s got a murky story to work with, director Edward Dmytryk throws in more noir shadows than you can shake a stick at. The first sequence, where Marlowe is blind, has cigarette smoke and face shadows and body shadows and weird expressionist shadows… that room is bleeding mood. Working with his cinematographer, the great Harry J. Wild (“Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” “His Kind of Woman”), Dmytryk manages to find atmosphere and shadows in every scene, even bright office scenes that take place in the middle of the day. And the expressionistic stuff he does when Marlowe is drugged and sedated for three days? Holeee shit. I usually have no patience for the usually crappy camera tricks from that time period, but Dmytryk plays it smart with the cobweb over the camera and the sequence involving doors. Heck, even the fade to black used when Marlowe is clunked over the head has style, using animation to close the frame in an awesome way, almost like the iris shots from the silent era.\n\nDmytryk directed several well-regarded films noir, including “The Sniper” and “Crossfire.” He almost lost his career thanks to the Communist blacklist, but came back and made films like “Raintree County” (Montgomery Clift was in his car accident halfway through shooting and Dmytryk had to figure out a way to make his pre-and-post surgery footage all work together), the remake of “The Blue Angel” and “The Caine Mutiny.” I have opined previously that his films usually do not age well, but am ecstatic that this is the exception.\n\nHe also cast the movie well. This film was a big deal for Powell, who was aging out of romantic roles and wanted something grittier. Well, he got it. His interpretation of Marlowe is aces through and through, never winking at the audience and playing the scenes straight and with an inherent exhaustion that works wonders. There’s also a great moment where he can’t help but dance in the great hall of a mansion that never fails to make me laugh out loud – I wonder if it was improvised…\n\nTrevor acquits herself very well to the femme fatale role here, knowing when to play it straight and when to ham it up juuuust enough. I love the shot of her lying in the dark in her beach house, lit cigarette breaking the blackness of the room. Shirley (who retired after this film) has the trickier role, being both a possible fatale but also retaining enough innocence to work as a straight romantic lead for Marlowe, and she does very well. Her chemistry with Powell is palpable, and it’s a shame she quit after this film. Supporting players like Kruger and Mazurki are solid as always.\n\nAfter the beach house is introduced, things begin to sag a little bit. There’s still a bunch of crackerjack dialogue to be had, but the film is weighed down by the necessity to explain all the randomness we’ve just seen, and watching people talk and talk and talk is less interesting for me than the mystery itself, especially when the payoff is…well…fine and not outstanding. The film fails to pay off the Moose character in the explosive way one would hope, and Marlowe is blinded in a “meh” fashion. It’s not bad, and had the first two-thirds of the movie not been incredible, the lesser stuff wouldn’t stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nBut alas, it does, and that holds back “Murder, My Sweet” from being a masterpiece. Still, it remains one of my favorite Chandler works ever, and Powell is so appealing as Marlowe and can spit out the dialogue like nobody’s business. I really wish he’d gotten to play this role again on the big screen.\n\nScore: ****"
