        "text": "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nAISHA HARRIS, HOST:\n\nYour calendar might say it's November, but among movie buffs this month is also known as Noirvember. It's a time to settle into the cooler temps and shorter days by enjoying an old movie that features a washed-up detective, a sultry femme fatale or hardened criminals - a time to immerse yourself in witty banter and moody lighting as the melodrama unfolds. And whether you're familiar with the genre or just looking for great places to start, we're here to help. I'm Aisha Harris. And today, we're recommending some great noir films on POP CULTURE HAPPY HOUR from NPR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nHARRIS: Joining me today is writer Marya Gates. Welcome, Marya.\n\nMARYA GATES: Hi. It's so great to be here.\n\nHARRIS: It is awesome to have you here because I know how much you love noir. And I also know that you are more or less the creator of Noirvember.\n\nGATES: Yes. That is true.\n\nHARRIS: I learned about film noir in film school. But since you're the expert, what is your definition of film noir? Obviously, it's a very wide genre. But, like, if you had to explain it to someone, how would you describe film noir?\n\nGATES: Yeah. It's hotly debated whether it's a genre or an era. I'm kind of the it's both...\n\nHARRIS: Yes. Yeah.\n\nGATES: ...Camp, whereas there is a classical era, which is mostly the '40s and '50s. And then everything else is sort of neo-noir. But the best definition I've ever seen is from Eddie Muller, who is the czar of noir. He hosts Noir Alley on TCM. He is the founder of the Film Noir Foundation. And he calls noir suffering with style...\n\nHARRIS: (Laughter) Yeah.\n\nGATES: ...Which I think is fabulous. But essentially, it's films where everything goes wrong, where everyone makes all the wrong decisions. You root for these losers even though you know they're all going to probably die or end up in prison. But you're like, oh, man. I really hope they make it. And most of the time they - spoiler - do not make it. Actually, the French coined the term - after World War II, a whole bunch of American films finally made it into France in the late '40s. And this writer named, you know, Frank coined the term film noir to describe the films \"The Maltese Falcon,\" \"Laura,\" \"Murder, My Sweet,\" \"Double Indemnity\" and \"The Woman In The Window,\" all films from 1944-ish - \"Maltese Falcon,\" obviously, a little bit earlier, in 1841.\n\nAnd they all had this very similar sort of melodramatic, dark way of looking at the world of cynical, and crime doesn't pay. \"Maltese Falcon\" has a detective that, like, manages to make everything good at the end. But it's definitely still very, very dark. And a lot of these early ones were adaptations of crime writers from the '30s. It's kind of how you got it coming out in the '40s. But 1944 is, like, the year noir really took off. And most of those directors didn't even know they were making noir. Like, they didn't think that way. Like, Wilder, people would ask him, like, did you know you were making noir? And he's like, I just made movies I wanted to see, which tells you a lot about Billy Wilder.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, film noir has been one of my absolute favorite genres. And last year is actually the first year I kind of participated in Noirvember. I wasn't able to watch every day. But I did - I feel like I watched, you know, a good 10 to 12 noirs. And a lot of them were new to me. And so can you tell everyone a little bit about how that came about?\n\nGATES: So like many a millennial during the recession, I dropped out of grad school and moved in the back of my parent's house for a couple of years.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGATES: But my parents live in the middle of nowhere. And there was literally nothing to do. So I spent the bulk of 2010 just watching movies. I think I watched, like, 700 movies. And then the next year, I watched, like, a thousand movies. It was a time.\n\nHARRIS: Wow (laughter).\n\nGATES: So I was catching up on a lot of blind spots. And one of the big blind spots I had was noir. And so in November, I was like, oh, what if I called it Noirvember?\n\nHARRIS: (Laughter).\n\nGATES: And that first year - this was 2010. I was using the IMDb, you know, top noir list.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nGATES: But it was a pretty good list. And there were 50 films on it. And I think I had seen six. So it was like, I got some work to do. So I wanted the Internet to do it with me. I had a whole flyer. It has Ava Gardner on it. We got 50 films. We have 30 days. Let's do it. Now it's just sort of all over the place.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nGATES: And it's always exciting to see a new venue or a new country celebrate it.\n\nHARRIS: I love it. Well, we've already mentioned your first pick. And I'm really glad you picked this one. So tell us what it is.\n\nGATES: It's \"Laura\" from Otto Preminger - stars Gene Tierney. It's an adaptation of one of my favorite books by Vera Caspary. It's beautiful, stark film. Gene Tierney is probably the most beautiful she's ever been in this movie. The black and white just, like, loves her face. So it's about a woman who has died. And a detective, played by Dana Andrews, is investigating. And there's all these well-to-do New York socialites who may or may not have killed her. They all know her. There's this luminous portrait. The detective falls in love with the portrait. Things aren't exactly as they seem. I don't want to spoil the film because it definitely is one of those that you can easily spoil.\n\nHARRIS: So many twists and turns in that movie.\n\nGATES: There's a lot of twists and turns. It actually inspired - if you're a fan of \"Twin Peaks,\" it is actually a big inspiration. Obviously, \"Laura\" - a portrait, there's a diary. The detective is - a lot of the mannerisms of Kyle MacLachlan in \"Twin Peaks\" he borrows from that.\n\nHARRIS: Oh, wow. I never put those two together.\n\nGATES: There's a ton of references. So it's a great one to watch. So I brought a clip I'd love to play of Clifton Webb as Waldo Lydecker. He is a columnist sort of based on Walter Winchell, sort of a gossip columnists. He has some of the best dialogue in this film. And I'd love to play this intro clip sort of setting up the film.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"LAURA\")\n\nCLIFTON WEBB: (As Waldo) Murder is my favorite crime. I write about it regularly. And I know you'll have to visit everyone on your list of suspects. I'd like to study their reactions.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) You're on the list yourself, you know?\n\nWEBB: (As Waldo) Good. To have overlooked me would have been a pointed insult.\n\nGATES: Waldo is amazing.\n\nHARRIS: (Laughter).\n\nGATES: He's so sassy. He's one of those characters that you love to hate, which is, I think, a big part of this genre. I think this movie is in one of my Top 5 in terms of film dialogue ever.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. I also really enjoy Vincent Price in this.\n\nGATES: Oh, he's such a big sweetheart in this (laughter).\n\nHARRIS: He is. Like, he's...\n\nGATES: Big dope.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. He's not playing his sort of usual evil character. I mean, he's obviously one of the suspects because there's a lot of suspects in this movie. Yeah. I definitely appreciate just his performance and the fact that he's playing, like, this playboy who was working for Laura and also in love with Laura. Like, it's just very great.\n\nGATES: It's one of the few movies to really showcase that Vincent Price was a babe, and that multiple women would go after him, which I think is important and everyone can agree with. So (laughter)...\n\nHARRIS: Yes (laughter).\n\nGATES: But what I love about this film is it takes a lot of elements of noir. It has the detective. It has flashbacks. It has kind of femme fatales, kind of a homme fatale almost in a couple of the characters. But then it subverts a lot of what you expect to find. And I think the novel does that as well. It makes you sort of think about perspectives and how you never quite know. And I think - this is something that comes up in a lot of noir. You never quite know what people are thinking and what they're planning. And you think you do because you're following the detective. But even the detective tends to be a couple of steps ahead of the audience. So he's doing things that you're not sure why he's doing it. And then when it reveals, you're like, oh, wow. He went there. Like, it's fantastic.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. Well, that is a great first pick. And I think it's a really good primer for anyone who might not have seen or is not familiar with the film noir genre or era. And that is \"Laura.\" You can actually rent it VOD, including on Amazon, right now. Now my pick is actually going to jump ahead a few decades. And it's actually a film I saw for the first time last year during Noirvember. And it is \"Deep Cover,\" directed by Bill Duke, with a screenplay by Michael Tolkin and Henry Bean. And it stars Laurence Fishburne as a DEA agent, Russell Stevens, who is sent undercover, deep undercover. He has to sort of ingratiate himself into the crime world to take down a drug trafficker. And it's from the '90s and set in the '90s. It's got all of these amazing, like, great cinematography by Bojan Bazelli. There's all these, like, great colors. I also love all of Laurence Fishburne's costume.\n\nGATES: He's got fits in this movie.\n\nHARRIS: He's got so many fits. So it's '90s LA. And he gets involved with Jeff Goldblum, who plays this court attorney who is also a dirty court attorney who is working with drug traffickers. And it's just funny to see the way in which he moves on up, because he has, like, these awesome fits, these awesome jackets, that are super indicative of that era. And he also just has this great way of showing how his character goes from being, you know, straight edge, hard and narrow. He has this past where his father was a druggie and was actually killed. And he's like, I'm never going to do drugs. And of course, because of this, (laughter) he kind of gets sucked into it. And it's really interesting to watch him sort of get deeper and deeper into what's going on and also have to fight temptation at some point to not do drugs.\n\nI really just appreciate this movie so much because it's layering on so many things when it comes to discussion around politics, around race, around, like, what the war on crime and drugs was like at that time. And I think it does a really good job of doing that while also layering in all of these film noir elements. There's voiceover narration. And I want to play a clip of one of the best moments of voiceover narration. One of the things that I love so much about film noir is the way in which the voiceover narration is often kind of spicy and, like, really, really stylized. And this moment in particular, I think it's just great writing.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DEEP COVER\")\n\nLAURENCE FISHBURNE: (As Russell) I was a fool. I'd been turned out like a $2 hoe - used, abused, but with no towel and no kiss.\n\nHARRIS: It could have been written in the '40s, maybe minus the hoe part. But, like (laughter)...\n\nGATES: Yeah.\n\nHARRIS: It would have been a different word there, like a $2...\n\nGATES: It would have been a dame.\n\nHARRIS: ...Tramp or dame. Yeah. Something like that (laughter).\n\nGATES: What I love about this film - I'd actually not seen it until you recommended it. It's really stunning the way that they take noir tropes and sort of subvert them in a way to include commentary on race. And so like I said earlier, noir is, generally, films where everything goes wrong, right? They always make bad decisions. What's so interesting about this film is they really set it up so that there really isn't a good decision he can make.\n\nHARRIS: Right.\n\nGATES: It's sort of looking at the systematic place in which he finds himself where there isn't really good decisions to make. And I think that's why this film is so strong. I also read a really wonderful piece by Angelica Jade Bastien after the Criterion edition came out, where she talked about how the film - so a lot of noir tends to find itself on the fringes of society, especially in the early era. And she specifically pointed out a scene in \"Out Of The Past,\" with Robert Mitchum, where he is easily going through a jazz club. And it's not a thing. The race is not an issue. He's clearly someone who goes in and out of these places that were not really where white people were supposed to be in segregated America but because it's all in that sort of outer rim. And this film takes it a step further and makes you look at those places...\n\nHARRIS: Right.\n\nGATES: ...And puts it in those places and really takes the whiteness sort of out and what it's like to truly be in that sphere, which - it would make a great double feature with \"Devil In A Blue Dress,\" which is a...\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nGATES: ...A '40s-set noir that does kind of the same thing only in the era. That's a great film.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. I almost recommended that one, too. I mean, again, the cinematography and just the way that Laurence Fishburne and all of the Black characters are filmed, I think, is just - we talk so much about how, often, films don't get it right, especially from the '90s, where they look washed out or you can barely see them. But, like, all of the blue lights and the neon lights that just...\n\nGATES: Yes.\n\nHARRIS: They play with it so well. So that's \"Deep Cover.\" And you can stream it on HBO Max, and I highly recommend you do. And again, Laurence Fishburne just looks - he's, like, peak hotness there, so just had to throw that in there.\n\nGATES: Yes. Yes.\n\nHARRIS: For our final pick, we have a movie I've probably seen I don't know how many times. Well, I won't give it away. I'll let you introduce it. But (laughter) what is it, Marya?\n\nGATES: Yeah. My next pick is also from 1944. It's Billy Wilder's \"Double Indemnity.\"\n\nHARRIS: Yes.\n\nGATES: I'd love to play the clip real quick of Fred MacMurray sort of setting up the trouble he's got himself in.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DOUBLE INDEMNITY\")\n\nFRED MACMURRAY: (As Walter) Yes. I killed him. I killed him for money, for a woman. I didn't get the money. And I didn't get the woman.\n\nGATES: That's pretty much, like, 90% of noir from the '40s and '50s...\n\nHARRIS: (Laughter).\n\nGATES: ...Is that plot. What's lovely about this film is they take the voiceover and they take the flashback and they make it the entire film. So you know Fred MacMurray is shot. You know he's messed up. The rest of the film sort of takes you through how he got into this situation. It's sort of \"The Fresh Prince\" - like, I bet you're wondering how I got here.\n\nHARRIS: (Laughter).\n\nGATES: So this was from a novel by James M. Cain. And it was originally optioned by Hollywood in the '30s. And then the production code was like, no. This is too racy. And it took another 10 years for them to sort of adapt it in a way that was OK by the production code. But if you watch it, it's still super racy. Like, they just found ways to, like, have erotic dialogue that doesn't sound erotic...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGATES: ...But it really is. James M. Cain said this was the only adaptation of his work where they added things that he wish he had thought of, which I think is a really great compliment to the writers, which were Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler. And part of the reason I picked this film was I love Raymond Chandler in terms of his writing.\n\nHARRIS: Me, too. Yeah.\n\nGATES: His Philip Marlowe character is, like, my favorite, probably, fictional character ever. But \"Double Indemnity\" is probably the horniest of all of the classic era noirs. Barbara Stanwyck is literally on fire through the entire movie. She got an Oscar nomination. She plays Phyllis Dietrichson, the absolute pinnacle of femme fatale. She is just completely rotten. She calls herself rotten. But essentially, she dupes a insurance salesman into getting coverage on her husband and then murdering him for her. And then obviously, everything kind of goes wrong from there. Anything that could go wrong does go wrong. It features beautiful cinematography of LA. It features all of the scuzziest parts of LA that are right next to the fanciest parts of LA. And it really showcases that, which I always think is wonderful. This film really hits that home. And it has the most amazing Billy Wilder-style dialogue\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DOUBLE INDEMNITY\")\n\nBARBARA STANWYCK: (As Phyllis) There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour.\n\nMACMURRAY: (As Walter) How fast was I going, officer?\n\nSTANWYCK: (As Phyllis) I'd say around 90.\n\nMACMURRAY: (As Walter) Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket.\n\nSTANWYCK: (As Phyllis) Suppose I let you off with a warning this time.\n\nMACMURRAY: (As Walter) Suppose it doesn't take.\n\nSTANWYCK: (As Phyllis) Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.\n\nMACMURRAY: (As Walter) Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder.\n\nSTANWYCK: (As Phyllis) Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder.\n\nGATES: He sort of cut his teeth writing a lot of those fast-talking romantic comedies from the late '30s, the screwballs. And so you know you're going to get really fast dialogue and really sharp dialogue. And you're kind of never sure what anyone's thinking. But you know that they're all, you know, about to murder somebody or about to sleep with somebody, or a combination of the two.\n\nHARRIS: Well, that's \"Double Indemnity.\" And that is another movie that you can find available to rent on VOD, including Amazon. And if you haven't seen these movies, check them out. And if you have, go rewatch them because it's Noirvember now. And it's a great time of the year (laughter).\n\nGATES: It's the best time of the year. You just get some bourbon. Turn off the lights. Watch a couple of murders.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGATES: It's good. Yes.\n\nHARRIS: Marya thank you so much for being here and for being our film noir guide.\n\nGATES: Thanks for having me. I always love getting to talk about these movies and try to get new people watching them. I think, you know, if you're afraid that they're old and stodgy, you will be in for such a treat. They're the least stodgy films you'll ever see. They're very erotic and just - they feel modern.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nGATES: Absolutely.\n\nHARRIS: Well, we want to hear all about your favorite noir movies. So you can find us at facebook.com/pchh and on Twitter @PCHH. And we will see you all tomorrow. And we'll be talking about Judge Judy, the other side of the criminal (laughter) world.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.
