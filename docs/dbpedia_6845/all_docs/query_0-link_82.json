        "text": "Bianca’s Retrospective:\n\nWe’ve mentioned on several occasions that Dick Powell is one of our favorite tough guys in movies. After starring in lighthearted musicals and comedies and gaining the reputation of a crooner, Powell stepped outside of that role and completely changed his image with Murder, My Sweet (1944). Suddenly, Powell was labeled as a tough guy and his strong presence in film noirs and his witty yet on-the-cuff way of handling hard-boiled dialogue made his musical persona a thing of the past. My love for Dick Powell was a similar journey experienced by his fans when he was still on the screen. At first, I had watched him in musicals, all smiles and song, before transforming my image of him by glimpsing into his film noirs. While I’ll always love that singer, my heart really goes out to the private-eye image that he worked so hard to get.\n\nThe first time I saw Dick Powell was in a clip from Dames (1934). It was the production number of the title song and in the end, his head popped out of the picture of Berkeley girls as he sang the final riff. My first impression was, “wow, he’s so handsome!” I would end up watching that scene many, many more times as my fondness for classic musicals grew. While Powell was immensely popular during his Warner Bros. musical days, one would never know that there was a great actor hidden beneath all those footlight backdrops and breezy songs. All that was required of him at the time was to be likeable and cute, something which came naturally to him. Every once in a while his efforts showed more brightly than usual with vehicles like Happiness Ahead (1934), Thanks a Million (1935), and On the Avenue (1937) where his roles were more developed.\n\nBy the end of the ‘30s, he even progressed towards more solid comedies rather than musical-comedies. It’s in these comedies that one really does see that Powell was a great actor. For instance, try not feeling terrible for the guy when he finds out he didn’t win $25,000 in a contest in Christmas in July (1940) or laugh at his antics of predicting tomorrow’s news in It Happened Tomorrow (1944). He had very few disappointments in terms of vehicles and yet, he wasn’t satisfied with the work he was doing. After failing to win over Billy Wilder to cast him in Double Indemnity (1944), he went to RKO where they took a bet on him and gave him the role of Philip Marlowe in Murder, My Sweet. The producers at RKO said it was the best move they made and Wilder later revealed that he missed out on an opportunity when he saw the movie.\n\nSuddenly the happy-go-lucky singer was viewed as a wisecracking yet solemn and pessimistic tough guy that was well suited for noirs. His track record with film noirs and thrillers was even better than his one with musicals and comedies. He even made winners away from the genre that played with his new typecast, such as Station West (1948), which is as noir of a western as you’ll find and You Never Can Tell (1951), which was a comedy that still used his detective screen image. He also stole the show from the talent-heavy cast in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) as a screenwriter whose love for Hollywood turns to disgust. As far as the true noirs go, however, his were some of the best of the genre and yet underrated by today’s standards. They weren’t as sexual as something like Gilda (1946) or Out of the Past (1947), but they were as violent and unglamorous as they came at the time.\n\nFor instance, there’s a scene in Cry Danger (1951) where he abuses bad guy William Conrad by playing Russian Roulette with him while Conrad is laying defenseless on a table. Conrad comes out unscathed, but before he leaves, Powell just slaps him with force, because he can, and it is one of those moments that must be seen to be appreciated. Powell was making it clear that no one messed with him and oh boy do you take him seriously! Looking at Powell’s noirs, there are some co-stars that equal him or are able to competently share his limelight like Richard Erdman in Cry Danger (1951) and definitely Ruby Dee in The Tall Target (1951), but Powell was someone who couldn’t have the spotlight stolen from him. He finally made it to the genre where he truly belonged and he milked it for all it was worth and we’re glad he did. That’s why as tough guys go, Powell is one of the best. We always love the unexpected pros of noir.\n\nThree Recommended Lesser-Seen Films:\n\nHappiness Ahead (1934)\n\nTo the Ends of the Earth (1948)\n\nYou Never Can Tell (1951)\n\nVirginia’s Retrospective:\n\nAs with any actor that went through a career shift, Dick Powell’s filmography is viewed in sections. He was able to go from handsome, nice guy singer to charming comedy leading man to tough as nails film noir anti-hero within the span of three decades. Powell is probably best remembered to movie fans as the lead of many Busby Berkeley movies with a soothing voice and cute smile who left to do film noir, but to me he will always be known as one of the best film noir leads of all-time. Powell as the ruthless noir tough guy just works and part of why it works is because he started off doing easy-going musicals and comedies before taking the leap to the underground of noirs. Despite being a good singer, Powell himself got tired fast of doing breezy musicals and looking at his filmography it is no wonder why.\n\nPowell may appear in some notable vehicles, but his roles can basically be bogged down to leading man parts where he is just there to get with the girl in question. Powell may get to sing in 42nd Street (1933), Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), Footlight Parade (1933), Dames (1934), and Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935), but he is mostly just there as window dressing and to use his voice to win the girl. This is even the case for non-musical or semi-musical roles of Powell’s early career such as The King’s Vacation (1933) and Page Miss Glory (1935). There were several juicy lines in these classic films, but Powell wasn’t the one saying them. He just needed to look handsome and sing which he did just fine.\n\nPowell had more time to shine in comedic outings such as Thanks a Million (1935), Hard to Get (1938), Naughty But Nice (1939), but his best comedic films came after he left his home studio of Warner Bros. Christmas in July (1940) at Paramount and directed by Preston Sturges is easily one of Powell’s best movies and it is probably easily the best comedy he made. Part of what makes it work so well is because the character he plays is relatable and Powell plays him as such. He is a creative type that dreams of doing creative things which his job doesn’t promote him doing, so he enters a slogan contest. Powell would also get to show solid comedic acting chops in other vehicles like It Happened Tomorrow (1944) and You Never Can Tell (1951). Despite occasional good or great films, Paramount was not taking Powell where he needed to go. It was a step in the right direction, but it wasn’t the drastic change Powell’s career could have used especially since Paramount was on no shortage of comedic leading men. Powell then went to RKO and his career was never the same.\n\nPowell snaps, crackles, and pops as a film noir lead role and few movies showcase that better than his first outing in the genre, Murder, My Sweet (1944). Powell desperately wanted to do film noir for a while, but no one was willing to take a chance on him. After Murder, My Sweet, Powell no longer needed to prove himself and his new career was set in stone. Powell then made gritty, fine film noirs like Cornered (1945), Johnny O’Clock (1947), To the Ends of the Earth (1948), Pitfall (1948), and Cry Danger (1951). He also made the very noirish Western Station West (1948) and a great historical thriller with a noirish spin, The Tall Target (1951). Powell wasn’t just a regular film noir lead but he was sly and rough like the best of them. Not to mention, he also could take a punch keeping himself from being an indestructible hero. Powell was the type of noir anti-hero who was willing to get dirty if he felt the need to, so you better not cross him. This includes beating a guy to death in Cornered as well as playing Russian Roulette in Cry Danger. It was a far cry from the guy who sang “I Only Have Eyes for You” but that is what made it all the more better. It made him a likable and easy-to-root for presence but one that couldn’t stand to be double-crossed. That is what makes him one of the very best film noir heroes.\n\nPowell then shined in a dramatic role in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) but went out of films on the comedy Susan Slept Here (1954). When Powell did return to comedy, it appeared as though he never left although there was something stricter about his demeanor after appearing in so many dark noirs of the era. In terms of the musical, few people sang as many classics as he did and in comedies he was always reliable, but it was in the film noir where he would make his most lasting impression both as an actor and as a personality of classic cinema.\n\nThree Recommended Lesser-Seen Films:\n\nThanks a Million (1935)\n\nTo the Ends of the Earth (1948)\n\nStation West (1948)"
