        "text": "Generally speaking, we don’t cover TV here at Letterboxd (well, not yet...), but if there were ever a series that demanded our attention, it is Mark Protosevich’s new private-eye drama Sugar, which is positively oozing with a deep love for all things cinema.\n\nIt stars Colin Farrell as John Sugar, a high-end private eye with a mysterious past who, against the wishes of his handler Ruby (played by Kirby, now a mononym after previously being credited as Kirby Howell-Baptiste), agrees to take on a job from a high-powered Hollywood mogul (James Cromwell, channeling Sterling Hayden in The Long Goodbye and John Huston in both Chinatown and real life), whose beloved granddaughter is missing.\n\nIn addition to taking place in Los Angeles, and concerning a family that includes three generations of (fictional) Hollywood talent, Sugar really sells its celluloid bonafides by having its titular character be a total movie obsessive. He is both in a film-noir story and always talking about film noir. Although highly adept at contending with the messiness of contemporary criminality, Sugar seems to take all his cues from old movies.\n\nBeyond the excessive in-universe cinematic content in Sugar, each episode is also peppered with clips from movie classics to help illustrate Sugar’s mindset and predicaments. Moments from Kiss Me Deadly, Gilda, Johnny Guitar and The Big Heat show up in episode one alone. Sugar even carries Glenn Ford’s gun from that last title—not a replica but the actual gun Glenn Ford used while shooting The Big Heat.\n\nSo, yeah, the show often feels like it was made just for Letterboxd members. Especially in the earnestness with which it presents the enigmatic Sugar’s love for movies. Haunted by past traumas, he gives the sense that, on some level, he was saved by the films. Weren’t we all?\n\nProtosevich concedes that this aspect of Sugar’s character very much came from a personal place. “I would say so,” he chuckles. “Sugar, the character, gets to express a lot of what I feel [about movies] myself. It’s disappointing to me that there are so many young people and even people who want to get into making films, who don’t know the history of the medium, who don’t have an understanding of what great films came from the silent era through the ’30s and ’40s and ’50s and ’60s. I’m always kind of saddened that there’s not as much thirst for knowledge of the totality of cinema, or even international cinema.”\n\nYou’ve come to the right place, Mark. For many years, Protosevich was best known in Hollywood for his well-regarded screenplay adaptation of Richard Matheson’s I Am Legend, a project that eventually morphed into the (significantly different) Will Smith movie, on which Protosevich has a credit, and for writing the high-concept 2000 serial killer sci-fi thriller The Cell. He also has a credit on the first Thor, and wrote Spike Lee’s Oldboy remake. But there’s arguably more of him in Sugar than in anything he’s written before.\n\n“I always loved movies, but in my teens and my early twenties—these were the days of revival houses—I was going all over Chicago to try to see as many movies as possible,” reflects Protosevich. “God, I probably saw at least six films a week, and most of them were at revival theaters. I was hungry to know about all these different directors that I had read about. [After hearing that Rainier Werner] Fassbinder was influenced by Douglas Sirk, [I thought], let me see as many Douglas Sirk films as I can.\n\n“That was just something I was excited by, and I don’t know if there’s that [today]. I love it when I meet a young writer or young filmmaker who does have that appreciation for it. I know they’re out there; I’ve met many of them, but I wish it was there for more people. Who knows, maybe the show will make some people curious about some of the references used in the show. If some of them end up watching The Night of the Hunter for the first time, I’ll be absolutely thrilled.”\n\nWe were naturally keen to interrogate Protosevich about all the old movie clips scattered throughout the series, many of which artfully reflect the events being depicted, but he explains that the scenes weren’t actually part of his original conception, and were inserted by editor Fernando Stutz, a longtime collaborator of Oscar-nominated Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles, who directed half of Sugar’s episodes.\n\n“I thought it was a brilliant idea. I loved seeing those clips, and I think it’ll turn people on to a lot of those movies,” says Protosevich. “Fernando Stutz and Fernando Meirelles were the ones making those decisions during the editing process. I have to credit those guys for making a lot of those selections, and it was almost psychic at times because they picked a lot of my favorite films… In terms of private-eye films, I would throw in Chinatown, of course. Kiss Me Deadly is also a favorite, and Night Moves, the Arthur Penn movie.”\n\nNow we’re talking. Sugar knowingly exists in a long tradition of private-eye pictures set in Los Angeles, and the first film Protosevich cites as a major influence is Murder, My Sweet, the 1944 adaptation of novelist Raymond Chandler’s Farewell, My Lovely, starring Dick Powell (until then best known for light comedic roles) as legendary private eye Philip Marlowe.\n\n“My favorite private detective film noir,” enthuses Protosevich. “I will watch that movie two or three times a year—I’m that in love with it… It’s almost like textbook noir lighting and compositions. The private detective’s office, the neon signs, the shadows. The way they approached it from a visual standpoint I have a great affinity for. I like Dick Powell in it. He’s a very charming, funny, self-effacing Marlowe. There’s something kind of vulnerable about him; he’s not what people think of as a tough leading man. I’m a big Claire Trevor fan. I think she often gets forgotten a bit in terms of the great actresses of that period. I think she’s really wonderful.”\n\nRobert Altman’s laconic 1973 Chandler adaptation, The Long Goodbye, also casts a long shadow over Sugar. “What I really liked about that film, and this is something we talked about when making the show, is we didn’t want it to look and feel like a traditional film noir,” says Protosevich. “[The Long Goodbye] was a big influence in terms of the Sterling Hayden character and this culture of eccentric, creative people in the LA community with money and their secrets and their demons,” he continues. “I remember reading that Robert Altman would refer to the Marlowe character as ‘Rip Van Marlowe’, as if he were a man from the 1930s or ’40s who suddenly found himself in 1970s LA, and what would that be like for someone like that?”\n\nSugar additionally illustrates how much fun it can be to live in Los Angeles if you’re a fan of Hollywood lore. “I’m very fond of films set in LA, where LA is almost a character,” says Protosevich. “Specifically, Chinatown, L.A. Confidential and The Long Goodbye. I live on the East Coast now, but I lived in LA for a long time. There’s no other place like it, for better or worse. It was always essential for me to set the series there… I also wanted it to involve the movies, and the movie business and a family that had a movie history.”\n\nFilling out that movie history proved to be one of the most enjoyable—and film nerdy—aspects of making Sugar for Protosevich. “A fun thing for me to do was to create the fictitious films that the James Cromwell character had made and the films that his wife [fictitious starlet Lorraine Everly, played by Ruby Lewis] was in,” he shares. “In my own mind, I created storylines for all those films that James Cromwell did so that they fit into the time period that he would have been active as a producer.”\n\nIn one episode, TCM host Ben Mankiewicz cameos as himself, presenting a retrospective screening of a particular classic feature produced by Cromwell’s character. We get to see a scene from the Lorraine Everly movie in question play out, and its look and feel are note-perfect. “It was fun writing that [fictional] film, trying to put myself into the mind of a screenwriter of that period so that it did feel like it’s something that could have existed from that time,” says Protosevich.\n\nAmongst all of Sugar’s cinema-forward aspects, perhaps the boldest is simply that its main character vocally expresses such unfettered enthusiasm for the form. “Those are the conversations that I have with my friends,” Protosevich acknowledges. “I’ll put it this way: we talk about films the way most guys talk about sports. You see guys in films and TV shows talking about sports all the time. I enjoy sports, but I’m not obsessed with sports. But movies I care about and go off on tangents about, and I said that I’d like to see a character do that.”\n\nBeing true to himself was an overriding motivation for writing Sugar in the first place. “I wrote the scripts for the first two episodes and the series bible on spec during COVID, that first year in 2020,” he recalls. “I had reached a point in my career with the last feature script I worked on—it’s a project that never got made. It was frustrating, and I realized I had been writing for other people for a long time. I wanted to write something for myself. I’d had the idea for Sugar for years and toyed with it.”"
