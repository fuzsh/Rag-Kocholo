        "text": "When Philip Marlowe is leaving the Sternwood house near the end of The Big Sleep, he notes: \"Outside, the bright gardens had a haunted look, as though small wild eyes were watching me from behind the bushes, as though the sunshine itself had a mysterious something in its light.\" In Marlowe's world, even the most innocuous people and places have dark sides, and even sunlight can hide sinister secrets.\n\nThe LA that Marlowe moves through is both the one familiar to millions of American moviegoers from films of the era, and one that was unseen and unknown. A secret underworld of vice and corruption that ran from the meanest streets to the finest mansions. Marlowe's Los Angeles is a city of familiar landmarks yet built on greed and graft, on violence and deception.\n\nToday, true crime podcasts peel back the thin veneer of civilization and show us the darkness that even sunlight can hide. That same obsession with looking into the shadows that drew readers to the exploits of Philip Marlowe all those years ago keeps us listening and watching today.\n\nThe mystery story, as a genre, goes back a long way, and is one of the few genres to have a relatively clear literary genealogy. Beginning with Edgar Allan Poe's stories of \"ratiocination\" in 1841, the mystery genre has thrived on formula. Raymond Chandler's stories were far from the first to use the \"whodunit\" structure. It had already been going strong for nearly a century when he published his first tales in Black Mask magazine. But Chandler is one of the towering giants of the field, and the mystery and film noir genres would look very different without his sumptuous prose.\n\n\"The most durable thing in writing is style,\" Chandler once wrote, \"and style is the most valuable investment a writer can make with his time.\" That obsession with the preeminence of style is part of what set Chandler's writing apart from the rest of the people following the popular whodunit formula of the 1930s and '40s.\n\nWhile that formula has evolved over the years, it remains as popular today as it was in Chandler's time. From \"beach reads\" and cozy mysteries to the investigative procedurals that make up some of TV's most popular shows to true crime podcasts like Serial and My Favorite Murder, the same kinds of tricks that Chandler was using to bring Philip Marlowe to life throughout the mid-20th century are still keeping us tuned in or turning the page today.\n\nThe annals of crime fiction are filled with (usually white, frequently male) detectives who take charge and always get the bad guy - from Sherlock Holmes to Hercule Poirot, Sam Spade to Columbo. But while there were numerous literary precedents to Philip Marlowe, his manner of directly addressing the audience helps to place him as one of the seminal progenitors of the hard-boiled detective as contemporary audiences have come to know them.\n\nThough modern shows and stories may have diversified their detectives somewhat, that aggressive, \"masculine\" pragmatism can still be found in the protagonists of popular shows like NCIS, Criminal Minds, and Law & Order, to name just a few.\n\nRaymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe novels paint a picture of a Los Angeles as beautiful as it is rotten. As Marlowe digs into the seedy underbelly of the City of Angels, he finds corruption running through every stratum of society, from the richest to the poorest. This includes the people who are supposed to be stopping the kinds of activities he's investigating. The police and the press aren't merely willing to ignore crime and villainy - they are often active participants.\n\nToday's procedurals may be less inclined to indict the status quo quite so directly, but they often find their efforts toward justice frustrated by bureaucratic red tape that slows down investigations or lets the guilty go free on technicalities. This may be because people today have come to accept a little bit of corruption as part of the price of doing business, and in some cases, corrupt bureaucracies are seen as better than inefficient ones, as demonstrated in the \"efficient grease\" theory, described by the American Economic Association.\n\n\"Certain cities belong to a few writers,\" David S. Wills writes at Beatdom. \"LA, pure and simple, is 'Chandlertown.'\" In his seven novels and a handful of short stories featuring Philip Marlowe, Chandler captured a version of LA that was as familiar as the movies and as foreign as any distant shore. Part of how he did that was to juxtapose his tales of mean streets and secret sins with real-life places that people could stroll by, just like Philip Marlowe did.\n\nIn fact, Chandler's LA even inspired at least one \"mystery map\" showcasing locations from the stories that readers could visit in real life.\n\nThat sense of looking behind the curtain of a real place was part of what made Chandler's writing so mesmerizing, and it's a thrill that many still seek out in books, movies, and podcasts examining real crimes in familiar places.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious modern example of a detective who has to operate outside the law in order to get results is Batman - though of course, Batman existed before Philip Marlowe did. Still, Marlowe's \"above the law\" approach to solving crimes and righting wrongs influenced the evolution of the hard-boiled detective as a hero, and helped to give us Batman as he exists today, rather than the Batman of more than 60 years ago.\n\nPrior to Marlowe, most fictional detectives worked closely with the police, even when they weren't working directly for them. For Marlowe, however, the authorities are more likely to be antagonistic than helpful and are as riddled with corruption as the rest of the sun-drenched Los Angeles portrayed in Chandler's novels. While Batman has his Commissioner Gordon, he must operate outside the law in part because the legal system in Gotham is frequently portrayed as hopelessly corrupt. Similarly, Marlowe's tendency to solve cases his own way, without regard for the police, was informed by, and would continue to inform, fears of police corruption that are, if anything, even more topical today than they were when Chandler was writing."
