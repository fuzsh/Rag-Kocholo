        "text": "Goal Scoring Rundown:\n\nUSA – Megan Rapinoe (penalty kick), 61st minute: Ali Krieger’s attempted cross was deflected by a Dutch defender and arced into the Netherlands penalty area. Alex Morgan was first to the ball before taking a high boot from Stefanie van der Gragt in the right side of the box. After consulting with the VAR booth, referee Stephanie Frappart award the penalty kick. Rapinoe stepped to the spot for the third time in the tournament and coolly waited for Veenendaal to make the first move before dispatching the spot kick into the right side of the goal. USA 1, NED 0 [WATCH]\n\nUSA – Rose Lavelle (Samantha Mewis), 69th minute: Sam Mewis picked out Lavelle with a short, sideways pass near midfield. With acres of space in front of her, Lavelle drove straight up field toward goal. As she approached the box, Lavelle feinted to the right to move her defender and create space for a low, left-footed shot into the bottom right corner for her third goal in her first World Cup. USA 2, NED 0 [WATCH] FINAL\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nThis is the third World Cup in which the USWNT has never trailed throughout the tournament, a feat also achieved in 1991 and 2015.\n\nThe U.S. is unbeaten in its last 17 Women’s World Cup matches (14W-3D), winning the last 12 in a row. They are the only team to win 12 consecutive WWC matches, besting Norway's run from 95 to 99. Seven of the USA’s 12 wins have been by multiple-goal margins.\n\nAfter the win vs. the Netherlands, the USWNT is now 40-4-6 all-time in World Cup play, outscoring opponents 138-38 in 50 games. The 40 wins, 50 games-played and 138 goals scored are all FIFA Women’s World Cup records.\n\nThe USA is 7-1-0 all-time against the Netherlands.\n\nMegan Rapinoe is only the second player to start three Women's World Cup finals (2011, 2015, 2019), after Germany's Birgit Prinz (1995, 2003, 2007).\n\nThe victory was the 102nd of Jill Ellis’ career at the helm of the USWNT. Only the late Tony DiCicco (105) has more.\n\nThe USWNT has had nine different goal scorers at this tournament. Only the 2003 German team (10) and the 1999 American team (10) have had more at a single WWC.\n\n- U.S. Women’s National Team Match Report -\n\nMatch: U.S. Women’s National Team vs. Netherlands\n\nDate: July 7, 2019\n\nCompetition: 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup; Final\n\nVenue: Stade de Lyon; Lyon, France\n\nKickoff: 11 a.m. ET (5 p.m. local)\n\nAttendance: 57,900 (sellout)\n\nWeather: 88 degrees, sunny\n\nScoring Summary: 1 2 F\n\nUSA 0 2 2\n\nNED 0 0 0\n\nUSA – Megan Rapinoe (penalty kick) 61st minute\n\nUSA – Rose Lavelle (Samantha Mewis) 69\n\nLineups:\n\nUSA: 1-Alyssa Naeher; 5-Kelley O’Hara (11-Ali Krieger, 46), 7-Abby Dahlkemper, 4-Becky Sauerbrunn, 19-Crystal Dunn; 16-Rose Lavelle, 8-Julie Ertz, 3-Samantha Mewis; 17-Tobin Heath (10-Carli Lloyd, 87), 15-Megan Rapinoe (capt.)
