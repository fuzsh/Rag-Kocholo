        "text": "Precisely 624 footballers are heading to Germany in the coming days for the 2024 European Championship.\n\nAmong those 624 are the brightest, best and most gifted players that Europe has to offer. There are World Cup winners, Ballon d’Or winners, record international goalscorers and, if he makes the cut, Johnstone’s Paint Trophy winners with Barnsley in 2016 (hello Ivan Toney).\n\nYet one of the best strikers in the world, let alone Europe, won’t be in Germany.\n\nErling Haaland and Norway failed to qualify for the tournament, finishing third behind Scotland and Spain (they actually finished ahead of Georgia, who still went on to qualify through the play-offs because they had done well in the Nations League and then beat Luxembourg and Greece in play-off ties…UEFA, you are odd).\n\nIt has been 24 years since Norway last played at a Euros or a World Cup, raising the prospect that neither Haaland nor Martin Odegaard, both shortlisted for Player in the Year in England in 2023-24, may never play at an international tournament during their careers.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nUEFA Euro 2024 team guides: Everything you need to know about the squads\n\nTime is on their side, with Haaland aged 23 and Odegaard 25, but that will require a distinct improvement on Norway’s part. The Scandinavians were, believe it or not, ranked as the second-best football nation on the planet by FIFA in both 1993 and 1995, but in recent years, have fallen well short of their previous standards.\n\nHaaland and Odegaard are not the only high-profile players who won’t be in Germany this summer — Sweden didn’t make it either, meaning Alexander Isak and Dejan Kulusevski have the summer off — but in Haaland’s case in particular, it is quite unusual for a player of his standing to have yet to feature in a major tournament.\n\nHaaland finished second in the voting for the 2023 Ballon d’Or and you have to go all the way back to 1995 to find a top-three Ballon d’Or player who never played in a Euros: namely Finland legend Jari Litmanen, who never played at World Cup either. Liberia’s George Weah won the trophy that year and he is one of most commonly-known players in recent decades to never play at a World Cup, although he twice reached the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nBefore 1995, the last Ballon d’Or top-three finisher to never play at a Euros was Kenny Dalglish in 1983, more than four decades ago, showing how rare it is. Dalglish did play at World Cup for Scotland, however.\n\nTruly great players missing out on big tournaments was more common back then, by virtue of so few teams being able to qualify. Only four teams took part in the Euros finals from its first edition in 1960 through to 1976, then eight from 1980 to 1992, before an expansion to 16 teams at Euro 1996, which lasted until the 2016 edition when 24 qualified. UEFA has flirted with expanding it even more to 32 nations but for now, it remains 24 until at least the 2028 tournament in the UK and Republic of Ireland.\n\nRyan Giggs never played at a Euros (or a World Cup). Cardiff-born Giggs, one of the most decorated players in the recent history of European football, with 13 Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues, famously represented England at schoolboy level but always insisted he never regretted choosing Wales, saying: “I’d rather go through my career without qualifying for a major championship than play for a country where I wasn’t born or which my parents didn’t have anything to do with.”\n\nIan Rush, Liverpool’s all-time record goalscorer, did bemoan Wales never qualifying during his football lifetime, saying it was the only regret of his glittering career.\n\nFranz Beckenbauer once said that George Best was probably the greatest player never to feature at a World Cup and he didn’t play in a Euros either, with Northern Ireland only qualifying once in their history in 2016.\n\nBest was 36 and playing in America when they reached a World Cup for the first time in 1982, but he hadn’t played in England for five years and manager Billy Bingham didn’t pick him over fitness concerns.\n\n“I wished he had just taken me as a member of the squad and thrown me on for 15 minutes, only so I could have played in the World Cup,” Best later said.\n\nAlfredo Di Stefano won five European Cups and eight La Ligas with Real Madrid but Spain didn’t enter the inaugural Euros in 1960, when the forward was 34. They qualified for the 1962 World Cup but Di Stefano had a back injury and although he “practically begged” to go, he wasn’t picked. He duly retired from international football, two years before Spain won the Euros in 1964. It’s a cruel sport sometimes.\n\nIn this era, some nations didn’t even enter, like West Germany, who weren’t bothered about the first three, meaning the great Uwe Seeler never played at a Euros, for example, but given its lack of importance at the time, you can’t imagine either distinguished player was too crestfallen.\n\nThe same fate really shouldn’t befall Haaland and Odegaard, given how easy it is to qualify for a Euros now.\n\nFifty-three nations took part in qualifying for the tournament (almost all of UEFA’s member associations, minus Russia and hosts Germany) and 24 heading to Germany — 45 per cent of the continent.\n\nNorway are ranked 47th in the world, the 23rd-highest eligible European side, but they are not the highest ranked to fail to qualify (Sweden are 27th and Wales are 29th).\n\nSo what’s the problem? Odegaard makes lots of goals and Haaland scores lots of goals. Sounds easy, right?\n\nWell, apart from those two, Norway’s pool of talent is shallow and there is a noticeably large drop-off in standard compared to the rest of the squad.\n\nOf the 23 players called up for Norway’s June internationals (friendlies against Kosovo and Denmark) only four played regularly for a top-half team in one of Europe’s big leagues last season. They are Haaland, Odegaard, Napoli centre-back Leo Ostigard and Borussia Dortmund full-back Julian Ryerson.\n\nThere are other talented players, like 20-year-old forward Oscar Bobb, who is coming through at Manchester City but is not a senior player yet and made only two league starts last season, plus there is prolific Villarreal striker Alexander Sorloth, who scored 23 in La Liga last season and is currently injured.\n\nKeeper Orjan Nyland is a regular with Sevilla, Kristoffer Ajer has been decent in defence for Brentford and Jorgen Strand Larsen scored 13 for Celta Vigo in 2023-24. But compared to, say, Austria, who have 13 players from the Bundesliga alone, or Serbia, who have nine playing in Serie A, Norway come up well short. In their last international, they had players from Copenhagen, AZ Alkmaar and Bodo/Glimt.\n\nThat’s not a problem with a coherent XI playing to a solid plan and being more than the sum of their parts — but Norway aren’t doing that.\n\n“I’m tired of hearing all the arguments when we don’t deliver,” former Norway World Cup player Kjetil Rekdal said after their Euro 2024 qualification failure was confirmed last year.\n\n“We’ve heard them for 25 years. It’s the same rule again and again, with various coaches, teams, formations. The Norwegian men’s team almost always loses when there are decisive matches.”\n\nThe decisive match this time around happened a year ago, when Norway played Scotland in Oslo. They were 1-0 up with three minutes to play but the Scots dramatically turned the game on its head with two late goals. Given that Scotland had already beaten Spain, Norway’s task was always an uphill one after that.\n\nHaaland scored a penalty in that game but, otherwise, his contribution was minimal. The match was played just one week after Haaland and Manchester City completed a treble by winning the Champions League and, after some exuberant celebrations, Haaland was completely spent and he was duly subbed off with six minutes to go.\n\n“In the final few minutes Erling was on the field, we played with one less man,” Norway manager Stale Solbakken said. “He was completely empty.”\n\nHaaland’s contribution to the national team has been immense, with 30 goals from just 32 caps placing him just three goals behind the country’s all-time record goalscorer Jorgen Juve, who scored 33. As if to ram the point home, Haaland scored three goals in a friendly against Kosovo on Wednesday night, his 22nd career hat-trick.\n\nThat remarkable goalscoring record, though, like at Manchester City, doesn’t shield Haaland from criticism — although in this case it has nothing to do with his link-up play.\n\nInstead, Haaland, reminiscent of Giggs and Wales, gets stick for how many Norway games he misses. Norway have played 47 internationals since he won his first cap in 2019 and Haaland has played in 66 per cent of matches in that time. Haaland was booed by fans when he didn’t stop for selfies after the Scotland defeat — and the fact he has been known to travel to international matches on a private jet doesn’t go down too well at home, either.\n\nHaaland certainly isn’t the problem but again, like at City, there are games when he sees very little of the ball. If he is engulfed by a deep-lying defence, Norway’s options, unlike at City, suddenly become very limited.\n\nAs for the manager, it was seen as a coup when Stale Solbakken, who won eight Danish titles with Copenhagen over two spells, agreed to succeed Lars Lagerback, who resigned in 2020 after another failed qualification campaign. But despite having Haaland and Odegaard at his disposal, Solbakken hasn’t been able to create the kind of team dynamic that saw Wales, a country with a population almost half that of Norway, qualify for three tournaments from 2016 to 2022 despite, like Norway, having a couple of standout stars in Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, and the rest of the squad being a level (or more) below.\n\nSolbakken, who has been criticised back home for failing to improve a leaky defence (which is an area where Norway’s lack of top-level options are most barren) or to come up with a creative tactical plan for the side, has said he will resign if he can’t lead Norway to the 2026 World Cup.\n\nIt is a far cry from the 1990s, when Norway beat Brazil in the 1998 World Cup and reached the knockout stages (marginally losing 1-0 to Italy in the second round). Back then, they had 11 Premier League players in their squad including Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Henning Berg from Manchester United, Stig Inge Bjornebye and Oyvind Leonhardsen from Liverpool, and Tore Andre Flo from Chelsea. It would have been 12 had Steffen Iversen of Tottenham Hotspur made the cut, while John Arne Riise (Liverpool) and Eirik Bakke (Leeds) were to join the senior side in the next three years.\n\nThis was Norway’s golden era, when they reached the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, and the Euros in 2000, but it was the country’s only successful period to date. Before the 1990s, they were making up the numbers, like in qualification for the 1980s Euros when they lost seven and drew one of their eight qualifiers.\n\nAnd since? There have been close calls in recent years. Ahead of Euro 2016, they went into the final round of qualification games in second place, two points ahead of Croatia, but lost to Italy while Croatia edged through with a 1-0 win in Malta. Norway then lost to Hungary in the play-offs. Overall, it’s been 24 years of hurt and counting.\n\nIt is not just about talent — Morten Gamst Pedersen, John Carew, Brede Hangeland and Riise were all excellent top-level players and none of them played in a tournament — but there is a feeling that in a country where football isn’t the most popular sport (skiing takes that crown), other more technical nations have overtaken Norway.\n\nThere is hope for the future, not least in teenager Antonio Nusa at Club Bruges, who has been likened to Neymar and who The Athletic has previously described as “a two-footed wide forward with gliding pace and beguiling skill, who can drive with the ball or caress it around the tightest corners”.\n\nBut Norway have had hope for the future plenty of times before, like in 2016 when a young lad called Odegaard was being talked about as a wonderkid who could lead them to a tournament; ditto some youngster called Haaland when he broke through in 2019.\n\nIf Haaland and Odegaard aren’t to follow in the unwanted footsteps of Giggs, Di Stefano and Best, Norway will need more.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nTeam Haaland: The people behind striker - and why he could be worth £1bn one day\n\n(Top photo: Fredrik Varfjell/NTB/AFP via Getty Images)"
