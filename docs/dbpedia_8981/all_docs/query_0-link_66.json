        "text": "England’s Lionesses romped home to victory last night with an incredible 4-0 win over Sweden in the UEFA Women’s EURO 2022 semi-final. It is the 19th game in a row that the England team has won, and their roaring success qualifies the Lionesses for their first major tournament final in 13 years.\n\nWhen and where is the UEFA Women’s EURO Final 2022?\n\nWembley Park / Quintain\n\nThe final will take place on Sunday 31 July 2022, kicking off at 5pm. Hosted by the world-famous Wembley Stadium, in the heart of Wembley Park – London’s most exciting new neighbourhood, just 12 minutes from central London. The stadium has a capacity of 90,000 and is excited to welcome families to watch world-class football beneath its hallowed arch. Tickets for the UEFA Women’s EURO 2022 tournament have been priced to appeal to families with over half a million tickets at £25 or less.\n\nWho will take part in the final?\n\nThe two teams facing off against one another in the UEFA Women’s EURO Final 2022 have been determined by the outcomes of the matches played over the course of July. England’s Lionesses are already through to the final, where they will face either France or Germany, depending on who wins tonight’s remaining semi-final.\n\nUEFA Women’s EURO: 5 Fast Facts\n\n1. The UEFA Women’s EURO dates to 1984, when the European Competition for Women’s Football qualification was held.\n\n2. Sweden won that first tournament, while Norway won the following in 1987. Germany won the following two tournaments, before Norway raised the trophy once more in 1993. Germany then dominated for years, winning every tournament from 1995 to 2013 inclusive. In the last tournament, in 2017, the Netherlands beat Denmark in a decisive 4-2 victory.\n\n3. Up until 1995, just four teams took part in each tournament. That increased to eight teams in 1997 and to 12 in 2009. The current number of teams – 16 – has been in place since 2017.\n\n4. The 2022 UEFA Women’s EURO will be the second time that England has hosted the tournament, with the last time being in 2005.\n\n5. England holds the record for the most goals scored in a single group stage, having scored 14 this year, 2022.\n\nHow to get to Wembley Park?\n\nWembley Park station, Wembley Park\n\nWembley Park makes everything easy when it comes to getting there – as you might expect from a destination that has been hosting events since 1894.\n\nJust 12 minutes from Central London, Wembley Park is served by three London Underground lines (Jubilee, Metropolitan and Bakerloo), mainline rail (Chiltern Railways and Southern Railways) and the London Overground, meaning that visitors can travel however suits them best. Secure car parking for 3,000 cars is also available on-site; with 39 electric vehicle chargers located within Pink Parking. Pre-booking is advisable on event days.\n\nFor residents of Quintain Living – the award-winning management company overseeing the rental of more than 3,250 apartments in Wembley Park – travel arrangements aren’t necessary. Those who have tickets to the match can simply walk to the stadium from their homes perfectly situated around it. Others can soak up the atmosphere from their balconies, podium gardens or roof terraces, or pop to the neighbouring BOXPARK Wembley to enjoy the pre-match build up at the official Fanpark (tickets required for guaranteed entry, arrival before 1pm) with live music and special guests."
