        "text": "The FA and UEFA have released the UEFA Women’s Euro 2022 ‘Pre-tournament Impact Report’ which predicts £54 million will be generated for England.\n\nThe report, by Big 4 accounting firm EY, indicates that the tournament is set to be ‘the biggest women’s European sport event in history’ with ticket sales on track to double the attendance of the UEFA Women’s EURO 2017 in the Netherlands which welcomed over 240,000 fans.\n\nThe tournament, held in the nine host cities of Brighton & Hove, London, Manchester, Milton Keynes, Rotherham, Sheffield, Southampton, Trafford and Wigan & Leigh, will undoubtedly provide ample marketing opportunity for brands and agencies.\n\n“The Host Cities are expecting 96,000 international visitors from 95 territories and there will be engagement from fans from all over the world as the international broadcast audience could reach over 250 million across more than 195 territories,” the FA said.\n\n“Host cities will also see a positive socio-economic impact thanks to over 5,500 people taking part in the tournament volunteering and legacy programme.”\n\nREAD MORE: International Women’s Day: LinkedIn sponsor UEFA Women’s Euro 2022\n\nAccording to the report, 51% of football fans plan to watch the games taking place in the ten selected stadiums. Ticket prices will start at £10 for adults and £5 for under 16s.\n\n“Our aim is twofold: to deliver a record-breaking tournament and to leave a tangible legacy to grow the women’s game. By inspiring fans at home and abroad, and by committing to provide playing opportunities to girls in every school and club across the country, I am confident we can deliver on both aims,” FA Euro 2022 board member and director of women’s football, Baroness Sue Campbell, said.\n\nThe FA will provide opportunities for more than 500,000 women and girls to engage and participate with football through the focused efforts of ‘legacy groups’ within each of the host cities in July.\n\nUEFA chief of women’s football Nadine Kessler added: “This pre-tournament report proves that the impact won’t stop with the final whistle at Wembley. UEFA Women’s EURO 2022 has a unique chance to be a catalyst for change locally, nationally, across Europe and beyond.\n\n“The tournament and our collective ambition will positively impact local economies and tourism, people and communities and the global visibility of the women’s game, whilst providing valuable inspiration for the future.”"
