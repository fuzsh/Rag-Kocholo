        "text": "Women's football has grown exponentially in the 21st century, especially over the past several years. We've seen record-breaking attendance at the league and international level, we've seen national teams closing the competitive gap to traditional giants of the game, and young stars are popping up all over the world to illustrate the rising immense talent.\n\nAt the center of it all is the individual talent on show. From legends such as United States' Mia Hamm and Brazil's Marta, to younger players Alexia Putellas, Sam Kerr and more, they've all contributed to the game in their own unique way. So how do we rank them against each other?\n\nAfter looking at individual achievements, their performances for club and country, and their overall impact on the game, we were able to put together the best 20 women's soccer players in the 21st century.\n\nLet the debate begin!\n\n1. Marta\n\nKey accomplishments: Six-time FIFA World Player of the Year, Brazil's top goal scorer all time, record World Cup goal scorer, Golden Ball winner 2007 Women's World Cup, Golden Boot winner 2007 Women's World Cup\n\nThere may be a temptation for Marta to stay on for one last crack at the World Cup on home soil in 2027, but as it stands the Paris Olympics is her last try for a world title with the Brazilian national team. Not having such an honor does not put the slightest dent in her legacy. Marta is quite simply the most important player in the history of women's football. There will never be another Marta.\n\nGliding past opponents, beating keepers with a wand of a left foot, Marta came from nowhere -- a poor family in a remote part of Brazil -- to legitimize the sport in places where it struggled to be taken seriously. The inspirer of millions of dreams, the one who showed that the women's game can be an art form. -- Tim Vickery\n\nMarta's World Cup finale overshadowed by Brazil's poor play\n\n2. Aitana Bonmatí\n\nKey accomplishments: Five-time Liga F champion, six-time Copa de la Reina winner, three-time Champions League winner, two-time Champions League final MVP, FIFA World Cup winner, World Cup final MVP, World Cup Golden Ball, Ballon d'Or winner\n\nBonmatí's 2022-23 campaign is unrivalled in women's soccer. She won the top prizes in club and international football -- the Champions League with Barcelona and the World Cup with Spain -- and was named the MVP in both finals.\n\nShe is a midfielder who can do everything: dictate games, beat players, create chances and score. That success with Barça and Spain saw her crowned the best player in the world, as she was awarded both the Ballon d'Or and named The Best FIFA Women's Player for the first time in her career. -- Sam Marsden\n\nAitana Bonmati talks 'Barcelona DNA,' pressure of winning and UWCL final\n\n3. Alexia Putellas\n\nKey accomplishments: Eight-time Liga F champion, eight-time Copa de la Reina winner, three-time Champions League winner, Champions League Player of the Season winner, World Cup winner, two-time Ballon d'Or winner, two-time The Best FIFA Women's Player winner\n\nPutellas' career has been a battle on and off the pitch. On the pitch, she has transformed Spanish soccer, playing a part in Barça winning three Champions Leagues in four years and Spain becoming world champions. Off the pitch, she led the fight against the Spanish Football Federation for improved working conditions.\n\nShe has become an icon in Barcelona, where her image has filled huge advertising boards in the city centre, and she is known as La Reina.\n\n\"She is the captain and the queen of Barcelona for a reason,\" teammate Lucy Bronze said after Putellas' goal in the 2024 Champions League final. \"She showed today why she is a back-to-back Ballon d'Or winner.\" -- Marsden\n\nPutellas key to Spain's Women's World Cup hopes after injury\n\n4. Mia Hamm\n\nKey accomplishments: Two-time World Cup winner, two-time Olympic gold medalist, two-time NCAA Division I champion, three-time ESPYS winner, U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame inductee\n\nMia Hamm is perhaps the first global superstar to emerge out of women's soccer, and she was a reluctant one at that. But on the field, in contrast, she played with the confidence and killer instinct you'd expect from one of the world's greatest goal-scorers.\n\nThroughout a brilliant career, Hamm had a knack for exceptional ball control and precision in her shots. That's why she still is the No. 2 goals leader for the USWNT, with 158 international goals. -- Caitlin Murray\n\nThe essence of Mia\n\n5. Alexandra Popp\n\nKey accomplishments: Two-time UEFA Women's Champions League winner, seven-time Frauen-Bundesliga winner, three-time Germany Footballer of the Year\n\nIn every interview about Popp, her leadership is consistently commended. Germany's former manager, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, called her \"a great leader and one of the very best,\" while former Wolfsburg head coach Ralf Kellermann described her as \"one of the most influential personalities in football.\" The 33-year-old has been the prolific driving force behind Wolfsburg and Germany's success since 2012, so much so that her absence in either team leaves a significant gap after more than a decade of contributions.\n\n\"Her mentality and the energy she exudes every day inspire and motivate us all,\" teammate Sara Däbritz added. -- Keogh\n\nGermany striker Alexandra Popp 'proud' of record-setting Euro\n\n6. Kim Little\n\nKey accomplishments: Three-time Women's Super League winner, three-time FA Cup winner, two-time NWSL Shield winner, PFA Women's Player of the Year 2015\n\nWhen asked to describe Little in one word, current and former Arsenal players used terms such as \"leader,\" \"colossal,\" \"inspiring,\" \"intelligent\" and \"irreplaceable.\" Former USWNT star Tobin Heath stated, \"I have never played with a better player than Kim Little,\" a sentiment shared by many.\n\nSince her career began in 2006, the former Scotland international has consistently excelled on the pitch. Although she is a quiet presence within the team, her experience and leadership have been vital to the club's success. Little's impact goes far beyond her impressive skills, making her one of the best players to grace the WSL. -- Keogh\n\n2022 ESPN FC Women's Rank: The 50 best footballers in the world today\n\n7. Birgit Prinz\n\nKey accomplishments: Two-time FIFA World Cup winner, five-time UEFA European Championship winner, three-time FIFA World player of the year, eight-time German player of the year, nine-time Frauen-Bundesliga winner, 2003 World Cup Golden Ball winner\n\nOne of the best finishers world football has ever seen, Birgit Prinz's limitations were obvious, she was never that fast and her standing jump wasn't much to write home about but her strength on the ball meant that when the opportunity was there, Prinz almost always won the aerial ball or reached out a long leg to get the final touch. Her understanding of when to dash into the box and strike, of where to be to receive just the right pass from her teammates was bar none and that relentless goal scoring, a bit part of Germany's success across multiple World Cups and European Championships during her 17 years representing her national team. -- Lawson\n\nGreatest Women's Euros moments, goals, controversies: From Prinz's brilliance to prize money and pitches\n\n8. Ada Hegerberg\n\nKey accomplishments: Nine-time French League winner, six-time UEFA Women's Champions League winner, six-time French Cup winner, Ballon d'Or winner, record for most goals in UEFA Women's Champions League\n\n\"I want to get ahead of my limits. That is what I want to do as an athlete -- explode all limits that exist,\" Hegerberg said in 2022. Her tally of 264 goals in 244 games so far for Lyon, with 60 of those coming in the Champions League, proves that the Norwegian striker is limitless when it comes to goal-scoring prowess. This makes her an indomitable threat, but by her own admission, Hegerberg wants to set more records.\n\nClub teammate Eugénie Le Sommer noted that Hegerberg possesses \"unconventional qualities,\" which contribute to and inform her remarkable finishing skills. -- Keogh\n\nCan Ada Hegerberg be Norway's hero? Why winning might require more than just the star's return\n\n9. Pernille Harder\n\nKey accomplishments: Five-time Frauen-Bundesliga winner, four-time DFB-Pokal Frauen winner, three-time Women's Super League winner, three-time FA Cup winner\n\nThere is a reason Harder has won a league title every season since 2013 with four different clubs in four different countries. She possesses an intrinsic ability to elevate the clubs she plays for to new heights. Her presence, versatility, and experience uplift those around her, while her movement and knack for finding space and breaking defensive lines create a formula for success.\n\n\"She joined an already amazing team and took us to an even higher level,\" former coach Emma Hayes said in 2021. \"Her standards day in, day out should be what every young person looks up to.\" -- Keogh\n\nBest 2023 Women's World Cup players: Morgan, Harder, Caicedo, more\n\n10. Vivianne Miedema\n\nKey accomplishments: Women's Super League winner, Frauen-Bundesliga winner, three-time FA Cup winner, UEFA Women's European Championship winner, all-time top goal scorer in Women's Super League, Netherlands all-time top goal scorer\n\nDespite becoming the Women's Super League all-time top scorer and setting numerous records, Miedema remains unfazed by her success. \"It's just another record or milestone that's there to be broken and that's the way I've always been. I've always treated records and landmarks as something to hit, be done with and then just move on,\" she said after reaching 100 goals for Arsenal.\n\nThis mindset likely contributes to her rapid success. She isn't focused on being the best, but is steadfast in giving 100%, and her approach to milestones is why she continues to excel. -- Keogh\n\nWhy are Arsenal letting Miedema go and will they regret it?\n\n11. Homare Sawa\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA world player of the year, two-time AFC women's player of the year, 2011 World Cup Golden Ball winner, 2011 World Cup Golden shoe winner, two-time Nadeshiko League MVP, 2014 AFC Hall of Fame inductee\n\nThe gruelling 2011 Women's World Cup was drawing to a close and after having pushed the final to extra time thanks to Aya Miyama's late strike, Japan were fast running out of [extra] time to find a second equaliser. With just three minutes left of the allotted 30, Homare Sawa raced through the box, determined to be the one to meet Miyama's shallow corner, and with the outside of her boot, Nadeshiko's captain deftly flicked the ball through the crowded box and into the back of Hope Solo's net.\n\nSawa's timing and touch were just right -- as they so often were -- and the goal was enough to force penalties and give Japan and Sawa a piece of history in Germany. That moment is a major illustration of her legacy and prowess. -- Lawson\n\nWhat's not to like about Homare Sawa?\n\n12. Caroline Graham Hansen\n\nKey accomplishments: Five-time Liga F winner, three-time UEFA Women's Champions League winner, four-time Copa de la Reina winner, three-time Frauen-Bundesliga winner\n\nIt is quite remarkable that Graham Hansen doesn't receive the individual acclaim she deserves, because few players possess the innate ability to conjure scoring opportunities out of thin air like the Norwegian winger. During the 2023-24 campaign, she reached new heights, solidifying her status as one of the best current players. Overcoming previous injuries and setbacks, she notched 30 goals in 38 appearances for Barcelona, with more than 40 goal contributions in just 25 Liga F games and helped the titleholders retain their Champions League crown.\n\nHer exceptional performance in this campaign showcased why she is so highly regarded by her teammates. -- Keogh\n\nBarcelona's Caroline Graham Hansen quietly leads team that wants more both on and off the field\n\n13. Christine Sinclair\n\nKey accomplishments: Top goal scorer in international football (men's or women's), Olympic Golden Boot, two-time Bobbie Rosenfeld award winner (given to Canada's top female athlete), two-time MAC Hermann winner (given to the top men's and women's college soccer player)\n\nThere is no one anywhere in senior football who can boast the same scoring proficiency as Christine Sinclair, yet what makes her so remarkable is her calm leadership on the pitch. Like a true captain, she uplifts those around her and even if she was the one routinely finding the back of the net for Canada, her ability to drift between roles from striker to playmaker, and do whatever her nation needed, is what made her truly great. Her overall longevity and potency in the game speaks to a great soccer mind, one that's always adapting. -- Lawson\n\nThe legacy of Christine Sinclair, soccer's greatest-ever goal scorer\n\n14. Sam Kerr\n\nKey accomplishments: Five-time Women's Super League winner, three-time FA Cup winner, all-time top goal scorer for Australia\n\nIn the semifinals against powerhouse England, Kerr scored her first goal of the 2023 World Cup in the 63rd minute to level the tie. Despite missing the entirety of the group stage due to an ankle injury on the eve of Australia's opening game, her tenacity, inability to give up and technical talent shone through. Kerr's exquisite finish stunned the world.\n\nAlthough Australia ultimately fell 3-1, Kerr's rocket strike from outside the 18-yard box earned her widespread acclaim and highlighted her extraordinary talent as a player on the world stage. -- Keogh\n\nSam Kerr and the joy and pressure of being Australia's captain at the Women's World Cup\n\n15. Megan Rapinoe\n\nKey accomplishments: Two-time FIFA World Cup winner, Olympic gold medal winner, three-time NWSL Shield winner, Ballon d'Or winner, French League winner\n\nOne of the most recognised names in world soccer, Megan Rapinoe has achieved incredible things both on and off the pitch. With the ball at her feet, Rapinoe created magic for the USWNT, including a pivotal assist to Abby Wambach for the equaliser against Brazil in the 2011 Women's World Cup quarterfinals.\n\n\"It was a combination of technical proficiency and IQ,\" former coach Jill Ellis said. \"Megan has very good instincts. She understands when to come inside, when to stay wide, and she became the most extraordinary crosser of the ball.\" -- Keogh\n\nNo Hollywood ending for Rapinoe, but her legacy is assured\n\n16. Kelly Smith\n\nKey accomplishments: Six-time Women's English League winner (now Women's Super League), Five-time FA Cup winner, UEFA Women's Cup (now Champions League) winner, Women's Super League Hall of Fame inductee\n\nAfter the 2007 World Cup, former teammate Alex Scott said Smith drove England forward \"with infectious enthusiasm\" and said \"she changed the dynamic, and we all followed her lead,\" after scoring twice against Japan. Smith quickly became widely regarded as one of the best players to come out of England by those who played with and against her.\n\nRenowned for her speed, ball control and quickness of thought, she was imperative to Arsenal's early success, winning the UEFA Women's Cup and achieving the club's first and only quadruple in 2006-07. -- Keogh\n\nEngland women's record goal scorer Kelly Smith retires\n\n17. Wendie Renard\n\nKey accomplishments: Eight-time UEFA Champions League winner, Seven-time FIFPro World XI, 16-time French League winner, Champions League defender of the season 2019-20, World Cup Dream Team 2015\n\nFrance's Fox in the box (\"renard\" meaning fox in French), Lyon's rangy reliable centre-back has been an ever present for both Lyon and France for 13 years, her most obvious skill her heading ability. But Renard is more than just a towering presence; she knows how to weave through a crowd and get her head on the ball before anyone else, her aerial prowess as important at the defensive end as it is at the attacking one.\n\nOver the years, those goals have proved to be vital for France time and again: Renard has scored 38 times for her country -- the seventh most of any player to have represented Les Bleues. -- Lawson\n\nFrance defender Wendie Renard's improbable journey to the World Cup, in her own words\n\n18. Dzsenifer Marozsán\n\nKey accomplishments: Seven-time French League winner, five-time UEFA Champions League winner, UEFA European Championship winner, three-time UNFP Player of the Year, three-time German footballer of the year, Champions League midfielder of the season 2019-20\n\nA talented youth player who played a key part in FFC Frankfurt's 2014-15 Champions League triumph, \"Maro\" is best known for her time at Olympique Lyonnais, where she won a combined total of 19 pieces of silverware with the French powerhouse. The playmaker was at her best in 2016, remembered for scoring the decisive goal in the 2016 Olympic final before she transitioned from Frankfurt to Lyon. Her calm on the ball and ability to send in pinpoint balls from anywhere in midfield was enough to turn heads in France; so too was her ability to perfectly execute the pass to match her vision. -- Lawson\n\nGermany beats Sweden for first gold medal in women's soccer\n\n19. Alex Morgan\n\nKey accomplishments: Two-time FIFA World Cup winner, Olympic gold medal winner, UEFA Champions League winner, NWSL Shield winner, French League winner\n\nDescribed as one of the greatest games in women's soccer, Manchester's Old Trafford erupted at the London 2012 Olympics when Morgan netted the winner against Canada, securing the USWNT's place in the final.\n\n\"I was saying the whole time, 'I don't care who scores as long as someone friggin' scores and we win,'\" said the then-23-year-old Morgan. With 30 seconds left in added time, Abby Wambach sent the ball to Heather O'Reilly, who crossed to Morgan. She headed home over Canadian goalkeeper Erin McLeod, securing a 4-3 victory, the U.S. then defeating Japan 2-1 to win Olympic gold. -- Keogh\n\nWhy Alex Morgan was left off the USWNT's Olympic roster\n\n20. Kristine Lilly\n\nKey accomplishments: 2015 US Soccer Hall of Fame inductee, 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year runner-up\n\nLong regarded as one of the greatest players of her generation, and indeed one of the best to represent the Stars and Stripes, there's certainly no one who comes close to Kristine Lilly's longevity: Her 354 caps haven't been topped since her retirement in 2010. Maybe the most important moment of those 354 caps was Lilly's goal-line clearance in the 1999 World Cup final, which denied China in extra time to push the game all the way to penalties and cemented the 99ers' place in U.S. soccer history. -- Lawson\n\nKristine Lilly: A true Hall of Famer\n\nJust missed the list\n\n21. Hege Riise\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, UEFA European Championship winner, Olympics gold medalist, NFF \"Best Footballer Ever,\" 1995 World Cup Golden ball\n\nLong before Hegerberg and Graham Hansen, there was Riise, the enigmatic attacker who was at the forefront of Norway's early successes on the international stage, her goals vital in each major piece of silverware the Football Girls collected through the 1990s and 2000s.. -- Lawson\n\nHege Riise to lead Team Great Britain at Olympics\n\n22. Amandine Henry\n\nKey accomplishments: Seven-time UEFA Champions League winner, 2015 World Cup Silver Ball, 2015 World Cup All-star team\n\nA midfielder with exceptional vision and skill, two of Henry's greatest moments were in fact goals: the determined winner against Brazil in the quarterfinals of France's home World Cup, and her stunner for Lyon in the 2022 Champions League final that proved to be the difference against Barcelona. -- Lawson\n\nFrench Star Amandine Henry Heads To NWSL's Portland Thorns\n\n23. Hope Solo\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, two-time Olympic gold medalist, 2009 U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year, 2-time FIFA World Cup Golden glove, 2011 FIFA Bronze Ball, 2022 Soccer Hall of Fame inductee\n\nAlthough Solo was not the first goalkeeper in women's football, she was one who brought wider recognition to the role and quickly elevated herself to being one greats of the position. She was at her peak during the USWNT's runs at the 2011 and 2015 World Cups. -- Lawson\n\nAll Hope, No Change: The Complicated Life And Times Of Hope Solo\n\n24. Abby Wambach\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, two-time Olympic gold medalist, six-time U.S. Soccer athlete of the year, 2011 Silver Ball winner, 2011 AP Female Athlete of the Year, 2016 ESPY Icon award\n\nOf course there are her goals -- she previously held the record for most scored by a single player in international football before being overtaken by Sinclair -- but Wambach's legacy is of her steadfast mentality that kept her pushing and believing the U.S. would always have one more chance in a game, such as their last-gasp win over Canada at the 2012 Olympics. -- Lawson\n\nAfter the storm\n\n25. Julie Foudy\n\nKey accomplishments: Two-time FIFA World Cup winner, two-time Olympic gold medalist, 2007 U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame inductee, 1997 FIFA fair play award\n\nLong before she started her work in punditry and activism, Foudy was the U.S. team's rock in midfield, leading from the front first as co-captain then for four years as captain of her national team. Like Riise, though, her greatest moments -- winning the 1991 and '99 World Cups -- were last century. -- Lawson"
