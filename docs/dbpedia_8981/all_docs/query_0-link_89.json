        "text": "The return of tournament football is almost upon us with the eagerly-anticipated Women's Euro 2022 quickly approaching.\n\nThe summer tournament gets underway on July 6 at Old Trafford with hosts England taking on Austria, before coming to a conclusion on July 31 at Wembley Stadium.\n\nFor just the second time in its history, there will be 16 teams competing for the prestigious award, with Spain coming into the tournament as favourites.\n\nBelow, Sportsmail takes you through each and every team in the competition and assesses how likely they are to be crowned champions.\n\nGroup A: England, Austria, Norway, Northern Ireland\n\nEngland\n\nWho's the manager?\n\nSarina Wiegman - Guided Holland to Euros victory last time out in 2017, defeating England in the semi-finals en route. The 52-year-old was named Best FIFA Women's Coach for her 2017 triumph and also led Holland to the final of the Women's World Cup two years later, where they were beaten by the United States.\n\nWiegman became manager in September last year, and England are still to lose under her management.\n\nThey also won the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup - which included Euro favourites Spain - in February, and the Lionesses are going strong in their World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nWho's the star player?\n\nEllen White - The 33-year-old is England's all-time record scorer with 50 goals and the Lionesses will need her to be on form if they are to go deep into the tournament.\n\nWhite is heading into her third European Championships, but her preparation has been disrupted after testing positive for Covid, meaning she missed their penultimate warm-up game against Holland.\n\nThe Manchester City star was the joint-top scorer at the 2019 World Cup, and notched an impressive six goals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nOne of the perks of hosting the tournament is that your qualification is guaranteed. A down side to that, though, is a lack of real competitive football in the build-up to the tournament.\n\nThat's not been too much of an issue due to the ongoing 2023 World Cup qualifying campaign. England have won all eight fixtures to date, including a stunning 20-0 victory over Latvia. In fact, they have scored a whopping 68 goals and are yet to concede a single goal.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 5/5\n\nAustria\n\nWho's the manager?\n\nIrene Fuhrmann - The 41-year-old took over in 2020, having previously been the assistant to long-serving coach Dominik Thalhammer, who led Austria to the Euro 2017 semi-finals.\n\nFuhrmann, who was capped 22 times by Austria as a player, had previously been in charge of the U19s side. In getting the job, Fuhrmann became Austria's first female manager, and she has since developed them into a seriously tricky side.\n\nWho's the star player?\n\nNicole Billa - The forward is comfortably Austria's most important player, having scored a brilliant seven goals in eight appearances throughout qualifying. She's been equally prolific in World Cup qualifying, where she has 10 goals to her name in just seven games.\n\nBilla, who plays her club football for Hoffenheim, won Footballer of the Year in Germany in 2021, having claimed the Golden Boot award in the 2020/-21 campaign. She failed to score in any of her five outings at Euro 2017, however.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nAustria had never qualified for the Women's Euros before 2017 - where they reached the semi-finals - but they made it back-to-back triumphs by finishing second in Group G.\n\nThey did so in style, winning six of eight games, dropping points only in a draw and a loss against group winners France. In fact, the three goals shipped in their 3-0 defeat to France were the only goals they conceded throughout qualifying. Their points tally of 19 was enough to see them granted one of three best runner-up spots and therefore a place in the tournament.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 2/5\n\nNorway\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nMartin Sjogren - The 45-year-old has been in the hot-seat since 2016, guiding Norway to the quarter-finals at the World Cup three years ago, where they were beaten 3-0 by England. That came after a more disappointing Euro 2017 campaign, however, where they went out in the group stages after losing all three games.\n\nThe big win for Sjogren is that he now once again has Ada Hegerberg available in his squad. She has been absent for the majority of his tenure, having quit the side in 2017 due to the federation’s treatment of the women’s team.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nCaroline Graham Hansen - The forward bagged 10 goals as Norway topped their qualification group with ease. As one of many Barcelona players at the tournament this summer, Hansen is widely regarded as one of the best players in women's football.\n\nThe 27-year-old is known for her remarkable dribbling ability; no one completed more dribbles than her at the 2019 World Cup, despite Norway bowing out at the quarter-final stage. But it's also her consistency in front of goal that makes Hansen so important to Norway.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nNorway, an ever-present in the Women's Euros, qualified for a joint-record 12th tournament by winning all six games in Group C. They scored 34 goals and conceded just the one.\n\nThey have won the competition twice in their history, in 1987 and 1993, also reaching the final in 2005 and 2013.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 3/5\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nKenny Shiels - In the role since 2019, having succeeded previous coach Alfie Wylie. The 66-year-old had previously led Kilmarnock and Derry City's men's teams, and has proven his worth since taking the job, guiding Northern Ireland to a first-ever qualification for a major tournament.\n\nShiels was heavily criticised in April after stating 'women are more emotional than men' following a heavy defeat by England. He kept his job after apologising, however, with captain Marissa Callaghan publicly backing the manager.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nRachel Furness - Not a difficult choice, this one. The 33-year-old - who could well be facing her one and only opportunity to play in the Euros - is Northern Ireland's top scorer in history (men or women), and also, unsurprisingly, their top scorer throughout qualifying with five goals.\n\nShe scored a crucial goal in their play-off first leg against Ukraine, but was made to watch from the sidelines for the second leg after breaking her ankle. Furness more recently played a pivotal role as her club side Liverpool earned promotion back to the WSL this season.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nNorthern Ireland secured an historic first-ever European Championship qualification after beating Ukraine 4-1 on aggregate in their two-legged play-off clash against Ukraine last year. That came after they finished second, behind Norway, in their qualifying group.\n\nIn reaching the tournament, Northern Ireland became the lowest ranked team (43rd) in history to qualify for the Women's Euros. It was a remarkable feat for a side who lost seven of their eight 2019 World Cup qualifiers.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 1/5\n\nGroup B: Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland\n\nGermany\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nMartina Voss-Tecklenburg - Given the role in 2018, after Germany's run of six successive Euro wins came to a rather abrupt end the year before. The 54-year-old, who had managed Switzerland for the previous six years, guided Germany to a World Cup quarter-final finish the following year.\n\nMartina Voss-Tecklenburg knows exactly what it takes to win tournament football with Germany, having claimed the Euros title four times during her time as a player.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nLea Schuller - The forward, who has been compared to Marco Reus, comes into the tournament as Germany's in-form star, having recently been named the nation's Player of the Year. The 24-year-old scored 11 goals is as many appearances for Germany last year, also notching 17 for club side Bayern Munich.\n\nShe has also been prolific throughout World Cup qualifying, scoring 11 goals in just seven outings. Schuller will no doubt harness aspirations of claiming the Golden Boot award.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nAfter their shock early exit at Euro 2017, alongside a quarter-final defeat at the 2019 World Cup, Germany comfortably qualified for the impending tournament as Group I winners. They won all eight games, scoring 46 goals and conceding one. Klara Buhl was their most potent goalscorer throughout qualifying with six strikes.\n\nGermany have largely dominated women's football in recent history. They won six consecutive Euro titles between 1995 and 2013, with eight titles to their name. They'll be hoping to return to top form next month.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 4/5\n\nDenmark\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nLars Sondergaard - The 63-year-old has been in charge of Denmark since 2017, having previously managed in the Danish 1st Division for numerous men's teams. There is an expectation for Denmark to perform under Sondergaard, particularly after his predecessor, Nils Nielsen, guided them to the Euro finals.\n\nDenmark failed to qualify for the 2019 World Cup, however, having been defeated by Holland in a two-legged play-off clash. They are going strong in their current qualifying campaign, though, 11 points ahead of their closest rivals Bosnia and Herzegovina with seven wins from as many games.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nPernille Harder - No doubts about it, Harder is by a way Denmark's most important player going into the tournament. She has been a central figure in the Danish side since 2009, when she scored a hat-trick on her debut, and now stands as her nation's top scorer.\n\nHarder, who plays her club football for Chelsea, was Denmark's joint-top scorer throughout qualification, alongside Nadia Nadim, on eight goals. Known as one of the greatest of all time, Harder won the UEFA Women’s Player of the Year in 2018 and 2020 and has been named Danish Player of the Year award a record seven times.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nDenmark, who finished as runners-up at the previous tournament in 2017, qualified for the impending tournament without trouble. They won nine of their 10 games, drawing the other, conceding just one goal and scoring 48.\n\nAs Euro regulars, they reached the final for the first time four years ago, where they were beaten by Holland. They'll be looking to go one step further, but even getting through Group B will be no easy feat. A potential quarter-final against England could await if they do.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 3/5\n\nSpain\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nJorge Vilda - The long-serving 40-year-old has been in the job since 2015, with the side vastly improving under his guidance. Spain are yet to win an international trophy, however, and that will now be the target.\n\nVilda has been in the national frame since 2009, when he became the assistant manager for Spain's U19 Women's team. Since then, he's managed both the U17 and U19 sides.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nAlexia Putellas - The Barcelona star, though not an out-and-out striker, occupying the No 10 position, is a serious goal threat and contender for the Golden Boot award. She scored 17 goals in 19 outings in the 2021-22 campaign and was named Ballon d'Or winner for her impressive performances.\n\nShe has just one international tournament goal to her name, though, coming back in 2013. It was Jenni Hermoso - the Ballon d'Or runner-up - who topped Spain's scoring charts throughout qualifying with 10 goals.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nSpain were untroubled throughout qualifying, winning seven of their eight fixtures and drawing the other. They scored an impressive 48 goals, conceding just the one.\n\nThe Spaniards have certainly underperformed throughout their history, with their best Euro result coming all the way back in 1997, when they reached the semi-finals. They are the bookies' favourites to claim the prestigious prize this summer, however.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 5/5\n\nFinland\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nAnna Signeul - In charge of Finland is veteran coach Signeul, 61, who managed Scotland between 2005 and 2017. She took the Scots to their first-ever European Championships in 2017, where they claimed a shock win over Spain in the group stages. The victory wasn't enough to see them qualify for the knockouts, however.\n\nSigneul will be concerned by her side's form coming into the tournament, with damaging results now seeing them in the mix for a play-off place at best in World Cup qualifying.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nLinda Sallstrom - The 33-year-old will be key in Finland's attempt to go deep into the tournament. She is their all-time top scorer, and notched almost half of her nation's qualifying goals (24) with 10.\n\nSallstrom has been hampered by injuries throughout her career and last competed in the tournament back in 2009. She'll be desperate to be among the top scorers, but making it out of the groups will be a tall order.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nFinland were economical throughout their qualification process as they topped Group E with seven wins and a draw, narrowly seeing off the competition from Portugal, who were later given a spot at the tournament in place of Russia.\n\nThey scored the fewest goals of any of the group winners with just 24, while conceding two in return. Having missed out on qualification for the 2017 tournament, they will be looking the make an impression in England.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 1/5\n\nGroup C: Holland, Sweden, Portugal, Switzerland\n\nHolland\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nMark Parsons - With Wiegman leaving Holland for England, Englishman Mark Parsons was drafted in as the replacement. Despite being just 35 years old, Parsons has had numerous managerial roles in women's football, including Chelsea reserves, Washington Spirit, and a particularly successful five-year stint at Portland Thorns.\n\nWiegman's brilliant tenure will be a hard act to follow, in what is undoubtedly the most high-profile job of Parsons' career to date. The impending tournament is a great opportunity to lay down a marker, though.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nVivianne Miedema - There is no question here. Miedema is one of the best players in women's football, both at a club and international level. She was instrumental in Holland's 2017 Euro victory, scoring four goals during the knockout stages, including two in their 4-2 triumph over Denmark in the final.\n\nDespite being only 25, Miedema is already her country's all-time top scorer, and was phenomenal both at the 2019 World Cup and at the Tokyo Olympics, where she set a new record after scoring eight goals in the group stages alone.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nHolland, who are among the favourites to win the tournament, having done so last time out in 2017, qualified for this summer's tournament without trouble. They topped Group A with 10 wins from as many games, scoring 48 goals throughout and conceding just three.\n\nSherida Spitse was among the star players for Holland throughout, scoring a whopping 10 goals. Their 2017 triumph was the first time they had reached a major final, which they then repeated at the World Cup two years later, though then losing out to USA.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 5/5\n\nSweden\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nPeter Gerhardsson - Took over in 2017 following a seven-year spell at men's side Hacken. He's certainly got Sweden playing some good football, having claimed third place at the 2019 World Cup, and second place at the 2020 Olympics last year.\n\nThe 62-year-old, who has nearly three decades of managerial experience in his locker, will fancy his chances of guiding the side to the knockout stages at least. With three runners-up finishes since 1984, however, going one step further will ultimately be the goal.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nCaroline Seger - A more difficult choice than many other teams, but perhaps it's only right it goes to Seger, who, at 37, is most likely heading into her final European Championships.\n\nSeger first played for Sweden back in 2005 and has since represented her country at 12 major tournaments. The midfielder has claimed two third-placed World Cup finishes and as many Olympic silver medals.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nSweden won seven of their eight games throughout qualifying to book a spot at the summer tournament, conceding just two goals while scoring 40. They reached the quarter-finals in 2017, having won the tournament in 1984; they come into the tournament as one of the dark horses.\n\nIt was Anna Anvegard who scored the most goals (5) as they strolled to Group E victory, and the Swedes have also proven a strong force in World Cup qualifying, having already confirmed their status as Group A winners.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 3/5\n\nPortugal\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nFrancisco Neto - The 40-year-old was appointed as Portugal manager back in 2014, in what has since proven to be an astute choice. His side had never previously qualified for a major tournament, but now come into their second Euros on the spin. There was a slice of fortune, though, which we'll get onto shortly.\n\nNeto's side could also qualify for a first-ever World Cup, with Portugal sat two points behind Serbia with two games to play in the battle for a play-off spot.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nDiana Silva - Again, not the easiest choice of the bunch, but Silva probably just about pips captain Ana Borges to the award. In a team that don't score too many goals - only 10 in their eight qualifying campaign - the tricky winger will be an essential outlet throughout.\n\nThe attacker is once again back at Sporting CP after a spell at Aston Villa last season and has also played for Atletico Ouriens and Clube de Albergaria. She was one of Portugal's best players in the 2017 competition, but was unable to help them get out of the groups.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nPortugal weren't initially set to compete in the upcoming tournament, having been beaten by Russia over a two-legged play-off after finishing behind Finland in Group B.\n\nRussia were removed from the tournament following Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, however, with Portugal replacing them and slotting into Group C.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 1/5\n\nSwitzerland\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nNils Nielsen - Took over in 2018, having enjoyed a highly successful spell managing Denmark Women, where he guided them to the final of the 2017 tournament, though eventually losing to Holland. He was named runner-up for the 2017 The Best FIFA Women's Coach award as a result.\n\nNielsen didn't get off to the best start with Switzerland, however, having failed to qualify for the 2019 World Cup. They also face a battle to qualify for the 2023 edition, currently sat behind Italy.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nAna-Maria Crnogorcevic - One of a number of players who play their club football for Barcelona, Crnogorcevic also comes into the tournament in top form. The versatile 31-year-old - who has been a central figure in the Switzerland team for numerous years - can play in numerous positions, both in defence and in attack.\n\nCrnogorcevic was Switzerland's top scorer throughout qualifying with six goals, and she scored the decisive penalty as they beat Czech Republic in the play-offs.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nSwitzerland were made to come through the play-offs, having finished behind Belgium in their qualifying campaign. They won six of their eight games, alongside a draw and a loss, but it wasn't enough to earn automatic qualification.\n\nInstead, they were paired against Czech Republic in a two-legged play-off. Both matches finished 1-1, with penalties required to separate the teams. It was Switzerland who took the shootout 3-2 and booked a spot in England this summer.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 2/5\n\nGroup D: France, Italy, Belgium, Iceland\n\nFrance\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nCorinne Diacre - Given the job in 2017 after yet another Euro quarter-final exit, the 47-year-old is expected to get to the last four at the very least this summer - particularly after bowing out at the same stage at the 2019 World Cup.\n\nDiacre, who captained France for much of her time as a player, certainly divides opinion, with many believing she's not the right person for the job. Much of that comes down to her sometimes bizarre selection choices, with neither Amandine Henry or Eugenie Le Sommer making the squad.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nWendie Renard and Marie-Antoinette Katoto - This was a really tough choice, and in the end they can't be separated. Renard, France's captain, is an integral component of the nation's strong defence and will be key this summer. She's made a staggering 126 appearances for Les Bleus.\n\nKatoto, on the other hand, will be key for France from an attacking standpoint. She was their top scorer throughout qualifying with eight goals, and will be looking to prove a point having been left out of the 2017 squad. The 23-year-old shattered PSG's goal-scoring record last season and comes into the tournament in good form.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nFrance were ruthless in qualifying for the European Championships, scoring 44 goals and conceding none as they won seven of their eight qualifying games, drawing the other.\n\nThey are among the favourites to win the tournament, though the absence of Lyon's Henry - who Diacre has not picked since 2020 - could perhaps be a damaging choice. They have bowed out at the quarter-final stage in 2009, 2013 and 2017; they'll want to break that run this summer.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 5/5\n\nItaly\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nMilena Bertolini - With extensive experience both as a player and a manager, Bertolini is one of the most respected figures in the game. She became manager in 2017, following a successful five-year spell with Brescia.\n\nItaly qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 20 years under Bertolini, and they made it to the quarter-finals, where they were beaten by eventual winners Holland.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nCristiana Girelli - There are a few players you could pick for this position, with Barbara Bonansea perhaps the other outstanding candidate. But after her qualifying campaign - where she scored nine goals - the title goes to Girelli.\n\nThe 32-year-old plays for Juventus and last year became the club's first player to reach 50 goals. She was also named 2020 Serie A Female Footballer of the Year last year. She's utterly prolific for club and country and will certainly be in with a shout in the Golden Boot race.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nItaly finished second, behind Denmark, in their Euro 2022 qualification group, but qualified automatically - without the need of a play-off - having amounted an impressive 25 points. They won eight games of 10 throughout the campaign, alongside a draw and a loss.\n\nItaly have finished runners-up twice in the tournament's history, in 1993 and 1997, and will be looking to go one better this time. They are going strong in their World Cup 2023 qualifying campaign, currently sat in top spot. They reached the quarter-final stage at the 2019 World Cup, but going beyond that this summer seems a tall order.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 2/5\n\nBelgium\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nIves Serneels - The long-serving manager has been in charge of Belgium since 2011, and has since developed his side into a competitive force. They missed out on a place for the 2019 World Cup, but only just, having lost in the play-offs to Switzerland. Otherwise, back-to-back Euro qualifications is some feat for the 49-year-old.\n\nThe 'Red Flames' find themselves in a thoroughly competitive Group D, however, and progressing beyond the group stages for the first time in their history won't be easy.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nJanice Cayman - It's difficult to look beyond Cayman, being Belgium's most capped player. The 33-year-old featured in all eight of Belgium's qualifying fixtures, and as a Champions League winner with Lyon brings some elite-level experience to the team.\n\nHowever, another name to look out for is Tine De Caigny, who finished as the top scorer throughout qualifying with a stunning 12 goals. Big things are expected of the 25-year-old this summer.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nBelgium qualified for the tournament in style, seeing off fierce competition from Switzerland to top a competitive Group H. They won seven of eight games, losing just one, scoring 37 goals and conceding just five.\n\nThey had never qualified for the tournament before 2017, and though claiming a memorable win over Norway, their two losses from three games ensured they failed to make the knockouts. Belgium missed out on a place at the 2019 World Cup, but qualifying for a second European Championship on the bounce is certainly an achievement.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 2/5\n\nIceland\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nThorsteinn Halldorsson - A highly-respected coach with experience in both men's and women's football. Though appointed only last year, he has already stamped his authority on the team, with Iceland currently sat above Norway in World Cup qualifying.\n\nFrance are undoubtedly the favourites to reach the knockouts as Group D winners, but Halldorsson - with his Iceland team in great form going into the tournament - will certainly fancy a runner-up spot.\n\nWho is the star player?\n\nSara Bjork Gunnarsdottir - Captain and leader, the 31-year-old will be crucial if Iceland are to get out of a tricky group next month. Being named Icelandic sportsperson of the year in 2018 and 2020 only underlines her importance to the team.\n\nGunnarsdottir is now back in the picture after having a baby last November, having left for maternity leave earlier in May 2021. It will be a special occasion for the nation's most-capped player, though she has been critical of the inclusion of the 4,700-seater Manchester City Academy Stadium, where Iceland will play two of three group games.\n\nHow did they qualify?\n\nIceland qualified as one of three best runners-up, having finished behind Sweden in Group F. They won six of eight games, losing one and drawing the other. They scored 25 goals throughout, while conceding five. They first qualified for the competition in 2009 and haven't missed out since, even reaching the quarter-finals in 2013.\n\nIt was Elin Metta Jensen who impressed throughout qualifying, scoring an impressive six goals despite Iceland not boasting one of the best attacking records across the campaign.\n\nChance of winning the trophy - 2/5"
