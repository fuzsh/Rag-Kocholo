        "text": "Goals from Lieke Martens, Sherida Spitse and Vivianne Miedema (2) led to the Netherlands becoming the fourth winner of the women's European Championship tournament after Germany, eight times champion, Norway (2) and Sweden.\n\nThe hosts, led by Sarina Wiegman, played offensive football throughout the competition and on Sunday, they broke the German hegemony in the competition - (won consecutively between 1995 and 2013).\n\nDenmark's Nadia Nadim was one of the best players on the pitch and it was she who opened the scoring in the 6th minute.\n\nDespite her father having been executed by the Taliban, Nadim has channeled all of her energy into football and the opening goal stunned the partisan home crowd.\n\nHowever, Vivianne Miedema and Lieke Martens, Barcelona's new signing, put Holland into the lead before the Danish captain Pernille Harder brought it back to 2-2 in the 33rd minute.\n\nA third from Spitse allowed the Dutch to tighten their grip in the second half and then Miedema added the gloss to a magnificent performance in the 89th minute.\n\n- Match details:\n\n4 - Holland: Van Veenendaal; Van Lunteren (Janssen, min. 57), Dekker, Van der Gragt, Van Es (Van der Berg, min. 90+4); Van de Donk, Groenen, Spitse; Van der Sanden (Jansen, min. 90), Martens and Miedema.\n\n2 - Denmark: Petersen; Nielsen, Boye Sorensen (Roddik, min. 77), Larsen, Sandvej; Troelsgaard, Kildemoes (Thogersen, min. 61), Junge Pedersen (Christiansen, min. 82), Veje; Harder and Nadim.\n\nGoles: 0-1, min. 6, Nadim; 1-1, min. 10, Miedema; 2-1, min. 28, Martens; 2-2, min. 33, Harder; 3-2, min. 51, Spitse; 4-2, min. 89, Miedema."
