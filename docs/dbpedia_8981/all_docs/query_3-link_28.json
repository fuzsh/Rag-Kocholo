        "text": "Germany's impressive progress through the group stage at football's UEFA Women's Euro 2022 has confirmed their status as one of the favourites for the title.\n\nThey've been perfect. Three wins from three matches, and no goals conceded.\n\nOne of the key performers so far has been full-back Giulia Gwinn, who again impressed at times in the 3-0 win over Finland on Saturday (17 July).\n\nCould the 23-year-old could influence them to their first women's European Championship title since 2013?\n\nGiulia Gwinn: Leader of the next-gen\n\nWhen she was 19, Giulia Gwinn travelled to France to represent Germany at the 2019 Women’s World Cup.\n\nDespite making just eight appearances before then, she delivered standout performances to earn the Young Player of the Tournament award.\n\nGwinn described it as: \"something out of a movie’’.\n\nSince then, she has gone from strength to strength and has proven her importance across the 2022 Euros group stages.\n\nBut her journey to prominence hasn’t been all plain-sailing.\n\nIn 2020, the 23-year-old suffered an ACL knee injury that left her sidelined for over a year.\n\nAnd in late 2021, after almost 400 days out, she finally made her return to the national team.\n\nGwinn has established herself as one of the first names on the team sheet for her country and her club Bayern Munich.\n\nAlthough she is not always deployed at her favoured wing position by Germany, but rather at right-back, she has been influential across the Euros so far.\n\nAs a playmaker, Gwinn is dangerous on the ball, her speed in particular helping her team get up the pitch.\n\nShe possesses a certain efficiency in her game that makes her so key for Germany – her tenacity off the ball in particular helps her side recover possession with speed.\n\nIn the 2-0 win over Spain on matchday two, Gwinn put in a Player of the Match performance.\n\nDespite playing further up the flank on occasions, she has transformed herself into a modern full-back that is able to dictate the outcome of a game.\n\nShe followed it up with 45 solid minutes in the final group game against Finland, her cross providing the assist for the opening goal.\n\nOne of 11 players in the German squad that are aged 25 or under, she is part of the new crop of stars aiming to restore the legacy that was built before them.\n\nGermany came into the tournament as quiet favourites given their history, but Gwinn is proving ready to lead the trophy charge.\n\nCan Germany’s dominance be restored?\n\nBefore the days of Gwinn, there was an era of German dominance that spanned decades.\n\nThey are the most successful national team in the history of the women’s European Championships with eight titles.\n\nSince 1989, the Germans have won all but two editions of the tournament - winning six back-to-back between 1995 and 2013.\n\nBut after crashing out to eventual finalists Denmark in the last eight in 2017, things started to spiral for them.\n\nGermany would go on to fall at the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 2019, subsequently failing to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics despite having won gold five years prior.\n\nTheir break from dominating trophies has been short thus far, and their current squad is suggesting that they won’t be away from success forever.\n\nNext up at the women’s Euro 2022: Germany's last eight opponents\n\nAfter finishing top of their group, Germany will play the runners-up of group A: Austria.\n\nThe Austrians handed a heavy defeat to Norway to knock them out of the competition on 15 July.\n\nSemi-finalists in 2017, this time Austria were not tipped to make it out of a group that contained both England and Norway.\n\nBut they have been resilient and stubborn opponents, and will not hesitate to take the game to Germany.\n\nThe Germans, however, have been one of the most impressive teams at the Euros so far.\n\nNo goals conceded, nine goals scored and 100% win record - they have well and truly proven why they are among the favourites to go all the way.\n\nTheir quarter-final tie will take place on Thursday 21 July, with kick-off at 20:00 BST (19:00 GMT/UTC) at the Brentford Community Stadium in London, England."
