It’s the moment when a dream you have comes true.”\n\n“But I must say that it’s also a moment where I feel responsibility, because I’ll be refereeing an important football game.”\n\nThe call to tell her loved ones back in Ukraine about her selection for the final was a moment of immense joy and pride. “When I heard their happy and positive response,” Monzul recalls, “I realised how important it was for them as well as for myself.”\n\nas.com\n\nGermany XI confirmed\n\nThe German side is named with all eyes on Alexandra Popp, Germany's main danger outlet and scorer of six goals during the tournament so far.

In fact, only Germany in 2009 have ever scored more at a Women’s Euros (21).\n\nMead’s goal in the opening 1-0 win against Austria at Old Trafford was vital for getting their campaign rolling, before she grabbed a hat-trick in the 8-0 thrashing of Norway, another in the 5-0 win against Northern Ireland, and the opener in the 4-0 semi-final humbling of Sweden.\n\nWhile Germany have not been quite as proficient – still scoring a respectable 13 goals – Popp’s contributions had initially come when adding to leads, with the captain’s goals against Denmark, Spain, Finland and Austria all arriving when her team were already ahead.\n\nHowever, she came into her own in the last-four clash with France, scoring both goals in the 2-1 win, including a dominant header to win it with 14 minutes remaining.\n\nas.com\n\nThe action from a sell-out Wembley Stadium gets underway at 17:00 (local time) or 12:00 pm (ET) / 9:00 am (PT).\n\nas.com\n\nHello and welcome to our live coverage of the final game of the 2022 European Championship as host nation England face eight-time-winners in Germany.\n\nas.com"
