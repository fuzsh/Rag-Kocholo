        "text": "The 2024 European Championship takes place in Germany between June 14 and July 14.\n\nThe qualifiers started in March and conclude in November before March’s play-offs to determine the final 24 competing teams.\n\nThere was record ticket demand for Euro 2020, with the tournament attracting 28.3million ticket requests, and next summer’s tournament has proved to be similarly popular.\n\nThis is not without its controversy, with supporter disappointment at missing out on tickets during the first round of balloting compounded by tickets then swiftly appearing on resale sites for substantially inflated prices.\n\nThe Athletic has the lowdown on the Euro 2024 ticketing situation.\n\nWhen Euro 2024 tickets go on sale and how to buy them\n\nOver 1.2million tickets were made available in the first round of Euro 2024 ticket applications, which ran from October 3 to October 26 2023. Tickets were allocated via a UEFA portal lottery process. Applicants could apply for a maximum of four tickets per match and individuals were not awarded tickets for different matches scheduled for the same day. Applicants applied for a total average of 13 tickets. Successful applicants were informed on November 14.\n\nThose who were unsuccessful in their applications in the initial draw have been automatically entered in UEFA’s “Fans First” programme and will be alerted to new ticket availability from the first lottery phase.\n\nThe second ticket ballot will open after the tournament draw on December 2 2023. One million tickets will be available to supporters from the 21 qualified nations. Supporters will apply for tickets via their national association before making their purchase through UEFA’s website. These will typically be allocated to members of national associations’ supporter groups and be distributed using a loyalty points based system.\n\nDetails of where to apply via each national association can be found at https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/ticketing/\n\nTickets will also be held back for supporters of the three nations that qualify through the Euro 2024 play-offs — three from Poland, Estonia, Wales, Finland, Israel, Iceland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Georgia, Luxembourg, Greece and Kazakhstan. The play-offs take place on March 21 and March 26 2024.\n\nUEFA will open a ticket resale platform in spring 2024. This will enable fans to purchase unwanted tickets at resale value and is part of UEFA’s attempts to combat fraudulent ticket sales.\n\nIs the process different to previous tournaments?\n\nAt previous tournaments, supporters would register for tickets directly via UEFA’s website, even after the group stage draw. The allocation process was still conducted in collaboration with national associations.\n\nSupporters applying for Euro 2024 tickets via the second ticket ballot, which takes place after the group stage draw, instead register through their national association.\n\nHow much do Euro 2024 tickets cost?\n\nThe cheapest tickets available for Euro 2024 are €30 (£26.24, $32.63) for the lowest category pricing of group stage fixtures. A total of 270,000 tickets are priced at €30.\n\nAll group stage tickets range from €30 to €200 (£174.91, $217) apart from the opening game at Bayern Munich’s Munich Football Arena, where tickets range from €50 (£42.73, $54.39) to €600 (£524.79, $652.64).\n\nTickets for the knockout stages range from €50 for the cheapest round of 16 fixture to €600 for the most expensive category 1 semi-final ticket.\n\nPrices for the final, which takes place at Berlin’s Olympiastadion, range from €90 (£78.71, $97.90) to €1,000 (£874.58, $1,087.73).\n\nHave there been any problems?\n\nGiven demand, a number of supporters missed out on tickets in the initial ballot. UEFA confirmed it received over 20million “genuine” ticket requests for the first round of sales, where over 1.2million tickets were made available. Over 2.2million tickets were requested for the final — 33 times the size of the Olympiastadion’s 74,000 capacity.\n\nTickets have since appeared on resale websites for heavily inflated prices. One platform claimed to have 20 tickets for the final priced at £43,500-per-ticket — 49 times their face value. The resale or advertisement of resale of tickets is strictly prohibited by UEFA.\n\nUEFA did identify bots during the ticketing request process but claim to have taken them out of the lottery. The use of bots, or any computer software to increase a user’s chance of their application being successful, is a breach of UEFA’s ticketing terms and conditions.\n\nWhat are the fixtures?\n\nGroup stage\n\nFriday, June 14\n\nGermany vs Scotland (Munich, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nSaturday, June 15\n\nHungary vs Switzerland (Cologne, 3pm CEST, 2pm BST, 9am ET)\n\nSpain vs Croatia (Berlin, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nItaly vs Albania (Dortmund, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nSunday, June 16\n\nPlay-off Winner A vs Netherlands (Hamburg, 3pm CEST, 2pm BST, 9am ET)\n\nSlovenia vs Denmark (Stuttgart, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nSerbia vs England (Gelsenkirchen, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nMonday, June 17\n\nRomania vs Play-off Winner B (Munich, 3pm CEST, 2pm BST, 9am ET)\n\nBelgium vs Slovakia (Frankfurt, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nAustria vs France (Dusseldorf, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET))\n\nTuesday, June 18\n\nTurkey vs Play-off Winner C (Dortmund, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nPortugal vs Czech Republic (Leipzig, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nWednesday, June 19\n\nCroatia vs Albania (Hamburg, 3pm CEST, 2pm BST, 9am ET)\n\nGermany vs Hungary (Stuttgart, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nScotland vs Switzerland (Cologne, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nThursday, June 20\n\nSlovenia vs Serbia (Munich, 3pm CEST, 2pm BST, 9am ET)\n\nDenmark vs England (Frankfurt, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nSpain vs Italy (Gelsenkirchen, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nFriday, June 21\n\nSlovakia vs Play-off Winner B (Dusseldorf, 3pm CEST, 2pm BST, 9am ET)\n\nPlay-off Winner A vs Austria (Berlin, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nNetherlands vs France (Leipzig, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nSaturday, June 22\n\nPlay-off Winner C vs Czech Republic (Hamburg, 3pm CEST, 2pm BST, 9am ET)\n\nTurkey vs Portugal (Dortmund, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nBelgium vs Romania (Cologne, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nSunday, June 23\n\nSwitzerland vs Germany (Frankfurt, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nScotland vs Hungary (Stuttgart, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nMonday, June 24\n\nCroatia vs Italy (Leipzig, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nAlbania vs Spain (Dusseldorf, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nTuesday, June 25\n\nNetherlands vs Austria (Berlin, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nFrance vs Play-off Winner A (Dortmund, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nEngland vs Slovenia (Cologne, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nDenmark vs Serbia (Munich, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nWednesday, June 26\n\nSlovakia vs Romania (Frankfurt, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nPlay-off Winner B vs Belgium (Stuttgart, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nCzech Republic vs Turkey (Hamburg, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nPlay-off Winner C vs Portugal (Gelsenkirchen, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nRound of 16\n\nSaturday, June 29\n\nMatch 38 2A vs 2B (Berlin, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nMatch 37 1A vs 2C (Dortmund, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nSunday, June 30\n\nMatch 40 1C vs 3D/E/F (Gelsenkirchen, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nMatch 39 1B vs 3A/D/E/F (Cologne, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nMonday, July 1\n\nMatch 42 2D vs 2E (Dusseldorf, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nMatch 41 1F vs 3A/B/C (Frankfurt, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nTuesday, July 2\n\nMatch 43 1E vs 3A/B/C/D (Munich, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nMatch 44 1D vs 2F (Leipzig, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nQuarter-finals\n\nFriday, July 5\n\nMatch 45 W39 vs W37 (Stuttgart, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nMatch 46 W41 vs W42 (Hamburg, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nSaturday, 6 July\n\nMatch 48 W40 vs W38 (Dusseldorf, 6pm CEST, 5pm BST, 12pm ET)\n\nMatch 47 W43 vs W44 (Berlin, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nSemi-finals\n\nTuesday, July 9\n\nMatch 49 W45 vs W46 (Munich, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nWednesday, July 10\n\nMatch 50 W47 vs W48 (Dortmund, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\nFinal\n\nSunday, July 14\n\nMatch 51 W49 vs W50 (Berlin, 9pm CEST, 8pm BST, 3pm ET)\n\n(Photo: Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)"
