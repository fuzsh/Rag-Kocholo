        "text": "Surely we can all hear the hums of Sweet Caroline in the distance – along with faint whispers of ‘football’s coming home’.\n\nIt’s hard for England fans not to get excited, as the team are in the final of the Women’s Euros 2022.\n\nThe Lionesses have captured the country’s imagination with a stellar run throughout the UEFA tournament, capped off by beating Sweden 4-0 in the semi finals.\n\nBut has England’s women’s squad ever won the Euros before – and what are their chances this year?\n\nHere is everything you need to know before kick off.\n\nHas England ever won the Women’s Euros?\n\nEngland women’s team have been to the Euros eight times and have reached the final twice.\n\nHowever, they’ve yet to win and lift that coveted trophy.\n\nFor what it’s worth, England’s men’s team have also never won the Euros – with the side enduring an unforgettable and heartbreaking defeat in last year’s final against Italy.\n\nBut the women’s team has come staggeringly close to winning the competition several times, including in its very first year (1984) where they came second to Sweden on penalties.\n\nThe team also managed to reach the semi-finals in 1995, coming second once again in 2009, and then got to the semi-finals in the previous tournament in 2017.\n\nEngland’s long-term football rivals Germany are by far the biggest winners overall, taking home the winning trophy in eight of the 13 competitions held since 1984.\n\nThey were, however, defeated 3-1 by England in a friendly earlier this year. Promising?\n\nCould England win this year?\n\nIt’s certainly possible – but, as always, anything can happen in football.\n\nBetfair value England as the 8/11 favourites to lift the trophy, while Germany are EVS to upset the home nation.\n\nMORE : Women’s Euros semi-final thrashes Wimbledon’s men’s final in ratings\n\nMORE : Geri Horner and lookalike daughter Bluebell, 16, wear matching smiles and England shirts as they cheer national team at Women’s Euros\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram"
