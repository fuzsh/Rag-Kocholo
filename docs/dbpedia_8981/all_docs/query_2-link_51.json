        "text": "The premier women’s soccer competition is the UEFA Women’s Euro. It involves the top national sides from across Europe as they battle for a few summertime weeks every four years to determine which captain will lift the trophy. And you don’t need cable to watch.\n\nIn a hurry? Any streaming service that offers the ESPN channels will provide good coverage of the UEFA Women’s Euro:\n\nThe UEFA Women’s Euro is an event that has been increasing in popularity at an impressive rate the last few decades. And its 2022 edition is expected to receive significant interest as well.\n\nIn the US, ESPN owns the broadcasting and streaming rights to this competition. In 2022, ESPN will showcase two matches, including the final. And 21 games will be featured on ESPN2, including the opener between England and Austria, which will be simulcast on ESPNU as well.\n\nMeanwhile, ESPN+ is the exclusive broadcaster for eight matches from the competition this year. To get access to every game of the competition, you are best to sign up with Hulu + Live TV, which includes all the ESPN channels as well as ESPN+ itself. But you could also get ESPN+ on its own and combine it with a live service like FuboTV.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nUEFA Women’s Championship\n\nThe UEFA Women’s Championship, the official name for this event, has been held since 1984. That year, four teams played in home-and-away semifinals and a final. It resulted in Sweden edging past England. Both sides won, 1-0, at home, and the Swedes took the penalty shootout that followed the second leg in Luton, England, by a 4-3 margin.\n\nHowever, only three other sides have claimed this competition’s trophy in the decades since. The Netherlands also won one (2017). Norway has secured this event’s top spot twice (1987 and 1993). But Germany has been the powerhouse country, having taken it down on eight occasions, including six straight times from 1995-2013. The first two occurred in 1989, as West Germany, and 1991, after that country unified.\n\nStructure\n\nAll of the UEFA countries that wish to enter a team in qualifying for the Women’s Euro may do so, and the majority of them do. For Women’s Euro 2022, 47 of UEFA’s 55 associations took part in the qualification process. They battled for 15 spots. England, the 48th, proceeded right to the competition as the host.\n\nAt the event itself, the 16 teams were divided into four four-team groups with the top two in each advancing to the knockout phase and, for the two most successful sides, playing in a quarterfinal, semifinal, and final.\n\n2022 UEFA Women’s Euro Schedule\n\nSchedule provides approximate times in EDT.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nGroup Stage\n\nWed Jul 6 2:00 pm: A — England (1) vs Austria (0) (ESPNU)\n\nThu Jul 7 2:00 pm: A — Norway (4) vs Northern Ireland (1) (ESPN2)\n\nFri Jul 8 11:00 am: B — Spain (4) vs Finland (1) (ESPN+)\n\nFri Jul 8 2:00 pm: B — Germany (4) vs Denmark (0) (ESPN2)\n\nSat Jul 9 11:00 am: C — Portugal (2) vs Switzerland (2) (ESPN+)\n\nSat Jul 9 2:00 pm: C — Netherlands (1) vs Sweden (1) (ESPN2)\n\nSun Jul 10 11:00 am: D — Belgium (1) vs Iceland (1) (ESPN2)\n\nSun Jul 10 2:00 pm: D — France (5) vs Italy (1) (ESPN+)\n\nMon Jul 11 11:00 am: A — Austria (2) vs Northern Ireland (0) (ESPN2)\n\nMon Jul 11 2:00 pm: A — England (8) vs Norway (0) (ESPN2)\n\nTue Jul 12 11:00 am: B — Denmark (1) vs Finland (0) (ESPN2)\n\nTue Jul 12 2:00 pm: B — Germany (2) vs Spain (0) (ESPN2)\n\nWed 13 Jul 11:00 am: C — Sweden (2) vs Switzerland (1) (ESPN2)\n\nWed 13 Jul 2:00 pm: C — Netherlands (3) vs Portugal (2) (ESPN2)\n\nThu 14 Jul 11:00 am: D — Italy (1) vs Iceland (1) (ESPN2)\n\nThu 14 Jul 2:00 pm: D — France (2) vs Belgium (1) (ESPN+)\n\nFri Jul 15 2:00 pm: A — Northern Ireland (0) vs England (5) (ESPN2)\n\nFri Jul 15 2:00 pm: A — Austria (1) vs Norway (0) (ESPN+)\n\nSat Jul 16 2:00 pm: B — Finland (0) vs Germany (3) (ESPN2)\n\nSat Jul 16 2:00 pm: B — Denmark (0) vs Spain (1) (ESPN+)\n\nSun Jul 17 11:00 am: C — Switzerland (1) vs Netherlands (4) (ESPN)\n\nSun Jul 17 11:00 am: C — Sweden (5) vs Portugal (0) (ESPN+)\n\nMon Jul 18 2:00 pm: D — Iceland (1) vs France (1) (ESPN2)\n\nMon Jul 18 2:00 pm: D — Italy (0) vs Belgium (1) (ESPN+)\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nWed Jul 20 2:00 pm: QF1 — England (2) vs Spain (1) (ESPN2)\n\nThu Jul 21 2:00 pm: QF2 — Germany (2) vs Austria (0) (ESPN2)\n\nFri Jul 22 2:00 pm: QF3 — Sweden (1) vs Belgium (0) (ESPN2)\n\nSat Jul 23 2:00 pm: QF4 — France (1) vs Netherlands (0) (ESPN2)\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nTue Jul 26 2:00 pm: SF1 — England (4) vs Sweden (0) (ESPN2/ESPN+)\n\nWed Jul 27 2:00 pm: SF2 — Germany (2) vs France (1) (ESPN2/ESPN+)\n\nFinal\n\nSun Jul 31 11:00 am: England (2) vs France (1)\n\nWatching UEFA Women’s Euro\n\nWatching UEFA Women’s Euro 2022 in the US can be done by securing access to a number of ESPN-related outlets.
