        "text": "The FA and UEFA have released the impact report for Women’s Euro 2022, which is set to be held in England this summer.\n\nAccording to the report, over 250 million viewers from 195 territories are expected to tune into live broadcasts of the tournament. This includes 52 countries across Europe, the USA, China, Latin America, Australia, India, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. The total live audience for the last Women’s Euro, held in the Netherlands in 2017, was 178 million.\n\nIn the UK, the BBC will be airing every game from the tournament, which runs 6-31 July, live across its platforms. This comes after the first season of the WSL’s first commercial rights deal with the free-to-air broadcaster, which was agreed in partnership with Sky Sports.\n\nIn addition to broadcast audiences, the impact report promises 96,000 international visitors from 95 territories to visit the host cities of Brighton & Hove, London, Manchester, Milton Keynes, Rotherham, Sheffield, Southampton, Trafford and Wigan & Leigh. This will help create £54 million in economic activity from the tournament.\n\nIt is also expected to double the 250,000 ticket sales that were acheived for the 2017 edition. You can read the full report here.\n\nBaroness Sue Campbell, Euro 2022 board member and director of women’s football, The FA, said: “With less than 50 days to go until the Tournament gets underway, this report highlights what we can achieve with a continued focus on capitalising on the opportunities offered by UEFA Women’s Euro England 2022 and importantly how we can measure our success.\n\nOur aim is twofold: to deliver a record-breaking tournament and to leave a tangible legacy to grow the women’s game. By inspiring fans at home and abroad, and by committing to provide playing opportunities to girls in every school and club across the country, I am confident we can deliver on both aims.”\n\nUEFA’s chief of women’s football Nadine Kessler added: “This pre-tournament report proves that the impact won’t stop with the final whistle at Wembley. UEFA Women’s Euro 2022 has a unique chance to be a catalyst for change locally, nationally, across Europe and beyond. The tournament and our collective ambition will positively impact local economies and tourism, people and communities and the global visibility of the women’s game, whilst providing valuable inspiration for the future.”"
