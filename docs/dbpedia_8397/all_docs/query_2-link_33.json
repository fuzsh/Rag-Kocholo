        "text": "In Hinduism\n\nPancaratra (worship of Nārāyaṇa)\n\nSource: Wisdom Library: Pancaratra (Samhita list)\n\nVarāhamihira (वराहमिहिर) is the name of an ancient Pāñcarātra Saṃhitā mentioned in the Padmasaṃhitā: the most widely followed of Saṃhitā covering the entire range of concerns of Pāñcarātra doctrine and practice (i.e., the four-fold formulation of subject matter—jñāna, yoga, kriyā and caryā) consisting of roughly 9000 verses.—[Cf. Jñānapāda chapter 1, verses 99-114]—First is explained the folly of following more than one Saṃhitā for a single series of rituals. Then the names of the 108 Tantras of the Pāñcarātra corpus are named [e.g., Varāhamihira]. Even those who repeat these 108 titles will gain salvation.\n\ncontext information\n\nPancaratra (पाञ्चरात्र, pāñcarātra) represents a tradition of Hinduism where Narayana is revered and worshipped. Closeley related to Vaishnavism, the Pancaratra literature includes various Agamas and tantras incorporating many Vaishnava philosophies.\n\nDiscover the meaning of varahamihira in the context of Pancaratra from relevant books on Exotic India\n\nIndia history and geography\n\nSource: Wisdom Library: Teachers, Saints and Sages\n\nVarāhamihira (वराहमिहिर) or Varahimigi refers to one of the Siddhars (Siddhas) and Rishis mentioned by Rangarasa Desiga Swamigal in his Siddhargal Potri Thoguppu. Each name in the list starts with prefix ‘Om’ followed by the Siddhar’s names and ends with refrain ‘Thiruvadigal Potri’. For example for Varāhamihira: ஓம் வராகிமிகி திருவடிகள் போற்றி [ōm varākimiki tiruvaṭikaḷ pōṟṟi].—These Siddhas experienced union with the ultimate reality and witnessed a spiritual transformation of their intellectual, mental, vital and ultimately, physical bodies.\n\nSource: academia.edu: The Date of Aryabhata\n\nVarahamihira (Saka 427 & Saka 509) [156-74 BCE].—Varahamihira mentions Aryabhata in his work “Panchasiddhantika”. Varahamihira records Saka 427 elapsed (156-155 BCE) as Karanabda for calculation of Ahargana (counting of days). Amaraja Daivajna, who wrote a commentary on “Khandakhadyaka” of Brahmagupta, mentions that Varahamihira died in Saka 509 (74 BCE). Considering the epoch of Saka era (583 BCE), Varahamihira undoubtedly lived between 156 BCE and 74 BCE.\n\nSource: Shodhganga: a concise history of Sanskrit Chanda literature (history)\n\nVarāhamihira (वराहमिहिर) (C. 550 C.E.), son of Ādityadāsa alias Rudrapaśu and resident of Avantī and father of Pṛthuyaśas (author of Ṣaṭpañcāśikā) is well known among scholars for his scholarship on Indian Astronomy and Mathematics. He has recorded the ancient Indian wisdom through his encyclopedic work Bṛhatsaṃhitā very crisply. The Bṛhatsaṃhitā incorporates many subjects of many disciplines and presents them in a unique way. The purpose of the author is to illustrate all branches of learning and thus names his work as Bṛhatsaṃhitā: a big collection. Out of chapters, the 104th Chapter deals with the metres of Sanskrit.\n\ncontext information\n\nThe history of India traces the identification of countries, villages, towns and other regions of India, as well as mythology, zoology, royal dynasties, rulers, tribes, local festivities and traditions and regional languages.
