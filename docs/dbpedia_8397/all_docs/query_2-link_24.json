        "text": "Varahamihira, also known as Varaha or Mihira, was born in Ujjain in 505 CE. It is situated in modern-day Madhya Pradesh. He was a philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician from India who wrote the Pancha-siddhantika.\n\nNew Delhi: Varahamihira, an Indian astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer from Ujjain, wrote in his book published 1500 years ago so many ideas about space and the cosmos that have startled scientists today. He explained why Mars had water and why planets and moons have light. He was the first to notice and explain how the Sun produced and centred each planet in the solar system.\n\nVarahamihira, who was he?\n\nVarahamihira, also known as Varaha or Mihira, was born in Ujjain in 505 CE. It is situated in modern-day Madhya Pradesh. He was a philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician from India who wrote the Pancha-siddhantika (“Five Treatises”), a collection of Greek, Egyptian, Roman, and Indian astronomy, according to Britannica.\n\nAlso read:\n\nNIA arrests 19-year-old Aligarh Muslim University student for links with ISIS\n\nAlso read:\n\nWho is Travis King? All you need to know about US soldier who crossed into North Korea\n\nVarahamihira was well-versed in Western astronomy. His massive book advances through native Indian astronomy in five sections and concludes in two treatises on Western astronomy, displaying calculations based on Greek and Alexandrian reckoning and even providing entire Ptolemaic mathematical charts and tables. His main interest, though, was astrology. He emphasised its significance constantly and penned several treatises on shakuna (“augury”), as well as the Brihaj-jataka (“Great Birth”) and the Laghu-jataka (“Short Birth”), two works on horoscope casting.\n\nSo, what did he have to say about Mars and the moon?\n\nPanchasiddhantika (The Five Astronomical Canons), written in 575 CE, is one of his most famous works.\n\nSurya Siddhanta, an astronomical book that describes or determines the real movements of the luminaries, is included in Panchasiddhantika. Varhamihira has also described the estimated diameters of planets such as Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter in this study.\n\nSurya Siddhanta also does calculations on and regarding solar and lunar eclipses, including their colour and part. Aside from the projected diameter of 3,772 miles (which is within 11% of the generally recognised diameter of 4,218 miles), Varhamihira also predicted the presence of water on Mars.\n\nHe said that the planet Mars contains both water and iron on its surface, both of which have been confirmed by NASA and ISRO. NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover collided with an iron meteorite named ‘Lebanon’ on May 25, 2014. However, later, NASA clarified that presence of water could have been confused with the flow of sand. But, again, an independent study proved the presence of water.\n\nAlthough not absolutely certain, NASA, ISRO, and the scientific community have discovered compelling evidence that water may exist on Mars. The research was carried out by a group of foreign scientists. The findings, which was published in the journal Nature Astronomy in October 2022, present the first independent line of evidence that liquid water exists beneath Mars’ south pole using data other than radar."
