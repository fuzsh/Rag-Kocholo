        "text": "Hailing from the Avanti region, Varahamihira was born around 500 CE into a family of astronomers, with his father known as Adityadasa. This Hindu polymath earned a place among the esteemed “Nine Jewels” in the court of Yashodharam Vikramaditya of Malwa, a prominent figure in 6th-century central India. Varahamihira’s roots were firmly entrenched in Ujjain, a city that thrived as a hub of knowledge during the Gupta Period (320 to 550 AD). Ujjain was renowned for nurturing various schools of science, culture, and art, making it an intellectual epicenter of its time.\n\nVarahamihira, also referred to as Varaha and Mihira, stood out as a luminary whose brilliance surpassed even his contemporaries, including notable figures like Aryabhata and Brahmagupta. These luminaries constituted the vanguard of major mathematician-astronomers during the classical age of Indian mathematics and astronomy.\n\nVarahamihira’s influence extended far beyond the realm of mathematics; he was also celebrated as an accomplished astrologer, ranking among the foremost Acharya’s in the domain of modern astrology. Furthermore, his legacy transcended his own contributions, as his son Prithuyasas made notable strides in Hindu astrology, leaving behind a renowned work known as the “Hora Sora,” which has become a renowned tome in horoscopy. Here, we delve into some of Varahamihira’s pivotal works that continue to shape these disciplines.\n\nMastering Math and Astrology for all\n\nVarahamihira’s scholarly journey extended far beyond mathematics; he also earned acclaim as a revered astrologer, counted among the greatest Acharyas in the realm of modern astrology. His illustrious lineage continued with his son, Prithuyasas, who made significant contributions to Hindu astrology, most notably through his renowned work, “Hora Sora,” a celebrated treatise on horoscopy. Below, we delve into some of the pivotal works of Varahamihira, shedding light on his remarkable legacy in these domains.\n\nPancha-Siddhantika: Unveiling Ancient Wisdom\n\nThe Pancha-Siddhantika, also known as the “Treatise on the Five Astronomical Canons,” dated to 575 AD, stands as a valuable source that provides insights into earlier lost Indian texts. This significant work by Varahamihira serves as a comprehensive treatise on mathematical astronomy, encapsulating the knowledge from five earlier astronomical treatises: Surya, Romaka, Paulisa, Vasishtha, and Paitamaha Siddhantas. Within its pages, we find a rich fusion of Vedanga Jyotisha and Hellenistic astronomy, incorporating elements from Greek and Roman traditions. Let’s delve into these five Siddhantas:\n\nSurya Siddhanta: This Siddhantika, dedicated to the Sun, is credited to the ancient asura king Mayasura, also known as Mamuni Mayan, as mentioned by Varahamihira.\n\nVasishtha Siddhanta: Named after one of the stars in the Great Bear constellation, this Siddhanta was composed by Vishnucandra.\n\nPaulisa Siddhanta: Derived from Pulisa, possibly indicating its origin in Alexandria, this Siddhanta is attributed to Pulisa.\n\nRomaka Siddhanta: Often referred to as the Doctrine of the Romans, this Siddhanta delves into subjects related to the Roman Empire and is attributed to Srishena.\n\nPaitamaha Siddhanta: The Patiamaha Siddhanta is the final Siddhanta in this esteemed collection.\n\nThe Brihat-Samhita – A Multifaceted Compendium of Knowledge\n\nVarahamihira’s most remarkable achievement, the Brihat-Samhita, stands as a comprehensive compendium encompassing a wide array of subjects. While its primary focus is on divination, this monumental work extends its reach to diverse areas of knowledge, including architecture, temple construction, planetary movements, eclipses, timekeeping, astrology, seasons, cloud formation, rainfall patterns, agriculture, mathematics, gemology, perfumery, and numerous other topics.\n\nWithin its pages, the Brihat-Samhita delves into the criteria for evaluating gemstones, drawing from the wisdom found in the Garuda Purana. It offers detailed insights into the sacred nine Pearls, as described in the same ancient text. Comprising a total of 106 chapters, this monumental work is rightfully hailed as the “great compilation” due to its unparalleled scope and depth of knowledge.\n\nVarahamihira’s Mathematical and Physical Insights\n\nVarahamihira made significant contributions to the field of trigonometry, elevating the precision of Aryabhata’s sine tables. He is also credited as one of the early mathematicians to unveil a precursor of what we now recognize as Pascal’s triangle. Within this mathematical framework, he adeptly calculated binomial coefficients and even left behind the earliest recorded 4×4 magic square.\n\nIn the realm of physics, Varahamihira’s insights were equally profound. He articulated that reflection occurs due to the back-scattering of particles, shedding light on the fundamental mechanism behind this optical phenomenon. Additionally, he postulated that refraction, the bending of light as it transitions from one medium to another, is facilitated by the particles’ ability to infiltrate the inner spaces of materials. This concept drew an intriguing parallel to the behavior of fluids permeating porous substances, thus offering a unique perspective on the phenomenon of refraction.\n\nVarahamihira’s literary legacy provides a comprehensive glimpse into the India of the 6th century. His writings consistently underscored the significance of astrology, with notable treatises dedicated to the study of omens. Among his prominent works, we find “Brihaj Jataka,” a substantial treatise on great births, and “Laghu Jataka,” a concise work on shorter birth-related topics. These two enduring compositions by Varahamihira remain renowned for their insights into the intricate art of horoscope casting."
