        "text": "Hint:\n\nVarāhamihira is also credited with writing a number of definitive texts on astronomy and astrology.\n\nHe learned Greek and, in his text, thanked the Greeks (Yavanas) for being \"well trained in sciences.\"\n\nComplete answer:\n\nWhat, Where, When?\n\n1. Varāhamihira (c. 505-c. 587), also known as Varāha or Mihira, was a Hindu astronomer and polymath living in Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh, India).\n\n2. He was born in the Avanti region, roughly corresponding to modern-day Malwa (part of Madhya Pradesh , India) and Adityadasa.\n\n3. He was trained at Kapitthaka, according to one of his own works.\n\n4. Varāhamihira's most noteworthy work was Brihat Samhita, an encyclopedic on\n\n- architecture,\n\n- temples,\n\n- celestial cycles,\n\n- eclipses,\n\n- timekeeping,\n\n- astrology,\n\n- seasons,\n\n- cloud formation,\n\n- rainfall,\n\n- agriculture,\n\n- geometry,\n\n- gemology,\n\n- perfumes and many other subjects.\n\n5. According to Varahamihira, in some verses he merely outlined current literature on astronomy, Shilpa Sastra and many others.\n\n6. The major work of Varahamihira is the book Pañcasiddhāntikā (\"[Treatise] on the Five [Astronomical] Canons\") dated 575 CE, which provides us with information on older Indian texts that have now been lost.\n\n7. The thesis is a treatise on mathematical astronomy, summarising five earlier astronomical treatises by five authors, namely Surya Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta, Paulisa Siddhanta, Vasishtha Siddhanta and Paitamaha Siddhant.\n\nHence, the correct answer is option D\n\nNote:\n\nIndian tradition considers him to be one of the \"Nine Gems\" (Navaratnas) of the court of Yashodharman Vikramaditya of Malwa.\n\nHowever, this assertion appears for the first time in a much later text, and scholars consider this claim to be questionable since neither Varahamihira nor Vikramaditya lived in the same century, nor did Varahamihira live in the same century as any of the other titles."
