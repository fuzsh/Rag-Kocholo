        "text": "\"In the horoscope of Rama, the Sun was in exaltation in Mesha rasi, the Moon was in Punarvasu nakshatra (constellation) and the tithi (i.e., the age of the Moon) was Navami, the ninth tithi. Even if we take the extreme case of the Sun being in the beginning of the first degree of the sidereal Mesha rasi, and the Moon being in the end of the last degree of the constellational Punarvasu (i.e., at 93°20' of the sidereal Nirayana longitude, the elongation (i.e., the distance) of the Moon from the Sun would be 93° 20' at the most. This elongation of 93° 20' would mean only Astami (i.e., eighth) tithi at the rate of twelve degrees for a tithi, and the tithi would not thus have been the Navami tithi as stated in Ramayana. If Rama’s horoscope was cast according to the sidereal zodiac, it should be an impossible one and will not represent the true state of the heavens. If it is a true horoscope, the Sun should have been in some other place than the sidereal Mesha. If the Sun is shifted backwards by at least 2° 40' (equal to 96° minus 93°20'), the horoscope of Rama would be a possible one, and this means that the Sun should have been then in Meena rasi of the sidereal (or nirayana) zodiac or the sign Aries of the tropical (sayana) zodiac. If it was the Meena rasi of the sidereal zodiac, then the Sun would not have been in exaltation. It therefore follows that the Sun should have been only in the sign Aries of the tropical zodiac.\n\nC. G. Rajan, Madras, 24th June 1956.\"\n\nHow come sage Valmiki recorded the birth time of Rama if it was impossible under the sidereal system? Obviously, sage Valmiki did not err in describing a tropical position, as our ancestors used a tropical zodiac. Those who believe in Rama/Ramayana must realize that Rama's horoscope is impossible under the sidereal system. It is our mistake to have followed the sidereal system for so long, but it is understandable as we are in Kali yuga.\n\nI have explained this concept with additional graphics in my post: Sri Rama’s horoscope is definitely tropical"
