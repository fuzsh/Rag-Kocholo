        "text": "Information on the Discovery\n\nAryabhata's major contribution was his elucidation of the Earth's rotation on its axis and the motion of the planets. Varahamihira, on the other hand, compiled and expanded upon existing astronomical knowledge, providing empirical observations and calculations of celestial bodies in his texts.\n\nStory of Aryabhata and Varahamihira\n\nThe story of Aryabhata and Varahamihira is one of intellectual prowess and curiosity in ancient India. Aryabhata was a pioneering thinker who challenged prevailing notions of Earth's static position in the universe. Varahamihira, celebrated for his astronomical and astrological treatises, was known for his holistic approach to the sciences and his ability to synthesize various astronomical traditions.\n\nHistory of the Discovery\n\nAryabhata's work dates back to the 5th century CE, while Varahamihira flourished in the 6th century CE. Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya and Varahamihira's Brihat Samhita and Pancha-Siddhantika are critical historical texts that provide insights into their discoveries and the astronomical knowledge of the time.\n\nScriptural References and Its Mentions\n\nBoth Aryabhata and Varahamihira's works are considered seminal in the field of ancient Indian astronomy. The Aryabhatiya deals extensively with mathematics and astronomy, while Varahamihira's Brihat Samhita is an encyclopedia of astrology and astronomy, and the Pancha-Siddhantika discusses five astronomical canons.\n\nGlobal Influence/Acceptance\n\nThe contributions of Aryabhata and Varahamihira had a profound global impact, particularly in the Islamic world, where their works were translated into Arabic. This transmission played a significant role in the development of astronomy in the Islamic Golden Age, which later influenced European astronomy during the Renaissance."
