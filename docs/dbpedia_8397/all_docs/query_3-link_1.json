        "text": "Varahamihira (born 505, Ujjain, India—died 587, Ujjain) was an Indian philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, author of the Pancha-siddhantika (“Five Treatises”), a compendium of Greek, Egyptian, Roman, and Indian astronomy.\n\nVarahamihira’s knowledge of Western astronomy was thorough. In five sections, his monumental work progresses through native Indian astronomy and culminates in two treatises on Western astronomy, showing calculations based on Greek and Alexandrian reckoning and even giving complete Ptolemaic mathematical charts and tables. But his greatest interest lay in astrology. He repeatedly emphasized its importance and wrote many treatises on shakuna (“augury”) as well as the Brihaj-jataka (“Great Birth”) and the Laghu-jataka (“Short Birth”), two works on the casting of horoscopes."
