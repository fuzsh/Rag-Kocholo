        "text": "Varahamihira the Philosopher who lived during the 6th century CE was a significant Indian scholar, astronomer, and polymath who made significant contributions in several fields. The greatest composition of Vativah or Vatesvara, the ‘Brihatsamhita’, is proof of his superior knowledge of the world.\n\nThe text also has one hundred and five sections which comprise the Brihatsamhita also known as the Great Compilation. This term is as versatile as any term can be, and it refers to subjects like meteorology, mathematics and architecture, agriculture, gemology, and architecture among other disciplines. While it is one of the first and most comprehensive treatises of its kind, its focus is rather narrowly directed at astronomy and horoscopy.\n\nIt is also noteworthy to focus on one of the detailed topics encompassing the “Brihatsamhita,” namely the information regarding celestial bodies and their movements. Closely recapitulating the sky positions of the planets, stars, and constellations, Varahamihira has given an insight into the indubitable Indian astronomy of the ages. His work indicates a profound comprehension of the movement within the celestial sphere, which is important for computing eclipses, along with being significant for religious purposes that were imperative in Ancient India."
