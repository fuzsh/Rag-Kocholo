He discovered a version of Pascal's triangle and worked on magic squares.\n\nMathematical Profile (Excerpt):\n\nThe school of mathematics at Ujjain was increased in importance due to Varahamihira working there and it continued for a long period to be one of the two leading mathematical centres in India, in particular having Brahmagupta as its next major figure.\n\nThe most famous work by Varahamihira is the Pancasiddhantika (The Five Astronomical Canons) dated 575 AD.\n\nOne treatise which Varahamihira summarises was the Romaka-Siddhanta which itself was based on the epicycle theory of the motions of the Sun and the Moon given by the Greeks in the 1st century AD.\n\nOther works which Varahamihira summarises are also based on the Greek epicycle theory of the motions of the heavenly bodies.\n\nThere is, however, quite a debate about interpreting data from Varahamihira's astronomical texts and from other similar works.\n\nVarahamihira made some important mathematical discoveries.\n\nIn particular he examines a pandiagonal magic square of order four which occurs in Varahamihira's work.\n\nBorn 505, Kapitthaka, India. Died 587, India.\n\nView full biography at MacTutor"
