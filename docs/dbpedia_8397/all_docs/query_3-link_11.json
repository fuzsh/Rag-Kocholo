        "text": "The most famous work by Varahamihira is the treatise on mathematical astronomy called the Pañca-siddhāntikā (\"Five Astronomical Treatises\") and dated 575 AD. It is a summary of five earlier astronomical systems, namely the Surya, Romaka, Paulisa, Vasistha and Paitamaha siddhantas.\n\nContributions in Mathematics:\n\nThe Pancha Siddhantika are:\n\n1. Sūrya-Siddhānta, ie. the Siddhānta of the Sun, composed by Lāṭa,\n\n2. Vasishṭa-siddhānta, so called from one of the stars of the Great Bear, composed by Vishnucandra,\n\n3. Pulisa-siddhānta, so called from Paulisa, the Greek, from the city of Saintra, which I suppose to be Alexandria, composed by Pulisa.\n\n4. Romaka-siddhānta, so called from the Rūm, ie. the subjects of the Roman Empire, composed by Śrīsheṇa.\n\n5. Brahma-siddhānta, so called from Brahman, composed by Brahmagupta, the son of Jishṇu, from the town of Bhillamāla between Multān and Anhilwāra, 16 yojanas from the latter place.The authors of these books draw from one and the same source, the book \"Paithāmaha\", so called from the first father, ie. Brahman.\"\n\nThe Arya-siddhanta, a lot work on astronomical computations, is known through the writings of Aryabhata's contemporary, Varahamihira, and later mathematicians and commentators, including Brahmagupta and Bhaskara.Varahamihira gives a reference to the day of Kuja (Mars). Mars is also called Kshiti – Tanaya (the sun of the earth).He says ths day is inauspicious whether the one who says so is an ordinary man or is Pitamaha (lit means grandfather.. in this context it means Brahma).\n\nVarahamihira's other most important contribution is the encyclopedic Brihat-Samhita. It covers wide ranging subjects of human interest, including astrology, planetary movements, eclipses, rainfall, clouds, architecture, growth of crops, manufacture of perfume, matrimony, domestic relations, gems, pearls, and rituals"
