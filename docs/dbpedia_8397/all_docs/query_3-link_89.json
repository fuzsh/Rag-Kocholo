        "text": "Mathematics is the study of concepts like quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. Classical Indian mathematicians like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Mahavira, Bhaskara II, Madhava of Sangamagrama, Nilakantha Somayaji, etc. are immortal thanks to their contributions to mathematics. For instance, the decimal system, the idea of zero as a number, negative numbers, arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, etc. Sanskrit was used to write mathematical works from ancient to medieval India, particularly sutras that outlined a set of rules or problems.\n\nList of Indian mathematicians from Ancient to Modern India\n\n1.
