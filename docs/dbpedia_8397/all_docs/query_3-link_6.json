        "text": "Varahamihira was the prodigious Indian Astronomer, Astrologer of Ujjain, and distinguished Mathematician, who lived in 5th century AD. He was the principal Indian sage who predicted the availability of water in Mars about 1500 years ago. His valuable insights about the space and universe become the study of modern scientists. He identified that the moon and other planets are glistening because of sunlight. His adjacent contemporaries Aryabhata and Brahmagupta could not compare with the acceptance of Varahamihira.[1] His Astrological talent promoted was one among the nine Gems of the emperor Vikramaditya and Chandragupta. The minute observations awarded the most reputed exaltation among the Navaratnas of the court of Vikramaditya.\n\nKalidasa in his book Jyotir Vidhabharanam has admired the role of Varahamihira through the verses–\n\n[...][2]\n\nIbn Batuta and Al-Baruni were two prominent Arab travelers who had visited ancient India specially to pursue Astrology. By their translations they had induced German scholars to come to India to study traditional Astrology and Vedic literature. The Ancestors of Aryabhata, and Varahamihira declared that earth was spherical in shape. Ever in the history of science he was the first to claim that some “force” might be keeping bodies stuck to the round earth. Later the force has been called as gravity. He constructed Merustambh 2200 years ago for doing research on astronomy. His great work called Panchsidhanthika summarizes the earlier astronomical treatise such as Surya Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta, Paulisa Siddhanta, Vasishtha Siddhanta and Paitama Siddhanta. He proposed that the Moon and planets are lustrous not because of their own light but due to sunlight. Another significant contribution of Varahamihira is the encyclopedic Brihat-Samhita covering wide range of subjects covering astrology, planetary movements, eclipses, star effects, rainfall, clouds, and symptoms of male and female, domestic animals, gems, pearls and propitiating rituals. He wrote on all the three main branches of Jyotisha (Ganita-Samhita and Hora) covered under his great works named as Brihat Jataka, Laghu Jataka, Samasa Samhita, Brihat Yogayatra, Yoga yatra, Dikkani Yatra, Vivaha Patala and Daivajna Vallabha (apocryphal). Varahamihira’s mathematical work includes the discovery of the trigonometric formulas. He improved the accuracy of the sine tables of Aryabhata. He defined the algebraic properties of zero as well as of negative numbers. Furthermore, he was the first mathematician who discovered the version of Pascal’s triangle which is useful to calculate the binomial coefficients."
