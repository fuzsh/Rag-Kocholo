        "text": "We have many desires and hopes in our life. When the things are not working according to our wishes, we get depressed and may consult an astrologer for the future predictions. A good astrologer should tell your fate without any hesitation and you should be ready to face the destiny. Fate is inevitable. If you are destined to marry twice, you will definitely marry twice. If you are destined to get loss in your business, you will definitely suffer losses.\n\nThe saying “Fate is inevitable” reminds me of the story of a legend, Mihira (also known as Varahmihira).\n\nKing Vikramaditya had nine extraordinary people, known as the Nine jewels (navaratnas) in his court. Mihira was one among the nine jewels in the court. He was a great mathematician and renowned astrologer of his time. His great works on Astrology were Brihat Jataka, Pancha Siddhantika and Brihat Samhita etc.\n\nOne day King Vikramaditya asked his astrologers to predict his son’s future. All of them studied the boy’s horoscope and predicted that the prince would face death at the age of 18. The death might be from injuries inflicted by animal. However, Mihira was more precise and predicted that the boy would be killed by a boar (varaha) at a particular date and time. He also said that, there was no remedy to save him. The king declared that Mihira would be crowned with the Royal title “Varaha”, if the prediction comes true.\n\nUntil the age of 18, the prince was enjoying his life to the fullest. However on the day that Mihira predicted to be fatal, the King took all precautions to avoid animal entry into the palace. The Prince was sent to the top floor with enough security. Knowing that no animal can reach the prince and being sure of his safety, the King instructed Mihira to check his predictions again.\n\nHowever Mihira was confident about his predictions and the whole kingdom was waiting for the outcome. After the predicted time of death passed, King asked Mihira to recheck his predictions. Mihira stated that the prince was dead and the king can go to check himself personally. The King reached the top floor of the palace and observed that the companions of the prince were playing. The companions informed the king that the prince was playing with them and it was only just a short while ago that the prince went to the adjacent terrace.\n\nOn reaching the terrace, the king found the prince lying dead in a pool of blood. The prince was stabbed to death by the metal claws of the artificial boar that was installed on the tower of the palace. The boar (varaha) was the Royal emblem of the Kingdom. Minutes before his death, the prince had gone to terrace while playing and he was hit by the artificial boar statue that broke because of the strong winds. The boar fell on the prince causing deep injuries and death was due to loss of blood.\n\nWith the prediction coming true, Mihira was known as Varahamihira from that day.\n\nStory Reference: ‘ Life of Varahamihira’ by Late Suryanarian Rao"
