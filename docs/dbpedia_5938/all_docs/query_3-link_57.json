The extended 29-bit identifier frame (CAN 2.0B) is identical except the longer ID. It is e.g. used in the J1939 protocol for heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nNote that the CAN ID and Data are highlighted - these are important when recording CAN bus data, as we will see below.\n\nHow to log CAN bus data\n\n#2: Identify what adapter cable to use\n\nNext, determine what adapter should be used. This is application specific, but below are 4 common options:\n\nHow to decode raw CAN data to 'physical values'\n\n#3: Use a software/API tool\n\nFinally, you will need a software/API tool that supports your log file format and DBC files.\n\nThe relevant software depends on your use case - below are examples for the CANedge:\n\nLogging CAN data - example use cases\n\nThere are several common use cases for recording CAN bus data:\n\nDo you have a CAN logging use case? Reach out for free sparring!\n\nContact us\n\nFor more intros, see our guides section - or download the 'Ultimate Guide' PDF.\n\nNeed to log/stream CAN bus data?\n\nGet your CAN logger today!\n\nRecommended for you"
