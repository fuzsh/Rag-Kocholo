        "text": "By now you’ve undoubtedly heard about Anheuser-Busch InBev’s recent purchase of SABMiller, creating the largest brewery conglomerate in the world. The purchase is but one more in the increasing history of brewery mergers, perhaps a sign that the long-rumored consolidation of the brewing industry is in full swing. Unfortunately, most companies can do little to stop market consolidation because the buying power of these “super breweries” yields incredible influence in the brewing industry. The question is: what can local craft breweries do to minimize the effects the beer industry’s latest trend?\n\nOne initiative few breweries have executed is the development of strategic partnerships and joint ventures. In such a scenario, two or more breweries agree to combine forces and share resources, market opportunities, and related information. This allows each brewery to retain its independence, preserving its “local” and “craft” identities, while enjoying the benefits of increased market exposure and opportunity. In a world where big beer keeps getting bigger, and an industry that takes pride in local breweries, a strategic partnership or joint venture may be the best of both worlds.\n\nA recent example demonstrates the value of a strategic partnership or joint venture. In September, Lagunitas and Heineken announced their joint venture. The move allows Lagunitas to gain traction in the global beer market and Heineken to tap into the local craft beer scene through Lagunitas’ impressive local reputation. Committing to this relationship is a risk for both brands, but both must believe that their shared strengths outweigh the cost and risk of the investment. These two companies in particular have less to lose. They will unlikely suffer too much harm if the venture fails because both companies have established market power. Smaller breweries considering these initiatives must be much more careful, as these ventures may unnecessarily risk a growing brewery’ identity. Although it’s early to say whether this move will benefit either or both companies, it’s an encouraging step towards the expansion of craft brewing without sacrificing its independence or “craft” label.\n\nFor more information on this joint venture, click here.\n\nAnother intellectual property dispute has arisen in the brewing industry. This time, however, the battle took place on Canadian soil. British Columbia based Pacific Western Brewing (“PWB”) sued renowned Mexican brewery Cerveceria del Pacifico (“CDP”), arguing the latter’s name was confusingly similar to PWB’s various brew-related trademarks. For those who do not know, Cerveceria del Pacifico is the brewery responsible for Cerveza Pacifico Clara, better known as Pacifico. Although the claim concerns numerous PWB marks, the lawsuit seems to center on the alleged similarity between their Pacific Pilsner marks and CDP’s Pacifico marks. After analyzing the merits of this case, I cannot understand why PWB felt the need to pursue this lawsuit. Aside from both marks generally using the word “Pacific,” the marks are vastly different.\n\nFirst, Cerveza Pacifico Clara is clearly distinct from Pacific Pilsner. Even if you compare the commonly used name Pacifico to Pacific Pilsner, the marks are distinguishable, albeit slightly more similar. Further, the respective design marks are distinct. Pacifico’s mark is generally presented against a bright yellow background with the words appearing in red and a different shade of yellow. The logo also features a lifesaver encompassing a hill with the port city of Mazatlan’s lighthouse hill, known locally as Cerro Del Creston. In contrast, Pacific Pilsner’s mark is generally presented against a white background with the words appearing in red and iridescent blue. Although the PWB designs vary slightly, they consistently include a sailboat. Based on these descriptions, it should be clear that the marks are patently distinguishable.\n\nJustice Luc Martineau, who presided over the case, disagreed with PWB’s assertions. Justice Martineau said the first impression given by CDP’s mark for Pacifico “is of its obviously foreign origin” and that it’s “highly stylized with many distinctive design elements, including strong and contrasting colours [sic] and font in red, gold, blue, green, and yellow.” Justice Martineau also stated that the mark “differs visually, phonetically, and semantically” from all of the marks PWB uses for its Pacific beers. According to Justice Martineau “There is no resemblance in the design or colour [sic] elements. In short, the overall impression created by the mark is that of an imported beer originating from Mexico.”\n\nMartineau also dismissed PWB’s allegation that CDP committed a fraud on the register when it represented that Pacifico was first sold in Canada as early as April 1986. Dismissing this allegation, Justice Martineau noted that PWB failed to challenge an affidavit from CDP that it first introduced its beers to Canada in 1986, at a Mexican restaurant called Ole Cantina.\n\nLater, in December 1989, Pacifico was first listed with the British Columbia Liquor Distribution branch. Then, in August 1990, a registration protecting the mark was issued. This is important because Justice Martineau found that PWB’s delay of almost 25 years to bring its claims weighed heavily against a finding of likelihood of confusion and eventually ruled in favor of CDP. PWB has subsequently filed an appeal of the decision in the Federal Court of Appeal, but based on Justice Martineau’s ruling, as well as the clear distinction between these marks, the trial court is unlikely to be overturned.\n\nThis copyright case pitted two big YouTube content brands against each other over issues of fair use. On one side is Equals Three, LLC, a YouTube content studio and channel created and owned by Ray William Johnson, an early YouTube content pioneer. The Equals Three channel has over 10 million subscribers and over 3 billion total views making it one of the most viewed channels on YouTube. Equals Three produces YouTube comedy content. A typical program involves a host who gives an introduction to a particular video clip, shows parts of video clips (which are usually shown in edited form and inset within a decorative graphical frame) and tells humorous or provides humorous commentary about the events and people presented in the clip. Each program is roughly five minutes long and typically features three segments, each of which centers around a different video.\n\nOne the other side is Jukin Media, Inc. Jukin is a digital media company that primarily acquires user generated video content and distributes and monetizes such content over multiple online platforms and traditional media outlets, produces and licenses. Jukin acquires the user-generated content by using a research and acquisitions team of eleven people to scour the internet for videos likely to become sensationally popular. Once Jukin acquires the rights to user-generated content, it uploads the video to its YouTube channel and its own websites. Jukin makes money from these videos by ad-supported or subscription-based platforms. Jukin also licenses these videos to other digital, television and cable shows.\n\nJukin claimed that Equals Three unlawfully used ninteen Jukin owned or controlled clips in one or more Equals Three episode. Jukin instated numerous Content ID claims with YouTube against various Equals Three episodes. These claims prevent Equals Three from monetizing the episodes at issue and allows Jukin to receive all advertising revenue related to such episodes. Equals Three filed a complaint for a declartory judgment that its use of Jukin’s videos was fair use.\n\nIn determining whether the use of a work is a fair use, courts consider the following factors: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nThe Purpose and Character of the Use\n\nThis factor measures whether a work is “transformative” in nature; whether it “adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.” The more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of the other factors that may weigh against a finding of fair use.\n\nEquals Three claims that its episodes are transformative because they are parodies of the Jukin videos. Jukin argues that the episodes are not parodies because they do not critique Jukin’s videos. With the exception of one of Jukin clip, the court disagreed with Jukin. The court held that:\n\nthe episodes comment upon or criticize Jukin’s videos…[they] directly respond to and highlight humorous aspects of Jukin’s videos. The episodes do so via the host’s reactions to the videos, jokes, narration, costumes and graphics. The host’s narration does not simply recount what is shown in Jukin’s videos; instead the host makes comments about Jukin’s videos that highlight their ridiculousness by creating fictionalized narratives of how the events transpired, using similes, or by directly mocking the depicted events and people.\n\nHowever, with regard to one clip – a clip of the first person to obtain an iPhone 6 in Perth, Australia promptly dropping the phone upon opening the packaging – the court did not find Equals Three’s use transformative. Equals Three said it used this footage for the purpose of making two points: (1) don’t be the first person to do something new; and (2) the iPhone 6 packaging is absurd. The court finds that these two “general, broad points” are not directly aimed at criticizing or commenting on the video and thus not transformative.\n\nNature of the Copyrighted Work\n\nThis factor looks at what type of work it is (i.e., is it a creative work or something else) and whether this is a type of work that falls closer to the core of copyright’s protection. In dicta, the court questioned whether the “point and shoot” variety of user generated content is a creative work or a factual recitation (which is not as close to the core of copyright’s protection as is a creative work). Ultimately the court concludes that the nature of the Jukin clips is creative, but the clips’ creative nature is “not particularly important where the new work is highly transformative.”\n\nAmount and Substantiality of the Portion Used\n\nThe third factor examines the quantitative amount and qualitative value of the original work used. Jukin argued that while Equals Three may have not used all of the clips, it used the most important parts of the clips. Equals Three argued that it used no more of the clips than was necessary to create its parody episode. The court agreed finding that Equals Three did not use more than reasonably necessary to “convey enough of the events to allow the host’s jokes, comments, and criticisms to make sense to the viewer and resonate.”\n\nMarket Harm Through Substitution\n\nThis factor examines whether the use harms the potential market for or value of the original work because it has created a market substitute. That is, does the new work diminish demand for the original work by acting as a substitute for it. Market harm cannot be established by allowable commentary and criticism. Also, damage to a licensing market caused by fair use is not recognizable under this factor.\n\nWhile the transformative nature of Equals Three’s videos makes cognizable market harm less likely, the court was unable to say that it is completely implausible that at least some viewers would substitute Jukin’s videos with Equals Three’s videos. The court noted that both videos are meant to be humorous and it could imagine a fine line between the demand for the humorous original and the humorous new work commenting thereon. Nevertheless, the court found that Jukin failed to show actual evidence of any such harm; and where market harm is hypothetical, this factor is neutral.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the “highly transformative” nature of Equals Three episodes and the fact that Equals Three used only what was reasonably necessary to achieve their transformative purpose, the court found Equals Three’s use of Jukins’ clips (with the exception of one clip) to be fair use.\n\nOver the last half century there has been an explosion in the popularity of yoga in the United States, much of it attributable to Bikram Choudhury, the self-proclaimed “Yogi to the Stars.” In 1979, he published a book titled Bikram’s Beginning Yoga Class, which centered on a sequence of 26 yoga poses and two breathing exercises. Two former students of his started a new type of yoga (hot yoga) which resulted in Choudhury suing them for copyright infringement. On October 8, 2015, the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion affirming the trial court’s summary adjudication as to the copyright claim and finding that the Bikram yoga “sequence” was not subject to Copyright protection.\n\nIn 1971, Choudhury came to the U.S. and settled in Beverly Hills, California. With his arrival, he helped popularize yoga in the United States and developed a “sequence” of 26 asanas and two breathing exercises; Choudhury opened a yoga studio where he taught the “Sequence” and eventually published his book, Bikram’s Beginning Yoga Class. In 1979, he registered the book with the U.S. Copyright Office. (In 2002, he registered a compilation of exercises contained in the book using a supplementary registration form that referenced the 1979 book.)\n\nIn 1994, Choudhury introduced the “Bikram Yoga Teacher Training Course,” which was attended in the early 2000s by Mark Drost and Zefea Samson. Following their completion of the course, Drost and Samson founded Evolation Yoga, LLC, which offered several types of yoga, including “hot yoga” which was similar to Bikram’s basic yoga system. Evolation acknowledged that hot yoga includes 26 poses and two breathing exercises (like Bikram yoga) and is done for 90 minutes in a room heated to approximately 105 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn July of 2011, Choudhury and his Bikram’s Yoga College filed suit claiming, among other things, that the hot yoga system of Evolation violated its copyright. Evolation moved for partial summary judgment as to the copyright infringement claim and the court granted the motion, ruling that the “Sequence is a collection of facts and ideas” which were not entitled to copyright protection. The plaintiffs appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nIn affirming the trial court’s decision, the Ninth Circuit found that at its most basic essence, “the Sequence is an idea, process or system designed to improve health.” Because copyright law is intended only to protect the expression of an idea, i.e., “the words and pictures used to describe the Sequence,” and not the idea of the Sequence itself, the Sequence was not subject to copyright protection.\n\nRead More\n\nOn October 14, 2015, the California Second District Court of Appeal held in Sharif v. Mehusa, Inc. that both the employee and the employer can be deemed “prevailing party” for purposes of recovering attorneys’ fees under the Labor Code. Plaintiff, Mahta Sharif, brought an action against her former employer, Mehusa, Inc., for unpaid overtime (Lab. Code, § 1194), unpaid wages (Lab. Code, § 201), and violation of California’s Equal Pay Act (Lab. Code, § 1197.5). She prevailed on her Equal Pay Act claim with the jury awarding her $26,300. Mehusa prevailed on Plaintiff’s overtime and wage claims. Plaintiff filed a cost memorandum and was awarded her costs. She also filed a motion for attorney fees in the amount of $280,432 under Labor Code section 1197.5(g) as the prevailing party on her Equal Pay Act claim. Plaintiff’s attorney fees request consisted of a lodestar amount of $140,216 and a multiplier of two. Mehusa filed a motion for attorney fees and costs under Labor Code section 218.5 in the amount of $36,982.24 as the prevailing party on Plaintiff’s wage claims. Mehusa estimated that 75% of defense counsel’s time was spent defending against Plaintiff’s unsuccessful wage claims.\n\nThe trial court ruled that Labor Code section 218.5 is a two-way fee shifting statute that requires the award of reasonable attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party on wage claims. Relying on Aleman v. AirTouch Cellular (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 556, 582-583, the trial court further ruled that when there are multiple claims asserted in an action, to be a “prevailing party” under section 218.5, a defendant need not prevail on all of the claims, but only on those claims to which section 218.5 applies. Thus, after determining that only $35,054 of her attorney’s fee request was related to her successful Equal Pay Act claim, the trial court awarded Plaintiff $35,054 for her attorney’s fees under Labor Code section 1197.5. The trial court also awarded Defendant $31,334.81 under Labor Code section 218.5 for its attorney fees in connection with Plaintiff’s unsuccessful wage claims, and then offset the awards for a net award to Plaintiff of $3,709.19.\n\nPlaintiff appealed contending that she was the sole prevailing party on a “practical level” and as that term is defined in California Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(a)(4). Accordingly, Plaintiff argued that the trial court erred in awarding Mehusa its attorney fees and costs. In affirming the trial court’s decision, the Appellate Court held that a net monetary award to a party does not determine the prevailing party when there are two fee shifting statutes involved in one action. Instead the court explained, when there are two fee shifting statutes in separate causes of action [as there were in this case – Labor Code sections 1197.5 and 218.5], there can be a prevailing party for one cause of action and a different prevailing party for the other cause of action.\n\nAs I frequently mention in my articles, trademark law is a much more prevalent part of the average person’s life than they realize. We are surrounded by the trademarks of numerous companies every time that we step outside, or even when we look around our own homes. However, we would not generally expect for trademark law to be inserted into a presidential campaign. At least, not until Donald Trump threw his hat in the ring.\n\nSince Donald Trump has coined the campaign slogan “Make America Great Again,” he has been quite diligent about protecting his brand. Trump’s army of trademark attorneys have been aggressively threatening companies such as Café Press and an anti-Trump interest group with cease and desist letters ordering that they cease using the mark “Make America Great Again.” Although this is a shock to many of us who are not accustomed to seeing trademark law inserted into the political sphere, it should not come as too much of a surprise given Mr. Trump’s involvement. Donald Trump‘s acute understanding of the power of branding has significantly contributed to his net worth that allegedly exceeds $8.7 billion dollars. So his diligent brand protection is hardly out of character.\n\nTrademark claims have been regularly made at the lower levels of politics, such as in campaigns for local offices, but they are rarely seen at the presidential level. Despite Mitt Romney’s use of numerous creative campaign logos and designs in the 2012 election, none of them were trademarked. To the contrary, Team Obama did not hesitate to trademark its campaign logo utilizing the Obama “O” which symbolized “a rising sun and a new day.” According to the creator of the mark, brand development and design company Sender LLC, “The Sun Rising over the horizon evoked a new sense of hope.” The Obama Campaign felt so strongly about this meaning that the logo was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark office as a trademark. Still this was another exceptional case.\n\nTrump, however, is the first candidate to register a mark utilizing “America.” According to numerous trademark experts, Trump can establish that he has a right to the trademark “Make America Great Again” because the public now associates the mark with him. I tend to agree. What this is really saying is that “Make America Great Again” has acquired secondary meaning in the marketplace as a result of advertising or continued usage. Under United States trademark law, many common phrases cannot be trademarked unless they have acquired such secondary meaning. That certainly seems to be the case here given Trump’s repeated appearances in the red baseball hat bearing the mark. He has also repeatedly utilized the mark during his campaign speeches. The mark has become so commonly associated with Trump that when Tom Brady was seen wearing the hat in the locker room, rumors spread that he was a Trump supporter.\n\nCertain trademark experts have compared Trump’s right to “Make America Great Again” to that of Coke to “It’s the real thing” or Nike to “Just do it.” Logically, allowing such protection makes sense because when the mark becomes so closely associated with a company or an individual there is a “likelihood of consumer confusion” if others are permitted to sell goods bearing the mark. As such, other companies could wrongfully benefit from the goodwill of the individual or company who owns the mark.\n\nBased on this brief analysis, it seems that while Trump’s trademarking of the phrase “Make America Great Again” may be uncommon in the sphere of presidential politics, it is likely permitted under United States trademark law. It remains to be seen whether this business-like mentality will have any effect on Trump’s campaign, but it certainly did not seem to affect the 2008 or the 2012 Obama campaigns. Irrespective of how you feel about Mr. Trump’s political views, you have to admit, the man knows how to protect his brand.\n\nBy: The Labor and Employment Group\n\nWhen people begin to think about cool weather, hot chocolate, Thanksgiving, and this year the constant announcements about El Niño, only one thing always comes to my mind……..\n\nEmployer Handbook Season!\n\nYes, the end of the year always brings a flurry of revisions to employer handbooks. This year is no different. Business owners, general counsel, and human resources professionals throughout California and the County always look at Q4 and ask themselves “when was the last time your employee handbook was updated?” We are assisting many clients right now with their handbooks so that they are poised for a January 1 launch. With the constant changes in California (including the dozens of new bills just signed by the Governor), employer handbooks that are more than a year old can quickly become a huge liability.\n\nWhen creating or revising handbooks, employers must remember that the employee handbook is the announcement of the Companies policies. This is the first step toward legal compliance with the myriad of California’s (sometimes ridiculously generous) employment laws. If your handbook contains the wrong language, contains outdated content, or if you don’t enforce your policies consistently, the employer will often find themselves on the wrong side of employment-related lawsuits.\n\nUltimately a yearly examination will help employers prepare for incorporating changes in law into their workplace, ensure their policies are providing a structure for the administration of like leaves/vacations/sick time, and revising policies that are either obsolete or are not enforced uniformly.\n\nAreas to Scrutinize\n\nEvery year brings a torrent of new laws, regulations, and rulings here in California. Employers should carefully scrutinize certain areas within your handbooks to make sure you are compliant. The top areas of impact to focus on in reviewing your employee handbook for 2016 are:\n\nE-mail, Social Media and Technology Use policies\n\nWage & Hour rules and policies\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity rules and policies\n\nPolicies to help remain union free\n\nVacation and Sick leave policies\n\nLeave laws and policies\n\nAdditional Areas to Include\n\nIn addition to the areas, you want to ensure some of the basics of a solid employer handbook are also included and up to date. Some of those items include:\n\nAt-Will Statement\n\nAnti-Harassment and Discrimination policy\n\nDisclaimer (not a contract policy)\n\nAttendance\n\nDrug and Alcohol Abuse policy\n\nWorkplace Violation policy\n\nDisciplinary Policy and Procedure\n\nUltimately your handbook must be created with your Company in mind. Meeting legal requirements are a must for any handbook. However, you should then examine how those policies will work operationally. Operationally, the wording of the policies or the inclusion of policies may be vastly different for local, regional and national businesses.\n\nThen What???\n\nOnce created, the work is not done. Employers must consider how to deliver the new handbook to its employees, how to obtain acknowledgements that the handbook was received, and whether to have any meetings describing new or updated policies. The beginning of the New Year is a great time to launch new handbooks, arbitration agreements and other workplace policies.\n\nWe feel strongly every business should have access to high quality policies and handbooks. Whether you need a new handbook from scratch or you need your revisions reviewed for legal compliance we will work with you to make the process easy, fast, and cost effective.

We want to help.\n\nLaches, a judicially created defense based on the plaintiff’s delay and prejudice to the defendant, is a proper defense to the recovery of damages in a patent infringement suit, even though the Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that laches does not apply in copyright infringement cases.\n\nA divided en banc Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held in SCA Hygiene Products v. First Quality Baby Products (September 18, 2015) 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 16621 that Congress specifically provided for a laches defense in the Patent Act, unlike the Copyright Act.\n\nSCA owned a patent for adult incontinence devices; First Quality was a competitor. In 2003, SCA sent First Quality a letter stating that it believed First Quality’s products infringed SCA’s patent. First Quality replied that SCA’s patent was invalid based on a prior art patent. In 2004, SCA filed a petition for reexamination of its patent in the Patent and Trademark Office, citing the prior art patent. In 2007, the PTO upheld SCA’s patent. SCA had not informed First Quality of the reexamination because the reexamination proceedings were public, but First Quality believed that SCA had dropped its accusation in response to First Quality’s letter. During this time, First Quality had made significant investments in its business. SCA knew First Quality was expanding its business, but did not inform First Quality of the reexamination decision. In 2010, seven years after its last communication with First Quality, SCA sued First Quality for patent infringement.\n\nThe trial court granted First Quality’s motion for summary judgment on laches and equitable estoppel. SCA appealed. A panel of the Federal Circuit affirmed the trial court’s decision on the laches defense and reversed it on the equitable estoppel defense.\n\nOn rehearing before the en banc Federal Circuit, SCA contended that the Supreme Court’s decision in Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 134 S.Ct. 1962 (2014) eliminated laches as a defense. In Petrella, the Supreme Court held that laches is not a defense to a claim of copyright infringement brought within the Copyright Act’s statute of limitations. SCA argued that laches should not apply as a defense in patent infringement cases within the Patent Act’s six-year period for obtaining damages.\n\nThe Federal Circuit held that the Patent Act was not like the Copyright Act because the patent statutes expressly provided for both a six-year time limit on the recovery of monetary damages and a defense of laches.\n\nThe court explained that laches was codified in 35 U.S.C. §282(b)(1), which sets forth, in general terms, that defenses of “absence of liability” are permitted. The court relied on the commentary of the drafters of the Patent Act, which specifically stated that laches was a proper defense. The court noted that its holding is not new, as courts have interpreted §282 to permit laches as a proper defense to patent infringement claims for decades.\n\nThe court next addressed whether laches is a defense only to equitable relief (injunctions) or whether it is also a defense to legal relief (monetary damages). Although the patent statutes do not provide the answer to this question, the court concluded that laches is a defense to all forms of relief, based on this state of the case law in 1952 when the patent statutes were enacted. At that time, courts applied laches to bar both equitable and legal relief, and Congress intended to codify existing law in enacting the Patent Act. In analyzing Patrella, the court explained that the Supreme Court had:\n\n“eliminate[d] copyright’s judicially-created laches defense because Congress, through a statute of limitations, has already spoken on the timeliness of the copyright infringement claims, so there is no room for a judicially-created timeliness doctrine.”\n\nThis is in contrast to the Patent Act, which the court explained as follows:\n\n“The statutory scheme in patent law, however, is different. While Congress has spoken on the timeliness of patent damages claims, Congress also codified laches defense in §282. Thus, because §286 provides for a time limitation on the recovery of legal remedies, and §282 provides for laches as a defense to legal relief, the separation of powers concern is not present. . . . Laches therefore remains a viable defense to legal relief in patent law.”\n\nLastly, the court clarified that laches is a proper defense to a permanent injunction, but not to an ongoing royalty for a defendant’s continuing infringement. The factors considered in laches (the plaintiff’s delay and prejudice to the defendant) are relevant in deciding whether an injunction is appropriate, but the plaintiff’s delay should not bar it from recovering ongoing royalties for the defendant’s current infringement.\n\nThe court also distinguished the defense of equitable estoppel from laches. Equitable estoppel is a bar to the entire claim of patent infringement, precluding any relief. This is because equitable estoppel is premised on conduct by the patent owner that demonstrates acquiescence in the defendant’s infringing acts, essentially granting the defendant a license under the patent for the patent’s term.\n\nIn concluding, the court said that Congress can certainly change the law if it so chooses, but for now, laches survives. In that case, patent owners should be vigilant in protecting their rights."
