        "text": "Both a startling analysis and a charged polemic, this revised edition of Media Unlimited: How the Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our Lives reveals the unending stream of manufactured images and sounds as a defining feature of our civilization and a perverse culmination of Western hopes for freedom.\n\nWith an afterword by the author.\n\nIn this original look at our electronically glutted, speed-addicted world, sociology professor and cultural historian Todd Gitlin evokes a reality of relentless sensation, instant transition, and nonstop stimulus, which he argues is anything but progress. He shows how all media, all the time fuels celebrity worship, paranoia, and irony, and how attempts to ward off the onrush become occasion for yet more media. Far from bringing about a \"new information age,\" Gitlin argues, the digital torrent has fostered a society of disposable emotions and casual commitments, and threatens to make democracy a sideshow.\n\n\"A balanced yet biting critique . . . Gitlin is a savvy guide to our increasingly kinetic times.\"â€•San Francisco Chronicle"
