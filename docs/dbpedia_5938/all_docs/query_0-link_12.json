        "text": "The rush to wire Western Europe for cable television is on. Virtually every government on the Continent, interested in creating new industry and combating unemployment, is speeding plans to establish cable television networks.\n\nAnd not wishing to miss out on what promises to be a lucrative new market, Home Box Office, Warner Communications, Viacom International and a number of other American companies are positioning themselves to sell their expertise.\n\nMost European countries have some television cable in the ground, from nationwide hookups in smaller countries such as the Netherlands or Switzerland to scattered patches in regions of West Germany inaccessible to airwaves.\n\nBut they usually transmit network programs, and the idea now is to upgrade these systems, opening the door to previously unheard of commercial cable stations, pay television and future forms of private and commercial telecommunication.\n\nVirtually all European governments have some such plans, but West Germany and Britain, the two biggest markets, recently took the lead. In April, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government approved a proposal to mobilize private capital in Britain to hook up half of British homes to cable by 1990. And earlier this month, the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl said it planned to spend the equivalent of $390 million a year over the next several years to build a nationwide cable network.\n\nBoth Governments are eager to get conventional copper coaxial cables into the ground, despite warnings from some industry leaders that sophisticated glass fiber cable, with much more capacity, is just around the corner. ''The view is, it's time to stop talking and make money,'' said John Bird, an analyst at Mackintosh Consultants in Luton, England.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
