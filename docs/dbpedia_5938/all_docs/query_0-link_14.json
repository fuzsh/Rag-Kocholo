        "text": "Chroma Synthesizer\n\nChroma is a virtual instrument that brings back the spirit and sounds of the iconic Rhodes Chroma polyphonic analog synthesizer from 1982 with the utmost accuracy. Cherry Audio has painstakingly emulated every aspect with exacting precision, but made the sound programming experience more intuitive. In addition to the standard single instrument mode, Cherry Audio's Chroma includes the ability to add the Expander, effectively adding an entire second Chroma synthesizer to the mix that can run in layer or split modes.\n\nCR-78 Drum Machine\n\nCherry Audio's CR-78 accurately recreates the punchy analog sounds and 34 onboard preset rhythms of the first true classic drum machine and takes it much further. We've done away with the complex beat programming, replaced it with a familiar X0X-style button-per-step interface, and added an easy-to-use song mode for pattern chaining. Unlike sample-based emulations, Cherry Audio's CR-78 uses modeled synthesis to recreate the classic tones of the original and makes a quantum leap forward by making these sounds fully editable. Four studio-quality effects are provided, with a uniquely fast and fun \"send button\" for each individual tone in the effects and mixer section, which also includes a complete mixer, compressor, and a six-band graphic EQ.\n\nSynthesizer Expander Module\n\nSynthesizer Expander Module is a FREE emulation of the classic self‑contained synthesizer module of the same name. Though it was a simple, barebones monosynth, the Synthesizer Expander Module possessed a unique tone quality, courtesy of its 12 dB/oct state-variable filter. With lowpass, bandpass, highpass, and notch modes, this flexible filter was the star of the show. We've precisely recreated it here with a filter section and Phasor effect programmed by award-winning synth designer Mark Barton (MRB).\n\nSync\n\nSync is a user application to easily manage downloads, installations, updates, demos, and more for Cherry Audio's virtual instruments, effects, and preset packs. You will need a Cherry Audio account in order to install and use Sync.\n\nPro Soloist\n\nPro Soloist is the latest in Cherry Audio's roster of ultimate \"what if?\" virtual instruments. Featuring the precision-crafted and circuit-modeled DSP designs of award-winning developer Mark Barton, Cherry Audio's Pro Soloist goes beyond emulating the treasured, preset-based monophonic analog synth originally released by ARP in 1972. Pro Soloist not only exactingly reproduces the expressive controls, 30 presets, and the unique underlying architecture of this prog rock classic, it breaks it out of its cage by making it fully programmable and expanding it with full polyphony, splits and layers, a mod matrix, integrated studio-quality effects, and more.\n\nSynth Stack 4\n\nSynth Stack 4 assembles 22 of Cherry Audio's virtual instruments at an astoundingly affordable price, in addition to the Voltage Modular Core + Electro Drums bundle: DCO-106, CA2600, Surrealistic MG-1 Plus, Polymode, Eight Voice, PS-20, Memorymode, Mercury-4, Quadra, Dreamsynth, Miniverse, Lowdown, Elka-X, Sines, and GX-80. Also included -- and new this year -- are the hit virtual instruments Mercury-6, Novachord + Solovox, Octave Cat, Harmonia, PS-3300, and Pro Soloist. Includes 19 emulations of classic vintage synthesizers, three original synthesizers, one massive modular synthesizer platform, and nearly eight thousand presets!\n\nPS-3300\n\nPS-3300 is an exactingly faithful virtual analog emulation of the colossal and ultra-rare semi-modular analog polyphonic synthesizer released by KORG in 1977. Cherry Audio has pulled out all the stops to accurately recreate and update this mythical monster synth, from its massive stacked sonic character and signature multiple‑resonator sweeps to the considerable patching capabilities that distinguished the PS-3300 from all other polysynths at the time.\n\nHarmonia\n\nHarmonia is a wildly innovative virtual instrument from Cherry Audio, designed to easily create rich, evolving polyphonic tones through its intuitive visual interface. Using techniques similar to those found in additive synthesis, each Harmonia oscillator simultaneously produces up to eight pitches, individually tuned to harmonic series or semitone pitches. The volume for each harmonic can be fixed or dynamic, and interpolated harmonic scanning enables dramatic sweeps and melodious sequences.\n\nOctave Cat\n\nCherry Audio’s Octave Cat synthesizer emulates the duophonic CAT synthesizer unleashed by Octave Electronics in 1976. Developed in partnership with The CAT’s original designer, Octave Cat retains all the growl of the original hardware’s fat, savage sound and replicates its aggressive resonant filter. Octave Cat features the flexible modulation, screaming audio-range oscillator cross-mod, and fierce oscillator sync of the original hardware, and extends it with expanded polyphony, a robust integrated effects suite, and a versatile dual-step sequencer.\n\nNovachord + Solovox\n\nNovachord + Solovox is a collection of two virtual synthesizer instruments emulating the forerunners of mass-produced synthesizers. Novachord is based on the revolutionary polyphonic instrument from 1939 that used a staggering 163 vacuum tubes and 1,000 custom capacitors. Solovox replicates a related monophonic keyboard instrument intended to provide organ-type lead accompaniment. Together, these now exceedingly rare instruments set standards for tone generation and synthesis techniques that continue to influence today’s electronic instruments.\n\nMercury-6\n\nMercury-6 is a meticulous recreation of the Jupiter-6 analog polyphonic synthesizer, initially released in 1983. Sandwiched between the earlier Jupiter-4 and Jupiter-8 models in name only, the sophisticated Jupiter-6 has sometimes been considered a sleeper release. These days, it has persevered to become one of Roland's most notable and coveted classic synthesizers due to its distinctive dark and complex character. If you've long yearned to explore the Jupiter-6, you'll love Mercury-6!\n\nGX-80\n\nChosen by MusicRadar Readers as the Best Software Synthesizer of 2022! GX-80 is Cherry Audio's visionary flagship synthesizer, over a year in the making. GX-80 is a transformative virtual instrument that combines the unparalleled sound and features of the fabled GX-1 “Dream Machine” and its renowned descendant the CS-80, to create a powerhouse hybrid.\n\nSines\n\nSines is a sensational and innovative original polyphonic synthesizer. Employing four sine-wave oscillators, Sines utilizes diverse waveshaping methods to bend these pure waveforms into infinitely variable and complex shapes. When combined with its wide-ranging modulation capabilities and effects, users can create a distinctive array of unique timbres ranging from the sublime to sizzling.\n\nElka-X\n\nA Computer Music 10/10! Cherry Audio's Elka-X synthesizer is based upon the legendary Synthex, a rare Italian masterpiece with luxury features. Elka-X replicates the stunning sonic character of the original synth, thoughtfully expands its extraordinary functionality, and delivers the authentic Synthex experience at a price anyone can afford.\n\nGalactic Reverb\n\nGalactic Reverb is an algorithmic reverb plugin that captures the expansive sound of coveted classic hardware digital reverbs. With a decay time up to 35 seconds, it enables users to create massive, beautiful aural spaces. Galactic is a natural for transporting guitars, drums, keys, and even vocals into an extraterrestrial ambience.\n\nRackmode Signal Processors\n\nRackmode is a bundle of seven effects and an instrument plugin that replicate the classic rack-mounted Moog Signal Processors of the 1970s and ‘80s. The collection includes Vocoder (instrument and effect), Phaser, Ring Modulator, String Filter, Frequency Shifter, Graphic EQ, and Parametric EQ. This exclusive collection is the first time this entire line of renowned analog treasures has been recreated as virtual effects. It captures not only the deep sounds and capabilities of the original Signal Processor line, but also the elegant look and heritage of the rack-mounted enclosures.\n\nQuadra\n\nThe Cherry Audio Quadra is a super-accurate and immensely improved emulation of the ARP Quadra synthesizer, originally released in 1978 - a rare and coveted “unicorn” instrument in the synthesizer world, reproduced for the first time as a virtual instrument.\n\nStardust 201\n\nStardust 201 Tape Echo is a hot-rodded interpretation of the classic tape echo effects of the 70s and 80s. Compared to earlier tape echoes, they represented a giant leap in reliability and sound quality. With solidly built tape-transport mechanisms and the inclusion of a spring reverb and chorus effects in some models, the classic tape echo boxes were truly groundbreaking with its fantastic variety of sound colors.\n\nMercury-4\n\nMercury-4 is a detailed emulation of one of the best-sounding and quirkiest polyphonic synthesizers of the late 1970's, the Roland Jupiter-4. It’s the rarest and most sonically unique of the fabled Jupiter series, and we’ve gone to great lengths to recreate the subtle (and not-so-subtle) nuances and character of this beloved classic. Every aspect of Mercury-4 has been expertly modeled upon a vintage Jupiter-4 originally owned by Greg Hawkes of the legendary 80’s new wave band The Cars, and played on their double-platinum 1981 album Shake It Up. In Greg’s words, Mercury-4 “sounds just like my old Jupiter! It’s nice to have it back.”\n\nMemorymode\n\nMemorymode is based upon one of the very best-sounding polyphonic programmable analog synthesizers of the 80s - the legendary Memorymoog synthesizer. Released in 1982, the Memorymoog raised the sonic bar with its lush, powerful analog sound. Memorymode was expertly modeled upon a vintage Memorymoog originally owned by jazz legend Chick Corea. It expands upon the original without compromising any of the sound or functionality that made it great, and does away with the reliability, maintenance, and tuning issues of the original.\n\nPS-20\n\nThe PS-20 truly is one of the most quirky and unique instruments we’ve released. Between its sometimes unpredictable filter behavior, and the tremendous flexibility of its patch panel and sequencer, the possibilities are endless, and the creative \"happy accident\" quotient of PS-20 is simply off the charts!\n\nEight Voice\n\nEight Voice polyphonic synthesizer meticulously emulates the immense sound of the Oberheim® Eight Voice, one of the world’s rarest and most desirable vintage instruments. Predating modern microprocessor control, its eight independent dual-oscillator voice modules could be challenging to program. Cherry Audio Eight Voice’s unique Voice Link controls allow simple and powerful grouping of voice module controls, eliminating individually setting each module's controls when homogenous poly sounds are desired. All in all, we’ve transformed the original’s daunting user interface into a fun and inviting mondo polysynth experience.\n\nPolymode Synthesizer\n\nPolymode is inspired by the groundbreaking Moog Polymoog synthesizer. One of the world’s first polyphonic synthesizers, its unique multiple parallel filter implementation and mod routings give it a sound like no other synth. And though the original Polymoog sounded incredible, it could be challenging to operate and was prone to breakdowns. Cherry Audio’s Polymode sidesteps all of the drawbacks of the original instrument and massively expands its capabilities.\n\nSurrealistic MG-1 Plus\n\nThe fun and funky Surrealistic MG-1 Plus Synthesizer is a super authentic recreation of the Realistic MG-1 synthesizer sold in Radio Shack stores in the 80's. The Surrealistic MG-1 Plus delivers fat analog tone in spades, along with a unique polyphonic oscillator section, \"bell tone\" ring modulation, glide, auto repeat note triggering, oscillator sync, and a number of improvements that tremendously expand its capabilities. Best of all, it's absolutely FREE!\n\nCA2600\n\nThe Cherry Audio CA2600 is a powerful, self-contained duophonic synthesizer inspired by the groundbreaking ARP 2600 synthesizer. Every aspect of the original, from the quirky oscillator waves, to the powerful ladder filter, to the external audio input and preamp section was modeled with tremendous precision.\n\nDCO-106\n\nRecreating the sound of a classic synthesizer is no easy task. DCO-106 lovingly recreates the unique sonic footprint of one of the most iconic 80’s polysynths in exhaustive detail, while adding modern features for massively expanded creativity. The DCO-106 is both easy to understand and powerful to explore, creating a massive array of sonic landscapes, cutting lead sounds, warm and hazy pads, punchy synthetic electro drums, and far more.\n\nVoltage Modular\n\nVoltage Modular 2 obliterates all patching limitations, and introduces groundbreaking new ways to build complex patches with fewer cables.
