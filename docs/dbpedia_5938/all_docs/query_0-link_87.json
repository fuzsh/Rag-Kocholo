Very beautiful view of the mountains. Showers, toilets available. Restaurant with bar and games open until 11 p.m. Very quiet. Bus stop nearby to go up to the village of Anzère or to the ski lifts. There are buses every hour and the station is 5 minutes away.\n\nA natural location where each guest can choose their place on a first-come, first-parked basis. Access to fast Wifi, shower and toilets are included in the price. Our restaurant convinces with local specialties and meat from our own butcher's shop, delicious salads and vegan dishes as well as homemade jams and cakes. Electrical connection available. Please bring a cable reel and a Swiss adapter. Access in summer up to 8 tons. No camping trailers. Open from the end of May to October depending on the snow situation and the state of the roads. Do not follow the GPS after reaching Champex-Lac. Take the paved road 50 to the left of the Arpette lift station.\n\nCamping des Glaciers: Our campsite is situated in a unique alpine setting surrounded by rich flora and fauna. At the edge of a glacial torrent and in front of an impressive mountain landscape, it is very quiet and many walks and hikes start right at the campsite. We are on the route of the “Tour du Mt-Blanc” walking trail.\n\nParking spaces on a large open meadow at the foot of the Col du Simplon. Central starting point for many outdoor activities in the Aletsch and Simplon regions. Ideal for paraglider pilots, as there are 3 flying areas in the immediate vicinity and landing in front of the camper is possible. Also well equipped for mountain bikers. There is a small kitchen, toilet and shower, fresh water and a refrigerator available. A fireplace and a shelter invite you to stroll. You live directly with me in the garden in front of the flying school. If you are interested in a tandem paragliding flight, do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to your visit Raoul"
