        "text": "How it works?\n\nHow Does Activation Lock Bypass Work?\n\nThe Activation Lock is one of the most common issues iPhone and iPad users may experience. If you have an iCloud-locked device, you must submit your Apple ID and password to unlock your gadget. But if you don't know the correct login credentials, you get stuck with a locked iPhone or iPad.\n\nThe iRemove Software currently supports any iCloud-locked Apple device equipped with processors from the A5 up to the latest A15 Bionic CPU. This means you can bypass Activation Lock on devices ranging from the iPhone 5S to the iPhone 13 Pro Max models.\n\nBypass iCloud on iPhone 5s to X Models:\n\nThe iRemove software utilizes the Checkm8 exploit, which is also used in the Checkra1n jailbreak, to bypass the Activation Lock on iPhone models from the 5s up to the X (A5 - A11 Bionic CPU) running on the latest supported iOS 16.7.8 version.\n\nAttention! Due to the latest Apple security update, the iCloud Bypass for iPhone 6S up to X models is temporarily unavailable. We are working on fixing this issue!\n\nThis jailbreak removes software restrictions imposed by Apple on the iOS operating system and is used to prepare iPhone devices with A5 to A11 Bionic CPUs for the iCloud bypass process. The Checkra1n jailbreak is already integrated into the iRemove software.\n\nAfter ordering a license, you will be able to use the bypass tool and remove iCloud from your device immediately!\n\nBypass iCloud on iPhone XR/XS/XS Max to 15 Pro Max Models:\n\nIf you want to bypass iCloud on your A12+ iPhone, from the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, you're in the right place. The ordering process has been made more user-friendly with the new iRemove software update! No jailbreak is required for iPhone and iPad equipment with A12+ Bionic CPUs!\n\nJust connect your iCloud-locked device, and the software will automatically check its compatibility and offer you a software license. The Activation Lock bypass for A12+ models works on iOS versions 17.4 through 17.6.1\n\nAttention! Please note that SIM-locked, refurbished, and replaced devices are not supported.\n\nOrder Service\n\nHow to Use iRemove Activation Lock Bypass Tool?\n\nThe iRemove software is easy to use! Here are the three simple steps to prepare your iPhone or iPad for iCloud Activation screen bypass. The software works on Mac and Windows PC.\n\nDownload and Install software. To start bypassing the Activation Lock on your locked device, first, check if your device is compatible. Follow the on-screen tips or refer to our complete guide. If your device is supported, you will be redirected to the checkout page.\n\nATTENTION!\n\nIf you've ordered a license for iPhone XR/XS/XS Max up to 15 Pro Max, you'll need to wait for an order completion response for 12 to 72 hours before you can start using the software. Usually it takes less then 24h!\n\nAll batches typically respond the next day after noon UTC +0. Please note that there may be delays on Sundays and certain holidays.\n\nWe will notify you about the order status change to complete via email, as indicated on the order form. Alternatively, you can check the status online or reconnect your device to the iRemove software, which will display a completion status notification.\n\nNote: We notify our clients about the readiness of the order queue on our Telegram channel. You can also get order status information through our Telegram Bot by simply indicating the IMEI number of your device to receive its complete status.\n\nCheck Order Status\n\nJoin the Telegram Channel\n\nTelegram Bot\n\nNOTE: The A12+ iCloud bypass orders are non-refundable until your order has been processed!\n\n⚠️ Due to the latest Apple patch, device notifications, FaceTime, Apple Pay and iMessage won't work in this release. We are working on fixing this issue. ⚠️\n\nMake Payment. After your payment is cleared, your IMEI or Serial will be added to the iRemove Tools Database. Please note that the license is provided for one locked device, with the IMEI or Serial Number recorded in the iRemove Database.\n\nWe accept different payment methods, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Cryptocurrency (USDT, BTC) and Z3X credits. Our service provides a 100% refund guarantee.\n\nBypass iCloud Activation Lock. Reconnect your device and click the Start button. Please wait until your device reboots. The iRemove tool will notify you that the iCloud Activation Lock screen bypass has been completed successfully!\n\nAfter the Activation Lock bypass is completed on iPhone or iPad, your device will be completely operable. You can use your Apple ID on it, install apps from the App Store, make and receive calls, surf the internet, and have no restrictions."
