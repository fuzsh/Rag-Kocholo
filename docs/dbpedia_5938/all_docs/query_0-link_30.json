        "text": "ThAr Spectral Atlas - Photron Lamp\n\n(3230Å - 10540Å)\n\nWhen the Westinghouse-style hollow cathode lamps became unavailable a few years ago, Photron lamps were readily available and have replaced most of the older lamps on Kitt Peak. These have somewhat different spectral line intensities which prompted the construction of a new ThAr atlas. The line list for this atlas is the same as for the Westinghouse lamp line list (see below), however not all the lines in that list may be present in the Photron lamp spectra. Users of high-resolution spectrographs may want to consult the Westinghouse lamp web page since it has about four times the resolution of the Photron atlas.\n\nThis atlas consists of one long data file covering the wavelength region from 3,230Å - 10,540Å. The data were obtained using grating A with the Kitt Peak National Observatory 2.1m coude spectrograph . The light source was a Photron hollow cathode lamp, model P858AQ. The Tektronics 2k x 2k CCD T2KB was used as the detector. The data were extracted, and dispersion corrected using standard IRAF software. No attempt was made to establish an absolute intensity scale over the whole range of wavelengths. A line list is also available with identifications from Palmer and Engleman (1983) for Th and from Norlén (1973) for Ar.\n\nλ Range (Å) Order Filter Resolution (λ/dλ) 3230 - 3630 3 UG11+CuSo4 16,093 3630 - 4230 3 BG3+CuSo4 \" 4230 - 5470 2 4-96 18,189 5470 - 6965 2 GG475 \" 6965 - 8100 2 RG610 \" 8100 - 10540 1 RG610 13,075\n\nDownloads: ThAr spectral atlas (FITS) and Line list (TXT)\n\nThAr Spectral Atlas - Westinhouse Lamp\n\n(3005Å - 10598Å)\n\nThis atlas consists of one long data file covering the wavelength region from 3005Å to 10598Å. Most of the data (3,262Å - 10,598Å) was extracted from a series of echelle spectra obtained with the Kitt Peak National Observatory 2.1m coude spectrograph in echelle/grism mode at a resolution (lambda/dlambda) of approximately 75,000. The region from 3005Å to 3262Å was below the useful range of the grism cross dispersers and was obtained with the \"A\" grating in third order at a resolution of 12,000. The light source was a Westinghouse Corporation hollow cathode lamp, model WL-23418 with a quartz output window. The Ford 3k x 1k CCD F3KB was used as the detector. The data were calibrated, extracted, and dispersion corrected using standard IRAF software. No attempt was made to establish an absolute intensity scale over the whole range of wavelengths, but the echelle blaze function is largely removed on a local intra-order level. A line list is also available with identifications from Palmer and Engleman (1983) for Th and from Norlén (1973) for Ar.\n\nDownloads: ThAr spectral atlas (FITS) and Line list (TXT)\n\nIron Argon Spectral Atlas\n\n(3000Å - 10900Å)\n\nThe FeAr hollow cathode spectrum can be useful at intermediate resolutions (e.g. lambda/dlambda = 5000 - 40000) as a wavelength comparison source. It has more intense lines in the blue than CuAr or HeNeAr, but is not as rich as ThAr. These spectra were obtained with the KPNO 2.1 m coude spectrograph configured with grating \"B\", camera 5, and the F3KB (3072 x 1024 pixels) CCD. First, second and third orders were used yielding resolutions of 0.44 Å/pix, 0.22 Å/pix, and 0.14 Å/pix respectively. The Fe wavelengths are from Crosswhite (1975) and the Ar from Norlén (1973). Dispersion solutions were fit to the spectra with the IRAF identify task using Legendre polynomials of order 3 - 5. The rms fit was typically about 0.01 Å. The atlas consists of one long data file covering the wavelength region from 3000Å to 10900Å. A list of the lines shown here may be found in the IRAF noaolib$linelists directory.\n\nDownloads: FeAr spectral atlas (FITS) and Line list (TXT)\n\nHelium Neon Argon Spectral Atlas\n\n(3300Å - 11100Å)\n\nThese spectra were obtained with the KPNO 2.1 m coude spectrograph, camera number 5 and grating BL181 from the 4m RC spectrograph. This combination gives a dispersion of 0.35Å per pixel in second order (3300Å - 5000Å), and 0.69Å per pixel in first order (5500Å - 11,100Å). The 1024 x 1024 CCD T1KA was used to obtain the spectra. Identifications are given for mostly unblended lines but different resolutions will yield varying degrees of blending. For critical work, the references listed below should be consulted. Initial identifications were found in Striganov and Sventitskii (1968), with final wavelengths for argon from Norlén (1973), neon from Crosswhite (1975), and helium from Striganov and Sventitskii (1968). Dispersion solutions were fit to the spectra with the IRAF identify routine using Legendre polynomials of order 3 - 5. The rms fit was typically about 0.01Å. There are some lines which appear sharp and unblended, but are actually close blends of a few tenths angstrom separation. These have not been labeled on the plots. A list of all the lines shown here may be found in the IRAF noaolib$linelists directory.\n\nDownloads: HeNeAr spectral atlas (FITS) and Line list (TXT)\n\nCopper Argon Spectral Atlas\n\n(3000Å - 10900Å)\n\nThe CuAr spectrum is used mainly for low to intermediate resolution spectroscopy as a wavelength source for dispersion solutions. These spectra were obtained with the KPNO 2.1 m coude spectrograph configured with grating \"B\", camera 5, and the T2KB (2048 x 2048 pixels) CCD. First, second and third orders were used yielding resolutions of 0.70 A/pix, 0.35 A/pix, and 0.23 A/pix respectively. Wavelengths for the few lines of Cu are from THE MIT Wavelength Tables (1969) and Ar from Norl'en (1973). Dispersion solutions were fit to the spectra with the IRAF IDENTIFY task using Legendre polynomials of order 3 - 5. The rms fit was typically about 0.1 pixel per line. The atlas consists of one long data file covering the wavelength region from 3000A to 10900A. A list of the lines shown here may be found in the IRAF noaolib$linelists directory. Since most of the lines are from Ar, only the few Cu lines are labeled under Line Identity.\n\nDownloads: CuAr spectral atlas (FITS) and Line list (TXT)\n\nReferences"
