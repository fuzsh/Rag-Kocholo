        "text": "A WORLD OF INSPIRING NEW SOUNDS FOR DRUMMERS\n\nWith V-Drums, the preset kits are just the beginning. There’s now an easy way to access the full sonic potential of your V-Drums module. Roland Cloud, our ever-growing online platform for musicians, is full of fresh content for every drummer. There are downloadable kits for your V-Drums, one-shot samples, play-along Jam Tracks, software-based virtual instruments, and coaching tools with plenty more to come.\n\nGo beyond the presets—break the sound barrier with V-Drums x Roland Cloud.\n\nKit Packs are collections of drum kit sounds, ready-made for you to download and install into your V-Drums module. While the factory preset kits offer a generalized selection of sounds, Kit Packs feature customized sounds that are tuned for particular music genres and playing styles. You can organize and store Kit Packs on your computer and swap them in and out of your module as much as you like via an SD card.\n\nKit Packs provide a selection of complete drum sets that you can load into your module. The internal instruments and onboard editing tools have been used to craft ready-to-play sounds with the full range of tonal and dynamic expression you expect from a professional drum kit. Kit Packs may also contain samples that are specially developed for layering with certain internal sounds. Each Kit Pack collection is designed for use with a specific V-Drums module.\n\nSample Packs are collections of one-shot samples and phrase loops in WAV audio format. These sounds can be loaded into a Roland percussion pad such as the SPD-SX or any V-Drums module that supports sample import. You can also import them into a DAW and use them within your computer music production workflow. In a V-Drums module, a one-shot can be used on its own or layered with other sounds, and it can sound louder or quieter depending on how hard you hit a pad. But unlike the internal V-Drums instruments, there are no tonal changes with different playing dynamics.\n\nA virtual instrument is a software-based musical instrument that runs on a computer, either standalone or as a plug-in within a DAW environment. Some virtual instruments available on Roland Cloud are recreations of hardware synthesizers and drum machines from Roland’s legendary history, while others are all-new instruments built with our latest technologies. To play a virtual instrument, you need to send MIDI messages to the software. With a V-Drums module or SPD-SX sample pad, you can send these messages via a single USB cable and play the sounds in real time from the pads.\n\nKit Packs contain downloadable files designed to be installed in a specific V-Drums module. Once loaded via an SD card, they provide additional drum kits that complement the preset kits that come with your module.\n\nSample Packs contain one-shot sounds and phrase loops in WAV audio format, and they can be used in a variety of ways. You can load them into a Roland percussion pad such as the SPD-SX or any V-Drums module that supports sample import. You can also import them into a DAW and use them within your computer music production workflow."
