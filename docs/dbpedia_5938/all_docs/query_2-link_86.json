        "text": "Ever since the release of Netflix’s Heeramandi, Sharmin Segal, who played the role of Alamzeb, has been garnering severe criticism for her performance in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s web series. While she has been the talk of the town, very few people know about her husband Aman Mehta, who has an insane net worth of Rs 53,800 crore.\n\nAman Mehta, who tied the knot with Sharmin Segal in November 2023,Â works as an Executive Director for Torrent Pharmaceuticals, a division of Torrent Group. The firm’s portfolio include Torrent Pharma, Torrent Power, Torrent Cables, Torrent Gas, and Torrent Diagnostics.\n\nHeadquartered in Ahmedabad, it was founded by U. N. Mehta in 1959. The in-charge of Torrent Group are Aman’s father, Samir Mehta, and his brother, Sudhir Mehta.\n\nAs per Bloomberg’s Index, the net worth of Aman’s father Samir Mehta is humongous $6.44 billion (about Rs 53,800 crore) as of 2024. Torrent Pharma made $4.6 billion in revenue, or about Rs 38,412 crore as per a Forbes report.\n\nTalking about Aman’s education qualification, he has studied MBA at Columbia Business School and received a bachelor’s degree in economics from Boston University, both in the United States of America.\n\nOn the other hand, Sharmin also comes from a reputed family. While her father is the head of content at the well-known production company Applause Entertainment, her mother Bela Segal is a well-known film editor and has worked on films like Khamoshi, Devdas, and Black. She made her directorial debut in 2012 with Boman Irani and Farah Khan starrer Shirin Farhad Ki To Nikal Padi.\n\nSanjay Leela Bhansali is Sharmin’s maternal uncle and produced her Bollywood debut Malaal, which marked the first appearance of Meezaan."
