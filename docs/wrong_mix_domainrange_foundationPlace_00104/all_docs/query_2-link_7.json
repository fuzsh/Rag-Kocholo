        "text": "Real World Java 9 - JetBrains Webinar\n\nReal World Java 9 - JetBrains WebinarTrisha Gee\n\nThe feature we always hear about whenever Java 9 is in the news is Jigsaw, modularity. But this doesn't scratch the same developer itch that Java 8's lambdas and streams did, and we're left with a vague sensation that the next version might not be that interesting. Java 9 actually has a lot of great additions and changes to make development a bit nicer. These features can't be lumped under an umbrella term like Java 8's lambdas and streams, the changes are scattered throughout the APIs and language features that we regularly use. In this presentation Trisha will show, via live coding: - What the Java Platform Module System is and how to make your code modular - How we can use the new Flow API to utilise Reactive Programming - The improvements to the Streams API that make it easier to control infinite streams - How to the Collections convenience methods simplify code Along the way we'll bump into other Java 9 features, including some of the additions to interfaces and changes to deprecation.\n\nAn individual's carbon footprint........\n\nAn individual's carbon footprint........Esgagile\n\nAs a Carbon footprint consultancy in Agile Advisors, measuring each person's carbon footprint aims to make each person responsible for their share of greenhouse gas emissions. It seeks to persuade people to live more sustainably and make decisions that benefit the environment. However, businesses and large-scale commercial activities are the primary sources of most of the world's greenhouse gas emissions rather than private individuals. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that roughly 100 enterprises globally account for over 70% of carbon dioxide emissions. This startling figure shows that no person's efforts can end the global catastrophe alone. However, on a smaller scale, our individual decisions do matter. Adopting sustainable practices by a group of people can have a cascading effect that affects more prominent organizations and changes policies. Ocean circulation and solar reflectance are two global-scale feedbacks that are linked to changes in the cryosphere. Agile Advisors provides Carbon footprint consultancy In Dubai, the amount of carbon that exists on Earth remains constant. When dinosaurs walked the Earth millions of years ago, it was precisely the same as it is now. The atmosphere, oceans, and living things contain the remaining carbon, primarily stored in reservoirs or sinks, such as rocks and sediments. When plants and animals breathe, carbon is released back into the atmosphere. An essential component of all life on Earth is carbon—the fundamental element of life; carbon aids in forming living things' bodies. Its compounds form gases, liquids, and solids. While lowering one's carbon footprint is something that people should aim to do, addressing the structural problems that lead to climate catastrophe is also crucial. In order to contribute, governments, businesses, and other organizations must implement policies that support renewable energy, invest in environmentally friendly infrastructure, and control emissions from large enterprises. We are Carbon footprint consultancy In UAE, Carbon dioxide, carbonate, and hydrogen carbonate comprise the bulk of inorganic carbon. Carbon is constantly moving in both directions between the organic and inorganic forms. Inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon from its oxidized form when photosynthesis occurs. Airborne oxygen can oxidize organic carbon, mainly by respiration (breathing). The Earth's crust contains more than 99 per cent of the carbon involved in the carbon cycle. Most of this carbon is biological, having been deposited on the ocean floor by the skeletal remains of numerous marine animals that employ calcium carbonate to make their shells and skeletons. These deposits could eventually consolidate into limestone. The equilibrium between CO2 sources and sinks—sources release CO2, while sinks take in and store it—determines the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere."
