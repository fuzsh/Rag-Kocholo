        "text": "List Of Open-source Programs (LOOP) for Microsoft Windows Operating Systems\n\nWhat is the LOOP list?\n\nThis is a list of the best open-source applications that run on Windows. Feel free to edit this list and add any programs that meet the criteria below. The purpose of this list is to demonstrate the quality of open-source applications and advocate the open source software development model. To learn more, read the FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTell all your non-Linux friends and family about the LOOP list. On this list they will find free, high-quality replacements for the software that they have purchased/pirated. Once they become familiar with these new applications, introduce them to your favorite Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu. Then help them convert to Linux, using the same applications that they became familiar with on Windows.\n\nRules for adding programs to the LOOP list:\n\nMust be open-source.\n\nMust run natively on Microsoft Windows operating systems.\n\nOnly include the best application for each specific purpose.

applications are awesome! I can't believe that they are free! How can I help to support these applications?\n\nThat is a terrific question. If these programs provide value to you, it makes sense to give something back to the community. The best way to do this may be different for each application, so read more at the project's website. In general, here are ways that you can give back to the open-source community:\n\nInstall and use the program, then share your experiences (good or bad) with the project mailing list.\n\nSubscribe to the project mailing list and answer questions that users are asking.\n\nShare any ideas you have about the software, such as features that you would like to see implemented or any changes that you think would improve the project.\n\nCreate documentation about the project, such as how to install, configure, and use the application.\n\nIf you are a programmer, look at the code and report any bugs you find and share any improvements that you make.\n\nSome projects provide a way to contribute money to the project.\n\nTell everyone you know about the application and help them start using it.\n\nThe great thing about contributing to an open-source project is that you will be helping everyone who uses the software. If users give back to the project, there will be a constant improvement in the quality of the application. Here are some ideas on how to Participate, from Ubuntu.\n\nWhy do you only include open-source applications? Why not include applications that are free, but not open-source?\n\nThe goal of the LOOP list is to demonstrate the quality of open-source software and the advantages of the open-source development model. There are many high-quality free applications, but they do not have the same advantages of the open-source development model.\n\nYou keep talking about the advantages of the open-source software development model. What are they?\n\nThe easiest to explain advantage is the concept of shared cost. In the traditional software development model, many different software companies each create their own version of a software application, such as a word processor. When a customer buys the software, they are only contributing to one of these versions. With the open-source model, all resources that are spent on an open-source project will benefit everyone who uses the application. There are many advantages to open-source, which you can learn about by visiting the links below.\n\nThe Economics of Open-Source Software\n\nThe Myths of Open Source Software\n\nAdvantages of Open-Source Software\n\nArguments about Open-Source\n\nSome of these applications only run on Windows, and not Linux. Why do you include these?\n\nThe goal of the LOOP list is to demonstrate the advantages of open-source applications. One of those advantages is the ability to port the application to other operating systems. This means that anyone with the time, skill, and desire can port these applications to Linux or any other operating system. It is also likely that these applications will run in Linux using Wine (http://www.winehq.com/).\n\nWhy don't you include applications that only run on Linux? These Linux applications are open-source, so they could be ported to Windows, right?\n\nThat is true, but an overwhelming majority of people use Windows operating systems. If these people knew they could keep their applications, they would be more likely to switch to a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu Linux).\n\nI disagree with the applications that were chosen for a particular category. How can I make my case for another application?\n\nYou can debate the pros and cons of each application on the LoopListDebate page.\n\nWhy did you create a new list? There are other lists out there with similar information.\n\nThis list serves a specific purpose, which is listed at the top of this page. Other lists on the web have good information, but they were not what I was looking for. Here are some projects similar to the LOOP list:\n\nNote: These links are not part of the LOOP list. They do not follow the guidelines defined for the LOOP list. Links are included only as a reference to efforts similar to the LOOP list.\n\nWindows\n\nOpen Source\n\nThe OSSwin project: Open-Source for Windows\n\nhttp://osswin.sourceforge.net/\n\nOpensource list - Open Source Software in a Windows Environment\n\nhttp://www.opensourcelist.org/oss/suggestedapplications.html\n\nSoftware: Open Source & Free for Windows\n\nhttp://www.alessandropagano.net/software_en.html\n\nThe table of equivalents / replacements of Windows software in Linux\n\nhttp://www.linuxrsp.ru/win-lin-soft/table-eng.html\n\nWinLibre - Free Software for Windows\n\nhttp://www.winlibre.com/en/index.php\n\nGnuWin32 - Ports of GNU or Open Source tools\n\nhttp://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/\n\nOpen Source GIS (Geographical Information Systems) Software\n\nhttp://opensourcegis.org/ and http://freegis.org/\n\nOpen and Free Project Management Tools\n\nhttp://proj.chbs.dk/\n\nOpen and Free Financial Accounting Systems\n\nhttp://proj.chbs.dk/accounting/\n\nThe Top 50 Proprietary Programs that Drive You Crazy ‚Äî and Their Open Source Alternatives\n\nhttp://whdb.com/blog/2008/the-top-50-proprietary-programs-that-drive-you-crazy-and-their-open-source-alternatives/\n\nCompilations on a CD\n\nTTCS OSSWIN CD - A collection of nearly 100 Free/Open Source software for Microsoft Windows\n\nhttp://www.ttcsweb.org/osswin-cd/\n\nThe Open CD - A collection of high quality Free and Open Source Software.\n\nhttp://www.theopencd.org/\n\nOpen Source Software CD ‚Äî A CD that contains high-quality, Free, open source software for Microsoft Windows\n\nhttp://osscd.sunsite.dk/\n\nGratis\n\nOpen Source Free CD - A compilation of gratis software for Windows.
