Although Subversion is designed primarily for software developers, it can be useful to mere mortals as well.\n\nSubversion is a so-called version control system, which means it allows users to track changes to files. Many users do not realize you can use Subversion as a versioning tool for ordinary user files, such as word processing\n\ndocuments. Subversion also allows you to compare different versions of a document and roll back to a previous version. The tool is file-type agnostic, which means it can handle any file you throw at it – plain text files, Writer documents, spreadsheets, PNG graphics – and other common file types you will find on your Linux system."
