For further information on his life and works, see CLR, Volumes 1 and 26.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThough he wrote in a variety of genres for adult readers, Milne is remembered almost exclusively for his four notable children's books. Ostensibly written for his young son Christopher Robin Milne, the verse volumes When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We Are Six (1927) each consist of short, lighthearted poems for children, of which \"Vespers\" is perhaps the most famous. The latter mentions Christopher Robin by name, and several of the poems allude to the boy's prized toy bear. This stuffed animal—who has become one of the best known characters in Western literature—appears as the protagonist of Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), which depicts the adventures of Pooh and his animal friends in an idyllic forest known as the Hundred-Acre Wood. Christopher Robin, Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, and the other residents of the Wood reappeared in 1928's The House at Pooh Corner. Though his creations were judged on a level with Lewis Carroll's, and his children's works were often ranked above those of such noted contemporaries as J. M. Barrie and Kenneth Grahame, Milne aspired to be remembered as an author of \"serious\" novels, essays, and plays for adults. Nonetheless, thanks to the legacy of Pooh, a silly and self-centered yet oddly generous bear, ruled as much by his heart as by his stomach, Milne's writing for children holds an exalted place in world literature.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\n\nBorn in London on January 18, 1882, Milne was the youngest of schoolmaster John Vine Milne's three sons. As a child, he attended Henley House, the preparatory school at which his father was headmaster. One of his tutors at Henley was H. G. Wells, who would later go on to his own literary fame with such science-fiction classics as The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds. Wells and Milne would remain lifelong friends, with Wells offering his young protégé advice throughout his career. At age eleven, Milne was awarded a scholarship to attend the elite Westminster School in the fall of 1893. At Westminster, Milne excelled at mathematics, later earning his B.A. with honors in the subject from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1903. During his tenure at Cambridge, Milne edited the school magazine, Granta, and his work so impressed R. C. Lehmann of the noted humorist publication Punch that Lehmann asked Milne to begin submitting sketches to the magazine. In 1906 he was hired as an assistant editor at Punch and soon began writing a weekly column. Milne first established himself as a writer of humorous essays, and out of this reputation, he was able to publish his first book, a series of fictional sketches titled Lovers inLondon (1905). In 1913 Milne married Dorothy Daphne De Selincourt and, seven years later, she gave birth to Christopher Robin, their only child. During World War I, Milne served as a signal officer for the British Army and composed his first play, Wurzel-Flummery, which was produced in 1917. The success of his 1919 play Mr. Pim Passes By ushered in the most fruitful decade of Milne's career, a period in which he wrote his four major children's books as well as his novel The Red House Mystery (1922) and several other notable publications. During this time, Milne enjoyed great fame, which continued thereafter, but almost exclusively on the merits of his Pooh books. In his latter years, he became increasingly bitter over his lack of success with literature for adults. A committed political Liberal, Milne campaigned ardently for an end to war. However, after the rise of Adolf Hitler, Milne revised one of his antiwar tracts, Peace with Honour (1934), to take account of the fact that there remained forms of tyranny that required armed opposition. Unfortunately, his literary successes were balanced by a growing distance between Milne and his son. Christopher, always leery of his place in the Pooh pantheon, had begun to resent his family, believing he had been taken advantage of by his father. In 1948 Christopher married his cousin Lesley de Selincourt, which enormously disappointed his parents, who both disapproved of the match and saw their hopes that he might marry his childhood friend Anne Darlington (who appeared in as a character in Milne's two books of poetry) dashed. In 1952 Milne suffered a debilitating stroke that completely incapacitated him. Nonetheless, he clung to life for another three years until he finally succumbed to his illness on January 31, 1956. In 1961 Daphne Milne sold the film rights to the Pooh property to the Walt Disney Company, who redesigned illustrator E. H. Shepard's original images of the characters. As a result, the two incarnations of the Pooh animals are designated as either \"Classic Pooh\" or \"Disney Pooh.\" For his part, Christopher Milne was able to finally come to terms with his role in the creation of the Pooh stories late in life and even contributed two valuable reflections about his father and his own Pooh legacy: The Enchanted Places (1974) and The Path through the Trees (1979).\n\nMAJOR WORKS\n\nMilne's first forays into writing for children began as an extension of his long-time passion for verse, the result of which was the spontaneously written poem \"Vespers\"—possibly Milne's most anthologized poem to date. A short poem drawn directly from Milne's observances of watching his son say his evening prayers, \"Vespers\" seems overly sentimental at first glance. But, in reality, the poem evinces some decidedly adult sensibilities in that the boy's poetic recitations are filled with asides that demonstrate that the child is saying his prayers only out of a sense of obligation because he knows his parents expect it of him. Lines like \"God bless Mummy. I know that's right\" and \"Oh, God bless Daddy—I quite forgot\" show a stubborn resistance to evening prayers that belie the seemingly overt saccharine qualities of the verse. Regardless, the poems in Milne's When We Were Very Young and Now We Are Six retain much of their tender disposition, demonstrating Milne's fond embrace of the child-like institutions of limitless excitement and the unimpeded enjoyment of life. These books also established another recurring theme for Milne: his insistence that his stories were not based exclusively on his son Christopher Robin. As he repeatedly told his readers, the characters in his verse collections and the Pooh books were based on a combination of elements from his own childhood, his imagination, and certain characteristics drawn from his only son. In such poems as \"Halfway Down\" and \"Disobedience\" Milne skillfully portrays—in economical and seemingly effortless verse—the varied world of childhood, in which the child focuses solely on the self and grown-ups act as meddlesome, if generally benign, outsiders.\n\nThis atmosphere pervades Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner, two works that depict an ideal world in which Pooh and his friends—Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit, Tigger, Owl, Kanga, and Roo—enjoy the freedoms of adulthood while maintaining the carefree qualities of childhood. The story of Christopher Robin's toys coming to life in the Hundred-Acre Wood, Winnie-the-Pooh attempts to create a comforting place for young readers where imagination and family are unifying concepts. Pooh and his animal compatriots act as a family even as they engage in such gentle adventures as trying to reach the North Pole, helping Eeyore find his lost tail, and assisting Pooh in outsmarting the bees so that he might illicitly dip into their honey. Despite the fact that the stories were named after their titular protagonist Pooh Bear, Christopher Robin is very much the central figure of the narratives. Father, protector, and the undeniable leader of his animal friends, Christopher Robin serves as the core of their merry band and the one that the others inevitably turn to for guidance and safety. However, Christopher Robin is still portrayed as a young boy and, most importantly, a growing boy—a poignant fact that emerges as a constant undercurrent to the Pooh stories. In Winnie-the-Pooh, he is seen primarily as a little boy free to escape into the forest to adventure and scheme with his friends. Taking a more prominent role in The House at Pooh Corner, Christopher Robin is now clearly on the verge of adolescence and his responsibilities have shifted, threatening to take him away from his childhood toys. Straddling both his role as little boy and father figure to Pooh and his brethren, Christopher is uncertain as to how his friends will fare without him and whether he should communicate his concerns. Towards the end of The House at Pooh Corner, as he loses his ability to do \"Nothing\", Christopher Robin asks his best friend, \"Pooh, whatever happens, you will understand, won't you?\" Pooh has no idea what Christopher is talking about. \"So they went off together,\" Milne concludes. \"But wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the Forest, a little boy and his Bear will always be playing.\"\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\nA romantic in the age of realism, Milne's essays and plays suggested literary sentimentalism and jaunty humor and, as a result, often struggled critically in the crosshairs of a burgeoning investment in the realist movement. Nonetheless, Milne was a popular writer, and his throwback style of gauzy sentimentalism and high fantasy were seen as perfectly suited for younger readers. Even so, as contemporary critics Catherine Kurkjian and Nancy Livingston have asserted, \"Milne did not write these stories for children; rather he intended them for the child within us all because of the wonderfully innocent view of the world they present. The stories allow us to remember what is truly important—friendship and love\". Despite the largely positive reviews of Milne's children's poetry and the Pooh books, there was some backlash, most notably by Dorothy Parker, whom famously skewered Milne's overtly maudlin aspirations and juvenile language in The New Yorker. Milne responded to her criticisms, remarking that \"no writer of children's books says gaily to his publisher, 'Don't bother about the children, Mrs. Parker will love it.'\" In the nearly eighty years since the first publication of Winnie-the-Pooh, Milne's \"Silly old Bear\" has become something of a cultural phenomenon, finding a second life in movies, songs, books, and a variety of other consumer goods. Originally, the Pooh stories received only limited critical analysis due to most scholars dismissing them as simple diversions for children. However, the 1963 publication of the essay collection The Pooh Perplex, edited by Frederick C. Crews, opened a new wave of popular analysis of Milne's juvenile stories. A low-key series of essays targeting college students, The Pooh Perplex examines the Pooh books from a variety of critical and scholarly perspectives. In the years since, Milne's Pooh stories have inspired several new avenues of literary scholarship which explore, among other themes, the familial relationships of the animal characters, aspects of the father-son relationship between Christopher Robin, Pooh, and Milne himself, Milne's reflections on his own childhood, religious iconography in the Pooh books, and the fading childhood of Christopher Robin and his fear of outgrowing his toy friends.\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\nChildren's Works\n\nOnce on a Time [illustrations by H.

A. Milne's Children's Verse.\" Children's Literature in Education 11, no. 2 (summer 1980): 52-61.\n\n[In the following essay, Sterck discusses Milne's poetic verse in When We Were Very Young and The House at Pooh Corner, noting how both volumes evince the \"balance between punctiliousness and sympathy which gives A. A. Milne's fantasy its individual signature.\"]\n\nI suppose it had never occurred to me that there was any problem of identity; after all, you only have to turn over the pages of When We Were Very Young and E. H. Shepard has the answer: Christopher Robin in coat and gaiters, in wellingtons, in sun hat and jersey, barefoot on the beach with his father, never was there a more authentically documented reality. And there the matter rested until the B.B.C. broadcasted last summer a series of readings from The Enchanted Places, a memoir by Christopher Milne. This made it clear that Christopher Robin was a more complex creation than usually supposed. It soon appeared that the search for Christopher Robin begins with his creator. The road leads from The Enchanted Places to It's Too Late Now and would have to go still further back for a full appreciation of A. A. Milne's talent. This piece is limited to his two books of verse for children.\n\nEchoes are strong over the years in the Milne family, especially in the attachments between father and son based on the strong affection of the father and the hero-worship of the child. Both autobiographies contain anecdotes in which relief from domestic tensions is sought in the solvent of a sympathetic humour. One tells about the prosperous time when A. A. Milne's father is the headmaster and owner of a successful preparatory school. His wife is in charge of the domestic arrangements and carves the meat.\n\nThe matron stands beside her, helping vegetables in an obviously inferior manner. She has just sent one of the boys upstairs to fetch something for her. The boy comes into the dining-room.\n\n\"Henry,\" says my father, \"you're late again.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Please, sir, it wasn't my fault—\"\n\n\"No excuses, Henry. You must put your chair away and stand.\"\n\nSo Henry eats his first course standing.\n\n\"All right, Henry, you may take your chair now.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, thank you, sir. Please, sir. Matron sent me upstairs for her spectacles just as I was coming in.\"\n\nAwed silence. \"Sucks for J. V.,\" The boys are thinking, \"he'll have to apologise.\" The younger assistant-masters look up anxiously. Do schoolmasters ever apologize? Isn't it bad for discipline?\n\n\"Then in that case,\" says my father, wishing to get it quite clear, \"it wasn't your fault you were late?\"\n\n\"Please, sir, no, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh\" (Everybody is waiting) \"Oh, well, then, you'd better take two chairs.\"\n\nAnd everybody laughs and is happy.(p. 17)1\n\nNothing could be more simply told, though the preference for dialogue over description is characteristic, but the whole incident is warmed by the admiration of the teller for his subject. The other refers to a time when A. A. Milne is a father, and his own son has taken a new-found interest in birdlife.\n\nI had been given a bird book for Easter (Easter 1934: I have the book still) and with its help I had made my first discovery. \"There's a black-bird's nest in the hole under the tiles just outside the drawingroom window,\" I announced proudly. \"I've just seen the blackbird fly in.\" \"I think it's probably really a starling,\" said my father. \"No, it's a blackbird,\" I said firmly, hating to be wrong, hating being corrected. \"Well,\" said my father, realizing how I felt but at the same time unable to allow an inaccuracy to get away with it, \"Perhaps it's a blackbird visiting a starling …\" He could never bear to be dogmatic, never bring himself to say (in effect): This is so because I say it is, and I am older than you and must know better. How much easier, how much nicer to escape into the world of fantasy in which he felt himself so happily at home.(p. 121)2\n\nWith this guidance, one can make a tentative answer to the question A. A. Milne puts in \"Just Before We Begin\" (the preface to When We Were Very Young ): \"Then there is another thing. You may wonder sometimes who is supposed to be saying the verses.\"\n\nWhen the story, however slightly sketched, could have a miserable ending, the King unhappy because there is no butter for his bread, Sir Brian Botany terrorising the villagers, a sad bear contemplating his stoutness, or the once-happy dormouse persecuted by his know-all doctor, and when all is resolved by the lightest of humorous touches,\n\nThe cow said\n\n\"There, there!\n\nI didn't really mean it;\n\nHere's milk for his porringer\n\nAnd butter for his bread.\"3\n\nI am Sir Brian? Oh, no!\n\nI am Sir Brian? Who's he?\n\nI haven't got any title, I'm Botany—\n\nPlain Mr. Botany (B)4\n\nBut do you think it worries him\n\nTo know that he is far from slim?\n\nNo just the other way about\n\nHe's proud of being short and stout.5\n\nor, if coming across a dormouse in a chrysanthemum bed,\n\nYou will find (so Aunt Emily says) that he lies\n\nFast asleep on his front with his paws to his eyes.6\n\nthen the teller is A. A. Milne, adult, and with his years of writing light verse for The Granta and Punch behind him. \"The Three Foxes\" and \"The Four Friends\" also belong to this group of poems where a small incident hovers on the brink of narrative and evokes the typical self-effacing humour,\n\nJames gave the huffle of a snail in danger\n\nand nobody heard him at all.7\n\nAlso A. A. Milne is clearly the teller of the small group of seven poems which share a nature/fantasy setting (\"Water-Lilies,\" \"Twinkletoes,\" \"Brownie,\" \"Shoes and Stockings,\" \"Knights and Ladies,\" \"The Mirror,\" and \"The Invaders\" ). They are marked by the commonplace observation of the city dweller at a loose end in the countryside, but the best achieve a fresh lyrical movement.\n\nWhere the water-lilies go\n\nTo and fro,\n\nRocking in the ripples of the water,\n\nLazy on a leaf lies the Lake King's daughter,\n\nAnd the faint winds shake her.\n\nWho will come and take her?\n\nI will! I will!\n\nKeep still! Keep still!\n\nSleeping on a leaf lies the Lake King's daughter …8\n\nHowever, the great bulk of the poems, some thirty out of the forty-four, invoke Christopher Robin directly or indirectly, and for help with these we must look again to the autobiographies. Whatever the emotional genesis of the poems, initially they were quite definitely unplanned. A. A. Milne describes how in January or February of 1923 he had wasted a morning from the serious business of playwriting in order to write \"Vespers.\" A few months later, he was asked by Rose Fyleman to contribute to a collection of children's verses she was editing. After an initial refusal, he relented and produced \"The Dormouse and the Doctor,\" so that two of the most popular poems in the collection, which exhibits a wide range of content, were in fact written before there was any idea of a volume.\n\nThat August was wet and the family were sharing a house in North Wales with friends. The proofs of \"The Dormouse\" arrived with the suggestion that a book of similar poems would be a good idea. Whether or not this was so, it afforded a good excuse to withdraw from the damp proximity of family and friends into the summerhouse. He says in It's Too Late Now : \"I had eleven wet days in that summer-house and wrote eleven sets of verses.\" By the end of the year he had forty-four poems, and was at the beginning of a richly creative period. By the time of the publication of The House at Pooh Corner in 1928, the child for whom the books had in part been written was eight years old and still in the nursery, where his nanny was the exclusive focus of his affection. It may come as a surprise that A. A. Milne's success as a children's writer was so unsought and, by himself, so unregarded; and whatever it was founded upon it was not, at that time, founded on close contact with his son.\n\nThere are two sorts of writer. There is the writer who is basically a reporter and there is the creative writer. The one draws on his experience, the other on his dreams. My father was a creative writer and so it was precisely because he was not able to play with his small son that his longings sought and found satisfaction in another direction. He wrote about him instead. (p. 36)9\n\nThus, one of the roles of Christopher Robin at this time is manifested in a personal fantasy of A. A. Milne, which the reader may miss because his eye has been taken by an E. H. Shepard illustration, taken from the life of the actual child. For example, in the poem \"The Island\" disregard the picture of the boy on the cliff top in favour of a dream child with whom A. A. Milne may escape present realities:\n\nIf I had a ship\n\nI'd sail my ship\n\nI'd sail my ship\n\nThrough Eastern seas;\n\nDown to a beach where the slow waves thunder—\n\nThe green curls over and the white falls under.10\n\nExplaining the personal pronoun in the titles of the two books of poems, Christopher Milne suggests that the verses were written to celebrate a double childhood. \"My father, who had derived such happiness from his childhood, found in me that companion with whom he could return there\" (p. 159). So that as well as the fantasy child, there is the projection of Christopher Robin as a surrogate for his own remembered infancy. These distinctions can be seen when they operate singly, though there is nothing to prevent their overlapping, consciously or otherwise. \"At the Zoo\" describes a familiar Londoner's outing to Regent's Park:\n\nThere are lions and roaring tigers, and enormous camels and things,\n\nThere are biffalo-buffalo-bisons, and a great big bear with wings,\n\nThere's a sort of a tiny potamus, and a tiny nosserus too—\n\nBut I gave buns to the elephant when I went down to the zoo!11\n\nIt is an equally clear attempt to put the outing in terms of a young child's experience and expression, even if the latter is now treated with suspicion. In the middle, as it were, are poems of a more generalised childhood experience applicable to father, son, and children everywhere.\n\nWhenever I walk in a London street,\n\nI'm ever so careful to watch my feet;\n\nAnd I keep in the squares,\n\nAnd the masses of bears,\n\nWho wait at the corners all ready to eat\n\nThe sillies who tread on the lines of the street,\n\nGo back to their lairs,\n\nAnd I say to them, \"Bears,\n\nJust look how I'm walking in all the squares!\"12\n\nSome, however, apply to father only and a good example is \"The Engineer\" in Now We Are Six.\n\nLet it rain!\n\nWho cares?\n\nI've a train\n\nUpstairs,\n\nWith a brake\n\nWhich I make\n\nFrom a string\n\nSort of thing,\n\nWhich works\n\nIn jerks,\n\n'Cos it drops\n\nIn the spring,\n\nWhich stops\n\nWith the string,13\n\nA. A. Milne's clumsiness was a family joke; \"give him a pear and he became moist up to the elbows, and a honey sandwich called for a bath\" (p. 115). On the other hand, Christopher Robin from an early age became a repair man about the house and reports, no doubt with justice, that if he had made a brake it would have worked. So, when it comes to trying to form a just estimate of particular poems, it is as well to remember the chameleon quality of Christopher Robin to change his nature with the circumstance. This may be tested in the case of \"Vespers,\" allowing for the following facts: (1) This is A. A. Milne's first published poem for children. (2) At the time of its composition, Christopher Robin was 2½ years old. (3) His order of affection was: Nanny, Mother, Father. (4) Although A. A. Milne was brought up in a strictly religious family, he was himself an equally firm agnostic.\n\nTherefore, the poet's rather naughty little child cannot be based on his own child, who at 2½ years, although he could certainly repeat a prayer by rote, would not be able to provide it with a commentary, however artless.\n\nGod bless Mummy. I know that's right.\n\nWasn't it fun in the bath tonight?\n\nThe cold's so cold, and the hot's so hot\n\nOh! God bless Daddy—I quite forgot.\n\nLikewise, it cannot be a memory from A. A. Milne's own childhood. In fact, Christopher Robin is remarkably elusive in this poem. At one moment, he is the angelic child; at the next, he carries a formidable weight of adult cynicism.\n\nBut even so one must tell the truth about the matter. Not \"God bless Mummy, because I love her so\" but \"God bless Mummy, I know that's right\"; not \"God bless Daddy, because he buys me food and clothes\" but \"God bless Daddy I quite forgot.\" (p. 223)14\n\nChildren recognise the deplorable truth of this, but it is the very truth which A. A. Milne resented. It was unfortunate that the first poem should have been so universally misunderstood, but a writer's words once freed sometimes go in unintended directions. It is this imprecision which gives the effect of sentimentality to what was intended as a serious comment on childhood and which now appears as little more than an echo of the widespread cynicism of the 1920s. If When We Were Very Young is the less effective of the two books, it is in part because three-quarters of the poems occupy the doubtful territory of shared childhoods, while the best of them occupy the neutral ground of \"Lines and Squares,\" \"At the Zoo,\" and\"Market Square.\" By the time A. A. Milne was writing Now We Are Six, Christopher Robin was old enough to enjoy a wider subject matter, and the central figure of the poems comes into his own at the expense of the dream figure. Not that the old ambiguities can be banished entirely; \"The Engineer\" has already been mentioned, and another example is \"In the Dark.\"\n\nThere was one great difference between my father and myself when we were children. He had an older brother; I had not. So he was never alone in the dark. Lying in bed with the lights out, he could so easily be \"talking to a dragon\" and feeling brave, knowing that if the dragon suddenly turned fierce he had only to reach out a hand and there would be Ken in the next bed. But I could take no such risks. I had to keep reminding myself that the dragon was only a bedtime story one, not a real one.\" (p. 25)15\n\nI've had my supper,\n\nAnd had my supper,\n\nAnd HAD my supper and all;\n\nI've heard of the story\n\nOf Cinderella,\n\nAnd how she went to the ball;\n\nI've cleaned my teeth,\n\nAnd I've said my prayers,\n\nAnd I've cleaned and said them right;\n\nAnd they've all of them been\n\nAnd kissed me lots,\n\nThey've all of them said \"Good-night.\"16\n\nThis poem shows that the dream child's influence was frequently anything but baleful, and it serves to support Christopher Milne's contention that for his father, the balance between creativity and reportage tilted towards the former. It has a lively movement and an ingeniously worked out metrical pattern which reflect the hard work put into shaping it. Whereas a straightforward reportage poem like \"Buttercup Days,\" to which E. H. Shepard has added two real portraits and a real Cotchford Farm, becomes an occasion for vague adult day-dreaming and a tripping, featureless rhythm.\n\nWhere is Anne?\n\nHead above the buttercups,\n\nWalking by the stream,\n\nDown among the buttercups.\n\nWhere is Anne?\n\nWalking with her man,\n\nLost in a dream,\n\nLost among the buttercups.17\n\nThis serves to emphasise that the disparate elements in a poem only make it more tricky to manage; it is the degree of control over them which the writer has for the moment managed to achieve which determines our response to \"Vespers\" or \"In the Dark.\"\n\nThe main difference between the two books, however, is that the gift for mock-heroic narrative directed to a domestic setting, suggested in \"The King's Breakfast\" is here given wider scope; poems of this kind are \"King John's Christmas,\" \"King Hilary and the Beggarman,\" and \"The Knight Whose Armour Didn't Squeak.\" A further happy development is to apply the same formula to Christopher Robin's childish illnesses and the doctors who attended him.\n\nThey expounded the reazles For sneezles\n\nAnd wheezles,\n\nThe manner of measles\n\nWhen new.\n\nThey said \"If he freezles\n\nIn draughts and in breezles,\n\nThen PHTHEEZLES\n\nMay even ensue.\"18\n\nand to the occasional pets which caused upsets to the more tender natures of the household when accidentally freed,\n\nShe said she didn't mean it, and I never said she did,\n\nShe said she wanted matches and she just took off the lid,\n\nShe said that she was sorry, but it's difficult to catch\n\nAn excited sort of beetle you've mistaken for a match.19\n\nThe verbal dexterity is much better employed here than in the easier imitations of childish diction for comic effect. In these poems, the fictional and the actual Christopher Robin meet on equal terms in an open-hearted celebration of the domestic moment. They are a more satisfactory achievement than \"Vespers\" or \"Disobedience,\" in which the central character is apt to wander off into uncharted areas of adult experience and nostalgia. They maintain most surely the balance between punctiliousness and sympathy which gives A. A. Milne's fantasy its individual signature.\n\nWe went to all the places which a beetle might be near,\n\nAnd we made the sort of noises which a beetle likes to hear,\n\nAnd I saw a kind of something, and I gave a sort of shout:\n\n\"A beetle house and Alexander Beetle coming out!\"\n\nIt was Alexander Beetle I'm as certain as can be\n\nAnd he had a sort of look as if he thought it must be Me.20\n\nNotes\n\nA.

West Lafayette, Ind.: ChLA Publishers, 1985.\n\n[In the following essay, Wilson examines how Milne utilizes strong character patterns in his Winnie-the-Pooh books to create a nurturing utopian world for young readers, arguing that Pooh's Forest represents \"liberation from the constraints of school and work … and freedom from danger and anxiety.\"]\n\nFor over half a century, Winnie-the-Pooh and Christopher Robin have been an inseparable literary pair. Ironically, Alan Alexander Milne had never intended to make his mark as a writer of children's literature, and was somewhat frustrated to find himself permanently typed as the author of poems and stories about a small boy and a Forest of personified animal-toys. When he began writing the verses for When We Were Very Young (1924), Milne had already achieved considerable success and popularity as a dramatist and novelist, although his humorous fantasy Once on a Time (1917) had not been very successful with either an adult or juvenile audience. But his previous accomplishments were eclipsed by the immediate and extraordinary success of When We Were Very Young ; inspired by Milne's three-year-old son, this deft and amusing collection of light verse went through fifty-two editions in its first year of publication and has never been out of print since. The stage was set for Pooh's equally sweeping appearance two years later in Winnie-the-Pooh, followed by a second book of poems featuring a slightly older Christopher Robin, Now We Are Six (1927). The House at Pooh Corner (1928) was Milne's last children's book, although he adapted Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows as a play for children, Toad of Toad Hall, in 1929.\n\nMilne's quartet of juvenile best-sellers developed from his role as the real Christopher Robin's father, and from Christopher's devotion to his teddy bear, originally known as Edward. As the introduction to When We Were Very Young explains, Christopher had named the swan whom he visited each day Pooh, \"because, if you call him and he doesn't come (which is a thing swans are good at), then you can pretend that you were just saying 'Pooh!' to show how little you wanted him\" (ix). When Edward Bear wanted a more exciting name, he became Winnie, after a bear in the London Zoo, and Pooh, since the swan didn't want the name anymore. The characters of Edward/Pooh and his companions developed from Christopher's toys. Milne said in his autobiography that he \"described rather than invented them\"; his wife and son had created their personalities and voices. (286). Only Owl and Rabbit were his own invention. Pooh, Eeyore, and Piglet were present in the nursery during Christopher's earliest years, while Kanga and Tigger came later, toys for Christopher but also chosen with an eye to their literary roles. In his autobiography, The Enchanted Places, Christopher Milne recalls that his everyday play with the nursery toys became entwined with his father's stories about them, until his bear was inseparable from A. A. Milne's literary sensation: \"The Pooh in my arms, the Pooh sitting opposite me at the breakfast table, was a Pooh who had climbed trees in search of honey, who had got stuck in a rabbit hole, who was 'a bear of no brain at all'\" (77).\n\nAnd it is this interplay between the real Christopher and Pooh, and their imaginary roles, which forms the framework of the Pooh books. In the first chapter of Winnie-the-Pooh, \"We are Introduced to Winnie-the-Pooh and Some Bees, and the Stories Begin.\" \"We\" incorporates Christopher Robin as part of the audience, and his appearance as Pooh's friend and rescuer establishes both his dual role as listener and character, and the nature of his place within these stories. He is important, but never the protagonist, and is less individualized than the animal characters. In a number of episodes, he makes a cameo appearance as the reassuring authority figure who functions as a deus ex machina. Christopher could be almost any small child, but Pooh is unique; while he shares the stage with the other inhabitants of the Forest, he is indisputably the star and the favorite.\n\nFrom the Three Bears to the Berenstain Bears, ursine characters are abundant in children's literature, but few have achieved Pooh's enduring popularity. Pooh, nevertheless, has encountered his share of opposition, most notably from Dorothy Parker's review of The House at Pooh Corner in the New Yorker, where she declared that by page five, \"Tonstant Weader fwowed up.\" Milne unflappably replied that \"No writer of children's books says gaily to his publisher, 'Don't bother about the children, Mrs. Parker will love it'\" (Autobiography 282).\n\nAnd the Pooh books, now regarded as modern classics, have stood the test of time, remaining popular through several generations of children. Winnie-the-Pooh outstripped even the phenomenal success of When We Were Very Young, and became Milne's best-selling (and probably best-loved) children's book. Widely translated, it has the additional distinction of a Latin version, Winnie Ille Pu, and inspired Frederick Crews' satire of literary criticism, The Pooh Perplex. Pooh himself entered the mass media in the nineteen-sixties as a character in a Disney film and as the logo for Sears Roebuck's children's wear. Pooh toys, calendars, cookbooks, records, and so on are ubiquitous. In short, Pooh is not only a beloved literary character, but a cultural and commercial phenomenon. Nevertheless, such popular acclaim neither diminishes nor enhances the books themselves, which continue to stand on their own merits.\n\nMuch of the uniqueness and enduring appeal of the Pooh books rests upon Milne's succinct and skillful characterization; each animal is a distinct individual with his own personality, speech pattern, and appearance. Each is also an easily recognizable type: Rabbit is the organizer and busybody, efficient and officious; Eeyore the eternal pessimist, morosely self-satisfied in his gloomy view of the world; Owl is the pompous know-it-all whose wisdom is more appearance than substance, and so forth. Pooh's character is a bit more complex and less easily pigeon-holed; he is a \"bear of little brain\" who cheerfully accepts his own limitations, a loyal friend, an enthusiastic poet, albeit undistinguished and unappreciated, who celebrates the simple pleasures of food, companionship, and the outdoors. He possesses some typical bearlike characteristics—a growly voice, love of honey, clumsiness—but is more an animated Teddy than a personified wild animal. As Thomas B. Swann observes in his critical study of Milne, Pooh \"represents the ultimate taming of a wild animal into a children's toy\" (89). Pooh has none of the powerful or menacing traits of a bear, and his devotion to home, friends, and frequent meals gives him a cozy domestic character. The other characters likewise have a few traits borrowed from nature—Piglet likes \"haycorns,\" Eeyore prefers thistles, Rabbit lives underground while Owl nests in a big tree—but they are distinguished by their personalities rather than their animal characteristics. Christopher Milne's comment that Rabbit \"became less rabbity and more Rabbity\" (77) as the stories developed applies to the other characters also. Milne's creatures offer more insight into human than animal nature.\n\nMilne achieves a perfect unity of character and action in the Pooh stories; as Margaret Blount observes in Animal Land, \"The appearance of each animal—as in all toys—gives its character, and in contrast to the human world, things are always what they seem\" (178). Piglet, pink and small, appears timid and is so; Eeyore's grey coloring, natural for a donkey, matches his glum personality, while his thistle patch, \"rather boggy and sad,\" epitomizes his place in the Forest society. E. H. Shepard's illustrations help to establish each character as a unique individual, and are integral to, and inseparable from, the stories; one could not imagine Pooh and his companions in any other guise. Although simple in technique, the illustrations capture the essence of character in such details as Eeyore's drooping ears and Rabbit's whiskers. Christopher Milne notes that Pooh's entire character is evident in the placement of his eye, which expresses \"his particularly Poohish look\" well known to generations of Pooh fans (78). A. A. Milne had not always held Shepard's work in high esteem, having once asked the art editor of Punch, \"What on earth do you see in this man? He's perfectly hopeless.\" (By Way of Introduction 34). But Shepard's pictures are the ideal complement to Milne's stories; Swann notes that \"their simplicity is that of Milne's writing, the simplicity of genius, of capturing essentials in a few unerring strokes …\" (90).\n\nMilne's characters are generally consistent and static, and rarely surprise readers, or each other, with unexpected actions or behavior. Pooh does become somewhat more capable as the stories progress; Stephen Canham sees a pattern of maturation as \"the bear of very little brain gradually moves toward an incredulous but proud recognition of his own capacities …\" (26). Pooh sails in Christopher Robin's umbrella to rescue Piglet from a flood, and is subsequently honored with a party in the last chapter of Winnie-the-Pooh ; in The House at Pooh Corner, he gets Eeyore out of the river by throwing a large stone to \"hoosh\" him over to the bank. Nevertheless, Pooh remains essentially the same: well-intentioned, frequently befuddled, and endearingly dim.\n\nFor a young child, Milne's stable and consistent characters are comprehensible and reassuring; one knows what to expect from them, and they are never disappointing. For adult readers, one of the special pleasures of the Pooh books is their light-hearted yet astute portrayal of attitudes and personalities drawn from life. The animals are not merely disguises for human traits, but through their individual characters, they represent a spectrum of emotions, outlooks, and approaches to life. Eeyore wallows in self-pity and takes a perverse satisfaction in his own misery; Rabbit seeks orderly and practical solutions to every problem, listing and organizing; Kanga centers her life around a domestic maternal role, obsessed with baths and coughs and Strengthening Medicine. A note of exaggeration in the portraits of these one-dimensional characters permits a touch of satire, but this never overwhelms the individuality of each animal or undermines Milne's affectionate approach to his characters. An interchange between Pooh and Rabbit in The House at Pooh Corner conveys the essence of each in an amusing but incisive way, and contrasts their fundamentally different perspectives: \"'We've come to wish you a Very Happy Thursday,' said Pooh … and Rabbit, whose life was made up of Important Things, said, \"Oh, I thought you'd really come about something'\" (270). Afterwards, Pooh and Piglet ponder Rabbit's character:\n\n\"Rabbit's clever,\" said Pooh thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Piglet, \"Rabbit's clever.\"\n\n\"And he has Brain.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Piglet, \"Rabbit has Brain.\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Pooh, \"that that's why he never understands anything.\" (270-271)\n\nHere, and throughout the Pooh stories, Milne implies that the bumbling bear is wiser than he himself realizes, and that there are qualities more valuable than \"Brain.\" Pooh is no hero in the usual sense of the word; his enterprises, whether to trap a Heffalump or to get honey by impersonating a little black cloud, rarely turn out as planned—the occasional success stands out as an exception. The juvenile reader/listener can frequently relish the satisfaction of being smarter than Pooh; John Rowe Townsend notes that the Woozle story, for example, \"generates superior giggles in children, as the two silly animals go round and round the spinney discovering at each circuit that the Woozle has been joined by more companions\" (172).\n\nYet Pooh does not emerge as a fool or a failure; in a sense, he always wins because he can never be unhappy or defeated for any length of time. After receiving bee stings instead of honey in the first episode of Winnie-the-Pooh, he concludes that these are the wrong sort of bees, who would therefore make the wrong sort of honey, so there is no great loss. In the next chapter, \"Pooh Goes Visiting and Gets into a Tight Place,\" finding himself wedged in Rabbit's front door after over-indulging in refreshments. The predicament clearly results from Pooh's insatiable appetite, but this is not a moral tale; after a week of fasting Pooh is freed, and \"with a nod of thanks to his friends, he went on with his walk through the forest, humming proudly to himself\" (35) and continuing to eat as much as ever.\n\nPooh's sanguine disregard for the lessons of experience and his never-failing eagerness to try yet another scheme or adventure contribute to an intriguing aspect of his character—its blending of a child's and an adult's role. In his cheerful if sometimes baffled view of the world, his mingled egoism and generosity, not to mention his love of food, Pooh exhibits traits which are not unique to children, but are commonly associated with childhood. But he is not simply a child in the form of a bear; as a carefree bachelor, he lives alone, comes and goes as he pleases, and has the independence and prerogatives of adulthood with none of the responsibilities. In short, he enjoys the best of both worlds, and so represents a form of wish-fulfillment both for adults and for children. Similarly, Christopher Robin is a small boy playing in an imaginary world with his stuffed animals; as the stories make this world real, they preserve the freedom of child's play while transforming Christopher into a parent-figure who functions as the Forest's benevolent and supreme authority. Loving, protective, and all-knowing, he is always at hand in a crisis (\"It's Christopher Robin!\" said Piglet. ' He'll know what to do,\") and periodically boosts Pooh's self-esteem with such assurances as \"You're the Best Bear in All the World.\"\n\nPooh's other best friend, Piglet, is also a child-adult, although more timid and dependent; even the misanthropic Eeyore, whose sardonic comments are those of a disillusioned adult, takes a childlike pleasure in his birthday presents. Tigger and Roo are the only characters who function entirely as children, and who live with a parent who cares for them. There is no suggestion that they will ever grow up; like all of the animals, they are characterized within a static role. Rabbit and Owl, the grownups of the group, often seem more foolish than Pooh; eager to maintain their high opinions of themselves, they can never admit mistakes or ignorance—a common attitude of adults toward children.\n\nAs Pooh refuses to be defeated by circumstances, he displays a similar childlike tenacity and resilience in his use of language. Like Humpty-Dumpty, Pooh is the \"master\" of his words, insisting that his pronunciation (\"mastershalums\" or \"jagular\") or his definition is correct, despite any evidence to the contrary. On the North Pole expedition in Winnie-the-Pooh, he sticks to his idea that an ambush is like a gorse bush, frustrating Owl's pedantic attempt at correction:\n\n\"An Ambush,\" said Owl, \"is a sort of Surprise.\"\n\n\"So is a gorse-bush sometimes,\" said Pooh.\n\n…\n\n\"We are not talking about gorse-bushes,\" said\n\nOwl a little crossly.\n\n\"I am,\" said Pooh. (111-112)\n\nPooh's literal translation of an unfamiliar concept into a known object is typical of a young child's reasoning; in a similar vein, Christopher Robin defines an expedition as \"a long line of everybody,\" and declares that the pole Pooh used to fish Roo out of the river is, in fact, the North Pole. Pooh also uses language as a means of comprehending the world around him, often verbalizing his thought process as he tries, like a child, to figure things out. He says to himself that buzzing noises mean bees and bees mean honey, and ends this laborious chain of cause and effect with the egocentric assumption that the world centers around him: \"And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it\" (Winnie-the-Pooh 10). Words can exert power over dangers or threats, like magical spells in folk tales; \"Ho-ho, \" said just the right way, will disarm a Heffalump, and Rabbit assures Pooh in Winnie-the-Pooh that \"Aha!\" will tell Kanga, \"We'll tell you where Baby Roo is, if you promise to go away from the Forest and never come back\" (89). The written word holds a special fascination. Owl and Rabbit, who can write, consider themselves a cut above the other animals; as Rabbit says to Owl in The House at Pooh Corner, \"… you and I have brains. The others have fluff\" (223). And Pooh, whose spelling is \"wobbly,\" is much impressed by Owl's lengthy Happy Birthday message to Eeyore—the longer, the better, and since Pooh can't read, Owl's reputation for literacy is quite safe.\n\nMuch of the humor in the Pooh books arises from Milne's ingenious play with language; from the first chapter, when Pooh literally lives \"under the name of Sanders\" written over his door in gold letters, the stories are filled with puns and word play. Searching for Eeyore's lost tail, Pooh informs Owl that someone else is interested in his new bell-rope; Eeyore was not only fond of it, but \"attached to it.\" At times the characters coin new words which seem more apt than the originals, such as Roo's \"spudge\" for Owl's none too clean sponge. Pooh turns Owl's pompous discussion of customary procedure into something good to eat—\"Crustimoney Proseedcake.\" Spelling and capitalization also contribute to Milne's inventive use of language; the multiplication tables take on a new guise as \"Twys-times,\" which Pooh says don't work, and a Bear of Very Little Brain, a Useful Pot to Keep Things In, or a Very Small Animal Entirely Surrounded by Water would not be the same without capitals. On a more complex level, Milne plays on our usual expectations of how language functions; in this respect, his style has some resemblance to Lewis Carroll's. Pooh's clock, stopped at just the time for an eleven-o'clock snack, is reminiscent of the perpetual Mad Tea Party in Alice in Wonderland. A typical dialogue also has echoes of Wonderland in carrying a strictly literal \"logic\" to the point of absurdity; Pooh, returning home after finding Piglet out, is surprised to see Piglet sitting in his own armchair:\n\n\"Hallo, Piglet,\" he said. \"I thought you were out.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Piglet, \"It's you who were out, Pooh.\"\n\n\"So it was,\" said Pooh. \"I knew one of us was.\" (Winnie-the-Pooh 158)\n\nPooh's world, however, is a peaceful haven compared to Carroll's exhilarating and sometimes nightmarish Wonderland. Milne's Forest is a benevolent world, an Eden free from corruption and death where life consists of a pleasant round of visits, meals, small adventures, and general enjoyment. No one has any desire to leave this paradise, or to explore the outside world; Christopher Robin will eventually leave because he has to, not because he wants to. The wanderlust seen in Grahame's The Wind in the Willows is entirely absent among Milne's characters. In this snug and friendly setting, even the occasional moments of anxiety are amusing rather than fearful, since no genuine dangers or threats exist; there is no Wild Wood or Mr. McGregor in Milne's forest, and every adventure ends happily. As Canham observes, reassurance \"is one of the key values of this world\" (24). Situations which may appear frightening, at least to the characters involved, are not only harmless but funny; the \"Horrible Heffalump\" is only Pooh with a honey jar over his head, and a seaworthy umbrella rescues Piglet from a flood. Common motifs of adventure stories—expeditions, kidnapping, a message in a bottle—become parodies in this secure environment where everyone goes home to supper after a satisfying day of adventures.\n\nThe animals do not mimic the everyday aspects of human life such as working and spending money; their existence is emancipated from such requirements and most of their activities are inseparable from play—the all-absorbing play of the young child. Providing liberation from the constraints of school and work (school is the beginning of the end of Christopher Robin's carefree existence) and freedom from danger and anxiety, the Forest represents an ideal world for both children and adults. It is not, however, a lawless world based solely upon self-gratification. \"Nature red in tooth and claw\" is entirely absent from Milne's Forest; the animals are cooperative and kind toward one another, and appear to be so by nature, without coercion. The stories are not didactic in any contrived or obvious sense, but present a friendly world in which an assortment of different characters like and respect one another, and coexist harmoniously. Rabbit and Owl may show off, but their conceit and bossiness are more amusing than annoying, and the Forest would be less enjoyable without them. There is plenty of laughter, but no malice or cruelty. Friends are always loyal and always there when needed; when Christopher Robin is worried about Pooh in the flood, Owl breaks off his pompous discourse on unfavorable atmospheric conditions and flies over to Pooh's house. Newcomers like Kanga and Tigger must be accepted as members of the community, and turn out to be quite likable once one gets to know them: \"Tigger is all right really, \" as Piglet says in The House at Pooh Corner (250). In these respects, the Pooh books do convey a moral perspective—idealized, certainly, but nonetheless attractive.\n\nThe outside world, of course, is more demanding and less accommodating, and it is inevitable that Christopher Robin must eventually enter this world. In The House at Pooh Corner, the Forest has become a refuge and escape from the encroachments of school, the \"Bisy Backson\": \"Christopher Robin came down from the Forest to the bridge, feeling all sunny and careless, and just as if twice nineteen didn't matter a bit, as it didn't on such a happy afternoon …\" (247). The \"Contradiction\" at the beginning of this book is so called because it is a farewell to the Forest; bedtime stories about Pooh have been displaced by arithmetic problems, and Christopher's father, formerly the storyteller, is now the schoolmaster. The adventures come now only in dreams, and the stories are \"all that we shall remember now.\"\n\nChristopher must exchange the benevolent Forest, with its spontaneous adventures and happy endings, for the more restrictive environment of school. As he tells Pooh in the last chapter, in the Forest one can do Nothing, \"just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering\" (307). But he knows that \"they,\" meaning grownups, don't let you do nothing in the practical outside world which they control. Christopher's recital of what he is learning in school gives a rather satirical view of his education, and begs the question of whether he would be better off remaining in the Forest; \"something called Factors\" and \"what comes from Brazil\" are jumbled together with \"how you make a Suction Pump (if you want to)\" (310). But Milne was too honest to pretend that childhood can, or should, last forever. As the Pooh books ended when the real Christopher Robin became a schoolboy, so the fictional Christopher must leave his Forest and animals behind. A little boy and his bear will be forever playing in the timeless world of the Forest, but Christopher will go away to school and, inevitably, grow away from the Forest and all that it represents. The conclusion of The House at Pooh Corner thus preserves the Forest itself as an incorruptible dream world, untouched by time and change, but recognizes the inevitability of change for Christopher Robin. It is not an absolute departure, however, for Pooh intends to go on being faithful, even if he can't understand Kings and Factors, and Christopher Robin knows that whatever happens, Pooh will always understand. As Milne says in the introduction to The House at Pooh Corner, \"the Forest will always be there … and anybody who is Friendly with Bears can find it\" (154).\n\nReferences\n\nBlount, Margaret.

West Lafayette, Ind.: ChLA Publishers, 1987.\n\n[In the following essay, Wilson analyzes the narrative, perspective, and familial relationships portrayed throughout When We Were Very Young and Now We Are Six.]\n\nLike Robert Louis Stevenson, A. A. Milne began his first book for children as a diversion during a dismally wet summer holiday. He had already written \"Vespers,\" and Rose Fyleman had encouraged him to write a book of verses after he sent her \"The Dormouse and the Doctor.\" Working in a summerhouse in Wales, Milne began what was to become a perennial best-seller of children's literature as he reflected upon childhood—his own, and his son's: \"… there on the other side of the lawn was a child with whom I had lived for three years … and here within me were unforgettable memories of my own childhood\" (Autobiography 280). Although Milne dedicated When We Were Very Young to Christopher Robin, the child in the poems is sometimes Christopher Robin, sometimes A. A. Milne as a child, and sometimes \"the child,\" or any child. In fact, Christopher Robin appears by name in only four of the forty-four poems in When We Were Very Young, which owes as much to Milne's imagination and memories as it does to his son's childhood:\n\nAs a child I kept a mouse; probably it escaped—they generally do. Christopher Robin has kept almost everything except a mouse. As a child I played lines-and-squares in a casual sort of way. Christopher Robin never did until he read what I had written about it, and not very enthusiastically then. But he did go to Buckingham Palace a good deal (which I didn't) though not with Alice.…(By Way of Introduction 196)\n\nAs for who is speaking the verses, Milne says in the Preface to When We Were Very Young that if you are not sure, it is probably \"Hoo,\"—\"one of those curious children who look four on Monday, and eight on Tuesday, and are really twenty-eight on Saturday.…\"The blending of Milne's voice and memories with Christopher Robin's experiences continues in Now We Are Six, which features a slightly more mature Christopher Robin and gives Pooh a more prominent role in the poems.\n\nNor were Milne's poems based upon a close relationship between father and child. While nannies figure in a number of the poems and parents in general are mentioned occasionally, only one poem out of both books portrays Christopher Robin and his father. In \"Sand-between-the-Toes,\" they take a walk on the beach together, more like two children, each with sixpence from Nurse, than parent and child: \"We clambered over the humping sand—And Christopher held my hand\" When We Were Very Young (75). Ordinarily there would be nothing unusual in this closeness between parent and child, but the emphasis given the final line of this verse creates a rather wistful tone and suggests that Christopher and his father had few such moments. In his autobiography, Christopher Milne indicates that during his nursery years, his father remained in the background; a close and rewarding father-son relationship developed later, when Christopher was a schoolboy and well beyond the Winnie-the-Pooh stage. Ironically, it was this distance between Milne and his son which stimulated him to write poetry for children; the poems were a substitute for, rather than a reflection of, an intimate bond between father and child: \"My father was a creative writer and so it was precisely because he was not able to play with his small son that his longings sought and found satisfaction in another direction. He wrote about him instead\" (36).\n\nNot all of Milne's poems are about children, but most are, in some respect, about childhood. Milne transforms kings and knights into humorous figures in whom the child can see himself; King John is \"not a good man,\" but Father Christmas provides his heart's desire, \"a big, red, india-rubber ball,\" anyway. Kings can exercise power as children would like to; another royal figure in one of Milne's most popular poems, \"The King's Breakfast,\" won't settle for marmalade instead of butter just to make things easier for everyone else. King Hilary looks forward to sugar-plums in his Christmas stocking and dismisses his snobbish Chancellor. These characters do as they please, acting out the fantasies of the child who says, in \"If I Were King,\" \"I often wish I were a King / And then I could do anything\" (When We Were Very Young 100). \"Bad Sir Brian Botany,\" on the other hand, is a grownup bully who meets with poetic justice. \"The Knight Whose Armour Didn't Squeak\" is wise by a child's standards; he can write letters and multiply up to four. The grownups in these poems combine a child's perceptions with an adult's prerogatives. Other verses not featuring children include a few nature poems, mostly in When We Were Very Young. On the whole, these are not among Milne's best, for they lack his characteristic verve and humor. He seems most natural and at ease in depicting rather homely and ordinary scenes, as in \"Summer Afternoon,\" where \"Six brown cows walk down to drink\" (When We Were Very Young 67), or \"The Invaders,\" where the cows make another appearance as they tramp through the woods in early morning.\n\nMilne's antecedents in the area of children's poetry include Christina Rosetti's Sing-Song (1872) and Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses (1885). He surpasses both in wit and verbal ingenuity, although he never achieves the depth of feeling found in a lyric such as Rossetti's \"Sea Sand and Sorrow.\" A few of Milne's poems reflect well-known works by his predecessors; \"Wind on the Hill\" resembles Rossetti's classic \"Who Has Seen the Wind?\" and \"Daffodowndilly\" borrows her name for the daffodil, while Milne's \"Swing Song\" is reminiscent of Stevenson's \"The Swing.\" Like Rossetti and, particularly, Stevenson, Milne focuses his poetry around cheerful images of a young child's everyday experiences. His poems are not derivative, however; in their deft humor and irresistible rhythms, they are inimitably his own. Milne's work is distinguished above all by his disciplined and inventive light verse, which at its best gives an impression of effortless humor and grace. He did not toss off trifles for the nursery; as he observed in his Autobiography,\n\nWhatever else they lack, the verses are technically good.… When We Were Very Young is not the work of a poet becoming playful, nor of a lover of children expressing his love, nor of a prose-writer knocking together a few jingles for the little ones, it is the work of a light-verse writer taking his job seriously even though he is taking it into the nursery. (282)\n\nThe same philosophy that children deserve the best is evident in Now We Are Six also.\n\nIndeed, Milne's craftsmanship is impeccable, and his ingenious use of rhyme, meter, and typography is a trademark of his verses. Sound and sense are perfectly matched in the rollicking rhythm of \"James James Morrison Morrison Weatherby George Dupree\" or the refrain from \"Busy,\" the \"threeish\" poem in Now We Are Six :\n\nRound about\n\nAnd round about\n\nAnd round about I go—\n\nAll around the table,\n\nThe table in the nursery—(9)\n\nor in the quieter, more contemplative mood of \"Halfway Down,\" where, as Zena Sutherland notes, the pattern of the verses mimics Christopher Robin's stopping firmly on the middle step:\n\nHalfway down the stairs\n\nIs a stair\n\nWhere I sit.\n\nThere isn't any\n\nOther stair\n\nQuite Like\n\nIt. (When We Were Very Young 83)\n\nFinding ingenious ways to keep the strict rhyme and meter essential to light verse was a challenge which Milne clearly relished; in \"The Christening,\" for example, a rhyme creates a pun in the first verse:\n\nWhat shall I call\n\nMy dear little dormouse?\n\nHis eyes are small,\n\nBut his tail is e-nor-mouse. (When We Were Very Young 7)\n\nA common speech pattern of small children, doubling plurals, is carried to comic extremes in \"The Three Foxes\" : \"They went to a Fair, and they all won prizes— / Three plum-puddingses and three mince-pieses\" (When We Were Very Young 42). The appearance of the poem on the page is also often important; Christopher Robin, in \"Politeness,\" says that he always answers grownups' questions,\n\nIf they ask me\n\nPolitely.…\n\nBUT SOMETIMES\n\nI wish\n\nThat they wouldn't. (When We Were Very Young 43)\n\nThe small print of the last line suggests Christopher whispering his rebellious thoughts, too softly to be heard. The repeated refrain and varied typeface in the closing lines of \"The Little Black Hen\" highlight the child's egocentric delight at being more important than the adults:\n\nBerryman and Baxter,\n\nPrettiboy and Penn,\n\nAnd Old Farmer Middleton\n\nAre five big men.\n\nAll of them are wanting\n\nAn egg for their tea,\n\nBut the Little Black Hen is much too busy,\n\nThe Little Black Hen is much too busy,\n\nThe Little Black Hen is MUCH too busy …\n\nShe's laying my egg for me!(Now We Are Six 66)\n\nThe child in Milne's verses is in many respects a typical child with universal qualities that have not changed in half a century. He (or she) is curious, egocentric, imaginative, sometimes perplexed by the seemingly pointless demands and questions of adults. Less typically, perhaps, he is a rather solitary figure. Only two poems out of both volumes are about children playing together; in Now We Are Six, \"Buttercup Days\" and \"The Morning Walk\" portray Christopher and his closest childhood friend, Anne Darlington, to whom Now We Are Six was dedicated. Other than his nurse, the child's usual companions are animals, real or stuffed. The child in When We Were Very Young christens his dormouse, revels in the rabbits which he finds on the common, and romps in the hills with a puppy, who \"got talking\" when they met—like most small children, Christopher is quite able to believe that animals can speak. The bear Pooh of Milne's classic novels plays only a minor role in this volume, but comes into his own in Now We Are Six, where he is Christopher's best friend. The poems about friendship, \"The Friend,\" and \"Us Two,\" feature Christopher and Pooh, not Christopher and another child:\n\nSo wherever I am, there's always Pooh,\n\nThere's always Pooh and Me.\n\n\"What would I do?\" I said to Pooh,\n\n\"If it wasn't for you,\" and Pooh said: \"True,\n\nIt isn't much fun for One, but Two\n\nCan stick together,\" says Pooh, says he.\n\n\"That's how it is,\" says Pooh. (\"Us Two,\" Now We Are Six 37)\n\nAlthough Christopher's solitude eliminates a slice of life from these verses—there are no poems about school, or other activities involving groups of children—it allows Milne to concentrate upon the child's inner world, particularly as expressed in imaginative play. Role-playing is portrayed as a way of experimenting with one's identity, which is fluid and offers infinite possibilities. In \"Nursery Chairs,\" after impersonating a hunter, lion, and sailor, Christopher Robin plays at being a three-year-old in his own chair; in play, this identity is no more \"real\" than the various roles which he slips in and out of. \"Busy\" presents a similar game of role-playing: \"Perhaps I am a Postman. No, I think I am a Tram. / I'm feeling rather funny and I don't know what I am—\" (Now We Are Six 9). By age six, Christopher has a firmer sense of self as he ponders the differences between himself and a younger child: \"If I were John and John were Me, / Then he'd be six and I'd be three\" (\"A Thought,\" Now We Are Six 71). He still has an active imagination, however, as he slays dragons in his suit of armor and creates Binker as an alter-ego and imaginary companion in a sometimes frustrating world:\n\nWell, I'm very fond of Daddy, but he hasn't time to play.\n\nAnd I'm very fond of Mummy, but she sometimes goes away,\n\nAnd I'm often cross with Nanny when she wants to brush my hair …\n\nBut Binker's always Binker, and is certain to be there. (Now We Are Six 20)\n\nLike all young children, Christopher Robin lives in a world largely controlled by adults, whose values and requirements often make little sense to him. He pities the tradespeople in \"Market Square\" who do not have a rabbit, which is far more important to him than the saucepans and mackerel for sale. In a number of poems, Milne blends humor with a sensitive awareness of the child's point of view. Adults sometimes emerge as a collective, anonymous \"they\" who, as Christopher says in \"Independence,\" \"don't understand.\" They ask foolish questions, burden him with precautions (\"Not up there, dear!\") and dismiss his attempts to share his discoveries. \"Come Out with Me\" contrasts the child's excitement about what he has seen with the grownups' disappointing lack of interest:\n\nThere's wind on the river and wind on the hill …\n\nYou can hear the sea if you stand quite still!\n\nThere's eight new puppies at Roundabout Farm—\n\nAnd I saw an old sailor with only one arm!\n\nBut every one says, \"Run along!\"\n\n(Run along, run along!)\n\nAll of them say, \"Run along! I'm busy as can be.\"\n\nEvery one says, \"Run along,\n\nThere's a little darling!\"\n\nIf I'm a little darling, why don't they run with me? (Now We Are Six 59)\n\nHere sentimental clichés enable adults to diminish the child's importance under a veneer of affection. Elizabeth Ann, one of the occasional female children in Now We Are Six, receives similar responses when she asks how God began—admittedly a tough question: \"Now then darling, it's time for bed,\" and \"Well, what put that in your quaint little head?\" (\"Explained\" 80, 82) Even Alice, who watches the changing of the guard with Christopher, listens without genuine interest and stifles his question cheerfully but decisively: \"Do you think the King knows all about me ?\" \"Sure to, dear, but it's time for tea\" (When We Were Very Young 5). Adults focus on their own priorities rather than the child's. They find no purpose in climbing a hill when \"There's nothing to see,\" and they want to know the child's plans for a beguiling spring morning when, like Pooh, he plans only to enjoy whatever the day may bring:\n\nWhere am I going? I don't quite know.\n\nWhat does it matter where people go?\n\nDown to the wood where the blue-bells grow—\n\nAnywhere, anywhere, I don't know. (\"Spring Morning,\" When We Were Very Young 37)\n\nThe children in When We Were Very Young and Now We Are Six can be more than a match for the adults, however. One of Milne's attractive qualities is his lack of didacticism; his poetical children are not taught lessons about good behavior, and the grownups are far from infallible. Jane, \"The Good Little Girl,\" in Now We Are Six, is a far cry from Robert Louis Stevenson's \"A Good Boy,\" who goes to bed with a clear conscience because he's been obedient all day—since she has no intention of incriminating herself, she wonders why her parents bother to ask if she's been good:\n\nWell, what did they think that I went there to do?\n\nAnd why should I want to be bad at the Zoo?\n\nAnd should I be likely to say if I had ?\n\nSo that's why it's funny of Mummy and Dad,\n\nThis asking and asking, in case I was bad,\n\n\"Well?\n\nHave you been a good girl, Jane?\" (70)\n\nErnest Shepherd's illustrations, which show Jane standing on a lawn with a \"Keep Off the Grass\" sign and feeding an animal next to another sign forbidding the same, make clear that her parents don't know as much as they think they do. Similarly, Mary Jane's well-intentioned nurse tries to placate her with presents and can't see what is obvious even to the youngest reader: \" And it's lovely rice pudding for dinner again !— / What is the matter with Mary Jane?\" (\"Rice Pudding,\" When We Were Very Young 53) The notion of parental authority and control is turned completely upside-down in \"Disobedience,\" where James James leads his errant mother home on a leash and reprimands her in a delightfully dictatorial fashion: \"You must never go down to the end of the town without consulting me\" (When We Were Very Young 34)\n\nAlthough the children in Milne's poems may be occasionally vexed or baffled by the inscrutable ways of grownups, these are a source of annoyance, not anguish. Milne chose to emphasize the joyous aspects of childhood; disappointments and frustrations are handled with a light touch which makes them humorous rather than devastating. As in the novels about Pooh, nothing bad ever happens to anybody; losing Alexander Beetle is the closest Christopher Robin comes to a crisis. The poems do not deal with the darker side of childhood—such emotions as fear, anger, or jealousy are entirely absent. Christopher never has nightmares, but enjoys being alone in the dark, where he can imagine anything he likes. The bears waiting to eat him at the street corner hold no terrors; he complacently defeats them by stepping over the pavement squares. He never loses his temper, breaks a toy, or has a fight and, despite his occasional impatience with adults, Christopher never causes trouble for them. He emerges as a remarkably happy and well-behaved child, inhabiting a sedate and benevolent world.\n\nWhile Milne undoubtedly gives a one-sided picture of childhood, he excels at cheerful and spirited evocations of everyday joys:\n\nI've got a nice new pair of braces,\n\nI've got shoes with new brown laces,\n\nI know wonderful paddly places.\n\nWho's coming out with me? (\"Growing Up,\" When We Were Very Young 99)\n\nAn adult, or an older child than three-year-old Christopher, may smile at his ecstasy over these small symbols of growing up, but Christopher is not made fun of; throughout Milne's poems, the laughter is affectionate, not sardonic, and the child's perspective is respected. Christopher's struggles with \"Dates and Pounds-and-ounces and the names of funny Kings\" are amusing, but his worries reflect every child's anxiety over schoolwork: \"And I know they'll think me silly if I get the answer wrong\" (\"The Friend,\" Now We Are Six 67). And readers of any age can identify with the egocentric dream-world of \"The Island\" : \"There's nobody else in the world, and the world was made for me\" (When We Were Very Young 39). Milne's attitude is not one of amused condescension; he respects the child. As he said in his Autobiography regarding When We Were Very Young, \"It seems that the nursery, more than any other room in the house, likes to be approached seriously\" (282).\n\nMilne can lapse into sentimentality, however, when he tries to render children charming to adults, rather than portraying them naturally and with a touch of humor. The baby-talk which appears in some of the poems is one of their less attractive characteristics; even at three, Christopher Robin seems too old for \"nuffin\" and \"nosserus\" and \"portant\"—happily, there is less of this in Now We Are Six. In \"Buttercup Days,\" however, Christopher and his friend Anne appear as miniature lovers, innocently acting out adult roles. Anne is twice described as \"little,\" a description Milne rarely applies to children in his poems, and her attachment to \"her man,\" as Christopher is called, is depicted in a coy fashion which reduces both children to adorable figures for the sentimental pleasure of adults. \"The Brownie,\" in When We Were Very Young, also seems excessively sweet; brownies \"wriggle off at once because they're all so tickly / (Nanny says they're tickly too)\" (16). The accompanying illustration reinforces this contrived tone, showing Christopher Robin peeking behind the curtain in his dainty smock and girlish coiffure. The facing page provides a refreshing contrast with \"Independence,\" where Christopher gleefully swings on a tree branch, his curls in disarray, while complaining that grownups always spoil the fun with \"Now take care, dear!\" or \"Hold-my-hand\" (17).\n\nProbably the most notorious of Milne's poems is \"Vespers\" : \"Hush! Hush! Whisper who dares! / Christopher Robin is saying his prayers.\" Although this is the last poem in When We Were Very Young, it was one of the first that Milne wrote. He gave it to his wife, \"telling her that if she liked to get it published anywhere she could stick to the money\" (279). As Milne wryly observed some years later, it turned out to be an expensive present. In his autobiography, Christopher Milne acknowledged that \"Vespers\" brought him \"more toe-curling, fist-clenching, lip-biting embarrassment\" than any of his father's poems (28). Yet Milne did not intend the poem to be sentimental; in fact, he saw it as a humorously realistic description of a child whose dutiful prayers mean little to him:\n\nNot \"God bless mummy, because I love her so,\"\n\nbut \"God bless Mummy, I know that's right\"…\n\nnot even the egotism of \"God bless Me, because\n\nI'm the most important person in the house,\" but\n\nthe super-egotism of feeling so impregnable that\n\nthe blessing of this mysterious god for Oneself is\n\nthe very last thing for which it would seem necessary to ask. (285)\n\nEgotism and heartlessness were qualities which Milne perceived as natural to children, if not necessarily attractive. He considered \"Buckingham Palace\" another example of the former, and \"Disobedience\" a portrait of the latter; when James James Morrison's mother disappears, his only reaction is to tell his other relatives \"Not to go blaming him. \" This seems a rather solemn reading of a poem which comically inverts the roles of parent and child, but it shows that Milne was not oblivious to the less endearing characteristics of young children.\n\nThe enduring appeal of Milne's poems rests neither upon sentimentality nor uncompromising realism, but upon his light-hearted yet sympathetic portrayal of a child's everyday world. Milne made no exaggerated claims for his verses, even after the overwhelming success of When We Were Very Young and Now We Are Six. His intention was to entertain, with wit and grace, and his poems are one-dimensional, straightforward, and cheerful. They are clever and amusing, not intense or profound, and they unapologetically reflect the snug and sometimes smug atmosphere of a middle-class English household in the 1920s; the uniformed nannies, the orderly nursery life, the decorous trips to the park and the zoo now have an old-fashioned flavor, and the attitude of \"all's right with the world\" which permeates the poems may now seem complacent, particularly to adults. Milne's limitations become strengths, however, as he creates un-pretentious but memorable images of childhood, simultaneously humorous and affectionate. As in the Pooh stories, he does not attempt to offer a comprehensive vision of life or of childhood, preferring to depict a small world of everyday pleasures where good humor and happy endings are the rule. He rejoices in ordinary happenings and, wisely, does not strive for the extraordinary. Thomas Burnett Swann quotes a review of Milne's last book, four years before his death, that epitomizes Milne's achievement as a writer of children's literature: \"He has perfect vision out of a small window …\" (148).\n\nReferences\n\nMilne, A.

New York, N.Y.: Twayne Publishers, 1995.\n\n[In the following essay, Connolly assesses how the personalities and roles of the characters in Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh books work together to create a unifying sense of magic.]\n\nChristopher Robin\n\nIn 1933 Parents' Magazine announced that Christopher Robin was one of the \"six most famous children in the world\" (see Thwaite, 399, 218), and the following year Frank Swinnerton would write that \"the name of Christopher Robin Milne has long been as familiar to thousands of readers as Little Lord Fauntleroy\" (Swinnerton, 120). The problem, of course, is that there were several different Christopher Robins: a character variously seen in When We Were Very Young and Now We Are Six as well as Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner, not to mention the character's namesake, the very real Christopher Robin Milne.\n\nA. A. Milne asserted that the character of Christopher Robin was a fictional composite and never meant to be a faithful rendering of his son. In an attempt to clarify the confusion, he described the character who first appeared in When We Were Very Young :\n\nNow there is something about this book which I must explain; namely, that the adventures of a child as therein put down came from three sources.\n\n1. My memories of my own childhood.\n\n2. My imaginings of childhood in general.\n\n3. My observations of the particular childhood with which I was now in contact.…\n\nNow who was this Christopher Robin … soon to be the hero of Winnie-the-Pooh and other books? To me he was, and remained, the child of my imagination.1\n\nTo the public, as Milne soon discovered, such a separation between character and real boy was not as easily made. Indeed, Milne even cited that as one of the reasons he stopped writing children's stories and verse:\n\nThe distinction [between character and child], if clear to me, is not so clear to others; and to them, anyhow,…the dividing line between the imaginary and the legal Christopher Robin becomes fainter with each book.… I feel that the legal Christopher Robin has already had more publicity than I want for him. Moreover, since he is growing up, he will soon feel that he has had more publicity than he wants for himself. (\"End of a Chapter,\" 205)\n\nIn this last prediction, Milne proved unerringly accurate. Although he was protected from much of the negative impact of such publicity while he was a child, once Christopher Milne left for school and certainly in later life he suffered from the notoriety he received because of his father's fictional creation.\n\nAs Christopher Milne shows in The Enchanted Places, the fictional character Milne created would at times relentlessly pursue the \"real\" Christopher. An incident he recounts there demonstrates the problems he faced. Christopher had made a recording of \"Vespers\" when he was a young child, but that recording would come to haunt him when he later went to school: \"How intensely painful it was to me to sit in my study at Stowe while my neighbors played the famous—and now cursed—gramophone record remorselessly over and over again. Eventually, the joke, if not the record, worn out, they handed it to me, and I took it and broke it into a hundred fragments and scattered them over a distant field\" (C. Milne, 178).2 Although Christopher never used the name \"Christopher Robin,\" he was dogged by his namesake character throughout his life, and although his childhood proved to be a generally happy one, in later years he and his father drifted apart, with Christopher suffering not only from relentless attention owing to his name but also from feelings of being exploited by his father.3\n\nIf there are important differences between the character and the boy—not the least of which was the father's drawing on his own childhood to create a world and vision of the character—there are also different Christopher Robins within the stories. In the narrative frame of Winnie-the-Pooh Christopher Robin, who asks to be told stories and wants his father to come watch him bathe, overtly asks for both entertainment and attention, in each case demonstrating his need for the father's assurance. It is the father, not he, who is creator and controller of the stories. The clearly dependent Christopher Robin not only requests more tales, but also asks specifically about his role in those stories, wanting to be included and relying on the father-narrator to validate his sense of self. \"I didn't hurt him when I shot him, did I?\" (WP [Winnie-the-Pooh ], 21), asks Christopher Robin about Pooh's return from the skies, and \"'Didn't I give him anything?' asked Christopher Robin sadly\" (WP, 89), about the story of Eeyore's birthday. In the fantasy world of the Forest, Christopher Robin is magnanimous and never in any conscious rivalry with his companions, but the child in the normative scene betrays his insecurities and desire for center stage when he asks his father a bit anxiously, \"Was Pooh's pencil case any better than mine?\" (WP, 161). In the narrative frame Christopher Robin seems a bit like the impressionable Piglet wishing for glory:\n\n(\"Was that me?\" said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, hardly daring to believe it.\n\n\"That was you.\"\n\nChristopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got larger and larger, and his face got pinker and pinker.)(WP, 10)\n\nSuch overt insecurity and impressionability is absent in the Christopher Robin of the fantasy tales, for there he is transformed from a timid, dependent child to a wish-fulfilling image of loving paternal authority. To the inhabitants of the Forest, Christopher Robin is their protector and the ultimate representation of authority and wisdom. It is he who is described as \"the only one in the forest who could spell\" (WP, 48) and who writes the notices for Owl's door, he who is the omniscient figure sitting in the tree above the wandering Pooh and Piglet and who knows long before they do what the \"Woozle\" tracks signify. It is he who had once told Piglet a story that suggests to the small animal the means of his rescue from his flooded home. Moreover, it is clearly he to whom all the characters turn in their times of need: Rabbit believes Christopher Robin will find a way to extricate Pooh from his home; Piglet races to Christopher Robin's house, knowing only he can save him from \"a Hellible Horralump … a Hoffable Hellerump!\" (WP, 70); Kanga is not frightened when she discovers Roo has been kidnapped, \"for she felt quite sure that Christopher Robin would never let any harm happen to Roo\" (WP, 103).\n\nIndeed, Piglet seems to speak for all the others when, on the trip to the North Pole, he tells Pooh, \"If Christopher Robin is coming I don't mind anything\" (WP, 115). Christopher Robin serves as a loving and reassuring leader. Although he believes Pooh can more easily be pushed back inside Rabbit's home, he respects Rabbit's wishes and agrees not to try that route. At times he calls Pooh a \"Silly old Bear,\" but he does so fondly, and when Pooh asserts \"I am a Bear of No Brain at All,\" Christopher Robin assures him, \"You're the Best Bear in All the World\" (WP, 43).\n\nNo matter what foibles Pooh displays, Christopher Robin is always loving, forgiving, assuring, and never chastising. He has become, in this world, all that he is not in the normative world of the narrative frame. Yet this depiction of Christopher Robin as adult caretaker is undercut throughout the story, so that the childlike ego of the Christopher Robin hearing these tales is soothed but, true to the power of the narrator-father, never really allowed control. Christopher Robin's knowledge is, in large part, only a facade. His spelling, after all—\"PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID\" (WP, 48)—leaves something to be desired; he is unable to put his boots on without help; he does not really know what the North Pole is or how to find it; and his pronouncement that \"there's an East Pole and a West Pole, though people don't like talking about them\" (WP, 135) is only one of the many rationalizations he makes to disguise his lack of knowledge. Although in some ways probably echoing the responses of adults in the normative world who evade children's questions, it is clear that Christopher Robin's \"careless\" comments are frequent disguises of his lack of knowledge. This facade, which is never broken by the animals, provides a gentle satire that allows the reader to puncture the pretense of the character Christopher Robin but leaves him, within the narrative context of the story, unscathed.\n\nIn The House at Pooh Corner Christopher Robin comes more into his own. His role in Winnie-the-Pooh is largely peripheral. There, he is not involved in many of the adventures, and he often appears at the end of chapters as a type of deus ex machina. His presence, which is frequently more felt than seen, allows the characters to have a sense of safety, the Forest a mood of benevolence. In The House at Pooh Corner, though, the focus is frequently on Christopher Robin—where he is, what he is doing, and how his growing up is affecting the Forest. Christopher Robin is still loving, but here we find an older boy, one who faces the challenges of the world beyond the Forest. This Christopher Robin no longer fakes knowledge, as he had during his expedition to the North Pole, nor does he say things as \"carelessly\" as he had in Winnie-the-Pooh. Like the older Christopher Robin in Now We Are Six, this child often recognizes his limitations and reveals his anxieties.\n\nChristopher Robin leaves the Forest, both for play and work. The first time we see him in this book, Eeyore has knocked at his door, and we are told that \"Christopher Robin had spent the morning indoors going to Africa and back, and he had just got off the boat and was wondering what it was like outside\" (HPC [The House at Pooh Corner ], 11). There is no narrative frame in this story, and the power of Christopher Robin's ability to create worlds on his own is demonstrated in his interior fantastic journey to far-off lands. Now conscious of the world outside the Forest, he has brought some of that knowledge into his imaginings to redefine his landscape of play, and while he is still interested in the Forest, he has now found other fantasy worlds.\n\nChristopher Robin's exposure to the outside world and his inculcation of it is evident in the successive notes he leaves on his door when he goes to school in the mornings. \"Gon out. Backson\" (HPC, 81) is followed by the more self-important and urgent \"GON OUT / BACKSON / BISY / BACKSON\" (HPC, 78), and finally the more lucid \"GONE OUT / BACK SOON\" (HPC, 91) reveals the change and development of the young child. School has entered the Forest, at least through the experiences of Christopher Robin, and this change is evident in his interactions with the other characters. Christopher Robin is still seen as the protector of the Forest. He finds Pooh and Piglet in their Heffalump trap and helps them out; he comes up with the idea of how to get Tigger and Roo out of the tree; and Piglet seeks him out to rescue Pooh and Owl from Owl's house.\n\nThis is also, however, a Christopher Robin who shows intentional indirection, in a much more sophisticated way than his earlier attempts to evade questions of which he was unsure. Such indirection is evident, for example, when he asks, \"What would you do, if your house was blown down?\" (HPC, 161), in a tacit attempt to ask Piglet's approval for Eeyore's appropriation of his house. This is also a young boy who feels anxieties. When he comes upon Pooh and Piglet who had been lost in the Forest, he remarks, \"'Oh, there you are,'… trying to pretend that he hadn't been Anxious\" (125). Here, for the first time, the facade of Christopher Robin's control of the Forest is directly punctured by the narrator, and we see a child who is fallible and even fearful. Anxiety marks his entrance to the world beyond the Forest, and, in response, the Forest has become for him a place to escape such fears and pressures. Rather than the animals seeking out Christopher Robin for comfort, he now seeks the Forest as a place of respite and is especially pleased with their company when they come for visits. He goes to the Forest \"just as if twice nineteen didn't matter a bit … and he thought that if he … watched the river slipping slowly away beneath him, then he would suddenly know everything that there was to be known\" (HPC, 105).\n\nThe Forest has been the place of childhood play where one can do \"Nothing,\" but as Christopher Robin tells Pooh, \"I'm not going to do Nothing any more.… They don't let you\" (HPC, 178). After he tells Pooh of the things of the world beyond the Forest that he has learned at school, his sadness and fear of losing his toy friends is palpable. His earnest vow to return to the Forest—\"Yes, Pooh, I will be [here] really. I promise I will be, Pooh\" (HPC, 179)—speaks more of his anxiety than his certainty. As they sit at Galleon's Lap, Christopher Robin is clearly in two worlds. With his eyes on the world and his hand on Pooh's paw, he cannot express the fears he feels so keenly—\"'Pooh,' said Christopher Robin earnestly, 'if I—if I'm not quite—' he stopped and tried again—'Pooh, whatever happens, you will understand, won't you?'\" (HPC, 179). Like the child characters in Now We Are Six, Christopher Robin has left the egocentric childhood where his dreams of power were once fulfilled by his worlds of fantasy. Still longing for the reassurance of his childhood world, this Christopher Robin no longer believes in his own omnipotence, nor even in the power of the father-narrator to create a safe world for him. This child recognizes his vulnerability and realizes that he cannot stop time and that he must enter other worlds that will never offer him the power, assurance, and comfort of the Forest he had enjoyed in Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\nThe Toys\n\nJust as Christopher Robin's character was quickly identified with the \"real\" Christopher Milne, readers have been fascinated by the \"real\" toys that served as models for Christopher Robin's Forest companions. It seems somehow fitting that it was Pooh Bear that started it all: for Christopher's first birthday he received the stuffed bear that he later described as \"my inseparable companion\" (C. Milne, 90). Several months later he received a stuffed donkey as a Christmas present, and a stuffed Piglet was later given to him by a neighbor. It was from these toys, and Christopher's games with them in the nursery, that the characters of Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner began.\n\nBy this time the importance of the toys was not lost on his father, and when a stuffed kangaroo and tiger were given to the young boy, the toys were chosen \"not just for the delight they might give to their new owner, but also for their literary possibilities\" (C. Milne, 91).4 To suggest that the toys all came complete with their personalities would serve to diminish Milne's creative process to mere transcribing. Indeed, some toys—such as the donkey Eeyore, whose neck had collapsed a bit and \"this had given him his gloomy disposition\" (C. Milne, 90)—did suggest the personalities they would have in the stories. Owl and Rabbit, however, were inventions of Milne, with no like toys owned by his son. And although Milne had said, \"Making it all sound very simple, you only had to look at them to see at once that Eeyore was gloomy, Piglet squeaky, Tigger bouncy and so on,\" as Christopher Milne asserts, \"of course there was much more to it than that\" (C. Milne, 91).\n\nThe character toys are typified by distinct personalities, yet they should not be simply dismissed as one-dimensional. To be satisfied with rote associations—defining Pooh, for example, only as a \"Bear of Very Little Brain\" or Piglet as simply fearful—is to ignore some of the ways these characters are developed throughout these stories. As critic Peter Hunt has argued, \"The characters in the Pooh books are remarkably, subtle, given the few words that Milne has available to him.… To say that … Piglet is timid, Rabbit bossy, Eeyore gloomy, Tigger bouncy, and Kanga motherly is to underestimate them\" (Hunt 1988, 403).5 Of all of the characters in Milne's children's stories, it is perhaps Winnie-the-Pooh himself, the self-described \"Bear of Very Little Brain,\" who is the most frequently underestimated.\n\nSir Pooh de Bear\n\nIn many ways Winnie-the-Pooh is, as Christopher Robin fondly calls him, a \"Silly old Bear.\" He thinks he can trick bees into believing he is only a rain-cloud; he gets stuck in Rabbit's door because of his overactive appetite; he circles a tree following only his own pawprints, believing somehow he is on the trail of elusive Woozles; he is impressed by Owl's writing ability; he does not know his left from his right; and he never quite understands Eeyore's sarcasm. Although these incidents are comic, at the end of The House at Pooh Corner the bear's fear of being left behind because of his lack of brain is poignant:\n\nThen he began to think of all the things Christopher Robin would want to tell him when he came back from wherever he was going to, and how muddling it would be for a Bear of Very Little Brain to try and get them right in his mind. \"So, perhaps,\" he said sadly to himself, \"Christopher Robin won't tell me any more,\" and he wondered if being a Faithful Knight meant that you just went on being faithful without being told things. (HPC, 178)\n\nIn his lack of intellectual ability and his frequent and humble acknowledgment of his limitations, Pooh serves as Christopher Robin's alter ego. As in the poem \"The Friend\" in Now We Are Six, the child who worries about the pressures of education and growing up finds solace in being able to experience an intellectually superior role over a toy companion who will never grasp rudimentary lessons. Pooh becomes a perfect companion for this young child. Always friendly and willing to please, lovable precisely because he is often so silly, and certainly someone never to feel intimidated by, Pooh comforts Christopher Robin and reifies the boy's sense of self.\n\nThe bear becomes an alter ego to Christopher Robin in a new way in The House at Pooh Corner. Still a bit bumbling and never able to understand what Christopher Robin learns at school, this constant companion is also the childhood that the boy must ultimately leave behind. In the first storybook Pooh is a would-be Woozle-tracker and Heffalump-catcher, enjoying the prospect of adventure. In The House at Pooh Corner, however, although he does build a house for Eeyore, much more of his time is spent visiting with friends and hence unifying the inhabitants of the Forest, and more often than that, just resting.
