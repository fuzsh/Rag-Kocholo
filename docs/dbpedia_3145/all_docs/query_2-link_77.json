        "text": "Wedding Photography at Old Marylebone Town Hall 2024\n\n**I’m taking bookings for weddings at this venue for 2024-25 now!**\n\nI am privileged to provide photography for weddings at Old Marylebone Town Hall regularly, and have photographed in all 7 ceremony rooms numerous times. The venue is photographer-friendly, and happily, they have no restrictions on this central part of your wedding day.\n\nWestminster Register Office is the perfect venue for your civil wedding, and I take natural and fun images of the best moments from your day. My photography is all about relationships and fun and intimate interactions between family and friends on the most special day of your life…\n\nRead on for information, tips, and advice on photography for your ceremony at this amazing venue, including what to expect and many examples of my relaxed and friendly photographic style.\n\nAre You Planning Your Wedding at Old Marylebone Town Hall?\n\nI photograph discreetly and unobtrusively to capture the best moments of your day.\n\nWith me as your wedding photographer, your memories will be in safe hands, so please get in touch any time to discuss…\n\nCHECK MY AVAILABILITY\n\nArrival at Your Westminster Register Office Wedding\n\nOn arrival, one of the efficient ushers greets you. Your guests may have to wait outside while you go for your pre-wedding interview, which they allow photography of.\n\nThe bride and groom may arrive at Old Marylebone Town Hall together or separately, as is traditional. The registrars can keep couples apart if required – many do, but some choose to enter together, especially at smaller weddings.\n\nI like to arrive to photograph all the arrivals, but people want to see photos of the bride’s arrival most!\n\nI arrive to photograph your arrival but tend to stay with your guests to capture the moments you’ll miss. Your family and friends are shown upstairs and seated when the ceremony room is ready.\n\nUseful to Know When Booking Your Wedding at Old Marylebone Town Hall\n\nYou can contact the registrars by calling 020 7641 7500 or emailing registeroffice@westminster.gov.uk.\n\nYou are allowed 25 minutes before the ceremony to access and gather in the venue room. I use this time to photograph your guests as they arrive.\n\nThe A Day to Remember website is the official site dedicated to weddings in Westminster and covers all the licensed venues in the borough.\n\nOpen evenings are held one Thursday a month, between 5.30 and 7.30pm. Contact the venue to book your place.\n\nIn addition to civil marriages, Old Marylebone Town Hall also conducts civil ceremonies, renewals of vows, and naming ceremonies, and it allows photography of them all.\n\nWedding Ceremony Photography in Westminster\n\nHappily, the wedding photographer at Old Marylebone Town Hall is not restricted. Even in the smallest rooms, I am given free movement, but I try to remain discrete and not distract you or your registrars.\n\nCouples are usually so engaged with the registrar and concentrating on getting everything right that they don’t often notice me. They always say how quickly it goes, so my advice is to savour every moment and be assured that I am recording it all for you to look back on in the years to come.\n\nI try to shoot from all angles for a good variety of images. Below, I include a series of photographs that demonstrate this:\n\nAlso Consider>> Islington Town Hall for your Wedding.\n\nHaving an LGBTQ+ Wedding?>> Read My Same-Sex Wedding Photography FAQs Here\n\nPhotographing the Wedding Signing at Old Marylebone Town Hall\n\nThe Westminster registrars are very friendly and helpful. Best of all, they work well with the photographer and have no restrictions...\n\nThe traditional wedding register has now gone online, replaced by a schedule at the end of the ceremony. Westminster was always relaxed about the photographer taking photos of the signing, so not much has changed. The most obvious change is that the registrar sends your certificate by post after your day, so sadly, there is no more presentation.\n\nOld Marylebone Town Hall's Wedding Photography Rooms\n\nThere are 7 rooms to choose from for your marriage ceremony. Here is a list of them, including my highlights of what makes them unique:\n\nThe Soho Room:\n\nSoho is the second most popular room in Westminster Council House and seats 13 guests. Again, it is light and airy with a carved feature fireplace and stunning chandelier. The room is painted in a muted pale green.\n\nThe Knightsbridge Room:\n\nThis exceptionally light and airy room seats up to 30 guests comfortably. I love the blue/grey velvet seating and large windows at the back.\n\nThe Marylebone Room:\n\n12 seated guests. With its deep and glossy wood panelling, this room is darker than others but no less striking. The sculpted plaster ceiling and modern chandelier finish the room nicely. I love to take wedding photos in this room.\n\nThe Paddington Room:\n\nOld Marylebone Town Hall's Paddington Room holds 8 seated guests. It is similar to The Marylebone Room, with dark panelling, a magnificent, matching carved wooden fireplace, and a modern chandelier.\n\nThe Pimlico Room:\n\nLight, bright and fantastic for photography, the Pimlico Room seats 20 guests and is decorated in pale green with a period feature fireplace.\n\nThe Westminster Room:\n\nThe largest and most popular room at Old Marylebone Town Hall seats up to 100 guests - suitable for a larger wedding party. 'Westminster' has dark wood panelling, but it is the lightest panelled room with 3 large windows facing the couple and guests, making it fantastic for your photography.\n\nThe Mayfair Room:\n\nThe Mayfair Room can accommodate 30 seated guests. With tasteful modern lighting, grey walls, aubergine, and rose gold touches, it is a fantastic venue for your small wedding day. There is also plenty of room for your photographer to move around.\n\nConfetti and Congratulations at Old Marylebone Town Hall\n\nAfter your ceremony, an usher will keep you inside until your guests leave. This allows me to photograph a few portraits of you in the venue before leaving the building to organise your guests into a confetti 'aisle'.\n\nConfetti is encouraged, and I will check in with an usher to see how much time we'll have before moving on. Weekends can be hectic, so the time could be short.\n\nHow I Organise the Confetti Photography Sequence\n\nThere is plenty of space to be creative with the confetti sequence on the steps outside Old Marylebone Town Hall. I ask the guests to stand on the inside of the handrails evenly from the pillars at the top down the steps. For small or very large wedding parties, I adapt accordingly. I then step them forward so there is less distance as the couple passes through.\n\nWhen the couple leaves the old town hall and descends the steps, I ask everyone to throw the confetti up and high so that it showers down for a spectacular sequence of photos.\n\nImportant Confetti Tip:\n\nI advise using colourful, large paper confetti rather than small dried petals, as the latter shows up more effectively in the images. Where possible, choose biodegradable paper.\n\nPosed Couple and Group Shots\n\nOutside, the area between the front door and the two central pillars offers stunning directional light. This makes an excellent location for some small group wedding portraits, especially of the bride and groom.\n\nDepending on the day, couples are allowed time for their photographer to arrange and take some group shots on the steps. The turnover of weddings on a Saturday is high, so there is less time before being asked politely to move on. Ideally, there will be time for all the required family photos, a large group shot of everyone present and some of the couple on their own.\n\nThe local area provides many opportunities for photography, including Baker Street Station and Regent's Park...\n\nA Handy Photography Dodge\n\nIf your posed wedding photographs are cut short, there is a little cheat:\n\nThe London Business School is just next door and is part of the same building. If the wedding party has to move on prematurely, I often finish the group portraits there. It's handy to book a photographer who knows how the venue runs.\n\nOld Marylebone Town Hall Wedding Photography FAQs\n\nQ. WHAT IS THE LIGHT LIKE FOR PHOTOGRAPHY INSIDE OLD MARYLEBONE TOWN HALL?\n\nA. Natural light varies across the 7 ceremony rooms. All rooms have window light, but some are darker than others due to their original features. A good wedding photographer can cope with extreme lighting, so the dark panelling of a couple of the venue rooms will pose no problem. The decoration is tasteful, with light and neutral tones or darker panels in the 7 ceremony rooms.\n\nQ. IS CONFETTI ALLOWED ON THE ICONIC STEPS OUTSIDE?\n\nA. An Old Marylebone Town Hall wedding wouldn't be the same without a chance for your photographer to capture the sequence as you exit the building and descend the steps in a shower of confetti. So, yes - the venue encourages using biodegradable confetti to finish your Westminster nuptials. There is even a form on the Day to Remember website to order confetti, ready for collection on your day.\n\nQ. HOW LONG ARE WE GIVEN FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AFTER OUR CEREMONY?\n\nA. A few minutes are allowed for portrait photography after the ceremony. The time allowance greatly depends on the venue's busyness, and the photographer is sometimes rushed. Sometimes, the wedding party can remain for photos in the room, although this is unlikely on busy Saturdays.\n\nPhotography can take place inside or outside, but confetti happens on the steps outside the venue. If confetti is essential to you, prioritise it and ask your photographer to organise it first to avoid disappointment. Venue staff are amicable and helpful, and it's always worth checking in with them for guidance on time rather than rushing.\n\nQ. ARE DOGS ALLOWED TO ATTEND OUR OLD MARYLEBONE TOWN HALL WEDDING?\n\nA. Yes, the venue is dog-friendly, and they are allowed to attend. Mention this before your day so they can note that a dog will be present.\n\nThe Old Marylebone Town Hall,\n\nWestminster Council House,\n\n97-113 Marylebone Road,\n\nLondon NW1 5PT.\n\nhttps://www.westminster.gov.uk/\n\nOld Marylebone Town Hall Wedding Photographer - Guy Milnes Photography."
