        "text": "(1882–1956)\n\nBritish writer, noted especially for his ever-popular children's books and his plays.\n\nAfter attending Westminster School and reading mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, Milne found his métier as assistant editor of Punch (1906–19). During World War I he served as a signalling officer until invalided out of the army. In 1917 his first play, Wurzel Flummery, was produced and was followed by a string of successful light comedies: Mr. Pim Passes By (1919), The Truth About Blayds (1921), The Dover Road (1922), and The Great Broxopp (1923). The Fourth Wall (1928) was a clever murder mystery and in 1929 came the first production of Toad of Toad Hall, his dramatization of The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame.\n\nMilne's most famous work, however, was the series of nursery stories written for his young son Christopher Robin, who was born in 1920: Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) and The House at Pooh Corner (1928). He also wrote two collections of verses for children; When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We Are Six (1927). In the 1930s Milne turned to essays and short stories. Peace With Honour (1934) is a strong plea against war. His autobiography It's Too Late Now came out in 1939. He also wrote the novels Two People (1931) and Chloe Marr (1946). In 1952, the year that his last work, Year In, Year Out, appeared, he suffered a stroke and retired to his Sussex home, where he died."
