        "text": "At Westminster, there are 11 houses in total; six have boarders as well as day pupils and all have a mix of boys and girls. The six boarding houses have a dedicated matron and all pupils have access to our state-of-the-art Health Centre, run by our experienced School Nursing Sister. The houses each have their own leisure spaces, study areas and dedicated places for pupils to relax, socialise and study.\n\nIn addition to the activities of the wider school, every house has its own community life. Individual houses stage annual concerts and plays, compete in sporting competitions, and organise social outings and events for all pupils.\n\nEach pupil is allocated a personal tutor within their house and they meet together both formally and informally each week. Wherever possible, pupils stay with the same tutor throughout their time at the school, meaning that the tutor can become familiar with the pupil’s interests, abilities and achievements. This is vital in helping the tutor act as an informed mentor and sounding-board for the pupil, helping them navigate school life, juggle academic and extra-curricular activities, make subject choices and finalise university decisions. This support of each pupil is enacted in partnership with their housemaster and the two together form the backbone of the pastoral care network within each house, with the housemaster acting as the main point of contact for parents.\n\nThe combination of support from a pupil’s housemaster, tutor and wider house community is invaluable in helping them to not only make the most of their time at Westminster but to develop and flourish as whole individuals."
