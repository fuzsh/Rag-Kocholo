        "text": "Harold Adrian Russell “Kim\" Philby was an adequate rather than spectacular cricketer at Westminster School. When fielding, he was content to stand apart from the rest, observing events at a distance. His preferred position? Deep cover. So it would be for much of his adult life.\n\nThe label often attaching to Philby, the most prominent member of the Cambridge Ring, is that of “master spy\", a description conveying ruthlessness, guile and charm. Britain’s most infamous Cold War traitor, whose betrayal resulted in the deaths of untold numbers of agents operating on the dark side of the Iron Curtain, possessed those qualities, certainly. But his charm was not simply of the synthetic kind and he commanded the affection and loyalty of friends, even as the awful truth of his clandestine career – a Soviet asset ­operating at the heart of British intelligence – became clear.\n\nThe Telegraph London"
