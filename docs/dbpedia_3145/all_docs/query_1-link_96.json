        "text": "A. A. Milne\n\nplaywright, screenwriter, author of mystery novels and children's stories, collector of short stories\n\nAlan Alexander Milne was born in London on January 18, 1882, the third son of a schoolmaster. A gifted mathematician, at the age of 11 he won a scholarship to the Westminster School. He then went on to Trinity College, Cambridge University, from which he received his degree in mathematics in 1903.\n\nDespite his mathematical gifts, Milne was determined to be a writer. In 1906, he became an assistant editor of the satirical magazine Punch, where he remained until 1914. Most of his early books were collections of stories originally published in Punch.\n\nIn 1913, Milne married Dorothy de Selincourt, and soon after moved to a house in London's Chelsea section. He spent about a year serving in France during World War I before developing trench fever and being sent home. His only son, Christopher Robin, was born in 1920.\n\nIn 1925, Milne wrote a Christmas story for the Evening News called \"Winnie the Pooh,\" which was based on Christopher and his favorite teddy bear. The story proved so popular that, in 1926, he expanded the story into the book Winnie the Pooh; the sequel, The House at Pooh Corner, was released in 1928. Both Pooh books, as well as most of his Milne's other children's books, were illustrated by E.H. Shepard. The Pooh books now rank among the most popular of all children's books.\n\nA stroke in 1952 left him an invalid, and he died on January 31, 1956.\n\nWorks\n\nLovers in London (1905)\n\nThe Day's Play (1910)\n\nThe Holiday Round (1912)\n\nOnce a Week (1914)\n\nHappy Days (1915)\n\nOnce on a Time (1917)\n\nWurzel-Flummery (play--1917)\n\nThe Boy Comes Home (1918)\n\nMake-Believe (children's play--1918)\n\nBelinda (1918)\n\nMr. Pim Passes By (comic play--1919)\n\nThe Camberley Triangle (1919)\n\nNot That It Matters (1919)\n\nThe Stepmother (1920)\n\nThe Romantic Age (1920)\n\nIf I May (1920)\n\nThe Bump (screenplay--1920)\n\nFive Pounds Reward (screenplay--1920)\n\nBookworms (screenplay--1920)\n\nThe Sunny Side (1921)\n\nThe Great Broxopp: Four Chapters in Her Life (play--1921)\n\nThe Truth About Blayds (comic play--1921)\n\nThe Dover Road (comic play--1922)\n\nThe Red House Mystery (detective novel--1922)\n\nBerlud, Unlimited (1922)\n\nThe Man in the Bowler Hat (1924)\n\nTo Have the Honour (play--1924)\n\nWhen We Were Very Young (collection of children's poems--1924)\n\nAriadne; Or, Business First (play--1924)\n\nA Gallery of Children (1925)\n\nFor the Luncheon Interval (1925)\n\nKing Hilary and the Beggarman (1926)\n\nPortrait of a Gentleman in Slippers: A Fairy Tale (play--1926)\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh (1926)\n\nNow We Are Six (collection of children's poems--1927)\n\nThe Ivory Door: A Legend (1927)\n\nMiss Marlow at Play (1927)\n\nThe House at Pooh Corner (1928)\n\nThe Ascent of Man (1928)\n\nGentleman Unknown (1928)\n\nMichael and Mary (1929)\n\nBy Way of Introduction (1929)\n\nToad of Toad Hall (play adaptation of The Wind in the Willows--1929)\n\nThe Christopher Robin Story Book (1929)\n\nThe Secret and Other Stories (1929)\n\nThose Were the Days (1929)\n\nBirds of Prey (screenplay--1930)\n\nTwo People (1931)\n\nFour Day's Wonder (mystery novel--1933)\n\nOther People's Lives (1933)\n\nPeace with Honour: An Enquiry into War Convention (1934)\n\nMiss Elisabeth Bennet (play adaptation of Pride and Prejudice--1936)\n\nSarah Simple (1937)\n\nIt's Too Late Now (autobiography--1939)\n\nWar With Honour (1940)\n\nWar Aims Unlimited (1941)\n\nThe Ugly Duckling (1941)\n\nOne Year's Time (1942)\n\nChloe Marr (1946)\n\nGoing Abroad?
