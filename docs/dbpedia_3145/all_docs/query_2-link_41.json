        "meta_description": "Winnie-the-Pooh, also known as Pooh Bear and Pooh, is a fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear developed by English writer A. A. Milne along with English artist E. H. Shepard. The book Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) had been the very very first collection of stories about The character, followed by the home at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne published a poem about the bear in the children's poem collection Whenever we Were Very Young (1924) along with a lot more in Now We're 6 (1927). E. H. Shepard supplied the illustrations for the four volumes. The Pooh stories are transcribed into a number of languages, like Alexander Lenard's Latin translation, Winnie ille Pu, which launched in 1958 and became The 1st Latin book to be listed on the brand new York Times Best Seller list in 1960 . In 1961, Walt Disney Productions acquired part of the movie rights along with other rights to Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories from the estate of A. A. Milne and Stephen Slesinger, Inc., and changed the Pooh stories into a number of animated features under the unhyphenated name \"Winnie the Pooh.\" the series will become among Disney's best selling franchises.
