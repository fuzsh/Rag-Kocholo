        "text": "Anne Milne carries the look of the persecuted. She sighs and groans as Brian, her husband, a pile of carefully rolled cigarettes beside him, talks of his ideas. She had sounded pained to hear from me when I called. 'I had thought it was all over,' she told me later, in their conservatory. They are, respectively, secretary and chairman of Tiree Art Enterprises.\n\nAs such, the Milnes are ultimately responsible for An Turas, the 'shelter' built on the pier at Scarinish. This piece of art - a long corridor of white walls, followed by a wooden bridge and a glass box - has received acclaim from around the country, and disapprobation from the Milne's fellow islanders.\n\nIt is clear that while Brian, the art teacher at Tiree high school, is enjoying the company of the artists and architects who have travelled across a small slice of the Atlantic to see An Turas, Anne, who works at the local bank, has been troubled by what the neighbours say. For her, it seems, the opinions of her peers weigh heavily.\n\nAn Turas was unveiled last year and quickly shortlisted for the Stirling Prize before going on to win the annual award of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland.\n\nI am late into this story but have just seen An Turas for the first time. If you've been to Tiree, you will know this is a machair island, with vast skies, shell-white beaches and water whipped white by a wind as constant as the black rock. It is, I think, perfectly suited to modern architecture.\n\nTo walk on the island just now is to disturb the endless geese and snipe that winter here. The houses, with their thick white walls and, in many cases, tar roofs, reek of the fires within. Land Rovers travel the beaches in search of the few bits of driftwood that lie there, bored through by sea-worm. The minister's sermon was on 1 Samuel 15, in which God disowns Saul for showing mercy to his enemies.\n\nAn Turas plays with these elements. It has the two white walls that match the houses. Its bridge is roofed in tar. The glass box breaks through a dry-stone dyke and opens on to the full sweep of Gott Bay. As I walked along its passageway, I realised that this was one of those pieces of art that works so well that it touches all the earlier experiences and accentuates them. It feels perfect, in that way the Angel of the North, up on its hill above Gateshead, feels perfect when you glance up at it from the train to London.\n\nYet, there is no shortage of disdain for An Turas on Tiree. Angus MacLean, former chairman of the Tiree and CollGaelic Partnership, has been quoted as saying it is a monstrosity. 'I don't see any sense to the thing at all,' he told a ne wspaper. 'It cost a lot of money to produce and it doesn't fit in. All the people I speak to feel the same. I just won't go near it. It is supposed to be a shelter, but it isn't even suitable for that purpose.'\n\nBeing a modernist in such places is always difficult. Apart from conservative reactions like that of MacLean, there are issues of deprivation to deal with. The criticism that has stung the Milnes the most has been local disgust at Â£100,000 of lottery money being spent on a 'useless' piece of art at a time when the community was struggling to raise funds for a new stock mart and a new hall. Buy food from Scarnish Co-op without a loyalty card and you'll be asked if you are willing to donate the credit to the hall.\n\nThis is understandable. A hall is absolutely crucial to a rural community such as Tiree's, where the places to socialise are few and far between. And if you believe that islands like Tiree have to exist independently of tourism, then the mart is equally important. It is also a misplaced criticism. The money spent on An Turas could never have been used for such things. It came from the Scottish Arts Council's Lottery Fund. If An Turas hadn't received the cash, it would have gone elsewhere. Money for the mart and hall has since been found.\n\nThe Milnes should now stand proud, for they have done something remarkable. These days, not damaging the Highlands and Islands has become synonymous with not touching them, of trying to preserve them as they were. So the ancients could build their brochs, and the crofters their blackhouses, but we must not mark the landscape in response to the way it touches us. These days we no longer need to protect ourselves from invasion, nor struggle quite so torturously on the land, but that doesn't mean in a landscape this exquisite we should not meet it with the best we have.\n\nSeveral years ago a poll was conducted of Tiree's islanders, asking what they thought of Tiree Art Enterprises. Funnily enough, people said they should do more. Well, here it is: An Turas, 'a journey' in Gaelic, a 'shelter' exposed over half its length to a constantly changing sky.\n\nIt has reminded me of what I dream of for my native Highland landscape, imaginations that reach for the horizons. I only hope that the roasting the Milnes have received will allow the ground to cool for others to follow."
