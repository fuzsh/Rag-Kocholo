        "text": "Alan Alexander Milne was born on January 18, 1882, in London, England. He was the youngest of three sons. His father was a schoolmaster. Milne was a good student and enjoyed mathematics and writing. He attended Westminster School in London and then Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nAfter finishing school, Milne wrote for newspapers and magazines. He married in 1913. In 1920 Milne had a son named Christopher Robin.\n\nMilne started writing children’s verse and stories shortly after his son was born. His two books of verse were popular with children and parents: When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We Are Six (1927). Around that time he published Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) and The House at Pooh Corner (1928). He modeled his characters for the Winnie-the-Pooh books after his own son and the stuffed animals his son played with. Ernest Shepard illustrated all four of Milne’s children’s books. Milne invited Shepard to his home to draw his son and the toy animals. The illustrations go well with Milne’s humorous writing.\n\nMilne also wrote Toad of Toad Hall, a play version of the classic children’s book The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame. For adults he wrote popular, humorous plays and an autobiography, It’s Too Late Now (1939). He died on January 31, 1956, in Hartfield, Sussex, England."
