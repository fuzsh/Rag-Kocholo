        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe intellect of a child's mind is utterly fascinating to me, so much so that for the past three summers, I have studied the poetry of children's literature such as \"Mother Goose Rhymes,\" \"The Real Mother Goose,\" \"Where the Sidewalk Ends,\" \"A Light in the Attic,\" and \"Falling Up.\" I have met children who can recite every word of \"The Cat in the Hat\" and \"Green Eggs and Ham,\" although they could not yet read. At story time each day, I would read to the children the story of \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" by A. A. Milne published by Dutton Children's Books. There are a few reasons why young people and older people alike enjoy A. A. Milne's \"Winnie the Pooh.\" First, the stories are believable, despite characters who speak and think with human intelligence. Second, the problems and adventures of the characters are relevant and significant. Third, the simple, clear writing style is attractive and compelling. Milne lived in England at the same time as the influential artist and writer, E. H. Shepard. Shepard illustrated Milne's \"Winnie the Pooh\" and \"The House at Pooh Corner,\" and it has been generally held that both books were highly revered by children. The Winnie of the books was an actual, live bear that roamed the London Zoo at the beginning of World War II, when Milne first recognized the bear's celebrity. \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" was originally published in 1926 and was soon followed by \"The House at Pooh Corner\" in 1928. Winnie the Pooh has never gone out of print and is one of the best-loved storybooks for children.\n\n1.1. Background of A.A. Milne\n\nIn writing the book that was to attain worldwide fame, A. A. Milne was turning from light essay and short story writing to a field in which his audience was to become phenomenally enlarged, along with his own material comfort. His reputation was such that his editors agreed to the move, and Ursula Nordstrom in the United States bought world rights for her firm's junior list. This was in March 1926. Three months later, Publicity decided that more copies of Winnie-the-Pooh than the 10,000 agreed upon would have to be printed. The initial publications in the United States and in England were still three months away. Dutton Publicity's judgment was accurate, and less than twelve months after the first appearance of the tales, they had been published in nine European languages, and a twentieth thousand copy first impression was on sale in England. There had already been a book about Pooh, for Winnie-the-Pooh himself had made his public appearance in 1924. Winnie-the-Pooh pre-dated the Pooh book by two years. Milne's account of Christopher Robin's Teddy Bear and his fantasies had appeared in his column 'Punch', in which the 'Bear' made a statement to the public that was to come to mean much to it both as a feature in a cult and as a market determinant: 'Excuse me, Mr. Edward Bear, but where are you going?' The question was posed in verse, an avenue in which A. A. Milne had already found critical and financial success. Prior to its insertion in a narrative prose context, 'Punch' owned Christopher Robin and the Teddy Bear, which in twenty-eight lines called at the zoo to see the bears, recited tea-time grace after asking if anybody knew, saw, and commented upon the Cat and the Chicken, which verses from Charles Mankowski's Lecky gave impetus to the Bear's canine identity, and went to bed without admitting there was going to be any 'story'.\n\n1.2. Significance of 'Winnie-the-Pooh' in Children's Literature\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh is probably the most popular children's book ever written. One would be hard-pressed to find a person who has not at one time enjoyed its honey-sweet characters. Children love it and so do adults, very often returning to the 'hundred-acre wood' even if it is out of nostalgia. A.A. Milne had no idea of the future popularity of his children's books. Winnie-the-Pooh is the book that not only established A.A. Milne's reputation as a literate writer but contributed to the reemergence of the popularity of children's stories. Winnie-the-Pooh's characters not only have a spirit and a depth that is missing from the fairy-tale characters but are given their own identity as well. Winnie-the-Pooh, too, has been given a great variety of voices by many people and every new reader finds a different voice for it. Winnie is a bear who has lived for some time in the East. He is a very friendly bear and used to buying different kinds of honey which he loves to eat. He is of medium size and likes it very much when people talk to him. They are not used to seeing a bear wearing a red shirt and walking around the forests of England. When they meet him for the very first time, he introduces himself: \"I am Winnie-the-Pooh, the bear of a very little brain.\"\n\n2. Character Analysis\n\nChristopher Robin - Christopher Robin appears in the poem as well as in the two books, Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner. When we are introduced to him, he is two years old and is given as a birthday present from his father a bear \"not very much bigger than a small doll\" with \"no clothes on whatever\". This is the bear whom we come to know as Pooh. Pooh is always called a \"very little bear\". He is no bigger than a four-year-old baby. There is no doubt that Christopher was an only child and, because of the difference in their ages, he found Pooh \"an ideal friend apart from Christopher Robin\", as is pointed out to him by \"the animals\" soon after his arrival. Winnie the Pooh - Winnie the Pooh is such a comical bear with such a pleasant way of pretending to be \"a Bear of Very Little Brain\" that no one, in his right senses, could possibly \"suspect\" that he was respectable. He has an inquiring mind although, as has been said, he pretends to have \"no brains\" at all. In order to obtain \"brains\", he pays a visit to Rabbit to \"see what there was to be done about that ... that being intelligence, of course\". In the poem, Pooh \"still has a very little brain and long words bother him\". Large words are troubling to little Pooh. When Rabbit reads a newspaper to him, he ignores him that Rabbit is spelling an invitation, presumably because Pooh is unable to cope with the three-letter word. Rabbit, consequently, is quite justified in protesting - \"What's this you are doing\"?\n\n2.1. Winnie-the-Pooh\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh, written by A. A. Milne and published in 1926, is a children's story about a stuffed bear whose label reads \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" and a boy named Christopher Robin who plays in the enchanted Hundred Acre Wood. Winnie-the-Pooh has a bear of very little brain and can't help himself because he has no brain at all. For example, in the book we read about the time he visits his friend Rabbit. Winnie-the-Pooh has no breakfast, so he goes to Rabbit to see what Rabbit is having for breakfast. Rabbit is very upset when Winnie-the-Pooh arrives. Why? Because Pooh has come to ask for some of Rabbit's honey. Rabbit knows that Winnie-the-Pooh is extremely slow-witted or lacks canny and gives Rabbit honey every day. After Pooh finishes Rabbit’s breakfast, Rabbit suggests the two of them go on an \"expotition\" to find some wood for guests Rabbit is expecting. The honey Pooh gets. While there, Pooh eats so much that he has difficulty falling asleep in Rabbit's house and is relieved in the morning to be able to get out through the hole in the wall where a passageway Rabbit dug especially for Winnie-the-Pooh. The story speaks to children about loyalty and friendship. Winnie-the-Pooh, who may not be particularly smart, is kind and thoughtful to his friends. As devoted readers of Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh childhood classic know, Pooh lives in a beautiful forest surrounded by greenery. Many animals, including Eeyore and Piglet, live in the same forest. In the book, Winnie-the-Pooh makes a picnic, Rabbit plans a party for the visitors, and Christopher Robin prepares an \"anti-complaint\" to prevent Eeyore from doing anything wrong. Since 1928, when the first collection of Pooh Bear stories was published, the characters have changed little. Christopher Robin requests a sequel. In 1928, Milne published what many consider the finest sequel of all time: The House on Pooh Corner.\n\n2.2. Piglet\n\nThat was the first sign that they saw of Piglet. He was a very small animal who had been feeling very small and very lonely because he was the only one of his friends who had not been to see Christopher Robin. And then he found that it was just the same the other way round, and that he was the only one who had seen Christopher Robin, so that was the first sign that they saw of Piglet. Christopher Robin's glove, sticking out of the hole in the ground, was the next sign they saw of him. And three or four small stones, pushed backwards and forwards in the sand, showed them where Owl had done his exercise until the time came, as it did very suddenly, for the Floating Bear to call out in a loud voice, and find out where everybody was. Piglet's small home, very small, was in a beech-tree, and the house was called The Beech Tree. There was a notice on the door which said: 'P. (which is short for Piglet) M. (which is short for Me) B. (which is short for Bear) and at first it seemed that this was all, but at the bottom somebody had made a mistake, and the notice was nearly the same all over again. The next tree was called The Big Tree, and that was called The Big Tree because it was a very big tree indeed: and the house was called The Big House. And that is the end of the chapter. But there will be another chapter and, in that chapter, more will be learned about The Big Tree. Wouldn't it be odd if the only bear in the world, who had not heard that Winnie-the-Pooh had come to live in the Forest at all, should be today, when he went there to lend a sixpence to Eeyore? What should we do? So, when the Bear had looked at the place which was now crowded with large, serious animals, all holding sticks and looking very anxious, and had asked the Kangaroo, who seemed to be the Bouncer what it was, and the Kangaroo had said that was a Surprise, and so did Christopher Robin, but what it was, and Pooh and Piglet had said that was a Surprise to look at the back of Piglet's head, and Pooh and Piglet had said what that was to Pooh and Eeyore, what do you want? Thank you very much for your trouble, but he would expect it this afternoon and if you will bring a bill with you I will help now. Then Pooh and Piglet sold Eeyore a map. Pooh and Piglet said they would be thinking about Eeyore's mood, to make it more interesting for him in the afternoon.\n\n2.3. Eeyore\n\nThe first thing we learn about Eeyore is that he is constantly gloomy – although it is difficult to say how much of this is continual unhappiness and how much is only an artistic pose, assumed in order to be more interesting. Certainly his friends are convinced that it is a pose. \"Is that so?\" inquired Eeyore, a little more interested. \"You don't feel very much like Pooh's bear, I don't suppose?\" \"I do,\" said Eeyore. \"Pooh's bear?\" \"I simply bob up and down into people's houses, saying, 'How about a little something?'\" It is typical that Eeyore should be envious of Pooh for receiving attention (whether of admiration or of sympathy) from the hostess whom they are visiting at the time… Next, he lives in the only house in the wood which is really a house, although he shares it with Owl; the other animals all occupy various natural holes or constructions. It is interesting to note that Owl's house is the same shape as \"real\" houses in children's imagination: he and Roo, who has been prescribed a sweet ration for having been insulted by Kanga, live in a place where it always seems to be tea-time; Piglet and Christopher Robin are both \"regular\" houses in a very natural manner, although Christopher Robin of course prefers to be a human being, and Eeyore neither. They are thus the three characters who are the closest to A.A. Milne himself. Only a donkey of Milne's intelligence (in the quite different sense of shrewdness) could construct a house, even quite a humble one, and understand the fine points of real estate, and Eeyore is known for his sense of humor along these lines; he endures, for example, Tigger's booming (and wholly non-euclidean) housewarming in Walnut Tree, good-naturedly, because it is also an occasion for promoting Rabbit who would have to look after the house if Pooh, Piglet and Eeyore left. I will return to this phenomenon later in the paper, but I mention it here as a sign of Eeyore's social and moral eminence.\n\n3. Themes in 'Winnie-the-Pooh'\n\nThe most apparent theme in Milne's text is the way children's imaginative worlds (or the imaginary world of a child named Christopher Robin) are treated in this text. The imaginative qualities of the stories, as well as their verbal repetition and reliance on memory systems, are notable features of these stories. Winnie-the-Pooh is a bear who is \"stuffed with fluff\" and who is naive despite much wishful thinking (in which he keeps trying but continues to be foiled). He has, however, a fierce loyalty to his friends and displays naive wisdom: \"When looking for something, it helps to know what you are looking for.\" In general, Winnie-the-Pooh's errors stem from areas of knowledge he lacks. For example, when Piglet goes missing, Pooh heads straight for Eeyore's house, as Eeyore is the only animal he can think of in the forest, out of whom one can fit a balloon. No thought of looking for the missing Piglet even occurs to him. Another major theme is the yearning for home. Winnie-the-Pooh yearns for the magic circle of Christopher Robin around him. This theme of borders is pervasive. Whether it is the railway station, or the magical threshold outside a child's room, or the domestic space within a house, the narratives invoke profound allegiances between the child, her friends, and the places they inhabit. So much of the action takes place at home and concerns the comings and goings of visitors, leading to recognition scenes, meanings, and expressions of love. The image of Christopher Robin walking through the forest, surveying his possessions, and trying to encase them all within a circle with his stick indicates his wish to fix his own circle of friends and familiar objects inseparably in time and in space. The characters seek each other in the mornings, they eat together during the day, and they find each other again at night. Winnie-the-Pooh is a bear with little brain, but life is simpler in the space of the children's games, which still possesses an element of infinite repletion and childlike valor. Small children epistemically limited by their lack of knowledge are able to enter this particular fictional space, free of adult deconstruction or intellectual interpretation. In such an innocent and playful world governed by simplicity, the animals experience safety, joy, and wonder.\n\n3.1. Friendship and Loyalty\n\nOne of Milne's themes is the importance of friendship. Friendship means valuing and caring about your friends. It means loyalty and kindness, and keeping the promises you make to your friends. Milne emphasizes both the value and the goodness of friendship, not only in his stories, but also in his introduction to the book, which is addressed to all children. In it, he writes, \"There are some people who begin the Zoo at the beginning, called the way you do it.\" Children who cannot precinct their zoo will be as interested as he is to know the zoo stories cannot tell. Instead, he sits down at the table and explains it to the little boy (or girl) who lives inside of him. \"So now,\" he says, \"we are going to hear the story of a very little boy and his friends.\" These words are interesting because they show the human side of Milne, implying that he is patient and kind. They also show that he values the story he is about to tell, and thinks about how it will be to the people who read it. The introduction itself reinforces the idea that child is telling the story. Therefore, even before the reader begins the book, Milne evokes the feeling that the story is already quite human, and that it explores special, good things that people can look for in others, things that make friends valuable. This theme of friendship and loyalty links the animal characters in the book with other characters in children's literature, but in Winnie-the-Pooh, they do not just simply have good qualities; they know how to share them with others.\n\n3.2. Imagination and Creativity\n\nThe single theme in the book that rises to the forefront and becomes unmistakable is the idea that the mind is both the creator and discoverer of all humorous and happy things. It embarks its creator on whatever flights of fancy become necessary to produce an event to which an original spin will be given and be thought out by him ahead of time. So the creative and lively mind, once it is turned on, may set all manner of logical and consequential events in motion, and yet amused and creative it fully as much as set up by what happens. At last, it becomes aware of what it is thinking, and how it is reacting is astonishing primarily because there are few persons who realize what their own ingenuity can come up with – amusing things such as a heffalump trap. Indeed, this imaginative side of himself confers upon Christopher Robin the persona of a father, regardless of the fact that he fulfills this position only intermittently amongst the animals. The state of yesterday’s playing ended, he variously caught up in both the characteristics of childishness and being immature – as a mother hen – and when he has the opportunity to imagine that he is their parent, he may instruct them in a world of natural fantasy that includes bread and butter, bedtime, and indeed necessities and everyday occurrences in human life! He simply wants to guide them from one simple event to the next in natural order. He is more shocked than they ultimately will be when everything goes funny, and he reacts as a presently grown-up in distress at what appears to him to be the near absence of real things and their real appearances. As with himself, so it is with their separate images; Christopher Robin is amazed that his friends have not learned to see that things are almost never as they appear, while they, upon reflection, do indeed recognize their misunderstandings. All they need remind themselves of is the idea of what imagination is and what it can do.\n\n4. Literary Techniques Used by A.A. Milne\n\nThe success of A.A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh is due largely to the author's unique way of revealing character and nature through the voices of his characters. The living toys can feel and see and do what we can, so they communicate in Silly Old Bear language quite often, which is simply a listenable combination of Milne's wit and the thoughts he is expressing. The contents of these toys are the direct opposite of what we have made of our toys. Rather, we feel the impact from our childhood, our own real-life traits shoved into a warm corner inside each one of us. Each toy is an impulsive and single-minded caricature of an identified human attribute. \"Piglet is a true worrier, Tigger is risky, Pooh is soft, and so on.\" Before conclusion, another comment is required, especially on the complex imagination Milne's child character has. That is what makes Pooh even more listenable than other literary animals. Gollum's ingenuity comes alive through the smokescreen of multitudes of creatures. Beatrix Potter's animals create environments involving their specific attributes such as digging, rolling, or storing. From beginning to end, the chapters are labeled \"In which\" when it comes to Pooh pondering aspects of the environment that must be dealt with. And from one end to the other, Milne, through his child-character Pooh, senses the world in which a British middle-class bear lived at the time.\n\n4.1. Humor and Playful Language\n\nHumor is obviously an important element in making Winnie-the-Pooh the sort of delightful children's stories that it is. But of all the ways to write humor, what are the principal methods favored by A. A. Milne? One humor technique much liked by children authors generally and one employed by A. A. Milne is concocting animals with charmingly ridiculous physical attributes. Eeyore's tail story is a famous example. Pooh's \"buckled hat\" for a head is another. The stories exhibit a number of such examples, including Eeyore mistaking Pooh's ear for a leaf, getting ready to jump into Owl's Very Deep Pit, and discovering himself annoyed by Piglet. In each case, the humor comes from the animals' success in passing quite human-like characteristics to the inanimate objects and elements around them, infusing these objects with humorously ridiculous personalities, and then bringing these personalities into conflict with the animals themselves. Another humor method much favored by A. A. Milne is amusing and often nonsensical or absurd is the banter throughout the stories. Pooh has himself a lot of very good lines, such as when Piglet goes to visit Christopher Robin and Pooh and Piglet discuss what Piglet ought to say to make a good impression on Christopher Robin. Piglet quotes what he plans to say: \"Hullo, Piglet, and who's your friend?\" Pooh adds that part of making a good impression involves not knowing too much, in case later there's a quiz: \"You say: 'Oh, nothing, whatever,' and then you look all bunged up, and you sigh and you see 'Isn't it a perfect day?' because it's always useful to say, 'Isn't it a perfect day,' in case it may not actually be a perfect day. And then, when you've said 'Isn't it a perfect day' long enough, you say, 'You said a little while ago, didn't you?' and then you wash your face and say, 'Well, well well,' when you come back and here you are. It's easy!\" In the stories, Milne is sufficiently ubiquitous in his use of badinage to comment about Pooh that \"Some people talk to animals. Not many listen though. That's the problem.\" but choose conversations that often are just a bit droll, if not quite so charming. Another humor method much favored by A. A. Milne is amusing malapropisms and other sorts of word play. The term \"hunny\" is most famous example of this, as how to spell various animal sounds. The method gives a particularly playful feeling to the stories, as if Milne himself really were just like his characters. Furthermore, the adjective of \"silly\" would become something endearing, encapsulating \"the best and newest and shiniest kind of words, such as the animals had never heard of before, and the best kind of flowing streams, and honey was beginning to think he might try to morally work them out that very afternoon and make Pooh's head..\" and \"silly\" could substitute as a kind of password, where only those who really were in the know would know exactly what the word meant.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn effect, despite claims that Winnie-the-Pooh is just about honey, about the innocence of a gentler bygone world, about friendship and support and sharing, and that it is sweet and nonjudgmental, it can be seen as an appropriation of an individual's innermost thoughts and as a ritual search and destruction of the poetry in them. Something which accuses the individual, the adult, of being appassionate. In that light, when we are touched by Pooh's helplessness in facing a life without honey, or when we empathize with Christopher Robin's reassuring and comforting him, it formalizes and ensures the strong sense of our own modern-day lives and situates it in a perfectly bourgeois intellectual context. Then, not even 'love and affection' can dirty our clothes and smudge our image. Nor are there any brambles in the wood which lead to this honey in the first place."
