        "text": "Location\n\nFulton is located 25 miles east of Columbia and 25 miles northeast of Jefferson City. Fulton is approximately seven miles south of the intersection of Interstate 70 and Highway 54. This intersection was at one time referred to by many as the crossroads of the nation.\n\nThe general elevation of Fulton averages about 800 feet above sea level. The average annual temperature is about 55 degrees Fahrenheit; January’s average is 31 degrees, and July’s average is 77.5 degrees. There are often abrupt and considerable variations, but the coldest temperature seldom drops beyond 20 degrees below zero, and the high temperatures sometimes reach over 100 degrees. The period between mid-April through mid-October is virtually without frost and provides a very important growing season for gardens.\n\nSettlement\n\nMissouri, like many other states, was settled along western migration paths. Mid-Missouri followed the Southern migration route, and Callaway County grew with travel on the Missouri River and along the Boone’s Lick Trail.\n\nFulton was founded in 1825, the same year it became the county seat. However, it was not incorporated until March 14, 1859.\n\nThe early residents of Fulton were from a predominantly Southern culture. The coastal and upland Southerners that settled on the land brought with them slaves and established an agricultural economy.\n\nGrowth\n\nIn 1880, Fulton had 11 churches, three public schools, a railroad depot, 10 lawyers, one police officer, two banks, four hotels, six restaurants, nine doctors, a fairground, an opera house, three saloons and a brewery, not to mention other routine mills and shops.\n\nAccording to information obtained from the Callaway County Public Library, Fulton’s population was 1,200 in 1853. It doubled by 1880, numbering at 2,409. It doubled once again to 4,883 in 1900. It then took 50 years to double again, reaching 10,052 in 1950. It reached 12,148 in 1970 and declined to 11,046 in 1980.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nIn Fulton’s early history, the Missouri General Assembly voted to establish an asylum for the insane there, the first mental health facility west of the Mississippi.\n\nThe way of life was changing rapidly all over the country in 1890, and Fulton was working feverishly to keep up. City roads and streets were not paved, and the clay soil in many areas made travel a painful undertaking during times of rain or melting snow. There were very few telephones, and sewers, water or electric lights were not yet developed. The wooden sidewalks had many boards in need of repair.\n\nThe first public water system appears to have been instituted around 1890, and electricity was first available in 1895. The first sewer lines and manholes were installed in 1904, but there was no sewage treatment plant until 1933.\n\nThe community of Fulton reflected the leading architectural styles of the day, perhaps because one of the area’s leading architects, Gen. M. Fred Bell, lived there. He was the architect of many Missouri state buildings.\n\nIn Fulton, Bell designed the New Palace Hotel. Built in 1879, it is three stories high. It stands on the northeast corner of Market Street and East Fifth Street. It originally had two entrances, one for men and one for women. It is still standing and has been used as a hotel through several remodels. Bell also designed the library, the State Hospital administration building, the School for the Deaf, the Chicago and Alton depot and the initial telephone exchange.\n\nEd Jameson established a real estate firm in 1884 with Bell, located on the east side of courthouse square. Jameson later moved his office to the Adams Building at the corner of Court and Fifth streets. According to an article reprinted by the Kingdom of Callaway Historical Society, this business was the headquarters in this city and vicinity for real estate investments, fire or tornado insurance, first mortgage loans or making of abstracts. W. Ed Jameson, the active head and successful proprietor of this business, was born in Fulton in 1865.\n\nReal estate interest of Fulton developed due to the alertness and ability of its businessmen, such as Jameson, who did everything in their power to promote the industrial and commercial possibilities of the city and advertise its resources to those living in other areas. Real estate values increased steadily, and Fulton still offered the greatest field for investment for anyone wanting to establish a home or invest capital.\n\nA commercial club was organized in 1905 with 175 members from nearly every business and profession. The Commercial Club was instrumental in helping Fulton to acquire business and industry such as the overall factory in 1909 and the depot for the Chicago and Alton Railway. Through the efforts of this club, the seven main roads were permanently paved and rocked for four miles leading into town. In 1924, the Commercial Club became known as the Chamber of Commerce. However, before that change it had worked with the Fulton Woman’s Club in forming a Library Association in 1908.\n\nOne problem created by growth appears to have required immediate and stern action by the city council around 1910. There were about 25 automobiles in Fulton, and the city council set a fine of $5 to $100 for exceeding the speed limit of eight miles per hour.\n\nThe Fulton Municipal Airport is located approximately two miles west of the city. It was originally constructed in the 1930s as part of a Federal Works Progress Administration project. By 1941, the airport consisted of 320 acres with turf runways. Activity has fluctuated substantially during the 40 years the airport has operated. During the 1940s, the Robertson Aircraft Corporation equipped the airport with several different managers. From 1951 through 1979, the airport gained stability with the same manager who not only ran the airport but was responsible for the construction of many of the present buildings.\n\nIn 1947, two hangars, a wind cone and a tetrahedron were added. In 1949, a hangar was built. In 1961, three hangars were constructed with funds received for Federal Aid to Airport Programs. From 1963 through 1965, installation of low intensity runway lights, a rotating beacon and lighted wind cone were completed. In 1966, the terminal building was constructed. In 1968, the apron, auto parking and access road improvements were made. From 1978 through 1979, perimeter fencing, ASI-2 and the REIL beacon were installed. In 1981, a conventional hangar was constructed. In 1982, seal coat was applied to runway 5-23.\n\nC. “Pat” Murphy was mayor of Fulton from April 1965 to April 1978. Near the end of his last term, Murphy asked the city engineer, the late Bernard Browning, to compile a report on Fulton’s growth during that 13-year period. It showed expenditures on new structures and on major expansions and improvements of nearly $150 million in the public and private sector. The list, used with Murphy’s permission, included 10 projects at Westminster College; 16 at William Woods College; two at the Missouri School for the Deaf; four at the State Hospital; and 160 involving private businesses. It also produced over 560 new houses, duplexes and apartment units and over 120 housing units plus a community center established by the Fulton Housing Authority. Also listed were 14 projects by the city of Fulton that address the sewage disposal system; water, gas, and electrical systems; the police station; city hall; the Fulton Airport; and several bridges, parks and parking lots. During this period, new pavement was added to eight streets, and a dozen or more new paved streets were completed.\n\nEventually, a four-lane bypass was opened and redirected traffic from the center of town. However, city officials responded by upgrading all utilities and making a dramatic effort to recruit new business. Dollar General, for example, came to the community and became a major employer.\n\nEconomy\n\nEconomy and agriculture became intertwined early in Fulton’s history.\n\nStarting in 1876, farm auctions were held on the square around the courthouse. It is reported that there were as many as six auctioneers simultaneously crying stock sales. One day in 1910, total sales receipts for an auction day totaled more than $1.5 million. Fulton’s livestock sales made a great and strong market for mules, cattle, sheep, hogs, horses and other farm products.\n\nUntil WWII, Fulton was known worldwide for its part in the widespread use of the good ol’ Missouri mule. In addition, Fulton is in an area that claimed to be the world’s greatest mule feeding ground, shipping out and selling 2,000 to 3,000 mules every year. The largest sale days were usually in April and October.\n\nFulton’s economy was not only a result of agriculture but also a variety of businesses and professions. For example, the Buffum Telephone Company managed by Mr. S. V. Lynes was founded in 1902 to compete with a company started earlier by M. F. Bell. Buffum Telephone was known as one of the most successful businesses of that time. In 1912, it boasted 575 subscribers, nine operators, three linesmen, one bookkeeper and one collector.\n\nThe nature of business conducted overall in Fulton in the early 1900s probably did not differ greatly from that of 30 years earlier, but there were a few notable exceptions that reflected a larger trend toward technological innovation. According to a souvenir booklet from 1912, in Fulton, there was an Electric Supply Co.; Lukens & Hook conducted “general repairing, storage and (an) auto garage, doing all kinds of repair on automobiles, steam or electrical machinery or engines”; a couple of businesses specialized in plumbing; and at least two businesses performed furnace installations.\n\nAdditionally, the souvenir booklet listed several businesses that would be unrecognizable today. A. D. Williams & Son operated a livery stable renting rigs; Dennis Crowson had a similar operation with stalls for 100 horses that “(could) furnish swell rigs of all kinds”; R. H. Fowler operated a carriage shop where repairs, painting and trimming was done; Rohn & Stahlman operated a horseshoe shop that gave employment to four “practical horse-shoers”; Shultz & Erdman turned out the “best high grade harness, vehicles, whips, robes and turf goods”; and there were several businesses engaged in buying poultry, butter, cream, eggs, furs and similar raw farm products.\n\nIn 1909, the Fulton Overall Manufacturing Company located on East Fifth Street was established. It manufactured a complete line of cotton overalls with modern machinery and 65 employees. The factory was managed by C. B. Copeland for the Star Clothing Manufacturing Company of Jefferson City, Missouri.\n\nIn the mid-1900s, two brick plants were large employers along with Danuser Machine, Backer’s Potato Chips and a host of smaller manufacturing and service businesses. Downtown Fulton changed dramatically with the advent of Wal-Mart, and many small mom-and-pop shops went out of business.\n\nThe pace of life changed in the mid-to-late-1970s when Union Electric announced it would build the Callaway Nuclear Plant. The economy of Fulton grew with the entrance of numerous new families arriving to build and run the plant.\n\nSociety\n\nBy the 20th century, Fulton was flourishing and stretching out of its boundaries. The opening of Pratt’s Theatre in 1904 marked the beginning of a refined social life. Pratt’s Theatre featured local talent and touring groups and became a part of a cultural center for the community.\n\nThe Woman’s Club held a meeting at the home of J. K. Smith on Feb. 25, 1907, to appoint a committee to form a public library. A permanent Library Association was formed, and membership in it required payment of $5.00 a year while an associate membership was $1.00 a year, or donation of a book of some value. Miss Frances Watson was hired as the first librarian for fifty cents for every three hour period that the library was open.\n\nLand for the library building at 709 Market Street was purchased from D. C. McCue for $2,750. General M. F. Bell was the architect and the building was completed in July, 1912, at a cost of $12,972. Before the library was housed in its own building it started with a fifty book collection in two rented rooms in the Odd Fellows Building located at Court and Sixth Streets. The Fulton Public Library in 1983 has over 37,000 books and five full and five part time employees.\n\nHolidays, as always, were still very social occasions during which the citizens got together for barbecues, school pie suppers, fish fries and other festivities.\n\nEducation\n\nA few years after the Missouri General Assembly voted to create an asylum in Fulton, it also agreed to establish a school for people with hearing impairments in the city.\n\nIn 1850, Fulton Female Seminary was established by W.W. Robertson. Fulton College for men was started in 1851 by Robertson and members of the Presbyterian Church. In 1853, after approval by the Synod of the Presbyterian Church, Westminster College was chartered and began classes in May of that year.\n\nThe Christian Church moved their orphan school to Fulton in 1890. Whether they were influenced by the already existing colleges is not known, but Fulton’s bid of $40,000 and the offer of 10 acres of land was surely a factor. This school, which was previously located in Camden Point, Missouri, later became William Woods College.\n\nWilliam Woods College opened in Fulton in the fall of 1890 and has grown into William Woods University. William Woods College was all-female and Westminster College was all-male for their first 150 years until Westminster accepted their first female students in 1979. William Woods followed suit by going co-ed in 1993. Westminster dramatically changed the community in 1946 when Sir Winston Churchill came to campus to deliver his prophetic Iron Curtain Speech and again in 1969 when St. Mary Aldermanbury opened. The church, constructed by Sir Christopher Wren following the great fire of London, was brought to Fulton from London and reconstructed to serve as the college chapel, which later became the National Churchill Museum.\n\nThe development of these institutions positioned Fulton as a city where the primary industries were higher education and custodial care. The addition of three large buildings for care of the elderly and criminally insane have reinforced that image.\n\nThe public school system was born in two rooms at the Baptist Church located at Fifth and Ravine streets in 1868 and lasted two months. By the end of the year, there were 83 students. Before that time, schools were either private or conscription schools.\n\nDavid Dunlap was a teacher who taught school in a log cabin on the east side of the street north of the Palace Hotel. David Dunlap is generally credited as being the first school teacher in Fulton.\n\nIn 1880, the first school for black elementary students was organized and held in the A. M. E. church and the Baptist church. A building was built for these students in 1882. All schools, white and black, were very primitive regarding facilities. It was said the building and grounds were enclosed with fences.\n\nRecords from Aug. 14, 1883, indicate that Fulton Public Schools had 923 students, and the school board met and made estimates for school expenses as follows:\n\nTeacher’s wages: $3,600.00\n\nLess state aid: $615.00\n\nFuel: $135.00\n\nSinking fund: $1,000.00\n\nInterest on bonds: $320.00\n\nIncidentals: $460.00\n\nLess cash on hand: $400.00\n\nAmount to be levied: $4,500.00\n\nThe first high school class had its graduation in the spring of 1890, and at that time, high school was only a one-year school. In 1899, the school board decided that all high school students should be granted diplomas, provided grades in all subjects were satisfactory except Latin.\n\nBy utilizing the 180-acre farm owned by James Walth, the school district expanded in 1900. At that time, student enrollment showed 793. There was a phone in each building, costing $1 a month for each one. It was agreed that school holidays be given on Mondays instead of Saturdays because Stock Sales Day was always observed on Mondays, and other community activities revolved around that day.\n\nMrs. Brent Williams was assigned the position of music instructor at a salary of $25 per month and later became the music and elocution teacher at a salary of $40 per month. In 1908, the first four-year high school course was organized.\n\nIn the early years of the school system, stress was put on the three R’s. The readers of that period were the McGuffey readers, and arithmetic used the Ray series and later the Milne arithmetics.\n\nThe board agreed to hold a nine-month school term in 1909, and the school district expanded once again. The tax levy at that time went from $1 down to $.90 per $100 valuation.\n\nFulton High School was admitted to the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1911. The superintendent had an annual salary of $1,300 in 1912. During the annual street fair, school was in session only half the day on each of the three days of the fair.\n\nDuring the school term of 1916-17, a new high school was completed. A community nurse working under the direction of the supervisor of health began working with the public schools. During physical examinations given to all students below the fifth grade, about half of the 500 or more were found “to be burdened with bodily ailments of more or less seriousness.”\n\nTeachers in 1924 wishing to be considered for work in Fulton grade schools needed at least 60 semester hours of college credit, or they would have one year in which to qualify. A physical education department was established and used Priest Field at Westminster College for further training. In 1926-27, the school board agreed that the weekly holiday return to Saturday instead of Monday.\n\nThe board abandoned the four-year high school program in 1932 at the North School, which was for black students, deciding instead to transport them to Lincoln University in Jefferson City for several years. Harvey Gilpin was the first school bus driver.\n\nOn June 9, 1936, 10 acres on East 10th Street facing Grand Avenue were purchased as a site for the new high school at a price of $6,000. Part of the $146,000 newly approved bond money was used to erect a building to be the new North School. After the building was completed, it was named George Washington Carver to honor the famous scientist of the Tuskegee Institute of Alabama. The school opened at the beginning of the 1938-39 school year.\n\nVocational agriculture and vocational home economics received federal and state aid. The instruction of these subjects began with Kemmie Craghead teaching agriculture and Suzanne McDonald teaching home economics.\n\nThe Fulton Chamber of Commerce donated $259 for band instruments, and G. W. Lawrence of William Woods College was hired for the remainder of the term to instruct students in high school band in March 1938. When the old East School building was vacated after the move to the new high school, the county court used the building as temporary quarters during construction of the new courthouse in 1938, which had a rental price $100 per month.\n\nIn September 1940, the Fulton Board of Education purchased 100 acres of land south of town for $6,000. The board sponsored the National Youth Administration program with courses offered in sheet metal work, auto mechanics, machine tool operation, trades and welding. The projects were taught until September 1943 when the buildings and grounds were turned over to the Fulton board. During 1945, one of the buildings was rented to Missouri Hybrid Corn Co. for occupancy by war prisoners who were used in the surrounding area to detassel corn that was grown to produce hybrid seed.\n\nIn 1951, Fulton Public Schools was given an AAA school classification by the State Department of Education. In 1954, 50 black students entered Fulton High School and participated in all curricular and extracurricular activities.\n\nThe board adopted name changes on Dec. 13, 1960, for the new elementary schools. They were now named J. Tandy Bush, J. W. Mclntire and Don P. Bartley.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1966, many rural districts annexed to Fulton School District.\n\nBonds were sold March 10, 1966, for $600,000 after having been voted in 1,052 For and 188 Against. Construction was started on a phase of a future high school complex to be located on 76 acres north of town.\n\nThe first phase of the new school was completed in the 1967-68 school year, and the second phase was completed in 1980. Parents, teachers and school-board members had worked hard through the years to provide the best schools possible for Fulton’s young people.\n\nKey Events\n\nAn event that brought continuous change to Fulton in the last century was Winston Churchill giving the John Findley Green Foundation lecture at Westminster College in 1946. Suddenly, Fulton was front-page news all over the world. That in and of itself would have created only temporary change. However, Churchill’s lecture — known as the famous Iron Curtain speech — has, like a voice crying unto the hills, created echoes that still reverberate in Fulton.\n\nToday\n\nThe city of Fulton has a mayor-council form of government. The City Council consists of eight members, two of whom are from each ward of the city. Elections for council members are held on the first Tuesday in April for terms of two years.\n\nAs of November 2019, Lowe Cannell is mayor. The current council members are Valerie Sebacher, Ballard Simmons, Mary Rehklau, Jeff Stone, John Braun, Lindsey Pace-Snook, Rick Shiverdecker and Steve Moore. Although the mayor and council establish policy, approve ordinances and generally oversee the city’s operation, day-to-day operations are conducted by other full-time employees.\n\nCredits\n\nWe are deeply indebted to John Garrett, who at a very late date volunteered to prepare an article on the history of Fulton. He did a great deal of research, talked to many people and prepared a rather voluminous article. The information above is largely based on John's work and article. However, several changes and additions were made by Jalie Sou/ware, who acted as coordinating editor for the section, and by Warren A. Welsh. John deserves the credit, but this word of explanation seemed in order. Additional thanks are in order for Evelyn Hopkins, Yvette Thayer, Tom Wilcox, members of various city government offices and the Fulton Public Library."
