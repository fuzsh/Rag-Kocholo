        "text": "August 24, 2024\n\nBack in the fifties, one Christmas (1957), I had a mammoth case of the flu. But somehow for a little kid the world is always a place of wonder, no matter HOW bad he feels...\n\nI remember reading the story of the Flying Dutchman in bed on Christmas Eve - with an incipient fever blackening the edges of my reverie, like the ominous apparition of a major typhoon darkening the edges of the sea.\n\nSo that, reading this book of the Dutchman’s restless quest became my last clear memory of that Christmas, otherwise shrouded in delirium.\n\nThe story stayed with me all through my life as the story of an unlucky guy who has to sail the Seven Seas of life to find the girl of his dreams...\n\nBecause that, as it turned out, became the story of my OWN life, painfully shy kid that I was!\n\nBut a few days later I was starting to feel better again.\n\nMy Mom, ever the librarian - with a kind, edifying heart - gave me a book about kids in France supporting the Resistance during the War.\n\nWell, there was just no way I would read an ADULT book!\n\nAs I pulled the covers over me to settle down and read, I was holding my tattered copy of The House at Pooh Corner.\n\nWell, I guess the children's aspirin I had been given had psychotropic effects, because as I read once again of Christopher Robin and Pooh's walk into the forest I fell asleep.\n\nIn my dream the immortal pair were walking through an ENCHANTED forest - full of fairies, princesses and trolls!\n\nI LOVED this book. And it was not till much later that I learned the REAL Winnie-the-Pooh was Canadian, like me.\n\nI kid you not.\n\nThe real Winnie, whose name was Winnipeg (like the city), was purchased in North Bay, Ontario, by a kindly veterinarian who had signed up with the Canadian Army in WWI as a horse doctor.\n\nWinnipeg became the official mascot of the Second Canadian Infantry Brigade. When the vet was demobilised, he dropped Winnipeg off at the London Zoo before sailing back to Canada.\n\nOne day soon after, a young father named A.A. Milne took his son Christopher to the zoo, and showed him Winnipeg the Bear.\n\nHe read and spelled the bear's name to the young kid. But Christopher just squealed out, \"Winnie the Pooh\"!\n\nAnd \"therein\", as Rabelais had it, \"hangs a Tale\"....\n\nDecember 18, 2017\n\n“Piglet sidled up to Pooh from behind.\n\n\"Pooh!\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yes, Piglet?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Piglet, taking Pooh's paw. \"I just wanted to be sure of you.”\n\nI will forever be in love with these books. The sweetness and melancholy get me every single time. I don't know where Milne takes all the beautiful words, the laughing-out-loud humor and the ideas from. I am in awe.\n\nFind more of my books on Instagram\n\nDecember 30, 2020\n\nI set out to write a review of Winnie the Pooh and I will say that it’s so 2020 that good reads just deleted it. I will make this short and sweet. I loved the Magical World of Disney as a kid. Before Sunday night football, this was the best television Sunday night had to offer. Before streaming services and YouTube and dvds, there was video rentals and recording television shows on vcr. I recorded all of my favorite magical world of Disney movies and watched them over and over again. One of my favorites: the many adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Mary Poppins is my all time favorite Disney movie but I love Pooh bear and his friends. I watched the Disney version of the movies so many times I had them memorized, songs and scenes. To brighten up my 2020, I have gone back and read the classic books that are nearly one hundred years old to match the number of acres in the now iconic wood.\n\nChristopher Robin was A.A. Milne’s son. They visited the London zoo many times and saw a bear named Winnie. The story goes that Winnie befriended some Canadian soldiers training for World War I and followed them on the boat to England. She needed a new home and ended up in the London zoo so many children and their parents could visit her. Hence, Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh might have been stuffed with fluff but he knew what he wanted. He was Christopher Robin’s best friend before he started school, and the two enjoyed long chats at both the house at Pooh Corners and all throughout the hundred acre wood. This is friendship at its most innocent before the mind is filled with what Pooh’s friends call knowledge. Before there were factors and history, Christopher Robin had Pooh; for him this childhood imagination was enough.\n\nPooh and best friend Piglet go on adventures, often accompanied by Rabbit, Owl, Eeyore, Kanga, and little Roo. In this second book, they are introduced to Tigger. We all know the song: the wonderful thing about Tiggers is that Tiggers are wonderful things. The song might not be in this book, but Tigger’s nonstop joie de vivre is. He meets Pooh and Piglet when they are stuck in a huffalump trap. He bounces himself and Roo up a tree only to be afraid to get down. His excessive energy drives Rabbit crazy; Rabbit can’t stand the bouncing and fun as he is more serious. Rabbit’s modus operandi here and in the televised version is to rid the hundred acre wood of Tigger. In an act of peer pressure, he invites Pooh and Piglet to go in with him in his plan, only to have it backfire. It is the one instance where I, who has always clearly been in Tigger’s camp, actually felt sorry for Rabbit. Milne used this as an instance of showing empathy for others, most likely so that his son would understand other kids before he started school. I appreciated this; however, I still love Tigger and all his bouncing.\n\nPooh is still the star of the show. He needs his little something of honey at eleven each morning. He thinks up songs and rhymes to accompany each of his adventures, often honoring his friends. In this book, Pooh introduces Pooh sticks to the world, and everyone loves the game, even Roo. Eeyore actually wins more time than everyone else, an instance that is sure to bring a smile to one’s face. Pooh and Piglet build Eeyore a new house- that looks exactly like his old one. In another chapter that the movie depicted perfectly, Pooh and Piglet join Owl for tea on an extremely blustery day. While they are there, Owl displays his knowledge and Pooh and Piglet start to fall asleep, and then Owl’s house blows over. Piglet gets Christopher Robin to help, being that he is a small animal, and a search party goes to look for a new house for Owl. Eeyore finds the perfect one, that happens to be Piglet’s house. Piglet graciously gives up his house, only to have Pooh offer to have Piglet come live with him. Christopher Robin is so touched that he throws a party honoring Pooh and Piglet. The party is only in the movie, but I can see it in my mind as I read the end of this touching scene, that is true friendship at its finest.\n\nWhile in 2020, we did not get to connect with our friends all that much, we did connect with our literary friends to ease the pain of being along. By reading through A.A. Milne’s classic volumes, I have been brought back to a flood of childhood memories: all the times I watched the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and the subsequent Blustery Day movie. I returned to the one hundred acre wood and the world of Pooh bear and his friends. I felt sorry for Eeyore’s gloom and became giddy when Tigger entered the equation. I wonder if this is how a pre school aged Christopher Robin felt about his father’s writing as well. I have the last two books about Pooh bear to read in 2021. It will be time spent with good friends.\n\n🐻 5 stars🍯 🐷 🦉 🐰 🦘 🐯\n\nJune 18, 2008\n\nLovely.\n\nI was shocked by how melancholy the book allowed itself to become at the end. And how much that melancholy affected me, but as far as I'm concerned \"A little boy and his bear will always be playing.\" Might be the most hopeful line to end a book in the English language.\n\nSeptember 25, 2017\n\nSo beautifully and so simply written (deceptively so) by A.A. Milne and exquisitely illustrated by E.H. Shepard (initially black/white line drawings and later colour washed by Shepard himself).\n\nThese are the stories of a boy and his bear, his world and all the wonderful characters that inhabit that world – 100 Acre Wood, his childhood and ultimately the passing of that childhood.\n\nWhat could have been (especially considering the era in which they were written) a particularly twee, sickly sweet and very dated collection of stories of childhood, is as about as far from that as it could possibly be. Both collections have certainly stood the test of time extremely well.\n\nAt the heart of A.A. Milne’s wonderful collections: ‘Winnie-the-Pooh’ and ‘The House at Pooh Corner’ – is of course Pooh, who is such a wonderfully created character – a ‘bear of very little brain’, but a bear who is undeniably wise, funny, loyal, paradoxically clever, who does many brave and wonderful things; a bear who makes mistakes and gets things wrong, but is always forgiven; a bear who is both selfish and greedy (see Honey) and yet kind and thoughtful; a bear who above all else (and clichéd though it may be) lovable.\n\nLet us not forget though the lovely cast of supporting characters, including the timid and excitable Piglet, wise (although not) Owl, morose and self-pitying Eeyore, Kango, Roo, Rabbit (and friends and relations) and many others. In these characters, we see ourselves, we all know and Eeyore, the same as we all know a Rabbit – we are all in there somewhere, in some shape or form.\n\nA.A. Milnes Winnie-the-Pooh stories are just so simply and so well written, both collections are timeless classics – from the opening lines to the closing ones from the profoundly moving last chapter:\n\n“…So, they went off together. But wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the Forest, a little boy and his Bear will always be playing”\n\nThere is so much more I could write about these books, but it doesn’t feel that I am really conveying quite how wonderful these stories are, I am not doing them justice – what A.A. Milne along with E.H. Shepard have given us is something very special. Both of these collections are classics in every sense of the word.\n\nNot to mention the funny, moving and sometime life affirming quotes from ‘Winnie-the-Pooh’\n\n“Sometimes the smallest things take up the most room in your heart.”\n\n“Rivers know this: there is no hurry. We shall get there some day.”\n\n“If the person you are talking to doesn't appear to be listening, be patient. It may simply be that he has a small piece of fluff in his ear.”\n\nIn summation – just read them.\n\nJuly 5, 2018\n\nAs a small child, Winnie the Pooh stories were read to me. As an adult, I read them to my kids and took them to see where Christopher Robin and his childhood friends had lived—the Milnes’ country home at Cotchford Farm, Hartfield in East Sussex, England. We walked in the “Hundred Acre Wood” where he had walked. In real life it is part of Ashdown Forest. We saw the bridge and tumbling creek where sticks had been thrown in on one side and eagerly awaited on the other. I wanted to share with my children the magical place that had incited A.A. Milne to write the Pooh stories. When we made this trip, years ago, there was not a tourist sign to be found! For more detailed information see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred...\n\nMy journey with Christopher Robin and Pooh and his pals continued. I picked up The Enchanted Places, The Path through the Trees and Hollow On The Hill written by Milne’s son, Christopher Milne, the very same Christopher Robin of the stories. They are very good. My journey continued; earlier this year I listened to Winnie-the-Pooh as an audiobook read by Peter Dennis. This is the only audiobook version authorized by A.A. Milne's son. I fell in love with Pooh, Christopher Robin and his gang all over again. Do not choose a different narrator! That audiobook led to The House at Pooh Corner and When We Were Very Young, also read by Peter Dennis.\n\nMilne’s first two books, Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner belong together. In the first, we are introduced to a magical place and the friends living there. In the second, a few more adventures are added and then goodbyes are said. Why? Because, quite simply, life goes on. Christopher Robin will soon be off to school. Nothing lasts forever, yet who we are now is a product of what has gone before. So, the two books are different—the first is about saying hello, and the second is about saying goodbye. Goodbye to a place. Goodbye to friends. Goodbye to the early years of childhood.\n\nThe books are different in another way too. By the end of the second book, we have come to know each figure so well that who they are comes to the fore. Each can, in a subtle way, be seen as people of different personality types. I love that although all have become dear to me, each I love in a different way. All are special, but each in their own different way. Tiger is bouncy, sweet-tempered. Piglet is instinctively smart and clever but always unobtrusively. Eeyore is gloomy and sad, the very opposite of Mr. Cheerful. Owl is learned but has clear limitations in his abilities—he can spell Tuesday so you know at least it isn’t Wednesday. Rabbit is the self-important, officious organizer. And Pooh is just sweet, lovable, humble, meditative Pooh--who has very-little-brains and does like this honey. These friends epitomize people YOU know.\n\nThe first book is fantastic, the second follows at a close run. It does not however reach up to the excellence of the first. The third, When We Were Very Young, you can just skip! The first is as good for a young child as for an adult. A parent and child reading it together will both have a wonderful time. The second will be more difficult for a child to fully understand. Here, the humor and wisdom of the lines are directed more to the adult; a deeper meaning is evoked about life-stages and personality types that go beyond the comprehension of a young child.\n\nA.A. Milne seldom speaks plainly. He hints. He infers. He uses innuendos. Words are left unsaid. One example is in how we are told “Pooh”, in the name “Winnie-the-Pooh” came to be. A.A. Milne and Christopher Robin often walked down to a pond. On that pond there swam a swan. That swan they called Pooh. Somehow, there are no details, the name of the swan got shifted to Christopher Robin’s teddy bear. That the teddy bear was from Harrods and was originally named Edward is not said, nor that “Edward” got changed to “Winnie” after Christopher Robin had visited London Zoo and seen a real, live black bear from Canada called Winnipeg. There is an interesting story about this bear at Wiki:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipe...\n\nIn my view, if you wish as an adult to reread Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner, the audiobook read by Peter Dennis is the format to choose. The production is exemplary. Each character has his own voice. That voice is in perfect synchrony with the character’s personality. This further enhances one’s appreciation of the second book. A delightful, melodic, piano trill is repeated between the chapters. The music and the lines are sure to bring tears to your eyes. One minute you will laugh. The next you will cry.\n\nMilne’s stories are to be shared; they are not to be put into the hands of a child and told to go and read. They will not be properly understood. Their magic lies in the shared, side-by-side reading experience of an adult and a child together. Rereading, as an adult, they evoke childhood memories, and one marvels at the word play, the humor and life wisdom woven into the lines.\n\nThe House at Pooh Corner is about dear friends, friends who are different and each loved for who they are. It is about how it feels when such a friend leaves. It is a book about growing up.\n\nBooks by A.A.

Oh, you are totally cracking me up, I love this story! Ha! Ha! I'm sorry about your friend though, I hope he recovered. It's funny, I just feel so relaxed with you. It's like I've known you for ages. Since I was a little girl in fact. Oh, I see everyone's starting to leave. Look, I know this sounds crazy, like we've only just met and I'll probably regret it in the morning, but come home with me. Um, well, yes and no. I just... I just want to hold you. All night. You do? You really do understand? Ed, I can't believe this. It feels like fate. I'm so happy I met you. OK, let me get my coat. We're outta here.\"\n\n___________________________________________\n\nIf you want to examine the magazine cover which inspired the review, note that, as the review suggests, it's in dubious taste, and features a mostly naked woman. If that kind of thing offends you, don't look at it! Otherwise, it's at http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/ar...\n\nJuly 9, 2023\n\nYears ago when I babysat for my niece ( 6 years old and my nephew who was 4 years old,) I took them to the library and let them choose DVD'S and books to read. My nephew loved Winnie the Pooh and always chose Winnie the Pooh DVD'S to watch. That was fine by me because I loved him too!! Only, he would want to watch them over and over! So, yes, I know all the words to the Winnie the Pooh song, along with the song House At Pooh Corner by Kenny Logins!! 🤣🎵🎶 That's fine because they are definitely sweet songs.\n\nI listened to the audiobook and read this book at the same time. It's too adorable for words!! We all have our favorite Winnie the Pooh characters, mine are Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore. Now I know who's house is at Pooh Corner!\n\nI've been reading some heavy books lately and needed a bit of a break to relax my brain.. this provided the break I really needed. It's a wonderful, cute and adorable book that transports you back to the Hundred Acre Wood. Wish I could stay there.\n\nFinally it comes time for Christopher Robin and Pooh to say good-bye. \" But of course it isn't really Good - bye because the Forest will always be there... and anybody who is Friendly with bears can find it.\" 🍯🍯💞\n\nVery highly recommend to everyone!\n\nEnjoy and Happy Reading\n\nJuly 30, 2022\n\n4.5 stars rounded down\n\nA 'trip' to my childhood that was definitely worth it, again.\n\nAfter reading the first volume of Pooh Bear and his adventures, I decided to pick up The House at Pooh Corner in order to keep enjoying these apparently simple but beautifully written stories, where our lovable characters are back to face new obstacles and live new experiences together.\n\nNow I just remember when I finished the first book, I was wondering where one of my favorite characters would be. Exactly, I'm talking about Tigger, who is not present in these stories until this second book. For one moment I thought he would be a Disney character only; fortunately it turned out that Tigger was introduced here, in one of the best tales I read in this second volume.\n\nThe author is keeping the same style of writing—that one that is very easy to read (it's meant to be for children, so it makes sense), yet it is really profound and descriptive—and the same tone in every story: funny, relaxing and lighthearted. Something I didn't mention in my previous review is that every character has an own personality very well depicted and developed. For instance, one character seems to be anxious or nervous a lot of time, another one usually seems to be depressed, and a third one is constantly so naïve, just to mention some examples.\n\nAgain, this is probably one of those readings that, if you read it when you are an adult, you have to stop thinking of the content a lot, and just enjoy the reading experience, and perhaps—why not?—embrace your childhood memories. Actually, I do believe it's one of the most beautiful experiences anyone can have.\n\nI must confess this book as a whole won't be a 5-star reading for me as the first one was, because at some point—on chapter 6 or so—I felt a little tired of following the same pattern once and again and again. This is by no means a mistake, and I do believe it was my fault since I tried to read this second volume as fast as I read the first one, but unfortunately the enthusiasm and excitement were not the same as the first time. Perhaps the 'magic' while I read it was a little bit different. The first time was literally like embracing my happy memories way back when I was a little kid, whereas the second time was me trying to live the experience as an adult, although I never left that kid completely in the past, so to speak.\n\nHaving said that, this book, along with the first one, are a unique experience that every reader must live at least once in their life. Please go, pick them up, and live them; and, for instance, if you are getting through something difficult, also known as adult stuff, do yourself a favor and pick them up, I promise you they will be like a balm to the heart.\n\nI almost forget to say the last chapter (or last tale) of this volume is definitely my favorite one among all of them (considering both books). In my view, it has one of the most inspiring, emotional endings I have read in a children's book. I completely enjoyed it and, obviously, it made me shed tears (as usual, I guess I'm just that predictable sometimes).\n\nBut, of course, it isn't really Good-bye, because the Forest will always be there … and anybody who is Friendly with Bears can find it.\n\nDecember 4, 2013\n\nCelebrity Death Match Review\n\nSemi-Final Match: Winnie-the Pooh vs. Hamlet\n\nBSI Rep: So, the Hundred Acre Wood Corporation has applied for ISO 9000 certification. Would you like to present your company, in terms of its aims and target market?\n\n100 Acre Wood CEO: Yes, indeed. Thank you for this opportunity. For nearly a century now we have provided children and their parents with one of the most essential tools towards abstract thinking, emotional hygiene, social empathy and creativity. Let me bring those wide angle goals into a narrower focus.\n\nFirst, abstract thinking. A central idea in education is to enable us to abstract ourselves from the immediate and literal, to form mental models of the world in which we are able to run 'what-if' scenarios. Our thoughts can be guided by something other than what we experience immediately, for instance by words. The imagination is needed to be able to conceive alternatives, and hence to evaluate. Children need pretend play, in which a banana held to the ear is also a telephone, they need and enjoy this ability to understand that something can be both one thing and something else. This is the basic entry into abstraction, into skills of imagining futures and outcomes, skills of planning. Fiction allows them to enter in imagination many more situations than a lifetime could contain, and in doing so allows them to make mental enactments. This is an essential factor in our development.\n\nSecond, emotional hygiene. Bears are of course part of the real world and can be seen in some Northern American towns at dusk, picking through the dustbins; however a toy bear will afford an experience of what is called by psychologists attachment, the experience of cuddling and feeling close to a loved one. It is a transitional object that stands in for the for the attachment relationship to a mother or other caregiver. Transitional in the sense that it is transitional between the world of nature - the real attachment to the caregiver - and the world of culture, which includes objects, games, relationships, fiction. A teddy bear models not a real bear with teeth and claws but the relationship of attachment, something intimate and abstract.\n\nFiction is both real and not-real in the same way. It is a game that the child can enter, a miniature version of interactions and emotions. These emotions can be enjoyed safely, and a model of how to manage and resolve such emotions can be constructed. Fear of monsters such as Heffalumps, fear of loss of friendship, fear of being parted from loved ones, all these can become manageable, even enjoyable, in this fictional 'game' context where fear can be explored and resolved.\n\nSocial empathy: As social animals, an ability to read others' motivations and intentions is crucial to our ability to function in the world. In developmental psychology this is discussed as theory-of-mind or perspective-taking, and mentalizing. Before the age of around four, most children are unable to think that what another person knows is any different from what they know. Tell children this story: Maxi had some chocolate. He put the chocolate into a blue cupboard and then went out to play. While he was out, his mother used some of it to make a cake. Then she put the rest in a different place, in a green cupboard. Then ask the children \"When Maxi comes back from the playground he would like some of his chocolate. Where will he look for it?\" Children under about four will usually answer \"In the green cupboard\". They know that is where the chocolate is, and they assume that Maxi will look there. But children of four and over are able to hold in their mind Maxi's perspective, and see that he will look in the blue cupboard, where he left it.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between narrative skills and theory-of-mind ability. Stories are ideal tools to develop the ability to represent perspective, to accommodate differing perspectives. With increasing maturity we develop the skill not only of making mental models of what we and others know, both now and over longer periods, but also the ability to make models of other people's models, an embedded structure of what people think, feel and believe. Take for example the story of the deception that was carried out on Kanga where Piglet is substituted for Roo. This involves first strategic planning that consists mainly of mentalizing Kanga's reaction to Roo's disappearance, and then in a truly magnificent double bluff, in which Kanga pretends not to notice the difference between the two small animals. The child understands that Kanga knows more than Piglet thinks she knows. There are differing layers of mental models that can and must be accommodated and realised.\n\nLastly creativity. By this I mean more than just the common idea of the ability to come up with a new idea or artefact. I mean more a form of agency in the world, the opposite of compliance to external imposition, rather the sense of being engaged entirely with what we are doing, where the self and the activity become one, where we feel fully alive and absorbed in what we are doing. This has also been called 'flow' - creative living, total involvement in what you are doing. This is what happens when we engage with a work of fiction. In order to do so we need to engage emotionally with the characters, and this is where the Hundred Acre Wood Corporation really shines. Our employees all have distinct issues; for example Pooh is not particularly quick-witted, Piglet struggles with a lack of pluck, Tigger needs more aplomb, Wol could do with a little humility and of course poor Eeyore, well..., anyway all the characters are struggling in such a way that a child can swiftly feel sympathy for them. They become friends.\n\nA further requirement for this kind of creative engagement with fiction is that it should not force you to comply with just one view of the world, but should leave gaps and a certain openness, or unexpectedness, space that the imagination has to fill. \"In which a house is built at Pooh Corner for Eeyore\" can give us a taste of what I mean here: the reader soon realises that Pooh and Piglet have not, in fact, built a new house for Eeyore, but only moved his to the other side of the wood (dramatic irony, the reader knows more than the characters involved). Inevitably, knowing Eeyore's gloomy world view, we feel that disaster and recriminations must ensue. But no, an explanation is found that everyone can live with.\n\nBSI inspector: Yes, I can see that you have achieved your targets admirably. But what about your management practices? Can you give me a report on human resource management?\n\n100 AW CEO: Well, I admit that we have had issues in the past with in-groups and out-groups, and that these have not been entirely resolved. Efforts were made to integrate Tigger and Kanga and Roo into the in-group around CR, but it must be admitted that there are still some privileges afforded Pooh and Piglet only. However I must say that we are proud of our record on certain aspects of team-building, such as the expotition to find the North Pole, or the management of Owl's house being blown over.\n\nBSI inspector: Are you an Equal Opportunity Employer?\n\n100 AW CEO: We certainly have a multi-ethnic employee base, with animals from nigh on every continent.\n\nBSI inspector: But what about women?\n\n100 AW CEO: You must see that the original staff have been with us since a time when it was, let us say, unusual to employ women. Naturally we have considered this question closely. But it is beyond our capacity to engage further staff, so that the only alternative would be to perform a sex-change on a proportion of the characters, something that I think would contravene their rights. And after a thorough survey of our clientele, we found that little girls have no qualms about identifying with male characters, whereas the opposite case, of boys identifying with female characters, is almost unheard-of. Thus we feel that this issue is less important than might be imagined.\n\nBSI inspector: Right, well thank you very much. You'll be hearing from us. I still have to visit Hamlet Inc. on this tour.\n\nThe inspector calls on Hamlet and asks him about terms and definitions of his enterprise:\n\nH: Well, yeah, it's a revenge play innit?\n\nBSI inspector: What?\n\nH: Yeah, y'know, revenge? Hamlet's dad was poisoned by Claudius so now Hamlet has to avenge the old man's death. Lots of blood and gore, a ghost, a bit of pretend madness, the audience just lapped it up. They loved all that stuff.\n\nBSI inspector: Yes, but what about your present-day customers?\n\nH: It still has a lot to say to kids on the street today. Get out there. Don't stand for no shit. You gotta earn that respect man. No-one's gonna do it for you. They shoot your best boy, you shoot theirs.\n\nBSI inspector (turning pale around the nose) Aha. But isn't the language a little, um, difficult for the modern audience? Do you think that something like \"Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:\" is going to get through to a modern viewer?\n\nH: Shit, that's their shit isn't it? I can't go explaining every little thing to them, can I? That's the job of the secondary industry around ours, but you have to inspect them separately, that's not got nuffink to do with me.\n\nBSI inspector: What about your employment practices? Do you offer equal opportunities to women, or to ethnic or other minorities?\n\nH: Don't make me laugh. All white men, that's what we want. No wops. As for women, well 'Get thee to a nunnery' was the best line ever. Women are no use to anyone. 'Cept for one thing, but I don't get none of that in this piece, which is a shame.\n\n(The inspector retreats swiftly)\n\nISO 9000 certificate awarded to Winnie-the-Pooh and friends.\n\n(No animals were harmed in the making of this review)\n\nJuly 2, 2023\n\nSecond book complete: 🍯🍯\n\nIt was just lovely returning to the Hundred Acre Wood to see the silly old bear. It’s sweet as honey and full of just the right amount of nostalgic sadness. Setup much like the first book, it’s broken up into little adventures the group goes through. And this book finally introduces the infamous Tigger! Enjoyed this on audio. Peter Dennis does an amazing job!\n\nLESSONS LEARNED:\n\n“They’re funny things, Accidents. You never have them till you’re having them.” (SO VERY TRUE!)\n\nEven pleasant children’s books can make you cry. That ending….ouch!\n\n“So they went off together. But wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the Forest, a little boy and his Bear will always be playing.”\n\n😢 😭\n\nSeptember 24, 2019\n\nThis is the second adorable instalment that details the antics of Winnie the Pooh and his friends. Much like in the first book, this was sectioned into a handful of shorter stories, each a self-contained adventure. Also, like the first book, this retained a humours tone throughout and involved Christopher Robin as eventual hero to the stories, saving his animal friends from the fearsome creatures who roam the woods and returning them home when their venturing goes awry. This book opened up the cast of characters and I especially appreciated the appearance of Tiger, whose energy livens the tone and mood of the whole book.\n\nDecember 9, 2018\n\nI love the purity of this story. It has this child-like wonder about the world. We see through the eyes of Pooh who has little attachments in this world besides honey. He is usually the one to come up with solutions to problems and he doesn't overthink things. He lives by his gut.\n\nEach character has such a strong and distinct voice. It's a classic for a reason. You can just hear A. A. Milne telling Christopher Robin these bedtime stories and the boy being delighted. We are just lucky that A. A. decided to write down the wonderful stories and share them with the world.\n\nIt makes me want to write a children's book. I just love the tone and the voice used here and how things happen, and characters do have minor issues with themselves, but there is overwhelming kindness and compassion in the story and for the community. I read this as an audio book and it was a whole lot of fun to let this story wash over me. It's a quick and easy story to read. There are many many great lines in this book.\n\nI need to read the other 3 books of this one. It is simply so special. I'm glad I own this boxset I got on sale and I hope that my niece is going to decide to read this. I never read them as a kid and what a shame. Still, it's a story that I really enjoyed as an adult. Listening, I really felt like the story was similar to a golden light that filters through the leaves of a forest on a happy day and all the world seems to sparkle. There is so much wonder in this book.\n\nPooh Sticks came out of this book. We like to play Pooh sticks on our walks in this area. It's such a Zen kind of game and fun. What a feat this work is and how lucky the world is to have these stories.\n\nSeptember 18, 2018\n\nEven more delightful than the first, I think. And also quite bittersweet, as Christopher Robin essentially has to grow up, and his Hundred Acre Wood friends struggle to understand what is happening. Reading this aloud, I have to fight not to break down in the final chapter.\n\n2018: My kids had just seen both the original animated movie, the newer Winnie-the-Pooh animated movie, and the new live action Christopher Robin. They loved seeing how the stories in this book had been used, directly, for the animated films, and we thought it was cool what a natural follow up Christopher Robin really was.\n\nApril 24, 2017\n\nThere are some days when I've had enough of the world and need to escape to the Hundred Acre Wood with my friends Winnie the Pooh and Piglet. These are the original stories and illustrations. If you're a fan of Winnie the Pooh but haven't read this yet, I highly recommend it! Children and adults alike will love these grand adventures.\n\nMy Rating: 5+ stars\n\nAugust 31, 2016\n\nIt was with much apprehension that I started this- after all, my initial impression (Winnie the Pooh as it is in Disney) is vastly different from this book. In fact, I don't think I would have even picked up the book, had a friend not recommended it to me. And I'm very glad she did.\n\nI'm surprised by how sad but realistic the end of this book was; with Christopher Robin growing up and everyone realizing he's leaving the Forest, that wonderful place where only one with enough imagination can go. It made me cry and revisit my stuffed animal collection that I have abandoned for so long.\n\nAfter rereading both books, I finally figured out why I love them so much. It's because they mirror our lives, in a more simpler way, with people pretending they know everything but really knowing nothing, with others being disillusioned into thinking that certain people do know it all, with others jealous of others' accomplishments, and of course, the beautiful friendships.\n\nMy favourite part is definitely the one where Rabbit, Pooh, and Piglet trying to make Tigger more humble but ending up with rabbit becoming more humble... that chapter is just the funniest thing I've ever read. Anyways, this collection of stories is just gorgeously told, and ever so funny, yet being a lens of viewing our own world when you strip away the distractions. Definitely five stars.\n\nMarch 22, 2023\n\nSometimes, the innocence of a children's book is all you need to cheer you up and make you forget your real-life world problems. Clearly, another classic by A. A. Milne. This book introduces the beloved Tigger into Pooh's world. It's funny how I didn't pick up on his absence in the first book even after multiple reads. I think that speaks volumes about how well crafted each character is. They take your full attention and leave nothing to be desired.\n\nMay 21, 2019\n\nThese stories just do not get old. Love visiting the Hundred Acre Woods with Peter Dennis.\n\nRead\n\nMarch 28, 2021\n\nThis is the cutest book ever! I also loved the illustrations.\n\nApril 13, 2020\n\nJust as cute and heartwarming as the first book! I loved listening to it!\n\n(This has GOT to be the cutest thing on the Internet!!)\n\nAnd it seems I have nothing coherent to say about it except throw gifs around!\n\nI'll just have to let the gifs speak for themselves.\n\nAfter all, if an image is worth a thousand words, a gif is worth...a million?\n\n(I need to exit now LOL)\n\nDecember 22, 2021\n\nI loved the first book and I love this second book as well. The House at Pooh Corner brings the characters from the first book back and also introduces us to Tigger. I adore all these characters but my favorites from the first book were Piglet, Eeyore and Rabbit and they still remain favorite characters.\n\nA very charming read indeed.\n\n5 stars\n\nNovember 23, 2018\n\nThe second volume of short stories fearing Winnie-the-Pooh, this collection is most noticeable for the introduction of Tigger.\n\nI really enjoy this collection and this books illustrations are just wonderful.\n\nNovember 14, 2011\n\nFor the final of Celebrity Death Match.\n\nSome basic facts about Winnie the Pooh and the Divine Comedy.\n\n(1) Have you ever tried looking up Winnie on project Gutenberg? You find that Dante gets a few thousand hits and Winnie gets none. NONE!!! And you know why? Because Disney bullied Congress years ago into being allowed to keep the copyright longer than was their legal right. And you know why they did that? Of course it is because everybody loves Winnie. Try this, if you don't believe me. Offer the copyright to The Divine Comedy to Disney for ten bucks.\n\n(2) Have you ever tried shopping for Dante sheets? Cursor? Wallpaper - both hard and soft? Mice? Toilet paper? Colouring-in books? Dante stuffed animals? Interactive game sites?\n\n(3) google The Divine Comedy and you get 3M hits. google Winnie the Pooh and you get 58M (numbers rounded down, to Dante's advantage).\n\nDemocracy, ladies and gentlemen. The world has voted. Celebrity death match can scarcely go against figures like these.\n\n(4) When I was in Grade three, about seven years old, we were set as English comprehension:\n\n\"Compare and contrast the following passages\"\n\nThe start of the Divine Comedy:\n\nHis glory, by whose might all things are mov'd,\n\nPierces the universe, and in one part\n\nSheds more resplendence, elsewhere less. In heav'n,\n\nThat largeliest of his light partakes, was I,\n\nWitness of things, which to relate again\n\nSurpasseth power of him who comes from thence;\n\nFor that, so near approaching its desire\n\nOur intellect is to such depth absorb'd,\n\nThat memory cannot follow. Nathless all,\n\nThat in my thoughts I of that sacred realm\n\nCould store, shall now be matter of my song.\n\nand a poem by Pooh:\n\nTHOUGHTS\n\nI lay on my chest\n\nAnd I thought it best\n\nTo pretend I was having a evening rest;\n\nI lay on my tum\n\nAnd I tried to hum\n\nBut nothing particular seemed to come\n\nMy face was flat\n\nOn the floor, and that\n\nIs all very well for an acrobat;\n\nBut it doesn't seem fair\n\nTo a Friendly Bear\n\nTo stiffen him out with a backet-chair.\n\nAnd sort of squoze\n\nWhich grows and grows\n\nIs not too nice for his poor old nose,\n\nAnd sort of squch\n\nIs much to much\n\nFor his neck and his mouth and his\n\nears and such.\n\nI discussed all the obvious points, the sheer boredom of reading Dante, his inability to call a rhyme. Naturally I compared Pooh favourably with Shakespeare, making the point like others before me, I expect, that they were both inventors of words, that they revelled in the joyous playfullness of language.\n\nThe coup of my essay, however, was revealing the sociological experiment carried out by my mother. Whilst I was sweetly put to sleep with Pooh each night, my poor brother was served up Dante. He has never recovered from the trauma of it. To him going to bed at night is to be avoided at all costs. Anything but that. And in a truly despicable example of what happens when one is raised on Dante, my mother once found that my brother had hanged his teddy bear.\n\nI rest my case.\n\nSeptember 17, 2021\n\nThe adventures of Pooh, Piglet, Owl, Tigger, Kanga, Roo and of course Christopher Robin belong to the all-time classics of literature in the English language, whether for children, adults or both together. They are in a word delightful.\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\nMy first time ever with Pooh & friends. Silly, sad, and witty. Some of the smartest quips and soulful reflections I've ever read in children's literature. <3\n\nQuotes:\n\n-------\n\nOwl kept his head and told us that the Opposite of an Introduction… was a Contradiction.\n\nThey haven't got Brains, any of them, only grey fluff that's blown into their heads by mistake, and they don't Think…\n\n\"What do Jagulars do?\" asked Piglet, hoping that they wouldn’t.\n\n… And he was the sort of Tigger who was always in front when you were showing him the way anywhere, and was generally out of sight when at last you came to the place and said proudly \"Here we are!”\n\n… You can't help respecting anybody who can spell TUESDAY, even if he doesn't spell it right; but spelling isn't everything. There are days when spelling Tuesday simply doesn't count.\n\n“Owl,\" said Rabbit shortly, \"you and I have brains. The others have fluff. If there is any thinking to be done in this Forest -- and when I say thinking I mean thinking -- you and I must do it.”\n\nOwl looked at him, and wondered whether to push him off the tree; but, feeling that he could always do it afterwards, he tried once more to find out what they were talking about.\n\n\"Well, I sort of made it up,\" said Pooh. “… it comes to me sometimes.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Rabbit, who never let things come to him, but always went and fetched them.\n\n… The stream had grown up… and, being grown-up, it did not run and jump and sparkle along as it used to do when it was younger, but moved more slowly. For it knew now where it was going, and it said to itself, \"There is no hurry. We shall get there someday.\" But all the little streams higher up in the Forest went this way and that, quickly, eagerly, having so much to find out before it was too late.\n\n… When you are a Bear of Very Little Brain, and you Think of Things, you find sometimes that a Thing which seemed very Thingish inside you is quite different when it gets out into the open and has other people looking at it.\n\nPooh, who felt more and more that he was somewhere else, got up slowly and began to look for himself.\n\nRoo… went into a corner and practiced jumping… partly because he wanted to practice this, and partly because he didn't want Christopher Robin and Tigger to think that he minded when they went off without him.\n\nSaid Piglet, \"Rabbit's clever…”\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Pooh, “…that’s why he never understands anything.\"\n\nOwl explained about the Necessary Dorsal Muscles. He had explained this to Pooh and Christopher Robin once before, and had been waiting ever since for a chance to do it again, because it is a thing which you can easily explain twice before anybody knows what you are talking about.\n\nEverybody said \"How-do-you-do\" to Eeyore, and Eeyore said that he didn’t…\n\n\"Where are we going?” said Pooh, hurrying after him, and wondering whether it was to be an Explore or a What-shall-I-do-about-you-know-what.\n\n\"Nowhere,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\nSo they began going there…\n\n…They came to an enchanted place on the very top of the Forest... which is sixty-something trees in a circle; and Christopher Robin knew that it was enchanted because nobody had ever been able to count whether it was sixty-three or sixty-four…\n\nSitting there they could see the whole world spread out until it reached the sky, and whatever there was all the world over was with them...\n\n\"Pooh, promise you won't forget about me, ever. Not ever…\"\n\n\"I promise,\" he said.\n\nSo they went off together. But wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the Forest a little boy and his Bear will always be playing.\n\n<3 <3 <3\n\nJuly 3, 2024\n\n5+ stars & 8/10 hearts. I love this book even better than the first one. It is a bit older in style—Christopher Robin is now a schoolboy. It is even wittier and cleverer and has several little lessons in it... such as the truth about conversation. I love the last chapter so much... <33\n\nA Favourite Quote: “‘Supposing a tree fell down, Pooh, when we were underneath it?’\n\n“‘Supposing it didn’t,’ said Pooh[.]”\n\nA Favourite Beautiful Quote: “By the time it came to the edge of the Forest, the stream had grown up, so that it was almost a river, and being grown-up, it did not run and jump and sparkle along as it used to do when it was younger, but moved more slowly. For it knew now where it was going, and it said to itself, ‘There is no hurry. We shall get there some day.’”\n\nA Favourite Humorous Quote: “‘You said “Hallo,” and Flashed Past. I saw your tail in the distance as I was meditating my reply. I *had* thought of saying, “What?”—but, of course, it was then too late[.] No give and take[.] No Exchange of Thought: “Hallo”—“What”—I mean, it gets you nowhere, particularly if the other person’s tail is only just in sight for the second half of the conversation.’”\n\nOctober 25, 2017\n\ni have always loved Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\nafter all who couldn't?\n\na bunch of animals each with a different and captivating personality.\n\ntheir outlook of the world, their adventures and beliefs\n\nare all bound to make me laugh, cry and wonder and the same time.\n\nwhen i picked this up from the library, i only thought of getting reacquainted with my childhood heroes.\n\ni never thought it was possible to fall more in love with book.\n\ni am in tears . this book is everything !!!!\n\nNovember 4, 2022\n\nSo, they went off together.

Tigger is introduced in this one. More delightful characterization.\n\nThere's several references to stories from the first book, so I'd advise reading them in order.\n\nIt's hard to separate my impression of the books from my childhood experiences with the Disney animations. But the illustrations are all their own. Surprising how much they resemble Milne's stuffed animals.\n\nThe illustrations and typesetting make the book. I read the 1961 Dutton edition which includes the original art by E. H. Shepard.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"Rabbit's clever,\" said Pooh thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Piglet, \"Rabbit's clever.\"\n\n\"And he has a Brain.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Piglet, \"Rabbit has Brain.\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Pooh, \"that that's why he never understands anything.\""
