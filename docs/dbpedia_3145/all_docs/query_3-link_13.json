The memory of these buildings which once dotted our countryside, becomes increasingly dim with each passing generation.\n\nMany of our retired teachers recall these vividly for it was very likely they once attended one of these as a student and in the case of many, a great portion of their teaching career was spent within the walls of one or more of these structures.\n\nWith the success of the American Revolution Americans embarked upon a new experiment in government: a government of; by, and for the people. This would require a literate voting population and as early as 1785 when the Northwest Land Ordinance was passed provisions were made to provide means of education for those who would become residents of this great mass of land known as the Northwest Territory. For these rural people the one room school was the answer. Modern educators are too often\n\nprone to amplify their shortcomings and pass over their merits too lightly, yet the desired position that our nation holds among the peoples of the world is ample evidence schools taught well. It was from these simple institutions that Lincoln's call for volunteers who were to march to Gettysburg and Appomattox was filled. In the half century that followed it was these schools\n\nthat supplied the men and women who would dam our rivers, build our railroads, write our books, and transform this sprawling rural countryside into the greatest industrial nation the world has ever seen.\n\nIn 1917 when the Kaiser's war machine seemed to spell the very annihilation of Europe these institutions supplied \"the American doughboy\" who was determined to do his bit to \"make the world safe for democracy.\" Again in 1941 when the security of all peace loving people was again in jeopardy, young men and women largely educated in these simple buildings\n\nwere to be found in every corner of the world determined that the freedoms we hold so dear should become the inherent right of all.\n\nToday the rural school is no more. Much as the flint lock rifle, the spinning wheel or the covered wagon, it has served its purpose and has given way to a more advanced and complicated system which is with us today. Only occasionally is one found and then likely used as a storehouse or perhaps gathering dust in a museum, or existing in the memory of an older generation of a way of life now past and gone. It is for this reason that this listing of rural and village schools which once existed in our county has been undertaken.\n\nTheir position began to deteriorate with the advent of the improved road and the internal combustion engine in areas where road building was more simple and less costly than in Monroe County erosion took place much earlier. The decade between 1925 and 1935 marked the closing of most of the rural schools in this county beginning first along our best highways. With the construction of Route 7 schools along and adjacent to it were consolidated, with the same pattern following the building of Routes 8, 78, 556 and 536. Only the more remote remained open and these only until some form of improved road made consolidation possible. In Switzer Township the school once known as Mount Vernon remains being used as a polling place and meeting hall for the township trustees. The Switzer School in the same township had been used as a storage place for township machinery until this spring when it was torn down and replaced with a larger building. In Salem Township the Valley School had long been used as a church building. It remains but is no longer in use and its days are numbered, and so throughout\n\nthe county here and there one may be found.\n\nThe rural school has played a conspicuous part in the history of our county, our state, and our nation. We retired teachers were a part of that history. It was here that we taught. It was here that we made our contribution to another generation ot God's people. We are grateful for the opportunity we have had, and are proud of the boys and girls we have taught. It is our hope that the heritage we received has been transmitted to our successors a bit richer.\n\nMuch effort has gone into the perfecting of this list and to those who have been responsible we give our sincere thanks. Our sources of information have been confined to the memory of those who once knew of the locations of these buildings and the information coming to us from Caldwell's Atlas of Monroe County. No doubt our list is incomplete. If anyone reading this has knowledge of any school not appearing on this list we would be glad to have the information to add at a later date.\n\nPage 4\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nADAMS TOWNSHIP\n\nMELLOTT RIDGE - This school building still stands and is used as a meeting house by a small congregation of the Church of Christ. At least two buildings stood on this site which is about 2 ½ miles from Cameron on County Road 231. The school was closed in 1937 and the pupils attended Cameron School. The last teacher there was Clarence Gates. Others were: John Pfalzgraf, Marjorie Bierie Webb, and Paul Turner.\n\nWEEKLY - This school was abandoned about 1883 and 1884. It was located on Township Road 168 in Section 25. The land on which it once stood is now owned by George Visnic. This school was replaced by Center School. A small cemetery still marks the spot where this building once stood.\n\nCENTER - This building was located in section 32 on Township Road 152 near the junction of Township Roads 152 and 167. Teachers known to have taught there were: Jacob Pfalzgraf, Samuel Pfalzgraf, John Pfalzgraf, Fred Pfalzgraf, T. T. Gillispie, Guy McKelvey, and Vernon Sumption.\n\nDEMOCRACY - Democracy School stood at the junction of County Road 30 and Township Road 454 about one mile south of Altitude or about 6 miles west of Cameron and about 6 miles east of Woodsfield. The ground on which it once stood is presently owned by Dorothy Walton. It closed about 1927 and was the first attempt at consolidation in Adams Township and probably one of the first in Monroe County. James McCaslin was hired to transport the pupils to Fairfax. Teachers known to have taught there were: Guy McKelvey, Daisy Keevert Ward, and the Kiedash Sisters.\n\nFAIRFAX - This building was located on what is now State Route 78 in section 29 on soil now owned by Stanley Ault. The building was moved and fashioned into a dwelling now owned by Bob Ollom. This was one of three school buildings that stood in the immediate vicinity. This building ceased to operate as a school about 1932-33. Teachers known to have taught there were: Jacob. Samuel, John, Fred Pfalzgraf.\n\nMINOR - On County Road 29 about 3 miles west of Cameron. The ground on which it once stood is presently owned by the S. E. Pfalzgraf heirs. This was on Sunfish Creek and closed about 1880.\n\nBRACEY - This building stood at what was once known as Bracey's Mills which was near the junction of Piney Creek and Sunfish Creek. The school seems to have gone out of existence with the mill. This is believed to be about 1880.\n\nDEWEY - This one room school was located on State Route 26 on the farm presently owned by James Lindamood. At least three different buildings were built on this location which is approximately nine miles north of Woodsfield or three miles south of Ozark. It closed about 1935 or 36. It was said to generally have been taught by a member of the Gallagher Family.\n\nCAMERON - The village of Cameron can boast of at least four school buildings since it was first laid out by James Atkinson in the year of 1837. The first being a log structure located near the old pioneer cemetery on land donated by Mr. Stephen Atkinson. This was a one room log structure and was replaced by a two room building on ground donated by George Suppes at the damsite' on Sunfish Creek near Suppes Mills almost directly east of the Pfalzgraf Store and post office. The village at this time was known as Jamestown having received its name by James Atkinson who first laid out the town. This building is still in existence having been converted into a home and is now occupied by Howard Hickman. In 1887 a new two room brick building was built on the site of the present building. Between 1924 and 1932 this building was also used as a high school. In 1939 the rooms were divided and became a four room building. Teachers of the high\n\nschool who are known to have taught there were: Cephus Stevens, Forrest Gutherie and Parcel Mallett. Some of the grade teachers who have taught there were: Pearl Treiber Kimpel, Clara McCoy, Margaret Wallace Hartline, Florence Hickman, Helen Pfalzgraf, Elaine Rea, Raymond Straight, David Highman, Brady Hines, Ethel Staib Pfalzgraf. Mrs. Ivan Miracle. Charles Ward, and Herman Bough.\n\nIn addition, Albert Ward, conducted two special classes there for a long period of time, possibly as much as twenty years. One class was in Spencerian writing and the other in pedagogy. This class was primarily directed at preparing teachers for the Boxwell examination, which if passed successfully would qualify them for certification as teachers. This venture had the blessing of the school examiners of the county and represents one of the earliest attempts at teacher training in Monroe County and possibly in the state as well.\n\nWritten by Lester Lehman\n\nPage 5\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nBENTON TOWNSHIP\n\nEarly History Prior to 1900\n\nIn 1813 the first school was taught by Henry Bower in a small log cabin in section 20. Another school was taught in 1815 in a log cabin on the land owned by Isaac M. Cline. The teacher was Wm. Knight. This location was along Muskingum Creek which was later known as Jericho Community.\n\nBenton Township it bound on the west by Washington Township, on the north by Perry Township, on the east by Jackson and on the south by Washington County. Before 1900 there were six schools in Benton Township which were as follows: Pine Ridge No. 1; Trail Run No. 2, this was changed to No. 4 in 1817; Oak Grove No. 3; Brownsville Exempted Village No. 4\n\nand in 1920 changed to No. 6; Pine Knob No. 5 later becoming No. 2; Jericho No. 6 later to become No. 5. Trail Run first known as No. 2 and later to become No. 4 was located in Section 2 along the Trail Run Stream on Route 800 south of Antioch. In 1908 the ground was sold from Joseph Hanna Hill to Chris Busche. In 1914 the school building was moved across the road on the Thomas Carson lot. In 1929 the school was discontinued and the building torn down in 1930 and sold to Everett Dimit. The following teachers taught at Trail Run:\n\n1901 - 02 O. A. Bonar\n\n1902 - 03 Jacob C.

In August of 1920 the Brownsville Exempted Village School Board combined with the Benton Township School Board as Brownsville School No. 6. A new schoolhouse was built in 1912 to replace the old house destroyed by a cyclone. The new building was a one story\n\n26 x 30 foot structure. The contract to build was given to I. O. Swallow for $650.00 and an additional $200.00 for the annexed townhouse. It was voted that labor was not to exceed $2.00 per day for tearing down the old building. When the school was closed in 1964, the building was sold to Glen Dye who later sold it to Eugene Winland. He made the building into a garage. In 1959 the Benton Township School District became a part of the River Local District. In 1964 the Brownsville and Antioch Schools were consolidated to form the New Midway School on Route 800 south of Antioch.\n\nThe following were Brownsville teachers:\n\n1901 - 02 Miranda Wilson (6 mo., $180.)\n\n1902 Miranda Wilson (2 mo. summer, $22.50 per mo.)\n\n1902 - 04 Miranda Wilson (6 mo., $30. per mo.)\n\n1904 - 09 Miranda Wilson (8 mo. $40.00 per mo.)\n\n1909 - 11 E.

Connie Graham was the vocal teacher and Van Morris the instrumental. Morris soon had each student in grades 5. 6. 7 & 8 playing in the cadet band (19). Glen Dye provided instruments for those students unable to buy their own. There was never an inside bathroom in any Benton Township School nor any school lunches ever served. Glen Dye taught 44 years in Benton Township. Helen (McHugh) Dye taught 34 years and 29 of these were consecutive in Brownsville. Miranda Wilson taught 18 years in Brownsville; Kermit Cline 10 years in Benton Township and Ray Ring 14 years in Benton Township.\n\n1901 W. C. Pool $30. plus $3.00 per trip\n\n1901 - 02 J. A.

The road on which it was located is know known as Gun Club Road. No one seems to remember the date of its closing but the year 1920 is very close. The last teacher was Chester Lang and reliable sources say that in its last year of operation it had one pupil whose name was Olive Marple. The present owners of the school site are Darrol and Hattie Byers.\n\nDENT - Dent or Dent Ridge as it was commonly called was named for the Dent family who were among the earliest settlers of this portion of the township. It was located .7 mile east of the junction of State Route 800 and County Road 67 on County Road 67. Among its outstanding pupils was Dean Jeffers who is presently General Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nationwide Insurance Organization. He was a pupil here for a part of his elementary career as his father, J. E. Jeffers, was a teacher here at intervals over a period of several years. The school ceased operation in 1939 the last teacher was Janet Smith Boyer. The present owner of the schoolhouse site is Tony Urbanek Sr.\n\nEDDY - Eddy School was located approximately one fourth mile north of the Eddy Bridge crossing on Sunfish Creek on County Road 27 known as the Moore Ridge Road. The closing date was either 1925 or 1926 and reliable sources say that the last teacher was Oliver Dougherty. The land where the school house stood is now owned by David Belt, Trustee. The Belt family lived in the valley here only a few hundred feet south of the school. Members of this family became prominent in the legal profession mainly in the Belmont County area. The name of Clifford Belt a former pupil of this school is very well remembered.\n\nHALFWAY - Halfway School was located halfway between Woodsfield and Lewisville which is undoubtedly the reason for its name. That location is approximately 4 miles west of Woodsfield on State Route 78 on the left side of the highway as you are driving west. The last year of operation was 1929 and the last teacher was Edith Foehrenbach Zerger. The land on which the schoolhouse stood is now owned by Bernice Diehl Franklin.\n\nHOPE RIDGE - Hope Ridge School, which is now used as a garage by its owner, Willard Freitag, stands on the right side of State Route 800 at a point approximately two miles north of Woodsfield. It ceased operations in 1929 and the last teacher was Nellie Turner Jones. Among its many pupils is found the name of Clem Freitag, athlete and football standout at Washington and Jefferson College. He was awarded football letters there in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1909.\n\nKERR - Kerr School stood at a location .4 mile west of Woodsfield Corporation and a few hundred feet east of that spot on the right side of State Route 78 as you are headed west. Its last year of operation was 1928 and its last teacher was G. I. Umpleby. After its close a new four room school was erected between it and the highway. This four room building was eventually closed and its pupils transported to Woodsfield Elementary. The present owner and occupant of the four room building is the Masonic Lodge of Woodsfield.\n\nJACKSON RIDGE - Jackson Ridge School stood at the junction of State Route 800 and County Road 40 at a distance of three miles south of Woodsfield. It was the last of the fifteen one room schools to close its doors and reliable sources give the date as 1947. The last teacher was H. F. Burkhart. His son, George, who is now the Prosecuting Attorney of\n\nMonroe County was a pupil here for a part of his elementary career. The exact location of the building is now crossed by State Route 800. The remaining portion of the schoolhouse lot is now owned by Neil Hamilton.\n\nJOHNSTON - The location of Johnston School is a little difficult to describe. At a point one and one half miles south of Miltonsburg on County Road 100 stood the residence of Sebastian Burkhart. No road went from here to the schoolhouse. A path was mostly used and if you were compelled to drive to it, you would drive across the fields of Otto Kaiser who is the present owner of the land on which the schoolhouse stood. The school was closed\n\nin the spring of 1938 and the last teacher was Vernon Hamilton.\n\nMOOSE RIDGE - Moose Ridge School stood at a point opposite the first Moose Ridge Cemetery one and one fourth mile southwest of Woodsfield at the junction of Moose Ridge Road and Willison Run Road. Moose Ridge Road is known as County Road 45. The school was closed in 1929 and the last teacher was Kathryn Keyser Cline. The land on which the schoolhouse stood is presently owned by Lucille Mahoney Hunnell.\n\nPage 11\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nMT. CARRICK - Mt. Carrick School stood at a point approximately 2.5 miles east of Woodsfield on State Route 78 and up a lane a few hundred feet north of this point. This would place the location almost directly across the highway from the former Mt. Carrick church house now occupied by the Center Township Grange. The school closed in 1929 and Joseph Paulus was the last teacher. The land on which the schoolhouse stood is now owned by the Neuhart Baptist Church.\n\nNEUHART - Neuhart School was located one mile south of the junction of State Route 78 east and County Road 41 commonly known as Sugartree Road. The exact location was on a plot of ground adjacent to the Neuhart Baptist Church cemetery on its southern border. The school was permanently closed in 1938 and the last teacher was B. R. Scarborough. This plot today is used as a parking lot and owned by the Neuhart Baptist Church.\n\nMULBERRY KNOB -· Mulberry Knob School was located on the right side of County Road 40 on Plainview Road at a distance of two miles from the junction of State Route 800 and County Road 40 headed south. The school was closed in 1939 and the last teacher was Vernon Hamilton. The land on which the schoolhouse stood is presently owned by Dale Eddy.\n\nNORRIS - Norris School stood on the left side of State Route 800 as you are headed south one mile south of the Woodsfield Corporation. The school closed in 1929 and its last teacher was Harriet Claugus Zesiger. The building\n\nwas later converted into a dwelling an an office for a service station.. This station is owned and operated by Tony Urbanek Sr.\n\nSTANDING STONE - Standing Stone School was located southwest of the junction of State Route 26 North and County Road 39 known as the Sunfish Creek Road. By following the 0. R. and W. Railroad right of way west of the junction for approximately one thousand feet and then moving to your left for a distance of a little less than one hundred yards to the valley floor, you have the approximate location. I was unable to find anyone who knows why this name originated but it doubtless had something to do with the rocky terrain that surrounds the location on all sides. The school was closed in 1932 and the last teacher was Joseph Paulus. A great majority of the teachers who taught here walked down the railroad tracks from the direction of Woodsfield and passed through the tunnel, the only tunnel along the entire railroad route from Woodsfield to Bellaire. The land on which the schoolhouse stood is now owned by Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Davis.\n\nIN RETROSPECT\n\nI have a granddaughter who will, in a few months, enter the teaching profession. In closing a recent thesis she wrote this paragraph:\n\nI hope to teach in my home county just as Grandpa did. Even with the modern teaching devices many teachers today don't stay with the schools as long as he did. Forty years -- that will be a hard record to beat.\n\nIn the back of their minds the teachers of one room rural schools of the 30's and 40's knew that consolidation of school districts was rapidly approaching and the one room schools would permanently close and a new era in education would begin.\n\nTeachers believed that now the pupils would have opportunities for learning that never existed before. They would now receive more individual attention, class periods would be much longer and their teachers would be better trained to give them attention and guidance. So many changes have occurred since the beginning of consolidation and no doubt there will be many more in the future.\n\nSeven years I attended the one room school out on Dent Ridge. It was a well constructed building of strong native timbers and located in pleasant surroundings. As I studied here I would try to picture how school was conducted here during Civil War days when Grandmother Hamilton was a pupil in a log cabin school situated across the road and not over 500 feet from the one room frame building. I had four teachers here namely: John H. Hickinbotham, J. E. Jeffers, G. D. Griffith and Golda Mowder Roth. Only Mrs. Roth is living today but I realize that each of these teachers in some way have left their imprint on my life.\n\nWhen my teaching career started, I spent the first twelve years in several one room rural schools. I cannot say that\n\nPage 12\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nI was a successful teacher. I do know that the great majority of my former pupils still regard me at a dear friend and possibly only time will tell if I really did anything to enrich their lives and to assist them in preparing for their future.\n\nDuring these twelve years a few events occurred that I consider high points in my career. I was privileged to teach three years in my home school. Two years I spent teaching in a school in Lee Township. My mother had attended this school as a girl and her mother before her had been a pupil there. Many times I rang the Haldiman bell which is now on exhibit in the Monroe County Museum. One year I spent at Standing Stone where each day saw the O.R. and W. Railroad as it wound down its operations and in a matter of months would cease operations forever.\n\nDuring my forty years in the schoolroom as a teacher I came to know and respect a great number of good teachers. I have a warm spot of affection in my heart for the ones who taught in the one room rural schools. They are truly grass roots people. They understand the problems of people especially those who live in rural areas. They labored under many adverse conditions. They received little financial benefits. Many of them taught during the years of the Great Depression. Through their teaching the great majority of their pupils learned resourcefulness, independence and the value of integrity.\n\nWhen and if awards for distinguished service are made in the future, I trust the citizens of our county will respectfully honor those who spent so many years as teachers of the one room schools. I know of no group of individuals who have rightfully earned such an award and who would take greater pride in its attainment.\n\nVernon S. Hamilton\n\nHISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE WOODSFIELD PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\nBy Dr. J. J. Sulsbarger 1916\n\nThe history and development of the Woodsfield Schools divides itself naturally into two periods, the line of demarcation being the closing of the Old Monroe Academy in 1860, which was situated on the present school site, and which well serves as the closing of the first period.\n\nIn consideration of the first period it will be necessary for us to go back to the early pioneer days of Woodsfield, which is before the time and memory of the oldest citizens now living.\n\nIn searching the record, at the Recorder's office we found that in the original plot of the Village of Woodsfield (as recorded in Belmont County in 1812) that Lot No. 104 was set aside for school purposes.\n\nAs there is more or less uncertainty as to the date of the founding of Woodsfield, I will quote from the old Hand Atlas: \"in the year 1814, Archibald Woods, then a large land owner, brought out from Wheeling a keg of French brandy and invited the men and boys, within a radius of five miles to a general frolic, the purpose of which was to clean out Main Street. This was done and the first trees felled.\"\n\nThe pioneer school of Woodsfield was held in the first Court House, which was a log building and stood on the east side of Public Square. It was also used at a place for religious services by all of the denominations as well as public meetings of all kinds.\n\nVery little information of records can be had regarding the early history, especially of the schools. The only source of information that I could find was in the minds and recollections of our older citizens which source will not always be available.\n\nThe first building known to have been used for school purposes was the old Billy Schively property, the present location of Chas. Joost'r home and Meat Market.\n\nA number of our oldest citizens attended a select school taught by a Mrs. McManus in the East room of the Mrs. Mullican property just across the street from the first location.\n\nThe first real school building was a little log house located on the Mary Smith lot, diagonally oppotite the Jail. Mr. R. W. Pope started to school in thir building. It was taught by a widow by the name of Mrs. Miller. Mr. Pope's parents paid his tuition to have him taught the letters that term. To know your letters in those days was considered a long step towards one's education. The rising generation do not fully appreciate the advantages they now have in brick and frame school houses and with well trained teachers, over their fathers and grandfathers who had to travel through sleet and snow to receive the first rudiments of an education. If they advanced as far as the \"3 R's - reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic\" they considered themselves good scholars. If they could go through the single Rule of Three (3) they were indeed finished scholars and qualified to fill any official position.\n\nWhat a change a few fleeting years have brought about, when compared with the present High School Curriculum for course of study.\n\nPage 13\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nWe go next to the brick school building on lot No. 104 which was set aside for school purposes as previously referred to - this building was located on the rear of the Dan Akers, (now Forrest Hall) lot, on the alley just back of the Asher Okey home on South Main Street.\n\nHistory refers to this school house as built in the year 1831 and first taught by Robert E. Naylor followed by Edward Salisbury and Prof. Billy Brooks. Mr. Ezra Craigs memory seems clear as to the latter. R. W. Pope, John and Philip Schumacher, Mr. Craig, D. O. Jones and others attended here\n\nAbout this time the School Board decided on the plan of consolidating the various select and public schools into one building. They purchased the present school grounds, but a new board was elected and they decided to sell this and purchase a lot on South Main Street now occupied by Mrs. M. J. Devore, where they proceeded to build the \"New School House\" as it was proudly referred to, about 1852-3. It was a frame building and contained four class rooms. The teachers in the new building were: Prof. Wheeler and wife and a Mrs. Flanagan, also, Prof. Manning and others later.\n\nWe are now first introduced to that unique and original character, Prof. \"Johnnie\" Moore of whom, no doubt some of my older readers have some recollection. He was a Scotchman, tall in stature, and light complected [sic]. He was \"strict and used the gad very freely. This is attested to by several of our older citizens still living. Just the name of Johnnie Moore to these ex-pupils seems to recall to their recollections some exciting and sensational school days. They will all remind you of the habit that he and the teachers had in those times of throwing useless playthings in the stove, and how the boys got a half day's vacation when Rans Conner's loaded pistol was thrown in -- it took one half day to fix the old stove and clean up the soot. (So they say). Mr. P. Schumacher says he sat in a seat with Mr. Pope but didnt see him from one recess to the next because he had but two eyes and didn't dare use them for anything else than to watch \"Johnnie\" with one and his book with the other. A mode of punishment much used by Prof. Moore was to make the boys stand on a chalk box on one foot, of course, sometimes holding a dictionary in one hand. My father, (L. Sulsberger) who went to school three months out of a year, as was the custom of the time, often refers to the above incidents. He also used a vise concern on the nose, the silly \"fools cap\", palms extended to be struck with rod, etc.\n\nOn Nov. 17, 1862, the present location was repurchased from James Mitchell at a cost of $1,000. The grounds were larger than the present bounds, and 3/4 acres was occupied by the old Monroe Academy (or Seminary) previously mentioned, This building served the quiet little town of 800 Inhabitants for a number of years, schooling the majority of our elderly citizens.\n\nJust a brief description of the Monroe Academy which had much to do with school life in Woodsfield will not be out of place here. It had a wide reputation and was attended by many from our border counties. The historical Atlas of our county contains the following: \"The efficiency of our schools and school system under the beneficent laws of our state is dependent upon the qualification and character of the Board of Examiners. The first was Franklin Gale a graduate of Amhurst College who came to this county in 1833. The people of Woodsfield finding him to be thoroughly efficient induced him to remain. In 1833-40 he taught a select school, was a member of the Board of Examiners and became identified with the educational interests of the county.\n\nUnder his auspices the old Academy was built, of lNhich Prof. A. Ross and Prof. G. P. Mason had charge and who afterwards were chosen Professors of Bethany College on its reorganization.\n\nHowe's History of Ohio in which 1 expected to find much interesting information contained this brief reference: \"The Monroe Academy was built in 1846. Judge John Waterman Okey at one time Chief Justice of State, says the only institution of learning he attended was the Old Monroe Academy. This gives us some idea of the thoroughness of the work done. This building was equipped with planks for desks and split-bottom chairs. The bell was mounted on a high derrick which stood close enough to the building that the Professor in charge needed only raise the window to ring the bell.\"\n\nWe were unable to learn why this institution was not continued here that today we might not have a college here instead at Bethany, W.Va. It must have been a case of lost opportunity. Had it received the proper encouragement no doubt our fondest dreams would have been fulfilled.\n\nWith the passing if the Academy we begin the second period of development, which seems less eventful but shows progress  steadily advancing attendance, size, cost of buildings, equipment, etc. This progress was brought about through a long line of prominent and influential educators in their time. Do doubt some of you owe a lasting debt of gratitude for what you are or may yet become to those noble men.\n\nWhile there is a wide difference in opinion as to what constitutes an education, we have long ago agreed that it must be moral, practical as well as theoretical, and follow along the line aptly expressed as the three Hs which means a proper development of the head, heart and hand.\n\nFollowing is a list (more or less complete) of the instructors: Prof. Johnnie Moore, (Wm. Cook says The reason he had so much influence with the Board of Education was because he could quote a little Latin, drink a little liquor, was handy about the Court House affairs, and kept good government.) He was followed by Eli Smith and a Prof. Rev. Groves, 1873-74, S. G. Cosgrove; '74-'76, Prof. Lopez; '76-'77, W.P. Cope; '79-'80-'82, Watson; '82-'83, Jas. A. Watson; '83-'86, Prof. Clark; '86-'87, H. Morrow; '90-'01, Prof. Beck; '01-'02, W. R. Bayes; '04-'05, Prof. Cy. Locher; '05-'08, Prof. C. McVey; '08-'09. Prof. Harlan Scarborough; '09-'12; Bert Highlands;'l2-'14. G. W. Brown; '14-'15, A. T. Stanforth. The present incumbent is R. C. Maston - 1915 to mid year 1917.\n\nPage 14\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nThere being no data regarding this period, we must resort to hearsay and observation.\n\nWe know that the Academy was pulled down and a new two story, six roomed brick, built just back of it. That this then modern and up-to-date structure served to house the schools until 1896. Then the present three story, nine room, with basement and auditorium, brick edifice was erected at a cost of $20,000 and nine years ago the annex at a cost of over $12.000 with the future beckoning us to continue the good work.\n\nBuilt annex 1906-1907.\n\nThe history of education in Ohio reveals a constant anxiety on the part of her citizens to make liberal provision for its schools, to discover the best method of conducting it, to encourage the most thorough training of her teachers, to place before her youth the highest ideals and to fit them for the various duties of mature life. Thus, her citizenship and patriotism have upheld Article III, of the Ordinance of 1787 which provided that \"religion, morality and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\"\n\nStatistics reveal that in 1880 Woodsfield public school property was valued at $12,000.00, number of teachers employed: Primary 5, High school 1. Average wage per month $25.00 in grades, high school $700. Total number of pupils enrolled 220. Since the year 1880 there has been a decided development as will be seen upon comparison with the school record of 1916;\n\nvaluation $40,000.00, to which may be added another like sum upon completion of the new high school plant. A monthly payroll of about $1,000.00, number of teachers employed 16, average wage grades $45.00, high school $82.66, total number pupils enrolled 570; grades 444, high 126. The tuition received from attendance of grade and high school pupils from other districts amounts to about $1000.00. This comparison although favorable as it is, brings us face to face with the rapidly advancing standards of our educational system, which calls for a continuous \"awakening\" to the necessity and opportunity which it affords.\n\nThe voters of Woodsfield Village School District fully expressed the warm appreciation for education held by our community when on the 24th day of April, 1915, at a special election 352 voted \"yes\" to 84 \"no\" for the erection of a new high school building to cost $50.000.00. This building to be fire-proof in compliance with Ohio State Building Code,\n\nto be centrally located and contain a large auditorium and gymnasium in compliance with wish of the majority of our citizens, to be an up to date plant, complete in Itself, and large enough for future demands, which requires one room for Domestic Science, one for Manual Training, a Chemical Laboratory, etc., for the present. The heating and ventilating system\n\nis of the latest advanced type. The completion of this beautiful building will add much to the physical appearance of Woodsfield and serve as a constant inspiration for the youth of the entire community educationally.\n\nHenceforth, with the appropriation, of sufficient funds, 'Good Schools\" will have been accomplished if the slogan \"Good Roads and Good Schools\" is really the crying need for the \"future of Woodsfield.\" Fine school buildings augment the value of every realty investment in a community and should appeal to the civic pride of every progressive citizen.\n\nWe reckon the capacity and efficiency of a mechanical industry by its finished product. Can we not in summing up consider the graduates of an institution of learning as its finished product? The first class to graduate was in 1879. they were: Eloise (Williams) McCann. Eila May (Morris) Miller and Otto P. Cassil. Since that time the grand total of 233 (including the class of 1916), have graduated from the Woodsfield Public Schools - indeed a fine product.\n\nThink a moment on the influence for good that radiates from the lives of this host of efficient young men and women, in their widely scattered homes through almost every state in the union.\n\nThe present 1916 teaching staff of the Woodsfield Public School is as follows:\n\nPage 15\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nThe lot mentioned (104) has the same number today (Feb. 1976) and the house is occupied by Mr. and Mrs.Charles Harper.\n\nCharles Joost Meat Market is the building now used by Don Evans, Optometrist at 112 East Court Street.\n\nFranklin Gale was in charge of the Monroe Academy which was located on North Paul Street. Woodsfield, the site of the present (1976) Elementary School built in 1953. One wonders if Woodsfield residents would have been interested they might have had Bethany College here.\n\nThe next school after the one on 104 is still here at 224 South Main Street. One can see that there were four rooms, two up and two down. Later, when no longer used for a school additions were added in the back and for years was a one family residence. Today there are three apartments and the building doesn't show its age.\n\nIn 1896 a three story red brick building was erected on North Paul Street. For years the uppermost floor was used for a high school. In 1915 the citizens voted to build the present (1976) high school. Additions have been added, an auditorium and a gymnasium.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL DEDICATION.\n\nThe dedicatory exercises of the new high school building will begin at one o'clock sharp Thursday, July 26, 1917.\n\nIn these days of intense military preparation when the very air seems to be charged with patriotism, and every individual is anxious to show his loyalty, the various committees concerned with the dedication feel constrained to ask the citizens of Woodsfield to make an effort to outdo all previous efforts in decorating.\n\nEvery business house and every residence should be decorated as never before, because never before have we had as many reasons for so doing. We are in the midst of a great war to uphold Americans ideals and we are dedicating a new building to an institution which will build these ideals higher.\n\nHang out your flags and bunting.\n\nPUBLICITY COMMITTEE\n\nRESULT OF TEACHERS' EXAMINATION JUNE 29,1917\n\nOne year high school: Byron Lemley.

However, we must pay tribute to those one-room schools, their teachers and boards of education who served their day and time well. Although lacking the training and me many advantages of our schools today, the fundamentals of education and basic values of life cannot be measured.\n\nFranklin Township had seven one-room schools and one-four-room building in Stafford. This building housed both grades and high school. The grades were divided into two rooms with four grades in each.\n\nThe one-room buildings were as follows:\n\nDAVIS RIDGE:\n\nLocated about four miles southeast of Stafford near the Bethel Township line on County Road 73. The building, now removed, stood on the west ride of the road. This was also a community center with a general store in operation for many years. Davis Ridge still has a rich history in the memory of many people. The school was closed in the early forties. The last teacher was Hilton Coss.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught in this school were:\n\nWritten by Mr. and Mrs. Roy Miracle\n\nHANSON:\n\nLocated on Hanson Ridge Road about three miles northeast of Stafford. or you can turn south from State Route 145 at Baker & Sons Implement Co. and follow to the Hanson farm. It was from this family that the school got its name. The school was closed in 1937 and pupils moved to Stafford. The last teacher was Wiley Thompson.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught in this school were:\n\nKNOB (KNOB COLLEGE):\n\nLocated three miles north of Stafford on County Road about ¼ mile off State Road 145 going toward Summerfield, commonly known as Bean Ridge. The building, now removed, stood on a knell east of the road. The land is now owned by James Robinson. The school was closed in 1929. The last teacher was Mrs. Freda Reed.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught in this school were:\n\nMUSH RUN:\n\nLocated about two miles from Stafford (East). Leave Hartshorn Ridge Road No. 12 and follow Mush Run Road No. 228 about ½ mile. The building, now removed, stood on the east bank of the road. The school was closed in 1929.\n\nThe last teacher was Dorothy Miracle.\n\nPage 18\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nSWAZEY - 1898 to 1934 - District No. 3:\n\nLocated about six miles north of Stafford on Swazey Road. Turn north off state Route 145 at Sandbar Bridge, follow Swazey Road to an abandoned church and cemetery. The building, now removed, was located just back of the church. This was a community center in those early days. The thriving Gibson Store was on the wagon road from points south to the O. R. & W. Railway Station in Ethel. The school was closed in 1934. Mrs. Madge Ullman was the last teacher.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught in this school were:\n\nTHORNTON:\n\nLocated two miles northwest of Stafford on Township Road 1038. Going from Stafford one mile turn left on Township Road 660 and then right on 1038 and follow valley to foot of hill. The building still standing, is now used as a barn by the land owner Oscar Wells. The name originated from a family by the name of Thornton. The school closed in 1929. The last teacher was Mrs. Mildred (Mallett) Young.\n\nSome teachers who taught in this school were:\n\nWELLS:\n\nLocation: Going south from Stafford on Township Road No. 289 two miles, then turn right on County Road 78 (Creighton Ridge Road) going past Harold McConnells and Heber Hines. The building, now removed, was located on the north side of the road on the corner of the Hines farm. The name originated from a family by the name of Wells. The land was purchased in 1903 by Wesley McConnell and now owned by his grandson, Robert Hines. The school was closed in 1937. The last teacher was Freda Reed.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught in this school were:\n\nPage 19\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nGREEN TOWNSHIP\n\nSchool statistics for the year ending August 31, 1881, are as follows: Total school monies received within the year $2,846.18.

The number of pupils attending the grade school at the close of the 1974-75 school year at Laings School was 63.\n\nThe information found on the following pages pertaining to the schools of Green Township was gathered by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Pfalzgraf both being former teachers in Monroe County. You will notice that they were able\n\nto obtain a picture of each of these schools taken sometime during their existence which is most unusual but assists us in getting a better picture of school days as they were.\n\nWritten by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond\n\nLAINGS --- At Laings just off State Route 255\n\nThis wooden building served from the early 1920's until 1936 when it was destroyed by fire, then a new brick building was erected. Both these buildings housed the grade room and the Green Rural High School until the high school closed in 1957. However, it had been made into a two room grade school before 1957. A three room grade school was in operation\n\nfor one year followed by the four room grade school. By 1964, the remodeled and with a new addition added, the four room grade school went into operation as it is today. In 1975 it had a total of 63 pupils.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught in the Laings one room grade school were:\n\nPATTON - 4.6 mile, south of Laings on State Route 255\n\nThere were at least three Patton schoolhouses. The first was located a little farther south than the present one. Little is known of the second one. In 1941 the Patton Sunday School bought the building from the Green Township Board of Education. It continued to function as a Sunday School until 1950 when it closed for lack of attendance. Three trustees, Homer Rufener, Otto Refener, and Fred Hinderlong (now deceased) have charge of the building. The public school closed in 1950.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught there are:\n\nPage 20\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nFOX SCHOOL - stood 6.7 miles southeast of Laings on State Route 536\n\nThis school was probably built in the 1880's. It housed the Fox Sunday School for years. The public school closed in the mid 1940s. Tip Yost bought the school house including the bell. The land went back to the Fred Straub farm.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught at Fox School were:\n\nLEHIGH - was probably built before 1880.\n\nIt closed in the 1930's. Homer Winkler bought the school house and made a home of it. The land went back to the James Fankhauser Farm.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught there are:\n\nBENWOOD SCHOOL - was located 2.8 miles south of Laings on State Route 255.\n\nThe Benwood school was probably built before 1880. It closed in the 1950's. The schoolhouse was sold to Raymond Alleman who sold it to a Mr. Truax and he built a home of it. The land went back to the James Holtsclaw farm.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught at Benwood School are:\n\nPage 21\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nLAUREL RUN SCHOOL - stood 2.6 miles northwest of Laings on Cranesnest Road.\n\nThe first Laurel Run schoolhouse was hauled away by oxen to the Alexander Farm and was remodeled into a home in which the Edward Starr family lived. The above school was built in me 1880's. Sunday School and Summer School was held there in the 1880's and 1890s. Carl Henthorn bought the building probably in the 1930's and used it for repairing other buildings. The land went back to the Edward Starr farm.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught there were:\n\nPage 22\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nBURNT SCHOOL\n\nThe above picture was taken the last year of operation which was in 1957. It stood four miles east of Laings on County Road 4. The two preceding schoolhouses were named Pleasant View and both burned. The above school building was built in the 1890's by a Mr. Hall. This building was then named the Burnt School. It was closed in 1957. Bob Minder bought the building in the late 50's. The land went back to the John Pfalzgraf farm.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught at Burnt were:\n\nLAUREL GROVE or OTTS - stood 4.1 miles west of Laings on County Road 104.\n\nLaurel Grove or Otts school closed in 1942. Homer Workman bought it in 1944 and made a home of it. The land went back to the Chester Craig farm.\n\nSome of the teachers who taught at Laurel Grove or Otts were:\n\nPage 23\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nLAINGS  1893\n\nThe Board of Education of this township met Saturday and elected the following teachers for the coming winter: Patton School, Charles Straight; Benwood, Jacob Wood; Otts, J. G. Devaul; New Castle, Owen Hurd; Fox, Eugene Imhoff; Round Bottom, John Anshutz; Lehigh, Jacob Clegg; Laurel Run, J. E. Hurd.

H. Kreig who was once a teacher in this township. With the exception of one of the schools which was Millers Run, all were closed in the same year which was 1930. Millers Run had closed several years earlier but Mr. Kreig was not sure of the time but he was of the opinion that it was in the late teens or early twenties.\n\nHigh Knob - stood on Kreig Ridge Road about two miles east of Brownsville on land that is now owned by Albert Kreig.\n\nFrobish - on what is commonly known as the Joe Frobish Road. It stood near the old Methodist Church which is now in a state of disrepair, however, an old cemetery near the church will indicate and assist in locating the site of this building. Wanda Byers is now the owner of the land.\n\nMt. Zion - On Route 800 was about two miles west of Route 7 on land originally owned by Kines Tuel. The land has since been subdivided into small building tracts and it is difficult to tell precisely where the building was originally located.\n\nGravel Hill - Stood on land adjoining the Gravel Hill Baptist Church in Fly, Ohio.\n\nJames Run School - stood a short half mile from Route 7 now on the Gale Bradfield farm, when build the land was secured from Jacob Bradfield. Mr. G. H. Kreig to whom I am indebted for this information was the last teacher there in 1930.\n\nMillers Run School - closed early possibly about 1920. It stood about a half mile northwest of State Route 7 on Millers Run.\n\nWitten -- on Route 7 about two miles north of Fly stood very near where Wittens Chapel now stands. The land was secured from the Joe Witten farm and thus came to be known as the Witten School.\n\nMt. Etna or Aetna - stood at the head of Dogskin Run probably on what is now the Esmyer Farm about one half mile northeast of Locust Grove Church.\n\nCalido Ridge - This school was formed by combining the Narrows Run and Barker School. It stood about four miles west of the Ohio River on land now a part of the Joe Myers Farm.\n\nLEE TOWNSHIP\n\nWritten by Lester C.

Grossenbacher Farm. The home of Russel Ruble now stands where the school was located.\n\nLower Narrows Run - This school was located on Narrows Run only about one half mile from Route 7.\n\nUpper Narrows Run - was located about 3 miles from Route 7 near the present Narrows Run Bridge.\n\nBlack - Caldwell's Atlas shows a school that once existed on lands near the G. Burnham and the John Easley Farms. The only information available on this school is that it was named Black.\n\nSalem School - This school was located in Ohio Township near the Lutheran Church.

This is about 3 miles from Ohio Route 7 and the land is now owned by the North American Coal Company.\n\nBUCKHILL - was located about 3 miles north of Hannibal, Ohio on what was once known as Buckhill Bottom. The original site was very close to what is now the entrance to the Conalco Plant. The Conalco Company now owns the land.\n\nDUFFY - was a two-room school and as the name suggests it was located in Duffy, Ohio and is one of the few buildings yet standing. It too has been converted to other use and is now the Church of God. Mr. Sam Leudy and Mrs. Burns were the last teachers there and had taught there several years before its closing.\n\nFOX - Of this school little information is available other than it was located almost directly across the road from the entrance to the Roger Tenley Farm and that it was once nicknamed \"Pinkeye.\"\n\nZION - was one of the earliest schools in Ohio Township. It was a two room building and has long since been torn down. It was located on Route 536 at the point where the Mule Ridge Road intersects.\n\nMORTON - on State Route 255 about 6 miles west of Sardis. The location is still called Morton. It was located very close to Morton Church and cemetery both of which are very near the spot where this building stood.\n\nNO. 9 OR BLACK - stood on a spot on Boston Hill Road where Isaly Hill Road and Boston Hill intersect. Eddy Nething now owns the land and his dwelling house stands very close to the location of this once familiar landmark.\n\nMOUNT UNION - also known as No. 3 stood on Long Ridge Road at the spot where Short Ridge Road intersects. The land is now owned by Jacob Fraley.\n\nMT. VERNON - The park, the cemetery, and the church still remain to indicate the setting of this one room school. It stood very close to the driveway and the land is probably a part of the park. John and Willis Gehrig own the surrounding area from which the land to locate the school, church, and cemetery originally came.\n\nHANNIBAL - was originally built as a four room brick building and was one of the oldest buildings in the township at the time it was razed which was about 10 years ago, intended at the time of construction to be used only as a grade school. However, two additional rooms were added later and the building was used both as a high school and a grade school. A one room wooden structure was also added later which was used for storage and home economics classes. This land was obtained from one of the original settlers of Hannibal; the Bares and it has recently been discovered that when this land\n\nwas no longer to be used it was to revert to the original owners. We are told that the courts are now trying to discover who these are and the land will then revert to them. The lot is on the corner where 536 turns to the hill. Mr. A. A. Byers was the last principal, there.\n\nWritten by Lester G. Lehman\n\nPage 30\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nPERRY TOWNSHIP ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS\n\nNine elementary school houses, or districts were located in Perry Township. They were designated by name and by district number. Five male citizens were elected as board members for the township and one director was elected or appointed for each district. The board members had the same duties as those of today, while the director had the right to select the teacher. The director was-abolished after the County Superintendent was employed.\n\nThe schools in Perry Township were viz.: Antioch, Davidson, Greenbrier, Harmony, Lyman, Mechanicsburg, Pumpkin Ridge, Rice (later - Plainview). and Wildcat.\n\nSince the writer received all his elementary education in the Lyman School, an attempt will be made to deal particularly with that school. Much of what might be said of it could also be said of most of the other schools. Like the proverbial flapper's dress, it is hoped this article will be short enough to be interesting, yet long enough to cover some areas of interest.\n\nThe Lyman School was located about five miles east of Antioch. Ohio, on County Road No. 9, near the West Union Church House. The building was constructed by Benjamin K. Starkey for the sum of $100. Two small auxiliary buildings and a coal house were erected near the school building. The two small white structures were located, one on the port side and the other on the starboard side and at the rear of the main facility. The one on the port side was recognized as \"His'm\" and the other, as \"Her'n\". Each had only one door with no \"fire escape\" provisions, neither did they have windows. By today's standards, they would not meet the Ohio Safety Requirements. Some of these small buildings in other areas were decorated with a star or half-moon design which was sawed through the gable end of these structures.\n\nThese served a three-fold purpose: (a) they were decorative, (b) they let in light, (c) they were used for ventilation. The third building was the coal house which was used to store fuel for the cold weather.\n\nThe size of the school building was probably 24' x 36'. According to the building code, the height of ceiling was equal to one-half the width of the building. In the center of the room was a No. 1 Burnside stove. Two rows of\n\ndouble seats, with an ink well in the middle of the desk, were arranged on each side of the room. One set of maps with window blind rollers was hung above the blackboard. The only mobile equipment were the teacher's desk and chair, an unabridged dictionary, globe, a granite water pail and a dipper which we all used when thirsty. Many times during very hot weather two boys would get permission to bring a pail of fresh water from a neighborhood well. The teacher would then permit the boys to water the flock. One boy carried the pail while the other boy, using the dipper, passed it to each of the pupils.\n\nAt one time, it was said, that there were 63 pupils enrolled in Lyman School. They ranged from age six to twenty-one. Many of the early teachers went directly from the elementary school to teach school in another district. They were required to pass a teacher's examination in Arithmetic, Grammar, Geography, History, Orthography, Penmanship, Spelling, and Reading.\n\nThe pupils were graded as primary, intermediate, and advanced. While James M. Cox was Governor of Ohio, the system of education was drastically changed. A County Superintendent was appointed for each county. Assistants were also used in some counties. J. V. Nelson, as the writer recalls, was the first Monroe County Superintendent. Ed. C. Feiock and Worth Goddard were the assistants. It was at this time that all pupils were graded from grade one\n\nthrough grade eight. When Mr. Goddard visited our school the first time, he was asked by Mr. Eisenbarth, the teacher, to place us in our correct grades. The writer was placed in the eighth grade.\n\nThe \"school\" itself, was graded sometime around 1910 or 1911. In order for a school to meet the second grade requirement, it must have a drinking fountain, a globe, and about twenty-five dollars worth of books; to meet a first grade requirement, about fifty dollars for books, a metal jacket around the stove, and a Babcock milk-tester was required. Our school met all of these requirements and therefore became a first-grade school. In order to raise the necessary amount of funds, pie socials, box socials, and cake walks were held. Occasionally, plays or other types of entertainment were sponsored by the school.\n\nNo school books, paper, pencils, pens, ink, or other supplies were paid for by the board of education. However, the board did supply chalk, fire shovels, water pails, etc. The first blackboard erasers were made from rectangular pad cut from the top of felt boots.\n\nThe three R's - readin', ritin', and rithmetic - were considered the most important part of the elementary curriculum. McGuffey's readers from one to six were the standard text books in reading until year about 1912 when the\n\nAldine Reader System was introduced into our school system. Milne's Arithmetic, Rigdon's and Harvey' Grammars, Overton's Physiology, Montgomery's American History, Irish's Orthography, McGuffey's Spellers were in common usage.\n\nGeography and Penmanship were also taught. For the more advanced students Royer's Mental Arithmetic and Ray's Arithmetic and Algebra were used.\n\nPage 31\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nSlater were in common use to solve the problem, in arithmetic. A single slate could be purchased at any store for ten cents or the price of a dozen egg,. A slate pencil cost two for a cent. New slate pencil was about four inches long. Since these pencils were very fragile, the upper half was wrapped with barber pole color, thin paper to prevent them from breaking. One did not really need two pencils since a new pencil rarely survived one day's use. It was usually dropped on the floor and when it was retrieved. there were three or four pieces - all usable. When a slate pencil was less than an inch long, it was usually tossed into the coal bucket which also served as a waste paper basket. It should be stated here that when a slate was covered with figures or writing, they were removed by spitting on the slate and wiping it with the heal of the hand. If a figure was wrong, it could be removed by rubbing it with a forefinger. The girls, who were a little more particular than we were, kept a damp cloth in the desk with which to clean the slates. One might add, that the cloth, after a few days, developed a bad case of halitoris.\n\nThe only school buildings now standing are Mechanicsburg. located at Aitch, Ohio (Mechanicsburg. OH.) and Harmony at Dog Skin Run.\n\nLYMAN TEACHERS -\n\nAs nearly as can be ascertained, the following list of teachers are listed in chronological order:\n\nThe following information was furnished by Mrs. Hugh Herndon. It was taken from a school, souvenir given to the pupils by the teacher, Mr. Charles Saffle, at the close of the school session 1908-1909.\n\nWritten by I. M. Straight\n\nPage 32\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nBoard members:\n\nPLAINVIEW CENTENNIAL\n\nWritten by F. S. Hogue\n\nIn passing, I wish to note only one vivid recollection of Mr. West. He recalls as of yesterday when Thomas Hall stopped at their cabin one bitterly cold night. He had secured a furlough to visit his sick daughter. She was buried before he reached home. Mr. Hall gave young Oliver the striped candy (a rarity in those days) which he had brought for his sick daughter. Mr. Hall returned to the war and was never heard from by anyone here again. He was reported missing after a battle. It was rumored that he had been seen in Andersonville prison shortly before the close of the war but this was never\n\nverified. The Mr. Hall mentioned here was the grandfather of Edgar Hall of Woodsfield, and an uncle of McClellan Cox. This incident brings close home to us the sentiment which inspired the erection of the tomb for the Unknown Soldier.\n\nThree church buildings have been built in this community. The United Brethren on what is now the Charles Yerian farm. It was later used by the Church of Christ people. Some of the original building, which was constructed of round logs may still be seen. The Baptists had a log building where Roger Briggs now lives. A sadly neglected graveyard, mute\n\nevidence of man's forgetfulness, is all that now remains. The present Church of Christ building was erected in 1901. It has been lately renovated and is being used for services by a large congregation. A noteworthy fact brought out in the service of the Lord's Day was that no time in the history of this congregation has any means of financing ever been used except the contribution of the morning Lord's Day service. From the dedication of the building in 1901 until the death of Dias Givens in 1934, this congregation was under the eldership of Oliver West, John Thomas, and Dias Givens. Dias\n\nfor a time was a teacher in the public schools but was more widely known as a singing teacher. Throughout most of his life he had charge of the Church singing and also the music for the various community affairs. The community suffered a severe loss by his passing. His influence will endure no one knows how long.\n\nThe first Plainview school was erected about the year of 1840, about a 150 yards east of the present church building. It was constructed of round logs, heated by an open fireplace, the fuel for which was secured by the teacher and larger boys from the nearby woods. The seats were logs split in halves into which wooden pegs were driven. The writing materials consisted of goose quill pens and homemade ink. A few specimens of the penmanship of that time will be on display as will also an original teacher's certificate and covenant (?) granted to Thomas West, the last teacher in this building in the year 1849. The winter term lasted three months from December to March first. Teacher, were paid about sixteen dollars per month, partly in currency but mostly in some product from the home or the field. Mr. West will display parts of an original account book kept by his father by which such payments were made. Teachers also frequently received a part of their salary by boarding among the patrons.\n\nThe curriculum of the school was confined almost entirely to the three R's, although some of the more advanced teachers taught Orthography, Geography, Algebra, and English.\n\nPage 33\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nMr. West will display a remarkable example of letter writing by the hand of Alexander Campbell to Thomas \" * was built about a hundred feet west of the building now in use. Thomas West became the first teacher and continued to serve as such for a period of seven years. In 1893 the building was removed, the material being used for the Edington house. The present building was erected the same year. The enrollment in the school reached its highest peak about 1898 while Archie Griffith was the teacher, with 75 attending that year. The lowest enrollment in its history was eighteen\n\nin the year 1909. There are thirty-one enrolled at present.\n\nWhile a few of the former students of Plainview may be regarded as outstanding successes in business or the professions, we are prouder of the great number of just plain, wholesome, everyday citizens who have attended our school. One thing which the writer regards with pride is that so far as he can learn, no former pupil of Plainview has ever been convicted of a major crime.\n\nFollowing is a list of teachers, submitted by Grandpa and Grandma West, in which they have attempted to name the teachers in order of service since 1849: Thomas West, Mr. Adams, Mr. Smith, Lucy Reed, Rebecca Bailey, Susan Waiters, Patrick Dougherty, Enoch Martin, Chris Truex, (the brother of Aunt Lib), Alanson Martin, (father of Charles), Ursula Mason, George Bothwell, Matthew Dougherty, Amanda Smith, Nan Reed, Sally Sinclair, Margaret West (sister of Oliver), Solomon Barnard, Elizabeth Jane Truex, (aunt of Mrs. Givens).

The last named teacher is now serving his 18th year as teacher in our school.\n\nI cannot close this brief account of our people without mentioning an unusual discovery of a few weeks ago. Grandpa West and his grandson Charles were digging the post holes near the school house. In the bottom of one of the holes they observed an object that looked strangely out of place. Upon securing the same they found it to be what we believe is a Spanish coin. The date is 1781. Inscribed thereon are the words \"Hispanio and Carolus III. Now you tell one.\n\nWe hope that you, our neighbors of Plainview, may derive some of the pleasure from reading this account that we have felt in compiling the same. If our county papers will kindly publish it, put it away in your strong box, and some of your grandchildren may sometime spend a few leisure moments in contemplation of just who were the members of the Centennial Committee.\n\n* The article from which the above was copied was obliterated at this point.\n\n(This article appeared in THE SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY, Thursday, November 20, 1937).\n\nSubmitted by Gladys Cox\n\nPage 34\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nSALEM TOWNSHIP\n\nWALTON SCHOOL - was erected about 2 miles north of Clarington along State Route 7. The ground is now owned by the North American Coal Company. This was the first school to be consolidated with the Clarington Village School in Salem Township. The small cemetery which was located near the school has also been removed.\n\nVALLEY - is one of the few one room country schools yet standing on its original foundation. It is located about 2 miles south of Clarington along State Route 7 at the mouth of Opossum Creek. This building was purchased by the Methodists of the community and used as a church until recently when the coal company purchased most of the land in the community and the residents moved away.\n\nLIBERTY - stood on the banks of Sunfish Creek about midway between Clarington and Cameron on the Arnold Stauffer farm. Rutter Cemetery is close by. This school closed with the building of Route 78 and the students were taken to Clarington. The farm is now owned by Mrs. Mildred Stauffer who was elementary supervisor in this county for several years.\n\nCAIN - was located where county Roads C64 and C64A converge on land now owned by Joe Circosta. Classes were discontinued there about 1933 and the building sold to Joe Bauer of Powhatan who converted it into a dwelling and still stands at Powhatan.\n\nDAISY - was the last school of its type built in Salem Township. It was erected 1888 by Fred Dietrich with Ernest Case being the first teacher. The last teacher there was H. E. Kurtzman in 1933. Take Township Road 187 about one half mile up Negro Run to locate the site where the last to be built and among the last to go once stood. The location is now a part of the farm owned by the late James Ravencratt.\n\nHINTON - was located on what is now C26 and 1½ miles from Oak Store on what we commonly refer to as Beautiful Ridge. Mr. and Mrs. Huskey are now the owners of the original site.\n\nKLEBE - Today we take the pupil to the school. Our forefathers had another solution \"take the school to the pupil\". It first stood on the John Kreiger farm and after a few years was moved about 1½ miles farther west on a part of th· Christ Klebe Farm. Roy Kimpel who was later to become the principal of Clarington High School and eventually became associated with the Warren Sanitary Dairy of Warren. Ohio was the last teacher there. 1920 is believed to be the date of closing. The spot can be reached by taking C39. Pete Kimberly now owns the land.\n\nCASE - The Don Miracle home now occupies the spot on which this school once stood. It is about IX mile, from Clarington on Route 556. J. Mack Gamble taught the last term of school there in 1933.\n\nSYKES - Sykes School was located on Sykes Ridge Road, now C4 on the Lew Sykes Farm. This was the first school building along this ridge road and stood about 3 miles from Clarington. The Sykes Cemetery which is still there was adjoining. Dorothy Ischy is now the owner of the land on which it once stood.\n\nBONAR - This was the second school on the ridge as you came from Clarington about 4 ½ miles from Clarington. This building was sold in 1938 and the late Dr. C. A. Smith used the materials for building a tool shed which still stands in the village of Clarington. C4 passes the site where it once stood and Glen Feisley now owns the land.\n\nOK or OAK - Apparently this school was referred to by both terms. It too was on C4 and about 6 miles from Clarington. This was the third school on this ridge as you traveled from Clarington toward Woodsfield. Oak Store which is nearby will mark the spot where this building stood.\n\nAccording to the information given in Hardesty Atlas the first school in Monroe County was taught by Mitchel Atkinson about 2 miles north of Clarington. This would be near the spot where the Walton School once stood on land now owned by the North American Coal Co. This was in the year of 1804-5, however, no school was built at that time, the school apparently was held in a privately owned building.\n\nThe first school to be built was on the Cochran Farm near the mouth of Negro Run on land now owned by Harry Miller. This apparently was built about 1810 or 1811.\n\nWritten by Lester C.

The Public School became the corner stone of each of seven social communities. The citizens of Summit Township determined to make available to their children the education their parents had missed. Thus, it was fundamental that a school-house should be one of the first public conveniences in the neighborhood. The principle prevailed that where a few children could be gathered together, a school was essential as a medium for providing education opportunities.\n\nBack in 1850, transportation and communication systems were not yet highly developed, so it was necessary to establish seven school districts within Summit Township. At a site along the old OR&W Railroad, where the hills became less protuberant and more rolling, the village of Lewisville began to grow. In Lewisville, the first school-house was located at the intersection of old Main and Back Streets. The building was a frame structure erected from timbers harvested in the surrounding community. The roof was slate imported by railroad. This school-house served the educational needs of Lewisville until 1911, when a new sch"
