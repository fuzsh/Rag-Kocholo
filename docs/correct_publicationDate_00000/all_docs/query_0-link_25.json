        "text": "Great story\n\nI think this is book closest to the movie I, Robot. The underlying reason is different and there are other differences as well. Still a great story.\n\nhard to stop once started.\n\nThis was my first audio book, and I am now hooked. I have red this book a few times (its one of my favorites) and the novelty of listening to it be read to me is just plain fun. On to the next in the series :-). note, narrator was wonderful, but does not do a female voice well... still that sort of made it fun also.\n\nThis could have went really bad...\n\nWould you consider the audio edition of The Caves of Steel to be better than the print version?\n\nDoubtful, do to the great narration. Even the female characters were very easy to listen to.\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of The Caves of Steel?\n\nThe who-dun-it aspect of the story.\n\nWhat does William Dufris bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nGruff, and Elegance. The back and forth between the two lead characters, and others in the room sometime, take on lives of their own. You really feel like you are observing a conversation between living, breathing, individuals with their own backgrounds.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nYeah, the mystery of the story kept me going.\n\nA stroke of genius.\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to The Caves of Steel the most enjoyable?\n\nThis book is a great view into the future full of sociological observation and speculation. All this is cleverly wrapped in to a detective story that keep you on the edge of you guessing. The characters are well motivated and there is never a lack of flow. As you follow along the ideas and reasoning Asimov is always a step ahead of you. He anticipating anything you might say in protest and dismantles your arguments in this mental fencing of a novel.\n\nthe beginning of the foundation story\n\nI have always loved Asimov's books. And though this story and the one that follows isn't officially part of the Foundation series, it where the story really begins. Unfortunately a very believable future!\n\nThe narrator is good except\n\nThe way he voices women and young children is extremely grating. I can’t really describe it, but listening to him voice women or children just sounds unpleasant to listen too\n\nVery high production quality\n\nThe voices were great. It helps that the story is excellent, but the vocals were well done. Worth the listen. Moving on to the next.\n\nFun classic Asimov\n\nIt is a fun classic stitch. One must understand that what what may have been futuristic then, is now out dated. Overall a a very enjoyable story.\n\nclassic science fiction, well read\n\nSome of the language and social ideas are very dated, but the murder mystery is interesting and the visions if the future from that time are fascinating to hear."
