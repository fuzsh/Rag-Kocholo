        "text": "Stronghold Slayer CaveReleased23 January 2014 (Update)MembersYesFloorsOneLocationGnome EmpireInhabitantsVariesMusicBeneath the StrongholdMapAdvanced dataTypedungeon\n\nThe Stronghold Slayer Cave, also known as the Stronghold Slayer Dungeon, is a dungeon located beneath the Tree Gnome Stronghold. It contains a small variety of monsters that are commonly assigned to players. The cave entrance is located next to Nieve (or Steve, after the events of Monkey Madness II).\n\nAnyone can enter the dungeon, but players can only attack the slayer monster they were assigned, and only while the task has not been completed. The Slayer ring can teleport players to the entrance of the cave. A dwarf multicannon can be used in the dungeon.\n\nThere is a shortcut in the dungeon requiring 72 Agility (can be boosted) to use. This allows the player to reach aberrant spectres and ankous quicker. It may be used to exit the dungeon faster, but doing so without the required Agility level deals up to 12 damage.\n\nLocation[edit | edit source]\n\nThe entrance to the Stronghold Slayer Cave is located in the Gnome Stronghold near Nieve, who is located just south-west of the Spirit Tree. (Maplink)\n\nThere are various ways to get there:\n\nUse a Slayer ring to teleport directly to the entrance by Nieve.\n\nUse the gnome glider to Ta Quir Priw, which will take you to the Grand Tree. Exit the Grand Tree and run south-west to the entrance.\n\nUse the spirit tree to the Gnome Stronghold and run south-west.\n\nUse the necklace of passage to Teleport to 'Outpost' and then run north-east.\n\nUse the royal seed pod to Teleport to the Grand Tree, then run south-west.\n\nMonsters[edit | edit source]\n\nMonsters that can be found in the Stronghold Slayer Cave include:\n\nMonster Image Combat level Slayer level Slayer XP Quantity Aberrant spectre 96 60 90 13 Ankou 75, 82, 86 1 60, 65, 70 8 Bloodveld 76 50 120 12 Fire giant 86 1 111 12 Hellhound 122 1 116 13\n\nDevelopment history[edit | edit source]\n\nA slayer dungeon containing a large variety of monsters where players can only attack their assigned slayer target was proposed in the Slayer & Christmas Dev Blog on 15 November 2013. The dungeon was polled in Content Poll #13 and passed by 86.6%.\n\nThe cave was released on 23 January 2014, where it housed many common slayer monsters such as metal dragons, abyssal demons, and kalphites. However, the cave kraken lake was empty, as development of the slayer monster was not yet complete. This was added in an update a week later. The cave would go on to receive several more additions:\n\n10 April 2014 - Smoke devils and the Kraken boss were added.\n\n6 November 2014 - Gargoyles were added.\n\n17 September 2015 - Black demons, blue dragons, and more black dragons were added.\n\nThe south-east area of the cave, where bloodvelds, hellhounds, and aberrant spectres could be found.\n\nThe south-east area of the cave, where waterfiends, abyssal demons, and nechryael could be found.\n\nThe volcanic area of the cave, where fire giants and various dragons could be found.\n\nA kalphite habitat. The dead entomologist, Buggie, who brought them there, can be seen in the back.\n\nThe cave kraken lake, where many of them thrived.\n\nA player fights a nuclear smoke devil while defending themselves against a horde of smoke devils.\n\nThe westernmost area of the cave, where black demons, blue dragons, and black dragons could be found.\n\nA section of the Underground pass was visible from the south-east area of the cave.\n\nEventually, players began to voice concerns on the sheer amount of slayer assignments that they found themselves doing in the Stronghold Slayer Cave, due to its close proximity to a bank and convenient location, taking away the appeal of the variety the Slayer skill offers, the monotony of grinding in the same location, and the lack of exploring the game world as players train.\n\nPlayers also complained that many of the monsters found there do not appear to be native to the area. In addition, the geography of the cave wildly varied, with damp caves on the east and lava lakes a small walk west, breaking the sense of immersion. Additional concerns included the excessively large size of the cave, which was large enough to fit Falador, Varrock, and everything between them.\n\nIn response, the Old School team wrote a Developer Blog, aiming to bring back the variety and diversity of where players train Slayer by moving some creatures out of the Stronghold Slayer Cave, and placing them into a number other new dungeons where appropriate (still requiring the appropriate slayer assignment to attack them). The cave's splitting was polled in Content Poll #51 and passed by 89.6%.\n\nAs a result, the cave was completely remapped on 27 April 2017, leaving only bloodvelds, hellhounds, aberrant spectres, ankou, and fire giants behind. The cave became nearly one-fifth its original size, with the following new areas introduced with monsters relocated to them:\n\nGreater and black demons were relocated to the new Chasm of Fire in Shayzien.\n\nBlack dragons, their babies, and blue dragons were relocated to a new upper level within Taverley Dungeon.\n\nGargoyles, nechryael, and abyssal demons were relocated to the new basement within the Slayer Tower.\n\nThe metal dragons were relocated to a new cave west of the pre-existing cave that housed iron and steel dragons in the Brimhaven Dungeon.\n\nThe kalphites were moved to the new Kalphite Cave east of the Shantay Pass.\n\nThe smoke devils were moved to the new Smoke Devil Dungeon south of Castle Wars.\n\nThe waterfiends and cave kraken were moved to the new Kraken Cove south-west of the Piscatoris Fishing Colony.\n\nChanges[edit | edit source]"
