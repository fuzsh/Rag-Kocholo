        "text": "by Gary Romeo\n\nI came across this letter from the publishers of The Fifth Book of Junior Authors & Illustrators requesting a short biography from L. Sprague de Camp for his inclusion in this forthcoming book. I once had a copy of More Junior Authors (1963) and remembered that Robert Heinlein had a nice write-up in that volume. I looked forward to seeing Sprague’s entry in this edition.\n\nFully expecting to see Sprague’s inclusion in this Fifth book, I ordered an inexpensive copy from Abebooks. (The copy on Amazon was a costly $95, it pays to shop around!) A few days later I received the book and was hugely disappointed when the entry did not appear. (Later I learned the book was available free online, it pays to search around!)\n\nLuckily, I do have a copy of the two-page short biography that Sprague prepared for this book. Why he was not included in the final product is not a big puzzle. Sprague (other than a few of his non-fiction science books and one SF anthology) did not really often write for “juniors.” His science-fiction and fantasy books (by himself or with Flecther Pratt, Robert E. Howard, and Lin Carter) often have sexual scenes and almost always have violence. While adolescents read those (I sure did) they are NOT placed in the Juvenile or Young Adult section of the bookstore. Below is de Camp’s self-written short biography. It is interesting what he has chosen to highlight. (I believe he made a mistake in not emphasizing specific books that could be considered juvenile related. Mentioning his work with Golden Press, the Darwin biography (co-written with Catherine Crook de Camp), and Tales Beyond Time (a SF anthology geared toward young readers) all certainly deserved to be brought up in this instance.\n\nFor those who wish to know how the entries that made the final cut look in print, I’m reproducing the Robert Heinlein entry from More Junior Authors and the Isaac Asimov entry from the Third Book of Junior Authors:\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nThe 1960s were turbulent times…\n\nTo be honest, I really don’t know if they were any more turbulent than any other time in history. But since I was alive back then I do remember some things. Chiefly I remember the struggle for “Civil Rights” and opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nThe science fiction community was not immune to thinking about these things. I came across this ad that was placed in various SF publications in the middle of 1968:\n\nAs you can see from the ad, Sprague de Camp and Isaac Asimov were on different sides of the issue. This was the not first time that they disagreed about the war. Sprague wrote a letter to The New York Times that was published on February 10, 1968.\n\nIsaac Asimov, arguably de Camp’s closest friend in the SF community, sent de Camp a letter in response.\n\nAsimov continues in the letter:\n\n“It seemed necessary to me for the honor of the fraternity of science fiction writers to write a letter expressing a contrary point of view. The letter was short and was of course not vituperative or anything like that.\n\n“Here is what I had to say:\n\n“Mr. L. Sprague de Camp in his letter of February 12 takes a legalistic view of General Loan’s shooting of a Vietcong captive and that, unfortunately, is inadequate. The sad fact is this. Rightly or wrongly, the United States has chosen to commit itself to the role of Good Guy and cast the various Communist nations in the world as Bad Guys. This can be a very effective role for us, but it does wish upon us the onerous chore of having to act like a Good Guy. When we behave badly, it wins us no points to say that this is legal and that the other fellow is just as bad, since our whole case is that the other fellow is worse than we are, not merely just as bad. We will undoubtedly win the Vietnam War in the sense that we will prove that we are militarily stronger than the North Vietnamese, a point that is scarcely in question. We may also end up with a Soviet Union acting as the leader of what will be calling itself the “Free World” with ourselves cast as Bad Guy. That may have the charm of novelty, but no other advantage that I can see.”\n\nAs far as I know, The New York Times, never printed Asimov’s response. But de Camp would not have taken offense if they had. De Camp gave his friend an immediate response:\n\nI quote from these letters to make a point about the way friends should handle differences of opinion. I certainty do not wish to re-argue opinions about the Vietnam War! But, as back then, I see political issues potentially dividing friends and fervently wish that we could emulate the level-headiness of these two science fiction greats.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nIn L. Sprague de Camp’s autobiography, Time and Chance (Donald M. Grant, 1996), he recounts how in early 1942, he applied for a commission in the United States Naval Reserve. A friend of Robert Heinlein’s, A. B. Scoles was a Lieutenant-Commander and director of the Aeronautical Materials Laboratory of the Naval Aircraft Factory at the Philadelphia Naval Base. Scoles had the idea of recruiting science fiction writers to work at his Materials Laboratory.\n\nSprague was given his naval commission, while Heinlein and Isaac Asimov were employed as civilians. De Camp fictionalized some of his experience working there into his novel The Arrows of Hercules (Doubleday, 1965) which he dedicated “To Isaac Asimov and Bob Heinlein, in memory of our own Ortygian days.” De Camp’s novel was about the invention of the catapult in 399 B. C. Dionysios’ “materials laboratory” was on the Greek island of Ortygia.\n\nThe three men remained friends and each continued their writing careers. Heinlein and Asimov’s names are now synonymous with science fiction. De Camp’s highlights consist more of historical fiction (the aforementioned The Arrows of Hercules among others) alternate futures (Lest Darkness Fall, The Wheels of If), and fantasy (the Harold Shea stories written with Fletcher Pratt and his stewardship of Robert E. Howard’s Conan).\n\nDe Camp and Heinlein often corresponded by postal mail. In 1951, after discovering the greatness that is Conan the Conqueror, de Camp wrote to Heinlein first discussing personal matters and later giving him an update on their mutual friend and colleague, John D. Clark:\n\nFor me, de Camp saying: “once I start one of the damned things I can’t put it down” overrides the “oafish superman” comment but your mileage may vary. In any event de Camp overcame any reservations he had about Robert E. Howard and became, in Michael Moorcock’s words, “Howard’s greatest publicist and supporter.”\n\nAlso, for proper context, we need to consider that de Camp’s introduction to Howard, The Hour of the Dragon AKA Conan the Conqueror does have its flaws. Steve Dilks, sword & sorcery author and administrator of several REH-oriented Facebook pages, writes in a Goodreads review of the book: “As for the novel itself though, I risk losing my Conan fan club card by announcing that this is not Howard at his best. There are some well written passages but overall, it lacks atmosphere and relies too much on coincidence instead of a proper plot machination. Conan vanquishes everything that comes across his path all too easily.”\n\nAnd, of course, de Camp may have been purposely understating his enjoyment of pulp fiction due to Heinlein’s prominence as the top SF writer who had “made the slicks.” Heinlein was SF. His books, still to this day, are regularly available in bookstores. Heinlein was a man to defer to – then and now. And de Camp’s other friend, Isaac Asimov, a close second in being the author who defines SF was no fan of Sword & Sorcery. When Asimov was the editor of the science fiction magazine that bears his name, he wrote an article about why he dislikes Sword & Sorcery. First published in Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine, January 1985 and reprinted in Asimov’s Galaxy: Reflections on SF (1989), and later Magic (1996). The basic thesis is that S&S typically values brawn over brain.\n\nAsimov wrote his “Black Widowers” series based on the real-life “Trap Door Spiders” which was a loose confederation of writers who met for dinner at various places. In the story “Northwestward” when the men are talking about the “Superman” ideal, the de Camp character, Geoffrey Avalon mentions, “Even half a century ago, we had the development of Conan by Robert E. Howard, as a modern legend. These were all far stronger than we puny fellows are, but they were not godlike. […].” Whatever reservations de Camp may have had in the beginning in extolling the virtues of REH and Conan were now overcome. De Camp was clearly known as the REH/Conan fan among his peers.\n\nHeinlein, Asimov, and de Camp traveled in the same circles. All knew George Scithers, editor and publisher of the premiere REH/Conan fan magazine, Amra. According to author Darrell Schweitzer, “Heinlein wrote [Glory Road] when George Scithers suggested he couldn’t write Sword & Sorcery. It was more or less a dare.”\n\nGlory Road first appeared in serialized form starting in the July 1963 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It quickly appeared in hardcover. The book is dedicated “For George H. Scithers and the regular patrons of the Terminus, Owlswick, & Ft. Mudge Electrick Street Railway.” Which means the readers of Amra. Which is nice! Amra is not always given the respect it is due as the first magazine dedicated to REH and Conan.\n\nThere is no question that Heinlein is a talented writer. Stranger in a Strange Land and Starship Troopers are modern classics. His short story “Jerry Was a Man” is prescient in a true to life way. Animal Rights groups have initiated court cases that almost exactly mimic that story.\n\nSeveral will protest that Glory Road is not sword & sorcery; but it does fit the overall format of heroic fantasy which arguably only differs from Sword & Sorcery in subjective ways. (The novel was written in 1962, the hard divisions between SF, Fantasy, Sword & Planet, Heroic Fantasy, Sword & Sorcery, etc. were not as defined then.) The introduction in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction clearly stresses the favorite S&S tropes: adventure, broadswords, and a lovely woman.\n\nThe plot (which certainly sounds more like heroic fantasy than SF) has the hero, a Vietnam war vet, answering a newspaper ad that leads him to the adventure with the beautiful heroine, Star. They begin a quest for an Egg that contains knowledge that Star wants. There is adventure but it never grabbed me. After their quest is completed our hero is bored. He comes back home to Earth, begins to doubt the adventure ever happened and places a newspaper ad that his former adventure companion, Rufo (a sort of Moonglum to his Elric) sees and the novel ends with our hero given another chance to travel the Glory Road. “Got any dragons you need killed?”\n\nAccording to Heinlein biographer, William H. Patterson Jr., “The apparatus of wizards and aristocrats didn’t much appeal to Heinlein’s democratic soul. Instead he made Glory Road a kind of “gay deceiver.” Los Angeles SF fan Walt Liebscher had coined the term to describe fantastic stories that had mundane explanations – dreams, most often. The “fantasy” elements of Heinlein’s new story would be high-level technology, applied mathematics mostly, and literary psychology , so that the fantasy would be science fiction in masquerade.” The novel was started as The Power and the Glory on April 12, 1962. It was changed to Glory Road when published.\n\nThe novel is told in the first person in a breezy somewhat smart-aleck way that is almost fun at first but quickly wore on me. There is humor but I thought it more sophomoric than incisive. Lines like “I was twenty-one but couldn’t figure out which party to vote against” are funny but display more cynicism than I personally like. Conan is name-checked and another weak joke (as they begin their journey), “don’t make a hobbit of it” references Tolkein of course. Written in 1962 it does reference a lot of people and products of the time: Booth Tarkington, Hugh Hefner, Ronson Lighters. But I had a hard time enjoying the novel even with the nostalgia from my childhood era.\n\nAs I should never be the final arbiter of any opinion and in the interest of fairness, I reproduce from Wikipedia, some other opinions of the novel: Samuel R. Delany called the novel “endlessly fascinating” and said that it “maintains a delicacy, a bravura, and a joy”. The novel’s second half has been praised as intriguing, as it goes into what happens after a typical hero’s journey is finished. Oscar is married to a ruler in a situation that should be “happily ever after” and the end of many works, yet the novel continues rather than stops: having nothing to do and nothing new to conquer is itself a struggle for Oscar. A review at SF Site by Peter D. Tillman thought the book was okay, but felt it had aged poorly in parts. While Tillman acknowledged loving the book while younger and it making a good “pulp” read, he felt that it wasted too much time on Heinlein’s personal hang-ups and rants, and that the relationship between Oscar and Star was too much puerile wish-fulfillment. Glory Road was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1964, losing to Way Station by Clifford D. Simak.\n\nOf these three SF greats only de Camp really understood the appeal of Sword & Sorcery. Heinlein and Asimov are still on the Barnes & Noble shelves but sadly, for me anyway, de Camp (and the Lancer/Ace Conan series) is not. De Camp’s detour into Sword & Sorcery overrode his SF career but it was clearly a genre he loved and flourished in for a good while. Conan pastiche (and you can credit or blame de Camp as you wish) is still a thing though, with S. M. Stirling’s Blood of the Serpent being available at the local B&N.\n\nAs a Sword & Sorcery fan I’m glad de Camp made that detour.\n\nby Phil Sawyer\n\nI have just finished reading this fun 416 page novel that came out in 2011. The author’s premise is that Sprague and Asimov and Heinlein were involved in all sorts of adventures and derring-dos while stationed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in WW2. The book is quite a roller coaster ride. Here goes:\n\n(1.): Sprague is introduced on page #32 where he first meets Asimov at the Navy Yard. The author is using a little artistic license as they knew each other before the war.\n\n(2.): On page #39 Heinlein is asking John Campbell about Sprague. Again, Heinlein knew Sprague before the war.\n\n(3.): On page #53 Asimov’s then wife Gertrude meets Catherine de Camp. She thinks Catherine is the most beautiful woman she has ever seen outside of the movies. She finds Catherine very intimidating.\n\n(4.): In the novel Isaac and Gertrude Asimov quarrel a lot. Heinlein’s wife is descending into alcoholic madness and L. Ron Hubbard has already left his first wife and brood of children. Of the main characters, only the de Camps are shown as happily married.\n\n(5.): The plot involves the Nazis trying to get their hands on a deadly weapon that was designed earlier by Tesla. Additionally, the U.S. government is very suspicious of these super smart people. Campbell has published a story about an atomic bomb that seems too close for comfort. But then again, is it really the Nazis they are battling against?\n\n(6.): Robert Heinlein is the leader of our brave band. The action takes place on the East Coast as well as the South Pacific and the Aleutian Islands.\n\n(7.): Guest characters include Albert Einstein, John Campbell, Lester Dent and his beautiful wife, Walter Gibson, the author of ” The Shadow” and of course Jack Parsons, the rocket designing occultist. There are many more people I have forgotten to list. It’s quite a cast!\n\n(8.): Sprague is portrayed as brave, smart and very knowledgeable but I wish the author could have somehow shown how much charisma Sprague had and how pleasurable it was to know him.\n\n(9.): L. Ron Hubbard is referred to as ” Crazy Ron” by Campbell but the author is clearly fascinated by Hubbard. You can see Hubbard piecing together thoughts on his new religion.\n\n(10.): At the end of the novel you have L. Ron Hubbard meeting Richard Feynman in a bar and Hubbard telling Feynman that Jack Parsons is “yesterdays news.”\n\nI don’t want to give away the plot. You need to read the novel! I will say that when he was at Cal Tech Sprague was on the fencing team and became a pretty fair fencer. I was hoping that the author would have Sprague get his hands on a sword or Bowie Knife and skewer a few villains, but alas! No such luck!\n\nOn page #412 Campbell and Hubbard are discussing Asimov in the Army and we are told that Asimov ” tested high in intelligence and low in physical condition.” Asimov in the novel is portrayed, in my opinion, as kind of wimpy. Very non physical. But there was another side to him!\n\nThis is one of Sprague’s very favorite Asimov stories which I will repeat for our Fellowship:\n\nIsaac Asimov never liked the military. It always rubbed him the wrong way. He at best saw the military as a necessary evil. And Asimov saw himself as a big lovable teddy bear and a totally non threatening man. I remember him writing about not liking to write about Clint Eastwood style “galoots.”\n\nSo imagine everybody’s shock when Asimov arrived at Boot Camp. The Army discovered that Asimov was an absolutely DEADLY infantry combat soldier.\n\nSprague told me that Asimov was an ” amazingly” accurate shot with the M1 Garand, the BAR, the Tommy gun, the .45 caliber pistol, and the M1 carbine. He instinctively knew when to shoot and when not to shoot. He instinctively knew how to take cover, and how to use dead ground. In Sprague’s words they discovered that Asimov was a “combination of Jim Bowie, John Wesley Hardin, and Audie Murphy.” It turned out that Asimov was a “natural warrior.”\n\nIsaac Asimov was EXTREMELY embarrassed to find this out about himself. Sprague was one of the few people he told this to. He tried to get Sprague to promise never to reveal this to anyone but it was just too good a story so Sprague couldn’t make himself promise. Sprague refers to this obliquely in his autobiography.\n\nOur psyches and male egos are interesting. Any or all of the guys at my power lifting gym would just LOVE to let you know how bad ass they were. Most of the guys I know would boast until they were blue in the face about their martial prowess. Yet Asimov was embarrassed by his martial skills and did not want anyone to know about what an excellent soldier he was! Being a living breathing Terminator was not at all how he saw himself!\n\nBe sure to read this book! You will enjoy it! I DO wonder what Sprague and Catherine would have thought about this adventure!\n\nYours in Crom\n\nBrian Kunde adds: Re: (7), additional guest characters include Albert Einstein, Ray Bradbury, Cleve Cartmill, Hugh B. Cave, Judith Merril, Norvell Page, Frederik Pohl, Jimmy Stewart, and Kurt Vonnegut. I loved this book, but ground my teeth over various inaccuracies, especially in light of the author’s vaunted historical research. There were a fair number in addition to those you mentioned, many of which could be avoided had he delved a little deeper into the Asimov and de Camp autobiographies.\n\nPhil Sawyer responded: Affirm. I think or guess he wrote this book in a hurry. I GUESS that the author was a tiny bit condescending. I think that he thought that sloppy research was okay for “pulp writing.” Actually Sprague and Asimov and Heinlein and many other pulp writers did a LOT of research. Oh, well. It’s still a fun read."
