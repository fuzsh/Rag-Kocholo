Octavo (22cm.); publisher's cloth in blue dust jacket designed by Ruth Ray, red topstain; 224pp. Ex-Berkshire Athenæum with their markings; subsequently the volume shows signs of exceedingly heavy use, boards and jacket extremities rubbed with loss of both along bottom margin of rear cover, spine cocked, old dirty glue residue to both endpapers, toning and soil to extremities occasionally affecting textblock. A Good at the very best copy of an otherwise quite desirable book, the first in Asimov's Robot series.\n\n[Currey p. 16]."
