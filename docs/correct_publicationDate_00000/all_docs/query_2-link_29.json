        "text": "1920-1992\n\n\"If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives, and not the pattern of their words. I think He would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.\"\n\nBirthplace\n\nPetrovichi, Russia\n\nEducation\n\nColumbia University, US\n\nOther jobs\n\nServed in US army; became a chemistry professor.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThough in his books he travelled to the stars, he refused to fly in planes.\n\nCritical verdict\n\nHe was never seen as more than a genre writer, and an embarrassingly prolific one, at that - Asimov wrote or edited more than 500 volumes and an estimated 90,000 letters or postcards. He has works in every major category of the Dewey Decimal System except Philosophy. Accepted as one of the greatest of genre writers, and provided for his following entirely new, vast and coherent mental universes to inhabit.\n\nRecommended works\n\nI, Robot: the first classics of the Robot series.\n\nÂ·\n\nInfluences\n\nKarel Capek's RUR (1920, play; 1938, TV) coined the term \"robot\".\n\nNow read on\n\nIf you're sure you've finished the Asimov oeuvre (including his guides to Shakespeare, science, and the Bible), his sci-fi stablemates, Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, provide a logical progression. Greg Bear and Patricia Anthony will also appeal.\n\nAdaptations\n\nAsimov himself was \"special science consultant\" on Star Trek: The Motion Picture, but a surprisingly small number of his novels and stories have been filmed. The Will Smith vehicle I, Robot (2004) bears little semblance to Asimov's original novel, and is subject to intense criticism from Asimov fans. His novella The Positronic Man inspired the box office flop Bicentennial Man (1999).\n\nRecommended biography\n\nAs befits such a prolific writer, Asimov produced several autobiographical works, including In Joy Still Felt and In Memory Still Green. His final memoir, I, Asimov, is the most confessional: an enthusiastic monologue on science, writing and life."
