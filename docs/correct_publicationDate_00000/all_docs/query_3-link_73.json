        "text": "This futuristic, dystopian mystery novel truly exhibits Asimovâ€™s knack for writing about robots and how he envisioned humans would progress in relation to improving technology. Asimov paints a bleak and vast world where humans live in squalor in enclosed city units, with access to the outside world being sacrificed for efficiency. This book spends some time ridiculing our social hierarchy by showing an extreme example in the made up city units before switching over into the mystery genre for the plot. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery book full of twists and turns that leave you at the edge of your seat and craving an explanation. I truly enjoyed this book a lot and ended up binge reading it in two nights because I needed to know what would happen next. I can guarantee that if you pick up this book with an open mind and do not get bored by some of its less entertaining parts, you will find a fascinating world of technology and mystery that you will be very invested in til the end."
