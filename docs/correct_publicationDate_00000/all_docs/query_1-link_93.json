        "text": "Quick Links\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom is the twentieth main installment in The Legend of Zelda series. It was released for the Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023.\n\nPlot[]\n\nAn unknown period of time after the events of Breath of the Wild, Link and Zelda are exploring a secret passage hidden beneath Hyrule Castle. Although King Rhoam had warned Zelda in the past that not even the royal family was to go there, she believes that what lies beneath is connected to the strange phenomena spreading throughout Hyrule, referred to as \"Gloom\". As they travel, they find ancient ruins that Zelda identifies as being of Zonai origin. They eventually find a mural depicting a great war against a being usually referred to as \"The Demon King\", the stories of which had been passed down by the royal family. Another mural shows the Zonai descending towards Hyrule, which causes Zelda to realize that the \"gods\" that descended from the heavens to found the royal family must have been the Zonai.\n\nIn the deepest chamber, Link and Zelda find a mummified Ganondorf emanating Gloom, bound by a disembodied arm. As they enter, the arm falls off and drops a teardrop-shaped gem. As Zelda picks it up, Ganondorf comes to life and strikes with a surge of Gloom. Link blocks the attack with the Master Sword, but Ganondorf's dark power decays the blade, saps Link's strength, and leaves his right arm blackened and weakened. Ganondorf reveals that he knows Link and Zelda and mocks the former's inability to harm him, mentioning that someone called \"Rauru\" had entrusted him.\n\nGanondorf sends a surge of Gloom that causes Hyrule Castle to rise into the sky before falling deep underground. Zelda falls into a chasm, as Link drops the used-to-be Master Sword and attempts to catch Zelda, only for to her disappear into a flash of light. Link nearly falls in as well, but is grabbed by the disembodied arm and teleported away. When he reawakens, he finds that the arm has replaced his own. A voice says that Zelda had told him about Link, and that Link's arm had to be replaced to ensure that he did not die from his injuries. Recovering the Decayed Master Sword, he leaves the chamber he woke up in to find himself on an island floating in the sky. He descends to another island, meeting a Steward Construct who gives him Zelda's Purah Pad at her request. It directs Link to the Temple of Time, but upon reaching it, Link finds that he cannot enter. He then meets a ghostly figure identifying himself as Rauru, who informs Link that the arm he now possesses was once his own and that its power might be restored if Link visits three of the shrines on the island and gains their sacred light. After opening the gate, Link finds a larger teardrop-shaped gem that changes into an apparition of Zelda, granting him the Recall power before vanishing. Link's path is then blocked by a second sealed door, which he lacks the vitality to open. Rauru advises Link to visit the island's last shrine and offer it to their Goddess Statue, which will restore some of the vitality he lost to the Gloom. After doing so, Link is able to open the door. Rauru advises Link to continue visiting shrines to recover his strength before passing on, telling Link that it will be up to him to aid Zelda.\n\nAt the highest point of the Temple, Link finds a glowing light that reacts with the Master Sword. Placing it into the light, the Sword vanishes and is received by Zelda at an unknown location. Link spots a dragon, which parts the clouds beneath the island to reveal the kingdom of Hyrule beneath it. He receives a telepathic message from \"Zelda\" asking him to find her, beginning his quest to save Hyrule once again.\n\nLink returns to Hyrule, learning that the earlier events, called the \"Upheaval\", has caused chaos across Hyrule. Link then goes to investigate the mysterious reports of disturbances and Zelda's appearance throughout Hyrule. In the process, Link defeats four monsters occupying ancient Zonai temples with the aid of four acquaintances – Tulin of the avian Rito tribe where they climb to the Stormwind Ark and beat the monster Colgera, Sidon of the aquatic Zora tribe who, with Link, beats the sludge octopus Mucktorok in the Water Temple, Riju of the desert-dwelling Gerudo tribe, where Link helps beat the monstrous Queen Gibdo inside the Lightning Temple, and Yunobo of the mountain-dwelling Goron tribe where Marbled Gohma nests in a volcano near the lost city of Gordonia. With each defeated monster, Link finds Secret Stones, Zonai artifacts that increase the innate power of their users. Spiritual forms of ancient sages appear to Link and his companions, appointing Link's companions as new sages and passing down the Stones. After handling the monsters, Link tracks down \"Zelda\" to Hyrule Castle. At the castle, \"Zelda\" reveals itself to be an impostor in Ganondorf's service before being defeated by Link and his companions. Link further encounters Mineru, an ancient sage utilizing spiritual projection to stay in the physical world, and provides her with an artificially constructed mechanical body.\n\nThrough Mineru, the sages' spirits, and a number of dragon tears scattered throughout Hyrule, Link learns of Zelda's fate. The mysterious artifact which vanished with Zelda was a Secret Stone, and she was transported through time through the distant past. There, she met Rauru, who was revealed to be the first king of Hyrule. In the past, Ganondorf murdered Rauru's wife, Queen Sonia, and acquired her Secret Stone, turning himself into the \"Demon King\". Rauru sacrifices himself to seal away Ganondorf. Zelda then receives the Master Sword, and in order to restore it, she transformed into a dragon by consuming her Secret Stone. Prior to her transformation, she tasked the past sages to provide aid to Link in the future. In the present, Link retrieves the Master Sword from Zelda's dragon form, and heads to Ganondorf's location far beneath the castle. There, Link fights Ganondorf's army with the aid of the Sages' successors and Mineru before engaging in combat with Ganondorf himself. Nearing defeat, Ganondorf transforms himself into a demonic dragon in an attempt to beat Link and Zelda. Zelda's draconic form assists Link in defeating Ganondorf. With the help of Rauru and Sonia's spirits, Zelda regains her true physical appearance, and Link regains his right arm, and the two fall onto the surface of Hyrule via a pond.\n\nSome time later, on the Sky Island where Link had awakened, Mineru bids goodbye to Zelda and Link before her spirit disperses, while the Sages' successors vow to protect Hyrule.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nThe gameplay of Tears of the Kingdom is similar to its predecessor. Additions include rail grinding and mechanical transport that Link can build using the Ultrahand ability, including a car, mech, boats, and numerous other things. Link can use the Fuse ability to fuse weapons with objects to make them stronger, he can also fuse things with his shield and arrows. In the March 28, 2023 gameplay, Eiji Aonuma showed off four new runes: Recall, Fuse, Ultrahand, and Ascend.[1]\n\nGame Information[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nDevelopment of the twentieth game in The Legend of Zelda series began in 2017 after the production for Breath of the Wild concluded.[2] During the E3 2019 Nintendo Direct, it was announced that it would be a sequel to Breath of the Wild.[3][4] The idea of creating a direct sequel came from the fact that Eiji Aonuma, producer of Breath of the Wild, wanted to revisit the same Hyrule while incorporating a new story and gameplay mechanics.[5] Initially, new ideas were thought of for DLC but evolved into a new game when too many were gathered.[6]\n\nDuring the announcement of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity on September 8, 2020, Eiji Aonuma said that Nintendo was still working on the game and that the fans would have to wait before getting any news. Later, in a December interview, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser added that the contents of the game would be shown when they felt they had enough to show.[7]\n\nThe second trailer and first gameplay showcase aired on June 15th, 2021, during the E3 2021 Nintendo Direct.[8] A portion of gameplay was shown, featuring a number of abilities and the new world of Hyrule. An estimated release date for the game was also announced to be sometime during 2022.\n\nOn March 29, 2022, Nintendo released a video where Eiji Aonuma announced that development time had been extended, with the game being set to release in the spring of 2023. A short gameplay clip was premiered that showcased Link's new outfit and a heavily damaged Master Sword.[9]\n\nThe third trailer for the game was shown in the September 13, 2022 Nintendo Direct, where the title, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and release date, May 12, 2023, were revealed.[10] However, Nintendo UK did not livestream the Nintendo Direct as a mark of respect during the national period of mourning for Queen Elizabeth II.[11] Nintendo UK later acknowledged the announcement in a Twitter post on October 3rd.[12]\n\nDevelopment on the game was confirmed to be complete on March 28, 2023.\n\nTimeline Placement[]\n\nTears of the Kingdom is the sequel to Breath of the Wild, featuring the same Link and the same Hyrule. It is set an unspecified number of years after Breath of the Wild, hinted only in Sidon's Character Profile entry and by the fact that Rhondson and Hudson now have a young daughter, Mattison.[13] Fujibayashi and Aonuma briefly commented on the connection of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom to the rest of the timeline, but did not confirm anything.[14] The events of Ganondorf's rise to power in the past are not a loose retelling of Ocarina of Time.[15] While a new timeline has not been published since 2016, it is assumed that Tears of the Kingdom is set in the same distant future as Breath of the Wild due to its status as a sequel.\n\nReception[]\n\nThis section of the page is incomplete. You can help Zelda Wiki by .\n\nThe announcement of Tears of the Kingdom under the name \"Breath of the Wild 2\" which Nintendo Called at the time \"The Sequel to Breath of the Wild\" was celebrated by fans across the world as Breath of the Wild was one of the most popular games on the Nintendo Switch and was known throughout the gaming community, especially after winning the Game of the Year award at the 2017 Japan Game Awards.[16] Many fans speculated about whether Princess Zelda would be a playable character or if multiplayer would be added, but when asked, Aonuma declined to answer.[17]\n\nWhen the title of Tears of the Kingdom was revealed during the September 13, 2022 Nintendo Direct, many fans were unsure whether the name referred to tears as in crying, or tears as in rips.[18] Nintendo cleared up the confusion a few days later and confirmed that the name refers to tears as in crying.[19]\n\nAccording to the review aggregators Metacritic (96/100) and OpenCritic (97%), Tears of the Kingdom received \"universal acclaim\".[20][21]\n\nAwards[]\n\nEvent Award Result The Game Awards 2020 Most Anticipated Game Nominated The Game Awards 2021 Most Anticipated Game Nominated The Game Awards 2022 Most Anticipated Game Won The Game Awards 2023 Game of the Year Nominated Best Game Direction Nominated Best Art Direction Nominated Best Score and Music Nominated Best Action/Adventure Game Won Player's Voice Nominated\n\nListings[]\n\nCharacters[]\n\nName Race/People Where Found Description Link Hylian \"The Swordsman\", Hero of Hyrule Princess Zelda Hylian Princess of Hyrule.
