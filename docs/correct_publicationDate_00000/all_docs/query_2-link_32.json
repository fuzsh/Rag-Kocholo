        "text": "Isaac Asimov was hugely successful science fiction American Author and also a professor of Biochemistry. Isaac was originally born in Petrovichi, Smolensk Oblast, Russia to a jewish family of millers.\n\nHis family emmigrated to the USA when Isaac was three years old. Isaac grew up in the Brooklyn, New York and taught himslf to read at the age of five years old. While growing up in New York, his parents owned a series of Sweet shops where evryone in the family was expected to work to help out.\n\nIt was in these stores that Isaac first came across the world of Science Fiction, in the form of Sci Fi pulp magazines that were sold in the shops. By the Time Isaac was eleven years old he had begun to write his own stories. By the age of nineteen years old, Isaac had begun to sell thse stories to the Science Fiction Magazines. It was through this that Isaac met the editor of Astounding Science Fiction, John W Campbell, who became a good friend.\n\nIsaac graduated from the Columbia University in 1939 and spent the next 3 years working as a civilian at Philidelphia`s Navy Yard Naval Air Experimental Station as part of the World War 2 war effort. After World War 2 ended, he was drafted into the US Army, rose to the rank of corporal, and narrowly avoided participating in the Bikini Atoll Atomic Bomb tests in 1946, all in under 9 months of service, after which he recieved an Honourable discharge. He returned to the Columbia University and gained a Ph D in biochemistry in 1948.\n\nSince that time Isaac joined the Boston University Faculty where he remained conected to even after he pursued a full time writing career in 1958. He was honoured with a full professor of Biochemistry by the university in 1979.\n\nIsaac is widely regarded as a master of the Science Fiction genre and is considered on of the \"big three\" Science Fiction writers along with Artur C Clarke and Robert A Heinlein. His most famous work is the Foundation series of books along with the Galactic Empire series and the Robot series, all of which tie into the same universe to create a future history.\n\nIsaac was a great writer of short stories and his short story \"nightfall\" was voted the best short sience fiction story of all time by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1968. Nightfall was later expanded into a full novel with the aid of Robert Silverberg.\n\nHe was a reluctant Vice president of Mensa International for quite some time and was also the president of the American Humanist Association. Isaac was also a great writer and speaker of science and technology and was very well respected in this field.\n\nIsaac Asimov passed away on the 6th April 1992, however it was ten years later before his widow Janet and his daughter Robin made public knowledge that his death had been as a result of contracting the AIDs virus from a blood transfusion some years earlier.\n\nIsaac Asimov continues to be regarded as one of the greatest Science Fiction writers and his stories are still enjoyed today around the world."
