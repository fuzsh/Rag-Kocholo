        "text": "When Col. Potter goes away on R&R, the colonel put Hawkeye in charge because Charles is sick. Everyone comes to Hawkeye asking for favors. Hawkeye goes hard on Radar and gets angry at BJ when there is a new batch of wounded and he leaves. Hawkeye becomes a grouchy, regular Army leader.\n\nHawkeye is upset to learn that Peace Talks are going nowhere, and he goes to the Peace talks to speak his mind. Hawkeye is tired of green, and Col. Potter informs Hawkeye the Army upped the number points needed to be discharged. Margaret is in a good mood because she is going to see her husband in Tokyo, but she learns that he requested a transfer to San Francisco. Margaret wants a divorce, BJ grows a moustache, and the camp has a party with a theme of “Red.”\n\nA visiting female colonel gets friendly with Col. Potter which upsets Radar, who believes he is having an affair. Margaret works hard to impress the visiting colonel and realizes the Army is her life. Hawkeye spends the entire episode trying find out what BJ stands for.\n\nA corpsman that has been to the 4077th before returns, but he does not know who he is. Dr. Freedman is called in to help discover what has caused his temporary amnesia. Meanwhile, Charles declared he is not going to talk to anyone in the camp after he receives a telegram informing him, he is not available for a position.\n\nThe extreme heat plagues the 4077th. Hawkeye and BJ receive a package in the mail that contains a bathtub. The bathtub causes many problems as everyone in the camp fights over a chance to get into it. Meanwhile, Radar needs his tonsils removed and Klinger tries to get out of the Army by overheating himself. Col. Potter orders that the bathtub disappear so Hawkeye and BJ trade it for some ice cream for Radar.\n\nA windstorm is on its way and the camp has to get ready. Charles needs to catch a plane before the storm, so Klinger drives him. They wind up getting stranded along with some wounded Greek soldiers just a few hundred yards from camp. When the water tower blows over, some nurses get wounded. Radar loses one of his guinea pigs.\n\nWhen Charles saves a man’s life, he decides to contact the press to inform them of his heroics. A reporter arrives to write the story, but the soldier has difficulty in Post-Op and has to be operated on again. Meanwhile, Margaret is having trouble with her joint bank accounts with Donald. Klinger tries to get the reporters attention by dressing in various movie costumes.\n\nThe cold is upon the 4077th and Charles receives a polar suit in the mail from his parents. Everyone is upset that Charles has the nerve to wear the suit in front of all the frostbite patients and the cold members of the camp. Charles offers his gloves to Margaret and asks for them back for the rest of the episode. Because of the cold all the stoves have to be moved from the tents to Post-Op. Klinger, out on patrol, has temporary ear damage when the mines begin to blow up in the cold. A patient’s temperature is very low and requires a dip in warm water.\n\nThe whole episode is from the point of view of a wounded soldier. From the battle ground to the OR, and finally Post-Op. The solider has a throat injury and must communicate using a clipboard and paper. The patient helps the doctors and nurses discover what is bothering Col. Potter.\n\nThe 4077th receives a batch of wounded with a mysterious rash. Meanwhile, Charles hires a Korean houseboy (while BJ and Hawkeye are on R&R) to work for him who is an enemy spy. The Korean has just the cure for the rash. Hawkeye wins a Jeep in a poker game but received a howitzer instead.\n\nWhen the 4077th runs out of Sodium Pentothal, Father Mulcahy has a way to get it back. He takes up a collection of items to trade on the black market. Charles believes he can get a better deal by going along, but he only proves to be trouble. Meanwhile, the camp is flooded with wave after wave of wounded.\n\nAfter a party in the Officer’s Club, many of the members of the 4077th have a severe hangover. Meanwhile, Margaret has a breakthrough in her divorce, and she feels a little playful. Hawkeye and BJ vs. Margaret with Charles playing both sides. Father Mulcahy is upset when he gets passed up for promotion and he rides in a helicopter.\n\nFather Mulcahy writes home to his sister. It is around Christmas time, and he writes to his sister about: his not feeling useful, his helping Radar’s mother in the delivery of a calf, giving last rights, and punching a soldier. Everyone is depressed because they are not home for Christmas and Radar (after a suggestion by Father Mulcahy) gives Charles a gift.\n\nBJ becomes the stand-in father in a Korean family when the real father develops an illness. BJ spends a lot of time and effort helping this family and tries to find the families oldest son. Hawkeye is worried BJ could be in for a disappointment. A wounded general arrives at the 4077th with a wounded foot. The general insists he does not spend much time in the hospital, but every time he tries to leave, he suffers another injury.\n\nHawkeye is excited about the arrival of a Swedish doctor named Inga. Inga agrees to come to the Swamp for a visit with Hawkeye, but he is surprised when she only wants to talk medicine. Inga is also a smart doctor. She takes over Hawkeye’s patient which upsets him. Margaret points out he is only upset because the doctor is a woman. Hawkeye realizes how childish he has been acting after Charles feels she upscaled him as well.\n\nWhen the colonel’s horse disappears. They discover the laundry washer’s father borrowed the horse. Colonel decided to give the horse to him, but the horse is brought back the next day after he dies. Klinger is trying to raise money to bribe Col. Potter for a discharge. Hawkeye and BJ hide a young Korean avoiding being drafted into the South Korean Army.\n\nWhen a young doctor comes to the 4077th to show the doctors new techniques, he has a negative effect on many of the members of the gang. Charles gets drunk, BJ reads and re-reads journals, and Col. Potter hibernates in his tent because he does not feel useful, and his leg is injured. Klinger tries to get a Section-8 by pretending he is in Toledo.\n\nMargaret’s divorce is final, and she has an idea for a new nurse program. She has a general come to inspect the program who offers her a transfer and promotion. Radar falls in love with a new nurse and the nurses train to work with the wounded in triage.\n\nWhen the 4077th is being endlessly shelled the camp relocates to an area cave. Hawkeye, who is claustrophobic, does not approve of the idea. He sits at the entrance of the cave until him and Margaret must return to the 4077th to perform an emergency operation.\n\nHawkeye decides to protest the war by establish Rosie’s Bar as a separate country. Eventually the whole camp winds up at Rosie’s and not on the job. Hawkeye makes a new friend (Scully), Klinger takes part in a fixed Craps game, and Charles becomes a prisoner. Col. Potter has to break up their little party.\n\nKlinger falls in love with a nurse from the 8063rd and Charles falls in love with a Korean business girl. Hawkeye and BJ have a fight that ends when BJ finds out the patient he has been worried about is okay. Hawkeye moves out of the Swamp and into Radar’s office while he is on R&R.\n\nBJ gets the idea to have a party for all the families of the 4077th’s family members. To their surprise, everyone’s parents are willing to come to the party and they finally decide on the date. Meanwhile, the camp must bug-out. They spend a few weeks at their new location and have to move back. BJ gets briefly discouraged when one of his patients develops complications."
