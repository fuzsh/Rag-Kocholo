        "text": "M*A*S*H, American television dramedy series that aired on CBS for 11 seasons (1972–83). It was based on the 1970 motion picture of the same name directed by Robert Altman. The show enjoyed excellent ratings and critical acclaim, with its final episode drawing the largest audience to date for a television episode. M*A*S*H won 14 Emmy Awards over its run, and it received a Peabody Award in 1975.\n\nSet in South Korea during the Korean War, M*A*S*H followed the medical staff who cared for the wounded in a mobile army surgical hospital. Initially, the series focused on the characters that had been established in Altman’s film, with the two lead roles being the army surgeons Capt. Benjamin Franklin (“Hawkeye”) Pierce (played by Alan Alda) and Capt. (“Trapper”) John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers). Although talented physicians, Hawkeye and Trapper were unlikely soldiers. Both had nonconformist personalities and strong affinities for nurses and bootleg liquor. Their antics routinely outraged their straitlaced superior officers: Maj. Margaret (“Hot Lips”) Houlihan (Loretta Swit), the ranking nurse; Maj. Frank Burns (Larry Linville), their nemesis during the 1972–77 seasons; and Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers), their priggish foil from 1977 until the end of the series. The base was officially commanded by incompetent but genial Lieut. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson) and later in the series (1975–83) by irascible Col. Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan). However, the base’s operation was held together by the company clerk, Corp. “Radar” O’Reilly (Gary Burghoff, reprising the role he had played in the film). Another corporal, Max Klinger (Jamie Farr), frequently cross-dressed in the hope that it would earn him a medical discharge and flight home.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz"
