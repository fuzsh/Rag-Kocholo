        "text": "M*A*S*H started out strong, but after Henry and Frank Buns left, the show kind of lost its edge....Klinger started acting normal...and every episode became soabox for Alan Alda to preach his liberal politics.\n\nfrom www.jumptheshark.com\n\nOther Thoughts:\n\nToo much Klinger!\n\nWhen the Korean War lasted 11 years\n\nFather Mulcahy becomes a main character\n\nHenry was the first in a long line of cast members to truly \"Jump the Shark\" The replace ment of Frank by Charles and then of Radar by Klinger changed the face of the entire show. The very idea of Hawkeye and Hotlips ever doing the deed was a sure sign that the horse was truly dead.\n\nThe sensitivity disease killed this show. Hotlips and Klinger becoming deep on us... Man, who needs that?\n\nWhen Alan Alda completely took over and started directing episodes, turning it into an annoyingly preachy, generally unfunny show.\n\nThe show really started to degenerate when Larry Linville (Frank) left. It started a cascade of other bad moves: Hot Lips went soft, Charles came to the 4077th, Klinger stopped wearing drag, Alan Alda took over and made the show into an anti-war preach-fest (c'mon Alan, we already knew that war is bad!).\n\nI would have to say that M*A*S*H never jumped. So what if people came and went? That's what happens in a war!! You do your tour, and you go home! Loved Trapper, BJ, loved to hate Frank and Charles, cried when Henry died, and cried when it ended. Enjoyed watching Father Mulchahey develop as a character - for a representation of the church on TV, I thought it was well done, neither too pious or judgemental. Just flat out LOVE Hawkeye!!!!! My ideal man!\n\nThrougout it's ups and downs, it remained very funny and innovative.\n\nI loved this show right to the end. I thought that it was going to jump the shark when they killed Henry Blake, but Col. Potter brought a totally different perspective to running the show.\n\nThis show never jumped. It just got better and better. It was one sad day when the show left (thank goodness for reruns). Bottom line: My all-time favorite sitcom.\n\nIs it just me or did anyone notice Radar's voice changing in the last two part episode before he goes home? \"Criminy!\" His voice was grating and he sure acted irritated in that episode. Maybe Gary just wanted to get it over with, or hoped they didn't pull a McLean Stevenson on him.Overall this is still the best show ever made. Now fifteen years after the end I never miss the re-runs. Best show (care)anywhere.\n\nI don't think this show could have lasted if it jumped. Excellent stories and cast. Characters like no other.\n\nThere were several times during the long run of the show when chinks in the armour started appearing: Frank's departure (thus leaving Margaret with no bete noir), Klinger no longer in drag, the priest having whole episodes devoted to him. But what really killed this once truely wonderful show was A) Radar leaving and B) the show becoming so intent on having a message and \"being about somethng.\" Give us a break! Just be about the silly shenanigans of the various residents of the 4077th and shut-up already with your sermons. This one should have been put down at least two years before it finally ended.\n\nI think MASH began to jump the shark when Trapper left and was replaced by BJ. BJ was a wimp where Trapper displayed a cynical wit.\n\nWhen Alan Alda took over every aspect of the show.\n\nI've always felt this show turned once BJ grew the mustache. From then on, each episode followed the same formula--half the story was a preachy theme, the other half some silly nonsense. And BJ and Hawkeye are forever in competition with each other--the friendship turns into constant jealousy and envy. And the crowning touch is the canvas sneakers BJ wears--when you see an episode with those, turn it off!!\n\nThe episode when Radar went home. I think it started going downhill at that point.\n\nThis show was still funny at the end. It never jumped the shark, although it came perilously close once Alan Alda became executive producer and started making character changes. No more silly dresses and pearls for Klinger. No more Hot Lips--now she's \"Margaret\". No more poignant scenes like a tearful Radar announcing that Col. Henry Blake's helicopter was shot down, with no survivors. Now everything bad about war has to be rehashed OVER AND OVER and RAMMED DOWN PEOPLE'S THROATS and we have to get all SCHMALTZY and play moving music and give lectures because ALAN ALDA now has creative control. Still, the later episodes were good, when they weren't trying to make a Big Statement. Example: the episode where Hawkeye goes crazy trying to figure out what clever trick B. J.'s going to play on him was very funny, because it was just about the characters. To be honest, I think Frank Burns was one of the best (if one-dimensional) characters, and it just wasn't the same when he left. But when an actor assumes creative control, that usually proves to be the death of the show. Witness Michael Landon and Jason Priestly. Then again, their shows were already declining in quality long before they took over the helm. If the M*A*S*H* producers didn't have the grace to end the series when they did, I'm convinced it would have been shark meat by the following season.\n\nM.A.S.H. jumped the shark when B.J. Honeycutt and Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester III entered the cast. Honeycutt replaced McIntire. McIntire and Hawkeye were the dynamic duo. Honeycutt was too serious and was always whining about missing his wife and baby. Winchester replaced Burns. Burns would always freak-out when the dynamic duo hoaxed him. That was funny. Winchester just let it bounce off of him and would laugh with them when they hoaxed him.\n\nIt became fairly nauseating when Alan Alda began portraying himself as the final arbiter of human morality. And what was that morality base on? Something accepted by a majority of earth's inhabitants? No! Freudian psychoanalysis! Gimme a break. Hollywood once again promotes its own bankrupt excuse for morality and disparages the morals of the 90% of human beings who are decent, hard-working people, living their lives instead of trying to pretend to live someone else's. Sorry, tired of being patronized by spoiled, neurotic entertainment industry figures who have way too much money and not nearly enough idea of their own identities. If they REALLY want to improve the lots of the poor and correct the injustices of the world, they can use all their millions of dollars in charitable pursuits, rather than stuffing them up their noses and down their gullets in the opulent privacy of their Hollywood mansions. Mike Farrell has actually done a fair amount of helping the poor and downtrodden. Would that his self-righteous cohort would do as much.\n\nM*A*S*H was originally performed and filmed (at least partially) on the Hollywood backlot. When the set burned down, the never rebuilt. They just changed to a \"play\" format, where characters stepped into the Swamp, read their lines, ala Klinger:\"Mail call!\" The show began it's slow death at that moment. I began to pray it would get cancelled. Also, am I the only one to notice all those 50s shows in the 70s and 80s where the characters had Seventies and Eighties hair? Let's face it. If a kid like Chachi came into a conservative neighborhood like the Cunningham's, he'd have been run out of town on a rail, or at LEAST he'd have been held down and given an involuntary buzz-cut. As far as M*A*SH goes, check out Hawkeye's hair. Military issue?? Hardly. And Hotlips' hair became something straight out of a Farrah Fawcett poster!!\n\nI will not watch any episodes after When Henry Died...the show lost its humor.\n\nWhen Klinger stopped dressing like a woman / When Radar left.\n\nIt was obvious that MASH was in trouble when Winchester replaced Burns. While Winchester eventually became one of the few interesting characters left in the series, the loss of Burns meant the loss of true comedy, comedy with a sense of humor. However, like several others have pointed out, the show became almost unwatchable about the time that Hunnicut grew a mustache. With this event went out all pretext of being in the army in the early 1950s. We had Hot Lips with bleached blonde hair wearing a halter-top (very 50s), we had BJ with unruly hair (very military), and we had near-constant preaching from most of the cast. There were a handful of good episodes in the later years, but they are grossly outweighed by crap (sorry, there is no other word to describe what MASH became). If the series had ended its run in 1978 or so, it could have gone down gracefully; instead, they decided that the best way to keep things going was to repeat the same stories over and over again. We had different charactors going deaf (briefly), we had BJ being tempted into cheating on his wife (in virtually every episode that Mike Farrel wrote), we had Hawkeye working on becoming the first saint from New England, we had Potter talking in a vernacular that bordered on incomprehensible, we had Winchester disliking anything that was popular, and so forth.\n\nThere are many reasons why MASH lost it, but the decay became noticeable during the time of the 'stache.\n\nOnce Alda started writing a producing episodes it did about a 10 shark leap. All the regular cast suddenly became these highly moral people who all loved one another, with none of the conflict seen in the earlier episodes (i.e. Burns & Hot-lips vs. everyone). Even Winchester started to become a \"likable\" character. I still have yet to see the final episode since I was so completely fed up by that point. Alda ruined a great little black comedy.\n\nIt was already go up the ramp, but the jump on MASH for me was when characters like Nurse Kelly started getting more lines. Klinger all of a sudden the wheeler-dealer getting equipment for the unit rather than trying to get out. I'll shamelessly use this space to provide another Jump category and that is when characters (in period shows) start behaving in anachronistic ways. eg. when Hot Lips drops the sex kitten routine and behaves like a feminist, including a modern hair do. The hair-do example also works for Scott Baio (sp?) as Cha-Chi, with his Shaun Cassidy haircuts in the 50s.\n\nWhen Trapper left the show, it started to go downhill fast.\n\nNever jumped. I know a lot of people don't like the fact the characters and situations changed and they didn't just redo the movie over and over again, but in my opinion this is another reason why the show was so great.\n\nwhen i didn't see the back of radar's head in the opening credits anymore. i knew it would never be the same again. when the show went anti-military. it wasn't funny anymore. then it was a cause.\n\nPersonally, MASH jumped the shark when the 4077 was watching a home movie from radar's hometown/family, and when they showed his mom- Mrs.O'Reilly, it was radar (G. Burghoff) dressed up as a woman. Lost it.\n\nI just happened upon a rerun the other day. This show, the first MTM show, and Bob Newhart (show from same era) have got to be the best TV shows from the \"color\" era!\n\nTruly a ( NORTH )American Classic. This is one show that has had it's share of problems, ie: character changes, personalities ( or lack of ), but still made it all the way to the top of * my * personal *best shows of all time list. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER M.A.S.H. !!!\n\nThe \"Dreams\" episode.\n\nM*A*S*H* **never** jumped the shark, IMHO. Any show that can still make me bring me to tears and laughter, within the same episode, 18 years after the final network episode, deserves the title of classic (the original version of \"All in the Family\" also falls into this category.) I bawled when Henry Blake died, I bawled when Charles showed his more human side conducting the ragtag Korean musical group in a Mozart piece, I bawled when Margaret talked about people not paying attention to a poor little dog (am bawling as I write this just remembering those episodes) - nope, no doubt about it, M*A*S*H* has got to be one of the contenders for greatest TV show of all time. NEVER JUMPED!!!!!\n\nWhen I watch the opening credits, if Gary Burghoff's name doesn't appear, I do not watch the episode. The show had begun its' downward spiral from comedic masterpiece to melodramatic drone before this, but Radar's exit cemented the change. I dare a true fan of MASH to really laugh at any episode over the last four years. it is simply not possible.\n\nNever jumped the shark. I'd say it only went downhill after Hawkeye saw the GOODBYE in stone as he was leaving in the helicopter. The show just wasn't the same after that.\n\nWhen Frank Burns and Margaret became \"an item\", it was obvious the writers had run out of ideas. For an interesting game, try to name *one* event tied to the era of the Korean war and try not to find a M*A*S*H episode that mentions it. I think it's impossible.\n\nThe episode \"The Interview\" is often mentioned as \"the best\" episode of MASH, but for me it symbolizes everything that went wrong with the show. In the beginning the show was true to Robert Altman's movie: a group of ragtag doctors using humor to stay sane in the insanity of war, i.e. laughing to keep from screaming. Unfortunately, by the time \"The Interview\" was aired, the makers forgot the \"using humor\" part and focused exclusively on the \"insanity of war\" part. In \"The Interview\" a reporter goes to the 4077th to interview the people there about the war. Although the narrator's questions were written beforehand, the actors' responses weren't, so they improvized their answers, in character, as they filmed. There were no jokes and no laugh track, just a lot of pontificating about the Nature of Man and the Meaning of War. MASH simply forgot it was a comedy.\n\nThe one two punch of first Henry and then Trapper leaving the show. After that , the delicate chemistry that made the show funny was scrapped. Understandably they had to try something new, but it lost the bitter, reactionary edge that it had in the beginning. The main reason it stayed on so long was because it tried new ideas every once in a while, and in the blasted TV landscape of its day, this made it unique and ocassionally worth watching even after it jumped the shark.\n\nWhen Trapper left the show became so unenduringly painful.\n\nWhen BJ grew his mustache the show began to take on its self-important tone that permeated it's last few years. While I agree it's a great show, I was disappointed by the final episode. Not as bad as Seinfelds, but heavyhanded and maudlin in my humble opinion.\n\nRich actors preaching morales, when a shop stops being funny and starts getting preachy it's time to give up.\n\nShortly after Radar left and Alda took over the show, they dialogue changed for the much, much worse. Bad puns abounded, coming from the likes of Klinger, for god's sake. What an unwatchable mess it became.\n\nThis show definetly jumped the shark when Klinger stopped dressing likes a woman. He sort of gave up and that was out of character.\n\nWhen BJ grew facial hair he got all seroius on us and singlehandedly ruined the show. The Klinger had to go and dress like a man. What gives?\n\nWhen Frank left!!! Show stopped being funny and became more of a \"social-statement\" show. The show lost it's main antagonist, so Hawkeye, BJ, and the rest had nothing to do but contemplate life... click. The show began its drive to jump when Trapper and Henry left, but Potter and BJ were great initially. The show hit the ramp right before the jump when Hotlips met Donald Pennobscott...the Hotlips/Frank romance was the center of most of the sharp comedy of the show's early years.\n\nWhen Henry died the loose, funny, glibness of the show began to disappear. The writing for the Col. Potter and BJ characters was initially effective in maintaining this spirit, but the show just wasnt the same without Henry and especially the Henry/Radar combination. The show jumped to new lows again with the departure of Trapper and then Frank. And the final nail in the coffin was Alan Alda's moralizing. This show became a drama the last several years before its demise! Some shows stay on TV a year or two -- this one stayed on a bout 5 years too long. Its a shame because it was such a great show -- before Henry died.\n\nM*A*S*H* never jumped the shark. Every time a character left, an eqaully interesting, yet different one replaced him. There has yet to come along a show that could come close to matching it. It was both a hilarious comedy, and a serious drama,and that could probably never be duplicated. It worked and it was brilliant. Even when it slipped,and that was rare, it was still the best show running when it left the air.\n\nI say it never jumped. If the characters had not changed it would have jumped years before it ended. Frank/Hotlips romance, Trapper/Hawkeye's antics, Henry's lack of leadership, while all was very funny, was growing old. I think both the old and new M*A*S*H, although very different, was some of the best programming every put out.\n\nM*A*S*H produced three seasons of virtually perfect comedy; even when Trap and henry bow out, the first few BJs are tolerable as long as Frank is around. Once he's gone the show starts up the ramp, but it really starts to fly when Alan Alda, the STAR, is given de facto creative control, the same situation that degenerated All in the Family into Archie Bunker's place. They effectively turn Korea into the 100 Years war, rewrite the history of the show, and rely on the cliche spouting talents of Potter and Klinger. The show got so bad that if you rang a bell every time you heard an alliterative phrase from Potter or a cliche from Klinger you'd drown out the dialogue, which is why we did it. Meatball surgery? No, just meatball TV by the end, with what will go down as one of the most ponderous, stupefying final episodes of all time offsetting a really good show a decade before...\n\nM*A*S*H is easily the most dramatic case of a show jumping: When Larry Gelbart departed, starting the inevitable migration of creative power to Alan Alda, the show lost almost every pretense of humor, and became a ham-handed pulpit for Alda's politics and self agrandizement. By the 5th season, the nuanced characters of the movie and the first 2 seasons had been reduced to serving as either mere acolytes to Hawkeye's war-weary nobility, or serving as one dimensional buffon/antagonist foils, highlighting Hawkeye's rightousness. The show should have been retitled \"Oh, That Hawkeye !\" One small indicator of how lazy and self indulgent the show had become by this era is in the haircuts : the 1952 characters sure looked convincing with their mid-70s feathered hair and shag cuts !\n\nThe show never really jumped, although it became a little more serious after Frank Burns was gone. Still, from start to finish, one of the best-written shows of all time.\n\nI have to go with marking the replacement of Frank Burns with Major Winchester as the \"jump the shark\" point of M*A*S*H as well. The show didn't jump *because* of the character change; the change is simply an marker of the point at which the show's characters started spouting minutes-long metaphor-laden speeches at each other rather than conversing in something approaching actual dialog.\n\njumped when colonel potter became the show's \"dad\" figure.\n\nWhen Radar left, they made Klinger company clerk. When Klinger went from pink chiffon to army fatigues, the show was over the hump.\n\nMash was an excellent TV show that DID markedly drop off after McLean Stevenson left, yet Potter was very funny and effective in his own right (Meadow Muffins!!!) When BJ came on he was too serious, and that started the jump, when Radar left and Klinger got normal and helpful that was the coup-de-gras. Fini-, Although there were funny bits later, and funny lines, the whole show changed and JUMPED.\n\nI noticed that someone berated Hogan's Heroes as the worst premise for a sitcom, but how was this premise any better? Nonetheless, this was a great show until Radar left and the show became heavy-handed and didactic. Nowadays, when a sitcom has truly worn out it's welcome, I say it's \"MASHed.\"\n\nM*A*S*H, strictly speaking, never jumped the shark because it was never any good to begin with. More accurately, it sank to the bottom of the ocean with the episode where Hawkeye punches out Frank in retaliation for the offense of Frank's flipping a towel at him. A really nice guy, that Alan Alda, right? Later in the episode, he escapes court-martial by getting the witnesses to lie about the event. Just what we want in the Army -- officers punching out their superiors and other officers committing perjury. Really hilarious stuff. The other episodes of this series are hardly any better.\n\nM*A*S*H, through all its cast changes and character developments, never jumped the shark. The different ensemble casts parallels what would have happened in a real war as people come and go. The characters matured over time - Margaret softened up, Klinger got more responsibility and stopped trying to get out of the Army - again, a reflection of what would really happen. There will never be another M*A*S*H!\n\nThe show jumped the shark every time I had to listen to that laugh track of the guy who sounds like water going down a drain, \"Goo, koo, koo.\" Seems like the laugh track technician got bored one day and decided to test his director by creating that inhuman \"laugh.\"\n\nwhen wayne newton and mclean stevenson left. mike farell was too much of a ***** to be believable as hawkeyes wacky friend. and that old coot potter was too straight laced he should've stayed w/ joe friday.\n\nI thought the show got better when Frank left. I despised him tremendously. Charles had intelligence, and could be a formidable opponent, where Frank was pathetically stupid. Think how less predictable and more interesting a Bugs Bunny cartoon would be if Elmer Fudd was replaced by somebody with a brain. Charles gave us a wonderful, complex, interesting character that they would never allow Frank to be. In fact, Larry Linville left the show because of character development issues, if I remember correctly. Henry was funny, but he stretched the suspension of disbelief too far. No Colonel will be that totally stupid, even in our Army. I aspire to be Col. Potter when I get older.\n\nThe episode called \"Abissynia Henry\", where he gets killed, should have been the series finale. If it had, MASH would have easily been the greatest sit-com ever. You have all pretty much explained exactly what happened to this show after that. Nice job.\n\nI never cared for adding the B.J. Honeycut character early on. In the much later episodes (post-Radar) his character became more and more preachy and pre-politically correct. One episode that will haunt me was when his character cheats on his wife. He then spends the next 30 minutes moping and *****ing about it to everyone within earshot. It was too much to bare. His character did not get any better with time.\n\nAlan Alda is way cool. Honeycutt is gay. He hits on guys and always wears pink.\n\nMy oldest brother used to love this show and he talked about how Alan Alda's character had a great attitude. My parents watched the show on his recommendation and immediately commented on what a crappy attitude Alda had. Talk about a generation gap! Of course, they were from the World War II generation. (You know, the big one.) So anyway, I watched a couple of episodes and ended up agreeing with my parents. Fisheye, or whatever in the hell his name was, was a Third Eye! The dude never shut up and gave everybody a ration of **** and sarcasm. Of course, I found out years later that there was a war going on somewhere beyond his big mouth, so I figured maybe his attitude was forgivable. And then again, I watched \"Scientific American Frontiers\" and learned the guy was actually a robot! He continues to get on my nerves.\n\nThe perfect example of what \"Jump the Shark\" means to the novice-MASH, as stated before many times, should have ended its run after Henry and Trapper left the show. As soon as you see \"Mike Farrell\" instead of \"Wayne Rogers\" in the opening credits, you bail-- and you don't feel like your going to miss anything when you do.\n\nI'm pleased that someone reads my comments, very few of which are serious. If I am guilty of wrecking the thread commenting on one of the most important milestones of TV History, then I am truly sorry. In the future, I will restrict my foolishness to the more pathetic fare. After all, I am not a party crasher, and I am certainly not a Republican.\n\nJumped \"BIG TIME\" when they killed off MacLean Stevenson. He was one the funniest characters on the show. The final straw was when colonel Potter entered the scene, I mean I like Harry Morgan but Potter sucked big time.\n\nPerhaps m*a*s*h never jumped the shark, but it was surely in the 'Twilight Zone'....!!! I half expected an appearance by Rod Serling, but he never showed!!! m*a*s*h, if you like sheer escapism into comedy without any continuity of time and space, is a funny sitcom. Chronologically speaking, it's a comedy not based on this reality, but on another world parallel to our time, a doorway to another dimension. In reality, the Korean war lasts three years. In m*a*s*h time, the Korean war lasts 11 years, Alda's hair goes from black to almost gray, and we see that winter appears every season. In reality, rebels get court martialed when going up against the top brass. In m*a*s*h time, people can shout down commanding officers, throw middle fingers at them or just about anything without getting punished. In reality, the 4077th could never exist. In m*a*s*h time, the 4077th did exist. In reality, the Korean war was set in the 1950's. In m*a*s*h time, the Korean war is (up)staged in the 1950's with 1970's euphenisms and liberal social commentary, liberals are portrayed as pretty heroes, while the conservatives are to look like stoogy idiots to be bashed by Alan Alda's blood-drenched pen. And I thought a Liberal could never be narrow-minded, Alan. Thanks. As a comedy, m*a*s*h was the longest running 'Twilight Zone' presentation yet. I wonder, could Serling and Alda be kin to one another....????\n\nWhen Alan Alda, the Groucho wannabe, got his moralistic claws on the production it was gonzo.\n\nMASH jumped during the end of season one (1972-1973). When the show first premiered it was VERY much like the movie -- black humour, dark comedy, very anarchical. But the ratings were very low and was in danger of being canceled. So, they softened it up, humanized the characters and made it into sit-com crap! The last 10 years weren't worth watching.\n\nMASH is an all-time great, but the best shows were all during the Henry Blake days. Once Henry died, the floodgates opened. Radar left, Trapper left, Frank left, Klinger stopped being a transvestite (and was therefore not Klinger). If you are flipping through the channels and see Henry Blake, you know it's a funny episode. Otherwise the inconsistencies of the cast leave cause for doubt (\"is this a Charles or a Frank? A Radar or Klinger in uniform? Is Trapper there, or is B.J.? Is this one where Hawkeye has a psychological problem?) Forget it! Look for Henry and you'll be fine.\n\nThis show started to jump the shark when it was publicized that actors were bickering over the amount of lines each had to recite in an episode. I believe Trapper left because Alan Alda was taking too much control. When Trapper left and Blake died, that was the completion of the jump.\n\nNever ever remembering a very bad episode on M*A*S*H* they just got better and better to the very end!!!!\n\nThe show began a slow death when Radar left.\n\nWhen Alan Alda took over directing the show. Still the greatest show on T.V.\n\nWhen Henry Blake died. It died a painful second death when Trapper John left.\n\nWHEN HENRY LEFT AND RADAR CAME IN CRYING IT WENT SADLY DOWNHILL FROM THEN. HENRY WAS TO NICE A GUY TO DIE. THEY SHOULD HAVE LET HIM GOT HOME.\n\nI have to agree with 90% of the comments about this show. To this DAY I STILL dread the arrival of BJ, and somehow, right around the 7th and definitely the 8th season..the whole show \"looked\" different. In trying to tone down the laugh track, they made it sound like 2 people were laughing at the jokes. Radar was great but should have left a year earlier, Margaret was a completetly different person by the end, they dropped the backround music, they got that cheesy freeze frame at the shows end, in short..by shows demise, there wasn't one trace of the original show left to me...I don't know how else to explain it.\n\nThe Quad-Cities, IA-IL, is one of many markets still airing \"M*A*S*H\" reruns (some of them in their 10, 15, maybe 20th showing!). I can appreciate why this show has its enduring popularity; it dramatizes the realities of war. Perhaps that's why we heard Alan Alda always exclaim, \"This damn war!\" I'm sure he would have used the f-word if he were allowed to (as in, \"This f-----' war!\"). What I don't understand is there's a certain faction (small, but it exists) in the Quad-Cities that wants to see \"M*A*S*H\" reruns pulled from syndication for something else? OK, what do you want to see--reruns of a sex-ladened sitcom? Sorry, but you apparently have forgotten that there is a certain knob on your remote control that you can use if you don't like a certain show. That's the button to turn the channel or the set off.\n\nI thought that Trapper and Henry were the funniest characters on the show. When they left it definitely suffered. It was OK for a while though, and even became excellent again. But pretty soon, after the \"Hawkeye Tells the Shrink About the Guy Who Killed His Chicken Which Turns Out To Be A Baby So That The Enemy Doesn't Hear Them...\" episode, it seemed like every other show was a \"Psycho-Analasys\" episode. I hated them all after that. Is it me, or aren't sit-coms supposed to be FUNNY!!!??? When the comedy waved bye-bye, so did I, and the shark was left behind...\n\nThe first 3 seasons were great. But when Henry died at the end of the third season (i think its the 3rd) and then in the 4th season opener BJ is added, it jumped the shark. It still remained a strong show for years but it never had the magic of the first 3 seasons. I guess you could also say it jumped again when it turned into the Alan Alda show and started preaching at us instead of making us laugh. Hawkeye went from a womanizing, disrespectful, anything for a laugh sot to the perfect 70's man; gentle, sensitive, in favor of ERA wimp. I definitely watch any of the first 3 season episodes, any of the newer episodes with Frank Burns, but after that I may or may not watch it if it is not one of the better ones. If Radar is not in it, I definitely will not watch it.\n\nlong post...."
