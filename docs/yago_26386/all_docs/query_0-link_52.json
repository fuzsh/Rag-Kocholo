The TV show from the 80s. I just finished all of \"Moonlighting\" on Hulu. It was a big deal when I was a teenager, and I remember catching bits and pieces of it, but I just watched an episode a day for a few months, from start to finish. This show really broke new creative ground. It was, I feel, the first \"post-modern\" television show. It regularly acknowledged that it was a TV show and made fun of itself, both in explicit fourth-wall breaks, in cold opens (created because the fast dialog made the show often run short); in extended, often ridiculous musical sequences; and in making fun of the tropes of the 80s detective show (the zany chase scene, for example). If you're a creative, it's a show worth examining for artistic style. Maybe not every episode, but there's a number of \"Greatest Episodes of Moonlighting\" articles out there. There are a couple dozen episodes in particular that are worth watching. (But it was the 80s, remember, so be prepared to overload on pastels...) The link below goes to my review of a book about the show (which I read while I was watching it), and it includes an extended list of the things I think you need to know about it -- the \"gestalt of Moonlighting,\" if you will. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nNew Post: ‚ÄòThe Bear‚Äô season three is shaping up nicely - https://lnkd.in/gCpXh3pe - Few shows have landed with the same impact as The Bear. Like Carmy‚Äôs tastiest dishes, it contains a myriad of ingredients ‚Äì heated workplace drama, astute examination of trauma, a platform for famous guest stars ‚Äì carefully blended so every layer compliments the whole. After only two seasons, it‚Äôs already ascended to the loftiest heights of prestige TV. READ MORE: The Bear season two review: another perfectly cooked course For all its acclaim, critically and with audiences, the most exciting thing about the show is that it‚Äôs only just getting started. What does the future hold for Carmy, Richie and Sidney? After such a rich appetiser, the main course can‚Äôt get here fast enough. Is The Bear season 3 actually happening? Yes, Chef! FX officially renewed the show for a third season in November last year, several months after the second season dropped. Speaking about the announcement, Nick Grad, president at FX Entertainment, said: ‚ÄúThe Bear, which wowed audiences in its first season only to achieve even greater heights in season two, has become a cultural phenomenon. We‚Äôre so proud to partner with Christopher Storer, Joanna Calo, Josh Senior, and the rest of the creative team, as well as the brilliant cast led by Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. ‚ÄúWhat they have done is truly remarkable, and we and our partners at Hulu join fans in looking forward to the next chapter in the story of The Bear.‚Äù Who wants another round? FX‚Äôs The Bear is returning for a third season. Only on @Hulu. #TheBearFX pic.twitter.com/0CY2TxWtUs ‚Äî The Bear (@TheBearFX) November 6, 2023 When is The Bear season 3 coming out? We have a window, Chef During FX‚Äôs presentation at the Television Critics Association press tour, network chairman John Landgraf confirmed The Bear‚Äôs third season will arrive in June 2024 in the US. As for whether all the episodes will be released at once, Landgraf said he has ‚Äúno doubt‚Äù Hulu will keep the same release pattern. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt lost on me or anyone who worked on the show that it was anxiety-inducing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo we made a decision to drop the whole thing because it has a beautiful, uplifting ending.‚Äù UK viewers, however, might have to wait a little bit longer for the third season. The second season arrived on Disney+ in the UK a month after the US date last year, in July and June respectively, so the same could happen again for season three. Where will the story go in The Bear season 3? Back to the kitchen After spending a season planning a new revamped restaurant, the second season culminates with Carmy and co. opening the place for invited friends and family. For Carmy, this leads to chaos ‚Äì after he ends up locked inside the walk-in refrigerator and spirals into self-loathing, blaming his relationship with Claire for his lack of focus in the kitchen.

The granddaughter of a high-profile Hollywood producer is missing and Sugar, as is her line of work, steps in to find her. The story goes through some sleazy actors and sleazy criminals, but there's a strange undertone to the whole thing. But now, in episode 6, things have gone completely off the rails, in what I would say is a good way. All this time, there's been this strange network of people that Sugar is connected to. The ‚Äúpolyglot‚Äù society where it seems that they are united because they speak many different languages. It looks like one of those \"independent\" spy agencies you sometimes see in suspense fiction. Or maybe something like the strange world of John Wick's assassins with their coins and hotels. Boy, it sure isn't anything like that. It turns out that these people, and in turn Farrell's Sugar, are aliens. I can't express how strange this is in the context of the show. Once again, this all seems like a version of an old-school noir thriller. While the concept of someone being a secret alien is not uncommon in, say, the science fiction genre, this is a far cry from what you would expect from the series. Except if you were... looking closely. There's actually a lot of pretty strange things happening throughout the series that now add up in retrospect, even if they didn't outright say \"he's an alien.\" I think Sugar doesn't just like old movies, old cars, and old school manners, I think he has created his entire personality based on watching those movies as it has shaped him in how to act as a human. His desire not to perpetuate violence may be a moral conviction, of course, but it is not just because he is good at fighting, but because he has real abilities above human ones. This ranges from catching a fly with chopsticks at the beginning of the series to this week where he appeared to deflect a bullet with his hand (his watch, perhaps?). There is its ability to calm even extremely hostile dogs with a single sound. There's the fact that she said he can't get drunk because his body metabolizes alcohol 50 times faster than normal. I think she didn't have sex with Amy Ryan's character not just out of chivalry, but out of...biology. There's his injury that required some kind of blood bag with text that wasn't in English. There's his drug use, which isn't actually drug use but has to do with his transformation from human to alien. All of this has been there all along creating a weird ‚Äúvibe‚Äù around this show, but it never indicates that things were going to get this weird. What I still can't understand exactly is why he's pursuing missing persons cases all over the world, or why his alien ...\n\nTHE BEST LIAR WINS‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶BUT IS THE BBC HIT PROGRAMME - THE TRAITORS - GOOD FOR US??? ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know I could lie that well and keep it up!‚Äù. So says Harry Clark - receiver of more than ¬£95,000 in prize-money as he emerged the winner of the gripping and massively popular so-called ‚Äúreality TV‚Äù show on the BBC - as he reflects on his own deviously triumphant performance. As someone dedicated to showing people how to come across more effectively, dynamically and honestly on TV and radio news programmes - and in business presentations - I do wonder if The Traitors is a good thing for society. Sure it‚Äôs riveting - and demonstrates that there‚Äôs still a place for scheduled traditional linear TV with big enthusiastic audiences, with all watching at the same time. But this latest series has ended with the smartest contestant, Jaz Singh - who had correctly sleuthed who was the final traitor amongst those remaining becoming known as ‚ÄúJazatha Christie\" in the process - joining the show‚Äôs many losers.

And he did it right in front of us. He might be the smartest dude in Hollywood. And he's having a lot of fun too. Let me tell you about him. 1/ How is started Flash back to 2015. Taylor's been working as an actor for years. He's had some minor success. But it's time for a change. He decides that being in front of the camera isn't for him. So he jumps into writing. Turns out Taylor's pretty good at it. A couple of his scripts turn into hit movies. Next he comes up with an idea for a show about a rugged rancher trying to survive in a fast-changing world. Paramount picks it up. It's called Yellowstone. And Taylor's about to make it big. 2/ Yellowstone is a hit Yellowstone quickly builds an audience. It touches a nerve with audiences from rural towns to coastal cities. The sweeping scenery, family drama, and just enough murder to keep you hooked. People love it. Before long, the show is getting 10 million viewers per episode. With a blockbuster on their hands, Paramount triples down. Taylor gets the green light for spinoffs like '1883' and '1923'. There's another one in the works called Four Sixes. This guy must really love numbers. And all these numbers have me thinking about money. 3/ Let's talk dollars These shows are expensive to produce. Really expensive. There's the obvious stuff, like A-list actors and big ensemble casts. But it's more than that. There's on-location shoots with huge ranches. Scenes with dozens of horses and cows running through the pasture. Action sequences. Special effects. Filming spots from Africa to Malta. All this nature porn ain't free. And with dollars spilling out the door, Taylor figured out a way to cash in. That's where this story gets really good. 4/ Taylor's share When it comes to Yellowstone, Taylor calls the shots. No questions asked. Paramount cuts him a lot of slack. And he uses it. You know that ranch the show uses to film? Taylor owns it. He rents it out for $50K/week. How about the horses? Taylor owns them too. They're each $25/day. Plus the cost of his hand-picked groomers. But here's the best one. Remember that spinoff I told you about, set at the Four Sixes ranch? That‚Äôs actually a real place with a rich history. And the new show will be filmed on location at that ranch. No doubt, it will get massive global promotion. You know who owns that ranch? Oh, I think you know. Taylor Sheridan. Yup, he just bought it. Baller business move: Make a hit show about a fake ranch. Write a spin-off about a real ranch. Buy the real ranch. I'm a fan of John Dutton. But Taylor Sheridan is my new favourite rancher. _____ #marketing #entertainment #brand P.S. I share business breakdowns and marketing playbooks.

One producer of \"The Apprentice\" show whose NDA just ended, provided such an insider's view. Quoting the Slate article: ***The producers and editors [of reality shows] are ostensibly con artists, distracting you with grand notions while we steal from you your precious time. But the real con that drove The Apprentice is far older than television. The ‚Äúpig in the poke‚Äù comes from an idiom dating to 1555: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never buy a pig in a poke / There‚Äôs many a foul pig in a fair cloak.‚Äù It refers to the time-honored scam of selling a suckling pig at market but handing over a bag (the poke) to the purchaser, who never looks inside it. Eventually, he discovers he‚Äôs purchased something quite different. Our show became a 21st-century version. It‚Äôs a long con played out over a decade of watching Trump dominate prime time by shouting orders, appearing to lead, and confidently firing some of the most capable people on television, all before awarding one eligible person a job. Audiences responded to Trump‚Äôs arrogance, his perceived abilities and prescience, but mostly his confidence. The centerpiece to any confidence game is precisely that‚Äîconfidence.*** One lesson from this is: If you are going to lie, make it a BIG LIE and say it with strength and confidence. The marks will eat it up. https://lnkd.in/eqCU8yKs"
