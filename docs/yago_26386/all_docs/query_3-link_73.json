        "text": "Have you ever watched the long-running tv sitcom \"M*A*S*H\"? It ran for 11 seasons and was one of the most popular shows on television. M*A*S*H's producers created a special two-and-a half hour final episode to bring the series to a close, and that final episode ran on this date on February 28, 1983. The show has been in reruns somewhere ever since. That final episode is a significant part of tv history. Of the following four statements about the finale of \"M*A*S*H\", which are true? (1.) Although the series ran on CBS, the finale aired on NBC. (2.) The final episode set a record as the most watched tv broadcast for decades. (3.) The finale was directed by a cast member. (4.) The final episode did not air that night in parts of California.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe finale of the series chronicles the final days of the Korean War and includes several storylines that show the war's effects on the individuals of the 4077th MASH unit. After the ceasefire goes into effect, members of the 4077th throw a party before taking down the camp for the last time. It's true that \"M*A*S*H\" ran on CBS, and the two-and-a half hour finale also ran on CBS, so statement one is false. Did the show set a broadcast record for decades? Yes, it did. \"M*A*S*H\"'s final episode, which was titled \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", had an audience of 121.6 million viewers, more than the \"Roots\" mini-series that year or Super Bowl XVII. It stayed that way until 2010, when it was surpassed by Super Bowl XLIV. It's still the most watched scripted episode in tv history.\n\nWas that show directed by a cast member? Yes, statement three is true. Alan Alda directed it, and he was one of eight writers of the finale. With its tremendous ratings, is it possible that the show did not air in parts of California? Yes, statement four is true. Large areas of California suffered power outages because of stormy weather, especially in the San Francisco bay area. There was so much interest in that final show, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco, KPIX, got special permission to air the episode three weeks later.\n\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" was not initially included in the syndication package for \"M*A*S*H. Finally, in 1992, the episode made its syndication premiere. Local stations aired it as a part of a movie of the week. The final show had several plot points, including a nearby forest fire that caused the camp to relocate. That wasn't part of the original script. An actual wildfire destroyed most of the show's outdoor set during filming in October 1982.\n\nSome cast members were willing to continue with a follow-up series, which was called \"AfterMASH. It followed the postwar adventures of Colonel Potter, Max Klinger, and Father Mulcahy in a stateside veterans hospital, but it just wasn't quite right, and the show was cancelled after two years. The \"M*A*S*H\" series remains one of the highest-rated shows in U.S. television history. It was based on a 1970 Robert Altman film, \"M*A*S*H\", which in turn was based on a 1968 novel by Richard Hooker, \"MASH: A Novel about Three Army Doctors\". The letters M,A,S,H stand for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital."
