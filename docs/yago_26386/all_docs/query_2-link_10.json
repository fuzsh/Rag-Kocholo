        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. At the opening of the very first episode called, oddly enough, 'The Pilot Episode', which song is the first you hear while Trapper and Hawkeye play golf, Henry operates on a champagne cork, Hot Lips and Frank play footsie and Radar tosses a football with Spearchucker?\n\nAnswer: My Blue Heaven\n\nOf course, the old favorite...at least on the television show 'M*A*S*H'. This song appears a number of times throughout the series (I'll pay anyone who can give me an accurate figure as to how many!), almost the second theme song for the show, if you will. Hawkeye hums 'My Blue Heaven' when he cuts his 'liver' in the episode 'Bananas, Crackers and Nuts' and of course there is Margaret's performance in 'Dear Dad, Again' (yikes!)\n\n2. The theme song of the television show (and movie) is called 'Suicide is Painless'. A couple versions of the song are recorded for the show over the years, including one with prominent violin music and another with prominent horns. Who wrote the music for this marvelous ditty which is originally heard in the film version 'M*A*S*H'?\n\nAnswer: Johnny Mandel\n\nJohn Alfred Mandel, born November 23, 1925, in New York City, is a well-known jazz trombonist and songwriter who worked with such luminaries as Jimmy Dorsey, Count Basie and Artie Shaw, writing songs for these jazz greats. Aside from the M*A*S*H theme, other songs written by Mandel include 'The Shadow of Your Smile' and 'A Time for Love'.\n\nHe also did some movie scores, for example on the film 'Being There'. Interestingly, the lyrics to this fine song were written by Mike Altman, the movie director Robert Altman's son.\n\nHe was only 14 years old when he wrote these quite profound words!\n\n3. True or false: The lyrics for the 'M*A*S*H' theme song 'Suicide is Painless' are never heard on the television show.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nAs surprising as that might sound, the lyrics were never played over the opening credits. Perhaps the theme of the song was too controversial? Anyhow, the lyrics were performed on the movie version of the theme, here's the opening verse and refrain:\n\n'Through early morning fog I see, visions of the things to be, the pains that are withheld for me, I realize and I can see... [Refrain]: That suicide is painless, It brings on many changes, and I can take or leave it if I please.'\n\n4. In season three, several episodes include songs written by skilled musician Loudon Wainwright III including two for the 'M*A*S*H' nurses and a couple for General MacArthur. What is the name of Wainwright's character in the show?\n\nAnswer: Captain Spalding\n\nCaptain Spalding, with guitar in hand, entertained us for several episodes in the third season, quite a novel idea for a sitcom I must say! Along with his songs about nurses and General MacArthur, he also composed 'North Korean Blues', which goes:\n\n'Oh Tokyo, They got some saki, and sashimi, and some clean sheets, Oh, kimono, oh, kimono, Tokyo's the town that I love the best, East may be East, and West may be West, Forget about between, it'll drive you insane, And teach you things you never knew before.'\n\nWish they had kept him around!\n\n5. In which of these third season episodes did Loudon Wainwright III not compose at least one tune?\n\nAnswer: Iron Guts Kelly\n\nCan you imagine Wainwright serenading Brigadier General 'Iron Guts Kelly? Well...actually no one is serenading him any more thanks to Margaret! Aside from his three appearances on 'M*A*S*H' as Captain Calvin Spalding, Wainwright is quite an accomplished musician, even garnering two Grammy nominations for his albums 'I'm Alright' and 'More Love Songs'.\n\n6. Season three was really heavy on the memorable music moments! If you recall in the episode 'The General Flipped at Dawn', featuring a guest appearance by Harry Morgan as General Bartford Hamilton Steele, a musical number was performed. This came near the end of the episode when General Steele sang which of these tunes?\n\nAnswer: Mississippi Mud\n\nA song written in 1927 by Cavanaugh and Barris, it lost none of its flavor and fun with Morgan's performance. First requesting 'a number' from one of the officers at the hearing, Morgan proceeds to dance and sing the lyrics to 'Mississippi Mud'. This nutty performance helped secure Morgan's job as Colonel Potter, beginning in the fourth season!\n\n7. In yet another third season episode called 'Aid Station', Hawkeye is sent to an aid station (go figure!) with Hot Lips and the unlucky Klinger. After toiling there under extreme duress, they are able to return to the 4077th unharmed. Which song do the three of them sing in the jeep on their way back to the unit?\n\nAnswer: The Caissons Go Rolling Along\n\nThe first several lines of this very familiar song go:\n\n'Over hill, over dale, As we hit the dusty trail, And the Caissons go rolling along.'\n\nHave you ever wondered what a 'caisson' is? In this case it's a two-wheeled cart, pulled by a horse, that carries ammunition...quite obsolete in modern warfare!\n\n8. The fourth year of the series marked a transition period for the show 'M*A*S*H'. During the second show of the fourth season, called 'Change of Command', Hawkeye and B.J. are confronted with the new commander, the apparently 'by the book' regular army officer Colonel Potter. After some initial tension, however, the two swampmates are delighted to discover that not only is Potter a capable surgeon, but a man of sympathy and compassion. Potter joins Hawkeye and B.J. for a nightcap in the swamp after a long session in the OR. They drink, talk and sing the night away with much revelry. Which of these gentle melodies do they perform near the end of this episode?\n\nAnswer: Long, Long Trail\n\nMost 'M*A*S*H' fans are relieved to find that, after the departure of Colonel Blake and Trapper, two likable new individuals are there to fill in their shoes, namely Potter and B.J. We are reassured by the comaraderie these three exhibit while they sing the words, 'There's a long, long night of waiting, Until my dreams all come true, Til the day when I'll be going down that long, long trail with you.'\n\n9. One of the most popular and memorable episodes of the entire series comes in the fifth season, called 'Movie Tonight'. Music plays a large role in the entertainment during this episode. Perhaps the most entertaining and original 'M*A*S*H' song is performed during this episode. Who sings the first verse of the 'Army Song' (or 'Gee Ma, I Wanna Go Home'), performed almost entirely by the series regulars?\n\nAnswer: Father Mulcahy\n\nFirst comes Father Mulcahy, whose verse goes, 'A chaplain in the Army has a collar on his neck, if you don't listen to him you'll all wind up in heck.' Every verse is followed by the chorus, 'Oh I don't want no more of Army life, Gee Ma, I wanna go home!'\n\n10. A collection of four nurses sing the fourth verse in the 'Army Song' from the episode 'Movie Tonight'. In their verse, the nurses prefer which of these over the surgeons?\n\nAnswer: Chopper pilots\n\nThe four nurses who perform this verse are stranded because of their ride, so they join the rest of the camp in watching Potter's favorite movie 'My Darling Clementine'. The nurses' verse goes, 'The surgeons in the Army, they're bright, they are profound, but we'll take chopper pilots they'll get you off the ground.'\n\n11. Continuing with the episode 'Movie Tonight' and the 'Army Song', which of these characters performs their verse last?\n\nAnswer: Frank\n\nMy two favorite verses are Klinger's, which goes, 'Oh some guys like the Army I think that it's a mess, if it's so damn terrific how come I wear a dress?' and Frank's lame but hilarious attempt, which comes well after the song has died down. Frank's lyrics are as follows:\n\n'Oh Hawkeye and oh B.J., they think they're pretty smart, I'd like to take a scalpel and stab them in the heart.'\n\nHe also sings the chorus, by himself...but his singing dies down when he notices that the rest of the camp is not participating in his generous offering.\n\n12. There are several other tunes performed during the episode 'Movie Tonight'. Which of these is not one of them?\n\nAnswer: Keep the Home Fires Burning\n\nThe song 'Tennessee Waltz' is sung by the entire camp, while Margaret performs 'C'est Magnifique' during one of the many breaks that occur while they watch 'My Darling Clementine'. The doctors and nurses also sing the song 'Clementine' while they perform surgery in the OR.\n\nThe song 'Keep the Home Fires Burning' is performed in the year six episode called 'War of Nerves' while the camp stands around a bonfire they have built.\n\n13. In the episode 'Dear Uncle Abdul', Father Mulcahy is convinced that the Korean War needs its own song. After a first attempt that is somewhat a failure (though I always enjoy hearing it), he comes up with a more somber tune. Which of these is not mentioned in Mulcahy's second Korean War song?\n\nAnswer: Christian Soldiers\n\nFather Mulcahy's first tune is a bit more cheery than the second, it goes:\n\n'Oh my dear, I can't wait to see ya, But I'm here in South Korea. The picture you sent was quite an eyeful, I taped it to my trusty rifle.'\n\nNot feeling satisfied with this attempt, he forges on with another song which he hopes will better capture the feeling of war. Here's the second song:\n\n'There's no one singing war songs now like people used to do, No 'Over There,' no 'Praise the Lord,' no 'Glory Hallelu.' Perhaps at last we've asked ourselves what we should have asked before, with the pain and death this madness brings, what were we ever singing for?'\n\nHawkeye's response to the second version....'Amen.'\n\n14. In the year eight episode 'Morale Victory', while the rest of the camp indulges itself in crabs acquired by the crafty Klinger, Major Winchester helps a young patient deal with his new handicap. Winchester's patient has partially lost the use of his right hand. The problem? The patient is a concert pianist. Charles solves this by acquiring a piece of music composed for the left hand only, written by which composer?\n\nAnswer: Ravel\n\nWinchester is able to convince the young man that, though his career as a concert pianist may be over, he still will find a use for his life. The piano piece was specifically written for a soldier who lost a hand during World War I by the French composer Maurice Ravel, who composed the famous 'Bolero', among other works.\n\n15. In the final, two and a half hour 'M*A*S*H' episode, 'Goodbye, Farewell and Amen', Charles once again finds an opportunity to hear his favorite music played live, this time by a band of five Chinese war prisoners. Charles eventually convinces the Chinese musicians to play music by which of these composers?\n\nAnswer: Mozart\n\nThe 'String Quintet' performed by the five musicians, some using Chinese instruments, is bittersweet for Charles. He later discovers that the five men have been killed in an auto accident. I hope you have enjoyed this quiz...I encourage you to try some of my other 'M*A*S*H' quizzes if this one appealed to you.
