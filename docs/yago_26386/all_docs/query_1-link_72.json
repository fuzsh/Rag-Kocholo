        "text": "Now all the candidates are in place for the fast-approaching presidential election and both political campaigns have ramped up their efforts, it's a good time to focus on one important decision facing the nation.\n\nOf course, I'm talking about who will play Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live now that he is the VP running mate for Kamala Harris.\n\nSaturday Night Live has a long history of political satire. The earliest I remember is when I was a little kid watching Chevy Chase play President Gerald Ford.\n\nNow, Chevy looked nothing like Ford and he also made no attempt to sound like him, but whether fair or not, President Ford had the reputation as being a clumsy guy and Chevy could do a pratfall like none other so watching him falling as President Ford became the running gag at the time.\n\nOver the years, all key political players have been represented on SNL. Off the top of my head, the ones that have hilariously stood out for me were Dana Carvey as President George H.W. Bush, Phil Hartman as President Bill Clinton, Will Ferell as President George W. Bush, and Alec Baldwin's take on President Donald Trump.\n\nAs for the current candidates, it's anyone's guess if Alec Baldwin will return as Donald Trump, but he's the best choice. As for Kamala Harris, SNL vet Maya Rudolph has already proven herself to be the best choice. But, what about their running mates?\n\nThe Best Actors To Play JD Vance & Tim Walz On SNL\n\nIn my opinion, to play a politician on SNL, you not only have to be funny, but you also must have acting chops. I also think it's a tremendous benefit if the actors can resemble who they are portraying.\n\nIf it was solely up to me, here is who I would cast immediately. I'll go in order of when they were selected as running mates.\n\nRepublican VP Candidate JD Vance\n\nAt the top of the list, is a man who can provide laughs and isn't afraid to take chances and lay it all out there to get those laughs. When SNL kicks off its new season on September 28, the man playing JD Vance should absolutely be Zach Galifianakis.\n\nDemocratic VP Candidate Tim Walz\n\nAfter the Minnesota Governor was chosen by Kamala Harris to be her running mate, I thought Steve Martin would be a great choice to play him on SNL because of how much they can look alike. However, as much as I love Steve Martin, he doesn't do impressions and he admitted as much when he declined the offer to take the role.\n\nOnce Steve Martin was ruled out, I instantly thought of a comedian and actor who could put a hilarious spin on Walz, while capturing his mannerisms. It also helps that they're both from the Midwest.\n\nMy choice to play Tim Walz is Jim Gaffigan. He’s got the look and I think he’d have a fun take on the personality.\n\nThere you have it! If I was casting director these are the guys you'd see playing JD Vance and Tim Walzon on September 28 when Saturday Night Live debuts its 50th season on NBC."
