In the future, comments will be closed on these posts because I want to keep the discussion in the comments section of the review.\n\nThe current Episode of the Week is “War of Nerves” from Season 6. It aired Tuesday, October 11th, 1977. Alan Alda wrote and directed the episode.\n\nHere’s the capsule summary:\n\nSidney Freedman arrives at the 4077th with a patient who hates him for sending him back to the front. Colonel Potter asks Sidney to help relieve tension among the camp’s personnel."
