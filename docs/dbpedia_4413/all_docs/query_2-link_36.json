The left travel lane will be closed along the southbound Bronx River Parkway. In addition, the northbound Bronx River Parkway will be reconfigured and reduced to two travel lanes, with one lane to the right of the construction work zone and one lane to the left.\n\nThese traffic pattern changes and lane closures are needed to facilitate work on NYSDOT’s $65 million project to replace the bridge carrying the Bronx River Parkway over the Metro North railroad tracks in The Bronx. Motorists are urged to slow down and drive responsibly in work zones. Fines are doubled for speeding in a work zone. Convictions of two or more speeding violations in a work zone could result in the suspension of an individual’s driver license.\n\nAs reported in February 2022, there are also some changes to traffic flows on Throggs Neck Bridge, while deck replacement work is being carried out, through fall of 2024. Starting Friday, Jan. 27, from 10 p.m. through Saturday morning, Jan. 28, at 5 a.m., there will be several planned intermittent full closures at Throggs Neck Bridge. Each closure will last approximately 20 minutes. Motorists should plan for additional travel time or consider using the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge as an alternate route.\n\nIn addition, NYSDOT officials said there will be some changes to traffic flow on the Major Deegan Expressway (MDE). The department advises motorists of long-term, right travel lane closures on the southbound MDE (I-87) in the vicinity of Exit 3 (East 138th Street/Madison Avenue Bridge) and on northbound MDE in the vicinity of Exit 3 (Grand Concourse/East 138th Street) in the Bronx through approximately fall of 2024.\n\nVariable Message Signs (VMS) will be in place to alert motorists of these closures. Motorists are also advised that inclement weather could cause the start of these closures to be rescheduled. The closures are needed to facilitate work on NYSDOT’s $47 million project to replace the 80-year-old bridge carrying East 138th Street over the MDE.\n\nMotorists are urged to slow down and drive responsibly in work zones. Fines are doubled for speeding in a work zone. Convictions of two or more speeding violations in a work zone could result in the suspension of an individual’s driver license.\n\nNYSDOT further advises motorists of changes in traffic patterns on the southbound and northbound MDE (I-87) between Exit 5 (East 161st Street/Macombs Dam Bridge) and Exit 7 (Cross Bronx Expressway/New Haven/Trenton) in The Bronx.
