        "text": "Only 2,021 more to go...\n\nView of the pedestrian path on the East River section crossing from Astoria Queens to Randall's Island.\n\nSpans Manhattan-Bronx-Queens, crossing Hell Gate (East River), The Harlem River, and the Bronx Kill.\n\nThe Triborough Bridge is a complex of three bridges connecting the three New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens. The bridge uses what were originally two separate islands, Ward's Island and Randall's Island to support the center of the span.\n\nThe Robert Moses Building is the headquarters of M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels, the successor to the old Triborough Bridge Authority. Robert Moses, the ultimate modern urban planner, kept his office at the center of his empire - on Randall's Island at the base of his biggest moneymaking bridge. Both the building and his office have been renovated over the years and no longer reflect the omnipotence of Moses at his peak.\n\nThe Triborough does have a pedestrian path. It is mostly used by bicyclists who are legally required to dismount as they cross. Very few do so - until they run into one of the three staircases on the span. BEWARE.\n\nFor those of you who have never crossed the Triboro by bike or foot, it can be very confusing. The DOT provides this map, but I get confused all the time, so here's a simple explanation.\n\nThere is no direct route for cyclists and pedestrians from Queens to Manhattan or the Bronx. Instead of following the traffic, the path drops you on Randall's Island from all directions.\n\nYou need to cross the island and find the correct span for the borough you are going to, making the bridge a two-step process.\n\nI haven't actually taken the Manhattan entrance this year, so I can't vouch for it, but if the ramps are open, they're at 124/126th and Second Avenue. If not, the stairs are at 124/126th and First Avenue.\n\nAlternately, there's the Ward's Island Bridge at 103rd Street and the FDR, which is for bicyclists and pedestrians only. Ward's Island connects to Randall's Island.\n\nThe Queens entrance is the stairs at 27th and Hoyt.\n\nThe Bronx entrance is the ramp structure at 133rd and Cypress.\n\nHere's a question that I never thought I'd ask, but in the context of this blog is sort of important. Is this one bridge or five?\n\nConstruction started: October 25, 1929\n\nOpened to traffic: July 11, 1936\n\nTotal length of approaches (Manhattan-Queens-Bronx): 13,820 feet\n\nCost of original structure: $60,300,000\n\nEAST RIVER SUSPENSION BRIDGE\n\nLength of main span: 1,380 feet\n\nLength of each side span: 700 feet\n\nLength, anchorage to anchorage: 2,780 feet\n\nHeight of towers above mean high water: 315 feet\n\nClearance at center above mean high water: 143 feet\n\nHARLEM RIVER LIFT BRIDGE\n\nLength of main lift-truss span: 310 feet\n\nLength of each side truss span: 230 feet\n\nLength, anchorage to anchorage: 770 feet\n\nHeight of towers: 210 feet\n\nClearance of lift span above mean high water: 55 feet\n\nClearance of lift span in raised position: 135 feet\n\nBRONX KILLS CROSSING\n\nLength of main truss span: 383 feet\n\nLength of approach truss span: 1,217 feet\n\nLength, anchorage to anchorage: 1,600 feet\n\nClearance of truss span above mean high water: 55 feet\n\nWARD'S ISLAND VIADUCT\n\nStructural steel used: 29,500 tons\n\nReinforcing steel used: 5,500 tons\n\nRANDALL'S ISLAND INTERCHANGE\n\nReinforcing steel used: 9,500 tons\n\nConcrete used in roadway and piers: 111,200 cubic yards\n\nBridge Statistics from nycroads.com\n\nView Larger Map\n\nOnly 2,022 more to go...\n\nSpans - Brooklyn-Staten Island, The Narrows, New York Harbor.\n\nAccording to the MTA, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was the world's longest suspension span when it opened in 1964.\n\n\"Its monumental 693 foot high towers are 1 5/8 inches farther apart at their tops than at their bases because the 4,260 foot distance between them made it necessary to compensate for the earth's curvature. Each tower weighs 27,000 tons and is held together with three million rivets and one million bolts. Seasonal contractions and expansions of the steel cables cause the double-decked roadway to be 12 feet lower in the summer than in the winter.\" (MTA website)\n\nThe Bridge at dawn as seen from the approach to New York Harbor\n\nThe bridge was designed by Othmar Ammann, who had also designed many of the most beautiful and iconic bridges in New York City, including the George Washington Bridge, the Bayonne Bridge, the Bronx Whitestone Bridge, the Triborough Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge and the lovely, Hell Gate Bridge (AKA, The New York Connecting Railroad Bridge).\n\nThe dramatic silhouette of the span may be best known as the starting point for the annual NYC Marathon, but it is also featured in many films set in NYC. My personal favorite is from Saturday Night Fever when Tony Manero (John Travolta) and his Bay Ridge friends all get wasted and climb all over the cables.\n\nView from the 69th Street Pier, looking South to the mouth of the harbor.\n\nCrossing the span during the 2007, NYC 5Boro Bicycle Tour, one of the few opportunities for non-motorists to cross the bridge which has no provisions for pedestrians or bicyclists.\n\nType of bridge: Suspension\n\nConstruction started: August 13, 1959\n\nOpened to traffic (upper deck): November 21, 1964\n\nOpened to traffic (lower deck): June 28, 1969\n\nLength of main span: 4,260 feet\n\nLength of each side span: 1,215 feet\n\nLength, anchorage to anchorage: 6,690 feet\n\nTotal length of bridge and approaches: 13,700 feet\n\nWidth of bridge: 103 feet\n\nNumber of decks: 2 decks\n\nNumber of traffic lanes: 12 lanes (6 upper, 6 lower)\n\nHeight of towers above mean high water: 693 feet\n\nClearance at center above mean high water: 228 feet\n\nDeepest foundation below mean high water: 170 feet\n\nCost of original structure: $320,126,000\n\nBridge statistics from nycroads.com\n\nView Larger Map\n\nOnly 2,023 more to go...\n\nSpans - Manhattan-Bronx, Harlem River.\n\nThe bridge and adjoining park were named for the Macomb family who operated a dam and mill on the site.\n\nAs use of the Harlem River increased in the 1830's, the dam, which blocked all but the smallest of boats became a local bone of contention. In 1838, a group of local citizens rammed the dam with a coal barge and destroyed it by chopping through it with axes.\n\nIn the course of the following lawsuit and court case, the dam was found to be \"a public nuisance...\" built \"without authority of law...the Legislature did not authorize the obstruction of the navigation of the river in the manner in which it was done by the dam in question.\"\n\nAfter the Brooklyn and Washington Bridges, Macomb's Dam Bridge is the third oldest major bridge in New York City. It was designated a city landmark in 1992.\n\nAt the time of its construction, its massive steel central swing span was considered to be the world's heaviest movable mass.\n\nType of bridge: Moveable - Swing\n\nConstruction started: April 1, 1892\n\nOpened to traffic: May 1, 1895\n\nLength of main span: 412 feet\n\nLength of two channels: 150 feet\n\nTotal length of bridge and approaches: 2,540 feet\n\nWidth of bridge: 60 feet\n\nWidth of roadway: 40 feet\n\nNumber of traffic lanes: 4 lanes\n\nClearance at center above mean high water: 28 feet\n\nFoundation type: Caisson\n\nCost of original structure: $1,800,000\n\nBridge statistics from nycroads.com\n\nThe bridge is a handy way to access Yankee Stadium and can get fairly crowded before or after a home game in the Bronx.\n\nView Larger Map\n\nOnly 2,024 more to go...\n\nSpans - Manhattan-Bronx, Harlem River\n\nView of the Harlem River from the Broadway Bridge.\n\nThis is more accurately the Harlem River Ship Channel as it is a man-made canal that was constructed in 1895.\n\nThe MTA, Marble Hill Station is in the foreground on the North side of the channel, the Circle Line is passing to the South, and the Henry Hudson Bridge is visible in the distance to the West.\n\nMarble Hill is a truly strange example of NYC redistricting. The Harlem river originally passed to the North of the community, making it part of the island of Manhattan. When the channel was dug to facilitate the passing of larger ships, the area was cut off from the island, and the old river route filled in.\n\nMarble Hill is still legally part of the borough of Manhattan.\n\nView of the actual bridge crossing.\n\nThe subway runs on the upper level.\n\nType of bridge: Moveable - Vertical lift\n\nConstruction started: April 1, 1959\n\nOpened to rail traffic: December 26, 1960\n\nOpened to vehicular traffic: July 1, 1962\n\nLength of main span: 304 feet\n\nTotal length of bridge and approaches: 557 feet\n\nNumber of traffic lanes: 6 lanes\n\nNumber of subway tracks: 3 tracks\n\nClearance over mean high water (closed position): 25 feet\n\nClearance over mean high water (open position): 136 feet\n\nSteel used in structure: 2,500 tons\n\nCost of original structure: $13,400,000\n\nBridge statistics from nycroads.com\n\nView Larger Map\n\n2,026 to go...\n\nNo other bridge could be Number 1 on the list.\n\nSpan - Manhattan to Brooklyn across the East River\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge, one of New York City’s most celebrated architectural wonders and arguably the most influential bridge in American history, was completed in 1883. Designed by John Augustus Roebling and completed by his son Washington Roebling, the Brooklyn Bridge was, at the time of its completion, the longest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span of 1595.5 feet.\n\nIt received landmark status in 1964 and is the oldest bridge that is open to passengers or vehicles.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge had 137,563 vehicle crossings on an average weekday in 2004.\n\nQuoted from: Transportation Alternatives, The DOT, and\n\nthe Wikipedia entry for The Brooklyn Bridge\n\nPedestrian and Bicycle access to the Brooklyn Bridge -\n\nAccess to the bridge has improved markedly over the last few years.\n\nThe city recently added much needed signs and lighting to the Cadman Plaza Stairway entrance that is heavily used by tourists and pedestrians.\n\nLast year, they added a two-way protected bike lane on Tillary Street to facilitate access to the bridge from the Downtown and Heights neighborhoods.\n\nThe Adams Street bike path is still basically unusable due to the fact that the Marriott allows livery cab drivers to park all along the length in front of the hotel.\n\nThe Manhattan entrance is easy to find, but hard to legally ride to on a bicycle. The safest thing to do is dismount and walk from the corner of Centre and Chambers Streets to the pedestrian entrance, due to traffic and crowds, but very few cyclists do this.\n\nThe pathway across the bridge is separated into two distinct lanes; the southern lane is for pedestrians, the northern lane for cyclists. These are clearly marked with icons, but are largely ignored by tourists who don't know any better.\n\nManhattan entrance: Park Row and Centre Street, across from City Hall Park.\n\nBrooklyn entrance: Stairs under the overpass at Cadman Plaza East and Prospect Streets, or ramp to Tillary and Adams Streets.\n\nCyclists at dawn crossing the Brooklyn Bridge during the 2007 NYC Century\n\nSunrise over the Manhattan Bridge from the pedestrian walkway of the Brooklyn Bridge\n\nType of bridge:Suspension\n\nConstruction started:January 3, 1870\n\nOpened to traffic:May 24, 1883\n\nLength of main span:1,595 feet, 6 inches\n\nLength of side spans:930 feet\n\nLength, anchorage to anchorage:3,455 feet, 6 inches\n\nTotal length of bridge and approaches:6,016 feet\n\nWidth of bridge:85 feet\n\nNumber of traffic lanes:6 lanes\n\nNumber of cables:4 cables\n\nHeight of towers above mean high water:276 feet, 6 inches\n\nClearance at center above mean high water:135 feet\n\nLength of each of four cables:3,578 feet, 6 inches\n\nDiameter of each cable:15¾ inches\n\nNumber of wires in each cable:5,434 wires\n\nTotal length of wires:14,060 miles\n\nTotal masonry in towers:85,159 cubic yards\n\nWeight of suspended structure:6,620 tons\n\nTotal weight of bridge:14,680 tons\n\nCost of original structure:$15,100,000\n\nBridge facts from NYCRoads.com\n\nView Larger Map\n\nAccording to most information out there on the internet, the majority of people group bridges into six main types:\n\nBeam bridges - a rigid, horizontal structure that rests on two end supports. Beam bridges are the most basic of bridge design – like a log over a creek.\n\nCantilever bridges - a bridge built using cantilevers: structures that project horizontally into space, supported on only one end.\n\nA simple cantilever span is formed by two arms that extend from opposite sides of the obstacle to be crossed and meet at the center.\n\nThe Queensboro Bridge is an example of a cantilever bridge.\n\nArch bridges - a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch.\n\nThe Hell Gate Bridge is an example of an arch bridge.\n\nSuspension bridges - Suspended from two high locations over a river or canyon, simple suspension bridges follow a shallow downward arc. Advances led to the development of the suspended-deck suspension bridge, a modern bridge capable of carrying vehicles and light rail. Instead of the deck following the downward arc of the main load-bearing cables (or chains), these cables are suspended between towers, and vertical suspender cables carry the weight of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge is an example of a suspension bridge.\n\nCable-Stayed bridges - a bridge that consists of one or more columns (normally referred to as towers or pylons), with cables supporting the bridge deck. The cable-stay design is the optimum bridge for a span length between that of cantilever bridges and suspension bridges.\n\nThe East 153rd Street Bridge is an example of a cable-stayed bridge.\n\nTruss bridges - a bridge composed of connected elements (typically straight) which may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads. This type of bridge structure has a fairly simple design and is particularly cheap to construct owing to its efficient use of materials. The truss may carry its roadbed on top, in the middle, or at the bottom of the truss.\n\nThe Kosciuszco Bridge is an example of a truss bridge.\n\nSubgroups of these include:\n\nAqueduct, Causeway, Clapper, Compression Arch Suspended Deck,\n\nGirder, Pontoon, Segmental, Side Spar, Trestle, Tubular, and Viaduct.\n\nMoveable bridges are seen as a separate engineering idea, and include:\n\nDrawbridge - the bridge deck is hinged on one end\n\nBascule bridge - a drawbridge hinged on pins with a counterweight to facilitate raising\n\nFolding bridge - a drawbridge with multiple sections that collapse together horizontally\n\nCurling bridge - a drawbridge with multiple sections that curl vertically\n\nLift bridge - the bridge deck is lifted up by counterweighted cables mounted on towers\n\nTable bridge - a lift bridge with the lifting mechanism mounted underneath it\n\nRetractable bridge (Thrust bridge) - the bridge deck is retracted to one side\n\nRolling bascule bridge - an unhinged drawbridge which is lifted by the rolling of a large gear segment along a horizontal rack\n\nSubmersible bridge - the bridge deck is lowered down into the water\n\nTilt bridge - the bridge deck, which is curved, is lifted up at an angle\n\nSwing bridge - the bridge deck rotates around a fixed point, usually at the center, but may resemble a gate in its operation\n\nTransporter bridge - a structure high above carries a suspended, ferry-like structure\n\nJetway - a passenger bridge to an airplane\n\nMost information taken from Wikipedia \"Bridge\" Entry\n\nFor a graphic layout of basic bridge types go to pghbridges.com\n\nNYC Bridge Information from the DOT\n\nQ: How many bridges are there in New York City? How many are under the jurisdiction of DOT?\n\nA: There are 2,027 bridges in New York City. DOT's Division of Bridges is responsible for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of the 787 bridges (including 6 tunnels) and 67 culverts presently under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation.\n\nQ: Who other than DOT operates bridges and tunnels in New York City?\n\nA:MTA Bridges and Tunnels (formerly known as the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority) operates the following structures: Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, Henry Hudson Bridge, Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, Queens Midtown Tunnel, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The MetroNorth Railroad and the Long Island Railroad, both subsidiaries of the MTA, operate bridges and tunnels on their rail lines.\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey operates the following bridges and tunnels: Bayonne Bridge, George Washington Bridge, Goethals Bridge, Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, Outerbridge Crossing.\n\nQ: Which bridge carries the largest amount of daily traffic?\n\nA: The Queensboro Bridge. On an average weekday in 2004, some 180,369 vehicles crossed this celebrated cantilevered bridge between 59th Street in Manhattan and Long Island City in Queens. The Brooklyn Bridge had 137,563 vehicle crossings, the Williamsburg Bridge had 110,528 and the Manhattan Bridge had 79,129.\n\nQ: How many New York City bridges are classified as historic landmarks?\n\nA: As of January 1, 1998, ten bridges in New York City had been awarded some degree of landmark status. They include seven that are under the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Transportation: the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queensboro, Washington, University Heights, Carroll Street and Macombs Dam Bridges. The three landmarked bridges not operated by DOT are the George Washington Bridge (Port Authority of New York and New Jersey), Highbridge (NYC Department of Environmental Protection), and Hell Gate Bridge (Amtrak).\n\nQ: What was the first bridge built in New York City? What is the oldest bridge still standing in New York City?\n\nA: New York City’s first bridge, known as the King’s Bridge, was constructed in 1693. Fitted with stone abutments and a timber deck, it spanned Spuyten Duyvil Creek between Manhattan and the Bronx. It was demolished in 1917. The oldest bridge still standing in New York City is Highbridge, which spans the Harlem River between Manhattan and the Bronx; it was built in 1843. Highbridge is an aqueduct that carries a water main; it is not accessible to passengers or vehicles. The oldest bridge that is open to passengers or vehicles is the Brooklyn Bridge, which opened in 1883.\n\nQ: When were the East River Bridges built? Which of the East River Bridges is the longest?\n\nA: The four major bridges over the East River were constructed within four decades, from the start of construction on the Brooklyn Bridge in January 1870 to completion of the Manhattan Bridge in December 1909. The Brooklyn Bridge, one of New York City’s most celebrated architectural wonders and arguably the most influential bridge in American history, was completed in 1883. Designed by John Augustus Roebling and completed by his son Washington Roebling, the Brooklyn Bridge was, at the time of its completion, the longest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span of 1595.5 feet. The Williamsburg Bridge, with its 35-story steel towers, is the largest of the three suspension bridges that span the East River. When it was completed in 1903, it became the longest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span that is 1,600 feet long.\n\nThe two-decked Queensboro Bridge is one of the greatest cantilever bridges in the history of American bridge design. It was completed in March 1909. The last of the great bridges constructed across the East River, the Manhattan Bridge, opened on traffic on December 31, 1909.\n\nQ: How many movable bridges does New York City operate?\n\nA: There are 25 movable bridges in New York City, including two retractile bridges, seven swing bridges, four lift bridges, and twelve bascule (drawbridge) bridges.\n\nQ: How many bridges connect Manhattan to other Boroughs or States?\n\nA: There are 21 major bridges that connect to the island of Manhattan.\n\nManhattan Only - In order from West to East\n\n(The Hudson to the Harlem to the East Rivers) and North to South.\n\nGeorge Washington Bridge\n\nSpuyten Duyvil Rail Bridge\n\nHenry Hudson Bridge\n\nBroadway Bridge\n\nUniversity Heights Bridge\n\nWashington Bridge\n\nAlexander Hamilton Bridge\n\nHighbridge\n\nMacombs Dam Bridge\n\n145th Street Bridge\n\nMadison Avenue Bridge\n\nPark Avenue Bridge\n\nThird Avenue Bridge\n\nWillis Avenue Bridge\n\nTriborough Bridge\n\nWards Island Pedestrian Bridge\n\nRoosevelt Island Bridge\n\nQueensboro Bridge\n\nWilliamsburg Bridge\n\nManhattan Bridge\n\nBrooklyn Bridge\n\nView Larger Map"
