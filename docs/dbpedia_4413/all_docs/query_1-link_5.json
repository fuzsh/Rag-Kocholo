        "text": "Glover’s Rock\n\nLocated on Orchard Beach Road, not far from its intersection with Park Drive, Glover’s Rock is a glacial erratic and a distinctive natural wonder. The huge boulder is composed of gneiss, a rock type that forms the bedrock underlying the park and most of The Bronx. It is known primarily for commemorating a Revolutionary War battle led by Colonel John Glover. In 1776, Glover and his small band of some 800 soldiers held off the British contingent of 4,000 as they advanced from their landing place at Rodman’s Neck (then known as Pell’s Point). This stand-off gave General George Washington the opportunity to lead his troops across to White Plains.\n\nIndian Rock\n\nAmong the Park’s most stunning geological sites is a massive boulder site, located in the southern section of the Park in a wooded area just behind the baseball diamond after you pass the dog run. To find the site, walk into the woods from centerfield. However, since such sites were often significant meeting places for the Native Americans who lived in this area, the name Indian Rock has been maintained. This rock formation was long thought to be an outcropping of bedrock. Peter Matt, a geologist from Brooklyn College, studied its surfaces and analyzed them in relation to other rocks around it, and on the shores of Hunter Island and Twin Island. He believes the Indian Rock is a massive erratic boulder broken off the bedrock somewhere north of Pelham Bay Park and swept here by a melting glacier. Local historian and Friends member Jorge Santiago identified this rock formation as the same one that was used to commemorate the Bronx Parks system with a plaque in 1913. That was long before the woods had grown up around it and its prominent placement was obscured.\n\nPelham Bay Naval Camp Boulder\n\nDid you know: a World War I Naval training camp once stood in Pelham Bay Park. Opening on October 1, 1917, it once occupied all of Rodman’s Neck, including the area of the current golf driving range. By March 1918 the base held 4,777 sailors and 537 buildings, most used for barracks. But other structures included the following: drill hall, library, YMCA, Knights of Columbus, Jewish welfare building, Officer’s Club, Post Office, police and fire buildings, photo studio, sixteen mess halls, and also pools, tennis courts, and numerous canteens. Pelham Bay Park, with its vast size and public waterfront, provided an ideal location in which to drill sailors in naval launches as well as sham ground battles and maneuvers. It also allowed for numerous recreational activities like baseball, golf, tennis, band marches, drills, boxing matches, and theater. With the end of the war in November 1918, the sailors began to leave the base. By the end of 1919, the sale of the buildings was completed. Local history buff Charlie Kreig found a photograph showing a group of soldiers at the camp, with a massive outcropping in the background. He and fellow historian Jorge Santiago set out to find it, which they did, just northeast of the City Island Traffic Circle. They were able to match its markings to the boulder in the old image.\n\nSphinx Rock\n\nPerched on the northeastern edge of Twin Island is the glacial erratic known as Sphinx Rock. A section of the boulder once balanced on top, but broke away and now sits on the ground beside it. An early Parks Department brochure, discovered by local historian Jorge Santiago, indicates that the boulder was also known by the name of Lion Rock.\n\nTilly’s Rock\n\nOne of the most spectacular spots in the Park is reached by hiking the Kazimiroff Nature Trail on Hunter Island and veering off toward the water on the northeastern coast. We, the Friends of Pelham Bay Park, laid a bog bridge across the salt marsh that allows visitors to cross in a way that does not affect the ecosystem. Taking the trek brings them to an awesome geological area including rocky coast and glacial erratics combined with marshland and tidal pools of the Long Island Sound. According to the late historian John McNamara, Tilly’s Rock – the largest of the boulders seen here – may have been given its name by campers, after someone called Matilda. Or, it may relate to navigation and the tiller used by sailors to change course. They called it “Tiller Rock.” The spelling has sometimes been “Tillie’s,” as cited in a 1936 article turned up by local historian Jorge Santiago."
