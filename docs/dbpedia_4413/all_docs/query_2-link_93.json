REGENT 4-1000 June 24, 1936 Bids were taken today at 2 P.M. Eastern Standard Time by the Marine Parkway Authority for the construction of the Marine Parkway Bridge across Rockaway Inlet. The low bidder on the substructure was Frederick Snare Corporation, 114 Liberty Street, New York City, who submitted a bid of $1,595,337.80. The low bidder on the superstructure was The American Bridge Company, 71 Broadway, New York City, who submitted a bid of $2,139,311.40.· The Marine Parkway Bridge will replace the ferry now running across Rockaway Inlet between the end of Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn and Jacob Riis Park in Neponsit. The bridge will be slightly over 4000 feet in length, having three 500-foot spans in the center bridging the channel, flanked by five shorter spans on either side. The three 500-foot spans will have a clearance of 55 feet above the water at all times and the middle one will lift 95 feet to give a total clearance of 150 feet for the passage of large ships. It is expected that the bridge will be completed about August 1st, 1937. It will provide a new fast route through Brooklyn to the Rockaways as well as a new through route to the south shore of Long Island. The Marine Parkway Bridge is an important factor in the development of Marine and Jacob Riis Parks. Jacob Riis Park at the present time is being entirely remodeled by the Department of Parks and the Marine Parkway Authority working in cooperation with each other, both organizations being headed by Commissioner Robert Moses. When the reconstruction work in Jacob Riis Park is completed, large areas of low land will have been reclaimed, a 72-acre parking field will have been provided, the beach will be greatly enlarged and will be bordered by a promenade over the entire length. Recreation facilities will be provided along the inshore side of the promenade. New roadways to provide easy access to the parking fields and to the Rockaways will be built and the entire perk will be properly landscaped. The Marine Parkway Authority is financing their portion of the work through a $6,000,000 bond issue which was completed last December. The bonds will be amortized by the collection of a 15¢ toll on the bridge and a 25¢ parking fee. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPARTMENT OF PARKS ARSENAL, CENTRAL PARK FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE TEL.

REGENT 4-1000 June 12, 1936 Saturday, June 13, Jacob Riis Park will be opened to the public for the 1936 season. Several major changes in the development of this park have been completed or are under construction. The beach will be increased from an area of 8 acres at high tide to an area of 24.2 acres by the construction of a new seawall which curves back into the park 500 feet on the westerly half of the beach. Along the top of the new sea wall is a 44-foot promenade which, when completed, will be continuous across the whole ocean front of the park. The old dusty cinder parking space, most of which has been eliminated by the widening of the beach, will be replaced by a new concrete parking area to the north of the bathhouse. When completed, this new field will accommodate 13,600 automobiles a s compared with a capacity of 3,800 cars in the old field. When the park is opened much of this work will be going on and will continue through most of the summer. All of the new beach area south of the present roadway has been completed and is ready for use. During the summer the road west of the bathhouse will be diverted to the north and the balance of the new beach will then be completed. The promenade along the back of the beach will not be ready for use until later in the season and, although the available parking space at present is somewhat smaller than the old area, its size is increasing daily at the rate of one-third of an acre. Although construction will be going on in the park during the summer the bathhouse, parking field, and beach will not be affected and there will be no serious interference with the public on account of construction operations. The construction of the sea wall, promenade, and concrete surface of the parking field is all being done with relief labor. The clean white sand used to enlarge the beach and fill the parking area is being pumped from the bottom of Jamaica Bay under a contract let by the Marine Parkway Authority. June 24 the Authority will take bids for the construction of a bridge across Rockaway Inlet from the foot of Flatbush Avenue to Jacob Riis Park. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPARTMENT OF PARKS ARSENAL, CENTRAL PARK FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE TEL. REGENT 4-1000 June 11, 1936 Recently Congress passed an appropriation of $129,000,000 to be spent through the War Department for the improvement of rivers and harbors and among the projects included in this appropriation was the staightening of the Harlem River between the Hudson River and Broadway. Some years ago the state acquired the land necessary for this straightening and made the land available for the use of the federal government. One of the provsions made at that time was that at such time as the channel was relocated, the land under water now under the Jurisdiction of the federal govermnent in the old channel could be turned over to the City of New York for the use of the Department of Parks. Upon the completion of this work the Department of Parks will have reclaimed and added an area of approximately 24 acres to the north end of Isham and Inwood Hill Parks. The Department has announced that th«y are taking bids on July 7, 1936, for the removal of approximately 869,000 cubic yards of earth and 214,000 cubic yards of ledge rock to be removed during the next year. It is planned that this material will be removed and placed in the area to be added to Isham and Inwood Hill parka. A method has been worked out whereby the old channel may be kept open while the new channel is being constructed. Upon the completion of the reclamation in the new area, the Park Department will have provided the public with a new yacht basin capable of caring for well over 100 boats. Adjacent to the yacht basin will be a new clubhouse and roadways and a parking area capable of taking care of 300 cars. There will be a large additional recreational area including a baseball diamond. The whole plan is pleasing in appeaxanee, will be well landscaped and amply provided with walks and roadways. It is anticipated that these additional park facllities be subjected to intense use. The entire development with its easy accessibility to the crowded sections at the north end of Manhattan and the Bronx should be an improvement of the utmost importance to the large population of this urea. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPARTMENT OF PARKS ARSENAL, CENTRAL PARK FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE TEL.

REGENT 4-1000 June 2, 1936 UNVEILING OF BUST OF JOHN WOLFE AMBROSE The Department of Parks announces the unveiling of the Bust of John Wolfe Ambrose, June 3rd, 3 P. M. at Battery Park. Mayor La Guardia, Commissioner Moses, Rev, Dr. Ralph Sockman, Mr. George A. Voss and Mr. Edgar A. Martin will speak, and among the invited guests are representatives of the Navy, the Coest Guard, the Steamship Companies, the Port Authorities of New York and New Jersey, the Department of Commerce, the Municipal Art Commission, the Merchants Association and other interested organizations. Mrs. George Frederick Shrady, Mr. Ambrose's daughter will unveil the bust, which is placed in a niche in a monument constructed against the wall of the Aquarium and overlooks the deep sea channel which bears his name. Friends and associates presented the bust to his family. John Wolfe Ambrose was born January 10th, 1838, at New Castle, Ireland, and came to the United States with his parents as a child. Although obliged to earn his living at an early age, he prepared himself for college and entered New York University, later going to Princeton University, to prepare himself for the ministry. On completion of his college course in 1860, he changed his plans, taking up newspaper work as a member of the staff of the official organ of the Citizens' Association, one of the first civic organizations devoted to municipal reform. Later in his business career, Mr. Ambrose engaged in construction work on a large scale, and among his many accomplishments in this line were the building of the Second Avenue Elevated road, the Sixth Avenue Elevated road, from 72nd Street to 158th Street, the laying of the first pneumatic tubes for the Western Union Telegraph Company and the construction of numerous uptown streets, particularly in the Harlem section. In 1880 he became interested in the development of the Brooklyn waterfront properties. He was the organizer and president of the Brooklyn Wharf and Dry Dock Company, and the founder of the 39th Street South Brooklyn Ferry. Soon after the formation of the companies his attention was directed to the inadequate channels of the port of New York, especially along the Brooklyn shore. The long stretch from 28th Street to 65th Street, South Brooklyn, which today is a busy center of shipping representing investments of hundreds of millions of dollars, was an undeveloped swamp section, the shore line a succession of mud flats, with an average depth of eight feet at high tide, With prophetic vision, Mr. Ambrose recognized in advance of his fellows the dangers of New York being handicapped through inability to supply port accommodations to ships with a draft exceeding 18 feet. He first went to Washington in 1881 to ask appropriations for New York Harbor, and bent all his energies to the education and conversion of successive River and Hasbor Committees so that they would fully understand the pressing needs of New York in this respect. From 1881 to 1896 successive appropriations were obtained for the Bay Ridge and Red Hook Channels, making them 1000 feet wide and 40 feet deep where formerly they had been 8 feet. To his indefatigable initial efforts is directly due the great development which in recent years has taken place on the Bay Ridge water front, when he had secured the necessary appropriations for upper New York Bay, he turned his attention to the ocean approaches to the harbor. He felt that to properly impress Congress with the necessity of granting permission for a real deep sea channel was a work of such magnitude that no effort should be spared. He, therefore, organized a large delegation composed of prominent and representative citizens from the Chamber of Commerce, the Produce and Maritime Exchanges, the Board of Marine Underwriters, and the Merchants' Association, of which he was a director and which he represented. On December 22nd, 1898, the delegation appeared before the River and Harbor Committee of the House of Representatives, strongly and extensively advocating a channel 2000 feet wide end 40 feet deep. Mr. Ambrose made the principal address on this occasion. Notwithstanding the intrinsic merits of New York's claims in this matter, which meant larger vessels and reduced rates to producer and consumer, the Committee of the House of Representatives absolutely denied the plea of the petitioners, end cut the appropriation fron the River and Harbor bill. Mr. Ambrose then appeared alone before the Committee on Commerce of the United States Senate, and secured the appropriation, which gave Now York a suitable approach to its magnificent harbor. He died without seeing the fruition of that for which he had labored so long and unselfishly. In 1901-2 Congress passed a bill naming the Channel after him. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPARTMENT OF PARKS ARSENAL, CENTRAL PARK FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE TEL. REGENT 4-1000 May 27, 1936 The Department of Parks received bids this afternoon for a contract for the general grading of Flushing Meadow Park, as the first step toward the development of this park, which is the site of the 1939 World's Fair. The Board of Estimate and Apportionment on May first approved the form of contract for this work and authorized the Commissioner of Parks to proceed to take bids. This is the first contract to be let by the City for the improvement of this area, although approximately three and a half million dollars has already been expended by the State in grading, paving and the erection of bridges on the Grand Central Parkway Extension, which forms the westerly boundary of this park between Kow Gardens and Flushing Bay, and connects with the Triborough Bridge Approach. This contract calls for the moving of seven million cubic yards of material, all of which is available at the site. Six million cubic yards of the available material consists of ashes located in the old Brooklyn ash disposal dump located just south of the Long Island Railroad in Corona. This property was acquired by the City in connection with the settlement of a contract held by the Brooklyn Ash Removal Company for the disposal of refuse collected in the borough of Brooklyn and represents waste material accumulated over a period of thirty years. This contract will eliminate the ash dump which has been an eyesore in this community for years and will create a park of over a thousand acres in the geographical and population center of the city. In addition to the six million cubic yards from the ash disposal dump, there is approximately one million yards to be excavated from the center of the southerly section of the park to form two lakes which will remain the main features of the park development south of Nassau Boulevard. The work under this contract will be completed on April 1, 1937, when construction can start on the development of the World's Fair structures. There wore seven bids received, ranging from a low bid of $1,843,775 to a high bid of $2,631,800. The three low bids are listed below: D. M. W . Contracting Co., Inc. 1,843,775 S. J .

REGENT 4-1000 May 18, 1936 the Department of Parks is planning construction of bicycle paths la the City Park system to meet the growing demand for this form of recreation. Bicycling is sot only popular with growing boys and girls, thousands of mature men and women derive pleasure from this form of exercise. The use of City streets and boulevards for bicycling is dangerous to the bicyclist and the use of walks in the parks dangerous to the pedestrian. The recent designation of the closed driveway west of the Mall in Central Park one morning eaah week demonstrated that bicycling paths are needed. This particular area has been used for roller skating for two years and is now being resurfaced to add bicycling, restricted to two outside ten foot lanes. The two inside lanes will be resurfaced for roller skating. Both facilities will be used at the same time and Park recreation employees will be assigned to maintain order and move traffic In one way lanes. Plans are being prepared by the Park Department to provide a bicycle path along the Harlem River Speedway which will not interfere with pedestrians and which will have no grade crossings. Another path is being planned in the northerly section of Hillside Park in Queens. The construction of a bicycle path on the center strip of the Pelham parkway is being designed and another path is being laid out along Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. Facilities for bicycling are also included in the reconstruction of Riverside Park in connection with the West Side Improvement. If men and materials are available from relief funds these new facilities will be developed after July 1st, where the oonstruction of the Park Department's program of playgrounds, swimming pools, golf courses and beaches is completed. - END - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPARTMENT OF PARKS ARSENAL, CENTRAL PARK FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE TEL.

PROGRAM Planting of tree seeds and trees by the children Address by child ------ Value of trees Recitation by child --- Tree Mutilation \" \" \" --- Woodman Spare That Tree, With a little history of this poem. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE VALUE OF TREES Whether you live in the country with trees overshadowing your doorstep or near a city park, it is fitting this day, to give a thought to trees, those silent friends whose value and beauty contribute so much toward our happiness and comfort. Their beauty in spring, summer and autumn is but a part they play in the general scheme of our lives. Pencils and paper, desks and doors, houses and floors, all these things and hundreds more depend upon our forests. Without trees, we could not have them. Do you know that 160 million trees are cut down every year for various uses? One billion lead pencils are used each year. It takes 160 acres of spruce trees to make the paper for a large, Sunday edition of a newspaper. Planting trees and giving them protection is true conservation. HISTORY OF POEM \"WOODMAN SPARE THAT TREE\" The history of the writing of this poem by Geo. P. Morris, the author, was explained in a letter to a friend by Mr. Morris in 1837. Mr, Morris was riding in the country with an old gentleman who asked him to turn down a little country lane, to look at an old tree which was planted by his grandfather, near the doorstep of the house in which he was born. He had many recollections about this old tree and always remembered it as an old friend. As they neared the tree, they saw before it a man with his coat off and sharpening an ax. You're not going to cut down this tree the old gentleman asked? -- Yes but I am, the old woodman said. I want that tree for firewood. It is worth $10.00. The old man then said, if I give you $10.00 will you let it stand? The woodman agreed and a bond was drawn up and signed by the three men, to spare that tree. This impressed Mr. Morris, the author, who then wrote the poem, WOODMAN SPARE THAT TREE. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"WOODMAN SPAHE THAT TREE\" Geo. P. Morris Woodman, Spare that tree! Touch not a single bough! In youth it sheltered me, And I'll protect it now. 'T was my forefather's hand That placed it near my cot; There, woodman let it stand, Thy axe shall harm it not My heart-strings 'round thee cling, Close as thy bark, old friend Here shall the wild bird sing, And still thy branches bend. Old tree, the storm still brave And woodman, leave the spot; While I've a hand to save, Thy axe shall harm it not. MUTILATION By Ann Williams I wonder if I shall ever see, A lovely, stately white birch tree, Whose bark has not been marred by hand, Leaving an ugly, dark red band. Along the highway, or in a park, Each beautiful birch has lost some bark, Disfigured for life it stands apart, Drooping as with a broken heart. We are given eyes that we might see, The beauty of each lovely tree; Yet thoughtless people leave a scar, That shows unsightly from afar. God never meant for you or me, To injure or abuse a tree; A kindly thought we each should give, To every tree,--and help it live. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPARTMENT OF PARKS ARSENAL, CENTRAL PARK FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE TEL. REGENT 4-1000 April 18, 1936 Two identical statues of stainless steel will be erected in the near future on the promenade of the Astoria swimming Pool in the Borough of Queens. The figures, each sixteen feet high, are the first pieces of three-dimensional sculpture of any considerable size to be executed in stainless steel and are the result of nearly two years of planning and experimental work by the Department of Parks. They were designed by Emil Siebern and executed by sheet metal workers under the direction of Thomas Roberts, representing a collaboration of architects, sculptors and artisans. As the limitations of steel had to be kept in mind when making the models, the shapes and forms were developed along modern lines. Stainless steel is not only fitted to harmonize with the architectural features of the Bath House, but its cost is less than that of bronze, marble or any of the other materials usually associated with sculpture. As the statues are a new departure in this field, the method, of assembling them is of particular interest. After the full size models were completed, preliminary paper patterns, similar to those used by dressmakers, were made and fitted to them. The paper patterns were then copied in zinc and eventually in galvanized iron. This stage of the work had to be executed with the utmost attention to detail as each figure consists of one hundred and twenty five separate pieces which had to be assembled with the greatest accuracy. Once the metal patterns were completed and carefully fitted to each other, the final work was cut in stainless steel by means of electric shears specially designed to overcome the unusual toughness of the material. The next stage was to construct a system of reinforcement inside the figures to counteract the wind pressure which would be exerted on their sixteen feet of height. The pieces were welded together, using a special alloy so as not to break down the rust resisting qualities of the metal through overheating. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPARTMENT OF PARKS ARSENAL, CENTRAL PARK APRIL 14th, 1936.
