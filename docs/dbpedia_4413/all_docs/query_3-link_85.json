Starting Friday, Jan. 27, from 10 p.m. through Saturday morning, Jan. 28, at 5 a.m., there will be several planned intermittent full closures at Throggs Neck Bridge. Each closure will last approximately 20 minutes. Motorists should plan for additional travel time or consider using the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge as an alternate route.\n\nIn addition, NYSDOT officials said there will be some changes to traffic flow on the Major Deegan Expressway (MDE). The department advises motorists of long-term, right travel lane closures on the southbound MDE (I-87) in the vicinity of Exit 3 (East 138th Street/Madison Avenue Bridge) and on northbound MDE in the vicinity of Exit 3 (Grand Concourse/East 138th Street) in the Bronx through approximately fall of 2024.\n\nVariable Message Signs (VMS) will be in place to alert motorists of these closures. Motorists are also advised that inclement weather could cause the start of these closures to be rescheduled. The closures are needed to facilitate work on NYSDOT’s $47 million project to replace the 80-year-old bridge carrying East 138th Street over the MDE.\n\nMotorists are urged to slow down and drive responsibly in work zones. Fines are doubled for speeding in a work zone. Convictions of two or more speeding violations in a work zone could result in the suspension of an individual’s driver license.\n\nNYSDOT further advises motorists of changes in traffic patterns on the southbound and northbound MDE (I-87) between Exit 5 (East 161st Street/Macombs Dam Bridge) and Exit 7 (Cross Bronx Expressway/New Haven/Trenton) in The Bronx. DOT officials said these changes in traffic patterns and long-term closure are needed to facilitate work on NYSDOT’s $119 million MDE rehabilitation project, which is reconstructing the MDE in both directions between Exit 5 and Exit 7.\n\nSouthbound: All travel lanes will be shifted to the left of the work zone, on through approximately the end of 2022. (We await further updates from NYSDOT on this project).\n\nNorthbound: All travel lanes will provide access to northbound and southbound I-95 and northbound I-87. The right northbound travel lane will be shifted to Sedgwick Avenue, which will provide access to the I-95, local streets, and I-87 via local streets. This change in traffic pattern will take place through approximately the end of 2022. (We await further updates from NYSDOT on this project).\n\nMotorists are urged to slow down and drive responsibly in work zones. Fines are doubled for speeding in a work zone. Convictions of two or more speeding violations in a work zone could result in the suspension of an individual’s driver license.\n\nBetter Buses Transit & Safety Improvements\n\nNYC Department of Transportation (DOT) began Better Buses transit and safety improvements on University Avenue from Tremont Avenue to Kingsbridge Road in The Bronx in the Fall of 2022.
