        "text": "A few years ago, a Google app on my phone offered to navigate me to “work.” I didn’t know what to make of that, because my office is in my house, so I clicked the tab and discovered that Google had deduced, based on how I spend my time during a typical week, that I must work at 10 Golf Course Road—the address of my golf club. Google must also think I get laid off every winter, because between early December and early April I hardly ever go to the club. I live up in the hills in western Connecticut, a hundred miles north of New York, and our course almost always shuts down within a week or two of Thanksgiving.\n\nThat doesn’t mean I quit playing, however. My friends and I spend hours every winter searching the Web for open courses within plausible driving distance of where we live. Playing golf is the best way to survive the emotionally difficult period between one golf season and the next; it’s also a useful distraction when there are bigger things to worry about. John Updike, who was an avid golfer virtually his entire adult life, once described his regular weekend rounds as “islands of bliss”; I feel the same way.\n\nOccasionally, I’ve been lucky enough to take wintertime golf trips to places like Arizona, South Carolina, Florida, and New Zealand. Most years, though, I play closer to home. On January 1, 2009, two friends and I celebrated the new year by spending two days on a golf course just outside of Atlantic City, which is a four-hour drive from our town. I wore two pairs of gloves, plus a knit cap on top of a baseball cap on top of a skier’s balaclava, and on both days the three of us were the only players on the course—a great old one, where the ShopRite L.P.G.A. Classic is held every spring.\n\nMost winters, we’re able to find real grass even closer to where we live—as I wrote in a New Yorker article in 2005. One Sunday last month, for example, twelve of us escaped lousy weather in Connecticut by driving to Pelham Bay Golf Course, in Pelham Bay Park, in the Bronx. Pelham is one of fourteen courses owned by New York City, and, like all but one of those courses, it stays open through the winter except when the ground is covered with snow. Playing the city’s courses during the summer can be frustrating, because, even though fourteen courses sounds like a lot to a non-golfer, it’s actually nowhere near enough for a city the size of New York. (It works out to more than thirty thousand residents per hole.) But the crowds thin out, sometimes by a lot, when the weather turns crummy. A few years ago, four of us played Pelham on a day when the temperature was so far below freezing that for a long time our car was the only one in the vast parking lot. When we went in to pay, the kid behind the counter in the golf shop told us that we couldn’t tee off yet because of a “frost delay.” But after ten or fifteen minutes he let us go.\n\nPelham Bay was built in 1898, when golf in the United States was still almost brand-new. (America’s first public golf course—in Van Cortlandt Park, also in the Bronx—is just two years older.) Pelham is actually one of two courses in Pelham Bay Park: Split Rock Golf Course, on the other side of some railroad tracks, was added in 1934. Split Rock was built as part of a citywide project that was intended to create jobs during the Great Depression—and so was its clubhouse, which the two courses share. When my friends and I first played Pelham, a little more than a dozen years ago, that clubhouse was an unheated wreck, thanks to years of neglect by the Parks Department. Since then, the company that now operates both courses, on a twenty-year lease from the city, has spent millions restoring it to something very close to what it was in its Art Deco heyday—in part by removing floodlights that had been bolted to the hammered-bronze light fixtures hanging from the ceiling in the Club Room, replacing panes missing from the distinctive round windows up near the ceiling, getting rid of a drinking fountain in front of one of two basalt-and-marble fireplaces, and banishing rats.\n\nWhen even the Bronx has a snow problem, my friends and I sometimes have luck a little farther south, at Dyker Beach Golf Course, in Brooklyn. (Pelham and Dyker are just twenty miles apart, but they occupy different microclimates, since Dyker is closer to two major sources of snow-melting heat: the Atlantic Ocean and Manhattan.) We’ve played Dyker many times, including twice a couple of months after Hurricane Sandy, in early 2013. We had to avoid several enormous uprooted trees, which were encircled by police tape, but other than that the course was in terrific shape. Dyker was built in the late eighteen-nineties and reworked in 1935—part of the same citywide golf project that created Split Rock.\n\nDyker is where Tiger Woods’s father, Earl, learned to play golf, in the early nineteen-seventies. (He was stationed at Fort Hamilton, across the street.) It’s also the home course of the Shore View Golf Club, a large men’s group that was founded in 1930 and has a charter from the city. A number of years ago, the Mob rubbed out somebody near the fourteenth green the night before Shore View’s annual Father’s Day tournament, and the cops said the course would have to stay closed all day. But Shore View’s tournament chairman, a retired customs agent, persuaded them that if they simply roped off the thirteenth and fourteen holes—two long par fours that Shore View guys grumble about anyway—the golfers wouldn’t interfere with their examination of the corpse. My friends and I have never had to play around a dead body, but if we ever came across one I’m pretty sure we’d keep playing, too. There’s no helping the poor guy at this point—and tomorrow it could snow.\n\nThe only city golf course that doesn’t stay open all winter is the newest one, Trump Links at Ferry Point, which was built on top of a former landfill near the northern end of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. Ferry Point is the city’s “premium” public course; playing eighteen holes there on a weekend can cost more than two hundred dollars, which is several times the maximum in-season rate at Pelham, Split Rock, Dyker, or any other city course. Because Ferry Point is such a high-class operation—as you can tell when you grab a handful of souvenir plastic ball markers bearing Donald Trump’s coat-of-arms-like gold logo—golfers are not allowed to use pushcarts, which most of my friends and I use and which are common golf-bag conveyances on all the city’s other courses. In the summer of 2015, shortly after three friends and I had played Ferry Point, I asked Trump why he had imposed that ban. “They don’t look proper on a course like that,” he said. “You know, we’re doing a very high-level job, and we don’t want that to happen, and we don’t like the look of a pushcart,” he said. “We’re doing something special here. We’ve built something really special, to the highest levels, and everybody loves it.”\n\nTrump doesn’t own Ferry Point; like the company that manages Pelham Bay and Split Rock, he leases the course from the city, and although he was involved in the final stages of construction, he didn’t create it, despite what he sometimes suggests. Still, he has spelled \"TRUMP LINKS\" in enormous, permanent-looking letters on a grassy bank facing the bridge. “It is so amazing, and people are treating it with great respect, and it’s a phenomenal course, on top of everything,” he said. “It’s incredible. And, you know, the people on the Whitestone Bridge, they’re shouting down, ‘We love it! We love it!’ They love the sign. Everybody loves the sign, the grass sign. So we’ve had a lot of fun with it, actually. It’s been great, and it’s a great success.” It’s difficult to imagine people in cars on the Whitestone Bridge shouting loud enough to be heard half a mile away; maybe they’re like the people Trump saw cheering the fall of the World Trade Center.\n\nFerry Point was designed by a golf architect in Jack Nicklaus’s firm. It plays like a windswept Scottish or Irish links course, which it closely resembles, and it has killer views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn skylines, of the cemetery where Charles Lindbergh tried to ransom his kidnapped son, and, especially, of the bridge, which from several angles seems to rise out of the course itself. It’s hidden under snow right now; but I won’t be going back to that one, in any weather, until the end of either the lease or the lessee."
