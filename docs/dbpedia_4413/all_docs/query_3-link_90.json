        "text": "Here’s today’s Hutch Fact:\n\nHutch Fact #8:\n\nThe old expression, “out of sight, out of mind,” applies to the Hutchinson River. It’s easily the most hidden waterway in the Bronx, if not the city. Many area residents are not even aware of the Hutch, never mind strangers. There are few paths where you have access to the river. Most paths are overgrown or in disrepair. Some are makeshift. In most places, fences, walls, and commercial and residential developments prevent access.\n\nYou can catch glimpses of the Hutch as you drive along the Hutchinson River Parkway or cross one of the six bridges that span the river in the Bronx, but access to the river from these locations would be illegal and dangerous. In Westchester, except for Lake Innisfree, which was developed for recreational uses, the Hutch flows through the backyards of private residences.\n\nBecause of this inaccessability, the Hutch has been subjected to all kinds of projects that have endangered life in and along it’s waters.\n\nThe dredging of the Hutch by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to turn it into a shipping channel in the late 19th century damaged and irrevocably changed the character and the ecosystems of the Hutch.\n\nStorm and sewage conduits are continually spewing waste into the Hutch.\n\nThe commercial development of parts of the area — first, with Freedomland and then with Coop City — further compromised the Hutch.\n\nThe old Pelham landfill and dump (dubbed “Mt. Garbage” by some) on the West bank of the Hutch was used for decades by the Dept. of Sanitation until it was ordered closed in 1968. It was responsible for all types of toxic and noxious pollutants leeching into the Hutch and Eastchester Bay. These toxins were also responsible for many cases of leukemia and other diseases in nearby residents, particularly children. In 1967, the creation of the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary was signed into law to prevent any more parkland from being threatened.\n\nNow the Hutch is being threatened by rising sea levels due to climate change, and by two man-made projects: a proposal by the USACE to build a sea gate across the mouth of the Hutch, which could destroy the salt marshes, and a plan by the NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection to construct a water chlorination plant to deal with storm and sewage effluent. This could harm much of the aquatic life in the river, especially at a time when we’re just starting to revive it.\n\nThis where HRRP comes in. It’s our mission to educate the public about the Hutch’s history and importance as a vital ecosystem, to work with our communities to make the Hutch safe for recreation and nature, and to raise awareness and calls to action to prevent any further threats and damage.\n\nTomorrow, Sept. 15th 2019, we’ll be holding our 10th annual Clean Up of the Thomas Pell Sanctuary. It’s one of the most direct ways in which the public can help spread the message about this wonderous resource in our own backyard and keep it “In sight, in mind.”\n\n#RestoreTheHutch\n\nThe Hutchinson River Restoration project will be holding its 10th Annual Clean Up of the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary in Pelham Bay Park on Sunday, Sept. 15, 2018 from 9 AM — 3 PM.\n\nThe Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary is the largest salt marsh ecosystem in the Bronx and the second largest in NYC (the salt marsh in Jamaica Bay Park in Queens is the largest).\n\nThis annual event is a great way to:\n\nlearn about an important and crucial ecosystem right in our own backyard,\n\ngather with friends and neighbors to support our community,\n\ndo your part in protecting the environment,\n\nfeel a sense of accomplishment and pride,\n\nand have some good, clean(up) fun\n\nVolunteers will assemble on the southwest corner of City Island Rd. and Shore Rd., Bronx, NY (across from the Pelham Bit Stables). The BX29 bus stops right there. Gloves, waterproof shoe coverings, and light refreshments will be provided.\n\nParking will be available in the Turtle Cove Driving Range parking area on City Island Rd.\n\nFor more information, call 718.885.9653\n\nVisit our website: http://www.hutchinsonriverrestorationproject.org\n\n“Like” us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/HutchinsonRRP\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @Hutchinsonriver\n\nHashtag: #RestoreTheHutch\n\nThis project is supported by American Rivers, the American Littoral Society, and the Urban Park Rangers.\n\nAbout Salt Marshes and the Thomas Pell Sanctuary*:\n\n“Salt marshes play a critical role in the support of human life, acting as natural filtration systems by trapping pollutants that would otherwise contaminate our bays and oceans. Salt marshes have the ability to absorb fertilizers, improve water quality, and reduce erosion. They are also among the richest wildlife habitats.”\n\n“The Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary in the northeast Bronx consist of a total of 489 acres of marshes and forests within Pelham Bay Park. The City began landfill operations near this area on Tallapoosa Point in Pelham Bay Park in 1963. Plans to expand the landfills in Pelham Bay Park in 1966, which would have created the City’s second-largest refuse disposal site next to Fresh Kills in Staten Island, were met with widespread community opposition led by Councilmember Mario Merola, later Bronx District Attorney. This struggle resulted in the creation of the sanctuaries by a local law, signed by Mayor John V. Lindsay on October 11, 1967.”\n\n“The Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary makes up the westerly part of Pelham Bay Park (2,764 acres). Included within its bounds are Goose Creek Marsh and the saltwater wetlands adjoining the Hutchinson River as well as Goose Island, Split Rock, and the oak-hickory forests bordering the Split Rock Golf Course. The area is home to a variety of wildlife including raccoon, egrets, hawks, and the occasional ibis or coyote. The Sanctuary is named for Thomas Pell, the first European to control the land. Pell signed a treaty with the Siwanoy, the Native American tribe that previously occupied this area, in 1654, marking the first time a Briton owned significant property near Dutch New Amsterdam.”\n\n*courtesy of the NYC Parks Dept.\n\n[Patrick Rocchio interviewed members of HRRP for this article on the USACE plans for surge barriers, which was published just days after the article by Nathan Kensinger in Curbed New York. HRRP is getting the message out.]\n\nTHE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS DEVELOPING PLANS AS PART OF A BROADER POST-SUPERSTORM SANDY RESILIENCY DESIGN PROJECT FOR NEW YORK HARBOR\n\n‘Sea-gate’ idea possible for Hutchinson River resiliency\n\nMembers of the Hutchinson River Restoration Project are concerned about a proposal to build a 20-foot-tall concrete wall with a sea gate along the Hutchinson River near where it meets Eastchester Bay, in the vicinity of the Pelham Bridge.\n\nThe group believes that such a structure could have a drastic impact on plants and wildlife.\n\nThe HRRP maintains the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary opposite Co-op City along the river, which is in what is known as a tidal estuary where saltwater from Eastchester Bay and freshwater from the river’s origin in Westchester co-mingle with one another.\n\nThe organization’s president, Eleanor Rae, said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is looking at the possibility of the ‘sea gate’ and other concrete barriers along the river as part of a larger study of resiliency in both New York and New Jersey called the New York and New Jersey Harbor and Tributaries Focus Area Feasibility Study.\n\nThe study was commissioned after Hurricane Sandy to find resiliency solutions if another large superstorm hit the New York area.\n\nRae said that even though the completed study is expected in late 2019 or early 2020, and work on any recommended projects would be at least two to three years way, they are never the less vigilant because it remained unclear how such structures would affect ecology, plants and wildlife.\n\n“I do think this is a terribly important issue for all of us,” said Rae, who said that members of her group attended a meeting on the project in April at Hostos College.\n\nEven if a ‘sea gate’ was rarely closed for long periods of time, most in the group think it could have a major negative effect on the intermingling of water from both sources of the river, Rae and several other members said.\n\nA barrier with a gate would be necessary, said Carl Lundgren, an HRRP member, because the Hutchinson River is an active waterway for commercial barges that deliver materials further up river.\n\nLundgren and Rae both want to ensure that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is aware that the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary is part of the river and needs to be accommodated.\n\nMatthew Umbro, HHRC vice president said that a structure so large, spanning hundreds of feet in width, would have a drastic impact on what is a rather unique ecosystem, especially since even more concrete walls could be constructed elsewhere along the river, according to draft proposals.\n\n“Even the footprint on a project (this size) along the river would require clearing some of the forest and building on and through marshland,” said Umbro.\n\nUmbro said HHRC supports natural solutions to the prevent flooding.\n\nPaul Mankiewicz, a biologist from City Island, said that a combination of plants and marshes (natural barriers), along with seawalls, could stop water.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Michael Embrich, said these ideas are just concepts at this point.\n\nThe corps is currently in the process of culling options, and taking a look at the fiscal and environmental implications of proposals, before submitting a final report.\n\n“We will be looking at and working with our partners to find engineering solutions, as we have done for hundreds of years,” said Embrich.\n\nAny comments or questions can be addressed to nynjharbortribstudy@usace.army.mil\n\nReach Reporter Patrick Rocchio at (718) 260–4597.
