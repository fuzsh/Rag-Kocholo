        "text": "Construction is coming together on the High Line Moynihan Connector, a nearly 1,200-foot-long extension of the High Line linking the elevated park with the five-building Manhattan West complex in Midtown West. Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and James Corner Field Operations and developed in a public-private partnership between Empire State Development (ESD), Friends of the High Line, and Brookfield Properties, the $50 million project consists of two 600-foot-long ADA-accessible bridges and will allow for easier access to Moynihan Train Hall and Penn Station. Turner Construction Company is the general contractor for the walkway, which runs along West 30th Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues and turns to the north at Dyer Avenue to connect to the elevated southwestern corner of the Manhattan West plaza above West 31st Street.\n\nRecent photos show the Timber Bridge being assembled alongside the steel bridge on West 30th Street, which has been largely completed since our last update in June and populated with an abundance of greenery. Once fully assembled, the truss bridge will be hoisted and rotated 90 degrees to join with Manhattan West’s Magnolia Court plaza.\n\nClose-up shots show the details in the Timber Bridge, which features an open-air truss system made of sustainably sourced wood and lined with steel decking and bronze handrails.\n\nThe below photo shows a gap in the plaza railing where the bridge will connect.\n\nThe following map shows the High Line Moynihan Connector in orange dashes. The bridges will greatly aid in the flow of pedestrians around Hudson Yards, Manhattan West, and the Penn District, a corridor that is rapidly evolving with new construction and adaptive reuse of old buildings.\n\nThe High Line Moynihan Connector is anticipated to be completed later this spring."
