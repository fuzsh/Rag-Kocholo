        "text": "The majestically moldering Bronx stations of the old New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad are, in the words of one architectural historian, like a broken string of pearls. Some have been lost, while “others are being slowly crushed by the boot of time.”\n\nOnly three of the stations, built in 1908 to designs by Cass Gilbert and shuttered in 1937, survive with their roofs intact; a fourth lies in picturesque ruins in the woods surrounded by Pelham Bay Park.\n\nBut after decades of malign neglect, two beguiling stations in the South Bronx are now the subjects of an ambitious effort to bring them back to life in new ways. One is envisioned as a for-profit events venue and the other as a combined community space and grand entrance to a city park. While the projects are very different, both aim to polish up an antique architectural gem to bring renewed vigor to a geographically strategic site in a down-at-the-heels section of the Bronx.\n\nIn 1904, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, known as “the Consolidated” because of all the railroads it had swallowed up, initiated a major upgrade of its Harlem River Branch, from its Harlem River terminal in the South Bronx up to New Rochelle, in Westchester County. The line was expanded from two tracks to six, and 13 architecturally distinguished stations were planned."
