        "text": "THE ORIGINAL PARKWAY: In 1924, the Westchester County Parks Commission recommended construction of a new north-south parkway in the eastern part of the county. At that time, Boston Post Road (which became US 1 in 1926), the primary north-south route along Long Island Sound between New York City and New England, had become clogged with automobile and truck traffic seven days a week. Moreover, the rapid growth of Mount Vernon, Pelham, New Rochelle, Eastchester and Port Chester threatened the water supply of these communities. Preservation of right-of-way for a parkway along the Hutchinson River would offer relief along US 1 by providing a faster, more scenic route for automobiles. It would also furnish parks for local residents and protect water supplies.\n\nFrom the Westchester County Parks Commission Report written in 1927:\n\nThe lands acquired embrace a well-developed park area, forming a valuable local expansion of the Hutchinson River Parkway while providing a scenic location for the parkway.\n\nConstruction of the Hutchinson River Parkway began in 1924. In December 1927, workers completed a short two-mile section of the parkway in Pelham. The section included a new multiple-arch stone bridge to carry the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (Metro-North New Haven line) over the Hutchinson River Parkway and the adjacent river. Prior to construction of the parkway, the railroad had been on a solid embankment. The bridge was constructed underneath the embankment.\n\nBy October 1928, an 11-mile section of parkway was completed between US 1 in Pelham and Westchester Avenue in White Plains. Upon completion, the new parkway served mostly local traffic within Westchester County. The parkway complied with the design standards of the era, with four 9-foot-wide travel lanes and a 40 MPH design speed. It did not have median separation, shoulders or acceleration-deceleration lanes. The entire 11 miles of parkway, which included bridle paths along the right-of-way, as well as a riding academy where the public could rent horses, cost $12 million to build.\n\nNevertheless, the design of the parkway was incompatible with the greater traffic demands and higher speeds of the postwar era. At 30 locations, the horizontal curvature exceeded the maximum desirable 3.5-degree limit, and at 27 locations, the gradient exceeded the maximum desirable four-percent limit. The absence of shoulders and acceleration-deceleration lanes not only created traffic bottlenecks, but was also a cause of accidents.\n\nINITIAL EXPANSION ATTEMPTS (1953-1972): By the early 1950s, the Hutchinson River Parkway carried approximately 30,000 vehicles per day (AADT), twice the number of vehicles that used the parkway in 1945. Traffic studies found that the parkway \"reasonably safe for operating speeds of only about 25 MPH,\" and that traffic was expected to double again by 1958. To address the growing traffic demands and high accident rates on the parkway, the Westchester County Planning Department and the Westchester County Parks Commission devised the following four plans:\n\nPLAN W: This plan raised the possibility of constructing a new parkway on a new right-of-way between the existing Hutchinson River Parkway and the New England Thruway (I-95). Due to the high cost of right-of-way acquisition and attendant possibility of community opposition, this solution was discarded immediately as unwarranted until full use had been made of the existing parkway right-of-way. No cost estimate was provided for this plan.\n\nPLAN X: Under the \"parkway reconstruction\" alternative, new lanes and bridges would be added to the existing parkway to provide eight 12-foot-wide lanes and ten-foot-wide shoulders from the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge north to Westchester Avenue, and six 12-foot-wide lanes and ten-foot-wide shoulders from Westchester Avenue to the Merritt Parkway. (Provisions would be made to increase the six-lane section to eight lanes when required.) To prevent weaving, a divider strip would be placed on eight-lane sections (in effect creating collector-distributor roads). Alignment and profile changes would be made along the existing right-of-way where horizontal and vertical sight distances were limited. Most existing stone-arch bridges would be preserved; parallel bridges with identical design would be constructed. Pavements on both the new and existing roadways would be constructed to modern standards. To permit a 60 MPH design speed on the main roadway, shoulders and acceleration-deceleration lanes would be added, and entrance-exit ramps would be reconstructed to permit safe operation at 40 MPH. Finally, landscaping, lighting and signing would be revised. This plan was estimated to cost $36 million.\n\nPLAN Y: Under the \"fairly extensive adjustment\" alternative, a non-traversable barrier, resurfacing and ten-foot-wide shoulders would be added to the parkway. Some profile and alignment changes would be made, and some interchange ramps would be reconstructed, but no increase in the number of traffic lanes would be provided. These design changes would only permit a design speed of 50 MPH. This plan was estimated to cost $11 million.\n\nPLAN Z: The \"minimum adjustment\" alternative includes resurfacing, construction of shoulders and center barricades, but minimizes adjustment to parkway alignment, profile and interchanges. These design changes would only permit a design speed of 30 MPH. This plan was estimated to cost $8 million.\n\nThe 1953 \"Report on the Reconstruction and Improvement of the Hutchinson River Parkway\" recommended the implementation of the \"Plan X\" reconstruction alternative by stating the following:\n\nThe design of the Hutchinson River Parkway is so inadequate for modern day traffic throughout most of its length that the reconstruction of spot locations of greatest deficiency, such as where sharp curves or limited sight distances are encountered, would prove ineffective in reducing accidents and congestion. The widths of the existing grade separations will not permit widening of the roadway to provide more lanes, adequate shoulders and median widths. The practical capacity of the present four lanes is already exceeded. For these reasons, the minor improvements seem economically impracticable.\n\nThe reconstruction was originally scheduled for completion by 1956, but by 1961, when a new state agency - the East Hudson Parkway Authority - took over the parkway, not much had been done through Westchester County except for the addition of a median strip.\n\nIn its 1962 report Regional Highways: Status Report, the Tri-State Transportation Commission recommended a modified form \"Plan X.\" Unlike the earlier plan, the Commission advocated upgrading the road to expressway standards from the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287) south to the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. The \"Hutchinson River Expressway\" was to permit use by trucks and buses.\n\nUltimately, only a short section from the \"Bruckner interchange\" south to the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge was upgraded to expressway standards as part of I-678. This short upgrade, which widened the road to eight lanes and reconstructed bridges, was completed in 1972. Plans for an extended upgrade were canceled after the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) denied New York's application to extend I-678 north to I-95 near the Bronx-Westchester border. (This section was referred in 1970 documents as the \"Co-Op City Bypass.\")\n\nThe Westchester County Parks Commission, which still maintained the linear park along the road, recommended a $73 million proposal that would widen the parkway to six lanes for 7.4 miles between EXIT 15 (Cross County Parkway) in Bronxville and EXIT 26 (I-287 / I-684 interchange) in Harrison. The NYSDOT offered its own scaled-down $55 million plan, which kept the parkway at four lanes but had wider sections at key interchanges.\n\nDuring contentious meetings held during the summer of 1982, community leaders along the route of the parkway opposed the six-lane expansion, arguing that the widening would bring increased traffic, noise and pollution. Ultimately, the expansion was limited to the area around the I-287 / I-684 interchange, and the area around the Cross County Parkway.\n\nDouglas A. Willinger of the Takoma Park Highway Design Studio, a misc.transport.road contributor and former Westchester County resident, recalls the debate as follows:\n\nThere are only two segments of the Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester that are more than four lanes. One is at its meeting with the northern spur of the Cross County Parkway in Bronxville. The other is at the intersection of the Hutch with the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287) and I-684 in White Plains.\n\nThere is a third segment, at the interchange with Mamaroneck Avenue, which has six paved lanes. However, only four lanes are in use. This was from the 1984-1985 construction, following the 1982 decision to widen the Hutch to six lanes (three each way) from Mamaroneck Ave to I-287. The NYSDOT proposed this in 1982 to widen the Hutch south of Mamaroneck Avenue. I attended the 1982 public hearing on the project, which was held at New Rochelle High School. Most of the people in attendance were from the New Rochelle-Scarsdale area that would have been affected by the expansion, and they opposed capacity expansion from four to six lanes.\n\nIn 1985 a Dr. Liebret moved to Harrison and started a movement to stop the six-lane Hutch north of Mamaroneck Avenue and won (around 1987-1988). However, because his group focused too exclusively upon the number of lanes, NYSDOT successfully put through what was the six-lane road (built 1990-1991), minus the extra pavement, but with the necessary second stone-faced arch bridge.\n\nIn one sense the Hutch is six lanes in the vicinity of I-287, specifically at its approach to I-287, opening up with additional lanes to run beneath the I-287 overpass to four lanes each way for the left split for I-684, and the right split for the remaining, unreconstructed Hutch. The latter leads directly to Connecticut's Merritt Parkway.\n\nThe Hutchinson River Parkway could be upgraded with extra capacity in a tasteful manner by building duplicate stone-faced concrete arch bridges. This would allow the existing bridges to span one direction of traffic, while the new bridges would span the other direction, as has been done with the 1990-1991 reconstruction of the Hutch in Harrison, just south of the interchange with I-287. However, allowing heavy trucks would be another matter. The existing overpasses are too low (9 feet to 13 feet), to say nothing of the local opposition such a plan would almost certainly bring.\n\nIn 1984, the NYSDOT began a decade-long reconstruction of the Hutchinson River Parkway. Horizontal and vertical sight distances were improved, curves were straightened, acceleration and deceleration lanes were lengthened, and other safety improvements were made. To accommodate these improvements, two exits - EXIT 11 (Sparks Avenue) in Pelham and EXIT 24 (West Street) in Harrison - were eliminated. The reconstruction project was completed on October 31, 1994, when the 25-cent Pelham Manor toll plaza between EXIT 7 (US 1 / Boston Post Road) and EXIT 8 (Sanford Boulevard) was removed.\n\nThey did more than remove a few trees, they cut down hundreds, effectively removing the canopy effect that that section of the parkway used to have. It looks like they're doing the same thing to this section of the pkwy that they did to the section between I-287 and the Cross County over the past ten years. The widening project will kill the aesthetics of the road, but was long overdue because it will eliminate the parkway's dangerous hairpin curves. Nevertheless, I just hope this little project doesn't give ConnDOT any ideas about the Merritt.\n\nDouglas A. Willinger had the following observation about the improvement project:\n\nHaving just recently visited my family's home in Westchester County, I took a look at the ongoing reconstruction of the Hutchinson River Parkway from I-287 north to the Connecticut state line. One local road that crosses over the Hutch with a single arch, is being supplemented with a new stoned faced concrete bridge. However, this new bridge features not one but two separate arches, in a style different than the existing single arch that has carried both directions of the Hutch. Additionally, these two new separate \"arches\" are narrower than the existing arch, each barely wide enough for two lanes apiece.\n\nWhy would the NYSDOT be constructing such a bridge in a non-matching architectural style? Do they intend to run each direction of the Hutch via one of the new narrower \"arches\", or the southbound lanes under one arch, while leaving the northbound lanes under the existing arch? Or do they even intend to maintain the existing larger arch bridge (e.g., tearing it down)?\n\nJim Mearkle, a civil engineer with the NYSDOT, responded as follows:\n\n(The Ridge Street over the HRP is) not a parallel span; it's a replacement. The new cross section of the Hutch is considerably wider than the old section, and wouldn't fit beneath the old structure. It was decided to demolish the old span, and replace it with a two-span structure with a pier in the median.\n\nBefore the $38 million project was completed in March 2002, northbound traffic utilized the existing roadway, while southbound traffic was diverted to the new roadway. The two new carriageways are both built to contemporary design standards, featuring two 12-foot-wide lanes and ten-foot-wide shoulders in each direction, standard acceleration and deceleration lanes, and improved sight lines.\n\nMoving toward the southern terminus of the parkway, the NYSDOT recently completed a $155 million, three-year-long reconstruction of the \"Bruckner interchange\" with the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95 / I-295) and the Bruckner Expressway (I-278 / I-95). The work, which involved reconstructing 14 ramps and bridge structures, installing new drainage and electrical systems, and placing new guardrails and signs, was completed in June 2002, nearly one year ahead of schedule. Included in the project was the repaving of the Hutchinson River \"expressway\" approach (I-678) to the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.\n\nThrough the end of the decade, the NYSDOT and the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council have scheduled the following projects on the Hutchinson River Parkway:\n\nThe NYSDOT impletmetned ITS improvements along the length of the parkway in Westchester County. The $7 million project was completed in 2004.\n\nReconstruction of the Hutchinson River Parkway through the Bronx, completed in 2005. This project, which includes safety and efficiency improvements such as improved guardrails, lighting and signing, cost $70 million. It also includes the reconstruction of the East Tremont Avenue bridge over the parkway. (In the Bronx, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) maintains the Hutchinson River Parkway, and the New York City Parks Department maintains surrounding rights-of-way. Major reconstruction work is undertaken by the NYSDOT, which also installs signs and reference markers.)\n\nAccording to the NYSDOT, the Hutchinson River Parkway handles approximately 110,000 vehicles per day (AADT) through the borough of the Bronx, approximately 95,000 vehicles per day from the Bronx-Westchester border north to the I-287 / I-684 interchange in Harrison, and approximately 50,000 vehicles per day from the I-287 / I-684 interchange north to the Merritt Parkway (CT 15)."
