        "text": "Located north of Orchard Beach in the Bronx, Hunter Island contains many noteworthy geological features including glacial erratics that were deposited during the last ice age nearly 15,000 years ago.\n\nThe Siwanoy Indians, who originally occupied the island, called it Lap-Haa-Waach King, meaning “place of stringing beads,” after the shells they strung together and used for ceremony and currency.\n\nIn 1654, they sold the land to Thomas Pell (c.1610-1669), for whom Pelham Bay Park is named, and it was called Pell’s Island, and then Pelican Island, until 1804 when John Hunter bought the island for $40,000. He cultivated the land, creating a magnificent garden and mansion.\n\nI first visited Hunter Island to search for owls a few years ago. In the process of trying to find those elusive owls, I discovered a hidden gem in the Bronx. I did eventually find those owls, but have been back numerous times to explore the myriad of trails that snake through this island.\n\nThe only official trail here is the Kazimiroff Nature Trail, in honor of Dr. Theodore Kazimiroff (1914-1980).\n\nKazimiroff dedicated much of his work to the exploration and preservation of Pelham Bay Park. There are numerous other unmarked trails that lead in all directions. With 138 acres to explore, there is enough ground to cover to keep you busy for a few hours. I decided that I would walk the “official” trail and meander throughout the rest of the island. Although we did retrace our steps several times, it was mostly a loop.\n\nAfter parking in the Orchard Beach lot on a rainy Sunday morning, we headed out on the unpaved park road toward the trailhead. It was a little swampy at the start of the trail as we began on the Kazimiroff Nature Trail.\n\nThere are numerous spur trails that lead toward the water’s edge and we encountered one almost immediately. This spur trail left us standing directly across from Two Tree Island, named after Joe Two Trees, an Algonquin Indian that lived in Pelham Bay Park and befriended and inspired a then-10-year-old Theodore Kazimiroff.\n\nHunter Island was at one time connected to West Twin Island via a man-made stone bridge that now lies in ruins in one of the city’s few remaining salt marshes.\n\nAfter taking in the view, we walked back to the main trail, turned right and veered left at fork, following the blue arrows which lead into the forest. The right fork would be our return route.\n\nThe first part of the trail is easy to follow and the posts with arrows indicate which direction to go in order to stay on the trail. Following the blue arrows takes you on the outer loop, which is the route we took.\n\nWe turned right and began walking on what was once the road that connected Mr. Hunter’s estate to the mainland. At this point, the posts with the directional arrows are no longer visible. They have either been removed or perhaps fallen down. There are blue splotches on trees which I didn’t deem reliable at the time, but did lead the right way.\n\nWe came to a T-intersection and turned left to continue on the original road to the mainland, which now headed west along the water.\n\nWe came to a rock outcrop on the northwestern section of the island.\n\nWe walked to the tip of the island and looking west, I saw a giant boulder. Doing research for this post, I discovered that it is called the Gray Mare. The Native Americans reportedly believed that their God or guardian intentionally placed the Grey Mare at that spot and it was a very important Siwanoy ritual site.\n\nWe then retraced our steps back to the fork and veered left reconnecting with the main trail. Just up on the left, a short spur trail leads to my favorite spot. The salt marsh with its wooden plank walkway that leads to a tiny rocky island.\n\nWe reversed direction and walked the plank back to the main trail and continued on our hike.The trail markers appeared again, but it didn’t really matter as the trail paralleled the water. We stopped at a few of the many side trails that lead to views along the water.\n\nWe arrived back at the trailhead, but our hike was not over. We walked straight toward the ocean and Orchard Beach. I spotted a Great Egret in the salt marsh and stopped to take a look.\n\nWalking toward the beach, we turned left onto the boardwalk and turned left just before the nature center by the Orchard Beach kiosk and onto West Twin Island. We then turned left onto the first trail we saw and headed toward the salt marsh. We walked over to the stone bridge that used to connect West Twin and Hunter Islands.\n\nHeading east now toward East Twin Island, we encountered a slight problem. The trail that connects the “Twins” was flooded. The water was about calf high and it was a little too chilly to get our feet wet.\n\nWe headed back the way we came in and turned left after reaching the “boardwalk.” When we neared the end, we turned left.\n\nNow we were on East Twin Island and our feet were still dry.\n\nReaching a fork, we decided to stay left and walk along the water. It was a very pleasant walk along the rocky sand as we headed for Two Tree Island.\n\nTwin Island and Two Tree Island connect via a thin mudflat landbridge which is submerged at high tide.\n\nWe ventured onto the tiny island to get a look around. I have been here a few times and have always enjoyed relaxing on the rocks. Today was no different.\n\nWalking back from Two Tree Island, we had a good view of East Twin Island on the left, West Twin in the center and Hunter Island on the far right. The Islands were once true islands in Pelham Bay but are now connected to each other and to Orchard Beach by a landfill created in 1937.\n\nWe headed back toward Orchard Beach, passing through the center of East Twin Island.\n\nWhen we reached the “boardwalk,” we turned right and headed back to the parking lot where we began our hike.\n\nEven though I have hiked this area several times before, I always enjoy coming back and discovering new things about it. It does get crowded in the hotter months, but early mornings are usually less congested. On this day we crossed paths with several people and a large group of bird watchers.\n\nPros: Rock formations and glacial erratics, Long Island Sound, views, islands, shore birds, scenic trails.\n\nCons: Poorly marked trails, entrance fee in summer months, tends to get crowded in warmer weather.\n\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nLength: Approximately 4.5 miles\n\nRoute type: Circuit\n\nMap: Pelham Bay Park\n\nTrailhead parking: Orchard Beach Parking lot"
