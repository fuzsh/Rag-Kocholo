        "text": "The 145th Street Bridge, located in New York City, is a four-lane swing bridge that crosses the Harlem River, connecting 145th Street and Lenox Avenue in Manhattan with East 149th Street and River Avenue in the Bronx. It once carried northbound New York State Route 22 and New York State Route 100. Additionally, this bridge, for its proximity to the eponymous avenue, was once named the \"Lenox Avenue Bridge,\" an original name that has fallen into disuse. The bridge is operated and maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation. Construction on the original 145th Street Bridge began on April 19, 1901, and the $2.75 million bridge was opened to traffic on August 24, 1905. The designer was Alfred Pancoast Boller. A new swing span for the bridge was assembled in the former Powell & Minnock Brick Yard in Coeymans, New York, in southern Albany County. The span was replaced in early November 2006. The 145th Street Bridge carries the Bx19 bus route operated by MTA New York City Transit. The route's average weekday ridership is 30,534.\n\nThe 69th Street Transfer Bridge, part of the West Side Line of the New York Central Railroad, was a dock for car floats which allowed the transfer of railroad cars from the rail line to car floats which crossed the Hudson River to the Weehawken Yards in New Jersey. Its innovative linkspan design kept the boxcars from falling into the river while being loaded. After it fell into disuse, it was in danger of being torn down and removed, but around the year 2000, during renovations of Riverside Park, following the example of Gantry Plaza State Park, it became a prominent feature of the park. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Similar facilities are in use between 65th Street Yard in Brooklyn and Greenville Yard in Jersey City by the New York New Jersey Rail, LLC, which still operates car floats across Upper New York Bay. As of October 2014 The NYC Parks Department is in the design phase of a project to \"reconstruct, restore and adaptively reuse the 69th Street Transfer Bridge as a pedestrian walkway.\"\n\nThe Alexander Hamilton Bridge carries eight lanes of traffic over the Harlem River in New York City between the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx, connecting the Trans-Manhattan Expressway in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan and the Cross-Bronx Expressway, as part of Interstate 95. The bridge opened to traffic on January 15, 1963, the same day that the Cross-Bronx Expressway was completed. For 2011, the New York City Department of Transportation, which operates and maintains the bridge, reported an average daily traffic volume in both directions of 182,174; having reached a peak ADT of 192,848 in 1990. The total length of bridge, including approaches, is 2,375 feet. The parallel main spans of the steel arch bridge stretch 555 feet long over the Harlem River and provide 103 feet of vertical clearance at the center and 366 feet of horizontal clearance."
