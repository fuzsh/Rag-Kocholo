Amtrak shared responsibility for implementing the project with commuter rail authorities and state governments, and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) developed a master plan for the project and provided federal funds to Amtrak. GAO reviewed (1) the status of the project, (2) Amtrak's management of the project, (3) FRA's oversight of the project, and (4) best practices for managing future large-scale rail infrastructure projects. GAO recommends that Amtrak apply best practices for managing large-scale infrastructure projects to future major intercity passenger rail projects and that FRA require these best practices and develop guidance for how to do this. GAO also recommends that FRA seek legislative authority to oversee such projects in the future. Amtrak did not comment directly on GAO's specific recommendations but said it was incorporating many of the best practices discussed in the report as part of its management restructuring. Amtrak also raised some issues concerning GAO's report findings. FRA agreed with our recommendations. www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-04-94.

February 2004 INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL Amtrak's Management of Northeast Corridor Improvements Demonstrates Need for Applying Best Practices Amtrak has not yet met the 3-hour trip-time goal established by the 1992 Amtrak Authorization and Development Act although electrified service between Boston and New York City was initiated in January 2000 and Amtrak began limited high-speed rail service in December 2000. Currently, this trip is scheduled to take 3 hours 24 minutes. Furthermore, 51 of 72 work elements that FRA identified in its 1994 master plan as necessary to reduce trip times (e.g., electrify tracks and acquire high-speed trains), enhance capacity (e.g., construct sidings), rebuild or extend the life of physical assets (e.g., replace bridges), or make other improvements are incomplete or their status is unknown. Fifteen of these work elements are on non-Amtrak owned sections of track and are important for achieving and maintaining 3hour service as rail traffic increases over time. Through March 2003, Amtrak and others had spent about $3.2 billion on the project. Neither Amtrak nor FRA exercised effective management or oversight of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. Amtrak's management was not comprehensive, and it was focused primarily on the short term. Amtrak focused on managing the electrification and acquisition of new high-speed trains, and did not sufficiently address major infrastructure improvements needed to attain the trip-time goal. In addition, Amtrak did not fully integrate the interests of stakeholders (commuter rail authorities and state governments) into the project, even though work that involved them was critical to achieving 3-hour service. FRA served as a conduit for federal appropriations to the project but did not have the resources or the authority to oversee Amtrak's management of the project. Best practices-including comprehensive planning, risk assessment and mitigation, comprehensive financial management, accountability and oversight, and incorporation of diverse stakeholders' interests-provide a framework for effectively managing future large-scale intercity passenger rail infrastructure projects. These best practices have proved effective in managing large-scale infrastructure projects and could assist in managing future projects like the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project.

A United States General Accounting Office Washington, D.C. 20548 February 27, 2004 The Honorable John McCain Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation United States Senate Dear Mr. Chairman: Intercity passenger rail service is a critical component of the transportation system in the densely populated Northeast Corridor, which is generally defined as the area between Boston and Washington, D.C. The Northeast Corridor is the busiest passenger rail line in the country-some 200 million intercity and commuter rail passengers use this line, or some portion of it, each year. Although the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) is the primary owner of the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and New York City, track ownership between Boston and New York City is divided among Amtrak, commuter rail agencies, and state governments. Amtrak acquired its portion of the Northeast Corridor in 1976. Recognizing the importance of the Northeast Corridor and the need to make critical infrastructure improvements to the rail line, Congress established the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project in 1976. This project, which consisted of infrastructure improvements designed to enable high-speed rail service between Boston and Washington, D.C., was one of the largest rail infrastructure projects undertaken in recent times and represented the single largest federal investment in intercity passenger rail service in the last century. In the 1990s, the focus of the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project was on infrastructure improvements between Boston and New York City. In particular, in 1992 the Amtrak Authorization and Development Act directed the Secretary of Transportation to develop a master plan for a program of improvements that would permit regularly scheduled, safe, and dependable rail passenger service between Boston and New York City in 3 hours or less. In 1994, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued such a plan. The plan contained three milestones-initiating electrified train service between Boston and New York City, initiating 3-hour train service, and completing infrastructure improvements designed to enhance track capacity and extend the useful life of existing assets (called \"recapitalization\")-and identified 72 work elements that would be needed to complete the project. FRA estimated that the first milestone could be completed by mid-1997, the second by 1999, and the third by the end of 2009. FRA also estimated that about $3.1 billion (1993 dollars)1 would be needed to enable 3-hour service between Boston and New York City and complete capacity enhancement and recapitalization work to maintain this schedule. Improvements to achieve the 3-hour service included electrifying the route between New Haven, Connecticut, and Boston;2 upgrading and improving tracks, signals, and other infrastructure; and acquiring 26 highspeed passenger trains. Amtrak was responsible for managing these efforts, which collectively became known as the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, and shared responsibility for implementing the project with several other entities, including commuter and freight railroads and state governments, which we refer to in this report as \"stakeholders.\" This report responds to your request that we examine Amtrak's management of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. In particular, the report discusses (1) the status of the project, (2) Amtrak's management of the project, (3) FRA's oversight of the project, and (4) the use of best practices as a framework for managing future large-scale intercity passenger rail infrastructure projects. Best practices in the context of capital projects are defined as those \"practices that have been successfully implemented by organizations recognized for their outstanding capital decision-making practices.\"3 To determine the status of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, we reviewed applicable laws related to both it and the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project and reviewed documents on its cost, schedule, and status. To address Amtrak's management of the project, we reviewed documents related to the project's organization and management and interviewed Amtrak, FRA, and other officials about the project's management. To address FRA's oversight of the project, we reviewed laws related to FRA's legislative authorities, discussed FRA's oversight of the project with FRA officials, and reviewed documents related to the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) project management oversight program. Finally, to address the use of best practices as a framework for managing 1In this report, all financial amounts are in nominal dollars unless otherwise noted. 2In 1994, this section of the Northeast Corridor was not electrified, and Amtrak had to switch from electric to diesel locomotives at New Haven. 3U.S. General Accounting Office, Executive Guide: Leading Practices in Capital Decision-Making, GAO/AIMD-99-32 (Washington, D.C.: December 1998). future large-scale intercity passenger rail projects, we conducted a literature search to identify best practices related to infrastructure management and discussed infrastructure management best practices with Amtrak, FRA, and other officials. We then synthesized this information into the framework presented. Appendix I discusses our overall scope and methodology, appendix II discusses our methodology for identifying best practices related to infrastructure project management, and appendix V lists GAO and other products associated with project management best practices.4 Results in Brief Amtrak has not yet met the statutory goal of 3-hour rail service between Boston and New York City, although it has reduced the scheduled trip time from about 4 hours to 3 hours 24 minutes. To achieve this reduction, it completed the first milestone in FRA's 1994 master plan-initiate electrified train service between Boston and New York City-in January 2000, and it acquired enough high-speed trains to begin limited high-speed rail service in December 2000. However, it initiated these activities about 3 years later than planned. In addition, according to the latest available data (March 2003), only 5 of the 17 work elements needed to complete the second milestone of FRA's 1994 master plan-initiate 3-hour service-are complete. Progress toward achieving the third milestone-completing infrastructure improvements designed to enhance track capacity and extend the useful life of existing assets-has also been slower than planned. In total, as of March 2003, Amtrak, commuter rail authorities, and other stakeholders had completed 21 of the project's 72 work elements-51 of the work elements were incomplete or their status was unknown. 4In November 2001, one of the contractors manufacturing the Acela Express trains (Bombardier) filed suit against Amtrak in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking damages for, among other things, Amtrak's alleged interference with the manufacture of the equipment. In November 2002, Amtrak filed a countersuit against the manufacturers alleging, among other things, breach of contract. As of February 2004, these suits were still pending. In addition, Amtrak officials indicated that the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office were conducting investigations related to the contract for electrification work done under the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. As of February 2004, these investigations were also still pending. Nothing in this report is intended to have any impact on the outcome of these suits or investigations, and this work was not performed in relation to either the suits or the investigations. As discussed further in appendix I, this report does not analyze detailed information regarding either the highspeed trains or electrification procurements. However, we do not believe that such scope restraints negatively affected our ability to review and evaluate information on the overall management of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project and draw conclusions about how Amtrak managed the project. According to FRA and commuter rail officials, several of the work elements that are incomplete or for which their status is unknown (such as realignment of curves) are important to achieving the 3-hour goal. As of March 2003, Amtrak, commuter railroads, and other stakeholders had spent about $3.2 billion on the project. How much more work will be done is uncertain. Several Amtrak officials said they consider the project complete, even though the trip-time goal has not been met and many capacity enhancement and recapitalization work elements are incomplete or their status is unknown. Work is continuing, or is planned, for some of the master plan's work elements, but there does not appear to be an effort to complete the project or meet the trip-time goal. Amtrak could have exercised more effective management of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project had its management of the project been more comprehensive and had it focused greater attention on critical infrastructure issues needed to attain the 3-hour trip-time goal. Although FRA's 1994 master plan laid out the blueprint for the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, Amtrak did not adopt this plan and did not prepare a comprehensive management plan of its own. Instead, Amtrak generally focused on managing individual project components, particularly the electrification and acquisition of high-speed trains. Although Amtrak senior management obtained a substantial amount of information about these two aspects of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, it did not consistently use this information effectively to minimize the impact of problems on the overall project. Amtrak also relied on annual appropriations to plan work rather than on a more comprehensive financial plan that considered long-term funding needs. Finally, although Amtrak worked closely with stakeholders-commuter railroads and state governments-to coordinate some project work, it did not fully integrate their interests into project goals. The participation of stakeholders was, and continues to be, essential for completing work critical for meeting the 3-hour trip-time goal. FRA provided little oversight of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. Although FRA-the primary federal agency supporting the project-was the conduit of millions of federal dollars to the project, FRA management adopted the position that it had only limited authority to oversee the project. FRA was legally responsible for and carried out other activities related to the project, such as conducting environmental assessments and developing safety regulations to accommodate high-speed rail service. FRA officials said they did not take an active role in overseeing the project because (1) the agency did not have the resources or the legislative authority to change Amtrak's project management, (2) Congress did not specifically authorize FRA to oversee the project, and (3) FRA did not have a formal mechanism to perform oversight. We agree with FRA's view that it had only limited authority to oversee the project. For fiscal year 2003, Congress increased FRA's responsibility to provide oversight of and accountability for federal funds used for intercity passenger rail service, but this responsibility extended only to fiscal year 2003 funds. Project management best practices can provide a framework for effectively managing future large-scale intercity passenger rail projects. Through our analyses of management approaches across a broad spectrum of national activities, we have identified key components of a best practices framework for project management. These components include (1) conducting comprehensive project planning, (2) assessing risks and identifying mitigation measures, (3) comprehensively managing project finances, (4) establishing accountability for and oversight of projects, and (5) incorporating stakeholders' interests in planning and implementing projects. Comprehensive planning helps manage and control projects' implementation. Assessing risks and identifying mitigation measures assist in meeting projects' goals by recognizing and responding to problems earlier. Comprehensively managing project finances is important for estimating and controlling projects' costs. Establishing accountability for and oversight of projects better ensures the prudent use of resources, including federal resources. Incorporating diverse stakeholders' interests helps facilitate projects' successful implementation by ensuring there is a clear understanding of roles, responsibilities, and potential concerns. We make recommendations to Amtrak to adopt elements of the best practices framework when planning and implementing future large-scale infrastructure projects, like the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. This includes developing project management and finance plans. We also make recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation to direct FRA to require managers of federally funded large-scale intercity passenger rail infrastructure projects to adopt elements of the best practices framework, including preparing project management and finance plans and conducting risk assessments, as part of their receipt of federal funds for such projects, and that FRA provide guidance on how to do this. Finally, we recommend that FRA seek legislation authorizing it to establish a program to oversee such federally funded large-scale intercity passenger rail infrastructure projects in the future. We provided a draft of this report to Amtrak and the Department of Transportation for their review and comment. The president of Amtrak observed that our report raised many of the issues that he has had to address since he took office and that on a regular basis he has had to deal with many of the consequences of decisions made during the life of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. Although Amtrak said it was unable to comment because of matters under litigation, it believes our findings and conclusions were incomplete because we did not consider how the actions of contractors might have influenced Amtrak's management of the project. Amtrak also believes we placed too great a reliance on FRA's master plan to measure their project management. We recognize that contractor actions can influence project implementation and management. However, our findings are directed to Amtrak's overall management of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, including the preparation and use of comprehensive project management plans, rather than the actions of contractors or the planning and implementation of specific project components (e.g., high-speed train acquisition). Although Amtrak agreed that FRA's statutorily required master plan constituted a blueprint for the project, we found that Amtrak did not use this plan to manage the project or create its own comprehensive management plan to oversee the program of improvements needed to bring 3-hour passenger rail service between Boston and New York City. Amtrak did not directly comment on our specific recommendations but instead said it was incorporating many of the best practices discussed in our report as part of its management restructuring. FRA responded for the Department of Transportation and agreed with our recommendations. FRA said that their proposed Passenger Rail Investment Reform Act would create an oversight program similar to what we are recommending. We continue to believe that the recommendations in this report are valid. Background The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 created Amtrak to provide intercity passenger rail service because existing railroads found such service to be unprofitable. Amtrak operates a 22,000-mile network, primarily over freight railroad tracks, providing service to 46 states and the District of Columbia. Amtrak owns about 650 miles of track, primarily on the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. In fiscal year 2002, Amtrak served 23.4 million passengers, or about 64,000 passengers per day. According to Amtrak, about two-thirds of its ridership is wholly or partially on the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak acquired the Northeast Corridor in 1976 from the Consolidated Rail Corporation as part of the disposition of the Penn Central Transportation Company's assets. At the time, the Penn Central Transportation Company and certain other Northeastern railroads were in bankruptcy. As required by the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, the purpose of this acquisition was to facilitate improved high-speed passenger rail service. However, Amtrak is neither the exclusive owner nor the exclusive user of the Northeast Corridor. Although Amtrak is the owner and operator of the Northeast Corridor between New York City and Washington, D.C. (called the \"south-end\"), other organizations, including the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CDOT), and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York (MTA), own significant portions of the Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City (called the \"north-end\"). (See fig. 1.) Both Amtrak and commuter rail trains operate on these segments of track: MBTA provides commuter rail service between Boston and Providence, Rhode Island; Shore Line East provides commuter rail service between New London and New Haven, Connecticut; and Metro-North Railroad provides commuter rail service between New Haven and New Rochelle, New York. In fiscal year 2002, Amtrak accounted for 10 percent of the number of intercity and commuter rail trains operated on the north-end of the Northeast Corridor, and commuter railroads accounted for 90 percent.5 Six freight railroads also operate on the Northeast Corridor and, in fiscal year 2001, these freight railroads operated 38 trains per day on the Northeast Corridor. In contrast, in the same year Amtrak and commuter railroads operated approximately 470 trains per day on just the north-end of the Northeast Corridor. 5Number of trains is measured as the train volume at the point of maximum line utilization. Although Amtrak does not operate as many trains as commuter rail operators, it accounts for a larger percentage of train-miles. A train-mile is a train traveling 1 mile. In fiscal year 2002, Amtrak accounted for about 60 percent of train-miles on the north-end of the Northeast Corridor, compared with about 40 percent for commuter rail operators. Figure 1: Ownership of the Northeast Corridor Source: GAO. The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4R Act) formally established the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project. Among other things, the 4R Act authorized Amtrak to make improvements to the right-of-way between Boston and Washington, D.C., needed to enable highspeed rail service, and it established certain goals for the project. In particular, within 5 years of the 4R Act's enactment, the project was to achieve regularly scheduled and dependable intercity passenger rail service between Boston and New York City in 3 hours 40 minutes, and between New York City and Washington, D.C., in 2 hours 40 minutes. The ultimate goal was to achieve service between Boston and New York City in 3 hours, and between New York City and Washington, D.C., in 2 hours 30 minutes. The act directed the Secretary of Transportation to determine the practicability of meeting these latter goals and authorized $1.75 billion to accomplish them as well as make certain other improvements on routes related to the Northeast Corridor (such as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Massachusetts). The act did not specify a time by which these latter goals were to be met, but did require a status report within two years after the 4R Act was enacted. Under the act, FRA was the project manager. Amtrak was a subcontractor primarily responsible for track and signal work. The Passenger Railroad Rebuilding Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-254) called for transferring responsibility for the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project from FRA to Amtrak by October 1985.6 FRA officials told us that at the time of this transfer, they generally considered the project to be complete in that additional funding for remaining major work elements was not envisioned. Although the project had achieved significant improvements to the entire Northeast Corridor, its principal focus had been on the south-end of the corridor because of the significant deterioration of the infrastructure on this segment of the line. An Amtrak official told us that the emphasis had been largely on addressing infrastructure maintenance and repair issues, not on enhancing the Northeast Corridor to accommodate high-speed rail service. Consequently, although the project met the 2-hour-40-minute triptime goal on the south-end of the Northeast Corridor between New York City and Washington, D.C., it did not meet either the 3-hour-40-minute or the 3-hour trip-time goals on the north-end of the Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. FRA attributed the failure to meet the trip-time goals for the north-end to a lack of funding, which prevented electrifying the line north of New Haven and making other improvements to track and structures. During the 1980s, funding for the project was reduced several times, and these reductions limited the scope of the project and led to the elimination of the north-end electrification work. In 1992, the Amtrak Authorization and Development Act (P.L. 102-533) required the Secretary of Transportation to develop a master plan for a new project, the goal of which was to provide intercity passenger rail service 6In September 1985, FRA entered into a grant agreement that transferred responsibility for the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project to Amtrak as of October 1, 1985. between Boston and New York City in 3 hours or less. The act authorized a total of $470 million for fiscal years 1993 and 1994 to plan this effort and make capital investments. Amtrak established the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project in response to this act. In July 1994, FRA issued a master plan for the project that called for a series of improvements designed to meet the act's 3-hour trip-time goal and permit initiation of 3hour service by 1999.7 FRA estimated a cost of about $3.1 billion (in 1993 dollars)8 for the project, of which about $1.9 billion (1993 dollars) would be required to achieve 3-hour rail service. The project was to be complete by the end of 2009. (See app. III for more information on the history of the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project and the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project.) Since its inception in 1970, Amtrak has struggled to earn revenues and operate efficiently. These struggles have continued in recent years, leading to proposals for restructuring the provision of intercity passenger rail service. These proposals range from keeping Amtrak intact and providing increased funding to improve its equipment and infrastructure, to breaking Amtrak up and introducing competing rail service. The creation of a separate infrastructure company has also been proposed as a means to maintain and rehabilitate the Northeast Corridor and other infrastructure for providing intercity passenger rail service. Finally, a proposal has been made to delegate much of the responsibility for intercity passenger rail service to states and have states (acting through interstate compacts) provide a larger share of the funding and make decisions about intercity passenger rail service. As of September 2003, these proposals were pending before Congress. One or more of these proposals may influence how largescale intercity passenger rail infrastructure projects are managed in the future. The federal government is also likely to be involved in future large-scale intercity passenger rail infrastructure projects as high-speed rail corridors are developed around the country. As of January 2002, there were 10 federally designated high-speed rail corridors nationwide. We reported in March 2001 that 34 states were participating in the development of highspeed rail corridors and that those states had invested more than $1 billion 7U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration, The Northeast Corridor Transportation Plan, New York City to Boston (July 1994). For purposes of this report, this plan is referred to as the \"FRA master plan.\" 8This is about $3.6 billion in 2002 dollars. to improve local rail lines for that purpose.9 Federally designated corridors may be eligible for federal funds. The total cost to develop high-speed rail corridors is unknown. However, in April 2003, we reported that preliminary estimates of the cost to develop these corridors could be between $50 billion and $70 billion over the next 20 years.10 Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project Has Not Achieved Trip-Time Goal Amtrak has not met the goal of 3-hour rail service between Boston and New York City, although it has reduced the scheduled trip time from about 4 hours in 1994 to 3 hours 24 minutes in 2003. To do this, it completed the first milestone in FRA's 1994 master plan-initiate electrified train service between Boston and New York City-in January 2000, and it acquired enough high-speed trains to begin limited high-speed rail service in December 2000. However, it initiated these activities later than planned, and, according to the latest available data (from March 2003), nearly threequarters of the work elements (12 of 17 work elements) needed to complete the second milestone-initiate 3-hour service-are incomplete or their status is unknown.11 Progress toward completing the third and final milestone-completing infrastructure improvements designed to enhance track capacity and extend the life of existing track assets-has also been slower than planned. In total, as of March 2003, Amtrak, commuter rail authorities, and other stakeholders had completed 21 of the project's 72 work elements-51 were either incomplete or their status was unknown. Of these 51 work elements, according to FRA and commuter rail officials, several (such as realignment of curves) are important to achieving the 3hour goal. As of March 2003, Amtrak, commuter railroads, and other 9U.S. General Accounting Office, Intercity Passenger Rail: Assessing the Benefits of Increased Federal Funding for Amtrak and High-Speed Passenger Rail Systems, GAO-01480T (Washington, D.C.: March 2001). 10U.S. General Accounting Office, Intercity Passenger Rail: Issues for Consideration in Developing an Intercity Passenger Rail Policy, GAO-03-712T (Washington, D.C.: April 2003). 11Status unknown means that either Amtrak did not know the status of the work element or we were unable to obtain information about a work element's status from Amtrak or commuter railroads. It should be recognized that not all work elements might be of equal importance, scale, or complexity. For example, completing electrification of the line between New Haven and Boston (which is considered 1 work element) is significantly more important to achieving project goals and more complex than something like eliminating a railroad-highway grade crossing (which is also considered to be 1 work element). Also, as discussed later in this report, not all of the work elements were located on Amtrak-owned track. stakeholders had spent about $3.2 billion on the project. How much more work will be done is uncertain. Several Amtrak officials said that they consider the project complete, even though the 3-hour trip-time goal has not been met and many work elements are incomplete. Work is continuing, or is planned, for some of the master plan's work elements, but there does not appear to be an effort to complete the project or meet the trip-time goal. FRA's Master Plan Identified Milestones and Work Elements and Estimated Costs for the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project FRA's 1994 master plan for the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project divided the project into three milestones and identified dates for their completion. These milestones were as follows: o Initiate electrified service. This milestone consisted of 16 work elements12 and required the completion of such things as the installation of an electrification system between Boston and New Haven-the line between New Haven and New York City was already electrified-and the realignment of curves on the Boston to New Haven segment of track. According to the master plan, the installation of the electrification system was expected to take the most time, and its completion would control the achievement of the first milestone. FRA estimated this milestone could be completed by mid-1997. o Initiate 3-hour train service. This milestone consisted of 17 work elements and required the completion of such things as the partial delivery of high-speed trains (at least eight trains were expected to be delivered to meet this milestone) and the realignment of curves between New Haven and New Rochelle. FRA anticipated the initiation of limited 3-hour service between Boston and New York City in 1999, followed by full 3-hour service using all 26 high-speed trains in 2001. o Complete capacity enhancement and recapitalization work elements necessary to maintain 3-hour service. This milestone consisted of 43 work elements and included the completion of several capacity enhancement and recapitalization projects, such as construction of 12The total number of work elements for all three milestones is 76, rather than 72, because FRA counted 4 work elements twice-curve realignments, constructing high-level platforms, reconfiguring existing interlockings (places where trains can be switched from one track to another track), and constructing passing sidings-since they could help achieve more than one milestone. passing sidings and the replacement of movable bridges-that is, bridges that can be lifted or pivoted to accommodate maritime traffic. This milestone was to be completed by the end of 2009 to accommodate projected intercity, commuter, and freight traffic levels in 2010. To accomplish the project's three milestones, FRA's 1994 master plan also laid out the work elements in four categories. (See app. II for a list of all the work elements.) The categories were o trip time reduction-20 work elements were designed to reduce trip times through such efforts as electrifying the line from Boston to New Haven and acquiring high-speed trains; o capacity enhancement-18 work elements were designed to enhance capacity by, for example, reconfiguring interlockings to accommodate traffic growth; o recapitalization-15 work elements were designed to rebuild or extend the useful life of the infrastructure by, for example, replacing bridges;13 and o other-19 work elements, labeled as \"other,\" including fiber optic communications lines and pedestrian bridges, were designed to provide more general benefits to rail passengers and others. Under the master plan, Amtrak, commuter railroads, and state departments of transportation shared responsibility for implementing the work elements. According to FRA's analysis, some of these elements exclusively or primarily benefited Amtrak's intercity passenger rail service, while other elements primarily benefited commuter and freight rail service. The 1994 master plan recognized that completing the work elements would be expensive. FRA estimated that the work elements designed to reduce trip times, enhance capacity, and perform recapitalization work would cost about $3.1 billion (in 1993 dollars). This worked out to about $1.3 billion for trip-time reductions, about $600 million for capacity enhancements, and 13These items were also to restore track and other infrastructure to a \"state of good repair.\" A state of good repair is the outcome expected from the capital investment needed to restore Amtrak's right-of-way (track, signals, and auxiliary structures) to a condition that requires only routine maintenance. about $1.2 billion for recapitalization. FRA did not include a cost estimate for the 19 other work elements.14 (See table 1.) Of the $3.1 billion cost estimate, FRA estimated that about $1.9 billion (about 60 percent) would be required to enable 3-hour service between Boston and New York City. The 1994 master plan also did not assign funding responsibility to particular organizations, but it did indicate that about 40 percent of the project's estimated costs would cover work that would provide significant benefit to commuter railroads. The plan recognized that funding would come from a variety of sources, including direct appropriations to FRA, appropriations authorized under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, and state and local governments. The plan further recognized that allocating funding responsibility and identifying funding sources would involve negotiations between relevant parties.

Amtrak generally agreed with FRA's 1994 master plan in their written comments provided to FRA. However, in commenting on the plan, Amtrak did not agree with certain cost estimates or with all of the plan's work elements that FRA identified as essential to achieve the 3-hour trip-time goal. For example, Amtrak did not agree that FRA should have included some capacity enhancement and recapitalization work elements (such as the installation of concrete ties in commuter rail territory) in its estimate of the cost to complete the project. However, Amtrak recognized that both the 14FRA indicated that the cost estimates were based on information provided by government agencies and the railroads themselves. For those work elements for which cost estimates were not directly available, FRA contractors developed conceptual estimates. capacity enhancement and recapitalization work elements were ultimately essential to reliably and cost effectively support projected increases in rail service over the following 20 years. Furthermore, Amtrak said that to achieve a reliable 3-hour schedule it was not depending on improvements to the non-Amtrak-owned sections of track (such as those owned by commuter rail authorities) that FRA had identified as essential to achieve the 3-hour trip-time goal. Finally, Amtrak stated its expectation that improvements such as capacity enhancements would be funded by the state or local agency or organization primarily benefiting from the improvement, even if that agency or organization did not own the track. In subsequent discussions with Amtrak officials, they said that, while Amtrak had commented on FRA's master plan during its development and acknowledged its issuance, Amtrak did not adopt the plan or manage its high-speed rail projects in accordance with it. According to Amtrak, the master plan was never intended by Amtrak, Congress, or FRA to be used as a \"blueprint\" or planning directive for the high-speed work and that the document, once released, was virtually obsolete. This contradicts information that was provided during our work. At that time, both Amtrak and FRA officials agreed that the 1994 master plan was a blueprint for the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. A former Amtrak project director had told us that FRA's plan could be considered a baseline for the overall project. Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project Has Not Achieved 3-Hour Goal and Is Far from Complete Amtrak believed it could achieve a reliable 3-hour trip time by the summer of 1999-about 2 years earlier than FRA had projected in the master plan. Despite its belief that it could meet this goal by 1999, Amtrak has not yet done so, and progress on the project has been slower than FRA initially estimated. (See fig. 2.) As of March 2003, a total of 51 of the project's 72 work elements were not complete or their status was unknown. Most of these were in the third milestone. Although 49 of the project's 72 work elements were supposed to have been completed before 2003, as of March 2003, less than 40 percent (19 of the 49 work elements) had actually been completed by that date. In addition, 2 other work elements that were scheduled for completion after 2003 were actually completed by March 2003.15 Figure 2: Status of Work Elements Listed in FRA's 1994 Master Plan, by Milestones, as of March 2003 Number of work elements 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Initiate electrified Initiate 3-hour service Complete 2010 service in 1997 between Boston and requirements New York City in 1999 in 2009 Milestones Complete as of March 2003 Incomplete or status unknown Source: GAO analysis of Amtrak and commuter railroad data. Note: The total number of completed work elements shown in figure 2 is 22, rather than 21, because 1 of the work elements that help to achieve two milestones (curve realignments) is partially complete (the portion needed to initiate electrified service) and partially incomplete (the portion needed to initiate 3-hour service). 15Of the 21 work elements completed by March 2003, all, or part of, 5 work elements were completed early-that is, ahead of their scheduled completion date. This included 1 work element (replace/upgrade overhead bridges in Rhode Island) that was completed in 1999- about 10 years ahead of its scheduled completion date in 2009. It also included 1 work element-the track program (installation of concrete ties, track resurfacing, and ballast cleaning)-that was completed about 3 years ahead of its scheduled completion date. An Amtrak official told us that much of the track and infrastructure work was accelerated once delays in electrification began to occur. According to the master plan, Amtrak was scheduled to complete the first milestone-initiate electrified service-by mid-1997, but it did not initiate such service between Boston and New York City until January 2000, and the electrification was not substantially completed until July 200016-about 3 years later than expected. The electrification was delayed, in part, because Amtrak changed contractors in 1995 after the first electrification contractor went out of business and the contract was terminated. Amtrak then had to hire a new contractor to complete the work and lost about 2 years in work time. As of March 2003, 4 of the work elements for this milestone were still incomplete, including the line electrification work element, for which final acceptance is still pending.17 Amtrak has yet to attain the second milestone-initiate 3-hour service. Amtrak did begin limited Acela Express high-speed train service in December 2000, but this service is scheduled to take 3 hours 24 minutes from Boston to New York, not 3 hours. The 3-hour goal has not been met, in part, because work elements on the 56-mile segment of track between New Haven and New Rochelle that is operated by Metro-North Railroad have not been completed. Amtrak did not believe work on this line segment was necessary to achieve 3-hour service. However, both FRA and commuter rail officials told us that work on this track segment is essential for achieving the 3-hour goal. Among the work elements that have not been completed is the reconfiguration of the New Rochelle (\"Shell\") interlocking. Originally this was to include the construction of a \"flyover\" (elevated track), called the Shell Flyover. According to Amtrak officials, at-grade improvements are now planned rather than a flyover because of high costs. Work at New Rochelle is critical because of the severe train congestion in this area- Connecticut Department of Transportation officials said more than 200 commuter trains a day go through the Shell interlocking. As of March 2003, about three-quarters of the work elements (12 of 17 work elements) needed to reach this milestone were incomplete or their status was unknown. According to Amtrak, work on some elements under this milestone is actively under way. For example, the Stamford center island platforms were completed in the summer of 2003, and final curve modifications were 16\"Substantially complete\" means that most of the construction work related to electrifying the line, such as installing foundations, erecting poles, and constructing electric substations and related facilities, had been completed. However, it does not mean that all the work was done or that there are no unresolved disputes concerning the work. 17For purposes of this report, we consider electrification incomplete since final acceptance of the system was still pending as of March 2003. It was still pending as of February 2004. under design. Amtrak said that this, in conjunction with completion of the Connecticut Department of Transportation's catenary18 program would, among other things, allow it to travel 90 miles per hour between New Haven and New Rochelle and generate about 7 minutes of trip-time savings. Finally, progress toward the third milestone-complete capacity enhancement and recapitalization work-has been slower than planned, and nearly 90 percent of the work elements for this milestone (38 of 43 work elements) were incomplete or their status was unknown as of March 2003. Of the 38 work elements that were incomplete or their status was unknown, 2 were related to trip-time reduction (a noise and vibration study and construction of a transfer facility at Kingston, Rhode Island), 12 were categorized as capacity enhancement (including construction of passing sidings), 10 were recapitalization (including bridge replacements), and 14 were categorized as other (including construction of layover facilities and commuter parking). As of March 2003, 15 of the 51 work elements (about 30 percent) that had not been completed or whose status was unknown were on track not owned by Amtrak. (See fig. 3.) Of these 15 work elements, Amtrak was expected to be the major beneficiary of 9. Some of these work elements, including certain curve realignments and track clearances, are critical for achieving the 3-hour trip time. For example, Amtrak is not currently able to use a key feature of the new high-speed trains-a mechanism that allows the trains to \"tilt\" and, therefore, take curves at a higher speed-in part, because track centers are too close on the segment of track between New Haven and New Rochelle. The Connecticut Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York own this track. According to an Amtrak official, the tilt mechanism on the high-speed trains is turned off between New Haven and New Rochelle. FRA's 1994 master plan identified track curvature as the most severe constraint on trip time, and both FRA and commuter rail officials told us that curves on the north-end of the Northeast Corridor are a severe constraint on the achievement of faster trip times. 18The overhead wire that delivers the electricity to the locomotive for traction, or movement.

Note: The above does not include 18 work elements that were not geographically specific-that is, they applied to all or a portion of the track between Boston and New York City (e.g., electrification and acquisition of high-speed trains), or involved studies or actions not tied to specific geographic locations. Through March 2003, a total of about $3.2 billion (2003 dollars) had been spent on the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project-or just less than 90 percent of the $3.6 billion (2002 dollars)19 project cost estimated in FRA's 1994 master plan. Amtrak has spent about $2.6 billion20 and three commuter railroads, two freight railroads, and two state governments have spent about $625 million.21 Most of Amtrak's spending was for the acquisition of high-speed trains and related maintenance facilities (about $1.1 billion),22 electrification of the route (about $717 million), and track and infrastructure projects ($652 million). (See table 2). Of the amounts spent by commuter and freight railroads and the state governments, the most-about $141 million-was spent by the Connecticut Department of Transportation to replace a bridge. The Connecticut Department of Transportation also plans to spend an additional $250 million to replace catenary between the New York/Connecticut state line and New Haven. 19$3.1 billion in 1993 dollars. 20This figure does not include about $100 million in disputed costs between Amtrak and the electrification contractor. 21This represents information from Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, CSX Transportation Inc., Providence and Worchester Railroad, Connecticut Department of Transportation, and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. 22Of the $1.1 billion total for acquisition of trains, locomotives, and maintenance facilities, $753 million was financed. The $1.1 billion includes amounts spent for 15 high horsepower locomotives for non-high-speed train operations on electrified lines, and about $5.7 million for the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System.

Note: The spending in this table is shown in the categories Amtrak used to track project spending. Although requested, Amtrak was unable to reconcile its categories of spending to the work elements and three milestones contained in FRA's master plan. While Amtrak did not track costs of improvements relative to the original projections, it is clear that the cost of some work elements was higher than expected. For example, the estimated cost of electrification increased from about $300 million in 1992 to about $727 million in 2003. (See fig. 4.) As of March 2003, Amtrak had spent about $717 million. According to Amtrak's data, much of the cost increase (more than $200 million) was attributable to unexpected and unplanned items. Amtrak incurred approximately $120 million in unplanned costs because, according to an Amtrak official, the contractor frequently revised the geographic location of the electrification work, and each revision triggered the need for safety protection work, called \"flag protection,\" that was provided by workers standing along the track and at highway-railroad grade crossings holding flags. Under collective bargaining agreements, Amtrak was required to advertise this work for 7 to 10 days so that its unionized employees could express their interest in doing the work. The extra time required for Amtrak to comply with this requirement delayed the electrification work and increased Amtrak's costs.

Amtrak spent $16 million on this original contract. In subsequent bars the $16 million is included in contract 2 amounts. bContract 2 was scheduled for completion in October 1999. Similarly, the cost of acquiring trains, locomotives, and maintenance facilities also increased, from an original estimate of about $186 million for 26 trains in FRA's 1994 master plan to about $800 million for 20 trains plus three maintenance facilities in 1996.23 Through March 2003, Amtrak had spent about $1.1 billion for these items. Amtrak attributed much of the cost 23In June 1992, Amtrak had estimated a cost of about $450 million for high-speed trains. increase to, among other things, the addition of the three maintenance facilities, various modifications to the trains, and a higher-than-expected bid to manufacture the trains. Amtrak also said that an additional $100 million was incurred to add a second power car to each train (an extra 20 power cars) to comply with new FRA passenger car safety standards. An Amtrak official said it was difficult to estimate the cost of trains, since the acquisition went from a relatively simple procurement of train equipment to a complex high-speed rail program that included the acquisition of equipment capable of traveling at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. The acquisition cost of both the trains and maintenance facilities was financed, and debt service on this financing began in fiscal year 2002 and will continue through fiscal year 2023 for the high-speed trains and through fiscal year 2042 for the maintenance facilities unless an early buyout offer is exercised. Amtrak expects the interest on this financing to total about $426 million.24 Amtrak stated that FRA's involvement with the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project also affected project cost and schedule. (See below for a discussion of FRA's role in this project.) For example, according to Amtrak, the environmental impact statement that FRA developed for the project was over a year late and imposed significant and costly mitigation measures. Also, FRA's new track standards required development of the technologically challenging and expensive Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System-a system for automatic train control on the entire Northeast Corridor. Because all trains that operate on the Northeast Corridor would be required to use this system, Amtrak agreed to fund the equipment upgrades for various railroads that use the Northeast Corridor, including commuter railroads.25 Finally, FRA's passenger car safety standards required the 20 additional power cars discussed above as well as an expensive crash-energy absorption system on the trains. FRA officials told us that Amtrak was intimately involved with development of the track and passenger car standards and that, in some instances, the standards were specifically developed to accommodate the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. In general, FRA officials said there was no extra cost for Amtrak to comply with FRA's new safety regulations. However, 24This is interest on the permanent financing only. It does not include interest paid on interim loans used during construction of the equipment or facilities. 25According to an Amtrak official, phase I of this system was scheduled for completion in summer 2003 with phase II (to permit remote enforcement of speed restrictions) scheduled to be completed in 2005. they acknowledged the additional cost to develop the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System but said Amtrak could not operate high-speed trains without this system. Some Consider Project Complete Even Though Work Is Not Finished Several Amtrak officials told us that they consider the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project complete, even though Amtrak has not achieved the 3-hour goal and the work is not finished. As of March 2003, 41 of the work elements identified in FRA's master plan were incomplete, and on an additional 10 work elements there was no information or their status was unknown. It is not clear how many work elements will be completed or whether Amtrak is committed to achieving the 3-hour goal. A former director of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project told us that Amtrak hopes to reduce the trip time to 3 hours 10 minutes in the future if funding is available. But the former director doubted there was much of a market for 3-hour service between Boston and New York City.26 In the past, however, Amtrak had stated that it was relying on meeting the 3-hour goal to help it attract the ridership and revenue needed to attain operational self-sufficiency, as called for in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997.27 As recently as 2000, the Chairman of Amtrak's Board of Directors testified before Congress that Amtrak would achieve the 3-hour trip-time goal between Boston and New York City. Although several Amtrak officials told us they consider the project complete, work is continuing, or is planned, for some of the master plan's work elements. For example, Amtrak's most recent 5-year capital plan (covering fiscal years 2004 through 2008), issued in April 2003, includes 12 of the 51 work elements in FRA's master plan that, as of March 2003, were incomplete or whose status was unknown. These work elements consist primarily of replacing bridges, reconfiguring interlockings, and completing fire and life safety improvements in and around Pennsylvania Station in New York. Amtrak's 5-year capital plan also contains $52 million through 26Amtrak officials stated to us that they believe such a trip time is \"achievable\" with completion of the Metro-North improvements and completion of the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System. 27The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 prohibited Amtrak from using federal funds for operating expenses after 2002. The prohibition against using federal funds for operating expenses does not apply when Congress specifically appropriates funds for Amtrak to cover operating expenses in a particular year, as Congress did for fiscal year 2003 (see the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003) and 2004. fiscal year 2008 for the at-grade improvements at the Shell interlocking. In total, Amtrak's capital plan budgets about $380 million for the work elements associated with the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. However, there does not appear to be an effort to complete the project or meet the trip-time goal, and Amtrak did not characterize its recent capital plan as encompassing the completion of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. Rather, the plan was characterized as aiming to stabilize the railroad by returning its plant and equipment to a state of good repair, controlling operating deficits, and restoring liquidity. Commuter rail agencies and state governments along the north-end of the Northeast Corridor also plan to continue some of the work associated with the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. Commuter rail agencies and state governments we contacted said they planned to continue work on at least 20 of the work elements contained in the 1994 master plan. For example, one commuter rail authority (Metro-North Railroad) plans to finish improving stations, rehabilitating movable bridges, and upgrading power, communications and signal systems. Two state governments (Connecticut and Rhode Island) said they plan to replace bridges and catenary on the New Haven rail line, as well as construct passing sidings and improve clearances for freight railroad operations. Commuter rail and state officials estimated that these work elements could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Officials with the Connecticut Department of Transportation, for example, said their state plans to spend more than $800 million between 2003 and 2010 on at least 9 work elements associated with the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, including bridge and catenary replacements and station relocations. Even though Amtrak has not reached the project's 3-hour goal and many important work elements remain to be completed, Amtrak officials maintain that they achieved noteworthy successes, particularly in light of the challenges they faced. Noting that Amtrak does not own major portions of the Northeast Corridor, that freight and commuter rail operations continued throughout the life of the project, and that funding was provided annually in varying amounts, Amtrak officials consider the electrification of the Northeast Corridor a significant success. According to one Amtrak official, the entire project represents a success, because the Northeast Corridor now enables freight trains to operate at 30 miles per hour while intercity passenger trains travel up to 150 miles per hour. The official said that some states outside the Northeast Corridor that are considering upgrading their rail lines to accommodate both freight traffic and highspeed passenger trains have sought assistance from Amtrak. Amtrak Did Not Exercise Effective Management of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project Amtrak could have exercised more effective management of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project had its management of the project been more comprehensive and had it focused greater attention on critical infrastructure issues needed to attain the 3-hour trip-time goal. Although FRA's master plan laid out the blueprint for the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, Amtrak did not adopt this plan and did not prepare a comprehensive management plan of its own. Instead, Amtrak generally focused on managing individual project components, particularly the electrification and acquisition of high-speed trains. Although Amtrak senior management obtained a substantial amount of information about these two aspects of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, it did not consistently use this information effectively to minimize the impact of problems on the overall project. Amtrak also relied on annual appropriations to plan work rather than on a more comprehensive financial plan that considered long-term funding needs. Finally, although Amtrak worked closely with stakeholders-commuter railroads and state governments-to coordinate some project work, it did not fully integrate their interests into project goals. The participation of stakeholders was, and continues to be, essential for completing work critical for meeting the 3-hour trip-time goal. Amtrak's Project Management Was Focused on Selected Components, Not Attainment of Project Goals Amtrak's management of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project contributed to its inability to achieve project goals. Project management was not comprehensive but rather was focused on selected components, not project goals. As discussed earlier, FRA's 1994 master plan laid out the work elements needed to complete the project, estimated their costs, and identified those elements that would benefit Amtrak or others. However, Amtrak did not adopt this plan or manage to it. Instead, Amtrak focused on managing selected components of the project-primarily the work associated with electrifying the line between Boston and New Haven and acquisition of the high-speed trains. This occurred even though there were critical infrastructure improvements that were required in order to achieve the 3-hour trip time between Boston and New York City. Amtrak did not ignore infrastructure improvements, but as the project evolved, and costs increased and schedules slipped, the emphasis shifted to completing those infrastructure improvements required to begin electrified service between Boston and New York City, not those needed to achieve the 3-hour trip-time goal. As of February 2004, some infrastructure improvements (such as reconfiguring the Shell interlocking) that are critical to achieving the 3-hour trip time had not been completed. Amtrak received a substantial amount of information about selected components of the project. Amtrak's senior management and the Board of Directors received periodic information about the project, including monthly progress reports about the project. Amtrak also received monthly progress reports from the consortium manufacturing the high-speed trains. Amtrak used integrated program schedules that were updated monthly to visually depict start and end dates for various project tasks. Such information allowed Amtrak management to track work status and to identify actual or potential problems. For example, an October 1996 monthly progress report on the high-speed trains noted that progress in this component was \"significantly less\" than had been planned, and by December 1996 the progress report noted that the high-speed train acquisition program was no longer likely to finish on time, even with planned late finish dates. Amtrak did not use the information it received to effectively manage problems that arose. While Amtrak attempted to take action to address various problems that developed, those actions did not prevent significant delays in completing either the electrification or high-speed train work. For example, in 1997 Amtrak proposed hiring a second contractor to help install electric pole foundations when installation rates decreased to an unacceptable level, and, in 1998, Amtrak made acceleration payments to help finish the electrification work. Despite these efforts, the line between Boston and New Haven was not fully energized until July 2000-about a year later than planned.28 Amtrak attempted to use recovery plans-plans designed to identify specific actions to be taken to get a project \"back on track\"-to address problems. But Amtrak did not assemble any programlevel (projectwide) recovery plan for the project as a whole. A former project director said a program-level recovery plan was not used because the components of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project were not mutually dependent on each other. Not assembling comprehensive project management or program-level recovery plans made it difficult for Amtrak's senior management and Board of Directors to effectively manage the project and assign accountability for project results. A comprehensive project management plan similar to FRA's 1994 master plan could have allowed senior management and the Board of Directors to clearly understand the status of the project at any given point 28As of fall 2003, the electrification work had still not been completed and Amtrak had not accepted the final system. and how problems in one project component could be affecting other project components. Such a plan could also have facilitated understanding how difficulties in one or more project components could affect the ultimate success of the entire project and achievement of project goals. For example, as noted earlier, FRA's 1994 master plan identified the planned improvements to Metro-North Railroad's New Rochelle interlocking (the \"Shell interlocking\") as critical for achieving 3-hour service. Metro-North officials said that Amtrak did not work collaboratively with them on improving the Shell interlocking but instead imposed its own solution for improving the interlocking. In the late 1990s, cost increases to the proposed flyover led Amtrak to scale back its design to an at-grade improvement. Based on the documents we reviewed, it was not clear that Amtrak's Board of Directors had an understanding of the effect of not completing either the Shell interlocking or other critical infrastructure improvements. Moreover, the lack of program-level recovery plans made it difficult to identify specific actions being taken to correct problems, who was responsible for these actions, when they would be completed, and expected outcomes. Such information was critical for maintaining accountability for the project and the conditions affecting the project's outcomes. Again, project documents we reviewed did not indicate that Amtrak's Board of Directors had a comprehensive understanding of project recovery efforts and expected outcomes. Financial Management of the Project Was Also Not Comprehensive and Was Largely Focused on the Short Term Amtrak's financial management of the project was also not comprehensive, and it also focused primarily on the short term. Amtrak's plans for financial management were similar to its project management plans, in that they addressed only individual work elements. In addition, these plans, which Amtrak called \"spend plans,\" were based largely on annual appropriations and focused on spending for a single fiscal year. Although the spend plans contained many of the elements of a financial plan-such as the total cost of each major work element in current-year dollars, a cumulative estimate of expected spending on each of these elements through the end of the current fiscal year, and the cumulative spending on each element to date- they were not comprehensive and only allowed Amtrak to identify shortterm funding shortfalls for individual work components and not longerterm funding needs and potential shortfalls for the entire project. The spend plans also did not track the three milestones and 72 work elements laid out in the FRA master plan or incorporate funding needs and spending by non-Amtrak stakeholders, both of which would have allowed a more comprehensive financial management of the entire project and potentially linked spending to a \"useful segment.\" OMB defines a \"useful segment\" as a component that either (1) provides information allowing an organization to plan the capital project, develop the design, and assess benefits, costs, and risks before proceeding to full acquisition, or (2) results in a useful asset for which the benefits exceed the costs even if no further funding is appropriated. Not having a stable, long-term source of funding for the project contributed to the effects of Amtrak's short-term approach to financial management. To fund its portion of the project, Amtrak relied on annual appropriations, and the amount of appropriations was not certain from year to year. Although direct appropriations for the project from 1992 through 1998 (when direct appropriations ended) averaged just under $200 million per year, they ranged from $250 million in 1998 to $115 million in 1996. According to FRA's master plan, about $265 million per year (in 1993 dollars) would be needed from all parties from 1995 through 2001 to achieve 3-hour service. Both Amtrak and FRA officials told us that dependence on annual appropriations hurt the project, and one Amtrak official said this type of funding cycle constrained capital planning and financing for the project and focused on the short rather than long term. Amtrak Worked With Stakeholders on Numerous Project Work Elements, but Did Not Fully Integrate Stakeholders' Interests into the Project Amtrak worked with numerous stakeholders on certain work elements, but did not fully integrate their interests into the project. Not fully integrating stakeholders' interests-particularly, non-Amtrak track owners and users, such as commuter and freight railroads-into the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project hindered Amtrak's achievement of the project's goals, particularly along sections of the north-end of the Northeast Corridor that Amtrak does not own. In its 1994 master plan, FRA emphasized that it was critical for Amtrak to involve other stakeholders in planning, designing, and financing the project to ensure its completion and to achieve the 3-hour trip time between Boston and New York City. The 1994 master plan also emphasized the importance of completing stakeholder-related work, including capacity enhancement, in order to ensure the future reliability of high-speed service in light of expected intercity and commuter rail traffic growth. According to Amtrak, one premise of the project laid out in the FRA master plan was that improvements made to benefit Amtrak were not to adversely affect other track users-that is, other track users were to be \"held harmless\" for these improvements. Amtrak officials said this premise significantly increased the importance of involving stakeholders. To help ensure that federal, state, and local concerns would be addressed, Amtrak established a project office in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. Amtrak communicated with other Northeast Corridor track owners and users, holding regularly scheduled meetings and entering into work agreements with them. Amtrak worked with commuter rail and state officials to accommodate work that was required to begin electrified service between Boston and New York City. For example, Amtrak worked closely with MBTA on several work elements, including refurbishment of Canton Viaduct and construction of new platforms at the Route 128 passenger rail station, to make sure electrified service could begin. Some officials we spoke with complimented Amtrak's handling of stakeholder involvement. Yet other commuter rail and state officials believed that Amtrak did not fully integrate their interests into the project's goals. For example, some track users alleged that after Amtrak obtained their agreement to proceed with the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, it managed the project with little regard for their interests. In their view, Amtrak did the work required to accommodate high-speed trains and reduce trip times, but it did little to focus on capacity enhancement or other work needed to accommodate expected growth in commuter and freight rail traffic in future years-a key aspect of FRA's master plan for achieving and maintaining faster trip times. An official with the state of Rhode Island, for example, told us that Amtrak's management of corridor improvements \"bogged down\" its efforts to complete their Freight Rail Improvement Project-a program to facilitate and grow freight railroad traffic in Rhode Island. Regarding the latter, Amtrak observed that this project was significantly behind in its development and that it paid to do preliminary design work related to the project in order to facilitate placement of catenary poles for the electrification work. Officials from Metro-North Railroad also told us that Amtrak's agenda has generally been to take care of its own needs and spend money on its tracks, and commuter railroads could take care of their own needs. In their opinion, better cooperation and collaboration would have made the work go faster and more smoothly. Completing the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project- particularly the goal of 3-hour service between Boston and New York City-will continue to require collaboration between Amtrak and other stakeholders. Most of the work elements critical for achieving the trip-time goal that are not yet completed are on sections of track that Amtrak does not own, particularly on the 56-mile section of track owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York and the Connecticut Department of Transportation. According to Metro-North officials, hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funds will be needed to address infrastructure issues between New Haven and New Rochelle to achieve 3-hour service between Boston and New York City. They estimated that at least four bridges (costing $130 million to $150 million each) would require replacement and most of the 60 curves between New Haven and New York City would require modification. This might not only be prohibitively expensive but also potentially require property acquisition, which, because the track is in an urban setting, could be difficult due to existing development and involve significant condemnation issues. A Metro-North Railroad official estimated that gaining 1 minute or so in triptime savings could cost $200 million or more. FRA's Oversight of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project Was Limited Although providing millions of federal dollars to the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, FRA-the primary federal agency involved with the project-provided little oversight of the project, generally because its management adopted the position that it lacked legislative authority to do so. Instead, FRA saw itself only as a conduit for funds from the federal government to Amtrak-a role entailing far less oversight than the Federal Transit Administration's role as the manager of a project management oversight program for the recipients of federal grants for major mass transit projects. FRA was also legally responsible for preparing environmental assessments for the project and developing track and passenger railcar safety standards, and it carried out these responsibilities. FRA officials said the agency provided little oversight because (1) it did not have the resources or the authority to change Amtrak's project management, (2) Congress did not grant FRA specific legislative authority to conduct such oversight, and (3) FRA did not have a formal mechanism (such as a project management oversight process) for providing oversight. We agree with FRA's view that it had limited authority to oversee the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. For fiscal year 2003, Congress increased FRA's responsibility to provide oversight of and accountability for federal funds used for intercity passenger rail service, but this responsibility extends only to fiscal year 2003 funds. FRA Adopted Position That In general, FRA adopted the position that it lacked specific authority to It Had Limited Authority to oversee the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. According to Oversee the Project the agency, its primary responsibility is to enforce federal law as it relates to railroad safety. To protect railroad employees and the public, FRA carries out this responsibility by developing and administering safety statutes, regulations, and programs; conducting research on railroad safety and national transportation policy; and inspecting railroad track, equipment, signals, and railroad operating practices. It also plays a role in enforcing regulations applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials by rail. According to FRA officials, the agency did not have specific legislative authority to oversee the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. Consequently, it did not have any particular authority to direct Amtrak's management of the project by, for example, requiring Amtrak to prepare project management or finance plans. FRA officials told us they saw themselves as responsible primarily for making federal funding available for the project. While FRA, as grantor for the government, is responsible for ensuring that grant funds are used for their intended purposes, FRA officials said they did not believe they were responsible for exercising any specific management oversight of continuing work on the Northeast Corridor improvements or for ensuring the success of high-speed rail after Amtrak assumed the responsibility for managing the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project in 1985. In their view, both of these responsibilities lay with Amtrak. Accordingly, FRA officials provided little guidance for planning or for assessing and mitigating risks to major capital rail projects after 1985-a position they believed was consistent with congressional direction that limited FRA's oversight of grants to Amtrak before fiscal year 2003. Under the 1985 grant agreement that transferred the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project to Amtrak, FRA retained responsibility to formally accept completed work and to audit the expenditure of funds to ensure that monies provided by the federal government were spent for their intended purposes. Amtrak was required to periodically provide reports concerning work status, budget, and accounting matters. Between 1986 and 1998, the grant agreement was amended 21 times. Some of these amendments added work covered by the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project, such as the electrification work. In 1992, FRA and Amtrak amended the agreement to allow FRA to provide support to and coordination of the project. According to FRA, this included getting the environmental assessment started, preparing the 1994 Master Plan, and helping coordinate project activities among Amtrak, commuter railroads, and others. However, under the agreement Amtrak retained full authority to decide issues pertaining to property it owned and operated. Given these circumstances, we agree with FRA's view that it was not authorized to exercise direct oversight of the project. Over time, Congress removed responsibility for the management and execution of improvements to the Northeast Corridor from FRA and gave it to Amtrak. As part of the Passenger Railroad Rebuilding Act of 1980, Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to enter into an agreement with Amtrak to reallocate authority and responsibility for track improvements connected with the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project and to transfer responsibility for the project to Amtrak by October 1, 1985. This transfer made Amtrak responsible for implementing project goals Congress had previously mandated, and thus relieved FRA of its responsibilities in this regard. Congress later imposed additional duties on the Secretary of Transportation in relation to Northeast Corridor improvements. For example, the 1992 Amtrak Authorization and Development Act directed the Secretary of Transportation to prepare a program master plan for Northeast Corridor improvements in consultation with Amtrak and commuter and freight railroads. Congress continued to reaffirm Amtrak's central role in managing these improvements and high-speed rail work. Prior to 2003, there was no clear indication that Congress intended for FRA to reassume responsibility for conduct of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. Rather, according to FRA, Congress intended for the agency to principally act as a conduit of project funds appropriated for Amtrak's use. Therefore, we believe there is a basis in law for FRA acting primarily as a conduit of project funds and not to conduct oversight. FRA's limited oversight role contrasts with the stronger oversight role that Congress assigned to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in 1987, when it directed FTA to establish a project management oversight program29 to better safeguard the federal investment in transit projects funded through the agency's fixed guideway grants program (called the \"New Starts\" program).30 Under the project management oversight program, contractors serve as an extension of FTA's technical staff to assess the project management and technical capacity of New Starts grantees and their capability to successfully implement major capital projects. In addition, contractors monitor projects to make sure they are on time, within budget, and in accordance with their plans and specifications. In 1998, FTA expanded its oversight efforts to include an assessment of 29The Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 authorized FTA's project management oversight program. This program is codified at 49 U.S.C. S:5327 and implemented through regulations codified at 49 C.F.R. part 633. 30New Starts is an FTA program for starting fixed guideway projects to fund up to 80 percent of the cost of transit system projects that use separate and exclusive rights-of-way, as well as for extensions of existing systems. grantees' financial capacity and the financial impact of major projects on existing transit systems. These reviews, conducted by independent accounting firms, assess a grantee's financial health and are performed before FTA commits funds for construction. The program is financed by a set-aside of funds available under various FTA programs.31 FRA does not have a project management oversight program similar to FTA's. FRA Focused on Environmental and Safety Activities, Not Oversight While FRA had little clear oversight responsibility for the project, it was involved with other activities, such as assessing the environmental impact of electrifying the line between Boston and New Haven and developing safety regulations for the high-speed rail service planned for the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project.32 Federal laws and requirements dictated FRA's involvement with these activities: o Consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Council of Environmental Quality's requirements, FRA's Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts requires that either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement be prepared for all major FRA actions that could have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. According to an FRA official, FRA prepared an environmental impact statement for the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project's electrification work because the project was considered to be a \"major action\" that could have significant impact on the environment. o FRA, as the federal agency responsible for railroad safety, was also required to develop safety standards to facilitate the high-speed rail service planned under the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. The Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act of 199233 required FRA to review and revise its track safety standards. As part of this review, in July 1997 FRA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to 31FTA's project management oversight program is financed from 0.75 percent of funds available under 49 U.S.C. S:5309, and 0.5 percent of funds available under 49 U.S.C. S:5307 and S:5311. In fiscal year 2002, FTA received about $29 million to conduct its project management oversight program. 32According to Amtrak, FRA had some involvement with the acquisition of the high-speed trains. This included numerous meetings between Amtrak and FRA officials and FRA participation in planning, requirements testing, and design work. 33As amended by the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1994. amend its track safety standards to include new standards for track to be used by high-speed trains. The revised standards, made final in 1998, included three additional classes of track that would permit passenger rail trains to travel up to 200 miles per hour.34 FRA officials said the standards for high-speed rail service were developed at Amtrak's request to accommodate train speeds of up to 150 miles per hour envisioned under the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. o In addition, the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1994 required FRA to develop safety standards for passenger equipment, including passenger rail cars. Such standards did not previously exist. FRA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking establishing safety standards for passenger rail cars in 1996, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 1997, and a Final Rule in 1999. According to FRA, these standards reflected the agency's desire to ensure safety in the context of an ever more complex passenger railroad operating environment (including higher train speeds). These standards accommodate highspeed rail service. Apart from these activities, FRA's direct involvement with the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project was limited, reflecting a decrease, FRA officials said, in the resources that FRA devoted to the project after the management of the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project was transferred from FRA to Amtrak in 1985. At that time, about 50 to 60 individuals who had been detailed to FRA to work on the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project returned to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),35 and FRA closed its project office and reduced the number of FRA full-time employees working on the project from between 8 and 10 to less than 1. FRA officials said the latter individual was primarily responsible for monitoring the completion of outstanding work on the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, ensuring compliance with the final environmental record of decision, and serving as an ombudsman between FRA and Amtrak. In addition, this individual helped coordinate 34Federal regulations currently have nine classes of railroad track (Class 1 through Class 9) that permit passenger trains to operate at speeds of between 15 miles per hour (Class 1) and 200 miles per hour (Class 9). Track standards were prepared for speeds up to 200 miles per hour to accommodate the development of high-speed rail systems around the country. 35According to an FRA official, FHWA employees were detailed to work on Northeast Corridor Improvement Project activities because they had both engineering and infrastructure management expertise and because they would be needed only temporarily (up to 5 years), since the project was expected to be short term. the project with local agencies as well as commuter and freight railroads. Although FRA tracked federal spending on the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project and checked on project progress, agency officials said FRA's authority to change how Amtrak managed this project was limited. FRA could raise matters of concern at meetings of Amtrak's Board of Directors, they said, but the agency was one of seven votes and had no unilateral authority to change Amtrak's decisions. Finally, FRA officials said, Congress did not specify a desire for them to be proactive in overseeing the project. Rather, in the officials' view, FRA was to serve largely as a conduit of federal funds to Amtrak and little else. Amtrak's management of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project was also subject to limited oversight from the Inspector General for Amtrak and the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Inspector Generals. Although Amtrak's Inspector General devoted 8 to 10 staff and created two groups to review the project's activities, much of this work was specific to contract matters rather than program management issues. Amtrak's Inspector General told us that ongoing claims disputes, criminal investigations, and litigation over the Acela Express trains have precluded his office from conducting broader audits of the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project's program management. In addition, he said that because the project is not yet considered complete, it would not currently be appropriate to conduct a programmatic review of the project. Amtrak's Inspector General also told us there are certain lessons learned from the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project that he has recently reinforced with Amtrak's Chief Engineer. Similarly, DOT Inspector General officials said they had not conducted much oversight of the project either. The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 required the DOT Inspector General to annually assess the financial requirements of Amtrak. As a result, the office produced several reports on this issue. However, only one report issued by the DOT Inspector General directly addressed the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project. This report discussed the progress of the electrification work.36 In Amtrak's fiscal year 2003 appropriations legislation, Congress adopted measures to increase the Secretary of Transportation's responsibility for providing oversight of and accountability for the federal funds used for intercity passenger rail service. Among other things, these measures 36U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General, Amtrak's High-Speed Rail Electrification Project (December 1999). require that Amtrak transmit a business plan to the Secretary of Transportation and Congress, supplemented by monthly reports describing work completed, changes to the business plan, and reasons for the changes. The business plan was to describe the work to be funded using federal funds. Furthermore, on or after March 1, 2003, Amtrak was only permitted to use fiscal year 2003 and 2004 federal capital expense and improvement grant funds for purposes included in its business plans.37 Finally, Amtrak was required to agree to certain terms and conditions that would, among other things, improve its financial controls and accounting transparency and seek operating cost reductions. Although these measures acted to impact DOT's role with respect to the expenditure of federal funds provided to Amtrak, the measures apply only to expenditures financed with fiscal year 2003 and 2004 funds and are not necessarily directed to the oversight of any particular infrastructure project that might be financed with funds provided prior to fiscal year 2003. FRA officials also said that the appropriations act did not provide any additional resources analogous to that given to FTA (such as a takedown from various program funds) to conduct oversight. Best Practices Framework Would Support Effective Management of Large-Scale Intercity Passenger Rail Infrastructure Projects Through our work on the Northeast High-Speed Rail Improvement Project and our analyses of reports and guidance published by our office, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), FTA, and FHWA,38 we have identified key components of a best practices framework for effectively managing large infrastructure projects, including future intercity passenger rail projects. These best practices offer guidance for project managers and decision makers and include the following: o Conduct comprehensive planning. Effective planning can include developing a preconstruction planning process, using the resulting preconstruction plans to implement a project, and evaluating the project's success by comparing the actual results with those planned.39 37Additional restrictions were placed on grants to cover operating losses. 38See app. III for a discussion of the methodology we used to compile this framework and app. V for a list of best practices sources. 39Planning is linked to an organization's strategic goals, which are based on a needs assessment that identifies the need for a project. o Assess risks and identify mitigation measures. Early identification and assessment of risks to a project allow for prompt intervention. o Comprehensively manage the project's finances. Tools for financial management can include project financial plans that provide for accurately estimating and effectively controlling costs. o Establish accountability and oversight for prudent use of resources. Assigning responsibility for a project and tying its performance to pay and personnel decisions can help ensure accountability for the project's results. In"
