        "text": "Since 1919, The American Legion has been represented by its emblem. As we look to the next era of The American Legion, the time has come for a new brand mark to be used in marketing, communications and promotional materials.\n\nThe new brand mark does not replace the emblem. Instead, both the emblem and the brand mark are to be used in specific applications that will better serve The American Legion going forward.\n\nWe are approximately 5 miles east of the Bronx Zoo and Botanical Gardens on Pelham Parkway. Use exit 8B from Interstate 95 (I-95), or exit 5 from Hutchinson River Parkway. For GPS use 550 City Island Avenue, zip-code 10464.\n\nFrom Midtown Manhattan\n\nTake the RFK, (Triboro) bridge to The Bronx. Take the Bruckner Expressway north to the New England Thruway (I-95 North) to exit 8B ‚Äù Orchard Beach/ City Island, Follow signs through Pelham Bay Park to 550 City Island Ave.\n\nFrom Westchester County\n\nTake the Hutchinson River Parkway south to exit 5, or I-95 South to exit 8B, Follow signs through Pelham Bay Park to 550 City Island Ave."
