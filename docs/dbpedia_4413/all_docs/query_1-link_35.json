        "text": "The largest park in New York City is more than three times the size of Central Park and you’ve probably never heard of it. You might not even know where to look. On most days of the year you’ll have vast swaths of it to yourself if you go there. There are endless forests, empty coves, and miles of trails. And if you walk far enough through it, you’ll stumble over a bridge and into a fishing village on an island that, like the park, you’ve probably never heard of. All of this is a train ride a way, and all within New York City limits.\n\nGrowing up, I devoured books for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I dreamt of one day having the entirety of The Encyclopedia Britannica and The World Book neatly organized along a withered shelf that would line my future home (which was, I was 110% positive, going to be a six-bedroom on the beach in Australia with a rocket launch pad and inside would have a mini train track system suspended from the ceiling with open-basket carts that would chug from room to room at the touch of a button...the vision was that I could then throw my laundry or anything else I’d like to pass on from one room to another without having to get up and leave the room, even pass notes to my sisters down the hall [somehow in this fantasy I’m an adult but my sisters still live in perpetual childhood down the hall]...naturally laundry chutes hadn’t yet made their way into my nascent mind but such is the blissful ignorance of a childhood imagination). The centerpiece of the whole house would be a dusty and enchanted wardrobe just like the one in Chronicles of Narnia. As a Californian whose understanding of seasons was reduced to a binary division of days that are above 75 F and days that are below it, the idea that I could step out of my beach-centric sunny life and into a magical, ice-filled, and dead-quiet winter forest was the ultimate dream (nowadays the dream of an Australian-beach-house-with-custom-laundry-train-system-slash-private-rocket-launchpad has been reduced to hoping that one day I’ll have a one bedroom of my own in New York, arguably far loftier than the original plan).\n\nHow else would I get to Narnia than with a fantastical port-hole? To a forest of silence, an endless maze of dead trees and frozen ponds, of desolate trails and cloudy skies and no sounds of traffic, of tourists, of even the waves? (when you grow up with eternal sun, you sometimes dream of gloomy weather and darkness….humans are never content I suppose...I bet I would’ve loved wintering in Cleveland as a child)\n\nCan only one doorway take us to places like Narnia? One magical cabinet? Or do such places exist at all in a city? Is quietude reserved only for those willing to jump in a car and drive far beyond the boundless reaches the urban landscape? Or is it right there, under our noses, hiding in plain sight? And if so, how in the hell do you get there?\n\nIt’s easy.\n\nYou take the Uptown 6 train to the end of the line.\n\nI’m talking about Pelham Bay Park and City Island. Both of these places could not feel farther from what most consider “New York”, making a walk between them, in my opinion, a must-have experience for anyone living or visiting the city. That’s exactly what I did on a surprisingly balmy February day this past week and I’ve never felt more transported in my endless number of extraordinarily random trips around NYC.\n\nThe most common argument people make for not wanting to live in a city is the lack of proximity to Nature, and I get that. It’s not an entirely wrong assumption by any means and the vast majority of American cities lack significant open space. When you see photos of Midtown or Wall Street, you’re fairly led to the impression that New York is the epitome of this problem.\n\nIn a place where buildings block out the sun, with rats of such girth that they could be excusably mistaken for hideous puppies and the most significant topography is the mounds of trash bags that lay exposed in the street and sometimes freeze together to create small mountain ranges not bound by the limitations of plate tectonics….one can be forgiven for forgetting that the Atlantic Ocean is a couple miles away and old growth forests abound within a half hour’s distance of Times Square. And worst of all, most folks think Central Park is really all there is to work with.\n\nMany, very fairly, also think Central Park is the biggest in NYC.\n\nIt is America’s most visited public park, it is massive, it is the most filmed park in the world, and it is incredible, end of story. It is the golden standard of landscape architecture.\n\nI love it.\n\nYou should absolutely go if you ever find yourself here.\n\nIt’s not, however, even in my top five within the city. (which are, for those of you who’ll hound me: Prospect Park (Brooklyn), Inwood Hill Park (the best place in the city on a rainy summer afternoon and last remaining old growth forest in Manhattan), Van Cortlandt Park (Bronx, NYC’s third-largest), Sunset Park (Brooklyn, for its mind-shattering views), and Pelham Bay Park (Bronx), with a notable mention of Fort Greene Park due to its role in Walt Whitman’s writing of famed poetic epic Leaves of Grass that in turn birthed a genuine American literary identity, also it’s seven blocks from my house so I’m unabashedly biased here, and lastly when the leaves fall off you get an epic view of the city through the trees).\n\nCentral Park, as I’ve touched on before, is in fact only New York’s 5th largest park. Many more believe it’s the largest park in the country, when it’s not even close. Pelham Bay is only the 38th largest city park in America.…Central Park is meanwhile the 134th American largest park within a city’s limits. That honor goes to Chugach State Park in Anchorage, Alaska, at 490,125 acres. Other notable parks in cities outside New York still crush Central Park: LA’s crown jewel, Griffith Park, is the 22nd largest, while one of my personal favorites in the strange realm of urban oases, Chicago’s Lincoln Park, is 94th in size.\n\nWith my vomiting of park acreage ranking statistics now out of the way and cleaned up off the floor, we can finally move on to the reason why you should take the journey there.\n\nBut first, more on the journey itself. There is always, at least for me, a sense of wonder around what lies at the end of the line. In New York the vast majority of folks never go to these places. The NYC Subway reaches out like giant sea kelp from the dark ocean floor, with most people down so deep in the urban darkness of Lower Manhattan that they never follow the algal thread outward to where they’ll reach the light.\n\nThis metaphor might sound like a stretch (and many of mine are) but I’m of the opinion that its strikingly relevant, both experientially and geographically. In most of Manhattan (until you get north of Central Park) and some of Brooklyn you’ll spend the entirety of your time underground if you take the train, down “below the surface”. As you travel outwards, to the farther reaches of Brooklyn, uptown in Manhattan, east into Queens or most of the Bronx, you’ll eventually rise out of the depths and see the (cloudy) light of day. It’s always an incredible experience, suddenly gaining your bearings after miles of travel below the tallest buildings in America. Travel along elevated track is my favorite type of travel period, even more than flying (looking at you, Chicago, you sexy beast of a town…God I love the L). You get a surreal perspective on a city without losing the fidelity you would from the height of an airplane: you whiz by people talking in the streets, kids throwing the ball around, dogs peeing on things, taxi drivers screaming at each other, random parades celebrating a cause you’ll never know and all else that comes with being here. You are at eye level with or just above the sea of buildings, eliciting a visceral understanding of the imperial scale of the city in a way that is paradoxically lost on you when you walk through Midtown and simply forget to look up.\n\nThe ride on the Uptown 6 is one of the purest embodiments of this dark-to-light transition. Unlike other lines that immediately emerge to elevated track upon entering their respective outer boroughs, the 6 actually stays submerged for awhile within The Bronx...meaning that when you do finally shoot up for air, you are IN IT. Be sure to look out the right side of the window at Whitlock Ave station to peer out over the Bronx River and down onto an abandoned station that looks to be straight out of I, Robot (did anyone actually watch that? Can I admit that I liked it? Also, right now, while writing this sentence at Stumptown Coffee Roasters at 30 West 8th in Greenwich Village, a jaded nano-influencer / part-time NYU student with bleach-white Balenciagas and multi-colored eye shadow just looked over and in seeing that I was reading the I, Robot Rotten Tomatoes reviews page, cringed with an un-fakeable disappointment).\n\nThis part of the Bronx is as good as it gets for voyeuristic train riding. Similarly to how I described the perspectives from the B/D/F in South Brooklyn in last week’s article about Coney Island and Brighton Island , the views of The Bronx from the uptown 6 are nothing short of incredible. Many people fail to realize how urban it is, when in fact much of the West Bronx is as dense and sometimes even denser than Manhattan and puts much of Brooklyn to shame. These are some real-ass urban neighborhoods, my friends. Towers upon towers upon towers, each with thousands of people living in them, all with their own story. Bodegas for miles. Art Deco apartments as far as the eye can see.\n\nI love coming up here.\n\nThis is no short walk from the train the City Island, mind you. It’s around 3 miles each way. I later discovered that there’s a bus that runs between the station and the island (see below, I took it on the way back), but such is the risk (and adventure) of traveling around New York with your phone turned off. But it’s a walk worth taking. It’s just the right distance to let a moderate weariness and frustration set in. Just as you’re about to pull out and call an Uber or turn around, the bridge to City Island appears as you round a corner. It makes no sense that this place exists and I’m so glad it does.\n\nBefore I traversed the bridge, I took in the view of Long Island Sound. This’ll sound stupid, given that I’ve worked as a cartographer in the past and literally have a degree in geography, but I totally forgot that I’d be seeing the Sound. I’d never seen it, and in a similar vein to the first time my naive West Coast eyes witnessed the infinite plane that is Lake Michigan, I stopped dead in my tracks. It opened up and reached out to the horizon with towns along its banks in the distance and a spattering of small rocky islets in the foreground. Having never experienced this formidable body of water I thought it prudent to wander off the road to its shore.\n\nI stepped my way over there in a clumsy stupor, my feet taking irregular steps as my gaze refused to break contact with this lake-looking-thing that was somehow filled with seawater.\n\nI know what you might be thinking...isn’t this kid from Southern California? Why’s he surprised by the Sound of all things? Great point, but it’s a little different. We do have bays (Mission Bay in San Diego being the nearest considerable example to my boyhood home of Laguna Beach), but they don’t dive deep back into the landscape the way the Sound does. The closest thing I can think of is San Francisco Bay (or better yet, Tomales Bay in the Point Reyes National Seashore north of San Fransico, which looks a lot like Long Island Sound in shape if you rotate it) but I’m not up there that often because Northern California is another state with no formal diplomatic relations with Southern California and I don’t speak the local languages of Python or Javascript to feel like I’d survive in that city for more than a day or two. So anyways, I walked over to this sandy path and emerged into a cove. I heard some salsa music playing and accidentally surprised a group of Colombian men (I know they were Colombian because I lived in Colombia and heard the accent in their Spanish) who were day-drinking around a makeshift fire and an old boombox. I gave them a courtesy nod, they gave one back, and walked on. Struck by its placidity and still unable to grasp that this was an arm of the Atlantic Ocean and not a lake, I felt like a kid discovering tide pools for the first time when I noticed mussels and oyster shells. Looking up the shore to my left I saw a coastline of meadows and trees meeting the sea. I now know that if you keep going you’ll reach Orchard Beach but I had no idea at the time where exactly it was (again, phone turned off as always). I took some photos and headed back to the road and crossed the bridge to City Island."
