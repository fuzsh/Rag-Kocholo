The underlying geography is derived from the Department of City Planning's COGIS project. Through COGIS, the Department of City Planning is responsible for maintaining the city's base map for all city agencies. The attribute information is the Department of City Planning's PLUTO database application.

The Department of City Planning is in the process of conflating (i.e., graphically aligning) the COGIS files to precision aerial photography of the city. Over time, this will increase the spatial accuracy of the files. This release of COGIS is at an intermediate stage of conflation.\n\nSpatial Data Organization Information\n\nDirect Spatial Reference Method\n\nVector\n\nPoint and Vector Object Information\n\nSDTS Terms Description\n\nSDTS Point and Vector Object Type\n\nGT-polygon composed of chains\n\nPoint and Vector Object Count\n\n320007\n\nSpatial Reference Information\n\nHorizontal Coordinate System Definition\n\nPlanar\n\nMap Projection\n\nMap Projection Name\n\nNAD 1983 StatePlane New York Long Island FIPS 3104 Feet\n\nLambert Conformal Conic\n\nStandard Parallel\n\n40.66666666666666\n\nStandard Parallel\n\n41.03333333333333\n\nLongitude of Central Meridian\n\n-74.0\n\nLatitude of Projection Origin\n\n40.16666666666666\n\nFalse Easting\n\n984250.0\n\nFalse Northing\n\n0.0\n\nPlanar Coordinate Information\n\nPlanar Coordinate Encoding Method\n\ncoordinate pair\n\nCoordinate Representation\n\nAbscissa Resolution\n\n0.00000002687262634637478\n\nOrdinate Resolution\n\n0.00000002687262634637478\n\nPlanar Distance Units\n\nfoot_us\n\nGeodetic Model\n\nHorizontal Datum Name\n\nD North American 1983\n\nEllipsoid Name\n\nGRS 1980\n\nSemi-major Axis\n\n6378137.0\n\nDenominator of Flattening Ratio\n\n298.257222101\n\nEntity and Attribute Information\n\nEntity Type\n\nEntity Type Label\n\nPLUTO_QN_04\n\nEntity Type Definition\n\nTax lots.\n\nEntity Type Definition Source\n\nNYC COGIS\n\nAttributes\n\nFID\n\nInternal feature number.

The BOROUGH codes associated with these areas are the boroughs they are legally located in. Specifically, Marble hill is serviced by the Bronx but is legally located in Manhattan and has a Manhattan BOROUGH code. Rikers Island has a Bronx BOROUGH code because it is legally located in the Bronx although it is serviced by Queens.\n\nBlock\n\nThe tax block in which the tax lot is located. Each tax block is unique within a borough (see BOROUGH). (Coordinates defining the features.)\n\nDefinition Source\n\nDepartment of Finance - RPAD Master File\n\nLot\n\nThe number of the tax lot. Each tax lot is unique within a tax block (see BLOCK).\n\nDefinition Source\n\nDepartment of Finance - RPAD Master File\n\nAttribute Value Accuracy Explanation\n\nEach unit in a building that is a condominium is defined by the Department of Finance as a separate tax lot. To make condominium information more compatible with parcel information, the Deparment of City Planning aggregated condominium unit tax lot information so that each condominium complex within a tax block is represented by only one tax lot record. A condominium complex is defined as one or more structures or properties under the auspicies of the same condominium association. The Department of City Planning then assigned the condominium billing tax lot number to the condominium complex tax lot record. If the Department of Finance has not yet assigned a billing tax lot number to the condominium complex then the lowest tax lot number within the condominium complex was used.\n\nCD\n\nCommunity district (CD) or joint interest area (JIA) the tax lot is located in, or partially located.\n\n101-112\n\nManhattan Community Districts\n\n164\n\nCentral Park (JIA)\n\n201-212\n\nBronx Community Districts\n\n226\n\nVan Cortlandt Park (JIA)\n\n227\n\nBronx Park (JIA)\n\n228\n\nPelham Bay Park (JIA)\n\n301-318\n\nBrooklyn Community Districts\n\n355\n\nProspect Park (JIA)\n\n356\n\nBrooklyn Gateway National Reacreation Area (JIA)\n\n401-414\n\nQueens Community Districts\n\n480\n\nLaGuardia Airport (JIA)\n\n481\n\nFlushing Meadow / Corona Park (JIA)\n\n482\n\nForest Park (JIA)\n\n483\n\nJFK International Airport (JIA)\n\n484\n\nQueens Gateway National Recreation Area (JIA)\n\n501-503\n\nStaten Island Community Districts\n\n595\n\nStaten Island Gateway National Recreation Area (JIA)\n\nDefinition Source\n\nDepartment of City Planning based on data from: Department of Finance - RPAD Master File, Department of City Planning - Tax Block and Tax Lot Not Clipped to the Shoreline, Department of City Planning - Geosupport System\n\nAttribute Value Accuracy\n\nOnly one data source is used per tax lot.\n\nAttribute Value Accuracy Explanation\n\nThe Tax Block and Lot Not Clipped to Shoreline File is used as the source when Tax Block and Lot Not Clipped to Shoreline File identifies a community district for a tax lot. Otherwise the community district number is obtained from the Department of City Planning Geosupport System. If the community district is not available from the Geosupport System the DOF-RPAD Master File is used.Two portions of the city, Marble Hill and Rikers Island, are legally located in one borough and are each serviced by different boroughs. The cd2 codes associated with these areas are the community districts they are serviced by. Specifically, Marble Hill is legally located in Manhattan but is serviced by the Bronx and has Bronx cd2 codes of 207 or 208. Rikers Island has a Queens cd2 code of 401 since it is serviced by Queens even though it is legally located in the Bronx.\n\nCT2000\n\nThe 2000 US Census tract in which the tax lot is located.

Queens house numbers contain a hyphen. Some tax lots, such as vacant lots or parks, have a street name and no house number.\n\nZoneDist1\n\nThe primary zoning district classification of the tax lot. If the tax lot is divided by a zoning boundary line, zoneDist1, represents the primary zoning district classification occupying the greatest percentage of the tax lot's area.\n\nR1-1 - R10H\n\nResidential Districts\n\nC1-6 - C8-4\n\nCommercial Districts\n\nM1-1 - M3-2\n\nManufacturing Districts\n\nNZS\n\nNo Zoning\n\nBPC\n\nBattery Park City\n\nPARK\n\nPark Property\n\nblank\n\nZoning Unknown in Department of Finance File\n\nPARKNY\n\nProperty under the jurisdiction of NYS Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation.\n\nDefinition Source\n\nDepartment of City Planning based on data from: Department of Finance - Zoning File, Department of City Planning - Zoning Resolution Maps\n\nAttribute Value Accuracy Explanation\n\nSee SplitZone to determine if the tax lot is divided.\n\nZoneDist2\n\nIf the tax lot is divided by zoning boundary lines, zoneDist2, represents the primary zoning classification occupying the second greatest percentage of the tax lot's area.
