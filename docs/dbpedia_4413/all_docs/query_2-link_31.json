        "text": "One day last summer the Big Guy came home with a large box and two life preservers announcing we were now the proud owners of an inflatable kayak.\n\nWe took it out of the box and launched it only once last summer and then again a couple of weeks ago. I named it the SS Barracuda after the barracuda I caught in Jamaica last spring.\n\nOrchard Beach has a lagoon with a kayak and canoe launch. Who knew? After passing the “toll booths” into the beach parking lot, make a left and head to the northwest corner. The launch is there.\n\nThe lagoon is actually quite calm and restful. We like to drift and watch the shadows on the trees cast by the airplanes on descent into LaGuardia.\n\nThe SS Barracuda is a two person kayak and we haven’t ventured out beyond this protected lagoon. It opens out into the mouth of the Long Island Sound after all and I’m a little chicken about mixing in with boat traffic and tides in an inflatable kayak. I can feel the current sloshing under my cheeks and that’s just enough for me for now.\n\nOur paddling technique, though, is getting better, we spin around less. (Our paddle was too short, better once we extended it.) We met canoers who’d spent a couple of hours out. There are many small islands off the coast of the Bronx. One couple told us they went out to “the bridge”. I thought the Throgs Neck Bridge, but we think she was referring to the City Island Bridge, which would be a much safer trip.\n\nThe Orchard Beach Lagoon is one of five kayak and canoe launches in the Bronx on the New York City Water Trail. A permit is required to put a canoe / kayak in the water (it’s accessible from the NYC Parks Department).\n\n*\n\nTell a friend, or two, about this post…\n\nSunday morning I made pancakes and turkey sausage, filled our thermoses with steaming hot chai, packed it all up and we ate outside at Orchard Beach. I wanted to see how the snow was looking. The Big Guy agreed, but he really did not want to go. I could tell. But the beach was so beautiful. All the tree branches were shimmering with ice. I was reminded of that silver tinsel we’d hang from the Christmas tree for icicles. I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen trees so silvery. Almost every surface was wrapped in a skin of ice. The pancakes were still warm when we unwrapped them and buttery and syrupy and cooling quickly. What was most startling was the sound of the ice crackling and snapping over our heads — it was melting. Soon we had an arc of squawking gulls and pigeons around us. Skittish creatures. But their hungry distance was slowly closing in. Soon we packed up our plates and walked up the boardwalk a bit, then veered off onto the sand — crunchy snow covered sand. The Big Guy was laughing. “This beach looks like Mars.” We walked out of the snow into the ocean. Our boots ankle high in the water. We looked for horseshoe crabs. We didn’t see any. Actually I can’t think of a better start to the New Year.\n\nHappy New Year Dear Readers!\n\np.s. If you’d like the recipe for the pancakes (made entirely from scratch!) I’d be happy to email it to you. Just contact me through the comment field below.\n\nWe just got back from a vacation full of exercise fit for an athlete training for the Olympic Games. Well, that’s what it felt like to me anyway. First leg of our trip — a few days in Chicago to see family, topped off with a 22-mile bike ride along Lake Michigan. What did I learn? I am grossly out of shape. Never mind the headwind pushing us back south in the direction of Florida. Never mind I was tugging my five year old niece, who kept telling me to pedal faster because she couldn’t see the others up front. My 70 year old cyclist Dad had to sweep me into Navy Pier. Then we were off for hiking in New Hampshire’s White Mountains. Moose Country. I spotted more Obama 08 bumper stickers and nary a moose. It was beautiful with even more beautiful viewing from the summits. I trudged up the mountains with The Big Guy, who wasn’t even breaking a sweat, Our Favorite 14 yo and her school chum. The mountain air was clean and ripe with pine. We were on the trails everyday. And they were pristine. We slept well and ate well. No car alarms, no Mr. Softee jingle at 10:30 pm (I think everyone in town was tucked in by 8:30), no airplanes overhead making their descent into the airport. All our Bronx creature comforts far away.\n\nNow back home, ready to keep the momentum, we decided to get me a bicycle. We put on our riding gear and headed to local bike shop Westchester Bicycle Pro Shop on Westchester Avenue. We were going to get the bike and then ride out to Pelham Bay. The shop had a decent selection. We picked out a couple of models, adjusted the seats, had pedals put on. I rode three feet in the crowded store. But the owner wouldn’t let us take the bikes outside for a test run. What?? It’s a bicycle. I need to ride it. We offered to leave him our credit card. We promised to stay on the sidewalk in front of the store. We were ready to spend money. “It will get dirty. No. No. I can’t do it. Then everyone here (he made a sweeping gesture with his hand) will want to take a bike out”. He turned to busy himself with customers needing a child’s bike seat, a rim trued, i.e. small jobs.\n\nThe Big Guy called this the “Uno Maneuver”. Eating at our neighborhood Pizzeria Uno almost always led to a discussion with the manager regarding the lacking service. Nice staff but inefficient. We always left frustrated, but told ourselves that after all we were patronizing a local business. Then once we noticed a 15% gratuity added to our bill. We were only four. The manager explained that this was their new policy, a move to protect themselves from folks that didn’t leave a tip. The 15% gratuity would apply to all parties, no matter the size. We were turned off and have not been back.\n\nI can understand that a business, especially a small one, will have to find some way to deal with customers who consistently don’t tip, who try to return damaged merchandise or who find some other way to get over. But why implement a policy that shows distrust of all customers that walk through the doors? The bike shop owner could not see beyond his own rule to recognize that the two people standing in front of him were ready to buy a bicycle. He chose to ring up a child’s seat and rim repair job instead. And Uno’s with its “mandatory” 15% gratuity, is equally as distasteful.\n\nIt’s too bad because these businesses are in our neighborhood, they are local. I don’t, however, see them as my allies, as my neighborhood go to spots. We will keep walking by.\n\nMy bike search continues…"
