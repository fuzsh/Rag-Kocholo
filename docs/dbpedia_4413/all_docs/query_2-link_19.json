        "text": "The southernmost section of the park is separated from the bulk of the park by Eastchester Bay (PDF map). This section is most easily reached by public transportation, including the 6 line and many buses. There are some large athletic fields and a victory monument, but much of the site remains wooded and wild, including parts that have not been intensively managed since the mid-1980s. Shrubby areas of this section of the park host large numbers of wintering White-throated Sparrows, with White-crowned Sparrows appearing in migration. Good numbers of Northern Cardinal and Northern Mockingbird are year-round residents, and Gray Catbirds and Yellow Warblers are common summer breeders.\n\nThe southern zone is divided into several sections, the southernmost of which is the former Huntington Estates, now called Huntington Woods. Though much of the woodlands in that section are composed of non-native estate trees, and invasive shrubs, good numbers of fall migrant songbirds were recorded here in a NYC Bird Alliance sponsored banding study in the late 1980s. Closer to the water a wet shrubland and meadow host breeding Willow Flycatcher, Song Sparrow, and Red-winged Blackbird. The southern end of the stone wall bordering the waterfront in this section of the park makes a great blind for close up views of winter waterfowl, including Horned Grebes, Greater Scaup, and Ruddy Ducks. By approaching low and slow these birds can often be seen within 20 feet without disturbing them.\n\nTo the north of the Huntington Woods, one of the last coastal oak savannas on the north Atlantic Coast can be found. A handful of ancient White Oaks and Swamp White Oaks have survived, but this section of the park has an unusual number of these trees for a coastal site. Be sure to visit the nearby large black rock formation known as the Indian Prayer Rock, one of several unusual rocks in the park that were held sacred by the Siwanoy tribe who once dwelled here. \"}\" data-trix-content-type=\"undefined\" class=\"attachment attachment--content\">\n\nAmong the bird species that have regularly used this area in migration are American Woodcock, several species of flycatcher, cuckoo, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, and occasional stopover by grassland species such as Bobolink. Wood Thrush have recently been breeding in the young woods here. Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks are seen daily from December until April. Closer to the water the mix of meadows and open woods attracts and holds Merlins in migration. Red-tailed Hawks nest just north of this area.\n\nAn abandoned landfill adjacent to the southern zone (on the northeast side) has been reseeded to tall grasses. In cold months this is one of the best places in the region to see the state-listed Northern Harrier, a bird that has declined along with the grasslands it requires. Two to four birds are often present all winter. In migration a dozen can sometimes be seen visiting in a day. Other birds that require shorter grass have declined here in recent years, but proper management might bring back such species as Eastern Meadowlark and Snow Bunting.\n\nIn contrast to the nearby rocky shores of New England, most of the southern section of New York State was settled in large land grants, creating estates that survived until the creation of the park in 1888. Unlike the small farmers, the estate owners kept sections of their forests substantially wild, probably in imitation of European aristocrats. Who would have thought that this would result in the Bronx having more old growth forest than all of Connecticut? And on Hunter Island, Pelham Bay Park has what may be one of the most scenic stands of ancient coastal woodlands this side of the Atlantic. Most visitors are incredulous that this is part of the one of the most urban areas of the country; it looks more like the rocky shores of Maine.\n\nThe bird specialty of Hunter Island is the wintering owls. Please be quiet near roosting and nesting owls. Not all owls survive the winter, and added stress may be harmful. Stay as far away as possible using a field telescope or binoculars. (If an owl is staring at you, you are probably too close.) Make all visits short. Do not linger to get better photographs. Visit our Birding Law & Ethics page to learn more about how to avoid disturbing owls and other birds.\n\nIf one arrives at the northeast end of the Orchard Beach parking lot on a winter morning, chances are good that one or more local birders will be found. Ask for directions to the current owl roosts. An area that is used every winter is the planted pine grove on the top of Hunter Island. Take the paved road a bit in from Orchard Beach. This is no longer marked with any identifying signage. The beginning of the road passes through a grassy area. Where the woods begin there is a single metal bar gate to keep motor vehicles out. At this location someone usually puts out bird seed during the winter, making this a great place to see winter songbirds. In addition to the usual suspects like Northern Cardinals and White-throated Sparrows, this is a very reliable spot to see Fox and American Tree Sparrow.\n\nContinue on the paved road. At the top of the incline it widens and there is a small abandoned brick building. Take a left (west) there, and search the planted pines for Saw-whet, Long-eared, and Barred Owls. Numbers of these species often peak in late November and early December, with a secondary pulse in late February and early March. These species have been recorded somewhere in the northern part of the park every Christmas Bird Count for many years.\n\nSince at least the 1980s, a pair of Great Horned Owls has nested in the old growth woods at the north end of Hunter Island every year. One of the earliest nesting species, courting commences in earnest in December and usually there are eggs laid by January, chicks by February, and fledglings by April. Some years they are interrupted and re-nest, putting this calendar back a month or more. The owls are best seen very early in the morning. \"}\" data-trix-content-type=\"undefined\" class=\"attachment attachment--content\">\n\nOther birding sites on Hunter Island include the very scenic small island off the northeast end of Hunter, reachable only by an appropriately modest boardwalk across a saltmarsh. The view of the Sound and a small offshore island with an arrangement of fractured boulders left by a glacier (sometimes called the Stonehenge of The Bronx) is sublime, one of the nicest seascapes in the region. It is a great spot to just sit, watch waterbirds, and listen to the soft clang of the bell buoy. In recent years American Oystercatchers have been breeding on the small rocky islets near here.\n\nFrom this site, as well as the northeast coast of Twin Islands, one can see a distant \"reef\" of rocks to the south east where Harbor Seals haul out in winter. Up to 17 have been seen at once, but a good-quality spotting scope is required for a satisfying view. The seals are generally only present on the falling tide when the rocks are exposed. Occasionally a seal approaches the shore, an event that may be occurring more frequently. \"}\" data-trix-content-type=\"undefined\" class=\"attachment attachment--content\">\n\nThe Twin Islands (like Hunter Island, now connected by the Orchard Beach parking lot) give a feel of being far out to sea. Similar views of waterfowl can be had from the north end of Big or East Twin, the more seaward of the two. The tidal body of water in between Hunter and Little (West) Twin Island is good for wintering waterfowl, especially Red-breasted Mergansers, Brant, American Widgeons, Gadwalls, and other dabbling ducks. On the section of partially impounded tidal water in between Hunter and Twin Islands, great winter views of Buffleheads and Black-crowned Night-Herons can be had. At low tide in spring and late summer a few shorebirds visit, mostly yellowlegs and Killdeer.\n\nThe large paved area by Orchard Beach was built on garbage decades ago under the direction of Robert Moses. Somewhat ironically, the construction of the parking lot filled in almost all of the former Pelham Bay. Large puddles of water in the parking lot attract numbers of gulls, mostly Ring-billed Gulls but other species as well. Some unusual shorebird species have appeared here in recent years during migration, including Red-necked Phalarope, Whimbrel, and Baird’s, Western, and Pectoral Sandpipers. Peregrine Falcons can sometimes be seen drinking and bathing in the fresh water as well. These are probably resident Peregrines that nest on a local bridge—both Throgs Neck and Whitestone Bridges usually have breeding pairs.\n\nIn recent years, a small colony of Cliff Swallows, an unusual breeding species for New York City, has taken up residence here, building their mud nests by the Orchard Beach pavilion and lagoon. Look for this short-tailed, colorful swallow with pale forehead patch and rump from May through August. Barn, Tree, and Northern Rough-winged Swallows also regularly nest nearby, feeding over and often stopping for a drink or bath in the area's puddles and pools.\n\n\"}\" data-trix-content-type=\"undefined\" class=\"attachment attachment--content\">\n\nFrom the west side of the parking lot there is a good view of the lagoon. This body of water is the last remnant of Pelham Bay. It was modified and partly channeled in 1964, when it was the rowing race course for the summer Olympics. It is one of the best places in the region to view migrating Osprey from mid-August until October. Osprey have been nesting at the south end of the lagoon. The west end of the parking lot is also a good hawk watch site, especially when brisk northwest winds blow migrating raptors toward the coast. Bald Eagles have become more common in recent years."
