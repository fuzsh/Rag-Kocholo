        "text": "The Bronx is a hand reaching down to pull the other boroughs of New York City out of the harbor and the sea. Its fellow-boroughs are islands or parts of islands; the Bronx hangs on to Manhattan and Queens and Brooklyn, with Staten Island trailing at the end of the long towrope of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, and keeps the whole business from drifting away on a strong outgoing tide. No water comes between the Bronx (if you leave out its own few islands) and the rest of North America. The Bronx is the continent, and once you’re on it you can go for thousands of miles without seeing ocean again. The other boroughs, for their part, cling to the Bronx for dear life. The chafing and strife of this connection have made all the difference to the Bronx.\n\nNo other borough has “the” in its name. We don’t say “the Staten Island” or “the Manhattan”; for some reason, no island is ever called “the.” Only certain more or less continuous geographic features merit a “the,” such as “the Antarctic” or “the tropical rain forest.” Before Europeans had any formal name for what is now the Bronx, they referred to it simply as “the continent,” “the mainland,” or “the maine,” distinguishing it from the ocean they came on and the nearby islands where they’d settled first. The northernmost part of the Bronx’s western border is the Hudson River. Then Manhattan fits up next to the Bronx on its western side for more than half its length, lying approximately north and south. Here, the Harlem River, which is a strait and not a river, and which connects the East River to the Hudson, runs between the two boroughs. Steep hills and bluffs rise above the Harlem River Valley. Much of the Bronx is hilly. Stone ridges extend like tendons, knuckles, and fingers from its northern edge southward; these discouraged the construction of east-west roads and make the Bronx difficult to cross from east to west even today. After the Harlem River branches off around one side of Randall’s Island, a smaller tidal stream, the Bronx Kill, continues along the borough’s southern border. Going along the top of Randall’s, the Bronx Kill flows into the East River, which is part of Long Island Sound, which is part of the Atlantic Ocean. The Bronx’s entire eastern border is the East River and the Sound. Thus, the borough has a major river that comes from inland—the Hudson—to its west, and salt water on its east. Some of the Bronx is rocky and wooded like upstate, and some is oceanfront marsh and beach.\n\nA straight line with a few bureaucratic zigzags marks the Bronx’s northern border. That line is also the border of New York City. In general, people in the suburbs to the north of this line are richer than people in the Bronx. By some measurements, large areas of the Bronx are poorer than anywhere else in the nation. But that assumes a population frozen in time. Everybody has to start somewhere, and the poor parts of the Bronx are often where people start when they have very little. They work, and earn, and then perhaps they move upward, and new arrivals take their place. This cycle has tended to wear out some areas of the Bronx.\n\nThe Bronx is the part of New York where the city merges into the rest of North America. The process has never gone smoothly. Its name honks, “Bronx!” Ideally, we could ask for a better-sounding name, one that did not suggest a Bronx cheer, but Bronx! is what we’ve got. The name comes from the Bronx River, which begins at a reservoir north of the city and runs south through the middle of the borough until it empties into the East River. The Bronx River cuts the Bronx into two sections—east of it and west of it. Surface streets sometimes dead-end at it. If you’re at ground level and not on one of the big highways, you can go a mile or more without finding a bridge. From source to mouth, the river is twenty-three miles long, with about eight of those miles in the borough. It is the longest river within the borders of New York City, and it used to be beautiful and idyllic, until the usual city factors ruined it. By the nineteen-eighties, it was so full of junk—old refrigerators, washing machines, cars—that you could barely see it. An intrepid environmental group and the Parks Department cleaned it up. It now runs clear, and parts of it are even almost idyllic again. People sometimes canoe on it, but you’re advised not to swim in it.\n\nAn eminent old-time historian wrote that the Indians called the river Aquahung. I find that hard to believe, but I can’t explain why. Tribes with villages in what’s now the Bronx were the Siwanoy, the Munsee, and the Weckquaesgeek, all subgroups of the Lenape. They belonged to the Eastern Algonquian language family, a linguistic grouping that did not include the powerful Iroquois, their inland enemies. In December, 1639, several local Munsee headmen sold five hundred acres of land adjoining the river to Jonas Bronck, a Swede who had arrived on his own ship, the Fire of Troy. (One day, fire and destruction would be what people thought of when they thought of the Bronx.) Jonas Bronck also paid the Dutch West India Company for the land. The Dutch were the European power in the region and had founded New Amsterdam, their outpost on lower Manhattan Island, fifteen years before.\n\nBronck built a house on what’s now 132nd Street, or maybe 138th Street—in either case, it was in what’s now a southerly part of the South Bronx—and leased his land out for farming maize and tobacco. Eventually, the river at the eastern edge of his holdings became known as Bronk’s River, and Bronk’s Land was the area in general. A man named Pieter Schorstinveger (chimney sweep, in Dutch) owned a large farm next to Bronck’s, which he cultivated using enslaved Black people. Apparently, Schorstinveger’s River was never even in the running as a name, such being the workings of everyday poetics and spoken language.\n\nIn 1939, three hundred years after Jonas Bronck, three reporters for this magazine set out to discover if he had any living descendants in the area. In the article they wrote, they noted that “there are no Bronks in the Bronx.” The reporters did find one descendant, William R. Bronk (by then, the family had dropped the “c”), who lived in Pelham, just north of the Bronx. He said he commuted on the New Haven Railroad every day past the site of his ancestor’s house and never gave it a thought. Another Bronk, a retired lawyer named Leonard Bronk Lampman, who had been living at the Yale Club for twenty-two years, cleared up a question about the Bronx borough flag. It depicts a rising sun with a bowling-pin-shaped bird standing above it. Lampman said that the bird is an auk, a species found in the Faroe Islands, where Jonas Bronck lived before going to Holland and then to America. The bird and the rising sun are on the Bronck family coat of arms, along with the motto “Ne Cede Malis” (“Do Not Yield to Misfortunes”), which became the motto of the Bronx. Designers included the Bronck coat of arms—motto, bird, and all—in the borough flag when they created it, in the early twentieth century.\n\nJonas Bronck and his wife, Antonia Slagboom, had a son named Pieter. He moved to Coxsackie, New York, near Albany, and built a stone farmhouse that still stands. I meant to visit it in 2021—it’s now a museum—but it was closed because of the virus. Pieter Bronck had offspring, and there still are Bronks in the Coxsackie area. A poet named William Bronk (1918–99), who claimed descent from Jonas, ran his family’s coal-and-lumber business in Hudson Falls, a town about eighty miles north of Coxsackie. He stayed close to home and did not drive. In his lifetime, Bronk published about two dozen books of poetry, one of which won a National Book Award.\n\nThirteen bridges connect Manhattan to the Bronx, and two more cross the East River from Queens. Other links exist underground in tunnels and pipes, which carry subway lines, drinking water, gas mains, power cables, and wastewater. Every which way, the Bronx is sewn and bound and grappled and clamped to the rest of the city. Every kind of transportation passes through it or over it. Walking on Bruckner Boulevard one morning, I was stunned by the loudness of the trucks. (No other borough has truck traffic like the Bronx’s, partly because its Hunts Point market, for produce, meat, and fish, is the largest food-distribution depot in the world.) I also heard cars, vans, motorcycles, an Amtrak train, airplanes, and, on the lower Bronx River nearby, the horn of a tugboat pushing a barge. Even during the emptiest days of the Covid shutdown, the Bronx’s pulse of transport kept pounding.\n\nInterstate highways slice and dice the borough. The interstates within the Bronx’s borders are these: On the west, running approximately north and south, is I-87, also known (in the city) as the Major Deegan Expressway, or simply the Deegan. I-87 is bound for Albany and Canada. The Bruckner Expressway, a.k.a. I-278, connects to I-87 in the southern part of the borough. From there, I-278 veers to the northeast. Across the borough’s middle, I-95, a.k.a. the Cross Bronx Expressway, that road of infamous history, moves traffic east and west before merging with the Bruckner. Then it veers north, and follows the coast up to New England. A spur, I-295, splits off and goes south across the Throgs Neck Bridge to Queens. Another spur, I-678, also goes to Queens, over the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. At the point where I-678 goes south from I-95, the Hutchinson River Parkway goes north from I-95, crosses the Bronx, and continues into Westchester County.\n\nI am leaving out several other parkways, such as the Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway, and the Pelham Bay Parkway. These roads refer to an earlier, more optimistic era of travel, and they sometimes have green spaces along them. Otherwise, the parkways now resemble the interstates in most respects, and aid and abet them. All the major highway corridors and their street approaches are generally filled with traffic. The speed limit on the Cross Bronx Expressway is fifty miles an hour, but the average speed on it during the evening rush hour is fourteen. For a while in the mid-twentieth century, planners thought that building new highways would relieve the already bad congestion, but the new highways became just as busy. Night and day, the wheels roll. Potholes are abundant. Among the most common signs in the borough are ones whose red letters announce, on a yellow background, “FLAT FIX.”\n\nBefore the highways, transportation was more Bronx-friendly. In the early nineteen-hundreds, the subways came, building north from Manhattan. In 1905, the tracks for what are now the No. 2 and No. 5 trains reached a terminus at the neighborhood called West Farms, on the Bronx River. By 1910, the Broadway Local, also known as the No. 1 train, which goes up the West Side, got to Van Cortlandt Park, in the northwest Bronx. By the end of 1920, tracks for today’s No. 4 and No. 6 trains had also been completed in the Bronx (ending in its near-middle and northeasterly parts, respectively).\n\nAll these trains were mostly elevated in the Bronx, and still are. The lines spread out in a generally north-south configuration, causing land booms and frenzied construction along their routes. In the nineteen-twenties, the population of the Bronx increased by seventy-two per cent. Another subway line, this one entirely underground, carrying the B and D trains, came in the thirties. In 1900, the borough had 200,507 residents. By 1940, almost 1.4 million people lived in the Bronx. Then, in the forties, the city and the state started pushing through the big limited-access highways that would become interstates or link up to them.\n\nA history of the Bronx in the twentieth century can be sketched in a sentence: The subways created the modern Bronx and the highways almost destroyed it.\n\nI started wandering the Bronx about fifteen years ago. Usually, I had a destination, a place I wanted to check out. When you cover any distance in this borough, its ridged, up-and-down geography registers in your calves and lets you know you’re on a hike. I walked thoroughfares that traversed the borough north to south, such as Boston Road, which at one time was the post road to Boston. One day, I followed it all the way to the borough’s northern border, where the road leaves the Bronx. I also walked Tremont Avenue, which goes from the Harlem River to the East River, and I contemplated how Tremont Avenue’s survival has been the survival of the Bronx. I took inventory of the parklands, of which the Bronx has four thousand acres, and went along off-map paths below interstate-highway overpasses and plunged through thickets of phragmites next to rocky beaches.\n\nOn the heights above the Hudson River, in Riverdale, I found the white stucco Moorish-Dutch-style mansion, empty and in disrepair, that John F. Kennedy moved into with his family in 1927, when he was ten. I peered through the windows at its huge downstairs rooms and bare parquet floors; John’s mother once was obliged to host the children of his father’s mistress, Gloria Swanson, at a Halloween party with the Kennedy siblings here. Now planes flew overhead, perhaps on their way to John F. Kennedy International Airport, in Queens, but the house where the President-to-be spent a part of his boyhood had no plaque or marker. In that way, it resembled most other places of historical significance in the borough. From the former Kennedy mansion, one can walk 4.7 miles to 825 East 179th Street, in the East Tremont neighborhood, where a thirteen-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald lived with his mother in 1953. The building that Oswald lived in no longer exists, and there is no historic marker.\n\nAs I walked in the Bronx, I watched the sky—the way it opens out at the ends of streets approaching the water, the way it goes upward to Heaven at the tops of “stair streets,” which is the name for sections of streets so steep that they morph into stairways. A stair street with a hundred and thirty-two steps, which I was accustomed to climbing at the continuation of 167th Street at Shakespeare Avenue, one day had drawn a crowd of French and Asian tourists, who stood all up and down it, recording themselves with cell phones. I inquired and found out that it’s the stairway on which the Joker dances in a Batman-related movie. The sky that the stairway frames is towering and cinematic in the extreme. At the same time as I watched the sky, I kept an eye on the ground.\n\nAll kinds of things are on the ground in the Bronx: Q-tips. A pigeon foot. Those Christmas-tree-shaped air fresheners that hang from rearview mirrors. Syringes with pale-orange plastic stoppers on their needles. Sunglass lenses. The butts of menthol cigarettes. A bathroom sink. A single pink, almond-shaped artificial fingernail. The white plastic tips of cigarillos. Little bags that once held fortune cookies, with pagodas faintly printed on them in red. Inside-out surgical gloves. Pennies. Scratched-off scratch-off tickets. Green puddles of antifreeze. Hair picks with handles shaped like fists. Pieces of broken mirrors. Flattened pieces of sugarcane. Corona beer-bottle caps. Coconut husks. Crumpled paper handouts offering cash for diabetes test strips, with a number to call. Crushed traffic cones. Dashboard dice. Skeins of hair for extensions. Spiced-whiskey bottles with devil silhouettes on the labels. Covid masks. Black plastic takeout bags that skitter, ankle-high, on the wind. Pavement graffiti: “Lost Virginity at this Spot 11-1-16.”\n\nI set out to walk a thousand miles in the Bronx. I was looking for hints about what has happened here, and about how we got to the present. If almost everyone who lives and almost everything that happens will be forgotten, that must be even more true in a zone of connection like the Bronx, where so much energy is zapping back and forth constantly. An emptier place might be kinder to the past but have less of it.\n\nOne September morning at ten-forty-five, I set out from Manhattan for a walk of about ten miles. When I was halfway across the Third Avenue Bridge, heading into the Bronx, a horn of unknown origin blasted twice. Then double barricades with blinking red lights went down at either end of the bridge. I hurried to get to the Bronx side. A guy in a hard hat and a bright-green vest with bright-orange stripes showed me how I could scoot around the edges of the barricades. He said that workers were testing the bridge. Then the bridge’s whole middle span began to move, rotating slowly and smoothly on its central pivot, until it was perpendicular to the roadway. Watching it do that was like seeing the Empire State Building telescope down to the size of a Pizza Hut—a technical surprise, but just another event of the day. Most of the bridges over the Harlem River open by rotating. They’re what are called swing bridges, as opposed to lift bridges, which go up and down. For ten or fifteen minutes, traffic sat waiting. Then the bridge pivoted back, the barricades lifted, and the traffic moved.\n\nApartment buildings under construction next to the bridge were raising a racket of metal hammering on metal. I walked along Third Avenue to East 138th Street and turned left. A woman with a blond Afro, who wore a yellow-black-and-purple dress, was getting her car washed at 138 Hand Wash & Lube. Nearby, a sign said “taxi-drivers wanted full or part time—day or night” with a number to call. In a few blocks, I came to the Grand Concourse, the Champs-Élysées of the Bronx, and turned right. The Grand Concourse runs for about five miles, north and south on a ridge through approximately the middle of the Bronx. The farther-back history in the Bronx mostly happened on the edges, and the recent history mostly happened in the middle. Today, I was going to the middle. The rattle of ratchet guns came from a car-repair shop. Another apartment building going up rang with the noise of hammering. Lots of new housing is being built in the Bronx. Whether it’s affordable for people who live here will be another question. On the Concourse near East 149th Street, the modern buildings of Hostos Community College (officially, Eugenio María de Hostos Community College of the City University of New York) rose on both sides, with an enclosed walkway above the Concourse connecting the two. This institution was started in a former tire factory on this site by community groups back in the late sixties. Celina Sotomayor, the mother of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, went to night school here after the death of her husband, and graduated with an advanced nursing degree in 1973.\n\nAt East 149th Street, the old central post office, with its heroic social-realist murals painted by Ben Shahn and Bernarda Bryson, had been boarded shut. Across the street, broken windows at a 7-Eleven convenience store that was looted during the George Floyd protests had been repaired. At 150th and Grand Concourse, ginkgo fruit on a bench showed evidence of having been gnawed by rodents. I passed the Bronx County Courthouse, which contains the mural of the Battle of Pelham, and East 161st Street, which Babe Ruth used to walk down on his way to Yankee Stadium when he stayed at the old Concourse Plaza Hotel, diagonally across from the courthouse. This was in the middle of the pandemic, and the Stadium, empty of fans except maybe cardboard ones, flew the flag of every major-league team from its topmost tier; the crayon-box colors fluttered against the sky. The Lorelei Fountain, also at East 161st Street, is in the Bronx because the German city of Düsseldorf did not want it. Heinrich Heine, whose poem the statue commemorates, was a satirist and a Jew. A committee of New York Germans brought the statue here, where at first it was defaced, and required a guard twenty-four hours a day. Now the fountain flows peacefully, unguarded and ignored.\n\nIn another few blocks, on my right, I passed the small but excellent Bronx Museum of the Arts, where I’ve seen shows of graffiti art of the seventies and Gordon Matta-Clark’s chainsaw-cutout sections from floors and ceilings of abandoned Bronx apartment buildings—that crazy turquoise-blue kitchen linoleum! Then, on the left, the Andrew Freedman Home takes up a block behind its iron gates and seldom mowed grounds. It was built originally as a home for indigent millionaires, offering them amenities that they had been accustomed to before they lost their fortunes. Freedman, the founder of the home and provider of its funds, promised that it would welcome people of all races, religions, and ethnicities, as long as they had at one time been wealthy. Now the building belongs to a community-based nonprofit. For a while, on the second floor there was a display about redlining, with detailed nineteen-thirties real-estate maps that showed redlined neighborhoods, mostly in the South Bronx. In many places, the neighborhoods coincided with the holdings of the old Morrisania manor, home of Gouverneur Morris, a New Yorker of enormous consequence who is mostly lost to memory today.\n\nAs much as any of America’s so-called Founding Fathers, Gouverneur Morris remade his country and sent ripple effects out into the world. He was born in 1752 in the family’s manor house, which stood at the end of a lane leading inland from its dock, at the mouth of the Bronx Kill. The house had been in the family already for three generations. Morris was a close friend of George Washington and wrote the Preamble to the Constitution. It would not begin “We the People of the United States” or say “in order to form a more perfect union” (those phrases echoing forever) if not for him. Morris served as Ambassador to France during its Revolution, proposed the idea for the Erie Canal, and worked for the canal’s creation. Of a rational and orderly mind, he led the committee that created the street grid for New York City. He suggested a decimal-based system of coinage when the new country was developing its monetary system, and he invented the word “cent,” for penny. Dozens of things all over the Bronx are named for Gouverneur Morris or his family. There’s Morris Heights, Morris Avenue, Gouverneur Place, Gouverneur Playground, Gouverneur Morris Square, and Gouverneur Morris Triangle. The Bronx’s Gouverneur Morris Houses are among the biggest New York City Housing Authority projects in the borough. Morris High School (now Morris Academy for Collaborative Studies), which commemorates him, was the Bronx’s first major public secondary school. His name is everywhere, and yet almost nobody knows who he was.\n\nOne explanation for this might be simple: Gouverneur Morris lived in what would someday be the Bronx. And not just any place in the future Bronx but on the southeastern edge of it, just above water level, in a precise spot where railroads, once they’d been invented, would want to go. In 1905, after the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad had acquired the property, his manor house was torn down. It was long gone before the arrival of the highways, and the Triborough Bridge (now the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), whose cement support pillars and ramps have shouldered themselves into that same location. If his house—a substantial and well-appointed château in the French style—had survived, perhaps as a museum, we would have a focal point for remembering him. But, like much of the Bronx, it was erased by the city’s tightly grasping infrastructure fingers.\n\nAt East 174th Street and Grand Concourse, about a mile past the Freedman Home, all at once the sky gaped open to the east and west above the route of the Cross Bronx Expressway. Years ago, I lived in a neighborhood in Brooklyn where a plane had crashed three decades before. The crash left an absence at an intersection of brownstone residential streets; this sky reminded me of that, in its evocation of the vanished buildings that had to make room for the highway. The Cross Bronx Expressway runs through a roadcut under the Grand Concourse rather than on a bridge over it, for complicated engineering reasons.\n\nThe necessity of digging the roadcut so far down created one of the anomalies of the city’s subway system. The B and D trains are the only subways in the Bronx that remain underground for their entire routes—that are actual, full-time subways in the Bronx, in other words. The 174th-175th Streets station for the B and the D is under the Grand Concourse. The station, to all appearances ordinary when you walk down the stairs into it from the Concourse, sits inside a span of rock that is fifteen or twenty feet above the Cross Bronx Expressway, which runs through the roadcut below.\n\nAt Tremont Avenue, another major thoroughfare, I turned right. Back when the Bronx was about fifty per cent Jewish, in the nineteen-thirties, Tremont Avenue and the Concourse were like the Jewish Main Streets. A long-disused synagogue near that intersection, boarded up and fenced off, maybe survives in the memory of some people who now live in Boca Raton. I went downhill on Tremont, pausing to look at the hunting bows and arrows in the window of Frank’s Sport Shop, which has a sign over the door advertising “Guns—Ammunition.” It’s the only such advertisement I know of in the city. Beyond Frank’s, Tremont Avenue goes over the Metro-North tracks, with their silver commuter trains whizzing from affluence to affluence. A man in forest-green African robes walked by me and said a loud and cheerful “Hello!” I said hello back, but he was talking into a headset.\n\nOn Washington Avenue, I took another right, now heading south, through a region of warehouses, dozens of idling emergency-medical-services trucks at E.M.S. Station 18, and auto junk yards, whose names probably weren’t Beware of Dog, despite the signage. I again crossed the Cross Bronx Expressway, which is an elevated road here; Washington Avenue, which I was on, goes under it. South of East 171st Street, I was among the Gouverneur Morris Houses.\n\nAt Third Avenue, a block later, I turned north, and stayed on Third up to Claremont Parkway, where I took a right, and followed that road through Crotona Park to Boston Road. Now I was near what used to be one of the most burned-out parts of the Bronx. A short walk north brought me to the corner of Boston Road and Charlotte Street.\n\nIn recent Bronx history, this intersection has been in the news more than any other single place in the borough. Where there once was a rubble of demolished apartment buildings, one- and two-story ranch-style houses now line Charlotte Street on both sides. The house on the southwest corner of the intersection is melon orange, with darker-orange shutters, and has a healthy lawn enlivened by rosebushes and cheery warning signs (a picture of a fierce-looking German shepherd, above the words “I can make it to the gate in three seconds. Can you?”). In the yard, there’s a small fountain with a sculpture of a girl, a big American flag, and a smaller flag of Belize. If the owner of the house is out in the yard, I talk with him. His name is Willie Hemmans, and he was born in Belize. Once, pointing to the sign, I asked him where the German shepherd was who could get to the gate in three seconds. “There is no dog,” Hemmans said. He tapped his chest: “The dog is me.”\n\nSo, what happened here? The Bronx, or what is now the Bronx, has gone through two terrible times since the arrival of Jonas Bronck, in 1639. The more recent terrible time began in the nineteen-sixties, continued through the seventies and eighties, and improved, with setbacks, in the nineties. The nadir of this period came in 1977. That’s the year people remember. During the New York City blackout of July 13-14, 1977, looting and fires hit the Bronx. Many hundreds of fires burned just on that one night, in this borough which had been beset by fires for the past nine years. On October 12, 1977, while the Yankees were playing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the second game of the World Series, at Yankee Stadium, an overhead shot from a helicopter showed a building on fire nearby, in the borough’s Melrose neighborhood. Howard Cosell, the dominant sports voice of that era, who was one of the announcers, supposedly said, “Ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning!” Somehow, the sentence entered the language, though Cosell never said that, or exactly that. In any case, it’s what people remember. Cosell, and the rest of the country, had the Bronx’s troubles in mind because of something that had happened a week before.\n\nOn October 5, 1977, President Jimmy Carter, in New York City to address a meeting at the United Nations, got in his limousine and made a visit to the Bronx. No announcement preceded Carter’s trip to the borough, which seemed to be almost a spur-of-the-moment decision. With Mayor Abraham Beame, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Patricia Roberts Harris, a few aides, and an N.Y.P.D. and Secret Service detail, the Carter motorcade drove up Third Avenue, west on East 138th Street, north on the Grand Concourse, right on East Tremont Avenue, right on Washington Avenue, left on East 168th Street, left on Third Avenue, right on Claremont Parkway, and left on Boston Road—the same route I took on that September day, as I had walked it before and have walked it at least half a dozen times since.\n\nThe route in itself could be considered a historic site. It was chosen with care to expose President Carter to some of the borough’s most destroyed neighborhoods, but today it amounts to an encouragement, because the destruction he saw is gone. To the President and his staff, the burned-out scenes they passed on October 5, 1977, were stunning.\n\nAt the intersection of Boston Road and Charlotte Street, where Willie Hemmans’s house is now, the limo pulled over and the President got out. Wearing a business suit and tie, he walked a block or two on Charlotte Street. Almost as far as the eye could see were rubble and trash piles, with here and there a few buildings still standing. He stood looking around, his expression blank and dazed. Photographers in a small group of press who had heard about the event took pictures that came out as minimalist cityscapes with a stark, post-apocalyptic feel. For the President to allow himself to be seen when he appeared so overwhelmed required self-sacrifice and moral fortitude.\n\nFrom Charlotte Street, the motorcade went down Boston Road the way it had come, continued for a couple of miles, turned left on East 163rd Street, passed the building where Joseph Saddler, a.k.a. Grandmaster Flash, one of the founding geniuses of hip-hop, lived with his family, and the building where Sonia Sotomayor had lived as a baby. At Southern Boulevard, the motorcade turned right, kept going to East 149th Street, turned right, went by St. Mary’s Park, and turned left on Brook Avenue (the site of the old Mill Brook, which once divided the estate of Morrisania into the part owned by Gouverneur Morris and the part owned by Lewis Morris, his half brother).\n\nFrom Brook Avenue, the President and his entourage turned right onto East 137th Street, then left onto Willis Avenue, which led them to the Willis Avenue Bridge over the Harlem River, and so back to Manhattan. On my walk, I always follow this exact route.\n\nCarter’s visit produced no immediate visible rebuilding or remedy for the desolation he saw. His offer of federal funding to rebuild housing for the Charlotte Street area went nowhere. But his unexpected Bronx drive-by got a lot of press, causing people all over the city and the country to notice this place which most of them had been looking away from. In subsequent years, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson, and other dignitaries would visit the intersection of Charlotte Street and Boston Road. Major lenders took notice, the city eventually decided to get more involved, local community groups found they had new allies, and the rebuilding of the Bronx picked up momentum. I’ve wondered whether Carter’s later volunteer work building houses for Habitat for Humanity might also have been influenced by the shock of that Bronx visit.\n\nI said there were two terrible times in Bronx history. The other terrible time began in 1776, during the American Revolution, after the British had driven George Washington’s army out of Long Island, Manhattan, and the southern part of Westchester County, which, at the time, included the present-day Bronx. Washington and his men, retreating across the Hudson, moved south through New Jersey, and eventually crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. With civil authority mostly gone in Westchester County, and partisans active on both sides, violence and chaos took over. During the Revolutionary War, no other place in the thirteen states saw so much strife. Both terrible times—1776 to 1783, and about 1965 to about 1995—originated in geography. The British held on to Manhattan and the other islands, but they never had much luck here on the continent. To defend their position, they needed to hold the King’s Bridge, the most important bridge in the area, which crossed from Manhattan into today’s Bronx over a now vanished stream called Spuyten Duyvil. But the farther north the British went from the King’s Bridge the shakier their hold was. As the war continued, the American army kept a force in the area, and its front lines were sometimes along the Croton River, about thirty miles north of the King’s Bridge. The land in between, including most of what is now the Bronx, was called the Neutral Ground.\n\nIn the Neutral Ground, Continental Army forces sometimes fought British Army regulars. Here Yankee raiders, called Skinners because they plundered people down to their skins, clashed with bands of Tories, called Cow Boys because they stole cattle to sell to their British allies or to keep for themselves. People unlucky enough to live in the Neutral Ground were robbed and terrorized by both sides. In-between-ness has always been a problem here. In the twentieth century, planners pushed highways through Bronx neighborhoods and destroyed them, and the place’s accessibility made it especially vulnerable to the influx of drugs, disease, and guns. Living in the Bronx has sometimes meant surviving in between.\n\nPresident Carter looked with incomprehension and sorrow at the scene around Boston Road during his 1977 visit. Almost exactly two hundred years earlier, in the fall of 1777, the Reverend Timothy Dwight, a chaplain in the Continental Army, observed a landscape of misery along the same road. Carter saw miles of rubble and heaps of trash. Reverend Dwight reported that the houses along the Boston Road were\n\nscenes of desolation. Their furniture was extensively plundered, or broken to pieces. The walls, floors, and windows were injured, both by violence and decay. . . . Their cattle were gone. Their enclosures were burnt, where they were capable of becoming fuel, and in many cases thrown down, where they were not. Their fields were covered with a rank growth of weeds, and wild grass. Amid all this appearance of desolation, nothing struck my own eye more forcibly than the sight of this great road; the passage from New-York to Boston. Where I had heretofore seen a continual succession of horses and carriages; and life and bustle lent a sprightfulness to all the environing objects; not a single, solitary traveler was visible from week to week, or from month to month. The world was motionless and silent; except when one of these unhappy people [the residents] ventured upon a rare, and lonely, excursion to the house of a neighbour, no less unhappy; or a scouting party, traversing the country in quest of enemies, alarmed the inhabitants with expectations of new injuries and sufferings.\n\nReverend Dwight, an optimistic and outgoing churchman, who would later be president of Yale, tried to draw the locals into conversation:\n\nThey feared everybody whom they saw; and loved nobody. It was a curious fact to a philosopher, and a melancholy one to a moralist, to hear their conversation. To every question they gave such an answer, as would please the enquirer; or, if they despaired of pleasing, such an one, as would not provoke him. Fear was, apparently, the only passion, by which they were animated. The power of volition seemed to have deserted them. They were not civil, but obsequious; not obliging, but subservient . . . Both their countenances, and their motions, had lost every trace of animation and of feeling. Their features were smoothed, not into serenity, but apathy; and instead of being settled in the attitude of quiet thinking, strongly indicated, that all thought, beyond what was merely instinctive, had fled their minds forever.\n\nWar and its horrors careened through Morrisania, in the future South Bronx. Raiders from “above”—the northern part of the county, where the American forces were—descended on the encampments along the Mill Brook, near where St. Mary’s Park is today, and burned scores of huts occupied by the Refugees, as the Tory partisans and plunderers who had sought protection from the British were called. With fire and broadsword came pestilence, in the form of a sickness called Morrisania fever, which carried off many Refugees.\n\nSome residents of the Neutral Ground abandoned their homes, and some who stayed did not continue to farm. Hay and weeds grew untended in the fields. In the orchards, apples lay rotting by the bushel on the ground. British forces cut down multi-acre stands of trees and tore up farm buildings for lumber to build their barracks. A Westchester County committee assessing damages after the war found that three hundred and fifty thousand fence rails had gone for firewood. The combatants also dismantled the stone walls in the fields, and, when enemies were near, sometimes hid in them.\n\nWestchester County during the Revolutionary War prefigured the Wild West before that concept had entered a dime novelist’s mind. The Neutral Ground had cowboys (or Cow Boys), Indians, cavalry attacks and rescues, and secret woodland fastnesses known only to the canniest frontiersman. James Fenimore Cooper, the novelist who invented the Western and introduced it to the world, and who lived for a time in nearby Mamaroneck, set his first best-seller here. He wrote it in 1821 and titled it “The Spy: A Tale of the Neutral Ground.” It’s about an itinerant peddler named Harvey Birch, who passes back and forth between the lines spying for the British—or so his neighbors believe. Heroically, he accepts the hatred and contempt of fellow-Americans in order to fool the enemy, because in actuality (spoiler) Harvey Birch is not a British spy but the personal spy of George Washington! “The Spy” uses stories from the Neutral Ground and turns them into romantic fiction that—to me, anyway—is not as interesting as what really happened here.\n\nWhat started the Bronx’s fires in the nineteen-sixties and seventies? The general state of combustibility of the place started them. That is, they started in heavily stressed neighborhoods of buildings almost half a century old, south of the Cross Bronx Expressway. Gouverneur Morris would have known the places where the fires first burned—he would have recognized the basic landscape if nothing else. Much of the burning occurred on land that had belonged to him.\n\nThe name South Bronx has been applied to different areas at different times. At one point, it meant the far south of the borough, the edge of “the continent,” which included only the neighborhoods of Mott Haven, Port Morris, and Hunts Point. When deterioration spread northward, the name spread with it. There had not been a need to think of the Bronx in terms of south or north since the Neutral Ground—until the construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway cut the borough in two, isolating the part south of it, the South Bronx. In the mid-nineteen-sixties, fires started burning in buildings there. A couple of years later, thousands of fires were burning, and not only in buildings. Piles of uncollected garbage went up in boils of black smoke; abandoned cars sat along the curbs, collecting parking tickets under their windshield wipers, until one day, mysteriously, the cars went up in flames that melted the asphalt below. The fire plague kept moving north, and eventually crossed the highway like a forest fire jumping a firebreak. By the mid-seventies, the threatened areas were approaching Fordham Road, a mile and a half north of the highway. People wondered if the plague would spread to buildings throughout the borough. Unmoored from geography, the name South Bronx came to mean fire.\n\nThe numbers were hard to grasp. The Bronx’s apartment buildings, during the boom of the early twentieth century, had been constructed in rows, one next to another. Now when a building burned the one beside it often followed—and so down the entire row. In the late sixties, about a thousand fires were burning each month. This was in some ways the hardest time, because many of the buildings still held tenants. Later, when the fires got worse, fewer of the buildings were occupied. In 1972, Dennis Smith, a fireman in a station on Intervale Avenue, published a book, “Report from Engine Co. 82,” which said that the company responded to 9,111 alarms in 1970. He called it “the busiest firehouse in the city—and probably the world.” Having 9,111 alarms in a year is more than one per hour every day. Keeping track over a three-and-a-half-month period, Smith found that he never ate an uninterrupted meal.\n\nIn 1974, thirty-three thousand fires burned in the Bronx. That year, a hundred and forty residents died in fires, and fifteen hundred were injured. Three firemen also died. Sirens were going all the time, at all hours. Mothers kept bags of clothing and essentials by the door, to be grabbed at the last minute, and lined up everybody’s shoes at night. In fire-plagued neighborhoods, the smoke smell didn’t go away. A survivor of that time described it as a dull smell. Another said it smelled like tar, because of the burning roofs. Fires might burn in only one or two apartments in a building, leaving the other units still inhabited. The burned-out apartments could be identified from the street by the black streaks of smoke spread above the windows like too much eyeshadow. Remaining tenants lost utilities and hauled water buckets up with ropes and pulleys.\n\nGoing to work in the mornings, people might come upon friends sitting on what few belongings they’d been able to salvage, piled on the curb in puddles in front of their burned-out building. Families left their apartments to attend church or visit relatives in Harlem and came back to find their building burned and their belongings destroyed. Chrystal Wade, a Bronx activist and educator, told a Fordham oral-history researcher that she never forgot the TV console her family lost, with the stereo that she had loved and played constantly. Water from the fire hoses ruined all the new furniture that her mother had recently bought.\n\nA man who was a social worker in the South Bronx remembered some siblings he tutored who started doing poorly in school, having done well before. He learned that the family had just been burned out for the third time. Some parents sent kids to live with relatives to wait out the plague. Kids fell asleep to sirens at night and walked wide-eyed through fire-dazed daytimes. Teachers noticed that the kids in their classes sometimes smelled like burned buildings. Watching fires from a roof provided scary entertainment; you could even look out your bedroom window and see houses nearby go up in flames. Running through the streets, kids got a thrill from pulling fire alarms and then hiding around the corner to see the clamorous engines arrive. Dennis Smith said that his unit received two thousand false alarms in 1971—between five and six a day. When the firehouse gave a party at the intersection of East 172nd Street and Southern Boulevard, in an attempt to improve community relations, somebody pulled the fire alarm at the intersection while the party was going on.\n\nSurvivors of that time still dream about the fires. Not knowing if or when your building will catch fire puts you on constant alert. Buildings with watchful supers or owners tended to survive. Elias Karmon, the proprietor of Hollywood Clothes, on Prospect Avenue, owned buildings in the neighborhood. He involved himself in the community, cashed local people’s paychecks, organized street cleanups, paid regular visits to his properties, and knew his tenants. His buildings didn’t burn. This was the result, he later said, of “no magic, only hard work and perseverance.” Miguel (Mike) Amadeo, the owner of Casa Amadeo, Antigua Casa Hernandez, the long-lived Latin music store by the Prospect Avenue El station, remained in the building after every other tenant had left. The water had been cut off, so he got water from the hydrant out front. Con Ed stopped by regularly to make sure he still had electricity and cut the cables of neighbors who were tapping into his connection. When the lady who lived upstairs moved out, never to return, she gave him the key. He went through her apartment and saw that it still had a couch. A homeless man named Peachy often hung around on Prospect, nearby. Amadeo gave the key to Peachy and let him sleep on the couch. He wanted to keep someone on the premises at night, when Amadeo would be at his house, in Castle Hill. Peachy moved in and Casa Amadeo’s building did not burn.\n\nHetty Fox, who grew up on Lyman Place (now Elmo Hope Way), loved her neighborhood and the house her family owned. She played street games, won foul-shot shooting contests, and attended Catholic high school and Hunter College. In 1962, at the age of twenty-five, she moved to California, where she became an employment counsellor, then taught psychology, sociology, and race relations at California State University at Northridge. She also travelled as a performer in an African dance troupe. In 1970, she came back to the Bronx, with the idea of living in the family house on Lyman Place and writing a book about her California experiences. She could not believe the destruction that had taken over. To her, it looked like a place with an injury that nobody was trying to heal. At the time, a lot of Bronx residents assumed that the city leaders would see what was happening and take measures to stop it. Hetty Fox thought so, too, at first.\n\nWalking in her neighborhood, she didn’t recognize anybody, and nobody recognized her. She realized that her education had trained people to acquire the skills to move away; in a sense, that was (and is) the point of places like the Bronx—to nurture you well enough that you can move away. But what does this system leave behind? It occurred to her that she could spend years in the basement writing her book and emerge to find her block gone. Did the city intend to reverse the terrible trends she saw playing out? Lyman Place is on ground that slopes downward to the east. Looking in that direction, she saw the plague of fire slowly creeping up from Vyse Avenue, “like the angel of death, with a sword.” Recalling that moment thirty-five years later, in an oral history, she said, “I put that great definitive work”—her book—“down, and I said, ‘I better start saving houses.’ ”\n\nOne morning, I set out to walk the length of the Cross Bronx Expressway, west to east. Interstate 95 crosses over the Hudson River from New Jersey on the George Washington Bridge, goes through the tip of upper Manhattan, and spans the Harlem River on the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. Then it enters the Bronx and becomes the Cross Bronx Expressway, which begins at the intersection with I-87, on the east bank of the Harlem River. That part is a tangle of on- and off-ramps, so I skipped it.\n\nThe name Cross Bronx Expressway first appears on maps just east of the tangle, where the highway cuts Plimpton Avenue in two. I started there. Sometimes an access road next to the highway is considered part of it. Street signs on roads like these oversell them as part of the Cross Bronx Expressway, though they’re just surface streets. The corner where this street meets Plimpton Avenue slumbered at about 7 a.m. No traffic came or went, and a bearded guy was dozing in the driver’s seat of a parked S.U.V. But in the roadcut immediately below—the actual six-lane highway, on which I would not walk, nor should anybody—traffic roared and idled and honked and screeched. The winter sun had risen high enough to lie exactly in line with the road. Light glared on the tops of truck trailers and came through the tinted parts of windshields, coloring the eastbound drivers’ faces greenish blue.\n\nFordham gneiss, one of the three main New York City rock types (Inwood marble and Manhattan schist are the others), had been the road builders’ big obstacle here. Also, the grade could not be too steep. Like all interstates, this highway had to accommodate heavy trucks. Here they needed to be able to climb gradually onto and off the Bronx’s first ridge; the engineers faced the same problem that Break Neck Hill (now part of West Kingsbridge Road, just to the north) had solved centuries before—that of climbing from the valley of the Harlem River. At Break Neck Hill, the road had enough room to sidle back and forth up the ridge, switchback style. The Cross Bronx, conceived in the age of dynamite, blasted straight through.\n\nI followed the road for three or four blocks, until it ended at a T intersection. Then I went over to the interestingly named Featherbed Lane, which winds down the ridge past the Jennie Jerome Playground, becoming East 174th Street. The Cross Bronx goes under the intersection of Featherbed Lane and Jerome Avenue in a tunnel, emerges again in its deep roadcut, and starts up an incline that’s called Walton Slope on the map. Now the highway is ascending the ridge that the Grand Concourse is on. The density of infrastructure here is daunting, and complicated to explain. Nearby, a small playground called Morris Mesa fits itself into a small nook beside the westbound lanes of the highway.\n\nMorris Mesa is an unexpected name, at least for around here. Outside of the American Southwest, I have never come across anyplace else called a mesa. Geographic mesas probably also exist in Mexico and in Spain; the Spanish word means “table.” In Arizona and New Mexico, mesas are what the Zuni and Hopi and other tribes built pueblos on. This mesa playground is a flat, irregularly shaped scrap of land that the highway construction ended up not needing. Near the playground’s fenced-in edge, the wall of the roadcut drops steeply, and the Cross Bronx traffic roars directly below. Sometimes I see a family or two using the slides and the jungle gym, but mostly I find the playground empty.\n\nThe first time I noticed it, four or five years ago, it had a Parks Department historic marker with a couple of paragraphs, mostly about Gouverneur Morris. More recently, that sign has been replaced. The new sign doesn’t mention him. Instead, it says:\n\nMORRIS MESA\n\nWhat was here before?\n\nThis site and surrounding area had about 54 apartment buildings that were demolished to make room for the Cross Bronx Expressway (completed in 1963) at the behest of Arterial Coordinator, Robert Moses (1888-1981). Over 1,000 families were displaced, costing millions of dollars in compensation. This also led to a lot of households leaving on their own accord thus changing the landscape of East Tremont.\n\nThe marker goes on to say that the building of the highway created forty-four new parks, and enumerates the rail, sewer, and power lines, and the roads, subways, and highways that the Cross Bronx Expressway cut through. A concluding paragraph notes that the playground was named for “the prominent Morris family of the Bronx.”\n\n“What was here before?” A good question, but the words left out of it are “this highway,” as in “What was here before this highway?” The skyline hole through which the Cross Bronx Expressway runs was the landscape elephant in the room, until the marker asked the obvious question. This highway, in its day, was the most expensive road ever built. Robert Caro, in “The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York,” described one of Moses’s engineers standing on a vantage point near where the Cross Bronx would begin. The engineer looked east, awestruck, at the rows upon rows of apartment buildings that would have to come down. Sixty-odd years after developers imagined the Bronx’s green hills covered with apartment buildings, other planners devoted themselves to stripping some of the same hills bare. The cost of that destruction, and all it entailed, accounted in part for the highway’s extreme expensiveness. The massive hole in the Bronx’s skyline had been waiting for official on-site recognition, and the marker at Morris Mesa is a good first try.\n\nWhat was here before? One answer: The heart of the new paradise Bronx was here. In 1930, when the infant Cross Bronx, then known by other, provisional names, was in its early planning stages, 1,265,258 people lived in the Bronx. More than a third of the borough’s population lived in the neighborhoods south of the highway’s proposed route. By that time, most of the Bronx had transitioned from streets made of mud or gravel or Belgian block to modern streets that were smoothly paved. The decades encompassing the new paradise Bronx fell approximately between the arrival of widespread paving, in the nineteen-tens and twenties, and the completion of the Cross Bronx Expressway, in 1963.\n\nCity kids had never had so many smooth, hard, open surfaces to play on. The floors in their apartments and houses might be hard and smooth, but you couldn’t roller-skate or play stickball there. On the streets of the Bronx (and Brooklyn, and other city places), you now had paved surfaces that went on and on, where wheels rolled true and balls made predictable bounces, where you could draw neat hopscotch squares in chalk and shoot marbles and take bottle caps (called “loadies”) with a piece of carrot wedged into them for weight and flip them from the ground into boxes, like tiddlywinks. Matthew López-Jensen, an artist friend of mine who lives in the Bronx and finds old stuff all over New York just by looking on the ground, has picked up thirty-nine marbles of various sizes in the borough. Marbles last indefinitely; they are the most common small artifacts that survive of the twentieth-century paradise Bronx, as glass beads are of the fur-trading Dutch.\n\nThe so-called Spaldeen, that pink rubber ball cherished in memory, could be employed not only in stickball (with a bat made of a broken-off broom or mop handle, the broken end rubbed smooth on the pavement) but also in fistball (no bat required), handball (ditto), stoopball (in which you threw the ball against a stoop and your opponent played the bounce), and jacks (one game in which girls, who generally didn’t play ball, might also use a Spaldeen). Manhole covers in the streets were set into the pavement at regular intervals. For a stickball batter to hit a Spaldeen the distance of three manhole covers—“three sewers”—was considered amazing.\n\nIn photographs of the Bronx from that period, the new pavements gleam, mostly car-free. So much in the borough was new and splendid and gleaming. In 1923, Jacob Ruppert, the brewer, and his partner, Cap Huston, built Yankee Stadium on 161st Street by the Harlem River. No other ballpark in America was called a stadium or rose to its nosebleed altitude of three tiers. About Ruth and Gehrig and DiMaggio, and their fellow-Yankees of that heroic era, the poets have already sung. And at the Kingsbridge Armory, then the largest indoor space in the city, you could see car shows or boat shows or rodeos—bucking broncos and steer ropers in the Bronx! Just a five-cent bus or streetcar ride away! Meanwhile, on any day, you had your local movie theatre. Everybody, practically without exception, went to the movies. You could bowl a few frames at the Paradise Lanes, on the Grand Concourse at East 188th, and then cross the street to see a double feature at Loew’s Paradise Theatre, which seated four thousand dazzled moviegoers. After the evening’s features ended and the lights came up, a date night could adjourn to Krum’s, the chocolate shop also known for its delicious sodas, which also was on the Concourse, just one block north.\n\nThe building where Loew’s Paradise Theatre used to be is still standing. For a while, it was under scaffolding and black mesh safety netting like a lady’s veil. The name is still on the front. The ticket booth, its filigree shedding chips of gold paint, still greets the sidewalk. Beyond the booth, the ex-theatre’s row of golden doors is boarded up from inside, except in one place, where I could see into the burgundy-carpeted outer lobby. In the middle of the far wall, is that a statue of St. Francis? For the smell of popcorn to be so totally absent seems sad and wrong.\n\nTo these aspects of paradise could be added the ones that remained from the old-time rural Arcadia going back to the previous century. The botanical garden and the zoo welcomed millions of visitors annually and offered free admission. The borough’s endless parklands had not yet been cut up by highways. You could swim in the Bronx River and in the East River, climb the beech trees in Van Cortlandt Park, sit on your fire escape and hear your neighbors’ different accents and languages, smell five different culinary traditions wafting through your building’s stairwell at suppertime: Paradise.\n\nI had been sitting on a bench at Morris Mesa playground for a while. Stiff in the joints, I stood up and kept walking. In a half mile, the eastbound Cross Bronx traffic had left Walton Slope and the Grand Concourse ridge behind, and suddenly the sky was bigger up ahead. There are places like this on some roads—places where complications seem to fall aside, and the vista opens, and you get a feeling of being free. On this winter morning the sky shone a bright blue, tinged with brownish orange near the horizon. The trucks made that lonesome “see you later” sound they make when they pick up speed and disappear down the road. It’s a Dopplering engine cry that I associate with flat, open places like where I grew up in the Midwest. That the Cross Bronx Expressway can provide room for such a sound in such a densely populated urban place is a remarkable achievement—monstrous, even.\n\nI walked past the intricate, thronging intersections where the Sheridan Expressway and the Bronx River Parkway draw off some of the highway’s flow and contribute their own to it. Then I went under an elevated mega-intersection, on the no man’s ground among the support columns, where I often visit. Just east of Westchester Creek, and about sixty feet up in the air, this monster of a highway intersection, one of the most complicated in the country, renders everything on the ground below it moot. When I’m under the elevated intersection, among its forest of columns, the G.P.S. on my phone sometimes stops working, and says it has “map issues.” From its point of view, I’m nowhere. Here, Interstates 95, 295, 278, and 678 and the Hutchinson River Parkway come together, link up with various on- and off-ramps, and form a nexus that looks like a lopsided six-pointed star from above. In the non-place beneath the highways, the jet-engine-like roar of the traffic and the thumping of tires on the seams of the road above never let up.\n\nSometimes when I’m walking under the mega-intersection, I think about the Bronx as it was two hundred and fifty years ago. There are grassy areas in this understory, and blowing trash, and seldom used foot and bike trails, some of them with crumbling asphalt. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington would have ridden over this ground on reconnaissance tours. Probably, the enslaved person who was closest to him, William Lee, known as Bill, rode alongside, carrying the General’s telescope and other gear. Back then, the whole region was more open than it is today, with vastly longer lines of sight, and telescopes were essential for strategy. Both Bill Lee and Washington rode skillfully, and their horses would have been as good as any in the country. With the highway traffic whooshing and thumping overhead, I imagine Washington, Bill Lee, and the officers of the General’s staff trotting by.\n\nOut here, the view clearly reveals the Bronx’s in-between-ness. Just by the difference in the light in the sky you can tell that the ocean is in one direction and the rest of the continent in the other. The highways I had passed all brought the same message: Traffic coming from elsewhere and going elsewhere needed passage through this landscape in between. Before the big highways came, residents of the borough probably did not realize that they were standing in the metro area’s future express lanes. The new paradise Bronx would not know what hit it. ♦\n\nThis is drawn from “Paradise Bronx: The Life and Times of New York’s Greatest Borough.”"
