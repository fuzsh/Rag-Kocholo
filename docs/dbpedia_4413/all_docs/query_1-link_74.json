        "text": "It might be the last place in the city you’d expect to find an artful and expressive monument to World War I heroes.\n\nBut not far from Brooklyn’s busy Broadway Junction subway stop, near the bus depot and behind a chain-link fence at Broadway and Herkimer Street in East New York, is a tall bronze plaque framed in granite.\n\nThe plaque presents a touching image: a bas relief of a robed figure deep in mourning. The figure is reclining on the ground, faceless under a head covering, holding what appears to be a palm branch in one hand.\n\nUnder the figure’s elbow is a realistically carved subway car—with the initials BRT inside a circular logo above the train.\n\nMost contemporary New Yorkers probably wouldn’t recognize those initials. But BRT stood for Brooklyn Rapid Transit system—the public transit company formed in 1896 that consolidated several existing railroad lines in Brooklyn and Queens. The BRT operated surface trains and subway routes until it went bankrupt in 1919.\n\nBefore the BMT went under, the company built this monument. “Dedicated by the employees of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit System to the memory of their fallen HEROES in the world war, 1917-1918,” the plaque reads.\n\nMore than 50 names are emblazoned on the plaque, as well as each man’s job and the location where he worked.\n\nThe humanity of this monument makes its presence with the names. Pvt. Theodore P. Jensen was a motorman based out of the Ninth Avenue Depot. Pvt. August Hegel was a machinist at the repair shop at Fresh Pond. Sgt. Bernard F. Spaulding was a plumber’s helper in the Building Department.\n\nMany decades after this memorial went up, transit workers added a small plaque on the cement base in memory of “World War II, Korean, and Vietnam War Veterans.” Beyond this additional plaque, there’s no signs of recent visitors, no wreaths or flowers. That seems to be the fate of many Great War monuments outside Manhattan, like this one in Hunts Point.\n\nOne intriguing mystery is the name of the sculptor: A. Zeitlin, it looks like. A Russian-born sculptor named Alexandre Zeitlin came to New York City in 1915 and became noted for his statuettes and portrait busts before his death in the 1940s. Could this be the artist behind this mostly forgotten monument to dozens of young transit workers cut down by war?\n\n[Thanks to Jim S. for the photos and alerting me to this hiding-in-plain-sight memorial]\n\nTags: Alexandre Zeitlin sculptor, Brooklyn Rapid Transit War Memorial East New York, Brooklyn War Memorials, Brooklyn World War I Memorial, BRT War Memorial East New York, Forgotten War Memorials New York City, WWI Memorials New York City"
