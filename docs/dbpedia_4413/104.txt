The Eastern Boulevard Bridge carries the Bruckner Expressway (I-278) over the Bronx River. It links the Hunts Point and Soundview sections of the Bronx. The Bruckner Expressway essentially runs northeast-southwest, beginning at the Triborough Bridge and ending at the New England Thruway, near Co-op City. The bridge consists of two parallel structures orientated east-west.

The Eastern Boulevard Bridge is a dual double-leaf trunnion bascule bridge with a span of 36.2 meters (118 feet, 6 inches) center to center of trunnions. Just west of the bridge is a fixed bridge that carries I-278 over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line.

Each of the two bridges carries three expressway lanes on a 10-meter (34-foot) roadway, two service road lanes on a 6.7-meter (22-foot) roadway and a 2.3-meter (7'-6") sidewalk on the outside of each service road.
