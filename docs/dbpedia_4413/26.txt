First up, some very tame woods, with a picnic bench:

About a mile away, a peaceful – if rainy and foggy – stretch of water, as seen from a causeway:

This is, against most people’s expectations, the Bronx. More specifically, it’s Pelham Bay Park, and Eastchester Bay, where the Hutchinson River meets the Long Island Sound.

Here’s a Sanborn map from 1897:

This is the north half of the East Bronx. The small inset map next to the north arrow shows the entire city of New York as it was in 1897, with the different colored areas representing different volumes of the Sanborn maps: Manhattan Island (map volumes 1 through 8, 11, and 11-1/2), the West Bronx (a chunk of the Westchester County mainland annexed in 1874, map volumes 9, 10, and 12), and the East Bronx (annexed in 1895, map volumes A and B). The consolidation that joined Kings County (Brooklyn), Queens County, and Richmond County (Staten Island) to the city happened one year later.

My first picture is in the area of map 48, near where Pelham Bridge Road intersects City Island Road); my second picture was on the causeway of what was then called Eastern Boulevard, where it crosses Eastchester Bay. The steel-and-concrete bridge I was on was built in 1908, replacing an 1870 steel bridge, which replaced an 1834 wood bridge, which replaced an 1812 wood bridge. The current bridge is scheduled for replacement.

The biggest change since 1897 is that Rodman’s Neck was joined by landfill to Hunter’s Island and Twin Island to create Orchard Beach, AKA the Riviera of the Bronx. Orchard Beach and pretty much everything east of the Hutchinson River was then and is now Pelham Bay Park, as it says on the map.
