This landmark work of Colombian literature charts the story of seven generations of the Buendiá family, living in the mythical town of Macondo. Like The Alchemist, the story is set in motion by a dream vision: patriarch José Arcadio establishes Macondo after dreaming of a “city of mirrors,” and becomes the site of many magical and marvellous happenings. Author Gabriel García Márquez—known fondly as ‘Gabo’ across South America—won the Nobel Prize in 1982 “for his novels and short stories, in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent’s life and conflicts.” If you enjoyed the fable-like structure of The Alchemist, we think you’ll like the magical realism of Gabriel García Márquez.
