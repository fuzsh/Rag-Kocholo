The Colombian writer, best known for his hallucinatory masterpiece 100 Years of Solitiude, is one of the giants of South American and World literature, credited with perfecting the magic-realist style that influenced generations and inspired filmmakers worldwide. Among the film adaptations of his novels are 1983’s Erendira by Ruy Guerra with Irene Papas, Arturo Ripstein’s No One Writes to the Coronel (1999) with Salma Hayek and Love in the Time of Cholera (2007), about two lovers thwarted in their youth who reunite when they are in their 80s, directed by Mike Newell, starring Javier Bardem, Giovanna Mezzogiorno and Benjamin Bratt which included the Golden Globe nominated song La Despedida, performed by Shakira."
