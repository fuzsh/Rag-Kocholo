        "text": "The first ever Nobel Prize in Colombia was given to Gabriel Garcia Marquez for he‚Äôs incredible literary works, especially ‚ÄúCien a√±os de Soledad‚Äù\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez is a very controversial man, but nevertheless he is someone extremely important in our latin American culture. He‚Äôs literary style of magical realism took over the world. In 1982 he was granted the Nobel Prize ‚Äúfor his novels and short stories, in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent‚Äôs life and conflicts‚Äù\n\nHe‚Äôs writing did capture the world, as well as bring attention not only to Colombia but latin America speaking on violence that violence that plagued his country. He usually referred to this as ‚ÄúLa Violencia‚Äù and talk about it in his books. This violence in Colombia has usually been always political and its been a civil war all the way through the 1960‚Äôs, but he doesn‚Äôt write about it as political propaganda, instead ‚ÄúFor him, the duty of the revolutionary writer is to write well, and the ideal novel is one that moves its reader by its political and social content, and, at the same time, by its power to penetrate reality and expose its other side.‚Äù\n\nDespite if you agree with Gabriel‚Äôs philosophies or don‚Äôt like him because he left Colombia to live in Mexico or because he was dear friend with Fidel Castro or whatever the reason may be. There is one thing you can‚Äôt deny and is that he‚Äôs literature was so powerful that even to this day he legacy lives on in Colombia, Latin America and the U.S.\n\nCitations:"
