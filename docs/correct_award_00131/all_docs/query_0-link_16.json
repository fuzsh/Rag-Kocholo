        "text": "Alexander Nazaryan (an editor at the N. Y. Daily News, of all things) has an article in Salon about American writers: none of them has won the Nobel Prize lately. So how come? The critics and the academics fulminate, the Oateses and the Roths and the Delillos pout.\n\nWell, Nazaryan suggests “a valid point about American letters: We’ve become an Oldsmobile in a world yearning for a Prius. Our paint is flaking. Nobody wants our clunkers.”\n\nhttp://entertainment.salon.com/2011/10/03/why_americans_don_t_win_nobel\n\nThe only American even remotely in the running that I’d vote for is Cormac McCarthy.\n\nThere’s a problem… American writers are rarely jailed because of their work.\n\nAnd no, I’m not kidding. A large number of recent Nobel winners write on political themes and/or have been victims of various forms of oppression and/or have chronicled the oppression of others. Contemporary American novelists mostly stay far away from the political arena.\n\nWhich is not to say that only political literature is “important,” just that it does seem to be more likely to catch the Academy’s eye.\n\nKatherine\n\nAfter the Rigoberta Menchu fiasco, it lost some respect.\n\nhttp://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=24278\n\n[b]I, Rigoberta Menchu, Liar\n\nBy: David Horowitz\n\nFrontPageMagazine.com | Friday, February 26, 1999\n\nTHE STORY OF RIGOBERTA MENCHU, a Quiche Mayan from Guatemala, whose autobiography catapulted her to international fame, won her the Nobel Peace Prize, and made her an international emblem of the dispossessed indigenous peoples of the Western hemisphere and their attempt to rebel against the oppression of European conquerors, has now been exposed as a political fabrication, a tissue of lies, and one of the greatest intellectual and academic hoaxes of the Twentieth Century.[/b]\n\nfull article at the link above\n\nSorry. I thought that, as I posted on a writers’ forum, and as I cited an article about American writers, and as it’s in the section titled “All About Authors,” it was clear that I was referring to the Nobel Prize for Literature, this year’s winner of which will be announced tomorrow.\n\nNobel Prizes, like any other awards, have once in a while been given to undeserving people. If you want to look at the Peace Prize, go back to 1973, when it was given to Henry Kissinger, the worst choice in the history of the awards. Most of the time, however, the Peace Prize, like the others, has gone to a deserving entity. This year’s prize will be announced on Friday.\n\nAs for the Literature Prize, the Pulitzer and the Nobel are miles apart.\n\nEvery year, six Americans receive awards for writing something: Biography, Drama, Fiction (used to be Novel), General Non-fiction, History, and Poetry. The awards have been made since the early 1920s, so about 550 Pulitzers have been given, virtually all to Americans.\n\nEvery year, one person on the planet receives an award for Literature. So far, eight (I think; rough count) Americans have won in the 110 years of the prize.\n\nOne in 8, or one in 550. Not to mention the differences in money, prestige, and respect from one’s peers.\n\nps\n\nNaw, it was kinda apples and oranges on my part… the prize was for Peace, but her book played a large role in it, which was exposed as a fraud… like most things in life, it has detractors and critics, and those who hang on their every word as Gospel truth…\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is full of controversy. One author I feel always deserved the award but never got it was Graham Greene. Ditto Nabakov and Twain. There are authors who win and leave the “Literary Community” scratching their heads saying “WHO?!?”\n\nSome say it’s a “left” / “right” thing. Solzhenitsyn ended up refusing it when the Swedes wouldn’t let him accept at the embassy. You can look at Jorge Luis Borges who defended Pinochet and didn’t win, but the you have Gabriel Garcia Marquez who supports Castro and won.\n\nHer book was not nearly the travesty that Horowitz would have you believe. (DISCLAIMER: I’m automatically suspicious of anything with Horowitz’ name on it.) There’s clarification in an extended article last year in The Nation <http://www.thenation.com/article/154582/it-was-heaven-they-burned>.\n\nThe Nobel people, acknowledging discrepancies in her book (some of the problems were that it’s an “as told to Y” rather than an “as written by X” publication) still support her right to the prize.\n\nThe Peace Prize to Obama still puzzles me. The best explanation I can devise is that he was a stand-in for American voters, who had disavowed the Bush-Cheney regime by electing a Democrat.\n\nAll that aside, and trying to judge on literary merit rather than political activity, who among living American writers would be most deserving of the Prize for Literature? I still vote McCarthy.\n\nps"
