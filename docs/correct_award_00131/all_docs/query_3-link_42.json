        "text": "Alfred A. Knopf will publish a new book by the Nobel Prize-winning writer Gabriel García Márquez in 2024. The novel, UNTIL AUGUST (in Spanish, EN AGOSTO NOS VEMOS), is an unpublished work that García Márquez wrote before his death in 2014. Reagan Arthur, Knopf EVP and Publisher, acquired North American rights from the Carmen Balcells Literary Agency in Barcelona; Diana Tejerina Miller, Knopf Vice President and Executive Editor, will edit. The book will be published by Knopf in hardcover, e-book, and in audio by Penguin Random House as part of a simultaneous global publication in 2024. It will be translated from the Spanish by Anne McLean and published in trade paperback by Vintage a year later.\n\nGarcía Márquez’s sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo García Barcha, said of the work: “UNTIL AUGUST was the result of our father’s last effort to continue creating against all odds. Reading it once again almost ten years after his death, we discovered that the text had many highly enjoyable merits and nothing that prevents us from delighting in the most outstanding aspects of Gabo’s work: his capacity for invention, his poetic language, his captivating storytelling, his understanding of humankind and his affection for our experiences and misadventures, especially in love, possibly the main theme of all his work.”\n\nReagan Arthur said: “Gabriel García Márquez is one of the world’s most beloved and acclaimed storytellers, and it’s been Knopf’s great honor to publish him: we’re thrilled by the opportunity to bring this re-discovered masterpiece to readers.”"
