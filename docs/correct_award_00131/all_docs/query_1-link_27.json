Many more would follow from his prolific pen, Marquez producing six novels, five novellas, seven short story anthologies and eight non-fiction books over the course of an illustrious career.\n\nMarquez used his newfound fame to espouse international left-wing causes and decry dictatorships, standing as an outspoken opponent of Augusto Pinochet in Chile and friend to Cuban leader Fidel Castro.\n\nHis allegiance to the latter was sometimes controversial, not least when he continued to support the Lion of Havana during the show trial of regime critic Herberto Padilla in 1968. The men truly became close in 1977, bonding over seafood and a shared love of literature. Castro proved himself an adept and insightful critic of Marquez's writing and even proofread some of his later works.\n\nThe fantastical literary style for which Marquez became known - along with his contemporaries Julio Cortazar and Jorge Luis Borges - was inspired by the romantic history of South America, the continent seemingly existing in a constant state of flux, defined over the centuries by its Conquistador conquerors, lush landscapes, fiery revolutions, passionate artistry and strongman political leaders.\n\n\"We have had to ask but little of imagination, for our crucial problem has been a lack of conventional means to render our lives believable,\" he said in his Nobel acceptance speech.\n\nWorld news in pictures\n\nShow all 50\n\nMagic realism has since flourished across the world and inspired a legion of post-colonial writers following in Marquez's footsteps from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Everyone from Salman Rushdie and Orhan Pamuk to Arundhati Roy and Haruki Murakami owes a debt to this supreme stylist.\n\nMarquez himself remained realistic about his craft, however, telling The Paris Review in 1982: \"Ultimately, literature is nothing but carpentry. Both are very hard work. Writing something is almost as hard as making a table.\n\n\"With both, you are working with reality, a material just as hard as wood. Both are full of tricks and techniques. Basically, very little magic and a lot of hard work are involved,\" he said.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
