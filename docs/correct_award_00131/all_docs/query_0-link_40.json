        "text": "Gabriel García Márquez, (born March 6, 1927, Aracataca, Colom.—died April 17, 2014, Mexico City, Mex.), Latin American writer. He worked many years as a journalist in Latin American and European cities and later also as a screenwriter and publicist, before settling in Mexico. His best-known work, the novel One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), recounts the history of the fictional village of Macondo, the setting of much of his work; enormously admired and influential, it became the principal vehicle for the style known as magic realism. Later novels include The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975), Love in the Time of Cholera (1985), The General in His Labyrinth (1989), and Memories of My Melancholy Whores (2004). His collections of short stories and novellas include No One Writes to the Colonel (1968) and Leaf Storm (1955). In 2002 he published Living to Tell the Tale, an autobiographical account of his early years. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982."
