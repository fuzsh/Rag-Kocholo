        "text": "What is your definition of a writer? \"All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you: the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was. If you can get so that you can give that to people, then you are a writer.\" - Nobel Prize laureate Ernest Hemingway's definition of a writer. #NobelPrize\n\n\"When I was nine years old, my parents gave me a chemistry set. Within a week, I had decided to become a chemist and never wavered from that choice. As I grew my interest in chemistry grew more intense, if not more sophisticated. (...) I was not a particularly distinguished student as a child. My grades were good but obtained more by steady work than any brilliance on my part. I vividly remember my father telling me that one of my elementary school teachers had told him that I was not brilliant but I was a steady hard worker. Somehow the further I progressed in school, the easier it became to do well.\" Remembering Robert Curl who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Harold Kroto and Richard Smalley \"for their discovery of fullerenes\". From an early age Robert Curl realised that he wanted to become a chemist, read his life story: https://bit.ly/2On128N #NobelPrize\n\n\"I think writing is a kind of gift. A new novel or a new play, it's a gift I get... I need to have breaks or pauses when I don't write. You can't get gifts all the time.\" Literature laureate Jon Fosse in our new podcast episode: https://lnkd.in/eUA9wtbj #NobelPrize\n\n“They made me fall in love with quantum mechanics and atomic physics,” said physics laureate Anne L’Huillier of two “great teachers”. She benefitted from being taught by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and Serge Haroche, who would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 and 2012 respectively. L'Huillier was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 2023 for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter.

Shortly after, he published four papers that presented revolutionary ideas, including the Theory of Special Relativity and the Light Quanta Hypothesis. Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" Read Einstein's doctoral thesis in German: http://bit.ly/2Nhm8DV An English translation: http://bit.ly/2z2pDeq\n\nWhat does chess have to do with economics? The answer is game theory. In these games like chess, players must think ahead and devise a strategy based on expected countermoves from other players. These interactions characterise many economic situations. Game theory is a theoretical framework that tries to produce the most optimal decision-making of competing actors in a strategic setting. When describing the economic theory, Reinhard Selten told the New York Times that the theory was like chess: “You may not always be right, but such thinking probably makes you play better and keeps you from making as many dumb moves.” The foundations for using game theory in economics were introduced in a monumental study by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern entitled 'Theory of Games and Economic Behavior' (1944). Fifty years later, Selten, John Harsanyi and John Nash were awarded the prize in economic sciences for their contributions to the field.

As long as you're learning, you're not old.\" Take a look at some snapshots of the pioneering physicist Rosalyn Yalow throughout her life. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1977 for developing radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.

If you’re a pessimist, a failed experiment will tell you that the whole idea is bad and you’ll quit. When you fail you have to continue.\" - chemistry laureate Richard Henderson's advice to young scientists."
