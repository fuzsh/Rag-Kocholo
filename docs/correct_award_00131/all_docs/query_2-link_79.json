        "text": "Colombian author and journalist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1982 for his novel “100 Years of Solitude,” died Thursday. He was 87 and had been recovering from a recent bout with pneumonia at his Mexico City home in the days before his death.\n\nMarquez also wrote the acclaimed novel “Love in the Time of Cholera,” which was adapted into the 2007 feature film starring Oscar winner Javier Bardem.\n\nKnown to his fans as “Gabo,” Marquez was born in Aracataca, Colombia, a town that would serve as the inspiration for the imaginary Macondo, the setting of “100 Years of Solitude.”\n\nMarquez helped change the landscape of Latin American literature and became of master of Magical Realism with his acclaimed short stories and novels, which also included “Autumn of the Patriarch,” “Chronicle of a Death Foretold” and “No One Writes to the Colonel.” The highly acclaimed “100 Years of Solitude” went on to sell over 50 million copies and has been translated into more than 25 languages.\n\nVariety Latino Version\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Love in the Time of Cholera” was far from the only Marquez work adapted for the bigscreen; more recently there was 2009’s Colombian adaptation of “Of Love and Other Demons.” At least a dozen of his short stories were adapted into feature or TV films, and he also penned a number of screenplays. The 1984 Japanese film “Farewell to the Ark,” directed by Shuji Terayama, was adapted from “100 Years of Solitude.”\n\nHis first screen credit was for the 1954 short “La langosta azul,” which he penned and co-directed. In 2011 he served as a script doctor on the Juan Pablo Bustamante film “Lecciones para un beso.”\n\nHe also penned two Spanish-language TV miniseries in the early 1990s and served on the Cannes Film Festival jury in 1982.\n\nMarquez was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer in 1999 that later metastasized. He was admitted to a Mexico City hospital on March 31 to receive treatment for a lung and urinary tract infection and was released on April 8.\n\nHe began his career as a journalist after studying law at the National University of Colombia.\n\nThe author’s most recent work was the novel “Memories of My Melancholy Whores,” published in 2004.\n\nMarquez is survived by his wife and two sons."
