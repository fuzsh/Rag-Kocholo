        "text": "A treasure: Gabriel García Márquez’s unpublished novel. An irresistible story of fleeting, tangled love that recaptures the coveted pleasure of reading the best Gabo.\n\nAlmost ten years after the death of Gabriel García Márquez, the publication of his posthumous novel, En agosto nos vemos, promises to be one of the year’s literary highlights.\n\nEvery 16 August, Ana Magdalena Bach travels to a Caribbean island to put flowers on her mother's grave. One year, on a warm evening, alone and faraway from her husband and children, she meets a handsome stranger with whom she is willing to surrender to a night of passion.\n\nA joyous anthem in praise of women's freedom and an exploration of midlife female desire and sexuality. A grand finale that concludes the biography of an irreplaceable classic, one of the great names of universal literature.\n\n“His intelligence and exceptional use of language have ensured that his best work remains undiminished[...] A feast of originality and sheer inventiveness.” Michael Greenberg, The New York Times\n\n“The narrative style is cool.” Lucy Hughes-Hallett, The Guardian\n\n“…en esta brevedad de seis capítulos, el autor reescribió como quien pule una piedra preciosa, y alcanzó una breve obra maestra de la literatura, intuyendo que no todo estaba resuelto en los encuentros corporales y sexuales de Ana Magdalena Bach, sino en los silencios cifrados del deseo no siempre alcanzado.” Gustavo Tatis Guerra, El Periódico (Colombia)\n\n“Está la insistencia en mostrar…Está la temporalidad recurrente…. Está, cómo no, la literatura… Está una atmósfera inconfundible… Está el amor, el tema que recoge motivos y técnicas en la obra de García Márquez…. Está la vida imaginada de Ana Magdalena Bach tratando de acortar y comprender las distancias entre la realidad falseada y la ficción verídica…[… ] Y está la firmeza de un escritor por volver a contar una historia construida bajo el velo del lenguaje.” Ricardo Baixeras, El Periódico de España\n\n“Sus hijos tuvieron toda la razón cuando decidieron traicionar al padre y publicarla.” Carlos Granés, ABC\n\n“En agosto nos vemos es otra obra maestra del autor de Cien años de soledad, con un tema nuevo en su producción y un final impactante”. J. A. Masoliver Ródenas, La Vanguardia\n\n“Se lee con amabilidad, tiene ráfagas de belleza, calidez… Tiene virtudes, y a quién no le va a gustar el reencuentro con un autor que lo hizo feliz. No hay vergüenza alguna en que el inédito vea la luz.” Nadal Suau, El País\n\n“En agosto nos vemos es también otra prueba irrefutable de su talento, dedicación y amor por la literatura. Es una obra imprescindible. El broche final a una carrera y una vida únicas.” Juan Cruz, El Periódico\n\n“Nadie como él ha logrado con un adjetivo develar la naturaleza de un sustantivo.” Conrado Zuluaga\n\n“Una de las obras más terrenales, hondas y políticas del Nobel colombiano, y con la que salda una deuda: dar el protagonismo absoluto a una mujer. [...] Relampaguea la belleza de su mundo literario hasta conmover. Una novela desigual, pero donde un solo párrafo de su genio vale todo el libro, y muchos libros enteros de muchísimos escritores.” W. Manrique Sabogal, WMagazin\n\n“Et c’est tout l’art consommé de Garcia Marquez qui fait d’Ana Magdalena un personnage féminin aussi puissant et marquant, qui rejoint ainsi la Graciela de Diatriba de amor contra un hombre sentado, Ursula Iguaran et « Remedios la bella » dans Cent ans de solitude.” Le Figaro Littéraire\n\nFridays are different. Every other day of the week, the Colonel and his ailing wife fight a constant battle against poverty and monotony, scraping together the dregs of their savings for the food and medicine that keeps them alive. But on Fridays the postman comes - and that sets a fleeting wave of hope rushing through the General's ageing heart. For fifteen years he's watched the mail launch come into harbour, hoping he'll be handed an envelope containing the army pension promised to him all those years ago. Whilst he waits for the cheque, his hopes are pinned on his prize bird and the upcoming cockfighting season. But until then the bird - like the Colonel and his wife - must somehow be fed.\n\n“I think it's my best book, without any doubt. I had to write Cien años de soledad so that people would read El coronel no tiene quien le escriba.” Gabriel García Márquez\n\n“In my opinion, and I’ve said so more than once, Garcia Marquez’s masterpiece is El coronel no tiene quien le escriba.” Mario Benedetti\n\n“[...] what lies between Leaf Storm and One Hundred Years of Solitude is around fifteen years of getting annoyed a lot, living a lot and being aware of this every day, trying to see how things were.” Gabriel García Márquez\n\nGabriel García Márquez stated on several occasions that nothing interesting happened to him after the age of eight. Although this is just a joke tinged with nostalgia, the fact is that until that early age little Gabo grew up in the care of his grandparents in a town called Aracataca, listening to the true and wonderful stories that they told him about the war - where his grandfather fought as a colonel, and about his family history, the world of the past, and the ghosts that inhabited the house. A mythical universe that years later would come to life under the indelible name of Macondo, an invented town where many of the best stories written by Gabriel García Márquez take place.\n\nThis anthology brings together all the texts that during fifteen years prefigured the territory of One Hundred Years of Solitude: masterful stories such as There Are No Thieves in This Town, and memorable short novels such as Leaf Storm or No One Writes to the Colonel, as well as the notes for a 1950 novel. A fascinating journey to the most visited fictional town in the world.\n\nThen she looked at me. I thought that she was looking at me for the first time. But then, when she turned around behind the lamp and I kept feeling her slippery and oily look in back of me, over my shoulder, I understood that it was I who was looking at her for the first time. I lit a cigarette. I took a drag on the harsh, strong smoke, before spinning in the chair, balancing on one of the rear legs. After that I saw her there, as if she'd been standing beside the lamp looking at me every night. For a few brief minutes that's all we did: look at each other. I looked from the chair, balancing on one of the rear legs. She stood, with a long and quiet hand on the lamp, looking at me. I saw her eyelids lighted up as on every night. It was then that I remembered the usual thing, when I said to her: 'Eyes of a blue dog.' Without taking her hand off the lamp she said to me: 'That. We'll never forget that.' She left the orbit, sighing: 'Eyes of a blue dog. I've written it everywhere.'\n\nThese early short stories, written and published between 1947 and 1955, appear as a book in 1972.\n\nThis collection of fiction, representing some of García Márquez's earlier work, includes eleven short stories and a novella, Innocent Eréndira, in which a young girl who dreams of freedom cannot escape the reach of her vicious and avaricious grandmother.\n\n'Eréndira was bathing her grandmother when the wind of misfortune began to blow'\n\nWhile her grotesque and demanding grandmother retires to bed, Eréndira still has floors to wash, sheets to iron, and a peacock to feed. The never-ending chores leave the young girl so exhausted that's he collapses into bed with the candle still glowing on a nearby table - and is fast asleep when it topples over. . . Eight hundred and seventy-two thousand, three hundred and fifteen pesos, her grandmother calculates, is the amount that Eréndira must repay for the loss of the house. As she is dragged by her grandmother from town to town and hawked to soldiers, smugglers and traders, Eréndira feels herself dying. Can the love of a virgin save the young whore from her hell?\n\nIn 1973, the film director Miguel Littín fled Chile after a U.S.-supported military coup toppled the democratically elected socialist government of Salvador Allende. The new dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, instituted a reign of terror and turned Chile into a laboratory to test the poisonous prescriptions of the American economist Milton Friedman. In 1985, Littín returned to Chile disguised as a Uruguayan businessman. He was desperate to see the homeland he’d been exiled from for so many years; he also meant to pull off a very tricky stunt: with the help of three film crews from three different countries, each supposedly busy making a movie to promote tourism, he would secretly put together a film that would tell the truth about Pinochet’s benighted Chile—a film that would capture the world’s attention while landing the general and his secret police with a very visible black eye.\n\nAfterwards, the great novelist Gabriel García Márquez sat down with Littín to hear the story of his escapade, with all its scary, comic, and not-a-little surreal ups and downs. Clandestine in Chile is a true-life adventure story and a classic of modern reportage.\n\n“García Márquez, a formidable journalist as well as a great writer, writes all about that political environment with precision and a brutal handling of small details, while also becoming a witness to an impossible world.” (Guillermo Altares, El País)\n\n“With that torrential, direct and beautiful style that characterises his prose, and the wit of a restless journalist, García Márquez pours his impressions into a book that reads as if the reader were the one accompanying the writer.” (Natalio Blanco, Esquire)\n\n“A dazzling account in which admiration for socialism mixes with criticism of a Kafkaesque bureaucracy and the capture of a climate of incipient absurdity.” (Martín Pérez, Página 12)\n\nDe viaje por Europa del Este is a first-hand account of young García Márquez’s journey through the Socialist Bloc countries in the 1950s, right after Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian revolution in 1956. Along with comments from his travelling companions, its pages contain a keen analysis, not without irony, of the social and political developments of that period. This journey of contrasts starts in East Berlin and continues through Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary all the way to Moscow. With the author’s unsurpassed lucidity, it provides a nuanced account of everyday life in a system with an expiration date, where every detail reveals the ambivalent face of true socialism.\n\nWritten and published in instalments during the same period as his legendary The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor, this work is another priceless example of Gabo’s narrative mastery. It reveals his deepest vocation and hallmark: the pleasure of telling a good story.\n\nA commemorative edition of Love in the Times of Cholera, a great classic by Gabriel García Márquez and an essential novel of contemporary literature.\n\n\"It was inevitable: the scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.\"\n\nThat is how one of the most wonderful love stories in world literature begins. An unrequited love story that lasts for half a century with a little Caribbean port town as the background. The Nobel Price in Literature presents the magical relationship between Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza as if it were a tropical mixture of plants and clay, for a master to mold and fantasize with however he pleases, between the territories of myth and legend. The juices, the smells and the tastes of the tropic feed a hallucinatory prose that has won the favor of thousands of readers around the world.\n\n\"This brilliant and heartbreaking novel is perhaps one of the best love stories ever told.\" The New York Times Book Review\n\nA commemorative edition of a key novel in the history of literature.\n\nOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the publication of One Hundred Years of Solitude comes an edition containing unpublished illustrations by Chilean artist Luisa Rivera, with a typography created by Gabriel García Márquez’s son, Gonzalo García Barcha.\n\n“Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Coronel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” Thus begins one of the most important novels of the 20th century, and one of the most fascinating literary adventures of all time. Millions of copies of One Hundred Years of Solitude, read in every language, and a Nobel Prize for Literature have crowned a work that made its way “from mouth to mouth,” as its author liked to say. This is the most palpable proof that the fabulous adventure of the Buendía-Iguarán family, with its miracles, fantasies, obsessions, tragedies, incest, adultery, rebellions, discoveries and imprisonments, simultaneously represented the myth and the history, the tragedy and the love, of the entire world.\n\nWith Living to Tell the Tale, Gabriel García Márquez offers the first volume of his life story, a tale as rich in humor and fantastic incident as any of his unforgettable novels. It takes the reader from his birth in Aracataca, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, through his childhood and school years in Baranquilla and Bogotá, into his early years as a journalist and up to the moment in 1955 when he leaves for Europe with a promise from the woman he will eventually marry.\n\nLiving to Tell the Tale has the shape, the quality, and the vividness of a conversation with the reader—a tale of people, places, and events as they occur to him: the colorful stories of his eccentric family members; the great influence of his mother and maternal grandfather; the myths and mysteries of his beloved Colombia; personal details, undisclosed until now, that would appear later, transmuted and transposed, in his fiction; and, above all, his fervent desire to become a writer. As in his fiction, the narrator here is an inspired observer of the physical world, able to make clear the emotions and passions that lie at the heart of a life—in this instance, García Márquez’s own.\n\n“Journalism is the profession that most closely resembles boxing, with the advantage that the machine always wins, and the disadvantage that we’re not allowed to throw in the towel.”\n\nIn his memoirs, Gabriel García Márquez describes how his earliest, deepest vocation was always to become a writer. Working as a journalist was never part of his plan until a master of the profession showed him the possibilities of reporting as a literary genre. Persuaded that \"novel and article are children of the same mother,\" he learned the trade, became passionate about it, and devoted the best pages of his literary production to it for decades.\n\nThis volume contains a selection of García Márquez’s most masterful chronicles. In these stories, there’s no lack of continued reflection on the trade of journalist and novelist. The reader will discover a fascination with stories that challenge our image of reality, sometimes because we’ll never fully understand them, such as the mysterious Wilma Montesi case, after which this book is named. And sometimes because they force us to look at the world with new eyes, open to marvelling at the contradictions, misfortunes, and wonders that govern its unpredictable mechanism.\n\n“His journalistic stories always include all the necessary components of journalism: the prior reporting, well-chosen quotes from sources, and descriptions of the moment and place in history. But they also contain all the key elements of a ‘story well told'.” Jon Lee Anderson\n\n“The Scandal of the Century demonstrate[s] that his forthright, lightly ironical voice just seemed to be there, right from the start. . . . He had a way of connecting the souls in all his writing, fiction and nonfiction, to the melancholy static of the universe.” The New York Times\n\n“Throughout his career, García Márquez consistently sought to use that freedom, ranging back and forth between reportage and fiction, in order to show us how we might make it our own.” Tony Wood, Literary Hub\n\n“He was one of the few Latin American authors of his generation – another unescapable example is Mario Vargas Llosa – who believed that journalism well done could become art, and acted accordingly.” Leila Guerriero\n\n“García Márquez seemed to have no other purpose than to tell a good story, the best story possible every week.” Antonio Muñoz Molina\n\n“This brilliant collection . . . puts his journalism on the same level as his fiction, which is quite some level.” Salman Rushdie\n\n“This collection is a master class on how to write for a newspaper: lush, vivid columns full of information, irony, whimsy, humor, skepticism and rumination, just what one would expect.” Seymour M. Hersh\n\n“Márquez’s fiction would not exist without his journalism, just as without his fiction his journalism would not exist: they nourished each other. Some of [his] journalistic pieces are every bit as good as his fiction at its best.” Javier Cercas\n\nThe exceptional correspondence between four great writers who were also great friends and allies. An invaluable testament to an incomparable epoch and generation.\n\nWritten between 1955 and 2012, the 207 letters in this book reproduce the friendship that was built up between four of the greatest boom writers, from different countries and each with his own narrative project. Although they would drift apart over time because of political and personal differences, for decades they regaled each other with generous displays of affection and admiration, shared their doubts and valuable advice on the craft of writing, and were accomplices in their mutual success, despite the fact that success came to each of them at a different time and in a different way.\n\nThis newly published correspondence takes the reader behind the curtains into the private lives underlying that success. It constitutes an invaluable document not only for understanding a key period in Latin American literature and history, but also for discovering the most human and private side of Julio Cortázar, Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel García Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa.\n\nEdition by Carlos Aguirre, Gerald Martin, Javier Munguía y Augusto Wong Campos.\n\n“A luminous book, as enduring as the history it describes. Las cartas del Boom evokes the spirit of elation in which the most powerful phenomenon of 20th century literary creation in Spanish emerged.” Juan Cruz, El Periódico\n\n“These letters make for absorbing reading and bring to light the hidden workings of literature. Truly a historical book.” El Cultural\n\n“An epistolary book like few others, because it is a portrait of an epoch.\" Sergio Ramirez\n\n“In an epoch where the so-called literatures of the self prevail, these letters that were not written with literary intent have now become, inadvertently, literature (of the self) and a historical document.” Laura Ventura, La Nación\n\n“An exceptional human, intellectual and literary document (...) What makes the volume special is the lay-out of this epistolary, which succeeds in creating the sensation of a live conversation between the four writers. (...) They are like teenagers discussing what they are passionate about and fall in love with. Their voices can be heard, sometimes almost audible, sometimes fast, measured or meditative, and concerned with giving each other support. They express themselves sincerely and candidly when they comment on their works.” Winston Manrique Sabogal\n\n“Seeing some of the greatest authors of the 20th century talking to each other in private, without imagining that anyone will find out what they are saying, turns the reader of their correspondence into someone spying on the history of literature.” Xavi Ayén, La Vanguardia"
