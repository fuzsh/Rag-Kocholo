The capstone of our 55th anniversary season begins with a trip down memory lane, as we recreate the opening of the BSO’s very first concert with Nicolai’s Merry Wives of Windsor Overture. Our Youth Concerto Competition Winner, Catelijne Hunt, shows us the talent of future musical generations with Saint-Saëns’s Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, and we will revel in the artistry of our musicians of today with Sibelius’s Symphony No. 2. We’ve been making music with our community for 55 seasons; we hope that our audience at this concert will continue to celebrate with us the many reasons we love calling Bloomington our home.

Repertoire:

Overture from Merry Wives of Windsorby Otto Nicolai

Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso by Camille Saint-Saens

Catelijne Hunt, violin, 2024 BSO Youth Concerto Winner
