        "text": "Baritone Michael Volle stars as the caddish knight Falstaff, gleefully tormented by a trio of clever women who deliver his comeuppance, in Verdi’s glorious Shakespearean comedy. Maestro Daniele Rustioni takes the podium on April 1 to oversee a brilliant ensemble cast that features sopranos Hera Hyesang Park, Ailyn Pérez, and Jennifer Johnson Cano, mezzo-soprano Marie-Nicole Lemieux, tenor Bogdan Volkov, and baritone Christopher Maltman.\n\nThis live cinema transmission is part of the Met’s award-winning Live in HD series, bringing opera to movie theaters across the globe.\n\nEnglish StreamText captioning is available for the Met’s transmission of Falstaff here. A transcript of the transmission will also be available to view after the live performance.\n\nBuy tickets for Falstaff live in the opera house here.\n\nA co-production of the Metropolitan Opera; Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London; Teatro alla Scala, Milan; the Canadian Opera Company, Toronto; and Dutch National Opera, Amsterdam\n\nProduction gifts of the Betsy and Ed Cohen/Areté Foundation Fund for New Productions & Revivals and Harry and Misook Doolittle\n\nAdditional funding from The Gilbert S. Kahn & John J. Noffo Kahn Foundation and Mr. and Mrs. William R. Miller\n\nFalstaff marks a stylistic departure for Verdi and occupies a category of its own, without parallels in the history of the genre. The musical ideas come fast and abundantly, moving from one to the next organically and without discernible breaks. The orchestra carries the story and occasionally makes literal comments on the action. At other times, it represents the overall spirit of the proceedings, such as in the remarkable prelude to Act III, which contains all the sweeping crescendo of a Rossini overture in less than a minute."
