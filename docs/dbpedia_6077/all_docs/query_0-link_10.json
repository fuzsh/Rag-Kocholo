        "text": "A generous serving of musical, visual and comic pleasures has been wrapped up in a 97-minute movie condensation of Otto Nicolai's \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" which opened yesterday at the Tower East Theater and also will be shown, on Wednesday and Thursday only, at 50 theaters in the metropolitan area. The 117-year-old opera may have undergone considerable restyling in its transfer from stage to screen, but the result is an eye-filling Technicolor film that gives the essence of Shakespeare's amusing plot and Nicolai's tuneful score without doing violence to either.Norman Foster, an American bass who works mostly in Europe, has done a remarkably good job in adapting the work for motion picture purposes and in assembling a cast of opera singers who could perform it without looking silly. They even look good in close-ups.Colette Boky, Mildred Miller and Lucia Popp, the leading ladies, are all attractive, and each has a distinctive, vibrant personality that projects on the screen. Miss Boky may well become the Brigitte Bardot of the opera world. The film has hardly begun before she is out of her clothes and into a wash-tub bath that involves pulchritudinous displays of a kind never seen on the opera stage. She can sing, too.Everybody sings well in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" and the sounds of their voices have been recorded splendidly, as has that of the accompanying Zagreb Symphony Orchestra.The best thing about the picture, though, is that after it has been going on for a few minutes it makes one forget that singing is being done at all. The play is the thing, and the fact that it is being sung rather than spoken becomes unimportant.There are indications, however, that George Tressler, the director, may have been apprehensive about the singing, especially at the beginning. There he has the cast and the camera moving about so relentlessly that the viewer longs for an instant of repose. So long as we are mentioning weaknesses, it may be in order to report that the picture does lurch from scene to scene on occasion.Nevertheless, it is on the whole quite enjoyable. Mr. Foster is excellent as the vain Falstaff, Igor Gorin is convincing as the jealous husband, and the lesser cast members, including the unobtrusive chorus, are well integrated into the production.For some reason, Rosella Hightower was put to dancing the overture while the credits are shown. She is presented as a court page in white attire (which is totally unrelated to the rusticity of the picture itself) and ends her dance with bravura turns usually done by male ballet dancers. This is irrelevant to the film and unflattering to Miss Hightower.\n\nThe CastTHE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, an opera by Otto Nicolai based on the Shakespeare play. Screenplay and English adaption of German libretto by Norman Foster; directed by George Tressler; produced by Mr. Foster. A Sigma III release.
