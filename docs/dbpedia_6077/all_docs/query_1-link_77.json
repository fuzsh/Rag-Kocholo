They are 3.5mil truncated eliptical, 2.3mil truncated conical, 2.8mil truncated conical, 3.3mil truncated conical. These were recorded flat and then also equalized with Turnover: 500.0.\n\nThe preferred versions suggested by an audio engineer at George Blood, L.P. have been copied to have the more friendly filenames."
