        "text": "Next Article\n\nearly 20s was living in Rome as a composer in the Prussian Embassy there, writing lyric dramas in the bel canto style familiar to us from Bellini, and becoming rather famous in due course – certainly as well known as the young Verdi, for example – as both composer and conductor. His conducting took him to Vienna, where he became music director of the opera, and was instrumental in founding the Vienna Philharmonic.\n\nFirst Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFull opera: Berlin, 9 March 1849\n\nDURATION Overture: 8 minutes\n\nThe history of music is full of what-ifs, the result of tragedies more or less familiar. Everyone knows about Mozart, Schubert, Chopin, Donizetti dying long before their time, and we wonder (longingly but rather uselessly, to be sure) what might have been. One man who really ought to be on that list is Otto Nicolai, now really remembered only for his ‘comic-fantastic’ opera based on Shakespeare’s Falstaff, premiered in 1849 a couple of months before his death following a stroke at the age of 38.\n\nOne odd thing about Nicolai was that this thoroughly Prussian gentleman was best known in his life as a composer of Italian operas: Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor (The Merry Wives of Windsor) was actually his only German one. He had run away from an unhappy home at the age of 16, and by his\n\nThe Merry Wives is performed too rarely outside Germany but its Overture, familiar as a concert piece, gives a good idea of how Nicolai (who idolised Mozart) blended German schooling with Italian facility, and its grace, generosity, ebullience and lyricism reminds us of the astonishing wealth of European music at this time, with its echoes of Weber, Mendelssohn and many others.\n\nThe Overture is made up of themes from the opera, beginning with moonrise over Windsor Great Park, the opera’s final scene, where Falstaff (dressed as Herne the Hunter) is tormented in the dark by children and townsfolk whom he takes for sprites and fairies – explaining the gossamer-breathed fast passages that recall Mendelssohn’s overture to A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Next comes the merry swaying tune of the merriest wife, Mistress Page, followed by a plunge into the minor for Falstaff’s own theme, galumphing along but not without a certain full-bodied grace of its own. Nicolai weaves the themes together to build up to the Overture’s climax, a boisterous, rushing coda that raises the curtain on a hugely likeable and warm-hearted opera.\n\n© Robert Thicknesse\n\nCraig Armstrong (Born 1959)\n\nBALCONY SCENE from Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet\n\nScotch Snaps Scotch Snaps\n\nThe Balcony Scene was written while I was working with the director Baz Luhrmann on his version of William Shakespeare’s Romeo + Juliet. This was my first time collaborating with Baz; it’s been a very creative partnership since then, including scores for Moulin Rouge! (2001) and The Great Gatsby (2013).\n\nWe worked together on the Romeo and Juliet score at George Lucas’ Skywalker Ranch near San Francisco and spent time working in detail on what became the Balcony Scene. When we recorded it in London in 1995, we had a very large string orchestra of 60 musicians but I asked the orchestra to play very, very softly to create the shimmering effect you hear on the recording.\n\nFILM PREMIERE\n\nLos Angeles, 27 October 1996\n\nDURATION Balcony Scene: 5 minutes\n\n© Craig Armstrong\n\nSlow Movement for String Orchestra\n\nFIRST PERFORMANCE 1994\n\nDURATION 20 minutes"
