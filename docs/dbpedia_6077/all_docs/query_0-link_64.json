        "text": "ABOUT THE EVENT\n\nMichael J. Votta, JR., music director\n\nExperience an evening of stories sonically told by the UMD Wind Orchestra! Björk’s Overture to “Dancer in the Dark,” arranged by Vince Mendoza, chronicles the story of Selma Jezkova, a Czech immigrant to the United States who is going blind due to illness. Michael Gilbertson’s Lands End takes listeners to the windy, wooded cliffs of Lands End overlook, a shoreline in San Francisco peppered with shipwrecks and ruins, while Michael Daugherty recalls the life and legacy of an American track and field hero in The Adventures of Jesse Owens.\n\nThis performance will also feature a newly commissioned piece by Patrick Harlin entitled The Time Traveler. Inspired by his interdisciplinary research in soundscape ecology, Harlin composes works that draw parallels between the sounds of the natural world and those of the concert hall.\n\nPROGRAM\n\nBjörk: Overture to “Dancer in the Dark”\n\nMichael Gilbertson: Lands End\n\nMichael Daugherty: The Adventures of Jesse Owens (2022)\n\nRichard Arnell: My Lady Greensleeves\n\nPatrick Harlin: The Time Traveler\n\nABOUT THE UMD WIND ORCHESTRA"
