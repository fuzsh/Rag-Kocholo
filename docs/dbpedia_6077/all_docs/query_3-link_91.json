        "text": "PSF: Past to Present\n\nAs we close out the last weeks of what would have been our summer season, we think of PSF’s stellar family of artists and administrators, past and present, who make magic at the Festival each year. We are heartbroken to see so many still unable to use their gifts in our current circumstances, but we cling to the hope of a future, hopefully soon, when we can once again create and craft unforgettable experiences together in our theatres.\n\nPSF: Past to Present\n\nIn the Festival’s early years, PSF’s Young Company acting interns performed The Green Show nightly on the lawn in front of the Labuda Center. A mix of music, comedy, and Elizabethan era entertainment, The Green Show was free for all to enjoy an hour before the evening performances began. The atmosphere of enjoying music and perhaps a picnic On the Green began what patrons can still see today, as many theatre-goers enjoy outdoor treats before an evening in the theatre.\n\nPSF: Past to Present\n\nFor every summer season, PSF’s staff transforms to welcome up to 250 additional artists and staff members who work together to make the Festival happen in just a few short weeks. Just as crucial to achieving that great feat are the hundreds of Guild volunteers who work as ushers, front-of-house, hospitality, and administration to assist in the Festival’s great success. For decades, these volunteers have been the heart of the Festival and their mighty efforts make the Festival what it is today.\n\nPSF: Past to Present\n\nA normal PSF season is made possible by the heroic efforts of our technical crews and backstage artisans. What audiences see on PSF stages is a result of long work days and the collaboration of many hands. A predominant joy of recent seasons is watching our crews change over the Main Stage between our repertory productions, creating true magic behind the scenes that our patrons rarely see. Visit our YouTube channel to revisit our many changeover timelapse videos that highlight this incredible work.\n\nPSF: Past to Present\n\nIn 2011, PSF began the tradition of “Extreme Shakespeare” productions, rehearsed akin to the way Shakespeare’s company would have—actors arrive with their lines learned, rehearse on their own, wear what they can find, no director or designers, and open in a matter of days. The practice not only requires brilliant actor ingenuity, but allows audiences to experience some of Shakespeare’s less-produced works in an exciting and inventive atmosphere.\n\n(Pictured: Brandon J. Pierce and Mairin Lee in the 2017 Extreme Shakespeare production of Troilus and Cressida, photo by Lee A. Butz.)\n\nPSF: Past to Present\n\nWe share a meaningful memory from Tina Slak, PSF’s Director of Marketing and PR: “I’ll never forget watching Phoenix Best take the stage as the understudy for Éponine in our 2015 production of Les Misérables. Although she was just a student at that time, Phoenix was full of grace, talent, and professionalism. Her performance was especially meaningful after watching her grow up as a DeSales student, a PSF work study, and a Young Company member. It was no surprise to anyone who was there that night that just a few months later Phoenix launched her Broadway career in The Color Purple. Now a seasoned professional, she continues to grace the stage on Broadway and beyond.”\n\nPSF: Past to Present\n\nIn 2000, PSF introduced The Linny Fowler WillPower Tour, bringing Shakespeare productions and other resources directly to students and teachers. The inaugural tour of Romeo and Juliet reached 7,500 students in the Tri-State area. Decades later, the tour’s impact has grown exponentially, reaching 10,000-15,000 students each fall, in recent years. This 2017 production of Romeo and Juliet was one of the tour’s popular hits with students and celebrates the growth PSF’s cornerstone educational programming.\n\nPSF: Past to Present\n\nIn 1992, Fr. Gerard J. Schubert introduced the first season of Pennsylvania Shakespeare Festival. The inaugural season included productions of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew and Romeo and Juliet. See if you can find any familiar PSF faces in this photo from The Taming of the Shrew."
