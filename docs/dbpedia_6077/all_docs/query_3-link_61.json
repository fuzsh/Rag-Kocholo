        "text": "@agitato said:\n\nIts been a long time since I visited the forum.\n\nThought of sharing this article: https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/the-ugly-truth-of-how-movie-scores-are-made\n\nIt seems that even the mundane and repetitive movie scores these days are not composed by the official composer whos name is on the screen but rather done by 'minion' composers who get paid next to nothing and have no recognition. So maybe that redeems Zimmer in a way.... he didnt compose the scores attributed to him after all!!\n\nWhat a travesty. And how much angrier this now makes me whenever I hear statements like 'Interstellar is one of the best movie soundtracks ever'!\n\nCheers\n\n@Errikos said:\n\nWell, well, well... What have we here?... Are the poor, puny, giftless, inept Hollywood 'ghost'-composers complaining about their short-change?... What did you think was going to happen after decades of dumbing film-music down to your level?... How do you think you got these ghost-jobs in the first place?\n\n[From the article: For many young composers, it’s what draws them to Hollywood as opposed to Carnegie Hall.]\n\nYeah, right, sure... Carnegie Hall is actually closing down for lack of new drone-music from the Hollywood spiccato elite...\n\nLike ANY of these people were ever going to see the inside of Carnegie Hall unless they held tickets...\n\nWho asked you to idolise Hans!? Who asked you to compose like Hans!? Who asked you to compose for Hans!? You are all musically illiterate HZ-clones, and you demand to get paid for your clone-work more than an upfront fee!?!? You don't deserve it. You never deserved scoring a film in the first place. I have been SCREAMING on this forum regarding the precipitous nose dive of music quality in Hollywood for almost two decades now, but I was deemed a reactionary recalcitrant (am probably still considered one...) Of course I didn't know what I was saying. I was just jealous...\n\nContrarily, I was one of the first to poing out that people with no compositional chops (i.e. unable to function without a computer) were entering the industry by the ork-thousands due to the availability of \"\"\"\"inspiration\"\"\"\" software and concomitant patches (i.e. index finger sequencers and orchestras) and would ruin it for everybody. Finally, they ruined it for themselves. Bottom line? They are either Hans' that are getting paid $millions for crap and they need assistants for they are useless themselves, or nobodies (absolute nothings) that are getting paid chicken-feed to complete HZ-like cues.\n\nI never thought I would be the one to say this, but Hans is RIGHT! All these artistic nothings are getting paid to compose in Hans' style that he alone developed and, although I consider it execrable, I give him sole credit for his awful sounds and scoring choices. Why should they get paid above nominal or given credit? Credit for what? BRRRAAAAAM? We are talking serious film-music here with serious money, and BRRRAAAAAM!??? As in Herrmann's BRRRAAAAAM, or Williams' BRRRAAAAAM, Korngold's BRRRAAAAAM, Morriconne's BRRRAAAAAM, Barry's BRRRAAAAAM?...\n\nBRRRAAAAAMBRRRAAAAAMBRRRAAAAAMBRRRAAAAAMBRRRAAAAAMBRRRAAAAAMBRRRAAAAAMBRRRAAAAAM!!!!\n\nYeah. Clearly Ravel and Stravinsky inspired technique there. Intelligent discussion about musical art and some other serious issues...\n\nYou all danced with the Zevil and sucked deep on his flaming butt! I hope you get nowhere, I hope you don't see a penny, I hope you quit film-music and 'ghost'-composing (as if you could come up with your own identifiable stuff...), and serve me Big Macs as you should have done in the first place!!\n\nJustice at long last!!!!\n\nMaybe then - just maybe (no high hopes) film-music might somehow re-invent itself.\n\nIt is very high time it did."
