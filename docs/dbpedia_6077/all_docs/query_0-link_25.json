        "text": "This performance is currently sold out. Join the waitlist to be notified should additional tickets become available.\n\nCurtis Opera Theatre presents a double bill featuring Francis Poulenc’s outrageously funny farce, Les Mamelles de Tirésias, alongside Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s darkly satirical “ballet chanté,” The Seven Deadly Sins, at the Philadelphia Film Center.\n\nGender norms explode in Les Mamelles de Tirésias (The Breasts of Tiresias), Poulenc’s surreal opéra bouffe. Thérèse, a bored housewife, grows weary of her daily routine and suddenly becomes the male General Tirésias when her breasts turn into balloons and float away. As they lead a new life fighting distant wars on foreign battlefields, their stay-at-home husband discovers a way to make babies on his own—but not just one: 40,049 of them. This clever comedy features a delightfully fizzy cocktail of opera, cabaret, and jazz, with a tale as consciously arty, feminist, and political as it is insightfully witty.\n\nLes Mamelles de Tirésias is sung in French with English supertitles.\n\nFrancis Poulenc, music and libretto\n\nA biting critique of industrial capitalism, Weill’s The Seven Deadly Sins follows the perils of a woman sent away by her exploitative family to earn enough money to buy a house on the Mississippi River. In this sung ballet of split personalities, a singer (Anna I) and a dancer (Anna II) face down the seven deadly sins, each testing her wavering moral compass at every turn. This sardonic tale of sacrifice draws on the classic pop song and dance numbers of the 1920s and ’30s, blended with that quintessential Weill sound and a timeless commentary on values, virtues, and the “almighty dollar.”\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins is sung in German with English supertitles.\n\nKurt Weill, music\n\nBertolt Brecht, libretto\n\nThis concert runs approximately 2 hours, including one intermission."
