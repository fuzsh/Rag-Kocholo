He made his public debut in his hometown when he was twelve, playing a Mozart piano concerto.\n\nIn 2001 Bozhanov went to study in Germany. His international career started after he won prizes at several competitions, including the Sviatoslav Richter in Moscow, the Queen Elisabeth in Brussels and the Van Cliburn in Fort Worth, Texas. Although he was one of the clear audience favourites at the Chopin International Piano Competition in Warsaw in October 2010, he was not awarded the top prize, which led to a controversial debate in the Polish press and spontaneous invitations from the major Polish concert promoters and orchestras. In summer 2011, he was invited to open the 7th International Chopin Festival in Warsaw with Chopin’s 1st Piano Concerto and a recital.\n\nIn 2010/11, Evgeni Bozhanov appeared in Brussels and toured Japan playing Beethoven’s Third Concerto and Chopin’s First.

He toured Japan with the Deutsche Sinfonie Orchester Berlin and Yutaka Sado followed by a solo tour that culminated with a recital at the Suntory Hall.

He had his Spanish debut at the Chopin Festival in Valldemossa and at the Schubertiade in Vilabertran, and returned to the Bad Kissingen Festival.\n\nIn the season 12/13, he plays at the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon, Oporto, with the Orchestra del Maggio Musicale in Florence, Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano, Orchestra della RAI Torino as well as in Milano (Serate Musicali), Munich, Essen and Düsseldorf.\n\nAbout the Houston Symphony\n\nDuring the 2017-18 season, the Houston Symphony celebrates its fourth season with Music Director Andrés Orozco- Estrada and continues its second century as one of America’s leading orchestras with a full complement of concert, community, education, touring and recording activities. The Houston Symphony, one of the oldest performing arts organizations in Texas, held its inaugural performance at The Majestic Theater in downtown Houston June 21, 1913. Today, with an annual operating budget of $33.9 million, the full-time ensemble of 88 professional musicians presents nearly 170 concerts annually, making it the largest performing arts organization in Houston. Additionally, musicians of the orchestra and the Symphony’s four Community-Embedded Musicians offer over 900 community-based performances each year, reaching thousands of people in Greater Houston.\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning Houston Symphony has recorded under various prestigious labels, including Naxos, Koch International Classics, Telarc, RCA Red Seal, Virgin Classics and, most recently, Dutch recording label Pentatone. In 2017, the Houston Symphony was awarded an ECHO Klassik award for the live recording of Alban Berg’s Wozzeck under the direction of former Music Director Hans Graf.
