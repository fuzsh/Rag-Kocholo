        "text": "THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR\n\nRoyal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, Thursday 13th June 2024\n\nUnusual among Shakespeare’s plays, this comedy does not concern itself with the ruling class. The characters are ‘ordinary’ albeit middle-class figures, by and large, with only the knighted John Falstaff representing the upper echelons – and he is lampooned and ill-treated with aplomb. Is Shakespeare commenting on the rise of the self-made, and the tottering of the ancient regime? Possibly, but probably not.\n\nI prefer to see the play as an antidote to The Taming of the Shrew, a play that always gets the hackles up, with its perceived treatment of women. Here though, it is the women who have the upper hand in all things. The men, for all their scheming, come off second best. But I believe the piece goes beyond tit-for-tat sexual politics.\n\nThere is a rule of comedy that there are two types of people: those who seek to enjoy life and those who seek to prevent them, the latter being ripe for fooling.\n\nBlanche McIntyre’s production is not short on laughs. Along with the physical business she has her cast go through, the performances bring out the humour of one of Shakespeare’s funniest scripts. There are some zingers here, and it’s a shame not all of the performers have the timing or the inflection to capitalise on them. For example, Pistol’s line, “Then did sun on dunghill shine,” is what the kids would call a ‘sick burn’, but Omar Bynon throws it away. Some of the cast are too naturalistic to manage the heightened delivery that comedy requires.\n\nThankfully, the main players are in top form. John Hodgkinson’s Falstaff begins as a blue-suited Tory-like figure, the material straining against the belly born of his indulgences. He is rapidly mocked and besmirched, his suit covered in filth, before his humiliation in disguise as a ‘fat woman’ and roundly beaten and pinched – all because he is driven by his appetites. Hodgkinson achieves god tier by downing two pints of beer in quick succession. This is theatre!\n\nAs the merry wives, Samantha Spiro (Mistress Page) and Siubhan Harrison (Mistress Ford) are tremendous fun, as they plot to humiliate Falstaff at every turn. This is quite the double act; their enjoyment is infectious, and their scenes together are definite highlights. We get a real sense of their friendship.\n\nThe men, on the other hand, are a bunch of idiots. Patrick Walshe McBride is an absolute hoot as the socially inept Slender, using his height to, well, heighten the physical comedy, while delivering the lines with exquisite timing. A joy in every scene he plays. Ian Hughes’s Welsh clergyman is a pompous, language mangling twit, a knicker-nicking vicar. Jason Thorpe’s Doctor Caius is French, in the Inspector Clouseau/’Allo ‘Allo vein, leading to some hilarious linguistic fun. We don’t take Frank Ford’s (Richard Goulding) anguish seriously: we know his rampant jealousy is unfounded, but later, his repentance comes across as sincere. Men can be mended, the play seems to say.\n\nTara Tijani is sweet and lively as Ann Page, the target of unsuitable suitors, while John Leader warms into his role as a rather nerdy Fenton, her chosen one. Shazia Nicholls is splendid as go-between Mistress Quickly and there is strong support from Emily Houghton, sporting a blue Mohawk as the Host of the Garter. Of the lesser roles, Jessica Alade and Tadeo Martinez stand out as servants to Slender and Sir John respectively, with Martinez being especially effective in a largely wordless part.\n\nThe contemporary setting of mock-Tudor detached houses and beer gardens gives the production an old-fashioned sit-com feel. Much of British humour can be traced back to this anomaly among Shakespeare’s comedies. You can easily imagine Terry and June rocking up onto set and fitting right in.\n\nThe action goes beyond a battle of the sexes. Those who seek to curb the enjoyment of others must be mocked and thwarted. And so, even the merry wives, who each prefer a different unsuitable suitor for young Ann, must be foiled and made to see reason.\n\nThere is much to enjoy and to savour in this hilarious production. After a patchy first half, the second half in particular is eye-wateringly, relentlessly funny, with everyone going at full pelt.\n\nThe show presents us with a version of England that has only existed in stage farces and TV sitcoms, where you can make fun of foreigners with impunity, where gender roles are clearly defined and transgressors of these are to be mocked. The diversity of the performers suggests that that kind of world is out-of-date and not to be desired. This version of Windsor is a fantasy land and not a design for life!\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nBelly laughs! Samantha Spiro and John Hodgkinson (Photo: Manuel Harlan)\n\nTHE WIZARD OF OZ\n\nBirmingham Hippodrome, Wednesday 12th June 2024\n\nThe much beloved film version of L Frank Baum’s classic novel has so many elements that have entered the public consciousness, any stage version had better proceed with caution.\n\nThis revamp doesn’t seek to copy the movie, and this proves a wise move. The setting is brought forward from the time of the novel to the time when the film came out: 1930s dustbowl America. We don’t get a black-and-white opening, but what we do get are sweeping aerial shots of the Kansas landscape, projected on the curtain during the overture. Throughout the rest of the show, video projection is used artfully, principally on the cyclorama but also on other scenic elements: the cyclone scene, for example, becomes an all-encompassing cascade of visuals. When the projections work at their best is when they tie in with practical scenery and the actions of the cast.\n\nSo, it’s an extremely effective show in terms of visuals and – I have to say it – in terms of everything else. Production values are higher than Dorothy’s house in the storm.\n\nDorothy herself is brought to life by the remarkable Aviva Tulley. Her version of Over The Rainbow, near the top of the show, is stunning. It’s the best song in the piece and Tulley makes it entirely her own. She brings the house down, you might say…\n\nHeadlining is Craig Revel Horwood as the Wicked Witch of the West, but this is not just a case of stunt casting. Horwood, as the nasty Ms Gulch, quickly establishes himself as a fine character actor. Later, his Witch is a glamorous, camp creation, gravelly voiced (where the film’s version was famously squawky). Horwood keeps to the right side of pantomime villain. Even the odd nods to his celebrity (a ‘Sev-ennn!’ and a ‘Fab-u-lous!’) don’t quite break the fourth wall. He can carry a tune too, and of course, the moves go without saying. A star turn.\n\nThe other name on the poster is JLS’s Aston Merrygold, appearing as the Tin Man. Because the production design is all dystopian Americana, he is more robotic than usual. Cue some excellent moves, although he doesn’t get a real opportunity to show off his vocal talents.\n\nThe structure of the plot means the Tin Man is overshadowed by the Scarecrow – here a saucy, camp cowboy in the form of the beautiful Benjamin Yates. Yates, an excellent song-and-dance man, turns out to be something of a scene-stealer – until the Cowardly Lion shows up, a toweringly larger-than-life performance by Nic Greenshields, more of a cuddly Wookiee than a lion. Yates and Greenshields provide most of the comedy, fast becoming audience favourites (or mine, at least!).\n\nSpecial mention must be made of Abigail Matthews who operates the Toto puppet, rounding out the character in its own right. Magically, Matthews seems to disappear and we only watch the dog.\n\nThere is strong support from Emily Bull as a motorcycle riding Glinda and Aunt Em, David Burrows as Uncle Henry, and Allan Stewart as Professor Marvel and the eponymous Wizard.\n\nThere are additional songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, and while Rice’s lyrics are recognisably clever and Lloyd Webber’s musical phrasings are suitably dramatic, these new numbers can’t match the sheer unadulterated charms of Harold Arlen and E Y Harburg’s original score.\n\nThe well-known story, the much loved characters, and the famous lines of dialogue, are all present and correct in this vibrant production that makes the material seem absolutely fresh.\n\nMagical.\n\nScarecrow, I’ll miss you most of all.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nStraw blimey! Benjamin Yates shows us what he’s made of\n\nPhoto: Marc Brenner\n\nCONSENT\n\nCrescent Theatre, Birmingham, Saturday 8th June 2024\n\nFirst produced at the National Theatre in 2017, Nina Raine’s contemporary drama is still as sharp and as pertinent, but let’s face it, seven years is not long enough for human behaviour to evolve!\n\nWe are presented with a case of rape through the eyes of the barristers who are conducting the trial. Even barristers have home lives, who knew? We meet them during a drinks party. It’s a somewhat airified atmosphere, as these educated, high-achievers, through the medium of urbane wit, show how like everyone else they are with talk about giving birth, moving in, and so on. But then their work enters the chat. Speaking in the first person, they claim they’ve been doing rape all week, or murder, taking the alleged crimes of their clients as their own. It’s darkly funny, and I suppose being a barrister is one of those jobs where you need some kind of gallows humour in order to cope with the horrors you encounter.\n\nThe domestic rows are interspersed with testimony from rape victim Gayle (Katie Merriman) whose treatment at the hands of the legal system is shocking. The accused is protected but the victim’s past is fair game. Merriman is compelling and utterly convincing in her delivery of a harrowing ordeal.\n\nBarrister Tim (Mark Payne) combines professional detachment with personal awkwardness, sparring with the more cynical Ed (Scott Westwood) with whose wife he is suspected of having an affair… Matters come to a head between Ed and Katy (Grace Cheatle) who accuses her husband of behaving like a barrister in their private life. Meanwhile, Jake and Rachel (James David Knapp and Perdita Lawton) go through their own rocky patch when Jake’s infidelities are brought to light.\n\nThe play covers a lot of ground in terms of social commentary and making the point of the political is personal, when the notion of consent is brought into an explosive row between Katy and Ed… It’s also fascinating to hear about the courtroom techniques that barristers use to shape and coerce witness statements. There is also consideration of the common ground shared between actors and barristers when Zara (Steph Urquhart) recruits Tim and Ed to help her research for an audition to play a barrister on the telly.\n\nAcross the board, the acting is excellent. Everyone involved is at the height of their powers and, directed by the assured hand of Andrew Cowie, the material is handled perfectly. The tone in each scene is spot on, with nuanced naturalistic performances making the characters’ most grandstanding moments totally believable. The sparse setting – a bare floor, a set of white chairs – highlights the actors, who sit at the side of the performance space when not in a scene. Somehow, the stylisation accentuates the credibility of the piece. We paint the scene in our imaginations, picturing the furniture just as easily as poor Gayle’s ordeal.\n\nThe subject matter might seem heavy going but there is a rich vein of humour that makes the contentious topic palatable. We are able to think about the issues raised while we are impacted by the intense emotions of the performances.\n\nIt all makes for a perfect, provocative night at the theatre, as yet again the Crescent Theatre delivers the best drama currently available in Birmingham. .\n\nFlawless.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nThe party’s over.

What ensues is a lot of running around, a lot of costume changes and non-stop fun. The script offers plenty of opportunities for ad libs and for topical references (which are razor sharp).\n\nThe whole morass is delivered by just three performers. John-Robert Partridge, Joshua Chandos, and George Ormerod. Partridge, company director and leading man is a dependable talent for drama and for comedy, but he’s never been sillier than he is here. Having handed over the director’s reins to Ash Bayliss and assistant director Andrew Woolley, Partridge is let loose to deliver his daftest performance yet. Chandos makes further progress in cementing his reputation as the funniest actor in Stratford with a range of quickfire characters, augmented by some impressive vocal impersonations: Sean Connery as Macbeth, for example. Ormerod matches the other two in terms of energy and silliness, with some excellent accent work and (spoiler) a moment during a frantic Hamlet that surprises us with its emotional impact and reminds us there is more to these actors than rushing around and dressing up.\n\nIf you know the plays, you’ll probably laugh more than someone who doesn’t, but you don’t have to be a Shakespeare expert to derive a lot of pleasure from the comedy, some of which involves backstage squabbles between the cast members, and there are those topical references I mentioned. Titus Andronicus as a Nigella-style cooking show is a particular highlight, and the reduced version of Macbeth is where the silliness reaches its apogee.\n\nThe comedies all being reduced to one story illustrates the point that they’re all rip-offs of each other, but it’s the weakest part of the show. We are denied, for example, having The Merchant of Venice as a game show or Much Ado as Love Island. All to keep the running time down, of course. Reducing all the histories to a slow-motion rugby match, on the other hand, works brilliantly.\n\nThe second half is almost entirely devoted to Hamlet, with Chandos giving us a ridiculous Olivier-style delivery, Ormerod at his most wild-eyed, and Partridge’s inexplicably Brummie Horatio bringing delight. Audience members are involved, in a satire of the kind of pretentious ‘exploration’ work directors put actors through – so be prepared to wave your arms about and/or repeat lines at the top of your voice, to add to the atmosphere.\n\nThe sheer exuberance of the performers goes a long way to masking the patchiness of the material, guaranteeing that the laughs come thick and fast. The comic business that goes along with Will’s well-worn words is breathtakingly funny, and the overall pacing sweeps us along, making an irresistible, hugely enjoyable event.\n\nWorth seeing for the wigs alone!\n\nAnd the puppets.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nThe puppet show’s the thing!

Presenter Danny Robins emerges from a glitchy video backdrop of a spooky forest, sporting his trademark red anorak. He’s a lively, friendly figure, our guide into the unknown.\n\n“Who believes in ghosts?” he asks for a show of hands early on. I don’t do a head count, but I suspect the self-selecting audience holds a majority of believers.\n\nTwo experts join Robins on stage: psychologist Ciaran O’Keeffe and parapsychologist Evelyn Hollow. The pair offer possible explanations for the weird phenomena experienced by the (on video) witnesses to a couple of hauntings. O’Keefe is the sceptic, suggesting infrasound from a nearby railway station and sleep paralysis. Hollow largely pokes holes in O’Keeffe’s ideas, relating how closely or not the witness accounts align with ‘accepted’ categorisations of, say, poltergeist activity. It’s a game of one-upmanship with O’Keefe conceding ground more often than not.\n\nRobins solicits views and opinions from audience members, bounding up and down the aisles with the energy and haircut of a younger man. It is Robins’s enthusiastic delivery that keeps us hooked. He re-enacts key moments from the witnesses’ stories, making use of a freestanding doorway and a minimal number of props.\n\nDirector Sam Hodges does the utmost to keep us on edge. Unsettling music quietly plays in the background. Wisps of dry ice continually cloud the set: four tall, barren tree trunks bearing the show’s title in rope lights which fizzle on and off to punctuate the action. It’s all extremely effective. Rapid plunges into blackouts enable things to change position and for people to leave the stage.\n\nNaturally, the presentation is skewed towards belief, with just enough seeds of doubt to keep us thinking, keep us questioning. If either side produced irrefutable proof one way or the other, the show would be over, just like if Tom managed to kill Jerry.\n\nHighly entertaining, provocative, and more than slightly disturbing, Uncanny: I Know What I Saw gives rise to more questions than it answers. Perhaps there are no answers. Perhaps some things will never be explained – but because science does not (currently) have an answer, that does not necessarily mean that supernatural forces must be at work.\n\nThat said, even the most entrenched sceptics can thrill at a good ghost story told well, and tonight certainly gives us that. There is even mention of ghostly presences in this very theatre, which sends a shiver down the old spinal column.\n\nChilling – and not in the relaxing sense!\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nTO MOVE IN TIME\n\nThe Door, Birmingham Rep, Thursday 24th May 2024\n\nDelivered by Tyrone Huggins, this monologue by an unnamed protagonist concerns everything he would do to make the world a better place if he had the power to move through time. It’s an interesting premise and one I’m sure we’ve all considered at some point, possibly in a pub after a few jars. If we haven’t, the piece invites us to do so.\n\nAt first, he’d go back and change little things, for example making sure a friend didn’t lose his wallet. Then he considers more life-changing scenarios: saving a child from being crushed by a tram. So far, so altruistic.\n\nThen he considers money-making ideas: going forward to learn the lottery numbers, to see how stocks pan out on the market… Before moving on to the mischief and mayhem he could create…\n\nBut he swiftly realises there’s a knock-on effect, how changing one small detail could impact on the world. The Butterfly Effect, it’s called. And so he realises he’ll have to have several versions of himself from the future, each going back and tweaking and fine-tuning… He ties himself up in knots. Making the world a better place could be a full-time job! And we go giddy trying to keep up with him.\n\nHuggins is effortlessly spellbinding in his oration. Gradually the character emerges: a nobody or indeed an Everyman. His thoughts are ones we all might have in that situation. There is humour, warmth, frustration. The hour passes quickly, Huggins moving us forward to the future!\n\nIt’s a powerful yet playful performance.\n\nThe piece is written and directed by Tim Etchells, and while it perhaps doesn’t offer anything we wouldn’t think of for ourselves in these speculations, surely that is the point. As humans we share a desire to make the world a better place – if not for everyone, then for ourselves at least! And it is from these kind of speculative fantasies that human advancement is born. The piece illustrates how the mind works to create possibilities. Unlike other animals, we can think in the conditional tense, the What-Ifs.\n\nAnd that’s what’s got us where we are today.\n\nFascinating.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nTyrone Huggins comes full circle.

Set in the late 1970s at a time when Britain was in a mess and there was a surge in right-wing violence and ideology (sounds famililar), this is the story of Karim, a dual-race Briton trying to make his way in the world.\n\nTold through the prism of Emma Rice’s theatrical bag of tricks, the story is told in irrepressible style. The piece reeks (and not just of the joss sticks burning pre-show, threatening to fuck up my sinuses) of nostalgia. It kicks off with a disco dance to the Bee Gees’ banger, Tragedy and immediately I’m in love.\n\nAs Karim, Dee Ahluwalia makes a charming narrator and an attractive protagonist, on stage throughout and carrying the show on his slender shoulders. It’s a charismatic performance, redolent with humour and warmth. Truly, a star turn. You can’t help falling for him.\n\nAhluwalia is supported by a fine ensemble of character actors: Ankur Bahl as Karim’s father Haroon performs some impressive yoga in his Y-fronts, before revealing himself to be a selfish, hypocritical figure. Simon Rivers’s Anwar is more melodramatic as Haroon’s lifelong friend who comes to a sticky end due to some sex toys… Raj Bajaj is an absolute sweetie as fish-out-of-water Changez, while Natasha Jayetileke’s Jamila is the forthright feminist, carrying the show’s political convictions while Karim waivers. Tommy Belshaw shows his versatility as pretentious director Shadwell and as Karim’s first love, Charlie. Ewan Wardrop is absolutely monstrous as dictatorial director and swinger Matthew Pyke, with Bettrys Jones giving a sympathetic performance as Karim’s mother, abandoned by her husband, and also an hilarious portrayal of Eleanor, an actor who extracts poetry from her vagina. But it is Rina Fatania who threatens to steal every scene in which she features, as Auntie Jeeta, as Pike’s cougarish wife, and as self-righteous actor Tracey.\n\nRice has a definite style, to be sure, but it never feels less than fresh. Scenes of sexual activity are augmented by judicious use of pieces of fruit to represent genitalia. And so the unstageable becomes stageable and is rendered hilarious. A banana-as-phallus is reminiscent of the dildos of Aristophanes’s day. There is nothing new under the sun, is there? And there’s a running joke of cast members running on and setting off party poppers to represent climax, which ceases before it becomes too old.\n\nThere are scenes of racist abuse and violence, anchoring the sex romp in unpleasant reality, but the focus in this retelling is on the humour. And it is a wildly funny show. There is a moment when everyone stops to listen to the icy tones of Thatcher, coming into power. Blood-curdling, because we know how that turned out.\n\nRachana Jadhav’s set design with its split levels, stairs and shutters serves for everywhere, but it’s Vicki Mortimer’s costumes that bring most of the period colour and detail. Etta Murfitt’s choreography engenders a party atmosphere; the show is ultimately a vibrant celebration of British diversity.\n\nExhilarating.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nKarim of the crop, Dee Ahluwalia\n\nPhoto by Steve Tanner (c) RSC\n\nCOME FROM AWAY\n\nBirmingham Hippodrome, Tuesday 21st May 2024\n\nThe hit musical arrives in Birmingham with a trail of five-star reviews and dazzling acclaim, so I am keen to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nThe story is based on true events. After the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, the USA closed its air space and so aeroplanes were diverted. It turns out that Newfoundland, off the Canadian coast, has a massive airport (it used to be a refuelling stop) and so dozens of the aircraft are sent there. The 7,000 passengers almost double the island’s population. The locals do their utmost to accommodate the new arrivals. Then, a few days later, clearance is given for the planes to fly away. Lives have been changed in the interim. Apparently.\n\nMy first surprise is how Oirish the people of Newfoundland sound! Is this Canada or Craggy Island? Father Ted could walk on at any second. This means all the music, played by an excellent on-stage band, has more than a touch of the diddly-diddly-dee to it. The music and lyrics are by Irene Sankoff and David Kein. It’s their first musical, and it shows. The songs are forgettable, even while they’re being sung, and given that most of them are performed chorally, it’s not long before I’m craving a solo number just to change the sound. Solos are few and far between, and are nothing to phone home about. And there’s a love duet about stopping the world that made me long for just that eventuality.\n\nThe hardworking cast try their damnedest to depict a selection of the 16,000 characters. This means we only see them in snippets. Rather than scenes we get vignettes and sketches that are more about the punchline than character development. At one point, the characters are reduced to telling actual jokes. We flit from storyline to storyline, and with little to differentiate between characters, it’s easy to confuse who an actor is being before the snippet is snipped.\n\nSome characters get more stage time than others. We meet Bonnie (Rosie Glossop) the only one to think about the animals in the holds of the planes and care for them. We meet Hannah (Bree Smith), a ‘come from away’ worried about her firefighter son who is missing since that fateful day. We meet a number of mayors, all played by Nicholas Proud, who at least changes his hat to distinguish them. We meet a gay couple, both called Kevin (Jamal Zulfiqar and Mark Dugdale) whose relationship comes under strain, even though they’ve wound up on the most gay friendly island ever, it seems. And we meet Ali (Jamal Zulfiqar again) who is singled out because he’s Middle Eastern and therefore not to be trusted. The blatant racism rears its ugly head but goes undeveloped and unresolved. And I don’t really buy that there’s not a single dissenting voice among the islanders at the influx of so many people. Perhaps in reality there was no opposition, but I feel we need one, for the sake of Drama.\n\nThe show is meant to remind us that there is good in humanity, especially at times of adversity. One glance at the news suggests otherwise. Perhaps the island is the last bastion of the milk of human kindness. Or perhaps like us, they have turned selfish and xenophobic, and have adopted a ‘stop the boats’ mentality, while turning a blind eye to genocide or even facilitating it.\n\nHowever well done it is – and it is staged in a lively manner, and performed well by a talented cast – it’s going to take more than this shallow and forgettable score to warm the cockles of this world-weary cynic.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆\n\nPlane to see. The cast of COME FROM AWAY (Photo: Craig Sugden)\n\nWITHNAIL AND I\n\nThe REP, Birmingham, Tuesday 14th May 2024\n\nBruce Robinson’s film from 1987, which he wrote and directed, quite rightfully became a cult classic, with its depiction of decadence and squalor at the end of the 1960s. Now, Robinson adapts his own screenplay for the stage, bringing to my mind two initial questions: Will the fans be satisfied? Will newcomers get it?\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to declare my undying (and unrequited) love and adoration of Robert Sheehan, one of the most exciting actors of his generation. Here he takes on the named title role, the part originally created by Richard E Grant. It’s a big coat to fill. Sheehan doesn’t even attempt to give us a Richard E Grant impersonation. What would be the point of that, other than to reduce the enterprise to play-acting? Sheehan adopts the plummy tones and his delivery of those famous lines of dialogue have his own rhythm and emphasis. Being on stage rather than on screen, the performance by necessity has to be larger. Sheehan’s Withnail struts and frets his hour upon the stage, throwing himself around with verve and gusto, posturing for the gods.\n\nThis heightened performance style permeates the whole show. The eccentric characters come across as crazier. The absurdity of their behaviour is amplified. Withnail and fellow out-of-work actor ‘I’ (named Marwood in the script but never in the dialogue) played by an excellent Adonis Siddique, share the grottiest of flats in Camden Town. All around them is being demolished, which is symbolic of the end of an era but also foreshadows the coming end of their association.\n\nThere is more of Beckett to their domestic scenes than The Odd Couple. Unlike Beckett’s Vladimir and Estragon, our pair of protagonists actually make a move to escape their situation by venturing to a holiday cottage in Penrith.\n\nSiddique is the most ‘normal’ one we encounter, addressing us with moments of poetic narration – even while he’s pissing in a pub urinal. Through I’s eyes we meet Withnail’s Uncle Monty (a marvellously camp Malcolm Sinclair) a hammy old poove with designs on his nephew’s attractive companion. There is spaced-out drug dealer and conspiracy theorist Danny (Adam Young) and an imposing but silent figure, Presuming Ed (Israel J Frederick) who makes a strong and hilarious impression in his brief appearance.\n\nFleshing out the company are Morgan Philpott, Matt Devitt, Adam Sopp, and Sooz Kempner, each playing a variety of roles and, crucially, forming the live band that plays hits from the period during scene transitions, with Kempner’s searing vocals a big hit of the night.\n\nDirector Sean Foley keeps the action flowing, not seamlessly but the music keeps us in the zone while various pieces of furniture glide on and off the stage. A swordfight is wonderfully overacted as the two friends demonstrate stage combat skills they must have acquired at drama school. There is a comedy cat and a comedy chicken. And when the iconic car, a Silver Wraith I believe, makes its first appearance, it elicits as warm a welcome to the stage as any of the characters. Monty’s presentation as a predatory homosexual is as outdated as smoking in pubs, but we laugh along, possibly because he’s so bad at it.\n\nYes, it’s an extremely funny show, played to the hilt by all and sundry. The film has been described as the funniest tragedy ever made, and the same description is true of the play. It is Withnail’s tragedy that he has wrecked his life with alcohol and substance abuse, born from the frustration of not being able to reach his potential. When (spoiler) I gets an acting job and leaves, Withnail, alone in the rain, recites “I have of late…” from Hamlet. Yes, he’s drunk, but even so, it’s a powerful and moving demonstration of talent gone to waste. So many talented people wind up the same way, and that’s the same today as it was in 1969 and 1987.\n\nFans of the film will be more than satisfied and newcomers will enjoy the elan of the histrionics on display. Bruce Robinson has enhanced what makes the film so enjoyable.\n\nAnd the candle I hold for Mr Sheehan burns on undimmed.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nRoad to ruin: Adonis Siddique and Robert Sheehan (Photo: Manuel Harlan)\n\nGYPSY\n\nCrescent Theatre, Birmingham, Sunday 12th May 2024\n\nThey’re an ambitious lot at the Crescent. I’ll say that in their favour from the off. Now they’re tackling this mammoth of a musical, which brings its own challenges: the many locations, the large cast of characters, and the musical numbers.\n\nOstensibly the origin story of burlesque star, Gypsy Rose Lee, it’s really the story of her mother, the formidable Rose, the epitome of pushy stage moms. Rose provides the backbone and the heart of the show, so you really need someone with irresistible stage presence for so colossal a role. This production is lucky to boast such a performer in the form of Kimberley Maynard, who encapsulates Rose’s skewed maternal instincts, her bossiness, her drive and her delusions. With vaudeville dying on its arse all around her, Rose insists on keeping her dream alive: making one of her daughters a star, while the other, neglected, performs as a boy backing dancer. She drags her exploited troupe across the States, seeking that one gig that will make daughter June a star.\n\nIn the first half, it’s Maynard’s energy that keeps things afloat. She is supported by a capable ensemble but, for some reason, the action seems undercooked. Perhaps it’s something that a couple more rehearsals might have ironed out.\n\nNot that we’re short of things to enjoy. Annabelle Hodgetts is spot on as Baby June. Pink, perky, precocious and patriotic, she squeaks and high kicks her way through a cringeworthy routine. The young boys singing and dancing also do a bang-up job. And the moment when time passes, via stroboscopic effect, is beautifully done, amping up the theatricality of the production.\n\nSlightly older actors take over the roles of Rose’s troupe, whom she continues to infantilise and forces them to perform the same tired routine. Here, more needs to be made of the awfulness of their act: the top hat falling off, the cane being dropped… So that when the characters perform numbers outside their routine, they don’t come off so pedestrian.\n\nEnergy levels pick up after the interval. The boys have quit and so Rose has a new gaggle of girls. Their rendition of the act, inexplicably Spanish-flavoured, is hilariously (intentionally) poor. The character of neglected daughter Louise comes to the fore after June (a marvellous Ava Bryan) quits – she can’t stay nine years old forever. As Louise, Joanne Brookes is marvellous, going from unconfident chorine to assured and assertive stripper – all in the best possible taste! Louise is the only character with a definable arc; Rose never changes, which is her tragic flaw. Other characters, including a likeable Paul Forrest as Herbie, their long-suffering agent, just have their fill of Rose and leave.\n\nThe girls wind up in a burlesque theatre, where they encounter three veteran strippers, Elektra (Bev Heynes), Mazeppa (Michael Redican), and Tessie Tura (Amanda Nickless). The trio perform a comic number about the various gimmicks they use to differentiate their acts. They’re game old birds, I’ll give them that!\n\nThe score (by Jule Styne) is beautifully played by a splendid band under the baton of Chris Arnold. The dramatic scenes in Arthur Laurents’s book are handled well; director Kevin Middleton is particularly strong with the more domestic scenes. While Dean James’s choreography is appropriate for the period and the genre, again there are moments where it seems undercooked. Rose, during the showstopper Everything’s Coming Up Roses, should either be given less or more to do. Maynard sells the number with emotive power but seems unsure where to put herself.\n\nOf course, this being The Crescent, the costume team have gone all out, and everyone looks fabulous, within context. The changes of locations are indicated by captions on TV screens flanking the pros arch. These are so subtle as to be unobtrusive, but perhaps a more theatrical, more period method could be used, like the manner in which distance is shown during the car journey: railway station signs wheeled across the stage or something, I don’t know, do I?\n\nFor me, it’s a treat to hear the music, and Stephen Sondheim’s marvellous lyrics. There are some stand-out performances but on the whole it’s like more has been bitten off than can be chewed.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆\n\nPaul Forrest, Kimberley Maynard, and Joanne Brookes (Photo: Graeme Braidwood)\n\nLOVE’S LABOUR’S LOST\n\nRoyal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, Thursday 25th April 2024\n\nThree men and a King pledge to devote the next three years of their lives to study, abstinence and celibacy. Of course, as soon as the oath is signed, along come four beauties on a diplomatic mission. Each of the men starts writing love notes and poems to one of the beauties, behind his confederates’ backs…\n\nOne of Shakespeare’s earliest comedies, it brims with elements he was to refine in later works: letters going astray, loves adopting disguise… Leading the cast is Luke Thompson as prototype Benedick, Berowne, leaving behind the country estates of Bridgerton in favour of a tropical resort hotel that wouldn’t look out of place in White Lotus. Thompson is very good, showing off the character’s wit and, if you can’t keep up, he takes his shirt off a couple of times to keep you interested. Believe me, I’m not complaining.\n\nAs his friends and pledge-mates, we have Eric Stroud as Longaville, Brandon Bassir as Dumaine, and Abiola Owokoniran as Ferdinand. There is little, textually, to differentiate these characters and so it’s all done by physical appearance: a skinny one, a short one, and so on. But at least Ferdinand can switch on a regal air when required, to show he’s not just one of the lads.\n\nSimilarly with the female four: it’s their physical appearance that distinguishes them. They are led by Melanie-Joyce Bermudez as the Princess (see above note about Ferdinand), Joanna Kimbook as Rosaline, Amy Griffiths as Katherine, and Sarita Gabony as Maria. Of course, the women outsmart the men at every turn to humorous effect, but most of the comedy comes from the exotic Don Armado (Jack Bardoe), a ridiculous figure with a ridiculous accent, and from Nathan Foad’s camp Costard. Tony Gardner adds pomposity and additional verbosity as the boorish Holofernes, and Jordan Metcalfe busies about as a somewhat nerdish Boyet.\n\nYes, it’s a very ‘witty’ play. Perhaps young Shakespeare was seeking to dazzle his contemporaries with his intricate word play, puns zinging like fireworks. Without Cliff’s Notes, it’s unlikely anyone will get all the puns and references, and so director Emily Burns imbues the production with oodles of physical comedy and comic business. It works: we laugh throughout, enjoying our time at this resort. The cast punctuate Will’s dialogue with present-day asides. Purists may bristle, but let them.\n\nThe Nine Worthies presentation, by Costard and other serving staff, is chaotic and hilarious. The heckling from the courtiers is ahead of the similar scene in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and I wonder it Shakespeare is not just parodying masque entertainment but also holding up the bad behaviour of his supposed betters in the audience.\n\nFamously, the play reaches its resolution with the arrival of a new character. Not a deus ex machina in this instance, but rather a spanner in the works. The couples’ courting is interrupted when the Princess receives sad news from home and has to plan her immediate return. This leads to speculation that there’s a sequel, Love’s Labour’s Won, but I don’t think there needs to be. I prefer to speculate that the fledgling playwright was seeking to subvert the genre. Rather than giving the happy rom-com ending we’d all expect, surprise! Guess what! Tragic occurrences can come along and upset your apple cart at any moment. This gives the piece depth. Or perhaps that’s just my take.\n\n(Unfortunately, during this matinee performance someone’s phone started ringing just as the sad news was announced. Well, that happens, and it’s usually no more than a few seconds of annoyance. But this culprit let it ring for at least five minutes, two rows in front of me so I couldn’t reach to strangle them. The ushers were too slow to pounce, and so the powerful, emotional ending was somewhat ruined for me. A surprise ending I didn’t see coming!)\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nView from the Bridgerton: Luke Thompson (shirt-on version)\n\nPhoto: Johan Persson (c) RSC\n\nART\n\nBear Pit Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, Wednesday 24th April 2024\n\nPrior to tonight, I had seen three professional productions of this play and loved each one. The pressure is well and truly on then for the Bear Pit company to match if not surpass the high bar set by the likes of the League of Gentlemen, Richard “JohnBoy” Thomas, and even Nigel Havers.\n\nFrench playwright Yasmina Raza’s masterpiece first appeared thirty years ago and still has the power to amuse and illuminate. Serge, one of three middle-aged friends spends €100,000 on a painting, a 4’ x 5’ canvas painted white. He shows it first to one friend (Marc) who derides it immediately, and then to Yvan, who sits on the fence.\n\nThe painting is a trigger for the flaws in the friendship. Niggles, peeves and objections all come out, as the men tear into each other, bickering, kvetching and hurling hurtful insults as only good friends can. Long held resentments cut deep.\n\nThe genius of Raza is that she gets the men bang to rights. Their inability to say what they feel, their attempts to intellectualise their emotional responses. It’s a wonderful piece of writing that is well served by Christopher Hampton’s masterly translation.\n\nAll three players are in excellent form. Christopher Dobson’s brittle, prissy and waspish Marc; Richard Sandle-Keynes’s excitable and conciliatory Yvan; and Roger Ganner’s sarcastic and reserved Serge. They all give as good as they get and each of them is at ease addressing the audience in sporadic asides.\n\nSandle-Keynes delivers a show stopping monologue, ranting about wedding invitations, that has to be heard to be believed. Ganner shows that despite Serge’s maturity and aesthetic outlook, he can be as petty and childish as the other two. Dobson has never been better than he is here.\n\nDirector Lynda Lewis navigates the dynamics of the trio, keeping the outbursts far from one-note, knowing when to keep things fast-paced and when to give the action time to breathe.\n\nIt’s a bitterly funny show with the odd moment that pricks your tear ducts. It’s simply presented on a mainly white set with black details (like the cushions on the sofa) but clearly, relationships are never black and white.\n\nIt’s also profound, not just in its depiction of male friendship, where actions work better than words, but also in its affirmation of modern art, which can be so self-referential the lay observer can find it inaccessible. “A man moves across a space and disappears,” Marc at last comes to understand the white canvas, the art of painting, and the human condition all at once.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nJESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR\n\nBirmingham Hippodrome, Monday 22nd April 2024\n\nThe partnership of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber created their best work together. Only their second work, Superstar is still rocking out over fifty years on. Controversial when it first appeared, the show deals with the last week of Jesus’s life, mostly from the point of view of Judas (perhaps the most wronged man in history!)\n\nThis current production, originating from the Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre, has come indoors, and I wonder if it’s a little cramped. Director Timothy Sheader stages the story as a rock concert, with the principal characters using handheld microphones, picked out by tightly focussed spotlights. It’s a sung-through musical, so why not? Well, it can detract from a sense of place, causing Rice’s lyrics to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to who is saying (singing) what to whom and where. It’s a good job the story is rather well known!\n\nThat said, the singing is utterly magnificent. Shem Omari James (Judas) has a voice that pierces and soars, powerfully and emotionally, giving the most impassioned performance of the night. Louise Francis’s Mary the sex worker gets all the sweetest melodies, but I find her phrasing a little too rubato at times. Other standouts are Jad Habchi whose wonderfully deep voice reminds us this is a rock opera, after all, and Matt Bateman’s Annas, the perfect foil for Habchi’s basso profundo. Ryan O’Donnell’s Pilate, Luke Street as Simon, and Timo Tatzber as Herod all get their moments to shine. Herod is the comic relief of the piece; Tatzber brings a sense of danger to this traditionally camp number.\n\nIn the title role, Ian McIntosh has an impressive range, even though Jesus isn’t as well-written as Judas. McIntosh delivers both status and humanity – the show emphasises Jesus’s human nature, regardless of any other attributes he may have possessed. Perhaps it’s just me but I prefer my Jesuses long-haired. This one is a bit too clean-cut.\n\nSome of the ideas work brilliantly: the ceremonial staffs of the Jewish priests flip around to become mic stands. A cross-shaped rostrum foreshadows Jesus’s fate but also represents a crossroads on which the characters stand. Events could have taken a different turn had other paths been chosen. A mic drop is emblematic of Judas’s suicide by hanging… Other ideas baffle: the merchants in the temple are carrying illuminated crucifixes for no apparent reason.\n\nDrew McOnie’s choreography brings 1970s moves up to date. The ensemble, more urban than hippie, are angsty and expressive – my one note is there’s perhaps too much of it. They dance and they dance and they dance, making for a very busy stage. We can have too much of a good thing. Perhaps there was more room for it outdoors.\n\nThere are moments when the juxtaposition of images and music can be jarring. Simon skips across the stage, singing about being terrorised. When Jesus receives forty lashes, glitter showers everywhere. Thus the violence is glamourised, which might be a comment on how Christians regard the suffering of their martyr – but I don’t want to dwell on such things here. The show is best enjoyed if you don’t regard it as a religious tract. It’s a story of how we build up individuals only to tear them down. We see it in celebrity culture all the time, how the mob (these days, usually on the internet) can turn against someone they once supported and venerated. Secular meaning is still meaning.\n\nWonderfully sung, with excellent musical accompaniment under the baton of musical director Michael Riley, this is a banquet for the ears, with the occasional treat for the eyes (a nod to Da Vinci’s Last Supper is remarkably realised). Come for the voices, come for the tunes, and you’ll have a great time, but be prepared for a sobering ending that is visually and emotionally powerful.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nForever tainted by silver, Judas regrets his actions. Shem Omari James is pure gold.\n\nBESØK AV GAMMEL DAME\n\nNationalTheatret, Oslo, Fredag 19 Avril 2024\n\nWhen the richest woman in the world returns to her home town to save it from economic ruin, there is more than philanthropy in play. Clara Zachanassian has a cheque book in her purse and a fistful of revenge where her heart should be. She will donate a humongous sum of money on the proviso that someone kills the childhood sweetheart who abandoned her to face pregnancy alone. The man in question is now a respected shopkeeper with a wife and grownup daughter. At first, the Mayor rejects the offer outright but before long everyone is buying things on credit and all of a sudden everyone is toting firearms…\n\nFriedrich Dürrenmatt’s 1950s play is translated from the original German by Øyvind Beg. The adaptation, directed by Sigrid Strøm Reibo, feels very much like an Emma Rice production (and that’s a big compliment, by the way) with its onstage musicians underscoring the action, the heightened playing, the stylisation — even the scaffolding seems familiar.\n\nThe music is superbly atmospheric. Composer Synnøve Gustavsen Ovrid also leads the band.\n\nIt’s a dark fable and, while entertaining, the style of presentation invites us to think about the quandary, the immoral dilemma at the heart of the story.\n\nAs Clara, Jan Sælid (yes, a man!) brings much more to the role than looking like Elon Musk in quick drag. Despite her physical frailties (among them two false legs and a prosthetic hand!) Sælid brings out her strength of character, her power and status, her faded beauty, her pride, her bitterness, her pain, and her cruelty. It’s a powerful performance that rightly dominates proceedings.\n\nClara arrives in town by rising from the orchestra pit and leaves by sinking back into it. The suggestion is she has come from Hell (not the Norwegian town) to bring this diabolical deal. I am reminded of the vengeful ghost from Don Giovanni come to collect his murderer.\n\nOla G Furuseth brings a voice of reason as the potential victim, Alfred, keeping his head while all around him are losing theirs. There is a touch of Peter Cushing to this silver fox. Silje Lundblad’s Mayor is a woman under pressure. Lundblad keeps the Mayor’s humanity to the fore but also demonstrates neat comedic stylings, for example at a press conference. Leo Magnus de la Nuez is a skilled physical comedian, making the sounds of and evoking the trains that go by, and later, with his trousers down.\n\nAlso good value are Trond Høvik as the doctor and Øystein Roger as the priest. Helene Naustdal Bergsholm goes positively deranged as the teacher. There are gasps in the auditorium when she gets her hands on a knife…\n\nThere are absurd elements too, not least the two blind eunuchs, Koby and Loby ( Lasse Lindtner and Eindride Eidsvold) In fact, everyone is in great form, singly and together. The action scenes and comic business are well handled but we never lose sight of the darkness at the heart of the situation. The action builds to a stark and sobering resolution — before a gaudy curtain call of glittering bad taste!\n\nIts an engaging and provocative piece, entertainingly presented. The inevitability of human fallibility mixed with the manipulation of the masses by a sociopathic billionaire is all too pertinent. That is our tragedy.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nCan’t buy me love: Jan Sælid sitting pretty as Clara Zachanassian (Photo: Erika Hebbert)\n\nBLUE BEARD\n\nThe REP, Birmingham, Wednesday 17thApril 2024\n\nEmma Rice is one of theatre’s most distinctive directors, with a style of her own she honed during her years with Kneehigh Theatre and now continues to apply to her work with new company Wise Children. All the hallmarks of an Emma Rice production are here: the live music underscoring the action, the use of archetypes, the humour, the original songs, the stylised physicality…\n\nIt’s the famous story of the new bride who can’t resist her blue-bearded husband’s forbidden room, in which she discovers the dismembered corpses of his former spouses. Rice concentrates on the women. We convene with some kind of religious order at the Convent of the Three Fs, where the women wear shapeless dresses, cover their heads with woolly beanies, and sport white-framed sunglasses. Their identities are concealed. They are any woman. They are every woman.\n\nA handsome young lad arrives, asking for help. The women set about him like Bacchae until Mother Superior intervenes. This fierce little woman narrates the main story, encouraging the boy to share his as a subplot. His story is of a big sister and a little brother. After a stilted start, he learns to mimic the Mother Superior’s mythic style of storytelling.\n\nIt’s a thoroughly absorbing piece: funny, surprising, horrifying and ultimately moving. The Emma Rice style enables the story to breathe, rather than suffocating it. Form and content are perfectly blended.\n\nAs Mother Superior, Katy Owen is a fiercely funny MC before the shows blistering final moments. Adam Mirsky is endearing as the Lost Brother, squabbling with Mirabelle Gremaud as his Lost Sister. Gremaud also appears as Blue Beard’s glamorous assistant, performing a most flexible display!\n\nIn the title role, Tristan Sturrock is debonair and flamboyant, commanding and seductive. Blue Beard is an accomplished stage magician and the volunteer he slices in half (Robyn Sinclair’s Lucky) becomes his latest wife/victim. Sinclair, along with Stephanie Hockley as sister Trouble, are a lot of fun, their movements punctuated by jazzy dance moves. Their mother, Treasure, a widow, is played with elegance and humour by Patrycja Kujawska – who also plays a mean violin. The cast augment the musicians when not in a scene, with Hockley’s featured number being a definite highlight in a show bristling with splendid songs.\n\nThe play covers a lot of ground: why are women attracted to bad men? And domestic abuse. And, crucially, why can’t women walk home alone? The bad men of our world aren’t debonair and dashing, with blue beards as red flags. They aren’t castled psychopaths amassing corpses. They wear ordinary clothes. They are opportunists and narcissists and they are not marked out by brightly coloured facial hair. They could be anyone.\n\nA great deal of fun, an absorbing piece of storytelling that delivers an emotional body blow and an all-too pertinent message, this is Emma Rice back on form. She makes us fall in love with theatre all over again.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nMirabelle Gremaud bending over backwards to please Tristan Sturrock.

Much is made of a comparison with the New York Yankees: the players may change, but there’ll only be one Yankees. This got me thinking about the old philosophical puzzle, the one about the ship of Theseus, every bit of which was replaced over the years, so is it still the same ship?…\n\nWith such a fast turnaround, there are too many members of the group to focus on their individual stories. Instead the show centres around Faye Treadwell, their manager, who narrates the story to her daughter, known only as ‘Girl’. I guess we’re not meant to get emotionally involved with her, nor, as it turns out, with anyone else.\n\nThe cast of six play all the characters: band members, executives, hotel and bar staff… With the band members, it’s hard to keep track of who’s whom. The smaller roles, like backing dancers, are depicted as crude stereotypes, which adds to the humour of the piece but reinforces the notion that women aren’t meant to be taken seriously.\n\nAs Faye Treadwell, Carly Mercedes Dyer is fierce and formidable from the get-go. You wouldn’t want to mess with her. Trouble is, she’s like that all the way through. In the acting parts, her performance is decidedly one note. Which can’t be said for the singing. What a voice! When widowed, Mrs Treadwell belts out a searing number. It’s incredible. But in a musical about a musical group, one wonders why the character with arguably the strongest voice isn’t a recording artist! It would make more sense within the world of the musical, if the performing was restricted to the band members.\n\nThe quartet who portray the Drifters contain multitudes. Daniel Haswell, Tarik Frimpong, Ashford Campbell, and Miles Anthony Daley populate the stage with a host of characters, and the singing is never short of impeccable. It’s also delightful to see them in their matching suits doing all the moves. Take That could never.\n\nWhat lets the piece down is the drama. Or rather the lack of it. Tension never really ignites. Each scene results in damp squib after damp squib.\n\n“Rudy, you’re late for rehearsal.”\n\n“Sorry, it won’t happen again.”\n\n“Oh, Rudy’s dead.”\n\nAnd\n\n“Oh no, we have to go to court.”\n\n“We won!”\n\nEvents are skipped over. We’re never sure what year it is. Even the racism faced by the group on both sides of the Atlantic, although cleverly presented, is shrugged off. The upshot is, despite some snappy dialogue, I don’t engage with the characters. I just want to hear the next song. Luckily, the hits keep coming.\n\nThe script only glances at issues that would put meat on the bones of the slender story. The racism. The chauvinism. The misogynoir – especially when only last week, some racist morons chucked their toys from their prams at the casting of a black woman as Juliet in an upcoming West End production.\n\nBeautiful singing, great songs, slick moves, and stylish presentation aren’t enough to keep my attention from drifting. They’d be better off ditching the script and becoming a tribute act.\n\n☆ ☆\n\nLOVE FROM A STRANGER\n\nCrescent Theatre, Birmingham, Saturday 13th April 2024\n\nWritten by Frank Vosper in 1936, based on a short story from 1924 by Agatha Christie, this is not so much a whodunit as a who’s-gonna-get-it, as the identity of the murderer is hinted at almost from the start. It’s the story of Cecily who, having won much more than a lucky dip on the lottery, finally believes she can have some independence at last. Which involves pleading with her fiancé Nigel for a postponement of their nuptials. Nigel won’t play ball and their relationship flounders. Along comes Bruce, tall, blond and handsome, to rent Cecily’s London flat, and it’s goodbye to Nigel and ‘I do’ to Bruce. The couple move to a remote country cottage and cracks begin to show… Is the whirlwind romance nothing more than a fling? What is Bruce hiding?\n\nDirector Rod Natkiel and voice coach Michael Barry have clearly worked hard to train the cast in RP. They all sound so teddibly posh, it’s like listening to a radio drama from the 30s. Together with Poppy Chalmers’s judicious choices of period furniture (most of it brown), the period is convincingly conjured.\n\nHelena Lima combines determination with vulnerability as heroine Cecily. Her slight stature and elegant manner conceal grit and backbone. Savannah Gallo is so good she could have time-travelled from the past to deliver her spot-on evocation of a post-flapper era young woman about town.\n\nAlex Morey-Wiseman warms into his role as charming chancer Bruce, his obviously dyed barnet and the vagaries of his action clues to Bruce’s true nature. Alexander Pendleton’s Nigel is an intense and volatile chap, so much so we begin to wonder if we’ve backed the wrong horse…\n\nThere is strong support from Kaitlyn Elward as rough-and-ready Ethel, the housemaid, and Crescent stalwart Brian Wilson as village doctor Gribble. The production also boasts a couple of jewels of character acting: Julie Lloyd’s snobby Auntie Loulou and Michael Barry’s Hodgson the gardener. These two add most of the comedy to the piece and maintain our enjoyment levels as the slow burning plot lays its clues and sows the seeds for the explosion of tension in its final act.\n\nAnd there’s the rub. It’s such a slow burner, a couple of times I think the fuse has gone out. It’s beautifully played and presented but the story is not meaty enough to fill the running time. Yes, Christie surprises us with plot twists, revealing darker aspects of the human psyche. Even seemingly respectable upper middle-class people have their dark sides. The original short story is neat and clever, winding its tension tautly. Vosper fleshes out the action to fill the running time, and its clearly spread too thin. How do you cut something so intricately constructed? Which pieces of the jigsaw puzzle do you take away without ruining the finished picture? I suppose in this day and age we’re simply more accustomed to thrillers that rattle along at a faster pace.\n\nThe gorgeous production values of the Crescent and the superb playing of the ensemble (with special mention of Lloyd and Barry) keep us engaged and entertained. It just takes its time to reach its explosive resolution.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nHelena Lima’s Cecily falling for the charms of Alex Morley-Wiseman’s Bruce (Photo: Graeme Braidwood)\n\nUNFORTUNATE – The Untold Story of Ursula The Sea Witch\n\nBirmingham Hippodrome, Thursday 11th April 2024\n\nFat Rascal’s Unfortunate is back at the Hippodrome, but this time it has swapped the studio space for the whopping main stage. The show has blossomed from a piece of pub theatre to a full-scale musical – albeit a parody.\n\nDisney’s The Little Mermaid is a classic. And that’s why the parody works, because the film still has cultural currency. The script, by Robyn Grant and Daniel Foxx, has been updated so the topical references still zing, although when a bunch of fugly puppets gather to sing ‘We Didn’t Make It To Disney’, the number overlooks the present-day accusations of ‘wokeness’ levelled at the corporate behemoth.\n\nGrant and Foxx provide the lyrics to Tim Gilvin’s tunes, which are pastiches of the well-known songs from the film and others. Ariel’s ‘I Want’ song ‘Part of Your World’ becomes ‘Where The Dicks Are’, because above all, this show is loaded with smut, smut, glorious smut. Juvenile, puerile, but also clever. The funny lines come thick and fast (so to speak) and are played to the hilt by an energetic ensemble in colourful costumes.\n\nLeading the cast is the magnificent Shawna Hamic as Ursula the Sea Witch. Hamic’s characterisation is a homage to the late great Pat Carroll who voiced the role in the film, and yet Hamic also makes the part completely her own. Ursula narrates her version of events, from childhood up to and including the movie. We meet her as a tentacled child, defeating her bullies with dark magic, and later as a teen, striking up a high-school relationship with the heir to the throne of Atlantica, young Prince Triton (a marvellously posturing Thomas Lowe).\n\nDrag Race UK alumnus River Medway is serving fish as Ariel, with a broad Estuary accent that is as hilarious as she is glamorous. When Ariel surrenders her voice to the sea witch for plot reasons, Medway is even funnier in dumbshow, proving herself a genuine comic talent.\n\nAllie Dart is in fine form as Sebastian the crab (here with a County Cork accent, rather than the original’s Jamaican, for reasons of sensitivity) and as the French chef. “Zat was fucking mental!” she observes with exquisite timing.\n\nJulian Capolei proves his mettle as a rather camp Grimsby (what am I saying, EVERYONE is camp in this show) a melodramatic and dragged up as Ursula’s alter ego Vanessa. Also great fun is Jamie Mawson as the dim-witted Prince Eric, every inch Ariel’s intellectual equal.\n\nRobyn Grant’s direction shows a flair for comic invention, an eye for detail, and an ear for line-reading, eliciting an energised and committed performance from the entire cast.\n\nEverything works in concert to make this one of the funniest shows around: the puppets, the lighting, the costumes, the choreo… The larger stage is a good fit. Like a goldfish in a bowl, the show has expanded to fill the bigger space.\n\nIf you’re not fortunate enough to be able to catch the show during its brief Birmingham run, fret not. It’s coming back to the region for a stint at Wolverhampton’s Grand Theatre in July.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nA finely-tuned Ariel: River Medway\n\nPic: Pamela Raith Photography\n\nSHREK THE MUSICAL\n\nThe Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham, Tuesday 9th April 2024\n\nI’ll come right out and say it: I don’t enjoy the Shrek films. They’re low-rent Disney rip-offs, and the animation lacks the charm and heart of the films it seeks to parody and to emulate. But, you never know, perhaps I’ll find the material more amenable when presented as a musical for the stage…\n\nIt’s a neat idea, to flip a fairy tale so that the monster is the protagonist, the hero we’re supposed to root for. And so, the eponymous Shrek the ogre, booted out by his parents at the age of seven, and enjoying a hermitic life in a swamp, is forced to take action when other fairy tale characters are rounded up and evicted from the kingdom, because of their ‘otherness’ and come to live in his swamp. More could be made of this, especially when it turns out the one responsible for this discrimination is also a ‘colourful’ character himself, in a display of hypocrisy we usually see in conservative politicians.\n\nOn his way, Shrek teams up, against his will, with a loud-mouthed donkey, called Donkey. They face the dragon, rescue the princess and so on, but the inversion of the plot mechanics is what gives the piece its originality.\n\nThis is a good-looking production, with colourful curves arcing over the stage, the scenery enhanced by video projections. And the costumes are spectacular. There is no stinting on production values. But I find the score tiresome. Too many forgettable songs – especially from our leading monster, who gets to search his soul so many times it quickly begins to feel like padding. Shrek is played by Antony Lawrence, a gentle giant who has a strong, clear voice, but somehow I imagined the ogre would be a baritone.\n\nLawrence is upstaged by Brandon Lee Sears as Donkey, who is all kinds of sass and has a superb singing voice. I might have liked to see Donkey as a pantomime horse, with two performers. In fact, the whole production could benefit from leaning into its more pantomime aspects, rather than trying to reproduce the feel of the movie.\n\nAnother great voice comes from Cherece Richards as the Dragon. I could listen to her all night. It’s a shame it’s a cameo role.\n\nClearly enjoying herself as Princess Fiona, Joanne Clifton is a ballsy leading lady and boy, can she hold those long notes! Her Fiona is a broadly comic figure, and there is one of the best musical moments when, imprisoned in her tower, we see the princess at different stages of her incarceration over the years.\n\nStealing the show, though, in my opinion, is James Gillan as the villainous Lord Farquaad, in a screamingly camp performance complete with Richard III bob. Gillan is monstrously good; we applaud his performance rather than boo the character.\n\nThe lyrics are better than the laboured dialogue, but the tunes don’t stick in the mind. The talented ensemble keep the energy levels high, selling the material as if their lives depend on it. It’s pretty telling when the number that gets us going is the iconic Monkees hit, I’m A Believer, which closes the show. None of the show’s original songs come close to this brilliance.\n\nIt’s a crowd-pleaser, to be sure, with something for all the family. If that family revels in farting and throwaway pop culture references.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆\n\nRoar talent.

Is she acting or going around the twist for real? The death of a young fan complicates the actress’s mental state, turning up like Banquo’s ghost and skipping around in an annoying fashion.\n\nThis adaptation adds a documentary film crew to the mix. Camera operators stalk the actors, casting their close-ups onto a ginormous screen suspended over the set. It’s a gimmick in line with a current fad among West End shows, but it takes away more than it gives to the performance. Often, when someone’s mug looms over proceedings, I’m distracted enough to search the crowded stage to see where the actor is. It can be tricky to keep track of the action, with actors milling around in a naturalistic fashion (by which I mean, apparently unfocussed) and the camera choosing what is enlarged for our viewing pleasure.\n\nOne of the UK’s favourite stars, Sheridan Smith, plays the troubled Myrtle Gordon, and as you’d expect, her charisma shines through the muddled material. She spends a lot of time far upstage, her back turned, singing to her dressing room mirror, her reflection magnified on the screen. It’s a distancing effect and keeps us from engaging with the character. Smith leads a fine cast, who bob up to the surface every now and then for their moment. Among them are Benjamin Walker as co-star Maurice, and John Marquez as David. I’m not sure if those who haven’t seen the film will be clear on who these characters are in Myrtle’s life, due to a lack of exposition. Also strong are Hadley Fraser as the director and Nicola Hughes as the playwright. Hughes gets a wonderfully dark song, which she emotes her way through on the big screen, like a judge on Krypton, while being sidelined from the action. Also good is Amy Lennox as Dorothy – a role much abbreviated from the film.\n\nHaving loved his output for decades, I’m always excited to hear new music by Rufus Wainwright, and fans will recognise his hand in every number of this sophisticated score. Trouble is, for a show about a show, there are only glimpses of what could be showstopping show tunes. As a concept album, the piece would work brilliantly, but where are the Sondheim standout moments, the Cole Porter frivolity? They seem to be bubbling under the surface. Wainwright should lean into the genre’s great heritage rather than referencing classical music (the Overture could have been written by Faure) and alluding to classical mythology (eg Trojan women) in his lyrics.\n\nThe play-within-the play, the dreadful The Second Woman, affords a solid gold opportunity to exploit the musical theatre form. Instead, we get repeated scenes, lifted directly from the screenplay. Which brings us to the nub of the problem:\n\nDirector Ivo Van Hove’s staging, relying as it does on cameras and screens, robs the piece of its theatricality. It becomes something else. With the action on stage obfuscated, we are forced to look at the screen to keep up with what’s happening. There needs to be more differentiation between rehearsals and preview performances – the stage is mostly bare for both. Here’s an idea, use us, the audience as backdrop for the performance scenes…\n\nThere is one sequence when Van Hove’s humongous screen comes into its own and makes for striking visuals and storytelling: while Myrtle wrestles with Nancy the annoying teenage ghost (Shira Haas) the image is multiplied, each iteration playing on a delay. With Wainwright’s score rocking out at this point, the moment excellently expresses Myrtle’s inner torment.\n\nBut it’s not enough to save the show. Rather than showing us, the screen screens things from us. The documentary crew is a bad idea (Myrtle wouldn’t let them see her like this!) and what could have been an incisive look at public and private personas through the metaphor of theatre, ends up as a showy morass, a messy, patchy presentation that gets in its own way.\n\n☆ ☆\n\nRose to the occasion. Sheridan Smith as Myrtle (Photo: Jan Versweyveld)\n\nBEN & IMO\n\nThe Swan Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, Tuesday 2nd April 2024\n\nMark Ravenhill’s new play couldn’t be further from his first one (Sh*pping and Fucking), dealing with a rather rarefied moment in British musical history. Composer Benjamin Britten has just nine months to come up with a grand opera in time for the coronation of Elizabeth II. Along comes Imogen, daughter of Gustav ‘The Planets’ Holst, to assist. Imo is unsure of what her role entails, but for our purposes, she is there to push all of Britten’s buttons. Sometimes they are friends, having fun, knocking back Drambuie. At others, they are at loggerheads and the fur flies.\n\nSamuel Barnett’s Britten is brittle, reserved and closed, in contrast with Victoria Yeates’s Imogen, who is open, expressive, and forthright. Both actors are equally matched in their barbed exchanges, bringing all the colours of this volatile friendship to the fore. Ravenhill’s dialogue scintillates when they’re happy, and the sparks fly when they’re upset. Yeates’s intonations in particular evoke the bygone age, while Barnett fleshes out the more famous of the pair with petulance and a degree of emotional immaturity.\n\nMost of the time, they don’t seem to getting any work done, but then writing music is hardly stage-worthy, and apparently, this was Britten’s method: to do precious little and then all of a sudden splurge out pages and pages of brilliance. There is something of the Mozart and Salieri about the pairing, with Holst putting herself very much in Britten’s shadow, regardless of what her own talents and achievements may be.\n\nDirector Erica Whyman bows out of her time at the RSC with this beautifully paced piece, eliciting engaging, nuanced and detailed performances from her brace of actors. It’s stylishly produced, with a revolving grand piano dominating the stage, casting its huge shadow on the back wall, like a looming presence.\n\nYou don’t have to be an aficionado of classical music to enjoy this portrayal of genius. You can’t have genius without the darkness, Imo opines, and she’s right, and it’s what makes Britten an interesting character, with his flaws held up to the light. And it’s also a story of a woman learning to stand up for herself and not to always take the supporting role.\n\nHugely enjoyable, and a real treat to see two superb performers firing off each other.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nThere, there.

Very much in the same vein as Roald Dahl’s work, the stories often feature a decent child among grotesque adults. This one has young Stella imprisoned by Aunt Alberta, who is plotting to rob the child of her inheritance. What sets this one apart from other Walliams books is it’s not set in the present day. It’s old-fashioned, taking its cues from say, a Frances Hodgson Burnett or a Philippa Pearce et al.\n\nAdapted for the Birmingham Stage Company by director Neal Foster, the action is set entirely in the gothic mansion at stake. As usual, the production values and the theatricality are top drawer – invariably I find these BSC versions more palatable than the books! Foster also appears in the title role, playing Alberta larger-than-life and then some! A truly monstrous figure as ridiculous as she is cruel. Foster inhabits the role with gusto, keeping on the right side of the Monty Python method of female impersonation, which would be terribly grating sustained for two hours.\n\nOur heroine Stella is portrayed by Annie Cordoni, whose youthful energy brings out the character’s duality: Stella is on the brink of her teenage years, so in some ways she is mature and capable, in others she is still prone to emotional outbursts. Cordoni keeps Stella’s resilience and self-reliance to the fore, as she is forced to overcome her childish fears and take direct action to save her skin.\n\nImprisoned in the coal cellar, Stella befriends a ghost in the form of young chimney sweep Soot (a likeable Matthew Allen) and the pair work together to overthrow the tyrannical Alberta. Soot has a nice line in Cockney rhyming slang, a contrast to posho Stella’s plummier tones. The representation of class is old school, but at least by the end Stella learns to not be so much of a snob.\n\nAdding humour to proceedings is Zain Abrahams as Gibbon, the deaf and dotty butler. Adding menace is a beautiful puppet owl called Wagner (operated by Emily Essery). Puppets also feature in action scenes, as though in long shot. Foster’s direction blends these ‘zoom outs’ seamlessly, while Jacqueline Trousdale’s set slides on and off or rotates to take us to various locations in and outside of the mansion.\n\nComposer Jak Poore’s music contains plenty of crashing chords to highlight the melodramatic aspects of the story, and to intensify the suspense.\n\nYes, it’s all over-the top. Yes, the moral message seems bolted on at the end, but it all makes for a funny, gripping, comedy-thriller with something to entertain every member of the family.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nA real hoot: Emily Essery gives a hand to Wagner the owl while Aunt Alberta (Neal Foster) is mother.\n\nHORIZONS: A 21st Century Space Odyssey\n\nTown Hall, Dudley, Wednesday 20th March, 2024\n\nWith Sibelius’s fifth symphony ebbing and flowing, images play on a screen that stretches the width of the stage, images of the Big Bang, the creation of life under the sea, civilisation with its skyscrapers and network of roads, space stations, colonies on other worlds… And so the past, present and future are revealed to us.\n\nOn bounds Professor Brian Cox who, though now in his fifties, could be mistaken for someone thirty years younger in his black denims and with his full head of hair, the bastard. For the next couple of hours, in that familiar soft voice, Cox orates this history of prehistory and post-history, dwelling on the nature of cosmology and its scientific and philosophical implications. I won’t attempt to summarise because I could only get things wrong but terms I recognise like ‘Hubble telescope’, ‘Whirlpool galaxy’ and ‘singularity’ feature quite a bit, along with others that are new to me, like ‘cosmic web’. The show is a learning experience as much as a piece of entertainment – and Cox is very entertaining in his casual, affable manner. Before introducing us to an equation he asks if there are any mathematicians in the house. This being Dudley, there are none. “I could just make this shit up!” he chuckles.\n\nInto the mix, he brings in the work of Hawking and Sagan, among others, very much demonstrating that the work is ongoing, with knowledge expanding like the universe, with old ideas being reevaluated in the light of new theories and new understanding. One of the images he shares with us is only a week old!\n\nIt’s a lot to take in and you have to stay alert. There’s no time to mull things over because his laser pointer is onto something else already! Somehow, I manage to keep up and I think I grasp most of it. Good job there’s no exam at the end.\n\nInevitably the insignificance of our small blue planet comes to the fore, but also something more positive. If we are unique, if we are the only beings anywhere who even try to understand the universe, then we are all the more valuable. Then I think of those who need to hear this, the warmongers and climate change deniers and inactivists that put us all at threat, and I get depressed all over again.\n\nAwe-inspiring, brain-stretching, and sobering all at once, this is an engaging and enlightening experience that gives us plenty to think about, long after the charming Professor Cox has left the stage.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nFRANK’S CLOSET\n\nThe Union Theatre, Southwark, London, Saturday 16th March, 2024\n\nFrank’s fiancé, Alan, has told him to clear out his closet in advance of their imminent nuptials. For me, that would be a massive red flag, and Frank too (bless him) has his doubts – because his wardrobe is not full of the usual clutter or even a pathway to Narnia. Frank’s closet is brimming with his prize collection of theatrical costumes, ranging from Marie Lloyd to Dusty Springfield, via Karen Carpenter and Judy Garland and so on. As he sorts through the clothes, Frank reminisces about his past with the previous owner of the outfit conjured up before him to sing him a life lesson or, if not, to have a good time!\n\nThe plot may be wafer thin, but the talent is thick on the ground. Staged as a cabaret, with a mocked-up proscenium arch upstage centre, the show is a series of monologues (comic and otherwise) broken up by musical numbers, performed by Frank, a quartet of Gaiety Girls and the successive divas.\n\nLeading the cast as Frank is Andy Moss, familiar from TV but also no stranger to musical theatre. Moss makes Frank a rounded figure, whose joie de vivre in the musical numbers is countered by vulnerability and periods of self-doubt. We take to him immediately. Lines by other characters are supplied by the Gaiety Girls; we really are in Frank’s headspace.\n\nPlaying all the songbirds is The Diva – a remarkable Luke Farrugia who captures the look and sound of each superstar. The songs are by Stuart Wood (who also wrote the script) and are all solid pastiches of familiar hits. You can easily imagine Agnetha Faltskog performing ‘Abba Made Me Gay’ – well, you don’t have to imagine it, Luke Farrugia is doing it for you!\n\nJo McShane’s choreography puts the cast through their paces, changing with the eras, everything from ostrich feathers to high-kicking chorus lines. The Gaiety Girls (Sarah Freer, Jack Rose, Olivia McBride, and Oliver Bradley-Taylor) hardly leave the stage, keeping the music hall-burlesque-boîte de nuit energy going. Special mention must be made of Paul Toulson who, as the wonderfully named Sheila Blige entertains us in the bar before the show and, with the Gaiety Girls, during the interval. Good, old-fashioned double entendre that’s only smutty if you think it is.\n\nWith music played live, under the direction of Anto Buckley, the production feels like a step back in time, a survey of queer musical icons. Nostalgia is strong, yes, but the show also feels fresh. This production is a revival and reworking of the show’s original incarnation from 2009, and it’s the kind of thing that could run for a long time, constantly updating its divas and references.\n\nI imagine what someone like Jinkx Monsoon could do in this show and get shivers!\n\nMeanwhile, as it stands, Frank’s Closet is a feelgood, cheeky cabaret that even managed to get a raucous and enthusiastic response from today’s matinee crowd.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nBeing perfectly Frank, Andy Moss and two of the Gaiety Girls (Sarah Freer and Olivia McBride)\n\nPhoto: Danny Kaan\n\nCOLDER THAN HERE\n\nBear Pit Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, Wednesday 13th March, 2024\n\nMyra is dying. It’s terminal cancer and the end is nigh. Before she pops her clogs, she wants to plan her funeral. This gives her husband and two grown-up daughters the ‘ick’. They don’t want to talk about it.\n\nThis brand new play by Laura Wade boasts a casketful of funny lines as, luckily for the audience, the characters use gallows humour as a coping mechanism.\n\nAs Myra, Lynn Taylor shines, combining physical frailty with steely determination. Myra is resigned to her impending fate and wants to meet it her way. She’s even made a clunky PowerPoint she makes the family sit through.\n\nHusband Alec (Steve Bizley) delivers some of the darkest barbs but we can see how incapable he is, emotionally, as he takes out his aggression and frustration on the company who consistently fail to fix the boiler. The house is cold, symbolising the stark reality the family is facing.\n\nIt’s not all grumpiness and snark between the two. There’s a touching moment when affection is rekindled that is beautifully done.\n\nYounger daughter Jenna (Sammie Horton) embodies the sulky, snappy sarcasm and petulance of a teenager who never grew up. Jenna’s emotional immaturity is only slightly wearing as Horton shows us other aspects of the character in a very funny portrayal of a spoilt little sister.\n\nOlder sister Harriet (Hannah McBride) is the most emotionally savvy of the lot, but even she can burst forth with angry, colourful language when the need arises. McBride is all about control, and even when Harriet loses her temper, we get the impression she knows precisely what she’s saying, aiming her resentment like a sniper with bullets.\n\nIt’s all nicely played and the pacing is handled perfectly by director Jacquie Campbell, avoiding mawkishness and morbidness. Wade’s script deftly keeps sentiment between the waspish lines, putting conversations we should all be having with our loved ones front and centre.\n\nSadly, statistically speaking, cancer is an ordinary disease. Myra chooses to face her death sentence in a positive manner. Perhaps a little too positively. She’s an admirable example, to be sure, but I don’t believe we should go quietly into that good night. We should be raging against a government that prioritises spending on weapons, and squandering untold billions on sending some of the world’s most vulnerable and desperate people to Rwanda, rather than using public money to find a cure.\n\nWhile it’s not exactly life-affirming, Colder Than Here will give you a warm and fuzzy feeling. An entertaining and provocative piece.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nLynn Taylor and Sammie Horton as Myra and Jenna (Photo Chris Clarke)\n\nWICKED\n\nBirmingham Hippodrome, Wednesday 6th March, 2024\n\nOne of the most successful musicals of all time is on the road again and it’s a real treat to be able to catch it during its stay at Birmingham’s Hippodrome. If you’ve seen it before, you’ll recall the emotional highs and lows of the story, and the green-faced one belting out ‘Defying Gravity’, but perhaps like me you’ll be reminded just how funny the show is. Winnie Holzer’s script sparkles with wit and an almost Seussian glee in using made-up words with ‘definish braverism’.\n\nAlso, I am struck by the production values. The exquisite costumes (by Susan Hilferty) in particular give the show its definitive look, with special mention to Tom Watkins’s wigs and hair. Oz is certainly not Kansas anymore. In fact, the show has a distinctively British feel to it, which works very well, except when a line is an American idiom. We even get a Geordie munchkin, in the form of Daniel Hope’s long-suffering Boq.\n\nIt’s a show that is dominated by the two central figures, Elphaba and Galinda, two contrasting personalities who meet at Shiz University and strike up an instant dislike to each other. The plot has them become roommates and it’s ultimately rather touching to see friendship bloom and blossom between them.\n\nLaura Pick’s Elphaba is a dour figure, snapping at those who revile her for her skin colour, but when she sings…This Elphaba tugs at your heartstrings. Pick certainly can belt, while keeping the emotion of the song to the fore. The Act One closer, the show’s most famous number, Defying Gravity, brings the house down. It’s a high that show never quite reaches again – not that I wish to write off the second act, which is a turmoil (perhaps even a twister) of action and emotional resolution.\n\nFor me, this time around, it’s Sarah O’Connor’s Galinda who takes the prize. It’s a nuanced, sometimes deadpan portrayal of the ditzy blonde whose experiences with someone at the opposite end of the popularity scale bring out her humanity and compassion. She is also extremely funny.\n\nThe farewell duet where the pair admit their relationship has changed them for the better is a gut punch that brings tears to the eyes.\n\nDonna Berlin’s Madame Morrible makes the most of the part. At first, a benevolent, welcoming Head-Shiz-tress, then later a duplicitous, manipulative mouthpiece for Simeon Truby’s avuncular Wizard of Oz. Truby certainly delivers the villain’s sentimental side but I would like to see a glimpse of coldness, of his determination to cling to power at all costs.\n\nCarl Man is a gorgeous Fiyero, arriving at university like Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, all self-centred posturing. Fiyero is handsome and he knows it. But there is more to the role than that, as he supports Elphaba in her animal rescue missions. Man brings backbone to the part, which is ironic when you know how the character ends up!\n\nThe show is about more than female friendship. Of course, Elphaba’s minority skin colour makes her an obvious cipher for racism, but she is not the only victim of Oz society’s malleable morals. The talking animals are scapegoated, rounded up and stripped of their rights and ability to speak out. Yes, it’s reminiscent of Nazi Germany, but (and this is what hit me hardest) it’s a direct reference to what is going on in the world today. The vulnerable are blamed for society’s ills and, amazingly, people buy into it. The Wizard pins the blame on the animals, justifying their abuse and disenfranchisement, just like our own feeble prime minister strikes up a chorus of ‘Stop the boats’ whenever he is in danger of appearing weak.\n\nFuelling the fire is Madame Morrible’s ceaseless propaganda; she is the media, supporting government policy, glossing over the inhumanity and cruelty – which is all too close to the bone, when you consider what is going on in Gaza.\n\nElphaba becomes the poster girl for society’s problems, hunted by the military. But, as we know, one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter; it just depends on who is doing the labelling.\n\nAnd so, two decades since it first appeared, the show has gained in relevance and topicality. Yes, it’s funny, yes, it’s moving, but if it doesn’t make you think about the world we live in, you’re missing a trick.\n\nA magical, spellbinding musical, extravagant and emotional. As the young folk were wont to say, it’s well wicked.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nSarah O’Connor and Laura Pick (Photo: Matt Crockett)\n\nA MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM\n\nRoyal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, Thursday 29th February 2024\n\nAmong Shakespeare’s works, this romantic comic fantasy ranks as one of his greatest hits, and done well, it’s easy to see why. It’s also something that in the wrong hands, can be rather twee. Eleanor Rhode’s new production dispenses with the forest – even the fairies are reduced to tiny orbs of light – and there is a 1980s retro vibe to the design, most of which works well.\n\nDuke Theseus (Bally Gill) is a bit of a mis-step. Gill plays the Ancient Greek hero as an imitation of Rishi Sunak. If Theseus had been half as insipid as the prime minister, the Minotaur would have had an easy lunch. So, the one-note performance becomes tiresome pretty quickly. Sharing a scene with Neil McCaul’s masterly Egeus, the aggrieved and unreasonable father, Thesunak looks all the weaker. Gill also doubles as Oberon, King of the Fairies. Here, he’s allowed to be more authoritative, if only he wasn’t dressed like he was walking home from a night out at a New Romantics club, all flouncy shirt and Adam Ant jacket. Similarly, Sirine Saba’s Hippolyta is all shoulder pads and power dressing, while her Titania lets her hair down, sporting a disco diva jumpsuit. They are design choices that tie the immortals to the earth, rather than accentuating their otherness.\n\nPuck, on the other hand, feels like a fresh take. Rosie Sheehy makes for a robust sprite. With her purple trousers, green hair, white face and red lips, she is definitely cos-play Joker. Her down-to-earth humour and irreverent manner contrast nicely with her magical abilities, in a show-stealing performance.\n\nI was surprised to hear comedy star Matthew Baynton had been cast as Bottom the Weaver. I’m used to my Bottoms being boorish and overbearing, which is completely against Baynton’s type. And so, his Bottom is an effete, posturing thing, ironically more ethereal than the Fairy King and Queen. Translated into a donkey, he is still rather sweet with his big ears and buck teeth. It makes a nonsense of Puck’s line that Titania has fallen in love with a monster. Baynton’s cuteness robs Titania’s infatuation of its potential for grossness and ridiculousness. When it comes to the play-within-the-play, a horrible history of doomed lovers, Baynton really earns his fee and his star billing, in an elegantly daft, declamatory portrayal of Pyramus. Now the casting makes perfect sense.\n\nInterestingly, the Mechanicals create a prologue for their play, a trigger warning in case people are afraid of lions. Nowadays, it would mention the subject of suicide. It’s as though Shakespeare is satirising something that came along centuries later.\n\nSpeaking of the Mechanicals, there are pleasing turns from Helen Monks as an enthusiastic Quince, Laurie Jameson as Snug the Joiner, Emily Cundick as Snout the tinker (whose Wall stands stony-faced through some of the bawdiest of the comic business!) and Premi Tamang as Starveling the tailor, whose Moon is absolutely deranged and would not be out of place in a Japanese horror film. But it is Mitesh Soni as Flute, dragged up as Thisbe who wins our hearts in a touching but still hilarious performance.\n\nRyan Hutton as Lysander has all the moves of a romantic lover, albeit in an exaggerated manner, while Nicholas Armfield’s Demetrius is more grounded but is still prone to histrionics. The wonderfully named Boadicea Ricketts makes an outspoken Helena, wearing trousers in a man’s world, while Dawn Sievewright’s Hermia with her Scottish brogue gives the lie to Helena’s claim that they grew up together. Sievewright chucks herself around like a rabid wrestler in some well-choreographed brawling scenes. I have to say that the Fight & Intimacy directors Rachel Bown-Williams and Ruth Cooper-Brown, and Movement Director Annie-Lunnette Deakin-Foster have done a bang-up job with this show.\n\nAnother brilliant feature is Will Gregory’s original electronica-infused music, played live under the direction of Bruce O’Neil. The settings of Puck’s songs are especially wonderful.\n\nSuspended above the stage are dozens and dozens of sphere of different sizes, that glow and change colour and display projected images as the action dictates. It’s a magical idea, again putting me in mind of nightclubs rather than a mystical forest.\n\nFor the most part, this is a hugely enjoyable, immensely funny, if earthbound production, that is accessible without dumbing down. And at least it’s not twee!\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nEeyore to look worse. Matthew Baynton’s Bottom meets Sirine Saba’s Titania\n\nPhoto Pamela Raith (c) RSC\n\nAN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN\n\nAlexandra Theatre, Birmingham, Monday 26thFebruary 2024\n\nDue to a lack of creativity among musical theatre producers, they think all they have to do is pick an old film that everybody likes, bung some pop songs in it and hey presto! Box office gold.\n\nIf only.\n\nThe Richard Gere-Debra Winger film from the 1980s is given the jukebox musical treatment, and people of a certain age are flocking to it, prompted no doubt by nostalgia. Mercifully, most of the picture’s Reaganite propaganda has been watered down to make the material more palatable for today’s sensibilities. The archaic gender politics are still there, under the surface, but that’s about all there is under the surface in this supremely shallow show.\n\nThe wafer-thin plot concerns a bunch of naval recruits undergoing twelve gruelling weeks of training, which seem to consist of doing a bit of dancey P.E. while being harangued by a loud, slightly camp bitch of a drill sergeant. Those who wish to quit, ring a bell. Those who stay the course venture into town to pick up women, with the sergeant’s warning ringing in their ears: Watch out! They only want one thing – that thing being to trap the officers into marriage. The naval recruits are seen as little more than a meal ticket for the local girls, their passport out of the town and the drudgery of their factory jobs.\n\nWe get training montages at the naval base (although no one even mentions a ship or even the sea) and in the factory we get feminist anthems. When men and women meet we get karaoke Bon Jovi. There are plenty of songs, each of them high on the nostalgia scale. The trouble is giving pop songs to musical theatre performers rarely works. It’s a different kind of singing. Pop music doesn’t need to be belted out. And so classics like Blondie’s Heart of Glass and Cindy Lauper’s Girls Just Want To Have Fun are murdered right before our very ears.\n\nLuke Baker takes the Richard Gere role, a character by the name of Zack Mayo, whose dad is a drunken womaniser and whose mum killed herself when he was young. These circumstances have led to a charisma-bypass, and it’s hard to care a jot for him. Also trying hard with a two-dimensional part is Georgia Lennon as Mayo’s main squeeze, Paula. Of course, at the end, when Zack picks her up at the factory in that iconic scene, the crowd goes wild. I suspect that if this moment had been overlooked, they would have torn the place apart. The exhilaration I feel is because we have at last reached the end of what feels like a twelve-week long show. And I could have done without the appearance of Mayo’s newly dead mate Sid appearing up above in a pristine white uniform he hasn’t earned, smiling down.\n\nAnother crowd pleaser is Olivia Foster-Browne as Seegar, the female recruit who can’t get over the wall on the assault course without helping hands from the men. In a bizarre piece of staging, the action goes to slow mo, and the men lift her high and walk her up the wall. At no other point do things get this stylised. I would be more impressed if she actually scrambled up the thing unaided, proving she’s just as good as the blokes.\n\nThere is an awkwardly staged scene around a dinner table which adds nothing and is utterly pointless.\n\nJamal Crawford is fine as the big mouth drill sergeant. Curiously, his voice dips in power when he is singing. Not so with Wendi Harriott as Aunt Bunny and Melanie Masson as Paula’s mother. These two have the best voices of the lot, but they eschew the feminist anthems for the soppy hit ballad in the final scene.\n\nThe songs all descend into shouting matches, and no amount of emoting can cover the fact that often the lyrics don’t fit. But that’s jukebox musicals for you.\n\nOf course, this is a money-making rather than a creative endeavour. People who remember the film as being better than it actually is will get a kick from it. But I crave originality. How I yearned to jump onto the stage and ring that bloody bell for myself.\n\n☆\n\nI got nowhere else to go!

Director Fi Cotton sets the action in the round. We, the audience, are the walls of lecturer Frank’s office. As well as our smiling faces, there is a couple of swivel chairs, and a small stepladder, and a few stacks of books. Well, you don’t want furniture and scenery getting in the way when you’re in the round. Cotton has made the decision not to have any props. When the telephone rings, Frank talks to thin air. When he wants an illicit drink from the stash among his bookshelves, he merely stands atop the small stepladder, there being no bookshelves nor concealed bottles. Interesting, I think. The scenery ban robs Rita’s entrance of some of its impact. Thanks to a wonky doorknob she bursts into Frank’s office and into his life. Here this is reduced to a few stumbling steps across the floor.\n\nAs Frank, William Hayes has the lecturer’s condescension and patronising humour down pat. Beneath this mask, there is his emotional life, which is in turmoil, and his increasing dependency on booze, which threatens his professional life. Hayes is utterly credible, even when he’s repeatedly standing on his small stepladder gazing at shelves that aren’t there.\n\nVicky Youster’s Rita is a joy. Youster does a more than passable Liverpudlian accent, capturing the cadence of Russell’s dialogue and hitting all the punchlines perfectly. “Don’t laugh at me!” Rita repeats, when she gets something (amusingly) wrong. And she’s right. To laugh at this working class woman who is trying to make something of herself would be patronising. It strikes me that someone like Rita, coming to see the play, would not understand why her errors are funny, and our laughter might alienate them further from educational pursuits.\n\nFi Cotton gets the tonal shifts of their relationship spot on. While Rita hits the books, Frank hits the bottle. They learn from each other and grow. Unfortunately, Cotton’s no props rule is not applied consistently. Rita presents Frank with a pen in a gift box. He gives her a dress. Meanwhile, they don’t even mime having the drinks he doesn’t mime fetching from his stepladder… Also, some of the lighting choices jar somewhat. Changes of colour and/or intensity mid scene in a half-hearted expressionistic way serve only to distract from the heated exchanges.\n\nMost jarring of all though are the updates to the dialogue. Instead of singing along with the jukebox in their local, Rita’s friends and family have come across a song on Tik Tok. It doesn’t work. If you’re going to dabble with updates, you have to go the whole hog. If Tik Tok exists, then Rita would presumably be emailing her essays in. Her tutorials would more than likely take place as Zoom sessions. She would text Frank to say she couldn’t make it "
