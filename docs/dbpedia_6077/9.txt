Johnny Green conducts the M-G-M Studio Orchestra in a rendition of the overture to the 1849 opera, "The Merry Wives of Windsor" by Otto Nicolai (music) and Hermann von Mesnethal (lyrics) â€” based on the 1602 play by William Shakespeare. Photographed in CinemaScope and Technicolor. Perspecta Stereophonic Sound. Producer: Johnny Green.

Copyright 22 December 1953 by Loew's Inc. A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer picture. U.S. release: December 1953. U.K. release: August 1954. 9 minutes. Won the 1953 Academy Award for Best One-Reel Short Subject, defeating "Christ Among the Primitives", "Herring Hunt", "Joy of Living", and "Wee Water Wonders".

COMMENT: Despite its Academy Award, this M-G-M orchestra recital is much the same as its 20th Century-Fox counterparts. The CinemaScope screen proves an ideal shape to present the full orchestra in reasonable close-up, whilst the stereophonic sound is fully utilized to give not only depth and direction, but the occasional startling effect. Aside from these aspects, however, in my opinion, the film has only a middling entertainment value. The camera-work is static, the playing (whilst certainly vigorous), I would describe as indifferent.
