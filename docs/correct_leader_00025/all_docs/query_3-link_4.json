        "text": "When Edward Heath, who has died aged 89, took Britain into the European Economic Community in 1971, it was the culmination of a lifetime of undeviating effort. Europe was his great theme - from his maiden speech in 1950 on the Schuman plan for coordinating western Europe's steel industries, to the ones he was still making half a century later, when Tony Blair was in 10 Downing Street and his own battles with his successor as Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher, had entered history.\n\nWhen an earlier Conservative prime minister, Harold Macmillan, first applied to join the then European Common Market in the early 1960s, Heath was in charge of the unsuccessful British negotiating team. His widely praised work won him the Charlemagne prize.\n\nShortly before Heath became prime minister in 1970, the third British application to join the Common Market had been submitted by Labour's Harold Wilson. But Wilson's singleness of purpose was in doubt. Heath's was not. On October 28 1971, the Commons voted with a 112 majority to go into Europe.\n\nAfter that, little went well. Singlemindedness and determination could also look like obstinacy and arrogance. Heath had won the 1970 election - against all the forecasts - with a majority of 30 and an unchallenged personal authority; he lost that in 1974, amid gloom and industrial chaos.\n\nThe 1970 victory had been preceded by talk of competitiveness, lower taxes, the hunting down of \"lame duck\" industry, a curb on public spending and an assault on what was seen as untrammelled trade union power. But then events, as Macmillan would have said, intruded.\n\nIn 1971 Rolls-Royce faced bankruptcy and was partly nationalised and bailed out, as was Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. The attack on unions triggered the 1972 saga of the Pentonville 5, while the battle with the miners ended in victory for the NUM. Public spending rocketed. In Northern Ireland, internment was followed by Bloody Sunday and the beginning of the IRA assault on mainland Britain.\n\nInternationally, in the wake of the Yom Kippur war, energy prices went up four-fold, and in 1973-74 there was renewed conflict with the NUM, the slide into the three-day week and the February 1974 election, called around the slogan, \"Who governs?\" The answer turned out to be Wilson, after a near dead-heat between the Labour and the Conservatives.\n\nWilson called another election that October. He won a majority of three, but for many Tory MPs losing was a sin. In 1975, Margaret Thatcher won the leadership from Heath. While it may have been radical for the Conservatives to choose a woman, from Heath's point of view the irony was that they had chosen another meritocrat.\n\nFor that was where he had come in. His party had seen the need in the mid-1960s to set Heath, their own meritocrat, to catch Labour's formidable Wilson, and that confrontation dominated a decade of British parliamentary life.\n\nWilson was loquacious, self-justifying, scornful, though anxious to please, fundamentally warm-hearted. Heath was tight-lipped, introverted, seemingly cold. Yet his performance was more effective than the headlines often made out, even if his carelessness about image-building must at times have been the despair of what are now labelled spin doctors.\n\nAfter Thatcher toppled him, his incapacity to do or say the right thing verged on high comedy. He regarded her as authoritarian, egotistical, intolerant, an aberration among Conservative leaders. There was no doubting their mutual dislike.\n\nPointedly she left him out of her shadow cabinet when he and many observers were expecting him to be offered the foreign affairs brief. One of the most bizarre episodes in 20th century Britain's politics ensued.\n\nOnlookers were astonished, delighted, appalled, according to temperament and party. Some were all three as Heath delivered speech after critical speech. It might all have been dismissed as disgruntled soliloquies from a soured man, were it not that the drama increasingly involved the central theme of Heath's career: Europe. Thatcher, as he saw things, was pursuing a narrow nationalism that militated against this country playing a full part in Europe.\n\nThe great issue is still unresolved, all these years after Heath led the British to Brussels. This lingering insularity, encouraged by what he regarded as the obstinate egotism and narrow vision of his successor, provided him with a cause that saved him from that elder statesman's fate of subsiding into the Lords or persisting on the Commons backbenches like an extinct volcano. Heath declined to be extinct. He and his great theme remained active. And after Thatcher's memorable fall in November 1990, her predecessor wore Westminster's widest, toothiest smile and borrowed one of her own phrases: \"Rejoice, rejoice\".\n\nIn July, 1965, Heath was the first Conservative leader to be chosen by secret ballot of MPs, the election having broken with the patrician system by which his predecessor, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, had \"emerged\" as leader in 1963. But it was Douglas-Home during his leadership who had instituted that ballot as a means of selecting, and deselecting, leaders.\n\nHeath's origin and career were in sharp contrast with those of his aristocratic predecessor. His father had been a Kent carpenter before becoming a master builder, his mother a lady's maid. Born in Broadstairs, he began his education as a choral scholar at St Peter's, the local Church of England school, at seven he began piano lessons. He won a scholarship to Chatham House grammar school, Ramsgate, took his school certificate at 13, was playing the organ at 14 and conducting at 15. He won an organ scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, became president of the university Conservative association in 1937 and of the Oxford Union in 1939.\n\nIn those times he visited Nazi Germany and attended a Nuremberg rally, and, as a supporter of the Spanish republic, came under machine gun fire while driving down the Spanish coast. During the 1938 Oxford byelection which Quintin Hogg, the future Lord Hailsham, won as the pro-appeasement Conservative candidate, Heath worked for the anti-appeasement candidate, the then Master of Balliol, AD Lindsay.\n\nThat year too he won a scholarship to Gray's Inn, London. He never took it up because in 1939 came the second world war. He fought in north-west Europe with the Honourable Artillery Company, rose to lieutenant-colonel and was awarded the military MBE and mentioned in dispatches.\n\nAfter the war, Heath became a civil servant, then took a post as news editor of the Church Times in 1947. Thatcher would have her husband's wealth behind her, but Heath, like John Major, William Hague , Iain Duncan-Smith, and Michael Howard, had to earn a living.\n\nIn 1948, he became a trainee in the finance house of Brown, Shipley and Company.\n\nIn 1949 at Bexley's \"bread-rationing byelection\" he reduced the Labour majority from 11,000 to 1,000. At the 1950 general election he won the redistributed seat with a 133 majority. After the Conservatives won the 1951 general election, he became a junior whip and resigned from Brown, Shipley to devote himself to politics.\n\nHe was energetic, thorough, efficient and a master both of detail and of his temper. The public had some idea of his political attitudes from his contribution to the seminal Conservative pamphlet, One Nation (1950). But then he remained silent in the Commons as deputy chief whip (1953-55) and chief whip (1955-59), before emerging as labour minister.\n\nFrom 1960-63, he was Lord Privy Seal with Foreign Office responsibilities and as such handled the Common Market negotiations. He was in his element, dealing with like-minded men over details of trade. Never caught out by questions, he emerged as a fervent European.\n\nWhen Sir Alec Douglas-Home succeeded Macmillan as prime minister in 1963, Heath was promoted to secretary of state for industry, trade and regional development and president of the board of trade. His main work was to secure the enactment of the resale prices bill which, against stiff Conservative opposition, limited the scope of price agreements.\n\nIt was not until the Conservatives lost office in October, 1964, that the House had a fair opportunity to judge Heath's ability in a wider context. His ability, familiarity with trade and finance, toughness in controversy - all fed belief among Conservatives that he was the man to restore them to power. Nevertheless, when the leadership election came, in 1965, Heath did not win outright. But his rivals Reginald Maudling and Enoch Powell withdrew their candidacies before the second ballot and Heath became leader.\n\nHe was promptly confronted with the task of preserving party unity over policy towards Ian Smith's white minority regime in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), when it made its 1965 unilateral declaration of independence. UDI challenged the authority of the crown and parliament and Wilson's government took steps - mainly sanctions - to undermine the Smith regime. There was a strong Conservative element, led by Lord Salisbury, which supported Smith. But, backed by Douglas-Home, Heath overcame the revolt.\n\nThen came 1966, the high tide of Wilson's political ascendancy, a 98-seat Labour majority in place of the four-seat majority which had determined the 1964 result. Probably no Conservative could have defeated Labour in that year, but for Heath's enemies, later, that defeat would be seen as a harbinger of worst times to come.\n\nBy 1968 Labour's popularity had plummetted. Yet it was that April that Powell made his \"rivers of blood\" speech on immigration. Neither Heath, nor any of his colleagues had been consulted. The Conservative leader sacked Powell, and thus opened up a fissure in his party which persisted.\n\nIn June 1970 Wilson called an election. He, and much of the media, assumed that victory was in the bag for Labour. But it was to be Heath's triumph, although it would last less than four years.\n\nBut Heath had hinterland, as his Oxford contemporary Denis Healey would say. By the time he quit the Commons in 2001, he was Father of the House, yet another addition to the honours, political, academic and artistic which he accumulated. And there was the music and the yachting. The latter saw him win the 1969 Sydney to Hobart race, captain Britain's 1971 Admiral's Cup team and be part of the 1980 Sardinia Cup team. His books included his Godkin lectures, Old World, New Horizons (1970), and Sailing A Course In My Life (1975).\n\nMichael White writes: To stay in public life for 26 years after being rejected resoundingly by the electorate and one's own party suggests either implacable determination or bloody-minded stubbornness. In Heath's case it was both. Winston Churchill, the patron of his early promotion, was clearly his model. Both spurned the Lords, but Churchill was 80, not 58, when he left No 10 trailing only slightly tarnished glory, not humiliation.\n\nCritics dubbed it the longest sulk in parliamentary history. But Heath had much to say on many topics and, as a man whose sleeve had been brushed by Hitler's at a rally in Nuremberg in 1937, he brought increasingly unique insights to the task.\n\nAt times during the years he sat in his corner seat below the Commons gangway, it seemed as if he was determined to stay there until Thatcher was not only politically down, but ideologically out as well. Had he lived to attend her funeral, one can imagine him thinking he had finally made his point.\n\nBut nothing proved so cut and dried. The limits of economic Thatcherism had been demonstrated, especially in its monetarist manifestation. But the deregulated, privatised, market-oriented world she helped to create - rather more successfully than his own efforts - had triumphed almost everywhere.\n\nAs for Europe, the great cause of Heath's career, Britain's place in it, in the wake of the Dutch and French referendums is still not clear. Heath's contempt for wilder Eurosceptic Tory talk of withdrawal from the European Union , or membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement, was always total. It could be counter-productive in a house increasingly peopled by Tory MPs who had been taught to regard him as a traitor and by Labour ones who thought, wrongly, that he was almost one of them.\n\nTowards the end he was often lumped together with his near-contemporary, Tony Benn. \"Good Riddance\" declared a Sunday Telegraph profile when the pair retired as MPs four years ago.\n\nBut right until the end of his parliamentary career he remained, like Benn, a speaker who could half-fill a near-empty chamber. Europe was his overriding preoccupation and he coupled it with a wariness of American policy and motives which made him the least pro-Washington postwar premier.\n\nIndustrial policy, relations with Russia and the wider world, especially China, where he advised the Beijing government and often defended it, were frequent topics. The author of the \"unacceptable face of capitalism\" jibe (his target was Lonrho) attacked corruption and poor performance among the captains of industry, deepening Tory enmity as much as his opposition to some of his party's privatisations.\n\nThat particular paradox was underlined when he spoke out fiercely against the widespread perception in the 1990s \"sleaze era\" that most MPs are less than honest and honourable. When he took that stance to the point of attacking the Nolan commission's report on reforming parliamentary accountability, few thought him wise.\n\nFriends who had taken his finances in hand in the 1970s helped make him comfortably well off. In addition to the yacht Morning Cloud, Heath owned a modest terrace house in Wilton Street, Belgravia, and another, much more magnificent and dating from Queen Anne, in Salisbury's Cathedral Close.\n\nOf the Chinese government's decision to put down the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989, he said: \"There was a crisis after a month in which the civil authorities had been defied. They took action. Very well.\" And his conciliatory approach to Saddam Hussein also attracted widespread criticism.\n\nHe was asked if he ever wondered if he was making the mistake that Neville Chamberlain had made. \"No\", he replied. In his defence, it could be said that former soldiers who have seen war are least keen to inflict it on others. But there was recurring evidence that he could be insensitive to democratic demands and insufficiently wary of authoritarian regimes.\n\nAs MP for Bexley, Bexley Sidcup and Old Bexley and Sidcup from 1950 - when his majority had been smaller than the number of votes which Mr Job, the Communist party candidate, took off Labour (he often toasted Mr Job) - Heath kept a good agent who looked after constituents' needs, and he did not outstay his welcome among local loyalists until close to the end. Whe he stood down in 2001, Derek Conway, a Eurosceptic ex-whip, won the seat.\n\nThe same election Tony Benn's seat went to the Lib Dems. Such are the indignities of political old age. But Heath's were more extensive, unusually so. His complaint was that the Thatcherites who so brilliantly ousted him from the leadership in 1975, never accorded him the courtesies to which an ex-leader and premier was entitled. Invitations to consult, or to No 10 dinners, were virtually non-existent. There was no cabinet job offered when Mrs Thatcher won office in 1979, except some vague talk of the Washington embassy, which he took (rightly) as an insult.\n\nApart from the Brandt commission on international development and north-south relations (1977-83), which was out of touch with the harsher temper of the times, he undertook few big public tasks, preferring to become what his lieutenant, Ian Gilmour, later called \"the most distinguished backbencher since Richard Cobden\" the Victorian apostle of free trade.\n\nBut his style, never light, underlined the impression that he was sulking. Even his jokes had a habit of sounding like pomposity or bad temper to those who did not know him. Often they were self-deprecating, albeit disguised.\n\nFor many years he invited a group of political reporters to dinner on the eve of the Tory conference, at Salisbury in the south or the Riverside hotel at Poulton-le-Fylde when the conference was in Blackpool. He may have had half an eye on the good opinion of posterity, but it was also generous. Reporters in their 30s could hear, firsthand of that brush with Hitler's arm.\n\n\"I am very good with widows,\" Heath would say. Certainly his later career, despite his many frustrations and disappointments, was neither lonely nor friendless. Lady Soames and Lady Woolf, the widow of his chief of staff, were among many who stayed loyal.\n\nAnd if there had never been a wife to console his solitude there was always music. He was still to be found at the Salzburg annual music festival until 2003.\n\nHeath claimed to have visited every country in the world except North Korea, Bolivia and Paraguay. In many countries he was treated rather more respectfully than at home, where his candour was redefined as petulance by his critics\n\nHe remained determined that he would be vindicated, until close to the end.\n\n· Edward Richard George Heath, politician, born July 9 1916; died July 17 2005."
