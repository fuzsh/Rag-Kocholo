Vilsack was confirmed as the 32nd United States Secretary of Agriculture on Feb. 23, 2021 by the U.S. Senate. He was nominated by President Joe Biden to return to a role where he served for eight years under President Barack Obama.\n\nUnder Secretary Vilsack’s leadership, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is building back better by restoring the American economy, strengthening rural and historically underserved communities, responding to threats of climate change, creating good-paying jobs for American workers and the next generation of agricultural leaders, and investing in our kids and our families.\n\nSecretary Vilsack is spearheading a transformation of the food system by creating more, better, and fairer markets and ensuring that the food system of today and the future is more resilient and more competitive globally. It will also offer consumers affordable, nutritious food grown closer to home.\n\nFrom excessive drought to more extreme fires, our producers, farmers and ranchers are on the frontlines confronting the challenges associated with climate change. USDA is engaging the agriculture and forestry sectors in voluntary, incentive-based climate solutions to improve the resiliency of producers and to build wealth that stays in rural communities. Additionally, USDA is advancing investments in science and research to offer producers a toolbox to adapt to and mitigate climate change.\n\nSecretary Vilsack continues to take bold, historic action to reduce barriers to access for historically underserved communities. By working to ensure all aspects of civil rights and equity are integrated, USDA is rooting out generations of systemic racism and building systems and programs inclusive of all USDA employees and customers.\n\nSecretary Vilsack is also focused on ensuring Americans have consistent access to safe, healthy, and affordable food. USDA is investing in bold solutions that enhance food safety, improve the various far-reaching and powerful nutrition programs in the Department, and reduce food and nutrition insecurity in America.\n\nVilsack was the longest-serving member of President Obama’s original Cabinet. Prior to his appointment, he served two terms as the Governor of Iowa, served in the Iowa State Senate and as the mayor of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa.

As Secretary, he will carry out President Biden's vision to build a healthy America, and his work will focus on ensuring that all Americans have health security and access to healthcare.\n\nThroughout his career, the Secretary has made it his priority to ensure that Americans have access to the affordable healthcare they need to survive and thrive - from his early days as a legal advocate representing individuals with mental illness, to his role as the Attorney General of the state of California.\n\nSecretary Becerra served 12 terms in Congress as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. During his tenure, he was the first Latino to serve as a member of the powerful Committee on Ways and Means, he served as Chairman of his party's caucus, and as the Ranking Member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Health.\n\nFor over two decades in Congress, Secretary Becerra worked so that every family had the assurance of care that his own family had when he was growing up. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Secretary Becerra introduced legislation -- the Medicare Savings Programs Improvement Act of 2007 -- that expanded cost-sharing subsidies for low-income seniors who receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits by increasing the amount of resources they could receive. He championed provisions of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 that required physicians who perform imaging to be accredited and trained to ensure patient safety. And he was one of the original cosponsors of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) which strengthened Medicare and lowered costs for seniors.\n\nAs Attorney General of the state of California, Secretary Becerra helped to promote competition by taking on a number of pharmaceutical companies that restricted competition through \"pay-for-delay\" schemes, held several companies accountable for legal violations for not protecting patients' health information, and took action early in the pandemic to keep Californians safe by using his authority to protect workers from exposure to COVID-19, secure key safeguards for frontline health care workers' rights, and take on fraudsters trying to take advantage of people during the pandemic. In addition, he cracked down on Medicare and Medicaid fraud, acted to combat the opioid crisis, including holding drug makers accountable, won an unprecedented $575 million antitrust settlement against one of the largest health systems in California, and he led the three-year federal court fight to save the ACA and with it, the protections of the 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions.\n\nBorn in Sacramento Secretary Becerra is the son of working-class parents. He was the first in his family to receive a four-year degree, earning his Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Stanford University. He earned his Juris Doctorate from Stanford Law School.

Senator Stabenow also prioritized hunger and nutrition issues throughout the COVID pandemic, establishing important programs like Pandemic EBT, ensuring all children had access to school meals and increasing access to SNAP and WIC for families in need of assistance.\n\nSenator Stabenow established the first nationwide nutrition incentive initiative in the 2014 Farm Bill, modeled after Michigan’s successful Double Up Bucks. The 2018 Farm Bill made the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program permanent, adding produce prescriptions and creating the Nutrition Incentive Hub. Senator Stabenow will continue this leadership role in nutrition matters as Congress considers a new Farm Bill in the coming year.\n\nCory Booker — United States Senator, State of New Jersey\n\nCory Booker believes that the American dream isn’t real for anyone unless it’s within reach of everyone. Booker has dedicated his life to fighting for those who have been left out, left behind, or left without a voice.\n\nBooker grew up in northern New Jersey and received his undergraduate degree from Stanford University. At Stanford, Booker played varsity football, volunteered for the campus peer counseling center, and wrote for the student newspaper. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and went on to study at the University of Oxford, and then Yale Law School, where he graduated in 1997.\n\nAfter graduating law school, Booker moved to Newark and started a nonprofit organization to provide legal services for low-income families, helping tenants take on slumlords. In 1998, Booker moved into the Brick Towers housing project in Newark, where he lived until its demolition in 2006. Booker still lives in Newark’s Central Ward today, where the median household income is less than $15,000.\n\nAt 29, Booker was elected to the Newark City Council, where he challenged the city’s entrenched political machine and fought to improve living conditions for city residents, increase public safety, and reduce crime.\n\nStarting in 2006, Booker served as Newark’s mayor for more than seven years. During his tenure, the city entered its largest period of economic growth since the 1960s. In addition, overall crime declined and the quality of life for residents improved due to initiatives such as more affordable housing, new green spaces and parks, increased educational opportunities, and more efficient city services.\n\nIn October 2013, Booker won a special election to represent New Jersey in the United States Senate. In November 2014, Senator Booker was re-elected to a full six-year term.\n\nAs New Jersey’s junior Senator, Cory Booker has brought an innovative and consensus-building approach to tackling some of the most difficult problems facing New Jersey and our country. He has emerged as a national leader in the effort to fix our broken criminal justice system and end mass incarceration, helping craft the most sweeping set of criminal justice reforms in a generation, the First Step Act, which became law in December 2018. Booker has also worked to reform America’s broken food system, address our nation’s nutrition crisis, and end food insecurity.\n\nBooker sits on the Judiciary Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and the Small Business Committee.\n\nMike Braun — U.S. Senator, State of Indiana\n\nMike Braun is honored to represent the state of Indiana in the U.S. Senate. Mike is a conservative who is proud to work toward creating. great American jobs, building a strong national defense, reducing the debt and deficit, and helping our veterans.\n\nIn the Senate, he serves on the Aging Committee, Agriculture Committee, Budget Committee, Appropriations Committee, and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP).\n\nBefore Braun’s historic victory in 2018, he was the founder and CEO of Meyer Distributing, a company he built in his hometown of Jasper that employs hundreds of Americans across the country.\n\nMike graduated from Jasper High School in 1972, where he served as senior class president and lettered in football, basketball, and track. Mike went on to graduate from Wabash College where he earned an economics degree, graduated summa cum laude, and served as President of the Student Body. In 1976, Mike married his high school sweetheart Maureen and entered Harvard Business School, earning an M.B.A. in 1978.\n\nAfter graduation, Mike took a different path than many of his classmates and moved back to Jasper to start his career. In 1979, he co-founded Crystal Farms, Inc. which later became one of the largest turkey operations in the Midwest.\n\nAfter starting at Meyer Body Company in 1981 and eventually acquiring full ownership, Mike transitioned from the manufacturing sector to the distribution markets, forming Meyer Distributing. Since then, Meyer has grown to be among the industry leaders in auto parts distribution. Under Mike’s leadership, Meyer survived the 2008 financial collapse and came out a stronger company, averaging 22 percent growth since 2009.\n\nToday, Meyer is a nationwide contender in the third-party logistics business. Throughout the massive expansion of his business, Mike has always remained grounded to his roots by anchoring the company in Jasper. Mike is proud of his decision to build his businesses in his hometown, and today three of his four children work in the family business.\n\nThroughout the years, Mike has always looked for ways to give back to his community and serve his fellow Hoosiers, such as serving as a member of the local School Board and as a State Representative in 2014. Mike is an avid outdoorsman and enthusiastic mushroom hunter every spring.\n\nAs a State Representative, Mike has partnered with conservative leaders like Vice President Mike Pence to deliver results for Hoosiers. The 2016 Indiana General Assembly was ranked as the most conservative legislative body in the country.\n\nChairwoman Rosa DeLauro — U.S. Congresswoman, CT-03\n\nRosa DeLauro is the Congresswoman from Connecticut’s Third Congressional District, which stretches from the Long Island Sound and New Haven to the Naugatuck Valley and Waterbury. Rosa serves as the Chair of the House Appropriations Committee and the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, where she oversees our nation’s investments in education, health, and employment.\n\nAs a Member of Congress, she is fighting to make sure Americans can get ahead and stay ahead for generations to come by enacting policies that lower the cost of living, drive down energy costs, cut the cost of healthcare premiums and prescription drugs, help families keep food on the table, and cut taxes for working families while ensuring the largest corporations pay taxes.\n\nRosa has made fighting for Connecticut’s working families her central mission. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, people were struggling to keep up with skyrocketing costs for healthcare, housing, food, gas, and education. Families continue to live paycheck to paycheck because of inflationary pressure and stagnant wages while big corporations and billionaires use their money to rig the game. Rosa believes this amounts to a daily assault on every day working people.\n\nRosa believes that our priority must be to strengthen the economy and create good middle class jobs. She supports tax cuts for working- and middle-class families and led the fight to expand the Child Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan to provide tax relief to millions of families in the form of monthly payments that helped many families keep food on the table and cover the rising costs of everyday life. The expanded and improved Child Tax Credit drove the largest decrease in the child poverty rate in history. Moreover, Columbia University’s Center for Poverty and Social Policy found these monthly payments strongly reduced food insufficiency, leading to a 25 percent decline in food insufficiency among low-income households. Rosa first introduced legislation to expand and improve the Child Tax Credit in 2003. As Chair of the Food Safety Caucus, and former Chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), agriculture, and nutrition programs, Rosa has made ending hunger in the U.S. and bettering food safety across industries and the federal government a central mission. As Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, she fought for the expansion of the SNAP program and for an extension of free school meals for children throughout the pandemic. And, in response to the recent infant formula shortage, she introduced several bills to prevent a similar crisis in the future; restock the shelves with safe formula; and give the federal government the tools it needs to ensure foods that make it to market are safe.\n\nChairman James McGovern — U.S. Congressman, MA-02\n\nU.S. Congressman James P. McGovern was first elected to Congress in 1996, and represents Massachusetts’ 2nd Congressional District, which includes his hometown of Worcester as well as much of Central and Western Massachusetts.\n\nIn 2019, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named him the Chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, which serves as the traffic cop of Congress, deciding which bills and amendments come to the floor for debate and how they will be considered.\n\nMayor Eric Adams — New York City\n\nLike so many New Yorkers, Mayor Eric Adams grew up with adversity—and overcame it.\n\nAs one of six children, born in Brownsville and raised in South Jamaica by a single mom who cleaned houses, Eric and his family did not always know if they would come home to an eviction notice on the front door or food on the table. And when he was beaten by police in the basement of a precinct house at 15, Eric faced a life-changing act of injustice.\n\nBut instead of giving into anger, Eric turned his pain into purpose and decided to change the police department from within. He joined the NYPD and became one of its most outspoken officers, calling out racism and bias in the department and pushing for major reforms.\n\nAs a founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, Eric would often police the streets in a bulletproof vest one day during the high-crime 1980’s and 1990’s and protest bad behavior by cops the next, marching side-by-side with his fellow civil rights advocates. He rose to the rank of captain, helping to build the first computerized system for tracking crime in the city, which led to historic gains in public safety.\n\nEric’s efforts to change policing began his lifelong work to improve and protect New York. From the NYPD, he moved on to the State Senate, where he represented sections of central and Brownstone Brooklyn. In Albany, Eric built winning coalitions to advance New York City’s values and goals, helping to push through measures to protect tenants and workers, combat gun violence, end the NYPD’s abuses of stop and frisk, and advance human rights — including marriage equality. He also became the first person of color to chair the Senate’s Homeland Security Committee.\n\nEric was then elected Brooklyn Borough President in 2013 by putting together a diverse coalition of Brooklynites to become the borough’s first Black leader. As the representative of one of the nation’s largest counties, Eric fought tirelessly to grow the local economy, invest in schools, reduce inequality, improve public safety, and advocate for smart policies and better government that delivers for all New Yorkers.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic struck the city, Eric moved a mattress into his office and worked around the clock to deliver donated meals and PPE to essential workers and vulnerable New Yorkers, demanding government produce more equitable relief.\n\nIn addition to continuing to fight for struggling New Yorkers and a better quality of life for all, Eric became a national leader on public health policy after learning he had developed Type 2 diabetes. Following his diagnosis, Eric completely changed his diet and his body, reversing the disease and launching a personal mission to educate New Yorkers about preventative care and wellness. His work has already led to successful proactive public health efforts across the city and increased education in schools and with high-risk populations in lower-income areas, partnering with civic organizations and health experts.\n\nEric is a lifelong New Yorker. He received his master’s degree in public administration from Marist College, and is a graduate of New York City Technical College and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He is also a proud product of New York City public schools, including Bayside High School in Queens. Today he lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where he has resided for over 20 years. Eric is the proud father of Jordan, an aspiring filmmaker and graduate of American University.\n\nChef José Andrés — Founder, World Central Kitchen\n\nJosé Andrés is a cook.

In 2010, Andrés formed World Central Kitchen (WCK), a non-profit which uses the power of food to nourish communities and strengthen economies in times of crisis. His team served over 4 million meals to the people of Puerto Rico following Hurricane María. Since then, WCK has activated on six continents, serving hundreds of millions of fresh meals in the aftermath of both natural and manmade disasters. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization partnered with thousands of restaurants, farmers, and community leaders around the country to combat food and nutrition insecurity, laying the groundwork for smarter national food policy—one which builds longer tables in the U.S. and around the world. Currently, Andrés and World Central Kitchen oversee the world’s single largest humanitarian food response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPanel 1A: Nourishing Brighter Futures: Ensuring affordable food for all children and families\n\nMike Curtin, Moderator\n\nMike is the CEO DC Central Kitchen (DCCK), the country’s first community kitchen.
