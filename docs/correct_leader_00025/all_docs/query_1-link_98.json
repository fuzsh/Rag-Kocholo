His father was later a successful small businessman. At the age of four, Teddy welcomed a baby brother to the family, John, but Teddy remained the favored brother.\n\nEdward was educated at Chatham House Grammar School in neighboring Ramsgate, and in 1935 with the aid of a county scholarship he went up to study at Balliol College, Oxford, where he became a leader in student polities.\n\nTeddy soon shortened his name to Ted. A talented musician, he had tried for a scholarship at St. Catherine's College Cambridge, and Keble College.

During his time at college, Ted took a keen interest in politics and joined the Conservative Party. His first paper speech at the Oxford Union, in the Michaelmus term of 1936, wads in opposition to the appeasement of Germany by returning her colonies, confiscated during the First World War.\n\nBy June of 1937, Ted had been elected President of the Oxford University Conservative Association as a pre-Spanish-Republic candidate. Between 1937-8, during his 3rd year at university, he was chairman of the National Federation of University Conservative Associations, and later Secretary and then Librarian of the Oxford Union. At the end of 1938. he was defeated for the presidency of the Oxford Union by a fellow Balliol candidate, Alan Wood, on the issue of whether the Chamberlain government should give way to the left-wing Popular Front. Ted supported the government on this issue. His final year at university, Ted was president of Balliol College Junior Common room, an office held later by contemporaries Denis Healey and Roy Jenkins.\n\nEdward spent late 1939 to early 1940 on a debating tour of the United States before being called up. On 22nd March 1941, he received an emergency commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. During the war he initially served with heavy anti-aircraft guns around Liverpool, and by early 1942 was a regimental adjutant with the war substantive rank of captain.
