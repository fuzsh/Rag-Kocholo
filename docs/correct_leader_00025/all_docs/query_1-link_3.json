Located within Salisbury’s magnificent Cathedral Close, the house is one of Salisbury’s most charming destinations.\n\nSir Edward bequeathed Arundells to the Charitable Foundation set up in his name following his death in 2005. He very much wanted as many people as possible to “share the beauty of Arundells” and to enjoy his diverse and very personal collection of art work, photographs, sailing memorabilia and political cartoons.\n\nWe do hope that you will enjoy your visit."
