        "text": "The police report on claims that Sir Edward Heath sexually abused children has produced a chronology of seven main allegations against him.\n\nHeath, who died in 2005, was prime minister between 1970 and 1974 and led the Conservative party from 1965 until he was ousted by Margaret Thatcher in 1975.\n\nPolice said the allegations would have led to Heath being interviewed under caution. None relate to his time as prime minister.\n\nThese are the allegations and the positions Heath held at the time:\n\n1961 Heath allegedly raped and indecently assaulted an 11-year-old boy during a paid sexual encounter in private in a dwelling. At the time Heath was MP for Bexley and Lord Privy Seal in Harold Macmillan’s government with responsibility for negotiating the UK’s first attempt to join the European Economic Community.\n\n1962 While Heath was still Lord Privy Seal, he allegedly indecently assaulted a 10-year-old boy during a chance encounter in a public place while in the company of an unknown adult male.\n\n1964 While secretary of state for industry, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted a 15-year-old boy during three paid sexual encounters. Heath was made Tory party leader a year later.\n\n1967 Two years after becoming leader of the oppositon, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted a 15-year-old boy who was not known to him, in private, during a chance encounter in a public building.\n\n1976 A year after being ousted as Tory leader, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted an adult male during a chance encounter at a public event. The alleged incident was “over clothing”, according to the police. Heath was MP for Sidcup at the time.\n\n1990-92 While MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted a boy in private, during a chance encounter in private gardens. The boy, who was aged between 12 and 14, was not known to him. But the report says investigators “gathered information that potentially undermines the victim’s account”.\n\n1992 Then father of the House of Commons, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted an adult man after consent was withdrawn, in what had been a paid consensual sexual encounter in a hotel.\n\nThe report gave no more specific details about the individual allegations. It said more details could compromise the anonymity of the victims and “inadvertently lead to an inference as to the guilt or otherwise of Sir Edward Heath”."
