        "text": "Arundells Housse Curator Craven making an explanation\n\nSalisbury is a small city with a population of 40 thousand in Wiltshire, Southern England. The famous Salisbury Cathedral is situated right at the city centre. 59 Cathedral Close, a typical English garden villa, is the home of Sir Edward Heath, the former British Prime Minister.\n\nSir Edward Heath was by any measure a legend. Born into a carpenter's family, he became the President of Oxford University Student Union. An active fighter against appeasement before WWII, he joined the army when the war broke out and participated in the Normandy Landings. When the war was over, he served as a public servant and then a banker. He was elected to the Parliament at the age of 34 and served in the Parliament for 51 years. He began sailing when he was nearly 50, won the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race a few years later, and also captained Britain's winning team for the Admiral's Cup. Having a passion for music, he not only played the piano well, but also published books on music and conducted professional symphony orchestras. From 1970 to 1974 during his tenure as the British Prime Minister, he led Britain into the European Economic Community and established diplomatic relations with China at the ambassadorial level. From 1974 to 2001, he visited China 26 times and was awarded \"People's Friendship Envoy\" which is the highest honour of people-to-people diplomacy that China gives to a foreigner. In 2005, this \"old friend of the Chinese people\" passed away at his home in Salisbury. As he never married, Arundells House is maintained by the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation managed by his lifelong friends and former staff members. Opening from Spring to Autumn, the House and Gardens have by far received 15,000 visitors.\n\nAt the invitation of Lord Hunt, a good friend of Sir Heath, Ambassador Liu Xiaoming visited Arundells House, which is more than 2 hours' drive from London, on the morning of 10 July to pursue the legendary life of this \"old friend\" and the historical memories of his devotion to China-UK relations.\n\nThis was not an ordinary visit though.\n\nAmbassador Liu brought dozens of photos thoughtfully selected by the Chinese Embassy which record both the precious moments of Sir Edward Heath's contacts with China over nearly 30 years and historic moments in the development of China-UK relationship for the past 40 years and more since its establishment at ambassadorial level in 1972. These photos will be on display at Arundells House for two weeks and then become part of the House's collection. Ambassador Liu came to open this photo exhibition.\n\nMore than 30 people were waiting at the gate when Ambassador Liu arrived, including several trustees, staff members of Arundells House, local friends and Chinese and British press. As he walked into the House, Ambassador Liu wrote down the following words in the guest book:\n\n\"Sir Edward Heath,\n\nA larger-than-life legend,\n\nA pioneer of China-UK friendship,\n\nAn all-time inspiration.\"\n\nMany people, many of whom were Sir Edward Heath lifelong friends, nodded and were deep in thought at these words. Perhaps each of them has a special impression of Heath in their hearts.\n\nAmbassador visited the House accompanied by Stuart Craven, Manager/Curator at Arundells and former assistant to Sir Edward Heath. This is a centuries-old house of two stories. The models and pictures of the 5 sailing boats Sir Edward Heath drove and the trophies are on display in the sailing showroom on the ground floor which proves the owner's passion for sailing. To the left of the room is a guestroom in which there is a Steinway grand piano. The fallboard has been lifted as if the owner of the House may come to play it at any time. On the piano are photos of the owner with political leaders of other countries and signed photos the owner received as gifts. The photos taken with Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders are in the front row.\n\nAmbassador Liu delivering a speech Lord Hunt delivering a speech\n\nThe works by many famous painters are hung on both sides of the corridor outside of the guestroom. As introduced by the Curator, Sir Edward Heath's favorite paintings are the two works by Prime Minister Churchill. One of them is hung opposite to the entrance of the dining room, so that it may be seen at all meal times.\n\nSir Edward Heath's study and office are located on the ground floor and the first floor respectively. Both of them embody the owner's love for music and painting and are faced with a two-acre garden. What is worth mentioning is that the walls along the staircase between the ground floor and the first floor are covered with hand-drawing wallpapers bought in Beijing in the 1990s featuring the Monkey King's \"Uproar in Heaven\". Although more than 20 years have passed, these wallpapers still impress the visitors with their rich colours and vivid figures.\n\nThroughout the visit, Ambassador Liu asked a lot of questions to Curator Stuart Craven. He not only enabled the Curator to recall more past stories of Sir Edward Heath, but also offered many details about China that the Curator did not know. It was a fruitful experience for both the guests and the host.\n\nSoon it was noon. Accompanied by Lord Hunter, Ambassador Liu came to the backyard of Arundells House to deliver a speech to the Chinese and foreign guests present at the opening ceremony of the photo exhibition. In his opening remarks, Ambassador Liu said he was very pleased to visit this picturesque Arundells House. He said he read a story that one visitor once marveled at the beauty of Arundells and said to Sir Edward Heath: \"This must be one of the ten most beautiful views in Britain\". He replied: \"Why, what are the other nine?\" There was an understanding laughter among the audience.\n\nNext, Ambassador Liu recalled Sir Edward Heath's life and the historic contributions he made to the development of China-UK relations, and he looked back at Premier Li Keqiang's recent visit to the UK and the tremendous achievements the two countries made in trade, investment and people-to-people exchanges. Then he said, as an old Chinese saying goes: \"When drinking the water, you should not forget those who dug the well.\" In that spirit China never forgets the contribution of old friends. We owe today's China-UK relationship to many old friends. These include: British business leaders 60 years ago who broke the economic ice; British political leaders represented by Sir Edward Heath who broke the political ice; and true supporters here have never ceased their efforts for a single day to promote China-UK friendship and cooperation.\n\nAmbassador Liu said, in the era of globalisation, China's links with the rest of the world are becoming ever closer. China has made many new friends in different countries and different sectors. But we have not, and will never forget old friends in the UK. They made historic contribution to China's development, to China-UK relations and to connecting China with the rest of the world. He expressed the hope that this visit will go further to generate interest among Chinese and British young people. He wants them to visit this beautiful part of England to recall the past memories in China-UK friendship and join in the cause of China-UK friendship and cooperation.\n\nThe audience was deeply touched by Ambassador Liu's remarks. Lord Hunter talked about his experience as a young man when he was encouraged and instructed by Sir Edward Heath to engage in politics. Also talking about the huge development of China-UK relations, he echoed Ambassador Liu's view of bringing the younger generation on board.\n\nWhen the speeches were over, Ambassador Liu and Lord Hunter signed and exchanged the picture album celebrating the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the UK and the Autobiography of Sir Edward Heath. The guests talked about friendship by the beautiful River Avon. Accompanied by June Osborne, Dean at Salisbury Cathedral and the friends from the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, Ambassador Liu laid flowers and observed a moment of silence in front of Sir Edward Heath's tomb, paying tribute to this legendary \"old friend of the Chinese people\".\n\nThe trip to Salisbury took more than 10 hours all together. However, in spite of the travel fatigue, the trip enriched people's understanding about Sir Edward Heath, showed the Chinese people's tradition of \"making new friends without forgetting old ones\", and added more Chinese elements to Arundells House. We believe that more and more people will be attracted to cherish the memory of old friends and carry forward the friendship."
