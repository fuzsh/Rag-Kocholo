DESCRIPTION

The Newcastle Rebels came into the NSWRL competition in 1908 with not much expectation. They had the disadvantage of travel every second week to Sydney although minimised by the game locations. One man stood out in the Newcastle team every week with great performances and toughness to inspire his fellow players. Jerry Bailey scored a single game high club record of points for the club in his time with the Rebels. Regarded as one of the fathers of Newcastle rugby league Jerry Bailey played representative football for Newcastle Rebels, Northern Division, NSW Country 1sts, NSW Firsts and Australia and was an inaugural Kangaroo to tour Great Britain in 1908. A true champion, honest, strong and a great leader.
