The New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) is a Rugby League competition based in New South Wales, with two teams from Victoria.

History[]

The NSWRL was formed in 1908 as the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL, Football was dropped from the name in 1978). The first ever season consisted of nine teams; Balmain, Cumberland, Eastern Suburbs, Glebe, Newcastle, Newtown, North Sydney, South Sydney and the Western Suburbs. Cumberland were the least successful, they had only won one game, and were disbanded at the end of the year, bringing the number of teams back to 8. In 1909, Newcastle quit the NSWRFL to compete in the Newcastle Rugby League. They were replaced by Brisbane in 1910. In 1920, the competition expanded, adding Sydney University, a team made up of the best players from Sydney Uni, and St. George a year later. Due to declining results and popularity in the club, Glebe were removed in 1929. They were replaced by Queensland University. Manly-Warringah and West Brisbane joined in 1947. The year after, both University clubs were removed. Again, in 1967 the league expanded, this time, adding Cronulla-Sutherland and Fortitude Valley. The competition wanted to add more teams from outside Sydney and Brisbane, so Illawarra and Newcastle were added in 1982. The 1990's was where the league started to really expand. The NSWRL decided to relocate and merge some of the smaller Sydney clubs that were struggling at the time. A merge between Eastern and Western Suburbs called Sydney United was proposed for 1991, but never took place. The NSWRL tried to do the same with North and South Sydney, but it also failed. In 1993, Manly-Warringah packed up and moved to Gosford, becoming the Gosford Sea Eagles. The NSWRL were desperate to add a Gold Coast team to the competition in the late 90's, with Western Suburbs, Cronulla and North Sydney all being considered. In 1997, after three seasons of poor results, the Western Suburbs Magpies moved to Gold Coast. In 1999, with the money from TV coming in, the NSWRL was finally out of its dark age. In 2000 a deal was struck to add two Victorian teams to the competition to promote the game down south. In 2001, the Melbourne Storm joined the NSWRL, followed by the Ballarat Diggers in 2002. While both teams have been popular and successful, people in Victoria hate them, along with Rugby League as a sport, giving it a strong link with their enemy country.
