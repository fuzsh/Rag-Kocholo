        "text": "A battle for independence from Indonesia has raged in the western half of Papua. Photo: EPA PHOTO\n\nSeparatist rebels in Indonesia's easternmost region of Papua have killed a helicopter pilot from New Zealand after he landed his aircraft in a remote area, authorities say, adding four other passengers on board were safe.\n\nCreate a free account to read this article\n\n$ 0/\n\n(min cost $ 0 )\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nThe pilot was killed immediately on Monday after rebels rounded up those on board after the helicopter landed in a field in the Alama district in the Central Papua province, said Bayu Suseno, a spokesman for the joint Indonesian police-military operations in Papua, citing a witness.\n\nThe motive for the killing was not immediately clear.\n\nIt comes nearly 18 months after the abduction by separatists of another pilot from New Zealand, Phillip Mehrtens, who remains in captivity.\n\nNew Zealand's foreign ministry said it was aware of the report and its embassy in Jakarta was seeking information from authorities, declining to comment further.\n\nThe incident follows the abduction of another NZ pilot, Phillip Mehrtens, who's still in captivity. (AP PHOTO)\n\nThe rebel West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) said it had not received a report of the incident referred to by police and could not immediately confirm the killing of the pilot on Monday.\n\nA low-level battle for independence from Indonesia has long raged in the resource-rich western half of Papua, where attacks by independence fighters have grown deadlier and more frequent as they have procured better weaponry.\n\nBayu said the group responsible for Monday's incident was the same group currently holding Mehrtens.\n\nThe New Zealand government has repeatedly called for the immediate release of captured pilot Mehrtens, who was kidnapped on February 7, 2023, after he landed a small commercial plane in the remote, mountainous area of Nduga.\n\nThe rebels have previously released videos of Mehrtens seeking international mediation in talks between the rebels and Indonesian authorities, one with him surrounded by Papuan fighters.\n\nTPNPB spokesman Sebby Sambom said on Saturday the group had agreed to free Mehrtens but Indonesian security spokesman Bayu on Monday cast doubt on that, describing it as \"mere propaganda\".\n\nSebby did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that.\n\nAustralian Associated Press\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAd\n\nGet the latest Lismore news in your inbox\n\nSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.\n\nEmail address\n\nWe care about the protection of your data.
