        "text": "In our latest rugby transfers and rumours round-up, we take a look at Connacht’s latest signing as New Zealand Super Rugby clubs are raided while there is further turmoil in Australia.\n\nWith the Super Rugby season done and dusted, several rumoured transfers are being confirmed while there is still plenty of doubt around the futures of Melbourne Rebels’ stars following their collapse.\n\nChiefs lose star to Irish province\n\nIn a massive blow to the Chiefs and an equally positive one for Connacht, Josh Ioane has packed his bags for Galway, signing a deal for the 2024/25 season with the Irish province.\n\nThe talented fly-half/full-back has played over 70 Super Rugby matches during his spells with the Chiefs and the Highlanders, racking up over 300 points in the process.\n\nThe 28-year-old earned his maiden call-up to the All Blacks squad in 2019 and made his Test debut against Tonga off the bench in what proved to be his only international cap.\n\nHe has, however, featured for the Maori All Blacks and All Blacks XV and is eligible to represent Samoa again through his heritage.\n\nHe joins Connacht, who need cover at fly-half and full-back following the injury to JJ Hanrahan, who sustained an ACL injury in May.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Josh to Connacht next season. We were open about the need for additional depth at 10 following JJ’s injury, and in Josh, we have secured a player with a wealth of experience and an excellent skill set that will both excite our supporters and complement our existing backs,” Connacht boss Pete Wilkins said.\n\nUnited Rugby Championship ins and outs: The complete list of the 2024/25 player transfers\n\nHurricanes stars heads to Montpellier\n\nThe Hurricanes have lost star outside back Josh Moorby ahead of next season with the 26-year-old confirmed as one of Montpellier’s latest signings ahead of next season.\n\nIt’s long been rumoured that Moorby would be packing his bags for France and the move has now been officially confirmed with Montpellier also announcing the arrivals of Fijian centre Christa Powell and Maël Moustin.\n\nThese signings follow the controversial additions of Wilfrid Hountpatin, Mohamed Haouas, Billy Vunipola and Stuart Hogg, who have all recently had run-ins with the law.\n\nThe French club is looking to get back to its former glory after a torrid 2023/24 season where they narrowly avoided relegation.\n\nA change in coaching staff has also seen an overhaul of the playing squad with the aforementioned players joined by other new signings in Nika Abuladze, Nicolas Martins, Alex Bernadet, Domingo Miotti, Thomas Vincent and Madosh Tambwe.\n\n‘Tahs rebuffed by Rebels\n\nAccording to a report by Code Sports, as many as 11 Melbourne Rebels stars have snubbed the Waratahs’ advances ahead of the 2025 Super Rugby campaign.\n\nWith the Melbourne Rebels no longer a Super Rugby team, several players are on the market for new opportunities, and while many are still under contract with Rugby Australia, they have rejected a move to the Waratahs.\n\nTaniela Tupou, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, Rob Leota, Isaac Kailea, David Feluiai, Pone Fa’amausili, Darby Lancaster, Matt Gibbon, Lachie Anderson, Ethan Dobbins and Lukas Ripley have all reportedly rejected the Waratahs’ advances.\n\nThis is because of the state of the NSW club, who finished bottom of the table after winning just two of their 14 matches in 2024. Dan McKellar will be tasked with turning the club’s fortunes around along with Simon Raiwalui, but the two heavyweight coaching additions are seemingly not enough to persuade the Rebels’ players.\n\nAccording to the report, many players are even prepared to play club rugby instead for other reasons, including the cost of living in Sydney, and the want to stay closer to family.\n\nDan McKellar lands new gig after shock Leicester exit as he links up with ex-Fiji coach\n\nWallabies veteran links up with Will Skelton at La Rochelle\n\nEx-Wallabies lock Kane Douglas will pack down in the second-row with Will Skelton once again after signing a deal to join La Rochelle ahead of next season.\n\nThe 35-year-old lock has signed a one-year contract with Ronan O’Gara’s side after helping Bordeaux reach the Top 14 final during the 2023/24 season.\n\nThe experienced lock has played for the likes of the Reds, Waratahs and Leinster before his five-year stint at Bordeaux and will now link up with Skelton once again – who signed an extension with the French outfit until 2028."
