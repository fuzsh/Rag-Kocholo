        "text": "When the highly contentious LIV Invitational Series resumes in 2024, it will boast reigning Masters champion and world No 3-ranked Jon Rahm as the latest of golf’s most famous players who have signed up to play.\n\nRahm, a four-time winner on the 2023 PGA Tour, member of Europe’s Ryder Cup-winning team and prior critic of the LIV format, joins the league bankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund in a deal reportedly worth up to £450m.\n\nRumours had begun to swirl over the Spaniard’s future, including when he was notably absent from the line-up of golfers committed to the PGA Tour’s American Express stop in January, as well as withdrawing from the Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy-backed TGL league’s inaugural season last month.\n\nAnd despite admitting his decision to join LIV was a “risk” in terms of his future participation in the Ryder Cup – the 29-year-old will need to remain a member of the DP World Tour to be eligible for the biennial USA vs Europe showdown – Rahm told Fox News: “Things have changed a lot in the game of golf over the past two years and I’ve seen the growth of LIV Golf and the innovation.\n\n“That’s why I’m here today. This decision was made for many reasons and what I thought was best for me. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great deal.”\n\nThe 2024 LIV Golf schedule will feature 14 stops, including new events in Las Vegas, Houston and Nashville.\n\n2024 LIV Golf Schedule\n\n2-4 February: LIV Mayakoba — El Cameleon Country Club\n\n8-10 February: LIV Las Vegas — Las Vegas Country Club\n\n1-3 March: LIV Saudi Arabia — TBD\n\n8-10 March: LIV Hong Kong — Hong Kong Golf Club\n\n5-7 April: LIV “USA” — Location and course TBD\n\n26-28 April: LIV Adelaide — The Grange Golf Club\n\n3-5 May: LIV Singapore — The Serapong Golf Club\n\n7-9 June: LIV Houston — The Golf Club of Houston\n\n21-23 June: LIV Nashville — The Grove Golf Club\n\n12-14 July: LIV Andalucia — Real Club Valderrama\n\n25-28 July: LIV UK: Staffordshire — JCB Golf and Country Club\n\n16-19 August: LIV Greenbrier — The Old White Course at the Greenbrier\n\nTBD: LIV Golf Individual Championships\n\nTBD: LIV Golf Team Championships.\n\nWho played in the 2023 LIV Golf series and how did it work?\n\nThe financial package put forward by LIV Golf seduced Dustin Johnson, Lee Westwood, and Sergio Garcia from the get-go last year, with Phil Mickelson, Ian Poulter and plenty of others signing up soon after.\n\nMickelson was reportedly paid $200m (£159m) just for turning up, while Johnson, the top-ranked player to have joined so far, earning $150m (£119m). Johnson announced his resignation from the PGA Tour in order to concentrate fully on the new tournament fronted by former world No 1 Greg Norman, but the PGA has since suspended all players to have made the switch.\n\nBesides the eye-watering signing-on-fees, the prize money on offer is staggering. There is a $25m (£19.9m) purse to be split between the 48 players per tournament in the eight-event series, with the winner pocketing $4m (£3.2m) and the loser earning $120k (£95k).\n\nThe format is also very different from traditional majors. There are 54 rather than 72 holes for a start – “LIV” is 54 in Roman numerals – there is a “shotgun” start where players tee off at the same time, and golfers are grouped into teams of four.\n\nJohnson is captain of the “4 Aces”, Mickelson is leading the “Hy Flyers” and Poulter is affiliated to “Majesticks”.\n\nThe first 2022 tournament was held in England, with subsequent events taking place in Portland, Bedminster, Boston, Chicago, Bangkok, Jeddah and Miami.\n\nIn the build-up, players faced questions about “sportswashing” and whether Saudi Arabia is seeking to deflect attention from its human rights record by investing so heavily in the sport. Mickelson previously called the Saudis “scary motherf**kers” before backtracking.\n\n“I don’t condone human rights violations at all,” he said. “I’m certainly aware of what has happened with Jamal Khashoggi and I think it’s terrible. I have also seen the good that the game of golf has done throughout history and I believe LIV Golf is going to do a lot of good for the game as well.”\n\nGraeme McDowell said “we’re not politicians, we’re professional golfers,” in regards to the country’s human rights record and Talor Gooch responded “I’m a golfer, I’m not that smart”. Poulter and Westwood both said they would not answer “hypothetical questions” when asked whether they would have played in a tournament held by Vladimir Putin or in South Africa during Apartheid.\n\nFour-time major winner Brooks Koepka, former US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau and ex-Masters champion Patrick Reed signed up to the breakaway competition after the first event, while Paul Casey was also confirmed in early July.\n\nOpen champion Cameron Smith and Joaquin Niemann were then among a fresh wave of players unveiled by LIV Golf.\n\nThe 2023 series kicked off in Mayakoba in February, followed by tournaments in Tucson, Orlando, Adelaide, Singapore, Tulsa, DC, Valderrama, London, Greenbrier, Bedminster, Chicago, Miami and Jeddah.\n\n2023 LIV Golf players list A-Z\n\nHere are all 48 players who competed in the 14-event series in 2023.\n\nThere were 12 teams in total, with 13 major champions in the field, 16 nations represented, and a combined 125 Ryder Cup appearances.\n\nFour players – Dustin Johnson, Martin Kaymer, Brooks Koepka and Lee Westwood – have held the title of world No 1.

In Roman numerals it is 54 and the players in this new incarnation of golf kicking off in the exotic locale of Hemel Hempstead will play that many holes. Neat, huh?\n\nOf course, you might say that a new sporting franchise bolstered by limitless petrodollars would be expected to be creative with its branding.\n\nBut the new kid in town is a sign that golf is in desperate need of some love. Whether that love comes from a despotic regime with a dreadful record on human rights is something for Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Lee Westwood and, err, James Piot to ponder as they chase a ball around a course for a share of 20 mill a tournament.\n\nAnd if you put aside the ickiness of the Saudi regime behind Jamal Khashoggi’s killers providing the lipstick and mascara to the game, the concept of a quickfire bunch of tournaments with a set season and eight-figure sums of cash riding on each one sounds intriguing – even if the reason why players joined appears to be all about the money. Not that cold hard cash as a motivator is news, especially in the world of golf.\n\nThe rules are thus: everyone tees off at once. It is called a shotgun start, which sounds a little violent, given the paymasters, but I guess bonesaw start would have been too much. Twelve teams of four play in a match-play format, with individual members also competing in a strokeplay competition. There is no cut to miss. So far, so mildly diverting.\n\nHowever, toe-curlingly twee “Camden Market-style” stalls, a Craig David and Jessie J gig and Sporty Spice on the decks post-match does not sound like much of an answer to the organiser’s promise to “supercharge” golf."
