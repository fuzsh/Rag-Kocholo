It’s a roll of the dice no matter how good they’ve been over there. Oliver Gildart was an absolute stud over there but has slammed into a wall playing against NRL athletes.\n\nI can see KPP is very big and he looks to be skillful, we just won’t know if he can replicate that over here until if and when he suits up for us.\n\nIt’s a pretty highlights reel but I’m not sure I see anything in there which convinces me he’s obviously a better prospect than Nanai and Luki as was suggested in here earlier. And yeah I’m a little worried that he isn’t absolutely bursting through the line and scoring playing against little white guys over in England… I don’t think it’s that crazy a concern to have. Sione is taking souls over there and you wouldn’t call him an amazing athlete at NRL level\n\nAhem.\n\nI HAVE SPOKEN.\n\nUnless you’re calling me Harvstradumbass…\n\nThis sounds great, but have not been able to find any evidence in the Telegraph.\n\nPossible to put story evidence on this site HarVee?\n\nExtracts from SMH\n\nNearly half a dozen NRL clubs have expressed interest in signing the veteran front-rower for the 2023 season, but none can make Taupau a concrete offer until the NRL and Rugby League Players’ Association sign off on a new collective bargaining agreement.\n\nParramatta and Newcastle were two of clubs reportedly interested in signing Taupau before the World Cup. The Knights have lost David Klemmer to the Wests Tigers since then, while Eels coach Brad Arthur spoke glowingly of Taupau and how he would suit the club’s front-row rotation when first linked to the grand finalists in July.\n\nThe cap is expected to rise from $9.3m to $10.5m in 2023, but a large portion of the extra money made available will need to cover players on the minimum wage, whose salaries will rise from $80,000 to $150,000, as well as players on ratchet clauses whose deals increase in accordance with any increase in the cap.\n\nFive clubs want Marty Taupau. But they still don’t know how much they can pay him\n\nBig Marty Taupau is set to enter the new year without a deal, because interested clubs still have no idea how much they have to spend in the salary cap.\n\nLooks like we've signed a halfback named Ryan Rivett from the Sharks, originally from the Gold Coast. Already with us but not sure what type of deal it is. Will still be eligible for Jersey Flegg this season and was apparently meant to be one of the Sharks development players for 2022.\n\nJersey Flegg Cup 2022 Highlights | Ryan Rivett\n\nCatch up on all the best plays from Cronulla Sharks halfback Ryan Rivett in the Jersey Flegg Cup.\n\nLooks like we've signed a halfback named Ryan Rivett from the Sharks, originally from the Gold Coast.
