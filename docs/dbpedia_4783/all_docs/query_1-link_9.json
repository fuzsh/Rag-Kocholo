        "text": "You can take the boy out of Cessnock, but you can’t take the Coalfields town out of the lad.\n\nDespite everything he’s achieved in the game and beyond – from representing the Newcastle Knights to the Australian Kangaroos, from hosting his own Fox Sports show to appearing on his popular weekly radio program – Matty Johns’ heart still belongs in the Hunter.\n\nIt’s probably why he drove up from Sydney on Friday afternoon, took to the stage a couple of hours later with long-time mates Bill Peden and Jamy Forbes at the Tooheys Newcastle Rugby League (Real NRL) season launch, and then headed off just as quickly to fulfil his many other commitments.\n\n“I love coming home,” he admitted.\n\n“And, it was great to catch up with friends [today] and see a few familiar faces.\n\n“But, I always keep an eye on how the Cessnock Goannas are doing.\n\n“I still have an interest in local footy.\n\n“It’s a very strong competition as far as bush rugby league is concerned.\n\n“It is certainly going a lot better than 99% of other groups in the country area.\n\n“As we know, many of them are really struggling.\n\n“I think a part of the reason for that is so much has changed in recent years.\n\n“Young guys have more to do.\n\n“Plus, if you’re working on the tools all week, and you’re not getting paid much [to play], it’s a hard game to play these days.\n\n“When you add training obligations on top of everything else, time is a big factor – people don’t seem to have it anymore.\n\n“So, you tip your hat to those who still run around.”\n\nAfter a very brief stint with the Goannas, Johns made 176 appearances with his beloved Knights and 21 with the Cronulla Sharks.\n\nHe, and brother Andrew, led Newcastle to grand final glory in 1997, too.\n\nNine Tests for the Kangaroos and four State of Origin games for NSW was the icing on the cake.\n\nHowever, the 51-year-old still has fond memories of the Real NRL.\n\n“I played, while at school, and they were running a bit short in the reggies,” he told the Newcastle Weekly.\n\n“That’s right, it was a semi against Waratah-Mayfield, who used to be in the comp.\n\n“As I was walking into the ground, a bloke said: ‘Are you Gary’s (Johns) young fella?’\n\n“I replied: ‘Yeah’.\n\n“He said: ‘I worked in the mines and played against your dad’.\n\n“I thought that was nice, so we had a bit of a chat.\n\n“Then, in the first two minutes [of the match], he tried to rip my head off my shoulders.\n\n“So, I got an idea of what Newcastle Rugby League was about then.\n\n“My experience playing firsts at Cessnock?\n\n“I was 16.\n\n“If I recall, I played third grade, then half a game in reserves and went on in the last 30 seconds of firsts.\n\n“I thought ‘how good was that?’”\n\nAn astute and well-respected analyst, Johns firmly believes the Real NRL is a terrific “stepping stone” for higher aspirations.\n\nAnd, it’s something the Knights need to tap into as well.\n\n“I’ll admit, it is disappointing witnessing kids like Zac Hosking, Jock Madden, Hudson Young and Kurt Donoghoe, for example, running out for rival clubs,” he said.\n\n“The list is endless… it just keeps going.\n\n“But, with Peter Parr (director of football) back here now, I think that ‘local’ pathway will start again.\n\n“That’s been a big shortcoming for the Knights over the past 20 years… the disconnection between the region’s juniors and our seniors.\n\n“In the early days, it was a necessity because the club had no money.\n\n“So, if they didn’t cultivate the local juniors, they were stuffed.\n\n“I think, in 1998, we had three sides worth of Newcastle players spread throughout the competition – and doing well.\n\n“It’s really important we do that again.\n\n“I remember going to school and the Knights just had a presence every week throughout the Hunter.\n\n“We were training at the old Marist Brothers… and someone like David Waite (Newcastle head coach 1991-94) would be there.\n\n“He’d teach calls and explain the way we should do this and that.\n\n“That’s where you need to start.\n\n“It’s one thing not to get results at the top end, but it won’t change unless, right now, you look after the grassroots.\n\n“The Hunter, including Newcastle Rugby League, boasts a huge talent pool.”\n\nTooheys Newcastle Rugby League\n\nDenton Engineering Cup round one\n\nSaturday 24 March\n\n3pm: Wyong Roos v The Entrance Tigers (Morry Breen Oval)\n\nSunday 25 March\n\n3pm: Cessnock Goannas v South Newcastle Lions (Baddeley Park)\n\n3pm: Kurri Kurri Bulldogs v Maitland Pickers (Kurri Kurri Sportsground)\n\n3pm: Central Newcastle Butcher Boys v Macquarie Scorpions (St John Oval)\n\n3pm: Northern Hawks v Western Suburbs Rosellas (Tomaree Sportsground)\n\nBye: Lakes United Seagulls\n\nFor more sports stories:\n\nNewcastle Rebels send Dragons packing\n\nREAL NRL: Time for talk is over as 2023 season launched\n\nREAL NRL: Musgrove, Huff ‘double coup’ for Goannas"
