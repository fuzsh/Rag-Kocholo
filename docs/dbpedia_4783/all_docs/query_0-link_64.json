        "text": "It is hoped an inaugural New South Wales rugby sevens championship being held in Newcastle will further increase the burgeoning popularity of the sport.\n\nThe NSW Waratahs Men's Under-20s State Sevens Championship and Women's Open State Sevens Championship is being held this weekend at Number Two Sportsground.\n\nTwelve men's and four women's teams from around the state will compete in almost 50 matches over the two days.\n\nSeven teams from Sydney's premier Shute Shield competition will also play — sides that often springboard players into state and national rugby union teams.\n\n\"It's the first tournament, so we're going from ground zero,\" chair of the tournament's organising committee Mark Queenan said.\n\n\"It's a collaborative venture between NSW Rugby, Newcastle-Hunter Rugby Union, and the Hawthorne Club.\"\n\nRugby sevens leaves players with 'nowhere to hide'\n\nDaniel Martine, 20, only started playing rugby sevens at club level in Newcastle last year, and has since gone on to play with the NSW Waratahs.\n\nHe was originally playing rugby league before swapping codes.\n\n\"I honestly hadn't even heard of [rugby sevens] until about one year after starting rugby,\" Martine said.\n\n\"I just wanted a change. I was enjoying my league … so I thought I'd give it a try, and it's been good.\n\n\"If you're slow, or if you're not good at a particular aspect of it, you get caught out; whereas fifteens — you can hide a little bit.\"\n\nMartine said rugby sevens was growing in popularity, particularly after Australia's women's team won gold in the sport at the Rio Olympics.\n\n\"I think it's better to watch, better to play, better atmosphere,\" he said.\n\nState championship a vision of Hunter rugby administrators\n\nMark Queenan said the rugby sevens state championship was born out of an idea by Hunter-based rugby administrators Peter Sarroff and Bruce Cooke.\n\n\"Peter was very adamant that we needed to have a tournament in Newcastle to showcase our own talent and be at home,\" Mr Queenan said.\n\n\"He worked very hard with NSW Rugby to get this day sanctioned, and part of the sanctioning means we maintain it in the ARU sevens calendar; so it's a bit sacrosanct.\"\n\nHolding a women's tournament as part of the same event is seen by organisers as vital to ensuring the growth and longevity of the sport.\n\nWhile a final price tag for staging the tournament is yet to be fully determined, Mr Queenan said with people coming from around the state, it would boost the Hunter region's economy.\n\n\"Being two days, people will probably stay two nights and shop and invest,\" he said.\n\n\"The more important part is the profile of the city from a tourism aspect.\n\nOrganisers hope the championships will eventually become a marquee event in the city.\n\n\"We've not been in a position to seek sponsorship because we're not quite sure what the product is,\" Mr Queenan said.\n\n\"Next year when we have a better feel for it, I'm sure that we can do much better than what we'll do this time.\n\n\"I would certainly want to expand it into a rugby festival.\n\n\"My ideal into the future would be to have it as a four-day tournament including schools, and expand what we have from here.\""
