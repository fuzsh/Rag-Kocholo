        "text": "Join us at the Essex Sport Arena on Saturday 9 March as we celebrate International Women’s Day, a day dedicated to honouring the achievements and contributions of women worldwide. The day will be filled with not just basketball excellence but also a celebration of the remarkable women who continue to inspire us.\n\nWith the first game of the day, the Essex Rebels Women will take on Newcastle Eagles in the Women’s British Basketball League at 4pm followed by the NBL D1 Men facing Nottingham Hoods at 6.30pm.\n\nESSEX REBELS WOMEN VS NEWCASTLE EAGLES | WBBL | 4PM TIP-OFF\n\nThe Essex Rebels are gearing up to host the Newcastle Eagles in what promises to be an exciting matchup in the Women’s British Basketball League. As the current fourth seeds, the Rebels enter this contest riding high on a seven-game winning streak and will be looking to maintain momentum on home turf as they continue to showcase their talent on both ends of the floor.\n\nIn contrast, the Newcastle Eagles, currently sixth, will be determined to capitalise on their recent triumph, beating Nottingham Wildcats 72-69 on Saturday, to help them climb further up the rankings as the postseason approaches.\n\nWHAT COACH COOKSON HAS TO SAY:\n\n“We are excited to play on this very special occasion in front of our home crowd and be able to celebrate the amazing women. This will be a tough game, as Newcastle has been playing good basketball as of late. We have to lock in for 40 minutes to secure the win.”\n\nOPPOSITION FOCUSWHO ARE NEWCASTLE EAGLES?\n\nThe Newcastle Eagles, formerly known as Team Northumbria, have been an integral part of the Women’s British Basketball League since its inception. Ahead of the 2016-17 season, the team transitioned to officially become a part of the Newcastle Eagles Basketball Club. Previously, the team operated under the ownership of\n\nNorthumbria University at Newcastle, while having a formal partnership with the Newcastle Eagles during that time.\n\nThe team’s most notable achievement to date was clinching victory in the WBBL Play-Off final during the 2015-16 season, alongside securing a runner-up position in the 2020-21 season.\n\nFORM\n\nCurrently occupying the 6th spot in the league standings with a record of 5 wins and 8 losses, the Eagles have encountered their fair share of challenges and successes throughout the season. Having recently boosted their roster with new additions, the team is beginning to find their form of late. This resurgence makes the Eagles a team to watch out for and will present a real challenge to any opponent they face.\n\nLAST TIME OUT\n\nThe last time these two teams met was a month ago where the Rebels convincingly won 68-83. Standout performances from Darcy Rees and Kat Tudor powered the Rebels, with Rees notching 19 points and 10 rebounds for an impressive double-double, while Tudor contributed 16 points. On the Eagles’ side, Tierra Hodges led the charge with an impressive performance, recording 23 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nThe key player to watch for is team leading scorer, Tierra Hodges, averaging 22 points per game along with 8.7 rebounds. Hodges has been the main offensive threat for the visitors from Newcastle having become their best scorer since joining the team in December. Another player to keep an eye on is power forward, Marina Fernandez Pardo, averaging 11.6 points per game. Marina doesn’t shy away from a challenge having had some of her best performances of the season against the top teams in the league.\n\nESSEX REBELS D1 MEN VS NOTTINGHAM HOODS | NBL DIVISION 1 | 6:30PM TIP-OFF\n\nThe second game of the International Women’s Day special promises another exciting showdown as the Essex Rebels gear up to face off against the Nottingham Hoods in the National Basketball League Division 1. With both teams hungry for victory, this promises to be an intense battle on the court.\n\nThe Rebels enter the match sitting in 2nd place in the league standings, showcasing their toughness and determination throughout the season. However, coming off a hard-fought loss against City of Birmingham Rockets in their last home game, the Rebels will be eager to redeem themselves and get back to winning ways in front of the Rebels faithful.\n\nWHAT COACH NORFOLK HAS TO SAY:\n\n“We will be looking to bounce back after our tough loss last weekend. Last time out against Nottingham we went to overtime. We will need to lock into the details of their personnel and execute for 40 minutes”\n\nOPPOSITION FOCUS\n\nWHO ARE THE NOTTINGHAM HOODS?\n\nEstablished in 2009, the Nottingham Hoods are a semi professional basketball team based in Nottingham, England. They compete in the National Basketball League (NBL) Division 1, which is one of the top-tier leagues in the country.\n\nLAST TIME OUT\n\nThis will be the second encounter between the two teams, with the Rebels emerging victorious in their initial matchup with a scoreline of 111-119 on the road. In that game, three Rebels players recorded double-digit scores: Busumbru who led the team with 23 points, followed closely by Chapman and Nelson, both contributing 22 points each. On the Nottingham side, Guddemi emerged as the top scorer with 28 points.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nWith a very talented roster and 4 players averaging over 15 points per game, the Hoods have many weapons who can hurt the Rebels. However, the main offensive thread for the visitors, and someone the Rebels needs to control from the start of the game, is Landon Taliaferro who is averaging 21.3 points per game. Other players to keep an eye on are Skoric, averaging 16.8 points to go along with 10.5 rebounds per game, Guddemi with 16.5 points per game, and Campbell with 16.1 points and 7.2 assists per game.\n\nJoin us this Saturday for a day packed with action and celebrations as we honour women across the globe. Expect an atmosphere charged with energy and support for both teams as they take to the court."
