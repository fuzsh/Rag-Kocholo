        "text": "Struggling Super Rugby clubs shouldn’t hold their breath waiting for more money from head office, with Rugby Australia determined to stop spending beyond its means and ensure major revenue events in the next six years are used to fund the game long-term, not simply to pay off debt.\n\nThat was the bullish message from Rugby Australia boss Phil Waugh on Friday in response to increased anger from Super Rugby club bosses about a lack of funding, which culminated in a stinging attack in a leaked document from former Melbourne Rebels directors.\n\nThe Rebels were placed in voluntary administration this month after it emerged they owed as much as $20 million in debts, including to the Australian Tax Office and the Melbourne and Olympic Park Trust. Rugby Australia has taken back the Rebels’ licence and the club is under major pressure to survive in 2025 and beyond.\n\nA documented circulated this week, attributed to Rebels directors, slammed Rugby Australia for dishonest conduct in failing to restore an annual $1.7 million in funding cut during COVID.\n\n“RA treatment of Super Rugby and state members is so unreasonable as to be unconstitutional and unconscionable as it had been determined to destroy the current structure by under-funding SRL (Super Rugby licensee) members,” the document said.\n\nThough not in as dire a situation as the Rebels, other Super Rugby clubs are all under massive financial strain – and many in debt – due to the missing $1.7 million. The Super Rugby club salary cap is still at the pre-pandemic level of $5.5 million and clubs are obliged to spend at least 90 per cent under the CBA, but Rugby Australia’s annual funding was cut to $3.9 million. In a soft commercial market, frustrated club bosses say they’re battling to keep their heads above water.\n\nBut asked if he could assure Super Rugby clubs their funding levels will increase, Waugh said: “No, I can’t commit to that because it is a direct correlation to the decrease in broadcast revenue in the most recent and current broadcast arrangements. Whilst our funding decreased, our percentage of distribution of broadcast revenue increased significantly to our Super Rugby clubs.”\n\n“Ongoing from ’26 and beyond will be dependent on what our next cycle of broadcast delivers, to then what we can afford to pass through to our Super Rugby clubs.”\n\nIt is a statement sure to stoke anger in Super Rugby boardrooms, but Waugh said he was determined to be financially disciplined and not waste windfalls coming from the British and Irish Lions tour in 2025, and the 2027 and 2029 Rugby World Cups in Australia.\n\nAfter looking at private equity, Rugby Australia arranged a loan of $80 million late last year, and after paying down a previous loan, have around $50 million at their disposal.\n\n“If you look through at a credit facility being extended because of future revenue, my position as CEO and leading the organisation is that the worst possible outcome for rugby in Australia would be for us to get through a massive revenue event in the Lions, and an even bigger revenue event in the 27 Rugby World Cup, to then pay down the debt and be debt-free and that’s all – and then have an unsustainable model from 28 going forward,” Waugh said.\n\n“My vision for the game is how do we ensure we are stabilising the game now, we are debt-free or as close to debt-free after the British and Irish Lions and from ’26 onwards, we need to be in a sustainable model that is at least break-even whilst still investing in all our pathways and communities across the country – and then when we have the revenue events in ‘27 and ’29, we can actually set up a legacy fund that secures the game’s finances in perpetuity.\n\n“Clearly where we are at No.9 in the world [in the men’s Test rankings] and the system we have had in place for a long time, which has seen decline in performance due to that misalignment in the overall system, has been problematic and has led to where we are today.\n\n“I would love to give more money to the Super Rugby clubs but the reality is the money and the revenue at the top of the game is not there.”\n\nResponding to the suggestion RA could be party to some of the Rebels’ tax debt, Waugh said he was confident Rugby Australia had “paid what we are obliged and obligated to pay across all our agreements, which includes member unions, Super Rugby clubs and ATO requirements.”\n\nPreliminary conversations were had last year about a potential merger between the Rebels and the Auckland-based Moana Pasifika franchise, and while Waugh did not close a door on it being a future option, informed sources say logistical and financial complications make it highly unlikely.\n\nMelbourne fans have been angered to learn they still can’t buy tickets for the Rebels’ round one game, or new memberships, but Waugh said he hoped that could be resolved early next week once a new deal with the MOPT was struck.\n\nThe leaked Rebels document also claimed RA were acting unconstitutionally by not allowing member unions to inspect the governing body’s accounts, and in particular the details of the Wallabies budget last year, which was rumoured to have been blown by up to $5 million.\n\nWaugh said it had been agreed with clubs and member unions a two-person delegation will inspect RA’s accounts ahead of the AGM on April 29.\n\nThe budget blow-out was part of the Wallabies review conducted last year by former Test skipper Andrew Slack, RUPA boss Justin Harrison and consultant Darlene Harrison. The findings and recommendations have already been presented to the RA board, and Waugh said they would shared with the public soon, after plans on how to execute the recommendations could be bedded down with the new Wallabies coach and high-performance heads.\n\nWaugh conceded the Wallabies program had a “a larger spend than was budgeted” and indicated the total change in coaching staff, big numbers of travelling squads and, given the Wallabies are a major financial driver, a desire to chase success at the Rugby World Cup had been contributing factors.\n\nSYDNEY TO HOST TWO WALLABIES TESTS IN 14 DAYS\n\nThe Wallabies will play Georgia on home soil for the first time in July but face an uphill battle to sell tickets given the clash will be the second Test match in Sydney in 14 days.\n\nThe historic clash with Georgia, who are ranked No.14 in the world, will come after Joe Schmidt’s tenure as Wallabies coach begins in July with a two-Test series against Wales.\n\nThe Welsh haven’t toured Australia since 2012, when they lost 3-0, but Warren Gatland’s men had an emphatic last laugh at the 2023 Rugby World Cup, when they thumped the Wallabies by a record 40-6 scoreline to consign Eddie Jones’ side to a humiliating pre-finals exit.\n\nThe first clash against Wales will be at Allianz Stadium in Sydney as part of a double-header with a Wallaroos-Fiji Test match, and the second fixture will be at AAMI Park in Melbourne.\n\nGeorgia’s visit is part of a push from World Rugby for tier one nations to play developing nations more, and though the Lelos are a tough team to beat – as the Wallabies learned in a 35-15 win at the Rugby World Cup – Georgia are more known for their scrummaging than attacking flair.\n\nRugby Australia explored taking the game to a regional venue like Gosford or Newcastle but NRL games were already booked, and so scheduled the game at Allianz Stadium, just two weeks after the Wallabies meet Wales at the same venue. It is set to be played as an afternoon game, kicking off at 3pm.\n\nThat will see the Test match clash with club rugby, although informed sources with knowledge of the negotiations say Rugby Australia and the Sydney Rugby Union are in discussions about shifting Shute Shield games to Sunday or away from 3pm kickoffs.\n\nThere is also potential for a Shute Shield clash to be played as a curtain-raiser for the Wallabies-Georgia Test.\n\nThe Wallabies will host world champions South Africa for two Rugby Championship Tests in August, in Brisbane and Perth, before flying to Argentina for two Tests.\n\nThe final Rugby Championship game will see Sydney host its first Bledisloe Cup Test since 2020, with a clash against the All Blacks at Accor Stadium on September 21. The second Bledisloe Cup fixture will be a week later at Sky Stadium in Wellington.\n\nThe Wallaroos will play ten Tests in 2024 – and a record four of them on home soil – with Pacific Four Series clashes against Canada in Sydney on May 11 and the USA in Melbourne on May 17; the latter two being played as double-headers with Super Rugby fixtures.\n\n“To be able to host a double header in Sydney with both teams at Allianz Stadium will be a highlight on the Australian sporting calendar in 2024, while having the World Champion Springboks play two Tests here is a massive win for all Rugby supporters and sports fans in Australia.“\n\nAll three episodes of the brand new Stan Original Documentary Series The Wallabies - Inside Rugby World Cup 2023 premiere February 22, only on Stan."
