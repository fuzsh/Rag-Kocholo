        "text": "Queensland Reds have announced that Wallabies forward Lukhan Salakaia-Loto will be joining the club ahead of the 2025 season.\n\nHe now feels the likes of Josh Canham, Matt Gibbon, Filipo Daugunu and Lachie Anderson in the players to join the club ahead of the new season.\n\nSalakaia-Loto made his Wallabies debut in 2017 against South Africa in Bloemfontein and has featured in 32 Tests since then.\n\nA product of Queensland pathway, he made his senior debut with the Reds in 2016 and has 69 Super Rugby appearances for them. He also joined Melbourne Rebels in 2024 and featured for them in eight matches last season.\n\nHe also had represented Randwick, Northampton Saints and Brisbane City in the past.\n\n“To be back here in Brisbane and at Ballymore is unreal, especially with the way the Reds played this season,” Salakaia-Loto told the club's official website.\n\n“Having such strong connections to this place, I’m just grateful I could talk things through in a positive way with Les, Sam, the coaching staff, ‘Wrongaz’ (Liam Wright) and Tate (McDermott).\n\n“Hopefully, I can be a part of the Reds taking the next step next year. I know how hard the boys work here so it’s up to us to make it happen.”"
