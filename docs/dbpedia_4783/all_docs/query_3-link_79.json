We want the best squad we can and we want to represent Newcastle the best we can.\"\n\nThe Western Rams have never won a Country Championships but one of the strongest sides in a number of years reached the semi-finals last year.\n\nThey were beaten 46-18 at that stage by the Rebels, who went on to down Riverina 49-16 in the final.\n\nShould Western and the Rebels meet at any point again in 2024, there's the potential for a reunion with ex-PMP star Blake Ferguson.\n\nJosh Callinan\n\nSports Journalist, Newcastle Herald\n\nMy name is Josh Callinan and I'm a sports journalist at the Newcastle Herald.
