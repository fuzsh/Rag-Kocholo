Thanks.\n\nI was going for more that the NSWRL in 1986 was basically the same teams it had then but instead it's the NSWFL as rugby league doesn't exist in this alternate timeline and Aussie rules is as popular in NSW and QLD as it is in WA, SA and Vic.\n\nSo you've got the 13 teams from the NSWFL that existed from 1986 and the 12 VFL teams that existed in 1986 (in this timeline, South Melbourne still exists but barely). Both of the big two leagues are in financial trouble.\n\nI have no idea what the QAFL looked like in 1986 but just imagine it was as big as the WAFL and SANFL were. Then you've got the TSL which was no slouch in its day.\n\nFrom all of this, perhaps they decide to form a super league, none other than the AFL. It would have a maximum of 20 teams, forcing some ugly mergers and relocations to take place.\n\nI'd imagine the rationing of the teams would have been something like:\n\nNSW (8): I'm assuming 8 Sydney teams\n\nVIC (6): 5 Melbourne teams + Geelong\n\nQLD (4): 2 Brisbane teams + 2 Gold Coast teams\n\nWA (1): 1 Perth team\n\nSA (1): 1 Adelaide team\n\nA 20 team comp in 1987.\n\nBut then, over time, Tasmania, Canberra, New Zealand, the Northern Territory and North Queensland would join the league, plus second teams in WA and SA.\n\nSo mergers, relocations, and removals would have to occur. You'd end up with something like:\n\nNSW (5) 4 Sydney teams + 1 Newcastle team (Wollongong as secondary market only)\n\nVIC (4) 3 Melbourne teams + 1 Geelong team\n\nQLD (3) 1 Brisbane, 1 Gold Coast, 1 NQ team\n\nWA (2): 2 Perth teams\n\nSA (2): 2 Adelaide teams\n\nTAS (1): 1 Tassie team\n\nACT (1): 1 Canberrra team\n\nNZ (1): 1 NZ team\n\nNT (1): 1 NT team\n\nThat's if you cared more about rationalisation of teams than just $$$, otherwise there'd be more teams in NSW and QLD.\n\nThe teams:\n\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs\n\nParramatta Eels\n\nSydney Roosters\n\nManly Warringah Sea Eagles\n\nNewcastle Knights\n\nCarlton Blues\n\nCollingwood Magpies\n\nMelbourne Demons\n\nGeelong Cats\n\nBrisbane Broncos\n\nGold Coast Sharks\n\nNorth Queensland Cowboys\n\nPerth Black Swans\n\nFremantle Dockers\n\nPort Adelaide Pirates\n\nAdelaide Crows\n\nTasmania Tigers\n\nCanberra Raiders\n\nNew Zealand Warriors\n\nNorthern Territory Bombers\n\nBut when you look at the success of the Redcliffe Dolphins it'd be tempting to turn Brisbane into a two team city and reduce Sydney to 3 mega clubs representing the North, South, and West.\n\nI'm probably missing a really big NRL club (don't know jack about it, probably St. George Illlawarra) so you could just add them and Redcliffe and go to a max of 22 teams. It's not like they wouldn't be able to support that many teams if AFL was this big.\n\nHere is my alternate timeline laid out, haven't got around to designs yet but the list is finalised.\n\nIt’s 1980. The New South Wales Football League and the Victorian Football League are the biggest footy leagues in Australia. They both have 12 teams.\n\nThe East Perth Royals apply to join the NSWFL in 1980. Their bid is rejected.\n\nIn 1981, the South Melbourne Swans are ****ed. The NSWFL offers to bail them out; they accept. The South Melbourne Swans relocate to NSW and become the Illawarra Swans in 1982. That year, the NSWFL also adds the Canberra Raiders, expanding their competition to 14 teams.\n\nThe VFL don’t want an odd number of teams. They approach the East Perth Royals in 1982. East Perth join the VFL in 1983, taking the VFL back to 12 teams.\n\n1983 would be the last year for the Newtown Jets, taking the NSWFL back to 13 teams.\n\nIn 1984, the NSWFL have talks with the popular Brisbane Football League which is struggling due to the exodus of players to the NSWFL. They offer the BFL a license to join the NSWFL. They accept, creating a super club called the Brisbane Broncos. NSWFL back to 14 teams.\n\nThe VFL expands to 14 teams in 1987, adding the West Perth Falcons and the Port Adelaide Pirates who get to wear the prison bars every game.\n\nIn 1988, the NSWFL expands to 16 teams, adding the Newcastle Knights and the Gold Coast-Tweed Giants. Gold Coast eventually rebrand themselves as the Gold Coast Titans.\n\nIn 1991, the VFL adds the Norwood Redlegs to the league, rejecting the bid from Tasmania. The NSWFL swoops on this opportunity, adding the Tasmania Devils and a second Brisbane team, the Redcliffe Dolphins, to the NSWFL, expanding to 18 teams.\n\nIn 1995, the VFL adds the Fremantle Bullsharks to the competition, a merger between the South Fremantle Bulldogs and East Fremantle Sharks. VFL is now at 16 teams.\n\nThe NSWFL responds by adding the North Queensland Cowboys and the New Zealand Warriors to the league, taking the total number of teams to 20.\n\nAs of 2024, the VFL has 16 teams: Carlton Blues, Collingwood Magpies, East Perth Royals, Essendon Bombers, Fitzroy Lions, Fremantle Bullsharks, Geelong Cats, Hawthorn Hawks, Melbourne Demons, North Melbourne Kangaroos, Norwood Redlegs, Port Adelaide Pirates, Richmond Tigers, St Kilda Saints, Western Bulldogs, West Perth Falcons.\n\nAs of 2024, the NSWFL has 20 teams: Balmain Tigers, Brisbane Broncos, Campbelltown Magpies, Canberra Raiders, Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Gold Coast Titans, Illawarra Swans, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Newcastle Knights, New Zealand Warriors, North Queensland Cowboys, North Sydney Bears, Parramatta Eels, Penrith Panthers, Redcliffe Dolphins, South Sydney Rabbitohs, St. George Dragons, Sydney Roosters, Tasmania Devils.\n\nThere are rumours of contraction in the future in the NSWFL through mergers to make way for future teams. Some say there will be a third Brisbane team, a Central Coast team, and perhaps one based out of Papua New Guinea/Cairns.\n\nAs for the VFL, there is speculation that they will eventually expand to a maximum of 20 teams, adding a regional Victorian team, a 4th Western Australia team, a 3rd South Australian team, and a Northern Territory team to the league."
