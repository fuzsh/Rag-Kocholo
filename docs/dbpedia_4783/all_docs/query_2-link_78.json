Newcastle have picked a 31 man squad to trial against a combined Centurions/ Knights NYC side as a curtain raiser. This game will kick off at 4pm with 4 x 20 minute quarters.\n\nAt this stage the fixture will be 4 x 20 quarters. The players involved are hoping to impress selectors for a position in the Newcastle Rebels Represenatative side for this years CRL Senior Championships. This will also give the selectors a chance to watch players they havent seen play before.\n\nNewcastle Squad\n\nName Club\n\n1 Sam Wooden Cessnock\n\n2 Josh Mantellato Wyong\n\n3 Dan Randall Maitland\n\n4 Mitch Everton South\n\n5 Haydon Crouch Maitland\n\n6 Benton Fidock South\n\n7 Matt Sharp Wyong\n\n8 Brent Colley South\n\n9 Isaac Upton Northern Blues\n\n10 Mitch Garbutt West\n\n11 Ainsley Coxsedge South\n\n12 Dan Metcalf Maitland\n\n13 Chad Sharp Wyong\n\n14 Domenic Nasso Wyong\n\n15 Jake Learmouth South\n\n16 Adam Fielder Lakes\n\n17 Trent Walker Cessnock\n\n18 Nathan Ross Lakes\n\n19 Jackson Nickalau Lakes\n\n20 Mick Moran Maitland\n\n21 Sinbad Kali Wyong\n\n22 Tyne Owen Lakes\n\n23 Kene Te Wata Wyong\n\n24 Matt Hurd Macquarie\n\n25 Colby Schrader Maitland\n\n26 Jacob Sinclair Maitland\n\n27 Sam Anderson Kurri\n\n28 Ben Sams Lakes\n\n29 Ben Bradley Central\n\n30 Mitch Cullen Kurri\n\n31 Andy Sumner Macquarie\n\nI'm surprized Sinbad Kali is playing for Wyong.\n\nI always thought he would play firstgrade for Melbourne.\n\nHe made a mess of our reserve grade props more than once.\n\nYeah he is one who I thought still had an NRL future.\n\nI noticed that Mitch Williams, Wyong's hooker from last year and CRL player of the year is missing. Perhaps he's in the NSW Cup squad. He's only 22 so would still young enough to keep an eye on.\n\nIf he hasn't been training he might have blown up. Looking at a few articles on him he was 125kg at 17 and trimmed down to 112kg for Melbourne.\n\nHe was a Wyong junior from age 6.\n\nI remember going to a reserve grade game in 2008 at Wyong where he played for CC Storm as a 21 year old, and he absolutely took Matt White and Sione Finefuaki to school. We got done by about 50, and he was easily MOTM.\n\nHe missed the 2009 season after getting injured playing for Tonga in the 2008 WC.\n\nHe must not have come back too well last season, although i think i remember him playing a game or two of firstgrade, but i might be wrong.\n\nThis is a great photo (if i do say so myself - have to get lucky some time).\n\nI can't remember the name of the Knights player, but he was a prop who Smith signed who returned the ball like a maniac. This is the exact point his career ended as Sinbad Kali smashed him into next week and he never played for the Knights again.\n\nIt was an amazing hit - the guy was running at full pace with no thought of self preservation and Kali stopped him dead.\n\nHis name was Asa I think.\n\nBen Bradley is either in his last year of SG Ball or first year of NYC. He is a chunky prop - a bit short maybe.\n\nIf he is not in our squads this year he could use this game to get people to take a second look.\n\nJackson Nicolau was suppose to be the next big thing a few years ago\n\nI thought he same thing... I was really shocked to see him on that list.\n\nI remember a few years ago the Cows paid a fortune to get him from Melbourne, and were talking him and JT up as their scrumbase pair for the next 10 years.\n\nI thought he same thing... I was really shocked to see him on that list.\n\nI remember a few years ago the Cows paid a fortune to get him from Melbourne, and were talking him and JT up as their scrumbase pair for the next 10 years.\n\nI think the media publicity went to his head and he didn't progress as everyone predicted. He is still young and hopefully he has the fire in his belly to succeed at the top level as he sure did have potential.\n\nYeah he is one who I thought still had an NRL future.\n\nI noticed that Mitch Williams, Wyong's hooker from last year and CRL player of the year is missing. Perhaps he's in the NSW Cup squad. He's only 22 so would still young enough to keep an eye on.\n\nHe is but struggling with contact considering he is smallish. Going ok in the other 50 percent of the game thou\n\nYears ago the winner of the winfield cup used to come to newcastle and play against thee Newcastle rep side. I think a game were the Knights take on the premiers from the local comp at there home ground with all gate takings divided up to give to all the local clubs would be a good trial for the knights every year. Thoughts\n\nOne of the interesting things is this will be at EAS.\n\nI assume they are happy to play at EAS because the new half artifical/half real grass is much more robust than the old surface, so they can play many more games on it.\n\nThe trials at Cessnock, Raymond Terrace and Charleston the last few years have got crowds between about 2 and 5k, but i suspect a lot of people will be keen to see how the ground looks now.\n\nI'm tipping 5 to 7k.\n\nHe is but struggling with contact considering he is smallish. Going ok in the other 50 percent of the game thou\n\nYeah he is smallish but he's always performed well in each team he's been in. He's a tackling machine.\n\n2006 - Norths SG Ball player of the year\n\n2007 - Norths Jersey Flegg player of the year\n\n2008 - Norths NSW Cup and Souths Toyota Cup\n\n2009 - Wyong - MotM in the grand final.\n\n2010 - Wyong - CRL player of the year\n\nYeah he is smallish but he's always performed well in each team he's been in.
