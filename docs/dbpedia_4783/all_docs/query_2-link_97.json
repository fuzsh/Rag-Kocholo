        "text": "Am I getting paranoid or is it just coincidence that every time Fox put on a game of Rugby League the Rugby Union ads are run almost non stop. Who decides on the ad placement? If it's union then once again their hypocrisy shows no bounds.\n\nIf it is Fox, are they trying to get more viewers for a game that is so poor that they suddenly realise that they hugely overpaid for the broadcast rights?\n\n:think::think::think::think::think::think::think::think::think::think::think::think:\n\nYeah, the Super Rugby is being advertised like crazy. It might just be because of the Melbourne Rebels coming into the competition, I dunno.\n\nLooking forward to watching Vuna, but that's about the only enjoyment I'll get from Yawnion.\n\nI must say, if League was being advertised during union, you'd probably not speak so loudly eh?\n\nI wouldn't see them............. I NEVER watch the union. 30 pigs at feeding time........... Then again League doesn't the boost up that union does!\n\nIt is just simple marketing. They are more likely to hit more targets with ads showing during league than they would if it were for tennis or cricket.\n\nYou know some of us actually do watch and enjoy both rugby codes. I don't really see the problem. I'd rather see an ad for Super Rugby than gAyFL or golf.\n\nFor me, it's not the game itself i like watching, i find it boring with all the kicking & crap. BUT the tries are always good to watch. The tries are harder to score in Union so that usually makes for length of the field tries. I would sit down & watch a video of Rugby tries over AFL anyday.\n\nYou know some of us actually do watch and enjoy both rugby codes. I don't really see the problem. I'd rather see an ad for Super Rugby than gAyFL or golf.\n\nJust my opinion but I prefer watching AFL to Union, it's more entertaining and less confusing.\n\nI would honestly rather watch a bad game of NBL.\n\nevery game of NBL is a bad game... i like watching highlights of union as well as afl, cricket etc... couldnt watch a whole game tho!"
