        "text": "Newcastle United have opened talks with Crystal Palace for reported Liverpool transfer target Marc Guehi, according to the reliable David Ornstein.\n\nThe Athletic journalist reports that while Guehi is on the transfer wishlist of a number of top clubs this summer, Newcastle are the first to enter into 'meaningful talks' with Palace over a switch.\n\nThe Magpies approached the London club this week to begin negotiations and Guehi, whose contract expires in 2026, has given no indications that he is willing to sign a fresh deal at Selhurst Park.\n\nThe 24-year-old defender, who was labelled 'exceptional' by former England boss Gareth Southgate for his Euro 2024 displays, has been frequently linked with Anfield over the past few months.\n\nWhile the centre-back may not be a natural fit at Anfield, he is certainly an incredible talent and a homegrown player with enormous potential. The fact that he's comfortable playing on the left-hand side of defence is an added bonus.\n\nHowever, if Liverpool are set to sign a central defender this summer, they may have to look elsewhere, or act quickly if Guehi is one of their preferred candidates.\n\nNewcastle are clearly incredibly keen on a new centre-back this summer. They even tried to sign Liverpool wonderkid Jarell Quansah as part of a deal that would have seen Anthony Gordon head in the other direction.\n\nLIVERPOOL STILL YET TO MAKE SUMMER SIGNING\n\nLiverpool remain the only club in the Premier League yet to sign a first-team player this summer but new head coach Arne Slot has admitted that there is likely to be at least one new addition before the window shuts.\n\nWhether that's a centre-back, defensive midfielder or inside forward remains to be seen, but the Reds may be forced into strengthening at the back in the coming weeks.\n\nWantaway defender Sepp van den Berg could earn a permanent move away from Anfield, with Liverpool demanding £20m for the Dutchman."
