        "text": "In traditional Melbourne fashion, the team ran through a banner that read: “Thank you Melbourne, Always Rebels, Always Fighting”.\n\nThe crowd was encouraged to stand and cheer at the 14th minute of the match to celebrate the 14 seasons the club has been in the competition.\n\n“It was really special,” Rebels coach Kevin Foote said. “Probably the thing that really struck me was on 14 minutes when the fans stood up.\n\n“You just see all these people and how much it means to them and it was really, really special and to have the families coming into the sheds now, it’s a cool memory for us.\n\n“We didn’t get the result, but it’s bigger than that.”\n\nAfter an early Chiefs penalty goal, Melbourne got off to a strong start with young winger Glen Vaihu crossing in the sixth minute.\n\nThe teams traded points in the first half, with the visitors having the final say as McKenzie nailed a 41st minute penalty goal for a 13-11 lead into the break.\n\nSitting fourth on the ladder, two spots above Melbourne, the Chiefs extended their advantage five minutes into the second half through hooker Samisoni Taukei’aho.\n\nThe Chiefs lost lock Tupou Vaa’i to a yellow card for an incidental head knock on Rebels five-eighth Carter Gordon, who also left the field temporarily but was cleared in his HIA.The Chiefs had contributors across the park, including hulking All Black prop Aiden Ross.\n\nThe visitors extended the lead to 23-11 through another McKenzie penalty before Melbourne got back into the contest when winger Lachie Anderson scored in the 56th minute.\n\nHe added his second in the 73rd minute to set up a grandstand finish, locking the scoreboard up at 23-all until McKenzie’s killer blow from a breakdown penalty.\n\nDespite their fourth straight loss the Rebels’ season isn’t over. They still have a chance to make their first finals appearance, with a bonus point from this match likely to prove crucial.\n\nHowever, they face tough away games against the ACT Brumbies and Fijian Drua to secure their spot.\n\n“We’ve got it in us, it’s a mindset and I think we’re going to be right in it,” Foote said.\n\nThe Chiefs leap-frogged the Brumbies into third but face top two sides the Hurricanes and Blues in their remaining matches.\n\nCoach Clayton McMillan said he warned his team about the emotion the Rebels would ride into the match and was proud they could withstand the home side’s fightback.\n\nHe said it would be disappointing if Melbourne were cut from the competition.\n\n“I feel for them because I legitimately think they’ve got the makings of a bloody good side that if they were kept together for a little while could do some special things,” he said."
