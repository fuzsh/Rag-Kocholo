REBELS representative captain Chad O'Donnell says he's "definitely glad I'm on that side and not the other" with Newcastle Rugby League recruits Blake Ferguson and Will Smith creating an all-NRL centre pairing.

O'Donnell, skippering the squad for a third straight campaign and second back in the NSW Country Championships, leads out the Rebels in Saturday's opener against neighbours Central Coast at Cessnock Sportsground (12pm).

"Just the experience, but they've come in and bought in straight away the NRL contingent," O'Donnell told the Newcastle Herald.

"Fergo is awesome with defensive tips and attacking tips. Same as Will, who I'm sure will pop up and float around [the field] a bit as well and won't just sit out there.

The Rebels will wear black armbands and observe a minute's silence paying tribute to Leigh Maughan, who died earlier this week. Regarded as the founding father of NRL club the Knights, Maughan was also a Newcastle RL player, referee, board member and commentator.
