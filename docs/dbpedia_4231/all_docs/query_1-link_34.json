Im Hoping to make it back East to see my friends and to go to the Winterhawk Fest. My friend Rob and I would sometimes be the only ones able to make it to the fests. Mostly it would be a nice group of close friends. I have gone to Fests with my friends for a number of years as a lot of others have and they are going to be there with bells on (actually might be literally) the first week in August. I hope to make it to see them and make up for some time missed and also to see you play. Thanks for giving me a chance to say this and I hope to experience your talent first hand at the Hawk...

We talked at Smilefest at the \"coffee bus\" You signed my \"crew\" shirt. You know the one that didn't have a picture of a fiddle on the back. Anyway, we were talking about a radio station (WNCW from Spindel, NC) that plays your CD Full Circle. We told you that we had heard the song White Room played on the station. You made the comment that you wished they would play Tall Timbers. Well I'm writing to let you know last Saturday 6/15 during \"Down from the Mountain\" the local bluegrass show, WNCW played Tall Timbers. I was so excited I called the station and told them about the conversation we had had the week-end before. The DJ at the station said he had gotten a request for that song from someone in South Carolina who had met you at Smile Fest. I just wanted to let you know we're listening to you here, not only with our CD players but on the radio too! We'll be seeing you\n\nCyndi Phillips <canyonlady66@yahoo.com>\n\nKannapolis, NC USA - Wednesday, June 19, 2002 at 18:39:32 (GMT) Just wanted to write and thank you so much for playing at the Smilefest second stage -The Furthur Adventure Stage-fiddle workshop!!!!I don't know if you remember me but I introduced myself after the show- I painted your fiddle on the stage tapestry as the first and most rooted instrument among all the instruments I painted in the \"musical landscape\".

I would very much like to send you a photo of my painting if you could send me an address to my e-mail!!Bobby Robertson can vouch for me as a real & kind person!- Anyway- It was the greatest, most wonderful honor to see you and listen to you up close!all my admiration and kind wishes for you and yours always,sincerely Lida Witherspoon - stage painter- Visiondance Scenic-Greensboro\n\nLida Witherspoon <visiondance@hotmail.com>\n\nGreensboro, N.C.

Had no idea he is a native Floridian! Was particularly impressed with the list of groups with which he has played. I started a middle school fiddle program last summer and am always looking for real-life examples of folks who have \"made it\" in the business. Am currently turning my students on to Vassar & his music . . . playing one of his CD's which I purchased at the benefit and printing his bio to read to them. Tell him if he's ever in the area, my students would be THRILLED to see his face in the place! Sumter County and our school in particular is a rather depressed area. 60+% of our students are on the free/reduced lunch program. And it's not a racial thing either. Just a lot of underprivileged kids here. I know it's asking a lot, but just think about it, please. Thank you, Donna Luty\n\nDonna Luty <MomLuty@cs.com>\n\nLady Lake, FL USA - Monday, May 27, 2002 at 14:06:21 (GMT) Mr. Clements, I had the extreme pleasure of seeing you and the Old & In the Way boys (and girl...she played a mean base) in Pittsburgh Pa (Carnegie Music Hall)on May 23rd.

Which one was this? I thought you might be as old as 80, your hair being so white and all, but Midge swears your 84. I don't believe her -- you don't look a day over 80 to me. Looking forward to seeing you here in Boise at Music on the Mountain this year. Was sorry it was cancelled last year. Was looking forward to it after having seen you and the Grisman Quintet a couple of years back. I remember the others messing with you on stage -- seems like some of them were pretending to be backwoodsers and one keep making goofy faces at you until he finally stopped your mind and cracked you up. Have I got that right? Well again, Happy Birthday. Take care of yourself and listen to Midge -- unless she tells you to not go to Boise!

The Festival was almost not scheduled this year because some politicians didn't have their priorities straight and figured the State could not afford to put on the festival this year. However, the outcry from the citizenry changed their minds. However, I do not see you scheduled to appear there this year. Hope to see you there next year. I know you do not really know me, but I guess you can say we are distant relatives. Our grandfathers (McQuagge) were brothers; my mother, Lucille Duncan, and your mother and aunt, Claudia Clements, were first cousins. I met you many years ago at a family reunion in Bushnell. It makes me proud to know a famous musician as yourself. My family really enjoys your music. We look forward to seeing you perform in October at Magnolia Fest. We wish you and your family all the best. The world is a better place for having you and your talent in it. God Bless you.\n\nMary Haskins <mary_bob_@msn.com>\n\nMONTICELLO, fl USA - Sunday, April 14, 2002 at 22:36:02 (GMT) Happened on your site by accident, but it was a nice accident!

Although I do not play professionally I did have the honor of being invited to sit in many times at \"The World Famous Palomino club\" in North Hollywood and had the thrill to see you perform there...But that was many moons ago.

I managed to find my autographed ticket stub from the Maintenance Shop in the Union Hall at Iowa State University from 1978! It was an awesome time back then when in that dim basement bar I heard some of the best live music in my life! Sneaky Pete, Great Guitars, Koko, Flying Burrito Bros., etc. etc. By-the-way, the price of the ticket was $3.50! I hope to see you again sometime and thank you!\n\nJim R. <jimngeri@earthlink.net>\n\nK'ville, NC USA - Monday, March 18, 2002 at 03:57:57 (GMT) All my life I have been a frustrated fiddler.

Glad to see you are still active in the business....I produced my last show here on Saint Simons, it was either Wet Willie or Delbert McClinton, can't remember which was my swan song as a promoter Jim Hines\n\njim hines <jimhines@darientel.net>\n\nSaint Simons Island, Ga.

A year later I bought the album \"Will the Circle be Unbroken\" and heard Doc Watson say to you \"How does that go Vassar\" and I listened very closely. What a pleasure to hear what you are able to do with a fiddle. A year later a bought a fiddle and have been trying to teach myself to play. It is slow going with out a teacher and seems like never enough time to practice, but when I do I am amazed at the little things. Then I was given a \"Fiddler Magazine Favorites\" tunes book. It came with CD's and I was amazed at your talent again hearing \"Take a Break\" for the first time. I would just like to thank you for the wonderful sound you have brought to my ears. May God Bless.\n\nAllen R.

Another of my sons has started lessons, so I have great hopes for them. Hopefully we can catch you this summer..maybe at Winterhawk. Have a great show tomorrow. Thanks for your inspirational playing.

Rich Arnold\n\nRich Arnold <dbgdbg@aol.com>\n\nNashville, Tn USA - Thursday, February 28, 2002 at 06:22:57 (GMT) Hi Vassar, I had the pleasure of hearing you and meeting you at a place called the Crystal Palace in Paramus N.J. around 1982. I was playing bass with the house band/opening act, and recall speaking with Jimmy O' Neill who was playing guitar with you at the time. Later when I moved to Atlanta I re-connected with Jimmy and played some jobs with him and recorded some at Kala when he was guitar/engineer there. Jimmy loved to tell stories about playing with you, unfortunately we lost Jimmy to cancer last September. I was at a violin shop getting my bass bow repaired, and had my violin along for show and tell. They told me that you play the same fiddle. My instrument has the Duiffoprugcar carved head, but he seems to have lost some hair compared to yours. The corners have the leaves between the double purfling just as yours. The back has similar markings, except on the lower side it is inlaid with a city scene. The ribs have carved : VIVA FVI IN SILVAS DVM MORTVA DVLCE CE CANO. The best and most sensible translation I have had (tried priests, doctors, repair guys etc) is \"In life the wood is silent, while in death it sings sweetly\". Is this anything like the inscription on your instrument? Best Wishes, Eric Ferguson AFM Local 148-462 Atlanta\n\nEric Ferguson <fergusongs@mindspring.com>\n\nAtlanta, GA USA - Wednesday, February 27, 2002 at 06:35:38 (GMT) I have only been able to see you perform once before with Ratdog.

His call name is Vasser. He is so cute and his hair is the same color as Vassers, white as snow in winter. He will be a giant dog in size. Regal marsh hunter and hopefully qualify for the canine rescue divison.

Thanks for helping me select the CD's. \"That High Lonesome Sound\" was mostly what I had expected; but \"The Bottom Line, Encore Collection\" is an absolute treasure. Hillbilly-jazz is a new term and idea to me, but perfectly describes this piece of music. I never knew \"Papa\" could sing! Of course I wanted the albums because they have Orange Blossom Special, which was what led me to do this search in the first place. Unfortunately I dont think either of the versions are the ones Im trying to locate. When we talked, you had mentioned some older cuts that were on vinyl, and perhaps thats the one Im looking for. Although Old and in the Way is stuck in my mind, I dont think the version of Orange Blossom Special on That High Lonesome Sound is the one Im wanting. Was there another Old and in the Way, perhaps on vinyl from the early to mid 70s that had a very long version of Orange Blossom Special on it? Perhaps lasting ten minutes or so? If so, is there any way to find a copy, or is there any possibility of it being re-mastered and put onto a CD? If it is Ill be first in line to get one. Midge, thanks again for being so nice to me. Talking to you was a pleasure. Thanks again, and please thank Papa for autographing my albums. Ill treasure them always.\n\nMike Poore <mpoore@innernet.net>\n\nFairfield, PA USA - Friday, February 22, 2002 at 18:19:53 (GMT) I recieved from my grandmother \"Full Circle\". which your daughter was kind enough to send.

The way you floated over those crazy Snake Oil compositions was a true testanment to those ears of yours. Midge and George, it was a pleasure to talk with you too. Big props to Thomas Helland as well, who I bet has introduced hundreds, if not thousands, of young ears to the genius of Vassar Clements.
