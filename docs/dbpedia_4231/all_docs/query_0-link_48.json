        "text": "A guest posting by Fraser Pettigrew\n\nI’ve been to a few gigs over the years. Not as many as some readers here, for sure, but the list includes artists from the globally stellar to the defiantly cult. I’ve seen Prince and Bob Dylan, Comsat Angels and Pere Ubu. The majority of these concerts have followed the time-honoured format and mostly don’t deserve description beyond the fact of being there, it was great, Bob wore a black suit and sang through his nose for two hours.\n\nThere are some gigs, however, that ought to be filed under ‘unusual’ for various reasons.\n\nOne of the most seriously out-of-the-ordinary shows I went to was The Residents at Edinburgh’s Queen’s Hall in June 1983. I knew very little about them at the time. I’d seen a video on the Old Grey Whistle Test of their alien interpretation of the Rolling Stones’ Satisfaction, heard a few other snippets on John Peel and that was about it. I’ve still never bought any of their records. But they were legendary for their uncompromising avant-garde obscurity, reclusiveness and personal anonymity. I was a moth to the flame.\n\nFor those of you that have never encountered them, The Residents are noted for never appearing unmasked in public, usually to be seen in promo photos or album artwork wearing top hats and tails with giant eyeballs where their heads should be. To us, children of the punk revolution, such anti-fame was deserving of high respect. And the music was staunchly uncommercial, surreal-satirical, the epitome of American weird, refreshing the parts that even Zappa and Beefheart couldn’t reach.\n\nI’ve subsequently dipped into The Residents’ back-catalogue thanks to Spotify and while I can’t offer a complete summary of so many dozen albums, much of what I hear casts them firmly in the role of electronic-industrial pioneers, experimenting with synthesisers and treatments that warp familiar forms into a disquieting zone of creepy twilight jitters. It’s like listening to Dome or Cabaret Voltaire playing Roald Dahl poetry in the style of Sun Ra. It’s not unreasonable to argue that those groups show the influence of The Residents, as do the likes of Throbbing Gristle, Pere Ubu and Devo, albeit in (sometimes) much more accessible form.\n\nPrior to the extensive European tour that brought them to Edinburgh, The Residents had played barely a handful of live shows over their decade-long existence. This was seen as part of their studied obscurity, but in fact it was driven as much by the difficulty the group itself perceived in reproducing their studio music on a live stage. Advances in early sampler technology in the early 80s presented a solution, and the Mole Show was born.\n\nThe Queen’s Hall is not your typical rock venue, which seems entirely appropriate for a band like The Residents. It’s a former presbyterian church with no real backstage area or clear division between auditorium and the stage, a low platform projecting into the seated area and overlooked on both sides by the upper balcony. Ironically, however, The Mole Show was clearly designed with a more traditional theatre in mind and the stage end of the Queen’s Hall had to be screened off with a huge improvised white curtain that would ordinarily hang handily across the proscenium arch.\n\nThe show started with the curtain still closed, lights blazing behind it and some quasi-industrial music kicking in. Eventually the curtain parted to reveal… another curtain! Or at least a rough sackcloth screen held up on a large gantry behind which the band members could be made out, backlit and silhouetted as they played. A group of dancers occupied the area in front of the screen, writhing about with a large eyeball held in each hand. So far, so weird.\n\nTo be honest, I don’t remember that much about the music or all the barmy things that happened in the show. I do remember that when band members finally emerged from behind the screen they weren’t eyeball-headed but wore those joke plastic Groucho Marx glasses-nose-moustache masks to obscure their faces. There was an MC who explained to the audience what was going on at various points. I have subsequently learned that the MC was none other than Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller fame, before anyone in the UK knew who Penn and Teller were. Towards the end of the show, after he had spent the evening using his role to sarcastically deride the performers, he was brought back onto the stage gagged and tied to a wheelchair. Apparently, during a performance in Spain, Jillette was attacked by an irate audience member while thus bound and gagged. No such assault occurred in Edinburgh, however.\n\nFortunately, to make up for my feeble recollection, there is a video on YouTube of an entire performance of The Mole Show\n\nIt was recorded in Madrid for an arts TV programme, so we can all marvel at the impenetrable insanity of the whole thing. (The show starts at about 8m30s. The role of MC is played by the tour manager in this recording, as Penn Jillette was ill).\n\nThere is also an excellent fan website here that relates the complete logistical and financial nightmare of the tour, an experience of mismanagement that reads like the most typical rock’n’roll thing The Residents have ever done.\n\nIt’s the familiar story of setting out to tour as a way of generating income, but designing a show that cost more to stage and transport than came in at the box office, having to sell the merchandising rights to generate funds but thereby losing out on the substantial income stream from merch sales, and finally their tour manager failing to pay the UK shipping company who impounded all their gear until he was paid, requiring The Residents to rebuild all their sets for one last money-spinning performance back in America, eating into the fee for that. Two days before this final show, the original sets and gear arrived from the UK.\n\nDespite ending up penniless from this exhausting experience, The Residents have gone on to embrace live performance over subsequent years, mounting elaborate stage shows that have managed to actually make money on occasion. They have also managed to remain anonymous, with the exception of founding member Hardy Fox, although his identity as one of the band’s primary composers was only revealed on account of his death in 2018. He had previously been openly associated with the group as one of the ‘Cryptic Corporation’, a group of people supposedly brought in to manage and represent the band.\n\nAs I mentioned above, even the experience of The Mole Show didn’t motivate me to seek out any of their records. It was as though the gig was more of a theatrical experience than a musical one, and certainly almost all of The Residents’ LPs can be defined as ‘concept’ albums, like little theatrical creations of their own. Consequently, it’s very difficult to pick out any kind of representative sample of tracks, so I’ve confined it to a couple of pieces from Mark of the Mole, the album that spawned the whole idea of the show, plus a couple of other pieces from the same era. The Commercial Album (1980), whilst laughably un-commercial (natch!) at least has the virtue of limiting each track to exactly one minute, and as a consequence is more listenable than a lot of their others. I’d be hard pushed to say I was recommending any of this mind you, but if your tastes take you to some wilder shores then you might enjoy. Or you’ve been there already. Plus, if you were canny enough to buy a copy of the Satisfaction single in 1976 you could possibly raise anything between £400-800 for it these days.\n\nmp3: The Residents – Voices of the Air (from Mark of the Mole, 1981)\n\nmp3: The Residents – Another Land (from Mark of the Mole, 1981)\n\nmp3: The Residents – Amber (from The Commercial Album, 1980)\n\nmp3: The Residents – Perfect Love (from The Commercial Album, 1980)\n\nmp3: The Residents – Satisfaction (single, 1976)\n\nThe long history of The Residents is a furiously complex web of personas, mythologies, conceptual contrivances and symbolism that makes the KLF look like part-timers. The fact of having seen them live illuminates none of this really. It was just one incarnation of an endlessly morphing artistic project that has rolled along for around fifty years, the product of a group of people with singular imaginations and a lifelong dedication to their concept. I still feel privileged to have witnessed them perform live at that time, when few others ever had. For all the mainstreaming of what was once avant-garde in the decades after punk, I can honestly say I’ve never seen anything like it since.\n\nFraser\n\nYou’ll hopefully remember from the 1992 series of Wedding Present singles that the year was rounded off with what seemed like a festive number in the shape of No Christmas. But as I mentioned at the time No Christmas, other than its title, had very little to do with the festive season and was really just about the saddest and bleakest of all the break-up songs that David Gedge has ever written.\n\nHe later said in an interview that he maintained the hope and ambition of writing, recording and releasing a bona-fide single celebrating the (supposedly) most wonderful time of the year. His ambition came to be realised at the end of 2008.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Holly Jolly Hollywood\n\nThis was the lead track on EP4 of How The West Was Won. It’s a light, almost flimsy throwaway number in which a co-vocal is delivered by Simone White, a Hawaii-born singer/songwriter whose recording career began in 2003 and has, to date, encompassed eight albums with a similar number of singles and EPs. A promo video was made:-\n\nThe promo actually has a big part to play in why I dislike this song. David Gedge might only be ten years older than Simone White, but the age gap looks a lot wider in the video, three minutes of footage in which he appears stiff and wooden, not to mention he’s put just too much black in his hair dye prior to the shoot.\n\nAs with other songs in the box set, an acoustic version was offered up:-\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Holly Jolly Hollywood (acoustic version)\n\nThe digital download came, as with the box set CD, came with a cover version of possibly the most famous festive song of them all.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – White Christmas\n\nIt’s delivered at a funereal pace. I have no love for it, so I’ll leave it at that.\n\nThe record label did produce a few promotional CDs containing all three of the above songs for distribution to radio stations. A copy is currently up for sale on Discogs for a little over £20, including postage and packaging.\n\nThe promo CD doesn’t have the fourth track that was included in the CD contained within the How The West Was Won box set. It, too, was a cover version, and was the song that had been released as the bonus track with the ITunes download of El Rey some more than six months earlier.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Back For Good\n\nTake that…….and weep.\n\nThe Wedding Present went into a bit of a hiatus for a few years, certainly in terms of recording. This was partly to do with David Gedge coming back to live in the UK after quite a few years on the west coast of America, and much of his time being taken up with planning, organising and curating his At The Edge of The Sea festival, the first of which was in August 2009 and which, other than when COVID restrictions prevented it, has been an annual event in Brighton at that time of year. The band did continue to perform extensively, particularly in 2010 with shows celebrating the 20th anniversary of Bizarro.\n\nThis series, however, won’t be having any similar hiatus. Tune in at the same time next Sunday, when I’ll have jumped forward to 2012.\n\nJC\n\nI hadn’t intended to do such a quick follow-up to the post from earlier this week, but it felt like the right thing to do on the back of the comments that were added when I featured Hard Times/Love Action by The Human League.\n\nMention was made of July 1981 being a great month for 12″ releases, thanks not only to the Human League but also singles by Soft Cell and Spandau Ballet, with the latter being a particular favourite of postpunkmonk (whose website/blog is one of the best written and most informative out there….his depth of knowledge is ridiculously impressive).\n\nAs I’m away on a short holiday, I felt it made a bit of sense to do a bit of cut’n paste from the previous occasions when the 12″ versions of Tainted Love and Chant No.1 featured on the blog.\n\nIt was only after making this decision that I found out the long pieces on both singles were over on the old blog, going back to sometime between 2007 and the first half of 2013.\n\nDamn!\n\nBut here’s what was said as part of the Soft Cell ICA (#156) from February 2018.\n\nmp3: Soft Cell- Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go (12″)\n\n“On the LP (Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret), the last wail of the sax on Frustration goes straight into one of the most recognisable two-note pieces of music ever recorded.\n\nMarc Almond has since written that the arrangement on Tainted Love is all down to David Ball, with one exception; it was Marc’s idea to open with the tinny sounding ‘bim bim’ that would then be repeated throughout the song in the background. It was also his idea that the song would segue perfectly into another sixties classic, albeit in Where Did Our Love Go? they were deploying a tune that was incredibly well-known. At this time, the duo were still focussed on being experimental as much as possible, and the plan when they went into the studio was to go for a 12” release aimed at the club market. It was producer Mike Thorne who twisted their arms to go with Tainted Love as a stand-alone track and as a compromise, a stand-alone cover of the Supremes number would be the b-side.\n\nThe 7” became a #1 hit the world over and went Top 10 on the Billboard chart in the USA, staying in that particular Top 100 for 43 weeks. It has sold millions, but of course neither Almond nor Ball have any songwriting royalties from such sales thanks to the error of not including one of their own compositions on the single (albeit a re-recorded Memorobilia was on the 12”).”\n\nAnd here’s what was written in September 2017 in a longish piece offering the opinion that Spandau Ballet once had ‘it’ but lost ‘it’ somewhere along the way….probably around the release of Gold or True.\n\nmp3 : Spandau Ballet – Chant No.1 (I Don’t Need This Pressure On) (12″)\n\nThis piece of horn-driven funk climbed all the way to the Top 3 in the UK, spending months hanging around the charts and becoming a staple of every club and discotheque in the country. If a black band, say from NYC or Philadelphia, had written and recorded Chant No.1, it would have been held up as an instant classic, but instead this group of young, fashionable Londoners were accused by their critics of music by numbers. It was, and remains, a nailed-on classic that the band never ever bettered.\n\nI stand by all of the above paragraph.\n\nAs my dear friend from Germany says in his sign-offs,\n\nTake care. And enjoy.\n\nJC\n\nTime for another dip into my well-thumbed big book of Indie music to check what memorable singles were released in August 1979 but didn’t bother the chart compliers. I’ll start of with one for my good mate, Dirk.\n\nmp3: Nina Hagen Band – TV Glotzer (White Punks On Dope)\n\nNina Hagen is regarded as ‘The Godmother of German Punk’. Born and raised in East Berlin, she moved to Hamburg, aged 21, in 1976 when her stepfather’ East German citizenship was withdrawn. Her stepfather was Wolf Biermann, a singer-songwriter/poet, who was on an officially sanctioned tour of West Germany when the East German authorities,without warning, revoked his citizenship. The dissident nature of his work had long put him at odds with the authorities.\n\nNina, who herself was making a name as a performer who was a bit of an agitator, immediately put in a request to join her stepfather in exile, which was granted very quickly. Not long after she arrived in Hamburg, she signed a record deal with CBS and in due course went to live and work in West Berlin.\n\nTV-Glotzer was released in Germany in 1979 and eventually in the UK on 29 August 1979. It is a cover of a cover of White Punks on Dope by The Tubes, with different German lyrics from the perspective of an East German unable to leave her country, who escapes by watching West German television, where “everything is so colourful”. It was recorded at the Hansa Studios, made most famous by David Bowie with his trilogy of albums between 1977 and 1979.\n\nmp3: Penetration – Come Into The Open\n\nI’ll repeat what I said back in April. Penetration were one of those band who generated a lot of very positive media that failed to translate into any meaningful commercial success. Actually, that’s not strictly accurate. There were five singles released between 1977 and 1979, none of which troubled the charts, but the two studio albums Moving Targets (1978) and Coming Up For Air (1979) went Top 40, with the debut actually reaching #22.\n\nCome Into The Open was the second single issued in advance of the release of the second album, but like all 45s issued by the band on Virgin Records, it didn’t reach the Top 75.\n\nmp3: The Runaways – Right Now\n\nThe Runaways were very much an American band who didn’t have too much exposure over here in the UK. The band actually broke up in April 1979, so I have no idea how it came to be that UK indie label, Cherry Red, came to issue this single in August 1979. Well, I had no idea until I looked into things and saw that the band’s fourth and final studio album And Now….The Runaways, had only been released in mainland Europe back in December 1978 and that it’s UK release was handled by Cherry Red in the late summer of 79. The single would have been pressed as part of the promotional activities.\n\nA bit like July 79, the month proved to be quiet. But I can promise a much larger selection of songs when we reach September 1979.\n\nOh, and just to mention that later this morning, I’m heading off to Toronto for a short 7-day break to catch up with some old friends. The blog will continud with a combination of some guest post, the usual things you find on Saturdays and Sundays and some of the pre-preparedthings on singles that I pull out of storage at times like these. Hopefully there will be enough to keep you entertained.\n\nJC\n\nIt’s always a nice feeling spotting that someone has taken the time to offer a comment on whatever has been posted, and in typing those words, I’ll take the opportunity to particularly thank flimflamfan, strangeways, fiktiv, sk, postpunkmonk and Adam from Bagging Area for their very regular contributions.\n\nEvery comment is read, and there are times when I wish I had the discipline of someone like Jez over at A History of Dubious Taste who always responds to those who visit his place and offer up some thoughts. But I do always take note of what is said, which is why today’s offering features a 12″ single that I don’t actually own a copy of, but I was able to ‘ahem’ acquire digitally using my villainous ways.\n\nOne of last week’s posts looked at Cities In Dust, a 1985 hit single for Siouxsie & The Banshees. One of the responses that came in simply said:-\n\n“You really need to post Dazzle and the 2 b-sides to that, which are a couple of my favourite Banshee songs that aren’t that well known.”\n\nIt was an anonymous contribution; it’s really annoying that WordPress make it so awkward for occasional contributors to put their name to comments, but in saying that, the service provided by them for the blog is excellent and that’s probably my only grumble.\n\nSorry for the brief digression there. Just a quick word of thanks to Anon and I trust today’s post puts a smile on your face.\n\nmp3: Siouxsie & The Banshees – Dazzle (Glamour Mix)\n\nThe production is courtesy of Mike Hedges, and there are moments on this seven-minutes plus mix that remind me so much of the work he did with Associates in the early 80s. It’s also worth mentioning that Hedges had worked with The Cure on a number of their early releases, and the Banshees at this particular time in their history had Robert Smith on lead guitar and keyboards, and as such it all made for a great fit.\n\nDazzle was the second and final single to be lifted from the album Hyæna. It only reached #33 in May 1984 by which time Smith had long announced his departure from the Banshees, citing exhaustion as he couldn’t manage the workload involved in being in two busy and high-profile bands.\n\nThe two b-sides on the 12″ don’t have Mike Hedges involved, with the credits being simply given as ‘A Siouxsie & The Banshees Production’\n\nmp3 : Siouxsie & The Banshees – I Promise\n\nmp3 : Siouxsie & The Banshees – Throw Them To The Lions\n\nThe former is an excellent listen, albeit it’s title being so similar to a Bunnymen song that I found my mind drifting off to that one, given there is some similarity in the way that Mac and Siouxsie sing the word ‘promise’.\n\nThe latter, in places, is very gothic in nature, with Smith’s guitar work recalling some of the Cure’s early non-hit tunes. It’s one that gets the thumb-up from me.\n\nThanks again to Anon for this fine suggestion. Everyone is welcome to offer things in a similar manner, and I’ll do my best to keep the satisfaction levels at a high rate.\n\nJC\n\n(with apologies to those of you who saw this the other day when I pressed publish instead of save!!)\n\nAn very abridged potted history, edited from the Electronic ICA pulled together back in 2019.\n\n“Johnny Marr and Bernard Sumner first worked together when the man from The Smiths/The The contributed guitar to Atom Rock/Triangle, a single on Factory Records by Quando Quango which the man from New Order was co-producing.\n\nFive years on and the increasing tensions within New Order led to Bernard contemplating a solo record, but instead he called on Johnny, and together they came up with the idea of Electronic, thinking of issuing instrumental house music for clubs via white labels only. Next thing you know, they’re talking to Neil Tennant and found that he was interested in helping out…but with his distinctive vocal delivery, there was no chance of anonymity.\n\nFirst single Getting Away With It was released in 1989. By 1991, the initial ideas had crystallised into a self-titled debut from which two more chart singles – Get The Message and Feel Every Beat were lifted. They then went off and did things with their bands, getting back together in 1992 for Disappointed, a single which again utilised Neil Tennant.\n\nThe next burst of activity was in 1996 with the album Raise the Pressure.”\n\nThis was the ‘comeback’ single, released in June 1996:-\n\nmp3: Electronic – Forbidden City\n\nThere was a fascinating snippet of information within the sleeve of the CD, in that Karl Bartos of Kraftwerk played keyboards and Ged Lynch, most recently with Black Grape, was on drums. The single didn’t give any indication as to how much Karl Bartos had been involved – there were no writing credits offered up, and just Barney and Johnny appearing in the artwork.\n\nIt was only a few weeks later, when the album Raise The Pressure was released, did we learn that Karl Bartos had a co-write credit on six of its thirteen songs, including Forbidden City. I’d have imagined that his contributions would have led to much more synth-type songs, and while this did prove to be the case with some of the album tracks, there’s no question that the lead-off single is guitar-orientated….and I’ll happily confess that it’s one of my favourite songs that Barney and Johnny were ever involved in, no matter who they were surrounded by.\n\nThere were two other songs included with the single, neither of which were included on the album.\n\nmp3: Electronic – Imitation Of Life\n\nmp3: Electronic – A New Religion\n\nI’m not sure if Karl Bartos was involved in writing either of these, but the former, which extends out to almost six minutes, has a greater use of keyboards, albeit it wasn’t that different from what had been written for the debut album some five years earlier – which isn’t a criticism, by the way!!!\n\nThe latter has a lot to take in. In places, it feels like a mid-tempo New Order cast-off, albeit with a heavier guitar sound, and then just before the two-minute mark, the distinctive voice of Denise Johnson comes in to take it in a different direction. The most noticeable thing is that Denise shows up just how limited a singer Barney really is……which isn’t a criticism by the way!!!\n\nForbidden City reached #14 in the charts, one of six Top 20 hits the group would enjoy between 1989 and 1999.\n\nJC\n\nWith apologies for the slightly blurred image today – I didn’t realise until looking at it for the purposes of this post that it wasn’t perfect.\n\nThe day didn’t get off to a great start. I had looked at the Scopitones website at lunchtime which gave the Saturday timings as doors opening at 3pm, so our arrival at 3.30 meant we missed all but the last song from Everett True, and it wasn’t even him singing The Fall. But then again, his take on Chaise Longue by Wet Leg was fun.\n\nOne of the things about this particular festival is the timings, with the thought process being that anyone going along can seamlessly catch every single act. The main part of Concorde 2 is badged as Le Bikini Stage, while an outdoor area takes the name of the Swim Stage.\n\nA couple of minutes after Everett True stepped off Swim, Cinerama walked onto Le Bikini. The four members of The Wedding Present augmented by Emily on flute and Charlotte on keyboards (apologies for not catching their surnames), while at one point Andrea from Melys joined to provide a co-vocal. It was a short and very enjoyable set:-\n\n146 Degrees\n\nClose Up\n\n7x\n\nEars\n\nSly Curl\n\nApres Ski\n\nCareless\n\nAs If\n\nJust eight songs over what should have been 40 minutes, but with David Gedge chatting away happily on stage, it meant it overran by a few minutes and led to Melys having already begun the acoustic set by the time we ventured outside into what was a blisteringly hot and sunny day. The space was rammed, and we couldn’t really see, so we went back inside to where it was a bit cooler and went down near the front to get ready for what Peter Solowka and Len Liggins from The Ukrainians were going to do.\n\nTurned out it was a mix of a Q&A with some live songs – the questions being asked by David Gedge (who also joined in on the songs on acoustic guitar) – as a way of promoting what looks like a fabulous new book ‘Taking Kyiv to the Kosmos’ which celebrates the now 35-year career of the band (a copy was bought and brought back with us). The talk and performance was a real joy, particularly when they played this\n\nmp3: The Ukranians – Batyar\n\nTheir manic and joyful take on Bigmouth Strikes Again from their 1992 EP, Pizni Iz The Smiths. I never thought I’d hear that played live, and it put a daft grin on my face.\n\nWe forsake watching Jar of Blind Flies, instead making our way just across the road to a beachside cafe for a snack, where we could easily hear the band’s take on noisy alt-rock. Listening in, we were a bit annoyed at ourselves at missing out, but as it was about to get a bit manic for the rest of the evening, a short break really had to be built in.\n\nHaving been sure Batyar would turn out to be my personal highlight of the festival, I was soon proved wrong when the Scottish contingent had their turns in the sun.\n\nClose Lobsters bounced on the main stage at 6pm and delivered a magnificent show. The songs covered their entire career, from the early material of the mid-late 80s right through to brand-new songs that came out on a new EP just last week, with everything in between. We stood near the back of the hall for this show as we were determined to get down the front for the next band on The Swim stage, and with things running marginally late, we had to, very sadly, leave just as Close Lobsters struck the opening notes of their last song:-\n\nmp3: Close Lobsters – Going To Heaven To See If It Rains\n\nAnd so we ended up right down the front for Spare Snare, who very cleverly waited until Close Lobsters had stopped playing before beginning their set. I knew from having a wee catch-up with frontman Jan Burnett a few weeks back that he was really looking forward to being part of the festival, and the plan was to blast out, loudly, fast and energetically, a 35-minute set of what the band was all about.\n\nThey were truly majestic, with a show that was worthy of headlining Glasgow Barrowlands and not the second and temporary stage at Concorde 2 in Brighton. Every song was given a rapturous response by an audience that was growing by the minute as word began to spread about the performance that was unfolding.\n\nI’m not too sure just how many folk at the festival knew of Spare Snare before last Saturday evening, but I’m certain that their name was put into loads of search engines once folk got back to their hotels or returned home. There was certainly quite a line-up at the merch stall the rest of the night, where new fans took the opportunity to press flesh with Jan and the rest of the band, while picking up CDs, t-shirts etc. Oh, at Gatwick Airport waiting patiently for a delayed flight back home, we overheard a group of people who were, by the sounds of things bound for Belfast, talking about the festival and saying that Spare Snare had been the support act they had been most enjoyed, especially as they had not known what to expect.\n\nmp3: Spare Snare – Action Hero (Marc Riley Session Version, 2018)\n\nIt took us a few moments to catch our breath, and by the time we got back inside to the main hall, the show by Miki Berenyi Trio was already underway. I’m sure that quite a few of the audience, the opportunity to hear a few Lush songs sprinkled throughout the set was a real highlight, but it kind of felt a bit ‘after the Lord Mayor’s show’ coming on the back of the two Scottish acts. Still, finishing off with Ladykillers was a nice populist touch that raised a loud cheer.\n\nAgain, it was time for another tough decision. Back out to the Swim stage to see Lande Hekt (who I had enjoyed in Glasgow a few months back) or stay put to ensure a good spot for the second performance of the weekend by The Wedding Present? The opportunity to lean against one of the columns holding up the venue’s roof, thus giving a bit of support to my increasingly stiff back and legs, made our minds up, and so we reluctantly missed out on what by all accounts was a fine show by the Bristol-based singer.\n\nAnd so to the end show. TWP Take II.\n\nAny worries or fear I had from the previous night were quickly allayed. The sound wasn’t nearly as vicious as it had been on Friday – maybe the more gentle performance as part of Cinerama earlier in the day had rubbed off on Vince Lammi on drums as he was way less violent this time around. Rachael Wood proved to be a very fine foil on lead guitar for David Gedge while Paul Blackwood very effectively and efficiently did his bit on bass, often over in the corner out where the stage lights were shining. It was quite the set that seemed to feature a fair-amount of duelling guitars, in which David and Rachael brought out the very best in one another.\n\nRachel\n\nA Million Miles\n\nYou Should Always Keep In Touch With Your Friends\n\nMomento Mori\n\nDalliance\n\nLoveslave\n\nCome Play With Me\n\nCrushed\n\nDon’t Talk, Just Kiss\n\nNobody’s Twisting Your Arm\n\nI Am Not Going To Fall In Love With You\n\nCorduroy\n\nScience Fiction\n\nMy Favourite Dress\n\nMake Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)\n\nCrawl\n\nWhat Have I Said Now?\n\nI have avoided describing it as a career-spanning set. 17 songs, of which 13 were originally released between 1987 and 1992. One from 2016 and three from 2022. Nothing whatsoever from Take Fountain, El Rey and Valentina, the three albums that marked the second coming of the band in the 00s and 10s. Over the two nights, six out of nine songs from Bizzaro were played, along with a b-side from that particular era. There really is nothing to complain about.\n\n2025 will mark the fifteenth edition of At The Edge of The Sea and tickets have already gone on sale without knowing anything other than The Wedding Present show on the Friday night will centre around Mini, the six-track EP released in 1996, while Cinerama will play an extended set on the Saturday to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the album Disco Volante.\n\nDavid Gedge looked absolutely knackered at the end of it all. Three sets plus the appearance with The Ukrainians, and at other times doing interviews/chats for those watching a live stream of the event or hanging around the merch stall chatting away to anyone who stopped by. It would take a lot out of anyone half his age – he turns 65 next April – so we might be getting close to a time where it proves nigh on impossible for him to stage the festival. On that basis, there’s every chance we will go back again next year, but it’ll be hard-pressed to better the 2024 event.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Thanks\n\nOne they didn’t play from Bizarro!\n\nOh…..I nearly forgot about my wee postscript.\n\nSunday evening, at the aforementioned Gatwick Airport just waiting to be called to board and I spot various Close Lobsters along with friends and family members. Andrew (lead singer) sits a few seats along from me and Rach with his wife/partner.\n\nI take the opportunity to pass on my appreciation for what had been a great set and apologising for missing the last song. I also mentioned I was marginally disappointed that Foxheads hadn’t been part of the set. He smiled, said thanks and said that everyone in the band had thoroughly enjoyed the whole weekend. On the plane, I found myself in the same row (but across the aisle) from Bob (bass player) and as we get ready to exit having landed in Glasgow, I take another opportunity to repeat what I had said to Andrew, and received a similar reply as to how enjoyable the whole experience had been for the band.\n\nYour humble scribe…..rubbing shoulders with the cream of indie-pop!\n\nJC\n\nMyself and Rachel headed down to Brighton last weekend to take in the annual At The Edge of The Sea festival (aka Gedgefest) at the Concorde 2 venue down on the eastern side of the beachfront.\n\nThree acts on the Friday night and ten on Saturday afternoon/evening. We didn’t catch everyone on the Saturday – a mixture of having to take the occasional rest or getting ourselves into a prime spot inside the main indoor space (Le Bikini Stage) for the next scheduled act meant we didn’t always venture to the smaller outside space (the Swim stage).\n\nWhile I could easily write 20,000 words on everything, I’ll do my best to keep things brief, but it still means splitting things into two pieces.\n\nFriday night’s show had two support acts I knew nothing about beforehand. I could have sought out their music before going down south, but I felt that hearing things fresh on the night was a better way to go about it.\n\nTaffy turn out to be a four-piece band from Japan. Much like Butcher Boy did last week at the Glasgow Weekender, they prove to be the perfect opening act for the festival, evoking memories of the very best of that decade between 1986 and 1996 when indie-music was very much in vogue. Three blokes fronted by a female singer who was also very adept on guitar. My mind was wandering off to the Britpop era, and recalling that while there may well have been too much indie landfill associated with the ‘movement’, there were loads of radio-friendly poptastic tunes that have more than stood the test of time.\n\nmp3: Taffy – Tumbling\n\nA mental note was made to seek out Taffy’s back catalogue (turns out there’s been six albums going back to 2012).\n\nProjector are from Brighton, and are another four-piece band made up of three blokes and a female, but they prove to be quite different from Taffy, making more of a boisterous and noisy post-punk sound, with the set drawn from their debut album Now When We Talk It’s Violence that was released earlier this year. It was an okay show, which I don’t want to sound as if I’m damning it with faint praise because I did enjoy them, but Taffy were a tough act to follow.\n\nFriday night at The Edge of The Sea always closes with a set by The Wedding Present, with the audience knowing that Saturday night closes with a totally separate set by the band. Friday was billed as them performing Watusi in full plus other songs across a 90-minute show.\n\nI’ll cut to the chase – this turned out to be a show that, overall, felt a bit deflating for a few reasons. By bit deflating, I meant it only merited a 7/10 rating in my book.\n\nThe line-up of the band has changed almost beyond recognition from this time last year, with Jonathan Stewart (guitar), Melanie Howard (bass) and Nicholas Wellauer (drums) all departing rather suddenly without explanation, which I found really sad as I felt this particular unit was as good as TWP had sounded at any time since they had come back into being almost 20 years.\n\nDavid Gedge now has, again, a completely new set of musicians comprising Rachael Wood (guitar), Paul Blackburn (bass) and Vince Lammi (drums). The band have been out on the road a fair bit since last November, with many of the shows being centred around the 30th anniversary of Watusi, which was given the deluxe re-issue treatment on vinyl earlier this year across 2x LPs with b-sides from the era and a few alternative mixes being made available. As such, they were more than ready to take things up a notch.\n\nThey opened with Brassneck. It was loud, boisterous and quite manic, but it certainly got the audience going. We Interrupt This Programme, one of the highlights of the 24 Songs project from a couple of years back was next, followed by what can only be described as a blistering take on Dare, the closing moments of felt very much like an unsaid tribute to the late Steve Albini with the guitars cranked up to full volume and the drums pounded to the point where the skins must have been close to breaking.\n\nAnd then Watusi was played in full, from Track 1 to Track 12 in the same order as the album. The problem here is that Watusi is, and I’m being generous, a tad on the patchy side. Maybe inconsistent is a better description. Fair play to the band, the songs I’m not so keen on came across well in the live setting – with a special mention to Catwoman which was stretched out to its full seven-minute length at an ear-splitting volume that My Bloody Valentine would have given their approval to.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Catwoman\n\nBut there’s no doubt that the show lost all sorts of momentum, exemplified by what felt like a limp run-through of Hot Pants, the instrumental which closes the album. I suspect David Gedge was fully aware as he put the show together that he ran the risk of annoying a fair bit of the audience as there proved to be barely a half-second gap between the final note of Hot Pants and the opening and unmistakable riff of Kennedy, long-regarded by most TWP fans as their finest song.\n\nThe rest of the evening passed in a flurry of excitement and much moving of limbs in a moshpit of folk who really should be old enough to better, while the rest of us just swayed and moved a bit less energetically to Everyone Thinks He Looks Daft, Once More, Take Me! and Bewitched. Five closing songs that were just about all anyone could have asked for, although I still had a regret that this line-up didn’t quite do them justice in a way that Stewart, Howard and Wellauer would have.\n\nOutside into the still warm but breezy August evening for the 30-minute walk back through the city centre to our hotel close to the railway station and discovering that our ears were ringing, such was the sonic assault of the evening.\n\nYes, it had been The Wedding Present, and while Rachel had thought it was a magnificent show (she has a penchant for loud music belying her years!!) , I couldn’t help but think I missed the old line-up. I suppose, like Mark E Smith once famously said “If it’s me and your granny on bongos, it’s the Fall”, it’ll always be The Wedding Present when David Gedge is on stage with three other musicians on guitar, bass and drums.\n\nI was also already thinking ahead to the Saturday and wondering what sort of set would close the festival given what had been played on the Friday. OK, there would be nothing from Watusi which was a good thing, but four of the best from Bizzaro had been aired while just one song from the 21st century catalogue had been played. It was going to be intriguing.\n\nPart 2 of the review will appear tomorrow, again as a bonus post later in the day.\n\nJC\n\nCities In Dust, a song inspired by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius which destroyed Pompeii in AD79, was the 17th single released by Siouxsie & The Banshees. It came out in October 1985 and would also be included on the album Tinderbox, released in April 1986.\n\nLooking back on things, 1985 was a transitional year in my life, leaving university and moving to Edinburgh for my first job. It wasn’t a well-paid job, being at the entry level for graduates and by the time the rent and bills were paid, there wasn’t much left to spend on music. Nor was there much room in a shared flat to keep anything!\n\nI’d only have heard Cities In Dust on the radio or whenever S&TB appeared on the telly….I recall watching it played live on BBC2’s Whistle Test, with Siouxsie confined to a chair after she had injured herself when falling over during a gig a few weeks previously.\n\nI first ended up with a copy of the song at the end of 1992 when Santa Claus brought me the Twice Upon A Time CD which compiled the singles from over a ten-year period between ’82 and ’92.\n\nI did, however, pick up the 12″ version many years later, again via a second-hand purchase in a shop when vinyl was still available for decent prices. I’m not sure if it was in a three for £5 deal, but if not, it would have been no more than £3. This version proved to be two-and-a-half minutes longer than I was used to, and I came to the view (which I still hold) that it’s one of those occasions where the extended takeon the song ruins things somewhat. It was something that seemed to happen a fair bit in the 80s:-\n\nmp3 : Siouxsie & The Banshees – Cities In Dust (Extended Eruption Mix)\n\nThe reason I mention the price above is that I wouldn’t be paying so little for it nowadays. It turned out that there were two pressings of the single, with the undernoted illustration on the label being altered on the later version to be a little bit less risqué:-\n\nIt appears there are less of the first pressing kicking around, and the going rate on Discogs is around the £20 mark.\n\nTwo otherwise unavailable tracks made up the b-side. Neither are particularly remarkable:-\n\nmp3 : Siouxsie & The Banshees – An Execution\n\nmp3 : Siouxsie & The Banshees – Quarterdrawing Of The Dog\n\nThe first is experimental in nature and makes for a tough listen in places. The latter is an instrumental which, if it were to appear on a mixtape with no name/credits/info, might have you making a few wrong guesses before you shout out ‘Banshees!!!!’\n\nJC\n\nEl Rey was released at the end of May 2008. It contained 11 tracks, but rather annoyingly, there was a 12th track made available but only through a download via the ITunes store.\n\nThe CD was purchased. And for the first time since The Wedding Present had ‘reconvened’, I found myself rather underwhelmed. Looking back, my expectations were far too high, thinking that El Rey, with the involvement of Steve Albini, was going to be Seamonsters Mark 2. It does have a number of more than very decent moments, but overall it doesn’t quite have the consistency of most other albums.\n\nAs mentioned last week, the album was preceded by a digital release of The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend. I was certainly anticipating a physical release for any future singles to be taken from the album, but that’s not how it turned out. I genuinely can’t recall if there was a digital download made available for this one, but there was a promo video put out for fans to enjoy\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Don’t Take Me Home Until I’m Drunk\n\nTrack 8 on El Rey, and one that was co-written by guitarist Chris McConville who had joined back in 2006 but was soon to leave again after the promotional activities around touring El Rey were completed at the end of 2009. It’s the sort of song you could imagine Cinerama writing and recording, not least for all the references to Breakfast at Tiffany’s and the song title being akin to a line spoken in that film by Holly Golightly, played memorably by Audrey Hepburn.\n\nLater in the year, a box set called How The West Was Won was issued by Vibrant Records. If you want to buy a second-hand copy via Discogs, it is listed under the singles section of music by The Wedding Present. If you head to the band’s website, it is listed under the albums section. No wonder it is proving awkward to keep track of what should be curated as a single for this particular series.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that EPs should be included. How The West Was Won contained four separate CDS, each being called as EP, and each with four tracks. The first of them saw the first physical non-promotional release of the ‘Girlfriend’ EP, while the second was called the Don’t Take Me Home Till I’m Drunk EP.\n\nIn addition to the album version of the song, there was an acoustic take and a remix, which was the work of the song’s co-writer, Chris McConville:-\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present -Don’t Take Me Home Till I’m Drunk (acoustic version)\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Don’t Take Me Home Till I’m Drunk (Team Wah Wah remix)\n\nThe former is, again, what you’d fully expect from its description. The latter has all sort of instrumentation and technical gadgetry thrown at it. It’s certainly different, but it really acts as a reminder that TWP songs don’t really benefit from any sort of radical type of remix.\n\nThe EP contained one entirely new song.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Pinch, Twist, Pull, Release\n\nThere’s no production credits given within the box set, so I’m not sure if this was one that was worked up in the Chicago studio with Steve Albini or at a separate session – the band had been in a couple of studios prior to making the trip to Chicago. It’s kind of TWP by numbers, but I don’t mean that in a derogatory way. It’s a slow, brooding and sad number, with quiet and loud moments throughout, with the protagonist trying hard to explain why this particular relationship has come to an end. It wouldn’t have been out of place on many an album, and feels as if it was kind of wasted by being tucked away on this EP.\n\nI’ll return again to How The West Was Won next Sunday.\n\nJC"
