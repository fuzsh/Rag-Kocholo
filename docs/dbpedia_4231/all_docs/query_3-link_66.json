        "text": "\"Weird Al\" Yankovic, born Alfred Matthew Yankovic, is a multitalented individual who has left an indelible mark on pop culture through his unique brand of humor and musicality. Born in 1959 in Downey, California, he showed early signs of his creative genius. His parents encouraged his love for music, gifting him an accordion on his sixth birthday, a choice that seemed unusual at the time but proved instrumental in shaping his distinctive style. Yankovic rose to prominence as a parodist, crafting satirical versions of popular songs. He first gained national attention during his college years in the late 1970s when he sent homemade tapes of his parodies to radio personality Dr. Demento. His breakthrough arrived in 1984 with his Michael Jackson parody, \"Eat It,\" which became a top 40 hit in several countries and even won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording. This success led to a long, illustrious career filled with many more humorous hits that spoofed the likes of Madonna, Nirvana, and many others. Despite being known mainly for his satirical music, Yankovic's talents extend beyond this realm. He has directed many of his music videos, showcasing his exceptional visual storytelling skills. Additionally, he has lent his voice to numerous animated series, written children's books, and even starred in his film, UHF. Throughout his career, Yankovic has maintained his reputation as a masterful satirist and musician, receiving multiple Grammy Awards and amassing a dedicated fan base. Above all, Weird Al Yankovic's enduring legacy lies in his ability to seamlessly blend music and humor, creating a wildly entertaining experience that transcends generations.\n\nNSYNC (also stylized as *NSYNC or 'N Sync) was an American boy band formed in Orlando, Florida, in 1995 and launched in Germany by BMG Ariola Munich. NSYNC consisted of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass. After heavily publicized legal battles with their former manager Lou Pearlman and former record label Bertelsmann Music Group, the group's second album, No Strings Attached (2000), sold over one million copies in one day and 2.42 million copies in one week, which was a record for over fifteen years. Among the group's singles, \"I Want You Back\", \"Bye Bye Bye\", \"This I Promise You\", \"Girlfriend\", \"Pop\" and \"It's Gonna Be Me\" reached the top 10 in several international charts, with the last being a US Billboard Hot 100 number one. In addition to a host of Grammy Award nominations, NSYNC has performed at the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Olympic Games, and sang or recorded with Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Britney Spears, Phil Collins, Celine Dion, Aerosmith, Nelly, Left Eye, Mary J. Blige, country music supergroup Alabama, and Gloria Estefan. Although NSYNC announced the start of a temporary hiatus in early 2002, the band has not recorded new material since then. In 2007, Lance Bass confirmed that the group had \"definitely broken up\". The band completed five nationwide concert tours and has sold between 50 and 70 million records, becoming the fifth-best-selling boy band in history. Rolling Stone recognized their instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments of all time. Justin Timberlake went on to become one of the world's best-selling music artists, with more than 56 million records sold throughout his solo career.\n\n2AM Club is an American band consisting of vocalists Marc Griffin and Tyler Cordy, guitarist Matt Reagan, keyboard player Dave Dalton, and bassist 'Sauce' Matt Warshauer.

As of late 2012 Patrick Jarrett, professional drummer, has been touring and playing venues with the band. The band came together in Los Angeles in 2007, after Tyler and Dave who are childhood friends and Marc and Reagan who are also childhood friends met Sauce and later Ian 2AM Club brings a diverse array of genres, including hip-hop, rock, electro, rap, and alternative.

They signed to RCA Records and released their first album, and the single, \"All of Me for All of You\". The single reached #5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. 9.9's album reached #79 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and #15 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. 9.9 released a second single titled \"I Like The Way You Dance.\" The group performed on Soul Train, American Bandstand, and Solid Gold. They also provided backing vocals for a single with Patti LaBelle called \"Shy\". The group continued until 1987, when disputes over material, production and personal matters forced the group to disband. Leslie Jones now has 2 children and 4 grandchildren and continues to sing in church. Wanda Perry is now married with 2 children.
