        "text": "Career as a session and guest musician\n\nAs the Fabulous Poodles reached the end of their shelf-life Bobbyâs career as a session musician began. Since that time he has played violin, mandolin or guitar, or sung, on many hit records, in many countries, and on a great many more misses. And, of course, he has also played and sung on many album tracks, TV and radio commercials, film and TV soundtracks as well as touring work.\n\nWe asked him for some memories:\n\nâYoung at Heartâ by the Bluebells. (UK No.1 for 5 weeks)\n\nâThis ended up as a bit of a mess; a Court Case that shouldnât have happened etc, but in the end it was accepted that I wrote the famous (and annoying) violin hook line that the record hangs on â Iâm in the middle of a book.â\n\nâA great record made by a couple of great producers â Bob Andrews and Colin Fairly. The acoustic guitar was played by Billy Bremner - the unsung hero.â\n\nThe song was a hit for a second time in 1993 thanks to itâs use in a TV commercial for the VW Golf. Click here to view\n\nBluebells Court Case Press\n\nThere has been a number of articles relating to the Bluebells court case. They can be seen at the following links:\n\nBluebells court case press - Evening Standard\n\nBluebels court case press - BBC News\n\nBluebells court case press - The Guardian\n\nThe Mark Knopfler shows\n\nâI first met Mark in 1977 when we both lived in Deptford in S.E. London but we never played together at that time. So it was a great pleasure to say âYesâ when his manager called and asked if I would help with the promotional tour for his solo album âSailing to Philadelphiaâ and learn the fiddle part to âWhat It Isâ\n\nIt was very enjoyable playing with some of the best musicians in the UK and one of the greatest guitar players, and songwriters, the world has ever known. During the promo tours we ate in some of the worldâs better restaurants.â\n\nâEclecticâ by Big Country\n\nâThis is an âunpluggedâ album and was recorded live at Dingwalls in London after I had one day rehearsal. I also did the subsequent tour to promote the record, the shows sounded better than the record. I must say it was fun doing the famous âbagpipeâ guitar licks on the violin because they didnât work on acoustic guitars.â\n\nâStuart Adamson, - sadly missedâ.\n\nThe Men They Couldnât Hang (TMTCH)\n\nâThe Men hate it when I call them âThe Men That Arenât Well Hungâ but I canât resist the gag.â\n\nâI have played on most of their albums and live many, many times, thoroughly enjoying every minute. I reckon they are the acceptable face of modern British folk music â they donât do âHey Nonny Nonny Noâ or Diddily Diddily music, which does seem prevalent in the current crop of UK folk artists. And no finger in the ear.â\n\nBobby has Worked With:\n\nAlabama 3; Any Trouble; Michael Ball; B*witched; Big Country; Bluebells; The Blues Band; Max Boyce; Billy Bragg; Bronski Beat; Sam Brown; Cactus Rain; The Christians; B.J.Cole; Andrew Cunningham; Bob Dylan; Electric Bluebirds; Anne Dudley; Fabulous Poodles; The Ferns; Langer & Winstanley; Lena Fiagbe; Guy Fletcher; Bob Geldof; The Godfathers; The Lost Gonzo Band; The Grants; Roger McGuinn; Rolf Harris; Haysi Fantayzee; Holly & The Italians; Hulk Hogan; Jools Holland; John Illsey; Patricia Kaas; Brian Kennedy; Gaspar Lawal; Los Pistoleros; Nick Lowe & His Cowboy Outfit; Des OâConnor; SinÃ©ad OâConnor; The Mad Professor; Mark Knopfler; Kirsty MacColl; Rory McGrath; Andy McCoy; The Men They Couldnât Hang; Don Mescal; Mark Nevin; Amanda Norman-Sell; Mike Oldfield; Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers; Phil Pope; Private Lives; The Proclaimers; Redland Palomino Co.; Reno Brothers; Red Box; Les Rita Mitsouko; Andy Roberts; Style Council; Jah Shaka; Swill and the Swagger Band; The Tempest; The Tower; Shania Twain; Luke Vibert; Tony Visconti; Hank Wangford; Roger Whittaker; The Woolpackers; Paul Young; Alvin Youngblood-Hart"
