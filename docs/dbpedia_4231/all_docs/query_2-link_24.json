        "text": "Forum\n\nReplyCambridge- the carabao cup adventure starts here - match thread\n\nat 23:13 12 Aug 2024\n\nI looked on the Cambridge United forum and they said Richards didn't seem quite “on it”, on his debut the other day. Forum\n\nThreadWater On Mars\n\nat 22:14 12 Aug 2024\n\nScientists have discovered water on Mars accordng to the Beeb.\n\nI said to the Guv in the Cow & Hedge, “there's more water up there than there is in your beer Ted”.\n\nForum\n\nReplyGuitar playing thread\n\nat 22:04 12 Aug 2024\n\nGreat ! Thanks mate - not normally my type of music but I always liked it and I think I may have the record somewhere.\n\nI can sleep tonight !\n\nPs….just bought the CD from Musicmagpie for a fiver….\n\n[Post edited 12 Aug 22:46]\n\nForum\n\nReplyGuitar playing thread\n\nat 21:40 12 Aug 2024\n\nAny ageing muso help me with this ?\n\nMy wife was watching TV and I was doing the crossword and having a beer as per usual.\n\nMention was made on TV of a majorette. Immediately a song came into what I call my mind. I think it was 70s, probably English and a line in the chorus was “she's a majorette” with the singer's voice lifting sharply to utter “majorette”\n\nI can't get it out of my head.\n\nNothing on Google. Forum\n\nReplyThis Sky deal?\n\nat 20:22 12 Aug 2024\n\nI wrote to the EFL once and was just brushed off. I wrote to Sky expressing my concern about how many of our matches they'd “picked” and I don't think they read my letter as the reply said. “ don't worry there'll be plenty of opportunities to watch your team on Sky. Forum\n\nReplyThis Sky deal?\n\nat 18:53 12 Aug 2024\n\nI'd like to think he powers that be at the club read threads like this. I'm sure our thoughts are echoed among supporters of the other Champ teams. Forum\n\nReplyPlymouth\n\nat 22:34 11 Aug 2024\n\nFair comment. For some reason also, I quite like Plymouth and hope they do well, after a certain match in the western regions of London soon that is. Forum\n\nReply12.30pm Saturday kick off.\n\nat 09:27 11 Aug 2024\n\nSky of course have little but contempt for the fans.\n\nThe clubs have sold their loyal fans down the river.\n\nThe TV money was of course too high to reject but as we all know, extra money coming in goes straight to the pockets of players and agents.\n\nI hated yesterday. Still, only two months 'til the first Saturday game… Forum\n\nReplyPubs serving?\n\nat 10:47 10 Aug 2024\n\nI thought Spoons started serving at eight ? Mind you, I'm boycotting Spoons - I've had a few jiffy bellies after drinking in the two in Hammersmith."
