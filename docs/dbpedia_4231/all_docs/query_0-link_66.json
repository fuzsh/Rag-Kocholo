        "text": "Hank Wangford is a distinguished English country and western songwriter. Hank Wangford is the stage name of Dr. Samuel Hutt, b.1940. His music is notable for its humour and cheerful irony, and occasional excursions into biting political undercurrent.\n\n\"Hank is a good smoke screen. He can do things I can't do. He's my clown,\" says Dr. Hutt, who has been struggling to balance his musical and medical interests ever since medical school at Cambridge University. His 1960's practice in a drug-addiction centre brought him into contact with a lot of rockers and modest renown as London's long-haired, rock-and-roll doctor. \"If The Who had a first night, the tickets would be sent. I actually had more of an identity crisis with that than with Hank, because Hank is a fool. I quite like him. Dr. Sam was definitely threatening to become a monster.\" [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=940DE1DD1E31F935A35750C0A96E948260] ,\n\nA chance meeting with former Byrds member Gram Parsons [http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/hank/index.htm] , who played him the song 'You're still on my mind', led him to country music.\n\nAlthough his first recordings in the Hank Wangford guise were made with a group of leading session musicians, he now works with a group - The Hank Wangford Band. There have been at least four incarnations of the band, and a significant feature of the various lineups has been the number of high quality musicians who have appeared with him.\n\nA common feature of the early bands was the ever present stage humour, including frequent references to 'our recent 1982 country and western tour of Nepal' along with mention of the shows being sponsored by Sincere Products 'the makers of the only genuine reproduction Hank Wangford products'. One of their standard lines to the audience (especially when selling band souvenirs from the stage) is 'We urge you good people to patronise us the way we are going to go on patronising you.'\n\nIn earlier years, the band usually closed the show with the theme song 'Jogging with Jesus' which celebrated the delights of Clissold Park (and its pond).\n\nThe second variant of the Hank Wangford Band included Amos Avaczyk-Daley (bass) (aka Gary Taylor), Milton Keynes alias Billy Three-Knees, a genuine Prawnee Indian (drums) (aka Howard Tibble), Brad Breath (lead - pronounced as in the metal - guitar) (aka Andy Roberts), Irma Cetas (vocalist) (aka Melanie Harrold), and Manly Footwear (pedal steel guitar) (aka B. J. Cole). This lineup broke up in 1984 after appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival although Andy Roberts, BJ Cole and Melanie Harrold have occasionally returned to play live dates with Hank. BJ and Melanie most recently being featured in the 5th October 2007 show at the Half Moon, Putney.\n\nBoeing Duveen, another one of Sam Hutt's alter egos, has recently uploaded two clips of video on YouTube showing this band at its best, appearing at the 1982 Cambridge Folk Festival.\n\nA third version of the band took a more rock orientated approach to country music with a complete change in personnel. Joining the band were Cissy Footwear (vocals) (aka Kathy O'Donoghue), Bobby Valentino (fiddle and vocals), Jett Atkins (guitar) (aka Mick Dyche), George Hamilton VI (bass) (aka Richie Robertson) and Big Mac (drums) (aka Alan Coulter). After George Hamilton VI left the band, the role of bass player was taken over by Cherry Red Footwear (aka Clare Kenny).\n\nDuring the NUM miners strike in 1984/85, the Hank Wangford Band toured extensively with Billy Bragg and the Frank Chickens as 'Hank, Frank and Billy' performing at trade union benefit and anti-racist gigs. It was during such a benefit for the Greater London Council (GLC) in 1984 that Hank and the band were attacked on stage by a group of right wing skinheads, an event that has been immortalised in the song 'On the line'.\n\nThe 1984 Edinburgh Fringe Festival saw the Hank and the Wangfords achieve fame (if not fortune) with their show being nominated for the Perrier Award. Fringe Sunday also saw the importation to Edinburgh of the sport of cowpat flinging. Unfortunately, this required hard cow pats as an essential part of the process. Radio 1 dj Andy Kershaw had to put out an appeal for cowpats [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/jul/30/mondaymediasection.edinburghfestival2001] which later had to be dried in a microwave oven for them to work successfully. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/aug/10/comment.edinburgh04]\n\nHank currently tours and plays as Hank Wangford and The Lost Cowboys. This is a return to a more folk and country orientated approach and the current lineup is Hank with Reg Meuross (vocals, banjo and guitar), Martin Belmont (guitar and six stringed bass), Kevin Foster (bass) and Roy Dodds (drums). During 2008 BJ Cole has appeared with the band on a number of occasions, due to the inadvertant clashing of dates of solo performances by Reg Meuross, and this arrangement looks likely to continue, although Reg will play with the band from time to time.\n\nRecent set lists have contained a mixture of songs written by Hank or Reg along with a selection of cover versions of classic country songs.\n\nIn 2008 Hank completed a new album \"Whistling In The Dark\" with the Lost Cowboys and his old friend and colleague BJ Cole who was Manley Footwear in the early '80s incarnation of the band and producer of Hank's first two albums. BJ Cole is the UK's greatest pedal steel and dobro player and has added a new dimension to Hank's recorded work.\n\nHe also tours with Reg Meuross on the 'No Hall Too Small' tour of village halls throughout the UK as part of the Arts Council funded Rural Touring Scheme. Hank and Reg were involved in a major road accident following a short tour of village halls in Scotland at the beginning of September 2007 when Reg's car was clipped by a speeding motor cycle causing the car to lose control. It then hit rocks either side of the highway resulting in the car to roll over a number of times before eventually landing in a peat bog. Apart from severe shock neither musician suffered any injury, thanks to the car being filled with the PA system and equipment flight cases which kept the structural integrity of the car intact thus stopping Hank and Reg from being crushed. The motor cyclist managed to retain control after the collision and didn't stop.\n\nHank works as a family planning doctor for the NHS. After the fall and execution of Nicolae Ceauşescu he has spent a lot of time in Romania helping to set up a family planning infrastructure, including training nurses and doctors in prescribing contraception. Ceauşescu had discouraged family planning in an attempt to increase the population of Romania. Many infants were abandoned in orphanages as a result of this policy.\n\nHank also writes an occasional series of travel articles [http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2000/oct/14/argentina] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2001/mar/03/caribbean.guardiansaturdaytravelsection] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2001/jun/30/unitedstates.newyork.guardiansaturdaytravelsection] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2002/jan/26/unitedstates.guardiansaturdaytravelsection1] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2002/apr/13/unitedstates.culturaltrips.guardiansaturdaytravelsection] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2002/aug/31/unitedstates.guardiansaturdaytravelsection] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2003/mar/22/romania.guardiansaturdaytravelsection] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/may/28/sanfrancisco.usa] for The Guardian newspaper and is president of the 'Nude Mountaineering Society' [http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2007/sep/27/mounteverest.climbingholidays] .\n\nThe name \"Hank Wangford\" is amusing to British ears since it suggests the English slang word wank. This was emphasised by the name the band some times gave themselves- 'Hank Wangford and the Hankerers - featuring The Jodrelles'. Jodrelles is from Jodrell Bank, Jodrell being rhyming slang for 'wank'.\n\nDiscography\n\n*\"Hank Wangford\", Cow Pie Records (COW 1), 1980\n\n*\"The Hank Wangford Band Live\", Cow Pie Records (COW 2), 1982.\n\n*\"The Hank Wangford Band, Rodeo Radio\", Situation Two (SITU 16), 1985.\n\n*\"The Hank Wangford Band, Cowboys Stay On Longer\", Sincere Sounds (Honky 1X), 1987 (12\")\n\n*\"The Hank Wangford Band, Cowboys Stay On Longer\", Sincere Sounds (Honky 1A-DJ), 1987 (7\")\n\n;CD's\n\n*\"Hank Wangford -- Cowboys Stay On Longer\" Reissue Albums One and Two $incere $ounds 2001\n\n*\"Hank Wangford -- Stormy Horizons\" $incere $ounds 1990\n\n*\"Hank Wangford & The Lost Cowboys -- Hard Shoulder To Cry On\" Live Album $incere $ounds 1993\n\n*\"Hank Wangford & The Lost Cowboys -- Wake Up Dead\" $incere $ounds 1997\n\n*\"Hank Wangford & The Lost Cowboys -- Best Foot Forward\" $incere $ounds 2003\n\n*\"Hank Wangford & The Lost Cowboys -- Whistling In The Dark\" $incere $ounds 2008 - due out in the summer\n\n;Cassettes\n\n*\"The Hank Wangford Band Bumper Box\", Cow Pie Records (CCP1) 1981\n\n*\"The Hank Wangford Band - Rootin' Tootin' Santa Claus\", Cow Pie Records (CCP2) 1982\n\nReferences and sources\n\nReferences\n\n*\"Hank Wangford Volume III The Middle Years\" as told to Sam Hutt, Pan London 1989, ISBN 0-330-30925-0\n\n*\"Lost Cowboys From Patagonia to the Alamo\" by Hank Wangford.
