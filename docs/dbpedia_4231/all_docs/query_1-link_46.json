This became the basis for Working Week, a project that took a melange of latin, soul and jazz into the world of pop and dance music. Born out of the burgeoning Latin Jazz Dance scene in London clubs such as the Electric Ballroom and the Wag, the new band mixed jazz with modish Latin dance rhythms and vocals by singers such as Juliet Roberts, Julie Tippetts ne Driscoll, Robert Wyatt and Tracy Thorn. They became a dominating force in the 80s British jazz revival, the movement that made jazz fashionable again, introducing it to a new young audience and instigating a great upsurge in new talent onto the British Jazz Scene. The band toured extensively in Europe and Japan, performing at most of Europe’s major Jazz Festivals, recording five albums for Virgin Records.\n\nSince then he has had different projects of his own across the range of his interests from totally improvised small groups and solo performances to “Jazz Rap” ( QRZ?) in the early 1990s, “FreeJazz TechnoFunk” (Game Theory) early 2000s, “Psychedelic Hip Hop” ( Stonephace) ( which stormed the Tolmen Centre in the mid 2000s) and freeish “Spiritual Jazz” (Stonephace Stabbins with Zoe Rahman) around 2010.\n\nHe appears at the Tolmen playing saxophones, flute and bass clarinet with a new version of the classic acoustic jazz trio improvising on tunes from across the post war years, with the cream of new young Cornish jazz musicians, Tom Dauncey on Bass and Taylor Daley on Drums.\n\nOne of the true greats of British music ……..Gilles Peterson BBC Radio 1\n\n“One of the most innovative saxophonists in Britain”\n\nAnthony Wood — The Wire Magazine\n\n“Larry Stabbins is a consummate saxophonist who has been at the cutting edge of jazz for much of his career”\n\nIan Carr -Rough Guide to Jazz\n\nVenue Opens: 18:00\n\nEvent Starts: 19:30\n\nTickets £12/10(discount)\n\nWe will be holding this event downstairs, providing more of a jazz-club feel.

Foot-stomping reels blend into timeless songs and ambient immersive instrumentals – this is music infused with an unshakeable sense of place. Expect evocative island soundscapes, with samples of field recordings woven through songs of the sea, celebrating the resilience of a creative, independent island community and transporting audiences to this truly beautiful place.\n\nPiers Lewin has lived on the tiny island of St Agnes, Isles of Scilly for twenty five years. Following the disappointing realisation that his island home (unusually for a Celtic outpost) has no surviving indigenous music, he has made it his personal mission to compose and perform music that reaches the very heart of the place. Early on in this quest, he began collaborating with award-winning composer and producer John Patrick Elliott, a regular visitor to the islands.\n\nHaving worked together on numerous Scilly-based musical projects over the years, the duo conceived Lost Songs of Scilly in 2023 to create and share a new and vibrant version of the island sound, drawing on all this experience of setting Scilly to music. The result: a unique album and live experience, touring the UK in summer 2024.\n\nMuch of the music is created and recorded outside in the landscape – the ambience of wind and wave reflecting Scilly’s unspoilt soundscape. Many of the dance tunes draw inspiration from the powerful traditional Celtic music of neighbouring Cornwall, while the songs distill the rich stories and complex traditions of a remarkable, resilient maritime community.\n\nEvery note of this music is saturated in a profound sense of place – the aim of each performance is to take everyone in the audience, just for a night, to this unique and magical island.\n\nwww.lostsongsofscilly.com\n\n*New music from Lost Songs of Scilly due for release January 2024*\n\nA selection of music Piers Lewin and John Patrick Elliott have collaborated on for other projects can be found on the above website.\n\nVarious Press for Piers & John’s other musical projects:\n\n“Bold and different…stretches boundaries.”\n\nThe Guardian\n\n“Entrancing…deeply atmospheric…songwriting of a real rich quality.”\n\nClash\n\nTickets £14\n\n£10 (discount)\n\n£7 (children)\n\nVenue Opens: 18:00\n\nEvent Starts: 19:30\n\nGET TICKETS\n\nMusic\n\nTHE MYSTERY GUEST TOUR\n\nA Celebration of Collaboration, Togetherness and Community.”\n\nThe In The Round Mystery Tour, featuring Daisy Chute, Hollie Rogers, and Lady Nade, is set to bring a unique experience to venues across the UK.

In 2020, these three singer- songwriters, (Lucy Ward, Svavar Knutur and Adyn Townes) were selected to take part in a virtu- al global music sharing experiment called Global Music Match. Teamed up together, they spent several lockdowns turning their stories into soft harmonies and intricate melodies. This year, they cashed in their stagnant travel points and recorded their debut album in Iceland. It will be released in October 2023 and accompanied by an extensive UK tour.\n\nThe album is an evocative and seamless blend of these three critically acclaimed artists signa- ture styles; it is heartfelt and powerful, with songs that take in the breadth of the human condi- tion. It is an album that masterfully explores love, mystery, folklore and longing, each track united by having great story telling at its heart.\n\nOn stage, the rapport between Ward Knutur Townes is effervescent. Each one of them is skilled in holding an audience alone, so there is an utter magic to watching their joyful, authentic ca- maraderie unfold. Audiences are welcomed as friends and leave a WKT show having laughed and cried; feeling truly uplifted by their epic stage presence and, undoubtedly, moved by their music.\n\nTickets £10, £15\n\nGET TICKETS\n\nMusic\n\nClive Carroll plays the music of John Renbourn\n\n+ with special guest Dariush Kanani\n\nFor those who followed the folk revival of the 1960’s and the music of the cult band Pentangle, John Renbourn’s music needs little introduction. Spanning musical genres from blues and jazz through to folk, early music and original compositions he left behind a sumptuous catalogue of recordings which demonstrated not only his extraordinary talent as a guitar player but also his great musical depth. Any boundaries which may have existed previously were blurred by John’s eclectic taste, alongside a level of artistry and delicacy which led the way in the evolution of the steel-strung guitar.\n\nHere is a rare, one-off opportunity to hear some of John’s greatest compositions performed live by one of the World’s finest guitarists who regularly shared the same stage. Clive Carroll was recently described by Total Guitar Magazine as “…arguably the most accomplished fingerstylist in the world today…” and like John, he is equally at home playing Mississippi Blues as he is playing the Elizabethan lute music of John Dowland. On stage, Clive’s entertaining performance transfixes audiences whether they are guitar enthusiasts or not. Coupled with Dariush Kanani’s stunningly good technique inspired by his heroes John Renbourn and Bert Jansch, this one-time show is not to be missed! This tour coincides with the release of Clive’s new album which features the music of John Renbourn\n\nTickets £14, £10, £7\n\nMusic\n\nGILMORE AND ROBERTS\n\nContemporary folk/acoustic duo Gilmore & Roberts combine award- winning songwriting with astounding musicianship and their trademark harmonies to create a powerful wall of sound.\n\nNominated three times at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, Katriona Gilmore (fiddle, mandolin) and Jamie Roberts (guitar) met while studying at Leeds College of Music and released their debut album in 2008.\n\nSince then, the duo have toured Canada and mainland Europe, played some of the UK’s biggest acoustic festivals, toured with folk rock legends Fairport Convention and won countless accolades for their genre-spanning work.

This is a duo who\n\nlove what they play and play what they love with panache, humour, delight and rather a lot of\n\ncommentary on the downside of being a human.\n\nSeeing and hearing them will leave you with a smile on your face and a glowing heart of delight.\n\nYou might not think that is possible when you’ve just spent some time hearing the themes of the\n\nsongs they lay before an audience but it is testament to their sunny dispositions, infectious laughter\n\nand amused self-deprecation that you can only come away from a gig feeling a whole heap better\n\nabout yourself and life.\n\n“…stunning harmonies that were so good it reminded me of seeing Gillian Welch and David\n\nRawlings”\n\nNo Depression\n\n“It is so rare an opening act rival the main performance but that is exactly what the\n\nseamless harmony singing Black Feathers achieved”\n\nJumpin’ Hot Club\n\n“The pure emotion and subtle timing of their song delivery is as evident as the enjoyment radiating from their onstage chemistry”\n\nTicket price £15.00/£10.00\n\nMusic\n\nPhil Beer\n\nPhil Beer is the multi-instrumental half of the west country’s award-winning acoustic duo, Show of Hands.

Etheridge is celebrating his 40th year as a professional musician and, somehow, he’s managed to be at the forefront of jazz and ‘jazz-connected’ music at all times. Many in the audience would have remembered Etheridge coming to public notice in the 1970s as part of the jazz fusion band Soft Machine. This concert was part of the two week long London Jazz Festival and the duo’s musical mix demonstrated jazz is just as much a hybrid music now as it was in its birth pangs of the 1890s. They began with Mercy Street by Peter Gabriel, an old school pal of Etheridge’s, followed with the Sonny Rollins tune Pent-up House, then moved seamlessly to a piece from William Walton’s film score for Henry V. And so it continued. The two players combatted with their musically adventurous spirit – completely sure of each other, yet still able to sparkle and surprise. There were some musical memories of Etheridge’s years working with French violinist Stephane Grappelli and a resultant moment of homage to Django Reinhardt with a closing abstract playing of his masterwork, Nuages.\n\nMusic\n\nChristmas Classics\n\nBournmouth Symphony Orchestra Mixed Ensemble\n\nOn Your Doorstep concerts bring the orchestra closer to live audiences across the South West.

Her trademark lies in remarkably mature songwriting, a marked empathy with the environment and a strong sense of place. Carried by a clear voice ‘controlled yet wild’ (Folk Radio), her lyrics touch on intervention and rewilding, climate change and migration, woman’s age-old relationship with textiles and the land, and the changing face of the natural world. From the starling murmurations on the Somerset Levels to the lowly eel’s epic transatlantic migration, the coasts and estuaries of the South West and the small part we ourselves play in a much bigger picture, her songs are bound by the underlying theme of mankind’s relationship with the wild. Cerebral and topical, honest and immediate, these are not throwaway lyrics or everyday melodies but thought-provoking and evocative compositions with wonderfully crafted soundscapes.\n\nHer debut album Namer Of Clouds was one of The Guardian’s Best Folk Albums of 2018, and has seen airplay across BBC Radio 2, 3, 4 and 6 Music.

A fortuitous meeting in North London brought them together and they have developed a highly personal repertoire from an eclectic mix of music, original and traditional. Both performers have taken from a wide range of influences. Etheridge has over the years worked in classical, jazz and progressive rock, from Soft Machine to joining forces with such names as Stephan Grapelli, Nigel Kennedy, John Williams and Chris Garrick. Rowe’s span seems almost instinctive, effortlessly absorbing and blending the worlds of all the great soul and jazz singers into a personal mix, including Indian classical, African folk, and Syrian Aramaic. She has performed as Billie Holliday in the musical Cafe Society, worked with Paco Pena’s flamenco troupe, and has many original compositions to her name.\n\nOne of the defining features of the duo’s work is the commitment and passion of their delivery. Rowe is a fiery performer by any standards, yet the paring down to just two brings intimacy as well as drama, from the big effect to the delicate gesture. The pieces are carefully chosen to surprise, but above all to take the audience on an emotional journey through joy and pain, sombre and swinging, dark and light: a real musical journey.\n\n“John Etheridge has explored many genres, styles and legacies in his career, but his curiosity never dimmed, and in Vimala Rowe he has found a singer of quite astonishing versatility and adaptability” - London Jazz News\n\n‘Out of the Sky’ review: “A recording that simmers with a quiet intensity.

He travels the length and breadth of the UK and beyond, giving rapt audiences passion, sorrow, love, beauty, tragedy and majesty through his playing. In this show, he will be playing songs from his brand new album, ‘Trails and Tribulations’, to be released on September 1st, as well as older material.\n\n40 years after he recorded his first album, Golden Vanity, in 1976, Martin is known as a guitarist of formidable talent. Equally at home playing English traditional folk, American folk and blues and his own compositions, he is consistently named as one of the very finest fingerstyle guitar players in the world. He is listed in Gibson Guitars’ Top 30 Acoustic Guitarists of all time, and Acoustic Guitar readers voted him number 12 guitarist in the world in 2005.\n\nUniversally acclaimed as one of the finest ever acoustic and slide guitar players, and a fine banjo-picker to boot, his solo shows bear witness to an artist at the very top of his game. Whether interpreting material from tradition or singing his own potent self-penned songs, Simpson is a remarkable storyteller: captivating and profoundly moving. His own songwriting produced the poignant ‘Never Any Good’, from Prodigal Son, 2007’s Folk Album of the Year.\n\nMartin continues to collaborate with a dazzling array of people from across the musical spectrum: Jackson Browne, Martin Taylor, June Tabor, Richard Hawley, Bonnie Raitt, Danny Thompson, David Hidalgo, Danú, Richard Thompson and Dom Flemons are among the great musicians he has worked with.\n\nHe has had the most nominations of any performer in the 15 years of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, an astonishing 31 times, 12 of those as Musician of the Year, winning that particular accolade twice.\n\nA virtuoso player without question, but above all Martin Simpson conveys his diverse treasure trove of material from the heart, performing with rare subtlety, intensity and honesty. A true master of his art.\n\n“Martin is in a class of his own. He is such an expressive player; he is ingenious in his use of the guitar. You can listen to one of his songs and three or four minutes in, he has only used the top four strings and not even played a bass note yet, and when he does, it feels like an orchestra coming in. His clarity of playing is just amazing.” Jackson Browne\n\n“One of the virtuoso instrumentalists of the English music scene” ‘Sounds better than ever’ **** 4 Stars The Guardian\n\n“Simpson has become a fine interpreter of traditional and other songs, as well as a notable writer of his own.” The Times\n\n‘Simpson’s latest is a potent blend of the highest calibre…Simpson has never sung or played better’ Acoustic Magazine\n\nCarmina\n\nA superb mix of jazz, folk and celtic crossover music - taking the audience on a bewitching journey full of melodic grace and inventiveness The line-up features award-winning songwriters Pippa Marland and Rob King and London jazz piano legend Geoff Castle, inspirational Irish guitarist and vocalist Paul Bradley and virtuoso fiddle player Gina Griffin.\n\n‘Glorious... gorgeously haunting’ - Time Out (London ‘Celtic jazz which mesmerises and bewitches’ - Irish Times\n\nTickets £11, £10\n\n[website url=\"carmina.co.uk\"]\n\nHunter Muskett\n\nHunter Muskett is an acoustic/electric 4-piece playing distinctive original songs in a folky, bluesy sometimes Americana vein.
