Soon he instigated a group - the Hank Wangford Band, a band noted for its humour and cheerful irony.\n\nThere have been at least four incarnations of the band, and a significant feature of the various lineups has been the number of high quality musicians who have appeared with him. For example, the second incarnation of the Hank Wangford Band included Amos Avaczyk-Daley (bass) (aka Gary Taylor), Milton Keynes alias Billy Three-Knees, a genuine Prawnee Indian (drums) (aka Howard Tibble), Brad Breath (lead - pronounced as in the metal - guitar) (aka Andy Roberts), Irma Cetas (vocalist) (aka Melanie Harrold), and Manly Footwear (pedal steel guitar) (aka B. J. Cole). This lineup broke up in 1984 after appearing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nA third version of the band took a more rock orientated approach to country music with a complete change in personnel. Joining the band were Cissy Footwear (vocals) (aka Kathy O'Donoghue), Bobby Valentino (fiddle and vocals), Jett Atkins (guitar) (aka Mick Dyche), George Hamilton VI (bass) (aka Richie Robertson) and Big Mac (drums) (aka Alan Coulter). After George Hamilton VI left the band, the role of bass player was taken over by Cherry Red Footwear (aka Clare Kenny)."
