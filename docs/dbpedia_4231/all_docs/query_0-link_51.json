        "text": "Roberts was ubiquitous in the 70s\n\nLiverpool Scene, Plainsong,\n\nGrimms and various other hardtouring,\n\nif largely unsung,\n\naggregations. Later he would be a\n\nsupport musician in the Pink Floyd\n\nset-up, and after that, the guitarplaying\n\nsidekick of country-singing\n\ngynaecologist Hank Wangford.\n\nThe Great Stampede was his\n\n1973 shot at stardom. and was\n\nreleased on the American Elektra\n\nlabel – suitably so, as Roberts’\n\nmusical heart lies on that side of\n\nthe Atlantic. Musicians include BJ\n\nCole, Britain’s king of the steel\n\nguitar, Zoot Money on keys, and\n\nFotheringay’s rhythm section.\n\nScarcely a note is wasted. Clowns\n\nOn The Road, reflecting his time\n\nwith musical comedians Grimms,\n\nis particularly poignant."
