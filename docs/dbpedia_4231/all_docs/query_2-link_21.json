Hank will pull them in with stories of country and life on the road, Spanner will entrance with her beautiful heartfelt singing and celestial harmonies and Brad will amaze with his baritone song stylings, yodelling and the occasional rope trick. There will be classic songs from the Wangford Hall of Pain and new tunes from Rancho Wangford.\n\nHank Wangford, Brad Breath and Anna 'The Spanner' Robinson will be at Colwall Village Hall on Saturday, November 19 at 8pm.
