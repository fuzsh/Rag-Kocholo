        "text": "CD\n\nFLED 3093CD\n\nFledg'ling are very proud to bring Westering Home to CD. Westering Home was originally released in 1972. John Surman plays everything on the album, drawing together many of the threads of his earlier recordings with the possibilities offered by technology (and his own prodigious musicality). \"I took a break from being on the road. This was just around the time when mono had become stereo, and then - in a flash - multi-track recording became possible. I was fascinated by the possibilities of, say, three bass clarinets on different tracks improvising together. Plus I had a curiosity about 'radiophonics' and tape manipulation and Pierre Henry's musique concrete. So it was in that spirit that I started work on what was to become Westering Home.\" Surman was born in Tavistock, North Devon. He initially gained recognition playing baritone saxophone in the Mike Westbrook Band in the mid-1960s, and was soon heard regularly playing soprano saxophone and bass clarinet as well. Surman developed a fearsome reputation as a prolific collaborator and session musician, before recording a series of albums under his own name beginning with the eponymous John Surman in 1969. His relationship with ECM Records has been continuous from the late 1970s to the present; Surman has recorded prolifically for the label playing bass clarinet, recorders, soprano and baritone saxophones and using synthesizers, both solo and with a wide range of other musicians.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3101CD\n\nAt the time of its original release in 1973, Morning Glory, seemed a surprising departure for saxophonist John Surman. It seemed to owe more to the music being made by Miles Davis, Weather Report and Tony Williams' Lifetime in the USA or Ian Carr's Nucleus and Soft Machine in the UK than it did to the often abstract, free but determinedly acoustic music that Surman had pioneered up to that point. Hindsight tells another story. Morning Glory stands as both a consolidation of his work to date and, like the solo Westering Home (FLED 3093CD), it offers a signpost for his work in subsequent years. Surman chose his partners for the recording very carefully, drawing from his friends and trusted collaborators. In particular, Terje Rypdal on electric guitar and John Taylor on both acoustic and electric pianos allows for an expanded musical palette. The rhythm section of Malcolm Griffiths on trombone, Chris Laurence on bass and John Marshall's chattering drums lay down a remarkably elastic rhythmic counterpoint. All of these musical signatures would become even more evident in his later recordings for ECM. Re-mastering from the original master tapes supervised by John Surman.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n7\"\n\nWING 1004EP\n\nRestocked, last copies... RSD 2016 release. Limited edition of 800. At the beginning of Shirley Collins's recording career in 1959, she recorded a series of limited 7\" EPs for the Collector Records label, which have since become quite rare. This remastered reissue of English Songs Volume 2 (the third of her Collector EPs) is presented in a front-laminated, flipback sleeve, just like the original, and an inner sleeve illustrated with rare photographs. This is the first time this iconic record has been made available as a vinyl EP since its original release. \"Shirley Collins is without doubt one of England's greatest cultural treasures.\" --Billy Bragg\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n7\"\n\nWING 1003EP\n\nFledg'ling Records continues its ongoing series of Shirley Collins's early recordings on 7\" vinyl EP with the release of some previously unreleased early recordings. These four spectral, magical performances were recorded by Alan Lomax in London on October 20, 1957. Collins sings two songs -- \"Bonny Cuckoo\" and \"Bonny Labouring Boy\" -- unaccompanied and with her own banjo accompaniment. These very rare recordings have been carefully remastered from the only known surviving acetate and are packaged in a front-laminated flipback sleeve with a beautifully illustrated inner bag showing rare Shirley Collins photographs and ephemera.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3090CD\n\nJulian Dawson: possibly the UK's most overlooked singer-songwriter. Julian Dawson is well-known on the Continent, especially in Germany, where he has had many chart successes, but in the UK, his recordings have often slipped under the radar. Over the years, collaborations with an eclectic roster of stellar musicians including Gene Parsons, Toots Thielemans, Richard Thompson, and Lucinda Williams have remained a recurring feature of his recorded and live activities. After 22 solo albums, Dawson returned to his friend Dan Penn's studio in Nashville for this entirely analog recording, Living Good. It's a sonically beautiful guitar/vocal performance with a handful of well-chosen guests and spontaneous harmony vocals from the legendary producer. Dawson is a world-class harmonica player, at home in classic UK pop, folk, country, and blues music circles. He has also found success as a record producer for Wolfgang Niedecken and country legend Charlie Louvin, and as an author, with his definitive biography of Nicky Hopkins. The infectious arrangements and joyous tunes on Living Good, including two co-writes with Dan Penn, are destined to bring Dawson's music to a wider audience.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3099CD\n\nSqueezebox maestro John Kirkpatrick has recorded a glorious selection of songs from World War I and II in a program that highlights two different kinds of material -- there's a smattering of the popular hits of the day, interspersed with a selection of songs sung on the front line by service personnel. \"In the main this is a celebration of the comradeship and spirit that allowed those previous generations to Keep Smiling Through. These are the songs these people sang at the time, with the straightforward attitude that was prevalent amongst our glorious forebears -- we're all in this together, so buck up and get on with it.\" It's a sensational and occasionally poignant musical feast.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n7\"\n\nWING 1001EP\n\nAt the beginning of Shirley Collins's recording career, in 1959, she recorded a series of limited 7\" EPs for Collector Records, which have since become quite rare. This remastered edition of The Foggy Dew (the first of her Collector EPs), its first reissue as a vinyl EP, is presented in a front-laminated, flipback sleeve, just like the original, and an illustrated inner bag with period reviews from the archives.

Known primarily as a singer and songwriter, Lal Waterson is shown, through this beautiful new book, to be much more: a versatile and vibrant artist. The 15 songs on the CD confirm her stature as a songwriter of rare imagination, depth, and rich beauty; combine this ability with the many drawings, paintings, thoughts and poems illustrated in the book and a clearer picture emerges of Lal's individual, tender, intense, complex, but ultimately very human talents. Teach Me to Be a Summer's Morning is curated by Lal's daughter Marry Waterson and offers a unique, intimate portrait of Lal, through a wonderful selection of her work, from a life lived making sense of the world through music, words, and pictures. 72-page hardback book with CD -- which features tracks from two reels of demo tapes from 1971 of songs written for her debut recording Bright Phoebus -- some never previously released).\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3094CD\n\nThe live reputation of the mighty Young Tradition lives long in the memories of all who heard them during their brief career. Live recordings were thought not to exist until, 45 years later, an American fan remembered the reel-to-reel recording he'd made at Oberlin College on November 17th, 1968. Carefully restored, these tapes are now released by Fledg'ling Records on CD. The Young Tradition formed on April 18th, 1965 by Peter Bellamy, Royston Wood, and Heather Wood -- with a repertoire from the British folk tradition, style from Carnaby Street and lashings of attitude, they soon firmly established themselves on the folk scene. They recorded for Transatlantic Records and international tours soon followed. Record companies will always make extravagant claims for their releases, but Oberlin 1968 really is a rare and truly wonderful historical release.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n2CD\n\nFLED 3091CD\n\n2CDs for the price of one. Fledg'ling Records are very proud to re-present two fabulous folk-rock albums from the John Kirkpatrick Band. Fronted by England's finest accordion maestro the band included Graeme Taylor (guitars), Michael Gregory (percussion), Dave Berry (bass), and Paul Burgess (fiddle and recorders). Together they recorded some of the most powerful folk-rock of the late 20th century. Force of Habit was originally released in 1996 and Welcome to Hell a year later. The Complete John Kirkpatrick Band brings together both albums and a rare live recording from the Cambridge Folk Festival in one discrete slim-line 2CD digipack with new sleevenotes and all elements of the original artwork.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3089CD\n\nEvery Mortal Place, the new album from the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Musician of the Year 2010 John Kirkpatrick, is an absolutely extraordinary new solo recording from the English \"Squeezebox\" King, concentrating on a traditional repertoire from Shropshire. As John says: \"Having lived in Shropshire for 39 years, and having always included a certain amount of musical material from the county given half a chance, I am proud to announce that I have now completed a whole CD of Shropshire music for Fledg'ling Records.\" The CD is sung and played by John, with Sally Kirkpatrick adding chorus and harmony vocals on five songs. The rather attractive digipack includes full notes giving background to all the tracks and an introduction by no less a personage than Shirley Collins, President of The English Folk Dance & Song Society. \"I know of no one who can match his stage presence, or come near him for integrity, authenticity, variety, humor, and glorious breath-taking bravura in performance... The breadth of his repertoire is quite astounding, pervaded by a great sense of humanity, a true and very fine representation of the common people that most of the songs and music came from. John Kirkpatrick will, for me, always be English music's 'Mighty Heart of Oak.'\" --Shirley Collins\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3092CD\n\nIain Matthews of Fairport Convention, Southern Comfort, and Plainsong fame, returns after a long absence, with a stunning collection of new songs and beautiful arrangements performed with some of Holland's finest jazz players. On paper the pairing of Iain Matthews and Egbert Derix is a strange pairing. Egbert Derix is an established jazz composer from the Netherlands and Iain Matthew's roots have taken hold in contemporary singer/songwriter circles. However, if we break down these borders, look deeper, and think in terms of quality, rather than genres, it's a musical marriage made in heaven. Their second collaborative album focuses around some remarkable new songs. Matthews draws deep upon his recollections of London in the swinging '60s -- \"When the Floyd Were on the Prowl\" and some powerful reflections upon life now -- \"Pebbles in the Road\" and \"Joy Mining.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3088CD\n\nWith Plainsong currently on their 40th anniversary farewell tour, now is the perfect time to re-acquaint ourselves with this fabulous solo collection from ace guitarist Andy Roberts. Urban Cowboy was recorded before the formation of, during and just after the dissolution of the original Plainsong. The album was originally released on the Elektra label in 1973. The new Fledg'ling CD edition comes complete with a 12-page booklet, (worth buying just for Andy's reminiscences from those heady days in the early 1970s) and has been digitally-remastered from the original studio master tapes. The album includes guest appearances from Neil Innes, Richard Thompson, Martin Carthy, B J Cole, Zoot Money and Iain Matthews. Roberts formed Plainsong with Iain Matthews towards the end of 1971 and released the remarkable In Search of Amelia Earhart album the following year. After the group went their separate ways (for a decade and a half), he continued his solo career as a guitarist and a sought-after composer for film and television. Andy Roberts has been a member of the Liverpool Scene, Grimms, Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, Albion Band, Pink Floyd, Roy Harper's Black Sheep, Hank Wangford's Lost Cowboys and many other illustrious ensembles. Throughout his career he has continued to work as an accompanist with some of Britain's leading poets -- Roger McGough, Brian Patten, Willy Russell and many others.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3081CD\n\nFledg'ling Records proudly presents the long-overdue CD release of this remarkable solo performance from 1987 by Chris McGregor. Sea Breezes was recorded during an emotional visit to his homeland by the great South African composer and pianist. McGregor played \"an energetic mixture of Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Sun Ra, but always retained a unique feel due to his South African influences and the intelligent arrangements.\" Over the last four years, Fledg'ling has been collaborating with the Chris McGregor estate to reissue his most important albums and, through a series of unreleased recordings, help to reveal the full extent of his musical activities: from the small-scale trio improvisations through to the majestic large ensemble works of the mighty Brotherhood Of Breath. Carefully mastered from the original master tapes, Sea Breezes is an exciting opportunity to hear McGregor's solo readings of repertoire familiar from the acclaimed final Brotherhood Of Breath album Country Cooking.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3019CD\n\nFledg'ling reissues on CD Shirley And Dolly Collins' For As Many As Will, first released in 1978. The Collins sisters were brought up on the Sussex coast with a strong love and understanding for English traditional song. Through a remarkable series of landmark recordings during the 1960s and 1970s, they helped define the possibilities of the English folksong revival. For As Many As Will, their classic final recording, includes a stunning reading of Richard Thompson's \"Never Again,\" alongside fine traditional material like \"Lord Allenwater,\" \"Gilderoy,\" \"The Moon Shines Bright\" and a medley from John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera.\" The album contains some of the sisters' finest recorded work together, uniting Dolly Collins' fine arranging skills with the haunting beauty of Shirley's voice. Carefully re-mastered from the original master tapes. Released by arrangement with Topic Records. Shirley Collins (vocals) with Dolly Collins (flute organ, piano, synthesizer and vocals); Barry Dransfield (fiddle, cello and vocals); Tony Engle (concertina); Michael Gregory (percussion); Paul Nieman (euphonium); and Phil Pickett (recorders, shawms, curtal, cornett and gittern).\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3087CD\n\nFledg'ling Records are very proud to present April Cruel, the new album from acclaimed singer-songwriter Jason McNiff. This long-awaited collection sees Jason delivering on the promise of his highly-regarded previous albums. What keeps one fascinated by McNiff, live and on record, is his unpredictability -- never the same twice. Jason is an enigmatic character, a troubadour and one of the finest singers from the UK. He is a brilliant guitarist and resolutely follows the path his guitar takes him. Born in Yorkshire of Polish/Irish descent, Jason McNiff has released 3 albums on London-based independent labels. He follows in the line of the finest storytelling of people like Bert Jansch, Richard Thompson and Nick Drake, to the great American singer-songwriters like Bob Dylan, Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy and Leonard Cohen.

It has been a long ten years since Anna Domino and Michael Delory made their debut with the widely-praised Songs From My Funeral. As a solo artist, Anna Domino released four remarkable albums and two EPs for the Belgian label Les Disques du Crepuscule, between 1984 and 1990. Those recordings are often cited as major influences on the British trip-hop movement centered around Massive Attack and Portishead. Yet, the glorious New York summer afternoon that Snakefarm crept into her consciousness, Domino knew she'd found a whole new musical window to leap through -- \"I was waiting for the light\" and said \"We should take a bunch of those great old songs about murder and such, and start doing them with modern arrangements.\" The idea refused to sit still, and as soon as she returned home, Domino and Delory set to work on the experiment. \"Just to see what would happen.\" Though subtle percussion and loops had distinguished her earlier recording, in Snakefarm, Anna wanted the beats to be more prominent, yielding percolating arrangements that could carry the narrative content of the words. It worked. \"It was so much fun,\" confesses the singer, \"the arrangements almost wrote themselves. What surprised me was how it didn't take any forcing at all.\" My Halo At Half-Light continues where the previous album left off and features scintillating arrangements that bring these stories from our collective past into the sunlight of today.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3085CD\n\nAfter 25 years, the mighty Home Service return with a new live album taken from a recently-discovered 1986 tape.

With trumpeter Paul Archibald replacing the late Howard Evans, the band are reforming for a series of high profile festival appearances (and perhaps some new recording). Other members include: Jonathan Davie (electric bass), Howard Evans (trumpet), Andy Findon (saxophone, clarinet, flute), Michael Gregory (drums, percussion), Steve King (keyboards), John Tams (lead vocals, guitar), Graeme Taylor (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Williams and (trombone).\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nFLED 3080CD\n\n\"Sweet England, along with its sister album False True Lovers (FLED 3029CD), was recorded in the spring of 1958 when I was twenty-two years old. I had been living for the previous two years in London with Alan Lomax, the American folklorist, working for him as editorial assistant on his book The Folk Songs of North America and on his field recordings from America, Great Britain, Italy and Spain. The tracks that make up these two albums were recorded by Peter Kennedy and Alan in two days at Peter's home 'studio' in Belsize Park. English traditional music, at its best, expresses and provides everything in song that I need and feel, both musically and emotionally. Sweet England represents the first shaky steps of a journey that I have been on all my life, and that, happily, I still am.\" --Shirley Collins from the new sleeve-notes. Fledg'ling Records are very proud to present a remastered edition of this classic recording from the infancy of the mid-20th century folk revival.

Their recordings paved the way for what has since become known as \"world music.\" High-profile Incredible String Band fans include Paul McCartney, Billy Connolly, Robert Plant and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Signed by Joe Boyd to the prestigious Elektra label, their early recordings are among the finest and most imaginative of the period. The Incredible String Band -- their 1966 debut LP, is a powerful mix of their many influences. Highlights include \"October Song,\" \"When The Music Starts To Play,\" \"Empty Pocket Blues,\" \"Smoke Shovelling Song\" and the closing \"Everything's Fine Right Now.\" For many fans, this beguiling album was the first step in a life-long fascination for all things ISB.
