        "text": "They are joining forces to present English country music doyen and Shed regular Hank Wangford and his “old musical buddy and saddle pal” Brad Breath, alias Andy Roberts, in No Hall 2 Small in a week of shows from October 12 to 16.\n\n“The Shed was the inspiration for my own tour of village halls,” says Hank, who will play shows in North Yorkshire and beyond. “Now the Wangford wagon train will be rolling out for The Shed On Tour with five nights of country and western misery guaranteed.”\n\nHank and guitar, ukulele and Appalachian dulcimer player Brad will team up for an evening of songs and stories from the highway of life at Crayke Sports Club next Wednesday (box office, 01347 822327); Weaverthorpe Village Hall, next Thursday (01944 738617); Ingleby Greenhow Village Hall, next Friday (01642 723492); Carleton Village Hall, next Saturday, 8pm (01756 791356); and Hunmanby Community Centre, next Sunday (01723 891514). All shows start at 7.30pm unless stated otherwise and tickets also are available online at theshed.co.uk/ontour “On this tour, Hank continues to plough his village hall furrow in search of the smallest hall in England, bringing songs and misery from the dark underbelly of country, and this time he’s out on the road with the man who brought the world his classic Glimpse Of Gloom,” says Simon.\n\n“Brad has finally left his rabbit ranch in Two Buttes, Colorado, to rejoin his compadre, the High Priest of Pain, in an evening of yodelling and misery, with heartbreakers and toe-tappers featuring words and lyrics by the boys.”\n\nThe Shed’s £34,000 funding will cover 15 to 16 shows in all between now and next April. “The Shed On Tour will offer people a taste of vintage Shed gigs, as well as the avant-garde ‘improvised happenings’, such as Mrs Boyes’ Bingo featuring percussionist Mark Sanders,” says Simon Apparently, “nine out of ten committee members have never heard of Hank”, but those wishing to learn more about him can tune into BBC Radio York next Tuesday from 2pm for a special Wangford feature before the Weaverthorpe concert.\n\nLater this year, Hank and his Lost Cowboys will be fulfilling their usual winter fixtures at Hovingham Village Hall, playing The Shed’s 19th Birthday Party on December 9 and 10 at 8pm. The Saturday dose of festive misery has sold out but tickets remain available for the first night on 01653 668494 or theshed.co.uk"
