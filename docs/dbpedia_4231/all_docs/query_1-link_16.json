        "text": "Description\n\nWith PLAINSONG currently engaged on their 40th Anniversary farewell tour, now is the perfect time to re-acquaint ourselves with this fabulous solo collection from ace guitarist ANDY ROBERTS. URBAN COWBOY was recorded before the formation of, during and just after the dissolution of the original Plainsong. The album was originally released on the Elektra label in 1973. The new Fledg’ling CD edition comes complete with a 12 page booklet, (worth buying just for Andy’s reminiscences from those heady days in the early 1970s!) and has been digitally re-mastered from the original studio master tapes. The album includes guest appearances from Neil Innes, Richard Thompson, Martin Carthy, B J Cole, Zoot Money and Iain Matthews. Roberts formed Plainsong with Iain Matthews towards the end of 1971 and released the remarkable In Search Of Amelia Earhart album the following year. After the group went their separate ways (for a decade and a half), he continued his solo career as a guitarist and a sought-after composer for film and television.\n\nAndy Roberts has been a member of the Liverpool Scene, Grimms, the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, the Albion Band, Pink Floyd, Roy Harper’s Black Sheep, Hank Wangford’s Lost Cowboys and many other illustrious ensembles. Throughout his career he has continued to work as an accompanist with some of Britain’s leading poets – Roger McGough, Brian Patten, Willy Russell and many others.\n\nTrack list:\n\n1 Charlie\n\n2 Big City Tension\n\n3 New Karenski\n\n4 Urban Cowboy\n\n5 Elaine\n\n6 Home At Last\n\n7 All Around My Grandmother’s Floor\n\n8 Richmond\n\n9 Baby, Baby\n\n10 Poison Apple Lady\n\nANDY ROBERTS : vocals, guitars, dulcimer, Kriwaczek string organ\n\nMARTIN CARTHY : banjo\n\nB J COLE : pedal steel guitar\n\nGERRY CONWAY : tambourine\n\nTIMI DONALD : drums\n\nNEIL INNES : electric guitar\n\nMIKE KELLIE : drums\n\nIAIN MATTHEWS : backing vocals\n\nJOHN MEGGINSON : piano\n\nDICK PARRY : saxophones\n\nDAVE RICHARDS : bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nBOB RONGA : acoustic guitar, harmonium, backing vocals\n\nRICHARD THOMPSON : electric guitar\n\nGILLIAN NOEL, KARENE WALLACE, PAUL KENT & ZOOT MONEY : backing vocals"
