        "text": "gobsmacked by the roar as the band played Plainsong from 1989's Disintegration.\n\nSharing some of the repertoire with the tour programme, the recording covers everything from the delightful simplicity of plainsong chants Resonemus Laudibus and Veni, Veni Emmanuel to the purity of Lassus' polyphonic Videntes Stellam Magi and Byrd's jubilant This Day Christ Was Born.\n\nClive has also toured and recorded with Richard Thompson (1982 to 1992), Nanci Griffith (1996 to 2007), Eddi Reader and Boo Hewerdine (1993 and 1999) and Plainsong (1997).\n\nDespite his complaints about the heat, the band put on a spirited performance of 'Plainsong' before following up with their other 1989 classic, 'Pictures Of You'.\n\nBloch to sing of her a funeral plainsong of profound appreciation, of\n\nIn a hugely enjoyable collection of more than two dozen choral items Jeffrey Skidmore offered something for everyone, from the serious to the tastefully silly, plainsong to popular.\n\nMUSIC Iain Matthews Co-founder of Fairport Convention and Plainsong and one of the most enduring and engaging songwriters and musicians whose work spans decades.\n\nThere are monuments and battlegrounds to see, mission buildings built by the Indians they served and colorfully decorated by Mexican artists, exuberantly ornamented churches built by European immigrants wanting to feel a touch of home, quiet cloister gardens that invite contemplation, and places where nuns still wear the traditional habit of their order and chant the Divine Office in heavenly Gregorian plainsong.\n\nDistinguished by their unique tone, breath-taking homogeneity, musical authenticity and a good dose of charm and humour, the Amarcord has exceled in a vast and highly diverse repertoire of music, from mediaeval plainsong to madrigals and Renaissance masses, to compositions and cycles of works of the European Romantic period and the 20th century.\n\nMost commonly, however, his name is affixed to plainsong as he was the one who recodified the liturgy and reorganized the schola cantorum, a definite group of singers and teachers dedicated to the training of boys and men as church musicians.\n\nHis last book, Our Souls at Night (Vintage, $15, 192 pages, ISBN 9781101911921), is set in familiar territory: Holt, Colorado, the small town that has provided the backdrop for his previous books, including Plainsong (1999)."
