        "text": "Description\n\nThis was originally released on vinyl in 1980 produced by pedal steel guitar Maestro BJ Cole. With fifteen self penned tracks and a wild prairie version of Chip Taylor's Wild Thing it includes Wangford classics like the title track Cowboys Stay On Longer, Big G, Jogging with Jesus, Chico and Whiskey On My Guitar. Hank's band of the time is Andy Roberts (Liverpool Scene), Melanie Harrold (Joanna Carlin), Gary Taylor (The Herd), Howard Tibble Shakin'Stevens) and of course BJ Cole on pedal steel.\n\nA roll call of guests is like a Who's Who of 1980s Alt Country Rock with Albert Lee, Andy Fairweather Lowe, Pete Wingfield, \"Rabbit\" Bundrick, Dave Mattacks, Liam Genocky, Geraint Watkins, Ritchie Bull, Graham Preskett, Howie Casey and Tristan Fry. Charlie Dore, Julian Littman and Susan Landis on backing vocals. The arty cover is by David Oxtoby."
