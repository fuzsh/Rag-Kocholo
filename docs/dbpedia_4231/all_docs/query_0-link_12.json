        "text": "Hi Friends\n\nAs the fabulous Bridport Hat Festival beckons Hank spends a whole hour getting fully charged up in the hyper magnetic 2001 Space Odyssey electro tube. Whirr whirr bang clang bang clunk clonk bash bosh - it was great and so exciting Hank asked if he could have another go. He swore Laurie Anderson was in there with him whispering Oh! Superman into his ear. But they said he'd just get TOO charged up he'd be glowing. Come on the 7th September to the Electric Palace in Bridport to see the results and hear Hank's songs old and new from the new album with the whole Lost Cowboys. Big Martin Belmont, Space Guru BJ Cole, the Ultimate Country Fusion rhythm section Roy Dodds & Lord Kevin Foster and celestial singer and harmoniste Spanner Robinson will all be with Hank.\n\nThe socks were white when Hank went into the Big Machine - ah the power of the Magnets! Apparently this Cyclotron for the masses shifts all your hydrogen atoms sideways then measures how long it takes for them to recover... Clearly the hydrogen atoms in Hanks socks never reverted to their original whiteness... (Click to see Hank's socks in greater detail!!)\n\nHi Friends\n\nSelf self self! Hank has been so self obsessed in the last two months he’s missed on letting you know what’s new. Understandable, since just getting his cardiac reboot six weeks ago, getting more involved with the new album recording and then running away to Rancho Wangford to better enjoy the fiercest winds that Storm Gareth has to offer. And for winds â howling down the chimneys of the Rancho, blasting in off the wild Atlantic by the gate and screaming through the overhead wires â there’s nowhere to beat the Connemara coast. But back to you folks â pulling through assorted sicknesses that struck down the Wangford Bass Combo we had a glorious gig at Bungay’s Fisher Theatre when BJ Cole stepped in for the ailing Lord Kevin Foster and we harangued a warm partisan crowd with a bunch of fresh songs from the new album along with a smattering of oldies. Hank will come back from the Wild West this week to be ready for the Bass Combo’s return to the wonderful Green Note in Parkway, the hub of Camden in London. Come and hear Hank performing better than ever. The Cardiac Reboot looks to have done the trick and Hank â the Frankenstein of Alt Country â has risen from the moribund with his charge to the heart. The Reboot might even inspire the title of the new albumâ¦ We’ll see.\n\nTHREE STANDOUT GIGS COMING UP...\n\nCrawling out of the Great Darkness, two in London one in East Anglia’s Waveney Valley. We start with the Wangford Bass Combo pouring Country scorn on the cloying sweetness of Valentine’s Day. So successful last year the Half Moon have demanded a return to the cutting edge of revenge.\n\nMeantime we went in to Hackney Road Studios and laid down a huge number of tracks for the new album which was waiting for the extra batch of songs from Rancho Wangford. So far the tracks are sounding sweet and now we have some work to do. We'll keep you posted. Not giving away a lot here but best that way at the beginning...\n\nHANK & SPANNERS TRIP TO FOOTSBARN / GLEN HANSARD FESTIVAL\n\nWe've added some footage of Hank and Spanner's performnce at at the Ballintubbert for the Footsbarn / Glen Hansard festival in Ireland last September.Â See it HERE on Hank's YouTube page. ( SEPT 2018 )\n\nHANK’S FESTIVE FIBRILLATING DECEMBER NEWS\n\nNow Hank is sparked up after his Full Moon birthday (born during the London Blitz of the Second World War on the Blood Moon â or Hunter Moon â from his Communist mother in a Nazi Stately Home) he is back for his Xmas presentations in Brighton and London.\n\nFirst he joins Brad for Yule Yodels in Brighton then back home for some London dates. He takes his Bass Combo to the wonderful Green Note in Southern North London’s Camden and to the deep North of Crouch End to the excellent King’s Head. In between he slips over Putney Bridge into the South London Badlands at the semi-historic Half Moon.\n\nNext month Hank goes back into the studio to lay down the tracks for his new album. Then he is back to Hammersmith Hospital at the end of January for another heart operation â another ablation â to ready him for the rest of the recording and the rest of 2019.\n\nWe urge y’all to come and enjoy Hank, his new songs and old, in the full flush of his Atrial Fibrillation and wildly irregular heartbeat. Who knows â he might get boring with his new predictably post-op regular heartbeat.\n\nAnd who could resist a Fibrillating Country Singer?\n\nMerry Xmas!! ( 2019 )\n\nCerys Mathews on BBC 6Music\n\nHank will be Cerys’ guest sometime between 10.30 and 12 noon on Sunday 29th.\n\nSome years ago Hank presented a series of radio programmes on Radio 2 on Yodelling around the world called “Looking For The Lonesome Yodel”. Cerys wants to talk yodels with Hank as she shares his love of the universal yelp that transcends almost everything â time, space, souls, life and death.\n\nTune in and hear yodels from Kalahari Bushmen to Mongolian long song. ( APRIL 2019 )\n\nBoeing Duveen - aka - Hank Wangford\n\nThe single Jabberwock is one of RECORD COLLECTOR'S Top One Hundred psychedelic recordings of all time. Jabberwock andÂ Which Dreamed It, written by Sam Hutt & Lewis Carroll, was released in 1968 by Parlophone Records. Both are featured in a new Cherry Red CD compilation of Psychedelia. Looking At The Pictures In The Sky â The British Psychedelic Sounds of 1968: will be released on 10 November. ( 2019 )\n\nHank's \"Bad Boys\"\n\nHere's a 3D image of Hank's heart with the burn out ablation spots marked in pink. These are the points where, with another electrode passed up from Hank's groin, they established the rogue points which were firing off electrical impulses which were confusing Hank's heart. This âhad âsent him into the fast irregular rhythms called atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Another groin catheter snakes up into Hank's heart, punches its way from right to left through the middle wall and gets to work zapping the bad boysâ around the root of Hank's pulmonary veinâ. So the pink spots are the burned out bad boys.... It may be modern techno but Hank thinks it's magic.\n\nBoeing Duveen - aka - Hank Wangford\n\nWritten by Sam Hutt & Lewis Carroll, this 45 was released in 1968 by Parlophone Records. JabberwockÂ andÂ Which Dreamed It. The single is one of RECORD COLLECTOR'S Top One Hundred psychedelic recordings of all time. They may well both be featured (certainlyÂ JabberwockÂ will be) in a new Cherry Red CD compilation of Psychedelia. More info when we have it....\n\nHanks relives a ride in the famous Southern Maid\n\nHank was guest of honour at the legendary Romney Hythe & Dymchurch Miniature Railway, which he last visited as a child. As a special guest he was allowed to 'sit' in the famous locomotive 'The Southern Maid' and enjoy a wonderful trip in the Royal Carriage on the Southern Maid - a treat indeed for the 'foreveryoung' Hank.\n\nHanks Ticker ...\n\nFinally got Ablated last week.\n\nThe cardiac surgeon had a new mapping kit to plot out all the electrical points, good and bad, of my old heart. Very flash and two Cardiologists from Denmark were guests. Once the rogue areas that had been pumping out the wrong rhythms were identified they were burnt out. Mapped and zapped. By special request they didn't destroy the Love Centre or the Misery Centre so I'll be back singing from the dark underbelly of Country Music by mid-March Lungs recovering after over three hours under the anaesthetic and groins healing from the catheter attack. All good at last in Rancho Wangford.\n\nRegular rhythm - what we call Sinus Rhythm - Rocks!\n\nAs does the wonderful NHS in spite of all the attacks by our terrible government. Here we are post op - note the NHS Salmon & Cucumber Recovery Sandwich.\n\nLub dup lub dup lub dup!\n\nHi Folks and Hallo 2016!\n\nHope the turn of the year treated you well. Though we lost Lemmy before the New Year and Bowie just after I guess we should be grateful we’ve still got Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard in spite of all.\n\nWhat better way of navigating the dark underbelly of Country than with the thump and thud of twin bass guitars drilling their way through sad songs of lost love, breakups and betrayal, the malignant glue of relationships and the sticky end of the divorce court. Singing songs from the Dark Side of life is so much better down in the shadowy sonic world below 150 Hertz. Hank Wangford, the grizzled Godfather of British alt. Country, is joined by two bass players: Â Â Kevin KillaHertz Foster, the Jaco Pastorius of Country music and ex-Doll by Doll is the bass player of the Lost Cowboys. Spanner Subwoofa Robinson the new Chanteuse with the Cowboys and ex-bassiste of The Hallelujah Trails brings her heaven sent harmonies to Hank’s songs.Â Together the three explore Country from the bottom up, back to bass basics.Â The bass line in any song is mostly felt then forgotten and the Bass Combo seeks to home in on this unsung carrier of sad songs.Â The Bass Combo is joined by special guest Brad Bassbin Breath aka Andy Roberts from the Wangford 4.\n\nWhen misery’s that deep, for a Boombastic Country experience it must be the Wangford Bass Combo.\n\nHANKS NATIONWIDE APPEAL...\n\nFor your Christmas delectation, we have unearthed an archive video from the BBC's Natiowide programme from 1981. The video shows Hank in his daily life and at an early gig at The Pegasus in Stoke Newington, London. Have a great Christmas....\n\nHANKS NEWS\n\nAs we hurtle towards the turn of the year there are two events I need to tell you about. Well three actually. Hank & Brad are slipping over to Walthamstow then Hank is doing a turn with Spanner Robinson the night after in King’s Cross for a Margaret Pyke Clinic benefit. Then the traditional appearance of the Lost Cowboys for a Xmas Sunday lunchtime at the historic Half Moon in Putney. Then â the doctors’ strike permitting â Hank goes into hospital to have a rogue area of his old heart burnt out in an operation called semi-religiously an Ablation. Fans â and the lovely Mrs Wangford - should not worry. Hank will be asking the surgeon not to burn out his Love Centreâ¦\n\nHave a great Christmas and more importantly a happy, easy, friendly, prosperous and healthy New Year.\n\nCONTRACEPTION & SEXUAL HEALTHCARE\n\nSome of you may know - When Hank is not playing and promoting Country music I work as a doctor in Sexual Healthcare and Contraception.\n\nI joined the Margaret Pyke Centre, then the flagship of the Family Planning Association and an international icon of women’s sexual healthcare, to be involved in the sexual and contraceptive revolution of the early seventies. The male dominated medical profession of the time was patronising and seemingly unaware of the needs of women and their wish to have control over their health and their fertility.

Once we get the vinyl 12 inchers it’ll be even more handsome. We are planning to officially release them on the week of Mother’s Day at the end of March. Watch this and other spaces for a major tour in May to see if Britain is Ready To Waltz!?\n\nA Shrine to Hank\n\nHere's the Hank Wangford Admirers York Chapter's Xmas tribute to Hank, marking the time he would have come up to the Shed but which is no longer happening. In their collective pain and misery they gathered, erected a shrine, cooked a pie and made themselves feel better...\n\nThe Wangford Quiz of the Week\n\nCast your eyes over this tv quiz show screen-grab, brought to our attention by an avid fan, and see if you can answer the question!\n\nNow who can that person be?\n\nClick the image to 'enbiggun'\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury goes 'Jogging With Jesus'\n\nOur attention was recently drawn to an article in The Times newspaper about the Archbishop, Justin Welby, who goes Jogging each day and could possibly be a fan of Hank's suitably entitled piece - 'Jogging with Jesus'. Click HERE to see the article.\n\nFriends old & new\n\nHank is still recovering from George Jones' death so it's The Colonel here to tell you of a couple of imminent appearances of my boy. He's finished recording his Double Waltz album and I have to say it's sounding good. Warm, fat and old-fashioned.\n\nThere are a couple of tracks for you to listen to on the website to make your own minds up. Hank is now struggling with record company stuff - registering with PRS and MCPS and getting ISRC codes from PPL for all of the twenty five tracks.\n\nHe's a bit down about it all and keeps complaining to me that he didn't sign up for all this. \"I mean, acronyms are all very well but this is having a larf!\" he moans.\n\nJust wants to write and make music, poor fool. I keep reminding him that it's a music Business. And how am I to get my 50% if he doesn't get it right?\n\nLater this week Hank is joined by Brad and Spanner for another visit to the Green Note then next week is back to the Half Moon with the complete Lost Cowboys.\n\nAnd now we're deep in the heart of Hat Season Hank will take Lost Cowboys old and new and a truckload of hats down to Bridport in Dorset to open the Fourth Bridport Hat Festival before Hank runs off to stick his head in some Irish sand out on the West at Rancho Wangford.\n\nMusic from the new CD\n\nTwo tracks from Hank's upcoming CD 'SAVE ME THE WALTZ' are now on the site and free for you guys 'n' girls to listen to... 'Sunk Without Trace' by Hank and 'I Love You So Much It Hurts' by Floyd Tillman. You can find them on the little ol' radio on Hank's Media page HERE.\n\nHank Newsletter\n\nBeen a while since the last Wangletter.Â Blessed relief perhaps but just meant that Hank had an extended time off the road and concentrated on recording the new album. And they’ve done it! Finished mixing the sessions at the end of May. Now they need to get the cover designed and the tracks mastered, a process where a “Master” polishes them up to a wondrous audionic shine. So Save Me The Waltz, Hank’s album of Waltzes, is born but needs a little incubation. They recorded in Rock of London a fine analogue studio in Hackney and have achieved a warm fat sound with some real old-style waltzes.Â There are some special extras with contributions from special guests like Billy Bragg and others. But the real stars are Hank and the Lost Cowboys themselves who were in tremendous form. In fact there are so many waltzes in Country music that it has to be a Double Waltz album. We may put a couple of tracks up on the website as teasers for you. Expect a release in the Autumn. And remember the Waltz is the waymark on the borderline between Rock ‘n Roll and Country. Not a lot of waltzes in Rock but Country is littered with them. And the saddest most miserable songs are often waltzes so you can imagine Hank’s joy playing them.\n\nHank News\n\nNow we have the sad news of George Jones' death. Here's my obituary for George in the Guardian (CLICK HERE). Meantime I've taken time off the road to dive into recording the new Waltz album Save Me The Waltz (The Wild Wonderful Wayward & Wicked World of Waltzing With Wangford). We're laying it down in Rock of London, a fine and funky studio in the Hackney Road crammed with classic analogue machines for that warm authentic Country sound we in the Lost Cowboys love.\n\nWe've recorded sixteen new tracks, four originals and twelve covers of favourite Country waltzes that have followed me through my life. The album's true heroes are the Lost Cowboys and it is peppered with special guests I'll let you know about closer to the time. The time? If all goes well I expect to release this Waltzerama in the autumn.\n\nHank & Brad at The BRIGHTON FESTIVAL\n\nHank Wangford and Brad Breath will play the 600 seat Speigeltent at this year's Brighton Festival. The duo play Saturday 11th and Sunday 12th May and will have BJ Cole and Jeff Rulf accompanying.\n\nAndy Roberts joins the Lost Cowboys\n\nAndy Roberts will be sitting in with Hank Wangford's band, The Lost Cowboys, for the next few gigs. You can see the full gig list to your left, and they include Hank's famous traditional gigs at The Shed, in Hovingham, on the 7th & 8th December. Andy will be re-united with BJ Cole, pedal steel guitar player (and a regular in Hanks band), who played on a few of Mr Roberts early albums, so these gigs should not be missed! Sparks could fly...\n\nNew Girl Singer!\n\nHank welcomes Spanner Robinson, a new voice in the Lost Cowboys. He first saw her in the duo she has with Jeremy Mendonca, Hallelujah Trails and was knocked out by her harmonies. He hopes to feature her harmonies on the projected Waltz album. She will certainly join the Lost Cowboys at selected venues. Watch the listings.\n\nWebsite Updated!\n\nYou may have noticed that we've recently tweaked Hank Wangford's website. It now includes a slightly modified menu and an all new and singin' GALLERY which includes lots of new photos of Hank. Take a peek HERE.\n\nOlympic Flame Snubs Wangford!\n\nThe Olympic flame is currently on its way round Britain. Hank is mortified, as I’m sure you will be too, by the news that it is travelling round Suffolk, through quaint Southwold, on to Reydon an unremarkable village but â shock horror! â bypassing Wangford, Hank’s spiritual home. Wangford is a sleepy place and is already bypassed by the A12, the classic Fish Finger run from Lowestoft to London, but this Olympic cold shoulder is one rebuff too many. This is an outrage and if you feel as lacerated by the iniquity of this appalling decision please make your feelings known to your local Olympics committee or write to your MP. Better still go to Southwold at 11.34 on Thursday 5th July to protest at this heartless affront to the great man and his native heath. So here (left) Hank conducts his own personal protest taking The Flame into the crater of the great volcano Haleakala, the House of the Sun, on his recent trip to Maui.\n\nBefore Hank became a full card carrying Hippie, the drugs kicked in and his fashion values disappeared up his William Morris print flares, he was a Mod.\n\nLiving in Soho in the '60s, married to his agent, Hank was a Mod-suited Satirist when not a medical student. He regularly bought Mod suits from Dougie Millings the Beatles tailor. High collar, four button, waisted. He loved his Ivy League gold and black broad striped jacket he got in Sportique on a very early Carnaby Street. He played the West End in Beyond The Fringe in a Mod suit. He wore a Mod suit down at the All Nighter in The Flamingo listening to RnB from Chris Farlowe, Georgie Fame, Zoot Money, Herbie Goins, John Mayall and even the great Solomon Burke in a defiantly non-Mod salmon pink Lurex suit with emerald Lurex lapels (see Hank's piece on \"Negramiculaphilia\", the love of Black Men wearing Capes). Even morphing from Mod to Hippie left No Room for Country in Hank's world.\n\nNow Hank has reverted big time in a spectacular Late Life Crisis to his beloved Mod roots. Wangford fans have been heard muttering \"Where's the Cowboy boots? The Western shirt and jacket? Where's the Stetson, Hank??\"\n\nAll since he discovered Adam of London right on his doorstep near Rancho Wangford on the Portobello Road.\n\nThe sign in the window spat\n\n\"DO YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE S**T?\n\nOR THE DOG'S BOLLOCKS??\"\n\nand Hank was hooked.\n\nAdam do fine '60s cut figure fitting suits, coats and shirts. Shiny Two-Tone Tonik mohair! Tab collar and pin-through collars! It's a Mod dream. Or a Madmen dream.\n\nHank says go and do yourselves a favour - this place is unique. Click for LINK TO ADAMS WEBSITE\n\nNegramiculaphiliac\n\n\"I have been a lifelong Negramiculaphiliac - an admirer of black men wearing capes. \"Read Hank's piece which harks back to when he first saw the inspirational Gene Chandler as the Duke of Earl. HERE\n\nHank and his Hawaiian travels...\n\n\"Peel away the sun, surf, hula and flower garlands in Hawaii, and you find cowboys â and Spam â embedded in the lifestyle.\" We've added Hank's recent article to the website. READ ABOUT HANK'S HAWAIIAN TRAVELS HERE\n\nMy heart attacks me out of the blue...!\n\nHank had a mild coronary recently - Don't worry he's doing well - and we've included a blow by blow account of his Johnny Cash Lite event. HERE\n\nHank has written about his trip this year to Maui, Hawaii to find the Paniolo, the Hawaiian Cowboys. Certain that no one in the UK has ever heard of the Hawaiian cowboys, Hank has been waiting years to go over and ride with them and hear their special brand of music. He's written about them and an article will apear in the Guardian Travel section on Saturday July 23rd and simultaneously in Guardian Online (the largest online newspaper in the world after the New York Times). That same day, July 23rd, Hank will appear on BBC Radio 4's Excess Baggage at 10 am.\n\nIf you miss it then you can catch up with BBC iPlayer or download it as a podcast. Later we will post the article and other Hawaiian thoughts from Hank here on Hank's Trails.\n\nKylie Ramone (!) seems to be working overtime and sticking footage on to YouTube as fast as she can get hold of them.

As a compulsive hat wearer and newly honoured Patron of the Bridport Hat Festival, Hank is pleased and proud. He is happy, too, to see that at last more British citizens are becoming hat-aware again. Here he is wearing a black straw Rancher cowboy classic from Western Express of Bridgeville PA. He bought the hatband in Conway Texas, inspiration to Harold Jenkins for his new stage name Conway Twitty which makes Hank Wangford seem normal by comparison. The band was made by local Comanche Indians using Indian conchos and ersatz bone. Check out The Hat Magazine and Mr Snook in Links.\n\nThis November Hank will turn 70 before his time so the rest of the world can feel twenty years younger.Â He will celebrate his 70th birthday weekend with two very special gigs.Â In West London on Sunday 14th November he will be at the Half Moon Putney for his Birthday Prequel and on Monday 15th November Hank will celebrate his Actual Birthday in his homeland North London at the O2 Academy in Islington.Â On both nights he will have a clutch of special guests joining the Lost Cowboys to help him through the pain of three score and ten.Â The legendary Brad Breath â Andy Roberts â will be yodelling into your hearts and offering you a Glimpse of Gloom on both nights.Â Despite the party atmosphere and whatever guests turn up Hank pledges as always to keep the proceedings miserable.Â And Keep It Country!Â\n\nHank & Brad's No Hall 2 Small tour of Dorset, Shropshire & Herefordshire was a great success, with packed out and enthusiastic audiences.
