        "text": "RemarkableEmphasis has closed down.\n\nThank you to all our past clients, the friends we have made and the adventures we've had.\n\nIt has been a wonderful 20years.... But it's time to go.\n\nWilly Russell\n\nWilly Russell is well known as the writer of plays and films such as Educating Rita, Shirley Valentine, Our Day Out, and the musical Blood Brothers. His work has attracted huge and appreciative audiences all over the world and his plays and musicals have won countless awards.Â His first novel, The Wrong Boy, published in 2000, has been translated into fifteen languages.\n\nAlistair Beaton\n\nAlistair Beaton's work spans theatre, television, radio and publishing. He was born in Glasgow. He is regarded as one of Britain’s top political satirists. His satirical comedy King of Hearts was seen at London’s Hampstead Theatre in 2007. He is the author of the hit West End play Feelgood, which won the Evening Standard Best Comedy Award. He was one of the founding members of Not the Nine O’Clock News and regularly wrote song lyrics for Spitting Image.\n\nAdrian Henri\n\nAdrian Henri (1932 â 2000) was a British poet and painter best remembered as the founder of poetry-rock group The Liverpool Scene and as one of three poets in the best-selling anthology The Mersey Sound, along with Brian Patten and Roger McGough. In 1972 he won a major prize for his painting in the John Moores competition. He was president of the Merseyside Arts Association and Liverpool Academy of the Arts in the 1970s and was an honorary professor of the city's John Moores University. The website was commissioned by Adrian's partner, Catherine Marcangeli.\n\nHank Wangford\n\nHank is well known for fronting the Lost Cowboys, one of the country's leading Country & Western groups, but he also performs in duo form with Brad Breath (aka Andy Roberts), writes travelogues for the Guardian newspaper, and is President of the Nude Mountianeering Society! If that wasn't enough, he is also a Reverend and was the original Rock 'n' Roll Doctor...\n\nFrith Trezevant\n\nFrith Trezevant is a Singing Teacher and Vocal Coach based in the South West. She is on the teaching teams at Cardiff University and with the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain, and is a Guest Artist in Residence with the SPARK and IGNITE choirs. Frith occasionally performs, and extracts from her recitals can be listened to on her website.\n\nI have been extremely pleased with the work that Paul has put into creating my website. He has been so easy to work with and has provided me with a vital tool with which to promote my work.\n\nI would recommend him to anyone needing this service! ANGELA HALLAM\n\nAndy Roberts\n\nAndy Roberts was a founder member of The Liverpool Scene and Plainsong, and has played alongside The Scaffold, Roy Harper, Pink Floyd, Hank Wangford, Kevin Ayers, Vivian Stanshall and the Bonzos. He has also done countless sessions for artists such as Richard Thompson, Paul Korda, and Maddy Prior, and has been a musical partner to Iain Matthews for over 40 years. He has also written film scores, themes for TV series and stage plays, provided music and voice for Spitting Image and continues to create musical backdrops for the poetry of Roger McGough.\n\nBrian Patten\n\nBrian Patten came to prominence when Roger McGough and Adrian Henri joined Patten in a best-selling poetry anthology The Mersey Sound, drawing popular attention to his own contemporary collections Little Johnny's Confession (1967) and Notes to the Hurrying Man (1969). Armada is perhaps Patten's most mature and formal book, dispensing with much of the playfulness of former work. He has also written comic verse for children, notably Gargling With Jelly and Thawing Frozen Frogs.\n\n“My old site limped about in limbo for a year and needed something more than a spring-clean. If you want something fresh from someone who’ll listen to what you want and offer suggestions rather than try to impose their own ideas, Paul’s your man” BRIAN PATTEN\n\nKevin McFadden & Misdemeanor\n\nMisdemeanor hailed from Bristol and were one of the most popular live acts on national circuit in the 1980s. Their music features the powerful rock and well crafted lyrics that earned the band such an enthusiastic following. Most songs, written by singer Kevin McFadden, are based on his first hand experiences of life in Northern Ireland. Kevin now lives in the USA with his family and continues to create music and has several projects on the go, including the powerful tracks featured on his website, American Dream and Indian Times. \" The band were massive in the 80's and I still can't believe a major never snapped them up. \"\n\nRichard Gordon-Smith\n\nRichard Gordon-Smith is a Composer, Music Educator and violinist. Previously a member of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, he now commits himself full-time to educational and community activities in schools and elsewhere, and to serious composition. Richard has a substantial list of compositions to his credit, and has had work recorded and played in many parts of the world. He is especially adept at developing music with young people that can then be used to produce scores for professional performance.\n\nI don't know where to begin to tell you how delighted I am with the website you created for me - it has far exceeded my best expectations. I am so grateful for your creativity, your experience and your wise advice. I think what I have been most appreciative of however, is your patience with me; the number of times I changed my mind about content, layout and style would have had most web designers tearing their hair out - but you just calmly made the changes while still keeping your charges to a reasonable level. I am full of admiration for the sheer professionalism that produced this result and I might add, the positive comments I have had from friends, colleagues and strangers logging on the site reinforce my own opinion that you are the best in the business! RICHARD GORDON-SMITH\n\nBHK Media\n\nBHK was formed by Gary Barlow, (Take That), Eliot Kennedy (songwriter/producer) and Robert Howes (TV producer). BHK commissioned Remarkable Emphasis to create a website attractive to young musicians/singers to form, what became, a successful pop group.\n\nThe design was completed to a very tight timescale and incorporated constant changes and imagery from song-writing sessions at Peter Gabriel’s Real World Studios near Bath."
