        "text": "CHRISTMAS at The Shed means one thing only: the return of country doctor Hank Wangford with his Lost Cowboys in tow and a coach load of fans from York, 48 on board this year, for Saturday'’s gig, the second of two starry, starry Ryedale nights.\n\nYou may promote festive misery in your Christmas shows, Hank, but what is your idea of a perfect Christmas?\n\n“I do love presents and I love giving them and I’m not going to hold back on that.\n\n“This year I’m going to California on Christmas Eve to see my son Mat and his family – he’s a carpenter and builder, like Jesus, and he was born on Christmas Day!\n\n“In fact I delivered him, when I hadn’t quite qualified but was about to qualify when I was ‘heavying’ on gynaecology. I called a nice Jewish consultant, as my wife arrived at St George’s Hospital, and he said OK to me doing the delivery!”\n\nBack to your perfect Christmas, Hank…\n\n“Talking completely selfishly, I’m going to miss the perfect Christmas this year as I’ll be without the perfect Mrs Wangford, which is my idea of the perfect Christmas in Norwich, opening Christmas presents with her in bed, a tradition that comes from my childhood. She’ll be with her family for Christmas; I’ll be in America.”\n\nWhat do you remember of those childhood Christmases?\n\n“My mum, who was the daughter of a boiler maker in Glasgow, would put all my presents in a stocking and I could open them at three in the morning if I wanted to?”\n\nWhat is your favourite Christmas song of all time?\n\n”I’ll tell you my favourite Christmas album of all time: Ray Charles. It’s available on Amazon at about £5 and I’ve bought a couple of copies to send as Christmas presents.\n\n“It’s called The Spirit Of Christmas with a cover picture of Ray in dinner jacket and bow tie, standing in a horse-drawn sleigh in the snow! It’s a fantastic album, especially Little Drummer Boy, where he puts all this feeling and soul into it.”\n\nAnd your least favourite Christmas record?\n\n“Most of them really. You hear sleigh bells as you’re going into a shop and you think, ‘Here we go again’.”\n\nHow will this weekend’s shows differ from past years?\n\n“Lord Shed [alias The Shed promoter Simon Thackray] is always concerned that the punters should get what they want, especially after I did a new set four years ago and halfway through they were saying they wanted the usual show with the old jokes!\n\n“There’ll be a couple of newies but I’ll keep the core the same, though the big difference this year is that big Martin Belmont is missing. He’s in America for a month, playing with the biggest band he was in, Graham Parker & The Rumour, who’ve reformed for the new Judd Apatow movie.\n\n“We needed someone to replace him and the obvious person was Andy Roberts, aka Brad Breath from the village hall shows we do together. He does a great version of A Rootin’ Tootin’ Santa Claus.”"
