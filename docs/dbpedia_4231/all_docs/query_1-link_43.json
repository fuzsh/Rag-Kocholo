Well, after going through eight or nine boxes, I'd picked a small group of LPs and 45s. My brother-in-law was standing next to me. I thought this jacket was kind of cool (it is--surprisingly so for a cheapo label), so I held it up and said, \"Do I want this?\" \"Yes, you want this,\" he replied. So I bought it.\n\nThe label is Hollywood, and here Hollywood is pulling the standard budget-label read-the-smaller-print scam: a big (colorized?) picture of the famous artists being exploited, the artists' name in big letters (\"Dorsey\"), and no Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey present on the disc. Surprise!! Just Maury Laws' Orchestra and Chorus, which does a surprisingly decent job recreating the Tommy Dorsey sound (7 to 8 on a scale of 10). (I don't think any of these were originally Jimmy Dorsey sides, but correct me if I'm wrong.) Surprisingly decent, because the budget couldn't have been very sky-high. In all, a fun LP with a few outstanding performances. My only complaint: some truncated arrangements, including my two all-time favorite TD tracks: Marie and Sunny Side of the Street. How could they? But there's an excellent Opus No. 1, so maybe I can forgive this lapse in $1.98-LP wisdom. This junk-label album far exceeded my low expectations, so I'll give it an A. Besides, the cover rocks.\n\nBiggest surprise: the very decent sound. I combined left and right for fabulous results. Not usually, but sometimes the poverty-row record companies get it right. Well, except for putting the jacket's track listings in the correct order, but that's a proud budget label tradition. These folks have standards to uphold.\n\nClick here to hear: The Dorsey Touch--Maury Laws' Chorus and Orch.\n\nGetting Sentimental Over You\n\nRoyal Garden Blues\n\nBoogie Woogie\n\nSong of India\n\nSwanee River\n\nMarie\n\nWill You Still Be Mine/Once in a While\n\nYes Indeed (Sy Oliver)\n\nSunny Side of the Street\n\nI'll Never Smile Again\n\nOpus No. 1 (Sy Oliver)\n\nThis Love of Mine/Embraceable You/There Are Such Things\n\nQuiet Please (Sy Oliver)\n\nGetting Sentimental Over You\n\nPrepared and Directed by Maury Laws (Hollywood LPH-136, 1957)\n\nLee\n\n↧\n\nLouis XIII; Charpentier (Nonesuch, 1967)\n\nWat hadden de labels Nonesuch en Turnabout (die ook regelmatig dezelfde opnamen uitbrachten) toch een geweldige repertoirekeuze.

Kort voor zijn 9e verjaardag werd hij koning, toen zijn vader, Henri IV (zie vorige post), vermoord werd. Zijn Italiaanse moeder, Marie de' Medici, werd regentes, maar de jonge koning nam in 1617 de macht over. Hij steunde erg op zijn eerste ministers, w.o. kardinaal Richelieu, stuurde zijn moeder in 1630 op ballingschap en executeerde haar volgelingen.\n\nHij stierf aan darmtuberculose.\n\nIk wist niet dat deze koning muziek gecomponeerd had.\n\nMarc-Antoine Charpentier (Parijs, 1643 - Parijs, 24.02.1704): Frans componist.

Best known for the inclusion of their track Strangely Strange But Oddly Normal (from their first album ''Kip Of The Serenes') on the Island records sampler 'Nice EnoughTo Eat'.\n\nThey were usually compared to The Incredible String Band, which was fair comment, though DSS were often a lot more fun. They started off acoustically but by the time of their second album, 'Heavy Petting' they had embraced electric instruments on some tracks, even eventually adding a drummer.\n\nThe original plan for 'Halcyon Days' was to issue the tracks they recorded for the BBC, but this fell through. Adrian Whittaker, whose baby this project very much is, was amazed to find instead, that there were nearly enough unissued, and in some cases previously unknown, tracks to fill an album, with the band (who still exist when they feel like getting together) adding three new songs recorded last year in their original style.\n\nAnd this is what we have here. The delightful Going To Phoulapouca is highly representitive of their early sound, as is HMS Avenger, the tale of a 19th Century shipwreck narrated with humour and weirdness.\n\nTheir later, rockier, sound shows up in Sweet Red Rape and Horse Of A Different Hue, then latter featuring a Santana-style intro inspired by the time DSS supported them (!). The three new songs fit perfectly too, especialy The Invisible Kid, with it's clever lyrics. Adrian's sleevenotes give a full history of the band, and a guide to the many strange characters who populate their songs.\n\nAnyone who liked them first time round will love this album, and hopefully a whole new generation of fans will discover it and work backwards.\n\nby Grahame Hood\n\nTracks\n\n1.

At the age of five he trouped with his parents. His father, who was of Irish descent, presented him with a small Irish harp on his eighth birthday. His début as soloist was with the Philadelphia Orchestra, under the direction of Leopold Stokowski. As a result of winning a scholarship, he became one of the most brilliant pupils of the illustrious Carlos Salzedo at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. Graduating in 1926, he became first harpist of the Cincinnati Symphony under Fritz Reiner for five years, and head of the Harp Department at the Cincinnati Conservatory.\n\nNewspaperman Edwin H. Schloss wrote (July 19, 1939), 'In Cincinnati, some of Reardon's Southern pupils interested him in jazz and he fell in love with the music of W.C. Handy. He found the percussive harp to be as well suited to Gershwin as to Debussy and the rest is history, mostly made via radio.'\n\nOn his own, Reardon devised a technique of playing 'jazz.' The precedent for jazz music on the harp had not been explored to a significant degree. It wasn't unusual for a dance orchestra to utilize the harp for texture. (The dance orchestras of Leonard Joy, Richard Himber, Victor Young and Raymond Paige used harp regularly.) Reardon thought the harp had more potential than the usual flourishes and interludes that were expected of him. When he became a regular feature on the powerful Cincinnati station WLW, he used the nom de radio \"Arpeggio Glissando,\" so as to not shock his classical harp students.\n\nReardon’s initial records were as a pianist accompanying tap dancers. He moved to New York City in 1931 and immediately created a niche for himself and his harp. On September 18, 1934, he recorded an unprecedented long harp solo on the Jack Teagarden recording of \"Junk Man\" for Brunswick Records. Although his name does not appear on the record, determined music lovers soon found out who the swing harpist was. By 1936 he recorded some dance records as Casper Reardon & His Orchestra, for Liberty Music Shop. He became known as the \"Swing Harpist.\"\n\nHe was immortalized as \"Cousin Caspar\" in Alice Faye's film You're a Sweetheart (1937). He was a regular on radio shows such as 'Saturday Night Swing Club' with the orchestra of Bunny Berigan, and was often featured by Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra. George Gershwin featured Reardon on his popular Feenamint broadcast in 1934.\n\nCasper Reardon met Dana Suesse in nineteen thirty-nine, through their friend, Gus Schirmer. Suesse told this writer, \"Casper told me about having an engagement with the Philadelphia Symphony and wanted me to write something for him. At the time, Young Man with A Horn was a bestselling novel.\" It seemed logical to create a concert piece called Young Man with A Harp. Alexander Smallens, who would always be remembered as the original conductor of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, conducted the concert at the Robin Hood Dell in 1939\n\nDana and Casper repeated their Young Man With A Harp on February 25, 1940 with Guy Fraser Harrison conducting the Rochester Civic Orchestra. In 1940 Reardon performed with Suesse at a Cabinet Dinner for President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his family.\n\nOne evening in March 1941 Reardon was late for a date with composer Dana Suesse to attend the New York opening of Crazy With The Heat, a show in which he appeared in Boston. He complained about feeling lousy, and stopped for a quick brandy to settle his stomach.\n\nA few days later he was taken to the hospital for an exploratory operation and it was discovered that both kidneys were seriously damaged, a condition unusual for someone who seldom drank alcohol. Four or five days later he died on March 8, 1941. He was 33 years old. A funeral was held March 11. On December 19 a memorial program was broadcast on WQXR, featuring a composition composed by Suesse and orchestrated by Robert Russell Bennett. The work was titled \"Coronach, a Gaelic word for \"A crying together.\"\n\n(Edited from a bio @ IMDb and YouTube posts)\n\nRecorded on disk, this selection by Casper Reardon is a previously unreleased, segment from a Hollywood studio recording session. Two songs, Ain't Misbehavin' (Fats Waller, Harvey Brooks, Andy Razaf) and St. Louis Blues (W.C. Handy) are heard in the released print of this feature film, starring Alice Faye, George Murphy, Ken Murray, Andy Devine and Oswald (Tony Labriola). The first song, Junk Man (by Joseph Meyer and Frank Loesser) was cut from the released print, but the audio survives on this playback disk dated October 9, 1937. Stills have been inserted into this video clip where film footage does not survive. The film, directed by David Butler, was released December 26, 1937. The voice of the conductor, Charles Previn (the cousin of André Previns father) is heard counting off the selection.\n\n↧\n\nHomenaje Póstumo A Joseito Fernández\n\n1.

Guitarist/vocalist Robert Lawrence “Blackie” Crawford (b. 1923), an ex-Marine and WWII veteran, was the founder and leader of the group, which originally went by the Sons of Texas and, briefly, the Tune Toppers. Their pedigree as the backing band on a few Frizzell’s biggest early hits (most notably “Always Late,” which Blackie co-wrote) earned them their own recording contract with Coral Records in late 1951. They were ably managed by Jack and Neva Starns, veteran promoters and club owners in East Texas. By early 1953, they were based in Oklahoma City, but this would change when the Starnses purchased a large dance hall on the northern outskirts of Beaumont, Texas, a few months later.\n\nSteel guitarists are often a historian’s best friend, easily and vividly remembering details from decades past that remain a fuzzy, distant blur to their fellow bandmembers, and, happily, Bobby Black is no exception. Though his tenure with the Western Cherokees was brief (lasting less than a year, from spring to the fall of 1953), his insights are vital, giving us a clear snapshot of an otherwise murky and confusing time. Crucially, Bobby was in the band when the Cherokees were recruited by Jack and Neva to help launch the Starday label with two marathon sessions that probably occurred over two days at ACA Studios in Houston in the summer of 1953. ACA cut 78 rpm masters of the first four Starday singles on May 21, 1953.\n\nThe following is based on interviews with Bobby Black on June 9, 1996; August 21, 1997; and February 2, 2005. (AB)\n\nAndrew Brown: Bobby, you’re from California, correct?\n\nBobby Black: Yeah. I’m originally from Arizona, but I’ve lived in California most of my life.\n\nHow did you become involved with this band that was based in Oklahoma at that time?\n\nWell, I was playing what was the second gig of my career, at a place called Tracey Gardens in San Jose, California. I was 17 years old. Pee Wee Whitewing had been the house band’s steel player. All of the name artists, when they came through the area, would always appear there. So we got a chance to either back up these people or open for them — including Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Ernest Tubb, and Lefty Frizzell. The Western Cherokees were backing up Lefty on his tour. He was the number one guy at the time. Everybody was raving about him, and he was packing these places. So, they picked Pee Wee up (to tour with them), so I took Pee Wee’s place in the house band.\n\nWhen Pee Wee left the Cherokees, he recommended me. Why, I don’t know. (Laughter) There were a lot of pretty good steel players in Texas and Oklahoma. It was probably just because we were buddies. I had just started going to college at San Jose State. I was just about finished with my first semester when they called (in spring, 1953). I took the train to Oklahoma City – that’s where they were at first. We played at the Trianon Ballroom. Seems like we did that every other Saturday — we’d alternate with Hank Thompson. That was our headquarters for a while. Then we moved down to Beaumont.\n\nBobby Black playing Pee Wee Whitewing's steel guitar at Tracy Gardens, San Jose, California, c. 1951.\n\nI remember my first night with those guys was at the Trianon Ballroom. I was so nervous. I remember going down to the Trianon and setting up before I’d even met anybody. I’d arrived in town maybe a couple of hours before.\n\nI set up, and met the guys when they came in. I was, like I said, so nervous and scared. We started playing. I had a cup of Coke sitting on stage, and some guy (audience member) with a bottle of whiskey in a brown bag kept pouring whiskey in my Coke. I’d reach down and drink, and after a while I just got plastered. I don’t have any recollection of that night. I didn’t drink then and I don’t drink now, but I guess that I thought I was going to be cool since I was away from home, and with these guys...I’m going to really start living it up.\n\nThe next day, we went down to Ardmore, Oklahoma, to play some club. Of course, I was sober. Nobody said a dang thing to me the whole time. We played the first set, and Blackie and everybody gathered around me when we took a break...they shook my hand, patted me on the back. They were so happy that I’d played like I did. They said they were going to send me back home on the train, 'cause I’d played so bad the night before. (Laughter) Then I realized how stupid I must have been.\n\nWho else was in the band when you joined?\n\nBlackie (guitar), Pee Wee Wharton and Bob Heppler (fiddles), Burney Annett (piano), Bud Crawford (bass), and Jimmy Dennis (drums). We were based in Oklahoma City only a few months. It seemed to me like I was with the band six years, but I was probably with them only six or seven months. So much happened to me and the band during that time that it seems like a lot longer than that. But probably half of the time I was with them was spent in Oklahoma City, the other half in Beaumont. Neva’s Club in Beaumont was our headquarters, but we traveled around a lot.\n\nRobert \"Blackie\" Crawford (1951).\n\nWhat precipitated the move from Oklahoma City to Beaumont?\n\nIt’s funny, I didn’t pay that much attention to the politics of what was happening. All I cared about was just playing. The only thing I can think of is that the Starnses were friends with Blackie, and Neva’s was a new place, so they contacted Blackie to see if he wanted to play there — just make it our headquarters. 'Cause that’s what happened, of course.\n\nWhat was your impression of Jack and Neva Starns?\n\nI didn’t have much of a relationship with them. Jack...I don’t want to say he was a cut- throat businessman, but he was sort of a typical hustler type. A cigar-puffing guy. But I shouldn’t make any judgements, because I can’t say I knew him or Neva that well. Most of the time I was just hanging out with the guys in the band. We lived together for a while, the whole band. In Oklahoma City, anyway, we lived in one house. Blackie’s wife always cooked for us. It was kind of neat. A lot of fun — we had a lot of good times.\n\nI always liked Blackie. He was a character. He was a World War II veteran. He told me a story of climbing up a tree in some island in the Pacific and shooting a Jap sniper. The guy’s blood and everything got all over him...he freaked, and said he never got over the experience. And, every once in a while, he’d go into these terrible migraine headaches. They would lay him at...he’d be in agony. So he’d have these weird attacks.\n\nYes, apparently that was why he left the band later on.\n\nReally? I had no idea. When I left the band, it was a cheerful parting. We all got along real well. But I was homesick, and I decided to get married. I had broken up with my high school sweetheart when I left, so I felt like it was time to go back home, get married, settle down...but it was a great experience for me.\n\nThe Western Cherokees hanging out with members of the Bill Wimberley band at the Cowboy Inn in Wichita, Kansas, 1953. From left: Larry Black, Bobby Black, Jimmy Dennis, Cotton Whittington, fan, Blackie Crawford, fan, Gene Crownover. Click on picture to enlarge. (Bobby Black Collection)\n\nHow far away from Beaumont would you tour? There’s that one picture of you taken at the Cowboy Inn in Wichita, Kansas — would that be as far north as you’d tour?\n\nProbably. I remember playing in Texarkana. I remember playing the Big “D” Jamboree and the Louisiana Hayride. Those were the occasions when we’d wear those big war bonnets, headdresses. Fortunately we didn’t have to wear those all the time. Shreveport was as far east as I remember going. I guess it was mostly in Texas and Oklahoma that we toured...and Louisiana. We used Chrysler limousines with trailers to travel in. There were two of them. They were painted up with “The Western Cherokees” on the sides, and on the trailer, too. I remember seeing those back when they were backing up Frizzell in California.\n\nIt got kind of rough in those cars. I remember trying to sleep while somebody was driving. It was really uncomfortable.\n\nThat probably also contributed to your leaving the band, eh?\n\nYeah. I got tired of that kind of fast. (Laughter) 'Course, I was pretty young, so I could take it, but I could never do something like that now, that’s for sure.\n\nWe used to play in Houston at Magnolia Gardens. We backed up Tommy Sands there, among many others. I met Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys out there. I remember seeing a guy get shot right in front of me there while we were playing. He didn’t get killed. He was drunk, or raising hell, and the cops came right up in front of me and shot the guy. It was always so hot and humid there. I’d never encountered that until I left California.\n\nAnother place we played a lot in Houston was Cook’s Hoedown. I can still see the red and white checkered tablecloths they had on the tables there. It’s funny, I never met Herb Remington there. I saw him play once at Cook’s, but didn’t get to meet him.\n\nWe went out with Webb Pierce a lot. He was really hot at that time. So many guys like him didn’t have their own bands. They’d hire these, what were called “pick up” bands -- usually out of Texas or Oklahoma. 'Cause they were pretty good units who could play a lot of styles. In those days, swing was kind of still happening, so before and after the star got up and sang, the band would do all their swing stuff. And get away with it. (Laughter) So when Ray Price picked up the band, it evolved into the Cherokee Cowboys.\n\nAfter I had left the band and had been gone for a while, they did a tour with Ray Price out here in California. I think it was in Sacramento...I drove out to see them. It was the last time I saw Blackie and those guys.\n\nFrom left: Bobby Black, Bob Heppler, and Luther Nallie, 1953. (Bobby Black Collection.)\n\nAt live shows, did Blackie do most of the vocals, or did Bob Heppler share them with Blackie?\n\nHeppler of course did some, but Blackie did most of them as I recall. Heppler was a pretty good singer, but at the time I thought he sounded a little bit too “poppish.” (Laughter) It sounds fine to me now.\n\nDo you remember Rusty McDonald? I liked his singing, his writing...him personally. Few people have ever heard of the guy. I played a lot of gigs with him. In fact, I think I met Jimmy Day and Floyd Cramer during one of those Rusty McDonald gigs. At times, Blackie and the whole band would back him up. Rusty would hire the band to back him up for different things. And sometimes, he’d just pick up part of the band, without Blackie. And I did most of those gigs. I always liked working him. He had a sound and style that I really liked.\n\nYou mentioned Neva’s Club in Beaumont as being the band’s headquarters during mid-to-late 1953. Can you describe what it was like?\n\nNeva’s was like a miniature Longhorn Ballroom. Do you remember the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas? We played there a few times, as well. Neva’s had a nice, large hardwood dance oor...they had a little restaurant there, kind of a typical place like they had in those days. It was fun to play there.\n\nGeorge Jones was living in Beaumont then. I had met him before that, though, at the place I mentioned in San Jose. That was when he was still in the Marines. He was stationed out here at Moffett Air Field. He’d be in uniform...he’d come out and sing with us. Nobody knew who he was; he was just “George Jones, the Singing Marine.” He’d do Lefty Frizzell songs. So when I went with Blackie, I saw him and said, “Hey! You’re that guy...” There was always that kind of thing going on back in those days.\n\nDid George Jones appear with the band at this point?\n\nNo. He came up to the radio station that one time, just to watch us play, I guess.\n\nThe Western Cherokees, Polaroid snapshot taken at Neva's Club in Beaumont, 1953.

(Bobby Black Collection)\n\nIn that snapshot of the band playing at Neva’s, there’s a guy playing lead guitar that looks like Norman Stevens. I didn’t think he had worked with Blackie after 1951.\n\nThat’s probably who it was. Maybe he was just sitting in when that picture was taken. I don’t remember him being in the band when we were working.\n\nWere you on a salary? How did Blackie pay you?\n\nNo, we would get paid by the gig, as I recall. And it wasn’t much, as you can imagine. I think in those days we would get between ten and fifteen dollars a night per man to play. But I thought I was on top of the world, actually. I didn’t make any money, but I sure had a lot of fun.\n\nHow many records do you remember making with them?\n\nI was in the band when we did all of the very first Starday recordings, (for example) “Cherokee Steel Guitar.” One of the things that stands out, I did a thing with Patsy Elshire (“Someday I Know He Will”). I did sort of a Joaquin Murphey-type solo. Naturally, it was not as good as Joaquin. ‘Cause I was influenced by Joaquin a lot. That was one of the tunes I remember hearing on the radio after I came back out here. Eddie Kirk was a disc jockey, and he played it. And after it finished, he came on the microphone and said something to the effect of, “Hey folks, that steel break was so neat, I wish I knew who it was...I’m gonna play it for you one more time.” And he played the solo over again. And man, I was in hog heaven. I was soaring on cloud nine.\n\nPatsy Elshire - \"Someday I Know He Will\" (Starday 109) featuring Bobby Black on steel guitar.\n\nWhat about “You All Come” by Arlie Duff?\n\nThere’s a funny story behind “You All Come.” We were over at Jack Starns’ house when we worked up those songs. We had Arlie Duff come over, Patsy Elshire, and all those people. So we went over all the different songs we had. I think Blackie wrote a few of 'em. And, of course, Arlie Duff wrote “You All Come.” He was a schoolteacher in town. The flipside was “Poor Old Teacher.” Arlie was a likeable guy, kind of a clown. It was hard to believe he was a teacher. We didn’t look down on him, but he had the most insignificant songs that we were going over, I felt. I thought, “Man, why are we doing these tunes? They’re so corny.” We were always looking for something more swinging to play, so I felt like we had to lower ourselves to play these. I remember somebody, maybe Blackie, saying, “Aw, play really corny on this stuff,” so I did, of course.\n\nThat must have been a surprise when “You All Come” became a massive hit.\n\nOh, I couldn’t believe it. I remember when we recorded it, I thought it was the corniest thing. It was almost a joke to me. As it turned out, naturally, that was the thing that made the most noise.\n\nThose first Starday sessions were recorded in Houston. I thought they were done at ACA Studios, but Patsy Elshire insisted that she recorded her first single at Floyd Tillman’s studio, which was in his house. Does that sound plausible?\n\nIt wasn’t a home. It was a high-ceilinged, warehouse-looking place that had been converted into a studio. I do remember seeing those egg crates on the walls. I’m sure I would have remembered if it was at Floyd’s, because I knew who he was. We backed him up on some shows in Houston, but I don’t remember ever recording at his place.\n\nWe were in there, at the most, two days. We did a whole bunch that first day. It seems to me that we may have gone back the next day and done the rest.\n\nBy that time, Luther Nallie had joined the band. Luther thought that Pee Wee Wharton was playing fiddle and singing backup vocals on those first sessions. But Bob Heppler had no recollection of him playing there.\n\nIt could be...my recollection is kind of vague at times. So, that’s possible. (Fiddler) Robert Shivers came along later. Pee Wee Wharton wasn’t with the band very long. He was with us in Oklahoma City. I don’t think he went to Beaumont. We had twin fiddles there (in Beaumont), Heppler and Shivers.\n\nLuther Nallie was playing lead guitar. He wasn’t in the band very long (either).\n\nWestern Cherokees - \"Cherokee Steel Guitar\" (Starday 102) featuring Bobby Black on steel guitar, plus Robert Shivers or Pee Wee Wharton and Bob Heppler (fiddles), Burney Annett (piano), Blackie Crawford (guitar), Luther Nallie (tenor banjo), Bud Crawford (bass), and Jimmy Dennis (drums). Recorded at ACA Studio in Houston circa May, 1953.\n\nDid you come up with “Cherokee Steel Guitar”? How did that evolve?\n\nNo, I think that was Bobby Garrett’s thing. Garrett was in the band at one time before me. They had been doing it a while before I joined. Blackie showed me how it went.\n\nThere were a lot of good steel players in that band — Jimmy Biggar, Bobby Garrett, (Curly) Chalker, and of course, Pee Wee Whitewing. So I was fortunate to be, for a short time anyway, a member of that group. I always felt kind of proud, because I thought I was in fast company with so many good steel players.\n\nBobby Black on stage.\n\nWhat kind of a steel guitar did you play?\n\nI had a Bigsby. As a matter of fact, I was with Blackie in Beaumont when I got my Bigsby. Boy, that was a day I’ll never forget. It had been on back order for over a year. Before that, I had a double-neck Fender. But I used my Bigsby on all of those Starday things. God, I regret the day I let that guitar go. I don’t even know what I did with it. I sold it to somebody I guess, but I don’t even remember who. I’d give anything to have it back now.\n\nWhen I left the band and came back here, it doesn’t seem like it was long after that that I got a call from Burney Annett. He said that he and bunch of the guys were going to Springfield, Missouri, to do the Ozark Jubilee with Red Foley, and they were thinking about using me or Curly Chalker. Chalker took the gig, but kind of pleased me that they called me first. Curly had a personality that was kind of weird at times. He didn’t get along that well with a lot of people. So I think that was why they called me first. And I turned 'em down. I’ve always kind of regretted that in a way.\n\nAny final thoughts on Blackie Crawford?\n\nI really liked Blackie. He had a certain machismo about him, kind of a tough guy. But he treated me good. To this day, I remember some of the rules he had. I thought they were kind of unusual. It was because of some of the previous members of the band, including Curly Chalker — probably primarily because of Curly Chalker. One of them was that no wives or girlfriends could come to the gigs. (In California) I was used to seeing guys bring their wives or girlfriends to the gigs. But I guess that fights would break out. I never saw that happen while I was with the band, mainly because that rule was observed.\n\nBut Blackie was a fatherly figure to me. He was probably just a young guy (laughter), but I saw him as this older, fatherly kind of guy to me.\n\nBobby Black's Starday Discography\n\n101 Mary Jo Chelette\n\nA: Cat Fishing\n\nB: Gee, It's Tough To Be Thirteen\n\n102 Blackie Crawford\n\nA: Mariuch (Mottie-Ooch)\n\nThe Western Cherokees\n\nB: Cherokee Steel Guitar\n\n103 Bob Heppler\n\nA: I Don't Like It\n\nB: If You Don't Mind\n\n104 Arlie Duff\n\nA: You All Come\n\nB: Poor Ole Teacher\n\n105 Blackie Crawford and the Western Cherokees\n\nA: Huckleberry Pie\n\nThe Western Cherokees\n\nB: Hot Check Baby\n\n106 Arlie and Lois Duff\n\nA: A Million Tears\n\nArlie Duff\n\nB: Stuck-In-A-Mud Hole\n\n107 Bob Heppler\n\nA: Handle With Care\n\nB: One Step Ahead\n\n108 not issued\n\n109 Patsy Elshire\n\nA: Someday I Know He Will\n\nB: Two Can Play The Game\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDiesel Park West - Shakespeare Alabama demos (1988)\n\nDiesel Park West aren't one of my most powerful hankerings, and maybe not many others as well, but I thought a few of you might enjoy this. My own appreciation of them revolves more around certain songs, not so much entire albums. These tunes were cut in anticipation of the band's 1989 debut, Shakespeare Alabama. It's \"modern rock\" in perhaps the most commercial sense, but there are some real stunners here in the guise of the jangly \"All The Myths on Sunday,\" and the more anthemic \"When the Hoodoo Comes.\" If you're looking for a few lazy comparisons, DPW run/ran the same gamut as contemporaries Mission UK, latter-80s Alarm, and occasionally Simple Minds. Like the aforementioned, these Leicester, UK chaps emanated something resembling a social conscience, without ever getting too pious.

I am thinking of such artists as Ginette Neveu, Noel Mewton-Wood, Kathleen Ferrier, Dinu Lipatti, Guido Cantelli, William Kapell and Dennis Brain - supreme talents who all perished before their 40th birthdays.\n\nRenardy was an Austrian-born American violinist who lived from 1920-1953. Although wonderfully talented, he made relatively few commercial recordings - including only this one concerto. In the Brahms concerto, he is partnered by Charles Munch (here Münch; he later dropped the umlaut). The recording dates from September 1948 (per Gray) and was made in the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, with the resident orchestra.\n\nCharles Munch\n\nIn an appreciation that appeared in the March 1954 edition of The Gramophone (see below), Peter Ford notes that Renardy \"seemed destined to don the mantle of his compatriot Kreisler, whose style of playing was not dissimilar.\" Ford adds that the Brahms concerto, \"though well played and superbly accompanied, was ill-served in the recording where Renardy's tone was made to sound dead and hard.\" I have attempted to address the sound in this transfer, with some success, I hope.\n\nI also hope this recording gives lie to the notion that conductor Munch had little affinity for German music. To provide further evidence, I have remastered two of his rarest recordings - RCA monos of Schumann's Symphony No. 1 and Schubert's Symphony No. 2, both of which appeared here a number of years ago. The Schumann, in particular, is a glorious performance.

(1958-1974).\n\nGénero: Rock, Pop, Instrumental.\n\nThe Ted Taylor Four foi uma banda instrumental britânica formada em 1952, em Londres/UK, constituída por Ted Taylor (órgão “clavioline” e piano), Bob Rogers (guitarra), Teddy Wadmore (baixo), Dougie Wright (bateria).\n\nTed frequentemente utilizava o seu novo órgão Clavioline, usado pelo grupo The Tornados, no tema “Telstar”. The Ted Taylor Four participaram com alguma frequência em shows de rádio da BBC, assim como serviram de banda de apoio para muitos artistas de topo [Bert Weedon, por exemplo]. Gravaram vários singles pela Oriole.\n\nTed Taylor, foi um músico e pianista britânico que liderou o grupo Ted Taylor Four, banda que gravou diversos 45 rpm, fez shows em casas nocturnas e programas de rádio e TV. Esta compilação reúne precisamente os seus singles e temas gravados entre 1958 e 1974.\n\nTed participou diversas vezes com o seu “clavioline”, em muitas gravações de John Barry Seven and Orchestra.\n\nEm 1968, a banda gravou o seu único LP, “In a Midnight Mood”, pelo selo Davjon.\n\nTed faleceu em 1992.\n\nNota:\n\nO \"clavioline\" é um instrumento musical, um teclado electrónico que pode ser considerado o predecessor do sintetizador. Consiste num teclado, uma unidade de amplificação e alto-falantes. O teclado normalmente abrange a extensão de três oitavas, e possui uma série de chaves que alteram o tom do som gerado, além de produzir outros efeitos como o vibrato.\n\nVários modelos foram produzidos por diferentes fabricantes desde que foi introduzido, no final da década de 40, até o início dos anos 70, quando foi superado pelo sintetizador.\n\nO clavioline foi utilizado em inúmeras gravações de música pop como, por exemplo, na canção “Baby, You're a Rich Man”, dos Beatles.\n\nFaixas/Tracklist:\n\n01 - Ted Taylor Four - Son Of Honky Tonk\n\n02 - Ted Taylor Four - Farrago\n\n03 - Ted Taylor Four - M1\n\n04 - Ted Taylor Four - You Are My Sunshine\n\n05 - Ted Taylor Four - Fried Onions\n\n06 - Ted Taylor Four - Yellow Rock Of Texas\n\n07 - Ted Taylor Four - Cats Eyes\n\n08 - Ted Taylor Four - Canyon\n\n09 - Ted Taylor Four - Flyover\n\n10 - Ted Taylor Four - Haunted Pad\n\n11 - Ted Taylor Four - Jericho\n\n12 - Ted Taylor Four - Everytime We Say Goodbye\n\n13 - Ted Taylor Four - Surf Rider\n\n14 - Ted Taylor Four - Spotlight\n\n15 - Ted Taylor Four - How Insensitive\n\n16 - Ted Taylor Four - All I Need Now Is A Break\n\n17 - Sounds Bob Rogers - Meadowbank\n\n18 - Sounds Bob Rogers - Catsachock\n\n19 - Sounds Bob Rogers - Seven Kings\n\n20 – Bob Rogers and Playground - Take Advantage (Of Your Express Milkman)\n\nÁlbum gentilmente cedido pelo nosso amigo Thomas Hauser, a quem agradecemos.\n\n↧\n\nForty.

Folk singer-songwriter and guitarist Roberts’ solo achievements have been overshadowed by his work on recordings by other artists. He first came to public attention after meeting BBC disc jockey John Peel in 1967. During this period Roberts accompanied the Scaffold before going on to join the Liverpool Scene in 1968. He recorded his highly acclaimed solo debut Home Grown while still a member of the Liverpool Scene. Initially released on RCA Records in 1970, the album was reissued in shortened form by B&C Records the following year. Roberts recorded two further albums in 1971; the beautiful solo album Nina And The Dream Tree continued the fine work begun on Home Grown, while Everyone was recorded with the ill-fated band of the same name, featuring Roberts, Bob Sargeant, Dave Richards and John Pearson.\n\nIn 1972 Roberts joined Plainsong with whom he recorded the highly regardedIn Search Of Amelia Earhart. He then joined former Liverpool Scene colleagues Roger McGough and Adrian Henri in the Grimms from 1973-76, during which time he appeared on their final two albums. During this period Roberts also released two further solo albums, Urban Cowboy and Andy Roberts And The Great Stampede. In 1974, he featured in his first stage musical, Mind Your Head, but thereafter concentrated on session work. He worked with Roy Harper, the Albion Band and Hank Wangford. He recorded and toured with the latter artist until 1984, but continued with other session commitments, including playing guitar on Pink Floyd’s The Wall in 1981. Roberts also provided a singing voice for UK television’s satirical puppet seriesSpitting Image from 1983-84.\n\nFrom the mid-80s onwards, Roberts has been heavily involved in composing music for film, television and theatre. His flexibility is reflected in the diversity of the programmes he has composed for, ranging from television drama series such as The Men’s Room (excellent theme song sung by Sarah Jane Morris, ‘I Am A Woman’) - to Madhur Jaffrey’s Far Eastern Cookery. In his capacity as composer, Roberts has been involved with Z Cars, Bergerac and the six-part television documentary series, Where On Earth Are We Going?, in addition to writing music for the movies Loose Connections, A Masculine Ending, Priest, Mad Love, Face, and Going Off Big Time. He also acted as musical director for the Royal Court in Sloane Square, London, during the early 80s. He has also played on countless sessions by a wealth of artists, and since the early 90s has toured and recorded with the reunited Plainsong.\n\nTracks\n\nDisc 1\n\n1. The Raven - 2:30\n\n2.

Drake\n\nThis interview was conducted in 1968 at Temple Israel, in Columbus, Ohio,\n\ncourtesy of Rabbi Jerome D. Folkman.\n\n.\n\n(G. G. Bain Collection, Library of Congress)\n\n.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nI’d like to ask you more about the unique way you perform the lyrics of your songs. On your Columbia recordings, your early acoustic ones, you seem to sing more than you did when you made your electrical Columbias, and your Decca recordings several years later.\n\nWell, that had to do more with the way recording was done back then, and also the way that records were promoted. All of the record companies put out annual catalogs that [listed] their records according to categories. So there would be a section for dance records, a section for symphonic records, a section for popular music—ballads, waltzes, and what-not—and a section for humorous records, monologs and such, and always a special section for records of opera arias and an overture or section from a symphony. There may have been one or two others [i.e., categories], but that was the idea, the way these catalogs were put together.\n\nWhen I made my first records for Columbia with my own band, around 1919, if the label of the record had the words “vocal refrain” or “vocal chorus,” the people who bought the record expected to hear singing. Not necessarily ballad-singing, but you couldn’t just talk the lyrics, you had to sing them.\n\nWhen I recorded “When My Baby Smiles at Me” the first time, I was singing into a metal horn, and my band was on bleachers that were in a circle, or semi-circle, right behind me. If you listen to that [Columbia] record, I sing the line “when my baby smiles at me” just like it’s written. On any of the later [recordings], I did it like this: “When my baby”—and I say “baby,” I don’t sing it—“smiles at me”—I sing the words “smiles at,” but on “me,” I speak it. On the first record, I sang the next line, “My thoughts go roaming to paradise,” all on pitch, singing it “straight,” in other words. The recording director wanted to hear that “g” in “roaming” on the recording. Later, I would do it like this: “My thoughts to roamin’—roamin’—way up there to paradise, yessir,” and I’d “talk” the line.\n\nDo you remember where did you make your first recordings for Columbia?\n\nIn New York. The very first ones were [recorded] in space they rented on an upper floor of a building on Sixth Avenue. Then they built a new set of studios on the top floor of the Gotham Building when it was finished. Those were nice studios because the building had, I think, twenty-three stories, and the studios were on the top floor, so none of the sounds of the traffic way down below could be heard. There were big windows on three sides of each studio—there were two separate studios, back to back—and in good weather, the windows would be open and it would be very comfortable in there.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWere you offered a contract by Victor when you were at Columbia?\n\nNo. They had other bands by the late-1920’s—[Jean] Goldkette, [George] Olsen, and of course Whiteman—and I was happy at Columbia. I did well for them, and they did well for me. They designed a special silver label for my records. That was the first time any of the record companies designed a special label for a performer. That became my trademark at Columbia.\n\nAnother trademark of yours is your white-tipped cane, which you seem to be able to do anything with. You twirl it so fast that if it had lights on it, they would be a blur. How long has that been a part of your show, your act?\n\nThe baton-twirling? I had learned it as a kid, and I got to lead a very big medicine show when it came into Circleville.\n\nDo you remember the name of the medicine show? I understand that there were a lot of them in the Midwest at the turn of the century.\n\nIt was called Hamlin’s Medicine Show. It was quite a production—like a circus coming to town. There would be posters put up everywhere weeks ahead, and the show would come into town led by a marching band. [Oscar] Ameringer used many of us in the cadet band, along with others, especially brass players, to lead the parade of the Hamlin wagons into town.\n\nI used to practice almost day and night twirling that brass baton. It wasn’t like the white-tipped walking sticks I use in my act, not like what I use in “Me and My Shadow.” This one was longer, and it had a kind of bulb on one end. It was a tapered tube with the other end rounded off. I got so I could throw it in the air, catch it behind my back, do all sorts of tricks with it. I wasn’t the only bandleader who could “twirl,” you know. George Olsen used a baton in his floor shows. I think he had been a drum major.\n\nAs you hardly need me to say, there is an ongoing debate about who was first “jazz king,” Ted Lewis or Paul Whiteman. Would you comment on that debate?\n\nTo start with, look at the dates. When I was playing with Earl Fuller in 1916-1917, Paul was playing viola in a symphony orchestra. That was his background and training. His father was the conductor, or maybe director, of the Denver Symphony, which is where Paul got his start. Then listen to his first records, and compare them to mine. He didn’t make any recordings till at least two or maybe three years after I was recording with the Fuller band. Where he was lucky is that he was signed by Victor, and two of the songs his band recorded in one of their first sessions, “Whispering” and “The Japanese Sandman,” were big hits.\n\nFrankly, I never thought of Paul as a jazzman. He loved that “King of Jazz” title, and that “talkie” [of the same title] definitely put him over with the public more than his first records ever did, but if you listen to his radio shows and read some of the interviews he gave, what he talks about is not jazz in the New Orleans style, but what he liked to call “symphonic jazz.” Of course, he got that from being the one who introduced “Rhapsody in Blue,” and the one who recorded it with George [Gershwin] at the piano. But he didn’t have as much to do with that premiere as he claims he did. Ferde Grofé and Gershwin were the ones who wrote the arrangement.\n\n.\n\nSharing the limelight with Paul Whiteman (October 1928)\n\n.\n\nPaul was a solid musician—no question about that. He had that symphonic training, and he was taught by his father. But as any of the fellows who were in his bands will tell you, he was not a very good player, and just a so-so conductor. If you talk to Joe Venuti and ask him about Paul as a violist and violinist, Joe will tell you that [Whiteman’s] playing could be almost embarrassing. Yet he’d insist on playing a violin solo from the podium, always with a spotlight trained on him, and he’d be sharp or flat throughout the solo.\n\nDid you get to know each other when you were both with Columbia in the late-1920’s?\n\nNot really, no. The reason he left Victor and came to Columbia was because the head man at Victor, Nat Shilkret, had an ego like Paul did, and he wanted to decide what Paul would record. Paul thought he had made so much money for Victor that nobody there should be trying to tell him what to do. And there was another fellow [at Victor], Eddie King, who didn’t like jazz at all, and he was a “yes man” to Shilkret.\n\nNow, Ben Selvin, who got the A&R job at Columbia around 1925 or 1926, knew Paul and knew how much interference he was getting from Shilkret, so Ben talked Columbia into giving Whiteman a much better contract. Not so much better money-wise, but better because Paul could pick all of his players and arrangers, and could record whatever he wanted. And as they had done for me, the [Columbia] management designed a special label for Paul’s records.\n\nAs you know, there are music historians who maintain that jazz and blues began with a black players in New Orleans, and that white musicians, especially Whiteman, “stole” the music from its black originators and commercialized it. To the best of my knowledge, no one ever said that about you. Do you have any thoughts about that?\n\nEverybody who started playing jazz around the time I did, knew that this was New Orleans music and that the players who brought it to the north, whether we’re talking about the Midwest or New York, were blacks and Creoles. Louis Armstrong was the giant of all of them, and everybody knew where Satchmo was from. He was King Oliver’s star player. Same with Sidney Bechet. Practically every one of those early jazz and blues players you can name, whether it’s Jelly Roll Morton, or Lucky Roberts, or James P. Johnson, or the blues singers like Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith and Ethel Waters, they were all from the South.\n\nI was thinking more about why Paul Whiteman, but not Ted Lewis, has come to be seen as the one who “stole” black music, commercialized it, and made a fortune from it without ever acknowledging its real origins.\n\nI can only give you my opinion, and it’s that Paul promoted himself was the “King of Jazz.” If you’re going to advertise yourself as the King of Jazz, and you make a movie called “King of Jazz” and you’re the star of it, then you’re almost saying that this is your music, your invention, and that you’re the best one who can play it.\n\nI never did any of that. And I never pretended to play “symphonic jazz,” or anything like it. And I didn’t lead a band, let alone try to be a conductor. My band was the backdrop for my act, which has always been a stage act. I’ve never promoted myself as a bandleader because I’m not one. I came out of vaudeville, and my place is the stage, not a podium in front of a big band.\n\n.\n\nTed Lewis at the Columbia pressing plant, late 1920s\n\n(CBS archives)\n\n.\n\nYou have been so generous with your time this afternoon, and I don’t want to take any more advantage of it than you have allowed me to. But I would like to end this interview on the same topic we began, which is the clarinet. I can’t think of a well-known clarinetist of the 1930’s and 1940’s who didn’t play in one of your bands. In fact, I can’t think of any big-band member who didn’t play in one of your bands! If you won’t mind giving me your thoughts about these clarinetists, I’ll really appreciate it. Let me begin with the two best-known ones, Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw. You hired both of them for your studio sessions, am I correct?\n\nYes, both of them played with me at different times when they were studio players. I had Benny play my some of my solos in my Columbia [electrical] records. Both are great players, but if you’re asking me which one I consider the best, it’s Shaw. I haven’t heard high-register playing like Shaw’s since Al Nunez. I’m not taking anything away from Benny, who’s a terrific improviser. But Shaw was tops in my book. I just wish he hadn’t walked away from it when he did.\n\nFour other names, if I may: Johnny Dodds, Jimmy Lytell, Pee Wee Russell, and Lawrence Welk’s discovery, Pete Fountain.\n\nJohnny Dodds was the real thing, one hell of a clarinetist! You know, he replaced Al Nunez when Al had some medical [dental] problems. To me, he wasn’t anywhere near the player that Al Nunez was. You know, Pee Wee [Russell], who was probably the closest thing to the old New Orleans players, said that Al Nunez was the greatest jazz clarinetist who ever lived. That tells you a lot about both of them, because if they held one of those old “carving contests” like they had in New Orleans, Pee Wee could outplay just about anybody you’d put up next to him.\n\nYou mentioned Jimmy Lytell, who’s a favorite of mine. Jim can play anything you put in front of him—a hell of a studio clarinetist—and he can improvise with the best of them. And Jim is an Albert [system] player. Did you know that? Of course, that makes him special to me because he didn’t switch like the others did.\n\nNow, about Pete Fountain, there’s no question that he’s a first-rate clarinetist. I don’t see how he can last with Welk, any more than he could have years ago with, and I’m just picking names, Guy Lombardo or Shep Fields or Kay Kyser or Wayne King. Those fellows got where they were by sticking to a formula, and it’s not a formula that leaves much room for a “hot” soloist. Welk doesn’t pay anybody either—he pays scale, or just a little over scale. He’s lucky to have Pete Fountain because Pete draws people who wouldn’t tune in Welk.\n\nBut Welk’s show is really a musical variety show, sort of a cross between the “Hit Parade” and a vaudeville bill—a pop song by the whole band, then an Irish tenor, and the Lennon Sisters, and a violinist, then the kid with the electric guitar, and then Pete Fountain. For a New Orleans jazzman, that’s not much of an opportunity to play. So we’ll see how long that lasts with Pete.\n\nOn a talk show recently, Artie Shaw and Beverly Sills were asked how they manage criticism, whether from music critics or gossip columnists like Dorothy Kilgallen. In so many words, they said you must have, or else you must develop, thick skin and then consider the source. You have had a few critics during your long career, and one of them seems to be Eddie Condon. As you may have heard, he said in his recent book that “Ted Lewis could really make the clarinet talk, and when it did, it said, ‘Please put me back in my case.’”\n\nIf he really wrote that, if those were his own words and not his ghostwriter’s, he can’t take any credit for being original. That line has been around as far back as I can remember, and it applies to any instrument that comes in a case, whether it’s a violin or a trombone or a clarinet. But, look, he’s trying to make some money to pay the rent, so he thinks he has to put down other people in the business. It doesn’t bother me not only because it’s not original, but because you have to consider the source. Eddie Condon is no Eddie Lang. Eddie Condon plays a four-string guitar. A four-string guitar? Please! That’s nothing but an oversized ukulele. And maybe I shouldn’t have given Eddie all the work I gave him!\n\nI can’t thank you enough for the time you have given me for this interview. I’m a proud Ted Lewis fan, and will never forget how kind you were to me ten years ago when I asked for your autograph. And I assure you that I’ll never forget how generous you have been to me today. Thank you again and again and again.\n\n.\n\n© 2018 by James A. Drake. All rights are reserved.

He performed on albums by a number of jazz artists in the seventies before releasing a few of his own albums in the late seventies and early eighties.\n\nHe appeared on Billy Cobham's Total Eclipse and Clive Stevens's Voyage to Uranus (1974); Jan Hammer's First Seven Days (1975); Lenny White's Big City and Miroslav Vitouš' Majesty Music (1977); Jaroslav Jakubovic's Checkin' In, Mark Moogy Klingman's Moogy II, the Players Association's Born to Dance, and Josh White Jr.'s self-titled album (1978).\n\nJohnson's solo debut came in 1978 with Time Is Free, recorded for Vanguard Records. His relationship with that label proved short-lived, however, and he began recording albums for other labels in subsequent years before his recording career simmered following his 1983 album, the Midweek Blues.\n\nJan Hammer produced and performed on most of these releases along with John Abercrombie, Jeremy Steig, Col. Bruce Hampton, Allen Sloan, Dan Wall, Ben 'Pops' Thornton, Billy McPherson and Gary Campbell.\n\nJohnson was against the use of sampling, as Hammer used samples of his rare Nigerian Log Drums on the Miami Vice soundtrack without his permission. This resulted in a lawsuit which Johnson ultimately lost\n\nHe was married to artist Evelyne Morisot, with whom he had four children.\n\nDavid Earle Johnson is perhaps better known for who he's played with than for his solo material. This marks his first solo effort. Really not a true solo as this is more of a Johnson/Jan Hammer duet album, but Johnson gets the lead credit or only credit for most of the songs. It is a percussion driven album though with DEJ providing vocals for three tracks and JH doing the keyboard and drum kit work. Of course they have to mix it up a little - Jan plays Log on one track and David plays Moog Drum on a couple of tracks.\n\nAll of you familiar with the first incarnation of Mahavishnu Orchestra know Jan Hammer. Unfortunately, too few are acquainted with Jan's post MO albums. The first one where David and Jan worked together was on Jan's solo album The First Seven Days. I just looked it up on Wikipedia and it seem Mr. Johnson was also on an album called Voyage to Uranus the year before that one. Huh huh huh huh, huh huh, huh huh.\n\nTime is Free was released the same year as the unfortunate Hammer album Black Sheep. Then, after this one came another fairly dreadful Hammer album and then another really good Johnson/Hammer duo album, Hip Address. Unfortunately, Mr. Johnson died in 1998, R.I.P. The guy was an excellent percussionist. Not too shabby with lyrics and vocals, either.\n\nFirst up is Grandma's House. \"Let's go to Grandma's house, there we can sing loud, all of the best songs.\" Well, not at any of my grandmother's houses, but what the heck. This one has Jan doing his trademark guitar imitation synthesizer thing. David Earle does vocals and percussion. The song shifts gears in the middle and start to get a little Mahavishnuesqe. Jan goes back to a keyboard sounding like a keyboard. David Earle does some spacey vocalizations through an Echoplex. Song then wraps up with a repeat of the opening lyrics.\n\nLofts is nice jazzy fusiony piece with Jan contributing drums in addition to the keyboards as he does on many of the tracks here and he did on his duo album with Jerry Goodman.\n\nTime Is Free. \"Boom boom bang bang, look out here it comes again. Can't stop the way it flows, it never knows why it goes.\" A fun little ditty. David Earle would go on to appear in Col. Bruce Hampton/The Late Bronze Age's Outside Looking Out, which also has Paul McCandless.\n\nRamtide starts with a massive sounding percussion avalanche by DE. Jan kicks in with what may be an arpeggiated synth line and also drums. Nice mostly percussion jam.\n\nTen Little Times is another Hammer imitating guitar bit. Johnson does a thing called a Moog Drum solo that's really cool. It may likely be heard no where else but here. More MO flavored music here.\n\nJuice Harp. A play in words on Jew's Harp. (Probably not a lot of people familiar with that silly little instrument, akaa jaw harp or mouth harp. Supposed to be one of the oldest musical instruments in the world) I'm guessing the song was named after Jan's synthesizer impression of the instrument.\n\nSea, Sand and Sun. Opens with DEJ on treble kalimba solo. The a nice duo of Jan on piano and DEJ on various percussion.\n\nSafes. Lots of cool synthesizer licks and percussion on this one. A very complex composition.\n\nSkin, Log, Sand Street Suite. Skins must be the furious opening conga solo, the log must be the percussion duo which follows. Sand Street? Well, there's a lot of them in the U.S. Maybe referring to the one in New Orleans? Another fine song demonstrating that a song can be built with just percussion, although Jan does put in a little synthesizer. Jan's musical contribution is Hammer at his best, not like the overly commercial material he was starting to do around this time.\n\n↧\n\nDavid Earle Johnson - 1979 - Skin Deep - Yeah!\n\nDavid Earle Johnson\n\n1979\n\nSkin Deep - Yeah!\n\n01.
