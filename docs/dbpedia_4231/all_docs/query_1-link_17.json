        "text": "Back in 1970 the man practising medicine as Dr Sam Hutt was visited by Gram Parsons, the legendary musical catalyst for the likes of The Byrds, The Rolling Stones and Emmylou Harris.\n\n“I was Ian Dury’s doctor, Pink Floyd’s doctor,” Wangford told Country Music People last year.\n\n“If any of them had sore throats, they’d call me in. It was easy for them to see someone like me because I had long hair like them and was unshockable.\n\n“If you came to see me and you were having headaches and, in taking your history, you were a dope smoker and you wanted me to prescribe you tincture of cannabis, I could give it to you legally and you didn’t have to go and see the dealer. You were suddenly legal and I had taken a whole area of worry and anxiety off your back.”\n\nPrior to meeting Gram he had seen country music in the same way that most English rock lovers in the 1960s had – he hated it.\n\n“Gram was the great evangelist,” he says. “He managed to fool us all with [his band] the [Flying] Burritos [Brothers] that they were rock ’n’ roll, when it was country music they were playing.”\n\nIt was a break-up with his girlfriend a few years later which inspired the good doctor to change his name and pick up his guitar, having previously dabbled in the music industry as a busker, songwriter and psychedelic musician releasing a single under the name Boeing Duveen And The Beautiful Soup.\n\nBut the persona of Hank, “a great name for an emotional w****** wallowing in self-pity”, allowed him to explore his misery and sort his life out at the same time.\n\nHe made his first live appearance a month later in the Suffolk town of Bungay and hasn’t looked back since.\n\nHis initial lyrics were quite comic – with self-abuse being an early theme – but musically he was working with the likes of pedal steel player B J Cole, last seen in Brighton playing the live version of Brian Eno’s Apollo: Atmospheres And Soundtracks album.\n\nFor many years Wangford has been backed by The Lost Cowboys, who also feature Elvis Costello and Johnny Cash sidesman Martin Belmont, bassist Kevin Foster, and former Fairground Attraction drummer Roy Dodds. The band played on his last album Whistling In The Dark (pictured) which was released in 2008.\n\nAs time has gone on, his lyrics have seen him tackle the plight of the striking miners in the 1980s and look back over his own life.\n\nBut although he is the toast of many a country music festival, Wangford is dedicated to bringing music to areas that might not see live gigs that often.\n\nHis tour of the Falkland Islands, with The Lost Cowboys in 1999, was filmed for the BBC.\n\nAnd his No Hall Too Small solo tours, organised with the Arts Council-funded Rural Arts Scheme, have seen him play more than 220 village halls over the past five years.\n\nHe is currently writing a book about the experience.\n\nSupport from Brad Breath (aka Andy Roberts).\n\n* 8pm, SOLD OUT, 01273 680734"
