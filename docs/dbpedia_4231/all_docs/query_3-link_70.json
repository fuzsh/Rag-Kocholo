        "text": "Gigography\n\n1980\n\nThanks to Nick Atkins (early Europeans sound engineer), I have been able to compile a list of early shows performed by the band:\n\n02/09/80 Rock Garden, Covent Garden, London\n\n01/10/80 Ronnie Scotts, London\n\n13/10/80 The Bridgehouse, Canning Town, London (support)\n\n16/10/80 Half Moon, Herne Hill (support)\n\n18/10/80 Basildon\n\n20/10/80 Top Rank, Brighton\n\n28/10/80 The Ship, Maidstone\n\n(Steve Martin, fan) I worked at a pub called The Ship, in Maidstone from 1980 to 1982 (actually it was technically a wine bar I think). The pub started having a live band every week, some of which ventured down from London. I can remember the names of a few of them: Alcatraz (local NWBHM band that released a couple of albums), Nicky Moore Band (blues rock singer who later replaced Bruce Dickinson in rock band Samson and is still on the blues circuit I believe), Hotel UK (Liverpool version of Sad Café who released a single)  and the Europeans. It was a long time ago now, and I cant remember that much. But I do remember how the Europeans stood out. They went down extremely well and had a good following at the pub, and it was very clear what a well-rehearsed tight outfit they were and that they would surely have a future. They got on well with the pub landlords family (also Scottish)  the landlady wanted to mother them! After the band had got their kit away and the pub was cleaned and tidied for the night, it would be a drink or two with the band and landlords family. I remember Fergus saying he wasnt sure what his mum would say when she found out hed bleached his hair! I remember a coach trip being organised at the pub, to go and support the band at a gig somewhere (cant remember where, London I guess - I missed the coach and the gig).

Still experimental, the new image requires refinement but it's a great improvement. The material's the killer though. Sharper than ever, songs like 'Joining Dots' & 'Tokyo' are blasting, pumping, aggressive slices of punchy pop; a nod to the tougher edge of the Sinceros, while 'Going to Work' (an anthem for the unhappily employed) convinces with its abrasive guitar riff curling through the verse and the power of the song's sentiments.

You can wonder why A&M flew Scotlands Europeans to the US for a limited tour (New Yok and Los Angeles) in support of the new Recognition EP. The band had barely 45 minutes of material to present, and played to the smallest house the Palace had seen all season. This despite the fact that the bands Animal Song is on such heavy KROQ rotation that it has become the stations theme piece. Lead singer Fergus Harper dresses like a Chinese peasant and wears a hairstyle best described as exploding mushroom cap. His antics, combined with keyboardist Steve Hogarths imitation of a refugee from Adam and the Ants, attempt to add life and energy to songs that wont stand up on their own merit. The group perform: Innocence, Recognition, Falling, Television (sic  probably Tunnel Vision) and AEIOU (not to be confused with Ebn Ozns AEIOU and Sometimes Y). And they did Animal Song twice. If we missed one, its because their songs all sounded pretty much the same. The show was opened by Orange Countys Ascenders who had been signed to Boardwalk, poor boys.

It was an excellent gig and the first Id ever taken a camera to. Though I was into all kinds of 80s music, I went there not really knowing what to expect. Id seen them a while back on Whistle Test I think, and my mate had just seen them on The Tube, but other than that we knew little about them. The Student Union Hall at Huddersfield Poly was quite small, and I just remember it being packed out that night hot, sweaty and really bouncing by the end. Got well soaked with beer during Animal Song' as I recall. I confess though that it was Acid Rain though that stayed in my head when I left the gig, and I went out and bought the Recurring Dreams album that weekend. The song is as relevant today as it was back then and became a lifetime favourite of mine. I picked up the Live album a few months later and still play it today and remember that night.

I finally managed to figure out it was Chris De Burgh I'd seen with 'How We Live' - much to Hogarth's embarrassment!

But if you walked in to the Marquee tonight, you'd have found it bloody impossible. The audience, you see comprised of coloured, spikey hairstyles, a girl wearing jackboots, arty farties, pessimistic housewives and cravat-wearing tourists - a pretty mixed bunch huh? Either How We Live can't be categorised, or their recent tour with Chris De Burgh has attracted a highly diverse following. Their music is breezy, middle of the road, cool calypso, plus both smoochey and lively rock - although listening to their recent single 'All the Time in the World', you'd never guess that this band could offer such a mixture. Elfin frontman Steve Hogarth draws the crowd in. He sings loud yet effortlessly, and springs, crouches and writhes, energised by the sounds around him. He plays piano and the notes tipple like a waterfall with cymbals making metallic splashes among the guitar lathered waves. Each song is markedly different and there's hardly a break between each finger clicking number. How We Live know how to live. It seems that life is there to be enjoyed rather than merely endured, and they do their best to loosen up the unwilling. - Kez Owen\"\n\n26/09/86 Wembley Arena, London\n\n27/09/86 Wembley Arena, London\n\n28/09/86 Wembley Arena, London\n\n29/09/86 Wembley Arena, London\n\n01/10/86 King's Hall, Belfast\n\n02/10/86 King's Hall, Belfast\n\n03/10/86 King's Hall, Belfast\n\n06/10/86 Brighton Arena\n\n07/10/86 Brighton Arena (Last night of the Chris de Burgh tour)\n\n08/10/86 Dingwalls, Camden, London\n\n1987\n\n26/03/87 Mannheim (first night of German mini-tour supporting Chris De Burgh + others)\n\n27/03/87 Offenbach\n\n20/06/87 Oldenburg, Weser-ems-Halle\n\n24/06/87 Hannover, Messehalle\n\n25/06/87 Berlin, Waldbuhne\n\nPhotos Here:\n\nColin Woore (li ) und Steve Hogarth (How We Live) in Berlin (imago-images.com)\n\n(Colin Woore) \"The Berlin gig took place in a stadium that was a natural amphitheatre in the middle of some woods where Hitler made a lot of his speeches.
