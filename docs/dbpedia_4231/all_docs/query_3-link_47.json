        "text": "One afternoon in the mid 1960s, Pete Jenner left off marking exam papers at the London School of Economics and popped into the Marquee club. There was a band playing, They changed his life - and he changed theirs.\n\nPete enters the Bureau of Lost Culture to tell us about discovering The Pink Floyd, the band he and Andrew King guided from darlings of the underground to early commercial success.\n\nBut that was just the beginning. We hear about Pete' early life as the son of a radical vicar and how politics and music blended in his involvement in the early days of the West London Underground scene: The London Free School, The Tabernacle, The UFO club and the start of the Hyde Park festivals.\n\nWe learn about the tragic disintegration of Syd Barrett who Pete and Andrew King chose to back whilst Pink Floyd went onto to global stardom, and we learn something about the ins and outs of a life spent in music, fostering the careers of Marc Bolan, Roy Harper, Ian Drury, The Clash and Billy Bragg amongst many others..\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nROGER BURTON started out working on a farm and ended up running a Horse Hospital. No, he’s not a vet but has spent most of his life clothing, collecting and curating the counterculture. Along the way, he has designed shops for Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, provided the clothes for Quadrophenia, and Absolute Beginners, dressed the New Romantics, styled 100s of pop videos and given a leg up to many fringe artists (inc. me).\n\nWe dig deep into Rebel Threads, his amazing book and collection of youth culture clothing from the 1920s - 1980s, hear about the birth of Mod, selling gear to the Kings Road boutiques of the 60s and 70s and how the actual 18th century Horse Hospital he runs has provided a venue for 27 years worth of unparalleled radical, fringe gigs, film, exhibitions and happenings in central London. And how, despite wide support across both the mainstream culture and the counterculture, it is facing closure due to the usual sad London story of property developer greed.)\n\nFor more on Roger, Rebel Threads and The Horse Hospital\n\nhttp://thehosrsehospital.com\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nChick.Trip.Dope, Pad. Heavy. Cool. Scene. Man. Beat. Freak. Weed. Bang. Square. Blast. Cat. Gas!\n\nIn an action packed episode, we spend a Soho afternoon with 'Mr Slang’ Jonathon Green discussing his amazing life in the counterculture, writing for Rolling Stone and the underground magazines including IT, OZ and Friends.\n\nThen we dig deep into his ground breaking catalogue of the counterculture: ‘Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground' with its interviews of over a hundred figures involved in the counterculture including Paul McCartney, Barry Miles and Jenny Fabian.\n\nAnd, as Jonathon is our foremost lexicographer of slang, he takes us on wander into the weird and wonderful world of countercultural language, exploring where all those hippie and beatnik words came from and discovering why ‘Fuck' is not in fact a swear word.\n\nFor more on Jonathon’s books\n\nhttp://jonathongreen.co.uk\n\nFor more on Jonathon’s Slang Dictionaries\n\nhttps://greensdictofslang.com\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nPeter Whitehead was an innovative English writer and filmmaker who documented the counterculture in London and New York in the late 1960s.\n\nHis film Wholly Communion captured The International Poetry Incarnation, a groundbreaking event at The Royal Albert Hall in 1965 that was to prove pivotal in the evolution of the underground scene. The film featured poetry readings by Beat poets including Allen Ginsberg, Michael Horovitz, Adrian Mitchell and Lawrence Ferlinghetti and established Whitehead as the London counterculture’s 'Man With a Movie Camera’.\n\nFilm event producer Marek Pytel walks us through Whtehead's life and work including the iconic 'Tonite Let's All Make Love in London’ documentary that helped define the \"swinging London\" scene of the sixties with psychedelic performances and interviewees including Pink Floyd, John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Mick Jagger, Vanessa Redgrave, Lee Marvin, Julie Christie, Allen Ginsberg, Eric Burdon, Michael Caine and many others.\n\nWe hear how Whitehead went onto film with The Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix and to make provocative work about the countercultural protest movement in late 60s New York before making an extraordinary career swerve.\n\nFor More on Marek Pytel's work see www.realityfilm.co.uk\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nOne our foremost living writers on the esoteric, Gary Lachman, enters the Bureau purportedly to talk about one of our most important, if rather forgotten, dead writers on the esoteric, T C Lethbridge.\n\nWe do get around to exploring Lethbridges's various incarnations as a rogue psychic archaeologist, dowser and parapsychologist but only after some serious digressions into Gary’s various incarnations including his time playing bass for Blondie in mid 70s New York. We hear how he was escorted out of David Bowie’s loft apartment by two glamorous bodyguards after a disagreement over Lethbridge, delve into the meaning of ‘Counterculture’ and dip into the subject of precognitive dreaming before finishing up with a story about a hedgehog.\n\nIn other words, there’s something for everyone..\n\nFor more on Gary Lachman and his work\n\nhttps://garylachman.co.uk\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nJournalist Tom O Neill, author of 'Chaos: Charles Manson, the CIA and the Secret History of the Sixties’, joins us to reveal the truths, untruths, secrets and conspiracies behind the most famous crime of the 60s.\n\nThe Tate-Labianca murders and the subsequent trial of 'The Manson Family' were among the events that marked the turning of the countercultural tide and the darkening of the hippy dream.\n\nTom tells how a straightforward 1999 magazine commission to write an anniversary piece on the murders turned into a 20 year investigative odyssey that revealed a devastating story of corruption, deception, lying and abuse - and that was just from the authorities.\n\nWas Manson a CIA asset gone rogue?\n\nWe are not fans of conspiracy theories but Tom's research reveals an extraordinary and deeply worrying web involving the CIA, the Beach Boys, LSD, hypnotism, doctors, psychologists and bent lawyers.\n\nFor more on Tom and the book:\n\nhttps://www.littlebrown.com/titles/tom-oneill/chaos/9780316477574/\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nWe return for the second part of our trip through the terrific, tortuous and terrible times of Michael Hollings(acid)head with psychedelic historian Andy Roberts.\n\nWe reconnect with Hollingshead as he is returning to England to set up the London Psychedelic Centre in Chelsea. He has introduced Timothy Leary to LSD and thus played a momentous part in the history of the counterculture in the USA.\n\nBut that was just one event in a picaresque life involving 'turning on' various celebrities including Paul McCartney, Donovon and a cold war spy, living in Scottish communes, the back-stabbing of various friends, being beastly to women and taking more and more LSD.\n\nHollingshead goes on the run - on acid. Hollingshead defends himself in court - on acid. Hollingshead serves a prison sentence - on acid.\n\nAndy, whose biography, Divine Rascal, is the first full account of the man, leads us to the end of the labyrinthine life of a character who was one part psychedelic, one part psychopathic.\n\nFor more on Andy Roberts and ‘Divine Rascal'\n\nhttp://strangeattractor.co.uk/shoppe/divine-rascal/\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nIn the first of an occasional series of broadcasts around the subject of LSD, psychedelic historian Andy Roberts takes us on the first part of a trip through the extraordinary life and times of Michael Hollingshead.\n\nHollingshead's assertion that he ‘turned on the world’ may be wildly immodest, but he did introduce Timothy Leary (and many others) to acid and thus played an essential role in the evolution of the counterculture in the USA and the UK.\n\nHe remains relatively forgotten - and his home town of Darlington does not figure in the topography of Acid culture - despite his tremendous consciousness changing exploits.\n\nBut he was no saint. Andy, whose book Divine Rascal is the first biography of Hollingshead, charts the idiosyncracies and rise and fall of a man variously described as a Zelig, holy fool, trickster, black magician, sociopath, charlatan, genius, fabulist, junkie, alcoholic, secret agent, police informer, disruptor and sex mad preacher of Love who didn't actually understand love.\n\nTo be continued.\n\nFor more on Andy and ‘Divine Rascal'\n\nhttp://strangeattractor.co.uk/shoppe/divine-rascal/\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nWriter and cultural commentator Paul Gorman takes us on an exploration of the countercultural designer Barney Bubbles. It is an extraordinary story, magic and tragic by turn.\n\nBubbles, who, despite his effervescent alias, was so modest that he declined to have his name included on the many extraordinary album covers he designed, has rather faded from public awareness since his untimely suicide. But he remains much admired by lovers of album cover art and has influenced a growing coterie of graphic designers.\n\nPaul, who has championed him with a biography and three exhibitions, traces his life and work from the hard boiled world of advertising and commercial graphics in the 60s, through the psychedelic West London underground scene of the early 70s, to the post punk era of Stiff Records and beyond. Along the way we hear of some of the outpourings of the cornucopia that was Bubbles’ mind, including the designs of Frendz magazine, the Hawkwind Tarot, The Specials' Ghost Town video - and those album covers..\n\nAnd we hear about Paul’s own journey and, as usual, speculate on the nature of this creature called ‘counterculture’.\n\nFor more on Paul Gorman\n\nhttps://www.paulgormanis.com\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nEnter the labyrinth. Perambulator and psycho-geographer Robert Kingham leads us down the twisting, turning tunnels and lost highways of the London labyrinth to meet author, mystic and cockney visionary Arthur Machen.\n\nWe explore Machen’s odd life and books - and some strange parts of the city - as we uncover the ways he was to influence the folk horror movement and countercultural cult authors H P Lovecraft and Alan Moore.\n\nWe ask:\n\nWas Machen the first London psycho-geographer?\n\nDid he really take a packet of currant biscuits with him on his epic perambulations through the sleeping city?\n\nWhere is the labyrinth?\n\nFor more on Robert and Minimum Labyrinth\n\nminimum labyrinth\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\n‘America’s leading scholar of High Strangeness’ Dr.Erik Davis, enters the Bureau.\n\nWe hear about Erik’s career charting the highs and lows of counterculture, esoterica and psychedelia in America and meet three of the most influential radical psychedelic characters of 1970s - the writers / thinkers / lunatics Philip K Dick, Terence McKenna and Robert Anton Wilson.\n\nEach had extraordinary mystical experiences in the heady days of early 1970 countercultures which kickstarted an incredible outpouring of radical theories, fiction, speculations, conspiracy theories and consciousness exploration.\n\nWe hear about radical politics, drugs, strange new religions, environmentalism, cults and the darkening of the psychedelic dream as the sunny uplands of the 1960s turn into the confused melting pot of the 1970s.\n\nFor more on Erik Davis:\n\nwww.techgnosis.com\n\nFor more on Bureau Of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nMike Jay, the UK’s foremost historian of psychoactive plants, joins us to talk about the deeply strange hallucinogen/drug/medicine/sacrament mescaline - a substance derived from the peyote cactus.\n\nWhilst other psychedelic compounds are more popular - and much more in the news - Mike tells us why mescaline was actually the very first psychedelic.\n\nWe hear strange stories of drug use in 19th century London, Native American medicine ceremonies - and Bovril..\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culturewww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nMore about Mike's work\n\nwww.mikejay.net\n\nWe meet with film director Olivia Litchenstein and BBC Russian Arts presenter Alexander Kan to hear about the extraordinary musician Sergey Kuryokhin, ‘the Soviet Punk Frank Zappa’ who with his underground cohorts in Leningrad tried to soundtrack perestroika as the cold war crumbled around them.\n\nOlivia tells of the strange circumstances of the making of the BBC TV series Comrades during the twilight of the Soviet Empire, with tales of tapes smuggled in diplomatic bags and a bizarre intervention by Ronald Reagan.\n\nAlex tells of his friendship with Kuryokhin, an incredibly talented, charming musical provocateur whose live performances astonished Russian audiences. And we learn of the bizarre prank Kuryokhin played on National TV claiming Lenin was a magic mushroom, just one of many dadaist interventions he made before his tragically early death.\n\nThe Comrades program featuring Sergey Kuryokhin: https://youtu.be/ibY2lXdgdnM\n\nFor more on The Bureau of Lost Culture:\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nThis Episode explore three stories of cold war era radio in the USSR: Soviet Radio Jammers, the Russian ‘Woodpecker’ and the Soviet Radio Hooligans\n\nWe meet with Russian broadcaster Vladimir Raevsky to talk about radio jamming in cold war era Soviet Union.\n\nAs East and West super powers square up to each with nuclear weapons, a parallel invisible war is being fought in the airwaves.\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars are spent on broadcasting propaganda and music into the Soviet Union - and on attempting to block them from being heard.\n\nStephen tells the strange story of the ‘Russian Woodpecker’, a dystopian broadcasting station near the Chernobyl nuclear reactor and alleged attempts to brainwash the West using radar.\n\nBBC Russian Arts correspondant Alex Kan, sits in a London cafe and tells of the brave young ‘Radio hooligans' who broadcast their own individual pirate radio shows during his youth in the USSR.\n\nFor More on the Bureau of Lost Culture:\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nFor the first, and probably the last, time the bureau are joined by a member of royalty - Prince Michael of Sealand\n\nThe Principality of Sealand claims a population of 27, is around 4500 m2 and lies 7.5 miles off the coast of the UK - it is situated on a World War Two Maunsell fort and claims to be an independent sovereign state.\n\nIt is one of several micro-nations dotted around the globe and its history is an extraordinary David and Goliath narrative worthy of a Bond movie.\n\nSealand's ruler, Prince Michael, regales us with tales of his extraordinary father, nautical derring do and astonishing childhood adventures on the high seas.\n\nWe hear about the early days of pirate radio, abductions, kidnappings, sawn-off shotguns, invasions by helicopter and how to become a citizen - or even a lord or lady - of the The Smallest Country in the World.\n\nFor more on Sealand\n\nhttps://sealandgov.org\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nWas counterculture possible in the oppressive, repressive circumstances of the Soviet Union?\n\nJoin us as we meet with broadcaster, author and cultural commentator Artemyi Troistsky - the 'Russian John Peel’ - to find out.\n\nWe hear some entertaining, comical, tragic, moving and frankly strange stories including tales of the ‘Stilyagi' Soviet Hipsters, the first disco in Moscow, Che Guevara and Lenin as a mushroom.\n\nAnd we hear how rock music evolved in secret before breaking into the light as perestroika transformed Soviet society.\n\nFor more on Art:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemy_Troitsky\n\nFor more on the Bureau of Lost Culturewww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nWe meet with writer Barry Cain, punk correspondent for Record Mirror during the incendiary years 1977 - 1979.\n\nBarry tells of his London journey from a Kings Cross council estate to touring with the Sex Pistols, The Clash and the greatest bands of the punk generation.\n\nWe hear of early meetings with The Stranglers, Sid Vicious and John Lydon, a fantatsical financial fraud perpetrated on a transatlantic flight with The Damend’s Rat Scabies and evenings recording Malcolm McLaren’s secret memoirs\n\nBarry Cain is journalist and author of ’77 Sulphate Strip: An Eyewitness Account of the Year that changed everything’ amongst other books.\n\nHe co-founded the influential Flexi Pop magazine and has written extensively on pop music.\n\nFor more on Bureau of Lost Culture\n\nwww.bureauoflostculture.com\n\nIn this episode, we meet with radical doctor Sam Hutt who ministered to countercultural London in the 1960s and with Hank Wangford, English Country and Western singer par excellence.\n\nSam tells us about growing up in a 1950s communist household in a posh part of London.
