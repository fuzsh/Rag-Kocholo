        "text": "As Scout fundraising events go, Patrick Hughes’ idea for getting himself to the 23rd Scouts World Jamboree later this summer was ambitious.\n\nIt involved organising a whole evening of entertainment for a discerning, ticket-buying audience with legendary British country star Hank Wangford and fellow country singer Brad Breath, at Great Ayton Parochial Hall.\n\nNot only did the 16-year-old pull off the feat, he was also commended for his efforts by Wangford himself.\n\nPatrick, from Great Ayton, involved family, friends, the parish church and local businesses in organising and promoting the event in which the singers, otherwise known as Dr Sam Hutt and Andy Roberts, perform country music in a show designed to highlight the humour, irony and \"downright misery\" of the genre.\n\nThe musician was so impressed with the evening, he sent a message of congratulations and some of his merchandise to Patrick.\n\nWangford’s agent Dave Boardman, of Doddnaze Artists, had been in contact with Patrick as the youngster organised the event.\n\n“I realised the person I was dealing with had little experience of organising a gig,” said Mr Boardman.\n\n“We frequently help inexperienced folks organise events, but I was astonished to get to Great Ayton and discover Patrick is a teenager. What a sensible and mature lad, he did a great job. With our help and guidance, experience is not always necessary, but enthusiasm is - and Patrick has that in spades.”\n\nThe 1st Great Ayton Scout Group member is hoping to fly out to the jamboree in July, after the sell-out covered Wangford and Breath’s fees and raised another £1,155 towards travel to Japan.\n\nPatrick had been selected to take part in the celebration, which involves eight to ten days camping with scouts from around the world, as well as a weekend in Tokyo and a visit to Hiroshima on the 70th anniversary of the bombing. The cost is covered by the Scouting movement, but Patrick had to find the £3,000 for his airfare himself, which he has now done successfully.\n\nThe teenager said: “I’d seen Hank play before a couple of times and I thought because he does a 'No Hall Too Small' tour he would be happy to play the village hall here.\n\n\"I then went online to find an email and took it from there. It was really nice of him to send me a CD and some stuff afterwards.”\n\nWangford said: “We had a great evening, great folks and what a star young Patrick turned out to be. He restores faith in the young, who generally get such a bad press these days.”\n\nBesides being well-known in British country music for several decades and president of the Nude Mountaineering Society, Hank Wangford has also been a nominee at the Edinburgh Comedy Awards.\n\nThe musician intends to be back at Great Ayton next year for another fundraiser."
