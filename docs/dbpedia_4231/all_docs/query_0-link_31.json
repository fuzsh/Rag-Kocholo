        "text": "The legendary country and western musician, who started his career as a rock and roll doctor, is in town on Friday night to take his place as star billing at the town’s very first Hat Festival.\n\nSome have called him the ‘doyen of British Country Music’, others have dubbed him ‘the High Priest of Pain’.\n\nNo matter what you call him, he has inspired a whole generation of alternative country music stars with his gritty take on country music.\n\nHank loves country music and continues to tour extensively both with the Lost Cowboys and as a duo with Andy Roberts touring village halls on the Rural Arts Scheme. He will be returning to Dorset with his No Hall Too Small tour, courtesy of Artsreach, later this autumn.\n\nA regular visitor to Bridport – and debonair hat-wearer to boot – Hank will be joined on stage by Bridport’s Mr Snook, organiser of the Hat Festival, for this heartfelt and hatfelt celebration of headwear and music.\n\nAs well as live music at the arts centre, Electric Palace, George Hotel and Ropemakers, the festival promises all sorts of heady entertainment.\n\nThere are hat-making workshops for young and old, drama, vintage cars and cream teas and cocktails at the Bull Hotel. Cabaret and sensual Argentinean dance have also been lined up, so grab yer titfer and pop along.\n\nSaturday will see an ‘off the wall’ evening of entertainment at the arts centre.\n\nMatt Harvey (Radio Four regular and Championship Poet 2010 at Wimbledon) will be bringing his all embracing poetry.\n\nHe’ll be joined by John Barclay and his deftly crafted poetry and Helen Arney will also be joining in with the fun.\n\nTickets are flying out fast, but you can catch yours by ringing the Bridport Arts Centre box office on 01308 424204 or popping in.\n\n* Tickets for Hank Wangford and the Lost Cowboys are £14 plus concessions from the box office on 01308 424204. Tickets for the Hat Festival Cabaret are £10 and £8 concession."
