Roberts was ubiquitous in the 70s

Liverpool Scene, Plainsong,

Grimms and various other hardtouring,

if largely unsung,

aggregations. Later he would be a

support musician in the Pink Floyd

set-up, and after that, the guitarplaying

sidekick of country-singing

gynaecologist Hank Wangford.

The Great Stampede was his

1973 shot at stardom. and was

released on the American Elektra

label – suitably so, as Roberts’

musical heart lies on that side of

the Atlantic. Musicians include BJ

Cole, Britain’s king of the steel

guitar, Zoot Money on keys, and

Fotheringay’s rhythm section.

Scarcely a note is wasted. Clowns

On The Road, reflecting his time

with musical comedians Grimms,

is particularly poignant.
