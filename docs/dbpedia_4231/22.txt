We are thrilled to welcome back the legendary and charismatic Hank Wangford and saddle partner, Brad Breath (Andy Roberts).

Hank and Brad offer a show of stories from the highway of life and a clutch of original heartbreakers, toe-tappers and gems culled from the dark underbelly of Country. Laughter and pain are both sides of the same tear-stained coin.

Dolly Parton said that Country Music “is 3 chords and the truth”. With Hank and Brad it’s sometimes only two – but a very good two.

Brad is celebrated for his classic Glimpses of Gloom and his mastery of the guitar, mandolin and dulcimer. As Andy Roberts, Brad has played with The Scaffold, Bonzo Dog, Plainsong, Billy Connolly, Pink Floyd and many others.

Hank Wangford, godfather of British Country music for over 3 decades, was indoctrinated by Gram Parsons in 1970. He has lassoed the hearts and minds of his public in songs, TV series and books.

“Country music has always zeroed in on the tiniest aspects of life and love, loss, despair and triumph. It does this with great doses of irony while it laughs through the tears. With simple direct songs, stories of life, great tunes and nothing held back what more do we want? It is far from the sentimental morass of trite emotions it is often made out to be and Hank celebrates this undervalued art form and its unwavering focus on the trials of life. For some it is too emotional, too heart on the sleeve but this inability to hold back or dissemble is exactly what Hank loves.”
