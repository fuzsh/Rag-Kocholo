Sam Hutt with Andy Roberts, BJ Cole, Melanie Harrold, Howard Tibble and Gary Taylor

Dr Samuel Hutt is one of the most unique sights in British comedy, both a wry country and western singer and a qualified GP who has helped post-Ceau≈üescu Romania in its family planning activities. Now touring as Hank Wangford and The Lost Cowboys Hutt's music is more traditional in it approach but his earlier comedy stylings have been hugely influential to subsequent musical comedy acts.
