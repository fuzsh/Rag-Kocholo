Chelsea Handler realized she had to break up with her NBC executive ex-boyfriend Ted Harbert after having a threesome with him and her masseuse.

“I was very turned on by this woman,” the comedian told Andy Cohen.

“I ended up hooking up with her several times without the guy.”

The ménage à trois caused Handler, 48, to realize she was more into the unidentified masseuse than Harbert, which ultimately led to the demise of their relationship.

The stand-up star dated the former NBC Broadcasting chairman, now 67, for four years before calling things off in 2010. He married Lisa Medrano the following year.

Handler admitted she never told Harbert that she was sleeping with the masseuse on the side, but she called their threesome “fun” and said she would have one again.

I don’t want to get double-teamed by a guy, but I would like another girl in the situation,” she said. “You know? She can do all the stuff that I’m too f–king lazy to do.”

Handler shared that she doesn’t love the idea of a man she is dating wanting to add another guy into the equation.

The former “Chelsea Lately” host also said that she would “question” why a male partner would want to have “penetration” with another man.
