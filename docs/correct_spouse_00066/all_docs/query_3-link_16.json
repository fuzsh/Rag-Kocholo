        "text": "Chelsea Handler opened up about her split from ex-boyfriend Jo Koy over the summer and revealed the pair haven’t spoken in “awhile,” RadarOnline.com has learned.\n\nThe 47-year-old comedian’s remarks came on Tuesday, just more than five months since she and Koy, 51, split up on July 18.\n\nBut according to Handler, she has no plans to reach out to her comedian ex-boyfriend until Koy takes “some accountability” for his alleged actions and behaviors that resulted in the pair’s summer split.\n\n“I mean, there has to be some accountability, you know what I mean?” Handler told Brooke Shields during the Tuesday episode of Shields’ podcast, Now What? “Like, from him about what happened, because it was just ridiculous.”\n\nShe added, “I don’t think we can have a friendship until there’s some accountability and some responsibility taken.”\n\nAs RadarOnline.com previously reported, Handler and Koy were first linked together romantically in September 2021 after being close friends for years before.\n\n“Walking away from him was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do,” she admitted to Shields. “I got a taste of what that togetherness feels like, and I want it again.”\n\nAs RadarOnline.com reported, Handler and Koy’s split came as a surprise particularly because the pair were caught constantly packing on PDAs and dropping the L-bomb towards each other for months prior to the breakup."
