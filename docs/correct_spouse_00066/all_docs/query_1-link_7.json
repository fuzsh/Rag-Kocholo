        "text": "Chelsea Handler and Jo Koy called it quits just ahead of their one-year anniversary, the comedians shared via a pre-recorded video posted on Instagram on July 18, 2022.\n\n“In anticipation of celebrating our first year together, Jo and I recorded this video early, but as many of you have noticed, it is with a heavy heart to announce that we have decided together that it is best for us to take a break from our relationship right now. I know many of you were invested in our love, and I wanted to express to you how much that meant to both of us. How much it still means. And how much I now believe in love for each one of us. This man blew my heart open with love, and because of him, my life experience has changed forever. To be loved and adored by @jokoy has been one of the greatest gifts of my life. He renewed my faith in men, in love, in being 100% who I am, and I’ve never been more optimistic for the future,” Handler wrote, adding, “Jo - you blew my creativity open, my lust for working hard again, being on the road again, and you reminded me who I was and always have been, and my feet have never been more firmly planted in the ground.”\n\nKoy also posted about it to Instagram, writing, “Just want everyone to know that Chelsea and I will always remain great friends and will always have love for one another. I’m her biggest fan and I can’t wait for you all to see what she has in store for the future. Keep killing it Chelsea! Mahal kita!”\n\nHandler and Koy began as friends, though made things romantic in September 2021.\n\nJo Koy is a renowned stand-up comedian hailing from Seattle. He is known for his hilarious humor that usually revolves around his family life, specifically his Filipino heritage. The comedian’s talent for storytelling and knack for garnering laughs has managed to make him a regular panel member on Chelsea Lately, a late-night comedy talk show hosted by Chelsea Handler."
