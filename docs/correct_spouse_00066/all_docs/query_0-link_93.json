        "text": "Ladies and gentleman, Chelsea Handler is reportedly single … However, we thought we’d check out all of Handler’s high-profile ex-boyfriends since she’s often talked about the guys she’s banged on her show Chelsea Lately. With Chelsea Lately coming to a close, let’s look back on all the guys who’ve gotten into the star’s pants over the years.\n\n1. 50 Cent\n\n50 Cent was probably Handler’s most high-profile relationship. For the Chelsea Lately finale, 50 Cent is even coming on as a musical guest, so the two are definitely on good terms. However, that wasn’t always the case. The two met on her show and things took off from there, but things went sour when 50 Cent’s ex Ciara came on her show. Right before Ciara’s appearance on Chelsea Lately, 50 Cent called Handler to say that Ciara basically wanted him back and wasn’t happy that Handler was dating him. Handler became enraged and that was that.\n\n2. Dave Salmoni\n\nSalmoni is a Canadian animal trainer, entertainer and TV producer. Salmoni actually broke the news of their break up to the world on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno. After the break up, Handler joked about her relationship with Salmoni ending on her talk show Chelsea Lately saying:\n\nUp until a couple weeks ago, I was working very intimately with the Animal Planet, but unfortunately, that contract was terminated. However, I enjoyed being in bed with them and may hook up for an occasional project.\n\nThis relationship came just before Handler dated 50 Cent.\n\n3. David Alan Grier\n\nHandler has actually been romantically linked to David Alan Grier who’s quoted as saying, “I think Chelsea Handler is the funniest woman.” Grier is actually 20 years older than Handler, but the two are big comedians, so perhaps they had a bond through humor.\n\n4. Ted Harbert\n\nTed Harbert is actually the NBC Broadcasting chairman who was Handler’s boss for four years, but the two apparently couldn’t separate business from pleasure, so the relationship failed. Handler told Marie Claire:\n\nI would come home from work, and Ted would be like, ‘Do you want to watch your show?’ and I’d be like, ‘No, I just came from my show. That’s the last thing I’d want to do. That was the reason it didn’t work out, ultimately. I think.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter writes:\n\nHandler and Harbert began dating in 2006, the same year her first E! series, The Chelsea Handler Show, premiered. They moved in together months later, while he was serving as CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, overseeing E! and other cable channels.\n\n5. André Balazs\n\nHandler’s relationship with hotelier André Balazs came after her relationship with Harbert. In fact, it’s reported that she and Balazs had been on-again and off-again for years. The Huffington Post writes:\n\nHandler and Balazs broke up after a two-year bicoastal relationship. The two struggled through some tough times “trying to figure out how to live life together.” However, she never doubted her love for him, telling Oprah, “I met my match.”\n\nWhen talking about her relationship with Balazs while they were dating, Handler told Ellen DeGeneres:\n\nIt’s very rocky, but I love him. I’m trying to blossom into womanhood. You’ve been in a relationship for a long time, so you’re a little bit probably more mature."
