        "text": "Everyone is waiting for Jo Koy to “come out”, but will he? First things first – are the stories about his sexuality true? Koy has been in the entertainment industry for over two decades, and fans have seen him transition from an amateur to an expert. However, his sexuality has been scrutinised lately with rumours of being gay. So, is Jo Koy gay?\n\nSome news is sometimes so bizarre that it seems someone threw it out to see how it works. Imagine being labelled with a different sexuality online with accusations from every corner. It is a big test for famous personalities torn between staying silent or stating their stance.\n\nBut does talking make things better? As they say, actions speak louder than words; for Jo Koy, you can quickly tell his sexuality. So, where does the beloved comedian fall? What is Jo Koy's sexuality?\n\nJo Koy’s profile summary\n\nNameJoseph Glenn HerbertAlso known as Jo KoyDate of birthJune 2, 1971Age52 years oldPlace of birthTacoma, Washington, the United States of AmericaEducationThe University of Nevada, Las Vegas (dropped out)ProfessionStand-up comedian, actorYears active1989 – present GenresObservational comedy, black comedy, insult comedy, surreal humour, satireSubjectsAsian American culture, everyday life, pop culture, current events, gender differences, human behaviour, human sexualitySpouseAngie King \"Nura Luca\" (divorced in 2013)ChildrenJoseph Glenn Herbert Jr.\n\nWho is Jo Koy?\n\nHave you watched E!’s late-night show Chelsea Lately? Joy Koy was a frequent panellist on the show. His sentiments were always great to look forward to. However, that is different from how he gained the limelight.\n\nJoseph Glenn Herbert Sr., known professionally as Jo Koy, is a renowned American stand-up comedian and actor. He has been active in the entertainment industry since 1989 and has incredible works in various genres in his niche.\n\nJo Koy was born to a white father stationed in the United States Air Force in the Philippines. He grew up in Tacoma, Washington, but moved to Las Vegas after completing his high school education.\n\nInterestingly, Jo's stage name comes from a nickname he was given by his family while growing up. His aunt once called him to go to dinner, shouting, \"Jo Ko, eat!\" and the name stuck.\n\nJo Koy has had massive success as a comedian, making his big debut in 1994 at a comedy club in Las Vegas. Since then, Jo has performed in numerous shows and appeared in TV series.\n\nIs Jo Koy gay?\n\nJo has been straight his entire life. There is no substantive evidence to prove that he is gay, including his coming out to state. On top of that, Jo has had various public relationships with women and has even been married. So, where did the gay rumours come from?\n\nWhile on Chelsea Handler’s late-night show, she made fun of Jo, stating he was gay. Immediately, people started to wonder whether it could be true. It appears that it was just a joke at the spur of the moment. Jo has even dated Chelsea, who joked about him being gay.\n\nWhat happened with Jo Koy and Chelsea Handler?\n\nJo Koy and Chelsea Handler started officially dating in August 2021. They first met through a mutual friend (Jon Lovitz), and their friendship gradually became a romance. Jo and Chelsea made their relationship public in September and shared numerous lovely memories.\n\nHowever, in July 2022, almost a year after they started their new life together, Jo Koy and Chelsea ended the relationship because they disagreed. Handler announced the sad news.\n\nIn anticipation of celebrating our first year together, Jo and I recorded this video early, but as many of you have noticed, it is with a heavy heart that we have decided to take a break from our relationship right now...\n\nChelsea opened up the primary reason for their break up in a podcast with Brooke Shields, Now What.\n\nI won't change how I act to make you feel better. I won't do that, and I had to leave a relationship I thought would last forever. So that was hard.\n\nDespite their breaking up, Jo Koy and Chelsea are still good friends and often talk about each other lives from time to time.\n\nDoes Jo Koy have a wife?\n\nJo Koy was married to Filipino-American singer Angie King. They fell in love in the mid-1990s and married in Nevada in February 2003. However, as the years progressed, the couple grew distant, and they decided to separate on the tenth anniversary of their wedding in 2013.\n\nDoes Jo Koy have children?\n\nJo Koy and his ex-wife, Angie, had their first child, Joseph Glenn Herbert Jr., on April 21, 2003. Despite his divorce, Jo Koy loves his son immensely and is close to him. He takes him to many of his shows and even makes fun of him.\n\nWho is Jo Koy dating?\n\nWho is Jo Koy's partner right now? Since breaking up with Chelsea Handler, Jo Koy has not publicised any of his relationships, if he has had one.\n\nWrapping up\n\nThe question, “Is Jo Koy gay?” is quite bizarre as the comedian has never been inclined to the sexuality status. He has dated various people over the years, the most recent being Chelsea Handler. He is not in any public relationship at the moment.\n\nSo much has been going on in Will Smith’s life over the past few years, and people have started speculating whether he is gay. Tuko.co.ke featured an exciting piece trying to demystify the idea.\n\nLooking at the actor’s dating history, it is hardly plausible. However, there is more to one's story than meets the eye. Find out more about the famous actor’s sexuality.\n\nSource: TUKO.co.ke"
