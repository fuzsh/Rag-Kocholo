        "text": "Martha Stewart has no intention of breaking up anybody's marriage, but that doesn't mean she isn't willing to bide her time until she can swoop in and date a widower.\n\nOn the latest episode of Chelsea Handler's podcast Dear Chelsea, the home and garden expert confessed that there's currently “nothing” going on with her love life, although she has had a couple of crushes recently. Unfortunately, those were all on married men. Stewart explained, “I had two mad crushes in the last month, which is really good for me, but turns out one of them is married to the mother of some friends of mine,” she added, “He's so attractive.” Handler exclaimed, “You can't be a homewrecker!” But the TV personality assured her, “I've never been a homewrecker and I've tried really hard not to be. I've had the opportunity to be a homewrecker and I have not taken anybody up on it.”\n\nThe main problem right now when it comes to romantic relationships is Stewart says the only way she meets any new men is, “They're all married to friends of mine, or something like that.” Handler was sympathetic to that problem, saying, “I think there are certain ages we go through where it's very tempting because you want to believe that, 'Oh, maybe this relationship that they're in is temporary.'” To which Stewart quipped, “Or maybe they'll die. I always think, 'Oh gosh, couldn't that person just die?' Not painfully, just die.”\n\nBack in April 2021, the business mogul also spoke candidly about her dating life on The Ellen Show, revealing that after posting that iconic poolside thirst trap she received “so many proposals and so many propositions” from some high-profile single gentlemen in her DMs. However, she said no dates ever came from those messages as she “had to ignore all of them. I'm a very busy person.”"
