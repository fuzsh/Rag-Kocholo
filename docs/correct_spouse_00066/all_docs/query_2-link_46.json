        "text": "Jo Koy has only good things to say about his ex Chelsea Handler.\n\n“She’s a beautiful person, and, you know, we’re still friends,” the “Easter Sunday” star told Page Six exclusively at the Broadway opening of “Here Lies Love” Thursday night.\n\n“It was a beautiful time,” he continued of their nearly year-long relationship, “and she’s doing beautiful things right now. She’s crushing it right now, so I have nothing but the best love for her.”\n\nThe pair were longtime friends before they began dating in the summer of 2021.\n\nThey broke up in July 2022, with Handler announcing their plan to “take a break from” their romance.\n\nLast December, the former “Chelsea Lately” host, 48, confessed that she had not spoken to Koy, 52, for “a while” and could not resume their friendship unless he took “accountability” for their demise as a couple.\n\n“I mean, there has to be some accountability, you know what I mean? Like, from him about what happened, because it was just ridiculous,” she said on Brooke Shields’ “Now What?” podcast.\n\nWhile she declined to explain what Koy did wrong, Handler explained that their relationship had “devolved” over the 11 months they were together.\n\n“There was just some behaviors that we couldn’t agree on,” she shared. “And it felt to me like I would have to abandon myself, which maybe I would have been OK to do if I were 20 or 25. But I wasn’t willing to do that.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“I had to walk away from something that I really thought was going to be a forever relationship,” Handler added before noting it became clear that Koy was not her person.\n\n“Walking away from him was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do.”\n\nKoy was on hand at the David Byrne/Slimboy Fat musical as one of its producers.\n\nThe show is based on the life of the Philippines’ former first lady Imelda Marcos and the 1986 People Power Revolution that overthrew her and her husband, President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nThe comedian, whose mother is Filipino, remembers living in the Philippines as a child under the corrupt Marcos regime.\n\n“When I was a kid, I lived there, and I remember those times,” he told us. “So, you know, it was just a memory in my head, and now here we are on Broadway telling a story, a story that my mom’s family went through, and now we get to do it in a beautiful way.”\n\nKoy, who came with his 20-year-old son, Joseph, was joined by other celebs including Spike Lee, who brought his two kids, “Insecure” star Natasha Rothwell and Daniel Dae Kim.\n\n“Here Lies Love” is the first Broadway musical to feature an all-Filipino cast."
