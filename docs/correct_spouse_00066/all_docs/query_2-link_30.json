Handler recently spoke about the status of their friendship post split.\n\nWhile appearing on Brooke Shields’ Now What? podcast, Chelsea explained where Jo and her stand currently after their split. Speaking about the same, she said, \"I mean, there has to be some accountability, you know what I mean? Like, from him about what happened, because it was just ridiculous. I don’t think we can have a friendship.\"\n\nWhile fans were left heartbroken after hearing about Handler and Koy's split, the comedian has now revealed details about what led to their relationship breakdown. Speaking on Brooke Shields' podcast, she detailed the reason why their relationship devolved within eleven months of dating and said, \"There was just some behaviours that we couldn’t agree on. And it felt to me like I would have to abandon myself, which maybe I would have been OK to do if I were 20 or 25. But I wasn’t willing to do that.\" She further added, \"I was like, ‘I’m not going to change the way that I behave in order to make you feel more comfortable. I’m not doing that.\" Chelsea also admitted that she considered it to be a \"forever relationship.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did Chelsea Handler and Jo Koy meet?\n\nThe duo were reportedly introduced by Lovitz and the comedians worked together frequently between 2007 and 2014 on Handler's late-night show Chelsea Lately.

And how much I now believe in love for each one of us.\" Handler also noted that it wasn't the end for them at the time and wrote, \"This is not an ending. It’s another beginning, and it’s a comfort to know that I am still loved and love this man the way the sun loves the moon and the moon loves the sun. YOUR PERSON IS COMING.
