        "text": "A few weeks ago I opened up one of my dating apps and saw before me a man of my same name.\n\nI am inclined to swipe right on men who have the same name as me even if I don’t find them particularly interesting or attractive. Why? You ask? Why not? I deflect. I opened the only logical way I could think of:\n\n“Is your middle name Alyson, too?”\n\n“hahahahahahhahahhahahhahaha!” He’d say. “You’re funny! I love you.” We (Jamie, the myriad sports teams T-shirts he owns according to his profile photos and I) would stop swiping and start charming the pants off of people at dinner parties. “Those Jamies,” people would say. “They’re so clever and have such great senses of humor and senses of style ever since he got rid of all those stupid T-shirts.”\n\nThe next time I logged into my account, the message was gone."
