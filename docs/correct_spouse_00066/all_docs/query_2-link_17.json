        "text": "After being friends for decades, Chelsea Handler and Jo Koy confirmed their relationship in September 2021. Prior to Koy, Handler didn't have the most optimistic outlook on love â€” often relishing in being single (via Women's Health). But reflecting on her current relationship, Handler feels as though her audience may be apprehensive about finding love themselves. \"People hear me talk about how Jo's renewed my faith in men,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter, \"and they must think, 'Oh my God, if Chelsea Handler's in love and all soft and mushy, it could happen to anyone.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only that, but Handler's stance on marriage has also somewhat changed since she and Koy became an item. \"I don't know that I'm the marrying kind,\" she told NBC's Today. \"I feel like, who knows, I doubt it, but usually when I say I'm not going to do something, I end up doing it like the next weekend, so I'm not going to say that anymore.\"\n\nChelsea Handler's mindset now is a far cry from what it used to be. Speaking to Gwyneth Paltrow during an episode of Live Talks Los Angeles in 2014 (via Women's Health), the comedian shared her uncertainty about marriage. \"I don't know if I'm the marrying kind,\" she said. \"Truth of the matter is, I don't really know how to balance a relationship and my life, I've never been able to really do that, I can't really handle both things.\" At the time, Handler wanted to focus on the things most important to her. \"I'm a better, happier human being when I can be really focused on my friends, my family, and my job,\" she noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a couple of years later, Handler's tune had changed somewhat. When filming her docuseries \"Chelsea Does,\" one of the topics she explored was marriage. By broaching the subject, she realized her opinion on the subject didn't feel right. \"I never understood why people would want to get married,\" she told People. \"To me, marriage always encompassed a huge wedding and a huge reception and a commitment lumped together.\"\n\nShe continued: \"But I realize now that you can be committed to someone without that commercialization and all that nonsense.\"\n\nDespite being more open to marriage than she was in 2014, Handler is still a little apprehensive about the prospect. When answering fan questions on Instagram in September 2021 (via Hollywood Mask), Handler was once again asked about marriage and potentially having children. \"I have never felt more confident and secure in my life decision-making skills, in remaining childless and alone, then I have during this pandemic,\" she wrote in response, referring to the year prior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it's not that Handler doesn't like kids, she's worried that she'll \"over-correct\" her parent's mistakes. \"I would be a nightmare mother,\" Handler told People. \"If my niece has a bad day at school, I worry about it for three days. I'd be such a helicopter parent. I'd drive my child crazy!\"\n\nDuring an appearance at Gwyneth Paltrow's \"In goop Health Summit\" in 2018 (via Well + Good), Handler highlighted the seriousness of becoming a mother. \"I just don't think it's the best use of my time. I'm just not interested,\" she explained. \"Becoming a mother is something that I take so seriously. People need to really want to become a mom. Honestly, it should be hard to become a parent.\""
