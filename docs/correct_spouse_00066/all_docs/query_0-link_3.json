        "text": "Chelsea Handler is setting the record straight on her threesome.\n\nFour months after the comedian told Andy Cohen that she and her ex-boyfriend Ted Harbert called it quits after hooking up with a female masseuse together, she clarified that they did not “break up because of” the ménage à trois.\n\n“I really want to clarify [that story],” she said on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” Thursday. “I want to go on the record that that is not why our relationship ended.”\n\nAfter Handler, 48, “double[d] down” on her and the TV executive having “a lot of threesomes” during their four-year relationship, she said she never “left him for the masseuse.”\n\nThe actress insisted, “That didn’t happen.”\n\nJimmy Fallon begged Handler to “stop” talking about Harbert since the 68-year-old had a “stern” response to her first NSFW reveal on SiriusXM’s “Andy Radio” in June.\n\nAccording to the “Chelsea Lately” alum, the businessman had texted her at the time to say, “That was not cool. Please don’t do that again. Some things are better left private.”\n\nHandler joked that he was “hopefully not” watching Thursday’s show — but did want to tell the audience that she’d given him “street cred” because “who knew he was having threesomes?”\n\nInitially, the former “Chelsea” host explained to Cohen that she “knew it was time to break up with” Harbert because she “ended up hooking up with her [masseuse] several times without” her partner.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“I was very turned on by this woman,” she said at the time, noting that she likes “another girl in the situation” because “she can do all the stuff that I’m too f–king lazy to do.”\n\nHandler, who dated Harbert from 2006 to 2010, added that while she has “slept with a woman,” she hasn’t been in a relationship with one.\n\nThe “Chelsea Does” star made headlines last month for seemingly debuting a new romance, her first splitting from Jo Koy — only to walk back the PDA pic.\n\n“I did not announce a new boyfriend on Instagram,” she told her followers in September. “That man is a bartender right next door to my house in Mallorca.”\n\nDuring her interview with Fallon, Handler clarified that the mystery man was not her “baby,” saying, “I love people who bring drinks to me.”"
