The series starred Chelsea Handler and featured skits that mocked the entertainment industry, spoofed celebrities, television, the elderly, and herself. The show aired Friday nights at 10:30 EST.\n\nThe mini-series was green lighted by E! in early 2006 and premiered on April 21, 2006. The cable channel ordered eight episodes of the half-hour project that features Handler, a Tonight Show correspondent and star of Oxygen's Girls Behaving Badly, in taped spoofs, film shorts and field remote pieces, all framed by stand-up segments of her performing before a studio audience.[1] Jay Blumenfield, Tony Marsh, and Mark Schulman served as the show's executive producers.[2]\n\nThe show originally ordered eight episodes which aired from April 21 to June 9 and was given an additional four episodes starting August 11 to create a 12-episode season.

She revealed a bit too much during a massage session with Gary Coleman and passed out while interviewing Mad TV's Michael McDonald.\"[3] Sun Sentinel comedy columnist Jeff Rusnak called the show \"wickedly uninhibited\", writing, \"Better suited for HBO than basic cable, last week's episode included Handler baring a breast in one skit and later running over a stuffed dog and a baby doll during a driving competition with an octogenarian and a blind man.\"[4]\n\nChelsea Handler began hosting the late-night comedy show, Chelsea Lately on July 16, 2007, also on E!."
