        "text": "Hours before comedian and late-night talk show host Chelsea Handler was set to appear on CNN’s Piers Morgan Tonight, news broke about Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher‘s split — and Handler didn’t hold back.\n\n“Well, I think it’s pretty obvious to everybody,” Handler said after Morgan alluded to the fact that the the breakup was due to “Ashton’s bad behavior.” “Again, I don’t know them personally very well, but I think it’s pretty obvious that they probably had a lot of open marriage-type situations.”\n\nPHOTOS: The Evolution of Chelsea Handler\n\n“You think so?,” Morgan asked.\n\n“Well, yeah. I think they probably had a lot of good times with some other women,” she said. Morgan seemed slightly shocked at her claim, asking again, “Really?” “Yea of course. I mean, read between the lines,” Handler responded.\n\nShe continued: “They probably had a lot of threesomes that led to twosomes without Demi and that leads to a divorce.”\n\nMorgan then showed a clip from when Kutcher and Moore appeared on his show just five to six months ago.\n\nCOVER STORY: The Split Personality of Chelsea Handler\n\n“I think you have to make your relationship a priority,” Moore said at the time, “and that’s a difficult balance when you have work and the combination of career and family. A big part of it is we spend very little time apart. That’s one of the key things.”\n\nKutcher then chimed in: “I’d also say working on the relationship when the relationship’s good. I think most people set getting married as the goal as opposed to being married.”\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood’s Twitter Feuds\n\nMorgan noted that he thought they seemed “very much in love” at the time.\n\n“I absolutely feel for her,” Handler, who recently inked a new two-year deal with E! to remain on Chelsea Lately, said of Moore. “I think a lot of people make big mistake a lot of times in marriage in thinking that there are — I’m a big proponent of valor and honor and valuing what you have in a relationship or someone else and being true to that and to yourself at the same time.”\n\nWhen Morgan asked about infidelity, Handler said adamantly that she “would not tolerate that.” “I’m not interested in that,” she said. “Strength is exciting to me, someone who can be powerful and overcome little weaknesses.”\n\nHandler, who has never been married, has dated 50 Cent, Ted Harbert and Dave Salmoni.\n\nWatch the interview below:"
