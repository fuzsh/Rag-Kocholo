        "text": "He has perhaps the most aspirational former relationship we’ve ever heard of and it’s just so sweet to hear about Jo Koy’s ex-wife, whom he regards as his best friend. They share one child and his most public romance was with a fellow comedian. Read on for all the details about Jo Koy’s dating life.\n\nBorn Joseph Glenn Herbert, the Filipino-American comedian started out self-funding his own comedy shows in Las Vegas, Nevada. After a disastrous comedy start and humble beginnings, Koy appeared on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno and started to make regular appearances on Chelsea Handler’s show Chelsea Lately!\n\nIn 2017, he released his first Netflix stand-up special Live From Seattle. Though he’s had a lucrative deal and three more specials with the streaming service, he talked about how it was a struggle at first to Salon. “I literally had to go, and shoot it myself, and pay it with my money, and edit it myself, and then hand it to them after they already said no to me. Not only was it like that, but I put the cameras in the theater to shoot it. Two days before we shot it, Netflix calls my manager, and goes, “Hey, we found out Jo’s shooting that special. We really want you to know we don’t want it.” It was that kind of pressure. All my money in, all of it. And the only place I want to sell it is to Netflix, and they reconfirmed, “We don’t want it.” And so, we still shot it, and they ended up buying it.”\n\nJo Koy has also made his lead feature film debut in Easter Sunday with an ensemble of Filipino-American actors and is inspired by his own experiences in the stand-up community and within his own Filipino upbringing. He has also appeared in Haunted Mansion and voiced the character Bendo in Netflix’s animated film Monkey King. He’s set to voice The Monkey King in the animated feature film, Tiger’s Apprentice premiering on Paramount+ on February 2, 2024.\n\nJo Koy was announced as the 2024 Golden Globes host—marking his first time hosting the awards show ceremony. “I’ve stepped onto a lot of stages around the world in my career, but this one is going to be extra special. I’m so excited to be hosting the Golden Globes this year,” said Koy in a press release. “This is that moment where I get to make my Filipino family proud. Mahal Kita (Google it)!”\n\nJo Koy’s ex-wife"
