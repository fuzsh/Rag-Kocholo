Did I say something?’ And then I Googled myself.”\n\nBut the former ‘Chelsea Lately’ host insisted she had no regrets about the revelation and claimed it had been good for her former partner’s image.\n\nShe laughed: “So many people came up to me and they were like, ‘Wow, that gave Ted Harbert a lot of street cred. Who knew he was having threesomes?’\n\n”I love you [Ted], if you’re watching. Hopefully not.”\n\nDespite her previous comments, Chelsea wanted to “clarify” that she didn’t leave Ted to start a relationship with their masseuse.\n\nShe said: “I really want to clarify. I want to go on the record that that is not why our relationship ended.\n\n”We did have a lot of threesomes‚ and that, while that’s private, it’s already out there, so I’m gonna double down on that and just say that we didn’t break up because I left him for the masseuse. That didn’t happen.”\n\nChelsea had made her original comments while speaking to Andy Cohen on SiriusXM.\n\nShe said: “I’ve slept with a woman but I haven’t dated a woman, no. It was like a threesome. It was fun. I would [do that again], for sure.\n\n”I was very turned on by this woman. I ended up hooking up with her several times without the guy that I was dating. That’s when I knew it was time to break up with the guy.\n\n”I don’t think I ever revealed that [to Ted], but I mean, hopefully, he’s listening now. His name is Ted Harbert. He’s in Portugal though. He might not have access to this ... he and his wife are building a house in Portugal.”"
