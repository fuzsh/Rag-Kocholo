        "text": "Chelsea Handler is still on the market.\n\nThe comedian, 48, set the record straight on her relationship status after fans, and news outlets alike, mistook a bartender in Mallorca for her new boyfriend.\n\n“My publicists are calling me … I did not announce a new boyfriend on Instagram,” she said on her Instagram Story Thursday after returning to the States from her European vacation.\n\n“That man is a bartender right next door to my house in Mallorca and that’s why he’s my baby,” Handler went on.\n\n“Baby doesn’t mean boyfriend. Baby means he is my baby because he made me so many drinks. I can’t believe I have to clarify things like this.”\n\nIt came one day after she shared a snap of herself kissing a mystery man on the cheek, while he wrapped his arms around her in a bear hug.\n\n“This is my baby. He is full of love and positivity and his body is my wonderland,” she captioned the photo, referencing John Mayer’s 2001 hit “Your Body Is a Wonderland.”\n\n“I love my baby and now I go back to work,” the “Chelsea Lately” alum added, noting that she’s set to perform at New York’s Beacon Theatre this weekend.\n\nThe “Life Will Be the Death of Me: …and You Too!” author split from her most recent beau, fellow comedian Jo Koy, in July 2022.\n\nThe pair were longtime pals before they began dating in the summer of 2021.\n\n“In anticipation of celebrating our first year together, Jo and I recorded this video early, but as many of you have noticed, it is with a heavy heart to announce that we have decided together that it is best for us to take a break from our relationship right now,” Handler captioned an Instagram post at the time.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“This man blew my heart open with love and because of him, my life experience has changed forever. To be loved and adored by @jokoy has been one of the greatest gifts of my life,” Handler continued.\n\nA few months later, she revealed that she hadn’t spoken to Koy, 52, for “a while” and had no plans to continue their friendship unless he took “accountability” for their demise as a couple.\n\n“I mean, there has to be some accountability, you know what I mean? Like, from him about what happened, because it was just ridiculous,” she said on Brooke Shields’ “Now What?” podcast last December.\n\nHandler told the actress that her relationship with the funnyman had “devolved” over the 11 months they were dating.\n\n“There was just some behaviors that we couldn’t agree on,” she explained.\n\n“And it felt to me like I would have to abandon myself, which maybe I would have been OK to do if I were 20 or 25. But I wasn’t willing to do that,” she went on.\n\n“I had to walk away from something that I really thought was going to be a forever relationship … Walking away from him was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do.”\n\nThe “This Means War” star was previously linked to rapper 50 Cent, businessman André Balazs and chef Bobby Flay."
