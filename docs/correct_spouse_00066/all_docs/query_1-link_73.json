        "text": "\"Jo Koy at Dodger game in LA!\" the witness told Deuxmoi. \"Saw Chelsea Handler on the big screen and obvi googled the two of them. Then saw him kiss a blonde next to him (she is masked so it's hard to tell).\"\n\nKoy also threw the evening's first pitch while his alleged leading lady watched on in support.\n\nThe 50-year-old stand-up comic shared a selfie showing an unmasked Handler cuddling up to him. Both were seen smiling in the very couple-esque shot. He didn't provide any commentary but did tag her; however, she didn't repost.\n\nAnd if all that were not enough to convince you, Jo has also been featured heavily in Chelsea's TikTok videos lately.\n\nWe suppose friends with benefits is a possibility, too? RadarOnline.com has reached out to reps for each for comment.\n\nThis past April, Koy revealed that he had initially turned down working with Handler on Chelsea Lately because he \"didn't want to be known as the sidekick. I knew if I took that on, I would be known as Chelsea Handler's guy on the side. I didn't want to be Andy Richter or Ed McMahon. I wanted to be Jo Koy.\"\n\n\"She cursed me out so hard on the phone,\" he explained. \"Every curse word you could possibly think of, telling me it's the stupidest decision. And I get it. She was offended. She knew that this thing was going to be a hit and here I am pulling away as if I don't believe it or something.\""
