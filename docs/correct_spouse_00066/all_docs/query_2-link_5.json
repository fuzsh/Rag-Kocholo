        "text": "Chelsea Handler is outspoken about all areas of her life — and her romantic relationships are no exception. The comedian frequently gets real about her penchant for weed and the luxury of living a child-free life. Handler has also been open about her sex life, telling Andy Cohen in June 2023 that a threesome with a masseuse led to her split from ex-boyfriend Ted Harbert. \"I was very turned on by this woman,” she recalled on Radio Andy 13 years after her split from Harbert. “I ended up hooking up with her several times without the guy that I was dating. That's when I knew it was time to break up with the guy.\" In 2021, the former Chelsea Lately host revealed that marriage might not be in the cards for her, despite high-profile romances with fellow comedian Jo Koy and 50 Cent. “I don't know that I'm the marrying kind,\" she told NBC at the time before teasing that she might change her mind down the road. \"I feel like, who knows, I doubt it, but usually when I say I'm not going to do something, I end up doing it like the next weekend, so I'm not going to say that anymore.\" Keep scrolling to see Handler’s love life throughout the years:\n\nCredit: Stephen Shugerman/Getty Images for HRTS\n\nTed Harbert\n\nHandler dated Harbert for four years before the two split in 2010. While she told Cohen that her attraction to their threesome partner played a role in their breakup, she shared with Marie Claire in 2012 that their jobs also factored into the split. (Harbert was president of E! Entertainment when Chelsea Lately was on the air.)\n\n“I would come home from work, and Ted would be like, ‘Do you want to watch your show?’ and I’d be like, ‘No, I just came from my show. That’s the last thing I’d want to do.’ That was the reason it didn’t work out, ultimately. I think,” she explained at the time.\n\nCredit: Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for Haute Living\n\n50 Cent\n\nHandler briefly dated the rapper in 2011. “I don’t know if I can handle him, to be honest. I like to have fun, and I’m really trying to not get into anything too serious,” she exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.\n\nTwelve years later, she named 50 Cent as her “favorite ex.”\n\n“I love 50 Cent, he was fun. He was just a sweetheart and he was fun to be around,” she told Entertainment Tonight in January 2023. “My friends loved hanging out with him. I loved hanging out with him. It was a pretty short-lived romance, it was only two months. But yeah, I mean, If I saw him I’d definitely have a drink with him.”\n\nCredit: Dave Benett/Getty Images\n\nAndre Balazs\n\nHandler described her brief relationship with the businessman — whom she dated for roughly a year between 2011 and 2012 — as draining.\n\n“It was extremely time consuming and it was really, really hard for me to focus on anything at all,” Handler, shared on Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast in 2012. “He lived in New York and I lived in L.A., and it was a constant back and forth, flying and meeting each other … it was just exhausting. But I prefer a long distance relationship because I don’t really want to deal with someone on a daily basis.”\n\nStill, the romance “kind of took the wind out of me … it drained me from my career, it drained me from my work,” she added. “I wasn’t focused on anything. It was just stress.”\n\nCredit: Andrew J Cunningham/Getty Images\n\nJo Koy\n\nWhen Handler finally got together with Koy in 2012 — after 20 years of friendship — even she thought she found The One.\n\n“For everyone who is still looking for their person, do not adjust who you are or make yourself smaller to find them. Be patient and never settle for anything less than you deserve,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “Your person is coming and sometimes — they’ve been standing in front of you the whole time.” After many Instagram selfies — and declarations of love on both sides — the duo ultimately called it quits in July 2022.\n\n“There were just some behaviors that we couldn't agree on, and it felt to me like I would have to abandon myself — which maybe I would have been OK to do if I were 20 or 25 — but I wasn't willing to do that,\" Handler later explained to Brooke Shields. \"No matter how much I loved this person, and I loved him so much, I was not going to abandon myself. I was like, 'I'm not going to change this, I'm not going to change the way that I behave in order to make you feel more comfortable. I'm not doing that.' And I had to walk away from something that I really believed was gonna be a forever relationship, and so that was difficult.\""
