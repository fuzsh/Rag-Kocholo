        "text": "Yesterday I was working out at the gym (LIKE I DO), and caught some of Piers Morgan Live. Chelsea Handler was on, talking–or refusing to talk–about her love life, which is odd, because it seemed like it would be a legitimate conversation topic for her? But I guess it was over the line, and she told Piers Morgan that she didn’t know if she had been in love before, accused him of having asked her that question in another interview, told him that she’d have to sleep on it, and she knew he didn’t have that kind of time. (Burn?)\n\n“Ugh, I hate Chelsea Lately,” I texted a friend, because I was momentarily confused by the name of her show vs. her real name. (HOW INTO THIS STORY ARE YOU?) “She and Piers Morgan are pretending to spar. I’m sorry, but shoot me if I am that cynical at 39.”\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

Thinking I was onto something, I then went on my Twitter app and wrote:\n\nIn fairness, I probably should have watched the rest of the interview. Because it got kind of rough riders after that.\n\n[protected-iframe id=”2cdbe27c5814a15f46bec6196536cae6-35584880-35147716″ info=”http://www.mrctv.org/embed/125909″ width=”640″ height=”360″ frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen=””]\n\nThe thing is, since I didn’t see the rest of the segment, I really didn’t understand how funny Piers Morgan’s response was until today.\n\nPoint, set, match: Piers Morgan. And I’m not just saying that because I have 30 new Twitter followers, but thanks for that, too."
