Howard thought her status as the boss’s girlfriend couldn’t have sat well with the staff.\n\n“Everyone was against you, I imagine,” Howard said to Chelsea.\n\n“Everyone but Ted,” Chelsea told Howard before sharing what Harbert was like while they were dating. “He’s kind of like that kid in school who yells out the answer before anyone raises their hand. He’s a nerdy guy … I thought he was very smart. He knew a lot about TV. And then I moved in and was like, ‘Oh my god, I’m gonna kill this guy.'”\n\nChelsea said she broke things off with Ted while she was in the middle of a detox. “He was like, ‘Chelsea, you haven’t been drinking for two weeks. You’re not thinking clearly,'” she recalled."
