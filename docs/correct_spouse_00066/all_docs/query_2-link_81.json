And I believe, now more than ever before, that my person is coming,\" she said.\n\nI'm soaking up these love tidbits, but I have to acknowledge this was a slight change from the grim outlook during her appearance on iHeartMedia's Now What? with Brook Shields podcast.\n\nWhile discussing her breakup with Jo, she said, \"Walking away from him was one of the most difficult things I ever had to do,\" but there were behaviors she wasn't willing to \"abandon\" for the sake of the relationship.\n\n\"I don't think we can have a friendship until there's some accountability and some responsibility taken.\"\n\nI love a good hindsight journey. Today, Chelsea remains hopeful for the future, and her growth is inspiring.\n\nGood luck on good love, Chelsea!\n\nShare This Article"
