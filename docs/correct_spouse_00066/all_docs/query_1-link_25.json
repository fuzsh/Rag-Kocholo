        "text": "Chelsea Handler is opening up about the demise of her four-year relationship with Ted Harbert.\n\nJoining Andy Cohen on his SiriusXM show on Wednesday, June 7, the comedian spilled the tea on her dating history, including how a threesome with a woman and the former NBC Broadcasting chairman, who was president of E! Entertainment when the comedian's late-night show, The Chelsea Handler Show, premiered in 2006, led to their breakup.\n\nWhen asked if she had ever dated a woman, Handler said she never did — but she had \"slept\" with one. \"It was like a threesome.\"\n\nBefore recalling how it went down, the 48-year-old said it was \"fun\" and that she \"would for sure\" do it again should the opportunity present itself.\n\n\"I was very turned on by this woman. I ended up hooking up with her several times without the guy that I was dating,\" Handler then revealed of the threesome in question. \"That's when I knew it was time to break up with the guy.\"\n\nShe also confessed that she never told Harbert about her romps with the masseuse sans him there. \"I don't think I ever revealed that, but I mean, hopefully, he's listening now,\" Handler quipped. \"His name is Ted Harbert. He's in Portugal though. He might not have access to this ... he and his wife are building a house in Portugal.\"\n\nHandler got real about what led to their split years after she said during a 2012 interview with Marie Claire that they broke up because Harbert — whom she moved in with only months after they began dating — couldn't keep business separate from their relationship.\n\n\"I would come home from work, and Ted would be like, 'Do you want to watch your show?' and I’d be like, 'No, I just came from my show. That's the last thing I’d want to do,'\" Handler said at the time. \"That was the reason it didn’t work out, ultimately. I think.\""
