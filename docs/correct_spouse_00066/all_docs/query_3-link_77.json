        "text": "_\n\nSophia Bush's split from her husband of 13 months is still fresh, but she's already moved on … and she's dating a woman! Reports claim the \"One Tree Hill\" actress is coupled up with U.S. Women's National Team soccer stud Ashlyn Harris. The timing of the relationship is raising some eyebrows, as it comes in the immediate aftermath of both of their marriages collapsing. Ashlyn filed for divorce from fellow USWNT star Ali Krieger less than a month ago, saying the marriage was \"irretrievably broken,\" while Sophia split with husband Grant Hughes in August.\n\nPage Six claimed the pair first got romantic while in the South of France at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in June.\n\nKeep clicking for all the details on the surprising new romance…\n\nMORE: Follow Wonderwall on MSN for more fun celebrity & entertainment photo galleries and content\n\n_\n\nAshlyn Harris and Sophia Bush's romance has been clandestine.\n\nPage Six said the two recently went on a \"cozy\" double date with \"What Not to Wear\" cohost Stacy London and her girlfriend, Cat Yezbak.\n\n\"Ashlyn snuck into the theater wearing a mask to join Stacy, Cat and Sophia. It wasn't clear they were on a double date until Stacy moved over so Ashlyn could sit next to Sophia,\" the source said. \"When the lights dimmed for the opening act, Ashlyn removed her mask.\"\n\nThe women exhibited no PDA, but \"it was clear that Ashlyn and Sophia were cozy together,\" they added.\n\nOn Sept. 29, they also attended Chelsea Handler's show in New York City.\n\nThe two woman have actually been photographed together on a regular basis. For example, here they're seen with tennis commentator Rennae Stubbs in September.\n\n_\n\nSophia Bush's soon-to-be ex-husband, Grant Hughes, has no ill will toward the actress and is already signing off on the new romance.\n\nA rep for the Grant says he \"will always want the best for Sophia, and is supportive of all that makes her happy and fulfilled.\"\n\nOver the summer — and before their split — the \"Chicago P.D\" actress gushed about her husband on Instagram while sharing an image of their wedding day.\n\n\"Today marks 365 days of calling you 'husband,'\" she wrote. \"Best decision of my life. It still feels just like this. Ecstatic. Running toward the future, grinning and laughing, together. I love you, my favorite. Happy Anniversary.\""
