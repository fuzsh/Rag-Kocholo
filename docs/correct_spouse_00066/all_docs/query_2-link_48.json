        "text": "Chelsea Handler took a subtle jab at her ex-boyfriend Jo Koy on Sunday at the Critics’ Choice Awards after he received not-so-flattering criticism for his Golden Globes monologue.\n\n“Unfortunately, Martin Scorsese isn’t here tonight, but that’s not going to stop me from letting everyone in this room know that I would toss him around like a little Italian meatball,” Handler, 48, joked in her monologue.\n\n“Thank you for laughing at that. My writers wrote it,” she added.\n\nThe Post has contacted reps for Koy, 52, for comment.\n\nHandler’s joke comes one week after Koy bombed his Golden Globes monologue, even throwing the show’s writers under the bus.\n\n“Some [jokes] I wrote, some other people wrote. Yes, I got the gig 10 days ago! You want a perfect monologue? Yo, shut up. You’re kidding me, right?” he said.\n\n“Slow down, I wrote some of these and they are the ones you are laughing at,” he claimed.\n\nKoy clarified his remarks Thursday in a Los Angeles Times interview, admitting that calling the writers out in a time of anguish was a “rookie move.”\n\nHandler’s monologue was delivered to much laughter, while Koy’s was met with groans and no emotion from the A-list audience, especially the “Barbie” cast and crew.\n\n“‘Oppenheimer’ is based on a 721-page Pulitzer Prize-winning book about the Manhattan Project, and ‘Barbie’ is on a plastic doll with big boobies,” he said.\n\nKoy also seemingly upset Taylor Swift when he said, “The big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? At the Golden Globes, we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift.”\n\nThe “Karma” singer, 34, slowly took a sip of her alcoholic beverage while staring down the comedian.\n\nFor their part, Handler and Koy had known each other for nearly 20 years before they started dating in the summer of 2021.\n\nKoy frequently appeared as a guest on Handler’s E! late-night show “Chelsea Lately,” which ran from 2007 to 2014.\n\n“One day, I just looked at him and I thought, ‘Oh, that’s my guy!’” Handler told Jimmy Fallon in October 2021. “So, he’s like my best buddy, and then I also, you know, get to have sex with him. … Fun time!”\n\n“I love her, man,” Koy told “Good Morning Washington” around the same time. “Nothing better than to be in love with someone that you have been friends with for a long time. She’s got my back, and I’ve always had hers.”\n\nHe added, “It just feels good to finally find love and it’s with a person I’ve loved for a long time.”\n\nBut Handler would sadlyannounce their split in July 2022, writing in a statement to fans, “It is with a heavy heart to announce that we have decided together that it is best for us to take a break from our relationship right now.”\n\n“I know many of you were invested in our love, and I wanted to express to you how much that meant to both of us. How much it still means. And how much I now believe in love for each of us,” she added.\n\nShe continued of Koy, “You blew my creativity open, my lust for working hard again, being on the road again, and you reminded me who I was and always have been, and my feet have never been more firmly planted on the ground. This is not an ending but another beginning. It is a comfort to know that I am still in love and love this man the way the sun loves the moon and the moon loves the sun.”\n\nIn August, Koy told “Entertainment Tonight” that the pair were “great friends and that’s how it will always be,” but on Brooke Shields’ “Now What?” podcast in December, Handler revealed they hadn’t spoken in a while.\n\n“There has to be some accountability … from him about what happened because it was just ridiculous, and I don’t think we can have a friendship until there’s some accountability and some responsibility taken,” she said.\n\n“We had a really great friendship, and I would love to have that again, but without a couple steps in the right direction, I don’t see that happening,” Handler admitted.\n\nIn July 2023, Koy gave Page Six an update on where the couple stood one year after their breakup.\n\n“She’s a beautiful person, and, you know, we’re still friends,” he said. “It was a beautiful time and she’s doing beautiful things right now. She’s crushing it right now, so I have nothing but the best love for her.”"
