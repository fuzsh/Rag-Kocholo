I ended up hooking up with her several times without the guy that I was dating,\" Chelsea admitted.\n\nShe continued, \"That's when I knew it was time to break up with the guy.\"\n\nIn the end, Chelsea revealed that the man she was dating at the time was former E! Entertainment exec Ted Harbert — and she never told him the real reason for their relationship's end.\n\n\"I don't think I ever revealed that, but I mean, hopefully, he's listening now. His name is Ted Harbert,\" Chelsea said.\n\nAt the time, Chelsea told Marie Claire that the pair broke up because he couldn't keep work separate from their relationship — which ended up not being the full truth.\n\nWhile Ted may not have known about Chelsea's hookup with their masseuse, it sounds like he's doing okay because she noted that he's now living in Portugal with his wife.\n\nAnd even though the threesome led to the end of her relationship, Chelsea says she would definitely do it again.\n\n\"Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean I don't want to get double teamed by a guy, but I like another girl in this situation,\" she said. \"You know she can do all the stuff I'm too lazy to do.\"\n\nYou can hear all that Chelsea had to say below.\n\nShare This Article"
