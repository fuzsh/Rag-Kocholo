        "text": "&#151; -- Chelsea Handler is changing her tune about marriage.\n\nThe former talk host, 40, explored the topic of marriage, for her new four-episode Netflix documentary series, \"Chelsea Does.\"\n\n\"I never understood why people would want to get married. To me, marriage always encompassed a huge wedding and a huge reception and a commitment lumped together. But I realize now that you can be committed to someone without that commercialization and all that nonsense,\" Handler told People in a new interview. \"So now I'd get married.\"\n\nNot that she has any prospects.\n\n\"Now that I'm single and have no viable options,\" Handler said with a laugh.\n\nWhile open to the possibility of settling down, Handler doesn't see becoming a mom in her future.\n\n\"I'd have to over-correct so much from my parents that I would be a nightmare mother,\" she quipped.\n\n\"If my niece has a bad day at school, I worry about it for three days,\" she explained. \"I'd be such a helicopter parent. I'd drive my child crazy!\""
