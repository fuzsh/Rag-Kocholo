        "text": "Leonardo DiCaprio has never been married, but the public still seems to have a pretty good pulse on his dating life (or so we think). DiCaprio is usually linked to someone, often a much younger model. We won’t insert a joke about Leo’s dating life. They’ve all been said already.\n\nThe Help and Mom star Allison Janney has never been married, but she has no bad feelings about her decision. She’s noted that she’s never wanted kids, and she’s made peace with those feelings. Janney’s been romantically linked to partners in the past, none of them ever resulting in a legal union.\n\nChelsea Handler is the most vocal of all the stars to have never been married. The comedian has stated publicly many times that she doesn’t want to be married or have kids and that her life is better for it. Handler dated a handful of famous men, like 50 Cent and comedian Jo Koy.\n\nThat’s right. Pedro Pascal has never tied the knot. The Last of Us star is pretty coy about his dating life. Rumors in the past have linked him to Lena Heady, but he’s never confirmed his relationship status publicly, nor has he addressed why he’s never been married.\n\nThough Charlize Theron has never been married, she has had a variety of high-profile relationships, notably with Sean Penn in the mid-2010s. Theron wanted to be a mother, though, and she started a family by adopting children on her own around the same time she was in a relationship with Penn.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross, one of the best nepo babies there is, has never walked down the aisle. Unlike many other unmarried celebs, Ross would like to get married and have children someday, but she’s not worried about it. She instead focuses on her acting career and other projects.\n\nFormer Mad Men star January Jones has dated multiple famous men, like Ashton Kutcher, Jim Carrey, Josh Groban, and Jason Sudeikis, but she’s never married. The actress has stated she used to want marriage, but as she’s aged, her priorities have changed. Jones is a single mom, and she’s never revealed the identity of her son’s father.\n\nMatthew Perry is one-half of one of the greatest television couples of all time, but he’s never been married outside of film. The Friends star has dated women like Julia Roberts, Lizzy Caplan, and Yasmine Bleeth, and he was even engaged to literary manager Molly Hurwitz for some time, but he’s never wed.\n\nShonda Rhimes has always wanted children but never wanted to get married. And she’s done exactly what she wanted. The prolific television producer has three daughters she welcomed on her own — two via adoption and a third through surrogacy.\n\nDiane Keaton is one of the most famous single celebrities. She’s had relationships in the past, notably with Al Pacino and Warren Beatty, but she’s perfectly content being single, even noting that she doesn’t date these days. She instead finds companionship in her dog and the two children she adopted when she was in her 50s.\n\nDespite fans wanting so desperately for Mindy Kaling to end up with her former flame and The Office co-star BJ Novak, the writer and actress has stayed happily single. She’s the single mother of two children, and she’s never shared who their father is (though there are plenty of fan theories that it’s Novak).\n\nAndy Cohen was unmarried but wanted to start a family, so he took matters into his own hands and welcomed two children via surrogacy. Cohen would like to find a husband, and he’s even noted that his son has mentioned that he would like another dad in his life, so perhaps the Bravo host will find someone soon.\n\nLucy Liu has never been married, and even if she did tie the knot, it’s possible she wouldn’t share the news. The actress has very publicly noted that she keeps her dating life private. Liu had been engaged before, and about 10 years after that ended, she welcomed a son via surrogacy as a single mom.\n\nIf Milo Ventimiglia is anything like Jack Pearson in real life, he’d make a fantastic husband. But being a husband hasn’t been in the cards for Ventimiglia thus far. The actor has dated famous women in the past, notably his former Gilmore Girls costar Alexis Bledel, which made Rory and Jess stans very happy, as well as Hayden Panettiere.\n\nLike his famous best friend Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper has never been married. He welcomed two children while he was with his former partner Benjamin Maisani, but the two are just friends and co-parents now. There are still plenty of fans who are holding out hope that Cooper will end up with Cohen one day.\n\nCharlotte York’s goal was to get married and have children, but Kristin Davis has never shared half of that goal with her famous character. As she’s stated, Davis has never wanted to get married. But she does have two children, both of whom she welcomed via adoption.\n\nJohn Cusack has been in some of the best rom-coms, and he’s been pined after by many a viewer, but he’s never gotten married. The actor has been very frank about his decision to stay unwed, noting that he doesn’t listen to societal standards.\n\nLauryn Hill has never married, but she did have a long-term relationship with Rohan Marley, the father of five of her six children. In 2011, Hill revealed that Marley is not the father of her sixth child but that they still have a loving relationship and love their children very much.\n\nIt might come as a shock to learn that Sheryl Crow has never been married. She’s even noted it’s surprising to her. The singer came close to marriage three times but ultimately never wed, and at over 60 years old, she says she’s grateful to have never been married.\n\nOprah Winfrey has never been married, but she’s been in a relationship with Stedman Graham for decades. The media mogul has noted that they’ve considered getting married before — the two were even engaged in the early ‘90s — but they’ve instead remained partners instead of becoming spouses."
