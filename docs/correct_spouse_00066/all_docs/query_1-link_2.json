        "text": "In her interview with Edward Lewine of The New York Times in December 2007, the Chelsea Does star revealed that she and her then-beau had been living together for months.\n\n\"I live with my boyfriend, Ted Harbert, who is the C.E.O. of Comcast Entertainment Group, which includes the E! channel, where I work,\" she stated. \"We've been living together about six months.\"\n\nAn E! representative confirmed to Us Weekly that the pair were \"no longer residing together. Ted has nothing but the highest regard for Chelsea, both personally and professionally.\"\n\nWhile the network's spokesperson did not directly confirm the breakup, news reports said Handler initiated the split.\n\nIn her interview with Marie Claire in 2012, the Chelsea host said their careers got in the way of their relationship.\n\n\"I would come home from work, and Ted would be like, 'Do you want to watch your show?' and I'd be like, 'No, I just came from my show. That's the last thing I'd want to do.' That was the reason it didn't work out, ultimately. I think,\" Handler said.\n\nYears after the breakup, Handler set the record straight regarding her other bedroom confession involving Harbert and their masseuse. The threesome reportedly happened before they split in 2010.\n\nHandler opened up during her appearance on the Wednesday, October 4, episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that it was not the reason they ended things between them.\n\n\"We did have a lot of threesomesâ€š and that, while that's private it's already out there, so I'm gonna double down on that and just say that we didn't break up because I left him for the masseuse. That didn't happen,\" she insisted."
