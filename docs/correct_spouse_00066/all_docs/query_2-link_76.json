        "text": "Chelsea Handler and Jo Koy were pretty much the cutest couple ever while they were together, and their split was met with a collective gasp of “nooooo” across the internet. But apparently, things simply didn’t work out between the pair, and Chelsea just opened up about what went wrong.\n\nSpeaking on Brooke Shields’s podcast (via Entertainment Tonight), Chelsea said that her upcoming Netflix special Revolution will cover Jo “renewing my faith in men.” Chelsea also explained that she won’t shut herself off from dating just because the relationship didn’t work.\n\n“I’m not doing that,” she said. “I do want a relationship. It’s okay for me to admit that now, like, I’ve learned and grown so much, that I got a taste of what that togetherness feels like and I want it again.”\n\n“I’m not that hard up to get married, but I was open to the idea of it and we definitely discussed it at length, like, a lot ’cause it was important to him,” Chelsea added of her and Jo’s relationship. “And then toward the end of the relationship, it just became clear that this was not my person.”\n\nShe went on to say that “walking away from him was one of the most difficult things that I ever had to do” and that “there were just some behaviors that we couldn’t agree on, and it felt to me like I would have to abandon myself—which maybe I would have been okay to do if I were 20 or 25—but I wasn’t willing to do that. No matter how much I loved this person—and I loved him so much—I was not going to abandon myself. I was like, ‘I’m not going to change this, I’m not going to change the way that I behave in order to make you feel more comfortable. I’m not doing that.’ And I had to walk away from something that I really believed was gonna be a forever relationship, and so that was difficult.”\n\nFYI, Chelsea and Jo (who tried therapy before their split) haven’t been in touch that much, and Chelsea said some things have to change before they’re friends again. “I don’t think we can have a friendship until there’s some accountability and some responsibility taken,” she said. “We had a really great friendship and I would love to have that again, you know, but without a couple steps in the right direction, I don’t see that happening.”"
