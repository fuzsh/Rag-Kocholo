And I don’t really want kids. I’m not interested in the myth of ‘The One’ either,” Handler told Red magazine.

It’s a romantic notion to think there is a lid for every pot. There are a few lids. You are with someone for a period and then you move on.\n\n“I believe, as you get older, you make better decisions and if I were to get married now, I would trust myself more. I’m not so stupid. I don’t ignore the flags,” she added."
