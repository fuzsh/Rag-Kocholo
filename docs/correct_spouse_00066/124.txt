Chelsea Handler says her relationship with former E! Entertainment chief Ted Harbert ended because the two couldn’t separate business and pleasure.

In the September issue of Marie Claire @Work — the cover of which Handler graces — the host of E!’s Chelsea Lately said that she and Harbert, who now serves as NBC Broadcasting chairman, spent too much time focusing on work outside of the office.

“I would come home from work, and Ted would be like, ‘Do you want to watch your show?’ and I’d be like, ‘No, I just came from my show. That’s the last thing I’d want to do,'” she said. “That was the reason it didn’t work out, ultimately. I think.”

Handler and Harbert began dating in 2006, the same year her first E! series, The Chelsea Handler Show, premiered. They moved in together months later, while he was serving as CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, overseeing E! and other cable channels. Cheslea Lately debuted in 2007.

Marie Claire @Work also asked Handler — who before moving to E! co-starred in Oxygen’s Girls Behaving Badly — about fellow E! star Joan Rivers’ accusation that she “made it on her back, f—ing” Harbert.

“I so didn’t, and I so don’t care about you asking about it,” replied Handler, who once quipped to The New York Times that the best thing about living with Harbert was that “he drives me to work.”

The couple split up in 2010. Handler most recently has been dating on-again/off-again hotelier boyfriend Andre Balazs.

As for her current relationship, Handler said she’s trying not to lose sight of herself.

“I’m definitely worried about maintaining my relevance and not wanting to go too far out of bounds to accommodate someone else,” she said.
