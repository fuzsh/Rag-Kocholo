Comedian Chelsea Handler has split from her long-term boyfriend, according to reports.

The 34-year-old host of E! chatshow Chelsea Lately broke up with her TV boss and partner of three years Ted Harbert, says Contactmusic.

The pair reportedly shared a Los Angeles home for much of their relationship, while it is believed that the comic asked Harbert to move out into a Hollywood hotel.

A spokesperson for Handler declined to comment on the matter.
