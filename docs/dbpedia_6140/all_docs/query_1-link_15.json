        "text": "October 4, 2020\n\nThis is a strange collection of stories; decadent and surreal, at times horrific, and written by a man who killed himself at the young age of 25.\n\nThe title story \"The Great Shadow\" is by far the most inspired story here. It reminded me a bit of \"The Songs of Maldoror,\" both are something that could only could be written in the idealism, rage and testosterone of a troubled youth.\n\n\"Resurrection,\" like the title story, is novella length, although this one feels a bit overlong at times. \"The Strange Death of Professor Antena\" is a change of pace for the collection, being a strange mystery/sci-fi story. The last two stories \"Wings\" and \"Fixer of Moments\" are a couple of the best ones, particularly the latter. The rest are more middling stories, but have their moments.\n\nAt its best this is an excellent mixture of surrealism and resigned, languishing decadence. It's all very imaginative and mind-bending, but this would probably best be enjoyed in small doses. I suppose it depends on how many feverish, artistic rants you can take. The protagonists are all fairly similar; sick with the common herd, living in imaginative worlds of their own creation, all of which leads to bad results in every case. One must be in the proper mood for this, and read it at a speed where one can digest the opulent descriptions.\n\nThe Great Shadow - In the title story we meet a man who lives in dreams, for whom the banal real world isn't enough. He thinks back fondly on his childhood awe and fears. He people-watches and writes lives for them and feels he has experienced something greater than having known them at all. Things provoke experiences in him that have no reason to do so. He fantasizes that if he were rich he would build a gloomy castle which he would only explore in the half-light with his fingers, and he would erect monuments to non-existent heroes, and graves where none are buried.\n\nMuch of this reminds me of Huysman's \"Against the Grain\" in its decadent descriptions, and in phrases like, \"At times, I suffer from minor physical aches and pains, but I experience them only on my palate, as if they were unpleasant tastes.\" Senses are mingled, \"My ears were assaulted by engulfing planes, aromas whistled past, transforming themselves into dissonant music [...] The crepitations of the dazzling lights were actually invading my soul, pouring burning sun on my desires, drenching with rain my tedium that lay spreading uselessly out over a plain, shedding moonlight on the graveyards of my nostalgias...\"\n\nHis detachment from the world and urge to throw himself into a Shadow side of reality ultimately lead him to murder, and an increasingly feverish madness.\n\nResurrection - This story is similar to the previous one in many ways, but in less elaborate language and is overall less impactful. Here we meet an artist who has come to terms with his lonely life as it is. He occasionally will see a family together and feel regret, or have a carnal desire for a woman. But he sees and despises all of this as the desires of the masses. He does love Paris, but seemingly from a distance, like everything else.\n\nHe also lives in memories, sometimes unsure if he himself experienced what he remembers, or if his artistic self created it. He recalls sitting at a park bench one day with a feeling of longing, and yet, \"He was sure, absolutely sure, that he had never experienced it. How then could he remember those unreal feelings of longing? Probably because it had not been him who, one April evening, years before, had sat sorrowfully in that garden, but another who would possess some of the same qualities, another self whom the artist had fleetingly inhabited...\"\n\nUltimately though he falls for a dancer in what proves to be a brief affair which he never consummates, and is left questioning everything he's believed about himself to that point. He tries to deny his desire for her, and the pain it gives him. The story has a pretty wild ending. This is a sad, quieter story that, in that sense, reminded me of Georges Rodenbach's \"Bruges-la-Morte,\" although they are very different.\n\nMyself the Other - A very brief story a bit like \"The Great Shadow,\" written in feverish journal entries. The narrator feels detached from his own self, things only get worse when he meets a man who he unconsciously begins to imitate.\n\nThe Strange Death of Professor Antena - A very strange sci-fi mystery tale, full of long, drawn-out speculations about reincarnated lives and past-life memories. It's an interesting story in its way, but really dragged at times. After a professor dies suddenly and mysteriously with a friend in tow, the friend investigates the dead man's strange researches and thinks he has found the way he actually died.\n\nMystery - We find ourselves in familiar territory here with a protagonist who, \"...what sickened him was the everydayness of other people's lives.\" It's a lot like \"Resurrection\" in overall theme and plot as well. A writer who spends his days contemplating whether to go mad or commit suicide because he feels adrift in life finds some solace when he is able to combine his soul with that of another.\n\nThe Man of Dreams - Another brief story, this one also about a man and his companion who are sick with the everyday banality of life. But his friend explains to him how he has managed to escape into his own dreams which present him with an infinite variety of worlds to explore.\n\nWings - One of the wilder stories, and one of the better ones in the book I thought. This one too is about an artist who wants to express something beyond the everyday, in fact he is full of strange ideas about his poetry having sounds, smells and tastes. All of this sends him into madness.\n\nThe Fixer of Moments - This is another of the better stories here, more sinister than the average. This one has a Poe-esque flavor to it with its obsessions, madness and what it ultimately leads to. A man is convinced he can keep memories alive in his mind forever, but this leads to a horrific outcome when he mixes it with love.\n\nMarch 24, 2024\n\n#1\n\nA princess could not exist in my room, not even at night, and I had not left my room. And yet I have spoken to her, I had seen her quite clearly. But where, where? I could almost remember her features, her mouth filled with pearls, her flowerlike gestures. There were walls of mist around my eyes.\n\n#2\n\nHe had never been afraid of going mad precisely because madness already existed inside him. Just as an organism can sometimes adapt to certain pernicious microbes – living unharmed by them, invulnerable to the illness which those same microbes would provoke in other organisms – so his spirit had grown invulnerable to madness, adapted to it, immunized against it by madness itself.\n\n#3\n\nHis company is a torment to me. Yet I seek him out everywhere. When he fails to appear, I feel terribly tired, exhausted, as I had just made a huge physical effort.\n\n#4\n\nHe went out and reappeared swathed in an ample, fur-lined cloak. It was May by then and, although the morning was rather cool, I was surprised to see his eternal black overcoat replaced by that extravagant cloak which I had never seen before. On his hands he wore thick grey fur gloves. He wrapped a long shawl about his neck, up to his chin.\n\n#5\n\nPride! Pride! But the price he paid was this dull death agony. Meanwhile, he had reached the great square. He made an effort to collect his thoughts and, however painful the experience, he began to see himself with utter lucidity.\n\n#6\n\nAnd as for feelings, name one which, when it comes down to it, cannot be reduced to either love or hate. And sensations? Again there are just two, joy and pain. In life, everything goes in pairs, like the sexes. And can there be any more desolating fact that there are only two sexes?\n\n#7\n\nI remember that Zagoriansky merely smiled one of his unforgettable triangular smiles, adding something I didn't understand, some harshly onomatopoetic word, doubtless a Russian word intended as a reply.\n\n#8\n\nIt is just like life. You cannot touch life, it is all glitter, a fleeting image. What was cannot be reproduced, there can never be the same kisses, the same sun, the same struggles. And no secret can be repeated."
