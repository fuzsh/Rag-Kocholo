        "text": "'Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks—we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.'\n\n'Harry,' said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, 'every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.'\n\nHe played with the idea and grew willful; tossed it into the air and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and Philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat's black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him, and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.\n\nChildren begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.\n\nThe only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\n\nOne should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\n\nI choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.\n\nI adore simple pleasures. They are the last refuge of the complex.\n\nI can believe anything, provided that it is quite incredible.\n\nI like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\n\nI love acting. It is so much more real than life.\n\nNowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.\n\nOne can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing.\n\nPerhaps, after all, America never has been discovered. I myself would say that it had merely been detected.\n\nThe advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional.\n\nThe only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself.\n\nThe reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror.\n\nBut beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in the summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.\n\nIt is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\n\nBeing natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know.\n\nWomen defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.\n\nThere is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution."
