Only the nationalistic urges experienced through the end of the 19th c. all over the politically unsettled Europe, would provoke, for the first time, a look inside frontiers. These patriotic impulses would proudly thrive through the myths and heroes of the grandiose past but, curiously, would also glance, for the first time, on the anonymous people that formed the nation. Distanced analyses of its outputs, developed by euro-centred cultivated scholars, would become the foundations of the Portuguese ethnographic studies, creating, on a small patch of the cosmopolitan elite a small interest over this production, collecting them as vernacular objects d'art or primitive artefacts. Almost simultaneously, artists from the first Portuguese modernist generation would also develop a keen interest on the motifs and features of these ‘exotic’ objects – continuously produced and cheaply sold on markets and county fairs – in accordance with the enchantment of the international Avant-garde generation with African, Mesoamerican, or Oriental arts as also with their own local folklore, all perceived as artistic productions still untainted by the civilization and the dominant ‘European’ culture of Antiquity and Christianity background. These inputs surfaced on the work of, among others, Souza-Cardoso, Viana and Almada Negreiros, as also on the Delaunay couple during their brief Portuguese stay between 1915 and 1917. These appropriations, oxymoronically presented as traditional and modern, would become gradually popular when applied by these artists on Revue Theatre sets and costumes throughout the 1920’s, following the legacy of the Slavic folklore dance pieces developed by the Diaghilev Russian Ballets. Nevertheless, it would be the far-right dictatorship, implemented from 1926 onwards, that would view this modernistic approach to the vernacular realm as the perfect embodiment of its nationalistic ideals and values. Presented as idiosyncratically Portuguese, the folklore and popular arts produced by these ‘bonhomous’ peasants, and its modern appropriation, would be praised as the perfect refutation to all the ‘foreign’ influences, modern or ancient: from the ‘communist’ modernism or the frivolous art deco to the academic classical styles, signs of a decadent subdued past from which the new nation – naming itself as Estado Novo (New State) – wanted to distance and escape. Through the assistance of the modernist generation, the National Propaganda Bureau developed a group of actions that would promote the Portuguese vernacular arts and, through them, the creation of a contemporary ‘modern national’ style that would permeate the conservative moral values of the regime throughout the people consequently ‘inventing a traditional’ world that still forms the base of the national identity.\n\nThe early twentieth century was a tumultuous time for Portuguese society. Shortly before World War I began, the Portuguese monarchy fell and gave way to the First Republic on October 5, 1910. Collectively, the 1890 British ultimatum to Portugal—which forced Portugal to retreat from its claimed colonial African territories—the fall of the monarchy, and the country's participation in the First World War set the framework for the post-romantic period. The cultural elite of the time initiated movements such as the Portuguese Renaissance in defense of a nation open to Europe yet still marked by a desire to return to its origins. In this context, Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa and his friend Mário de Sá-Carneiro emerged as the founders of Portuguese modernism, which they would develop under the concept of sensacionismo (sensationism). Fernando Pessoa and Mário de Sá-Carneiro, along with Almada Negreiros are some of the major representatives of modernism in painting and literature in Portuguese-speaking countries. In this article, we analyze the impact of modernism in Portugal at the beginning of the twentieth century and the role played by the work of Fernando Pessoa in the sociocultural context of that Portuguese era.\n\nLargely due to the conservatism of audiences and critics, Portuguese theatre was mostly indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the avant-garde theatre coming from elsewhere in Europe. Therefore, naturalistic theatre and historical drama were the staple of Portuguese theatres until the 1950s, with the only exception of the plays of Almada Negreiros and symbolist plays by Fernando Pessoa, Raul Brandão and António Patrício. However, modernism found its place on stage in one of the most typical Portuguese theatre forms: «Revista à Portuguesa», the Portuguese revue theatre, which welcomed the first generation of Portuguese modernist painters to work as set and costume designers. Artists like Jorge Barradas, Milly Possoz, José Barbosa, among others, took the influence of the Ballets Russes of Diaghlev, and the avant-garde visual arts, to change the appearance of the most typically Portuguese theatre genre, Revista à Portuguesa. With this paper I will try to document how modernist painters gained entry in «Revista à Portuguesa» and created an art that fused the commercial interests of theatre entrepreneurs, the tastes of the bourgeois audiences and their own artistic sensibilities.\n\nThis article presents the experience report of the Teaching Project “EUROPEAN VANGUARDS: a dive into modernist artistic-literary work”, developed at the IFPI-campus Parnaíba. The project aimed to encourage the reading, production and interpretation of literary texts and artistic works and was developed by the campus' Portuguese Language and Art teachers, seeking to unite these curricular units in interdisciplinary work. The beginning of the 20th century expanded the technical achievements and industrial development of the previous century, but was also marked by several political conflicts: the First World War, the Russian Revolution, the formation of fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany. In the first half of the century, the Second World War took place, in society, the differences between the richest and poorest classes became more pronounced. It was in this historical context that the art of the first half of the 20th century, modern art, developed. Bearing in mind the need to understand the movement that revolutionized Brazilian culture, it was necessary to analyze the European avant-gardes, they represent an artistic concept that innovated not only through boldness, but also through complexity that, paradoxically, took on an original simplicity. 3rd year students were able to understand this artistic movement through the eyes of Literature and Art. With contextualized and interdisciplinary classes, they produced their own texts and artistic works based on European avant-garde. Finally, there was an exhibition in the school courtyard, where students were able to display their work and talk to other high school students about what they had learned.\n\nThe largely forgotten novel Nova Sapho (1912), fictional debut of Visconde de Vila Moura (1877-1935), merits recovery from the oblivion is has been consigned to in canonical Portuguese literary history for a variety of reasons, not least among them the unprecedented (and unmatched even through the following century of Lusophone writing) figure of its protagonist, Maria Peregrina, an intellectually and sexually assertive lesbian and poet of genius. This paper focuses in particular on what I claim is the relationship between Vila Moura’s creation and female-gendered configurations of perversion and creativity in the Portuguese Modernist canon, such as Orpheu’s Violante de Cysneiros, the \"americana fulva\" of Mário de Sá-Carneiro’s Confissão de Lúcio, and José de Almada Negreiros’s A Engomadeira. I argue that a mapping of this relationship allows, among other goals, for a reassessment (in terms akin to those of Vincent Sherry’s recent study, Modernism and the Reinvention of Decadence) of the commonplace assertion distancing the aesthetics and politics of decadentism from the form and content of the Modernist rupture in the Portuguese context."
