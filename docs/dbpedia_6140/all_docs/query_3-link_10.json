        "text": "Year Title[a] Author[b] Country Notes 1805 Kyllenion - Ein Jahr in Arkadien Duke Augustus of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg Germany [A Year in Arcadia: Kyllenion] Set in ancient Greece, it features several couples – including a homosexual one – falling in love, overcoming obstacles and living happily ever after. This is his only published work. 1822 Olivier ou le Secret [fr] Duchess Claire de Duras (Claire de Coëtnempren de Kersaint) France [Olivier; or, The Secret] Olivier de Sancerre evokes, under cover of impotence, male homosexuality. In the first decades of the 19th century, homosexuality was manifested in stories through the representation of masculine impotence and epicene characters. 1826 Olivier \"Henri de Latouche\" (Hyacinthe-Joseph Alexandre Thabaud de Latouche) France Set between the end of the Ancien Régime and the Bourbon Restoration, tells the story of Olivier, count de R.. Latouche's text is the most explicit of the three (Olivier by Duras and Armance by Stendhal), with its mention of Mariage blanc. The character's secret and the consequent obstacle have always been interpreted in the direction of physical impotence, and, secondarily, of homosexuality. 1827 Armance ou quelques scènes d'un salon de Paris en 1827 Anonymous (Marie-Henri Beyle \"Stendhal\") France [Armance; or, Some Scenes from a Paris Salon in 1827] Set during the Bourbon Restoration, Octave de Malivert, a taciturn but brilliant young man barely out of the École Polytechnique, is attracted to Armance Zohiloff, who shares his feelings. The novel describes how a series of misunderstandings have kept the lovers Armance and Octave divided. A series of clues suggest that Octave is impotent as a result of a severe accident. Stendhal has very quietly inserted the theme, without talking about it openly. 1829 Aloys ou le Religieux du mont Saint-Bernard Marquis Astolphe de Custine France [Aloys; or, The Religious of Mont Saint-Bernard] Tells the story of an interrupted courtship. A young fiancé breaks off his engagement a few days before the wedding ceremony, apparently the reason is the groom's secret passion for the girl's mother. After the break, Aloys takes her vows and retires to the convent. 1835 Séraphîta Honoré de Balzac France In a castle in Norway near the fjord Strømfjord, Séraphitüs, a strange and melancholic being, conceals a terrible secret. He loves Minna, and she returns this love, believing Séraphitüs to be a man. But Séraphitüs is also loved by Wilfrid, who considers him to be a woman, Séraphîta. In reality, Séraphitüs-Séraphîta is a perfect androgyne, born to parents who by the doctrines of Swedenborg have transcended their humanity. The novel introduces bisexuality and androgyny. 1836* Chi mi difenderà dal tuo bel volto? \"Stendhal\" (Marie-Henri Beyle) Italy [Who will defend me from your beauty?] Narrates the romance between the 57-year-old painter Michelangelo Buonarroti and Tommaso Cavalieri, the young 23-year-old Roman aristocrat who inspired many of the poems of the Renaissance genius. Written between 1832 and 1836. He never wrote it as such, except for sketches of the novel in loose notes, which were published in 1995. 1858* I Neoplatonici Luigi Settembrini Italy [The Neoplatonics] Set in ancient Greece, it tells the story of the erotic and sentimental education of two beautiful boys, Callicles and Doro, united by a strong passion since they were children, who discover and experience sexuality in a strangely joyous and natural way –open and without exclusions. It was published until 1977. 1861 Cecil Dreeme Theodore Winthrop US Robert Byng has recently returned from his Grand Tour of Europe to settle in New York City. An old friend lends Byng his rooms at Chrysalis College. It is there that Byng meets his mysterious and reclusive neighbor Cecil Dreeme, and the two strike up what scholars have identified as a romantic friendship. 1870 Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania Bayard Taylor US The title characters have a close, affectionate friendship, but are not physically intimate, and both have romantic relationships with women. Scholars disagree as to whether the story should be understood as having a gay subtext. 1871 La historia de Chucho el Ninfo \"Facundo\" (José Tomás de Cuéllar [es]) Mexico [The Story of Chucho the Nympho] Introduces the first clearly effeminate character, who does not identify as a man. 1875 Fridolins heimliche Ehe Adolf von Wilbrandt Germany [Fridolin's secret marriage] First German author presenting homosexuality in a positive light. It narrates a mutual crush between two men with a happy ending, justifying all the love options in a brash parody of Platonic dialogues, and does so in a comedy tone. 1876 Geri ou un premier amour Louis Beysson [fr] France [Geri; or, A First Love] Tells us the love story between two boys -Victor and Geri- in a boarding school in Switzerland, in the middle of the 19th century. It is the first story in which a homosexual relationship is described in French literature. 1879 The Lady of The Aroostook William Dean Howells US The two main characters in this novel are men in their 20s traveling together from Boston to Venice as passengers on a sailing ship, a journey six weeks long. Both are given women love-interests, but there are homoerotic elements of the men's friendship, described by the body language throughout the novel. 1881 The Sins of the Cities of the Plain[2] \"Jack Saul\" (John Saul) UK A pornographic novel purporting to be the memoirs of a male prostitute. 1884 À rebours Joris-Karl Huysmans France [Against Nature] The narrative focuses on a single character: Jean des Esseintes, an eccentric, lonely and sick esthete, who tries to retire to an ideal artistic world created by himself. 1885 Manor: Eine Novelle Karl Heinrich Ulrichs Germany [Manor] The story tells the love story between two young men, and uses vampirism and its rejection as a metaphor for homosexuality and the public reaction to it. 1885 Um Homem Gasto \"Ferreira Leal [pt]\" (Lourenço Ferreira da Silva Leal) Brazil [A Spent Men] The unhappiness of a badly contracted marriage generates discomfort between Luiza and Alberto. In a letter from Alberto to Paulo, we learn the reasons that made him a “spent man”, a life of excesses and perversions, including homosexuality, a “nefarious error” that he began to practice in his youth. 1888 O Ateneu[3] Raul Pompeia Brazil [The Athenaeum] Depicts situational homosexuality among students in an all-male boarding school. 1889 A Marriage Below Zero Alan Dale US A melodrama told from the point of view of a woman whose marriage is threatened by her husband's love for another man. The story ends with her husband's suicide - an early occurrence of what would become a recurring trope of gay characters dying or facing otherwise unhappy endings. 1890 The Picture of Dorian Gray[2][1] Oscar Wilde UK The novel's allusions to homosexuality and homosexual desire were seen as scandalous when it was first published serially in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine. Wilde subsequently made several revisions to excise homoerotic themes before the work was published in book format. An unexpurgated version was published in 2011 which further included passages deleted by an editor at Lippincott's before initial publication.[4] 1890 O cortiço Aluísio Azevedo Brazil [The Slum] Tells the stories of Portuguese and other European immigrants, mulattos, and former African slaves living and working together in a single community. Among them, it presents Albino, an effeminate male character and stereotype of the homosexual of the time, it also shows a sexual relationship between two women. 1890 Un exil volontaire. Un roman Marc-André Raffalovich France [A Willing Exile. A Novel] Two-volume of a unusual novel about marriage and cheating with interesting cast of secondary queer characters with a completely unexpected ending. 1891 Tim: A Story of School Life Howard Overing Sturgis UK Describes the love of two young boys in a boarding school. It is based on the author's unhappy days at Eton. Tim of Sturgis can be considered a precursor of Maurice of Forster. 1891 O barão de Lavos Abel Botelho Portugal [The Baron of Lavos] Sebastião, Baron de Lavos, one night seduces Eugénio, a sixteen-year-old boy who makes a living on the streets of Lisbon and with whom he will end up falling in love. When the boy is aware of his power over the baron, he begins to exploit it, beginning the collapse of the baron's life. 1891* Billy Budd Herman Melville US The novel remained unfinished at the author's death in 1891, was finally published in 1924. Billy Budd, a \"handsome sailor\", inadvertently beats and kills his false accuser, master-at-arms John Claggart. The ship's captain, Edward Vere, acknowledges Billy's lack of intent, but claims that mutiny law requires that he sentence him to hang. 1893 Teleny, or The Reverse of the Medal[2] Anonymous UK Pornographic novel published anonymously. Believed to be the work of multiple authors, possibly including Oscar Wilde. Set in fin-de-siècle Paris, its concerns are the magnetic attraction and passionate though ultimately tragic affair between a young Frenchman named Camille Des Grieux and the Hungarian pianist René Teleny. 1893 A Florida Enchantment Fergus Redmond and Archibald Clavering Gunter US It is notable for its cross-dressing lead characters, much later discussed as bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender. 1894 The Priest and the Acolyte John Francis Bloxam UK The story details the love affair of a young Anglican priest and his lover, a 14-year-old boy. It was thought that it was authored by Oscar Wilde, which is why it was used against him during his legal proceedings. 1894 The Green Carnation Anonymous (Robert Hichens) UK The novel is a Roman à clef and a gentle parody of aestheticism whose main characters, Esmé Amarinth and Lord Reginald Hastings, are based upon Oscar Wilde and his disciple, Lord Alfred Douglas. 1894 Surma uuringud Count Eric von Stenbock Estonia [The True Story of a Vampire] Also known as The Sad Story of a Vampire, is inspired by Le Fanu's Carmilla, and is one of the short stories included in the collection entitled “Studien zum Tod”.
