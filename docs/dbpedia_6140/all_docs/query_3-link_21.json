        "text": "CL 1A:1 #16506 LIU MWF 9 125 DWINELLE\n\n\"Freaks, Mutants, and the Literary Invention of Normative Identities\"\n\nIt has been argued that the invention of \"low\" characters in Western literature was directly connected to the rise of a new philosophy of private life. Since low characters can easily eavesdrop on the most intimate secrets of other characters, this literary strategy was effectively employed to render private life visible and to overcome the static dichotomy between individual time and social time. In this course we will examine works from different national literary traditions (Roman, American, British, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, German, French), historical periods (ancient, Renaissance, modern), and genres (novel, drama, short story, poetry) to reassess that thesis. Studying characters who are either explicitly branded as \"freaks\" and \"mutants\" or implicitly compared to other \"normal\" characters, we will investigate the ways in which these characters become privileged to observe everyday life in certain literary traditions and excluded from everyday life in other traditions. Why must certain characters be ostracized and even demonized to be the bearers of truth, trauma, and history? How do these marginalized beings articulate thoughts otherwise unspeakable, or live lives previously unimaginable? How are bodies transformed, deformed, and reformed, and how does that transformation serve to accentuate these characters' otherness and, at the same time, problematize our normative notion of human identity?\n\nReading list\n\nApuleius.

But what happens when hosts and guests breach expected codes of hospitality? How does the definition of \"guest\" and \"host\" change when the \"homeland\" itself becomes a hostile or es-strange-ing place? What is it to be a stranger in one's own land? This course aims to provide students with an introduction to critical reading and writing while exploring answers to these questions. Beginning with a consideration of Homi Bhabha's concept of the unhomely and our own experiences of relocation, we will dialogue with poems, songs, drama, short stories, dance, films, and novels dealing with this subject: enunciating personal perspectives on travel, (in)hospitality,and what it means to be a citizen of more than one \"world.\"\n\nReadings will include:\n\nElla Fitzgerald, \"Miss Otis Regrets\" (She's Unable To Lunch Today)\n\nLauryn Hill, \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\"\n\nJune Jordan, Haruko: love poems (selections)\n\nJeanne Benguigui, Selected Poems\n\nHomi Bhabha, The location of culture (selections)\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, The Tempest\n\nAndy and Larry Wachowski, Bound (film)\n\nOusemane Sembene, La Noire de...

How does art help us determine the division between public and private life? In this class we look at artworks and read books that were the actual cause of public scandal. We also look at depictions of scandalous representation in film and text. What happens when the public experience of art is represented as purely private? How do debates about religion, pornography, and nationalism highlight aesthetic questions about individual desire and communal responsibility?\n\nThis course is designed to fulfill the University's 1A reading and composition requirement. We will spend considerable time in class on improving students' basic writing skills such as sentence and paragraph structure and thesis development. Students will write a number of short essays of increasing length from 2 to 6 pages during the course of the semester.\n\nOur class discussions will be drawn from the following works:\n\nRequired texts\n\nPlato, The Republic\n\nShakespeare, Hamlet\n\nShelley, Frankenstein\n\nFlaubert, Madame Bovary\n\nRushdie, The Satanic Verses\n\nReader:\n\nSelections from Ovid; Balzac, \"The Unknown Masterpiece\"; Kafka, \"The Hunger Artist\"; Yourcenar, \"How Wang-Fo was Saved\"; Poetry by Keats, Baudelaire, Stevens, Rich; essays and clippings on recent art controversies, essays on graffiti.\n\nCL 1A:4 16515 WACKS TT 8-9:30 222 WHEELER\n\n\"The City\"\n\nIn this course we will examine the role of the city in literature. What is the city's relationship to its citizens and residents? How is the city portrayed not just as a backdrop but as an agent, or even a character? How does technology and ideology shape the city; how are these changes played out in various genres of literature across time periods and cultures? What are the centrifugal effects over time on the fabric of the city? We will examine the works of several theorists, classical, medieval and modern, as they relate to the works of fiction, film, drama and poetry on the syllabus.\n\nWorks of Drama and Fiction:\n\nAristophanes, The Clouds\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice\n\nNaguib Mahfouz, Midaq Alley\n\nHenry Roth, Call It Sleep\n\nNeal Stephenson, Snow Crash\n\nSelections from Modern Poets:\n\nCharles Baudelaire, The Flowers of Evil\n\nHart Crane, The Bridge\n\nFederico Garcia Lorca, Poet in New York\n\nAlan Ginsberg, Howl\n\nPiri Thomas, Selected Poetry\n\nFilms:\n\nMetropolis\n\nEl callej√≥n de los milagros: Midaq Alley\n\nThe Matrix\n\nSelections from classical and medieval theorists:\n\nAristotle, The Politics\n\nLivy, The History of Rome\n\nSt. Augustine, City of God\n\nIbn Khaldun, al-Muqaddimah (An Introduction to History)\n\nal-Makkari, History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain\n\nSelections from Modern theorists:\n\nLewis Mumford, The City in History\n\nMax Weber, The City\n\nWalter Benjamin, The Arcades Project\n\nCL 1A:5 16518 STAFF TT 9:30-11 225 WHEELER\n\nCL 1A:6 16521 HOCHBERG TT 9:30-11 205 DWINELLE\n\n\"Heroes and Anti Heroes\"\n\nThe greatest literary works of all times present us with \"Anti Heroes\" as their central characters. We read about tragic, mentally sick, obsessed, weak, poor and miserable men and women. We spend time with these \"losers\" and give them the attention we would never give them in \"real life\". What makes us so attracted to these characters we would never choose to be our close friends? Why are we so fascinated by them? What does literature and artistic representation in general \"do for these anti Heroes\" that makes them so heroic after all? These questions and more will be addressed in this course.\n\nRequired texts\n\nSophocles, Oedipus the King\n\nShakespeare, Hamlet\n\nAlbert Camus, The Stranger\n\nLu Xun, Diary of a madman and Other Stories\n\nRecommended readings\n\nToni Morrison, Sula, J.D Salinger, Catcher in the Rye. In addition to this list there will be a Reader including essays (Freud, Aristotle, and others), poetry (Emily Dickinson, Anne Sexton and others), short stories (Franz Kafka, Flannery O'Connor and others). We will also watch some films relevant to the course subject: Welcome to the Dollhouse and Muriel's Wedding\n\nCL 1A:7 16524 WAREH TT 11-12:30 223 WHEELER\n\n\"We The People\"\n\nIn this writing-intensive course we will examine literature both about and for the people. How do authors conceive of \"the people\"? How do they use language in order to sway the minds of the people? Beginning with Socrates' speech to the citizens of Athens, and ending with modern poetic conceptions of American dreams and dilemmas, we will ask how authors configure their words in order to achieve varying personal and political effects. This approach will enable you to examine closely the rhetoric of the literature we study, even as you work towards strengthening and polishing your own ability to construct written arguments.\n\nRequired texts\n\nPlato, Apology and Crito\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, Julius Caesar\n\nNikolai Gogol, Dead Souls, Volume I\n\nFrederick Douglass, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\n\nWalt Whitman, Leaves of Grass and Democratic Vistas\n\nCourse Reader\n\ncontaining the poetry of (among others) Carl Sandburg and Langston Hughes, as well as speeches by such figures as Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King.\n\nCL 1A:8 16527 STEVENS TT 11-12:30 121 WHEELER\n\n\"The Trial\"\n\nWhat does the law have to do with justice? How can a wrong ever be righted? What does it mean to speak \"the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth\"? Literature has long been obsessed with the scene of the individual on trial. Indeed, some of the founding texts of both literature and philosophy revolve around the question of the proper administration of justice. In this class, notions of justice, revenge, forgiveness and forgetting will be examined in the framework of the trial narrative.\n\nStudents will be expected to produce a total of 20-25 pages of writing during the semester, divided up into two shorter papers and one longer paper. Students will also be expected to choose one text to discuss in an in-class presentation. Attention will be paid to the technical demands of writing (rhetoric, grammar, organization, etc.).\n\nReading List\n\nPlato, The Apology\n\nMachiavelli, The Prince\n\nShakespeare, Troilus and Cressida\n\nHeinrich von Kleist, Michael Kohlhaas\n\nOscar Wilde, De Profundis\n\nFranz Kafka, The Trial\n\nselected poems of Dickinson and Blake\n\nfilms\n\nOrson Welles, The Trial\n\nOtto Preminger, Witness for the Prosecution\n\nAkira Kurosawa, Rashomon\n\nCL H1A 16503 COKAL TT 9:30-11 223 WHEELER\n\n\"Love, Pain, and Dis-ease\"\n\nMost works of literature present characters meeting challenges, combatting an opponent or opposing force over which they ultimately have some power. In these travails, the one thing most people feel they can count on is their own bodies. When someone falls sick, however, the body speaks a different language, takes control of its owner (just as disease has taken over the body); individuals lose whatever control they exert over their fates. Thus one principal theme of this course will be the examination of the body's language during illness--how it exerts this control--and what interest individual authors and cultures as a whole might have in constructing the suffering body as romantically interesting, repulsive, helpless, uncanny, etc. What happens to our sense of character, and to the shape of the text itself,when the vague and general threat of plague becomes personal? How can an individual assert his/her will in time of epidemic or personal sickness?\n\nLiterature is also often about love, the passion that also takes over the body and fills it with hitherto unknown and unexpected tremblings, urges, and other symptoms. And love is often seen as the bridge between sickness and health, unhappiness and bliss. This course will also ask questions about the ways love itself is like a sickness, and (perhaps most importantly) explore conceptions of the truths that are revealed or concealed by disease and/or love.\n\nReading List:\n\nPhiloctetes, Sophocles\n\nA Midsummer Night's Dream, Shakespeare\n\nKatinka, Herman Bang\n\nCollected Poems, Sylvia Plath\n\nLove in the Time of Cholera, Gabriel Garc√≠a Marquez\n\nWritten on the Body, Jeanette Winterson\n\nThe Seventh Seal, Ingmar Bergman (film)\n\nCourse reader to include excerpts from Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir, by Paul Monette; The Decameron, Boccaccio; Illness as Metaphor/AIDS and Its Metaphors, by Susan Sontag\n\nCL 2A 16560 BALBUENA MW 10-12 224 WHEELER\n\nF 11-12 224 WHEELER\n\n*ORNAMENT AND ARTIFICE * DANDYISM AND DECADENCE\n\nThis course will study the figure of the dandy, more specifically, that of the writer-dandy. A man who re-invents himself in reaction to society, the dandy claims the mask and the artifice, and makes his body the stage for his aesthetic ideas. Out of himself he fashions a \"personnage de cr√©ation\"--self-controlled, sober, impassible, elegant, \"raffin√©.\"\n\nFocusing on \"√©crivain-dandys\" such as Barbey d'Aurevilly, Baudelaire, Mallarm√© and Oscar Wilde, we will observe how dandysm and writing constitute two parallel attempts to live this \"vie de roman.\" We will discuss issues of identity-formation and gender construction in the background of 19th century Paris and literary \"Decadence,\" but will center our analysis on Huysman's √Ä Rebours, the synthesis of decadent dandyism. Among the topics we will cover are the search for beauty in the aesthetization of daily life; denial of nature and quest for artifice; fashion, decoration and landscaping.\n\nSome questions to be raised in the course are: Why is the dandy always a male? How does he construct and manipulate his masculinity? How does this construction affect the image and the role of women? Is there a correspondence among the language, the look and the lifestyle of the writer-dandy?\n\nA proficient reading and speaking knowledge of French is required for this course. When working on a French text, class will be conducted in French. Writing will be done in English.\n\nRequired texts\n\nJ.-K.

Driving each of the six central texts below is a struggle between the demands of the past and the characters in the present. Students will work through a careful sequence of paper assignments, including at least one non-expository paper and one comprehensive final paper.\n\nI: Violence and the Past: Retribution and Reconquest\n\nToni Morrison, Beloved\n\nTayeb Salih, Season of Migration to the North\n\nII: Presenting the Past: Language and Embodiment\n\nSeamus Heaney, from Opened Ground: Selected Poems, 1966-1996\n\nfrom Modern Arabic Poetry, ed.

Almost as old and prevalent, however, are texts which satirize or treat ironically the typical pattern and elements of romance narratives. In this course we will consider a wide variety of texts and films from different cultures in an effort to understand both what it is about romance narratives which so fascinates and what it is about them that encourages the composition of texts that ridicule and criticize the fantasies and ideologies which fuel romances. The readings and assignments of the course are broken into three units: ancient mediterranean narratives, 18th & 19th century novels, and 20th century films. The writing assignments will become progressively longer and more involved as we progress through the three units, finishing with a 10 page paper that will take a broad critical perspective on the nature of romance and anti-romance.\n\nRequired texts\n\nHomer, The Odyssey.\n\nAchilles Tatius, Leukippe and Kleitophon (in course reader)\n\nPetronius, Satyrica\n\nSamuel Richardson, Pamela\n\nHenry Fielding, Joseph Andrews\n\nMarquis de Sade, Justine (selections, in course reader)\n\nMarquis de Sade, Juliette (selections, in course reader)\n\nGeorges Bataille, Story of the Eye\n\nFilms\n\nClaude Chabrol, Les Bonnes Femmes\n\nPretty Woman\n\nOliver Stone, Natural Born Killers\n\nCL 1B:6 16545 COWAN TT 8-9:30 125 DWINELLE\n\n\"DEVIANTS, DELINQUENTS AND PERVERTS\"\n\nIn this class, we will be reading a range of books with particular attention to a topic that has fascinated writers over the centuries: deviancy. We will examine some of literature's greatest cases of \"criminality\" and \"perversion,\" from Kriemhild's excesses (Nibelungenlied) to the immoralism of Andre Gide's hero, from the transgressions of the Princess of Cleves to the anti-naturalist polemics of Europe's fin de siecle decadents. Beyond the pleasure in reading about bad guys and girls, our discussions will take shape around issues such as the following: the intimate relations between the \"normal\" and the \"deviant,\" the role of surveillance, the obsession with secrets and their unveiling, the rhetoric of pathology employed by 19th century Europe in the production of its most significant others, and cultural reappropriations of deviancy as a sign of superiority or genius.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nThe Nibelungenlied (Anonymous)\n\nThe Princess of Cleves (Madame de Lafayette)\n\nAgainst Nature (Joris-Karl Huysmans)\n\nThe Immoralist (Andre Gide)\n\nCourse Reader (available in August???)\n\nCL 1B:7 16548 STENPORT TT 9:30-11 224 WHEELER\n\n\"Cities in Literature\"\n\nIn this course we are looking at different conceptions and constructions of urban space. We will be investigating images of real and unreal cities, of utopian and dystopian locations, and of representations of historic, modern and contemporary urban places. The readings will be questioning the interrelations between concepts of modernity and the city, in order to see how ideologies of urbanity play out in different times and places. Texts include representations of cities as diverse as contemporary New Delhi and New York, turn-of-the-century Stockholm, conceptions of city settlement in the Hebrew Bible and on the Western American Frontier of the last century, as well as modernist representations of Europe and Scandinavia. Through close and careful readings of novels, short stories, epic, poetry, and film, we will also look at how cities in literature are portrayed depending on genre. There will be close attention paid to writing and analytical strategies throughout the semester. Three papers are required: two mid-length, and one longer comparison paper at the end. There will be a final exam.\n\nRequired texts\n\nCharles Baudelaire: Selected poems from The Flowers of Evil\n\nE.T.A.
