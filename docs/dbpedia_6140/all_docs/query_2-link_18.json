        "text": "Far from being a genre piece, a rereading of the myth of Salome, or a timeworn figure of Fin-de-siècle literature, the show performed by the American dancer in Sá-Carneiro’s A Confissão de Lúcio is imbued with modernity and conspicuous openly lesbian content. In response to Oscar Wilde’s Salome, revisited by Strauss in his opera, Sá-Carneiro has chosen to downplay mythical references by bringing to the page lifelike individuals who mirror his contemporaries, namely the living artists of his time who created a rush of novelty through their Art and whose sexuality overturned heteronormativity. By presenting at the beginning of his novella a female character, who is emancipated from patriarchy and compulsory heterosexuality, Sá-Carneiro adopts resolutely modern authorial posturing."
