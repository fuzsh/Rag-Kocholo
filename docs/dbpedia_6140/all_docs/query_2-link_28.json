        "text": "II\n\nLisbon. Lisboa antigua. Lisboa, velha cidade, / Cheia de encanto e beleza⁴!\n\nA harbour. Enchantments.\n\nThe odours nourished an ambiguous imagination. A nose for ancient waters. The sense of smell, then. Remembering a childhood in Trieste. Sea and salt air. Duino was then in his heart. A manor house corroded by time. White, skeletal, dried by the sun. Progenitor of imperial deaths. The ocean is another thing. Gusts of an Atlantic wind. Gazing at conquered lands. Lisbon.\n\nA silent, melancholy morning. Looking around. Anxiously yielding to disquiet. Worn embankments breaking up soft backwashes. Beyond them a boundless ocean. The harbour was a certain refuge. Solitude and past songs.\n\n\"Juncada de rosmaninho / Se o meu amor vier cedinho / Eu beijo as pedras do chão / Que ele pisar no caminho.⁵\"\n\nThe voice of Maria Severa Onofriana⁶? The lady of the ‘fado’. She knew how to play the guitar magnificently. Strings parallel to the sound box. To then abandon life at the age of 26. Tuberculosis is a killer. \"O gosto que tinha o Fado, / Tudo com ela acabou.⁷\" Rest in peace Maria Severa Onofriana, there in the cemetery of Alto de São João. Lisbon. Her voice is still lost in pregnant melancholies.\n\nMemories drawn from a Baedeker. LEIPZIG, 1912. Cm. 16 x 11.5, pp. LVI, 508. Bound in full red cloth. Being flogged by nostalgic flavours that belonged only to time. Perhaps to a past. Forgetting. Rhythmic steps and now finding an unusual and pretentious magazine purchased from a shabby newsagent.\n\nOrpheu 2.\n\nAbril-Maio-Junho, 1915. Revista trimestal de Literatura. Propriedade de: Orpheu, L.de. Editor: António Ferro. Endereço: Luís de Montalvor al 17 de Comibho de Forno do Tijolo Lisboa. Tipografia: Tipografia de Comércio. 10, Rua da Oliveira Carmo – Telefono 2724. Lisboa.\n\nGood printing, excellent paper, with the singular collaboration of the Futurist painter Santa-Rita Pintor. A pseudonym. Guilherme de Santa Rita was his real name. Eccentric with his sensibilità mechanica, sensibilità lithographica, sensibilità radiographica, interseccionismo plastico. The texts then. Here is the list of authors. Fernando Pessoa, Mário de Sá-Carneiro, Ângelo de Lime, Luís de Montalvor.\n\nA quick glance.\n\nFingers hungrily flipping through the pages. Pages tousled by the wind. Pausing from time to time. Recalling Pessoa. \"E a sombra duma nau mais antiga que o porto que passa / Entre o meu sonho do porto e o meu ver esta paisagem / E chega ao pé de mim, e entra por mim dentro / E passa para o outro lado da minha alma…⁸\"\n\nIt seemed then that one could be enriched by controversial knowledge. Moving beyond any physicality. Perfidiously dissolving any psychic distress. Pungent cerebral sensitivity. Pessoa, in fact. Seductive emotions. The unconscious distracted. Gazing in mirrors that reflected imprecise images.\n\nOnly for Pessoa or also for some of his singular friends? New, symbolic and intuitive forms of knowledge. Thus intertwining memories, paradigms and erudite readings in a cruelly ambiguous manner. Also, pleasant and unpleasant mish-mashes. Yielding to regrets and consolations. Half-closing one’s eyes. Wandering with the mind. Mnemonic journeys? Better to dwell on the annotations. Better than many foolish pastimes and naive distractions. Meanwhile the waters of the harbour seemed motionless.\n\nBehind now, the Bugio Lighthouse. Imposing sentry at the entrance to the estuary.\n\nThe Tejo, the river, appeared ever more alluring. A place of eternal and melancholy loneliness. The river gracefully widened and narrowed, providing appropriate landing spots. Briefly a flat stretch greeted a steep hill marked by a jumble of old buildings. Terracotta rooftops. The ‘lioz’ limestone gave luminosity to the buildings with its gradations. From grey to yellowish to pink.\n\nThe pier, meanwhile, was wide and burdened with confused noises. Also with a dense, uninterrupted chatter. Galician inflections marked by time. Also several British ships at anchor which certainly noted the names of the German ships being resupplied. Suddenly the commotion of carts pulled by yoked mules. Doca da Alfândega, in fact, where the steamships of the Societé Torlades arriving from Bordeaux were docked. Then the gloomy customs building. Nearby in a vast basin were boats of some Companhia de Pescarias, crowded together displaying hulls and towering masts. Here and there several muleta with their large sail, or several Barco Rabelo with a square sail, or a sotovento with slender silhouette. Among the many boats, also the double sails of some dories.\n\nThe sky was a sly light blue in the haze of a sweltering day. Filamentous cirrus clouds were knotted on high without however providing any shelter from the blinding light of a full scorching sun. Every so often the reflections wounded the eyes scanning the surroundings. A hand occasionally acted as a dauntless visor so that one’s vision did not suffer accidental injuries.\n\nNot far away were rails set in a double row on which rattled some ‘carro electrico a dois troleys’ that threw out sparks in clusters almost as if they were shooting stars. Rarely there passed a few silent horse-drawn ‘americanos’. The people, meanwhile, were quick to chase either the ‘carro’ or the ‘americano’, always uncertain where to await them. For 30 réis one could travel through the entire city.\n\nOn one side, shoeshine boys were busy at their craft, quartered along a facade of low buildings amidst footrest boxes equipped with an arsenal of brushes and polishes of all types and colours. Also crippled beggars eagerly asking for some réis while displaying deformities due to injuries suffered in rash jobs or to war wounds. Then sellers of precarious junk. Crowded benches along roads suffering under a torrid heat. Even dirty capilé vendors anxious to extend, for one real, that refreshing blend of barley coffee, sugar, lemon and cool water.\n\nWas this the people that had practised and still practised a bold and brazen piracy? Were these the ravenous filibusters of the seas scattered well beyond the horizon?\n\nThis is what was recounted by those fearing the Lusitanians. Books also informed that the piratical voyages of the Portuguese were deemed necessary to satisfy ambitions of conquest and trade. Targeted piracies. Also organised violence. Spices and slave trade. The Portuguese, in fact. And Pessoa and his friends?\n\nHistory often taught that knowledge could be biased. Remembrances suspended in memory. Distant seas, it’s true. Who remembered? Cidade do Nome de Deus, de Macau, Não há outra mais Leal⁹.\n\nMacau overlooking the China Sea. It was also reflected in the branch of the Si Kiang river. Thus began a terrifying colonial adventure. Pope Nicholas V was its singular apostle since he advocated the perpetual slavery of the indigenous peoples. Dum Diversas was the Papal Bull of 16 June 1452 that accompanied the Divino amore communiti of King Afonso V of Portugal. Assigning without delay all human and inhuman rights.\n\nWith the apostolic authority of this edict, we grant you the full and free power to capture and subjugate the Saracens and pagans, as well as other infidels and enemies of Christ, whoever they are and wherever they dwell; to take all types of assets, movable or immovable, which are in possession of these same Saracens, pagans, infidels and enemies of Christ … Incontestable words.\n\nHence they began to organise military expeditions against the Muslims. To prepare a placet in reducing the natives to perpetual captivity. Otherwise it was appropriate to convert them, turn them into docile Catholics. Or into domesticated servants. Placet, placet as the Bible invited with ineluctable words: \"Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the forward.¹⁰\"\n\nNisi conversi fueritis et efficiamini sicut parvuli, non intrabitis in regnum caelorum¹¹.\n\nIt happened first at Gôa Dourada¹², on the Arabian Sea. The Jesuits did what, it was supposed, it was legitimate and necessary to do. Forced evangelisation became an ineluctable necessity and a mission became a place of religious government for the explorations. A viceroy then left a mark on that land facing the sea. To control maritime traffic. To administer the dominions. From the Persian Gulf to India and the Far East. The evangelisers thus became apostles of excellent efficiency.\n\nRegrets?\n\nMuch more convenient to control the routes of commerce and the commerce itself. Spices and slaves.\n\nEver since Vasco da Gama. Commendable intuition to bring a Jesuit with him. Adequate subjugations provided edifying examples. A good excuse. Defeat the infidels. He who loved a spice so much, pepper for example, had a valid excuse to engage in wars of conquest. Thus trade became a profitable art. Naval force. From East Africa to the Indian Ocean. From the Atlantic Ocean to West Africa. Not at all discontent, with sordid justification, to be accompanied by Jesuit missionaries because they were auspices of holy missions.\n\nDistinguishable signs of absolute powers. It then became a mandatory requirement, as it was possible to read in any history of voyages beyond the Pillars of Hercules. Was it then necessary to update the Baedeker? A controversial choice if one recalled the writings of Giovanni Battista Ramusio¹³.\n\nVoyage to India on behalf of Giovanni da Empoli.\n\nGiovanni wrote: \"I believe without a doubt that, with God’s help, not only will the most serene King of Portugal acquire great honour and wealth, but I also dare to say that, in the space of 50 years, there will be converted many people, whom God will grant his infinite grace.\"\n\nBrutal conquests, no doubt.\n\nThus the mind pursued tales of massacres and extorted riches. It is good to look around. To forget past readings?\n\nThe sea, then. Also, a shoreline. Undertows. Placid waves lapping into themselves.\n\nThe Tejo River came down from Fuente de Garcia. However, they were other waters that died meekly in a vast delta. The men who governed did not know the pleasure of those waters. Private business. Obscure cabals. Portugal. Meanwhile, Bernardino Luís Machado Guimarães the Republican decided the fate of the country. It was rumoured that he was a wealthy merchant, necessarily noble. Conquered wealth. And if they were only ambiguous rumours?\n\nThe coast was sandy and punctuated here and there by natural cliffs. David Mondine observed it with surprising wonder.\n\nMeanwhile, one could read in the newspapers that the government had begun to recruit an expeditionary force. With reluctance, certainly! Europe was at war. Do not antagonise those who should not be antagonised. Obligatory choice. Imposed perhaps?\n\nSiding with the Triple Entente¹⁴. Thus sending two infantry divisions and one infantry battalion on bicycles and one of sappers. In total about 55,000 men. Western Front. Directing them into the Corpo Expedicionário Português. Also, nine artillery batteries with guns and howitzers of 75, 105 and 155 mm. Only ten cargo ships. No warship. Better not to frequent the seas, thus avoiding a clash with the German Kaiserliche Marine, with the Austro-Hungarian k.u.k. Kriegsmarine and with the Ottoman Osmanlı Donanması.\n\nA bizarre appearance of the sea, observed David Mondine.\n\nMeanwhile, his memory tried to recall some distant ocean. Readings. Remembering the occasion when he saw the reports by Amerigo Vespucci, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón and Pedro Alvares Cabral or the letters by Martim Afonso de Sousa. Wretched shores where slave ships would have docked. Remembering what he had read. Remembering Angola when the king N’Gola reigned over the Mbundu.\n\nIn fact, the Atlantic had encouraged the landings. The ocean thus became a safe route to deport men. It was not enough to take ivory, rubber, spices from those lands. Human trade was more profitable. To repopulate the Americas. The Atlantic was not always benevolent. There were even tragic deaths. Storms and battered ships. Shipwrecks duly taken into account. The lifeboats were reserved for white men. Slaves in chains, fed with some frugal bowls of beans, corn and potatoes. The water ration was half a pint a day. Encouraging natural selection. From the market to the sales counter. Slaves at auction. Good business because the trade was profitable and sumptuous. Slavery soon became a sought-after practice. Pombeiros e fumantes¹⁵ obtained substantial benefits.\n\nA piece of paper was drawn from the hefty envelope received from Mr Angus Craston. Thus David Mondine had the opportunity to read some eccentric verses that this Mário de Sá-Carneiro had composed. Perhaps in 1914.\n\n\"Eu não sou eu nem sou o outro / Sou qualquer coisa de intermédio: / Pilar de ponte de tédio / Que-vai de mim pasra o Outro.¹⁶\"\n\nSomething must have been weighing on Mário Sá-Carneiro’s mind. A prelude or an amen?\n\nTravelling along the treacherous roads of life. A sign of immoral restlessness. Dying civilly or uncivilly after having rolled the dice that had marked loves and hates, tenacity and indecision, rebellion and surrender.\n\nAlso facing other possible unfortunate meditations. Seeking refuge in a dreamlike unawareness. David Mondine began to scrutinise the sea. Stolen memories in an agitated unconsciousness. Becoming lost. A unique beauty: so it seemed. The chatter subjugated the wishes of the glances. Interpreting the murmuring with the wise annotations of a Baedeker. Also, irritating interjections. Thinking about something else. Unpleasant memories of the conquests in Africa. And Fernando Pessoa?\n\nCertain news. Why had he lived in Durban? A British colony. Natal. Sugarcane plantations, so it seemed. Blacks and Indians. The English had a strong preference for the Indians. The gulf that opened in front of Durban led straight to India. Forced colonisation. Then war between whites. Gold and diamonds were very appealing. No one held the salaried slaves of the plantations in high esteem.\n\nDid Fernando feel shame and impropriety?\n\nPerhaps he had something else to think about. Aspiring not to the probable but to the incredible. Adolescence seemed to be the time of thoughtlessness. Not even the sea could be a safe haven. Ships docked and departed laden with mineral treasures and wealthy men. Someone came to terms with his anxieties when he had the feeling of being able to converse with an alter-ego. An unpleasant story.\n\nAlthough burdened with dark thoughts, David Mondine thought it appropriate to analyse as best possible the task assigned to him, even though he was troubled by a listless insecurity.\n\nGusts of wind.\n\nRethinking the events of which he had become aware. Neurasthenic disorders and unusual behaviours. Undoubtedly lettered men. Poetic ones, rather. Arrogantly revolutionary poets? Poets afflicted by neurotic lives. Relying on their mysterious unconsciousnesses? And what about their sluggardly manias? Or their restless wandering? Or the claustrophobic solitudes? Analysing profiles and declared ailments.\n\nConsulting valuable and partially exhaustive booklets. Appropriate needs. Precious remnants recovered from a bookseller’s"
