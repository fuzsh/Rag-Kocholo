Professors of the most important centers of social sciences in Brazil at the time (Escola Livre de Sociologia e PolÃ­tica/ELSP - Free School of Sociology and Politics, Â and Faculdade de Filosofia CiÃªncias e Letras/USP- Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Florestan and Oracy reveal different perspectives on the relationship between race and class. While in Fernandesâs work race was subsumed under class, Nogueira saw an intersection of race and class in which racial disparities could not be explained by social inequalities alone. Thus the UNESCO research called attention to differing interpretations of Brazilian racism.\n\nProf. Oscar Vogt (1927 - 2014)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWachter, Peter\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOn 21st. Jan. 2014 Oscar Vogt left us. Born in 1927, he lived a long and fulfilling life. One of us (PW) first met Oscar Vogt and his wife Ditta in 1962, when we both investigated in the Laboratorium fÃ¼r FestkÃ¶rperphysik of ETH ZÃ¼rich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) the magnetic properties of rare-earth compounds. Oscar was a son of the owner of Vogt and Co. (VoCo), a wire-fabrication company, which could also make exotic wires like tungsten. He received his PhD at ETH ZÃ¼rich with Prof G. Busch, who When his father died in the 1970s, Oscar faced a choice â physics or the family business. He managed both! Every Monday he spent in the Institute, and with his competent technical assistant Kurt Mattenberger, grew large and welldefined single crystals of rare-earth compounds and investigated their magnetic properties. The production of crystals was especially challenging as these compounds melt only near 2000 Â°C, and special tungsten crucibles had to be maintained at g , mentioned that he was the only graduate student not asking for payment. He enjoyed interesting hobbies and was much involved in cultural activities. He engaged himself with great enthusiasm, initially in the research of rareearth compounds, and then later in the actinides.We had a long-lasting and fruitful friendship\n\nOSCAR4: a flexible architecture for chemical text-mining\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJessop David M\n\n2011-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract The Open-Source Chemistry Analysis Routines (OSCAR software, a toolkit for the recognition of named entities and data in chemistry publications, has been developed since 2002. Recent work has resulted in the separation of the core OSCAR functionality and its release as the OSCAR4 library. This library features a modular API (based on reduction of surface coupling that permits client programmers to easily incorporate it into external applications.

The OSCAR API has been developed by Waseda University in collaboration with Fujitsu Laboratory, Hitachi, NEC, Panasonic, Renesas Technology, and Toshiba in an METI/NEDO project entitled \"Multicore Technology for Realtime Consumer Electronics.\" By using the OSCAR API as an interface between the OSCAR compiler and backend compilers, the OSCAR compiler enables hierarchical multigrain parallel processing with memory optimization under capacity restriction for cache memory, local memory, distributed shared memory, and on-chip/off-chip shared memory; data transfer using a DMA controller; and power reduction control using DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling), clock gating, and power gating for various embedded multicores. In addition, a parallelized program automatically generated by the OSCAR compiler with OSCAR API can be compiled by the ordinary OpenMP compilers since the OSCAR API is designed on a subset of the OpenMP. This paper describes the OSCAR API and its compatibility with the OSCAR compiler by showing code examples. Performance evaluations of the OSCAR compiler and the OSCAR API are carried out using an IBM Power5+ workstation, an IBM Power6 high-end SMP server, and a newly developed consumer electronics multicore chip RP2 by Renesas, Hitachi and Waseda. From the results of scalability evaluation, it is found that on an average, the OSCAR compiler with the OSCAR API can exploit 5.8 times speedup over the sequential execution on the Power5+ workstation with eight cores and 2.9 times speedup on RP2 with four cores, respectively. In addition, the OSCAR compiler can accelerate an IBM XL Fortran compiler up to 3.3 times on the Power6 SMP server. Due to low-power optimization on RP2, the OSCAR compiler with the OSCAR API\n\nOSCAR-4 Code System Application to the SAFARI-1 Reactor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nStander, Gerhardt; Prinsloo, Rian H.; Tomasevic, Djordje I.; Mueller, Erwin\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe OSCAR reactor calculation code system consists of a two-dimensional lattice code, the three-dimensional nodal core simulator code MGRAC and related service codes. The major difference between the new version of the OSCAR system, OSCAR-4, and its predecessor, OSCAR-3, is the new version of MGRAC which contains many new features and model enhancements. In this work some of the major improvements in the nodal diffusion solution method, history tracking, nuclide transmutation and cross section models are described. As part of the validation process of the OSCAR-4 code system (specifically the new MGRAC version), some of the new models are tested by comparing computational results to SAFARI-1 reactor plant data for a number of operational cycles and for varying applications. A specific application of the new features allows correct modeling of, amongst others, the movement of fuel-follower type control rods and dynamic in-core irradiation schedules. It is found that the effect of the improved control rod model, applied over multiple cycles of the SAFARI-1 reactor operation history, has a significant effect on in-cycle reactivity prediction and fuel depletion.

This paper focuses on Oscar Wilde and Wildeâs numerous works. Aestheticism was used as a tool by the dandy in his rebellious performances in London, manifesting the contradiction between the spiritual and the material, the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, and art and nature. The social backgrounds and life experiences of Wilde influenced his transformation into dandies during the time of the Victorian period. With his strong sense of fashion and style, and their elegant ironic use of language, the dandies focused on the importance of artificial forms - himself included â in daily life and work. The dandiesâ concern was pleasure seeking through consuming the visual and actual. To this end Wilde developed unique aesthetic theories regarding evil; he looked for the beautiful in the ugly and repulsive. At the same time, Oscar Wilde criticized the hypocrisy of bourgeois morality and values, showing the genuinely ugly and evil reality beneath bourgeois industrial society, and focusing on revolt and resistance against the bourgeois world.

Through various forms of semi-biographical novels and other narratives, they have, from that time forward, been enjoying a pampered life in a new genre called âthe author-as-characterâ (Franssen and Hoenselaars 1999 or âauthor fictionsâ (Savu 2009 that reanimate them or conjure them up in a present that constantly seeks to reassert its link with the past. This is particularly true of Oscar Wildeâs life, for his disparate and colourful personality has been time and again re-appropriated in recent fiction. This article focuses on three of these contemporary fictional depictions: an epistolary novel, an epistolary website and a fictional interview, all three dealing with a fictionalised Oscar Wilde conversing with a contemporary author who is also an interviewer in his or her own way and right. Because they are very close to each other in terms of narration (i.e. impersonation and pastiche and subject, putting words in Wildeâs mouth as though they were his own, The Unauthorized Letters of Oscar Wilde, the website Dialogus, and Coffee with Oscar Wilde, represent three fascinating means of exploring how Oscarâs rebirth as a man and author actually takes place. Among the numerous fictional portraits of Oscar Wilde, I have thus chosen to pay particular attention to the depictions that are well anchored in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and which do not, therefore, display a narrative that would merely take place during the fin de siÃ¨cle, with only period-style people in period costume. By contrast, the three portraits are literal time-travelling narratives that endeavour to bridge the gap between past, present and future.\n\nThe Feasibility of \"oscar\" as AN Information System for Sustainable Rehabilitation of Built Heritage\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFarmer, C.; Rouillard, C.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis paper aims to examine the feasibility of the Online Sustainable Conservation Assistance Resource (OSCAR) as an information system and framework to help find appropriate ways to improve the sustainable performance of heritage buildings in North America. The paper reviews the need for holistic comprehensive authoritative information in the field of sustainable conservation, how OSCAR addresses this gap, the OSCAR workflow, and how it was used in two case studies. It was found that OSCAR has potential to become a practical educational tool and design aide to address the sustainable performance of heritage buildings. The paper contributes to the discourse on sustainable conservation by examining resources and tools which address the need for holistic retrofit approaches. The findings will be useful to educators and professionals in the fields of sustainable design and heritage conservation.\n\nAasta moekunstnik on Oscar de la Renta\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2000-01-01\n\nNew Yorgis American Fashion Awards tseremoonial jagati auhindu: aasta parim naisterÃµivaste kujundaja Oscar de La Renta, parim meesteriiete looja Helmut Lang, elutÃ¶Ã¶ preemia itaalia moekunstnik Valentinole, rahvusvahelise moekunsti auhind Jean Paul Gaultier'ile\n\nAbortamento de frutos da nogueira macadÃ¢mia sob influÃªncia da adubaÃ§Ã£o mineral\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarcos JosÃ© PerdonÃ¡\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFull Text Available A nogueira macadÃ¢mia (Macadamia integrifolia apresenta elevada taxa de abortamento de frutos.

Therefore, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that control the corrosion product transfer is of the highest importance. Since the 1970's, the R and D strategy in France has been based on experiments in test loops representative of PWR conditions, on in-situ gamma spectrometry measurements of the PWR primary system contamination and on simulation code development. The simulation of corrosion product transfers in PWR primary circuits is a major challenge since it involves many physical and chemical phenomena including: corrosion, dissolution, precipitation, erosion, deposition, convection, activation... In addition to the intrinsic difficulty of multi-physics modelling, the primary systems present severe operating conditions (300 deg. C, 150 bar, neutron flux, fluid velocity up to 15 m.s -1 and very low corrosion product concentrations). The purpose of the OSCAR code, developed by the CEA in cooperation with EDF and AREVA NP, is to predict the PWR primary system contamination by corrosion and fission products. The OSCAR code is considered to be not only a tool for numerical simulations and predictions (operational practices improvements and new-built PWRs design) but also one that might combine and organise all new knowledge useful to progress on contamination. The OSCAR code for Products of Corrosion, OSCAR PC, allows researchers to analyse the corrosion product behaviour and to calculate the ACP volume and surface activities of the primary and auxiliary systems. In the new version, OSCAR PC V1.2, the corrosion product transfer in the particulate form is enhanced and a new feature is the possibility to simulate cold shutdowns. In order to validate this version, the contamination transfer has been simulated in 5 French PWRs with different operating and\n\nOscar Wilde and Authorialism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndrea Selleri\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This essay introduces the concept of âauthorialismâ to characterise the critical orientation that sees literary works primarily as actions on the part of their authors rather than as linguistic objects, using the early reception of Oscar Wildeâs works as a case study. It is argued that authorialism was the dominant tendency in 1875-1900 Anglophone criticism, and that it has characterised assessments of Wildeâs works to this day. The method has the advantage of finding coherence in literary works, which is useful in assessing matters of value; the textual features of Wildeâs writings, however, resist authorialist readings by not featuring the expected coherence.\n\nA tribute to Oscar Buneman -- Pioneer of plasma simulation\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBuneman, R.; Barker, R.J.

Emphasis is placed not only on ''what'' this pioneer of computational plasma physics contributed but, of equal importance, on ''how'' he made his contributions. Therein lies the difference between technical competence and scientific greatness. The picture which emerges illustrates the open-mindedness, enthusiasm, intellectual/physical stamina, imagination, intellectual integrity, interdisciplinary curiosity, and deep humanity that made this individual unique. As a gentleman and a scholar, he had mastered the art of making cold technical facts ''come to life.'' Oscar Buneman died peacefully at his home near Stanford University on Sunday, January 24th, 1993.

Wilde, indeed, seemed to embrace opposite stances in relation to consumerism as it is witnessed by such works as Â«The Soul of Man Under SocialismÂ» and The Picture of Dorian Gray, on the one side, and Â«The Decay of LyingÂ», Lady Windermere's Fan and An Ideal Husband, on the other. This essay also reads Wilde's last play The Importance of Being Earnest in terms of a Â«performance about performanceÂ», rooted as Wilde's previous plays in consumer culture and capable of deconstructing the Victorian highly normative (and 'rational' approach to gender and, in particular, to masculinity.\n\n\"VargamÃ¤e kuningriik\". \"Oscar ja Roosamamma.

They developed a realistic model to analyze alternative spill response strategies. The model represented the formation and composition of the water-accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil for both treated and untreated oil spills. As many as 25 components, pseudo-components, or metabolites were allowed for the specification of oil. Calculations effected using OSCAR were verified in great detail on numerous occasions. The model made it possible to determine rather realistically the dissolution, transformation, and toxicology of dispersed oil clouds, as well as evaporation, emulsification, and natural dispersion. OSCAR comprised a data-based oil weathering model, a three-dimensional oil trajectory and chemical fates model, an oil spill combat model, exposure models for birds, marine mammals, fish and ichthyoplankton. 17 refs., 1 tab., 11 figs\n\nOSCAR experiment high-density network data report: Event 3 - April 16-17, 1981\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDana, M.T.; Easter, R.C.; Thorp, J.M.\n\n1984-12-01\n\nThe OSCAR (Oxidation and Scavenging Characteristics of April Rains) experiment, conducted during April 1981, was a cooperative field investigation of wet removal in cyclonic storm systems.

In an attempt to explain this unconventional phenomenon in the fairy tale tradition, this essay examines Wilde's stories through the lens of his aesthetic ideology and demonstrates how the superficial morality of the Victorian bourgeoisie corrodes each tale's aesthetic integrity, causing the characters to either deny morality outright, assume the guise of Christian philanthropy, or die as the result of their moral reformation.\n\nEvaluation of the Operational Stress Control and Readiness (OSCAR) Program\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2015-01-01\n\nshould receive training to fill the role of OSCAR team member.

SAFARI-1 is a multi-purpose reactor and is used for the production of radioisotopes through in-core sample irradiation. The Radiation and Reactor Theory (RRT) Section of Necsa supports SAFARI-1 operations with nuclear engineering analyses which include core-reload design, core-follow and radiation transport analyses. The primary computer codes that are used for the analyses are the OSCAR-4 nodal diffusion core simulator and the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP. RRT has developed a calculation methodology based on OSCAR-4 and MCNP to simulate the diverse in-core irradiation conditions in SAFARI-1, for the purpose of radioisotope production. In this paper we present the OSCAR-4/MCNP calculation methodology and the software tools that were developed for rapid and reliable construction of MCNP analysis models. The paper will present the application and accuracy of the methodology for the production of yttrium-90 ( 90 Y) and will include comparisons between calculation results and experimental measurements. The paper will also present sensitivity analyses that were performed to determine the effects of control rod bank position, representation of core depletion state and sample loading configuration, on the calculated 90 Y sample activity.

The application of DINEOF method, proved to provide relative success in various experimental trials (Wang and Liu, 2013; Nikolaidis et al., 2013;2014), and tends to be an effective and computationally affordable solution, on the problem of data reconstruction, for missing data from geophysical fields, such as chlorophyll-a, sea surface temperatures or salinity and geophysical fields derived from satellite data. Implementation of this method in a GIS system will provide with a more complete, integrated approach, permitting the expansion of the applicability over various aspects. This may be especially useful in studies where various data of different kind, have to be examined. For this purpose, in this study we have implemented and present a GIS toolbox that aims to automate the usage of the algorithm, incorporating the DINEOF codes provided by GHER (GeoHydrodynamics and Environment Research Group of University of Liege) into the ArcGISÂ®. ArcGISÂ® is a well known standard on Geographical Information Systems, used over the years for various remote sensing procedures, in sea and land environment alike. A case-study of filling the missing satellite derived current data in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea area, for a monthly period is analyzed, as an example for the effectiveness and simplicity of the usage of this toolbox. The specific study focuses to OSCAR satellite data (http://www.oscar.noaa.gov/) collected by NOAA/NESDIS Operational Surface Current Processing and Data Center, from the respective products of OSCAR Project Office Earth and Space Research organization, that provides free online access to unfiltered (1/3 degree) resolution. All the 5-day mean products data coverage were successfully reconstructed. KEY WORDS: Remote Sensing, Cyprus\n\nOscar Wilde and the brain cell.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCohn, Elisha\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis chapter considers Oscar Wilde's interest in the brain cell as an aesthetic object. Offering an account of Wilde's career that analyzes his early interest in physiology and philosophy, this chapter argues that Wilde's uniquely aesthetic take on the brain suggests that he rejects an account of the self as autonomous or self-determining. For many late Victorians brain science threatened both the freedom of human action and the legitimacy of beauty because it had the potential to invalidate conscious experience. But writers whose work Wilde knew, like John Ruskin, W. K. Clifford, and John Tyndall, avoided the despair of materialism by using aesthetic terms in their own discussions of life's invisible materials. Wilde's art collaborates with the contemporary sciences. His depictions of the cell direct the senses to a new field of being that emphasizes the molecular life all humans have in common, in which individual responsibility and activity matter less than the necessity of beauty.

We know that one of his major works, Die Methode, the first volume of his Ãlteren kulturperioden im Orient und in Europa, translated into Chinese in the 1930s, had considerable influence on generations of Chinese archaeologists and art historians. What has previously remained unknown, is that Montelius personally promoted the research undertaken in China by Johan Gunnar Andersson (1874â1960, whose discoveries of Neolithic cultures in the 1920s constituted the breakthrough and starting point for the development of prehistoric archaeology in China. In this paper, we reproduce, translate and discuss a long forgotten memorandum written by Montelius in 1920 in support of Anderssonâs research. In this Montelius indicated his belief in the potential of prehistoric Chinese archaeology as well as his predictions regarding the discoveries about to be made. It is therefore an important document for the study of the history of Chinese archaeology as a whole.\n\nHacia una configuraciÃ³n de lugares sin territorios en The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMagdalena Lopez\n\n2015-06-01\n\nBased on the distinction proposed by Glissant between territory and place, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao proposes a fictionalization of the idea of place. The places become are as where the references that âsetâ territories are decoded and the process of rootlessness of identity categories occurs. However, the categories are not completely annulled. Places respond to an anthropophagic practice in which different territories (geographical, racial, economic, linguistic, sexual, temporal and aesthetic persist, but recycled under a permanent unresolved tension. Such a phenomenon articulates a new form of cultural centerless anthropophagy in the loser character. Oscar is a loser that has been expelled from the logic of the capitalist profit. His symbolic-political recycling does not pretend to erect new territories or binaries rearrangements, but to transform through rootlessness his old territories into the new places.\n\nAwareness tool for safe and responsible driving (OSCAR): a potential educational intervention for increasing interest, openness and knowledge about the abilities required and compensatory strategies among older drivers.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLevasseur, MÃ©lanie; Audet, ThÃ©rÃ¨se; GÃ©linas, Isabelle; BÃ©dard, Michel; Langlais, Marie-Ãve; Therrien, France-HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Renaud, Judith; Coallier, Jean-Claude; D'Amours, Monia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis pilot study aimed to verify the impact of the awareness tool for safe and responsible driving (OSCAR) on older adults' (1) interest, openness, and knowledge about the abilities and compensatory strategies required for safe driving; (2) awareness of changes that have occurred in their own driving abilities; and (3) actual utilization of compensatory strategies. A preexperimental design, including a pretest (T0) and posttest (T1) 8 to 10 weeks after exposure to the intervention, was used with 48 drivers aged between 67 and 84. The participants had a valid driving license and drove at least once a week. Overall, the results demonstrate that OSCAR increased interest, openness, and knowledge about the abilities and compensatory strategies of older drivers (P driving, OSCAR also improved awareness of the changes that could negatively impact safe driving and enhanced utilization of compensatory strategies. While promoting safe driving and the prevention of crashes and injuries, this intervention could ultimately help older adults maintain or increase their transportation mobility. More studies are needed to further evaluate OSCAR and identify ways to improve its effectiveness.\n\nL'infelicitÃ del principe felice.

This article aims to explore the relationship between Landolfi and Oscar Wilde by comparing Landolfiâs Favola (1938 and Il principe infelice (1943 with a selection of Wildeâs short stories included in the collections Happy Prince and Other Tales (1888 and A House of Pomegranates (1891.\n\nThe Lessons Oscar Taught Us: Data Science and Media & Entertainment.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGold, Michael; McClarren, Ryan; Gaughan, Conor\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFarsite Group, a data science firm based in Columbus, Ohio, launched a highly visible campaign in early 2013 to use predictive analytics to forecast the winners of the 85th Annual Academy Awards. The initiative was fun and exciting for the millions of Oscar viewers, but it also illustrated how data science could be further deployed in the media and entertainment industries. This article explores the current and potential use cases for big data and predictive analytics in those industries. It further discusses how the Farsite Forecast was built, as well as how the model was iterated, how the projections performed, and what lessons were learned in the process.\n\nNutrient Concentrations collected from OSCAR ELTON SETTE in North Pacific Ocean from 2008-03-01 to 2011-04-30\n\nData.gov (United States)\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce â Laboratory analysis of water samples collected aboard the NOAA Ship Oscar Elton Sette along a 158W transect from 26-36N in the central North Pacific.

Created and headed by Oscar Marin and the author, in affiliation with the University of Oregon, the lab brought together students, fellows, and visiting experts in neurology, psychology, psychiatry, neuropsychology, neurobiology, neurophysiology, and computation. Their patient-focused collaborations produced groundbreaking research in language and its disorders, bradyphrenia, neglect, cerebellar function and impairment, and the psychology of music. The lab hosted the meeting that they documented in the influential 1985 book Attention and Performance XI: Mechanisms of Attention. The lab's members have gone on to lead distinguished careers and continue making major contributions to cognitive neuroscience.\n\nLIBROS Y LECTORES EN EL PANORAMA FINISECULAR: J.K.

Huysmans and The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde. Written in a flowering period of the printed word, typographic modernization and emergence of the great reading public, both novels show the fight of the elites for keeping a symbolic capital. In the face of an increasing diversity and democratization of the reading public, the decadent hero needs to overact his features of distinction to keep the distance from the masses and the bourgeoisie. This exaggerated refinement is clearly seen in the materials used by the protagonists, their purposes and reading approach.\n\nVertaalstrategieÃ« na aanleiding van Oscar Wilde se The picture of Dorian Gray\n\nOpenAIRE\n\n2009-01-01\n\nM.A. The life and work of Oscar Wilde are characterised by ambivalence and paradox. In certain of his works he identifies with the moral codes pertaining to the Victorian era and in others he satirizes, and even rejects, the existing morality. The translator of Wildeâs literary works is confronted with numerous contextual and textual challenges, for example how to translate the moral codes of the Victorian era in a manner that will be relevant to an Afrikaans readership and how to do justi...\n\nInduced reproduction and early development histology of Oscar Astronotus ocellatus (Agassiz, 1831).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPaes, Maria do Carmo Faria; Makino, Lilian Cristina; Vasquez, Leonardo AvendaÃ±o; Fernandes, JoÃ£o Batista Kochenborger; Valentin, Fernanda Nogueira; Nakaghi, Laura Satiko Okada\n\n2015-04-01\n\nOscar (Astronotus ocellatus) is an important fish from the Amazon Basin that has great potential for fish farming, human consumption, sport fishing and fish keeping. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two hormonal treatments on the induction of artificial reproduction in broodstock and to describe the histological development of embryos and larvae. Broodstocks were selected and induced using two different hormones: (i) extract of carp pituitary (ECP); and (ii) synthetic human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Spawnings were transferred to hatcheries, collected at pre-established times, processed and analysed by histology. Astronotus ocellatus did not respond well to induced reproduction. From 16 couples of breeding fish, only five out of the eight females released oocytes after the hormonal action time, three with hCG and two with ECP; just one male responded positively to hCG. Oscar eggs were oval, and semi-adhesive, the yolk contained granules, and egg diameter was approximately 1.65 Â± 0.057 to 1.98 Â± 0.038 mm. Development from the initial collection (IC) point until the total absorption of the yolk lasted 315 h, at an average temperature of 27.45 Â± 2.13Â°C. Several events marked embryonic and larval development, including the formation of the optic cup, forebrain, otic vesicle and cephalic divisions. The newly hatched larvae had non-pigmented eyes, and a closed mouth and anus, as well as the presence of adhesive glands on the head. Larval development was characterized by formation of the heart, liver, gaseous bladder, gills, pronephros, brain, fins and also the digestive tract. These results provide important information for the rearing and reproduction of A. ocellatus.\n\nA relaÃ§Ã£o entre pintura e literatura em O Retrato de Dorian Gray de Oscar Wilde\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria Imaculada Cavalcante\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This article aims at examining therelationship between literature and painting,seeking to understand the process ofconstruction of the novel and spacerepresentation of the painting in The picture ofDorian Gray (1891, from the Irish writer OscarWilde, under the influence of the avant-gardemovements that emerged in the nineteenthcentury, especially Impressionism and Fauvism.\n\nWhispers of the Unspeakable: New York and Montreal Newspaper Coverage of the Oscar Wilde Trials in 1895\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGreg Robinson\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Greg Robinsonâs article âWhispers of the Unspeakable: New York and Montreal Newspaper Coverage of the Oscar Wilde Trials in 1895,â originally published in 2010 in the French-language journal Rue des Beaux Arts, no. 24 (2010, is here republished andâwith much gratitudeâtranslated (for the original text, please see http://www.oscholars.com/RBA/twenty-four/24.7/Articles.htm. Robinsonâs transnational study focuses on how reading the specific language of newspaper reports of the Oscar Wilde case, literally from a distance, from places less emotionally attached to and nationally distinct from the scandalâs epicenter in London, England, provides insight into âthe state of everyday public knowledge and discussion of (homosexuality, at least west of the Atlanticâ; thus Robinsonâs fascinating research, which involves numerous newspapersâfrom the elite New York Times to the New York Herald, from the Montreal Daily Star to the French-language papers of Quebecâconcludes that the popular press, read transnationally, offers key insights into the developing attitudes toward and levels of interest in the newly forming identity of the âhomosexualâ across societies.\n\nImproved SAFARI-1 research reactor irradiation position modeling in OSCAR-3 code system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMoloko, L. E.; Belal, M. G. A. H.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe demand on the availability of irradiation positions in the SAFARI-1 reactor is continuously increasing due to the commercial pressure to produce isotopes more efficiently. This calls for calculational techniques and modeling methods to be improved regularly to optimize irradiation services. The irradiation position models are improved using the OSCAR-3 code system, and results are compared to experimental measurements. It is concluded that the irradiation position models are essential if realistic core follow and reload studies are to be performed and most importantly, for the realization of improved agreement between experimental data and calculated results.

The aim is, ultimately, to demonstrate that the notion of author formulated by the French discourse analyst may provide to certain genres of discourse produced in the field of literature, such as autobiographical accounts and letters written by authors, a status that goes beyond their biographical and documental values.\n\nOscar Wildeâs Social Comedies in Modern Greek Theatre (1908-1945\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nConstantina Georgiadi\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The reception of Oscar Wilde in Greece has occasionally been studied, although modern theoretical works around aestheticism devote a significant part to his influence on Greek artists at the beginning of twentieth century. Some of his plays - mostly SalomÃ© and A Florentine Tragedy (1908 as well as an adaptation of The Portrait of Dorian Gray (1916- appeared in translation and on theatre stage just after the release of his postmortem apologetic De Profundis. His comedy The Importance of Being Earnest, was introduced to the Greek audience simultaneously with his tragedies in 1908, and one more melodrama, An Ideal Husband was staged in 1917. After that year, only his tragedies were repeated whereas his melodramas disappeared in the interwar years, to reappear again in a sudden and noticeable frequency in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The aim of this paper is to identify the reasons of the constant absence of Oscar Wildeâs melodramas from the Greek stage but also to explain their sudden adoption in the late thirties through a new perspective: the interaction between theatre and the newly growing art of cinema. During the controversial 30s, a considerable number of film versions of Wilde's social melodramas were made in Europe, most of them in Germany; these movies were projected in Greece, restoring thereby the Irish writer and his work. The seventh art, which was anyway supplied by writers, actors and theatre directors, became the channel for the Greek public to get acquainted with Wildeâ s social comedies as a whole. Additionally, it affected the repertoire of Greek theatre groups, including the National Theatre of Greece. The paper will focus on cinema and theatre investigation of the 1930s and 1940s (mainly until WWII in Greece, exploring the interchangeable relationship between those two arts, as far as Wildeâs social melodramas are concerned, in the broader historical, social and cultural spectrum of the era.

He was also the official photographer for RCAâs affiliate record label in Argentina between 1967 and 1973, producing publicity for a new wave of rock nâ roll bands and solo popular music acts including Los Gatos and Arco Iris. Attending to key phases in his artistic oeuvre as well as close readings of his expertly crafted popular images, this article attempts to bridge these seemingly irreconcilable aspects of Bonyâs practice. At first glance, his rock photography, known as el estilo Bony, has little relation to his art, and is perhaps even its political antithesis: âcreativeâ work in the service of a top-down business model. Yet a closer look at both endeavors yields a lasting interplay between flesh and conceptâat the grain of the work, a dialectic between incontrovertible index and crafted, calculated imageâthat was the artistâs central preoccupation in the fraught decade between the military coups. As such, Bony provides an opportunity to recover a category often absent from the Argentine art of this moment: the body, factual and libidinal.\n\nCalibration and testing of IKU's oil spill contingency and response (OSCAR) model system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nReed, M.; Aamo, O.M.; Downing, K.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA computer modeling system entitled Oil Spill Contingency and Response (OSCAR), was calibrated and tested using a variety of field observations. The objective of the exercise was to establish model credibility and increase confidence in efforts to compare alternate oil spill response strategies, while maintaining a balance between response costs and environmental protection. The key components of the system are IKU's data-based oil weathering model, a three dimensional oil trajectory and chemical fates model, an oil spill combat model, and exposure models for fish, ichthyoplankton, birds, and marine mammals. Most modelled calculations were in good agreement with field observations. One discrepancy was found which could be attributed to an underestimation of wind drift in the current model. 21 refs., 4 tabs., 32 figs\n\nâI Will Take Your Answer One Way or Anotherâ: The Oscar Wilde Trial Transcripts as Literary Artefacts\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMerkler, Benjamin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOscar Wilde was not only an eccentric artist and perhaps one of the most popular British dramatists since Shakespeare, but also one of the â if not the â first modern star, who understood how to present oneself in public and use publicity as means of self-realisation.

By doing so, it redirects a current trend of visual studies that are fascinated with the non-specificity of the objects and the itinerancy of languages. MuÃ±oz wonders what lies at the heart of photography. Is it the mechanical reproduction or the ability to chemically fix the image? Is it the power to isolate the instant or to perpetuate anything captured by the machine? The transformation that introduces photography has less to do with the work itself and more with the experience of image. That experience is, first of all, an experience of time since the image produces an intermediate time between proliferation and what is left as a remain.\n\nImpressionismo no Rio Grande do Sul: luz e sombras de Oscar Boeira = Impressionism in Rio Grande do Sul: light and shadows of Oscar Boeira\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRosa, Fernanda Soares da\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Este trabalho busca traÃ§ar a trajetÃ³ria do pintor gaÃºcho Oscar Boeira (1883-1943 no campo das artes plÃ¡sticas no Rio Grande do Sul.

This leads to initiation of discourses over behavior or actions which may not be unethical but which may be questionable in terms of social propriety. Moreover, the âshockingâ may be seen as persistent attempts at formulation of subjectivity -the âperformative self.â These ideas are analyzed with reference to Foucault's perspective on the issues and briefly in context of the late Victorian Aesthete culture spearheaded by Walter Pater and later, Oscar Wilde, the quintessential âdandy.â Their textsÂ Marius the EpicureanÂ andÂ The Picture of Dorian GrayÂ are read with the question of ethics and hedonism in mind, also relating the same to their fascination with classical Epicureanism.

For many years the Irish author lived a double life. He was both a celebrated man of letters, and an irreducibly extraneous body. His essay The Decay of Lying, published in 1889, is a Socratic dialogue that, through its inherent duplicity, exhibits this binary condition. On one hand it is a brilliant work of criticism â pleasantly heterodox â that fully embodies Wildeâs rule of âbewildering the massesâ, while on the other, even though backhandedly, it gives a recalcitrant account of the implacable social control of his time. In this eulogy of the art of lying â mainly understood as a way of âsaying noâ to the truths of power â Wilde reveals the theoretical foundations and originality of his political philosophy, which is the same as that displayed in his later essay The Soul of Man Under Socialism (1891.\n\nErratum: A space weather mission concept: Observatories of the solar corona and active regions (oscar) (Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate (2015) 5 (A4) DOI: 10.1051/swsc/2015003)\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nStrugarek, Antoine; Janitzek, Nils; Lee, Arrow\n\n2017-01-01\n\net al.

High-resolution seismic imaging of the sediments and basaltic basement can be used to map fluid flow pathways between the oceanic crust and the surrounding ocean. To obtain these high-resolution images, we undertake full-waveform inversion (FWI), an advanced seismic imaging technique capable of resolving velocity heterogeneities at a wide range of length scales, from background trends to fine-scale geological/crustal detail, in a fully data-driven automated manner. This technology is widely used within the petroleum sector due to its potential to obtain high-resolution P-wave velocity models that lead to improvements in migrated seismic images of the subsurface. Here, we use the P-wave velocity model obtained from travel-time tomography as the starting model in the application of acoustic, time-domain FWI to a multichannel streamer field dataset acquired in the east Pacific along a profile between the Costa Rica spreading centre and the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole 504B, where the crust is approximately six million years old. FWI iteratively improves the velocity model by minimizing the misfit between the predicted data and the field data. It seeks to find a high-fidelity velocity model that is capable of matching individual seismic waveforms of the original raw field dataset, with an initial focus on matching the low-frequency components of the early arriving energy. Quality assurance methods adopted during the inversion ensure convergence in the direction of the global minimum. We demonstrate that FWI is able to recover fine-scale, high-resolution velocity heterogeneities within the young oceanic crust along the profile. The highly resolved FWI velocity model is useful in the identification of the layer 2A/2B interface and low-velocity layers that\n\nOscar Wilde as a Temporal Designer: A Case Study of The Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBahram Behin\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Since the publication of Oscar Wildeâs The Picture of Dorian Gray, there have been great amounts of ideological criticism both for and against the author and the work. Critics have variously evaluated the work from different perspectives; however, these studies have largely targeted the thematic aspects of the novel, while little serious attempt has been made to examine the narrativity of this great work. As a result, the narrative structure of this novel still remains quite untouched. As a partial fulfillment, the present paper has examined the temporal structure of the novel. The analysis indicated that temporality is one of the very functional elements of the work. In fact, much of the meaning or the effect the author intends to converse through each action, character, or dialogue is firstly embedded in a proper and effective temporal setting. Moreover, the analysis ascertained that the well-set temporal structure of the work has resulted in (1 Ekphrasis, (2 Characterization, and (3 Reader manipulation. According to the paper, these three elements dramatically carry out the influentiality of this great novel.\n\nAvaliaÃ§Ã£o de diferentes modelos de colmÃ©ias para abelhas jataÃ­ (Tetragonisca angustula Latreille, 1811 Evaluation of different types of stingless bees hives (Tetragonisca angustula Latreille, 1811\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria Claudia Colla Ruvolo-Takasusuki\n\n2002-04-01\n\nFull Text Available O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o desempenho de colÃ´nias de abelhas jataÃ­s, Tetragonisca angustula Latreille, 1811 (Hymenoptera, Meliponinae na regiÃ£o de MaringÃ¡, Estado do ParanÃ¡, alojadas nos seguintes modelos de colmÃ©ia: Fritzen, Guiliani, Nogueira-Neto e Antonio Carlos Farias (ACF.

Twenty colonies were settled in the following types of hives: Fritzen, Guiliani, Nogueira-Neto, and Antonio Carlos Farias (ACF, with five replications each type. The experimental season was from December, 1999 to December 2000. Monthly, the hives were weighed in order to get the colony weight. Data were analyzed statistically using the month as co variable and Scheffesâs test to compare the means. The colonies settled in\n\nTHE REPRESENTATION OF THE GHOST ARCHETYPE IN THE CANTERVILLE GHOST BY OSCAR WILDE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSafaryan Agata Vladimirovna\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The article touches upon the actual interdisciplinary problems of modern cognitive linguistics, psychology, literary criticism and is related to the study of the archetypal representations of ethnicity and changes reflected in the linguistic consciousness. These changes are mainly influenced by the works of fiction and the role of writer's worldview in their formation. Guided by the thesis of universality of the archetypes, the author mentions that though the archetype represents the inherent characteristics of certain ethnic and cultural space, it retains the features which make an image recognizable at all times. By this fact the author explains the existence of beliefs in ghosts with different embodiments in all cultures. The awakening of the archetype is caused by certain historical events, i.e. the revival and further embodiment of the ghost archetype was the result of reversion to the cultural heritage during the Victorian England. The complex analysis of the means of speech representation that called up the realization of the ghost archetype in Oscar Wilde's short story The Canterville Ghost allowed to reveal that alongside with features that constitute the archetypal nature of ghosts in general, there appear the ones peculiar to the author's individual worldview, which either complement or change the existing notions about this being from another world.\n\nKÄdainiai region in the creative work of Adam Mickiewicz, Oscar MiÅosz, and CzesÅaw MiÅosz : mythologema of coming back\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSakalaviÄiÅ«tÄ, Kristina\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe history of Lithuanian regional literature classifies Adam Mickiewicz, Oscar MiÅosz, and CzesÅaw MiÅosz as the authors of KÄdainiai district. The fact that all of them have mentioned KÄdainiai in their creative work lays at the basis of such a classification. Mickiewicz, O. MiÅosz, and Cz. MiÅosz were writing about KÄdainiai region while living abroad. Personal and cultural memory, as well as imagination were essential for them because all three authors had âto be backâ to Lithuania in ord...\n\nDe Profundis dâOscar Wilde: la quÃªte dâidentitÃ© du dandy en prison\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\n2010-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Plus dâun siÃ¨cle aprÃ¨s sa mort, Oscar Wilde continue de susciter lâintÃ©rÃªt tant pour son Åuvre que pour sa vie. Dandy toute sa vie, dâune taille hors du commun, ce nâest pas seulement lâartiste mais aussi lâhomme qui a marquÃ© son siÃ¨cle et continue dâenthousiasmer le lecteur du vingt-et-uniÃ¨me siÃ¨cle. (... LâÃ©criture de soi en souffrance, comme nous le voyons Ã travers De Profundis, aboutit Ã la preuve que son gÃ©nie artistique est intact. (... LâÃ©criture combat la souffrance de lâisolation et de la dÃ©chÃ©ance, mais dans le cas de Wilde, câest Ã©galement le moyen de se reconstruire en tant quâhomme et en tant quâartiste: il nâa plus de nom, plus de reconnaissance par les hommes, mais le texte, que Wilde lâai pensÃ© ou non, est une nouvelle Åuvre dâart qui montre la capacitÃ© et la force de lâesprit en condition dâoppression.\n\nOsmoregulation and muscle water control in vitro facing salinity stress of the Amazon fish Oscar Astronotus ocellatus (Cichlidae)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGutierre, Silvia M. M.; Schulte, Jessica M.; Schofield, Pam; Prodocimo, Viviane\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSpecimens of OscarÂ Astronotus ocellatusÂ from a fish farm were abruptly submitted to salt stress of 14 ppt and 20 ppt, for 3 and 8Â h to determine their plasma osmolality. Muscle wet body mass changeÂ in vitroÂ was analyzed from control freshwater animals. Fish in 14 ppt presented no osmolality distress even after 8Â h. In 20 ppt, a slight increase (10%) in plasma osmolality was observed for both times of exposure when compared to control fish. Muscle slices submittedÂ in vitroÂ to hyper-osmotic saline displayed decreased body mass after 75Â min, and slices submitted to hypo-osmotic saline displayed increased body mass after 45Â min when compared to control (isosmotic saline). These results reinforceÂ A. ocellatusâs euryhalinity. The fish were able to regulate its internal medium and tolerate 14 ppt, but presented an intense osmotic challenge and low muscle hydration control when facing salinities of 20 ppt.\n\nLa dramaturgia de Oscar Wilde, ejemplo paradigmÃ¡tico de la influencia y recepciÃ³n del teatro francÃ©s en Gran BretaÃ±a (1880-1895)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRamos Gay, Ignacio\n\n2004-01-01\n\nRESUMEN La tesis doctoral tiene por objetivo analizar la influencia, recepciÃ³n y subversiÃ³n del teatro francÃ©s en Gran BretaÃ±a durante el marco temporal acotado por 1880 y 1895, tomando como base inductiva la dramaturgia de Oscar Wilde.

We examined ease of use, comfort, degree of disturbance, reported adverse effects, factors associated with poor tolerability, and association of poor tolerability with data acquisition of 24-hour ABPM using the Oscar 2 monitor in the research setting. Methods Sixty adults participating in a research study of people with a history of borderline clinic BP reported on their experience with ABPM on two occasions one week apart. Poor tolerability was operationalized as an overall score at or above the 75th percentile using responses to questions adapted from a previously developed questionnaire. In addition to descriptive statistics (means for responses to Likert-scaled \"0 to 10\" questions and proportions for Yes/No questions, we examined reproducibility of poor tolerability as well as associations with poor tolerability and whether poor tolerability was associated with removal of the monitor or inadequate number of BP measurements. Results The mean ambulatory BP of participants by an initial ABPM session was 148/87 mm Hg. After wearing the monitor the first time, the degree to which the monitor was felt to be cumbersome ranged from a mean of 3.0 to 3.8, depending on whether at work, home, driving, or other times. The most bother was interference with normal sleeping pattern (mean 4.2. Wearers found the monitor straightforward to use (mean 7.5. Nearly 67% reported that the monitor woke them after falling asleep, and 8.6% removed it at some point during the night. Reported adverse effects included pain (32%, skin irritation (37%, and bruising (7%. Those categorized as having poor tolerability (kappa = 0.5 between sessions, p = 0.0003 were more likely to report being in fair/poor health (75% vs 22%, p = 0.01 and have elevated 24-hour BP average (systolic: 28% vs 17%, p = 0.56; diastolic: 30% vs 17%, p = 0.37.

He lived his life between two burning fires: the cold war and the revolution, right and left wing factions, the unity of the Church and Liberation theology, and at the same time bearing within the strain of the dichotomy between the tendency for the mystic and his prophetic gift. The Archbishop was committed to put into practice the teaching of Vatican II, the social doctrine of the Church, and to the documents written by the Latin American Bishops in the conferences of Medellin (1968 and Puebla (1979. Paying attention to the circumstances of the Archdiocese and to the needs of Salvadorian society as a whole, Romero searched for solutions, taking into account his conscience and the Magisterium of the Church, while living a deeply spiritual life. His Episcopal motto, âTo be of one mind with the Churchâ signifies his dedication and compassion with the suffering po"
