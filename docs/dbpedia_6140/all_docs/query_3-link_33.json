        "text": "National identity discourse has proliferated since the nineteenth-century, and this has been reflected in the construction and analysis of portugalidade as Portugal has undergone significant historical and social transformations. This discourse has developed within Portuguese imagology and is consistently based upon the central imagery of the Discoveries. Although there have been changes intended to either support or question the ruling elite, the imperial motif has remained throughout. The end of the Estado Novo and the Portuguese empire means that former identity discourse must be reappraised in an attempt to construct a post-imperial identity. However, even as these notions have come to be deconstructed through the use of irony and parody in postmodern literature, the centrality of the imagery of the Discoveries endures. This is particularly evident in Mário de Carvalho’s 2003 novel Fantasia para dois Coronéis e uma Piscina, where he uses metafictive techniques to analyse contemporary portugalidade. His construction of various characters parodies Portuguese imagology in order to question its legitimacy, as well as portraying the importance of agency within identity discourse through his manipulation of the reader using subversion. This emphasises the necessity of the deconstruction of portugalidade in order to fully understand its contemporary relevance.\n\nPessoa Plural―A Journal of Fernando Pessoa Studies, 2013 RYAN, Bartholomew, \"Mythologising the Exiled Self in James Joyce and Fernando Pessoa\" (2013).

Brown University Library. https://doi.org/10.7301/Z0PR7TGQ Is Part of: Pessoa Plural―A Journal of Fernando Pessoa Studies, Issue 4 Mythologising the Exiled Self in James Joyce and Fernando Pessoa [Mitologização do \"eu\" exilado em James Joyce e Fernando Pessoa] https://doi.org/10.7301/Z0PR7TGQ ABSTRACT This article brings together contemporaries James Joyce and Fernando Pessoa in articulating the idea of mythologising the exiled self. There are interesting points of convergence between Joyce and Pessoa which are very fruitful to delving deeper into the works of both authors and reading them anew to open up fresh perspectives and horizons. Pessoa most likely only scanned quickly though Ulysses and read little else of Joyce; and Joyce probably never even heard of Pessoa. Nevertheless, Pessoa's small critical synopsis of Ulysses with the fascinating descriptions of it as a \"literatura de antemanhã\" and \"sintoma de intermédio\" are worthy of attention. I focus on three themes in mythologizing the exiled self: first, that of the peripheral landscape via motifs of defeat, homelessness, language, and the sea; second the expression of plurality of the subject rather than \"death of the subject\"; and third, the creation of the \"nightbook\", giving the exiled self a way to see in the dark, the freedom to dream infinitely, and to embrace the life of repetition that is the passport to eternity during the one of the darkest chapters in twentieth century history. RESUMO Este artigo reúne os contemporâneos James Joyce e Fernando Pessoa, articulando a ideia de mitificação do \"eu\" exilado. Existem interessantes pontos de convergência entre Joyce e Pessoa; pontos muito úteis para investigar mais profundamente as obras dos dois autores e lê-los novamente, abrindo novas perspectivas e horizontes. Provavelmente, Pessoa nunca leu Ulisses nem qualquer outro escrito de Joyce, e Joyce provavelmente nunca ouviu falar de Fernando Pessoa. Não obstante, a pequena sinopse crítica que Pessoa escreveu sobre Ulisses, com as descrições fascinantes de uma \"literatura de antemanhã\" e \"sintoma de intermédio\" é digna de atenção. Irei concentrar-me em três temas na mitificação do eu exilado: primeiro, a paisagem periférica através dos motivos de derrota, do mar, a língua, e do estar à deriva; segundo, a expressão da pluralidade do sujeito em vez da \"morte do sujeito\"; e terceiro, a criação do \"Nightbook\", oferecendo ao \"eu\" exilado uma maneira de ver no escuro, a liberdade de sonhar infinitamente e de afirmar uma vida de repetição que é o passaporte para a eternidade durante um dos capítulos mais escuros da história do século XX.

Only the nationalistic urges experienced through the end of the 19th c. all over the politically unsettled Europe, would provoke, for the first time, a look inside frontiers. These patriotic impulses would proudly thrive through the myths and heroes of the grandiose past but, curiously, would also glance, for the first time, on the anonymous people that formed the nation. Distanced analyses of its outputs, developed by euro-centred cultivated scholars, would become the foundations of the Portuguese ethnographic studies, creating, on a small patch of the cosmopolitan elite a small interest over this production, collecting them as vernacular objects d'art or primitive artefacts. Almost simultaneously, artists from the first Portuguese modernist generation would also develop a keen interest on the motifs and features of these ‘exotic’ objects – continuously produced and cheaply sold on markets and county fairs – in accordance with the enchantment of the international Avant-garde generation with African, Mesoamerican, or Oriental arts as also with their own local folklore, all perceived as artistic productions still untainted by the civilization and the dominant ‘European’ culture of Antiquity and Christianity background. These inputs surfaced on the work of, among others, Souza-Cardoso, Viana and Almada Negreiros, as also on the Delaunay couple during their brief Portuguese stay between 1915 and 1917. These appropriations, oxymoronically presented as traditional and modern, would become gradually popular when applied by these artists on Revue Theatre sets and costumes throughout the 1920’s, following the legacy of the Slavic folklore dance pieces developed by the Diaghilev Russian Ballets. Nevertheless, it would be the far-right dictatorship, implemented from 1926 onwards, that would view this modernistic approach to the vernacular realm as the perfect embodiment of its nationalistic ideals and values. Presented as idiosyncratically Portuguese, the folklore and popular arts produced by these ‘bonhomous’ peasants, and its modern appropriation, would be praised as the perfect refutation to all the ‘foreign’ influences, modern or ancient: from the ‘communist’ modernism or the frivolous art deco to the academic classical styles, signs of a decadent subdued past from which the new nation – naming itself as Estado Novo (New State) – wanted to distance and escape. Through the assistance of the modernist generation, the National Propaganda Bureau developed a group of actions that would promote the Portuguese vernacular arts and, through them, the creation of a contemporary ‘modern national’ style that would permeate the conservative moral values of the regime throughout the people consequently ‘inventing a traditional’ world that still forms the base of the national identity.\n\nThe early twentieth century was a tumultuous time for Portuguese society. Shortly before World War I began, the Portuguese monarchy fell and gave way to the First Republic on October 5, 1910. Collectively, the 1890 British ultimatum to Portugal—which forced Portugal to retreat from its claimed colonial African territories—the fall of the monarchy, and the country's participation in the First World War set the framework for the post-romantic period. The cultural elite of the time initiated movements such as the Portuguese Renaissance in defense of a nation open to Europe yet still marked by a desire to return to its origins. In this context, Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa and his friend Mário de Sá-Carneiro emerged as the founders of Portuguese modernism, which they would develop under the concept of sensacionismo (sensationism). Fernando Pessoa and Mário de Sá-Carneiro, along with Almada Negreiros are some of the major representatives of modernism in painting and literature in Portuguese-speaking countries. In this article, we analyze the impact of modernism in Portugal at the beginning of the twentieth century and the role played by the work of Fernando Pessoa in the sociocultural context of that Portuguese era."
