Description The aim of the present article, based on the comparative method, is to analyse the topic of the double in the work of two authors belonging to literatures that, at first sight, seem to have little in common. The first is Mário de Sá-Carneiro (1890-1916), Portuguese writer and poet, and the second is Richard Weiner (1884-1937), Czech writer, poet and dramatist. The two authors lived in the same period of modernism, in Paris, being influenced by the same artistic and literary sources. In fact, there are some identical, typical modernist proceedings and issues in the work of the two authors (especially, the subjectivism and the identity/alterity problem). In this essay, the common double theme is analysed in the short-stories «Eu-próprio o Outro» (1915) by Sá-Carneiro and «Dvojníci» (1916) by Weiner.
