        "text": "The first thing I need to say:\n\nThis book contains content that may be shocking or offensive to some people.\n\nThat being said,\n\nThe Sparrow.\n\nI started this posted on August 17th, but I couldn’t quite figure out where to start. Writing a simple “what I liked vs didn’t like” list felt like I was robbing this book of its integrity. If I had to rate it, it would be a five star book, but I’m not going to do that here. I’m instead going analyze the aspects of the book to get a better look at wat makes this book so good.\n\nInstead, I think I’ll summarize, talk about structure, Prose, then categorize by theme.\n\nSummary:\n\nEmilio Sandoz is a Jesuit priest – and the sole survivor of a mission to the first alien planet with life, discovered in 2019 by his best friend Jimmy (who works at SETI). He’s broken, quiet, and mutilated. But, people have questions, and he can’t stay quiet forever.\n\nStructure\n\nHere’s the cool thing about this book (before we get into heavy themes): the structure incorporates past and present. Mary Doria Russell alternated chapters, stepping into 2019 as the group of friends petition to go on this trip, and 2060. It’s similar to the structure Elizabeth Fama did for her novel Plus One, except for the fact that Plus One alternates with flashbacks and memories. The Sparrow feels like the mother of this concept because time while traveling faster than light speed for Emilio and his group makes it so that they’ve aged only maybe 10 years while 41 years have passed.\n\nProse\n\nThe prose that Russell uses is so strong and precise. My favorite passage is from page 394 (I’ll bold my favorite parts):\n\n“‘…But if I’m simply a deluded ape who took a lot of old folktales far too seriously, then I brought all this on myself and my companions and the whole business becomes farcical, doesn’t it. The problem with atheism, I find, under these circumstances,’ he continued with academic exactitude, each word etched on the air with acid, ‘is that I have no one to despise but myself. If, however, I choose to believe that God is vicious, then at least I have the solace of hating God.’”\n\nWe’re about to get into themes, but I need to add that this kind of prose is littered through the entire work and it emphasizes the thematic significance of the entire novel. It’s a beautiful parallel that is so interwoven that it could go completely unnoticed and leave us wondering why we love it so much. It’s the best kind of magic trick, an illusion that left me starstruck.\n\nTHEMES\n\nTime Travel\n\nTime travel is not a central theme to the book, but it’s an integral part of the book. It’s not time travel in the “Claire-Fraser” sense. Instead it’s because traveling at faster than light speed makes it so that time passes faster on Earth than for them. This makes it so that when Emilio gets home, he’s only a few years older than when he left, while on Earth it’s been 41 years.\n\nFaith\n\nThis is far and away the biggest theme in the book. Emilio Sandoz is a Jesuit priest. The Jesuit Society put the mission to Rakhat (the alien planet) together. It takes them four years to get to the alien planet and during that time, his shipmates tend to have trouble with keeping their faith – and it only gets worse when they land. Every time they come across an obstacle – the deaths of their loved ones, illness, savagery of natives – Emilio persists that God is with them.\n\n“In their own ways, they all gave themselves up to God’s will and trusted that whatever happened now was meant to be. At least for the moment, they all fell in love with God.”\n\n-At the time of their descent onto Rakhat.\n\nTheir faith is repeatedly challenged. When Alan dies from a mysterious illness, they are all frightened, and Emilio and D.W. give them comfort in the form of religion. When Anne and D.W. dies shortly after, Emilio is still strong in his faith, and comforts the others. His faith is still extremely intact even when George, Jimmy, and Sofia die while trying to protect the clan they were with from the upperclass alien clan using the lowerclass as feed, Emilio is still strong in God. It is only when he is raped that his faith shatters. It snaps and he separates everything from that point forward as “the before” and “the after.”\n\nIt is important to note that to some, finding an ET planet would already be a challenge to faith. There is a debate that Earth is the only housing for god’s creation. Discovering another planet with life would devastating to that belief. Staging this book on/about an alien planet already challenges faith and provides an important backdrop for this theme.\n\nHope\n\nThe first spark of hope happens when Jimmy discovers the radio signal. Every on is wired by the discovery, curious, and a little apprehensive about who these people are. What they hear is music, so the implications of it are vast:\n\n“They sing in groups, and there is a lead singer.”\n\n“…they have social organization.”\n\n“…they have some kind of atmosphere that propagates sound waves….but not necessarily something we could breathe.”\n\n“…they’ve got something like lungs and mouths and they can control expelled air, or whatever it is they breathe.”\n\n“The language doesn’t sound tonal to me.”\n\n“There are consonants and vowels and something in the throat, like glottal stops.”\n\n“Radio implies a lot”\n\n“Metallurgy”\n\n“Think of the theology, Emilio!”\n\nThis hope they have about receiving this song-laden radio signals from an alien civilization is scarily accurate to the debates we’d have if we actually received these kinds of signals from the deep cosmos. These are all questions and speculations we’d have about the mystery aliens transmitting.\n\nIt took me a while to reflect on this theme, but I’ve nailed why it feels so compelling – it’s a heavy reflection on our reality. This is how we would react, and these characters manifest the hope humanity would feel about sending a manned mission to other sentient life.\n\n“We could go, couldn’t we…if we wanted to?”Emilio said in the silence that followed her remarks. “I mean, there’d be a way to get there if we decided to try.”\n\nThe second most-hopeful moment in the book is when Emilio is recounting the events that lead to Sofia, Jimmy, and George’s deaths. Sofia started it, yelling out “We are many, they are few,” as the upperclass race of Rakhat began murdering the unauthorized babies of the lowerclass. Sofia picked up a baby and moved forward. Emilio describes her as a “eschet chayil: woman of valor.”\n\nThis resistance is easily and quickly squashed, leading to what Emilio called a bloodbath.\n\nRomance & Sexuality\n\nJimmy is interested in Sofia from the get-go, which is a little awkward and a lot unrequited, because Sofia is into Emilio. That’s right. The priest. Her interest in him never gets addressed, but rest assured, our underdog Jimmy gets the girl. And, in a twist of macabre fate, marries her, enjoys prenatal bliss with her – even on an alien planet – before they are both tragically killed in a moral fight for equality for Runa.\n\nThe interesting thing about this is that Sofia, before leaving on the mission, goes to Jerusalem and sought out a mikveh. A mikveh is a ritual cleansing place, and the particular one she ended up at was meant for brides before their weddings. I was certain that this foreshadowing mean that Sofia was going to marry Emilio, and I felt like I’d been slapped when she instead marries Jimmy. (I’m jealous that Mary Doria Russell was able to pull that one off on me so thoroughly. All the evidence made sense that Sofia and Emilio were going to get together).\n\nFor, I suppose, obviously reasons, everyone is especially interested in Emilio’s sexual life. Jimmy asks him about how he stands being celibate so long. Emilio only gives him advice and admit to having been celibate for 25 years.\n\nThere is a moment between Emilio and Sofia that implies that they have feelings for each other. Our narrator tells us it was the last time Emilio would sit next to Sofia – probably because he didn’t want to be tempted.\n\nThe fact that Emilio dedicated 25 years to serving as a priest adds a layer of depth to his character, and it is this faith that he’s instilled in himself and in God that gets him through his ordeals, and watching his friends die. His repeated rapes (which lasted several years and included many upperclass people) shattered this faith. So, the theme of sexuality and romance is very important to Emilio’s story, because the very thing he avoided because of his faith (sex), is exactly the thing that destroyed his faith.\n\nAnne and George are married and have sex multiple times on the asteroid ship and on the ground. This offers the other opportunities to talk about it and explores the differences between Emilio’s vow of celibacy and the way others view sex.\n\nAfter Emilio gets back from his trip, a very uninformed and inaccurate report has already been known by the people of Earth. It reported that Emilio had turned to prostitution – and that he was a murderer, as well. This, of course, is a gross misunderstanding of what happened. This aspect of the story also adds another layer of depth to his story and what people think of him.\n\nWhen it comes to Emilio, all the aspects of his past and present are in contrast to each other, but they meld together quite well to compose a picture of a man who gave his faith, knowing that he’d be protected, only to find himself hurt and lonely – and betrayed by the organization that sent him on the mission, since Johannes Voelker is under the incorrect assumption that the report was right and he’d been a prostitute.\n\nReligion\n\nWe’ve covered faith, but religion is different. There isn’t much here, however. Emilio Sandoz is a Jesuit Catholic priest, as is D.W. Sofia Mendes is Jewish. Anne and George are also catholic. Everyone else isn’t really identified.\n\nAn interesting aspect is that Sofia goes to Israel before the mission and ends up in a bathing house specifically for brides. I assumed while reading that this was a foreshadowing of her marrying Emilio. Instead, she married Emilio.\n\nOtherwise, there isn’t much to add here.\n\nPain, Abuse, & Mutilation\n\nThis one is heavy. Fair Warning, guys. I know I’ve mentioned a few times that Emilio is raped, several times. The book doesn’t go into detail, thankfully. This is an important aspect of why Emilio became the closed off and broken man he is at the present.\n\nCharacters\n\nEmilio Sandoz\n\n“My life has a certain amusing asymmetry, if viewed with sufficient detachment.”\n\nEmilio is our main protagonist, so he’s clearly the most developed and in-depth character in the cast. The Sparrow is, in fact, Emilio’s story of exploration and survival. Maybe he wouldn’t have been our main character if another had also survived, but even that is unlikely. The severe juxtaposition of his experiences and his beliefs make the mission to Rakhat the tragic and foolhardy event it became. We spend the course of the book becoming familiar with the broken man Emilio became, and catching glimpses of the man he was before – an arguably carefree, happy priest who put his faith 100% in god.\n\nEmilio is a linguist who spearheads the mission to Rakhat. The fact that he is a linguist and the message from Rakhat is a song is a parallel that is extremely important to the central theme. He is immediately connected to the transmission and even tries to learn to language from the transmission alone.\n\nThe significance of would be synonymous with Clarke Griffin (The 100) finding a book of anatomy on an alien race and then conducting surgery on a member of said race or Indiana Jones discovering an artifact of an alien race and spearheading a mission to bring it back.\n\nSimply put, Emilio is the perfect candidate for our protagonist for three major reasons: his profession (priest and linguist), his faith (believes in god, strong faith), and his background (familiar in remote places, and was stationed in places many of us would find uncomfortable). These aspects of his character are then woven throughout the book as a reflection of who he is and who he becomes.\n\nAs a person who has been in war-zones and remote places, Emilio is especially tailored for experiencing a trip to an extraterrestrial planet. When they land on Rakhat, they are actually unable to leave because they have used their fuel stores. This bothers everyone, but Emilio is used to being somewhat stranded, so this is not a big problem for him.\n\nBeing a linguist, he is fascinated by the music Jimmy discovers, and he is consumed by learning the language and the song. It is too late when he discovers that the music is actually the alien version of porn, and he, unfortunately, becomes the subject of a new song – or songs, it’s unclear how many – when he encounters the composer/writer of the music.\n\nEmilio’s experiences, both previous and present, truly make him the ideal protagonist for this book. Being a celibate priest who is then raped is an unfortunate turn of events that walk parallel to each other. It is clear that this is the worst experience of Emilio’s life, and unfortunately everything in the book leads up to this moment – being the moment that changes him completely and forever. After his horrific experience at the hands of the poet and the poets society, he no longer can focus on languages the way he used to be able to, he is mutilated, his aforementioned celibacy has been stolen and is asked about and speculated on various times – and to various degrees – by the whole world, and he no longer cares to persist in any way. He doesn’t appear to want to die, but he certainly is not interested in living. This is the moment in which his faith, his celibacy, his reputation, and his intelligence collide, leaving him the shell of the person he once was.\n\nIn fact, at the end of the novel, after Emilio has confessed everything, told everyone about his pain, this dialogue appears:\n\n“So, God just leaves?” John asked, angry where Emilio had been desolate. “Abandons creation? You’re on your own, apes. Good luck!”\n\n“No. He watches. He rejoices. He weeps. He observes the moral drama of human life and gives meaning to it by caring passionately about is, and remembering.”\n\n“Matthew ten, verse twenty-nine,” Vincenzo Giuliani said quietly. “‘Not one sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.'”\n\n“But the sparrow still falls,” Felipe said.\n\nEmilio, unfortunately, is the sparrow.\n\nEveryone else is a reflection on Emilio’s core principles, but he is our main character because every theme of the book applies to him more thoroughly than anyone else.\n\nJimmy Quinn\n\nThere really isn’t much to say about Jimmy, except that he discovered the radio transmission. He falls in love with Sofia, marries her, and expects a child with her before they are both unfortunately killed. His infatuation with Sofia and struggle with his sexual urges provide a topic of conversation and conflict with Emilio because Emilio develops an infatuation with her as well – which he squashes as soon as possible. Jimmy and Emilio also talk about sexuality together, which serves to provide us with background information on Emilio’s celibacy.\n\nGeorge Edwards\n\nGeorge seems to be mentioned even less than Jimmy. He helps build the asteroid they outfit as a ship and use that to get to Rakhat. His importance seems to be only to the scientific and sexual capacities. He and his wife (Anne) have sex frequently on the ship and presumably the ground. This provides more opportunities for Emilio to reflect or talk about his own experiences in that arena.\n\nAs an engineer, he keeps things running smoothly.\n\nAnne Edwards\n\nAnne is the resident physician and spends her time taking care of her shipmates first and foremost. She makes sure everyone is comfortable and healthy. Emilio cross-trains with her.\n\nShe’s also a mother-figure and comforts everyone through the deaths of the people who fell before her and offers a warm and kind hand to those who need it.\n\nSofia Mendes\n\nSofia appears to have more importance than the others because she both tests Emilio’s willpower at one point, unintentionally (which also appears to be a foreshadow of Emilio’s impending trouble with his celibacy), and she is the direct cause of a riot that costs her, Jimmy, and George their lives. This riot causes Emilio to be taken captive, and then unfortunately sold to the poet who rapes him.\n\nAnother important factor is her own faith. She’s Jewish, which is a direct contrast to Emilio’s faith. This causes them to at one point debate the merits of Christianity. It offers Emilio a platform to explain why he chose his faith, which is integral to understanding how strong his faith is – or was.\n\nIn addition, Sofia is a generalist on the team, tasked along with D.W. o make plans and contingencies.\n\nD.W. Yarbrough\n\nD.W. is a priest as well, and a mentor to Emilio. He’s apparently the “butt-ugliest man [Anne’s] ever met.” And, according to George, he has a lazy eye. He’s from Texas with an accent to match. He was in the Marines and he flew harriers. He’s sent as an ambassador from the Father General (at the time, not Vincenzo Giuliani) to make landing on the planet easier and smooth.\n\nSo, he’s the dedicated pilot and generalist along with Sofia.\n\nMarc Robichaux\n\nMarc is a naturalist and watercolorist from Montreal. “Marc was in charge of the Wolverton tube plant colony and the tilapia tank, which would produce fresh food to supplement the packaged stuff they were bringing.” He also cross-trained with George on Engineering topics. He is the last to die, but he doesn’t really hold any significance. He dies from bloodloss after he and Emilio’s hands are mutilated as a ritual of dependence. His faith is also strong, but he’s very quiet.\n\nAlan Pace\n\nMusicologist, 39, Englishman, last minute replacement for another man who’d suffered a heart-attack during a stress test. He also minored in mathematics. He cross-trained with Jimmy on music theory and they were able to analyze a lot of the alien music.\n\nUnfortunately, Alan is the first to die from a mysterious illness.\n\nJohn Candotti\n\nI dont think there’s much to say about Candotti. He’s a priest. He’s on Emilio’s side the whole time. He doesn’t have a bad word to say about him, and his sole purpose is to understand the trials he and his crew faced on the mission. Simply put, Candotti is a kind soul who helps Emilio along the way. He gives Emilio gloves to hide his hands, and helps him walk when needed. He sticks around no matter how harsh Emilio can be in his pain.\n\nJohannes Voelker\n\nTimes when Voelker was a dick:\n\n“A pity but there are circumstances when a man leaves for the good of the Society,” …\n\n“It is time that someone explained to you, Sandoz, that this is not simply your private disgrace,” Voelker rapped, his voice hammering in Emilio’s ears. “When these charges were made public, the reputation of the society was all but destroyed. We now operate only fourteen novitiates worldwide!…”\n\n“…I said it was interesting how often you change the subject from the child you killed. And I wondered if you were developing another convenient headache.”\n\nHere’s a quote from Giuliani’s point of view: “They were so different, Vincenzo Giuliani thought, looking at the two men seated across the table from one another: the one, obsidian and silver; the other, butter and sand. He wondered if Emilio had any idea how much Voelker envied him. He wondered if Voelker knew.”\n\nAt this point, do I need to even go into exposition?\n\n“Voelker suddenly moved to the door…Sandoz spun back to face the rest of them. ‘He wanted it to be my fault somehow,’ … ‘He wanted it to be some mistake I made that he wouldn’t have made, some flaw in me he didn’t share, so he could believe it wouldn’t have happened to him.'”\n\nI hate this guy so much, but he might be the most underrated character in the cast. Why does he hate Emilio so much? Why is he so insecure in himself? Strange.\n\n“People were starting to forget,” Voelker said. “It might have been better for everyone if Sandoz had been killed along with the rest of them.”\n\n“Why, Father Voelker,” Giuliani said aridly. “What an unworthy thought.”\n\nVincenzo Giuliani\n\nThat last quote is a great segue into the Father General Vincenzo Giuliani. Vincenzo Giuliani isn’t a bad guy, but he does push Emilio to tell them everything that happened:\n\n“‘Tell us.’ Two words. It was, Vincenzo Giuliani thought, the hardest thing he had ever done.”\n\nHe also isn’t particularly fond of Voelker, but he employs him to help him look at all perspectives.\n\nIn fact, Giuliani is the one who makes Emilio face what happened to him and leaves Emilio better for it. He only wants what is best for Emilio, even though it doesn’t seem that way at first.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nUltimately, this book is not meant to be read and enjoyed in a normal capacity. It’s a story about loss, harm, and falling from faith. Emilio’s faith is the central theme of the story. We picked up this book, read the first chapter which takes place in Rome 2059, and we keep reading because we want to know what happened to this priest. We want to know why he’s so broken. Then, we see him happy in 2019, and we read to try and consolidate where everything went wrong for him. The extraterrestrial aspect is really secondary to Emilio’s faith – but it adds a charm that draws us in with its mysteriousness. It makes us wonder: Does this mean we aren’t the only ones in the universe then? Is god real and did he create these beings as well? If god is real why did he let all of these people die? Why doesn’t he stop the madness?\n\nIt all comes full-circle to the faith theme."
