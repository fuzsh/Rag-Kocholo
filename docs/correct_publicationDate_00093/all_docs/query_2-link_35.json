        "text": "Welcome to the second Reading Group discussion. This month we're looking at The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell - a personal favourite. The novel was published to near unanimous critical acclaim and should make for an interesting discussion.\n\nPlease remember, it's never too late to join us in this discussion! If you're new to this forum don't hesitate to contribute.\n\nBelow are a few starter questions / statements. These are only my attempt at getting the discussion started...don't feel as though you have to respond to them! Ignore them if you want to!\n\n(1) The Sparrow was originally marketed as a non-genre novel - why do you think this was the case?\n\n(2) Russell uses a complex structure in her novel - switching time frames and character points of view. Does she successfully utilise this technique?\n\n(3) Emilio '...had discovered the outermost limit of faith and, in doing so, had located the exact boundary of despair. It was at that moment that he learned, truly, to fear God.' Is this an adequate summary of the path the character of Emilio takes?\n\n(4) Why were Emilio's hands cut? Is there a metaphor to be found in this act?\n\n(5) Russell is a trained, multi-disciplined scientist and uses areas of knowledge in The Sparrow that aren't normally considered the domain of SF (such as anthropology, geology, economics etc). Has this changed your opinion of what the Science in 'Science Fiction' can mean?\n\n(6) The Sparrow is, in many ways, a traditional First Contact novel. In what ways does it differ to other similiar books?\n\n(7) Personally, I find the characters in The Sparrow incredibly believable and endearing. Do you agree that without her obvious skill at characterisation, Russell's novel would have been less successful?\n\n(8) Does the blunt language and portrayal of violence and sexuality jar with the more philosophical and spiritual aspects of the novel?\n\n(9) Can a non-religious person fully appreciate the novel?\n\n(10) Score the book out of 10!\n\nOkay, was feeling guilty for not being able to participate in last month's discussion of EG so here's my two cents for this month.\n\n(1) The Sparrow was originally marketed as a non-genre novel - why do you think this was the case?\n\nBecause it was more like a philosophical/ theological take on the possiblity of alien life rather than science-fiction. If you've noticed, the science of their ship was not taken up as much as other sf books.\n\n(3) Emilio '...had discovered the outermost limit of faith and, in doing so, had located the exact boundary of despair. It was at that moment that he learned, truly, to fear God.' Is this an adequate summary of the path the character of Emilio takes?\n\nYes. There's an idea in the story that I really liked, that the Church gives a view of God as a \"kind and loving deity\". But Emilio, after going through such harrowing experiences, supposes that maybe God isn't such deity. That maybe God isn't really listening. Considering I have a Roman Catholic background, that's powerful stuff.\n\n(4) Why were Emilio's hands cut? Is there a metaphor to be found in this act?\n\nThat's an easy one. It's a ironic take on the Crucifixion.\n\n(7) Personally, I find the characters in The Sparrow incredibly believable and endearing. Do you agree that without her obvious skill at characterisation, Russell's novel would have been less successful?\n\nYes. The book isn't really about First Contact, it's about how humans react, whether theists or atheists, when confronted with the inconceivable. For the atheists, it may be indescribable aliens that could drive men mad. For theists, it could be the idea that God is out to get them.\n\n(8) Does the blunt language and portrayal of violence and sexuality jar with the more philosophical and spiritual aspects of the novel?\n\nActually, stylistically, I think it works to its advantage because it gives both sides fairly well so it kinda bounces off the two motifs against each other. You know, spiritual vs. physical side of the story.\n\n(9) Can a non-religious person fully appreciate the novel?\n\nThat depends. Whether a person or not is non-religious or atheistic, it's whether the person can understand the moralistic and philosophical undertones of the story that they can appreciate the novel.\n\n(10) Score the book out of 10!\n\nA 8 or 9. This is one of the few books I read that integrated philosophy/ theology into SF/F very well and made it easily understandable.\n\nWhew! Sorry I couldn't be more controversial in my answers. Mebbe if someone comes up with a statement that I can play devil's advocate, I'll jump in...\n\n[This message has been edited by estranghero (edited April 16, 2002).]\n\nOk, my turn.\n\n(1) The Sparrow was originally marketed as a non-genre novel - why do you think this was the case?\n\nUnder what genre was it marketed??? This is clearly a Sci-Fi novel, so I go with FitzFlagg's response. It was a ploy to make it more palatable to non-sci-fi fans.\n\n(2) Russell uses a complex structure in her novel - switching time frames and character points of view. Does she successfully utilise this technique?\n\nMore or less. I have to say that at first it kind of bothered me. However, by the end, I thought the use was brilliant. It enabled the book to (a) add a lot of suspence (what made this wreck of a man?) and (b) emphasize the fall of Emilio.\n\n(3) Emilio '...had discovered the outermost limit of faith and, in doing so, had located the exact boundary of despair. It was at that moment that he learned, truly, to fear God.' Is this an adequate summary of the path the character of Emilio takes?\n\nThis is a tough question. On the one hand, it seemed as if Emilio was pushed so hard that he lost his faith. On the other hand, the last two pages make clear that he was a sort of Job character (which Russell mentions in the text) and that he would eventually find his faith again.\n\n(4) Why were Emilio's hands cut? Is there a metaphor to be found in this act?\n\nI really enjoyed the explanation given in the book. The beautiful, yet useless vines. Emilio became a pretty, but useless entity. What an intense, yet understandable explanation. This is akin to the foot binding of Chinese women or the corseting on Victorian women. In a way, this was the emasculating of Emilio.\n\nThe use of his hands emulates the crucifiction too, but I think the limiting of his abilities far more important.\n\n(5) Russell is a trained, multi-disciplined scientist and uses areas of knowledge in The Sparrow that aren't normally considered the domain of SF (such as anthropology, geology, economics etc). Has this changed your opinion of what the Science in 'Science Fiction' can mean?\n\nNo. LeGuin uses her knowledge of anthropolgy and physical science in her novels too. I have a B.A. in Anthropology and one in Sociology. This is my favorite kind of story! All too often, Sci-Fi authors have no idea of how to present culture from a completely different context. This story was just so cool from an anthropologist's point of view. A culture where the eaten were sentient. Wow. By having the team meet the food first really sunk the point home when it was finally brought to light at the end of the book. Brilliant.\n\n(6) The Sparrow is, in many ways, a traditional First Contact novel. In what ways does it differ to other similiar books?\n\nOften, first contacts are with the dominate species, or even more commonly, the dominant species is the only sentient species on the planet. This book broke those boundaries.\n\n(7) Personally, I find the characters in The Sparrow incredibly believable and endearing. Do you agree that without her obvious skill at characterisation, Russell's novel would have been less successful?\n\nHer creation of the culture of Rakhat is stunning. I was disappointed not to see more. I think the ideas could have carried the book, but, you are right, her choice of characters and the development of them was superb.\n\n(8) Does the blunt language and portrayal of violence and sexuality jar with the more philosophical and spiritual aspects of the novel?\n\nOh no. They were essential to the story. Emilio took a fall and to do that it necessitated the most extreme of measures. This was a study in the endurance of faith. How far could Emilio be pushed? From the extacy of love to the depths of hell. To be raped by God was a powerful image.\n\n(9) Can a non-religious person fully appreciate the novel?\n\nI am not particularly religious and certainly not Christian, though I am into the study of religion and mysticism. The use of Jesuits was perfect. Jesuits are a world apart from traditional Christians like the Qabalasists are from Judaic.\n\nJob is an interesting Christian tale and this story explores it in a whole new way.\n\nWhen I first read this question, I was sure you got it wrong...you must have meant, Can a religious person fully appreciate the novel. But upon thinking about it, I see this point of view. Emilio is shown that God is cruel and He will test you to the limits. He overcomes the test and begins to rebuild himself.\n\nThis book displayed a culture much like our own, but with one small difference...that their food is sentient.\n\nWhat does this mean to a religion that exalts sentience? Supposedly Man has control over all species on Earth. But what if our food could talk back to us? Would we do the same thing? Would we force our food into servitude and humiliation? Is their culture really that much different than our own? These are the kind of questions that would perplex a Christian as much as an atheist.\n\n(10) Score the book out of 10!\n\nI give it a 9. It is close to perfect, but not quite there. Some of the passages bored me and seemed drawn out.\n\nAll in all, this was one of the most exciting and thought provoking books I have read in a long time. The characters were believable and heartfelt, the plot was engaging and the ending blew me away. It is a far cry from A Case of Conscience, which I was not too thrilled with.\n\nThank you Vortex for sharing it.\n\n[This message has been edited by Kamakhya (edited April 17, 2002).]\n\nI didn't realize there was a discussion thread for this book. I have also read it and thought it was pretty close to sublime.\n\nI read it and its sequel 3 or 4 years ago, and just recently suggested it to my fiction group. We have read SF and Fantasy before when I suggested it, so they are flexible, but may not read it on their own. Anyway they all loved it and several were asking about the sequel (which I agree is not as good, but perhaps nothing could be).\n\nI thought the characterization was what made this book. It was so real, so humane, so touching that I just wanted to roll in it. I knew those people and felt I could find them living somewhere. Just amazing.\n\nI really liked the way she portrayed Emillio as being a fully rounded person, who chose to be a priest. Too often these characters are dead inside so there is nothing for them to sacrifice in terms of human contact (sex, family), or they make excuses and have both. Emillio made the tough choice every day, because he really believed, and yet he had strong feelings and would have been happy to fully express his humanity.\n\nI thought the intertwining and backwards storytelling was very well done. At first it annoyed me, but once I accepted it, I was sucked into the story.\n\nI really liked all the character development better than the actual trip and actions on the planet. I thought it was a different pace, and was too rushed. I also thought the characters on the trip were woefully under-fleshed out compared to those before. I really didn't care when bad things started to happen to them. Which may have been a deliberate act on MDR's part, to show that those we know and care about seem more important than those we don't - when we are all the same in the eyes of god, and supposedly the government.\n\nI had a very different take on the food on the planet. I don't think MDR was talking about some other type of people, I think she was talking about us. We have decided that animals are not sentient in any way that counts, and don't really have emotions, or in some cases feel pain, and of course that they don't have a soul. If we are willing to torture (medical research), Kill and eat other living beings because they are different than us, and we feel inferior in some way, what hope do we have with anyone else we meet who is not exactly like us ?\n\nWhat claim to humanity can we really have if our life and happiness is built on the suffering of others ? How can we claim to love, serve or belong to god if we don't think his/her benefits, care and concern can extend to all others ?\n\nI think the whole thing was about how from the love of god on down we make allowances for those we know and care about, and refuse to for those who are strangers, different, or totally apart from us.\n\nI thought it was a magnificent book, and would give it a 9 or 10.\n\nBy the way she has written another book since these, for those who want to read more of her writing. It is called A Thread of Grace, and is not genre, its about the story of how Italians sheltered and saved thousands of Jews during WWII. It is based on true events and took her about 7 years to research and write. This was the first book my fiction group read and they wanted more MDR.\n\nShe is now working on a book about Lawrence of Arabia and the conference that defined the boundaries of the countries in the Middle East. Hopefully it won't take 7 years.\n\n(4) Why were Emilio's hands cut? Is there a metaphor to be found in this act?\n\nSeems to me MDR makes plain the hands were cut to demonstrate to Emilio and to the world his utter dependence on his patron; he became Supaari's property. Sandoz says \"...he evidently decided to ransom us and brought us to his home and took responsibility for us. He made us part of his household.\"\n\nJohn Candotti then explains the significance of viewing the ivy.\n\nWhich is what Sandoz would say about his life as a priest; it ought to be a complete and utter dependence on his god. Living that belief ruined his hands and led him to even more debasement through the actions of Hlavin Kitheri, events that eradicated his faith. The book is the story of how he got from that despair to \"Do you suppose anyone was listening?\" which isn't a reaffirmation of faith but an openness to such a reaffirmation.\n\nI can see no crucifixion metaphor here. He does not undergo this torture for the good of others; he undergoes this torture because he is who he is and how he acts because of who he is brings him to this point. He is so conditioned to believing that god 'let' this happen he fails to see that he made this happen. MDR is very explicit about the parallel to European colonization of the Americas, the tragedies that happened even with the best of intentions simply because the newcomers could not understand the indigenous peoples could be as human as they considered themselves. Emilio and his band saw what they wanted to see because they didn't know any other way to see things.\n\nUntil we can drop our preconceptions of what is 'right', there isn't going to be any understanding."
