        "text": "About The Sparrow\n\nA visionary work that combines speculative fiction with deep philosophical inquiry, The Sparrowtells the story of a charismatic Jesuit priest and linguist, Emilio Sandoz, who leads a scientific mission entrusted with a profound task: to make first contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life. The mission begins in faith, hope, and beauty, but a series of small misunderstandings brings it to a catastrophic end."
