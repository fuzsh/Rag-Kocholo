        "text": "An interesting take on higher powers.\n\nI listened to The Sparrow and immediately moved on to The Children of God. Enjoyed listening to both and following the adventure into the discovery of other intelligent live in the solar system. Many well developed and memorable characters with dialog which propelled the story forward to discover a world beyond our own. It has many political and societal issues woven into the story, if you pay close enough attention to catch the author’s attempts to make statements about the church, capitalism, politics, belief in a higher power, slavery and population control. Some of the characters switch from good to bad and back several times during each book. These are novels that can make you listen for a while and then think about how this effects our present, our past and our future, for just as long. I found myself often stopping to contemplate these issues before continuing on with the story. If you have two credits and want several hours of intelligent novels, by all means get The Sparrow and The Children of God. (please note, you don’t need to get COG, but you really must start with The Sparrow. I don’t think you would understand near as much of COG without first listening to The Sparrow.)\n\nHaunting\n\n3yrs after listening to it, I still find the thought of this book unsettling, yet I can't help but keep coming back to it. This book has made me laugh and cry...\n\nWho knew sci-fi and religion could come together so well without feeling forced?!\n\nI'm glad someone told me about this book. It has become one of my favorite pieces.\n\nA modern SF classic with moral complexity\n\nWhat did you like best about this story?\n\nI liked how this tale of first contact went incredibly wrong due to human nature, our inability to understand something truly alien to our perspective. Too often in SF, alien species end up being anthropomorphic projections of human expectation. The worldbuilding is complex and believable. The characters are real people whose suffering has meaning, and boy do they suffer. It is tragedy porn, to a certain extent, like Connie Willis' novels, but the best literature often falls in this category. The author is unafraid of moral complexity, something usually lacking in genre fiction where the villains are usually clearly evil and the heroes' virtue outshines all the darkness. This novel shows the folly of the arrogance of even the most benevolent of our species.\n\nWhat does David Colacci bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nHe accentuates the tension of the protagonist exquisitely.\n\nIf you were to make a film of this book, what would be the tag line be?\n\nAMC is thinking of making a TV show out of this.\n\n\"Most depressingly brilliant SF show ever.\"\n\n\"It's like John Carter of Mars, but with interspecial rape.\"\n\nGood read\n\nI really enjoyed this book. It dealt with religion as an important part but not overwhelming part. I enjoyed how it was also very much about science and discovery. My only complaints are the characters were not amazing and are used more as vehicles for the conversations and the books ends sort of abruptly."
