        "text": "The gunfight at the O.K. Corral — actually, the gunfight in the lot in back of the O.K. Corral — has inspired enough fiction to decimate forests. W.R. Burnett, Loren Estleman, Paul West, Thomas Berger and Larry McMurtry, to name only a few of the most prominent, have all taken a bead on the street fight in Tombstone (as it was called at the time).\n\nBut in depth, scope and nuance, Mary Doria Russell's Epitaph is the best novel yet on the near-mythical events of the Wild West's most famous silver boomtown.\n\nRussell, the author of five previous novels including the best work on the legendary dentist turned gambler and gunfighter, Doc (2011), takes her time and builds her story with a patience John Ford would admire. At 580 pages, Epitaph actually seems over too soon. Russell leaves you wanting more.\n\nThe action, when it comes, is startling and furious. The famous gunfight goes by in a flash of dust and black powder smoke, obscuring much of the action from bystanders and even the participants — much, in fact, as it must have looked to town marshal Virgil Earp, his deputies Wyatt and Morgan Earp, and “Doc” Holliday and to the “cow boys” (at the time the words meant cow thieves) Ike and Billy Clanton and Frank and Tom McLaury.\n\nNot much time is wasted arguing about which party came into the lot with guns drawn (irrelevant in any case, as the lawmen were allowed to carry firearms in the city limits and the cow boys were not). Russell is after bigger game. She’s interested in all of her characters — everyone is entitled to a back story replete with their own aspirations and motivations, even the bad guys. It’s refreshing that she knows that the Earps and Holliday, whatever their character flaws, are on the right side and the cattle rustlers, however justified they feel in their actions, are in the wrong.\n\nThis doesn’t make the death of any character seem less tragic. Russell deftly balances the themes of politics — the Earps representing Northern business interests and the cow boys standing for the Southern cattlemen — with the personal in the form of a visceral blood feud involving three sets of brothers.\n\nFor once in a novel involving the Earps, the female perspective is given as much play as that of the men. Especially effective is Russell’s rendering of Louisa, the lonely wife of the amiable but doomed Morgan Earp, who finds herself sympathetic to the melancholy and equally doomed Tom McLaury. Dominating the story, though, is Josephine Marcus, the vivacious Jewish stage actress from San Francisco who is drawn at first to the glad-handing political country sheriff, Johnny Behan, but inevitably to the enigmatic Wyatt.\n\nWyatt Earp has been used in countless movies and novels as either a paragon of frontier justice or a dark-hearted avenging angel. In Epitaph, for the first time since the 1993 movie Tombstone (whose script, written by the late Kevin Jarre, seems to have influenced Russell), Earp comes off as complex and conflicted, too introverted to articulate his thoughts.\n\nWhen his older brother is ambushed and crippled and his younger brother murdered, he does not lose his temper but finds it: “Wyatt Earp had been born, and born again, and now there would be a third life, for the iron fist that had seized his soul in childhood had lost its grip at last. The long struggle for control was over, and in its place he found a wordless acceptance of a truth he’s always known. He was bred to this anger. It had been in him since the cradle.”\n\nIf you pass up Epitaph because it's a Western, you're making a mistake. Mary Doria Russell has lifted the participants in the frontier's most famous gunfight out of the realm of genre fiction and catapulted them into the realm of literature.\n\nAllen Barra is the author of \"Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends.\"\n\nbooks@dallasnews.com"
