        "text": "Kentucky already has a legacy commit in 2023 star Reed Sheppard, son of Jeff Sheppard and Stacey Reed. Is another one on the way in 2024? Sir Mohammed, the son of former Cat Nazr Mohammed, is a 6’5″, 200 lbs. small forward at Charlotte (NC) Myers Park. He’s not ranked by any of the recruiting services yet but was the subject of a profile by 247 Sports’ Travis Branham yesterday.\n\nNasir, who goes by “Sir” for short, is beginning to make a name for himself in his sophomore year of high school and is on the path to becoming a high major recruit in the 2024 class.\n\nAt this early stage of his development, Sir has good size, length and a frame that will fill out well as he continues to age and mature. To couple with his physical tools he also has a high IQ, a good feel for the game and is skilled, able to impact the game as a shooter, scorer and a playmaker.\n\nHigh Point offer, Tennessee interest\n\nSir plays for Team Curry on the AAU circuit and has already received an offer from High Point. Of course, High Point’s coach, Tubby Smith, coached Nazr at Kentucky during the 1997-98 national championship season, one of two titles Nazr won during his time in Lexington (earlier this year, Nazr was inducted into the UK Athletics Hall of Fame). Tennessee has also reached out to express interest. Even though it’s very early in the recruiting process, there’s one school Sir would love to hear from.\n\n“It will always be a dream of mine to go to school at Kentucky, for sure,” he said. “It’s all I really knew growing up, talking about Kentucky. My dad played there, everyone in my family went there so I just grew up a Kentucky fan.”\n\nSomething to keep an eye on. Here are some of Sir’s highlights:"
