        "text": "Mohammed has not seen the floor since coming to Oklahoma City last Thursday.\n\nBy: News On 6\n\nOriginally Published: Mar 2, 2011 11:52 AM CDT\n\nOklahoma Sports Staff\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY â€“ An official with the Oklahoma City Thunder told Oklahoma Sports that the team plans to start newly acquired center Nazr Mohammed Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nThe Thunder acquired Mohammed from the Charlotte Bobcats at the trade deadline last Thursday, but he has not seen the court yet. He is averaging 7.3 points and 4.9 rebounds per game so far this season.\n\nOklahoma City also acquired Kendrick Perkins at the trade deadline, but he is expected to miss between two and three weeks with a sprained left knee.\n\nSince the Thunder completed its two trades, it has shown significant trouble guarding big men down low. OKC has lost three games in a row for the first time this season, and in that stretch allowed Dwight Howard to score 40 points and allowed Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum to combine to score 34 points.\n\nOklahoma City will face another tough test down low against the Pacers in the form of center Roy Hibbert. Hibbert stands at 7-foot-2 and 278 pounds, and his size could present a problem. The Thunder acquired Mohammed for his defense and rebounding ability, making this an ideal time to showcase his talents.\n\nIt is currently unclear how many minutes Mohammed is expected to play Wednesday or how extensive his role will be once Perkins returns from his injury."
