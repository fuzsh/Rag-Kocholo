Vote below and help decide the greatest Detroit Pistons centers of all time!\n\nBirthplace : White Hall, Alabama\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Detroit Pistons, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Orlando Magic\n\nPosition : Center\n\nDetroit Pistons: 2000–2006, 2009–2012\n\nUndrafted in 1996, Ben Wallace signed with the Detroit Pistons in 2000 and would go on to be known for his relentless work ethic and tenacious defense. Anchoring the paint for the Pistons, he played a pivotal role in their 2004 NBA Championship run. Throughout his time with the team, Wallace garnered four NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards, five All-NBA team selections, and six All-Defensive team selections, making him an indisputable Pistons legend.\n\nBirthplace : Buffalo, New York\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Center\n\nDetroit Pistons: 1970–1980\n\nDrafted in 1970 as the first overall pick, Bob Lanier quickly solidified his spot as one of the best centers to ever don a Detroit Pistons jersey. Known for his agile footwork and soft shooting touch, the eight-time All-Star was a force to be reckoned with, both offensively and defensively. During his tenure with the Pistons, Lanier accumulated an impressive resume, highlighted by his six appearances on the All-NBA team and being named the 1974 NBA All-Star Game MVP.\n\nBirthplace : Boston, Massachusetts\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Detroit Pistons, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nPosition : Center\n\nDetroit Pistons: 1981–1994\n\nAcquired through a trade in 1982, Bill Laimbeer instantly made a name for himself with his hard-nosed, physical playstyle that epitomized the \"Bad Boys\" era Pistons. His aggressive approach helped lead the team to back-to-back NBA Championships in 1989 and 1990. A four-time All-Star, Laimbeer's rebounding prowess and ability to stretch the floor with his reliable outside shooting were invaluable assets to the franchise during his tenure.\n\nBirthplace : Mount Vernon, New York\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Chicago Bulls\n\nPosition : Center\n\nDetroit Pistons: 2012–2020\n\nDrafted by the Pistons in 2012, Andre Drummond made an immediate impact with his exceptional athleticism and ferocious rebounding abilities. A two-time All-Star while with Detroit, his presence in the paint was both feared and respected by opponents. Drummond recorded numerous league-leading rebounding performances and made history in 2016 as the youngest player to reach 4,000 career rebounds.\n\nBirthplace : Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Portland Trail Blazers, Detroit Pistons, Atlanta Hawks, Washington Wizards, Boston Celtics\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nDetroit Pistons: 2003–2009\n\nAcquired in a trade during the 2003-04 season, Rasheed Wallace quickly became an integral part of the Pistons' NBA Championship run that year. Known for his versatility both offensively and defensively, Wallace's skill set perfectly complemented Detroit's playing style. A four-time All-Star, his post-up moves and ability to stretch the floor with his three-point shooting earned him high praise from both fans and peers alike.\n\nBirthplace : Greensboro, North Carolina\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nDetroit Pistons: 1979–1981\n\nTraded to the Pistons in 1979, Bob McAdoo was already an established NBA superstar, having won three scoring titles and an MVP award earlier in his career. Although his tenure with Detroit was brief, McAdoo's scoring prowess and ability to space the floor remained significant assets for the team. His scoring talents were on full display during the 1980-81 season when he averaged an impressive 22.1 points per game."
