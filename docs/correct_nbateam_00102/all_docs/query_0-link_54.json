        "text": "Auburn Hills, Mich. — Tayshaun Prince matched his career high with 31 points, Chauncey Billups added 22 points and 16 assists, and the Detroit Pistons beat the Knicks 108-100 last night for their eighth straight victory.\n\nThe Pistons haven't lost since a 100-99 home defeat to New Orleans dropped them to 3-5 on Nov. 15. The Knicks have lost six of seven.\n\nBillups hit his first seven shots before missing a 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter, while Prince hit a career-high six 3-pointers, including three in the fourth.\n\nRichard Hamilton added 26 points for Detroit, going 11-for-11 from the line, while Rasheed Wallace had 14 rebounds.\n\nKnicks coach Isiah Thomas got an ovation from the Palace crowd before the game, then had to watch his old team shoot 48.1 percent from the floor, including 11-of-22 on 3-pointers.\n\n\"It didn't have anything to do with bad defense,\" he said. \"They have some shotmakers, and their shotmakers made shots. I'm proud of how our team played, but this is a tough building to win in, especially when they are clicking on all cylinders.\"\n\nEddy Curry led the Knicks with 24 points and Jamal Crawford added 18.\n\n\"We're just starting to come together and play as a team, and they've been doing it for a long time,\" Curry said. \"We gave ourselves a chance to win, but in the end they just made too many shots.\"\n\nStephon Marbury and Steve Francis combined for 23 points on 7-for-22 shooting as the Knicks lost their third in a row.\n\n\"They played great as a team — it wasn't one guy, it was everyone,\" Francis said. \"We were ready to play, but every time we made a run, they hit a shot.\"\n\nThe Knicks scored the game's first six points, but the Pistons had already gone ahead by the end of the first quarter and led by as many as 10 in the second.\n\nThe Knicks rallied, but Billups' 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds left gave the Pistons a 56-49 advantage at halftime. The Knicks had 30 points in the paint to just 12 for Detroit and outrebounded the Pistons 24-16, but the Pistons' seven 3-pointers kept them ahead.\n\nThe game stayed close until the Pistons put together a run late in the third. Hamilton started it with back-to-back jumpers, and Prince's 8-footer made it 78-64."
