        "text": "The father of 76ers player Nazr Mohammed was killed in his auto parts store in an apparent argument over money, and a man was charged with murder.\n\nAlhaji Mohammed, 55, was found dead Monday night on Chicago's South Side. Police said Mohammed died of blunt force trauma to the head.\n\nWalter Hughes, 35, was charged with first-degree murder Wednesday. A bail hearing was scheduled for today.\n\nChicago police officer Edward Alonzo said the men apparently argued about money.\n\nNazr Mohammed said he was at an airport outside Cincinnati on Monday when his brother called with the news of his father's death.\n\n\"I immediately came to Chicago,\" Mohammed said. \"This is a real bad time for my family right now. We are at a loss for words.\"\n\nMohammed played for Kentucky for three seasons and was a member of the 1996 NCAA championship team. He left school early to enter the NBA draft.\n\nErving report delayed\n\nSANFORD _ A final report on the autopsy of Cory Erving, son of Julius Erving, is being delayed at the request of the Seminole County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"It's still part of an ongoing criminal investigation,\" said Steve Olson, a sheriff's office spokesman.\n\nDr. Thomas Beaver, the district medical examiner, had planned to release the autopsy results this week, but he got a letter from the sheriff's office asking him to delay it.\n\nBeaver said preliminary tests indicated Cory Erving might have used cocaine before he died. Erving was found July 6 in his car, submerged in 8 feet of water in a retention pond.\n\nMAGIC: Clippers forward Maurice Taylor says he is going to sign with Orlando. Taylor told the Orange County (Calif.) Register he intends to sign once the signing period begins Tuesday.\n\nThe team would not comment.\n\nJAZZ: Danny Manning met with the team after reaching an agreement to buy out the final year of his contract with the Bucks.\n\nKNICKS: Patrick Ewing wants to play three more seasons, even if the team doesn't want him back after his contract expires in June.\n\n\"I'd probably like to play two more years after next year. If it's New York, it's New York. If not, it's somewhere else,\" Ewing said.\n\nREFEREE TICKET SCAM: Referee Bennett Salvatore pleaded guilty in federal court to tax fraud in connection with an airline ticket scam. Salvatore, 50, faces up to three years in prison and could be fined up to $250,000."
