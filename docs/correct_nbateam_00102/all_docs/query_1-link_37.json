        "text": "The Chicago Bulls have re-signed free agent center Nazr Mohammed, the team announced on Monday. Mohammed, 37, is entering his 17th NBA season.\n\nLast season, Mohammed appeared in 80 of Chicago's regular-season games, but only saw an average of seven minutes of playing time. His numbers -- 1.6 points per game, 2.2 rebounds per game -- were far from impressive, but clearly the veteran is well-liked within the organization and valued for his leadership. He first signed with the team in the summer of 2012 and signed another one-year deal last July.\n\nIt'd be unwise to expect Mohammed to continue to be a regular in the rotation. As well as replacing Carlos Boozer with Pau Gasol, who is much more of a center, the Bulls added big men Nikola Mirotic and Cameron Bairstow this offseason.\n\nChicago only has one open roster spot left, as it signed guard E'Twaun Moore on Sunday."
