        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. – Nazr Mohammed broke his personal rule of not commenting about his religious views on social media last week.\n\nThe former Kentucky star and long-time NBA player spoke out on Twitter after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ban more than 200 million people of seven Muslin-majority countries from entering the United States for the next 90 days.\n\nMohammed did not return a text from the Courier-Journal to speak about his views. Instead, he published a blog post, saying, \"I realized that it was unavoidable not to clarify my position,\" because some outlets wrote stories based solely on his tweet and provided little to no context.\n\nMORE CATS COVERAGE\n\n►Page | Calipari: 'All this stuff is fixable'\n\n►How brotherly love forged Kentucky's Malik Monk\n\n► Will UK be at full strength at Florida?\n\n►Sullivan | Another UK team on a familiar path\n\n►Kansas quiets Kentucky with comeback victory\n\n\"My name is Nazr Tahiru Mohammed. I am a 1st generation AMERICAN born in Chicago to 2 Muslim Ghanaian immigrants. That means I am an African (no Hyphen) American (born in Chicago) Muslim (practicing Islam with no affiliation with the Nation of Islam but I do consider them brothers and sisters) Black Man (English is the only language I speak). I was told by so many people thru social media the last few days to \"Go back to your country\" that I feel that I needed to clear things up (smh). Home for me usually means Chicago with Kentucky being my 2nd home. Though visiting Ghana for the second time in my life is also in the plans but it's still hard for me to call that home. Being a part of these different communities has shaped me and molded me into the person I am today. It's made me focus on the similarities of various religions instead of their differences. Islam has taught me the importance of faith, prayer, charity, discipline and diversity. And these pillars can be found in most if not all religions\""
