        "text": "Back-up center Nazr Mohammed re-signed with the Chicago Bulls, staying in his hometown rather than retiring.\n\nIn his first season with the Bulls, Mohammed, a 16-year veteran, played in 63 games (12 starts) and averaged 2.6 points 3.1 rebounds and 0.50 blocks per game last season.\n\nMohammed has played for the Oklahoma City Thunder (2010-12), Charlotte Bobcats (2007-10), Detroit Pistons (2006-08), San Antonio Spurs (2004-06), New York Knicks (2003-05), Atlanta Hawks (2000-04) and the Philadelphia 76ers (1998-01).\n\nMohammad first broke the news of his signing on July 2 via Twitter, saying he's thrilled to stay home. Mohammed said the chance to play with Derrick Rose, who sat out the entire 2012-13 season recovering from knee surgery, was a factor in his decision to play another season. - Reuters"
