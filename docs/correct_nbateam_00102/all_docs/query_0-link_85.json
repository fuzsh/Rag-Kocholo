        "text": "As people were being detained at airports across the country, former NBA player Nazr Mohammed reacted personally to President Trump’s executive order banning entry to the United States by refugees, migrants and foreign nationals from seven mostly-Muslim countries.\n\nMohammed, 39, played at the University of Kentucky and for the 76ers, Hawks, Knicks, Spurs, Pistons, Bobcats, Thunder and Bulls. He was born in Chicago, the son of an immigrant from Ghana.\n\nNBA, on behalf of Deng and Maker, reaches out for clarification\n\nMohammed, who is Muslim, shared his anguish Saturday on Twitter, writing: “It’s a tough day when u find out that so many ppl that u thought were fans or friends really hate u and everything u believe in.”\n\nHours after receiving supportive tweets, he added: “I appreciate all the love and support. It has exceeded my expectations and definitely outweighs the ignorance of the few.”\n\nA few days earlier, he had asked:\n\nThe NBA took steps to obtain clarity on the order from the State Department because Milwaukee Bucks forward Thon Maker and Los Angeles Lakers forward Luol Deng have Sudanese roots and the league does a significant amount of work overseas through its Basketball Without Borders program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We have reached out to the State Department and are in the process of gathering information to understand how this executive order would apply to players in our league who are from one of the impacted countries,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement Saturday night. “The NBA is a global league and we are proud to attract the very best players from around the world.”\n\nMo Farah says ‘Trump seems to have made me an alien’\n\nMaker and the Bucks made it back from a game in Toronto on Friday night. “We have to pray for those who aren’t as lucky,” tweeted Alexander Lasry, Milwaukee’s senior vice president and son of co-owner Marc Lasry, a Moroccan immigrant. “This is a massive problem and not who we are as a country.”\n\nMaker’s family escaped to Uganda when he was 5 and moved to Australia as refugees. Maker, 19, emigrated to the U.S. in 2011, where he played high school basketball for three years, finishing his prep career in Canada. He travels on an Australian passport.\n\nLasry expanded on his thoughts on Twitter:"
