        "text": "(CBS) The Bulls have re-signed veteran center Nazr Mohammed, they announced Monday afternoon.\n\nTerms of the deal weren't disclosed, but it's presumably a veteran's minimum deal, as Chicago is operating up against the salary cap for this season.\n\nMohammed spent the past two seasons in Chicago, averaging 1.6 points and 1.4 rebounds in 80 games last season. Mohammed was typically the Bulls' second big man off the bench last season, but after the signings of Pau Gasol and Nikola Mirotic, he'll likely fill the role of the fifth big man.\n\nMohammed is a 16-year NBA veteran.\n\nThe Bulls open training camp Sept. 30. They now have 14 players on their roster and are pretty much set, though they figure to bring in a few more bodies for training camp."
