For a few years now their strength has been a stable of young players at the 1-2-3 positions that can score on anyone, anywhere, anytime. Their weakness has been inexperienced, inconsistent big man play. So what do they do? They go out and grab the best defensive center on the planet and a power forward who is the epitome of the solid, veteran rebounding role-player. And mind you, they added these guys to a squad that was already the best in the league in field goal percentage defense and third best in total rebounding. (I had to do a double-take when I saw those numbers. I hadn't realized that. Guess that Scott Skiles thing does make a difference.) The Bulls could be scary good once again. Their Achilles Heel (if they have one) will be the teaming of Brown and Big Ben together. Both are basically defensive-minded superb rebounders who need low post space if they're going to score at all (which they won't much). They've got overkill on their strength and may have exacerbated some of their weaknesses. Mind you, this will hardly be fatal...they'll still be damn good and might be championship material, but it may be the kind of distinction that separates conference finalists or semi-finalists from NBA finalists. If it appears this is materializing, watch carefully. The key will be how the Knicks are doing. If New York is in the toilet again, I anticipate the Bulls throwing the Knicks' pick plus the kitchen sink at Minnesota to try and pry Kevin Garnett away. They have plenty of good spare parts and expiring contracts to offer and the pick is not that valuable to them unless it's #1 overall because they need Mr. Right Now, not Mr. Three-Years-From-Now. If, however, the Knicks look like a middle of the pack team the Bulls won't have the clout to get KG. And friends, despite all the controversy and nay-saying right now I keep getting this weird feeling that we could be seeing Zach Randolph in a Bulls uniform either this February or next June. Brown and Nocioni both have expiring contracts and even a mid-lottery pick would look good to us. Keep an eye on it. Anyway, I haven't even mentioned Tyrus Thomas or Viktor Khryapa and I already said the Bulls will be good, so what does that tell you? They're not necessarily head and shoulders above everyone else in the East--in fact I don't think I'd pick them as champions this year--but they'll certainly contend.\n\nDETROIT PISTONS\n\nRecord: 64-18, 1st in Central Division, 1st in Eastern Conference\n\nStatistical Comparisons:\n\nNoteable:\n\n3rd in opponent scoring (90.2ppg)\n\n2nd in ppg differential (+6.7ppg)\n\n3rd in three-point %\n\n2nd in assists\n\n2nd (3-way tie) in blocks\n\n1st in turnovers\n\nOthers:\n\n19th in the league in scoring (96.8ppg)\n\n12th in field goal %\n\n13th in opponent field goal %\n\n19th in rebounding\n\n16th in steals\n\n21st in opponent turnovers\n\nAdditions:\n\nFlip Murray, Nazr Mohammed, Jason Maxiell, Ronald Dupree, Will Blalock (R)\n\nSubtractions:\n\nBen Wallace, Maurice Evans, Tony Delk, Kelvin Cato\n\nKey Players\n\nPG: Chauncey Billups, Lindsey Hunter\n\nSG: Rip Hamilton, Flip Murray, Ronald Dupree, Alex Acker, Will Blalock\n\nSF: Tayshaun Prince, Carlos Delfino, Amir Johnson\n\nPF: Rasheed Wallace, Antonio McDyess, Jason Maxiell\n\nC: Nazr Mohammed, Dale Davis\n\nComments: The Pistons have been the most feared defensive team in the league for a few years now, and last year was no exception as they tallied huge stats in opponent points and blocks. But guess why? And guess what? McDyess, Mohammed, and Davis all together don't even come close to equalling Ben Wallace. The good news is that the guards who shot great, took fantastic care of the ball, and distributed like hotcakes are back. That alone will keep them solidly in the playoffs. They've also added Flip Murray for a little off-the-bench scoring and slashing punch, which frankly they needed. Prince and Rasheed still make up one of the most multi-faceted forward tandems in the league...seriously good defenders to boot. All is not lost in Piston-land. But the deep runs at the championship almost certainly are. They'll likely end up being what Indiana has been for the past few seasons: a good team that looks able to contend, but ends up being one dominant player short of being able to make it over the top."
