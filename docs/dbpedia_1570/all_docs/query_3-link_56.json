        "text": "Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) is the operation of manned and unmanned assets in concert towards a shared mission objective. It is becoming one of key innovations that will pave the way to future airpower. Smart, connected and modular unmanned systems connected by a distributed network of intelligence will act as force multipliers for the crewed aircraft, enhancing the team’s capabilities and keeping the pilot out of harm’s way, while still in control.\n\nMUM-T is a key enabler for creating Remote Carriers, one of the pillars of Future Combat Air System (FCAS). The complex future air combat environment will require for unmanned aircraft to be deployed alongside fighter jets, acting a as team. Remote Carries will be purpose built UAVs designed specifically to fulfil that role.\n\nRemote Carriers will be able to act as remote sensors, carrying a wide range of payloads suitable for ISTAR missions. Other versions will have the capabilities to directly engage threats – both kinetically and non-kinetically (e.g. through electronic attack). The Remote Carriers will be modular, meaning a selected payload can be chosen in accordance with the mission planned and required capabilities, effectively rendering them multi-mission air combat assets.\n\nThe applications of teaming go beyond air combat. Through co-operation of various types of piloted assets, such as mission aircraft and helicopters, and pilotless assets, MUM-T will bring benefit to a wider range of missions, covering search and rescue, maritime surveillance and border protection. Sensors installed on unmanned will improve manned platform’s coverage, adding to mission efficiency and effectiveness."
