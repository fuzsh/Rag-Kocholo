        "text": "“Online flying” is not a new concept. While it’s reasonable to assume that PilotEdge is a competitor to the other online services, the reality is that the service is designed for a market which has received almost no exposure to the world of online flying: real-world pilots.\n\nAs a result, we don’t expect a mass migration from other services to PilotEdge. Instead, we anticipate working with a whole wave of pilots who have never flown online before. (Many who have never used a PC-based flight simulator!)\n\nThat said, if you already fly online, you’re probably curious about how PilotEdge is different.\n\nMultiplayer sessions and servers\n\nFlight simulators have had the capability to create “multiplayer sessions” for years, allowing pilots to see each other in a single, virtual sky. Operations in these peer-to-peer and server-based sessions are usually for entertainment purposes, and live ATC interaction is rare.\n\nOther online networks that provide ATC\n\nThere are online environments that do provide Air Traffic Control services. Hobbyist networks like VATSIM and IVAO provide an enjoyable experience for a massive, global audience. They are run entirely by volunteers, with a goal of providing ATC coverage across the world.\n\nThe founder of PilotEdge is a seven-year veteran of the VATSIM network, and has accumulated over 4,000 hours as a VATSIM controller. This experience provided considerable insight into the operation of a successful online ATC environment.\n\nWhile quite popular, these hobbyist networks are just not capable of delivering a reliable, repeatable experience for real-world pilots. Here’s why:\n\nATC presence is not guaranteed.\n\nATC quality is not guaranteed.\n\nTraffic density is typically much lower than in the real world.\n\nThe skill level and interest of pilots is inconsistent.\n\nPIlots need to refer to an active controller list to determine which frequency to call rather than using published frequencies. Radios do not currently account for terrain interference.\n\nFlying on these networks can be great fun, and even educational under just the right circumstances. Yet it can be confusing and distracting for real-world pilots looking for an environment that mirrors their real-world flight experience.\n\nAdditionally, these networks are simply not equipped to cater to the needs of commercial flight training organizations.\n\nPilotEdge\n\nPilotEdge provides a reliable, repeatable online flying experience for real-world pilots and discerning flight simulation enthusiasts. The network was designed from the ground up to specifically address the challenges faced by other networks:"
