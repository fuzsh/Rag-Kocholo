        "text": "Clarification:\n\nThis was written about Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX). Parts of the answer probably apply to the new Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020 release), but that isn't what I had in mind when writing this. Maybe a new answer will be appropriate after using MSFS for some time.\n\n@Pondlife gave a very good answer, and I'll add a few bits to that.\n\nEven after having gotten my license, I still use flight sims (mainly Microsoft FSX and X-Plane 10) for some practice.\n\nBefore flying into an unfamiliar airport, or over an unfamiliar area, I'll often load it up in a simulator, and fly it.\n\nEspecially when I was a student, I found this incredibly helpful for my long cross country flights. You can look at a map all you want, but its still not the same as sitting in the simulator, and looking around (\"I see the mountain on my left.... and the lake below me. I can follow this valley all the way to the airport...\" etc). And I've generally found the simulator, with good terrain and textures loaded, can be pretty close to reality.\n\nThe night before I did a student flight from KBFI to KVUO, I flew the entire thing in FSX. The next day, it really felt pretty much like making the same flight all over again. Based on the landmarks, timing, views, etc, I knew exactly where I was, and I was confident that everything was going right.\n\nThat said, in my opinion there are some things simulators do very poorly.\n\nSome of these are:\n\nTakeoffs\n\nThe application of power and left-turning tendency on the ground just doesn't feel realistic at all. The climb out doesn't feel right.\n\nLandings\n\nGround effect is difficult to observe in a simulator. The flare doesn't feel like reality, and touching down (or bouncing) is not realistic at all.\n\nCross Control, Slip, Spin & Unusual Attitudes\n\nAnything beyond basic maneuvers up to 30 degrees bank or 20 degrees climb doesn't match reality.\n\nThis is dependent on your simulator, some perform certain things more realistically than others.\n\nBecause of these limitations, I would NOT use a flight simulator to try to learn takeoffs, landings, or certain maneuvers. (You can learn the \"procedure\" in a simulator... when to reduce power, when to add flaps. But the \"feel\" will be all wrong).\n\nIf you're going to try to incorporate flight sim into your training, there are some basic things you should do:\n\nSpend LOTS of time configuring it\n\nUnlike a video-game, this is not \"plug-n-play\". Spend time learning all the controls.\n\nTurn on Realism\n\nWhen adjusting your controls, set all \"null-zones\" to zero, set \"Sensitivity\" to maximum, turn off helpers like \"auto-mixture\" and \"auto-rudder\", etc. (However, I do keep \"Gyro-Drift\" turned off in my sim. Its annoying, and adds little practical value)\n\nTurn on Weather\n\nThe flight simulators typically come pre-setup with zero wind, good weather, standard temperature, etc. Configure yours to pull from real-world weather sources, or add some clouds, a variety of winds, and don't always fly at noon. Set the timing for early morning flights, twilight flights, night flights, etc.\n\nAnother \"fun\" area where flight simulators can be slightly helpful is in emergency procedures.\n\nTypically in real-world training, my instructor told me: \"We're going to practice engine-out emergencies\" and my mind immediately starts preparing for that... And naturally, we have to do them at a safe altitude in a safe area.\n\nIn a flight simulator, you can set up the computer to give you a random emergency at a random time. You might get the problem on short-final, or over a metro-downtown area. Something that you just can't do in reality.\n\nI haven't had any real-life emergencies, so I don't know how accurate a flight simulator is. But I believe that some practice is better than no practice at all, and flight sim lets me fly into storms, icing, get lost in fog, fly approaches below minimums, have an engine seize up on me, etc, all without risking my butt or a $200,000 airframe.\n\nSince @Lnafziger suggested more specifically addressing flight training:\n\nI do believe that flight sim can help with certain aspects of training, but in other areas, it is no help at all, or actually harmful.\n\nTraining Areas simulators can help with:\n\nProcedures\n\nReviewing steps and procedures before going in the air. For example, for a student, steep turns or stall recovery can be a little nerve wracking at first. It may be much easier (and cheaper) to do it in a sim with an instructor, discussing all the steps and reasons for actions. Then when the student gets in the air, they won't have the \"feel\" for it, but at least the general process is already familiar.\n\nNavigation\n\nTuning and identifying VORs, and interpreting the needles can be done just as well be done on the ground as in the air. If the sim has good, realistic terrain (I prefer MegaSceneryEarth), it can also be used for some visual reference lessons.\n\nInstrument interpretation\n\nScanning and cross-checking the 6-pack of instruments can be done in a simulator just fine, and a student can practice doing it for long periods of time for a fraction of the cost of flight time.\n\nTraining Areas simulators are very bad at:\n\nOn the ground & Outside the plane\n\nAnything on the ground, such as taxiing and parking, or anything outside the airplane, such as pre-flight inspection, or weather interpretation, just doesn't work in a sim.\n\nRadios\n\nI haven't seen any flight sims that really work for the practice of talking on or listening to the radios. (I haven't used VATSIM, which might help). I don't think there's any good substitute for actually flying in a real airspace while simultaneously engaging in real radio conversations.\n\nFeel\n\nEven the best full-motion sim isn't a substitute for the forces a student feels in a real airplane. This is especially true on ground-reference maneuvers, takeoffs, and landings, where I feel sims fall far short of reality. No one will ever get a \"feel\" for the plane from a simulator.\n\nFor much more information on the topic, I recommend these books:\n\nScenario-Based Training with X-Plane and Microsoft Flight Simulator\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator X For Pilots Real World Training\n\nAnd here's a picture of my old simulator rig.\n\n(Its been improved a bit since this picture)\n\nI believe that there's an element to this question which has not been covered. This is very much a personal response.\n\nYour question specifically asks whether it can help you to learn how to fly or become a better pilot. This is actually two questions in one.\n\nPhysical and mental limitations not withstanding, I would say that just about anyone can learn how to fly. But I don't believe that everyone who can learn how to fly could be a good pilot. Flying and pilotage are very much more than successfully operating a flying machine in order to fly. It's even a lot more than doing that and following the procedures (ATC, operating in controlled airspace etc) which accompany it.\n\nBeing a good pilot requires a certain aptitude and attitude (and I'm not talking about what you see on the AH). It needs, let's not beat about the bush, a reasonably good IQ and education.\n\nA pilot becomes good when the operation of the machine or the following of the procedures is not enough to to produce a safe, successful conclusion. A good pilot avoids the traps and pitfalls that catch the unwary and have proved the rule, all to often, that in the ongoing contest between the earth and flimsy machines arriving in other than controlled circumstances, the earth has yet to lose.\n\nA good pilot takes care of the machine and it's passengers. A good pilot can deal with the unexpected and make sound decisions to continue a flight or not or perhaps even to not commit aviation at all. A good pilot has situational awareness which tells them, via sixth sense, that the bizjet calling left base is a potential threat and is already looking by the time the tower calls.\n\nBut much more than this, there are some very important elements to flying which a sim can never provide.\n\nThere is the emotional response; that thrill, that feeling of privilege, that unquantifiable human response to flying that is so much more than operating the machine. There is also a set of skills and mental and physical responses without which, it is not possible to be a \"good pilot\" (IMHO).\n\nLet me give a brief background of where I'm coming from and a concrete example of what I mean.\n\nI have only a couple of hundred hours. A handful on fixed wing, the rest on helicopters. I also have about 3500 hours \"flying\" big tin on VATSIM (if you are serious about PC simming and don't know about VATSIM, Google for it right now!).\n\nIn VATSIM, I can operate a 777 (my favourite) very successfully including all of the related procedures which VATSIM does a remarkably good job of simulating. I can fly a SID, follow my planned route, follow a STAR and do a visual onto 26R at Heathrow without breaking sweat, talking to and complying with ATC all the way. I can deal with an unexpected hold or a last minute change of arrival without fluster. I know this all works because I have also been lucky enough to do this in a \"real\" sim (737) and I had no problems at all using the automatics and hand flying the machine for the first 500 and last 1000 feet to depart and arrive safely back at Heathrow.\n\nHowever, when I was learning to fly a helicopter, the reality of it all was very different. Hovering is like learning to ride a bike. I would say anyone with reasonable co-ordination can learn to do it. I can hover all helicopters I've flown with ease. Without even thinking about it. Thing is, I can't really tell you how to do it and I have never been able to keep a PC sim helicopter in the air for more than a few minutes without getting into horrible shape. Try explaining to a child how to ride a bike. I reckon it's impossible.\n\nWhen you switch from lurching around the sky with your instructor calling \"I have control\" every 20 seconds to that magical moment when you are suddenly in a steady hover, there are some things which simply cannot be simulated which your brain needs.\n\nThe beginners mistake is to focus on the ground, I think most people are looking about 15 metres ahead. You cannot succeed like that. What you want to do is focus your eyes well into the distance and let your peripheral vision do the work. It's almost subconscious and I can't even tell you how it all works but you do realise that you are moving over the ground with subtle cues coming in from your periphery.\n\nThe second, and more important set of cues, are those that come through the \"seat of your pants\". With a little experience, you just \"know\" when the helicopter moves, even before your peripheral vision has picked up the movement and you've already put that pressure on the cyclic (and it generally is pressure, not movement) to arrest the movement before the machine has deviated from it's position. There are always small movements but to an external observer, you are sitting there, in the air, without so much as a ripple.\n\nSubtle sounds are also important. I can tell you pretty much where the rotor RPM is without looking at the tach and can certainly tell instantly when it's going down. The second cue is from the tach but by that time, I'm already on the collective to adjust. The tach just qualifies what I know and shows me that I'm doing the right thing to correct.\n\nI'm sure that the fixed wing guys could provide good parallels.\n\nMy experience on sims tells me that you can indeed learn how to operate the machine and prosecute the procedures around it but it cannot help you to fly, nor to be a good (or better) pilot. Where a sim can help is in teaching you the operation and procedures to the point where your brain is free to concentrate on flying and pilotage and your heart free to enjoy the sensations, because the mechanical stuff has moved into your subconscious and has become muscle memory.\n\nFlying is emotional; it's passionate; it's determination; it's personal conquest; it runs in your veins. It's many things more than a sim can ever provide.\n\nIf you don't get \"Oh I have slipped the surly bonds\", then you are an operator, not a flyer.\n\n[EDIT] Am I a good pilot? I'd say I'm average, and striving to be better, but that, in reality, probably describes most pilots, since it is impossible for most to be better than average. I do recognise that I'm in that statistically dangerous zone where I have enough hours to think I'm good but not enough hours to prove it. In my experience, ego and cahonas tell many pilots that they are good pilots ;)"
