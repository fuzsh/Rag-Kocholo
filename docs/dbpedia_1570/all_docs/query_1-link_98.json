        "text": "There has never been a more exciting time to get into flight simulation.\n\nThe overwhelming variety of options might leave you wondering: “Where do I even begin?!“\n\nWe get it. That’s why we created this step-by-step guide to home flight simulation.\n\nWhether you’re new to flight simulation or you’ve been away from it for a while, we will get you (virtually) flying in no time.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe system, simulator, and peripherals are the key elements of a flight sim setup.\n\nFlight simulation systems can accommodate any budget, from entry-level to high-end configurations.\n\nLearning to use the sim software is crucial for getting the most out of your virtual flights.\n\nAdd-on aircraft and networks like VATSIM greatly enhance simulator realism.\n\nWhat You Need for a Home Flight Simulator\n\nHome flight simulator setups range from very simple to extremely complex. It all depends on your goals.\n\nMaybe your idea of perfection is the cheapest sim setup for cruising around and having fun. Or perhaps you’re designing a fully-fledged cockpit that rivals real-world flight training rigs.\n\nNo matter the complexity, every flight sim setup has these three fundamental elements:\n\nThe System\n\nThe Simulator\n\nThe Peripherals\n\nThe System\n\nThe system refers to the computer hardware that runs the simulator software.\n\nWindows PCs are still the top choice for flight simulation. However, you can also run flight simulators on Mac, Linux, and even Xbox systems.\n\nSince simulators work on almost any system, you might be able to use the one you already own. However, not every system is powerful enough to run a flight simulator well.\n\nThe Simulator\n\nTwo applications dominate the civilian flight simulation market: Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane.\n\nA 2023 survey by Navigraph found that 71% of simmers primarily use Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS). X-Plane comes in second with a 13% share.\n\nMSFS runs on both PC and Xbox platforms. X-Plane runs on PC, Mac, and Linux machines.\n\nFor military combat enthusiasts, DCS World is the top choice. It has a small but passionate community. You’ll need a Windows PC to run it.\n\nThe Peripherals\n\nPeripherals are the hardware devices you plug into your system.\n\nFor general computer users, typical peripherals include a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers. Flight simulator setups also use these peripherals. But you’ll want to add a flight controller to utilize your simulator’s potential.\n\nA joystick is the most straightforward flight controller. It gives you more precise control of the aircraft than a mouse.\n\nMany sim pilots also purchase dedicated peripherals to control the rudder and engines.\n\nComplex setups often include external autopilot, radio, VR headset, and avionics panels.\n\nChoose Your System\n\nChapter Summary\n\nIf power, performance, and flexibility top your want list, a Windows PC is the best choice.\n\nAn Xbox is an excellent entry point into flight simulation with minimal effort and cost.\n\nIf you want to stick with the Mac ecosystem, Apple’s high-end systems will meet your needs.\n\nIf open-source software is as essential as performance, consider a Linux system.\n\nThe heart of any flight simulator is the computer system it runs on.\n\nSystem choice has the most significant impact on sim performance. It also determines which programs you can run and, in some cases, the peripherals you can use.\n\nLet’s look at the most common flight simulator systems.\n\nWindows PC\n\nThe venerable personal computer has been the go-to flight sim system for years. These Windows-based machines offer the highest performance and the greatest flexibility. There’s little wonder they are still the top choice for avid gamers and flight simmers alike.\n\nA PC system gives you the most control over your sim experience. You can buy a prebuilt system at various price points.\n\nA custom gaming PC offers the most control if you’re into designing things from scratch. You’ll also get better performance for the same price as a prebuilt system.\n\nHowever, the number of PC system options can be intimidating, and you’ll have to build it yourself (or pay someone else to build it for you).\n\nFor example, the Nvidia RTX series contains dozens of graphics processing unit (GPU) models alone. The same goes for the AMD Radeon series. If you go the PC route, expect to spend time researching the best hardware options for your needs and budget.\n\nInvesting time to understand how the components work is worthwhile. When you fire up the simulator and see the world smoothly rendered before you, you’ll be glad you made the effort.\n\nAnother benefit of a Windows PC-based system is its popularity.\n\nWindows PCs run all three simulator applications covered in this article (and many others). PC users can be confident that all sim-related hardware and software work on their system. This includes aircraft and scenery addons as well as controllers and other peripherals.\n\nXbox\n\nUntil recently, desktop computers were the only way to run home flight simulators.\n\nBut in 2021, Microsoft launched its Flight Simulator (MSFS) software for Xbox.\n\nThis is great news for flight simmers, particularly those just getting into the hobby. The Xbox substantially lowers the cost of entry into flight simulation. For less than $500, you can purchase a system that runs MSFS smoothly. And the setup couldn’t be easier.\n\nThe only choice you have to make is whether to choose the S or X model.\n\nThe entry-level S model is $299 and runs at 1080p resolution. The flagship X model is $499 and offers 4k resolution.\n\nYou might wonder why anyone would build a PC when you can buy an Xbox for the price of a GPU. Yes, the Xbox offers good performance. However, neither Xbox model quite matches the graphics of a higher-end PC.\n\nThere are a few more limitations you should be aware of.\n\nOnly a limited number of flight sim add-ons and peripherals work with the Xbox.\n\nYou can only download add-on scenery and aircraft that the built-in marketplace sells. This considerably narrows down the third-party software options. Also, none of the online Air Traffic Control (ATC) networks (like VATSIM) work with the Xbox.\n\nNot all joysticks, yokes, or other peripherals work with the Xbox. A fully customized setup is simply not possible.\n\nDespite these limitations, Xbox is still an excellent entry-level system for uncomplicated setups.\n\nMac\n\nDespite Windows PCs dominating the gaming market, Macs have a storied flight simulation history. In fact, the first home flight simulator ran on the Apple II way back in 1979.\n\nApple has since veered away from gaming and focused on productivity and media production applications.\n\nThe GPUs found in Mac systems have traditionally been inferior to those in gaming PCs.\n\nThe good news is that the newer Mac models have flight sim-ready specs.\n\nApple now offers several new Mac models with much-improved gaming credentials. These are the iMac or MacBook Pro models with M1 and M2 processors. The drawback is that these systems can cost upwards of $3,000 or more.\n\nYes, $3,000 would buy you better performance if put towards a PC rig. But if you want to stay within the Mac ecosystem and enjoy high-quality flight simulation, you can do that.\n\nX-Plane is the only flight simulator that works on Mac systems. Neither MSFS nor DCS World has a native Mac version.\n\nMost modern peripherals work on Mac systems, even if they don’t list Mac compatibility. But be aware that there are some peripherals that don’t work correctly with Mac systems.\n\nFor example, the Logitech Flight Panels require the installation of third-party drivers. If you’re unsure whether a device works for Mac, an online search can usually provide an answer.\n\nSome add-on software, such as Active Sky XP 12, won’t work on Mac.\n\nLinux\n\nLinux is a free, open-source operating system based on Unix. Linux is well-loved and very powerful, but it’s not known for its gaming support.\n\nDespite Linux’s rather niche market, a dedicated Linux version of X-Plane does exist. MSFS and DCS World will not work on Linux.\n\nThe operating system is the only difference between a PC flight sim system and a Linux one.\n\nUsers report that X-Plane works quite well on Linux systems despite a few hiccups here and there. However, fewer than 2% of X-Plane users run Linux, so the add-on market is less robust than with PCs. As with Mac systems, you’ll need to keep an eye on add-on compatibility.\n\nLike any Linux rig, you’ll need advanced computer skills and a love for tinkering.\n\nChoose Your Simulator\n\nThere is no singular “perfect” flight simulator application. Each one has its pros and cons.\n\nIn this section, we’ll provide you with up-to-date information on the three most common sim platforms.\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator\n\nPublished in 2020, Microsoft Flight Simulator has taken the sim market by storm. Never before have sim pilots seen the world portrayed with such stunning accuracy. It’s not surprising that MSFS is the top civilian flight simulator.\n\nThe simulator uses Bing Maps and Azure AI to render the earth’s surface in photo-quality 3D form. For the first time, sim pilots can navigate visually using real-world landmarks. On high-end systems, the sim graphics can be difficult to tell from an actual photograph or video. It’s that good.\n\nThere are three editions available: Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. Higher tiers offer more aircraft and custom airports.\n\nDominating the sim market has its advantages. A tremendous quantity of commercial and freeware add-ons exist for MSFS. If you can think of an aircraft or airport, there’s a good chance someone has already created a sim version.\n\nRecent sim updates have addressed criticisms that prevented some simmers from using MSFS. We can’t cover them all here, but here are a few recent improvements we’ve noticed with MSFS:\n\nImproved flight models and ground physics.\n\nMore realistic instrumentation (e.g., the Garmin G1000 system).\n\nVisual improvements with lighting and weather.\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks to MSFS.\n\nAll that photorealistic scenery needs to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere is on your hard disk. The base MSFS system requires at least 150 GB of storage, but add-ons and updates can double that or more. Thankfully, fast and relatively cheap external hard drives are plentiful.\n\nMany users have expressed frustration over the MSFS user interface (UI). The UI can be clunky and difficult to use compared to other sims. Seemingly standard functions, such as replay mode, aren’t fully implemented or are buggy. This hampers its usefulness as a flight training tool.\n\nExpect a hiccup here and there when using MSFS, but it isn’t a deal breaker.\n\nThere is also no MSFS demo, so you must purchase it to test it out.\n\nAn almost free way to test-fly MSFS is to buy a $1 Xbox PC Game Pass. This service allows you to trial MSFS Standard Edition. You just have to cancel the Game Pass subscription before the month ends.\n\nWhat About MSFS 2024?\n\nMSFS 2024 is scheduled for release later this year. The developers stated that systems that can run the current MSFS version will run MSFS 2024 just fine. So, that’s one less thing to worry about.\n\nThe developer, Asobo Studio, has yet to release much information about MSFS 2024. One thing we do know is that the new version will include a focus on mission-style activities and “careers.”\n\nThe first MSFS 2024 trailer shows 19 activities, including search and rescue, air ambulance, and VIP charters.\n\nExpect more information from Asobo in the coming months.\n\nX-Plane 12\n\nFirst released in 1995, X-Plane holds a solid reputation as the “pilot’s simulator.” In fact, It is the only home simulator in our list with an FAA flight training-certified version.\n\nHow did X-Plane earn its revered position in the sim world?\n\nIts small but driven development team focused on providing exceptional flight dynamics. Their goal was to get the sim aircraft to fly like their real-world counterparts. Despite the difficulty of the task, their efforts produced a top-notch simulator.\n\nThirty years of development have fostered a robust commercial and freeware add-on community. As with MSFS, if you can think of an aircraft or airport, you will likely find it designed for X-Plane.\n\nThe most significant difference between X-Plane and MSFS is the graphics. Whereas MSFS has photorealistic scenery, X-Plane uses textured tiles and polygons.\n\nBy no means does X-Plane look bad. But if you love navigating by pilotage, it’s simply not as easy (or fun) in X-Plane. One upside is that X-Plane requires much less disk space.\n\nWhat if photorealistic scenery is low on your priority list? In that case, some of X-Plane’s other features might make it a better choice.\n\nFor example, the UI is much cleaner compared to MSFS. Replay and flight analysis tools are fully functional and easy to use. Want to set your aircraft up at a particular location, altitude, and speed? How about setting up system failures? It’s easy to do in X-Plane. This flexibility is why X-Plane is still a top choice for flight training.\n\nWhile X-Plane has historically been the leader in flight realism, this is not as strong a claim now. MSFS has come a long way in “feeling” more realistic. The difference in flight dynamics between the two sims is no longer as significant as it once was.\n\nBut don’t take our word for it.\n\nX-Plane has a free demo, so find out for yourself.\n\nDigital Combat Simulator (DCS) World\n\nUnlike MSFS and X-Plane, DCS World exclusively targets the world of combat simulation.\n\nIf you love leisurely scenic flights, this is not the sim for you. But if you love study-level aircraft and flying missions, DCS World is unbeatable.\n\nDCS World truly stands on its own among flight simulators. Its uncompromising dedication to realism and detail is impressive.\n\nHowever, some users find the incredibly detailed aircraft overwhelming, especially at first. There is a 44-page “quick-start” guide!\n\nBut most DCS fans enjoy the challenge of mastering a complex military aircraft. Apparently, even some military squadrons use DCS World as a training aid.\n\nThe solid DCS online multiplayer community is a huge draw for many. Nothing beats flying sorties with a squadron of friends. But those who prefer to fly single-player might feel limited by the sim’s solo options.\n\nOne great thing about DCS World is that the base software is free. However, the add-on modules (aircraft, missions, etc.) cost around $60-$70 each. That can add up quickly.\n\nVerdict\n\nIf photorealistic graphics top your want list, Microsoft Flight Simulator is the best choice.\n\nIf you prioritize flight analysis and real-world training, X-Plane 12 tops the list.\n\nIf detailed combat aircraft are what you’re after, DCS World is the sim for you.\n\nChoose Your Peripherals\n\nControlling your flight sim aircraft with a keyboard and mouse is unrealistic. And not fun!\n\nAdding a flight controller is the best way to enhance your sim experience. While we can’t cover all the options, we will offer a few suggestions to get you started.\n\nJoystick Or Yoke?\n\nThe first peripheral device you must get is a joystick or yoke. These devices allow you to control the aircraft’s roll and pitch. Some devices also offer a basic level of rudder and throttle control.\n\nIf you fly predominantly yoke-equipped aircraft, buying a yoke-style controller makes sense. If you fly a variety of aircraft or you have no preference, joysticks are generally more affordable.\n\nSome sim enthusiasts own a yoke and a stick and use whichever is the most realistic choice for the flight.\n\nJoysticks\n\nEntry Level\n\nIf you’re new to flight simulation and are unsure about making a big investment, a budget stick is a good choice. A very popular low-cost option is the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro.\n\nNot only does it have a smooth pitch and roll axis, but it also has a built-in throttle and twist grip. The small but usable throttle works quite well for single-axis engine control. The twist grip allows control of the aircraft’s rudder by rotating the joystick handle.\n\nHowever, the Extreme 3D Pro seems to have quality control issues. Some users report the device wearing out fairly quickly, particularly the twist grip.\n\nAlthough not as precise as other options, the Extreme 3D Pro is a solid entry-level joystick.\n\nMid-Tier: Civilian\n\nThe Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick replicates the sidestick found in modern Airbus airliners. This joystick is similar to the Thrustmaster T.16000M but with a few changes.\n\nThe TCA Sidestick has a smoother feel and a greater range of motion than the Extreme 3D Pro. The Hall effect sensors for pitch and roll allow for more precise control inputs.\n\nThe TCA Sidestick also has a twist grip, but you can lock it in place if you later purchase pedals. One unique thing about the grip is its ambidextrous design. This flexibility gives the TCA an edge over the right-handed T.16000M.\n\nThe throttle control has an idle detent, just like the throttles in the actual Airbus. However, it is hardly noticeable. It won’t get in the way of controlling non-Airbus aircraft.\n\nSome users report similar twist grip axis issues to those that affect the Extreme 3D Pro.\n\nMid-Tier: Military\n\nFor military enthusiasts, you can’t have enough buttons on your flight stick. Enter the VKB Gladiator NXT EVO.\n\nThe Gladiator gets excellent reviews for its precise control and solid build. It has a throttle control (and two other rotary encoders), and most models have a twist grip. Three sets of springs enable you to change the centering force.\n\nVKB offers several versions starting at $120. While programming all the buttons can be challenging, combat simmers love the Gladiator.\n\nHigher-End\n\nVIRPIL Controls, created in 2016, manufactures a series of high-quality flight sticks. Their design is modular, with each system including a base and a grip.\n\nVIRPIL currently offers two base models: WarBRD-D ($260) and MongoosT-50CM3 ($370).\n\nGrips start at $100 with the WarBRD model. A twist grip version costs an additional $10. All models are extremely high-quality, high-precision controllers.\n\nYou won’t find a throttle on any VIRPIL controller. This is by design, of course. These devices are for use alongside a dedicated throttle control and rudder pedals.\n\nOne issue with VIPRIL joysticks is that they are sometimes out of stock due to high demand.\n\nYokes\n\nYokes are more expensive than joysticks due to their more complex design. But for some flight simmers, only a yoke will do.\n\nEntry Level\n\nThe Logitech G Pro Flight Yoke is currently the only entry-level yoke on the market. For $170, you get a yoke and a three-axis throttle controller, which is a good deal.\n\nOne drawback of the G Pro is that the yoke only rotates 45 degrees on either side. This makes it less precise than other, more expensive yokes. The throttle unit’s plastic construction isn’t particularly robust either.\n\nDespite these issues, the G Pro is a decent entry-level yoke and throttle package for not much money.\n\nMid-Tier\n\nThe Honeycomb Alpha became an immediate success upon its release. For only $280, you get a solidly built high-precision yoke.\n\nDespite its popularity, we hesitated to include the Honeycomb Alpha yoke in our list. Why? Honeycomb Aeronautical is having production issues at the moment.\n\nThis is concerning to Honeycomb fans. People want to buy these high-quality yokes, which are a fantastic value for the price.\n\nIf you want an Alpha, we recommend purchasing one from a third party and not from Honeycomb directly.\n\nHopefully, Honeycomb will get production back on track in the upcoming months. For the price, there is currently no better yoke option.\n\nHigher-End\n\nIf you swear by the maxim “If it ain’t Boeing, I’m not going,” this is the yoke for you. The Thrustmaster TCA Yoke Boeing Edition is a 1-to-1 replica of a Boeing 787 airliner yoke.\n\nThis yoke not only looks like a Boeing yoke but also moves like one. Unlike the G Pro, the TCA Yoke has full-throw controls and 180 degrees of rotation. This provides very precise control of pitch and roll.\n\nIf you fly a lot of yoke-based airliners, the TCA Yoke is a great match.\n\nRudder Pedals\n\nReal-world pilots would never dream of flying an aircraft without working rudder pedals. Well, except Ercoupe pilots.\n\nAnyone who’s tried to enter a sideslip during a crosswind landing with a twist grip knows how hard it is. Dedicated rudder pedals provide much finer control over the rudder and wheel brakes.\n\nThe biggest drawbacks to rudder pedals are that 1) they are somewhat expensive, and 2) they can take up a lot of room.\n\nBut if you’re looking for the most realistic sim experience, rudder pedals are a must-have.\n\nEntry Level\n\nThe Logitech G Pro pedals are good for casual simmers who want improved rudder and brake control.\n\nThese pedals do everything more expensive products do: control the rudder and brakes. The main difference is that the G Pros are mostly plastic and use lower-quality sensors. This means they aren’t quite as precise or durable as high-end pedals.\n\nMid-Tier\n\nThe MFG Crosswind pedals are twice the price of the Logitech pedals, but they are a significant step up in quality.\n\nThe Crosswinds use Hall sensors for both rudder and brakes, making them very precise. They are also substantial in build and can take abuse from lead-footed pilots.\n\nOne neat feature is that the pedals themselves are interchangeable. You can buy replica pedals for Cessna, TBM, Airbus, and fighter aircraft.\n\nThese pedals do require a bit of tinkering. So, the Crosswind may not be the best choice if you want to plug in and start flying right away.\n\nHigher-End\n\nThe Thrustmaster TPR pedals are as solid and substantial as they look.\n\nThe pendular mechanism works differently from the Logitech and MFG pedals. Because of this design, the TPR pedals have a sizeable and hefty base.\n\nThis may be no big deal if you have a dedicated sim area. But if you need to store the pedals between each use, the size of the TPR pedals may be an issue.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWant to read more about rudder pedals? Check out The Best Flight Simulator Rudder Pedals.\n\nThrottles/Thrust Levers\n\nAccording to Navigraph’s 2023 survey, throttle quadrants are the number one add-on peripheral.\n\nYes, some joysticks have built-in throttle controls. But their small size makes them difficult to operate with precision.\n\nAnd what if you want to control multiple engines separately? Or adjust the propeller pitch or fuel/air mixture?\n\nFor these tasks, you need a separate throttle quadrant.\n\nEntry Level\n\nThe Logitech G Pro throttle quadrant is by far the most affordable option.\n\nThis unit has three axes of control and a good range of motion. Use the classic throttle/propeller/mixture configuration for propeller GA aircraft. For jets, change one of the levers to a flap or speed brake control.\n\nLogitech provides a few extra interchangeable knobs to keep things looking clean.\n\nOne issue with this quadrant is the plastic construction. There aren’t many reports of users breaking this unit, but it feels like you might. Also, the exposed sensors tend to get dusty, which reduces control precision.\n\nBut for $60, it’s hard to beat the G Pro.\n\nMid-Tier\n\nThrustmaster designed its TCA Quadrant Airbus Edition to pair with the TCA stick. But there’s no reason you can’t use it with any system.\n\nAs with the TCA stick, the quadrant uses Hall sensors, which are precise and resistant to dust. This makes this unit a solid upgrade from the G Pro. But like the G Pro, the plastic construction won’t take much abuse.\n\nSince there are only two thrust levers, the TCA quadrant is best used for jet or FADEC aircraft.\n\nHigher-End: Civilian\n\nHoneycomb hit it out of the park with their Bravo Throttle Quadrant.\n\nThis unit gets top marks for both GA and jet simulation. It comes with six high-quality throttle axes as well as a trim wheel. If that wasn’t all, it has gear, flap, lights, and autopilot controls.\n\nLike the Alpha yoke, the Bravo quadrant is very well constructed. However, it is a large unit, so some users may have difficulty finding a place to put it.\n\nLike the G Pro, the Bravo comes with switchable knobs for both prop and jet aircraft.\n\nWe hope Honeycomb can continue producing the Bravo. There is really nothing else quite like it available!\n\nHigher-End: Military\n\nFor military enthusiasts, it’s hard to top the VIRPIL VPC MongoosT-50CM3 Throttle.\n\nThe smooth split-throttle design is solidly built with high-quality digital sensors. There is no shortage of buttons and knobs, which are all right at your fingertips.\n\nThere’s even adjustable backlighting and customizable icons for the buttons.\n\nOf course, this unit comes with a rather large price tag. But for those who need the best customizable throttle out there, the MongoosT is a top choice.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWant to read more about throttle quadrants? Check out the Top 5 Throttle Quadrants.\n\nAdvanced Controllers\n\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of flight simulation is adjusting cockpit controls. Trying to tune the approach frequency with the mouse in turbulence is frustrating.\n\nThis is why many flight simmers eventually purchase radios and autopilot controllers. With these devices, you can adjust the controls while still keeping an eye on the instruments. This is very helpful for single-pilot instrument flight, especially when flying online.\n\nThe Honeycomb Bravo quadrant we discussed earlier has several built-in controls. But there are other control options available.\n\nLogitech offers three low-cost control panels: Flight Radio, Flight Multi, and Flight Switch. The first two are $150 each, and the Switch is $100. They are all USB devices and are easy to set up.\n\nAudio Visual\n\nMonitors\n\nWhen selecting a monitor for your flight sim setup, there are a few things to consider.\n\nThe most important considerations are screen size and resolution.\n\nThere is a lot to see when you’re flying an aircraft. Yes, a good view of the outside world is essential, but you must also be able to read the instruments accurately. A small screen or a low resolution makes that difficult.\n\nWe recommend at least a 27″ monitor with a minimum 1080p resolution. Larger screens will require higher resolutions (1440p, 4k).\n\nIf your GPU can handle it, consider expanding your view with multiple monitors. A multi-monitor or ultrawide monitor setup can really heighten the sensation of flying.\n\nBottom line: the larger the screen, the more immersive the experience.\n\nHead Trackers\n\nHead trackers allow you to virtually look around the cockpit just by moving your head. without a tracker, you’re limited to panning around by using a mouse or joystick buttons.\n\nA system like TrackIR uses infrared light from a monitor-mounted device to sense head movements. A slight movement triggers the sim to pan the view in the direction that you’re looking. This makes visual flight rules (VFR) flying much easier and a whole lot more fun.\n\nVR Headsets\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) headsets are a significant step up from head trackers.\n\nThese devices entirely replace your monitor with a stereoscopic headset. They track head movements to give you a 360-degree view of the cockpit. With a slight tilt of your head, you can even peep out an open side window of your Cessna!\n\nVR headsets can give you a depth of vision that no flat monitor can offer.\n\nThere is no doubt that VR is the future of flight simulation. The only thing holding most simmers back is the investment required. The VR headset alone isn’t too big of an expense. But you’ll need a powerful computer to run the VR headset with a flight simulator.\n\nVR headsets do have some drawbacks, particularly for instrument flight rules (IFR) flight. The resolution of VR headsets is still not as good as with a standard monitor. This makes reading the instruments difficult, which makes subtle control corrections challenging.\n\nAdditionally, the headset prevents you from seeing controllers, notepads, EFBs, and paper charts.\n\nBut for flying VFR, VR headsets are a game-changer.\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 is a solid option for an affordable, fairly high-resolution VR kit at $650.\n\nSpeakers and Headphones\n\nAudio reproduction is an often overlooked aspect of flight simulation. Nothing destroys the immersion more than tinny, weak audio. Quality systems allow you to hear the engines’ thrum and the tires’ chirp in high resolution.\n\nMost flight simmers opt for a good-quality stereo pair of speakers or a headset.\n\nEdifier R33BT speakers are a great choice for an entry-level stereo system. If you want to upgrade to surround sound, consider the Logitech Z906 5.1 system.\n\nIf you plan to fly with online ATC, consider getting both speakers and a headset. The speakers will play the simulator sounds and you’ll use the headset only for ATC. This is as close as you can get to real-world ATC comms!\n\nFor a budget headset, check out the Logitech G335 headset. If you want to step things up a notch, take a look at the Bose QuietComfort 35 headset.\n\nPut Together Your Sim Setup\n\nHow Much Does It Cost to Set Up a Home Flight Simulator?\n\nWe’ve given you a lot of options to think about.\n\nHow much does putting all these components together into a flight sim system cost?\n\nLet’s check out some examples.\n\nEntry-Level Setup\n\nXbox S ($300) + Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick ($90) + MSFS ($60) + 27″ Acer Monitor ($110) = $560\n\nMid-Tier PC Setup\n\nAcer Predator Orion ($1,000) + Honeycomb Alpha Yoke ($250) + MFG Crosswind Pedals ($330) + Thrustmaster TCA Airbus Quadrant ($130) + Logitech Flight Radio and Multi ($300) + MSFS Deluxe ($90) + LG Ultrawide 29″ Monitor ($200) = $2,300\n\nMid-Tier Mac Setup\n\niMac ($1,700) + VKB Gladiator NXT EVO ($175) + MFG Crosswind Pedals ($330) + Honeycomb Bravo Quadrant ($280) + X-Plane 12 ($80) = $2,565\n\nHigher-End Setup\n\nXForce Comet PC ($2,300) + Honeycomb Bravo Quadrant ($280) + Thrustmaster TPR Pedals ($600) + Thrustmaster TCA Yoke ($400) + MSFS Premium ($120) + Meta Quest 3 ($650) = $4,350\n\nHow To Use a Home Flight Simulator\n\nNow that you’ve put your system together, it’s time to understand how it works.\n\nLearn the Software\n\nIf you’re new to flight simulation, setting everything up for the first time takes some effort. We recommend seeking out YouTube tutorials for your particular sim software. These guides will take you step-by-step through the configuration process.\n\nSpend some time to understand the graphics settings. It takes some tinkering to balance good visual quality and fast frame rates. YouTube tutorials are a great resource for graphics tweaking.\n\nKeep a keyboard shortcut list handy for the first few weeks. Once you learn the shortcuts, operating your sim will be a much smoother experience.\n\nTrain for Success\n\nIf you’re new to flying, taking training lessons will make using your sim a lot more fun.\n\nOne great thing about MSFS is that it comes with “flight school” training lessons. These lessons cover everything from the basics of flight to advanced instrument skills.\n\nX-Plane doesn’t have any built-in lessons. However, Gleim Aviation offers an X-Plane training course for $100.\n\nIncrease the Realism\n\nMany people ask, “How realistic are home flight simulators?”\n\nFlight simulators can’t possibly replicate the sensations of actual flight. Even the sims at airliner training centers don’t feel quite like the real thing.\n\nHowever, home sims are quickly catching up to the pro airline setups in many ways. The latest study-level aircraft operate surprisingly close to their real-world counterparts. Online networks allow sim pilots to fly with other aircraft while under ATC control.\n\nThe built-in aircraft that come with sim software are much better than they used to be. But most serious sim pilots eventually explore third-party add-ons to increase the realism.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll cover some ways you can make your sim experience as realistic as possible.\n\nAddons and Networks\n\nAdd-on Aircraft\n\nIf you want to take your sim experience to the next level, we recommend checking out these add-on aircraft for MSFS.\n\nThe PMDG 737 series is an incredibly realistic rendition of Boeing’s classic airliner. PMDG replicated almost every knob and switch in the aircraft. The flight management computer (FMS) works almost exactly like the real thing.\n\nIf you prefer smaller aircraft, the A2A Commanche is highly recommended. The designer used his real-world Commanche as the basis for the sim version. A2A painstakingly recreated not only the operation but also the feel of the aircraft.\n\nIf you want to try a more advanced aircraft without spending any money, look at the FBW A320. This rendition of the Airbus A320 is the perfect way to get your feet wet in more advanced aircraft.\n\nFor X-Plane, we recommend the highly accurate Felis 747-200 and iniBuilds A300.\n\nVATSIM and Pilot Edge\n\nMSFS and X-Plane have built-in ATC systems, but they’re fairly limited in functionality.\n\nIf you want the most realistic sim experience, check out VATSIM and PilotEdge. These apps connect your sim to a network of real-world air traffic controllers. The controllers guide you just like their real-world equivalents. These networks are the best way to improve real-world flying skills.\n\nVATSIM is a free system and can be a bit more casual due to the varied qualifications of the pilots. However, coverage is worldwide.\n\nPilotEdge is a paid service. It offers highly professional controllers in a realistic environment. The coverage is not worldwide but limited to select locations in the U.S.\n\nNavigraph and SimBrief\n\nIf you’re serious about precision flying, consider getting a Navigraph subscription.\n\nFor a reasonable monthly fee, Navigraph provides worldwide Jeppesen aeronautical charts. It even has a sophisticated electronic flight bag (EFB) app for your computer or tablet.\n\nIn addition, you get updated navigational aid data for your sim. This ensures that your sim reflects the real world as closely as possible.\n\nIf you fly online with VATSIM or PilotEdge, a Navigraph subscription is a must.\n\nFor flight planning, check out Navigraph’s SimBrief site. SimBrief is free to use and creates sophisticated and realistic flight plans.\n\nConclusion\n\nSetting up a home flight simulator is an exciting journey.\n\nModern sim systems offer a level of realism and immersion that was unthinkable only a few years ago. Even with this incredible new tech, getting into flight simulation is as affordable as ever.\n\nWe hope this guide can help you build the sim system of your dreams. But beware: flight simulation is addicting!\n\nAre you planning on becoming a real-world pilot and want to know how sims fit into your training?"
