        "text": "Abstract The burgeoning use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) has, regrettably, not been met with an appropriate integration of training science into UAS training efforts. At best, current UAS training efforts are fragmented; at worst, they are ineffective (Stulberg, 2007). However, this need not be the case. Though nascent, the UAS literature has identified many necessary knowledge, skill, and attitude (KSA) components of UAS operation. This article works to aid the UAS training community in combining practice with science.\n\nAs a nation, we are in the middle of discussions and debates regarding the current and future use of unmanned systems. Whether it’s the ethical or legal debates regarding “drone” strikes in the Middle East and Northern Africa, or the safety, security and privacy concerns with the use of domestic drones (or unmanned systems) in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airspace, the debate will continue. However, leading drone experts inside and outside of government all agree that drones are here to stay, and the proliferation of these systems will continue to explode over the next decade."
