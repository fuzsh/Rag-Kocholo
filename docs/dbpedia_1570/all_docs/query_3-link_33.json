        "text": "VBS4 Capabilities for Drone Experimentation and Training\n\nBISim’s virtual simulation software, VBS4, simulates a wide range of military and civilian/dual-use drone systems, both human-operated and partially or fully autonomous. These systems are being used by VBS4 customers to train and experiment with:\n\nsystem capabilities and concepts of employment;\n\nhuman-machine interaction/interfaces;\n\ntactics, techniques, and procedure (TTP) development;\n\nmission commanders, operators, and analysts training;\n\ntraining commanders to employ systems efficiently and effectively;\n\ntraining autonomous intelligence software through the provision of synthetic imagery; and\n\nrehearsing missions.\n\nDid you know that VBS4 simulates over 50 drone systems covering the maritime, land, and air domains?\n\nVBS4 includes over 50 drone models to provide numerous opportunities for more realistic and complex training. The below infographic shows some of the VBS4 drone systems for sea, air, land, and civilian dual use for you to use immediately.\n\n1. Providing a rich and complex environment for experimentation, concept development, and training\n\nVBS4 provides a rich tactical environment perfect for recreating real-world situations where high-fidelity “clutter” is required to provide a suitable environment. VBS4 can either replicate UAS system information for desktop applications for training and experimentation, or it can be used to create a STANAG 4609 (NATO Digital Motion Imagery Standard) video stream that iscan be visualized on real ground control stations or third-party command and control systems.\n\n2. Including a variety of sensors for real-time processing of imagery\n\nElectro-optical sensors are the primary sensors used on drones to provide real-time targeting feedback and data for autonomous systems. VBS4 includes optical, infrared, and thermal views, giving the flexibility to switch between these views as needed.\n\nMoreover, VBS4 has recently introduced radar capabilities and Electronic Warfare (EW) support, further enhancing the ability to emulate advanced drone sensor systems.\n\nExample VBS4 sensor views\n\n3. Including a variety of sensors for real-time processing of imagery\n\nUsing the VBS Software Development Kit (SDK), manufacturers can integrate real hardware systems with VBS4 to control multiple simulated drone systems, providing a virtual environment to test and demonstrate their system capabilities and train operators on the entire system loop, including command, control, and reporting processes.\n\n4. Training AI for autonomous systems using VBS4 simulation\n\nAutonomous systems can be tested in the VBS4 simulation, algorithms evaluated, and then integrated into higher-level tactical scenarios to understand the interactions between AI and humans. This can then be further evaluated in real life and finally refined back in the simulation to incorporate capabilities that are too expensive or difficult to use real systems for.\n\nCustomer Use Cases\n\nThe use of VBS4 with its drone capabilities is only limited by the users’ operational needs or creative experimentation. The following customer use cases illustrate how VBS4 has been tailored to meet the unique needs of customers for a variety of drone system applications across different sectors, from military to civilian.\n\nISR Simulation and Training | BISim\n\nRemotely Piloted Aircraft and Air Operations Center Training | BISim\n\nUnmanned Aerial Systems Training | BISim\n\nHow militaries are using VBS4 to deploy autonomous vehicles on future battlefields\n\nLeverage VBS4 for Your Drone Operations\n\nVBS4’s capabilities to support your drone operations are proven by a large number of real customer use cases for experimentation, concept development, training, and mission rehearsal. VBS4 provides organizations with the ability to replicate real-world tactical scenarios in complex physical and human terrain, using a wide variety of sensors and targeting systems that are critical for drone operations. VBS4 drone operators train in a realistic environment, practicing the scenarios they encounter during actual missions. With this training, personnel gain valuable experience and knowledge, preparing for multiple scenarios, enabling them to make better decisions in real-world situations.\n\nIf you’d like a demonstration or to know more about the world of drones in VBS4, you just need to contact sales@bisimulations.com, and we’d love to show you more.
