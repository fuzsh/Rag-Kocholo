        "text": "Abstract\n\nUAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) performs various kinds of missions such as mobile tactical reconnaissance, surveillance, law enforcement, search and rescue, land management, environmental monitoring, disaster management. UAV is a complex and challenging system to develop. It operates autonomously in unknown and dynamically changing environment. This requires different types of subsystems to cooperate. In order to realize all functionalities of the UAV, the software part becomes very complex real-time system expected to execute real-time tasks concurrently. This paper describes proposed software architecture for GCS (Ground Control Station) for lightweight UAV purpose-built for medium-scale reconnaissance and surveillance missions in civil area. The overall system architecture and implementation are described.\n\nCited By\n\nView all\n\nBonache-Seco JLopez-Orozco JBesada-Portas ERisco-Martín JART-GCSProceedings of the Annual Simulation Symposium10.5555/3338027.3338040(1-12)\n\nJovanovic MStarcevic DJovanovic ZBridging User Context and Design Models to Build Adaptive User InterfacesProceedings of the 5th IFIP WG 13.2 International Conference on Human-Centered Software Engineering - Volume 874210.1007/978-3-662-44811-3_3(36-56)\n\nPerez DMaza ICaballero FScarlatti DCasado EOllero AA Ground Control Station for a Multi-UAV Surveillance SystemJournal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems10.1007/s10846-012-9759-569:1-4(119-130)\n\nIndex Terms\n\nSoftware Architecture for Ground Control Station for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n\nApplied computing\n\nComputers in other domains\n\nOperations research\n\nIndustry and manufacturing\n\nCommand and control\n\nComputer systems organization\n\nEmbedded and cyber-physical systems\n\nRobotics\n\nRobotic autonomy\n\nSoftware and its engineering\n\nSoftware organization and properties\n\nSoftware system structures\n\nSoftware architectures\n\nRecommendations\n\nIntegral Backstepping Control of an Unconventional Dual-Fan Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n\nIn this paper, a dynamic model of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aerial vehicles, having lateral and longitudinal rotor tilting mechanism, is first developed using a Newton---Euler formulation.
