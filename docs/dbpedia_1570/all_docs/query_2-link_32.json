        "text": "sUAS Safety Certification: Level 1\n\nThis certification program evaluates 11 major competencies of UAS technology derived from lessons-learned in traditional aviation. Knowledge and skill sets are tailored for the needs and requirements of Remote Pilots to safely deliver on the value propositions afforded from drone technology.\n\nImportant Note: Curriculum is available through USI to prepare for the exam but not required to sit for the proctored certification exam\n\n1. UAS Foundations: Terms of reference, history of UAS technology, issues facing UAS integration, datalink overview, and developmental and regulatory history\n\n2. Unmanned Aircraft: UAS as the combined application of computer science, mechanical and electrical engineering, designed and created as an unmanned aircraft, factors affecting aerodynamics and performance, and exploratory review of complex concepts related to aerodynamics, robotics, and electricity\n\n3. The Elements: The environment in which UAS operate\n\n4. FAA Regulations: 14 CFR Part 107\n\n5. National Airspace: Operations in the National Airspace System\n\n6. Human Factors and Crew Resource Management: Introduction to human limitations as they contribute to both errors and violations as well as successful operations\n\n7. Aeronautical Decision Making: Understanding the science, assessing risk, decision making process, safety best practices\n\n8. Professional Remote Pilot: Ethical and legal requirements of Remote Pilot, Standards of Practice, and Cybersecurity\n\n9. Datalinks: Electromagnetic Spectrum, signal propagation, influences on UAS communication\n\n10. UAS Control: Control Station Dynamics, Autonomy vs. Direct Control, Simulation\n\n11. Payloads: Hardware and Software resulting in Data Acquisition, Sensors, Economic Impacts\n\nsUAS Safety Certification: Level 2\n\nRequires candidate submission of their Part 107 Remote Pilot Certification. This credential is an add-on to the Level 1 Safety Certification. Note: The curriculum provided by USI for preparation to pass the sUAS Safety Certification: Level 1 exam, also prepares a learner to pass the FAA's Part 107 Exam (Unmanned Aircraft General Exam)\n\nUSI offers a curriculum program to deliver knowledge required for both the FAA Part 107 exam and safety certification which consists of 13 online modules, which cover the preceding key themes in sequence in order to build the learners competency in the field of UAS aviation safety. The certifications signify an individual that can legally fly unmanned aircraft for hire and holds USI's sUAS Safety Certification.\n\nCoursework is not required to sit for certification."
