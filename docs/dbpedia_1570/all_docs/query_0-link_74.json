        "text": "The main deliverable of the EUSCG is the European UAS Standardisation Rolling Development Plan.\n\nIt brings together all relevant regulatory and standardisation activities and their status, and is updated regularly in order to maintain visibility and awareness of the progress.\n\nIt provides a method for the identification and discussion of overlaps, and as a basis for feedback to contributing organisations, to improve overall coordination of standards developments. The process also identifies the technical input from other sources into the standards plan through the interfaces of the EUSCG with the international level."
