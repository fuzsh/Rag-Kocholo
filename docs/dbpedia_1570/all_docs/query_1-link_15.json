        "text": "Flying a drone under 55 lbs for hire will fall under the regulations in 14 CFR Part 107, referred to as the Small UAS Rule. If you are flying purely for personal enjoyment, there are a simple set of requirements to follow. Before the drone lifts off its platform, you should know the purpose of your flight, and what regulations will apply.\n\nTo determine which rules apply to you, complete the FAAâ€™s What Kind of Drone Flyer Are You? Questionnaire Opens in new window to find out."
