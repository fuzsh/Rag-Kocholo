        "text": "It is recommended that participants of this training complete one of the following AASHTO Technical Training Solutions (previously TC3) as a prerequisite to this course. KYTC employees may access these courses free of charge via MyPurpose. Local government agencies may access these courses free of charge with a promotional code. Contact Brittany Cloyd to obtain the current local government discount code for Technical Training Solutions courses.\n\nTC3 Introduction to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAS) for Highway Transportation\n\nThis training course introduces the applications of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for a variety of projects within highway transportation planning and construction. As part of this training, participants will learn about the types and features of UAS, the legal and regulatory considerations around operating UAS in the field, how to determine if UAS technology is the appropriate application for the project need, as well as participate in general activities to prepare and utilize UAS in the field. Note: This course is not intended to prepare for the FAA Part 107 licensing preparations. It will, however, be a good starting point for those interested in pursuing licensure in support of their role at their transportation agency. This course offers professional development hours (PDHs).\n\nAASHTO Store Link for UAS for Highway Transportation\n\nTC3 Application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAS) for Bridge Inspections\n\nWhat if you could generate high-resolution images and videos of any bridge surface while keeping inspectors and crew out of potentially dangerous locations? Well, you can. Unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, are changing the way we do bridge inspections. More and more engineers are choosing UAS over traditional methods like bucket trucks or snooper cranes - and it's easy to see why. UAS inspections save time, money, and lower risk. This course covers a range of topics related to UAS and bridge inspections. Module 1 will provide an overview of UAS and the challenges related to bridge inspection and management. Module 2 will walk you through the benefits of UAS for bridge inspections, and Module 3 will outline current trends and considerations you need to be aware of. Finally, Module 4 will provide examples of real bridge inspections that have used UAS technology. Note that this course will not prepare you for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 107 licensing exam."
