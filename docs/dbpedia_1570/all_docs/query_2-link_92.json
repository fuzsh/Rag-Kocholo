        "text": "Ground control station software design for micro aerial vehicles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWalendziuk, Wojciech; Oldziej, Daniel; Binczyk, Dawid Przemyslaw; Slowik, Maciej\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis article describes the process of designing the equipment part and the software of a ground control station used for configuring and operating micro unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). All the works were conducted on a quadrocopter model being a commonly accessible commercial construction. This article contains a characteristics of the research object, the basics of operating the micro aerial vehicles (MAV) and presents components of the ground control station model. It also describes the communication standards for the purpose of building a model of the station. Further part of the work concerns the software of the product - the GIMSO application (Generally Interactive Station for Mobile Objects), which enables the user to manage the actions and communication and control processes from the UAV. The process of creating the software and the field tests of a station model are also presented in the article.\n\nSystem and method for transferring telemetry data between a ground station and a control center\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRay, Timothy J. (Inventor); Ly, Vuong T. (Inventor)\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDisclosed herein are systems, computer-implemented methods, and tangible computer-readable media for coordinating communications between a ground station, a control center, and a spacecraft. The method receives a call to a simple, unified application programmer interface implementing communications protocols related to outer space, when instruction relates to receiving a command at the control center for the ground station generate an abstract message by agreeing upon a format for each type of abstract message with the ground station and using a set of message definitions to configure the command in the agreed upon format, encode the abstract message to generate an encoded message, and transfer the encoded message to the ground station, and perform similar actions when the instruction relates to receiving a second command as a second encoded message at the ground station from the control center and when the determined instruction type relates to transmitting information to the control center.\n\nScaled Composites' Doug Shane examines the screen of his ground control station during tests in New Mexico.

The currently planned operating mode for these robotic systems during the assembly phase is teleoperation by intravehicular activity (IVA) crewmembers. While this operating mode is less hazardous and expensive than manned EVA operations, and has insignificant control loop time delays, the amount of IVA time available to support telerobotic operations is much less than the anticipated requirements. Some alternative is needed to allow the robotic systems to perform useful tasks without exhausting the available IVA resources; ground control is one such alternative. The issues associated with ground control of SSF robotic systems to alleviate onboard crew time availability constraints are investigated. Key technical issues include the effect of communication time delays, the need for safe, reliable execution of remote operations, and required modifications to the SSF ground and flight system architecture. Time delay compensation techniques such as predictive displays and world model-based force reflection are addressed and collision detection and avoidance strategies to ensure the safety of the on-orbit crew, Orbiter, and SSF are described. Although more time consuming and difficult than IVA controlled teleoperations or manned EVA, ground controlled telerobotic operations offer significant benefits during the SSF assembly phase, and should be considered in assembly planning activities.\n\nEvaluation of Early Ground Control Station Configurations for Interacting with a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) System\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDao, Arik-Quang V.; Martin, Lynne; Mohlenbrink, Christoph; Bienert, Nancy; Wolte, Cynthia; Gomez, Ashley; Claudatos, Lauren; Mercer, Joey\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to report on a human factors evaluation of ground control station design concepts for interacting with an unmanned traffic management system. The data collected for this paper comes from recent field tests for NASA's Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) project, and covers the following topics; workload, situation awareness, as well as flight crew communication, coordination, and procedures. The goal of this evaluation was to determine if the various software implementations for interacting with the UTM system can be described and classified into design concepts to provide guidance for the development of future UTM interfaces. We begin with a brief description of NASA's UTM project, followed by a description of the test range configuration related to a second development phase. We identified (post hoc) two classes in which the ground control stations could be grouped. This grouping was based on level of display integration. The analysis was exploratory and informal. It was conducted to compare ground stations across those two classes and against the aforementioned topics. Herein, we discuss the results.\n\nATS-F ground station integration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe ATS ground stations were described, including a system description, operational frequencies and bandwidth, and a discussion of individual subsystems. Each station configuration is described as well as its floor plan. The station performance, as tested by the GSI, is displayed in chart form providing a summary of the more important parameters tested. This chart provides a listing of test data, by site, for comparison purposes. Also included is a description of the ATS-6 experiments, the equipment, and interfaces required to perform these experiments. The ADP subsystem and its role in the experiments is also described. A description of each program task and a summary of the activities performed were then given. These efforts were accomplished at the Rosman II Ground Station, located near Rosman N.C., the Mojave Ground Station, located near Barstow Ca., and the GSI Contractors plant located near Baltimore, Md.\n\nPath planning and Ground Control Station simulator for UAV\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAjami, A.; Balmat, J.; Gauthier, J.-P.; Maillot, T.\n\nIn this paper we present a Universal and Interoperable Ground Control Station (UIGCS) simulator for fixed and rotary wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and all types of payloads. One of the major constraints is to operate and manage multiple legacy and future UAVs, taking into account the compliance with NATO Combined/Joint Services Operational Environment (STANAG 4586). Another purpose of the station is to assign the UAV a certain degree of autonomy, via autonomous planification/replanification strategies. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the non-linear models of the fixed and rotary wing UAVs that we use in the simulator. In Section 3, we describe the simulator architecture, which is based upon interacting modules programmed independently. This simulator is linked with an open source flight simulator, to simulate the video flow and the moving target in 3D. To conclude this part, we tackle briefly the problem of the Matlab/Simulink software connection (used to model the UAV's dynamic) with the simulation of the virtual environment. Section 5 deals with the control module of a flight path of the UAV. The control system is divided into four distinct hierarchical layers: flight path, navigation controller, autopilot and flight control surfaces controller. In the Section 6, we focus on the trajectory planification/replanification question for fixed wing UAV. Indeed, one of the goals of this work is to increase the autonomy of the UAV. We propose two types of algorithms, based upon 1) the methods of the tangent and 2) an original Lyapunov-type method. These algorithms allow either to join a fixed pattern or to track a moving target. Finally, Section 7 presents simulation results obtained on our simulator, concerning a rather complicated scenario of mission.\n\nDeveloping an Adaptable NextGen Interface for the UAS Ground Control Station\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMurphy, James R.; Otto, Neil; Jovic, Srba; Carniol, Ted; Kotegawa, Tatsuya\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPresently a significant number of unmanned aircraft are not included in the existing National Airspace System surveillance system. This is due to many reasons including an inability to carry Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast equipment for weight or power consumption deficiencies, legacy equipment usage, and the experimental nature of unmanned aircraft. In addition, pilots on the ground do not have the situation awareness to proximal aircraft pilots in the cockpit have. However, many unmanned aircraft utilize a link between the aircraft and ground control station that includes periodic updates to the aircraft position. Technologies have been developed to provide the existing national surveillance system with the location of the aircraft while at the same time providing the ground pilot a display with aircraft that are in the aircrafts proximity, thus expanding the national surveillance data as well as provide increased pilot situation awareness.\n\nDoD Comprehensive Military Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Smart Device Ground Control Station Threat Model\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-04-01\n\ndesign , imple- mentation, and test evaluation were interviewed to evaluate the existing gaps in the DoD processes for cybersecurity.

The architecture targets fully automated routine operations encompassing scheduling and resource allocation, antenna and receiver predict generation. track procedure generation from service requests, and closed loop control and error recovery for the station subsystems. This architecture has been validated by the construction of a prototype DS-T station, which has performed a series of demonstrations of autonomous ground station control for downlink services with NASA's Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).\n\nFuzzy Control/Space Station automation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGersh, Mark\n\n1990-01-01\n\nViewgraphs on fuzzy control/space station automation are presented. Topics covered include: Space Station Freedom (SSF); SSF evolution; factors pointing to automation & robotics (A&R); astronaut office inputs concerning A&R; flight system automation and ground operations applications; transition definition program; and advanced automation software tools.\n\nTDRSS data handling and management system study. Ground station systems for data handling and relay satellite control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1973-01-01\n\nResults of a two-phase study of the (Data Handling and Management System DHMS) are presented. An original baseline DHMS is described. Its estimated costs are presented in detail. The DHMS automates the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) ground station's functions and handles both the forward and return link user and relay satellite data passing through the station. Direction of the DHMS is effected via a TDRSS Operations Control Central (OCC) that is remotely located. A composite ground station system, a modified DHMS (MDHMS), was conceptually developed. The MDHMS performs both the DHMS and OCC functions. Configurations and costs are presented for systems using minicomputers and midicomputers. It is concluded that a MDHMS should be configured with a combination of the two computer types. The midicomputers provide the system's organizational direction and computational power, and the minicomputers (or interface processors) perform repetitive data handling functions that relieve the midicomputers of these burdensome tasks.\n\nOrion Navigation Sensitivities to Ground Station Infrastructure for Lunar Missions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGetchius, Joel; Kukitschek, Daniel; Crain, Timothy\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) will replace the Space Shuttle and serve as the next-generation spaceship to carry humans to the International Space Station and back to the Moon for the first time since the Apollo program. As in the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs, the Mission Control Navigation team will utilize radiometric measurements to determine the position and velocity of the CEV. In the case of lunar missions, the ground station infrastructure consisting of approximately twelve stations distributed about the Earth and known as the Apollo Manned Spaceflight Network, no longer exists. Therefore, additional tracking resources will have to be allocated or constructed to support mission operations for Orion lunar missions. This paper examines the sensitivity of Orion navigation for lunar missions to the number and distribution of tracking sites that form the ground station infrastructure.\n\nFederated Ground Station Network Model and Interface Specification\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2014-12-01\n\ninterface definition language JSON JavaScript Object Notation LEO low Earth orbit LNA low-noise amplifier MC3 Mobile CubeSat Command and Control...Naval Research Laboratory OQPSK offset quadrature phase-shift keying xviii P2P peer-to-peer PKI public key infrastructure REST Representational...enhanced our work being performed on the Mobile CubeSat Command and Control (MC3) ground station network.

Due to the loss of inclination control for the symphonie satellites, it became necessary to equip the parabolic antennas of the mobile Symphonie ground station with tracking facilities. For the relatively low required tracking accuracy of 0.5 dB, a low cost, step track system was selected. The step track system developed for this purpose and tested over a long period of time in 7 ground stations is based on a search step method with subsequent parabola interpolation. As compared with the real search step method, the system has the advantage of a higher pointing angle resolution, and thus a higher tracking accuracy. When the pilot signal has been switched off for a long period of time, as for instance after the eclipse, the antenna is repointed towards the satellite by an automatically initiated spiral search scan. The function and design of the tracking system are detailed, while easy handling and tracking results.\n\nAdvanced ground station architecture\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZillig, David; Benjamin, Ted\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis paper describes a new station architecture for NASA's Ground Network (GN). The architecture makes efficient use of emerging technologies to provide dramatic reductions in size, operational complexity, and operational and maintenance costs. The architecture, which is based on recent receiver work sponsored by the Office of Space Communications Advanced Systems Program, allows integration of both GN and Space Network (SN) modes of operation in the same electronics system. It is highly configurable through software and the use of charged coupled device (CCD) technology to provide a wide range of operating modes. Moreover, it affords modularity of features which are optional depending on the application. The resulting system incorporates advanced RF, digital, and remote control technology capable of introducing significant operational, performance, and cost benefits to a variety of NASA communications and tracking applications.\n\nDesign and Performance of the Acts Gigabit Satellite Network High Data-Rate Ground Station\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHoder, Doug; Kearney, Brian\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe ACTS High Data-Rate Ground stations were built to support the ACTS Gigabit Satellite Network (GSN). The ACTS GSN was designed to provide fiber-compatible SONET service to remote nodes and networks through a wideband satellite system. The ACTS satellite is unique in its extremely wide bandwidth, and electronically controlled spot beam antennas. This paper discusses the requirements, design and performance of the RF section of the ACTS High Data-Rate Ground Stations and constituent hardware. The ACTS transponder systems incorporate highly nonlinear hard limiting. This introduced a major complexity in to the design and subsequent modification of the ground stations. A discussion of the peculiarities of the A CTS spacecraft transponder system and their impact is included.\n\nPhotovoltaic central station step and touch potential considerations in grounding system design\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEngmann, G.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe probability of hazardous step and touch potentials is an important consideration in central station grounding system design. Steam turbine generating station grounding system design is based on accepted industry practices and there is extensive in-service experience with these grounding systems. A photovoltaic (PV) central station is a relatively new concept and there is limited experience with PV station grounding systems. The operation and physical configuration of a PV central station is very different from a steam electric station. A PV station bears some similarity to a substation and the PV station step and touch potentials might be addressed as they are in substation design. However, the PV central station is a generating station and it is appropriate to examine the effect that the differences and similarities of the two types of generating stations have on step and touch potential considerations.\n\n47 CFR 22.815 - Construction period for general aviation ground stations.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-10-01\n\n... 47 Telecommunication 2 2014-10-01 2014-10-01 false Construction period for general aviation ground...

Assuming the X-band 105 Mbps transmitter of NASA s Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) satellite with a simple line-of-sight propagation model, the average daily download capacity in bits for a network of adaptive array ground stations is compared to that of a single 11 m dish in Poker Flats, Alaska. Each adaptive array ground station is assumed to have multiple steerable antennas, either mechanically steered dishes or phased arrays that are mechanically steered in azimuth and electronically steered in elevation. Phased array technologies that are being developed for this application are the space-fed lens (SFL) and the reflectarray. Optimization of the different boresight directions of the phased arrays within a ground station is shown to significantly increase capacity; for example, this optimization quadruples the capacity for a ground station with eight SFLs. Several networks comprising only two to three ground stations are shown to meet or exceed the capacity of the big dish, Cutting the data rate by half, which saves modem costs and increases the coverage area of each ground station, is shown to increase the average daily capacity of the network for some configurations.\n\nSteerable Space Fed Lens Array for Low-Cost Adaptive Ground Station Applications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, Richard Q.; Popovic, Zoya; Rondineau, Sebastien; Miranda, Felix A.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Space Fed Lens Array (SFLA) is an alternative to a phased array antenna that replaces large numbers of expensive solid-state phase shifters with a single spatial feed network. SFLA can be used for multi-beam application where multiple independent beams can be generated simultaneously with a single antenna aperture. Unlike phased array antennas where feed loss increases with array size, feed loss in a lens array with more than 50 elements is nearly independent of the number of elements, a desirable feature for large apertures. In addition, SFLA has lower cost as compared to a phased array at the expense of total volume and complete beam continuity. For ground station applications, both of these tradeoff parameters are not important and can thus be exploited in order to lower the cost of the ground station. In this paper, we report the development and demonstration of a 952-element beam-steerable SFLA intended for use as a low cost ground station for communicating and tracking of a low Earth orbiting satellite. The dynamic beam steering is achieved through switching to different feed-positions of the SFLA via a beam controller.\n\nGround station software for receiving and handling Irecin telemetry data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFerrante, M.; Petrozzi, M.; Di Ciolo, L.; Ortenzi, A.; Troso, G\n\n2004-11-01\n\nThe on board resources, needed to perform the mission tasks, are very limited in nano-satellites. This paper proposes a software system to receive, manage and process in Real Time the Telemetry data coming from IRECIN nanosatellite and transmit operator manual commands and operative procedures. During the receiving phase, it shows the IRECIN subsystem physical values, visualizes the IRECIN attitude, and performs other suitable functions. The IRECIN Ground Station program is in charge to exchange information between IRECIN and the Ground segment. It carries out, in real time during IRECIN transmission phase, IRECIN attitude drawing, sun direction drawing, power supply received from Sun, visualization of the telemetry data, visualization of Earth magnetic field and more other functions. The received data are memorized and interpreted by a module, parser, and distribute to the suitable modules. Moreover it allows sending manual and automatic commands. Manual commands are delivered by an operator, on the other hand, automatic commands are provided by pre-configured operative procedures. Operative procedures development is realized in a previous phase called configuration phase. This program is also in charge to carry out a test session by mean the scheduler and commanding modules allowing execution of specific tasks without operator control. A log module to memorize received and transmitted data is realized. A phase to analyze, filter and visualize in off line the collected data, called post analysis, is based on the data extraction form the log module. At the same time, the Ground Station Software can work in network allowing managing, receiving and sending data/commands from different sites. The proposed system constitutes the software of IRECIN Ground Station. IRECIN is a modular nanosatellite weighting less than 2 kg, constituted by sixteen external sides with surface-mounted solar cells and three internal Al plates, kept together by four steel bars.

R.; Revesz, W., Jr.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAt the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, processing facilities are being built and activated to support the processing, checkout, and launch of Space Station elements. The generic capability of these facilities will be utilized to support resupply missions for payloads, life support services, and propellants for the 30-year life of the program. Special Ground Support Equipment (GSE) is being designed for Space Station hardware special handling requirements, and a Test, Checkout, and Monitoring System (TCMS) is under development to verify that the flight elements are ready for launch. The facilities and equipment used at KSC, along with the testing required to accomplish the mission, are described in detail to provide an understanding of the complexity of operations at the launch site. Assessments of hardware processing flows through KSC are being conducted to minimize the processing flow times for each hardware element. Baseline operations plans and the changes made to improve operations and reduce costs are described, recognizing that efficient ground operations are a major key to success of the Space Station.\n\n76 FR 53883 - Proposed Information Collection; Comment Request; NOAA Satellite Ground Station Customer...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-08-30\n\n...

Adopting a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach to package reusable UAV control station functionality into common control services provides a number of benefits including enabling dynamic plug and play of components depending on changing mission requirements, supporting information sharing to the enterprise, and integrating information from authoritative sources such as mission planners with the UAV control stations data model. It also allows the wider enterprise community to use the services provided by unmanned systems and improve data quality to support more effective decision-making. We explore current challenges in migrating UAV control systems that manage multiple types of vehicles to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Service-oriented analysis involves reviewing legacy systems and determining which components can be made into a service. Existing UAV control stations provide audio/visual, navigation, and vehicle health and status information that are useful to C4I systems. However, many were designed to be closed systems with proprietary software and hardware implementations, message formats, and specific mission requirements. An architecture analysis can be performed that reviews legacy systems and determines which components can be made into a service. A phased SOA adoption approach can then be developed that improves system interoperability.\n\nHybrid Ground Station Technology for RF and Optical Communication Links\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDavarian, Faramaz; Hoppe, D.; Charles, J.; Vilnrotter, V.; Sehic, A.; Hanson, T.; Gam, E.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo support future enhancements of NASA's deep space and planetary communications and tracking services, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is developing a hybrid ground station that will be capable of simultaneously supporting RF and optical communications. The main reason for adding optical links to the existing RF links is to significantly increase the capacity of deep space communications in support of future solar system exploration. It is envisioned that a mission employing an optical link will also use an RF link for telemetry and emergency purposes, hence the need for a hybrid ground station. A hybrid station may also reduce operations cost by requiring fewer staff than would be required to operate two stations. A number of approaches and techniques have been examined. The most promising ones have been prototyped for field examination and validation.\n\nEclipse of the Floating Orbs: Controlling Robots on the International Space Station\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWheeler, D.

Astrobee will serve as a mobile camera, sensor platform, and research testbed when it is launched to the International Space Station (ISS)in 2017. Astronauts on the ISS as well as ground-based users will control Astrobee using the Eclipse-based Astrobee Control Station. Designing theControl Station for use in space presented unique challenges, such as allowing the intuitive input of 3D information without a mouse or trackpad.

The base technology is currently planned for the following control and monitor systems: portable Space Station checkout systems; ecological life support systems; Space Station logistics carrier system; and the ground system of the Delta Clipper (SX-2) in the Single-Stage Rocket Technology program.

In this regard the design of the communication system has to carefully take into account the ground station site and relevant signal phenomena, depending on the frequency band. To propose the optimal location of the ground station, these aspects become even more relevant to establish a trusted communication link due to the ground segment site in urban areas and/or selection of low orbits for the space segment. In addition, updated cartography with high resolution data of the location and its surroundings help to develop recommendations in the design of its location for spatial vehicles tracking and hence to improve effectiveness. The objectives of this analysis methodology are: completion of cartographic information, modelling the obstacles that hinder communication between the ground and space segment and representation in the generated 3D scene of the degree of impairment in the signal/noise of the phenomena that interferes with communication. The integration of new technologies of geographic data capture, such as 3D Laser Scan, determine that increased optimization of the antenna elevation mask, in its AOS and LOS azimuths along the horizon visible, maximizes visibility time with spatial vehicles. Furthermore, from the three-dimensional cloud of points captured, specific information is selected and, using 3D modeling techniques, the 3D scene of the antenna location site and surroundings is generated. The resulting 3D model evidences nearby obstacles related to the cartographic conditions such as mountain formations and buildings, and any additional obstacles that interfere with the operational quality of the antenna (other antennas and electronic devices that emit or receive in the same bandwidth\n\nOpen solutions to distributed control in ground tracking stations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHeuser, William Randy\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe advent of high speed local area networks has made it possible to interconnect small, powerful computers to function together as a single large computer. Today, distributed computer systems are the new paradigm for large scale computing systems. However, the communications provided by the local area network is only one part of the solution. The services and protocols used by the application programs to communicate across the network are as indispensable as the local area network. And the selection of services and protocols that do not match the system requirements will limit the capabilities, performance, and expansion of the system. Proprietary solutions are available but are usually limited to a select set of equipment. However, there are two solutions based on 'open' standards. The question that must be answered is 'which one is the best one for my job?' This paper examines a model for tracking stations and their requirements for interprocessor communications in the next century. The model and requirements are matched with the model and services provided by the five different software architectures and supporting protocol solutions. Several key services are examined in detail to determine which services and protocols most closely match the requirements for the tracking station environment. The study reveals that the protocols are tailored to the problem domains for which they were originally designed. Further, the study reveals that the process control model is the closest match to the tracking station model.\n\nCollaborative Software Development Approach Used to Deliver the New Shuttle Telemetry Ground Station\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKirby, Randy L.; Mann, David; Prenger, Stephen G.; Craig, Wayne; Greenwood, Andrew; Morsics, Jonathan; Fricker, Charles H.; Quach, Son; Lechese, Paul\n\n2003-01-01\n\nUnited Space Alliance (USA) developed and used a new software development method to meet technical, schedule, and budget challenges faced during the development and delivery of the new Shuttle Telemetry Ground Station at Kennedy Space Center. This method, called Collaborative Software Development, enabled KSC to effectively leverage industrial software and build additional capabilities to meet shuttle system and operational requirements. Application of this method resulted in reduced time to market, reduced development cost, improved product quality, and improved programmer competence while developing technologies of benefit to a small company in California (AP Labs Inc.). Many modifications were made to the baseline software product (VMEwindow), which improved its quality and functionality. In addition, six new software capabilities were developed, which are the subject of this article and add useful functionality to the VMEwindow environment. These new software programs are written in C or VXWorks and are used in conjunction with other ground station software packages, such as VMEwindow, Matlab, Dataviews, and PVWave. The Space Shuttle Telemetry Ground Station receives frequency-modulation (FM) and pulse-code-modulated (PCM) signals from the shuttle and support equipment. The hardware architecture (see figure) includes Sun workstations connected to multiple PCM- and FM-processing VersaModule Eurocard (VME) chassis. A reflective memory network transports raw data from PCM Processors (PCMPs) to the programmable digital-to-analog (D/A) converters, strip chart recorders, and analysis and controller workstations.\n\nAutonomous Navigation With Ground Station One-Way Forward-Link Doppler Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHorstkamp, G. M.; Niklewski, D. J.; Gramling, C. J.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has spent several years developing operational onboard navigation systems (ONS's) to provide real time autonomous, highly accurate navigation products for spacecraft using NASA's space and ground communication systems. The highly successful Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRSS) ONS (TONS) experiment on the Explorer Platform/Extreme Ultraviolet (EP/EUV) spacecraft, launched on June 7, 1992, flight demonstrated the ONS for high accuracy navigation using TDRSS forward link communication services. In late 1994, a similar ONS experiment was performed using EP/EUV flight hardware (the ultrastable oscillator and Doppler extractor card in one of the TDRSS transponders) and ground system software to demonstrate the feasibility of using an ONS with ground station forward link communication services. This paper provides a detailed evaluation of ground station-based ONS performance of data collected over a 20 day period. The ground station ONS (GONS) experiment results are used to project the expected performance of an operational system. The GONS processes Doppler data derived from scheduled ground station forward link services using a sequential estimation algorithm enhanced by a sophisticated process noise model to provide onboard orbit and frequency determination. Analysis of the GONS experiment performance indicates that real time onboard position accuracies of better than 125 meters (1 sigma) are achievable with two or more 5-minute contacts per day for the EP/EUV 525 kilometer altitude, 28.5 degree inclination orbit. GONS accuracy is shown to be a function of the fidelity of the onboard propagation model, the frequency/geometry of the tracking contacts, and the quality of the tracking measurements. GONS provides a viable option for using autonomous navigation to reduce operational costs for upcoming spacecraft missions with moderate position accuracy requirements.\n\nRemote Sensing and Remote Control Activities in Europe and America: Part 2--Remote Sensing Ground Stations in Europe,\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1996-04-08\n\nDevelopment tasks and products of remote sensing ground stations in Europe are represented by the In-Sec Corporation and the Schlumberger Industries Corporation.

Ground water at the Station flows through a shallow system of layered aquifers and leaky confining units. The units of the shallow aquifer system are the Columbia aquifer, the Cornwallis Cave confining unit, the Cornwallis Cave aquifer, the Yorktown confining unit, and the Yorktown-Eastover aquifer. The Eastover-Calvert confining unit separates the shallow aquifer system from deeper confined aquifers beneath the Station. A three-dimensional, finite-difference, ground-water flow model was used to simulate steady-state ground-water flow of the shallow aquifer system in and around the Station. The model simulated ground-water flow from the peninsular drainage divide that runs across the Lackey Plain near the southern end of the Station north to King Creek and the York River and south to Skiffes Creek and the James River. The model was calibrated by minimizing the root mean square error between 4 7 measured and corresponding simulated water levels. The calibrated model was used to determine the ground-water budget and general directions of ground-water flow. A particle-tracking routine was used with the calibrated model to estimate groundwater flow paths, flow rates, and traveltimes from selected sites at the Station. Simulated ground-water flow velocities of the Station-area model were small beneath the interstream areas of the Lackey Plain and Croaker Flat, but increased outward toward the streams and rivers where the hydraulic gradients are larger. If contaminants from the land surface entered the water table at or near the interstream areas of the Station, where hydraulic gradients are smaller, they would migrate more slowly than if they entered closer to the streams or the shores of the rivers where gradients commonly are larger. The ground-water flow simulations indicate that some ground water leaks downward from\n\nCharacteristics of train noise in above-ground and underground stations with side and island platforms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShimokura, Ryota; Soeta, Yoshiharu\n\n2011-04-01\n\nRailway stations can be principally classified by their locations, i.e., above-ground or underground stations, and by their platform styles, i.e., side or island platforms. However, the effect of the architectural elements on the train noise in stations is not well understood. The aim of the present study is to determine the different acoustical characteristics of the train noise for each station style. The train noise was evaluated by (1) the A-weighted equivalent continuous sound pressure level ( LAeq), (2) the amplitude of the maximum peak of the interaural cross-correlation function (IACC), (3) the delay time ( Ï1) and amplitude ( Ï1) of the first maximum peak of the autocorrelation function. The IACC, Ï1 and Ï1 are related to the subjective diffuseness, pitch and pitch strength, respectively. Regarding the locations, the LAeq in the underground stations was 6.4 dB higher than that in the above-ground stations, and the pitch in the underground stations was higher and stronger. Regarding the platform styles, the LAeq on the side platforms was 3.3 dB higher than on the island platforms of the above-ground stations. For the underground stations, the LAeq on the island platforms was 3.3 dB higher than that on the side platforms when a train entered the station. The IACC on the island platforms of the above-ground stations was higher than that in the other stations.\n\nLANDSAT-4 to ground station interface description\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe LANDSAT 4 to ground station interface is described in detail.

Space Station Freedom (SSF) will be in operation for 30 years, and will depend on robots to carry out a significant part of the assembly, maintenance, and utilization workload. Current plans call for on-orbit robotics to be operated by on-board crew members. This approach implies that on-orbit robotics operations use up considerable crew time, and that these operations cannot be carried out when SSF is unmanned. GOT will allow robotic operations to be operated from the ground, with on-orbit crew interventions only when absolutely required. The paper reviews how GOT would be implemented, how GOT operations would be planned and supported, and reviews GOT issues, critical success factors, and benefits.\n\nGround operation of robotics on Space Station Freedom\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWojcik, Z.

Additionally, the data bank is generally available for use by ERTS and other investigators that have a scientific interest in data pertaining to the Chesapeake Bay area. Working with DCS has provided a means of evaluating the system as a data collection device possibly applicable to ongoing Earth Resources Program activities in the Chesapeake Bay area as well as providing useful data and services to other ERTS investigators. The two areas of technical support provided by Wallops, ground truth stations and repair for DCPs, are briefly discussed.\n\nInternational Space Station Sustaining Engineering: A Ground-Based Test Bed for Evaluating Integrated Environmental Control and Life Support System and Internal Thermal Control System Flight Performance\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRay, Charles D.; Perry, Jay L.; Callahan, David M.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nAs the International Space Station's (ISS) various habitable modules are placed in service on orbit, the need to provide for sustaining engineering becomes increasingly important to ensure the proper function of critical onboard systems. Chief among these are the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) and the Internal Thermal Control System (ITCS). Without either, life onboard the ISS would prove difficult or nearly impossible. For this reason, a ground-based ECLSS/ITCS hardware performance simulation capability has been developed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. The ECLSS/ITCS Sustaining Engineering Test Bed will be used to assist the ISS Program in resolving hardware anomalies and performing periodic performance assessments. The ISS flight configuration being simulated by the test bed is described as well as ongoing activities related to its preparation for supporting ISS Mission 5A. Growth options for the test facility are presented whereby the current facility may be upgraded to enhance its capability for supporting future station operation well beyond Mission 5A. Test bed capabilities for demonstrating technology improvements of ECLSS hardware are also described.\n\nThe Earth Based Ground Stations Element of the Lunar Program\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGal-Edd, Jonathan; Fatig, Curtis; Schier, James; Lee, Charles\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Lunar Architecture Team (LAT) is responsible for developing a concept for building and supporting a lunar outpost with several exploration capabilities such as rovers, colonization, and observatories. The lunar outpost is planned to be located at the Moon's South Pole. The LAT Communications and Navigation Team (C&N) is responsible for defining the network infrastructure to support the lunar outpost. The following elements are needed to support lunar outpost activities: A Lunar surface network based on industry standard wireless 802.xx protocols, relay satellites positioned 180 degrees apart to provide South Pole coverage for the half of the lunar 28-day orbit that is obscured from Earth view, earth-based ground stations deployed at geographical locations 120 degrees apart. This paper will focus on the Earth ground stations of the lunar architecture. Two types of ground station networks are discussed. One provides Direct to Earth (DTE) support to lunar users using Kaband 23/26Giga-Hertz (GHz) communication frequencies. The second supports the Lunar Relay Satellite (LRS) that will be using Ka-band 40/37GHz (Q-band). This paper will discuss strategies to provide a robust operational network in support of various lunar missions and trades of building new antennas at non-NASA facilities, to improve coverage and provide site diversification for handling rain attenuation.\n\nCollection, quality control and delivery of ground-based magnetic data during ESA's Swarm mission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMacmillan, Susan; Humphries, Thomas; Flower, Simon; Swan, Anthony\n\n2016-04-01\n\nGround-based magnetic data are used in a variety of ways when analysing satellite data. Selecting satellite data often involves the use of magnetic disturbance indices derived from ground-based stations and inverting satellite magnetic data for models of fields from various sources often requires ground-based data. Ground-based data can also be valuable independent data for validation purposes. We summarise data collection and quality control procedures in place at the British Geological Survey for global ground-based observatory and repeat station data. Whilst ongoing participation in the ICSU World Data System and INTERMAGNET facilitates this work, additional procedures have been specially developed for the Swarm mission. We describe these in detail.\n\nOptimal link budget to maximize data receiving from remote sensing satellite at different ground stations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGodse, Vinay V.; Rukmini, B.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nEarth observation satellite plays a significant role for global situation awareness. The earth observation satellite uses imaging payloads in RF and IR bands, which carry huge amount of data, needs to be transferred during visibility of satellite over the ground station. Location of ground station plays a very important role in communication with LEO satellites, as orbital speed of LEO satellite is much higher than earth rotation speed. It will be accessible for particular equatorial ground station for a very short duration. In this paper we want to maximize data receiving by optimizing link budget and receiving data at higher elevation links. Data receiving at multiple ground stations is preferred to counter less pass duration due to higher elevation links. Our approach is to calculate link budget for remote sensing satellite with a fixed power input and varying different minimum elevation angles to obtain maximum data. The minimum pass duration should be above 3 minutes for effective communication. We are proposing to start process of command handling as soon as satellite is visible to particular ground station with low elevation angle up to 5 degree and start receiving data at higher elevation angles to receive data with higher speed. Cartosat-2B LEO earth observation satellite is taken for the case study. Cartosat-2B will complete around 14 passes over equator in a day, out of which only 4-5 passes will be useful for near equator ground stations. Our aim is to receive data at higher elevation angles at higher speed and increase amount of data download, criteria being minimum pass duration of 3 minutes, which has been set for selecting minimum elevation angle.\n\n8.

Miyun satellite ground station firstly used SAN storage network system based-on Stornext sharing software in Chang'E-3 mission. System performance fully meets the application requirements of Miyun ground station data storage.The Stornext file system is a sharing file system with high performance, supports multiple servers to access the file system using different operating system at the same time, and supports access to data on a variety of topologies, such as SAN and LAN. Stornext focused on data protection and big data management. It is announced that Quantum province has sold more than 70,000 licenses of Stornext file system worldwide, and its customer base is growing, which marks its leading position in the big data management.The responsibilities of Miyun satellite ground station are the reception of Chang'E-3 satellite downlink data and management of local data storage. The station mainly completes exploration mission management, receiving and management of observation data, and provides a comprehensive, centralized monitoring and control functions on data receiving equipment. The ground station applied SAN storage network system based on Stornext shared software for receiving and managing data reliable.The computer system in Miyun ground station is composed by business running servers, application workstations and other storage equipments. So storage systems need a shared file system which supports heterogeneous multi-operating system. In practical applications, 10 nodes simultaneously write data to the file system through 16 channels, and the maximum data transfer rate of each channel is up to 15MB/s. Thus the network throughput of file system is not less than 240MB/s. At the same time, the maximum capacity of each data file is up to 810GB. The storage system planned requires that 10 nodes simultaneously write data to the file system through 16\n\nQuantifying the spatio-temporal pattern of the ground impact of space weather events using dynamical networks formed from the SuperMAG database of ground based magnetometer stations.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDods, Joe; Chapman, Sandra; Gjerloev, Jesper\n\n2016-04-01\n\nmagnetosphere.

The on-board and on-ground diagnostic capabilities of the EATCS are discussed. Time and safety critical features, as well as noncritical failures, and the detection coverage for each provided by existing capabilities are reviewed. The allocation of responsibility between on-board software and ground-based systems, to be shown during ground testing at the Johnson Space Center, is described. Failure isolation capabilities allocated to the ground include some functionality originally found on orbit but moved to the ground to reduce on-board resource requirements. Complex failures requiring the analysis of multiple external variables, such as environmental conditions, heat loads, or station attitude, are also allocated to ground personnel.\n\nHydrogeologic controls on ground-water discharge to the Washington METRO subway tunnel near the Medical Center station and Crossover, Montgomery County, Maryland\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGreene, Earl A.; Shapiro, Allen M.; LaMotte, Andrew E.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nExcessive water intrusion has been observed inside several of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority subway tunnels, with the worst leakage occurring along the Red Line tunnels and stations north of Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C. These tunnels were constructed in bedrock that contains permeable (water-bearing) joints and fractures. Excessive water leakage through the walls and water inside the underground facilities has damaged mechanical and electrical components in the tunnel, and has escalated the deterioration rate of the rail system. The U.S. Geological Survey and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority have worked cooperatively on a study from 200003 to describe and quantify the factors controlling ground-water flow into the Red Line subway tunnel near the Medical Center Station and Crossover in Montgomery County, Maryland. The Red Line near the Medical Center Station and Crossover passes through or beneath the gneissic Sykesville Formation and the biotite-hornblende tonalite member of the Georgetown Intrusive Suite, both of which contain numerous fractures. The mapped foliation and joints of the Sykesville Formation in the vicinity of the Medical Center Station and Crossover are generally orientated north-south. Fractures in the Sykesville Formation in outcrops appear to be poorly connected. In the biotite-hornblende tonalite member of the Georgetown Intrusive Suite, the general orientation of the mapped foliation and joints is east-west. In contrast to the fractures in the Sykesville Formation, the fractures in the Georgetown Intrusive Suite in outcrops appear to be more numerous and have a greater degree of connectivity. Fractures intersecting four bedrock wells near the Medical Center Station and Crossover that were drilled into the biotite-hornblende tonalite member of the Georgetown Intrusive Suite show an east-west orientation matching the foliation and joints shown on geologic maps.

In general, the results of this field test suggest that high-quality, high-resolution, continuous subsurface profiles can be producedmoreÂ Â» with GPR over most of McMurdo Station.Â«Â less\n\nAutomatic forest-fire measuring using ground stations and Unmanned Aerial Systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez-de Dios, JosÃ© Ramiro; Merino, Luis; Caballero, Fernando; Ollero, Anibal\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a novel system for automatic forest-fire measurement using cameras distributed at ground stations and mounted on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). It can obtain geometrical measurements of forest fires in real-time such as the location and shape of the fire front, flame height and rate of spread, among others. Measurement of forest fires is a challenging problem that is affected by numerous potential sources of error. The proposed system addresses them by exploiting the complementarities between infrared and visual cameras located at different ground locations together with others onboard Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The system applies image processing and geo-location techniques to obtain forest-fire measurements individually from each camera and then integrates the results from all the cameras using statistical data fusion techniques. The proposed system has been extensively tested and validated in close-to-operational conditions in field fire experiments with controlled safety conditions carried out in Portugal and Spain from 2001 to 2006.\n\nAutomatic Forest-Fire Measuring Using Ground Stations and Unmanned Aerial Systems\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMartÃ­nez-de Dios, JosÃ© Ramiro; Merino, Luis; Caballero, Fernando; Ollero, Anibal\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a novel system for automatic forest-fire measurement using cameras distributed at ground stations and mounted on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).

C.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nMapping the earth from space stations can be approached in two areas. One is to collect gravity data for defining a new topographic datum using the earth's gravitational field in terms of spherical harmonics. The other, which should be considered as a very significant contribution of the Space Station, is to search and explore techniques of mapping the earth's topography using either optical or radar images with or without references to ground control points. Geodetic position of ground control points can be predetermined by the Global Positioning System (GPS) for the mapping experiment with the Space Station. It is proposed to establish four ground control points in North America or Africa (including the Sahara Desert). If this experiment should be successfully accomplished, it may also be applied to the defense charting service.\n\nThree years coherent space to ground links: performance results and outlook for the optical ground station equipped with adaptive optics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGregory, M.; Troendle, D.; Muehlnikel, G.; Heine, F.; Meyer, R.; Lutzer, M.; Czichy, R.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nTesat is performing inter-satellite links (ISLs) for over 5 years now. Besides the successful demonstration of the suitability of coherent laser communication for high speed data transmission in space, Tesat has also conducted two major satellite to ground link (SGL) campaigns during the last 3 years. A transportable ground station has been developed to measure the impact of atmospheric turbulence to the coherent system. The SGLs have been performed between the Tesat optical ground station and the two LEO satellites TerraSAR-X and NFIRE, both equipped with a Tesat LCT. The capability of the LCTs of measuring the signal intensity on a direct detection sensor and on a coherent sensor simultaneously makes the system unique for investigating the atmospheric distortion impacts. In this paper the main results of the SGL campaigns are presented, including BER performance for the uplink and downlink. Measured scintillation profiles versus elevation angles at different weather conditions are illustrated. Finally preliminary results of an adaptive optics system are presented that has been developed to be used in the transportable adaptive optical ground station (T-AOGS) acting as the counter terminal for the LCT mounted on Alphasat, a geostationary satellite of the European Space Agency (ESA), in autumn 2013.\n\n47 CFR 90.249 - Control stations.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-10-01\n\n... 47 Telecommunication 5 2011-10-01 2011-10-01 false Control stations. 90.249 Section 90.249...

This system was created in response for a need to centralize remote monitor and control of SDO Ground Station equipments using ASIST control environment in SDO MOC, and to have configurable table definition for equipment. It provides translation of status and monitoring information from the native systems into ASIST-readable format to display on pages in the MOC. The manager is lightweight, user friendly, and efficient. It allows data trending, correlation, and storing. It allows using ASIST as common interface for remote monitor and control of heterogeneous equipments. It also provides failover capability to back up machines.\n\nMapping experiment with space station\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWu, S. S. C.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nMapping of the Earth from space stations can be approached in two areas. One is to collect gravity data for defining topographic datum using Earth's gravity field in terms of spherical harmonics. The other is to search and explore techniques of mapping topography using either optical or radar images with or without reference to ground central points. Without ground control points, an integrated camera system can be designed. With ground control points, the position of the space station (camera station) can be precisely determined at any instant. Therefore, terrestrial topography can be precisely mapped either by conventional photogrammetric methods or by current digital technology of image correlation. For the mapping experiment, it is proposed to establish four ground points either in North America or Africa (including the Sahara desert). If this experiment should be successfully accomplished, it may also be applied to the defense charting systems.\n\nPerformance Predictions for the Adaptive Optics System at LCRD's Ground Station 1\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRoberts, Lewis C., Jr.; Burruss, Rick; Roberts, Jennifer E.; Piazzolla, Sabino; Dew, Sharon; Truong, Tuan; Fregoso, Santos; Page, Norm\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNASA's LCRD mission will lay the foundation for future laser communication systems.

The proposed control law was developed based on the direct adaptive control or model reference adaptive control scheme. Performance comparisons, subject to inertia variation, of the adaptive controller and the fixed-gain linear quadratic regulator currently implemented for the Space Station are conducted. Both the fixed-gain and the adaptive gain controllers are able to maintain the Station stability for inertia variations of up to 35 percent. However, when a 50 percent inertia variation is applied to the Station, only the adaptive controller is able to maintain the Station attitude.\n\nGround operation of the mobile servicing system on Space Station Freedom\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWojcik, Z. A.\n\n1992-11-01\n\nSpace Station Freedom (SSF) will be assembled in the 1995 to 2000 time period, when permanently manned capability (PMC) will be achieved. During the build phase and after PMC, the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) will be used as a tool to assist crew in the building and in assembly and all maintenance aspects of SSF. Operation of the MSS will be executed and controlled by on-orbit crew, thereby having an impact on the limited crew time and resources. The current plan specifies that the MSS will not be operable when crew are not present. Simulations have been carried out to quantify the maintenance workload expected over the life of SSF. These simulations predict a peak in maintenance demand occurring even before PMC is achieved. The MSS is key to executing those maintenance tasks, and as a result, the demands on MSS crew resource will likely exceed availability, thereby creating a backlog of maintenance actions and negatively impacting SSF effectiveness. Ground operated telerobotics (GOT), the operation of the MSS from the ground, is being proposed as an approach to reducing the anticipated maintenance backlog, along with reducing crew workload when the MSS is executing simple or repetitive tasks. GOT would be implemented in a phased approach, both in terms of the type of activity carried out and the point of control gradually passing from on-orbit crew to ground personnel. The benefits of GOT are expressed in terms of reduced on-orbit crew workload, greater availability of the MSS during the post-PMC period, and the ability to significantly reduce or even eliminate any maintenance action backlog. The benefits section compares GOT with crew operation timelines, and identifies other benefits of GOT. Critical factors such as safety, space-ground communication latency, simulation, operations planning, and design considerations are reviewed.\n\nTOMS total ozone data compared with northern latitude Dobson ground stations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHeese, B.; Barthel, K.; Hov, O.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOzone measurements from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer on the Nimbus 7 satellite are compared with ground-based measurements from five Dobson stations at northern latitudes to evaluate the accuracy of the TOMS data, particularly in regions north of 50 deg N. The measurements from the individual stations show mean differences from -2.5 percent up to plus 8.3 percent relative to TOMS measurements and two of the ground stations, Oslo and Longyearbyen, show a significant drift of plus 1.2 percent and plus 3.7 percent per year, respectively. It can be shown from nearly simultaneous measurements in two different wavelength double pairs at Oslo that at least 2 percent of the differences result from the use of the CC' wavelength double pair instead of the standard AD wavelength double pair. Since all Norwegian stations used the CC' wavelength double pair exclusively a similar error can be assumed for Tromso and Longyearbyren. A comparison between the tropospheric ozone content in TOMS data and from ECC ozonesonde measurements at Ny-Alesund and Bear Island shows that the amount of tropospheric ozone in the standard profiles used in the TOMS algorithm is too low, which leads to an error of about 2 percent in total ozone. Particularly at high solar zenith angles (greater than 80 deg), Dobson measurements become unreliable. They are up to 20 percent lower than TOMS measurements averaged over solar zenith angles of 88 deg to 89 deg.\n\nWork/control stations in Space Station weightlessness\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWillits, Charles\n\n1990-01-01\n\nAn ergonomic integration of controls, displays, and associated interfaces with an operator, whose body geometry and dynamics may be altered by the state of weightlessness, is noted to rank in importance with the optimal positioning of controls relative to the layout and architecture of 'body-ported' work/control stations applicable to the NASA Space Station Freedom. A long-term solution to this complex design problem is envisioned to encompass the following features: multiple imaging, virtual optics, screen displays controlled by a keyboard ergonomically designed for weightlessness, cursor control, a CCTV camera, and a hand-controller featuring 'no-grip' vernier/tactile positioning. This controller frees all fingers for multiple-switch actuations, while retaining index/register determination with the hand controller. A single architectural point attachment/restraint may be used which requires no residual muscle tension in either brief or prolonged operation.\n\nGround-based simulation of telepresence for materials science experiments.

The approach used is to simulate transmission between earth and space station with transmission between laboratories on earth. The experiments include isothermal dendrite growth, physical vapor transport, and glass melting. Modifications of existing apparatus, software developed, and the establishment of an inhouse network are reviewed.\n\nStress Drop and Depth Controls on Ground Motion From Induced Earthquakes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaltay, A.; Rubinstein, J. L.; Terra, F. M.; Hanks, T. C.; Herrmann, R. B.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nInduced earthquakes in the central United States pose a risk to local populations, but there is not yet agreement on how to portray their hazard. A large source of uncertainty in the hazard arises from ground motion prediction, which depends on the magnitude and distance of the causative earthquake. However, ground motion models for induced earthquakes may be very different than models previously developed for either the eastern or western United States. A key question is whether ground motions from induced earthquakes are similar to those from natural earthquakes, yet there is little history of natural events in the same region with which to compare the induced ground motions. To address these problems, we explore how earthquake source properties, such as stress drop or depth, affect the recorded ground motion of induced earthquakes. Typically, due to stress drop increasing with depth, ground motion prediction equations model shallower events to have smaller ground motions, when considering the same absolute hypocentral distance to the station. Induced earthquakes tend to occur at shallower depths, with respect to natural eastern US earthquakes, and may also exhibit lower stress drops, which begs the question of how these two parameters interact to control ground motion. Can the ground motions of induced earthquakes simply be understood by scaling our known source-ground motion relations to account for the shallow depth or potentially smaller stress drops of these induced earthquakes, or is there an inherently different mechanism in play for these induced earthquakes? We study peak ground-motion velocity (PGV) and acceleration (PGA) from induced earthquakes in Oklahoma and Kansas, recorded by USGS networks at source-station distances of less than 20 km, in order to model the source effects. We compare these records to those in both the NGA-West2 database (primarily from California) as well as NGA-East, which covers the central and eastern United States and Canada\n\nAutomation study for space station subsystems and mission ground support\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1985-01-01\n\nAn automation concept for the autonomous operation of space station subsystems, i.e., electric power, thermal control, and communications and tracking are discussed. To assure that functions essential for autonomous operations are not neglected, an operations function (systems monitoring and control) is included in the discussion. It is recommended that automated speech recognition and synthesis be considered a basic mode of man/machine interaction for space station command and control, and that the data management system (DMS) and other systems on the space station be designed to accommodate fully automated fault detection, isolation, and recovery within the system monitoring function of the DMS.\n\n46 CFR 154.320 - Cargo control stations.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-10-01\n\n...

A master ground station is being built at the Naval Postgraduate School. This computer system performs satellite commands, displays telemetry, trouble-shoots problems, and passes messages. The system also controls an open loop tracking antenna. This paper concentrates on the telemetry display, decoding, and interpretation through artificial intelligence (AI). The telemetry is displayed in an easily interpretable format, so that any user can understand the current health of the satellite and be cued as to any problems and possible solutions. Only the master ground station has the ability to receive all telemetry and send commands to the spacecraft; civilian ham users do not have access to this information. The telemetry data is decommutated and analyzed before it is displayed to the user, so that the raw data will not have to be interpreted by ground users. The analysis will use CLIPS imbedded in the code, and derive its inputs from telemetry decommutation. The program is an expert system using a forward chaining set of rules based on the expected operation and parameters of the satellite. By building the rules during the construction and design of the satellite, the telemetry can be well understood and interpreted after the satellite is launched and the designers may no longer be available to provide input to the problem.\n\nSemi-autonomous unmanned ground vehicle control system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnderson, Jonathan; Lee, Dah-Jye; Schoenberger, Robert; Wei, Zhaoyi; Archibald, James\n\n2006-05-01\n\nUnmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) have advantages over people in a number of different applications, ranging from sentry duty, scouting hazardous areas, convoying goods and supplies over long distances, and exploring caves and tunnels. Despite recent advances in electronics, vision, artificial intelligence, and control technologies, fully autonomous UGVs are still far from being a reality. Currently, most UGVs are fielded using tele-operation with a human in the control loop. Using tele-operations, a user controls the UGV from the relative safety and comfort of a control station and sends commands to the UGV remotely. It is difficult for the user to issue higher level commands such as patrol this corridor or move to this position while avoiding obstacles. As computer vision algorithms are implemented in hardware, the UGV can easily become partially autonomous. As Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) become larger and more powerful, vision algorithms can run at frame rate. With the rapid development of CMOS imagers for consumer electronics, frame rate can reach as high as 200 frames per second with a small size of the region of interest. This increase in the speed of vision algorithm processing allows the UGVs to become more autonomous, as they are able to recognize and avoid obstacles in their path, track targets, or move to a recognized area. The user is able to focus on giving broad supervisory commands and goals to the UGVs, allowing the user to control multiple UGVs at once while still maintaining the convenience of working from a central base station. In this paper, we will describe a novel control system for the control of semi-autonomous UGVs. This control system combines a user interface similar to a simple tele-operation station along with a control package, including the FPGA and multiple cameras. The control package interfaces with the UGV and provides the necessary control to guide the UGV.\n\nNarrow Angle Diversity using ACTS Ka-band Signal with Two USAT Ground Stations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKalu, A.; Emrich, C.; Ventre, J.; Wilson, W.; Acosta, R.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nTwo ultra small aperture terminal (USAT) ground stations, separated by 1.2 km in a narrow angle diversity configuration, received a continuous Ka-band tone sent from Cleveland Link Evaluation Terminal (LET). The signal was transmitted to the USAT ground stations via NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) steerable beam. Received signal power at the two sites was measured and analyzed. A dedicated datalogger at each site recorded time-of-tip data from tipping bucket rain gauges, providing rain amount and instantaneous rain rate. WSR-88D data was also obtained for the collection period. Eleven events with ground-to-satellite slant-path precipitation and resultant signal attenuation were observed during the data collection period. Fade magnitude and duration were compared at the two sites and diversity gain was calculated. These results exceeded standard diversity gain model predictions by several decibels. Rain statistics from tipping bucket data and from radar data were also compared to signal attenuation. The nature of Florida's subtropical rainfall, specifically its impact on signal attenuation at the sites, was addressed.\n\nHydrogeologic Setting, Ground-Water Flow, and Ground-Water Quality at the Langtree Peninsula Research Station, Iredell County, North Carolina, 2000-2005\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPippin, Charles G.; Chapman, Melinda J.; Huffman, Brad A.; Heller, Matthew J.; Schelgel, Melissa E.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA 6-year intensive field study (2000-2005) of a complex, regolith-fractured bedrock ground-water system was conducted at the Langtree Peninsula research station on the Davidson College Lake Campus in Iredell County, North Carolina. This research station was constructed as part of the Piedmont and Mountains Resource Evaluation Program, a cooperative study being conducted by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the U.S. Geological Survey. Results of the study characterize the distinction and interaction of a two-component ground-water system in a quartz diorite rock type. The Langtree Peninsula research station includes 17 monitoring wells and 12 piezometers, including 2 well transects along high to low topographic settings, drilled into separate parts of the ground-water-flow system. The location of the research station is representative of a metaigneous intermediate (composition) regional hydrogeologic unit. The primary rock type is mafic quartz diorite that has steeply dipping foliation. Primary and secondary foliations are present in the quartz diorite at the site, and both have an average strike of about N. 12 degree E. and dip about 60 degree in opposite directions to the southeast (primary) and the northwest (secondary). This rock is cut by granitic dikes (intrusions) ranging in thickness from 2 to 50 feet and having an average strike of N. 20 degree W. and an average dip of 66 degree to the southwest. Depth to consolidated bedrock is considered moderate to deep, ranging from about 24 to 76 feet below land surface. The transition zone was delineated and described in each corehole near the well clusters but had a highly variable thickness ranging from about 1 to 20 feet. Thickness of the regolith (23 to 68 feet) and the transition zone do not appear to be related to topographic setting. Delineated bedrock fractures are dominantly low angle (possibly stress relief), which were observed to be open to partially open at depths of\n\n47 CFR 95.139 - Adding a small base station or a small control station.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 47 Telecommunication 5 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Adding a small base station or a small control... base station or a small control station.
