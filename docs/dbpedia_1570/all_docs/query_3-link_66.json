        "text": "SYMVIONICS is devoted to the training system and simulation industry, having provided training system solutions for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, and NASA for decades. SYMVIONICS was a Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWCTSD) Training Systems Contract III (TSC III) prime contractor, in both lots (Small Business and Unrestricted categories). Prior to TSC III, as one of the 13 NAWCTSD Training Systems Contract II (TSC II) Prime Contractors, SYMVIONICS had eight delivery orders under the TSC II program. Six of these delivery orders were performed as a prime contractor and two as a subcontractor. SYMVIONICS has continued this tradition of support to Navy training systems under the TSC IV contract. Similarly, SYMVIONICS is a U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Omnibus Contract (STOC) II prime contractor, in both lots (Small Business and Unrestricted categories). SYMVIONICS has also been the modeling and simulation support contractor for the U.S. Air Force Test Center (AFTC) since 1995, where we have developed many new simulators. Since 2005, SYMVIONICS has also provided on-site support to the NASA Ames Research SimLab facilities.\n\nSYMVIONICS provides a total system design, development, production and support capability for training systems. We maintain a high-bay system integration facility in Orange Park (Jacksonville), FL. We are also experienced in the integration and stimulation of actual aircraft avionics computers and their companion Operational Flight Programs. We provide “on-site” support to some of our customers, providing day-to-day support for training system and simulator upgrades, modifications, and technology enhancements.\n\nWe have extensive experience with many types of training systems, including:\n\nAircraft (fixed wing and rotorcraft) flight/mission simulators\n\nAir Traffic Control (ATC) simulators\n\nMaintenance trainer simulators\n\nSubmarine simulators\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems\n\nAircraft weapon systems simulated include: F-35, F-22, F-16C, F/A-18, A-10, C-17, B-2, B-1, P-3C, T-45C (front seat and back seat), AH/UH-1, MH-60R, CH-47.\n\nATC systems simulated include: Control Towers, Navy Carrier ATC Center (CATCC), Navy Amphibious ATC Center (AATCC), Navy Landing Signal Officer, radar systems, and FAA/NASA Center/TRACON Automation System (CTAS).\n\nSubmarine weapon systems simulated include: Los Angeles, Los Angeles Improved, Virginia, and Ohio SSN Classes.\n\nUnmanned systems include the Navy Unmanned Combat Aerial System (N-UCAS).\n\nOur experience ranges from simpler part-task trainers to complete weapon system simulators, as well as classroom support. SYMVIONICS maintains a “Full Scope” engineering capability, including:\n\nSystem engineering\n\nHardware engineering & design\n\n3-D Computer Aided Design (CAD) & drafting\n\nElectrical engineering & design\n\nPrinted circuit board design\n\nSimulation math modeling\n\nSoftware engineering & development\n\nInformation Assurance\n\nHuman factors and system safety\n\nProduction\n\nProvisioning and sparing\n\nReliability & Maintainability (R&M) analysis\n\nConfiguration/data management\n\nQuality assurance\n\nTechnical publications\n\nContractor Logistics Service (CLS)\n\nSYMVIONICS also has an extensive expertise base in all simulator subsystems"
