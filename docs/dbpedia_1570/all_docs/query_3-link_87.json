        "text": "In the modeling and simulation industry, there is a constant call to increase the level of realism in the synthetic environment and the immersion perceived by its human inhabitants (the trainees). This call is perhaps loudest from those who use game-based training for military applications. Often, the funding of advances in gaming technology is at odds with decreasing training budgets. That's why ASTi developed Construct.\n\nConstruct is a product that breathes life into synthetic environments by automating game avatars and simulation entities to create intelligent, voice-enabled entities that understand human speech, and behave and respond like the human counterparts they're intended to represent. ASTi achieves this elevated degree of realism through context-aware and highly accurate speech recognition technology alongside high-quality, tunable synthetic voices and a generous portion of artificial intelligence.\n\nASTi's speech recognition software is refined to deal with human English speakers with a variety of accents and tuned for optimal performance in specific parlances, like Air Traffic Control, Call for Fire, and Close Air Support, to name a few.\n\nWhen Construct is added to a simulated environment, context-specific radio chatter fills the airwaves as the newly-intelligent agents come to life. These synthetic entities respond to each other, as well as the trainees, with voices that can be tuned to represent males or females with a variety of accents, and also have adjustable pitch and cadence.\n\nIncreased realism is, however, only one of the many benefits that Construct offers. By animating avatars and automating tasks, Construct relieves expert staff from performing non-critical role playing and reduces the human manpower required for realistic and effective training. Fewer people to coordinate means lower overall training costs and more flexibility in scheduling training events.\n\nWhile more realistic and effective training games benefit the trainees, Construct's underlying technology also offers a number of benefits for the commands responsible for coordinating and executing these training programs:"
