The term “cloud”…\n\nBusiness Benefits of Simio’s Risk-based Planning and Scheduling (RPS)\n\nBy C. Dennis Pegden, PhD\n\nAlthough there are many Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) products on the market, the solutions offered by Simio have a number of unique and compelling advantages.\n\nSimulation Versus Optimization Based Scheduling\n\nBy C. Dennis Pegden, PhD\n\nScheduling problems are typically large and complex and they are classified mathematically in a group of problems referred to as NP-Hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard). In non-mathematical terms these are the…\n\nHow Simio Objects Differ from Other Object-Oriented Modeling Tools\n\nBy C. Dennis Pegden, PhD\n\nSimio makes modeling dramatically easier and faster by providing a new object-based paradigm that radically changes the way objects are built and used. The purpose of this paper is to…\n\nIntelligent Objects: The Future of Simulation\n\nBy C. Dennis Pegden, PhD\n\nAbstract This paper describes a new modeling system — Simio that is designed to simplify model building by promoting a modeling paradigm shift from the process orientation to an object…\n\nTips for Successful Practice of Simulation\n\nBy Simio\n\nProceedings of the 2009 Winter Simulation Conference M. D. Rossetti, R. R. Hill, B. Johansson, A. Dunkin and R. G. Ingalls, eds. David T. Sturrock Simio LLC 504 Beaver St…"
