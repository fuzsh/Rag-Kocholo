        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nIn the last decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained a lot of attention from researchers due to their huge benefits. The concept of unmanned aerial vehicles reflects the fact that it is a plane without a pilot on board, meaning that all the interaction with and control of this vehicle takes place remotely; in addition, the term has recently been changed to become Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to reflect the complexity of the interactions between the UAV, the Ground Control Station (GCS), and the telecommunication system in operating a UAV. The field of UAVs covers many aspects, including military and civilian applications, where military applications can be used in reconnaissance, attack roles, rescue missions, and training of military troops, while civilian applications can be used in industrial support [1], fire extinguishing [2], logistics delivery, and autonomous transport.\n\nDifferent high-level technologies are used throughout UAV missions, starting from communication, networking, controlling, and aerodynamics; all these technologies are combined to form a unique platform capable of meeting the mission’s specific requirements. In addition, each UAV can be equipped with a special payload that depends upon several factors, such as the real payload availability for the UAV (how much it can carry), and the mission’s requirements, such as thermal cameras, HD cameras, special sensors, etc. In addition, each mission depends upon the UAV’s endurance, range, altitude, speed, and payload.\n\nIn addition, the benefits of using UAVs in different missions has led researchers to investigate how to overcome the missions’ problems by dealing with different techniques such as the swarming technique [3], where the word SWARM comes from nature, such as how bees fly and attack in swarms. Thus, through swarm missions, the type of mission and the payload can be split between the UAVs, so that what was once achieved over multiple missions can now be performed in a single mission using the swarming technique.\n\nThrough this research, a new swarming technique algorithm will be discussed in detail, showing the advantages of using such algorithms. The swarming technique will be simplified into four main layers: the communication layer, the networking layer, the decision-making layer, and finally, the path-planning layer.\n\nFurthermore, through the communication layer and the network layer, UAV swarms are concurrently controlled by the ground control station (GCS). Complex software is run through the GCS, and it is equipped with a communication system (transceiver) that propagates the telemetry data (sending and receiving) through all connected UAVs to the GCS, achieving system requirements. Moreover, the telemetry data include several parameters such as ground speed, GPS information, gyroscopes, and payload data coming from cameras and sensors (accelerometers). Commonly, the communication system uses unlicensed radio frequency bands such as 433 Mhz/1 W(+30 dBi)/−116 dBm or 866–950 Mhz/1000 mW(+30 dBm)/−116 dBm for sending and receiving data.\n\nIn addition, adding an onboard computer to the UAVs, such as a Jetson Xavier [4], will provide the system with a higher level of autonomy, allowing the system to act as a decision-making system so that each UAV will act as a PC by itself.\n\nIn [4], the authors stated that a swarm communication architecture could be classified into two main architectures: an ad hoc network-based architecture and an infrastructure-based swarm architecture, as shown in and .\n\nThe ad hoc networks can be classified into four main categories: mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), vehicle ad hoc networks (VANET), flying ad hoc networks (FANET), and underwater ad hoc networks (UWVANET), as stated in [3]. Correspondingly, UAVs are a sub-category in the ad hoc networks, as they are a category within FANETs with the following characteristics: the node mobility is very high; the mobility model is regular for predetermined paths but special mobility models exist for autonomous multi-UAV systems; the node density is very low; the topology change is fast; the radio propagation model is high above the ground, where the Line of Sight (LOS) is available for most cases; the computational power is high; and finally, the localization is achieved through GPS, AGPS, DGPS, or IMU.\n\nAdditionally, an integral part of any swarm application is the control strategy to maintain the stability of each UAV and the system as a whole for a homogeneous flight. To this end, the authors of [5] presented a robust controller for a tracking mission lying on a decentralized multi-agent platform; they chose two potential functions, one quadratic and another with attraction and repulsion parts, to be compared when exposed to the controller. Their results affirm that the sliding mode controller behaves fantastically, independent of the potential functions and the tracking term aims for the controller to follow the target. In [6], the authors performed a numerical study of robust algorithms for a time-varying swarm with nonlinear external errors. To solve the instabilities, they first expanded the observation matrix for a consensus problem, and the “n” employing a robust compensator and a nominal controller, the system converged to stability with small errors; however, their solution does not support a dynamic switch formation, and no practical work was performed. In [7], however, a robust controller was designed to regulate the behavior of two swarm groups under conflict, formulated as persuaders following evaders: first, one individual of each group follows another individual, and second, the whole group follows another group.\n\nMeanwhile, the drag force triggered by the evaders and their turning effects is considered an uncertainty. Their study reveals that the robust method hastens system convergence, which is advanced by increasing the controller gain parameter; however, the chattering phenomenon is observed in the turning modes. Considering previous studies, the current paper presents a novel robust algorithm that reduces chattering by providing a smooth effect on inconsistent controller outputs.\n\nMoreover, for the decision-making layer, multiple types of research in the state-of-art deal with the task-assignment problem [8,9] and mission planning [10,11] through UAV swarm systems. In this context, multi-UAV coverage path planning (CPP) is a line of research whose objective is to find the optimal route to cover a defined area and the optimal path allocation for each UAV [11]. This field has gained the attention of researchers due to its multiple remote sensing applications such as in precision agriculture [12,13], inspection [14,15], search and rescue [16,17], and others. In general terms, the research aims to find an optimal path given the set of points of a polygonal area. However, other applications could require covering multiple disjoint zones during the same operation. On the other hand, the approach presented in [18] proposes an asymptotically optimal coverage navigation algorithm for a multi-UAV system for non-polygonal regions; however, the authors do not deal with the problem of separated zones.\n\nFor this reason, researchers in [19] have introduced a new concept, the Traveling Salesman Problem Coverage Path Planning (TSP-CPP), whose goal is to optimize the routes and the order of visits to the target areas. Some strategies for single UAV systems have been presented in the literature [19], where the researchers use dynamic programming and a grid-based approach. In [20], the researchers apply a back-and-forth optimization strategy to find the routes and genetic algorithms (GA) to search the order of visits. In addition, for multi-UAV systems, the technique presented in [21] can be mentioned, which solves the problem using evolutionary methods; as an NP-hard problem, these strategies can consume a lot of computational resources depending on their dimensionality. This paper presents a complete algorithm for solving the TSP-CPP problem in multiple areas using fast-optimization techniques, representing a new planning system that is fast enough to execute in-flight replanning."
