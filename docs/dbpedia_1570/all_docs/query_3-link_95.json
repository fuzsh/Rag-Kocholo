        "text": "FORT WALTON BEACH, FL – January 2023 – Intuitive Research and Technology Corporation (INTUITIVE®) is excited to provide the 96th Test Wing and the Air Force Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation (SDPE) Office with new autonomous aircraft testing capabilities on the Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range (EGTTR).\n\nEglin’s new XQ-58 aircraft, operated in partnership with INTUITIVE, enhances testing capabilities that the 96th Test Wing offers to advanced technology programs such as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) and others that leverage autonomy and artificial intelligence.\n\nTeam INTUITIVE will provide critical equipment, engineering, operations, and support to EGTTR as autonomous aircraft are integrated into range operations. Additionally, Team INTUITIVE offers the ability to host various autonomy suites or software agents on the experimental aircraft. The software developers may be Government Program Offices or product companies/vendors who the Government would like to evaluate for potential integration.\n\nEglin Area Program Manager, Lane Odom, said, “We are grateful for the leadership that the 96th Test Wing and the SDPE Office have shown to advance the capabilities and trust in autonomous systems. This new autonomous aircraft test capability offers program offices data-driven test technology to effectively validate system performance in an operationally relevant environment.”\n\nThe future of air warfare will most certainly involve machine autonomy. INTUITIVE is at the cutting edge of development and experimentation activities to incorporate greater autonomy into Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). INTUITIVE’s capabilities include integration of flight safety mechanisms and open-air testing approaches to gain confidence and increase trust in these systems. With experience in providing large scale autonomous flying test beds, delivering new data distribution and analysis infrastructure, providing modeling and simulation support, and supporting test logistics and safety for autonomous UAS projects—it is INTUITIVE’s mission to provide military capability through machine autonomy in an ethical and safe way that benefits our national defense objectives.\n\nABOUT INTUITIVE RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION:"
