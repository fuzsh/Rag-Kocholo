        "text": "2\n\nBackground\n\nSafety has been ingrained in the aviation culture from its earliest days. Aviation is often held up as the model for how to improve safety in other domains, from health care to the automotive industry.1\n\nIn the context of aviation, safety is defined as a state where the possibility of harm to people or property is reduced to and maintained at or below an acceptable level of risk. Because of actions by regulators, manufacturers, and operators, the aviation system provides a transportation capability that has the lowest safety risk of any mode of motorized transportation. While accidents involving large commercial aircraft do occasionally happen, the rate of occurrence is so low that safety experts no longer focus on corrective actions associated with accidents or incidents but are now focused on proactive safety initiatives based on analysis of precursors of potential accidents.\n\nSince its inception, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been charged as the federal agency responsible for regulating civil aviation to ensure safety. The FAA promotes safety by issuing and enforcing regulations and minimum standards covering manufacturing, operating, and maintaining aircraft.2 For the most part, the FAA focuses on ensuring the safety of the occupants of aircraft (i.e., crew and passengers) in the belief that if first-party participants are safe, third-party participants (e.g., the public on the ground) will also be safe. As a means of ensuring that aviation operations are within acceptable levels of risk, the FAA, as the regulator, generally requires the following three elements:\n\nA certified aircraft,\n\nA licensed pilot, and\n\nOperational approval to access specific airspace.\n\nFor remotely piloted aircraft that would operate in the National Airspace System, the requirements are the same. It is important to note that unmanned aircraft including model aircraft flown for recreational purposes are considered “aircraft” under federal regulation.\n\n___________________\n\nToday, there are effectively five ways in which an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) can legally operate in the National Airspace System:\n\nModel aircraft. Under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 101.41, an aircraft that is “flown strictly for hobby or recreational use” can operate in the National Airspace System if it follows “safety guidelines” and other processes under the auspices of a “community-based organization” (e.g., the Academy of Model Aeronautics). The operations should not interfere with and should give way to manned aircraft, in addition to some other operational limits. Certified aircraft and licensed pilots are not required. No operational approval is needed to operate a model aircraft, but notification of air traffic control (ATC) may be required.\n\nSmall UAS rule compliant. In 2016, the FAA made 14 CFR Part 107 final, which enabled UAS to be operated without the need for an airworthiness certificate for hobby, recreational, commercial, public safety, or any other purpose in the National Airspace System. Part 107 lays out requirements for the licensing of UAS pilots as well as operational limitations (e.g., operating below 400 feet above ground level) and airspace (e.g., class G [uncontrolled] airspace) where operations are permitted (see Figure 2.1). Aircraft operating under Part 107 do not require an airworthiness certificate or operational approval if they follow all of the operating provisions outlined in the rule.\n\nSmall UAS rule waivers. 14 CFR §107.205 lists a number of provisions (i.e., operational limitations that the FAA can waive), including the following: prohibition of operation from a moving vehicle, daytime-only operations, requirement to remain in visual line of sight, and prohibition of operation over people and operation of multiple aircraft by one person. Aircraft operating under Part 107 Waiver do not require an airworthiness certificate but may need to follow additional operational provisions as defined in the waiver application.\n\nSmall UAS rule airspace authorization. 14 CFR §107.41 makes it clear that small UAS cannot be operated “in Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace [i.e., in the vicinity of airports] or within the lateral boundaries of the surface area of Class E [en route] airspace that has been designated for an airport unless that person has prior authorization from ATC.” For some operations, both a Part 107 Waiver and a Part 107 Airspace Authorization will be required. In some cases, the FAA could waive the need for airspace authorization by issuing an “Airspace Waiver” that is usually for longer duration (i.e., 6 months to 2 years). Applicants are encouraged to apply 90 days prior to flight. The FAA is working to streamline this approval process through the creation of facility maps3 and the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) prototype.4 The airspace authorization is operational approval to operate in the specified airspace.\n\nCertificate of Authorization (COA) or waiver. Operational approval is available for aircraft operating under 14 CFR Part 915 that have an airworthiness certificate6 and are operated by a licensed pilot. Since there are very few commercial unmanned aircraft with an airworthiness certificate (e.g., special airworthiness certificate—experimental category), the COA process is mainly used by public entities (e.g., the military services, NASA, public universities) that have the authority to designate their own aircraft as airworthy.\n\nFor proponents planning to operate in compliance with either the model aircraft rule or the small UAS rule, no additional scrutiny or review by the FAA is required, and they have operational approval as long as they remain within the operational limits expressed in 14 CFR Part 101 and 14 CFR Part 107. All other proponents must submit a request to the FAA for a waiver or authorization. The FAA has attempted to assist proponents by publishing\n\n___________________\n\nguidelines7 on what information is required and by providing electronic means to facilitate interactions, including the “DroneZone”8 and the LAANC. These electronic tools are intended to streamline requests for waivers that can be considered routine (e.g., authorization to operate in Class C airspace below the altitude defined in the published facility maps while remaining otherwise in compliance with the operational limitations in 14 CFR Part 107).\n\nThe DroneZone website also provides a means for reporting UAS accidents and incidents. These reports should be filed within 10 days of an event if a UAS causes a serious injury or damage in excess of $500. The number of incident reports has increased from about 25 monthly in 2014 to about 125 monthly in 2016. As of September 2017, however, there has only been one confirmed collision between a UAS and a manned aircraft in the United States.9 Research using data from incident reports is ongoing. Key goals include quantifying how unique hazards affect risk and methods for evaluating specific risks and how to mitigate them (FAA, 2017).\n\nFor new, novel, and more complex waiver requests, the evaluation process by the FAA can be significantly less predictable and not sufficiently responsive (i.e., it takes too long). FAA Order 8040.4 specifies a safety risk management (SRM) policy for the agency. As guidance to all FAA lines of business, it establishes common terms and processes used to analyze, assess, mitigate, and accept safety risk in the aerospace system. It is the intent of the order to allow flexibility in how safety risk management is conducted and the tools and techniques that are employed and at the same time help to establish some consistency in the application of key principles.\n\nAlthough there is consistency, the processes implemented by the lines of business are qualitative and highly dependent on the subjective perspective of subject matter experts who may be involved. While the policy establishes a clear analytic approach, it is fundamentally operating on qualitative/subjective data. The approach requires substantial details from proponents and significant effort by FAA personnel. Consequently, the process is not timely, it is not necessarily repeatable, and proponents cannot readily predict the outcome.\n\nThis committee was charged with considering safety risk management approaches that would include quantitative methods that may be performed by proponents and then reviewed by those responsible for regulatory oversight (i.e., the FAA). Quantitative approaches would use objective data to predict potential risk as measured in adverse outcome (e.g., fatalities) per some operational unit (e.g., flight hours, flights). This predicted quantitative risk can be calculated using a combination of empirical data, simulation studies, and systems analysis. The calculated safety risk can then be compared with a target level of safety, the safety risk of the operations it replaces, or other benefits.\n\n___________________\n\nRemote pilot—The person who manipulates the flight controls of a remotely piloted aircraft during flight time (ICAO Circular 328-AN/190).\n\nRemotely piloted—Control of an aircraft from a pilot station that is not on board the aircraft (ICAO Circular 328-AN/190).\n\nRemotely piloted aircraft—An aircraft where the flying pilot is not on board the aircraft (ICAO Circular 328-AN/190).\n\nSafety—The state in which the risk of harm to persons or property damage is acceptable (FAA Order 8040.4B).\n\nSafety risk—The composite of predicted severity and likelihood of the potential effect of a hazard (FAA Order 8040.4B).\n\nSafety risk acceptance—The decision by the appropriate management official to authorize the operation without additional safety risk mitigation (FAA Order 8040.4B).\n\nSafety risk analysis—The first three steps of the SRM process (analyze the system, identify hazards, and analyze safety risk) (FAA Order 8040.4B).\n\nSafety risk assessment—The first four steps of the SRM process (analyze the system, identify hazards, analyze safety risk, and assess safety risk) (FAA Order 8040.4B).\n\nSeverity—The consequence or impact of a hazard’s effect or outcome in terms of degree of loss or harm (FAA Order 8040.4B).\n\nUnmanned aircraft—An aircraft that is operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft (Public Law 112-95). For the purpose of this report, it is assumed that unmanned aircraft have no humans on board—neither crew nor passengers.\n\nUnmanned aircraft system—An unmanned aircraft and associated elements (including communication links and the components that control the unmanned aircraft) that are required for the pilot in command to operate safely and efficiently in the National Airspace System (Public Law 112-95).\n\nVisual line-of-sight operation—An operation in which the remote crew maintains direct visual contact with the aircraft to manage its flight and meet separation and collision avoidance responsibilities.\n\nThis report also refers to automation or automatic systems and autonomy or autonomous systems. It is difficult to provide concise definitions for these terms because there is not a definitive boundary between the two. Indeed, “the attempt to define autonomy has resulted in a waste of both time and money spent debating and reconciling different terms and may be contributing to fears of unbounded autonomy” (Defense Science Board, 2012). Furthermore, “automation changes the type of human involvement required and transforms but does not eliminate it. For any apparently autonomous system, we can always find the wrapper of human control that makes it useful and returns meaningful data” (Mindell, 2015).\n\nOne approach to understanding the difference between automation and autonomy is to consider the differences (and similarities) in their characteristics, as shown in Table 2.1. Automation and autonomy exist along a spectrum of capabilities and parameters, such as those listed in the table. As a result, referring to a system as either automated or autonomous is typically an oversimplification, although it is often convenient to do so. Generally speaking, both automated and autonomous systems have the ability to execute assigned tasks over some period of time without direct human direction. Consider, for example, the use of a UAS to survey a farmer’s field overnight. With an automated system, the farmer might need to program the flight path and the parameters to be monitored (e.g., soil moisture, insect infestation, or crop yield). With an autonomous system, the farmer might simply give a verbal command to survey the crops, and the UAS would identify the crops planted in the various fields, an optimum flight path, the parameters to monitor, and the range of acceptable values based on the crop, recent and forecast weather, where the crops are in their life cycle, past experience, and so on. In this example, the basic task is within the capability of both automated and autonomous systems. Many other missions, of course, include tasks that are beyond the capabilities of an automated system.\n\nWith the definitions and assumptions listed above in mind, the committee turned its attention to the subject of current practices, looking at the relatively recent (i.e., less than 20 years) efforts to introduce UAS into the National Airspace System. That is the subject of Chapter 3."
