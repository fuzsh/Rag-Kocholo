Of course i realise that’s just my personal take, but i’m now waiting to see what new info comes in the next few days, and depending on what i read i’ll be uninstalling 2020.\n\nI was really hoping for India, Africa, Middle-east, Asia world updates etc, but even if they did do them for 2020, i’ll still know i’m missing out on all sorts of cool weather effects among other things. The announcement has disappointed me so much, i don’t even feel like playing the game anymore right now.\n\nWho knows? Right now all I’ve seen is a vision of the future product. I’ve no idea what it will be actually like, what its features, performance demands, benefits costs etc will be.\n\nAm I excited by the announcement? Very - a true multiplayer and career experience native to a sim will be fantastic.\n\nWould I definitely get it? Again who knows - it depends on how well they do it.\n\nWill I continue to use and enjoy MSFS 2020 in the interim and beyond? Absolutely. I’ve never let envy get in the way of doing the things I enjoy. I stopped thinking that way around about the age of 11.\n\nWill I spend a lot of time agonizing in the interim about what MSFS 2024 means? Nope - I’ll wait and see when there is some real news. (but I think some 3rd party devs will have a lot of pressing questions)\n\nThat was the only way for you to get out of that silly situation you ‘painted’ yourself into with your Picasso analogy, and it took you a fair while to find it. The reality is, if you can afford it you’ll get it because it’s better, end of story. ‘tools and how you use them’ my ■■■.\n\nIt’s not about envy as you suggest, it’s about no longer being part of the main group, it’s a feeling of loss and exclusion, not desire. I’ll still be watching people’s MSFS 2024 videos on Youtube, and enjoying seeing them play, but don’t try and tell me an inferior game will be just as good as a superior one, or insinuate the cause of my disappointment is my own fault.\n\nSometimes this is what consumerism do to you. When you reached that 30something years old of age or more, you kind of stopped feeling like left out or FOMO. It is okay to not have watched every MCU movies, it is okay to not have the latest Toyota Camry (you are more open to buy used cars), you tend to care about other people less and appreciate what you care the most, a bit more. But I can understand your feeling - sometimes there are just things that makes you no longer care for something because you lost “it” - like how I stopped caring religiously for MCU movies after they killed Tony Stark - and hey, no biggie - I told no one until today.\n\nI skipped FSX for that reason, despite having bought the game 17 years ago. Stuck with my FS9 (2004), knowing that all of those manually compiled and collected AI traffic will not be reproduceable in 1 year time within FSX. People keep asking, where do you get that special A319 Air Berlin liveries? When I post a screenshot of my traffic collection. It is FS2004 in 2009, 3 years into FSX timeline.\n\nI’m still on the fence and cautiously optimistic about MSFS2024. There is a part of me that is pretty disappointed with the way the trailer is compiled (only showing gameplays) - so I’m still waiting for more information - whether MSFS2024 will be as serious as Jorg has been raving about the whole Asobo’s MSFS concept. There is also part of me that is optimistic, because after trying Reno Air Race DLC, I am pretty okay with the concept. The planes are still that medium-high fidelity real - not just pure eye candy like some payware planes. You can flash the landing lights or adjust the mixtures, prop pitch during the “race”. It is just lacking the sim depth - since you start mid air. It could be rewarding to do something meaningful with the complex vehicle. But as I said, I’m not expecting that much as of now.\n\nSo. to my annoyance and probably the only one, we will have 2024 coming out. when I purchased FS2020 i was taken in by the “10 year commitment”. Now, MS have said that they will continue as usual with MS2020, updates etc but I can’t help thinking that yes we will get updates but they get les and less. Having paid nearly $500 for the sim and addons this really does seem like a kick in the teeth.\n\nLets be honest here, MSFS2020 is far from perfect. We are still chasing bugs that were there from day one and features that were “promised” (working weathermap anyone?) I find it a hard pill to swallow if I have to pay another $130 for a simulator that will have similar problems as we are experiencing now.\n\nI am all for progress and the need to keep the simulator upto date but this announcement is way too soon."
