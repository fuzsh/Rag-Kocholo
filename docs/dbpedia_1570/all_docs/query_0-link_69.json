        "text": "“Approaches to this type of statistical analysis were developed nearly 10 years ago. These days, it’s easier to conduct research and present its results thanks to the development of data science and visualization capabilities. Considering that each case is unique, it’s very important to choose the right amount of data to extract insights from,\" concludes Konstantin.\n\nExpected marginal seat revenue (EMSR). This optimization model is calculated after WTP is defined. The metric can be perceived as the expected value of the current seat and entails allocating a seat to a specific fare class (FC). Data scientists measure EMSR by multiplying sales profit by the probability of selling an additional (marginal) seat belonging to the particular FC. “The moment comes when sales probability of a higher-fare ticket is so low that the expected revenue in a lower fare class will be bigger. So, knowing these probabilities you can determine the fare-class allocation for each day before departure,” adds Konstantin.\n\nIn a best-case scenario, specialists have to know the sell-up probabilities for different fare classes and days before departure to determine WTP and EMSR accurately, says this expert. The sell-up probability discloses whether a customer is likely to buy a higher-fare ticket if their request is denied. Clustering of flights according to destinations and flight dates is required. The revenue management team also carries out a clickstream analysis to know how many customers saw a web page showing a specific price. Airlines use historical sales data when determining willingness to pay and expected marginal seat revenue.\n\nAncillary price optimization. This is another approach designed to increase airline revenues through analytics-driven pricing. It allows data scientists to learn about a traveler's tendency to buy ancillaries like baggage. Specialists define in which markets and on what days people are likely to pay more to check their bags. “For example, if I book tickets for three people with a child, then I’m ready to pay X euros more than if I flew alone somewhere on a weekend,” explains Konstantin Vandyshev.\n\nRevenue management starts with analyzing demanded flight routes\n\n2. Air safety and airplane maintenance\n\nAirlines literally bear high costs due to delays and cancellations that includes expenses on maintenance and compensations to travelers stuck in airports. With nearly 30 percent of the total delay time caused by unplanned maintenance, predictive analytics applied to fleet technical support is a reasonable solution.\n\nCarriers deploy predictive maintenance solutions to better manage data from aircraft health monitoring sensors. Usually, these systems are compatible with both desktop and mobile devices, granting technicians access to real-time and historical data from any location. Knowing an aircraft’s current technical condition through alerts, notifications, and reports, employees can spot issues pointing at possible malfunction and replace parts proactively. Executives and team leads, in turn, can receive updates on maintenance operations, get data on tool and part inventory, and expenses via dashboards.\n\nWith applied predictive maintenance, an airline can reduce expenses connected with expedited transportation of parts, overtime compensation for crews, and unplanned maintenance. If a technical problem did occur, maintenance teams could react to it faster with workflow organization software.\n\nShane Ballman, former manager of Maintenance Systems & Technology at AirTran Airways and CEO of AI startup SynapseMX, Inc, came up with a platform that utilizes historical and real-time data to help maintenance crews make technical decisions faster.\n\n“We automate the routine and mundane using the company's workflows, elevating things to the right person at the right time when a human's touch is required,” says Shane.\n\nThe SynapseMX software analyzes data and metadata regarding detected maintenance activity. It helps engineers quickly evaluate a situation, for instance, to find out if this failure happened for the first time; if not, what can be done to fix it and how much time did it take before. Employees can also specify if there are spare parts available or a conflicting workload. “Then we evaluate for business rules — who cares, and under what conditions do they care? Should this trigger a new workflow? Update metrics? Send notifications?\n\nOur AI is able to provide recommendations, in real-time, from the technicians in the field to the logistics team that supports them. The end result is a maintenance organization that reacts intelligently to current conditions,” concludes Ballman.\n\nPredictive maintenance is great, but it doesn’t replace essential aircraft inspections. AI solutions can be of assistance here as well. For example, Donecle offers an automated drone and image analysis algorithms to detect defects on the aircraft, making inspections way faster and more efficient.\n\n3. Feedback analysis\n\nAir travel can be stressful even for frequent, experienced travelers whose passports are running out of clean pages. They have to do so many tasks like checking bags or finding a gate before getting themselves into a plane seat and taking a selfie!\n\nIn this regard, airlines that learn about pain points of airport and flight experience through data analysis can improve customer service. Using AI for feedback analysis and market research allows airlines to make informed decisions and meet customers’ expectations, agrees founder and CEO of PureStrategy Inc. Briana Brownell.\n\n“AI systems can quickly allow airlines to determine if there is an opportunity to positively intervene in the customer journey and turn a poor experience into a delightful one. It also allows companies to react faster in a synchronized, aligned way that is on-brand and consistent with the business’s values.”\n\nPureStrategy introduces a platform for business analytics called the Automated Neural Intelligence Engine (ANIE). The engine’s functionality includes data review, categorization, visualization, and sentiment analysis. So, the engine does a lot of manual and time-consuming work with information allowing humans to concentrate on more complex tasks.\n\n“We deal with customer feedback and voice of the customer data throughout all areas of the organization. Then, we link this data to internal operational metrics as well as external industry metrics,” specifies data scientist. Briana emphasizes the growing relevance of natural language understanding technology in processing and analysis of customer experience data as it allows for exploring the customer journey in their own words.\n\nANIE can be used to make sure whether it’s easy for customers to find, book, and pay for flights. “Ultimately we want to understand the ways in which an airline can delight a customer as well as where there is friction in the customer journey — and figure out how to fix it,” concludes Briana Brownell.\n\n4. Messaging automation\n\nWhen a disruption such as a flight delay or baggage loss occurs, travelers get nervous. And if customers don’t get a response or explanation of a problem from an airline representative in a timely manner, they likely won’t choose this airline for their next trip. The speed of response to customer queries matters as much as actual steps that are taken to solve an issue.\n\nAI software speeds up and simplifies customer service employees’ workflows by using algorithms for processing natural language or unstructured text. For example, such systems can classify emails and extract information from them.\n\nAnother way to automate and improve customer service is chatbot development. Today, many airlines enhance their customer support with AI-powered chatbots that help passengers with booking and managing flights, tracking baggage, answering questions, and providing other types of assistance.\n\n5. Crew management\n\nImagine a scheduling department that has to assign crews to each of thousands of flights operated every day. That’s a lot of work. Specialists consider a myriad of factors: flight route, crew member licensing and qualification, aircraft type and fuel usage, work regulations, vacations and days off to approve conflict-free schedules for pilots and flight attendants. Besides those are airplane maintenance schedules, training requirements like the pairing of senior crew members with junior ones, and government regulations that have to be taken into account.\n\n“Crew management is a complex task due to many legal constraints. For instance, if staff belong to a trade union, limitations include an allowed number of flight hours and days off, as well as reimbursement in case of a labor law violation,” сlarifies data scientist Konstantin Vandyshev.\n\nOf course, schedulers are not left to go it alone with big data generated by airlines (like, maintenance and passenger data, or data from onboard sensors.) Employees rely on software that integrates data from various sources, allowing them to get a full picture of daily operations. Using uncovered insights, they are able to make an optimal schedule in terms of working time, crew qualification, aircraft utilization, and expenses.\n\nIn other words, such software integrates predictive models with an airline operations management system.\n\nSome crew management solutions allow addressing fatigue risk that pilots are in danger of due to a constant change of time zones, long duty days, scheduling changes, and other “pleasures” of working in the airline industry. For example, developers of the Crew Rostering solution from Jeppesen started integrating bio-mathematical models of fatigue into flight crew scheduling software. Their goal is to provide schedulers with the ability to rely on data about predicted fatigue to reduce risks in the planning phase.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s all about safely transporting people from point A to point B.\n\n6. Fuel efficiency optimization\n\nGlobal aviation produces nearly 2 percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. That’s why aircraft manufacturers and carriers strive to improve their fuel efficiency. Well, it’s not only ecological but also financial concerns that drive airline industry players to use technology to reduce carbon emissions. According to Investopedia, airlines spend 10 to 12 percent of their operating costs on fuel.\n\nAirlines use AI systems with built-in machine learning algorithms to collect and analyze flight data regarding each route distance and altitudes, aircraft type and weight, weather, etc. Based on findings from data, systems estimate the optimal amount of fuel needed for a flight.\n\n7. In-flight sales and food supply\n\nEating a sandwich with a cup of coffee while enjoying the passing clouds and a bright blue sky is how many of us imagine an airplane journey.\n\nMeanwhile, supply management specialists define how many snacks and drinks they must onboard without being wasteful. AI is here to help, too.\n\n“If a low-cost airline sells food on board, it has to know how to predict the amount of food it has to buy for a specific flight,” says Konstantin. “While food isn’t expensive, every cargo load costs money. In addition, airlines usually throw away a lot of sandwiches at the end of the day. Companies that will be the first to solve this problem can make a good commercial use case out of it.”\n\n8. Fraud detection\n\nIATA estimates that airlines lose around 1 billion dollars annually due to payment fraud. There are numerous fraudulent schemes, including paying with stolen cards, claiming reimbursement for “lost” baggage, creating fake online travel agencies, and so on.\n\nFraud cases are becoming more sophisticated but so are fraud management techniques. In addition to enhancing customer authentication and payment security, airlines implement advanced, ML-based analytics software to process data from multiple sources and detect fraudulent transactions. Check our article dedicated to fraud detection to learn more about such systems and the main approaches to fraud management.\n\nBesides direct fraud, airlines experience losses due to so-called revenue leakage. Its sources include no-shows and cancelations, fare discrepancies, tariff abuse, and so on. Modern analytical solutions help identify potential revenue leakage cases and take preventive measures.\n\n9. In-airport self-service"
