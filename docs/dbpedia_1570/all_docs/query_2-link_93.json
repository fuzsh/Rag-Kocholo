        "text": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nThis application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/872,243, filed Aug. 30, 2013, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe present application is generally related to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\n\nUsage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is becoming much more common UAVs are used by many organizations, such as the military, law enforcement, and the like, and by individuals, such as UAV enthusiasts. UAV control typically includes a controller operating at a control system. The control system accepts inputs from the controller and transmits information wirelessly to a UAV in flight. The UAV can respond to the signals sent by the control system to change operation of the UAV, such as by changing a flight path, changing an elevation, releasing payload (e.g., a weapon), changing operation of payload (e.g., a camera or sensor), and the like. Control of a UAV can be difficult, and a simulator that simulates control of a UAV can help to reduce costs and minimize risks during UAV operator training A simulator can allow UAV operators to train in real-time to operate UAVs. A simulator may provide a virtual environment that is realistic but without the cost and risks of a real flight with a live UAV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIllustrative examples of the present disclosure include, without limitation, methods, structures, and systems.

The simulation characteristics may comprise a speed or altitude and a land or air type vehicle or a model of the vehicle.\n\nIn another aspect, a method of simulating an object can include displaying a map of a region, responsive to a single user input selecting a location on the map, displaying a plurality of actions operative on a simulated object, and performing a selected action from the plurality of actions.\n\nOther features of the methods, structures, and systems are described below. The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various examples or may be combined in yet other examples, further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nThroughout the drawings, reference numbers may be re-used to indicate correspondence between referenced elements.

During pre-production, aircraft manufacturing and service method 100 may include specification and design 102 of aircraft 200 and material procurement 104.\n\nDuring production, component and subassembly manufacturing 106 and system integration 108 of aircraft 200 takes place. Thereafter, aircraft 200 may go through certification and delivery 110 in order to be placed in service 112. While in service by a customer, aircraft 200 is scheduled for routine maintenance and service 114 (which may also include modification, reconfiguration, refurbishment, and so on).\n\nEach of the processes of aircraft manufacturing and service method 100 may be performed or carried out by a system integrator, a third party, and/or an operator (e.g., a customer). For the purposes of this description, a system integrator may include, without limitation, any number of aircraft manufacturers and major-system subcontractors; a third party may include, for example, without limitation, any number of venders, subcontractors, and suppliers; and an operator may be an airline, leasing company, military entity, service organization, and so on.\n\nAs shown in FIG. 2, aircraft 200 produced by aircraft manufacturing and service method 100 may include airframe 202 with a plurality of systems 204 and interior 206. Examples of systems 204 include one or more of propulsion system 208, electrical system 210, hydraulic system 212, and environmental system 214. Any number of other systems may be included in this example. Although an aerospace example is shown, the principles of the disclosure may be applied to other industries, such as the automotive industry.\n\nApparatus and methods embodied herein may be employed during any one or more of the stages of aircraft manufacturing and service method 100. For example, without limitation, components or subassemblies corresponding to component and subassembly manufacturing 106 may be fabricated or manufactured in a manner similar to components or subassemblies produced while aircraft 200 is in service.\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates systems or operating environments, denoted generally at 300, that provide flight plans for UAVs while routing around obstacles having spatial and temporal dimensions. These systems 300 may include one or more flight planning systems 302. FIG. 3 illustrates several examples of platforms that may host the flight planning system 302. These examples may include one or more server-based systems 304, one or more portable computing systems 306 (whether characterized as a laptop, notebook, tablet, or other type of mobile computing system), and/or one or more desktop computing systems 308. As detailed elsewhere herein, the flight planning system 302 may be a ground-based system that performs pre-flight planning and route analysis for the UAVs, or may be a vehicle-based system that is housed within the UAVs themselves.\n\nImplementations of this description may include other types of platforms as well, with FIG. 3 providing non-limiting examples. For example, the description herein contemplates other platforms for implementing the flight planning systems, including but not limited to wireless personal digital assistants, smartphones, or the like. The graphical elements used in FIG. 3 to depict various components are chosen only to facilitate illustration, and not to limit possible implementations of the description herein.\n\nTurning to the flight planning system 302 in more detail, it may include one or more processors 310, which may have a particular type or architecture, chosen as appropriate for particular implementations. The processors 310 may couple to one or more bus systems 312 that are chosen for compatibility with the processors 310.\n\nThe flight planning systems 302 may include one or more instances of computer-readable storage media 314, which couple to the bus systems 312. The bus systems may enable the processors 310 to read code and/or data to/from the computer-readable storage media 314. The media 314 may represent storage elements implemented using any suitable technology, including but not limited to semiconductors, magnetic materials, optics, or the like. The media 314 may include memory components, whether classified as RAM, ROM, flash, or other types, and may also represent hard disk drives.\n\nThe storage media 314 may include one or more modules 316 of instructions that, when loaded into the processor 310 and executed, cause the system 302 to provide flight plan computation services for a variety of UAVs 318. These modules may implement the various algorithms and models described and illustrated herein.\n\nThe UAVs 318 may be of any convenient size and/or type as appropriate for different applications. In different scenarios, the UAVs may range from relatively small drones to relatively large transport aircraft. Accordingly, the graphical illustration of the UAV 318 as shown in FIG. 1 is representative only, and is not drawn to scale.\n\nThe flight plan services 316 may generate respective flight plan solutions 320 for the UAVs 318 based on inputs 322, with flight planning personnel 324 and/or one or more databases 326 providing inputs 322.\n\nAssuming that the flight plan services 316 define one or more solutions 320, the flight planning system 302 may load the solutions into the UAVs 318, as represented by the arrow connecting blocks 302 and 318 in FIG. 3. In addition, the flight planning system 302 may also provide the solutions 320 to the flight planner 324 and/or the databases 326, as denoted by the arrow 320A.\n\nFIG. 4 depicts an example of a user interface for implementing a quick launch feature. Flight simulation is useful for providing training scenarios to operators of ground control systems. During initial launch of a simulated flight, the operator will typically have to go through a series of steps and procedures prior to launch of the flight. For example, such procedures may include simulated checks for the ground control station, links to ground equipment and radios, code to simulate autopilot and payloads, and so on. The simulation may be designed to provide the look and feel of a real flight scenario, and thus the operator may have to perform procedures such as turning on the UAV, turning on radios, starting the engine, etc.\n\nHowever, in many training scenarios, the operator may want to focus a training session on training in the air or some specific segment without having to go through the setup procedures. In one example, a quick launch feature may be provided to automate processes and speed up certain procedures so that the procedures can be performed without further user intervention and/or faster than real-time.\n\nIn one example, the quick launch feature may allow the operator to group a series of operational steps and to quickly begin a simulation session at a chosen point. The grouped operational steps may be performed automatically and may additionally be performed faster than real-time until the chosen point is reached. The quick launch feature thus allows for more efficient training, testing, and mission planning scenarios by allowing users to skip various time-consuming processes of launching the aircraft.\n\nIn some examples, the quick launch feature may allow the user to select specific points to jump to. Additionally, the quick launch feature may provide one or more default predefined points. In some examples, the predefined points may include all of the steps required to bring the simulated flight to a specified altitude.\n\nIn one example, the state of the quick launch feature may be displayed to the user as the steps for performed. For example, the user may view the following sequence:\n\nStarting Sim\n\nWaiting for simulation to start\n\nStarting Aircraft\n\nWaiting for Aircraft to start\n\nSelecting Aircraft\n\nWaiting for parameter files\n\nSetting fuel mass\n\nBy rendering the states of the quick launch feature rather than jumping to the selected start point, a trainee may be able to view the steps as they are completed on the screen, and thus be better able to understand the progression of how to launch a vehicle.\n\nAnother useful aspect of the quick launch feature is its role in automated regression testing. When implementing the quick launch feature, many or all of the code paths to launch an aircraft (for example, the autopilot code, the various controllers in the ground station software, the components communicating to embedded devices, etc.) need to work correctly. A software build process may include running a build through the quick launch feature, allowing for a quicker verification of new software builds without manually performing full procedural steps to verify functionality.\n\nAccordingly, the quick launch feature may be used to (1) allow a trainee to skip the launch procedures to concentrate on in-flight training, (2) allow a developer to test code in flight without going through all the launch procedures, and (3) allow automated build verification testing.\n\nIn some examples, a simulation scenario designer function can be provided in a UAV simulation system. In many cases it may be desirable to provide a training capability in the operational ground control station to provide training to UAV operators and trainees without expensive scenario generation software. A simulation scenario designer function may be directly built in to the ground control system. In some examples, map data such as Google Earth™ may be used to provide geographical information.\n\nFIG. 5 depicts an example of a simulation scenario designer function. As shown, a user interface for providing a simulation scenario designer function to a user may allow selection of various parameters and vehicles for tracking and input of a set of waypoints. A waypoint may comprise one or more sets of coordinates that identify a point in physical space. In one example, an operator may quickly start a scenario while operating the ground control station directly without having to start a scenario using a separate simulation tool. For example, the user may generate a route for a vehicle to follow. In the example shown, the user can select from a helicopter, RAM truck, HUMVEE, Toyota truck, or other entities. The user may also configure the vehicle to follow the route at a designated velocity, as shown in FIG. 6.\n\nIn some examples, a point and click modification function can be provided in a UAV simulation system. In one example, the point and click modification function may provide the ability to easily and dynamically place simulation objects on a map without having to use a start-up file, use pre-defined discrete locations, or to enter coordinates. For example, the user may be able to right-click on a displayed map to update simulation objects (e.g., thermals, initial vehicle location, launch and retrieval equipment) when desired.\n\nMany systems require separate files to be loaded at start-up or a discrete list of location options via the UI. In some cases the coordinates of these objects or entities may have to be entered by hand. As shown in the example in FIG. 7, a user interface for a point and click modification function may provide a flexible and user friendly interface by providing a context-sensitive menu based on the selected point and current scenario. In one example, the point and click modification function may allow the user to visually select where the user wants to position the entity and select the environmental effects. As shown in FIG. 7, a map window may render satellite imagery, which the operator may use to draw waypoints and routes.\n\nIn one example, a user may right click (i.e., clicking on the right button on a mouse or other input mechanism) on a displayed map, and the point and click modification function may determine a geographic position of the cursor at the point of the right click, such as the latitude and longitude. The point and click modification function may also determine the context (e.g., whether simulation has started or not) and determine user options based on the context. The user may then be presented a menu such as the menu depicted in FIG. 7. For example, if the simulation has not started, then the user may be able to use the map to select where the simulation should take place. In some examples, predefined or default locations may be provided that the user may select to direct the simulation. Thus when configuring a simulation, the user may view a map overlay that shows simulated entities and indicates where the aircraft is situated. The simulation objects may move on the map per the simulation and the location may be tracked. The location of the object may be displayed to the user on the map, and the user may select the object again to update information, whereupon the object may be updated in real-time.\n\nIn another example, during simulation a user may view where the aircraft is currently flying, click or select another point on the map, and the point and click modification function may instantly move the current location to the selected location without the user having to wait for the aircraft to move to the new location using simulated conditions. In some examples, the user can also select predetermined locations where various events can be simulated such as aircraft system warnings or failures.\n\nIn some examples, the point and click modification function may additionally perform logic checks to determine whether a request for placement of various objects should be allowed or if the user should be provided a warning. For example, the user may not be allowed to place vehicles in rivers, or only be able to place water vessels in bodies of water, etc.\n\nIn some examples, a user feedback mechanism may be provided to encourage feedback from users. An example user display is depicted in FIG. 8.\n\nFIG. 9 depicts an example of a method 900 including steps of simulating a launch of an unmanned air vehicle. At block 901, an interface for a user selectable launch option for a plurality of simulation modes is provided. At block 902, responsive to a user input at the interface, a launch of an unmanned air vehicle into an orbit using a predefined launch model and orbit parameters is simulated. In some examples, the user input may be a mouse click. Additionally, the predefined launch model may be a pneumatic launcher or a catapult launcher. In some examples, the orbit parameters may include an altitude and radius. Additionally, the plurality of simulation modes may include a training mode, testing mode, and planning mode.\n\nFIG. 10 depicts an example of a method 1000 including steps of simulating a launch of an unmanned air vehicle. At block 1001, one or more routes for the simulation is configured. In one example, the one or more routes comprise a plurality of obstacles or terrains and a number of waypoints. A route name or a route description may be included. At block 1002, simulation characteristics of the entity during the route are configured. In one example, the simulation characteristics comprise a speed or altitude and a land or air type vehicle or entity or a model of the vehicle or entity.\n\nFIG. 11 depicts an example of a method 1100 including steps of simulating an object. At block 1101, a map of a region is displayed. At block 1102, responsive to a single user input selecting a location on said map, a plurality of actions operative on a simulated object is displayed. At block 1103, a selected action from said plurality of actions is performed. The single user input may be a mouse click. In some examples, the displayed plurality of actions may include placing the simulated object at the selected location, removing an object from the selected location, creating the simulated object, and/or changing the location of the simulated object. Furthermore, the simulated object may be one of a target, thermal, launcher, air vehicle, land vehicle, water vessel, or skyhook. In some examples, the selected action may be operative on simulated objects of the same type. Additionally, the selected action may be performed at the selected location.\n\nFIG. 12 and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief general description of a suitable computing environment in which the methods and systems disclosed herein and/or portions thereof may be implemented.

Any combination of the features or elements disclosed herein may be used in one or more examples.\n\nConditional language used herein, such as, among others, “can,” “could,” “might,” “may,” “e.g.,” and the like, unless specifically stated otherwise, or otherwise understood within the context as used, is generally intended to convey that certain examples include, while other examples do not include, certain features, elements, and/or steps. Thus, such conditional language is not generally intended to imply that features, elements and/or steps are in any way required for one or more examples or that one or more examples necessarily include logic for deciding, with or without author input or prompting, whether these features, elements and/or steps are included or are to be performed in any particular example. The terms “comprising,” “including,” “having,” and the like are synonymous and are used inclusively, in an open-ended fashion, and do not exclude additional elements, features, acts, operations, and so forth. Also, the term “or” is used in its inclusive sense (and not in its exclusive sense) so that when used, for example, to connect a list of elements, the term “or” means one, some, or all of the elements in the list.\n\nIn general, the various features and processes described above may be used independently of one another, or may be combined in different ways. All possible combinations and subcombinations are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure. In addition, certain method or process blocks may be omitted in some implementations. The methods and processes described herein are also not limited to any particular sequence, and the blocks or states relating thereto can be performed in other sequences that are appropriate. For example, described blocks or states may be performed in an order other than that specifically disclosed, or multiple blocks or states may be combined in a single block or state. The example blocks or states may be performed in serial, in parallel, or in some other manner. Blocks or states may be added to or removed from the disclosed examples. The example systems and components described herein may be configured differently than described. For example, elements may be added to, removed from, or rearranged compared to the disclosed examples.\n\nWhile certain example or illustrative examples have been described, these examples have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions disclosed herein. Indeed, the novel methods and systems described herein may be embodied in a variety of other forms. The accompanying claims and their equivalents are intended to cover such forms or modifications as would fall within the scope and spirit of certain of the inventions disclosed herein."
