        "text": "TSA has issued Title 49 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations Part 1552 that prohibits a flight school from providing flight training in an aircraft or aircraft simulator to non-U.S. Citizens without TSA approval. Under this rule pilots must create and maintain a TSA account at https://www.fts.tsa.dhs.gov/home. Based on these details TSA will determine that the candidate is not a threat to aviation or national security and issue permission to train.\n\nTSA applications should be initiated at least 60 days prior to your scheduled training event.\n\nTSA defines flight training as instruction in a fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft or aircraft simulator that is consistent with the requirements to obtain a new skill, certificate, or type-rating, or to maintain a pilot certificate or rating. For the purposes of this rule, flight training does not include instruction in a balloon, glider, ultralight, or unmanned aircraft; ground training; demonstration flights for marketing purposes; simulated flights for entertainment purposes; or any flight training provided by the DoD, the U.S. Coast Guard, or any entity providing flight training under a contract with the DoD or Coast Guard.\n\nNon-US pilots receiving instruction in the following training activities, must apply to the Flight Student Security Program (FTSP), for obtaining TSA approval prior to simulator or aircraft training initiation.\n\nInitial pilot certification (whether private, recreational, or a sport pilot certificate), which provides a pilot with basic piloting skills.\n\nInstrument rating, which enhances a pilot’s abilities to pilot an aircraft in bad weather or at night and enables a pilot to better understand the instruments and physiological experiences of flying without reference to visual cues outside the aircraft.\n\nMulti-engine rating, which provides a pilot with the skill to operate more complex, faster aircraft.\n\nType-rating, which is a specific certification a pilot obtains to operate a certain type of aircraft, because this training is required beyond the initial, multi-engine, and instrument certification.\n\nRecurrent training for type-ratings, which is required to maintain or renew a type-rating already held by a pilot.\n\nCustomer Assistance\n\nFlightSafety offers free assistance to our customers in the creation of online TSA accounts. TSA accounts can be difficult to create properly with errors resulting in a delay of TSA approval. It is strongly recommended that you contact FlightSafety International’s TSA Assist Team to review your online TSA account information, at TSA.Assist@flightsafety.com.\n\nTSA Resources\n\nAccount Request\n\nFAQ\n\nTSA.gov"
