Considering the wide scope of Young Adult Literatures (YAL) from religion, mythology, science, fantasy, even to terrorism, it is time to apply these theories to legitimize a recognized place for YAL. We can reflect on its language, its representations, its mediating link between text and society, and other discursive critical thoughts and practices. And our reservations about it should be replaced with a range of questions: How are YA represented in YAL? What role do YA play in the plot construction of the novel? Are the young culture(s) represented in the fiction consistent with YA? How do the literary depiction of ‘age’ and ‘youth’ enable us to understand the Generation Y? How can we characterize YA writing as a genre? And finally, how YAL can help us in understanding perceptions of caste, class, gender, race, and disability.
