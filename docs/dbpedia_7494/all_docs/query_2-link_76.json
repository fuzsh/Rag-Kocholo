Most of the material will be familiar to students of Adams, but there is some interesting new information about his vision of himself as the equivalent of the Greek chorus, about his treatment of death, and about the controversial quotations at the head of each chapter.]\n\n12. Schmoll, Edward A. \"Homeric Reminiscence in Watership Down.\" Classical and Modern Literature 10.1 (Fall 1989): 21-26.
