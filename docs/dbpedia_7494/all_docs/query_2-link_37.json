        "text": "Brenna Book Reviews, 2013\n\nIn the flurry of new books out this year, writers at various stages in their careers offer page-turning encouragement for young readers.\n\nWith a publication history that spans over thirty years and seventy-titles, Montreal-born author Gordon Korman is a master at providing high-interest, plot-driven reading for middle-grade students and their teachers, with many of his titles making great classroom read-alouds. Jackson Opus, the twelve-year-old hero of The Hypnotists, a first book in Kormanâs new series (Scholastic hard cover, $18.99), has special abilities that eventually draw him into a clever conspiracy from which he must escape. The lives of his best friend and his parents, as well as the future of the entire United States, hang in the balance as Jax races against time and a power greater than his own.\n\nNot only is Kormanâs body of work motivating to readers, but his career trajectory can offer encouragement to writers, as well. Korman wrote his first book, This Canât Be Happening At Macdonald Hall, when he himself was twelve years old, penning it as an English assignment for a coach who suddenly found himself in the classroom. Korman later took the experience into the Sixth Grade Nickname Game, where the character of Mr. Huge is based on that memorable teacher. Kids might learn many lessons from this hard-working author, now living in New York, with details available on his website: www.gordonkorman.com. The Hypnotists is intended for ages nine to twelve.\n\nSusan White, a retired elementary school teacher from New Brunswick, skilfully invokes the past in her third novel, The Sewing Basket (Acorn Press paperback, $12.95). The twelve-year-old protagonist here is Ruth Iverson, whose world in 1967 revolves around friends, a boy she likes, the Monkees, and spending time with her dad. While her mother spirals into the devastating symptoms of Huntingtonâs disease, the summer seems to progress fairly smoothly for Ruth until the day her father leaves the family. Then, with a resilience she didnât know she had, Ruth manages to pick up the pieces of their broken home life and, with supports from family and friends, explore the possibility of living with disability and building a happy future at the same time. Not an easy book to read, for the details of the progression of Mrs. Iversonâs illness are not sugar coated, but honest writing that will find a niche with readers who appreciate stories that mirror reality. For ages eleven to fifteen.\n\nTudor Robins is a freelance writer from Ottawa whose first book Objects in the Mirror (Red Deer Press paperback, $12.95) promises fine things to come from this beginning author. Fifteen-year-old Grace is spending the summer working with horses at the nearby stables, contributing to the care of spirited and damaged animals as best she can until an eating disorder almost prevents her from doing a job she loves.\n\nThe careful weaving of Graceâs challenges into a complex family situation, a new love-interest, and aspects of riding that only a seasoned rider could present, demonstrate the authorâs strong storytelling abilities as well as a healthy respect for portraying familiar subjects. Writing teachers often suggest, âWrite what you know,â and it is clear that Robins has done just that, with great success. For ages twelve and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nThese dog days of August are perfect for checking out library books or spending that gift coupon at the bookstore, especially if not much reading has happened over the holidays so far. Kids who read over the summer tend to keep the reading skills they gained in the previous year, as ongoing reading cements new vocabulary and continues to reinforce comprehension strategies. Reading helps writers, as wellâsupporting grammar and the organization of ideas, among other things. Rain or shine, itâs not too lateâpick up a book thatâs not too difficult, on a topic that interests you, or find something digital that works where you are. Thanks to family members who help out, as just-right books are sometimes hard to find. And of course, family read-alouds are great ways to offer material thatâs just a little too hard for kids to navigate on their own!\n\nSaskatoon author Beth Goobieâs new novel The Throne (Red Deer Press paperback, $12.95) follows Meredith Polk through a grade ten year in which themes of resilience and bullying frame a story about how one seemingly small act of personal courage can ignite a series of destructive attacks. Told with Goobieâs distinct flair for authentic characters and sharp dialogue, this intelligent story is buoyed by the kind of humour that will catch and keep teen readers. Highly recommended for ages 12 and up.\n\nThree tales of summer, for different age groups, offer audiences a particularly timely context for reading material. Benjamin SÃ¡enzâs Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (Simon & Schuster hardcover, $19.99) follows a friendship that begins with the camaraderie of a swimming lesson and extends, over time, into something deeper. Winner of a 2013 Printz Honour Award, this is a sweet story, set in Texas in the late 1980s, about two characters underrepresented in young adult fiction: gay Latinos. A coming-of-age tale that is subtly handled through evocative first-person prose, this title is highly recommended for ages 14 and up.\n\nSylvia McNicollâs new title Dying to Go Viral (Fitzhenry & Whiteside paperback, $12.95) offers a healthy message about safety in extreme sports while at the same time exploring a subject not often dealt with in young adult fiction: life after death. In the first chapter, fourteen-year-old Jade dies in a skateboarding accident, while being filmed for a YouTube channel, and is then granted the opportunity to relive the last week of her life. Jadeâs character fairly leaps off the page, and readers will be instantly captivated by her warm heart and selfless goals. Highly recommended for ages 12 and up.\n\nBecky Citraâs junior fiction novel The Way Home (Second Story Press paperback, $$8.95) follows nine-year-old Tory as she navigates in and out of a new foster home. Reminiscent of an earlier Beth Goobie title, Jasonâs Why, this story works to fill in a gap about kids with untraditional family lives.\n\nToryâs friendship with a shaggy pony named Lucky is the one thing that makes life at the ranch worthwhile, but her personal challenges threaten to make her stay hereâor anywhereâimpossible. How Tory navigates through this period in her life is captivating, but what makes this title even more interesting for readers is that alternating chapters are told through Luckyâs eyes as he offers his own perspective on how the impending forest fire, and his brief experiences with freedom, have affected him. This page turner is highly recommended for ages 7 and up.\n\nIn addition to the brand new books available on the shelves, a short-list of old favourites includes the following:\n\nTop Twelve for Ages 4 â 7\n\nAlexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst\n\nA Screaming Kind of Day by Rachna Gilmore\n\nBinky the Space Cat by Ashley Spires\n\nBye, Bye, Butterflies by Andrew Larson\n\nDays with Frog and Toad by Arnold Lobel\n\nFrederick by Leo Lionni\n\nGiraffe and Bird by Rebecca Bender\n\nMaxâs Chocolate Chicken by Rosemary Wells\n\nMortimer by Robert Munsch\n\nNoisy Poems for a Busy Day by Robert Heidbreder\n\nOwl Moon by Jane Yolen\n\nThe Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle\n\nTop Twelve for Ages 7 â 11\n\nBugs Up Close by Diane Swanson\n\nThe Crazy Man by Pamela Porter\n\nJulie by Cora Taylor\n\nThe Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick\n\nOff to Class: Incredible and Unusual Schools Around the World by Susan Hughes\n\nRelatives With Roots: A Story About Metis Womenâs Connection to the Land by Leah Dorion\n\nRobert Munsch by Frank Edwards\n\nThe Spiral Maze by Patricia Bow\n\nThe Tale of Despereaux: The Graphic Novel by Matt Smith and David Tilton (original story by Kate Di Camillo)\n\nThe Tiger Rising by Kate Di Camillo\n\nTuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbitt\n\nWalter: The Story of a Rat by Barbara Wersba\n\nTop Twelve for Ages 11 â 14\n\nDust by Arthur Slade\n\nLove that Dog by Sharon Creech\n\nThe Owl Service by Alan Garner\n\nPlain Kate by Erin Bow\n\nThe Pigman by Paul Zindel\n\nRedwall by Brian Jacques\n\nSeraphina by Rachel Hartman\n\nSilverwing by Kenneth Oppel\n\nThe Storm in the Barn by Matt Phelan\n\nThirteenth Child by Patricia Wrede\n\nThis Land is My Land by George Littlechild\n\nA Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine LâEngle\n\nTop Twelve for Ages 14 â 17\n\nAbove by Leah Bobet\n\nBorderline by Alan Stratton\n\nCheeseburger Subversive by Richard Scarsbrook\n\nthe curious incident of the dog in the night time by Mark Haddon\n\nDreamhunter by Elizabeth Knox\n\negghead by Caroline Pignat\n\nKarma by Cathy Ostlere\n\nLunch with Lenin and Other Short Stories by Deborah Ellis\n\nReality Rules II: A Guide to Teen Nonfiction Reading Interests by Elizabeth Fraser\n\nSearch of the Moon Kingâs Daughter by Linda Holeman\n\nSkim by Mariko and Jillian Tamaki\n\nthe worst thing she ever did by Alice Kuipers\n\nYellow Mini by Lori Weber\n\nBack to Index\n\nTwo young adult novels that follow resilient characters in the aftermath of traumatic events are highly readable page-turners as well as literary achievements. Liane Shawâs The Color of Silence (Second Story Press paperback, $11.95) explores the perspectives of characters not often found in teen fiction. Seventeen-year-old Alex, involved in a car accident that killed her best friend, withdraws into selective mutism, using her voice for only the most necessary exchanges. A court order connecting her to community service is at first just another situation in which she feels powerless. Yet coming to know Joanie, a teenager whose genetic condition has left her with minimal control of her body and no speech, is revelatory for Alex. She begins to see outside her own circumstances and into Joanieâs reality in a way that produces healing. Both characters learn and grow through their relationship.\n\nThe developing bond between the two girls is narrated through their alternating first person voices. In addition, flashbacks take readers through what really happened to Cali, Alexâs friend, in the accident that took her life. This is a psychologically complex read, highly character driven, and told with the utmost care. Highly recommended for ages 12 and up.\n\nS. J. Laidlawâs first book An Infidel in Paradise (Tundra hardcover, $21.99) also explores themes of loss and friendship. The novel focuses on a time in sixteen-year-old Emmaâs life when the Canadian girl, her diplomat mother, and her siblings, move without her father from the Philippines to Pakistan. As Emma reels from her fatherâs choice to start a new family elsewhere, she struggles to find her place in yet another new country. A budding but impossible romance, combined with political tensions and the bombing of several American embassies around the world, start a chain of events that catches Emma unawares and puts her life at risk.\n\nLaidlaw has deftly captured the fictional essence of this girl. Emmaâs quick wit and ironical sense of humour are set against the clear vulnerability of being a stranger in a new land. Emmaâs clumsy navigation of coming-of-age in this setting is entirely believable, and, coupled with strikingly authentic dialogue, makes for a gripping story about identity and the importance of community. Even the minor characters are thoughtfully developed, giving the theme regarding the importance of friendships a healthy credibility.\n\nThe characterization of Emmaâs younger sister Mandy is handled particularly well, and one of the interesting things in this novel is the strengthening of the relationship between the girls. Highly recommended for ages 12 and up.\n\nA picture book for younger children that also follows a developing relationship between sisters is Bethanie Murguiaâs Zoeâs Room (No Sisters Allowed) (Scholastic hardcover, $18.99). Zoe has a comfortable routine until itâs time for Addie to move out of Mama and Papaâs room and into Zoeâs kingdom. At first, Zoe is underhandedly against her sisterâs presence, but on the night of a storm, Addie provides surprising comfort. Zoe rethinks her world and her sisterâs place in it. Highly recommended for ages 4 â 7.\n\nBack to Index\n\nTwo new young adult novels by Canadian authors explore parallel journeys by older teen boys who have been abused as children. Dianne Lindenâs On Fire (Thistledown paperback, $15.95) and Jan Andrewsâ The Silent Summer of Kyle McGinley (Great Plains paperback, $14.95) are intended for ages 14 and up, and offer unique formats through which two original realistic fiction stories are told.\n\nIn On Fire, fourteen-year-old Matilda (Mattie) Iverly discovers an amnesic young man wandering out of the heart of wildfire country who remembers nothing about his life. Over the course of time, as his mental illness is treated, his past returnsâfirst in flashbacks, and finally in full chronologyâand it isnât a happy one. We see him in alternating chapters told through Mattieâs first-person narrative, and then from Danâs own third person perspective.\n\nMattieâs character is an interesting one, and she is one of the few protagonists in young adult literature to have Touretteâs Syndrome (T.S.). While T.S. is evident in many of her interactions with others, it is not used as a single defining character trait, and for this reason her characterization is a dynamic and fresh. Readers unfamiliar with the condition will get an authentic sense of how T.S. feels from the inside through Mattieâs descriptionsâinclusions that are useful and not overdone. For example, she suggests that a tic feels like a sneeze that can be delayed, but that ultimately must eventually be released. She also suggests the variations that can be found in how individuals respond to their T.S.\n\nâA tic,â I said, âis like a twitch or a spasm. Some people with T.S. show it in their muscles. I mostly have vocal ticsâ¦â\n\nâAs long as you donât start swearing,â Mrs. Stoa said. âI draw the line there.â\n\nâMost people with Touretteâs donât burst out with four-letter words,â I told her. âIf you donât know any better than that, you should start reading hardcover books that are more educational.â\n\nHere Mattie is remarking on Mrs. Stoaâs immersion in what we soon learn is a paperback copy of Dante Alighieriâs classic title The Divine Comedy. Impressed by the older womanâs discussion of Danteâs travels through the underworld to save his soul, Mattie remembers this author when trying to find a name for the compelling stranger who is covered with blood and dirt. Dante thus becomes Dan, while the book remains as an allegory for the journey Dan himself is making back to health. It is notable that Linden chooses to reference adult literature in a book for young adultsâencouraging âreading upâ through intertextual references that might inspire.\n\nOne of Lindenâs earlier books, Shimmerdogs, was a silver medallist for the 2008 Governor General's Award for Children's Literature. It, along with her first title, Peacekeepers, mirror the strong skills in characterization and sensory-rich narrative found in On Fire; this new book is a solid literary product predictive of further awards.\n\nIn The Silent Summer of Kyle McGinley, Andrews creates a character who remembers all too well the abuses in his past. The first person narrative emerges as a compelling stream of consciousness, with the inventive inclusion of two imaginary other voices in addition to Kyleâs ownâthe first is a character in Kyleâs head who gives him good advice, and the second provides a barrage of constant negative feedback. The latter, included in bold italicized print, is soon attributed to Kyleâs fatherâa man who abandoned the boy when Kyle was young, but not before cementing his assaults, both verbal and physical, on the childâs consciousness.\n\nWhat is so captivating about this book is that the reader quickly gets the sensation of how it feels to have competing messages in oneâs head as well as a reason for why a fifteen-year-old boy would sentence himself to silence. Silence is how Kyle has decided to respond to the world that has treated him so badlyâthrough elective mutism.\n\nIn Kyleâs favour, he is a nice guy and an artist, and one who quickly endears himself to Scott and Jillâthe couple who provide a new foster home in the string of homes Kyle has had to endure. In similar fashion, he endears himself to readers, and from early in the book we share his story and remarkable insight, hoping against odds that he will find a way to triumph over the cards heâs been dealt. And we are not disappointed.\n\nAndrews has achieved a masterful dialogue here between Kyle, his imaginary self, and his re-creation of his abuserâs voice, a dialogue that is serviceable to the book in that it clearly advances the plot. For its ingenuity of format and masterful characterization, as well as a poignant storyline, this title is highly recommended.\n\nBack to Index\n\nThe power of non-fiction in motivating kids to read has often been overlooked in settings where access to non-fiction titles has been limited to research projects. A traditional view of childrenâs reading is that early experiences with books facilitate âlearning to readâ and then, later, other experiences support âreading to learn.â Some new non-fiction resources bolster a different view. From young ages, children can gain interesting and useful information as they are read to, as they explore pictures, and as they begin to decode text that matters to them. Fluent readers can find plenty to enjoy in non-fiction titles chosen for aesthetic reading as well as reading for information.\n\nFor the youngest age group, Frank Serafiniâs Looking Closely Around the Pond, (Kids Can Press hardcover, $16.95) is a visual delight. With sections of pictures enlarged and offered as âmysteries,â readers are invited to guess what the item actually is and then turn the page to find out. âLook very closely. What do you see? Seashells? Butterfly wings? What could it be?â Highly recommended for shared reading with ages 4 and up.\n\nKari-Lynn Wintersâ Buzz About Bees (Fitzhenry & Whiteside hardcover, $19.95) demonstrates mastery in design and formatting, with text boxes, layered photographs, and colour used capably to enhance meaning. Instead of facing large sections of difficult text, a tradition in less contemporary titles, this book offers bits of information in manageable pieces, smartly employing titles and captions as well as passages of various lengths.\n\nIn addition to its surface appeal, Buzz About Bees virtually hums with interesting facts. For example, did you know that bees have five eyes? Or that a desert biologist named Justin Schmidt has taken on the job of getting stung by bees around the world so that he can create a pain index? Or that some bees feed their babies bee breadâa mixture of nectar, pollen, and saliva? Highly recommended for ages 7 and up (the book, not the bee bread!).\n\nJohnny Issalukâs activity book Games of Survival: Traditional Inuit Games for Elementary Students (Inhabit Media paperback, $12.95) is a simply written illustrated collection of ten games geared towards developing agility, strength, and endurance. A competitive athlete, Issaluk lives in Iqaluit, Nunavut, where he volunteers as a coach and trainer when not performing arctic sports at home and abroad. Highly recommended for ages 7 to 12.\n\nNo Borders: Bridging Communities and Generations (Fifth House hardcover, $19.95) is the unique story of an Inuk teenager from Kugluktuk, Nunavut. Written by Darla Evyagotailak and educator Mindy Willett, Darla describes her family, the history around her community, and cultural traditions. She also shares her sadness at the loss of an older brother to suicide. Striking photographs by Tessa Macintosh complete this photo-journal, and short sections of italicized text provide helpful captions to accompany the visuals. Highly recommended for ages 10 and up.\n\nChristine Welldonâs Reporter in Disguise: The Intrepid Vic Steinberg (Fitzhenry & Whiteside hardcover, $19.95) offers a tremendously intriguing biography of a nineteenth century Toronto journalist. Revealing the challenges of being a working woman in the 1890s, this text is a delightful read, offering snippets from the popular column in the Toronto News that kept everyone guessing.\n\nWhen finally âVicâsâ publications ceased in 1895, there was only speculation about who this writer was, and how she managed to conceal herself to explore the contexts she wanted to write about. From disguising herself as a man who enjoyed a pint of beer at a rugby match, to a seamstress in a sweatshop, Vic left no stone unturned in her quest for the real story.\n\nIn her column âBachelor Girl,â Vic elucidates on a shopping trip with a friend. âTo keep on my dignity for one whole afternoon, to indulge in an amount of small talk and say a number of pretty things which mean nothing, is not wholly agreeable to my nature.â\n\nThe term âBachelor Girlâ was fast coming into use for the unmarried woman, and Vic was quick to use it as another name for the âNew Woman,â âsomeone who had chosen to turn her back on becoming a wife and mother for the time being. Photographs and fonts give this title a Victorian feel while retaining a thoroughly modern formatâshort sections of easily accessible text interspersed with longer narrative chapters. Highly recommended for capable readers ages 11 and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nThree books with unpredictable endings top the basket of new titles this spring. For the youngest set, Where Do You Look? by Canadian mother/daughter team Marthe and Nell Jocelyn (Tundra, hardcover, $17.99) playfully introduces homonyms. Where do you look for a cap? On a tube of toothpaste? Or on your head? Where do you look for a button ? On a shirt? Or on a telephone? Brightly illustrated with vivid collage, this is a fun title for shared reading with kids ages 2 â 5, and its closing plug for bedtime reading is simply delightful.\n\nJulien BÃ©ziatâs MÃ¤ko (Fitzhenry & Whiteside, paperback, $9.95) is a clever tale about a walrus whose ice sculptures prove to be more important than anyone at first realizes. On the one hand, this is a playful animal fantasy; on the other hand, itâs a deeply sensitive tale about the value of the fine arts. MÃ¤ko resonates with other well-told classic picture books such as Leo Lionniâs Frederick, and will no doubt carve a place for itself among the books that endure in the field of childrenâs literature. For ages 5 and up.\n\nKristin Butcherâs new title Truths I Learned from Sam (Dundurn, paperback, $12.99) is a fast-paced read for ages 11 to 15. Deftly combining a character study with light romance, the book will appeal to readers who are looking for a title that is thought-provoking but not troubling, and a main character in Dani that is resilient and positive.\n\nWhen Daniâs mother gets married for the sixth time and jets away on honeymoon, seventeen-year-old Dani is swept from her typical summer plans into Cariboo country where she stays with an uncle she never knew she had. Told with a teenâs characteristically exaggerated narrative, the storyâwhile certainly not âhappy ever afterââoffers much to smile over. Truths I Learned from Sam will also be a good introduction to this Canadian authorâs worthy list of over 20 titles for young people.\n\nBack to Index\n\nWhat Kind of Goodbye? (paperback, $9.95) is a children's picture book about death and loss, self-published by a local first-time author-illustrator team: Darlene Klassen and Samantha McRorie. Evocative free verse and soft, prairie landscape paintings are a captivating duo in this gentle reminder that while a loved one is gone, he or she can be remembered. With spaces left open for the inclusion of personal photographs and reflections, this small, empathetic book is sensitively crafted to offer encouragement to children who are grieving. Both its poetry, and its gallery-class watercolours, are inviting to all ages. Available through whatkindofgoodbye@sasktel.net.\n\nAnother picture book that emphasizes family connections as well as the passage of time is The Granddaughter Necklace by Sharon Dennis Wyeth, illustrated in acryl-gouache by Bagram Ibatoulline (Arthur A. Levine, hardcover, $18.99). The clever premise that a glass necklace is passed down through seven generations, from mother to daughter, produces an evocative tale about identity and family history. This is a title that may inspire other family stories, and its simple framework can be easily adapted for original projects by young writers. For ages six to ten.\n\nSarah E. Turner's new narrative non-fiction picture book Ribbon's Way (Sono Nis Press, paperback, $9.95) explores mothering from a monkey's perspective while at the same time crafting a parable about the possibilities that disability offers. When baby Ribbon arrives, the visitors at Japan's Awaji Island Monkey Center wonder how she is going to manage with no hands and with malformed feet. How will she hang on to her mother? How will she keep up with the other monkeys? How will she someday look after her own baby? The answers to these questions unfold one by one as Ribbon finds a new way to do thingsâRibbon's way. Her condition is not unusual in the context of this zoo, as one in six monkeys are born with anomalies, but whether genetics, pesticides, or a combination of these are to blame, scientists remain perplexed.\n\nTurner's monkeysâJapanese macaquesâwere part of her master's and PhD work and an earlier bookâThe Littlest Monkeyâchronicles the story of another primate. Striking original photographs complement each of Turner's two books. For ages five to ten.\n\nBack to Index\n\nLinda Smithâs fantasy novel The Piper of Shadonia (Coteau paperback, $14.95), published posthumously, is a strong character-driven read that resonates with universal themes. Two cultures inhabit the same living space, each bidding for power in a relationship that is crafted to show how individuals choose different ethical stances towards their enemy. The audience is left with an understanding that war is made up of multiple points of viewâa complex message but deftly drawn.\n\nTobin, the son of a mayor answering to the dominant class of Forenzians, cares more about the ancient and supressed world of Shadonia. As he discovers his own Shadonian gifts, he is persuaded to side with the rebels against his own family, until, at the last, he makes a decision that offers sanctuary, if only temporary, for both sides.\n\nWhere fantasy offers readers a chance to explore contemporary themes through the safe distance of story, this title is a stellar example. Linda Smith was a childrenâs librarian who authored picture books, poetry and short fiction in addition to a number of other fantasy titles including The Broken Thread and the Tales of Three Lands trilogy as well as the Freyan Trilogy. Her death in 2007 was a blow to the literary world and it is commendable that the editors at Coteau Books worked to bring this latest manuscript to light. For ages twelve to fourteen.\n\nA debut fantasy author newly published by Coteau Books is Catherine Egan, whose fantasy trilogy The Last Days of Tian Di begins with Shade & Sorceress (Coteau Books paperback, $12.95). Although the use of an original dialect may be difficult to some readers in the interpretation of Eliza Tok, the spunky main character who carries this title, patience is rewarded as the book is finely plotted and worth the effort. For ages ten to fourteen.\n\nThe question that drives Jamie Bastedoâs fantasy Nighthawk (Red Deer Press paperback, $12.95) is simply this: what happens when a nighthawk is unable to read the stars? For Wisp, the juvenile nighthawk anthropomorphized in this book, it means trouble navigating and being fenced in by his starving colony. Escaping on a forbidden migratory journey, Wisp exemplifies the independent spirit of any young teen with challenges as he struggles to use unexpected gifts and find his own path.\n\nBastedoâa biologist turned storytellerâhas a clear rationale for selecting the nighthawk as a protagonist. A threatened species, the nighthawk is an intriguing bird worth saving, a fact made clear in this evocative narrative that cameos gripping landscapes from the Amazon to the Arctic. Other animal fantasies that will make good companion reads include Oppelâs Darkwing and Martiniâs Feather and Bone crow chronicles. For ages ten and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nA new year means new books ahead, but a few titles from 2012 are well worth hanging onto.\n\nSaskatoon author Beth Goobieâs Jasonâs Why (Red Deer paperback, $8.95) tells the story of a nine-year-old boy transitioning into a group home when his mother canât cope.\n\nI am at our living-room window. Iâm waiting. I can hear my mom. She moves around our house. She goes up and down our stairs. She carries green garbage bags to the door. All my stuff is in those bags. There are three of them.\n\nThe first person point of view is personal and poignant, and the text, while simple enough for young readers, is also accessible to older struggling readers without being patronizing. Jasonâs story is one rarely encountered in childrenâs books and offers an authentic picture of what happens when a child goes into care.\n\nOne of the particularly notable features of this tale is the sensitivity shown by the author towards all of her characters. We see the abuse of the son by his mother, and the effects this has had on the boy, but we also see a parent who is scared and doesnât know how to make things right. This is clearly a book about people, with all their flaws. Through the support of workers at his group home, and school personnel, Jason learns that itâs okay to make mistakes. During the course of the story he also discovers strategies to help himself control his negative behavior. The ending isnât âhappily ever afterâ but itâs true to life.\n\nâ¦still itâs hard. I donât know whatâs going to happen. Mom said she loved me, I think. But will she really let me move home again? Or will I be stuck in this group home maybe forever?\n\nAll these questions, and I donât know the answers. If only I didâright now. But I guess I canât, I think. I canât make the answers happen right now. Iâll have to wait.\n\nJoe comes into the living room. âHey, Jason,â he says. âWant to play cards?â\n\nAnd you know, I think, maybe this place isnât so badâ¦\n\nThe people in this story need more time to heal and learn, but there is hope for all of them. Thatâs the best thing about this book: its message about hope even in the most troubling circumstances. A title of striking versatility, Jasonâs Why is highly recommended for all ages including adults learning to support youth in crisis.\n\nPrevious books about youth in care are written specifically for older audiences, and include Diana Wielerâs Last Chance Summer, a story set on a farm for troubled teens, and Jacqueline Guestâs At Risk, a mystery contextualized in a ranch facility. Guest, a MÃ©tis writer, will be in Saskatoon in February to receive the prestigious Indspire Award for her outstanding achievements in the Arts.\n\nA second 2012 title worthy of acclaim is Valerie Sherrardâs free-verse novel for young adults: Counting Back from Nine (Fitzhenry & Whiteside paperback, $9.95). The storyline follows the first-person account of a teenage girl who secretly dates her friendâs ex-boyfriend, eventually isolating herself from a group of girls sheâs known all her life. The theme of cheating on those who love you is paralleled by a secret that unhappily unfolds after Larenâs father is suddenly killed in a car accident. Through poems grouped in a series of tightly wrought chapters, Sherrard skilfully juxtaposes related plot lines to accomplish a masterful epiphany. Highly recommended for ages twelve and up.\n\nA third selection of note from the past year is Susin Nielsenâs governor generalâs award winner for childrenâs text: The Reluctant Journal of Henry K. Larson (Tundra hardcover, $19.99). Thirteen-year-old Henryâs first-person story appears through journal entries that detail events surrounding an older brotherâs suicide. Readers learn that Jesse was a bullied teen who formulated and actualized a plan to shoot his worst enemy at school, and then end his own life. How Henry processes his agonizing memories and learns to live with himself is part of the story; the other part involves the intriguing people he comes to know in his journey forward. While at times difficult to read, through Henryâs eyes, the devastating events that took place, this is also a tale filled with warmth and humour. Recommended for ages 13 and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nBrenna Book Reviews, 2012\n\nMelanie Wattâs new fun-filled safety guide: Scaredy Squirrel Prepares for Christmas (Kids Can Press, hardcover, $18.85) is well-equipped to support even the most anxious through the Christmas season. For example, a few red things to avoid decorating with include: dynamite, street signs, chili peppers, dragons, poisonous berries, and fire hydrants. Similarly, green things to avoid include: martians, tons of air fresheners, catnip, caterpillars, poison ivy, and bullfrogs. One particularly helpful page lists our favourite squirrelâs Top 10 Worst Kissing Scenarios: 1. Mistletoe above a piranha-infested pond. 2. Mistletoe above an anthill. 3â¦You get the picture. Nothing didactic here, just complete and nutty amusement. For ages 5 to 9.\n\nFinding Christmas by Robert Munsch (Scholastic hardcover, $19.99) is about Munschâs daughter Julie who always managed to find all the presents before Christmas morning. Signature humour by Munsch and illustrator Robert Martchenko, as expected, in this delightful family romp. For ages 4 to 7.\n\nJane Yolenâs How Do Dinosaurs Say Merry Christmas? (Scholastic hardcover, $18.99), illustrated by Mark Teague, is an imaginative foray into homes that people and dinosaurs share. With skilfully embedded lessons in manners, the simple couplets will engage even the youngest listeners in chiming in with the rhyming words. For ages 3 to 7.\n\nAnother seasonal title by Yolen and Teague is How Do Dinosaurs Say Happy Chanukah? (Scholastic hardcover, $18.99). A different set of dinosaurs from the Christmas book, with a similar message: donât act up during the festivities. For ages 3 to 7.\n\nDmitrea Tokunboâs The Sound of Kwanzaa (Scholastic hardcover, $21.99), illustrated by Lisa Cohen, is an informative look at a celebration observed from December 26 to January 1 as a time to reaffirm African American culture. Taking readers through each of the seven days of festivity, the book is clear and vibrant, concluding with a tasty recipe, and a bibliography for further reading. For ages 5 to 8.\n\nK. G. Campbellâs author-illustrator debut appears in a lively vision of what itâs like to receive sweaters from Cousin Clara in Lesterâs Dreadful Sweaters (Kids Can Press hardcover, $18.95). Campbell is a clever wordsmith and an artist capable of capturing the height of hilarity. This is sure to be just the beginning of an illustrious career in childrenâs literature.\n\nâNo one knew exactly whose cousin Cousin Clara was, so she came to stay with Lesterâs family. She was little and frilly and came with a basket of knittingâ¦â Although innocuous at first, Clara becomes the bane of Lesterâs existence as she makes him sweater after horrible sweater, even as he is skilfully disposing of the last. How Lester solves his problem once and for all, and Clara finds her true calling, make for a smart ending to an original take on an old story about giving and receiving. Campbellâs illustrations further extend the storyâs sly wit to older readers as well as captivating the 4 to 8 set for whom it was originally intended.\n\nBack to Index\n\nChanging forms and formats continue to push the envelope as far as reading material goes for ages nine and up. Graphic novels in a variety of genres now offer reading fare alternatives to traditional narrative texts. At one time, the reading of pictures stopped at an age when juvenile picture books ceased to appeal, but now we have picture books designed for older readers, as well as visual information included in texts of all shapes and sizes. These changes arenât bad. If our goal is to encourage wide reading for enjoyment and information, the inclusion of pictures is an asset that supports comprehension, diversifying the bait we put out to lure kids into reading.\n\nSusan Vande Griekâs Loon (Groundwood hardcover, $18.95) is a feast for the eyes, a picture book marketed for the 6 to 9 age group but pleasing to older audiences, as well. Karen Reczuchâs acrylic on canvas illustrations are breathtaking, their depth of field deftly pulling viewers into the loonsâ world as we sample the life cycle of two loon chicks. The genre is narrative non-fiction, achieved through a prose poetry form that is predictable in its sequential format. Highly recommended especially when we need to contemplate the beauty of the changing seasons.\n\nL. Pichonâs winner of the Roald Dahl Funny Prize is The Brilliant World of Tom Gates (Scholastic paperback, $7.99). This book is best categorized as a kind of rebus diary, where words carry the story of Tomâs life, with the help of inserted pictures. Drawing, dogs, and the band Dude3 are highlights of Tomâs life, as are pranking his sister, avoiding homework, and trying to impress a girl in class, and this title isnât so different from many other popular contemporary juvenile books except for its illustrated form. A fun read for ages 8 and up.\n\nMike Ideas, a seasoned graphic novel illustrator, has completed the whole package in Dalen & Gole: Scandal in Port Angus (Orca paperback, $9.95). Dalen and Gole are two alien buddies who accidently end up on earth. With their human friend Rachel, they follow a mystery and assist both the fishing community of Port Angus and Budapâtheir home planet.\n\nThis junior graphic novel contains consistent characters and a likeable, humorous storyline that is forwarded by the illustrations as much as the text. The interplay of text and visuals is one element to look for when evaluating graphic novels and, in this case, Ideas has found a good balance. Coloured panels inform us about setting and mood without duplicating such information in the dialogue. Another fun read for ages 8 and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nDavid Poulsen, the new Writer in Residence for the Saskatoon Public Library and a past graduate of the University of Saskatchewan, will release a new young adult novel in January, 2013. Old Man (Dundurn paperback, $12.99) covers territory unique to YA fiction through a father-son story set in Saigon. Just as summer vacation begins for fifteen-year-old Nate Huffman, his absentee father arranges a mysterious trip that begins by car and extends into a flight out of Minneapolis that is Nateâs first hint that the holiday involves serious travel.\n\nââGettingâ more like a buddy movie all the time,ââ jests Nateâs father after an hour on the road, but Nate doesnât get the joke. The âold manâ left when Nate was five, and now nothing his father does is funny, nor can Nate even begin to think of his dad as a âbuddy.â\n\nHow two people with a connection long severed come to know each other again is one of the intriguing aspects of this novel, and Poulsenâs approach is sure and steady, creating a realistic build towards a predictable ending that links a parentâs mortality with a teenagerâs coming-of-age. Another aspect of the novel worth praising is Nateâs realistic and highly readable first-person narrative. The kid is both likeable and detail orientedâthe latter a helpful trait when it comes to reproducing scenes from memory, punchy dialogue and all.\n\nA third notable aspect of this book involves originality. The Vietnam War experiences of the old man, even as they are reflected through Nateâs eyes, are poignant and raw, and the bookâs setting and content are definitely a subject worth exploring. Highly recommended for mature teens ages14 and up.\n\nWith his new young adult novel Money Boy (Groundwood paperback, $12.95), Paul Yee adds to his extensive body of work that portrays Chinese immigrants and their descendants in both historical and contemporary settings. Born in Spalding, Saskatchewan, Yee now lives and works in Toronto.\n\nMoney Boy skilfully explores the subject of prejudice through international as well as local lenses. Eighteen-year-old Ray Liu has an uneasy relationship with his father even before Ba suspects that Ray is homosexual. Online evidence to support Rayâs sexual orientation becomes the catalyst for Ba to throw him out of the houseâand from that point on, the novel races through scenes that for some readers may be difficult to process due to the fast-paced stream-of- consciousness narration. This narration, however, repeats and unpacks important themes, in a clear and contemporary Toronto setting, building towards a profound message about the importance of self-acceptance and community. Highly recommended for mature teens ages 14 and up.\n\nJust in time for Halloweâen comes Denise Despeyrouxâs picture book for older readers, The Big Book of Vampires (Tundra hardcover, $19.99). Including nine adaptations from well-known English vampire stories, and then four vampire folktales from China, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, this hefty compendium of thirteen tales is certainly something readers can sink their teeth into. Illustrations by Fernando Falcone are most suitably long-necked, offering a darkly humorous counterpart to a text that will interest struggling older readers as well as general audiences ages 10 and up who appreciate the macabre.\n\nBack to Index\n\nSaskatoon author Arthur Slade has now published the fourth and final book in The Hunchback Assignments steampunk series: Island of Doom (HarperCollins hard cover, $18.99). In an investigation that takes him back to his origins, agent Modoâs history is the hinge that moves this book along, with the help of Sladeâs trademark cast of captivating characters.\n\nA theme that has carried throughout all four titles is the relationship between physical beauty and identity, with Modo continually searching for love and acceptance in spite of his âdisfiguredâ face and body, a search that fuels his need to exchange one stereotypical mask for another in his repertoire of personas.\n\nA remarkably literate fellow, Modoâs repartee includes references to classic literature, offering titles that might support a readershipâs âreading upâ without detracting from the plotâs velocity. His intellect is clearly one quality that endears him to the people with whom he lives and works:\n\nâYour brain is a great big book, ainât it, Modo?â Octavia said. âIf we cracked open your skull weâd just find pages and pages of words.â\n\nâIâm glad I impressed you.â\n\nâOh, I didnât say that.â\n\nBut he could tell that he had.\n\nOnly a skilled writer would tackle the omniscient demands required by such a complex plotline, where the story is narrated from multiple third-person perspectives in rapid succession. Kudos to Slade for the completion of an energetic tour de force, recommended for ages twelve and up.\n\nAnother fantasy character with issues related to the body and self-acceptance is Seraphina in a novel of the same name by first-time Vancouver author Rachel Hartman (Doubleday hardcover, $21.00). With richly descriptive prose, this title unfolds as an example of master storytelling through the confidential perspective of a sixteen-year-old girl.\n\nSeraphina, a gifted musician and assistant to the court composer, is the illegal daughter of a union between a dragon and a mortal. She subsequently carries a band of scales around her waist and wrist that, although hidden, continually remind her of her singular and risky state.\n\nSome of the most interesting characterizations in the book appear in Hartmanâs portrayal of dragons, who, in taking up temporary human forms, have certain identifiable qualitiesâsuch as a lack of emotion and a tendency to take things literallyâthat make dialogues both funny and illuminative in a setting reminiscent of the early Renaissance. The hint of a sequel will leave readers twelve and up cheering for more.\n\nA picture book for younger readers, also containing themes related to diversity and acceptance, is Oliver Jeffersâ The New Jumper, the first book in a series about the Hueys (HarperCollins hardcover, $19.99). In this installment, the thing about the Hueys is that they are all the sameâ¦they look the same, think the same, and do the same things. Then, one day, Rupert knits himself a new jumper that sets him apart from the rest. At first the others are horrified, but it isnât long before they follow suit, knitting themselves jumpers to match so they âwould be different too!â After a while, everyone is the same again. Then Rupert finds himself a new hatâ¦ and the implications are clear. For ages five and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nSummertime offers a few extra minutes of daylight great for reading, and the following titles may provide intriguing substance.\n\nFor the younger set, stave off sleep by choosing picture books that capture childrenâs imaginations while at the same time appealing to adults who may be reading these books aloud. Three culturally anchored stories provide fuel for thought as well as brilliant illustrations: A Hen for Izzy Pippick by Aubrey Davis, The Rumor by Anushka Ravishanka, and Under the Ice by Rachel A. Qitsualik.\n\nThe Rumor (Tundra hardcover, $19.99), illustrated by Kanyika Kini, is set in Indiaâs Sahyadri Mountains. This story is an international version of âthe telephone gameâ where a message passed from person to person drastically changes in content. Comic and yet with an authentic message about the danger of rumors. For ages 5 to 8.\n\nA Hen for Izzy Pippik (Kids Can Press hardcover, $18.95), with whimsical art by Marie Lafrance, is based on Jewish and Islamic traditional texts and tells the story of a little girl who, in standing up for what is right, subsequently populates her village with chickens. For ages 4 to 8.\n\nUnder the Ice (Inhabit Media paperback, $9.95) is a retelling of a traditional Inuit qallupiluit story, conceived by art director Babah Kalluk. In this case, the multi-faceted monster steals a little boy on the whim of his irritable grandmother, and then the village tries to reclaim him. Comic-like illustrations by Jae Korin complete this book; potentially scary content makes it more suitable for older children ages 8 and up.\n\nThree other picture books about relationships are also definitely worth a read: Here Comes Hortense, by Heather Hartt-Sussman, Larf, by Saskatoon author/illustrator Ashley Spires, and Virginia Wolf by Kyo Maclear.\n\nHere Comes Hortense, zanily illustrated by Georgia Graham, is a sequel to Nanaâs Getting Married. This new title offers newly acquainted grandchildren the chance to share Nana and Bob, a source of conflict but also an opportunity for developing fresh familial friendships as two kids explore a theme park in unexpected ways. For ages 4 â 7.\n\nAshley Spires, whose Binky series is already popular with the under 9 set, brings a seven-foot-tall, scarf-sporting sasquatch into the picture as Larf attempts to meet another like himself. His hilarious antics preparing for the event include bathing when ââ¦He hasnât had a bath inâ¦ever!â Larfâs surprise ending will warm the hearts of readers everywhere; for ages 4 â 7.\n\nVirginia Wolf covertly chronicles the childhood relationship between writer Virginia Woolf and her sister, Vanessa Bell, through a story about a little girl who encourages her moody âwolfishâ sibling to communicate through art. Isabelle Arsenaultâs mixed media illustrations include ink, pencil, watercolour, and goacheâenhancing the hand-lettered text throughout what becomes a war of emotions light and dark. Older readers may perceive this tale to be a metaphorical narrative about depression and for that reason the reading age is extended from 4 to adult.\n\nI lay beside her on the bed.\n\nWe were two quiet lumps under the blanket.\n\nWe sank deep among the pillows.\n\nWe looked out the window and gazed at the sky.\n\nWe watched the clouds: a smudgy sailboat,\n\na flying llama and a floating castle.\n\nIt was like a whole other world.\n\nStill, my sister said nothing. To anybody.\n\nTwo novels for older children offer Canadian perspectives on coming-of-age. Valerie Sherrardâs The Glory Wind (Fitzhenry & Whiteside paperback, $12.95) and Dawn Dumontâs Nobody Cries at Bingo (Thistledown paperback, $15.95) are authentic tales that combine historical insight with innovative storytelling techniques.\n\nThe Glory Wind is a heartbreaking story about friendship, prejudice, and loss, set on the prairies in 1946. Overcoming the obstacles of a mixed-gender friendship, neighbours Luke and Gracie support each other until a tornadoâboth figurative and literalâcreates its havoc, with Gracieâs single-parent status at its eye. Highly recommended for ages 11 and up.\n\nNobody Cries at Bingo reads as a combination of young adult novel and memoir since its author was born on the Okanese First Nation where the story takes place. Rather than unfolding in chronological order, the chapters operate along themes that stand alone as well as contribute to an understanding of Dawn Dumontâs growing-up years between pre-school and first-year law school.\n\nI was born in a small Saskatchewan town called Balcarres. The town had given itself the nickname, the âPride of the Prairies,â which is a pretty bold statement for a community that boasts more boarded up stores and businesses than regular ones.\n\nShortly after my debut, I was relocated to the Okanese reserve via a ride in our grandparentsâ car. Okanese is Cree for Rosebud. The reserve doesnât really have a nickname although many people have called it the âarmpit of the universe,â usually after they lost an election.\n\nFilled with humour and rich detail, Nobody Cries at Bingo is a captivating and at times gritty read that combines the personal with the universal, taking readers on a journey that covers local history in territory not previously encountered in Canadian literary young adult fiction. Highly recommended for mature readers ages 13 and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nChickadee, book four of The Birchbark House series by Louise Erdrich (HarperCollins paperback, $8.99), continues the first generation story of Omakayas begun with The Birchbark House, The Game of Silence, and The Porcupine Year. This second generation tale occurs in the mid 1800s and is based on the adventures of twin sons Chickadee and Makoons. Erdich developed these novels as counterparts to Laura Ingalls Wilderâs classic Little House books, foregrounding her own Anishinabeg/Ojibwe family stories and providing American history from a Native American point of view.\n\nWith its gentle humour, authentic settings, and a plot that includes some breathtaking twists and turns, Chickadee is highly recommended for adult read-alouds with children ages eight and up. It also works as a stand-alone title for independent reading, but readers who appreciate Erdrichâs style will want to check out the others in the series.\n\nEarthFlight by John Downer (Firefly Books, hardcover, $49.95) is a rich collection of photographs to accompany the BBC series of the same name. Downer utilized spycams, microlights, hang-gliders, miniature helicopters and wirecams to give viewers privileged pictures of birds in flight, showing us not only the birds themselves, but what they see. Most provocative is a story of a bird imprinting on the author and then following his parachute while action shots were captured. Although not designed for younger children due to the inclusion of blocks of fine print, the photographs are stunning and all ages will find this text worth exploring at the library.\n\nGet Outside: The Kids Guide to Fun in the Great Outdoors by Jan Drake and Ann Love, illustrated by Heather Collins (Kids Can Press paperback, $17.95) is a seasonal compendium of child-centred activities designed to promote active learning, exercise, and play. Within four main sections each geared to a specific season, young readers will find activities under the following headings: Nature Lover, Outdoor Fun and Games, Snug Inside, and Look to the Sky.\n\nSummer activities for kids include some just for the birds: instructions for a milk carton seed feeder, a nectar feeder, and a fruit feeder. For the latter, hammer a nail into the side of a tree, above eye level, and punch a piece of fruit onto the nail. As the fruit rots, it will collect fruit flies. Some birds will come for the flies, others for the fruit itself. In addition to daytime birds such as northern orioles and warblers at this âfruit and flyâ feeder, the authors recommend checking it at night: âYou may find flying squirrels, luna moths, raccoons, whip-poor-wills and other night-loving creatures helping themselves.â\n\nOutdoor games include rules for 500 Up, Spud, and Shinny. Indoor games present old favourites such as home-made crokinole, dice games, and jacks. A sidebar beside the latter informs readers that jacks are descended from the bone games played by ancient peoples. In the thirteenth century, for example, âduring the Trojan War, the Greek leader Palamedes and his soldiers played a game using knucklebones.â History, fun, and nature combine in this title designed to beat summer boredom.\n\nHighly recommended for ages 4 and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nLucky Lake author Adele Dueck has recently won a Saskatchewan Book Award in the Childrenâs Literature Category for her new juvenile novel Racing Home (Coteau Books paperback; $8.95). Hanley, Saskatchewan in 1908 is an evocative backdrop for this story, foregrounding well-defined characters and a strong, clear plot.\n\nTwelve-year-old Erik wished he could have stayed on his grandfatherâs farm in Norway, where he was closer to his dead father, but instead heâs on the prairies with his mother, his sister, and a stepfather whom he doesnât at first respect. Showing the adeptness of an experienced writer, Dueck plants pieces of the plot like breadcrumbs throughout the text, leaving a careful trail for readers to follow. With a dialogue that includes choice phrases in Norwegian, the story unfolds to tell of a familyâs transition to a place where oxen and sod shacks are common, where breaking the land takes sweat and tears, and where doctors are hard to come byâunless you can ski to town and beg relatives for help.\n\nHow Erik comes to terms with his new life, and a relationship with a half-brother he never knew he had, is the heart of this tale, involving two boys that turn a badly injured horse back into the prize winner he once was. Strong local fare for ages eight to 12.\n\nAlberta author Jacqueline Guest's new novel Outcasts of River Falls (Coteau Books paperback; $9.95) is another fast-paced historical adventure story that explores the lives of members of a MÃ©tis \"Road Allowance\" community in 1901 Alberta. After their loss at Batoche when the MÃ©tis were branded renegades, people were forced to live on land adjacent to the roads and which was owned by the government. This is the fictional story of Kathryn Marie Tourond, a 14-year-old Ontario orphan who comes to live with her Aunt Belle. Kathryn discovers her MÃ©tis roots and the gifts embedded in the culture her father had disowned as well as the challenges--she is banned from attending the local school and despised by a would-be boyfriend when he discovers her heritage.\n\nOne great choice in Kathryn's character development is that she is an avid reader of classical literature and manages to link her reading life to her daily activities. This operates as a device to remind readers of the historical time period of the novel and smartly contextualizes the formal speech patterns of that era. Richly detailed, the novel contains both a strong story and authentic historical facts--a difficult combination for authors to navigate but one that Guest handles very well. Recommended for ages 11 and up.\n\nAnother Alberta author presents quite a different context for racism through historical fiction in free verse form. Cathy Ostlere's Karma (Penguin paperback; $10.50) tells the story of 15-year-old Maya who arrives in India on the eve of Prime Minister Indira Ghandi's assassination and the bloody riot that follows. Born in Canada to a Hindu mother and a Sikh father, Maya--or Jiva, as her father insistently calls her--grows up amidst parental conflict in a small town near Winnipeg. Her mother longs for home, and, after becoming more and more depressed, throws herself into playing classical piano before committing suicide. It is her ashes that Maya and her father are taking to Chandigarh via New Delhi when disaster strikes. Separated from her father, Maya cuts her hair in an act of self-preservation and runs--\"no time to weep. For hair. Or ashes. Or life.\" Traumatized, she ends up on a train, befriended by a young female doctor and her family although for many weeks Maya doesn't speak and isn't able to tell them who she is or where she's from.\n\nMaya's adventures, and the stories of other characters adeptly woven into the plot, are entrancing. Details of city and desert fall in spare, short lines. Like magic, a rich story springs from the condensed text, a tale full of the horror of burned bodies and a young girl growing up at breakneck speed in a world that is not her own and yet a world that is very much a part of her. It's also the tale of a 17-year-old boy named Sandeep who learns to love Maya through the pain of their respective pasts. A captivating read for ages 14 and up.\n\nTimber Wolf, the third in Caroline Pignat's Irish immigrant historical series, follows the adventures of Jack Byrne as he seeks independence in the lumber camps but finds himself injured and in the care of an Aboriginal family (Red Deer paperback; $12.95). Slightly less believable than the other titles in the series, with passages involving a wolf that mysteriously saves Jack's life, the book runs at a fast pace and might be just the title to engage reluctant readers, ages 10 and up, with page-turning adventure sequences.\n\nThe howl wakes me, calls me from one darkness to another. My right eye opens but my left is a throbbing slit. Bare branches. Twilight beyond. Iâm on my back. Outside. Somewhere. Iâm alive. Barely.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nBack to Index\n\nThree new and substantial fantasy novels for young adults offer fare that is intellectually satisfying as well as supremely plot driven, giving readers good reasons to turn the page and then considerable food for thought once the story is complete. References to classical literature abound in all of these titles, subtle reminders that the world is full of words.\n\nMichael Bedardâs young adult novel The Green Man (Tundra hardcover, $19.95) is a captivating read that offers richly drawn characters and a strong, believable setting to offset a fantasy of the highest caliber. In part a sequel to a previous Bedard title A Darker Magic, The Green Man follows Emily's niece, Ophelia, as she battles the next generation of the same dangerous plot.\n\nThe book opens with fifteen-year-old Ophelia going to spend the summer with her bookseller aunt, helping out in The Green Man bookshop while her father is in Italy researching Ezra Pound. Dark forces lurk, and although the real world beckons, with just a hint of romance, the spirit world offers a mix of intrigue not to be ignored.\n\nWithin the intertwined story of Aunt Emily and Ophelia (known as O to ward off the heaviness of Shakespeare) is a tightly pulled thread about poets, and some very fine poetry is included from characters who explore this particular way of interpreting the world. Poetry itself becomes a potential source of evil, with hints about mad poets to warn O from at first publicizing her interest in what has been her auntâs longtime craft. Even Aunt Emily offers caution:\n\nâI need to warn you,â she whispered, as though someone might be listening. âPoetry is nothing to be dabbled in. It can be a dangerous thing. Before you go one step farther, I want you to ask yourself if you absolutely have to do it, if something inside you will die if you donât. If the answer is no, then let it go.â\n\nIt is the darkness that has come three times into Aunt Emilyâs life that has been her muse, deepening her desire to survive, to create, but whether she became a poet out of eccentricity or whether eccentricity evolved from her poetâs lens, we never fully discover. What we do learn is that poetry can bring with it great joy, as O finds out:\n\nWho knew where poems came from? In the end, they were a gift. All you could do was accept it with gratitude and carry it into the light as best you could.\n\nAnother thread that winds its way through this title is related to time, and provides the kind of shimmering tightrope on which the rest of the story balances. In a conversation between O and Aunt Emily, the latter confesses in a belief that makes later events ring true:\n\nâWe live in the midst of mysteries, my dear. They surround us on all sides, and, for the most part, we take no notice of them. Take Time, for instance. What is it? Where does it come from? Where does it go?â\n\nShe leaned forward and took a book from one of the piles on the table. âImagine that this book is that very small piece of reality we call the presentâyou and I, here, now.â She stood it between two tall piles. âThis moment stands between a future that is not yet real and a past that is no longer real.â She placed her hands on top of the piles to either side. âBefore we know it, it too has slid into the past, and another moment has come to take its place.\n\nâBut what if itâs not as simple as that? What if all those past moments still exist, as real as the books on this pile, but hidden from the present moment by a thin fabric, like the painted backdrop in a play? Say that in certain places that fabric were to wear thin and tear, and what lay on the other side were to spill out? Perhaps they would be places where the pressure of the past had grown so great that it could no longer be containedâ¦\n\nHighly recommended for ages 10 and up.\n\nAnother fantastical read is Allan Strattonâs The Grave Robberâs Apprentice (HarperCollins hardcover, $18.99). A high-spirited and complex romp, itâs Strattonâs dexterity with vocabulary and his impeccable comic timing that make this contemporary fairy tale fly.\n\nHans, the foster son of a conniving grave robber, and Angela, a young countess who dreams of the stage, find each other in a desperate journey through dangerous lands and dark woods, Shakespearean themes at every turn. Rather than the high seriousness that imbues some fantasy literature, this title is a rollicking read in which every line seems an attempt to best the previous with ridiculous dialogue.\n\nâHow old are you?â Hans cautiously asks his foster dad.\n\nâOlder than all the hairs in my noseâ¦â says the elder. âBut donât you go changing the subject.â Definitely a response to tuck away for later!\n\nAngela, rousing in her sealed coffin from a potion that feigned her death to avoid a dastardly wedding, thinks fast. âI planned a comedy,â she announces to the darkness. âThat means a happy ending. Do you hear me? A happy ending! I insist on it!â\n\nRecommended for avid readers ages 10 to 14.\n\nThemes in Leah Bobet's first novel Above (Scholastic hardcover, $19.99) push young adult fiction into new territory with a stunning combination of poetic narrative and urban dystopia. The plot revolves around the characters who live in Safe, an underground community open to those rejected by the city Above. Matthew, whose claws and scales can be hidden enough to allow him passage, Ariel, a shapeshifter whose character becomes a metaphor for schizophrenia, and Corner--whose gender ambiguity underpins the initial casting out by a society clearly organized around exclusion while at the same time supporting medical experiments that actually create more 'misfits.'\n\nWith a surprisingly uplifting first-person voice, Matthew narrates the fast-paced tale with poise and consistency--his insights speaking to the power of the human spirit and the necessity of stories that remind us of who we are and who we might become.\n\nMy last supply duty before Sanctuary Night, I get home and Atticus is waiting.\n\nIt's half past three already, and nobody awake except for Hide and Mack and Mercy and me, unloading our week's ration of scuffed-up bottles and tins into the broad-wide kitchen cabinets. Most supply nights that's all there is to it: the swish and thunk of stacking tins, the slow quiet of faucets stopping, piles sleeping, water mains humming lower as the city Above goes to bed. The air moves slower with everyone laid asleep; gets dustier, goes back to earth. There's a light by the kitchen, run off a wire down off the old subway tracks, and the rest is feel-your-way dark until morning, when Jack Flash lights the lamps with a flick of his littlest finger.\n\nJack's got a good Curse. He might have made it Above if not for the sparks always jumping out of things to kiss at his knuckles. Me, the only thing good 'bout my Curse is that I can still Pass. And that's half enough to keep me out of trouble.\n\nSome contemporary novels deal with diversity themes with respect to disability, other novels address gender and sexual orientation, while still others include a focus on cultural differences. It is rare to find combinations of any of these themes, and for this reason Above is a striking reminder that difference comes in multiples. It's a gritty book, intended for mature teens, reminiscent of other books for this age group that push the envelope including M.T. Anderson's remarkable science fiction title Feed, and Born Ugly by Beth Goobie.\n\nBack to Index\n\nSaskatoon author Dianne Young has a new picture book sure to please vocabulary afficionados young and old. Dear Flyary (Kids Can Press hardcover, $18.95), delightfully illustrated by John Martz, presents the journal of a one-eyed alien recounting his flying adventures in a âDear Diaryâ format. Whatâs so unique about this text is that many of the words cannot be found in any dictionary because they havenât been inventedâ¦yet!\n\nDear Flyary,\n\nYou wonât believe what happened this after-waker! I was on my way home from the factory when my little red spaceship started making another strange noise! The noise was a bit louder than the last oneâI could hear it with just three of my earsâ¦\n\nA treat for the imagination, packed with giggles, and a work-out for building contextual reading strategies, this book is highly recommended for ages 4 and up.\n\nAnother picture book, published just in time for Easter, is Rachel Vailâs Piggy Bunny (Feiwel & Friends, hardcover, $16.99), a well-told story about a piglet with an identity crisis. Although family and friends attempt to divert him from his goal of becoming the Easter Bunny, thanks to an internet-savvy grandma, a costumed Liam has the confidence to believe in his transformation. A subtle message about respect for diversity and personal goals underpins this lovely read, cheerfully illustrated by Jeremy (Grumpy Bird) Tankard. Highly recommended for ages 3 â 7.\n\nDiana Kolpakâs Starfall (Red Deer Press hardcover, $19.95) tell the story of a lonely clown out to find the stars, without which the world has endless winter. Striking photographs by Kathleen Finlay accompany the story in restricted colour choicesâa visual treat and one that makes this book interesting to older readers as well as ages 7 â 9 for whom the storyline will appeal.\n\nCarolyn Beckâs Dog Breath (Fitzhenry & Whiteside hardcover, $18.95) is a rambunctious eulogy for a beloved pet. Zany illustrations by Brooke Kerrigan bring humour into a senstive and heartwarming tale for ages 5 - 8. Highly recommended as a companion read for Judith Viorstâs classic tribute to a family cat: The Tenth Good Thing About Barney.\n\nFranÃ§ois Thisdaleâs Nini (Tundra hardcover, $17.99) relates the story of an infant who was very much wanted by her biological family, then cared for in an orphanage, then adopted to the other side of the world. Intended for ages 6 and up, Thisdaleâs multi-textured images are richly evocative.\n\nSome days, the child hears a distant echo. She thinks of rice paddies, of lotus flowers in the wind, or a little house with a pointed roof. Sometimes, just before she sleeps, she whispers to the moon that she is happy.\n\nIn their girlâs wise eyes, her mother and father see the past joined with the present, like a bridge that connects one place to another.\n\nJust like the roots in a garden weave together to become one plant, the mother, father, and little girl are bound to one another. Their love joins them and reaches to the other side of the earthâ¦And they thank a distant echo that travels on the night breeze for allowing them to become a family.\n\nBack to Index\n\nThree books for young adults push the boundaries of traditional content and form: Random, by Lesley Choyce, Red Power, by Brian Wright-McLeod, and Yellow Mini by Lori Weber.\n\nChoyceâs Random (Red Deer Press paperback, $12.95) follows a sixteen-year-old protagonist who strives to make sense of life through the lenses of various theories he encounters at school and at home. Joe Campbell is the epitome of a âthinking manâ and he introduces readers to snippets of nihilism as well as ideas from Einstein, Malthus, Bachofen and Aristotole, among others, all the while asking himself the age-old question: Is life random?\n\nMuch of what is published these days in popular series fiction for teens seems well trenched in the general listening and speaking vocabularies of readers without including anything new or provocative. What makes Random unique is that it has at its helm a smart protagonist who takes charge of a discovery of universal interest to us allâthe meaning of life. This is an edgy read, with language authentic to the age group represented and the direct first-person voice of Joe continually posing questions and reeling us back to the issues at hand.\n\nDid you ever think about the word âDilemma?â I discovered that the true meaning of the word is a problem with two unpleasant solutions. This means you get in a screwed-up situation and you have two choices for finding a way out. Neither one is good but you do have to choose one. Whichever one you pick, somebody or something pays. They use the phrase that you are on âthe horns of a dilemma.â Makes it sound like an animalâa bull or a moose, maybe.\n\nI think a lot of life is like that. You have to choose. You have no choice. But itâs not always easy and you pay.\n\nThe journey Joe initiates, exorcising his own feelings of responsibility regarding the untimely death of his biological parents, is not a new plotline in fiction for young people. What is refreshing about this read is just how Joe accomplishes his destination.\n\nWright-McLeodâs Red Power (Fifth House paperback, $9.95) is a graphic novel blend of dream world and reality inspired by the land struggle at Big Mountain, Arizona, where 10 000 traditional Navajo people won a relocation battle with the government. Wright-McLeod (Dakota-Anishinabe) is a journalist with specialities in music and graphic design.\n\nAs with other graphic novels, at first glance the illustrations may mask the adult nature of this text. The black-and-white sketches are fiercely evocative and extend a strong story whose conversational tone is both intriguing and engaging.\n\nTo bury a memory, one has to dig deep into the heart of the Earth. Things changed very quickly in a place where not long ago, herds of moose and deer were so large that it took a day for them to travel past a given point.\n\nBirds were so plentiful that their passing overhead blocked out the sun for hours. Trees were so bountiful that a squirrel could travel from the coast to the great inland waters without ever touching the ground.\n\nAnd the people in this new time are taught that all bad things happened in the past. People in this new time are taught that the indigenous people should be thankful for all that has been given to them. I love irony, donât you?\n\nWhile aimed at young adult audiences, this graphic novel will find a crossover home with adult audiences interested in a quick but gripping read on this subject.\n\nWeberâs Yellow Mini (Fitzhenry & Whiteside paperback, $9.95) includes the stories of five teens in separate yet delicately intertwining âchaptersâ of free verse. We meet Mark, reeling from the death of his father, and Stacey, using her relationship with Mark to establish her own popularity. Mary, a budding concert pianist, and Annabelle, an activist for social justice alongside adoring Christopher, complete the list of key characters.\n\nThis book is deceptively simple, an easy read with depths to plumb, invoking characters whose stories weave in and out with complex precision.\n\nBeginning with Annabelleâs story in âThe Third Floorâ, each distilled narrative is full of power and promise.\n\nIf I have to go to the library, I take the second floor\n\nas far as it will go, then climb\n\nthe stairs and double\n\nback, just to avoid\n\nthe third floor\n\nlounge.\n\nIf I really canât avoid it, I hold my head so high I get a kink\n\nin my neck, and I try not to look anyone straight\n\nin the eyes, because if they know youâre\n\nlooking they flaunt it, their\n\npopularity, pull it out\n\nof tight tops like a\n\nmagicianâs scarf\n\nand fling it,\n\nlaughing,\n\nin your\n\nface.\n\nYellow Mini succinctly draws to the fore particular and resonant stories of adolescence to which many teens will easily relate.\n\nAll three titles are highly recommended for mature readers ages 14 and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\n40 Things I Want to Tell You (HarperCollins paperback, $14.99) is a new young adult novel by Saskatoon author Alice Kuipers. Her previous titles, also intended for older teens, are Life on the Refrigerator Door (a crossover from adult audiences) and The Worst Thing She Ever Did.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Amy Finch (a.k.a. Bird) is dissatisfied in her long term relationship with Griffin, the boy next door. Birdâs physical fling with Pete, a consummate bad boy, is the catalyst for change, but what ensues is both a cautionary tale and a gripping read in order to find out what happens next.\n\nWhen I was eight years old, I climbed up a tree and told my mum I was a bird. Before she could stop me, the leaves dancing in the breeze, Iâd balanced at the edge of one branch and looked into the blue tempting sky. My mum had screamed at me, âNo, Amy, stop.â\n\nâIâm a bird,â I cried, and flew.\n\nThat was how I broke my leg.\n\nNow, in the park, with huge effort, I pushed Pete away...This was too risky...\n\nKuipers has a gift for plotting her work so that readers can see whatâs coming before the characters themselves even recognize whatâs going on. This allows deep engagement with the text and will hook even reluctant readers in turning the pages to verify their predictions. But whether or not Bird will keep her baby isnât something anyone can guess until the last few pages where, in a clever twist, we realize that the storyâs title, and the messages therein, are actually intended for Birdâs son.\n\nLondon born Kuipers, while setting much of her work in England, manages to transcend time and place in a story without geographical reading boundaries. Interested in writing? See Kuipersâ blog for writing tips: here.\n\nWhile Kuipers was born in London and now writes in Canada, author Trilby Kent has moved the other way from a birthplace in Toronto to her current residence in London. Kentâs newest novel Stones for my Father (Tundra hardcover, $21.99) is remarkable in its focus on the Boer War through the eyes of young Corlie Roux. Yet while the historical details in the book are authentic, it is the difficult relationship between Corlie and her mother that make this book so riveting.\n\nMy mother never called me anything but Corlie. If she used my fill name, Coraline Roux, I knew that it was time to make myself scarce by hiding in the cattle sheds.\n\nSheâd used my full name the morning I dropped a jar of peaches in the kitchen. The impact sent juice splashing across the slate tiles and a million shards of glass cartwheeling about the floor. When my mother bent to salvage some of the preserved fruit, she must have cut a finger with a piece of glass because immediately she shot upright with a gasped âGodverdomme!â and cuffed me sharply about the ear.\n\nWith the death of her fatherâthe only parent who shows her any loveâ and the invasion of the British, Corlieâs world is shattered. Families who do not surrender escape to hidden laagers in the bush, but eventually Corlieâs laager is discovered, and she and the others are sent to an internment camp. Her strength and knowledge of the land can help her, but is she strong enough to survive starvation, disease, and loss? This is the question that drives the latter half of the book. Compelling reading for ages 11 and up.\n\nAmerican author Jennifer Nielsen has begun a new trilogy with The False Prince (Scholastic paperback, $16.99). Fourteen-year-old Sage is purchased from an orphanage by a mysterious stranger. Before long, he and a couple of other young âcandidatesâ are bounced along in a wagon towards a potential rags to riches ending. Master Conner, a nobleman of the court, will first train and then choose one of them to masquerade as the missing prince now heir to the throneâwith the opportunity for Conner himself to rule from the sidelines. The only problem is, while one of these boys will âwinâ the honour to be crowned as king, the others must die.\n\nWith a plotline reminiscent of Suzanne Collinsâ Hunger Games trilogy in the manner in which the three candidates are pitted against one another, and a delightfully humorous first-person narrative account by âSageâ himself, this will be a popular title for ages 10 and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nKathleen McDonnellâs new title Emily Included (Second Story Press, paperback, $8.95) is an authentic version of the true story of Emily Eatonâan Ontario girl with cerebral palsy who won the right to attend her neighbourhood school. In 1995, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled against local courts and school boards who wanted Emily in a segregated school setting, ending a three-year battle waged by Emilyâs family and setting a strong precedent in favour of inclusionary education.\n\nEmilyâs father, in McConnellâs fictionalized version of events, spoke to the Special Education Tribunal who had agreed with the local school board in stating that Emilyâs interests were best served in a congregated setting for students with disabilities. Clayton Eatonâs summary of his familyâs desire to keep Emily in her neighbourhood school will resonate with many people who support inclusion wherever possible: âOur community includes Emilyâs neighbourhood school,â Clayton said. âAnd the people who live in our community, the children that she will grow up with and who will be part of her community when sheâs an adult, go to that school. They need to get to know Emily now. We canât bring her back at the end of her school career and plug her into that community. She has to be there now, so she can grow up with those children and those children can grow up with her.â\n\nThe Tribunal, however, were not swayed, and Emilyâs family were forced to take their battle to the Divisional Court of Ontario, and then after this court had ruled against them, to the Ontario Court of Appeal, who eventually ruled that denying Emily an education in a regular class violated her equality rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This decision was appealed, but upheld by the Supreme Court of Canadaâthe final step in the familyâs fight for Emily.\n\nThis is a book that explores Canadian history related to the school inclusion of children with special needs, and covers a great deal of territory with a sensitive and sure hand. Recommended for educators as well as children ages 8 â 11.\n\nNapatsi Folgerâs first novel Joy of Apex (Inhabit Media, paperback, $9.95) is a story with a setting unusual in published fiction for children: Apex, Nunavut. This suburb of Iqaluit offers an evocative backdrop for a story of family break-up from the perspective of ten-year-old Joy.\n\nJoy and her brother and sister beg their father for a release from after-supper dishes in order to play outside. Reluctantly, he gives in, and out they fly. âItâs dusk, and the low, orange sun highlights the fall colours of the tundra. Brilliant yellows, reds, and browns, like fall trees and leaves in the south, cover all of the land. Creeping on the ground are mosses, lichens, and low bushes. Everything is earthy-coloured, except for the bay, which is a mirror image of the glowing pink and purple sky.\n\nâThe fall tundra always reminds me of my aunt and uncleâs soft shag carpet from the 1970s, except for the smell. Their old basement carpet smells like mold and mothballs, but the tundra smells like rich, dark soil and sweet moss. I find it intoxicating, but itâs almost gone. Winter will soon replace that smell with sharp, frozen air that stings my nose. Everyone can feel the tension in the air as all of us are trying to squeeze in as much fun out of the last few days of summer vacation...â\n\nFolger is careful at letting the story go first, working in sensory reminiscences from her own childhood in Iqaluit without creating a setting that outweighs plot or character. For a first-time writer, this is a true gift, and readers can look forward to hearing more from this twenty-eight-year-old University of Toronto student.\n\nRecommended for ages 9 â 12.\n\nPrince Albert author and illustrator Leah Marie Dorion has a new 2011 picture book: Relatives with Roots: A Story About MÃ©tis Womenâs Connection to the Land (Lii Peraantii avik la Rasin: EÃ± Nistwaar Taanishi lii Faam di Michif Eâishi Kisheyitakik li TayraeÃ±). With a complete translation into Michif-Cree by Rita Flamand, this title is published by Saskatoonâs Gabriel Dumont Institute (paperback, $12.95).\n\nDorion describes her art as a âspiritual expression. My work is intended to be multisensory. The paintings are tactile and many times the paint is applied with my own fingers in order to help me connect on a deeper physical level. I often use other tools that help add dimension and depth...I play with light, colour value, texture, and movement. This is accomplished by colour choice and beadwork, composition to create movement. I honour the traditional art forms of my women ancestors, but I bring them into a contemporary formâ (www.leahdorion.com).\n\nThis beautifully rendered picture book tells the story of a MÃ©tis grandmother taking her granddaughter out into the bush to pick traditional plants for healing. The teaching of cultural knowledge offers a rich backdrop to a story about relationships.\n\nâGrandma said, âMy girl, as you smudge with this medicine, clear your mind and focus on good thoughts so that we can be more open to the wisdom that our relatives with roots will share with us today.ââ The Michif-Cree translation under each passage elevates the audience of this book to anyone with a passion for bi-lingual literature, and a CD is provided to orally present the text in both languages.\n\nRecommended for ages 6 and up.\n\nWilfred Burton and Anne Pattonâs 2011 title Call of the Fiddle (Li Vyayloon ka Taypwatikooyen), also published by the Gabriel Dumont Institute (paperback, $12.95) is another intergenerational family story for ages 6 and up. Nolin and his mother and grandfather enjoy the celebrations at âBack to Batoche,â an event put on by the MÃ©tis Society of Saskatchewan. One thing leads to another and soon Nolin is participating in the jigging competition, making his family proud. This annual event isnât only about family fun, however. Itâs also a time to remember relatives who gave their lives during the Riel Resistance, and Nolin listens respectfully while Moushoom honours the dead. A brief historical endnote offers for interested readers more facts about the 1885 Northwest Resistance.\n\nWith Michif-Cree translation by Norman Fleury, and vivid illustrations by Sherry Farrell Racette, this book is even richer for the CD of traditional fiddle music that is included along with readings of the text.\n\nBack to Index\n\nBrenna Book Reviews, 2011\n\nSome unusual forms, formats, and perspectives appear in contemporary books for children, and none contain more intrigue than Brian Selznickâs Wonderstruck (Scholastic hardcover, $29.99). A follow-up to his Caldecott Award-winning title The Invention of Hugo Cabret, this new historical-fiction read offers two concurrent stories set fifty years apartâone narrated in words and the other depicted through pictures.\n\nBen and Rose each set out on a journey inspired by different pasts. After the death of his mother, Benârecently deafened by lightningâ seeks the father he has never known. Roseâalso deafâ dreams of a mysterious actress with whose life she is obsessed, although readers soon see a surprising connection between Rose and Lillian Mayhew.\n\nHow Ben and Roseâs stories unfold and eventually intertwine is complex and beautifulâa tale told by a master artist. Selznickâs research is sound, his text rich with historical details that add layers of meaning to a captivating plotline. In addition, the deaf protagonists offer perspectives rarely shown in childrenâs literature and this title adds to a list of contemporary titles that include previously unheard voices. Highly recommended for ages 9 and up.\n\nThe Batman Files by Matthew K. Manning (Andrews McMeel Publishing, $100.00) is a rich scrapbook-style collection of supposed artefacts âfoundâ by its author and compiled here. Billed as revealing the entire history and evolution of Batman, from the early days of his life (comic-style baby pictures and all) to newspaper clippings depicting his exploits and triumphs, this will certainly find favour with connoisseurs of the cartoon. While its audience will be limited due to the scrapbookâs non-sequential style and sections ending with âto be continuedâ âwhere only readers familiar with the stories will fill in the gapsâit does fill a particular niche. Recommended for Batman aficionados ages 12 and up.\n\nFor younger superhero fans, The Astonishing Secret of Awesome Man (HarperCollins hardcover, $19.99) might fit the bill. With text by Michel Chabon and illustrations by Jake Parker, the picture bookâs storyline is simple.\n\nI take off after the Flaming Eyeball...I fly west. I fly east. I fly eight times around the earth and all the way to the heart of the sun...Then I see him!...I throw an Awesome Power Grip...kick a little bad-guy behind...Then I make a quick getaway...\n\nAmidst his busy schedule, Awesome Man has a secret identity...and one with which all young readers might identify. When he finally returns to the âFortress of Awesome,â guess whoâs waiting for him? His mom, a little sister, and a plate of plain old cheddar cheese and crackers. What makes this title different within the comics genre is the age of its intended audience as well as a moral message about safe fantasy play. Recommended for ages 4 to 8.\n\nBack to Index\n\nWhile many publishersâ websites currently express disinterest in kidsâ manuscripts that involve talking animals, judging from the new childrenâs texts available anthropomorphism is clearly alive and well in childrenâs literature.\n\nOur beloved space cat is back in Saskatoon author Ashley Spiresâ third graphic instalment Binky Under Pressure (Kids Can Press hardcover, $16.95). Rich vocabulary, clever illustrations that enrich plot and character, and trademark tongue-in-cheek humour make this a highly recommended title for ages 7 to 10.\n\nIbi Kaslikâs retelling of Inuit stories in Tales from the Tundra (Inhabit Media hardcover, $12.95) will find favour with readers interested in exploring pourquoi talesâfictional narratives that explain why something is the way it is. Anthony Brennanâs Manga-inspired illustrations accompany explanations that include attention to the plumage of the loon and the raven, and how the caribou and walrus came to be. The collection is rather uneven, with other styles of tales in the mix, and the absence of detailed source notes is a weakness, especially as the author and illustrator are not from inside the culture. The Inuit-owned publishing company in Nunavut (www.inhabitmedia.com) is geared towards promoting and preserving the stories and knowledge of northern Canada and this title does help fill a gap in available literature that represents this area of the world. Recommended for ages 7 to 10.\n\nRoslyn Schwartz, highly acclaimed author of The Mole Sisters series, now brings us a companion read in The Vole Brothers (Raincoast Books hardcover, $16.95). With simple, playful text and evocative illustrations that encourage visual literacy, this highly recommended title is aimed at emergent readers ages 4 â 7.\n\nVirginia Frances Schwartz (no relation to Roslyn!) adds to her prolific publishing history with Nutz! (Tradewind Books paperback, $12.95) a graphic chapter book about the relationship between a cat (the storyâs narrator) and a squirrel. Virginia came from a family who rescued animals, and really did have a squirrel in the house...and a big toilet-trained cat who was very jealous...and a boxer dog next door who captured the squirrel in the first place...and a brother who hypnotized chickens. Highly recommended for ages 8 to 11.\n\nA contemporary blend of fiction and non-fiction can be found in Sean Cassidyâs Kazaak! (Fitzhenry & Whiteside hardcover, $18.95). A clever narrative following a day in the life of Spike and Rupert, two young porcupines, embeds facts about porcupine habits into a text absolutely prickling with child-friendly illustrations and humorous dialogue. Highly recommended for ages 4 to 7.\n\nBarbara Wersbaâs Walter: The Story of a Rat (Fitzhenry & Whiteside paperback, $9.95) is a gentle story about a writer and a reader. Prolific Miss Pomeroy and Walter the rat have never met but they discover one another through a series of letters. A rodent similar in intellect to Despereaux in Kate Di Camilloâs award winning novel, Walter would have cringed at the comparison, for he was sensitive to Miss Pomeroyâs favouritism towards mice in her published work.\n\nAnd not only was Bromberg a mouse, everyone else in the stories were mice as well.\n\nMice detectives and mice spies. Mice villains and mice heroes. Elderly mice, who were always in some kind of danger. Rich female mice, kidnapped and held for ransom.\n\nWalter sat on Miss Pomeroyâs ladder studying these books, and he did not know whether to laugh or cry. He felt betrayedâfor why had Miss Pomeroy chosen to write about mice when she could just as easily have chosen rats? How could she not have known that rats are more interesting than mice, more intelligent, and more adaptable? To put it bluntly, how could she not have known that rats are more magnificent?\n\nDelightful as the narrative is, the heart of this book beats within the letters exchanged between Walter and Miss Pomeroy, epistles through which readers will see clearly see a poignant and developing friendship. âMy name is Walter. I live here too,â the letters begin. âI know,â is Miss Pomeroyâs acerbic reply.\n\nDear Miss Pomeroy, Thank you for writing me. Your letter was short, but I loved it. My name, as I said before, is Walter, and my Latin name is Rattus norvegicus. I have lived here for six months and have no friends. No relatives, either. I am reading all of your books and hope you donât mind. I always return them to their places. Sincerely, Walter (named after Sir Walter Scott).\n\nDear Walter: I am not exactly a fool. I saw you the very day you moved in, six months ago. I know where your nest is, and I know you steal food from my kitchen. My Latin name is Homo sapiens, and I am well aware that you are reading my books. You presume a great deal! On the other hand, you are not unwelcome here. Amanda Pomeroy.\n\nWalter: The Story of a Rat is very highly recommended as shared reading with ages 6 and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nA handful of new books offer a diverse look at a context familiar to most young readers: school.\n\nSusan Glickmanâs junior novel Bernadette in the Doghouse (Second Story Press paperback, $8.95) follows a group of friends called the Lunch Bunch as they help an elderly lady with yard clean-up, celebrate Christmas and Chanukah, and navigate growing pains. While much of the narrative is very readable kidsâ stuff, a plotline that involves a clique of four girls disbanding and then getting back together seems too shallow to reflect contemporary times. Isnât there anyone else in that lunchroom who needs a friend? Glickman is clearly adept at narrative in this second title in her Lunch bunch series; now itâs time for a little more depth. For ages 7 â 9.\n\nSusan Hughesâ Off to Class: Incredible and Unusual Schools Around the World (Owl paperback, $13.95) is an exploration of creative ways that schooling is offered in unusual circumstances. From unsinkable schools to online schools and street schools, each learning landscape in this book invites comparison. Many first-person descriptions by students are included, increasing the resonance of this project. Rich with photographs and designed to be reader-friendly with short sections of text and colourful sidebars, this title is highly recommended for ages 9 â 13.\n\nKenneth Oppelâs The Dark Endeavour: The Apprenticeship of Victor Frankenstein (HarperCollins hardcover, $19.99) follows a steady stream of award-winning Oppel titles. Its purposeâthe unfolding of a story about the childhood experiences of Mary Shelleyâs Dr. Frankensteinâis challenging as a gothic prelude to the classic novel and one that many readers will find intriguing.\n\nVictor Frankenstein, his twin brother Konrad, and their beautiful cousin Elizabeth take their lessons at home from Father, filling their spare time with fencing and horseback riding. The discovery of a secret room filled with forbidden knowledge becomes a catalyst for Victorâs descent into an independent study of dangerous alchemy in order to discover a cure for Konrad, who has become deathly ill.\n\nParallels with the original classic text include a metaphor of science as a monster, and a theory about the importance of schooling and the negative result of self-education through books. This titleâs categorization as a young adult novel matches the complexity of the storyâs organization and content (Victor donates two fingers to his precious elixir) and the inclusion of a love triangle between Victor, Konrad, and Elizabeth. Victorâs dispassionate tone, cleverly matching the original, is balanced with a healthy dose of humour, which makes the narrative more palatable to contemporary readers.\n\nâI imbibed your bone marrow?â Konrad asked.\n\nâIt was very nearly imbibed by Polidori,â said Henry.\n\nKonrad sat up straighter. I looked from Henry to Elizabeth, then to mother. I had not wanted the alchemistâs name to be mentioned so soon.\n\nâJulius Polidori is involved in this?â Mother asked.\n\nâHe helped us translate the recipe,â I replied.\n\nâHe hacked off your fingers?â she shouted.\n\nâThat was part of the recipe. I offered them willingly. But he turned scoundrel and meant to take the elixir for himself.â\n\nâWe had quite a tussle to get it back,â said Henry. âHe set his lynx on us.â\n\nHighly recommended for ages 12 and up. The movie rights have already been sold.\n\nDrummer Girl by Alberta author Karen Bass (Coteau paperback, $14.95) is a young adult title set in contemporary times. A proposition from another girl sets Sidâs teeth on edgeâand along with it come comments from classmates designed to elicit a confession about her sexuality. Wes Remichuk, star basketball player, says to her in class: â...I can see why you dumped her. Next time go for someone at least a little cool.â His gaze flicked down and back up. âNot that youâre much better. Raving dyke.â\n\nSid poked him in the chest. âI am not.â\n\nâRight. Like you werenât just ogling Maria along with the rest of us.â\n\nAll Devinâs lessons on how to take down an enemy rushed into Sidâs mind. She clenched her fist but resisted the urge to plow Wes. âCommenting on the obvious isnât ogling.â\n\nWes sneered. âYour friends might be too afraid to say anythingâever notice all your friends are guys? âbut youâre so butch it hurts. Admit it. Confessionâs supposed to be good for the soul.â\n\nThe desire to be invited into a cool band inspires Sid to dress the partâin addition to a hope that new clothes will emphasize her straight sexual orientation. Events catapult towards a sexual assault, and a video that goes viral, offering a conclusion somewhat didactic in the manner that various threads are pulled together, yet satisfying nonetheless.\n\nStrong prose that invites contemplation; recommended for ages 13 and up.\n\nBack to Index\n\nManitoba author Craig Russellâs teen fiction Black Bottle Man: A Fable (Great Plains paperback, $14.95) is a riveting read. Highly charged storytelling supports the tale of a man caught since the age of ten in a bargain his family made with the devil.\n\nThis Sally Anne dormitory stinks, but Rembrandt is used to the reek of unwashed bodies. In homeless shelters across Canada and the U.S. he has inhaled the musk of men who stumble through life, the sour odour of women too shattered to care. And before there were such things as homeless shelters, heâd shared countless shanties with hobos and migrant workers from Texas to Alaska.\n\nFor eighty long years, Rembrandt has been on the move. But he is not like the others in this cot-filled hall. Heâs not a drunk, nor an addict, nor currently, a mad-man. Nevertheless, he moves on every twelve days. Sometimes sooner if a place offers too much of its own trouble. But he never stays longer than the twelve.\n\nLike an Eleventh Commandment, âThe Pactâ has fixed that unrelenting time limit. It is part of a bargain that has ruled and ruined his family for four score years, a covenant forged from family pride and maternal desire. As unforgiving as an iron rod laid upon his shoulders, a burden at first shared with his pa and Uncle Thompson, but now carried onward by him alone.\n\nRembrandtâs quest is to find a champion, someone who can fight the devil and win, but now, at ninety years of age, he has only thirty days more until the devilâs final triumph.\n\nThe story of our hero intertwines with the poignant sketch of a young teacher who, in keeping her students late, put them at the mercy of a gunman. Gail has spent most of her days since then on the streetsâunable to forgive herself at the knowledge that four children were shot, one fatally. How she transforms into someone Rembrandt has been lookin"
