        "text": "Though it was published in 1999, Stephen Chbosky’s The Perks of Being a Wallflower has become a cult YA classic in recent years. It chronicles the life of 15-year-old Charlie, whose introduction to the world of high school doesn’t go quite as planned. While Charlie’s life is similar to those of many freshman students—from new crushes to light experimentation with drugs, alcohol, and sex—it’s also marked by suppressed trauma and mental illness. Altogether, Charlie’s experiences form a complex, honest portrait of the ups and downs that can come with leaving our childhoods behind.\n\nLoved the novel and movie, but want more touching coming-of-age stories? Here’s a list of books like The Perks of Being a Wallflower that share similar themes of friendship, love, and growing up."
