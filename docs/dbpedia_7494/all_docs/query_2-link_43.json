        "text": "Considering the wide scope of Young Adult Literatures (YAL) from religion, mythology, science, fantasy, even to terrorism, it is time to apply these theories to legitimize a recognized place for YAL. We can reflect on its language, its representations, its mediating link between text and society, and other discursive critical thoughts and practices. And our reservations about it should be replaced with a range of questions: How are YA represented in YAL? What role do YA play in the plot construction of the novel? Are the young culture(s) represented in the fiction consistent with YA? How do the literary depiction of ‘age’ and ‘youth’ enable us to understand the Generation Y? How can we characterize YA writing as a genre? And finally, how YAL can help us in understanding perceptions of caste, class, gender, race, and disability.\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and queer (LGBTQ) young adult (YA) literature is increasing in popularity, with novels like Bil Wright’s Putting Makeup on the Fat Boy winning the two LGBTQ YA honors—the Lambda Literary and Stonewall Book Awards—as well awards commending their cultural diversity. Despite the upsurge of celebrated LGBTQ YA literature, a study of the protagonists in Lambda- and Stonewall-winning YA novels from 2000–2013 reveals three findings: the dominance of White, gay, male characters contradicts the trend toward strong female protagonists in mainstream YA; stories about lesbians are primarily tragic; and there are no bisexual protagonists.\n\nPages 35-43 of _InLand_ reveals for teachers that they needn't worry that using comics and graphic novels keeps them from addressing important standards. This truth holds true when using the IRA/NCTE standards from 1996 or the inferior Common Core State Standards, which were just starting to gain traction in 2011. Brian Kelley coauthors with Carter and Monnin."
