        "text": "Chapter 1\n\nStill Checked Out\n\nYA Heroines We’ll Never Return\n\nMom…Can Sally J. Sleep Over?\n\nIf you ask me, it is truly a symbol of the great injustice of life as we know it today that the only girl heroine’s name that can truly be said to have entered the vernacular is Pollyanna. (I mean, have you even read Pollyanna? I may have made it through about 10 minutes of the movie—that is, if I’m not confusing it with Heidi.) It’s an even greater injustice that the appellative, of course, is a pejorative. It’s not only that, out of the 9,000 exciting heroines you could mention, our language reflects only one. It’s that the one character elected for immortality, the linguistic ambassador for young women in the world, is a prating goody-goody who spreads her good cheer with the relentless force of a Caterpillar.\n\nIf I had my way, we would add some other options to the mix. What, for example, about being a Ramona? (Inquisitive, inspired, unaccountably amusing.) A Meg? (Stubborn, brainy, admirably self-questioning.) A Claudia! (Exquisitely tasteful, stylized, demanding—the Michael Kors of the under–12 set.) A Wifey! (Sorry, wrong chapter.) A Margaret! (Still Chapter Two.)\n\nBut you get my point. Just as there are certain books we drag with us to bed year after year like a beloved, worn blanket, there are certain heroines we find continually in circulation, like especially festive members of a slumber-party circuit. (Ramona! Are you putting toothpaste in the sink again?)\n\nAnd why do they continue to receive our coveted Saturday-night invitations? Well, first, they are marvelously fun to be around. (See above: Toothpaste.) They also teach us new things, like what an Automat is, or what’s a charming, off-the-beaten-track place you might want to consider when you next run away. (Here’s a hint: Admission is only what you can give!) They remind us of ourselves—Meg’s glumness over her awkward stage comes to mind—even as they perform galactic feats of travel that challenge our 8-year-old grasp of algebra. (You had me at square the square.) They have annoying brothers, worried mothers, and affectionate fathers—even doting bubehs—and while they see themselves in the mirror, we can see ourselves in their Margaret O’Brien coronet.\n\nAnd they challenge us, like the best of friends, in general—not only to be ourselves, but to be more interesting, inspired versions of ourselves, girls unafraid to squeeze toothpaste, sleep on a Louis XIV bed or keep important tabs on all the neighbors, even if they’re not afraid they’re Hitler. (Yes, Sally—but you didn’t think I’d forget Harriet, did you?) In search of their constant company, I’m sure the nerdier among us will be happy to cop to the occasional commemorative costume, poem, or diorama or website. This is nonsense; we owe our best friends a durable immortality. Next stop: Let’s get them into the lexicon.\n\nBOOK REPORT\n\nA Wrinkle in Time\n\nBy Madeleine L’Engle 1962\n\nThe Great Brain\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night.\n\nIf I had my way, none of us would have to read this essay at all. Instead, we’d join hands, hear a great thunderclap, and be whisked off to a rambling house in the country, where we’d view odd things bubbling in a lab with a stone floor, consume hot cocoa, jam on bread, and liverwurst-and-cream-cheese sandwiches at the kitchen table while swinging our legs, and then sidestep for a moment onto a planet inhabited by gentle gray creatures with dents for eyes. We would be inserted into some mitochondria, battle for the soul of Madoc/Maddox, and eat crayfish with our lesbian kind-of aunt who insisted on calling us our full name (Polyhymnia). We’d hop on a freighter and solve a mystery, then go to boarding school in Switzerland. We would make a brief detour on the Upper West Side and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine by way of Portugal, and be concerned with cell regeneration in starfish. We’d be smacked on the ass by a dolphin. We’d try to answer the questions of God, sex, and the galaxy, and if the principal ever tried to get us to come back to school, why, we’d drag him along with us, too.\n\nGod, how much it kills me that we can’t do those things! (Especially the dolphin part.) But, as A Wrinkle in Time’s opaque Mrs. Who would have us recall, Dante said, Come t’e picciol fallow amaro morso. (What grievous pain a little fault doth give thee!) Alas, it will have to be enough for us to spend a bit of time in the company of a most short-fused, half-cocked, bespectacled literary heroine—Meg Murry, the first heroine to endear herself to the reader by way of atom rearrangement.\n\nMeg Murry—brilliant at math, poor at geography, eschewing rumination for action—is the first in a line of L’Engle heroines who flit across the boundaries of space and time, even more flummoxed by adolescence than they are by being whip-sawed across the universe. (Which they are, generally, just to complicate things, in the process of saving.) In A Wrinkle in Time, Meg, joined by her neighbor Calvin O’Keefe and her quietly remarkable younger brother Charles Wallace, hop-stops her way through a number of only occasionally hospitable galaxies, searching for her father in the shadow of the Dark Thing, the shadow of evil threatening to overtake Earth, and all of creation.\n\nAnd that’s it for those of you who haven’t read the book. (Just stab me in the eye; it’s less painful.) For the rest, first off, I am embarrassed to say that, swooning over memories of red-tinged Sloppy Joe brains and calm, fragrant creatures with dents for eyes (Aunt Beast!), I had entirely forgotten that, when we first come across the studious, brilliant Murry family, they—and Meg in particular—are in somewhat of a crisis. Their father has been missing for some months, a fact that the town’s citizens are only too happy to snidely snicker over. Long scorned for their elite, egghead predilections (Dr. Murry, a physicist, is an advisor to the president) the Murry family is finally in a position where the town can feel superior to them.\n\nMeg has responded to this with admirable intemperance—namely, slugging a boy who’s just called Charles Wallace her dumb baby brother. Charles Wallace, of course, is anything but—he’s a polymath whose exquisite intellect also makes him highly attuned to those around him, particularly Meg, whose fury Charles Wallace sympathizes with, but only because he knows it hurts Meg more than anyone else. This is more than we can say for Mr. Jenkins, the principal, who will be brought down in a later sequel but is now just being kind of an ass:\n\nMeg, don’t you think you’d make a better adjustment to life if you faced facts?\n\nI do face facts, Meg said. They’re lots easier to face than people, I can tell you.\n\nThen why don’t you face facts about your father?\n\nYou leave my father out of it! Meg shouted.\n\nStop bellowing, Mr. Jenkins said sharply. Do you want the entire school to hear you?\n\nSo what? Meg demanded. I’m not ashamed of anything I’m saying. Are you?\n\nUnfortunately for Meg, as in the case of so many of the outwardly belligerent, a propensity for bellowing hides a healthy case of I hate myself and would like to die. Still outraged by the boys’ insults, alone in the bathroom, Meg tells her cat, Just be glad you’re a kitten and not a monster like me.\n\nThe problem for Meg is that, while she’s well able to see the truth about others, good or bad, she has a miserable lack of insight into herself. Worse yet, she is surrounded by people who know exactly who they are. Her younger twin brothers, alone among the Murrys, manage to fit in: The twins didn’t have any problems…. They were strong and fast runners and good at games, and when cracks were made about anybody in the Murry family, they weren’t made about Sandy and Dennys. Then there’s her mother, who’s beautiful, kind, and a brilliant scientist. (Meg snorts at the idea that her mother’s looks or accomplishments are ordinary, although her mother, also enragingly modest, assures her they are.)\n\nYoungest brother Charles Wallace may have issues on the vast social stage of their country town (Thinking I’m a moron gives people something to be smug about), but only because being brilliant, psychic, and self-assured before reaching five feet never plays well on the playground. (FYI, Charles Wallace is the only preternaturally wise child I’ve ever been able to stand, in literature. Maybe that’s why I can’t stand the other ones—they’re NOT Charles Wallace.) Even their neighbor Calvin O’Keefe, whom Meg thinks of only as a popular, well-adjusted basketball player, only pretends to be standard-issue—he, like Charles, is both bright and highly attuned to unseen currents.\n\nMeg, on the other hand, is all flyaway hair, braces, irritation, and uncertainty—not ordinary enough to be popular in school, but not quite the extraordinary being Charles Wallace is. (As Charles Wallace puts it, Meg has it tough. She’s not really one thing or the other.) When she hears someone say, The two boys seem to be nice, regular children, but that unattractive girl and the baby boy certainly aren’t all there, there’s no more coherent rejoinder than her flying fists.\n\nBut Calvin O’Keefe, whose unabashed affection for Meg marks the beginning of her transformation, dispatches this whole line of inquiry neatly. Oh, for crying out loud, Calvin said, you’re Meg, aren’t you? Come on and let’s go for a walk.\n\nI’m sorry. I’m going to need to just swoon for one second over Calvin:\n\nTall he certainly was, and skinny. His bony wrists stuck out of the sleeves of his blue sweater; his worn corduroy trousers were three inches too short. He had orange hair that needed cutting and the appropriate freckles to go with it. His eyes were an oddly bright blue.\n\nLoving. Him. LOVING HIM. (You Poly and Vicky girls can keep your Zachary Grays and Adam Eddingtons.) Anyway, enough backstory. As you know, Calvin has been brought on the scene at the request of Mrs. Who, one of three mysterious old women who have arrived in order to help the Murrys retrieve their father, who, as the family knows perfectly, has not gone on the lam with a beautiful woman, but has, obviously, been stuck in a high-tech jail on a galaxy far, far away.\n\nBut in order to spring him loose, they are going to have to perform the act that landed Professor Murry in trouble in the first place—engaging in a tesseract. (Is the tesseract the object or action? Whatever.) As Mrs. Whatsit unhelpfully explains, \"Oh, we don’t travel at the speed of anything…. We tesser. Or you might say, we wrinkle.\"\n\nI’m going to need some visuals on that! (Readers who always skipped over the technical points in L’Engle: you might want to commence skipping now.) Okay, imagine an ant crawling on a piece of string. Now, imagine the string is a skirt! Oh, whatever, just listen to Mrs. Whatsit:\n\nSwiftly Mrs. Who brought her hands, still holding the skirt, together. Now, you see, Mrs. Whatsit said. \"He would be there, without that long trip.\n\nThat is how we travel.\"\n\nExactly! Sort of. I have always been grateful to L’Engle for the next section, which helped me pass fourth-grade geometry. Charles Wallace begins to quiz Meg on dimensions, taking her through the first dimension (a line), the second (a square), the third (a three-dimensional square, in which we live), then what’s the fourth:\n\nWell, I guess if you want to put it into mathematical terms you’d square the square. But you can’t take a pencil and draw it the way you can the first three. I know it’s got something to do with Einstein and time. I guess maybe you can call the fourth dimension Time.\n\nThat great whooshing sound you hear is the noise of 10 million readers deciding to just go ahead and be English majors. In any case, having tesseracted, fourth-dimension style, Meg’s father is not simply lost—he is imprisoned by the great brain of the Dark Thing, a shadow stretching over the entire universe that is also starting to creep over Earth, cloaking it in evil and despair.\n\nIn order to release him, the children are going to have to travel first to a lovely planet where Aunt Beast, part of a lovely race of eyeless, psychic, agreeably beast-y creatures, serves as their protector, then to Camazotz, where Dr. Murry is being held, a planet where the forces of evil have coalesced into a dreadful reign of conformity:\n\nThen the doors of all the houses opened simultaneously, and out came women like a row of paper dolls. The print of their dresses was different, but they all gave the appearance of being the same. Each woman stood on the steps of her house. Each clapped. Each child with the ball caught the ball. Each child with the skipping rope folded the rope. Each child turned and walked into the house. The doors clicked shut behind them.\n\nJust as in Meg’s small hometown, conformity alone is the face of evil, and knowledge—individual, eccentric knowledge—is a force of good.\n\nThis is a grand theme in L’Engle overall, but we see it in full force in the first few chapters of the book, where the reader is introduced, in no particular order, to E=mc², megaparsecs, Peru, Boswell’s Life of Johnson, Euripides, Delille, and a host of other terms with which your presumably middle-grade reader is rarely familiar. Even as the children watch the Dark Thing encircle their planet, they are comforted when Mrs. Whatsit tells them that there have been heroes fighting against it throughout history—not swashbucklers with laser guns, but saviors such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Pasteur, and Madame Curie and Einstein, and, for the purists among you, Jesus.\n\nBut, if the saviors of Creation are creative thinkers, it’s no surprise that the forces of evil are embodied in a large, red-tinged brain, IT—one whose droning repetition seeks to draw all comers into its Maoist haze. Meg resists its overwhelming pull first by reciting the periodic table, then the square roots of odd numbers (get it—odd!), and finally, when Charles Wallace is pulled into the great brain, appropriately enough, the Declaration of Independence:\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident! she shouted, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nAs she cried out the words she felt a mind moving in on her own, felt IT seizing, squeezing her brain.\n\nThen she realized that Charles Wallace was speaking, or being spoken through by IT.\n\nBut that’s exactly what we have on Camazotz. Complete equality. Everybody exactly alike.\n\nFor a moment her brain reeled with confusion. Then came a moment of blazing truth. No! she cried triumphantly. \"Like and equal are not the same thing at all!\"\n\nHow does Meg defeat evil? She, like the great thinkers before her, has an insight. That’s not her only tool against the big, throbbling blob of jelly, though. Among her peers, Meg also has one matchless strength:\n\nMy faults! Meg cried.\n\nYour faults.\n\nBut I’m always trying to get rid of my faults!\n\nWhat were her greatest faults? Anger, impatience, stubbornness. Yes, it was to her faults that she turned to save herself now.\n\nL’Engle has an interesting twist on the nature of knowledge, which is the weapon of choice in A Wrinkle in Time. Charles Wallace thinks his brain power alone can stand against IT, but he’s prideful—and easily overpowered. Calvin, who’s previously teased Meg for her spotty grasp of basics, is also put out of commission by the mighty IT early. Ensnaring Dr. Murry, who, I might remind you, advises the president, is like shooting fish in a barrel. Only Meg, who has been castigated by her math teachers for doing problems her way, not theirs; who has no idea where Peru is or who wrote Boswell’s Life of Johnson, who clings stubbornly to her own vast, spotty store of knowledge, can stand up to IT. Originality, it seems, is its own form of stubbornness—and it’s not enough to know. One must think—for oneself.\n\nAnd because Meg is able to think, she realizes what she can do that IT can’t do—and how she can free Charles Wallace, Calvin, and her father:\n\nHer own Charles Wallace, the child for whom she had come back to Camazotz, to IT, the baby who was so much more than she was, and who was yet so utterly vulnerable.\n\nShe could love Charles Wallace.\n\nCharles. Charles, I love you. My baby brother who always takes care of me. Come back to me, Charles Wallace, come away from IT, come back, come home. I love you, Charles. Oh, Charles Wallace, I love you.\n\nTears were streaming down her cheeks, but she was unaware of them.\n\nNow she was even able to look at him, at this animated thing that was not her own Charles Wallace at all. She was able to look and love.\n\nI love you. Charles Wallace, you are my darling and my dear and the light of my life and the treasure of my heart. I love you. I love you, I love you.\n\n…Then suddenly he was running, pelting, he was in her arms. He was shrieking with sobs. Meg! Meg! Meg!\n\nJeez, now I’M crying. But make no mistake, it’s not Meg’s love that saves Charles Wallace—it’s Meg’s bullheadedness, her insistence on doing things her own way, her belief that she is probably right. Meg isn’t simply a cute narrative depiction of a spunky girl. She’s indubitably, prepubescently bullheaded. This fault, because it allows Meg to stand behind her leaps of insight and her outsized love, in A Wrinkle in Time, amounts to no less than a kind of courage. Why, Meg, who laments in everyone else’s secure self-knowledge, turns out to actually have faith in herself—and it’s the kind of faith that can vanquish evil. Reading this book for the 18th time in my pajamas on a Sunday morning, I knew it was unlikely I’d be called upon to save the universe anytime soon. But—despite my glasses, temper, flyaway hair, and constant sense of outrage at our benighted world—it was nice to know I’d still have a shot.\n\nBOOK REPORT\n\nFrom the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\n\nBy E. L. Konigsburg 1967\n\nArtful Dodgers\n\nClaudia knew that she could never pull off the old-fashioned kind of running away. That is, running away in the heat of anger with a knapsack on her back.\n\nI miss New York. Not the New York currently hugging the edge of the Atlantic. But the New York of my youth, where a trip to the Museum of Natural History to stand agape at a white whale truly was a magical day (one before The Squid & The Whale associated it forever with that era’s less magical divorce rate); a New York before nannies got groped; a New York before private-school girls intertwined lustily on beds in some benighted plan to rule the school. It was a quieter, less overpopulated, pre-Reagan New York, one that had room for a notepad-toting minor to spy unaccompanied on people through dumbwaiters; a boy to wander Chinatown having adventures with a cricket; teenagers to contend with a genie in a mystery at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. It’s a New York that keeps adults perpetually at shoulder level, briefcases and purses jostling, while the children, front and center in the frame, get up to whatever children get up to.\n\nThe children in question are one Claudia and Jamie Kincaid, Greenwich-residing, grammar-school-aged siblings. In From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, as befits such an august title, these children’s getting-up-to entails one very long, unauthorized stay in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they come upon a statue of an angel that may or may not have been carved by Michelangelo—which, as they say, changes everything.\n\nClaudia Kincaid, architect of the above scheme, is a child of her own mind in all the best ways, quite unlike the Mini-Me adults passing for precocious nowadays. (When, when will we be free of the preternaturally wise, sophisticated child who wryly keeps adults in line? Gilmore Girls notwithstanding, I hate that child.) Forgoing hot-fudge sundaes for weeks to finance the venture, Claudia’s choice of hideout is the very reflection of how very particular she is:\n\nShe didn’t like discomfort; even picnics were untidy and inconvenient: all those insects and the sun melting the icing on the cupcakes. Therefore, she decided that her leaving home would not be just running from somewhere but would be running to somewhere. To a large place, a comfortable place, an indoor place, and preferably a beautiful place. And that’s why she decided upon the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\n\nHer choice of her brother Jamie, a third-grader, is equally practical: he is a total tightwad and in possession of a transistor radio. Claudia’s practicality, which also includes poking into the family garbage for such useful bits as a train pass with one free ride and scouring the AAA tour guide, extends so far she almost forgets why she is running away in the first place:\n\n…But not entirely. Claudia knew that it had a lot to do with injustice. She was the oldest child and the only girl and was subject to a lot of injustice. Perhaps it was because she had to both empty the dishwasher and set the table on the same night while her brothers got out of everything. And, perhaps, there was another reason more clear to me than to Claudia. A reason that had to do with the sameness of each and every week. She was bored with simply being straight-A’s Claudia Kincaid. She was tired of arguing about whose turn it was to choose the Sunday night seven-thirty television show, of injustice, and of the monotony of everything.\n\nOur narrative tour guide is, in fact, Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler—as the novel in its entirety takes shape in the form of a letter to her lawyer, Saxonberg, also, as it happens, Claudia and Jamie’s grandfather. In the grand epistolary-meets-omniscient tradition, Frankweiler is in possession of more knowledge than Claudia, both about the Angel she’s sold to the museum, and about Claudia herself.\n\nBut more about that later! First, the Met.\n\nIt will be generally admitted that the scenes depicting Claudia and Jamie’s initial stay at the Met are the most sublime realizations to have ever penetrated the shelves of man. After filling their violin and trumpet cases with clothes, hiding out on the back of their school bus, then sneaking off to (\"How can you sneak off to?\" Claudia asks her brother impatiently) catch the 10:42 to Grand Central, they spend the day at the museum choosing the antique bed upon which to sleep; then they hide in the bathrooms until all the staff have left:\n\n…She lay there in the great quiet of the museum next to the warm quiet of her brother and allowed the soft stillness to settle around them: a comforter of quiet. The silence seeped from their heads to their soles and into their souls. They stretched out and relaxed. Instead of oxygen and stress, Claudia thought now of hushed and quiet words: glide, fur, banana, peace. Even the footsteps of the night watchman added only an accented quarter-note to the silence that had become a hum, a lullaby.\n\nAnd! The! Automat! And! Bathing! In! The! Fountain! And! Brushing! Your Teeth! In! The! Quiet! And! Washing! Your! Clothes! Until! They’re! Gray! Chock! Full! O! Nuts! Gah!!!!! I could go on for 1,200 words just about the meaning of Claudia’s eventually choosing macaroni, baked beans, and coffee over breakfast food for breakfast at the Automat, paying with coins picked up off the bottom of the now-gone fountain—thereby combining two fantasies for which I would still happily give up a weekend at Canyon Ranch.\n\nHowever, I have to get around to the Angel, the statue of dubious provenance that becomes, in its mysterious beauty, the after-the-fact reason Claudia cites for her escape in the first place. Frankweiler explains why in one of many asides (this one railing) to Saxonberg:\n\nAre photo albums of your grandchildren the only pictures you look at? Are you altogether unconscious of the magic of the name of Michelangelo? I truly believe that his name has magic even now; the best kind of magic, because it comes from true greatness. Claudia sensed it again as she stood in line. The mystery only intrigued her: the magic trapped her.\n\nBecause, as Claudia begins to realize, she has come to the museum not only because she is sick of being the old Claudia, but because she wants—needs!—to return to Greenwich a different Claudia, a Claudia who has bigger concerns than keeping her whites and colors separated, brushing her teeth, and correcting her brother’s grammar: An answer to running away, and to going home again, lay in Angel, she thinks, then attempts to convince Jamie of their need to stay:\n\n…The statue just gave me a chance…almost gave me a chance. We need to make more of a discovery.\n\nSo do the people of the museum. What more of a discovery do you think that you, Claudia Kincaid, girl runaway, can make? A tape recording of Michelangelo saying, ‘I did it?’ Well, I’ll clue you in. They didn’t have tape recorders 470 years ago.\n\nI know that. But if we make a real discovery, I’ll know how to go back to Greenwich.\n\nYou take the New Haven, silly. Same way we go here. Jamie was losing patience.\n\nThat’s not what I mean. I want to know how to go back to Greenwich different.\n\nJamie shook his head. If you want to go different, you can take the subway to 125th Street and then take the train.\n\n\"I didn’t say differently, I said different. I want to go back different.\"\n\n…Claudia, I’ll tell you one thing you can do different…\n\nDifferently, Claudia interrupted.\n\nOh, boloney, Claude. That’s exactly it. You can stop ending every single discussion with an argument about grammar.\n\nI’ll try, Claudia said quietly.\n\nReaders, did you catch that boloney? (Yes, that’s the way it was spelled!) Thankfully, Bologna is spelled correctly in the filing system of Frankweiler, where she’s hidden the proof that the statue is indeed Michelangelo’s—proof that she gives to Claudia, contingent upon her always keeping the secret of the Angel.\n\nIt’s mildly absurd to place the idea of baptism into a book for children, but I’ll use it as a bold excuse for pointing out that, upon her arrival in Mrs. Frankweiler’s home, Claudia proceeds to take a bath in her ornate black marble tub, revealing yet again her penchant for the luxurious and surprising:\n\n…Claudia’s excitement flowed not bubbled. I could see that she was a little surprised. She had known that Angel would have the answer, but she had expected it to be a loud bang, not a quiet soaking in. Of course secrets make a difference. That’s why planning the runaway had been such fun; it was a secret. And hiding in the museum had been a secret. But they weren’t permanent; they had to come to an end. Angel wouldn’t. She could carry the secret of Angel inside her for twenty years just as I had. Now she wouldn’t have to be a heroine when she returned home…except to herself. And now she knew something about secrets that she hadn’t known before.\n\nI’m sorry—I’m going to have to add that unauthorized bath in an ornate claw-foot tub to the experiences I’d choose over a hot-stone rub. Because one of the many great things about Claudia’s character is how she takes a perceived girly negative—being picky—and turns it into what we see in our adulthood is a virtue: an appreciation for the sublime, for the very best in everything, and a respect for the mystery inherent in all things beautiful. While, doubtless, a grown-up Claudia would have conceived of a longing for Christian Louboutins, she’s a wonderful reminder, in our post-irony era, about how at its very heart, a love for the very best isn’t necessarily pretentious, consumerist, or craven.\n\nAnd in our post-irony age, Claudia’s experience is also a wonderful reminder of how children, though they may be precocious, certainly aren’t born knowing everything; and that when they do learn about life, it’s not always something awful they discover. (Say, the nature of divorce—one so horrible you’d have to find a metaphor for it in the Museum of Natural History.) When our class used to go for our twice-yearly trip to the Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the sense of splendor and possibility found in the quiet displays of histories and treasures was, to my young heart, almost unbearable. (It is still.) Rereading Mixed-Up Files, I couldn’t help but cheer for the fact that Claudia’s childhood isn’t some walled-off tomb, and it doesn’t end unceremoniously when it’s tragically shattered by some awful experience.
