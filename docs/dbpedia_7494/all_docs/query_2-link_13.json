        "text": "July 31, 2015\n\nI can't speak to the technical literary merits of this book, as it's been almost thirty years since I read it. But, I will tell you this-I am in the midst of writing my first short story for submission, obviously about my own childhood and its accompanying grief, and just spent the last forty-five minutes looking for the title of this book, and this is why: After I read this book, I had a good six months to a year of an active fantasy life, believing that maybe this is what had happened to me and that maybe my mother hadn't died when I was seven years and that maybe I could find her and that maybe my life wouldn't suck anymore. Obviously, that isn't what happened, but it gave me hope when it was sorely needed as a ten year old little girl. I mean, I sure loved Encyclopedia Brown, but I've never wanted anything I read to be more true than this book. Which, I doubt was the author's purpose, but at one point in my life, I thought it was the best thing every put on paper.\n\nNovember 9, 2008\n\n**[technically, there are some slight spoilers here, but nothing that you can't determine from the book's title & blurb]**\n\nThis book has taken on different levels of meaning for me as I've grown. When I first read this as a kid, I was primarily taken with the page-turner plot of Terri trying to figure out what her father was hiding from her. Later I identified with Terri and was awed by her maturity in handling such a situation. Now I feel so much for Terri's mother and am saddened by all that time lost between mother & daughter.\n\nNFM wrote this book for children and adults, and the sophistication shines through: the vividness of even the minor characters (Nancy, Shaundra and Aunt Vivian are so alive to me); Terri's tension as she struggles between being her usual obedient daughter self and doing what it takes to learn the truth.\n\nBy far, one of the best 1970s/80s YA novels out there. I wish Jezebel's Fine Lines had reviewed it before going on hiatus.\n\nJanuary 1, 2016\n\nThis book was a terrific read with many suspenseful moments within. It's about a young girl (Terri) who has always lived with her father and thinks her mother is not alive. However, they are always moving from one place to another. This makes Terri very suspicious about who her father really is. She believes that her father kidnapped her from her mother and is just not telling her where she is. Norma Fox Mazer writes the story well enough so that readers will actually be able to put themselves in Terri's place, especially with all of the decisions she has to make along the way. This book is definitely a book I would recommend to young adults. This is because the author really puts into perspective what it would be like to move all of the time and believe your father might have done something in the past that has affected you, is affecting you, and will affect you. This is overall an exciting and intriguing read that is great for a wide variety of people.\n\nJanuary 27, 2016\n\nThis is a story about a young girl living with her father after the death of her mother in a car accident when Terri was four years old. She's devoted to her father; they move often.\n\nThe reason for the frequent moving becomes clear when Terri finds out that her mother did not die in any car accident. Actually, Terri was abducted by her father when he and her mother were getting a divorce. The book deals with her slowly learning about that and then wanting to make contact with her mother even though it could mean her father would get in trouble with the law.\n\nThe story deals with something far too real in this world, and that is one parent kidnapping a child. As the author notes some 25,000 children are abducted each year and kept from their other parent, usually being taken by the father. The book does a good job examining how Terri grows to question what is going on and how she goes about trying to find out the truth.\n\nSeptember 21, 2016\n\nTaking Terri Mueller was a wonderful mystery book about how a 13 year old girl Terri that lived with her dad(Phil) as long as she could remember, and how Phil told her that when she was around four, that they went through a divorce and that her mother died in a car accident. Terri always thought about what she looked like and if she, in anyway acted like her. Then when Phil's sister Vivian wants to come down to visit for a couple days, she hears them talking in the other room about how she should know the truth about her life. That's how her quest to find her mother started, and the rest of the novel is about tracking down her mother and trying not to get her dad in trouble in the process. I really enjoyed this book because it had a lot of mystery in it, and it made me really interested in what I was reading. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys mysteries and awesome endings that leave all the characters in a good place.\n\nMay 17, 2013\n\nThis book was given to me by a friend, and I wasn't too impressed with it. The main character, Terri Mueller, lives with her dad, and they move around all over the country. She lives her whole life unknowingly on the run, believing her mother died in a car accident when she was three years old. One day she finds out her mother may be alive, and she spends her time trying to get in contact with her mom. I would recommend this book to younger kids, because I found it a little too easy to read and the story line was predictable.\n\nFebruary 15, 2018\n\nI had read this some time ago. I had seen it at our high school library but didn't get to read it then. I was so intrigued though.\n\nI recall how well it brought you in and made the situation a reality. Many times we think everything is black or white but it isn't that way more often than not. There's so many grey areas.\n\nSo be this child realizing what had been done. You love your father dearly but want to know your mother. What do you do?\n\nThe great turmoil that comes is not far fetched by any means. I recall the \"Face on the Milk Carton\" had been the same in showing how just because you rightly belong somewhere, after so much time you are strangers. Well particularly if removed at a young age. The show Finding Carter is about the same concept.\n\nAll in all a good eye opening book that has you feeling for the protagonist and being with her through difficult decisions.\n\nDecember 28, 2023\n\n3 1/2 stars. Fairly predictable story but I really love how Terri's emotional state is dealt with.\n\nMost of the story takes place in Ann Arbor, Michigan - but you wouldn't know it if they hadn't specifically mentioned the city.\n\nI am left wondering if Shaundra hooked up with George? Guess I'll never know!\n\nMay 20, 2022\n\ni enjoyed the dialogue in this book a lot. i think that was one of it's redeeming qualities. this book wasn't great to me but it wasn't bad, either--just average.\n\nFebruary 3, 2024\n\nUm wow. I don’t remember reading this when I was young, but the writing is brilliant ,the story is touching. And I don’t have the words to describe every thing I’m feeling.\n\nSeptember 16, 2021\n\nTerri goes back to her kidnapper father who brainwashed her. I understand wanting to be with your child but Terri's dad doesn't seem to comprehend just how selfish he was.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJanuary 24, 2016\n\nI picked this up at my local second-hand bookstore because I'd heard it named as a classic of YA. Reading it as an adult it fell a bit flat; maybe if I'd read it as a teen I'd have felt differently. I thought the first half of the book, where Teri is trying to figure out what her father is hiding from her, was much stronger than the second half, after she's found out. One thing I found hugely distracting was the weird (to me) POV shifts that started somewhere around the middle of the book. Suddenly after it being all Teri's POV we get her dad, her dad's girlfriend, and I think even her mom at one point. Mazer obviously wanted to show the reader how other people were feeling, but for me it totally broke my emotional connection to the book, since I was thrown out of the character I'd started to identify with.\n\nTeri's father's reason for what he did wasn't convincing to me (surely there are laws he could have called on to remedy the situation, rather than taking such a drastic step??) and I didn't much like her mother or her mother's family. They felt very fake and VERY insensitive -- giving her all the Christmas/birthday presents they'd bought for her over the years was just downright creepy. Then again, since Mazer spends so much of the time making you like her father, I guess that's not surprising. Oddly enough, the character I found most interesting was Teri's aunt Vivian. I kept wanting more of her story. Maybe it's because as an adult reader, I crave subplots.\n\nAugust 8, 2016\n\nI picked up this book expecting it to be an emotional read that would likely have me in tears. Maybe as a teenager it might have but now as an adult, I didn't get the emotional depth out if it I had anticipated. It started off wonderfully but sort of fizzled out towards the latter half, just as I was becoming connected to Terri and rooting for her to \"find out the secret her dad was hiding\". It was predictable in its outcome but for her sake. I'm glad. To me, the most disappointing aspect us how much detail author gave in the beginning to help get reader involved in who Terri was pre-secret revelation but once secret is exposed suddenly all the details of each involved individual fall flat and the book seems to end all too quickly without giving you a chance to understand the raw emotions of all involved. As I mentioned before. since this us a YA book. my criticisms may be a bit harsh as I am looking at it from a more mature POV whereas younger readers, once finding out the secret, may be content to let the rest fall quickly into place rather then extending it to fully embrace the follow-up. Although I only gave it 2 stars, I am glad to have read it as unfortunately this situation of Terri's is still happening to children worldwide today and hopefully the more people read and discuss these books, the more attention can be placed on finding solutions that are equitable to all parties so these things will one day become rare or even non existent.\n\nApril 12, 2013\n\nI liked \"Taking Terri Mueller\" only for it's somewhat interesting plot. Other than that, it was told in a very predictable and bland way, which really ruined what could have been a very interesting plot and great book.\n\nI didn't like how predictable this book was. It was always obvious what was going to happen next, and that didn't bode well for a book who's plot seemed to depend on some sort of shock factor. It wasn't very relatable, either, as the characters were boring and didn't have much personality at all.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this book, but I guess some that like a cheap mystery-like book might find this mildly entertaining.\n\nNovember 18, 2009\n\nI think this is a nice book. I might think that the author is trying to send a message to those readers that what happen to Terri could happen to some other kids and I presonally don't think its a great thing for a parent to kidnapped his/her own child. But this is really great because it could open students mind to be careful in life. I even have a cousin that wasn't thinking enough and almost ruined her life for one mistake she made. Ohhh!On the last past of the story Terri decides to go back with his dad because she felt bad about him even though her father kidnapped her.\n\nFebruary 1, 2011\n\nTerri can only remember life with her father. He told her her mother died in a car crash when she was 4. Terri begins to question why they have moved so often, never see relatives, or have any old pictures. She learns that her father kidnapped her when she was a baby. Terri struggles to figure out her life and what the right thing to do is.\n\nJuly 29, 2015\n\nOooh, I loved this book as a teen. Why was Terri always having to move around? Why didn't she remember her mother? It took me forever to figure it out. I was just reminded of this title when I saw it's being re-released by Lizzie Skurnick books, whose mission I totally admire but who had yet to hit one of my personal nostalgia titles. http://lizzieskurnickbooks.com/\n\nMay 22, 2012\n\nA little dated, but a fairly good read. It would be interesting to see the same story updated to today's technology. Terri was kidnapped by her father when she was five, but she does not know that.\n\nJuly 1, 2016\n\nI know I read this as a kid, but I didn't remember much of it - only Terri's friend's \"bunny fur jacket\" (which I think means faux fur?) and how she gets all the birthday and Christmas presents from her grandparents that they've saved for her.\n\nNovember 20, 2009\n\nI definitely loved this book in the way that you love a teen novel written thirty years ago. But I did love it. It's so simple and emotional. Hats off to the late, great Norma Fox Mazer.\n\nNovember 28, 2012\n\nThe ending of this book was so stupid!\n\nNovember 24, 2015\n\nRead when I was in middle school. Really liked the abduction stories. So far removed from my normal kid life. Very easy to get vested in the story."
