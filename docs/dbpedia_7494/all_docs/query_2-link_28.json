        "text": "Sunday Brunch\n\nMore random ramblings about children’s books. Please forgive the erratic sizes of the pictures below. I'd like to have them uniform throughout but, for reasons I never can understand, sometimes I'm allowed to make larger images and other times only small ones work. However, you can sometimes click on an image and see a larger version.\n\nMARTHA-LITE\n\nThe other day I thought I saw a new book about Martha, the canine star of Susan Meddaugh’s modern classic MARTHA SPEAKS. I eagerly pulled the volume off the shelf and discovered this instead:\n\nIt wasn’t really a new Susan Meddaugh book, though she was credited on the cover for creating the characters. Instead, it was a subpar picture book based on the PBS cartoon series. Neither the story nor the writing had the same appeal as the original “Martha” books. And when I glanced at the backflap, I learned that there are even more books based on the TV show, including early readers (FARM DOG MARTHA; PLAY BALL!) and chapter books (SHELTER DOG BLUES.)\n\nI guess it’s inevitable that every original children’s book made into a movie or TV show will also later be published in cheap, moneymaking adaptations (weren’t Chris Van Allsburg’s POLAR EXPRESS and JUMANJI “novelized” when the movie versions were released?) But in the past you could usually tell the real thing from the pretenders: the original book was published in hardcover with its traditional cover image, while the adaptations were published in paperback and the cover featured a still from the movie or TV program. In the case of MARTHA SAYS IT WITH FLOWERS, the book was issued in hardcover by Ms. Meddaugh’s longtime publisher Houghton Mifflin and utilizes the same green-border-with-vegetable-soup-letters motif used in the original Martha books.\n\nHow many kids will know the difference between the originals and these pale imitations?\n\nDo the latter books hurt the integrity of the Meddaugh originals?\n\nOr are most kids savvy enough to create a division in their minds -- the way a generation of earlier readers did between the world depicted in Laura Ingalls Wilder’s children’s books and the characters and situations shown on TV’s LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE?\n\nTHEY DID IT AGAIN!\n\nLast year the publisher Bloomsbury was under fire when they issued an advance reading copy of Justine Larbalastier’s LIAR which featured a caucasian girl on the cover, though the text explicitly stated that the character had dark skin and curly hair. After complaints from both the author and the public, Bloomsbury used a different photograph on the cover of the hardcover volume:\n\nNow comes word that Bloomsbury has done it again.\n\nAlthough the text describes the character as dark-skinned, the protagonist of Jaclyn Dolamore’s new novel, MAGIC UNDER GLASS, is shown as light-skinned on the dustjacket of the book:\n\nThe same mistake coming from the same publisher within six months has caused some bloggers to call for a Bloomsbury boycott.\n\nFrom a book-collecting perspective, I think it’s probably a good idea to get a copy of the book with the offending dustjacket, for historical purposes, before Bloomsbury ultimately changes the illustration.\n\nINCIDENTALLY...\n\n...there is no truth to the rumor that Bloomsbury plans to publish this biography:\n\nA RAINBOW OF BOOKS\n\nMany years ago I was in the basement of the Strand, New York’s largest and best used bookstore, when a woman perusing the children’s shelves asked me if I’d ever heard of author Andrew Lang. I said, “Yes, he published a bunch of children’s fairy tale books and each one had a color in the title.” She identified herself as descendent of Andrew Lang and seemed very impressed that I knew about the books. I’m glad she didn’t ask me any more questions about the series, though, as I really didn’t know much more than the author, the titles, and the fact that each volume was named after a color and bound in that color. I’ve never read the books at all.\n\nRecently someone asked me for a list of these books and I thought I’d provide it here for anyone else who might be interested. Beginning with THE BLUE FAIRY BOOK in 1889, there were eleven more books published over the next twenty-one years. Lang selected the stories from a variety of sources and edited them, but they were actually written and translated for the books by his wife, Leonora Blanche Alleyne Lang, and other writers. As stated in Anita Silvey’s CHILDREN’S BOOKS AND THEIR CREATORS, “The irony of Lang's life and work is that although he wrote for a profession—literary criticism; fiction; poems; books and articles on anthropology, mythology, history, and travel original stories for chldren...he is best recognized for the works he did not write.”\n\nHere is the list of the volumes:\n\nTHE BLUE FAIRY BOOK / 1889\n\nTHE RED FAIRY BOOK / 1890\n\nTHE GREEN FAIRY BOOK / 1892\n\nTHE YELLOW FAIRY BOOK / 1894\n\nTHE PINK FAIRY BOOK / 1897\n\nTHE GREY FAIRY BOOK / 1900\n\nTHE VIOLET FAIRY BOOK / 1901\n\nTHE CRIMSON FAIRY BOOK / 1903\n\nTHE BROWN FAIRY BOOK / 1904\n\nTHE ORANGE FAIRY BOOK / 1906\n\nTHE OLIVE FAIRY BOOK / 1907\n\nTHE LILAC FAIRY BOOK / 1910\n\nThere is no truth to the rumor that Bloomsbury plans to re-publish these books by the titles THE FAIRY BOOK, THE FAIRY BOOK, THE FAIRY BOOK, THE FAIRY BOOK, etc., with all-white covers.\n\nBULLYING BIBLIOTHERAPY\n\nHas anyone read Julie Ann Peters’ latest, BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS, I’LL BE DEAD? What did you think?\n\nI’m still trying to sort out my feelings on this one.\n\nMs. Peters is clearly a talented author. Her works include the National Book Award nominee LUNA as well as GRL2GRL, a volume of short stories that includes some of best work ever.\n\nHer latest, with its Lois Duncan/Carol Beach York-like title and provocative dustjacket will no doubt draw readers, though they may not expect the exceptionally dark content inside. BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS... is the story of teenage Daelyn who, after a lifetime of bullying and a recent failed suicide attempt, is intent on killing herself. Joining a website for the suicidal, Daelyn explores a number of (permanent) options, each of which (cutting one’s wrist, carbon monoxide poisoning, etc.) is thoroughly described in the text (including its effectiveness, the time and pain involved, etc.) Including this type of information in a YA novel will no doubt be deemed controversial (will any readers use this as an instruction book?) though it can be argued that such information is equally available on the internet at any time for anyone to read. In this introspective and unrelenting novel, Daelyn recounts her experiences being bullied throughout school and her wish for death. Although the book ultimately delivers a message of healing and hope, it’s heavy stuff. And the entire tone is overly purposeful.\n\nThis is especially evident by the “Discussion Guide and Resource list prepared by C.J. Bott” at the end of the book. As uncomfortable as Daelyn’s story and the blatant descriptions of possible suicide methods made me, this discussion guide (which includes phone numbers for suicide prevention lines and websites) bothered me as well. Part of me thinks that it was necessary -- and responsible -- to include it. Another part of me thinks that it diminishes the book as a work of fiction, turning it instead into a bibliotherapeutic volume.\n\nI’d be interested in hearing what others think of this book. Right now I’m of two minds....\n\nAND ANOTHER DISCLAIMER\n\nRecently I looked at a copy of GHOST HUNTRESS BOOK 2 : THE GUIDANCE by Marley Gibson and was surprised that this occult thriller included a disclaimer at the end of the book advising young readers to seek help from adults if they feel they have psychic tendencies.\n\nI guess it was included to prevent young readers from going off the deep end, but it strikes me as kind of silly. How many books did I read as a kid -- including a half-dozen by Zilpha Keatley Snyder alone -- in which young people discovered they had psychic abilities. No one in those books ever went running to an adult for help -- what a way to spoil the story! -- and I doubt any real-life kids would as well.\n\nEXTRA, EXTRA!\n\nA friend who attended the American Library Association’s midwinter conference sent me these cool souvenirs: a copy of COGNOTES, the daily newspaper distributed each day at ALA, as well as the press release for the Newbery/Caldecott selections.\n\nAccording to my friend, copies of the newspaper and the press release are handed to attended as they leave the conference room after the award announcements. Considering the advance time that must be needed to print these materials, it’s surprising that this information is never leaked before the official announcements.\n\nIf I worked in the ALA printshop, I’d probably spend all night calling friends and telling them who won the prizes.\n\nWhich is probably why I will never be offered a job in the ALA printshop.\n\nSPEAKING OF PRINTING\n\nA few people have written asking about the first printing of WHEN YOU REACH ME.\n\nIn response:\n\nThe two arcs released prior to publication were paperback.\n\nIn order for a book to be a true first edition, it must have the entire print key on the copyright page: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. If the “1” is missing, you have a second printing, if the “1” and “2” are missing, you have a third printing, etc.\n\nOnce a book gets to ten printings, the row of numbers changes to 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11. At this point, WHEN YOU REACH ME is in at least its 15th printing.\n\nCopies of the book with the dustjacket illustration printed on the front cover are probably book club (Junior Literary Guild, etc.) editions. They are usually not considered as valuable as the regular trade edition.\n\nThanks for visiting Collecting Children’s Books. Hope you’ll be back.\n\nThe Clean-up Crew\n\nI have never worked as a janitor. I did, however, spend a couple teenage years employed at McDonalds where, on rare occasions, I was assigned \"lot and lobby\" duty. This entailed mopping the restaurant's floors, cleaning the bathrooms, and crushing full garbage bags in the giant trash compactor behind the store. As I said, I didn't pull \"lot and lobby\" too often, but of course one of those times had to be the day someone died in the parking lot and the manager told me to go outside and \"hose down the blood.\"\n\nWhen I think of janitors...custodians...maintenance engineers...I always think of \"Ty,\" the high-school-janitor protagonist of one of my favorite novellas, VALEDICTORY by Mackinlay Kantor.\n\nGoing back in my own life, I also recall \"Ned,\" the beloved custodian at my old grade school -- and probably the only adult that we kids were allowed to call by his first name. Toward the end of our grade school days, a friend of mine said she went to say hi to Ned as he waxed the floor of an empty classroom...and he leered at her and began chasing her around the desks. That was one of the first times I realized that people are often not what they appear to be....\n\nFor years and years after that, as I went to school or held various jobs, I had little direct contact with custodians. Usually they worked a different shift than I did or, if our work hours did overlap, they'd rush through the office pushing a loud vacuum cleaner and listening to music on their iPod, with no personal communication beyond a nod or a muttered \"hi.\" Although occasionally the custodian in one office would leave notes on my desk. The one I remember best said, \"If you MUST chew gum, please wrap it in paper before throwing it your wastebasket.\" Good advice, I guess, though I still chuckle over the stern \"if you MUST chew gum\" reprimand.\n\nFor the past couple years, I have had the same custodian cleaning my office. I see \"Billie Faye\" almost every morning and she's always got something interesting to say.\n\nA while back she told me that her grandmother cured lung congestion the old-fashioned way by drinking \"cowpat tea.\"\n\n\"What's that made of?\" I asked.\n\n\"Cow s--t,\" she said.\n\nAnother time Billie Faye told me that she and her \"old man\" once spent a year living in California.\n\n\"Did you go out there looking for work?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"We was running from the law.\"\n\nThe old man is now out of the picture, and Billie Faye currently lives with her ninety-year-old aunt. Recently B.F. came home from work and found her aunt laying unconscious, half on the floor and half on top of a shattered glass coffee table.\n\n\"Oh no!\" I said. \"Did she have a stroke?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" said Billie Faye. \"Passed out drunk!\"\n\nWhen I tell these Billie Faye anecdotes to friends, they always say, \"You have to put her in a book someday!\"\n\n\"I know!\" I reply, already envisioning a fictionalized version of Billie having a small, but pithy, role in my future Newbery-winning novel. (Newbery? Hey, if I'm going to dream, why not dream BIG?)\n\nBut then it suddenly dawned on me...maybe it will be the other way around.\n\nMaybe Billie Faye will base a character on me in her novel!\n\nAfter all, just the other day I saw her pull an empty Lean Cuisine box out of my wastebasket and study it carefully. She saw me looking at her and explained, \"I always like to see what everyone else had for lunch.\"\n\nAnd when you think about it, who better than a custodian to know all your secrets? Who but a custodian sees the old shopping lists and bank statements you casually toss in your trashcan? I'm sure janitors have been known to find empty vodka bottles hidden in office desks. I'm sure they've pieced-together love letters that you've torn up and thrown in the wastebasket. They've overheard your private phone calls as they sweep around your desk, probably heard the boss yelling at you when they dust the computers. (Just because they've got their iPod buds in their ears doesn't mean they've got any music playing.)\n\nWorking as a janitor really would be a great job for an aspiring writer.\n\nAnd lots of writers have done this kind of work in the past.\n\nWriter-illusrator Michael Garland (THE GREAT EASTER EGG HUNT) once worked as a custodian. So did Elvira Woodruff (GHOSTS DON'T GET GOOSEBUMPS.) Audrey Couloumbis, who won a Newbery Honor for GETTING NEAR TO BABY, was a school custodian; can you imagine how much she may have observed about kids in that position?\n\nHey, even Stephen King once worked as a janitor.\n\nFor most of the above, custodial work was just a pitstop on their way to success. However, I can think of two highly-esteemed children's authors who worked as janitors throughout much of their writing career.\n\nTrained as a grade-school teacher, Richard Kennedy worked as a cab driver, factory worker, and fireman before he became a custodian at Oregon State University, a position he held throughout much of his writing career. In addition to THE DARK PRINCESS and AMY'S EYES, Mr. Kennedy also wrote a short novel called INSIDE MY FEET : THE STORY OF A GIANT, which was inspired by a pair of empty shoes he found abandoned in a hallway he was cleaning at work.\n\nAnd Meindert Dejong worked as a church janitor during the 1950s, as he was producing some of the most highly-praised children's books of that decade -- including Newbery winner THE WHEEL ON THE SCHOOL and four more Honor Books.\n\nI wonder how many other famous children's book authors have done custodial work in the past?\n\nAnd how many future children's book authors are doing custodial work now?\n\nJust think: the person who quietly wet-mops your floor, peels sticky gum out of your wastebasket (I now wrap it in paper first -- really I do!) and empties your trash may one day be sharing your secrets in a book!\n\nBrunch for a Post-Award Weekend\n\nWelcome to another Sunday Brunch containing random facts and opinions on children’s books.\n\nTHIS WEEK’S BIG QUESTION\n\nI love monitoring the “keyword activity” on my blog’s stat counter because it gives me a sense of what type of info people are seeking from Collecting Children’s Books. This week’s most-asked question has been “How big was the first printing of WHEN YOU REACH ME?”\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to find the answer yet.\n\nSometimes the size of a print run is mentioned on the ARC of a book -- particularly when the number is big (i.e. “50,000 first printing”) although I have heard that such promotional numbers are often more optimistic than accurate.\n\nOccasionally Publishers Weekly will list printing info for a title in an article (“After a first printing of 10,000, Book X has gone back for two more printings, resulting in 45,000 copies now in print.”)\n\nHowever, in the case of Rebecca Stead’s novel, I have seen no info beyond the fact that, between its July 14 publication date and last week, the book was in its fifteenth printing and had sold well over 100,000 copies. Now that it’s been named this year’s Newbery winner, those numbers are sure to zoom way, way upward.\n\nWhich leads to the question of whether this book will become one of those impossible-to-find Newbery first editions. I can’t say for sure, but speaking completely subjectively, my guess is that this novel is going to become a kid-favorite along the lines of Ellen Raskin’s THE WESTING GAME and E.L. Konigsburg’s FROM THE MIXED-UP FILES OF MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWEILER. Those titles are widely-sought-after yet, while first editions are expensive to acquire, they are not impossible to find. WHEN YOU REACH ME got a lot of buzz when it was published (i.e. it was one of those rare children’s books reviewed in People Magazine) and I suspect that it sold a fair number of copies through bookstores -- so many of those first editions will continue to float around in the used book market in the coming years...meaning the book may become expensive, but won’t be near-impossible to find. The very hardest Newbery books to find are those that didn’t receive much buzz upon publication, and whose first editions were mostly sold to the library market. Examples of these are Cynthia Kadohata’s KIRA-KIRA and Linda Sue Park’s A SINGLE SHARD, first editions of which now sell for over a thousand dollars each.\n\nANOTHER INQUIRY\n\nThe other thing I like about monitoring this blog’s keyword activity is that I often learn things I never knew before. This week several people visited the blog (or maybe it was just one person visiting over and over again) trying to find info on Lauren Tarshis and the book IRONWEED.\n\nWell, that kind of threw me.\n\nLauren Tarshis is the author of one of my favorite recent children's books, EMMA-JEAN LAZARUS FELL OUT OF A TREE and its sequel, EMMA-JEAN LAZARUS FELL IN LOVE.\n\nIRONWEED is the Pulitzer Prize winning adult novel by William Kennedy.\n\nI recently read IRONWEED and guess what? I like the “Emma-Jean Lazarus” books better.\n\nAnyway, I figured that someone was just confused about the authorship of IRONWEED. But then I did a little research and discovered there really is a connection between Ms. Tarshis and IRONWEED. The novel was made into a 1988 film starring Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson and, in connection with the movie, Penguin released a paperback entitled THE MAKING OF IRONWEED. It appears the main selling-point of that book were the photographs by Claudio Edinger; his name is the only one on the cover. But it turns out that Lauren Tarshis is credited with doing all the interviews that accompany the photographs inside. Who knew that, twenty years before Emma-Jean Lazarus, Lauren Tarshis was writing books about Meryl Streep?\n\nOh, and guess who narrated the audio book versions of both “Emma Jean” books? Meryl Streep’s daughter, Mamie Gummer.\n\nHow’s that for a coincidence?\n\nNow I’m wondering if IRONWEED photographer Claudio Edinger is related to children’s book blogger, New York Times book reviewer, and School Library Journal covergal Monica Edinger.\n\nDRIVE-THRU BOOKS\n\nThis week, while sitting in the drive-thru line of a fast food restaurant, I heard an ad on the radio featuring a dramatic excerpt from Gary Paulsen’s HATCHET. It’s one of several public service announcements from the Library of Congress that promote reading children's books. Other ads contain clips from CALL IT COURAGE by Armstrong Sperry, ELLA ENCHANTED by Gail Carson Levine, and MANIAC MAGEE by Jerry Spinelli.\n\nYou can learn more about these commercials, view author webcasts, and even enter children’s book contests at the Read.gov website, located here.\n\nAnyway, as I sat waiting in that drive-thru line, I started thinking about the cheap plastic toys that fast-food restaurants hand out with “kids’ meals” to promote all the latest movies. And this got me wondering if any restaurant has ever tried to give out books as freebies. I guess it would be asking too much for them to give away whole paperback books, but how about chapter-length excerpts? I bet that moms and dads (already feeling guilty about yet another drive-thru dinner) would jump on board for this, especially if there was an advertising campaign along the lines of “Nutrition for the Mind.”\n\nTo be honest, I doubt that most kids would rather read a chapter of book than hit each other with some wind-up plastic action figure (“Caution: this toy contains movable parts and may be a choking hazard”) but some will. And some of those will then go to the library and seek out the entire book to find out what happens after Chapter One....\n\nANOTHER LINK\n\nJesse Young sent me a note about a new website that may be of interest to readers of Collecting Children’s Books. It’s called 100 Fantastic Book Sites for Kids and Teens and contains all kinds of links to literature-related websites and blogs.\n\nIt looks like it’s worth checking out!\n\nHey, wait a minute, how come my blog wasn’t listed there?\n\nIS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WRITING FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN?\n\nI just read in Publishers Weekly that Gabrielle Zevin, whose ELSEWHERE and MEMOIRS OF A TEENAGE AMNESIAC were big hits with YA readers, is publishing a new adult novel, THE HOLE WE’RE IN. In an accompanying interview, Ms. Zevin was asked if her creative process was different when writing for an adult audience. She responded: “For a long time, I said there was no difference, but that was a lie, born from a futile desire to convince people that writing for youth wasn’t something I did when my brain was on vacation. Essentially, though, when I am writing for children, I feel a certain responsibility toward them and the kinds of stories I find myself wanting to tell them likely reflect that. When I’m writing for adults, the characters are old and seem to curse a lot.”\n\nThis got me wondering what other authors have said about the differences between writing for adults and kids. I’ve rounded up a few responses from the web here:\n\nCatherine Jinks\n\nThere are certainly differences, but I wouldn't say I go into a different 'space'. When I get an idea for a story, I simply decide right from the get-go whether it's an idea for children or an idea for adults. Then I find that everything stems from the initial choice of category, and I don't have to spend much time worrying about what 'hat' I am wearing. When I am writing for children, there are more restrictions on content and writing style, but absolutely no restraints on ideas - the sky's the limit. When I am writing for adults, the reverse applies. Adults won't necessarily 'go with' you as far as a child will, but are far more amenable when it comes to big words, sex, violence and slow, meandering plots.\n\nM.E. Kerr\n\nI love writing for kids because I'm a person with an agenda usually. I should've been a preacher. I usually have something on my mind that I want to talk to people about, change their mind about and writing for kids, you still have that opportunity. You don't have much opportunity when you write for adults of changing their minds.\n\nCarl Hiaasen\n\nThe biggest challenge was trying not to subconsciously \"write down\" for younger readers. As J.K. Rowling and others have proven, kids are sophisticated readers with terrific vocabularies. They're also quite aware when adults are underestimating them. ...It didn't take me as long to write HOOT as it does to write the other novels, partly because it was slightly shorter and partly because the plot wasn't quite as multilayered. Another reason it went along so quickly, frankly, is that I was having so much fun writing it.\n\nLemony Snicket\n\nI guess one thing that is handy about writing for children is that books tend to be shorter, so I've written a large number of books in a short amount of time, and that's good training. But in terms of specific things about writing for adults versus writing for children, I don't think there's that much of a difference.\n\nLouis Sachar\n\nI don't really believe that writing for children is very different from writing for adults. What makes good children's books is putting the same care and effort into them as I would if I were writing for adults. I don’t write anything—put anything in my books that I'd be embarrassed to put in an adult book. The literary world often places children's literature below adult literature. But looking back through the ages, the really classic children’s books have all had beautifully developed plot, structure, and characterization. ...I've always believed that I learned to write for children by reading books written for adults. For instance, Kurt Vonnegut's Hocus Pocus and William Goldman's The Princess Bride influenced the way I wrote Holes. I liked the way the opening chapters of these books were sort of short and jumpy, and how they led into the story. And The Princess Bride had these colorful characters and this bizarre setting, and that's sort of like Holes.\n\nJoan Aiken\n\nAs far as I am concerned an autopilot takes over to change the mode between writing for adults and writing for children. There are many differences -- the vocabulary is simpler, the style more direct. The pace is faster when writing for children, who soon become bored by descriptions of thought-processes, flashbacks, overlong descriptions. There is no great difference in the structure of plots. Characters in children's books are simpler and more strongly defined, like those in Morality plays -- personified abstractions.\n\nEileen Goudge\n\nAdults are more patient when it comes to giving a slow-going story a chance. Young adults, on the other hand, will give a book one, maybe two pages before they'll put it down, if it doesn't interest them (the exception being if it's assigned in school). I learned early how to hook a reader and not let go. The same rule has served me well in my adult fiction.\n\nArmstrong Sperry\n\nI learned that there is no essential difference between writing for young people and writing for adults, except that the former is perhaps more exacting. It calls for a discipline of words almost as demanding as the discipline of poetry. Every word must tell. The writer who loses himself in the windy descriptive passages, who indulges too many flights of philosophical fancy, will wake up to find that his reader has gone out to play ball. His story must move. It must have pace, action, drama and suspense.\n\nFrancisco X. Stork:\n\nMy own recent experience of writing a \"Young Adult\" novel about a sixteen year old boy is that I would not do anything differently had the story been intended for adults. What was required here, as in any fiction work, was the ability to \"remember\" the thoughts, experiences, of a young man. ...There was no need to write differently than I would otherwise write. There were no formulas to be followed. There was one concern, however, that pressed on me more than if the potential readership of young people had not been in my mind. I am writing as an adult and as such I cannot forego a certain \"moral obligation\". This \"moral obligation\" is not a prissy sense of decorum, but rather an awareness of the need to present not only the adversity, ignorance and evil that may be present in a young person's life but to show the ability inherent in us all (and perhaps especially in young persons) to confront adversity with courage, hope and the power of friendship.\n\nKevin Brooks\n\nThere are not many differences, I don't think, between writing for children and writing for adults because children aren't that different from adults. But I would say the story is the main thing, with children. With adults you might use different styles and structures, perhaps indulge in fiddly niceties. Writing for children brings you down to basics.\n\nPILLOW BOOK\n\nI got a kick out of yesterday’s blog by Fuse #8, which tells of her recent stay in a Boston hotel where you could have a “dream butler” bring you a special pillow from their “pillow library.” (And you thought my idea of drive-thru books was quirky!) Fuse titled her blog “Oh, Dream Butler. I Believe You Can Get Me Through the Night” -- a take-off on the Gary Wright song “Dream Weaver” which seemed to be on the radio incessantly throughout my high school years and which now, thanks to Fuse #8’s blog, I can’t get out of my head this weekend-- no matter how hard I try!\n\nOh well, at least it reminded me that the song has a children’s books connection.\n\nDid you know that the title story in Jane Yolen’s 1989 book DREAM WEAVER AND OTHER TALES was inspired by this hit record, which Ms. Yolen describes as “a bad rock song.”\n\nYou never know what phrase will spark an author’s interest and lead to a story.\n\nFor all we know, an author read Fuse #8’s blog yesterday and is now working on a fantasy story about “dream librarians” who catalog and loan out people’s dreams and nightmares....\n\nNEXT JANUARY....\n\nI’m still exhausted from this week’s book award announcements. Still haven’t caught up on my sleep...still haven’t read all the Printz selections...still haven’t placed the new winning books on my shelves.\n\nBut it’s never too early to start thinking about next year.\n\nVery early last year I heard someone mention Rodman Philbrick’s MOSTLY TRUE ADVENTURES OF HOMER P. FIGG as a Newbery possibility. I’m so glad I bought a copy then, as it turned out to be a surprise Newbery Honor this week.\n\nSometimes those early whispers turn out to be right on the mark.\n\nA couple years ago, I began hearing “Newbery talk” about Gary D. Schmidt’s THE WEDNESDAY WARS before it was even published. ...Months and months later, the novel was named a Newbery Honor Book.\n\nOf course sometimes it works the other way around. The following year I also heard early “Newbery talk” about Mr. Schmidt’s novel TROUBLE...but by the time the award season rolled around that book seemed a distant memory and received no recognition at all.\n\nSo you never know.\n\nAnyway, my plan was to end today’s blog by citing three titles that are already inspiring “Newbery talk” in the children’s book world.\n\nThey are:\n\nA CONSPIRACY OF KINGS by Megan Whalen Turner\n\nMOCKINGBIRD by Katherine Erskine\n\nONE CRAZY SUMMER by Rita Williaims-Garcia\n\nI was patting myself on the back for scooping everyone else on these title, but then I did a little search and discovered that Jonathan Hunt and his readers at the Heavy Medal Blog have already begun a list of 2011 Newbery contenders.\n\nNot only are the three titles on my list included, but so are a dozen more -- some of which I’ve never even heard of until now.\n\nAnd now I’ve got to track those books down so I won’t feel like I’m behind!\n\nIn other words, the gold award stickers haven’t even dried on this year’s winners and it’s already time to go chasing after next year’s contenders!\n\nNo wonder I’m tired!\n\nThanks for visiting Collecting Children’s Books. Hope you’ll return.\n\nEveryone's a Winner!\n\nIt was still dark when I awoke Monday morning and sat down in front of the computer in my pajamas. Then, for the next hour or so, I followed the book award announcements live -- right hand scrolling down the Twitter feed, left hand holding my cellphone to relay the results to a friend in her darkened bookstore some ten miles away.\n\nShe was doing the two-handed thing as well, pressing a phone to each ear. I was on the right-hand phone, shouting out, \" CALPURNIA TATE just got an Honor!\" Then she'd turn to the phone in her left hand and tell her book distributor, \"I want to order ten copies of THE EVOLUTION OF CALPURNIA TATE.\" Then I'd yell \"MOUNTAIN MEETS THE MOON got an Honor!\" in her right ear and she'd turn to the left and add, \"I'll need fifteen copies of WHERE THE MOUNTAIN MEETS THE MOON.\"\n\nSibert, Printz, Caldecott, Newbery...it was a frantic morning.\n\nBut by the time the sun was fully up, we knew all the winners and my friend had ordered everything she needed for her store.\n\nI was very glad to help her out. In these uncertain times, independent bookstores -- the kind where they know your name and make personal recommendations -- are having an terrible time competing with the big chains and dot.com dealers. When Awards Day rolls around, everyone -- from local libraries to first edition collectors -- calls or drops by my friend’s store, trying to find the winning titles. So it was very important that she have these books in stock; her business depended on it.\n\nIt wasn't until the event was over and I'd turned off the computer and cellphone that I actually had time to reflect on the winning books. I thought the Newbery slate (winner WHEN YOU REACH ME by Rebecca Stead and Honor Books CLAUDETTE COLVIN by Phillip Hoose, THE EVOLUTION OF CALPURNIA TATE by Jacqueline Kelly, WHERE THE MOUNTAIN MEETS THE MOON by Grace Lin, and THE MOSTLY TRUE ADVENTURES OF HOMER P. FIGG by Rodman Philbrick) was a good one. And, with the exception of the Grace Lin book, which a friend found for me over the weekend and will mail later this week, I already owned all the other books in first edition. I was glad that I'd picked up a copy of HOMER FIGG months ago when I first heard someone of the 'net mention it as a Newbery possibility; it's now in at least its fourth printing. And WHEN YOU REACH ME is in at least its fifteenth printing, with first printings selling for over $100. On the other hand, the Printz list (winner GOING BOVINE by Libba Bray and Honor Books CHARLES AND EMMA by Deborah Heiligman, THE MONSTRUMOLOGIST by Rick Yancey, PUNKZILLA by Adam Rapp, and TALES OF THE MADMAN UNDERGROUND by John Barnes) contained some real surprises. I had only read a couple of these and didn’t own many of them either.\n\nThen I started thinking about all the strong books that weren't recognized by Newbery or Printz. TALES FROM OUTER SUBURBIA. CROSSING STONES. WINTERGIRLS. FIRE. WHEN THE WHISTLE BLOWS. MARCELLO AND THE REAL WORLD...on and on. When we talk about which books “won” this year’s awards, it’s natural to think of everything else as having “lost.”\n\nBut of course that’s not true.\n\nThere are so many factors that come into play when choosing a book for an award: the pool of possible contenders…the composition of the award committee…even luck.\n\nIn truth, all the books considered for an award are winners in their own way. Hey, just having a book accepted for publication out of the thousands and thousands of submissions is a kind of victory. And the day the awards are announced –- one of the few times a year that kids’ books get any national attention -– shines the spotlight not just on the handful of winning titles, but on the entire field of children’s literature.\n\nSo everyone's a winner on Newbery Day!\n\n...Though I have to admit I spent part of Monday feeling like a loser.\n\nAbout an hour after the award announcements, someone knocked at the front door and returned my wallet, which they had found tossed beside a dumpster down the street.\n\nIt was great that someone returned it, but…I never knew it was missing!\n\nThe previous evening I had made my usual Sunday-at-midnight midnight grocery run. As I struggled from the car with several heavy packages, my wallet had apparently wiggled out of my pocket and landed on the sidewalk. The next morning, some jerk found it, removed all the money, and then tossed it into the dumpster.\n\nI was pleased that it was found with credit cards still inside –- but furious about losing the money. I never carry more than $20 or so with me, but of course that happened to be the one time that I had over $100 in my wallet! And I can’t even understand the mentality of anyone who’d find a wallet full of identification and take all the cash inside. Is the world full of immoral opportunists?\n\nThe next evening, still feeling a little despondent, I stopped at my friend’s bookstore on the way home from work. She’d just received the shipment of the award books she’d ordered the previous morning. It did perk me up to see the entrance way was crowded with stockpiles of Siberts, piles of Printzes, stacks of Steads, and pyramids of Pinkneys. Because I didn’t have any cash (thanks a lot, wallet thief!) I took out my credit card to purchase the couple Sibert and Printz books I still needed for my collection (now come on, did anyone predict PUNKZILLA and MONSTRUMOLOGIST would win anything?) Then my bookstore friend handed me a book and said, “This is for you –- for helping me out with ordering the books yesterday.”\n\n“You don’t have to give me anything—-“ I began. But she insisted and pointed at the stacks of award-winning volumes in the aisle, saying, “If it hadn’t been for you, I would never have gotten my order in early enough yesterday to receive all these books today.”\n\nI looked down at the book in my hand. It was the brand-new Newbery winner, WHEN YOU REACH ME by Rebecca Stead. I said, “No, really, that’s okay. ...Besides, I already have this book.”\n\nShe said, “I know, but this is a special copy. I held back a handful of first editions when the book was released last summer, and I really want you to have it –- to trade or resell or whatever –- because you helped me with the order yesterday and have been a good friend to the store.”\n\nIt's funny how things turn out.\n\nI lost over $100 on Monday...but ended up receiving a book worth more than $100 on Tuesday!\n\nNewbery Day even made me feel like a winner this year.\n\nBrunching Before the Big Day\n\nI should start by apologizing for the recent erratic schedule of Collecting Children’s Books. A family member has been in the hospital and I haven’t had the time nor had the right mindset to blog. The good news is that my family member is now out of the hospital and on the road to recovery -- and I’m back to blogging...just in time for Newbery Day! A bookseller friend recently told me, “I have decided that award day for the kids and young adults is my favorite day every year. It is so much better than my birthday.”\n\nI agree...with one proviso: at least on your birthday you are reasonably certain that you’ll get a couple good presents. On Newbery Day you never know what you’re going to get.\n\nMaybe your favorite book will win and you’ll end up doing a Happy Beagle Dance.\n\nMaybe your least-favorite title will win and you’ll punch a hole through your computer screen. (Well, I haven’t done thatyet.)\n\nOr maybe the winner will be a book you never even heard of...and you’ll spend all day (or all year) trying to track down a copy.\n\nIt’s always kind of fun when the winner comes out of left field, especially when that selection makes perfect sense in retrospect and has everyone saying, “Why didn’t we think of that one?!” However, in my experience, surprise winners often turn out to be among the worst Newbery picks. And from a collecting perspective, they’re extremely difficult to find. Gone are the days when a title could win the Newbery or Caldecott and you could simply mosey into a bookstore, order a copy, and be moderately assured that a first edition would arrive. Due to increased interest in the children’s award winners -- as well as the advent of cellphones, blogging, and Twittering -- news of the Newbery and Caldecott is instantly broadcast from the floor of the convention center and, within minutes, the winning titles sell out at every book warehouse. They shoot to the top of the bestseller list at Amazon and we’re told, “Book out of stock.” I’ve even ordered copies of potential winners from used bookdealers only to have the orders cancelled after the awards are announced.\n\nBut for all that fuss and frustration, I’m always excited when N/C Day rolls around -- and tomorrow morning I’ll be sitting right here at my computer, hitting “refresh” over and over until the news appears on my screen. In one hand I’ll have a pen and paper, to jot down the winners. In the other hand I’ll have a bottle of Mylanta or a roll of Tums.\n\nTHE LIKELY SUSPECTS\n\nFor the past few months, Jonathan Hunt and Nina Lindsay have been keeping us apprised of possible Newbery frontrunners at the Heavy Medal Blog. A recent posting there said that Rebecca Stead’s WHEN YOU REACH ME has already won fourteen Mock Newbery polls -- far more than any other title.\n\nHere are some of the books which we may be hearing about tomorrow:\n\nWHEN YOU REACH ME by Rebecca Stead\n\nThis story of a girl growing up in New York City during the 1970s features a fascinating time-travel element. Already embraced by many readers, this novel has the feel of a modern classic -- even without a gold foil seal on its cover. If it wins, it will be a very popular selection. The only criticism I’ve heard against the book is that the details of the time-travel subplot are not accurately developed; I’m not sure I agree, as this aspect of the novel worked for me...but then I’m not a technically-oriented person. WHEN YOU REACH ME will be a difficult book for collectors to acquire in first edition; it’s already in its fifteenth printing with well over 100,000 copies released. Good luck finding one of the earliest editions.\n\nCLAUDETTE COLVIN : TWICE TOWARD JUSTICE by Phillip Hoose\n\nThis nonfiction work, about an Alabama teenager who made an early impact on the Civil Rights movement, has already won the National Book Award. Over at Heavy Medal, Jonathan Hunt has deemed it the year’s \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.\" I liked it too, especially because it marks the first time that Ms. Colvin’s life has been explored with depth in any type of book -- for children or adults. However, I also had a few small problems with the work. By focusing on two separate events -- Claudette’s initial trial for breaking segregation laws and, a year later, her participation in the Browder v. Gayle, busing case, the book never quite reaches a climax. Much of the story is told through Claudette’s own words, which certainly provides a sense of immediacy, but sometimes prevents the reader from seeing the bigger picture. For example, the organized efforts of Rosa Parks are not fully explored in relation to Claudette Colvin’s experiences. And some of those experiences need more context. We are told repeatedly that Claudette hopes to become a lawyer, yet we’re never (except for a brief throwaway paragraph) told why that dream died. The book is generally well-written, though I was bothered by the few instances of colloquial language (“gonna” instead of “going to,” etc.) in Ms. Colvin’s first-person passages -- something that, it seems, would either be consistently used throughout or not at all. Then there was occasional laziness in the prose (lines such as “Reporters flocked to Montgomery from all over the world to report...”, etc.) Still, CLAUDETTE COLVIN is a strong book -- a Newbery frontrunner that will no doubt receive other honors, such as Sibert recognition, at the ALA convention.\n\nTHE EVOLUTION OF CALPURNIA TATE by Jacqueline Kelly\n\nA Texas girl discovers the wonders of nature and science in this historical novel. I hear CALPURNIA has been picking up steam during Newbery season and would not be surprised if it won an Honor Award tomorrow, despite criticism that this promising debut novel is slow and a bit wordy.\n\nWHEN THE WHISTLE BLOWS by Fran Cannon Slayton\n\nAnother striking debut novel, this episodic tale of Jimmy's discovery of self and family in rural West Virginia could receive some Newbery recognition.\n\nPEACE, LOCOMOTION by Jacqueline Woodson\n\nI found this epistolary novel, a sequel to the author’s LOCOMOTION, a little slight, but never count out Ms. Woodson at Newbery time; she’s had three Honor titles in the past four years.\n\nWHERE THE MOUNTAIN MEETS THE MOON by Grace Lin\n\nLots of buzz for this novel, which I haven’t yet read. Has anyone even seen a first printing? Every bookstore seems to have received this one in its second printing!\n\nCHARLES AND EMMA : THE DARWINS’ LEAP OF FAITH by Deborah Heiligman\n\nLike CLAUDETTE COLVIN, this book deserves huge kudos for tackling a topic in a children’s book before it appeared in an adult work. It’s wonderfully written, too, but doesn’t have a lot of kid-appeal.\n\nSURPRISE WINNERS\n\nAlthough the above titles are among the frontrunners, it’s always possible that a book no one has considered could swoop in out of nowhere to claim the prize. There’s certainly precedent for that. Looking over the past thirty years, I see that the winning titles are well-divided among books that many would deem inevitable or “sure things”; titles that seemed possibilities; and some that no one was really expecting.\n\nThe following seemed inevitable, or at least very strong contenders, based on reviews, previous prizes won (NBA, BG-HB Award, etc.) and overall buzz:\n\n2009 / THE GRAVEYARD BOOK by Neil Gaiman\n\n2004 / THE TALE OF DESPERAUX by Kate DiCamillo\n\n2000 / BUD, NOT BUDDY by Christopher Paul Curtis\n\n1999 / HOLES by Louis Sachar\n\n1996 / THE MIDWIFE’S APPRENTICE by Karen Cushman\n\n1994 / THE GIVER by Lois Lowry\n\n1993 / MISSING MAY by Cynthia Rylant\n\n1991 / MANIAC MAGEE by Jerry Spinelli\n\n1986 / SARAH, PLAIN AND TALL by Patricia MacLachlan\n\n1985 / THE HERO AND THE CROWN by Robin McKinley\n\n1984 / DEAR MR. HENSHAW by Beverly Cleary\n\n1983 / DICEY’S SONG by Cynthia Rylant\n\n1981 / JACOB HAVE I LOVED by Katherine Paterson\n\nThe following weren’t “sure things,” but they had been discussed -- and sometimes mentioned in Mock Newbery Contests -- in the months leading up to the awards:\n\n2008 / GOOD MASTERS, SWEET LADIES by Laura Amy Schlitz\n\n2006 / CRISS CROSS by Lynne Rae Perkins\n\n2002 / A SINGLE SHARD by Linda Sue Park\n\n2001 / A YEAR DOWN YONDER by Richard Peck\n\n1998 / OUT OF THE DUST by Karen Hesse\n\n1997 / THE VIEW FROM SATURDAY by E.L. Konigsburg\n\n1990 / NUMBER THE STARS by Lois Lowry\n\n1989 / JOYFUL NOISE by Paul Fleischman\n\nThese books had very little buzz before they won the Newbery and, I believe, would be considered surprise winners by most people:\n\n2007 / THE HIGHER POWER OF LUCKY by Susan Patron\n\n2005 / KIRA-KIRA by Cynthia Kadohata\n\n2003 / CRISPIN : CROSS OF LEAD by Avi\n\n1995 / WALK TWO MOONS by Sharon Creech\n\n1992 / SHILOH by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor\n\n1988 / LINCOLN : A PHOTOBIOGRAPHY by Russell Freedman\n\n1987 / THE WHIPPING BOY by Sid Fleischman\n\n1982 / A VISIT TO WILLIAM BLAKE’S INN / Nancy Willard\n\n1980 / A GATHERING OFDAYS by Joan Blos\n\n...So, will this year’s winner be a sure thing, a sure thing, a possibility, or a complete surprise? Stay tuned.\n\nOTHER AWARDS\n\nThough the focus of today’s blog is the Newbery, I’m also very curious to hear what wins this year’s other awards.\n\nMany think that THE LION AND THE MOUSE by Jerry Pinkney is a shoo-in for the Caldecott.\n\nI haven’t heard much talk about the Printz Award this year, but I just hope the winner is something really enjoyable to read. I was the happiest guy in the world when they began this new award for young adult books in 2000, but too often I find the winners to be books I may admire but don’t always enjoy reading....\n\nRegarding the Coretta Scott King Awards: I recently received an e-mail about the Coretta Scott King Book Award Online Curriculum Resource Center , a free website that contains “more than nine hours of originally produced audio with Coretta Scott King Book Award authors and illustrators talking about their books in two- to three-minute clips” as well as lesson plans for these books. This resource was created to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the CSK Book Awards.\n\nSounds like it’s worth checking out.\n\nBLACK IS THE NEW PINK\n\nRemember a few years ago when everyone was complaining that the covers of young adult book were too pastel -- Milk of Magnesia Pink, Banana Milkshake Yellow, Easter Egg Purple? Well, yesterday I visited the young adult section of a chain store and discovered the predominant color of most young adult book jackets is now black. I guess that’s the influence of TWILGHT and ECLIPSE.\n\nBOOKS ABOUT HAITI\n\nWith Haiti on the cover of every newspaper and magazine this week, here is a list of children’s picture books and novels set in that country:\n\nTI JACQUES by Ruth Eitzen\n\nUNCLE BOUQUI OF HAITI by Harold Courlander\n\nTHE MAGIC ORANGE TREE AND OTHER HAITIAN FOLKTALES by Diane Wolkstein\n\nFRESH GIRL by Jaira Placide\n\nA TASTE OF SALT by Frances Temple\n\nTONIGHT, BY SEA by Frances Temple\n\nPAINTED DREAMS by Karen Lynn Williams\n\nANACAONA, GOLDEN FLOWER by Edwidge Danticat\n\nBEHIND THE MOUNTAINS by Edwidge Danticant\n\nRUNNING THE ROAD TO ABC by Denize Lauture\n\nTIP-TAP by Karen Lynn Williams\n\nMARASSA AND MIDNIGHT by Morna Stuart\n\nTHE GATHERING\n\nSomeone asked if the reason I haven’t been blogging this week was because I was trying to catch up on my reading before the awards were announced. I wish! Every year I find myself facing N/C Day with an enormous pile of books I still haven’t read. This year is no different. But whether I’ve read all the books or not, tomorrow morning will find me sitting in front of this computer on a better-than-a-birthday day, excitedly awaiting the news. You too?\n\nThanks for visiting Collecting Children’s Books. Please return soon."
