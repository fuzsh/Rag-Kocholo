        "text": "In preparation for this publication, author Arthea J.S. Reed spent time with Norma Fox Mazer, the widely acclaimed young adult novelist, who works with not only her husband, but her daughter as well. The book explores the facets of Mazer's works which mirror her own life.\n\nIn Norma Fox Mazer: A Writer's World, Reed chronicles her discovery that, although her husband and his work are thoroughly intertwined with and complimentary to her own, Norma Fox Mazer \"is fiercely independentâ€”a feminist.\" Reed was fortunate enough to be able to include Mazer's voice in this work as a compliment to her own thorough autobiographical and critical articles. Written primarily for those who are looking to garner a true understanding and appreciation of the craftsmanship behind Mazer's work, readers will also discern where the author stands in the context of the history of young adult literature. Reed provides a chronology of Mazer's twenty books and several awards, a selected bibliography, and a helpful index. The seven chapters of the book are titled: The Roots of Realism, Missing Pieces and Outsiders, Star-Crossed Love, Norma and Harry: Relationship, Romance and Writing, Writing for Young Readers, Fantasy and Suspense, and From Excellence to Mastery.\n\nPart 1 Preface\n\nPart 2 Chronology\n\nChapter 3 1.
