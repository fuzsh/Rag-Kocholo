C H A P T E R 3 <strong>Trends</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Issues</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>Young</strong> <strong>Adult</strong> <strong>Literature</strong> Introduction Over the last half century, experts have struggled to def<strong>in</strong>e young adult (YA) literature. <strong>Young</strong> adult literature, adolescent literature, juvenile literature, junior books, children’s literature, books for teens, <strong>and</strong> books for tweeners describe texts that bridge the gap between children’s literature <strong>and</strong> adult literature. Given the negative connotations of the words adolescents <strong>and</strong> teens, most experts today agree upon young adult literature. Follow<strong>in</strong>g are characteristics that have historically def<strong>in</strong>ed the genre: 1. The protagonist is a teenager. 2. Events revolve around the protagonist <strong>and</strong> his/her struggle to resolve conflict. 3. The story is told from the viewpo<strong>in</strong>t <strong>and</strong> <strong>in</strong> the voice of a young adult. 4. <strong>Literature</strong> is written by <strong>and</strong> for young adults. 5. <strong>Literature</strong> is marketed to the young adult audience. 6. Story doesn’t have a “storybook” or “happily-ever-after” end<strong>in</strong>g—a characteristic of children’s books. 7. Parents are noticeably absent or at odds with young adults. 8. Themes address com<strong>in</strong>g-of-age issues (e.g., maturity, sexuality, relationships, drugs). 9. Books conta<strong>in</strong> under 300 pages, closer to 200. Reliance upon a laundry list of characteristics, however, results <strong>in</strong> a narrow <strong>and</strong> mislead<strong>in</strong>g def<strong>in</strong>ition of young adult literature. Consider, for <strong>in</strong>stance, the characteristics parents are noticeably absent/ or at odds with young adults <strong>and</strong> themes address com<strong>in</strong>g -ofage issues. These are characteristics of the earliest young adult novels, the problem novels discussed <strong>in</strong> Chapter 4 that laid the genre’s foundation <strong>and</strong> that gave voice to the realistic struggles <strong>and</strong> issues of adolescence. While the problem novel holds an YA books range from th<strong>in</strong> novellas to books with 800+ pages. 49
