        "text": "“Drama is life with the dull bits cut out”\n\nAlfred Hitchcock (1899–1980), also known as the “Master of Suspense” was one of the most prolific directors of his time, with a total of 53 films under his resume. A native Brit, he entered the film industry as a title card designer for silent films. However, his nuanced understanding of suspense, emotions and twist endings reflected in his short stories from a young age, gradually made him one of the best British directors of his time.\n\nHe was catapulted to international success and fame when his first Hollywood movie, Rebecca (1940) won the Oscar for best picture. This win cemented his place in the epicenter of Western cinema, spawning numerous, genre bending films over the decades that completely disintegrated and redefined the rules and conventions of suspense and thrill. Under this umbrella of suspense his visual and thematic style ranged from comedy, romance and adventure, to more serious themes of death, guilt and despair. While for many he reached his stylistic peak in the late 1950’s and early 60’s, (Rear Window, North by Northwest, Psycho, Dial M etc.), he had already mastered the sinister and the dark in his earlier films, earning his title of the “thriller director” long before coming to Hollywood.\n\n“I’m not against the police; I’m just afraid of them”\n\nHitchcock grew up in Essex outside London, in a milieu once haunted by Jack the Ripper. His childhood was restricted, sheltered, and severely disciplined by his stern and harsh father. One time as a punishment, he sent Hitchcock to the local police station with a note that requested the sergeant on duty to lock him up in a cell for 10 minutes. This incident left a lasting impression on Hitchcock, giving him a fear of enclosed spaces, mistrust for the police, and a concern for the wrongful accusation and imprisonment of the innocent. As a result of such harsh punishments, and to some extent his obesity, Hitchcock’s childhood was rather lonely and suppressed. These experiences and their impact is reflected in his films, through both the themes and his mature grasp of human psychology and emotion.\n\nHitchcock films often center on espionage and murder, with mistaken identities and chase sequences enrichening the plot, along with a pinch of dry humor and macabre. These re occurring plots and elements are often part of the three most common themes or character arcs in his films.\n\nThe first is the story of an innocent man who has been mistakenly suspected or accused of a crime and must track down the real perpetrator in order to clear himself of his public guilt, while the police remain incompetent. This theme strongly taps into Hitchcock’s childhood fears of wrongful accusation and aversion of police. This is best explored in the romantic thriller North by Northwest (1959), where innocent Roger is mistaken for someone else and is chased across the country by a group of spies. It is his emotional and physical journey that we follow, as he seeks out the true culprit in order to rectify his public guilt. Moreover, his and Eve’s rescue atop the Mt. Rushmore does not come from the police.\n\nThe second theme is that of the cold and guilty woman who entraps a male protagonist (often handicapped in some way), only to either destroy him, or end up being saved by him. This is best encompassed in no other film than Vertigo (1958), where Judy has been hired by another man to play the dream woman “Madeleine”, in a murder plot against the acrophobic “Scotty”. However, in tricking him she has tricked herself, by falling in love with him too. Judy, or “Madeleine” is blonde, icy, cold, and remote, just like other Hitchcockian women, and treads the line between public (when Judy’s truth is revealed), and private (Judy’s guilt and realization upon seeing Scotty’s obsessive state) guilt and moral ambiguity, but never that of innocence. Hence, in typical fashion, her redemption in the form of love only comes after being dragged to her lowest point.\n\nThe 3rd theme involves the psychopathic murderer whose identity is established during the working out of the plot. This is best embodied in the psychological unravelling of Norman Bates, the protagonist/villain of Psycho (1960). Marion Crane’s murder in the iconic shower scene sets of Norman’s story, as Hitchcock explores the disintegration of his mind and challenges the audience complacency. He does this by often ambushing the audience into rooting for the criminally insane psychopaths, just as how we hope Norman can successfully bury Marion’s car and hide all traces of the crime. These themes reveal most Hitchcock characters or protagonists to be morally ambiguous, shifting between some form of guilt and innocence.\n\nHitchcock engages the audience in these plots and stories through various technical and narrative devices, over which, as the following examples prove, he had achieved complete mastery and control. One such device is his frequent use of doubling on screen, in which he places the guilty or villainous character/s on one side and the innocent on the other in order to create a split or contrasting image. Each character is then filmed from either right or left position (based on their conscience) or better yet, they are positioned on either side of the frame.\n\nThis technique is frequently used in Psycho to subtly hint at character motivations and guilt, and to set up the predator and prey contrast between Norman and Marion. This is best seen in a medium shot of both Marion and Norman outside her room. Each are placed on the left (Norman) and right (Marion) edges of the frame, with space in the middle. This sets up the divide in personality and character between them, as one is guilty and the other innocent.\n\nAnother technical element that Hitchcock employs is the clever use of the “Mise-en-scene”. This refers to all the elements and visuals that appear on camera/onscreen and their arrangement. Hitchcock makes effective use of this in the parlor scene of Marion and Norman in Psycho. The props, (arrangement of the stuffed birds), camera angles and lighting all come together to indicate at Norman’s deranged mind and emotions, and Marion’s relative innocence, possibility of redemption for her sins, and her prey like entrapment.\n\nIn one particular medium/medium wide shot of Norman, the frame is cluttered with predatory birds above him, his long shadow behind, and sharp and vertical objects (dresser and candlestick) in the background. This packed frame leaves little breathing room for the audience, causing all elements to clash with one another. This in turn hints at the clash of personalities within Norman (himself and Mother’s), while the birds infer at his own predatory nature. The masterful use of these techniques reveal Hitchcock’s ability to portray complex psychological states and human emotions and conflict, purely through the image on the screen.\n\nMost Hitchcock movies often begin with some conflict which may not be significantly, related to the main plot. That is because he commonly used a particular narrative device, called “MacGuffin” to trigger the action. MacGuffin is an object, event, or person introduced early on to move the rest of the film forward, however, it bears little relevance to the actual experience of the film. A clear example of this lies in North by Northwest, where the McGuffin is Roger’s mistaken identity of a US agent, which is followed by his chase across the country by a group of spies. This premise, and the spies themselves are irrelevant to the emotional experiences of the film, which comes from the main character’s emotional and physical adventure.\n\nHitchcock was able to weave all these themes, technical elements and story device into the genres of suspense and thriller. However, the suspense and thrill never took attention away from the emotional and psychological motivations of the characters. Early on his career, Hitchcock tried to associate himself with German Expressionism, a movement that is often seen as horror cinema. This enabled him to present his films as unique, while also establish a reputation as an artistic director who pandered to popular appeal, a point proven by the commercial success of his films.\n\n“There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it”\n\nHitchcock’s nuanced understanding and effective employment of suspense, thrill, and horror come from his belief of a clear distinct between suspense and shock/surprise, often explained using a time bomb analogy. If a bomb goes off in a scene without any prior knowledge given to the audience, there will be shock, but it will only last for 10 to 15 seconds. However, if the viewers are shown the bomb being placed, a ticking time, and a clock on the wall behind the characters in the same room, all the action and dialogue prior to the blast becomes vital, keeping the audience engaged for 10 minutes instead of 15 seconds. This is what creates suspense. Hence, subversion, and terror come from the built up of suspense, and the resulting shock. Surprise or shock on its own will not have a lasting impact. For Hitchcock, suspenseful arrangement depended on allowing the audience to learn certain parts of the story, before the characters themselves. This set up is then used to disrupt the balance between the expected and unexpected. Through a suspenseful structure, Hitchcock creates expectations that can then be thwarted or subverted. This distinction however, is often seen as an attempt to create a brand of film making that was once again unique from the 1940’s cycle of shocker films.\n\nThis balanced structure of suspense however, was broken by Psycho. In this movie Hitchcock productively employs both suspense and shock, with the latter serving the former to deliver an unexpected bout of terror and twist to the audience towards the end. The murders of Marion and the private investigator are not preceded by any major clues and come as nothing but pure shock for the audience. There is only slight uneasiness a few seconds prior to Marion’s murder when we see the Mother’s blurred silhouette behind the shower curtain, slowly approaching. However, these scenes of shock give us the information and knowledge that Lila Crane does not have when she goes inside the Bates manor towards the end of the film. This makes the film’s climax extremely gripping, keeping the audience transfixed at the edge of their seats in unease and suspense. Hitchcock uses the earlier scenes of surprise to create suspense and certain expectations of the outcome, which he then disintegrates or subverts by revealing the true identity of the killer, and thus, delivering a much more lasting shock and terror as a result.\n\nAnother means by which Hitchcock unhinged audience expectations about where and how terror may strike and maintain suspense was by deliberately avoiding traditional gothic settings in thrilling scenes. An example of this is the broad daylight attack of the small plane in North by Northwest.\n\n“Give them pleasure - The same pleasure they have when they wake up from a nightmare”\n\nHitchcock’s meticulous use and understanding of suspense is rooted in his lifelong source of inspiration, that being the dark and macabre writings of Edgar Ellen Poe. He learned much about suspense and horror from Poe’s prose and poetry, resulting in many similarities between their works. In fact, Hitchcock learnt one of the most defining aspect of his film making from Poe. That being, the importance of focusing on the audience in creating the “effect” of the film’s action. Poe’s influence led Hitchcock to realize and develop his own theories and techniques for audience manipulation (avoidance of gothic settings, giving away clues etc.). This may be reason why Hitchcock films strike a good balance between mass appeal and critical acclaim.\n\nDespite his films being defined over the years as suspense and horror thrillers, Hitchcock always engaged the audience through emotion, i.e. by making them feel a certain way. This he did by putting great emphasis on the character’s emotions and conflicts, which at times, also reflected his own mental and emotional state. One such aspect that he was obsessed with was the irrational mind and behavior as a subject matter for providing audience unease and building suspense. For Hitchcock, people were often motivated by irrational obsessions and guilt, resulting in inexplicable actions opposite of what is expected of them. This is reflected in Marion’s theft of $40,000, an act that surprised both her and the audience.\n\nHitchcock’s most effective study of the irrational mind and fears is seen in Vertigo, which is based on the book D entre Les Morts (1954). In adapting Vertigo to screen, Hitchcock made Scotty’s acrophobia a central focus and driving point of the film’s metaphors. His fear of falling reflects his fear of falling in love, while both fears foreshadow his gradual fall from sanity. This film is often considered very close to Hitchcock. That is because the theme of irrational fears and behaviors portrayed in Vertigo reflect his own chaotic psyche filled with deep rooted fears and frustrations that could not be mitigated by his own success, or his jolly, extroverted public persona.\n\n“The only way to get rid of my fears is to make films about them”\n\nHitchcock’s isolated and controlled upbringing led him to become a vulnerable, sensitive, and emotional man, who was filled with terrors of romantic natures, and other types (police phobia). Hence, the countless images and fear of death and falling in Vertigo and other movies are an extension of other nameless fears on screen and in the personal life of Hitchcock. Moreover, Hitchcock particularly suffered from “romantic fantasies”. Just as Scotty became unhinged and dizzy in his obsession, infatuation, or lust, so did Hitchcock (due to these fantasies), causing him to lose control over his desires, fears and persona at several times in his life.\n\nHis romantic fears however, transcend the boundaries of episodic frenzy. This can be seen in Vertigo, where Scotty’s depiction of “Madeleine” through Judy’s forceful transformation, unwittingly depicts Hitchcock’s own obsession with the visual realization and depiction of his female characters, as seen in his meticulous creation of the blonde female star. In these ways a film such as Vertigo almost becomes an extension of Hitchcock’s psyche, while also justifying his strong grasp and clarity over his characters’ emotions and mind.\n\nHitchcock’s rich and macabre landscape of films extending over multiple decades has truly earned him the reputation of one of the best directors of Western cinema. While he may have transformed the horror and suspense genre, it is Hitchcock’s control over and depiction of complex human emotions through pure images (framing, composition etc.) with technical mastery that make his films truly memorable. By being able to exert control over his character’s fears and emotions however, art and story for Hitchcock became a route to a utopia of control and stability, something denied to him on many occasions in real life.\n\n“Some of our most exquisite murders have been domestic, performed with tenderness in simple, homey places like the kitchen table”\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBarson, Michael. “Alfred Hitchcock.” Encyclopedia Britannica Inc.
