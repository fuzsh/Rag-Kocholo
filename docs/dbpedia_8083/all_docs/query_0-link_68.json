        "text": "18 Overlooked Gems\n\nFilms like Unbroken, Interstellar and Foxcatcher — none of which grabbed Oscar noms for best picture in 2015 — have heady company. Singin' in the Rain (1952) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) are both universally adored, but neither were in the mix for the top Oscar prize. Here are 16 other examples.\n\nSnubbed: ‘King Kong’; Winner: ‘Cavalcade’ (1934)\n\nThe original King Kong, which didn't land any Oscar nominations, is now considered a bonafide classic. Nabbing the 42nd slot on the American Film Institute's updated 2007 list of the 100 greatest films ever made, it was added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1991.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Duck Soup’; Winner: ‘Cavalcade’ (1934)\n\nDuck Soup, considered by some to be the Marx Brothers' finest film, ranks No. 60 on AFI's 2007 list of the 100 greatest films ever made.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Bringing Up Baby’; Winner: ‘You Can’t Take It With You’ (1939)\n\nRanking at No. 88 on AFI's list, Bringing Up Baby was completely overlooked by the Academy in its day, landing zero noms. The Cary Grant–Katharine Hepburn screwball comedy joined the National Film Registry in 1990.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Singin’ in the Rain’; Winner: ‘The Greatest Show on Earth’ (1953)\n\nSingin' in the Rain is considered to be one of the finest films ever made and ranks at No. 5 on AFI's top-films list. But the Academy didn't appear to agree at the time, handing the Gene Kelly musical just two nominations.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Rear Window’; Winner: ‘On the Waterfront’ (1955)\n\nRear Window, which picked up four Oscar nominations, joined the National Film Registry in 1997 and currently sits at No. 48 on the AFI list.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Rebel Without a Cause’; Winner: ‘Marty’ (1956)\n\nGrabbing three Oscar nominations, Rebel Without a Cause was later added to the National Film Registry in 1990.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Vertigo’; Winner: ‘Gigi’ (1959)\n\nCritics are now generally enamored with Vertigo, which stands at No. 9 on the AFI list and No. 1 on the British Film Institute's top-films list. Things were a bit different different in its day, when the Jimmy Stewart–Kim Novak psychological thriller mustered up just two Oscar noms.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Some Like It Hot’; Winner: ‘Ben-Hur’ (1960)\n\nThe Academy has traditionally been stingy toward comedies, and the same was true of the Billy Wilder-directed Some Like It Hot, which earned six nominations but just one win. The AFI has since named it the best comedy of all time.\n\nSnubbed: ‘North by Northwest’; Winner: ‘Ben-Hur’ (1960)\n\nConsidered to be among Alfred Hitchcock's greatest achievements, North by Northwest ranks at No. 55 on the AFI list and was selected for the National Film Registry in 1995. The Cary Grant thriller landed three Oscar nominations but no wins.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Psycho’; Winner: ‘The Apartment’ (1961)\n\nPerhaps Hitchcock's best-known film, Psycho garnered zero Oscars from four nominations. It currently sits at No. 14 on the AFI greatest-films list, getting picked for the National Film Registry in 1992.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’; Winner: ‘West Side Story’ (1962)\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany's won Oscars for original song and original score, along with picking up three other noms. The Audrey Hepburn comedy grabbed a spot on the National Film Registry in 2012.\n\nSnubbed: ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’; Winner: ‘Oliver!’ (1969)\n\nPerhaps the Academy didn't quite know what to make of Stanley Kubrick's seminal sci-fi film, which nabbed four nominations in 1968, including a win for visual effects. Today, 2001 is very well-regarded, sitting at No. 15 on the AFI list and joining the National Film Registry in 1991.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Easy Rider’; Winner: ‘Midnight Cowboy’ (1970)\n\nAdded to the Library of Congress National Registry in 1998, Easy Rider — which earned two Oscar nominations — ranks No. 84 on AFI's most great-films list.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Close Encounters of the Third Kind’; Winner: ‘Annie Hall’ (1978)\n\nConsidered to be among director Steven Spielberg's finest films, Close Encounters picked up a whopping eight Oscar nominations — including a win for cinematography — but no nomination for the top prize. It was added to the National Film Registry in 2007.\n\nSnubbed: ‘The Shining’; Winner: ‘Ordinary People’ (1981)\n\nThe Shining didn't pick up a single Oscar nomination but is now regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Blade Runner’; Winner: ‘Gandhi’ (1983)\n\nBlade Runner, which picked up Oscar nominations for art direction and visual effects, is now considered a sci-fi classic and ranked No. 97 on the AFI's 2007 list of the top 100 films ever made. It earned a spot on the National Film Registry in 1993.\n\nSnubbed: ‘Almost Famous’; Winner: ‘Gladiator’ (2001)\n\nCameron Crowe took home the original screenplay Oscar for Almost Famous, which was also nominated in three other categories. While it didn't get a best picture nomination, it did receive the Golden Globe trophy for best comedy or musical."
