        "text": "Movie Night at the Ebenezer features classic and influential films one Friday every month\n\nwith drinks and small plates by Executive Chef de Cuisine Harley Peet.\n\nDoors open at 6:30 / Film begins at 7:00 PM\n\nConcessions and bar open at 6:30.\n\nNorth by Northwest is a 1959 American spy thriller film, produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. The screenplay was by Ernest Lehman, who wanted to write \"the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures\".\n\nNorth by Northwest is a tale of mistaken identity, with an innocent man pursued across the United States by agents of a mysterious organization trying to prevent him from blocking their plan to smuggle microfilm, which contains government secrets, out of the country. This is one of several Hitchcock films that feature a music score by Bernard Herrmann and an opening title sequence by graphic designer Saul Bass, and was the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography in its opening credits.\n\nNorth by Northwest is listed among the canonical Hitchcock films of the 1950s and is often listed among the greatest films of all time. It was selected in 1995 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". After its first screening, reviewers for The New Yorker and The New York Times immediately hailed it as a masterpiece of comedic, sophisticated self-parody.\n\nRun time 2 hr. 16 min."
