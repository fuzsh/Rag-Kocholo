        "text": "Thelma & Louise, The Breakfast Club and The Birds are among the 25 films selected for preservation by the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, it has been announced.\n\nEach year the National Film Preservation Board advises congress on which titles should be added to the registry, along with nominations from the public. To qualify, a film must be at least a decade old and be “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant”.\n\nThe 1991 thriller Thelma & Louise, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, was considered a landmark in Hollywood’s portrayal of women characters. The Breakfast Club, written and directed by the late John Hughes and released in 1985, is arguably the best-known of the 1980s teen-movie cycle that included Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (both already in the register) and Pretty in Pink.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s 1963 thriller The Birds joins a number of the director’s other films on the list, including North by Northwest, Vertigo and Psycho.\n\nFull list of films selected for the National Film Registry"
