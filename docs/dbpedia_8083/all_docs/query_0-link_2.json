Cary Grant stars as an innocent man mistaken for a spy in one of director Alfred Hitchcocks greatest thrillers. While leaving New Yorks Plaza Hotel, advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) has the misfortune of standing just as the name George Kaplan is pagedstarting a lethal case of mistaken identity and a nonstop game of cat and mouse as he is pursued across North America by espionage agents trying to kill himand by police who suspect him of murder.\n\n\"North by Northwest\" (1959) was filmed in VistaVision and released in 1,85:1. Warner Bros.\n\nMotion Picture Imaging scanned the original 8-perf 35mm VistaVision camera negative in 13k with all restoration work completed in 6.5k, Sheri Eisenberg, Colorist.\n\nThe 70mm film print was created at Fotokem by filming out a new 65mm negative. Warner Bros. Post Production Creative Services created a 5.1 audio mix from the original mono stems with Doug Mountain, Sound Mixer. Inventure Studios created the DTS encoded deliverable of the restored audio to playback flawlessly with the 70mm film print.
