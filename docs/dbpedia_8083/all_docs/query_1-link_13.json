        "text": "Thelma and Louise just rode its way into the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress. On Wednesday, librarian of Congress Carla Hayden announced the 25 new films that have been added to the registry; among its picks are popular classics like Disney’s The Lion King, Barbra Streisand’s Funny Girl, and the John Hughes high-school drama The Breakfast Club.\n\nThe film selection has become an annual tradition. The head librarian, along with the National Film Preservation Board and library specialists, pluck out movies that are “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.” Public nominations are also considered.\n\nAnother film joining the registry this year is legendary drag-queen documentary Paris Is Burning. Released in 1990, the Jennie Livingston–directed film documents the competitive ball scene and L.G.B.T. community in New York City in the 1980s.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s The Birds was also selected, joining other previously selected Hitchcock classics like Pyscho and North by Northwest. The Birds, in particular, however, popped up in headlines earlier this year when star Tippi Hedren revealed the sexual abuse and harassment she endured from Hitchcock while making both this film and Marnie.\n\nComedy fans will be glad to see the 1987 Rob Reiner film The Princess Bride join the registry as well, while Wes Anderson fans will happily note Rushmore’s selection. The quirky high-school film stars Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman as a pair of unlikely friends. Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the half-animated, half-live-action comedy directed by Robert Zemeckis, was also selected this year.\n\nOne of the oldest films to join the registry is The Musketeers of Pig Alley, released in 1912. Directed by D.W. Griffith, it’s considered the first gangster film ever made and clocks in at a brisk 17 minutes. There’s also Life of an American Fireman, directed by film pioneer Edwin S. Porter and released in 1903.\n\nHere are the 25 films that made the cut this year:\n\nThe Atomic Cafe (1982)\n\nBall of Fire (1941)\n\nThe Beau Brummels (1928)\n\nThe Birds The (1963)\n\nBlackboard Jungle (1955)\n\nThe Breakfast Club (1985)\n\nThe Decline of Western Civilization (1981)\n\nEast of Eden (1955)\n\nFunny Girl (1968)\n\nLife of an American Fireman (1903)\n\nThe Lion King (1994)\n\nLost Horizon (1937)\n\nThe Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912)\n\nParis Is Burning (1990)\n\nPoint Blank (1967)\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987)\n\nPutney Swope (1969)\n\nRushmore (1998)\n\nSolomon Sir Jones films (1924-28)\n\nSteamboat Bill, Jr. (1928)\n\nSuzanne, Suzanne (1982)\n\nThelma & Louise (1991)\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1916)\n\nA Walk in the Sun (1945)\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nGhostbusters, Top Gun, and Film About a Sneeze Are Officially Preserved for History\n\nThe National Film Registry makes more of its delightfully diverse choices.\n\nThe Canon\n\nProof That Forrest Gump Is a Work of Art\n\nIf MoMA says so, it must be true.\n\nPolitics\n\nCould Global Tensions Puncture the Olympic Bubble?\n\nThe Olympics are often viewed as a respite from politics, but multiple wars and rising global tensions will be hard to ignore this year. “I’m here to bring awareness,” says Valerie Tarazi, a swimmer representing Palestine at the 2024 Summer Games.\n\nHollywood\n\nTrump’s Politics Aside, Do We Want a President With Pop-Culture References This Old?\n\n“The late, great Hannibal Lecter. He’s a wonderful man.” “Nobody could moonwalk like Michael Jackson.” “You know how many times I did The View?” Now that Biden is out of the race, please consider that these are actual statements Donald Trump has recently made.\n\nHollywood\n\nInside Kamala Harris’s Loyal Circle of Hollywood Friends\n\n“I used to say, ‘I wish voters saw the Kamala we know.’ And I feel like in the last 24 hours, more people are.”\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US.
