Harrison\n\nThe Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Memorial Hospital was built in 1926 to serve the railroad's employees by providing emergency medical and health care. It was one of the last buildings constructed by the railroad in Albuquerque, and was one of 13 hospitals AT&SF built along its route from Chicago to Los Angeles. At the time of its construction it was the largest hospital in the state of New Mexico.\n\nThe site originally contained three buildings, the most significant being the masonry hospital built in the Italianate style and now home to the Hotel Parq Central. There is also the ancillary SANS building (Nurses and Physicians residence) in the Mediterranean style and the mechanical building housing the original boilers. The protection of these buildings and their detailing is included under its Landmark status.\n\nThe hospital remained operational until 1982 when it was closed. It was subsequently used by various health related entities until 2007 at which time its conversion to a luxury hotel began. In 2011, the City of Albuquerque named the AT&SF Memorial Hospital building a City Landmark.\n\nAtchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Passenger Depot (Demolished)\n\n314 First SW, 1902, Charles Whittlesey\n\nAtchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Locomotive 2926\n\n1833 8th NW\n\nAtchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Fire Station\n\nFirst/Second SW, 1920, E.A. Harrison\n\nBarelas Community Center\n\n801 Barelas Road SW\n\nBataan Memorial Park\n\n3401 Lomas NE between Amherst & Tulane, 1943\n\nIn 1941, 1,800 men from the 200th and 515th Coast Artillery Regiment, mostly men from New Mexico, deployed to the Philippines to partake in war simulations. Within 3 months the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor and invaded the Philippines. After four months of fierce fighting, the Japanese broke through Allied lines. This led to the eventual fall of Bataan peninsula and the death march to confinement camps. Of the 1,816 men 200th & 515th Coast Artillery men identified, 829 died in battle, while prisoners, or immediately after liberation. There were 987 survivors.\n\nIn 1943, the City of Albuquerque dedicated the Bataan Memorial Park with a resolution that reads, in part, as follows: “The people of Albuquerque desire, in a spirit of humility, to pay tribute to its soldiers, both living and dead, who served so nobly, that their deeds and sacrifices shall forever be etched in the memories of the people of the community which they left for so valiant service to their country.”\n\nThe desire to preserve the historical integrity of the park resulted in it being placed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1999. On November 11, 2012, the City of Albuquerque dedicated Bataan Memorial Park as a City Landmark.\n\nDe Anza Motor Lodge\n\n4301 Central NE, 1939\n\nEl Vado Auto Court\n\n2500 Central SW, 1937\n\nErnie Pyle House/Library\n\n900 Girard SE, 1940, Mount and McCollum, Builders\n\nHeights Community Center\n\n823 Buena Vista SE, 1938, Alvin Emrick, Building Foreman\n\nHighland/Hudson Hotel Building\n\n202 Central, 1905, Francis W.

Trost\n\nOld Airport Terminal\n\n2920 Yale SE, 1939, Ernest Blumenthal\n\nThe Municipal Airport began with the sale of land to the city by Transcontinental and Western Airlines in 1936. Designed by then City Architect Ernest Blumenthal, construction for the terminal began on the site in 1937, completed in 1939. Funded by the Works Progress Administration, construction utilized local materials, including adobe bricks made on the site and wood and flagstone from the mountain forests near the city.\n\nWPA workers spent thousands of hours crafting details of the building. Exterior features include a stepped parapet, exposed vigas, wooden posts with corbel brackets, and observation tower and a flagstone entry. The main lobby area is of the most historical significance on the interior of the building, featuring high ceilings with herringbone latillas, rough-hewn beams, heavy wood columns with corbel brackets, rough-plastered walls, recessed bays with ornate wooden screens, tin chandeliers, flagstone floors, and a corner fireplace. During WWII, the U.S. Government occupied and operated out of the terminal, which led to the establishment of the Albuquerque Army Air Field, and eventually Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nThe original 1939 building has been altered with several later additions, but the early form and integrity of the structure, including the interior detailing, remains essentially intact. The Junior League of Albuquerque, with offices in the building at the time, pursued a National Register of Historic Places designation for the Old Terminal in 1989.\n\nSince then, work has been done to rehabilitate and restore the Old Airport Terminal. The first phase of rehabilitation was implemented in 1997 that included the demolition of all the additions post-1945 and basic renovation to the 1942 and 1945 buildings to bring the terminal up to code and restore among other things the casement windows and lighting. The second phase began in 2001 and includes site revisions to the traffic island and walkways and contemporary rehabilitation of the original Ticket Counter into a reception counter.\n\nThe Sunport’s Old Terminal is available for rent.
